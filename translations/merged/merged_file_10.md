# Chapter 639: Yuan Fuyao

Jiang Heqian sighed and glanced at Li Ximing. Suddenly, Li Ximing's curiosity was piqued, and he asked, "There is one question that troubles me. Back then, what happened to Fei Wangbai?"

"Wangbai?" Jiang Heqian took a few steps and seated himself at the head of the table. Picking up a teacup, he replied lightly, "Naturally, he was killed by an immortal sect."

"Which sect, if I may ask?" Li Ximing paused, his confusion evident.

Jiang Heqian immediately cursed, "How would I know? Do you think immortal sects are trustworthy? Even Yue Cultivating Sect—if their interests were threatened, they would kill without hesitation!"

Jiang Heqian continued, "Wangbai had a Shared Dao with Daoist Master Shangyuan of Yue Cultivating Sect. Yue Cultivating Sect has an alchemy technique that could refine him to nourish Shangyuan. Azure Pond Sect was bound to want him dead eventually!"

Jiang Heqian gave Li Ximing a sideways glance, and before he could respond, Jiang Heqian spoke casually, "But what about your Li Family? With your connection to the Bright Yang Dao Lineage, why did Li Tongya choose to cultivate Pit Water?"

Li Ximing replied evenly, "At the time, our family had fallen into decline. Cultivation resources were scarce, so he had no choice but to pursue Pit Water."

Jiang Heqian paused briefly, having only mentioned the topic in passing. Hearing Li Ximing's response, he felt no need to engage further in meaningless chatter and continued, "Since your esteemed family killed Yu Muxian, did you obtain the Foundation Establishment Realm artifact, Jade Smoke Mountain? After all, it was once an heirloom of my clan. If it is in your possession, I would like to offer an exchange."

Li Ximing shook his head and replied, "You misunderstand, senior. That person died within the grotto heaven but did not bring the artifact with him. It is likely still on Yuanwu Peak."

Jiang Heqian stroked his beard. Realizing the artifact's whereabouts were still uncertain, he sighed and asked, "The Yu Family is now scattered. Has your family made any follow-up arrangements?"

Li Ximing avoided delving too deeply into the matter and replied politely, "Such trivial matters hardly warrant troubling you, senior. Our elders have made appropriate arrangements."

Jiang Heqian chuckled and said, "Let me offer a word of advice, for the sake of old ties. Be cautious. The downfall of my family is still a recent memory. If another Jiang Family were to rise here, without earning the trust of Azure Pond Sect or Golden Feather Sect, it would surely be destined to splinter into pieces!"

His expression carried a hint of mockery, and his tone felt more like ridicule. Li Ximing found it difficult to respond and simply fist cupped in acknowledgment.

After a brief pause, Jiang Heqian continued softly, "I mean the trust of Azure Pond Sect, not Yuan Su. How much longer does Yuan Su have to live? He cannot secure anything for you!"

With a flick of his sleeve, Jiang Heqian threw out this statement, seeming to lose interest in the conversation. Lowering his gaze, he said, "Revenge has been served. The Yu Family's blood feud has been repaid in full. I will spend the rest of my days wandering the world. I will not return to the lakes. The Jiang Family is but a wisp of smoke now, and this matter ends here."

With that, he stepped out of the courtyard. As if remembering something, he retrieved an item from his storage pouch.

It was round and heavy, with black hair cascading down—a severed head. The eyes were clouded gray, the skin taut, and the mouth slightly ajar, revealing a dark, gaping void.

"This is Yu Mugao's head," he said, tossing it onto the ground before departing on the wind.

Li Ximing picked up the head and gave it a quiet glance. Yu Mugao had once sparred with Li Yuanjiao and others in secret, but this was the fate he had met. He gave instructions, "Take this to the elders and An Zheyan for them to see. Let it ease their grievances. Then, bring it to my uncle's grave as an offering to our ancestors."

Li Wushao bowed and carried the head away. Li Ximing, meanwhile, adjusted his robes and returned to his chambers to resume his secluded cultivation.

Yu Mugao's head was passed around among the clan members. Some wept, others laughed. For most of the elders, it was a moment of catharsis. However, none were as emotional as An Zheyan, who shed hot tears.

After it had made its rounds, Li Xuanxuan hurried down and took the head up the mountain.

Li Yuanxiu's death had been one of the greatest sorrows of Li Xuanxuan's life. Though he had endured much suffering, his hatred had not diminished—it had only deepened over time.

It was like his left eye, scarred by demonic flames. Though it caused no pain on ordinary days, when he squinted, it burned with a searing heat, a constant reminder that his wounds remained unhealed.

Li Yuexiang accompanied the old man up the mountain, watching as he spoke quietly to the gravestone. The severed head sat on the altar, motionless and silent.

Li Yuexiang stayed with him for half a day. Only when someone came up the mountain to summon her did she prepare to leave. Looking closely, she saw it was Li Wushao.

Li Wushao kneeled on one knee and said softly, "Miss, someone from the Yuan Family has arrived."

Li Yuexiang had no choice but to leave the graveyard. She descended the mountain and flew to the central hall of Lijing Town. Outside the hall stood a line of attendants. Before she even entered, she could already hear Li Chengliao's voice, "Senior, you are being too polite! There is no need for this!"

As she stepped inside, she saw two attendants at the rear and two individuals standing at the front.

One was an elderly man with neatly combed white hair, tall and imposing, with the cultivation level of an early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. He looked to be about 180 years old and wore a beaming smile.

The man was speaking earnestly, saying, "Do not say such things. Even this Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation of mine is thanks to Nephew Yuanjiao! Not to mention the Essence Gathering Pill he gave me, even the idea of breaking through was inspired by him!"

Li Yuexiang's arrival interrupted their conversation. Li Chengliao quickly stepped forward with a smile and said, "Aunt, you are here! This is Senior Yuan Huyuan and Young Master Yuan Fuyao."

The speaker was Yuan Huyuan, who had broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm at the age of 100. Though his success was largely due to the Essence Gathering Pill, it was undeniably a stroke of luck. The elderly man now appeared decades younger, radiating the demeanor of a high cultivator who had achieved the Dao.

As for the young man standing behind him, he was strikingly handsome, tall, and wore a calm expression. Draped in luxurious robes, he carried an air of nobility.

Given that Yuan Chengdun was already quite good-looking, Yuan Fuyao naturally inherited these traits. Among cultivators, his appearance was exceptional. Li Yuexiang glanced at him briefly and noticed the astonishment in his eyes as he looked at her.

Several chests of spirit treasures were displayed in the hall, indicating that Yuan Huyuan had gone to great lengths to show the importance of this visit.

Li Yuexiang responded politely, and Yuan Huyuan's joy was evident as he eagerly approached, speaking in a low voice, "I had some connections with your father… It is a pity what happened to you…"

Li Yuexiang, accustomed to such comments, quickly shifted the topic and turned her attention to Yuan Fuyao. Yuan Huyuan immediately began introducing him, saying some flattering words. Just then, another figure arrived.

The newcomer was an elderly man with white hair, hurrying in. It was Li Xuanxuan, whose aged voice carried a trace of apology. "I deeply apologize, Senior. All the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the family are currently in seclusion. Qinghong has gone to the Eastern Sea, so only a Qi Cultivator like me was available to greet you."

Yuan Huyuan waved his hand dismissively and replied, "It is no bother at all! With someone of your stature coming to receive me, it is already a great honor. Why should there be any formality between our two families?"

Their conversation was warm and friendly, full of mutual politeness, leaving Li Yuexiang and Yuan Fuyao awkwardly standing to the side. Seeing this, Li Xicheng smiled and said, "Yuexiang, why not take the young master to enjoy the lake scenery?"

The two left together, and only then did Yuan Huyuan's smile fade, his expression turning serious as he said, "Are you aware of the current state of my family?"

Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment before answering, "I know a bit."

Yuan Huyuan deliberated for a moment, his voice lowering as he said, "Now… if both Chengdun and the others do not return, the future will be hard to predict. Fuyao is Chengdun's only son. I can only entrust him to your family's care."

"This was something Chengdun arranged with you earlier…"

Yuan Huyuan's expression became increasingly strained. His aged face twitched slightly, and he finally said, "I have come here today, swallowing my pride, to ask if your family can spare a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to assist us…"

Li Xuanxuan was stunned, momentarily at a loss for words.

Thanks to Li Xizhi's earlier reminder, he already understood that the Yuan Family was in chaos, unsure of how deeply involved they were with Azure Pond Sect's plans. He had no intention of getting entangled.

While offering protection to Yuan Chengdun's descendants was a minor matter that wouldn't pose significant risks, actively intervening was an entirely different issue.

Being a cautious individual by nature, Li Xuanxuan only wanted to protect the family's prodigy for a few more years. The difficulty of the situation was clearly written on his face. Seeing this, Yuan Huyuan lowered his voice further and said, "I understand the trouble with Yuanjiao's situation and that your family is facing turbulent times… but as for my family…"

Yuan Huyuan understood his family's precarious situation all too well. Yet, as an elder, he desperately clung to the hope of salvaging what remained, unwilling to give up. Having exhausted every possible connection, he could only turn to the Li Family for help.

Li Xuanxuan sighed inwardly and decided to hint at his position. "Senior! This rain has lasted far too long!"

The words hit Yuan Huyuan like a bolt of lightning. He stepped back, realizing the Li Family was well aware of the Yuan Family's current state: the death of their ancestor Yuan Licheng, the disappearance of their backer Buzi, and their transformation into a pawn of Azure Pond Sect in their maneuvering against Yue Cultivating Sect. The risks were too great for the Li Family to intervene. With a bitter smile, he replied, "Very well… I can only entrust Fuyao to your care."

Li Xuanxuan offered some comfort. "Your family has deep roots. You will weather this storm."

Yuan Huyuan remained silent. Being at the eye of the storm left him little to say. He cupped his fist and took his leave.

Meanwhile, Li Yuexiang excused herself from the gathering. Yuan Fuyao walked alongside her as they exited the hall and sighed, "Watching them trade polite pleasantries feels so meaningless!"

Li Yuexiang lowered her gaze, blinking slightly, and responded, "Our two families have had a long-standing alliance. Naturally, there is much to discuss."

Yuan Fuyao nodded quickly, adopting an agreeable stance.

In truth, Yuan Fuyao had not been in a good mood during the journey. He was strongly opposed to the idea of an arranged marriage. However, Yuan Huyuan's authority was absolute, leaving him with no room to argue, and he begrudgingly accompanied the elder.

Along the way, he calculated ways to extricate himself. After all, the marriage had not been finalized yet. If he could find some excuse—such as incompatible personalities—it might still be possible to withdraw.

But as soon as he laid eyes on Li Yuexiang, he was utterly captivated. Her beauty was otherworldly, and all his grievances vanished like smoke. He stared at her, nodding repeatedly, his earlier thoughts entirely forgotten. He silently marveled, What a stunning woman! Such beauty is rare, even among cultivators!

Li Yuexiang appeared unaware of his admiration. She guided him across the lake, making casual conversation. Suddenly, Yuan Fuyao noticed the large dam spanning the lake and asked with some curiosity, "What is this for? Raising spirit fish?"

Li Yuexiang answered gently, "It is to block the lake water and protect the people."

Yuan Fuyao sighed repeatedly and said, "My family is far behind yours in this regard. With this endless rain, I have suggested several times to my family that we send cultivators to help manage things in the plains. But they always dismiss it as a waste of manpower."

It turned out that Yuan Fuyao, under Yuan Chengdun's arrangement, had been managing towns and commoners in Mushroom Forest Plain. With this opening, he began discussing matters of governance in detail—how to regulate livelihoods, manage the populace, and ensure their welfare. His insights were surprisingly profound.

Hearing this, Li Yuexiang nodded internally, though her expression remained calm and pleasant. She responded with a soft smile, "Cultivators may not fear the rain, but the people by the lake suffer greatly."

Yuan Fuyao had a moment of realization and, while his face betrayed no change, he thought, The Li Family's reputation for caring for its people is well-deserved.

Li Yuexiang had little interest in discussing such topics further. She redirected the conversation to inquire about recent news. Yuan Fuyao enthusiastically shared various tales and observations, speaking at length about distant lands and scattered events. Li Yuexiang listened politely without much engagement.

Suddenly, he asked, "Did my father leave any message or item for me when he visited your family?"

Li Yuexiang narrowed her eyes slightly, thinking to herself, It seems Yuan Chengdun went straight to the Eastern Sea without leaving any instructions for his family…

Without any intention of keeping the betrothal gifts for herself, she replied softly, "He did leave a betrothal gift. It is in the central hall. You may ask Senior Huyuan about it."

She hadn't expected that her words would cause Yuan Fuyao, who had been reserved and deferential, to suddenly straighten his back and lift his chin slightly. Confidence seemed to fill him, and he responded with a simple "Hmm."

The two chatted a while longer until Yuan Huyuan emerged from the hall, accompanied by a retinue. He addressed Yuan Fuyao, saying, "You will stay here to cultivate for now. For any matters, consult Yuexiang."

Yuan Fuyao seemed a bit caught off guard and could only nod blankly. Yuan Huyuan gave a polite smile to Li Yuexiang and then flew away on the wind.

Yuan Fuyao's cave dwelling had already been prepared. Li Yuexiang escorted him and his attendants there and quickly took her leave. Once inside, Yuan Fuyao instructed his attendants to inspect the dwelling, then sat down to drink tea.

On his left, one of his trusted aides asked, "Young Master, what do you think of the Li Family's young lady?"

Yuan Fuyao paused for a moment before praising, "She is truly a beauty, but she is also full of schemes."

The aide leaned in and asked quietly, "Full of schemes…?"

Yuan Fuyao nodded with some difficulty and said, "I have heard that she has an older brother cultivating within the sect who has already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. If I marry her, I am afraid my branch will only end up obeying the Li Family's commands."

The aides exchanged glances, unsure how to respond. They dared not speak ill of the woman from the Li Family. If she were to truly become their mistress and inquire into such matters, the consequences would not be light. Suddenly, Yuan Fuyao spoke again in a low voice, "Go and find out how much my father prepared for the Li Family. See if there is any way to reclaim it."

The aide quickly excused himself, while Yuan Fuyao remained seated, pondering silently. "I need to find a way to retrieve those resources. I cannot keep living under the Li Family's shadow, with everything falling into their hands."

————

Meanwhile, Li Yuexiang had returned. Li Xuanxuan soon came to find her, having just finished receiving updates. He hurried over, determined to assess matters for his granddaughter. Upon seeing Li Yuexiang enter, he quickly asked, "How was it?"

Li Yuexiang waved her hand dismissively and, seeing that her grandfather didn't appear overly concerned, replied, "This Yuan Fuyao seems to understand the needs of the common people. Beyond that, he is rather glib and seems to possess a bit of cleverness. His personality, however, leans toward mediocrity and greed. That said, his actions appear to remain within the bounds of propriety. Whether it is genuine or merely a façade, I will need to observe him further."

"What?!" Li Xuanxuan was taken aback and blurted, "How can he be like that! Are you sure you have judged him correctly?"

Li Yuexiang, relying on her own observations, began to feel slightly uncertain under her grandfather's questioning. She responded hesitantly, "I have not met too many people while on the mountain, so perhaps my assessment is not entirely accurate. It is just unfortunate that my brother is in seclusion…"

Li Xuanxuan waved his hand dismissively and said, "That makes it easier. I will have Li Chengliao and the others test him. There is no need for you to deal with this yourself."




# Chapter 641: Brother Jiao

Li Qinghong cultivated on the island for a while. With the Eastern Sea's Falling Water Rising Storm, her progress in cultivation was extraordinarily rapid—one day of cultivation here was worth three days elsewhere. She became so immersed in her swift growth in power that she lost track of time.

It wasn't until the formation array of her cave dwelling began to hum and vibrate that she slowly awoke from her meditation. Exhaling a breath of violet lightning, she glanced outside and noticed that someone had come to visit. Awakened so abruptly by the array, she felt a bit surprised.

"How strange," she murmured.

Leaving the cave, she saw Zong Yan waiting by the formation boundary. It appeared he had activated the array. Bowing deeply, he reported, "My Grace, a cultivator from an immortal sect has arrived. He is dressed in feathered robes and claims to be Li Xizhi from the north."

Zong Yan had never met Li Xizhi, so he simply described the visitor's appearance. Hearing this, Li Qinghong immediately stood up, a hint of urgency in her voice as she asked, "If it is Zhi'er who has come, why did not you invite him in?"

Zong Yan bowed again and explained, "I did invite him, but the young master refused to believe me and insisted on seeing you in person before entering."

Li Qinghong didn't mind the hesitation. She grabbed her spear, rose into the air, and left the formation. Outside, she saw a young man in feathered robes standing among the clouds, his multicolored light forming six radiant hues that shimmered beautifully.

"Auntie Qinghong!" he called out warmly.

The aunt and nephew greeted each other with enthusiasm, exchanging a few words to bridge the gap of years apart. Together, they descended from the sky. As Li Qinghong guided him down, Li Xizhi cast a thoughtful glance at someone nearby and asked, "Is this Monk Kongheng?"

"Indeed," she replied. "He is my household guest. Back in the marketplace, he even delivered a spirit fruit to you."

Li Qinghong introduced them. Kongheng lowered his head respectfully, but Li Xizhi scrutinized him carefully. Observing that there was no trace of demonic energy nor any strange auras behind his head, Li Xizhi courteously inquired, "Master Monk, to which lineage do you belong?"

Kongheng replied, "The Liao River Temple of Yan State... from the Liao River Dao lineage."

Li Xizhi raised an eyebrow, a faint smile playing on his lips as he asked further, "Among the Seven Dao of Yan State, the territory belongs to the Pure Joy of Compassion and Abhidharma Temple. Which branch are you from?"

Kongheng looked surprised but answered calmly, "You are well-informed, Benefactor. However, the Liao River predates the Seven Dao and does not belong to any of them."

"Oh, so you are from the ancient lineages," Li Xizhi said, visibly relaxing. "I see. Forgive my presumptions."

Though he seemed to have eased his suspicions, Li Xizhi avoided further questions and surveyed their surroundings. Li Qinghong laughed and said, "It is good that you have come. I captured a Foundation Establishment Realm demonic beast. You can accompany me back home."

Understanding her intent, Li Xizhi made a quick calculation of time and replied, "I just returned from Green Pine Island. Although everything there has been arranged, I cannot stay away for too long. If we are heading home, we must leave immediately."

True to her straightforward nature, Li Qinghong promptly stored her spear and stepped into the central pool of the island. With a firm grip, she hoisted up half a figure—it was the haggard remnant of an old man with a hooked nose. Bound tightly in iron chains, he appeared dazed and insensible.

"Let us go!" she said decisively.

The two departed the formation. After a brief hesitation, Li Xizhi remarked, "If the family has placed their trust in him, I will say no more. As long as it is certain that he is an ancient cultivator, he can still be relied upon."

Li Qinghong nodded and, recalling their earlier exchange, asked, "The Seven Dao of northern Buddhist cultivators—what sort of Dao lineages are they?"

Shaking his head, Li Xizhi explained, "It is very complicated. Buddhist cultivators' doctrines differ greatly, with some even diverging as far as Purple Mansion Dao and shamanic talismans."

"Take Wrathful Purification of the World for example," he continued. "Then there is the Murong Clan's Pure Joy of Compassion, which our family has encountered before. Add to that the Abhidharma Temple, which teaches the belief that all is illusion except for a singular essence, and the Great Mahayana Dharma Realm, which claims that the present world is the Pure Land. Their conflicts are intense."

At this point, a look of puzzlement crossed his face as he added, "To these Buddhist cultivators, internal rivalries often seem more pressing than any southern expeditions."

Li Xizhi shared some intelligence he had learned within the sect before switching topics to Green Pine Island. With a sigh, he said, "Green Pine Island is currently caught up in a scramble for resources. Many Heavy Abyssal Gale have descended there, likely leaking from the grotto heaven. When I arrived, everyone was arguing over how to divide these treasures."

The two conversed about recent events, exchanging insights into their respective lives. Li Xizhi gained a deeper understanding of family matters, while Li Qinghong also benefited from the discussion. Together, they rode the wind toward Yue State, where the northern rain continued to drizzle relentlessly.

Li Xizhi took a long, thoughtful look at the scene and murmured, "The sect's explanation is that this rain is caused by Falling Water Rising Storm in the overseas regions. There may be some truth to it."

Li Qinghong, having personally witnessed the True Monarchs of the Yue Cultivating Sect intervene and isolate the celestial phenomena offshore, felt clear-headed about the matter. However, it was not something she could openly discuss with her nephew. She thought to herself, A convenient excuse!
𝑓𝘳𝘦𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝘯ℴ𝘷𝘦𝓁.𝑐𝑜𝑚

————

At Qingdu Peak.

Li Chengliao had been busy for months with family affairs and barely had time to check on the family's auspicious child. The constant dampness caused by the rains had turned life into a living nightmare, leaving him and others frustrated beyond words.

Years of soaking rain had ruined the soil—black soil turned to yellow, and yellow turned to white. Forests rotted in large patches, and cliffs transformed into small lakes filled with black poison, utterly devoid of vitality.

Not to mention, wooden beams had rotted and collapsed in large swathes, leaving entire areas in ruins. The commoners, accustomed to traveling through these regions for years, found their legs and feet festering and rotting away from the damp conditions. Though the Li Family had spent several consecutive years draining the floodwaters and managed to maintain relative peace within their domain, the chaos beyond their borders was unmistakable. Every day, one could see corpses drifting downstream along the river.

Li Chengliao observed the land for a long while. The Mushroom Forest Plain had completely transformed into a swamp, with catastrophic casualties.

The Azure Pond Sect had sent no aid. Perhaps, to them, this flood was no different from past droughts or conflicts—just another disaster that would claim lives but eventually recover within decades. Pressuring the Yue Cultivating Sect seemed to be the only priority.

"The Yue Cultivating Sect remains unmoved, and the Yuan Family continues to suffer..." Rising into the air, he surveyed the town from above. As he watched, a few figures flew toward him from the horizon.

The Jade Court Guards beside him quickly formed a protective formation. Li Chengliao looked closer and noticed the distinctive attire of the Xiao Family. Seeing that these people were heading straight for him, he kept his composure and prepared to respond.

At the forefront was a woman dressed in white. She appeared to be in her mid-thirties and exuded a dignified presence. With a cultivation level of a mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm, her face seemed somewhat familiar.

Behind her stood a young man clad in black, his expression stern. Though he looked to be under thirty, his cultivation level had already reached the early stage of Qi Cultivation Realm. Li Chengliao recognized him immediately as Xiao Muyun, the heir of the Xiao Family's Mount Yu branch, who had paid respects when Li Yuanping passed away.

The group halted nearby. The woman stepped forward alone and asked, "I am Li Qingxiao of Mount Yu. May I ask which family member currently oversees the household?"

Li Chengliao stared for a moment, stunned, before he replied, "Greetings, Grandaunt."

This woman was indeed Li Jingtian and Chen Donghe's daughter, Li Qingxiao. Li Chengliao had seen her return once in his childhood, but it had been so long that his memory of her had faded. Now, as the head of Mount Yu under the Xiao Family, she carried herself with natural authority.

Li Chengliao led her into the mountain. However, as they descended onto Mount Qingdu, Li Qingxiao's eyes showed a hint of confusion. Looking around, she said in a strained voice, "It has been many years... The household has completely changed."

She walked a few steps along the stone path before the air crackled with the sound of thunder. A bolt of purple lightning fell from the sky, revealing a woman clad in jade armor and white boots. With a long spear in hand, she landed with the tip pointed to the ground. Her almond-shaped eyes were wide with astonishment as she cried out, "Little sister!"

Li Qingxiao quickly looked up, her hair ornaments jingling softly. The two pairs of eyes, faintly similar, met. Li Qingxiao's gaze carried a hint of complexity as she said gently, "Decades have passed, yet elder sister has not changed at all."

Li Qinghong lowered her gaze and remained silent. The Li Qingxiao before her was nothing like the girl in her memories. Instead, she now resembled their late mother, Madam Dou, with an air of power and prestige.

Descending swiftly, Li Qinghong grasped her younger sister's hand. Li Qingxiao glanced at the purple lightning surrounding her elder sister, her eyes filled with admiration as she said, "Congratulations, elder sister, on achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm."

Li Xizhi, carrying the subdued demon, gave Li Chengliao a meaningful look. The group quickly dispersed, leaving the two sisters to walk alone in the mountains. Li Qinghong, being slightly taller, walked ahead, while Li Qingxiao looked up at her. Both seemed at a loss for words, and silence hung heavily between them.

They didn't speak much, yet the absence of their childhood camaraderie in the mountain air was palpable. Each had walked their own path so far that it seemed they had little left to say.

Li Qingxiao finally broke the silence, "While I was in seclusion recently, I missed some news..."

She hesitated for a moment, then said with sadness, "Both of our elder brothers have passed, leaving just us two sisters."

This struck a chord deep within Li Qinghong. Growing up with her sister, she had envisioned many futures—some solemn, some peaceful—but she had always assumed she would die pursuing the Dao. Never had she imagined it would be just the two of them left.

Li Qinghong was about to speak when the formation outside lit up again, and a hoarse voice called out, "Liu Changdie... requests an audience!"

Li Qinghong sighed softly. Seeing someone go out to receive the guest, she remained still but calculated quietly. It seemed all of Li Yuanjiao's remaining friends and kin had now come. She said gently to her sister, "Let me take you to visit our elder brother's resting place. Let this come to an end..."

The two sisters headed toward the tomb. Outside the formation, Liu Changdie was greeted personally by Li Xuanxuan. Liu Changdie looked distraught, standing dazed in the rain, his face full of disbelief.

Li Xuanxuan called to him several times, noting that Liu Changdie's cultivation had surprisingly reached the Foundation Establishment Realm—an impressive feat. But Liu Changdie remained motionless, and after several breaths, he finally stammered, "Senior, please do not deceive me. Is Yuanjiao really dead, or is he faking it?"

"What kind of talk is that..." Li Xuanxuan's expression left no doubt.

Liu Changdie's heart felt like it was collapsing under a landslide. Hot tears streamed down his face as he muttered, grief-stricken and disoriented, "How could this be..."

More words swirled chaotically in his mind, words he dared not say aloud, How is this possible! Since my rebirth, everything has changed so much... there has been no siege by Master Monks, Li Qinghong hasn't sacrificed herself, Senior Tongya even decapitated a Maha, Li Xuanfeng is renowned in the southern borders, and Li Xuanxuan hasn't descended into madness. Yet... yet I somehow caused Brother Jiao's death!

How could this happen! Liu Changdie staggered forward, unable to hear Li Xuanxuan's words beside him. His thoughts were a storm of contradictions, Is this better or worse? Yes, the Li Family has prospered, but Brother Jiao entered a grotto heaven only to lose his life. I... I've disrupted everything. I caused his death!

Bitterness and guilt consumed him. Since his rebirth, he had been consumed by the pursuit of spirit treasures and power. Each step forward brought a new wave of fear as he discovered the world's conspiracies and machinations.

And in all his efforts, he had lost the closest friend of his past life, even feeling responsible for his demise. Liu Changdie's head swam, and he fell to his knees before the gravestone, weeping softly.

The Li Family members present couldn't understand his profound sorrow and exchanged puzzled glances. Liu Changdie's grief was so raw and heartfelt that even Li Xuanxuan began to suspect, Could it be... that Yuanjiao and this man were truly close in life?

Liu Changdie, consumed by grief, was also overcome with a creeping dread. In his past life, he had been naive and ignorant, always relying on this old friend's guidance. Yuanjiao had always arranged his affairs flawlessly, and Liu Changdie owed him countless unrepaid kindnesses.

Now, with foreknowledge and the advantage of rebirth, Liu Changdie had never sought Yuanjiao's advice, never spoken to him at length. Yet Yuanjiao had still met a premature death. As the years wore on, the advantages of his rebirth diminished, and the weight of his ignorance in his previous life became clearer. His regret grew heavier with every passing moment.

He cried for a long time, until even Li Xuanxuan, unable to bear it, stepped forward to comfort him. Liu Changdie finally stood, his face streaked with tears, and choked out, "Brother Jiao!"

𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎

Yuan Fuyao had stayed at the Li Family estate for several months, dispatching his people to inquire about the dowry arrangements, only for them to return with blank faces and no answers.

His men first approached the Jade Court Guards. They intercepted one in the street, pulling him into an empty alley under the pretext of delivering a message, while attempting to slip something into his hand.

However, the Jade Court Guard, skeptical but curious, followed them into the alley. When the bribe of spirit stones was pressed into his hand, he reacted as if he had touched a burning coal, leaping backward in alarm and scattering the stones onto the ground with a loud clatter.

"I have done nothing to offend Young Master Fuyao! Why are you trying to implicate me?" the guard shouted.

The two Yuan Family men were unceremoniously chased out of the alley, stumbling and bewildered. Frustrated, they blamed their bad luck for running into such a fool and decided to seek out two Li Family soldiers instead.

Logic dictated that common soldiers would have no insight into something as significant as the dowry, but they thought at least these soldiers could serve as informants. To their dismay, the two soldiers ended up red-faced and on the verge of coming to blows with each other during their questioning.

The Yuan Family men returned in utter disarray. Yuan Fuyao, having failed in his attempts to bribe the Li Family servants himself, sat in a daze. He had been met with polite but firm refusals, his gestures of goodwill rebuffed at every turn.

"This Li Family... how strict and unyielding they are! Their laws are harsh, and even the military and civilians alike are fearful of stepping out of line!" he muttered, his face darkening with regret.

Turning to his attendants, he said with frustration, "Now that the bribes have failed, they will undoubtedly use this incident to curry favor with the Li Family and make me look foolish!"

The attendants exchanged uneasy glances, silently lamenting, The ancestor warned you repeatedly to maintain a humble demeanor—now look at the mess you've made!

Yuan Fuyao, as if sitting on pins and needles, noticed the confusion on his attendants' faces. He bit his lip and said through gritted teeth, "What would you know? My father only told me to follow orders, but I am not entirely clueless. Trouble is brewing in our family! I must find out how this dowry was arranged and where it is headed. Only then will I have a bargaining chip—whether to retreat or to stay, I need a path forward."

Yuan Fuyao continued, "If I truly marry into the Li Family, I will lose both my freedom and my support. No one will bother to look out for me! And if something happens to our family, I will be cast aside like a discarded pawn."

Hearing this, the two attendants were convinced by the reasoning and softened their attitudes, now trying to come up with ideas. Yuan Fuyao, still restless, added anxiously, "My father kept such a major matter from me and did not even tell me the details of the dowry arrangements before heading off to the Eastern Sea. What is his plan?"

One of the attendants, uncertain of how to console him, could only reply cautiously, "The ancestor likely has his reasons for such arrangements."




# Chapter 647: Rainbow Pierce Skyway

Li Xizhi waited at the altar for a while. Among the crowd, only he had received the talisman seed but had yet to accept a talisman qi. As expected, a brilliant light soon rose from the Shenyang Mansion.

"Rainbow Pierce Skyway." His aura surged instantly, and his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation level rapidly advanced. The rainbow light radiating from his body grew brighter, giving him an ethereal and immortal appearance.

However, the gaps between the stages of the Foundation Establishment Realm were vast. While such an increase in cultivation might have elevated someone several levels within the Qi Cultivation Realm, it merely brought him to the edge of breaking through to mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. He stopped just short of the threshold.

Li Xizhi closed his eyes, muttering softly. When he exhaled, a plume of rainbow light dispersed. As he opened his eyes, the swirling rainbow hues within them slowly faded away.

Glancing at the crowd's awestruck gazes, he chuckled and said, "Just one step away from a breakthrough! It is actually a good thing—not rushing through this stage will avoid drawing suspicion. This way, I can refine my cultivation and practice spells during my trip to the Eastern Sea, before seizing the opportunity to break through."

After revealing his cultivation level, Li Xizhi explained the effects of the talisman qi he had received. Feeling inspired, he exercised his mana, causing rainbow light to dance across his fingertips. With a few hand seals, his middle and ring fingers curled into his palm while the rest pointed outward, forming a tripod-like shape.

In an instant, the spiritual energy flowing across the mountain ceased and froze in midair. After a brief pause, it rushed toward his hands in a concentrated surge, colliding and transforming into streams of white qi.

"Quite an improvement!" Li Xizhi praised himself as Li Ximing, standing nearby, gazed at him with bright eyes.

Li Ximing exclaimed, "Elder brother truly had foresight! Receiving the blessing at the Foundation Establishment Realm is indeed more beneficial. The rest of the family can follow your example in the future."

Li Xizhi smiled and replied, "Ximing, you are exaggerating. I can afford to take my time cultivating within the sect, but you all must focus on forming your Immortal Foundations quickly to support the family and secure greater benefits. You cannot afford to wait until Foundation Establishment Realm."

Shifting to a more serious tone, he said, "I have seen Zhouwei."

Concerned about how the family might handle things, Li Xizhi repeated the instructions he had given to Li Chengliao earlier. He warned gravely, "In ancient times, directly calling someone by their name was taboo, which is why Daoist titles exist. Once he begins cultivating at six, the family must give him a Daoist title, preferably related to Bright Yang, as it would be most beneficial to him."

He continued, "I am not only heading to the sect to find perception techniques to conceal his unique eyes. I will also take on additional assignments and build connections, exchanging for more Bright Yang techniques derived from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven for his protection and cultivation."

Li Xuanxuan adjusted his sleeves and spoke with some discomfort, "Kid... there is no need to burden yourself like this. Focus on your own cultivation. These things should not fall to you. Yu Muxian cultivated for years and exhausted almost all of the Yu family's wealth, but you have never once asked for anything from the family all these years. Your father and I only worried you might face hardships in the sect..."

Li Xizhi waved his hand dismissively, his expression resolute. "Grandfather, please do not treat me like a guest. Back when the family sought Dawn Colored Qi for me, I am sure you were not thinking about these details. Overthinking distinctions like these would make things meaningless!"

Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan could only nod. Li Xizhi, mindful of the time he had already spent away from Green Pine Island, dared not linger further. He spoke softly, "Time is pressing. I will return overseas immediately. Should anything arise in the family, feel free to send me a message."

The family members escorted him out together. Having only recently grown closer to her brother, Li Yuexiang showed some reluctance to part. In a soft voice, she asked, "Brother, how long will it be before you return?"

Li Xizhi smiled and replied, "Several years at least. If you have the time, feel free to have someone escort you to Green Pine Island. Not only is it a great place for cultivation, but we siblings could also spend some quality time together."

Li Yuexiang nodded, her interest clearly piqued. With a hint of playfulness, she added, "Brother, while you are out, could you also find me a suitable husband?"

Taking her words to heart, Li Xizhi nodded solemnly and said, "Father is no longer here, and as the eldest brother, I stand in his place. I will ensure Xiang'er is never wronged."

With that, he cupped his fist in farewell to the group. A rainbow-colored radiance rose beneath his feet, and in a flash, he disappeared into the eastern horizon.

————

As soon as Li Xizhi departed, Li Qinghong returned, riding the wind back to the peak, her clothes dusty from the journey. She retrieved a jade bottle from her robe and displayed it, saying, "This spirit water is called Central Azure Pool, part of the Pristine Water system. It cost ninety-seven spirit stones."

Li Qinghong had taken one hundred spirit stones when she left and returned three. With the five types of spirit water now gathered, Li Xuanxuan hurried to summon Liu Changdie.

For the past few days, Liu Changdie had been surveying Mount Qingdu, analyzing the flow of the earth's veins and spiritual energy. He had initially thought it would take months, if not years, to gather the materials. Seeing how quickly the Li Family had secured the five types of spirit water, he was slightly surprised.

Taking the jade bottles in hand, he examined them, "Converging Water: Far-Sea Serpent Stream and Forest Cold Water, Valley Water: Stone-Heart Water, Mansion Water: White Feather No-Fall, and Pristine Water: Central Azure Pool."

Liu Changdie beamed with excitement and remarked, "This is quite the collection! You are only missing a Pit Water for the Five Virtues to be complete."

Noticing everyone's curious glances, he cupped his fist and explained, "You may not know, but the setup of this formation is quite particular. If all the spirit waters are of the same attribute, the formation's power is greatly enhanced. However, if the waters encompass the Five Virtues, the formation's effectiveness will be equally remarkable."

From his robe, Liu Changdie took out a jade bottle and said softly, "While traveling to train and cultivate the Spirit Eye Perception, which I acquired from your clan, I collected some Pure Essence Spirit Water. There are still two portions left, and this water belongs to the Pit Water system."

He swapped out the Far-Sea Serpent Stream from the Converging Water set, thus completing the Five Virtues collection. Seeing this, Li Xuanxuan's face lit up with delight as he said with a smile, "Many thanks, Master!"

Liu Changdie simply smiled without comment. He had previously traveled to the Eastern Sea, where he discovered a grotto heaven from his prior life and obtained a wealth of spirit resources. His storage pouch already contained various spirit waters covering the Five Virtues, which was why he had initially proposed the formation.

No matter which five types of spirit water the Li Family gathered, he already had a narrative prepared to justify his method. Receiving the spirit water, he handed over a registry and said, "I will begin setting up the formation immediately. These listed materials and soil must still be collected. I trust your clan can provide them."

Li Xuanxuan readily agreed, walking alongside Liu Changdie. Grasping his sleeve, he asked, "Master, that remaining portion of Pure Essence Spirit Water—does it still serve any purpose for you?"

Clearly, Li Xuanxuan wanted to purchase it for the younger generation of the Li Family to practice the Spirit Eye Perception. Liu Changdie understood immediately and chuckled, "If your clan desires it, I will gladly part with it."

Li Xuanxuan politely refused to take it freely, and the two descended the mountain while engaged in lively conversation. Though Liu Changdie had never met Li Xuanxuan in his previous life, he had become acquainted with him during his youth in this lifetime. Their shared stories about the past created a pleasant camaraderie.

On the mountain, the heavy rain gradually subsided, the storm clouds over the lake lightened, and faint glimpses of the sky emerged. At the horizon, a rosy dawn appeared, and a warm wind swept in from the north, dislodging the white mourning cloth hanging on the walls. The storm clouds finally dispersed, revealing the clear skies above.




# Chapter 648: Arrival of the Luan

Li Xizhi traveled swiftly to the Eastern Sea, riding the ocean currents for a time before arriving at Green Pine Island. The sea surrounding the island was in a constant state of turbulence, with exposed earth veins and erupting fire veins generating all kinds of spiritual qi.

On the island itself, many green pines had already collapsed. The area was divided into a dozen different zones, each guarded by disciples of various immortal gates. These zones had been adapted to suit different needs, harnessing various methods to collect spiritual qi.

He landed atop the peak, where a disciple in green robes sat cross-legged on the mountainside, seemingly waiting for some time. Seeing Li Xizhi arrive on a gust of wind, the disciple let out a sigh of relief and hurried forward with an anxious expression, saying, "Daoist, you are finally back! The sect has sent word that you need to escort a group to Splitreed Island and bring back some replacements. I have been searching everywhere for you!"

"Oh?" Li Xizhi had anticipated such tasks and had planned accordingly, knowing that he wouldn't miss any deadlines during his absence. He asked calmly, "When is the deadline? And where are these people?"

The disciple cupped his fist and replied, "There are still several months left. Now that you have returned, Daoist, I will make the necessary arrangements at once!"

The disciple left in haste, leaving Li Xizhi to shake his head slightly in puzzlement, thinking, The roster had been finalized long ago. Why the sudden change? Something about this is odd.

He waited quietly for a while until a cloudliner lifted off from the island. Taking flight, he surveyed the scene and noticed that the ship's passengers were mostly older Qi Cultivators, with a few Foundation Establishment Realm guest cultivators mixed in.

"Greetings, Daoist!" They saluted in unison. Li Xizhi waved dismissively, not wanting to waste time. He guided the cloudliner into the sky, only pausing over the ocean to observe more closely. He noted that, despite being reassigned from such a prosperous place, the cultivators showed little sign of dissatisfaction.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝙬𝙚𝓫𝒏𝓸𝓿𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝓶

Feigning casual interest, he remarked, "What matter is so urgent that it requires your immediate reassignment?"

A man behind him hesitated before answering, "Daoist, we have heard that Splitreed market's spirit veins have begun to shift, and there may be an earth dragon awakening. We are being sent to assist the warden there."

Li Xizhi nodded, "So, it is about that. You will only be gone briefly, then. I was concerned it might be a long-term stationing that would rob you of cultivation opportunities. This is not as bad, then."

"Thank you for your concern, Daoist!" The speaker was a Foundation Establishment Realm guest cultivator who expressed his gratitude profusely before shifting the conversation to spirit veins.

Li Xizhi responded with casual remarks that gave the man some enlightenment. Reflecting inwardly, he thought, Most likely, this is Ning Heyuan's doing. He's gone to great lengths to stage all this—impeccably crafted, I must admit.

Once he understood the setup, Li Xizhi's interest waned. Sensing this, the man wisely fell silent. Day turned to night, and soon they arrived at Splitreed Island.

Splitreed Island was a well-known major island near the sea, drawing awe from the cultivators on board. Though it was his first visit, Li Xizhi followed the guidance to dive underwater, eventually locating the massive formation on the seafloor.

Just as they settled, a middle-aged man stood waiting above the market. With late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation level, he stepped forward as the cloudliner approached, stopping before Li Xizhi. His voice was steady and deep, "Are you Daoist Li? I am Ning Heyuan."

Seeing him personally come to greet him, Li Xizhi felt more confident in his assumptions. He replied warmly, "I am Li Xizhi. Greetings, senior!"

"You have worked hard, Daoist." Ning Heyuan's expression softened into a smile. With a gesture to his subordinates, he had them escort the ship's cultivators away. Then, extending a hand, he said, "Please, this way."

As they descended together, Ning Heyuan's demeanor radiated newfound stability. The past decade had transformed him more than the decades he had spent overseeing the sea. His bearing had become broader and more composed.

Ning Heyuan had come to understand why, despite the Ning Family boasting numerous Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and having brothers more capable than himself, Yuan Su had entrusted him with the family. The reason was the same as why he had been exiled overseas for more than ten years—his close ties with the Chi Family and the trust he had earned from Sect Master Chi Zhiyun.

Breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm could take five or six years at best, decades at worst. If the Daoist Master falls, who knows how long my aunt will last—or even if she will succeed. Until then, it is safest to have me managing the family. Ning Heyuan understood that his aunt's breakthrough was fraught with peril.

If Daoist Master Yuan Su were to fall, the Ning Family's greatest fear would not be the retaliation from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators but rather the long-overdue reckoning from the Chi Family.

Once the Ning Family lost Yuan Su's protection, they would be no different from any ordinary clan. To survive, they had to secure the trust of the Chi Family. Appointing him—someone who was closely tied to Chi Zhiyun and who had been harshly punished for his association with the Chi Family—as the head of the Ning household was a wise decision by Yuan Su.

Ning Heyuan had once been sent to the southern border, only to be quickly reassigned to the harsh seas. It was only after much contemplation back at sea that he finally understood Yuan Su's deeper intentions.

Only then did he realize why, despite having been chosen as the head of the family, he was still relegated to such a desolate place, It's all to make Chi Zhiyun feel guilt... to make him feel indebted to me... to make him believe that I stand firmly on the same side as the Chi Family!

Having grown up by Chi Zhiyun's side, Ning Heyuan knew him well. Upon reflecting further, he couldn't deny that this plan of Yuan Su's was nothing short of brilliant.

This realization struck him with a wave of cold sweat, yet it dispelled all his resentment toward being stationed in such an inhospitable place. What replaced it was only admiration, and his demeanor took on a newfound composure and determination.

The two reached the interior of the cave dwelling and sat down. Ning Heyuan poured tea and watched as Li Xizhi made a motion to rise, unwilling to accept such courtesy. Ning Heyuan quickly pressed his hand lightly to stop him and said, "I went to great lengths to arrange this meeting, Fellow Daoist. Let us not concern ourselves with such formalities. Let us regard each other as equals."

Without giving Li Xizhi the chance to say more, Ning Heyuan swiftly shifted the topic, his tone turning serious, "This meeting is about the matter of Moongaze Lake!"

Li Xizhi understood and listened attentively, adopting a posture of focused attention. Ning Heyuan spoke softly, "First, we must ensure Yuanwu is removed, and that Yuanwu Peak relocates. We need to work together within the sect to ensure that six of the thirty-six peaks are selected to manage the new outpost. Securing Moongaze Lake under Qingsui's jurisdiction will make this plan mostly foolproof!"

Ning Heyuan continued hesitantly, "However, relying on my Ning Family alone may not be enough. Does your clan have any additional support?"

Li Xizhi nodded slightly, fully aware of this man's relationship with Li Xuanfeng. In a low voice, he replied, "With the Ning, Yang, and Li Encheng of Fuchen Peak, can this plan succeed?"

Li Xizhi had already considered this matter. In the initial planning stages, the Yuan Family was also a part of it. However, unforeseen circumstances arose, and the Yuan Family was now in disarray. Furthermore, his master had disappeared without a trace, leaving the Yuan Family's involvement uncertain for the time being.




# Chapter 653: Retribution

"Li Xuanfeng—" Situ Chen was not surprised, but instead filled with hatred as he spat out the name. Raising his twin blades, he charged forward, only to see the older man take one step forward and deliver a palm strike to his protective barrier.

Hm?" Situ Chen was momentarily stunned. A massive force surged forward, sending him and the barrier flying backward like a falling stone, crashing into the ocean's surface with an immense splash.

Before he could recover, he found himself sinking into the sea. Looking up, he saw five streaks of golden light hurtling toward him like shooting stars, growing larger and more menacing as they neared.

The five streaks of golden light struck the same spot on the barrier, one after the other, breaking the ancient talisman's limits. A series of sharp, cracking sounds followed.

Boom!

Pain erupted in Situ Chen's chest. The shield shattered completely, and a fist-sized wound opened between his chest and abdomen. The excruciating pain jolted him back to clarity, "He planned those five arrows long ago, just waiting for me to get here!"

It was too late to do anything. The golden streaks in the sky flashed continuously, denying him even the smallest opportunity to retaliate. His well-honed blade techniques and skills were rendered useless, as he could do nothing but watch the water around him turn red with his own blood.

Struggling to breathe, Situ Chen saw a figure materialize in front of him—a man bathed in golden light. It was Li Xuanfeng, his expression cold and merciless as he stared directly at him.

Driven by fear of death, Situ Chen pleaded desperately, "I have no quarrel with you, Fellow Daoist. Why are you doing this to me?"

Li Xuanfeng ignored him completely. Without answering, he struck Situ Chen's dantian with a single palm, rendering him powerless. Then, with a steely silence, he dragged Situ Chen to a nearby island and bound him to a tree.

Situ Chen was utterly baffled and terrified. He watched as Li Xuanfeng retrieved a short blade from his storage pouch, then began to slowly slice away a piece of flesh from his chest.

Situ Chen howled in agony. Blood dripped from the wound in small crimson beads, but no matter how much he screamed or questioned, Li Xuanfeng's expression remained unchanged. He methodically stripped away the flesh until only the stark white of bone remained, scraping the ribs clean with a ghastly grinding sound, leaving only the rhythmically beating heart visible.

Finally, Li Xuanfeng spoke, "You still do not understand? Situ Mo also wants you dead. If I was not worried about dragging this out and causing complications, you would not have died this easily."

Situ Chen's eyes widened in shock, but before he could process the words, Li Xuanfeng worked quickly. He severed all four of Situ Chen's limbs before finally decapitating him in one clean motion. The severed head rolled across the ground a few times before coming to a halt.

Standing silently on the island, Li Xuanfeng gazed out as volcanic activity rumbled beneath the ocean. The surging heat, stirred by Situ Chen's Immortal Foundation, caused fiery eruptions to break the surface. Calmly, he cleaned up the remains and wiped the blood from his hands, muttering softly, "Xu San, your vengeance is settled. My blade techniques surpass ordinary mortals—his pain was likely beyond compare."

Squinting slightly, Li Xuanfeng seemed dissatisfied. The act of revenge had not granted him peace, but instead deepened his unease. With a flick of his left hand, a tattered piece of armor floated into the air, accompanied by a small storage pouch made of black-red fabric, glowing faintly.

Hovering beside him, a single golden arrow pulsed with spirituality, darting back and forth through the air like a living creature.

Li Xuanfeng examined the arrow. He had crafted three new arrows, bringing his total to eight. This particular arrow, smaller than the rest, had been refined by Merging Fire and the Binding Ring. Its intricate carvings and nimble movements made it exceptionally unique.

He casually retrieved the storage pouch and pulled out a jade talisman given to him by Yuan Su. Attaching the pouch to the talisman to obscure its origin, he sighed lightly, before stepping onto the wind and flying toward the northern horizon.

————

Mount Qingdu.

The scorching sun hung high in the sky. Today's duel between the two sects seemed to favor Yue Cultivating Sect, with its radiant sunlight bathing the mountain in golden hues. Li Yuexiang raised her head, silently staring at the glaring sun above, her face pale, and her lips pressed tightly together.

Her mother had been in seclusion for some time now, and the jade pendant Li Yuexiang had been carrying with her had grown dimmer by the day. She noticed this but found herself powerless to change anything.

The success or failure of Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough often hinged on a single moment of distraction. Rarely did someone's life force wane gradually like this. The Li Family's foundation was now steadily growing stronger, and Li Yuexiang knew exactly why this was happening.

"Mother cultivates the Clear Dusk Rain, which belongs to the Pristine Water system. The celestial phenomenon during her breakthrough originally aligned with her Dao foundation. But the Dry Fire unleashed by Yue Cultivating Sect directly disrupted it, throwing her spiritual energy into chaos." Li Yuexiang sighed.

If the scorching sun had been sustained, it might not have been as dire. But the sects' back-and-forth power struggle alternated between rain and sun, even affecting Li Xijun atop Mount Yuting. The brightness of the jade pendant fluctuated, and Xiao Guiluan's condition worsened day by day, her life force steadily dwindling.

Li Yuexiang could only watch as the jade pendant in her hands grew dimmer each day. Kneeling before the entrance to the cave dwelling, she felt utterly helpless. When Yue Cultivating Sect gained the upper hand today, and the sun blazed uninterrupted for fourteen hours, the jade pendant finally shattered into powder.

Her pale, jade-like hands cradled the fragments of the pendant, her expression distant and dazed. She kneeled silently on the smooth stone ground, gazing up at the fading sun in the sky, as streaks of green wind and rain began to drift down.

"Mother..." Li Yuexiang didn't even know what expression to wear, nor how to process her mother's death. She silently stood up and approached the stone door before her. After fumbling lightly across its surface, she gently pushed it open.

Creak... creak...

Wisps of pale green mist seeped out through the crack in the door, extinguishing the last bit of hope in Li Yuexiang's heart. The sight confirmed her worst fears—this was no sudden event. Her mother's body had clearly been dissolving for some time.

"Mother..." Li Yuexiang quietly stepped inside the cave dwelling. At its center lay a jade bed, now empty save for a few pieces of emerald-green spirit stone resembling ice, from which faint wisps of pale green mist rose. She struggled to form a seal to contain the stones, leaving the jade bed holding nothing but a single empty black robe.

She vaguely remembered that her mother disliked black. But her father had liked it.

Li Yuexiang felt surprisingly calm. She collected the storage pouch on the table, finding little else. Xiao Guiluan had failed in her breakthrough, so there were hardly any spirit treasures left behind.

After scanning the eerily clean cave dwelling, she finally spotted a wooden talisman about two fingers wide lying on the ground. It was strung with a red cord and adorned with jade beads, as though it had fallen from her mother's person.

Li Yuexiang bent down to pick it up. It was indeed an ordinary wooden talisman, a palm's length long and two fingers wide. On the side facing her, four words had been carved in sharp, decisive strokes, brimming with vitality—Fortunate to meet you.

She gently flipped it over. On the reverse side, the handwriting was delicate, flowing, and feminine, clearly Xiao Guiluan's. It carried a tender grace and read—I have been waiting.[1]

Beyond this, the talisman appeared to be an ordinary piece of wood. It seemed more like a memento exchanged during an intimate moment between husband and wife, something Xiao Guiluan had cherished and kept with her always.

Li Yuexiang pressed it against her chest and carefully stowed it away. She retrieved a jade box to store the emerald-green spirit stones and walked out of the cave dwelling alone. Outside, the sun was still blinding, its searing heat making the trees release faint wisps of smoke.

1. These were the four words that Li Yuanjiao and Xiao Guiluan exchanged during their first meeting on their wedding day in Chapter 290. ☜




# Chapter 655: Radiant Essence Scripture

Perplexed but obedient, Li Zhouwei lowered his head. As he kneeled, the voices of Li Xuanxuan and Li Qinghong echoed in unison—one hoarse and weathered, the other resonant and firm—reverberating throughout the chamber, "The Li Family of Qingdu offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion. We respectfully request the talisman for our descendant. He will dedicate his life to pursuing the Dao and his destiny rests in your hands… When the time comes, he will remain true to their oath. With this talisman burned, we express our gratitude to Supreme Yin."

Their voices reverberated in the chamber, causing a slight tremor in the air. Li Zhouwei widened his eyes in shock at the power of the words. Before he could grasp their full meaning, he looked up and saw a brilliant white light emanating from the stone platform.

The light grew increasingly intense, as if something were struggling to emerge from the void within. Its radiance was dazzling and interspersed with faint traces of an abyssal darkness.

He stared blankly for a moment, as a faint scent of osmanthus wafted to his nose. Li Xuanxuan and Li Qinghong exchanged glances, just beginning to show hints of joy, when a muffled groan escaped from Li Zhouwei beside them.

"Ugh..." He abruptly covered his eyes, trembling tears streaming down from the corners. His muffled groans of pain echoed in the quiet chamber.

Li Qinghong's sharp instincts kicked in as she immediately realized, This child's eyes are unlike ordinary people! To directly gaze upon such an immortal object, he is naturally affected!

Without hesitation, she patted his back gently and spoke in a soothing tone, "Calm your mind and focus. Recall the incantation, and guide the talisman seed."

Li Zhouwei felt a light tremor in his sea of qi, and a white radiance emerged from within—a small, radiant white orb. Quickly, he sat cross-legged and began chanting the mantra, carefully guiding the talisman seed.

Li Xuanxuan exhaled a sigh of relief. He and Li Qinghong stepped out of the chamber, smiles spreading across their faces. In a low voice, he said, "Although we suspected this child would accept the talisman seed, seeing it truly take hold is a great relief."

"It was not easy." Li Qinghong remarked, "How long has it been since someone in the family received a talisman? Ximing barely has two offspring, and who knows if they even have spiritual orifices. Xijun insists on being solitary... No one among Cheng and Ming generation was favored by fortune..."

"Thankfully, we have Zhouwei..." Li Xuanxuan sighed deeply, his spirits visibly lifted. Just as Li Qinghong was about to reply, her expression shifted, a mix of surprise and delight lighting up her face as she turned toward the northern mountain range.

Though not at the Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Xuanxuan immediately noticed her gaze and followed it. In the distance, faint traces of drifting snow and roaring northern winds became visible. He broke into a broad smile and exclaimed, "It is Yuting Peak!"

The summit of Yuting Peak was blanketed in pristine snow, with gusts of pine-laden wind sweeping across it. Li Qinghong stepped onto a streak of lightning and soared ahead. As she neared the mountain, she saw that the snowfall was relentless despite the otherwise cloudless skies. Snow poured steadily over the mountain, blanketing everything in sight.

At the same time, the northern wind raged, shaking every pine tree on the mountain and sending waves of snow cascading down. From the peak rose a pure white streak of light, carrying with it the frigid chill of pine and snow. It was a figure clad in white robes, a sword slung across his back.

"Aunt!" Li Xijun appeared even younger than he had before his seclusion. Effortlessly stepping across the snow, his spirit sword Hanlin hummed joyfully behind him, reflecting the excitement in his sharp, lifted brows.

"Good lad." Li Qinghong pursed her lips into a smile without speaking, while Li Xuanxuan burst into hearty laughter as he hurried to greet him. Of all the children in the Xi and Yue generation, Li Xijun had always been the closest to him. His joy at the reunion was heartfelt as he clasped the young man's hands, his grin stretching ear to ear.

Li Xijun, exuding an ethereal chill that set him apart, smoothed his white robes and said,

"I did not disappoint the elders' expectations. I have established my Dao Foundation, Snow on Pine. It enables me to tread upon snow, command frigid winds, amplify my sword light, enhance spell power, extend longevity, and mitigate injuries..."

As they walked downhill, he elaborated politely on the nature of his Immortal Foundation, "With this foundation, I can tread upon snow and harness cold winds, a potent advantage against Qi Cultivators. It can dispel opposing wind-based spells and enhance both techniques and sword light with frost and gusts, making it an immortal foundation well-suited for combat."

"Not only does this immortal foundation extend longevity and reduce injury impact, it also enables one to endure longer in environments where spiritual energy is scarce..." After listing the core benefits, he demonstrated several new techniques derived from his Immortal Foundation. Then, pinching his fingers into a hand seal, he added, "The Slaughter Jun Kui Light has also evolved considerably, now stronger by nearly thirty percent. I now see the wisdom of cultivating spells before establishing one's foundation."

He pondered for a moment and said, "Perhaps it is due to its influence. Now, whenever I use this spell, it naturally connects to the Immortal Foundation within me, complementing each other and greatly enhancing its power."

Li Xuanxuan listened with a smile, his expression showing his good mood. Li Xijun, however, appeared slightly puzzled and said in a low voice, "But while I was in seclusion earlier, the spiritual energy and earth veins around me fluctuated unpredictably, brightening and dimming without warning… it was truly dangerous. If not for the support of that Essence Gathering Pill, I might have been completely thrown off balance."

"...Such a mess!" Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to say. Finally, he spoke softly, "You are fortunate… as for Guiluan… she has already entered spiritual dissolution. Your sister buried her spirit husk alongside Yuanjiao, as a couple's burial."

Li Xijun's face turned pale. He seemed to have anticipated this outcome and said softly, "Second Uncle sought her out before. Aunt is among the wisest of people—she must have already guessed that he would not return. Her attempt to break through in seclusion was done with the resolve to die; she was not aiming for survival."
𝐟𝕣𝕖𝐞𝐰𝕖𝚋𝐧𝗼𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝗰𝐨𝐦

Li Xuanxuan fell silent again, his gaze drifting toward the ancestral hall on the mountain. Thinking of Li Zhouwei, he softly said, "This is a long story. We can discuss it further later… Zhouwei is in the ancestral hall. We should go check on him first!"

The three of them were standing outside the formation and couldn't discuss matters of receiving the talisman openly. Li Xijun, being someone who understood implied meanings, needed no further explanation. Hearing only the mention of Zhouwei being in the ancestral hall, he already understood the situation. He nodded gently and said, "Indeed, this is not the place for such discussions. Let us enter the mountain before speaking further."

The three entered the ancestral hall, only to find Li Zhouwei already standing silently within the chamber. He raised his pair of dark golden eyes and stared blankly at the stone platform, as though sensing something.

"How fast!" Li Xuanxuan, who had witnessed many generations of talisman acceptance in his family, couldn't help but be astonished. In the past, not one of them had completed the process in less than a few hours—some had even taken an entire day, starting in the morning and finishing at night.

But this time, in the span of less than a single stick of incense, Li Zhouwei had already completed the process. He now stood there thoughtfully, waiting. The old man sighed inwardly and hurried forward to ask, "Zhouwei, did you receive any techniques or spells?!"

The boy raised his head slightly, his gold-and-white robe fluttering gently in the breeze. He replied, "I received a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method."

His words exploded like thunder in their ears, leaving the three momentarily stunned. Li Xuanxuan's face flushed, and he murmured in disbelief, "What?!"

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly, his dark golden eyes blinking as he calmly and clearly enunciated, "A Grade Five Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique—Radiant Essence Scripture."




# Chapter 656: The Purple Mansion Realm Technique

"A Grade Five Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique—Radiant Essence Scripture." The weight of these words was immense. Even a fragment of this statement was enough to make one jump to their feet.

Li Xuanxuan's eyes widened as he asked in shock, "A Purple Mansion Realm technique?"

The Li Family wasn't entirely lacking in Purple Mansion Realm techniques. In fact, compared to other regions, Moongaze Lake, due to the Jiang Family's fragmentation, was one of the few places with an unusually rich and complete repository of cultivation techniques.

In other places, such as the Yuan Family's Mushroom Forest Plain or the various prefectures of Azure Pond, it was rare to even have one full technique up to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even techniques for the Six Chakras of the Embryonic Breathing Realm are divided into six separate sections, forcing cultivators to progress step by step, tightly restricted at every turn. Only in Moongaze Lake, lacking a central authority, could techniques flow more freely. Elsewhere, strict regulation was the norm.

But this was a Purple Mansion Realm technique—a complete and cultivable Purple Mansion Realm technique! It wasn't a fragmented remnant, nor was it a lost art from ancient times.

Even in a world where techniques were tightly controlled, and even in the chaotic free-for-all of the outer seas, Purple Mansion Realm techniques remained the most closely guarded secrets. They were the keys to elevating a family to the status of an immortal sect—a path to ascendancy. No wonder the revelation left the three utterly shaken.

The elder's beard trembled as he hastily grabbed a bamboo slip from the table. The clatter of wooden cases hitting the ground echoed as he snatched up a brush with his other hand and urgently said, "Wei'er, come… write it down immediately!"

His tone was rushed, almost as if he feared the boy would vanish at any moment, adopting a coaxing tone as though speaking to a child. Li Zhouwei obediently took the bamboo slip and, with a small hand guiding the brush, began to write. As he worked, he murmured, "It is a shame… this technique only goes up to the early Purple Mansion Realm and condenses the first… so-called divine ability…"

"It really is a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm technique." Li Qinghong's expression showed a trace of envy. Her own cultivation method capped at the late Foundation Establishment Realm. No matter how great her talent, she had no opportunity to even attempt breaking into the Purple Mansion Realm. Her eyes lingered on the bamboo slip, and she softly remarked, "What a great opportunity…"

Li Xijun's face lit up with a joyful smile, his long-suppressed expression finally breaking free. The intricate plans in his mind, which had been disrupted beyond recognition, suddenly didn't matter as he laughed out loud and asked, "Is Ximing still in seclusion? He has got some good luck as well! We have been worrying so much for him, but now it looks like his path is set too."

"You are still thinking about him!" Li Xuanxuan chuckled, though his gaze never left the young boy in front of him. There was something familiar in the child's demeanor and movements, a feeling he couldn't quite place no matter how hard he thought about it.

Before long, Li Zhouwei had finished transcribing the cultivation technique. Li Xuanxuan took the completed transcription and read it carefully from beginning to end, then slowly sat down to the side. A wide smile spread across his wrinkled face.

Clutching the technique, he read through it again, slapping his thigh as he exclaimed, "What a marvelous Grade Five technique! It is truly the Golden Yang Radiant Origin! The Radiant Origin Pass!"

Li Xuanxuan slapped his thigh three times in quick succession, his face full of admiration. The sight made Li Qinghong smirk quietly. She leaned closer to Li Xijun and whispered, "It has been ages since the old man looked this happy. Honestly, I have never seen him like this since I was a child."

The aunt and nephew exchanged knowing smiles. After a long while, Li Xuanxuan finally seemed to snap out of his daze. Noticing the two of them and the child watching him with amusement, he hastily collected himself and spoke solemnly, "Come, all of you, take a look at this!"

Li Qinghong took the transcription and skimmed the earlier sections, focusing her attention on the final parts. These detailed how an Immortal Foundation could nurture and catalyze divine abilities, describing nine different methods, mantras, and the challenges to overcome in achieving them.

She couldn't resist reading aloud the poetic description of the divine abilities, "Flames surge within the heart, illuminating the inner and outer Yang. Thus, the Bright Yang Divine Ability forms. Its brilliance spans nine chi, purple flames flare outward, radiant clouds ascend and dissipate, golden armor and robes materialize across the heavens… The sun blazes red in the east, the earth erupts in the south, traversing the Great Void, refining golden lotuses…"

The Li Family had previously acquired a defunct cultivation technique known as the Aged Courtly Path Scripture, which was also of the Purple Mansion Realm. However, compared to the Radiant Essence Scripture, the Aged Courtly Path Scripture was far shorter in length and entirely lacked such vivid descriptions.

Li Xuanxuan glanced at Li Qinghong's face, which showed a mix of longing and admiration. He remarked, "So many people cultivate, so many reach Foundation Establishment Realm, but how many truly ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm? For such grandeur, only one in countless individuals can succeed."

Li Qinghong smiled faintly and didn't reply. Instead, she asked Li Zhouwei a few questions, confirming that he hadn't received the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra. She then commented softly, "It must be that the Bright Yang constitution conflicts with Supreme Yin. You will just have to cultivate diligently. Zhouwei is a sensible child. It is better not to tell your father about this—it could end up harming him."

As she spoke, her gaze remained fixed on Li Zhouwei's golden eyes, as though trying to gauge his emotions. The boy simply nodded lightly, his expression steady, and said quietly, "Wei'er understands."

He didn't elaborate, but there was a quiet authority in his tone that inspired confidence. Li Qinghong paused briefly, then nodded and replied, "Good." Turning to the others, she said gently, "Let us send Zhouwei down first. We should not keep Chengliao waiting."

Both of them nodded in agreement. Li Xuanxuan took a sip of tea and set his cup down. By the time he did, Li Qinghong had already returned from the hall as swiftly as a bolt of lightning. She stood by his side, her expression now serious.

"This trip back was not just for this matter," she continued in a low voice, "On my way through Green Pine Island, I met with Xizhi. According to news from Azure Pond, Li Encheng of Fuchen Peak is nearing the end of his lifespan and plans to attempt a breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. He is now seeking assistance from our family."

Li Xuanxuan paused in surprise and asked, "That man… Does he even have a Purple Mansion Realm technique?"

Li Qinghong nodded, though her tone carried a trace of worry. "He does not. It is said he has been referencing similar techniques within the sect and concocting some pills on his own, risking everything for a last-ditch attempt before his death."

Li Xuanxuan's expression darkened with frustration. "We asked him to handle something for us, and he has not even finished the task. Now he is planning to die? What a waste of effort."

Li Qinghong nodded. She seemed to share his sentiment as she added, "Not just that. According to Xizhi, Li Encheng has not been of much help with family matters anyway. All this back-and-forth…"

From her sleeve, she produced a jade scroll densely packed with requests. "He is asking for rare medicinal herbs and spirit water, promising rewards after his breakthrough. But everyone knows the likelihood of success is slim to none. It is just a one-way trip."

Li Xijun accepted the jade scroll and read through it carefully. Items like Tongyuan Water and Changshan Spirit Stone were listed, totaling dozens of valuable resources. At the end, in small handwriting, there was an additional note, "If clues to Heavenly Pure Essence can be found, the rewards will be significant."

Li Xuanxuan glanced at the jade scroll and let out a derisive laugh, commenting, "If we truly possessed something as rare as Heavenly Pure Essence, would we simply hand it over to him? Preposterous!"

Li Xijun reread the contents of the scroll twice and spoke softly, "These items are indeed beyond what our family can afford. Aunt, brother, what are your thoughts?"

Li Qinghong responded, "That Li Encheng's younger brother, Li Enxi, a full-fledged Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, lowered himself to plead bitterly in your brother's hall, shedding tears and invoking the past favor of the Essence Gathering Pill and the ties between the Wei-Li Clan. Your brother found it difficult to outright refuse..."

"I understand." Li Xijun calmly put away the jade scroll and said softly, "I will gather one or two of these requested items. As for the rest, we will substitute them with similar Qi Cultivation Realm materials. We will expend some resources, send the package to Green Pine Island, and that will suffice."

Li Xijun continued, "The newly constructed formation at home has indeed strained our resources. Speak with Li Enxi and help him understand."

Li Qinghong nodded slightly and said quietly, "That is all we can do!"

Li Xuanxuan, however, winced as if in physical pain and reminded them, "Why should we always let him take advantage? Li Encheng has not done a thing for our family..."

Li Xijun understood his concern and replied gently, "Since Brother Zhi has agreed, he must have his own plans. We should do our best to support him."

Although reluctant, Li Xuanxuan trusted Li Xizhi's decisions. He relented and said, "You are right. Let us proceed with that plan."

Li Qinghong nodded and took the opportunity to relay the news she had gathered during her journey. Speaking softly, she added, "There is no rush to depart. Jun'er, handle the collection of materials first. We can leave in a few months."

Lijing Town.

Li Chengliao had been waiting anxiously on the mountain for quite some time. When he finally saw Li Qinghong returning with Li Zhouwei, she teased with a smile, "It has not been that long since we took him up the mountain, are you that reluctant to part with your family treasure?"

Li Chengliao laughed awkwardly, scooping up Li Zhouwei as they stepped onto the wind. They flew over the lake and entered the grand hall. As Li Chengliao observed his son, everything seemed the same as before, yet he felt there was a subtle change in the boy. He asked, "Wei'er, how was the mountain?"

Li Zhouwei seemed to be lost in thought, still savoring the scenes he had just experienced. He replied softly, "Father, there were many white irises on the mountain."

Li Chengliao paused, sensing the boy was speaking in riddles. But those seated in this central hall were no ordinary individuals. He raised his eyebrows slightly and began to think carefully.

It did not take long for him to pull a memory from the depths of his mind. That year, he was only twelve when he was sent to the mountain to have his aptitude assessed. His father, Li Xicheng, was not present, but he had gone with several younger siblings.

"The ancestral hall... soft cushions... Minggong... Chenghui..." As these hazy recollections sharpened, Li Chengliao remembered kneeling somewhere, his five senses sealed, before being led out and taught a spell.

Now that his knowledge far exceeded what it was then, he lowered his gaze and murmured, "Did they take you to the ancestral hall?"

Li Zhouwei raised his head to meet his father's eyes. His dark golden pupils flickered slightly as he replied softly, "Father has also been there?"

Li Chengliao nodded silently, his eyes reflecting deep thought. His mind raced, and in a low voice, he said, "I have been there, yes. They could not seal your sight, could they... No matter, Wei'er must understand."

Li Zhouwei seemed surprised, pausing briefly before answering, "Father, you ask too many questions."

Li Chengliao suddenly snapped out of his thoughts, momentarily at a loss for words. After a few moments of stunned silence, he laughed heartily, scooped up his son again, and said softly, "My mistake. I lost myself for a moment. My son possesses such divine bearing; he will never disappoint anyone."

He sighed and added, "But everything we do is for the good of the family..."

Li Zhouwei fixed his gaze on his father, as if studying his expression. In that moment, his dark golden eyes, as wild as a tiger's or leopard's, betrayed a hint of primal ferocity. But he silently absorbed the words, pondering them deeply.

A bright smile spread across his face as he tugged Li Chengliao into the grand hall. Picking up the long halberd at his side, he grinned and declared, "My halberd techniques have improved again. Let me demonstrate for Father!"

————

Eastern Mount Yue.

Rain dripped steadily as Yuan Fuyao completed a circuit around the town before retreating to his cave dwelling. Two servants approached him eagerly, asking for news.

Yuan Fuyao waved them off and replied, "The weather in northern Yue seems to be gradually returning to normal, though who knows how far the conflict between the two sects has progressed."

He sat down by the stone table and, after a moment, asked, "And at home... how is the Second Elder?"

The Yuan Family's internal strife had, like the shifting climate, begun to settle. Yuan Fuyao, who had spies within the family, was not entirely uninformed. His granduncle, Yuan Huyuan, no longer dared to return home. His father had disappeared without a word, leaving the Second Elder, Yuan Hudu, in full control of the situation.

Yuan Fuyao had long expected this outcome. With the backing of the Chi Family, how could the Second Elder lose? From the beginning, it had been a futile struggle—trapped prey lashing out pointlessly—only depleting the family's resources.

With the dust now settled, the Second Elder, Yuan Hudu, who had once shared a cordial relationship with Yuan Fuyao, now left him feeling conflicted and troubled, "Why on earth did they align with the Li Family? Once, I shared familial ties with Yuan Hudu and even benefited from his care. But now, this makes him my enemy... In this vast world, I am confined to this one small town!"

As Yuan Fuyao sat in his courtyard, sighing heavily, two of his attendants suddenly approached him with excited expressions, calling out, "Young Master! A letter has arrived from home!"

Yuan Fuyao quickly took the letter from them, eagerly scanning it from start to finish. His hands trembled as he read, finding the handwriting sharp and unmistakable. Upon closer inspection of the signature, it was indeed from Yuan Hudu!

Yuan Hudu's tone was courteous, and he thoroughly laid out his analysis in the letter, explaining every detail with transparency and clarity. He wrote:

"I am now in charge of the family, temporarily earning the trust of the Chi Family while letting Huyuan search for the Peak Master's whereabouts. This was all carefully planned with your father. For your part, I have arranged a marriage with a young lady from the Song Family. Please return home promptly."

"Your father has already made this promise, and it is unavoidable that you go through with it. The betrothal gifts are considerable, and the Li Family will surely demand them. If you have already obtained any of the items or clues regarding them, do not reveal anything. Find an excuse to leave Moongaze Lake and return home immediately. As long as you make it back safely, I will personally come to resolve the issue. Otherwise, if you fall into someone else's hands, you will become a pawn for their schemes, and there will be no way out."

Yuan Hudu explained everything thoroughly, even breaking down which factions the elders aligned with in their respective immortal sects. He ended with a warning, "The Li Family has aligned themselves with the Ning Family, who have been entrenched in the Southern Border for years. The Chi Family has long been displeased with this alliance... Your father only has you as his sole heir! Do not follow this path to destruction!"

Yuan Fuyao finished reading, drenched in sweat, with a sudden sense of clarity washing over him. Inwardly, he thought, Could it be true?! So, Father had already planned all this out! Were the elders merely acting all along?

He mulled over the situation repeatedly. However, the memory of Yuan Huyuan's expression on that day resurfaced in his mind, leaving him conflicted once more. Unsure of what to do, one of the Yuan Family attendants cautiously spoke up, "Young Master... the messenger said they will wait for you in the south at midnight... this..."

Yuan Fuyao was instantly shocked, exclaiming in frustration, "Why are you telling me this only now?!"

Looking at the moonlight in the sky, his composure faltered entirely. Never one to act decisively, he floundered like an ant on a hot griddle. One moment, he wanted to rush out; the next, he hesitated, feeling he needed to think things through a little more. Stomping his feet anxiously, he muttered, "What should I do? What should I do?!"




# Chapter 658: Severance

At Mount Qingdu.

The long-deserted grand hall finally welcomed its owner. A young man in white robes read meticulously through a stack of letters. Li Yuexiang sat beside him, occasionally chiming in with a few comments to fill in the gaps.

Li Xijun had just broken through a critical stage. After spending a few days stabilizing his cultivation, he emerged from his cave dwelling to handle family affairs. He leafed through the letters and quickly obtained a comprehensive understanding of the household’s current situation.

His eyebrows lifted in surprise, and he muttered, "Yuan Hudu... This man is something else."

Based on the gathered intelligence, the Yuan Family had stabilized itself under the leadership of the Second Elder, Yuan Hudu. This alone was not unusual. What truly caught everyone off guard was Yuan Hudu's approach: he had completely exonerated and reinstated the adversaries who had opposed him during the internal power struggle. Except for a few individuals who were injured during the conflict, the family had emerged virtually unscathed.

"How dare he?!" Li Xijun exclaimed, his tone laced with incredulity.

While this move undeniably preserved the Yuan Family’s overall strength, it left an indelible stain on Yuan Hudu’s claim to the position of family head. After all, even though he had wrested it from Yuan Huyuan, the upper echelons of the family were hardly his loyal supporters. Failing to take advantage of such an opportunity to purge dissenters seemed tantamount to digging his own grave. Even with the backing of the Chi Family, this decision felt overly audacious.

The situation had unfolded beyond everyone’s expectations. It was likely that not even Yuan Chengdun or Yuan Huyuan had anticipated such a turn of events, let alone the surrounding families. After a series of internal conflicts, the Yuan Family appeared outwardly unscathed, with only the disappearance of Yuan Huyuan raising suspicions and fueling speculation.

"There’s an eighty or even ninety percent chance that this was the Chi Family’s doing. Let’s observe for now," Li Xijun remarked. His face betrayed a trace of doubt, as though he had arrived at some unpleasant conjecture. He fell silent, deep in thought.

Nearby, the aged Li Xuanxuan watched quietly. He had an enigmatic expression as he broke the silence. "I recall meeting Yuan Huyuan once in my youth, when our ancestor had just reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. Yuan Huyuan came to congratulate him and said something that I still remember today."

"What did he say?" Li Xijun asked.

"He said... he aspired to be a diner at the table, carving out his share of the feast, rather than a mere hunting dog. But now, it seems, even those who sit at the table are nothing more than chess pieces in the eyes of the Chi Family. A marriage alliance means little in the grand scheme of things."

Li Xijun responded, "There is no such thing as diners carving a share of the feast. In the end, it comes down to whether or not one has reached the Purple Mansion Realm... or if one can leverage a connection to a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Xiang’er, continue reading."

Li Yuexiang nodded and continued explaining. She spoke at length about recent events, and eventually mentioned Yuan Fuyao.

Li Xijun listened for a while, frowning, then suddenly raised his hand to interrupt her. "Have you observed closely? Is Yuan Fuyao truly unaware of everything? Did Yuan Huyuan not send any loyal followers to keep an eye on him?"

"No, he didn’t," Li Yuexiang replied. She hesitated for a moment before adding, "But it doesn’t feel like complete ignorance. It’s as if he knows fragments of the truth but is missing much of the bigger picture."

Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment, and a hint of astonishment flashed across his face. Unable to hold back, he turned to Li Xijun and asked, "I wasn’t aware of his thoughts either. Yuan Chengdun not sending anyone to watch over this child is one thing. But even Yuan Huyuan didn’t assign a reliable person to oversee him? He left him to his own devices? He’s just a half-grown boy... what could he possibly understand?"

"Oh?" Li Xijun’s eyes fell to the paper before him, and he wrote a few notes. After a brief moment, he spoke calmly, "Yuan Chengdun trusted the wrong person and fell into the schemes of Yuan Huyuan and Yuan Hudu."

"What?"

Li Yuexiang and Li Xuanxuan were both visibly shaken by this revelation. They fell silent, each lost in their own thoughts.

Li Xijun seemed to have caught a thread of the bigger picture. He murmured, "I fear Yuan Tuan is beyond saving as well."

Before he could elaborate, a subordinate approached from the lower end of the hall, leaned in, and whispered a few words into his ear.

Li Xijun’s expression darkened slightly. He asked, "He left?"

"Yes, my lord," the man replied. "The young master claimed to be in secluded cultivation, but in truth, he slipped out of our territory late at night and headed south. Our people followed him for a while but didn’t dare intervene and had to let him go."

"He’s likely returned to the Yuan Family." Li Xuanxuan, naturally overheard the whispers, and his face darkened with displeasure. "How can he act so recklessly? He’s not afraid of offending our family! Fortunately, this matter was privately agreed upon between the two families. Otherwise, if word got out, people might think he fled from the marriage arrangement!"

However, Li Xijun set the letter in his hand aside and leaned back against the wooden chair. His sharp eyebrows knitted slightly, and he pondered aloud, "If you ask me, despite this Yuan brat offending our family, as long as Yuan Chengdun's death isn't confirmed, he will always have another way out. There’s no guarantee that Yuan Huyuan isn’t betting on both sides and engaging in some clever schemes."

Li Xuanxuan appeared confused as he sank into thought in an attempt to make sense of it. However, Li Xijun was seemingly indifferent. He sipped his tea leisurely and explained, "Just wait. If Yuan Huyuan and Yuan Hudu are truly united, and if Yuan Chengdun trusted the wrong person, then Yuan Huyuan will show up at our doorstep any moment now."

Li Yuexiang, catching on, speculated quietly, "Could it be that the chaos in the Yuan Family was intentional?"

But before her words could even fade away, a commotion erupted at the lower end of the hall. A Jade Court Guard, clad in gleaming armor, stepped forward with a crisp clang of metal.

Bowing respectfully, he announced, "My lord, Yuan Huyuan from the Yuan Family seeks an audience."

Li Xijun chuckled, glancing at Li Xuanxuan. His voice turned cold as he remarked, "As expected. The direct bloodline staged a grand show of infighting and sacrificed Yuan Chengdun and his son to protect the bigger picture! The Yuan Family wants to sever all ties with us, with Qingsui, and with Yuan Tuan, just to become obedient lapdogs under the Chi family’s banner!"

Despite the declining influence within the Azure Pond Sect, the Yuan Family had once been a significant power with considerable autonomy. They had thrived for many years when Yuan Licheng, a disciple of Chi Buzi, was still alive. But now that Yuan Licheng had passed away and Chi Buzi was missing, the Yuan Family had become a battleground between two sects. It seemed inevitable that they would fall under the Chi Family’s control as a vassal.

"It seems Yuan Chengdun might have left someone behind or sent a letter to warn the boy, but Yuan Huyuan intercepted everything." Li Xijun’s eyes glimmered as he revealed his pristine white teeth in a sharp smile. "How could the Chi Family’s dog possibly cozy up to the Xiao Family’s dog? Yet, they must obey the Chi Family’s orders. They’re aiming to loudly and clearly sever ties with every family. At the same time, they fear truly offending us. So, they’ve sent Yuan Huyuan as a mediator. What a calculation! What a plan!"

Li Xuanxuan had finally pieced everything together. He mulled over the matter and finally spoke in a hushed tone, "You’re saying... the Yuan Family never intended to resist. They pledged allegiance to the Chi Family long ago, and everything was just a show to gain the trust of others. Yuan Huyuan and Yuan Hudu have been colluding from the start. Yuan Chengdun tried to do the right thing with good intentions, but Yuan Huyuan twisted it into a move to humiliate our family and curry favor with those above?"

Li Xijun’s eyes narrowed. "That’s more or less the case. Our family allied with the Ning and Xiao Families, so the Yuan Family, now serving as a lapdog, naturally cannot act as it once did. They’ve placed their bets on two fronts.

"The first is whether they can locate Yuan Tuan, and the second is whether they can drag our family into this mess. If these two matters can be resolved clearly, the Yuan Family would obviously prefer independence. But if we refuse to get involved, the marriage arrangement becomes a convenient excuse to publicly sever ties with our family. Whether we agree or not, as long as word spreads that Yuan Fuyao fled the engagement, it will drive a wedge between the two families."

Li Xijun’s deductions came together swiftly and clearly. He concluded softly, "The day Yuan Huyuan came seeking Granduncle’s assistance and was denied was the day he decided to pledge loyalty to the Chi Family. From that moment, Yuan Chengdun’s letter would have never reached Yuan Fuyao. No matter what, Yuan Fuyao has now become the trigger for the rupture between the two families."

Li Xuanxuan’s face darkened with a mix of anger and sorrow. "Yuan Huyuan once met my Second Uncle. I thought the Yuan Family would maintain a friendly relationship with us for generations. How could it come to this? Even if the situation forced their hand, there was no need to resort to such underhanded tactics!"

He began to rise, ready to confront the matter, but Li Xijun raised a hand to stop him. The younger man’s calm demeanor contradicted the sharpness of his tone as he said, "I’ll handle him."

Yuan Huyuan looked disheveled and drained of energy as he entered. But he looked up as a strikingly handsome young man approached him. The youth’s white robes were as pristine as freshly fallen snow, and Li Yuexiang stood quietly by his side.

Yuan Huyuan was stunned. He paused for a moment before tentatively speaking, "I wonder if Daoist Xuanxuan might be available...?"

"You’ve come at an unfortunate time, senior," the young man replied with a faint smile. "The elder is cultivating in seclusion. I am Li Xijun, and this is my younger sister, Yuexiang. Greetings, Senior Huyuan."

Yuan Huyuan’s eyes flickered briefly over Li Xijun’s face. Something in the youth’s expression struck him as even more challenging to deal with than Li Xuanxuan.

He cleared his throat before rasping, "Another cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm... Your family truly produces talents in abundance. It’s admirable."

Li Xijun shook his head modestly and replied softly, "You flatter me, senior. May I ask the purpose of your visit today?"

Yuan Huyuan’s weathered face fell as his tone turned mournful. "I am powerless on my own... The Yuan family has already fallen into my younger brother’s hands. He has devoted himself entirely to the Chi family and turned us into their vassals. I fear he might disregard the bond between our families and do something foolish!"

"Oh?" Li Xijun raised an eyebrow in apparent surprise as he replied, "If it’s about returning the betrothal gifts, that’s a minor matter."

Feigning ignorance, he gestured to the Jade Court Guards standing nearby and serenely ordered, "Please escort Young Master Yuan here."

Yuan Huyuan felt a chill run down his spine. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, Li Xijun unexpectedly took his hand with a courteous smile and said gently, "Senior Yuan, the friendship between our families spans generations. You’ve even met our family’s ancestor! The congratulatory gift you sent, the Dragon Coiling Pillar, remains as our family head’s sword to this day. How could there ever be betrayal between us?"

Li Xijun’s words were warm and polite, yet there was an unmistakable undertone to them. Cold beads of perspiration started to glisten on Yuan Huyuan’s forehead as Li Xijun continued, his voice calm yet firm, "Your relationship with us is solid, senior. My sister can certainly spend more time chatting with you..."

The implications behind his words caused Yuan Huyuan to falter. He wiped his brow and stammered weakly, "Actually... I fear that..."

Just then, a Jade Court Guard rushed in, kneeling as he reported urgently, "My lord! Young Master Yuan has escaped!"

"Escaped?" Li Xijun exclaimed in apparent disbelief. His tone carried a faint hint of amusement as he continued, "How could that be? Go check the farm again."

Yuan Huyuan’s face was drenched in sweat. His expression crumbled into despair as he said, "Xijun... there’s no need to search anymore! My younger brother has already summoned him back. Let’s just forget about this matter... I can only apologize to Miss Yuexiang!"

Li Xijun’s expression darkened instantly.He remained silent for several moments before finally replying icily, "Senior, if you had no desire for this union, you could have just said so. Why go to such lengths to humiliate my family?"

Yuan Huyuan’s heart was swirling in turmoil as he struggled to lift his head and meet Li Xijun’s eyes. For a fleeting moment, he seemed to glimpse the shadow of a middle-aged man in gray robes from years past. The memory of Li Tongya and his unfathomable presence surged back into his mind. He could no longer sit still, and his wooden chair suddenly began to feel like a precarious perch.

He had seen several generations of the Li family, and though none had ever evoked the towering, unshakable presence of Li Tongya, Li Xijun now felt like a blade concealed in snow—piercingly sharp and unerringly perceptive. It felt as though his every calculation had been laid bare.

Yuan Huyuan could only sigh in misery, "I have already lost control of my family. I have no power over my younger brother. I fear he will make a spectacle of this and sever all ties between our families. Yuexiang... Yuexiang... I never thought it would come to this!"

The implication was clear. Yuan Huyuan’s brother intended to spread the rumor that Yuan Fuyao had fled because he regretted the betrothal, ensuring a complete and irreparable rupture between the Yuan and Li families. Yuan Huyuan raised his tired, sorrowful face to look at Li Yuexiang, expecting to see anger or humiliation.

Instead, he was met with a calm, smiling countenance. Her almond-shaped eyes blinked softly and her voice was as gentle as a spring breeze as she replied, "It’s fine, senior. I’m fine."

Despite her seemingly serene tone, Yuan Huyuan felt a shiver run down his spine. It was like he could hear the distant echo of a sword’s cold hum. Her gaze, though polite, carried unspoken words that seemed to pierce through him.

But your family may not be.

Yuan Huyuan could no longer find the words to continue. He silently stepped back and left the great hall, only to see a woman clad in jade armor standing outside. She held a spear in her arms and stood as if she had been listening for some time.

Her almond-shaped eyes rose slightly as she spoke calmly, "I’ll escort you out, senior."

A Yuan Huyuan shuddered. As a Foundation Establishment cultivator who had barely reached his level through medicinal pills, his strength was absolutely inferior to Li Qinghong. If it came to a fight, he wasn’t sure he could last more than a few rounds against her.

Swallowing hard, he stammered, "Ah, it’s you, Qinghong."

Li Qinghong rose into the wind alongside him, her voice steady and even, "If your family must throw its lot in with the Chi family, it is understandable. But the means you’ve employed are far too underhanded. Surely, years of friendship between our families did not have to end this way."

Yuan Huyuan sighed deeply, his voice laden with sorrow.

Li Qinghong paused briefly before continuing, "Your family has wronged ours, Yuan Chengdun, and Qingsui Peak all in one stroke. You’ve not only severed the ties between our families but also caused us to lose credibility with Yuan Chengdun. If you have the slightest shred of goodwill toward my family, I ask that you spare Yuan Fuyao’s life."

Yuan Huyuan now understood that his schemes had almost entirely been seen through. He said quietly, "Yuan Fuyao will come to no harm. He’s being closely watched. You may rest assured."

Li Qinghong cupped her fists in salute before riding a bolt of lightning back toward the Li estate, leaving Yuan Huyuan to fly off alone. As he soared through the sky, memories of his decades-long friendship with Li Yuanjiao and Li Xuanxuan swirled in his mind. He felt a growing sense of desolation.

He muttered to himself, "It’s just... just that Sword Immortal Li once defeated Chi Zhiyun with a single strike, and the Li family’s growing closeness with the Xiao family has long left the Chi family uneasy. How could they tolerate me preserving my old alliances? If I weren’t ruthless, how could I silence the Chi family’s jibes?"

He looked out at the horizon, his heart hollow and adrift. The image of Li Yuexiang’s smiling face and her calm, measured words suddenly surfaced in his mind, sending a shiver through him.

"Li Yuanjiao was a viper at heart. His daughter is probably no different... Why, of all families, did it have to be the Li family?"

If Yuan Huyuan had been given the choice, the Li family would have been the last among his relatives and allies that he would wish to offend. But he was a man adrift in turbulent waters, with no other options. Head bowed in resignation, he pressed forward, silent and alone.

----

Li Qinghong descended gracefully into the courtyard, carried by the wind. Inside, a few people were deep in conversation. Li Xijun gave her a small nod, acknowledging their seamless coordination despite having made no prior arrangements.

Li Xuanxuan broke the silence.

"We still don’t know the fate of Yuan Chengdun and Yuan Tuan. Even if they return now, it’s likely too late to salvage anything. But I did give Yuan Chengdun my word... And what are we supposed to do about Yuan Fuyao running away? It's not like we can send people and drag him back. "

Li Xijun gestured dismissively. "Yuexiang’s agreement was originally based on Yuan Fuyao staying willingly. Who could have predicted that Yuan Huyuan would act this way? Even Yuan Chengdun didn’t foresee this... His cultivation is among the best, but how could he outmatch a wily old fox like Yuan Huyuan when it comes to political schemes?"

He stopped for a moment, then added in a softer tone, "From now on, that man has nothing to do with our family. There’s no need to mention him again."

Turning to his sister, he sighed and said, "I’m afraid you’ve been wronged in all this... The Yuan family’s attempt to sever ties with us will undoubtedly stir up rumors and gossip."

Li Yuexiang, seated quietly at the table, offered a serene smile and shook her head.

She said, "It’s nothing to worry about. People will only ridicule the Yuan family for their inconsistency, and Yuan Fuyao for his lack of discernment."




# Chapter 660: Rumors On Green Pine Island

Li Xizhi sat quietly in his cave dwelling, flipping through the small letters on his desk. He had been in seclusion long enough to accumulate quite a few messages. As he browsed through them, his brow suddenly furrowed. He picked up one of the letters.

He exclaimed, "The Yuan Family regrets the engagement? What nonsense!"

The matter between Li Yuexiang and Yuan Fuyao had always been a private agreement, barely even set in stone. Moreover, Li Xizhi had outright rejected it and even returned the betrothal gifts. The arrangement had long since fallen through.

Yet, the letter clearly stated that word had spread within the sect that Yuan Fuyao had gone back on his engagement with Li Yuexiang. Li Xizhi frowned deeply. When he read further, he even found rumors detailing how Yuan Fuyao had fled.

"The Song Family... He chose the Song Family instead?" Li Xizhi almost laughed aloud in anger as he pondered the current power dynamics carefully. Finally, he muttered, "So they sided with the Chi Family..."

He fell silent. Since several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were weakening, the Chi Family's power was gradually recovering. Though Chi Buzi's whereabouts remained unknown, Daoist Master Suiguan was still supporting them...

Daoist Master Yuanwu still has some lifespan remaining... If I’ve calculated the years correctly, more than half of the twenty-one cultivators in seclusion attempting a breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm are likely reaching the end of their lifespan. With the struggle for dominance between the Azure Pond Sect and the Yue Cultivating Sect happening, the future situation remains unpredictable.

Someone entered his cave dwelling as he ruminated. The visitor's face was filled with bitterness, anger and confusion. Bowing with cupped fists, he said, "Senior Brother! This... this is—!"

It was none other than his junior brother, Yuan Chengzhao. He had clearly just received the news as well, and was torn between disbelief and rage.

Li Xizhi sighed and replied, "This is the Yuan Family's business. We won't blame you for what happened. The bond between us as senior and junior brothers remains unchanged. You need not worry."

----

Shanji Prefecture Market.

Shanji Prefecture had always been the territory of the Profound Peak Gate. The few markets that existed were rather prosperous and bustled with people. Its proximity to the Eastern Sea, coupled with the Profound Peak Gate’s reputation for fairness, made it a common resting place for cultivators traveling to and from the Eastern Sea.

Li Xuanfeng put away his golden bow and casually found a restaurant. He ordered two small dishes and sat in the hall on the second floor, gazing at the fluttering flags outside the window.

He had only visited a restaurant twice in his lifetime. The first time had been with Liu Changdie. On that occasion, Liu Changdie had merely asked him some trivial questions and commented that his ways resembled those of the demonic path. He had mentioned Jiang Yan from the devil plague incident very early on, which suggested that he had known the inside story long before others.

"Jiang Yan...[1]" The old man chewed over the name for a moment. He found it pleasant to the ear. He lowered his gaze in thought, but his ears twitched as he caught the conversation of some cultivators nearby.

"Have you heard... about the Yuan Family’s affair?"

"Of course, I’ve heard! Ah! Tell me, why would the Yuan Family suddenly go back on the engagement?"

Li Xuanfeng slowly raised his head, and his gray-black eyes swept over the table beside him. He continued to gently swirl the jade cup in his hand and listened quietly.

One of the speakers wore black robes and had a Daoist headscarf akin to that of an ancient Daoist priest. His attire suggested he was a cultivator from the territory under the Great Xiukui Temple in Linhai Prefecture.

The black-robed man spoke first, "I heard that the young lady from the Li Family is an orphan and at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Who knows how many spirit items she inherited? That Young Master Yuan must be out of his mind to abandon her and marry that woman from the lowly Song Family!"

The other man was dressed in white robes. It was unclear which sect he belonged to. He tapped his jade chopsticks lightly and spoke in a serious tone, "What do you know? The woman from the Song Family is his childhood sweetheart. They grew up together. How could he abandon her so easily? I think his actions reflect a rather commendable character."

"Heh! He’ll only regret it!" said the black-robed man, putting on a stern face, but before he could continue, a sharp cracking sound rang out—like the shattering of a silver bottle. He turned his head to look, only to find that a cultivator at the neighboring table had crushed a spirit cup into fine powder. Greenish shards scattered everywhere.

The man’s hair was more than half white, yet his physique was robust, and his features were sharp and weathered. With his black-gold armor, he resembled a seasoned general who had fought for many years. His eyes were filled with coldness as he turned to look over at them.

The black-robed man felt a surge of doubt in his heart. He swept his spiritual sense over the man and was immediately struck with terror.

A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator!

He quickly stood up with great respect, his tone somewhat humble as he said, "I did not intend to offend you, Senior... I am surnamed Lin... from the Lin Family of Linhai Prefecture..."
𝙛𝒓𝓮𝒆𝔀𝒆𝙗𝓷𝒐𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝓶

But the armored man had already seated himself beside him before he could finish his sentence. His deep eyes stared into him as he pressed the black-robed man back into his seat with a casual gesture.

The armored man asked quietly, "You just said... someone from the Yuan Family... broke off the engagement with Yuexiang?"

When he heard how familiarly the armored man referred to the young lady from the Li Family, the black-robed man immediately realized the situation. Fear coiled around his heart.

Damn it! I ran into someone involved!

The white-robed cultivator beside him collapsed to the ground with a dull thud. He had just spoken in defense of the Yuan Family, and now he regretted it deeply. He wished he could slap himself a few times. Trembling, he pulled himself together and knelt on the ground, not daring to say a word.

"Yes... there has been a change in the Yuan Family. It is said that they broke off the engagement and parted on bad terms with the Li Family..."

The black-robed man quickly recounted the matter in a low voice from start to finish.

Li Xuanfeng’s expression was much calmer by the end. He nodded thoughtfully, his fingers gently tapping the table.

When Li Yuanjiao had died before his very eyes, he had been consumed by rage and violence, but he had no way to release them. If he had allowed Yuanjiao's daughter to be wronged as well, wouldn’t that old man's soul feel cold in the afterlife?

Li Xuanfeng was lost in thought for a while. But the metallic objects throughout the restaurant began to vibrate faintly. The cultivators in the restaurant shrank back into their seats, not daring to make a sound.

Li Xuanfeng looked back at the black-robed man and asked, "Since you’re from the Great Xiukui Temple, do you know Lin Chensheng?"

The black-robed man was overjoyed and quickly replied, "He is an elder of my clan!"

"Has his injury healed?" asked Li Xuanfeng.

The black-robed man was shocked but quickly nodded and said, "He has recovered considerably. I heard that he returned to the sect and made a breakthrough."

"Good," said Li Xuanfeng.

He tossed a pouch of spirit rice onto the table as compensation for the shattered spirit cup. By the time they all blinked, he had already disappeared from the restaurant and the metal objects finally ceased vibrating. A golden jug clanged as it bounced on the ground. The cultivators all let out a collective sigh of relief.

Someone muttered, "A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was actually drinking in a place like this... What a rare sight!"

The black-robed man was still shaken. He looked across at the white-robed youth, whose face was drenched in sweat, and said with a sigh, "You really had a stroke of luck! Fortunately, that senior had a good temper... Do you even know who Lin Chensheng is?"

The white-robed youth was still unsettled, but asked, "Please enlighten me."

The black-robed man started explaining, "He’s the pride of our temple, the nephew of a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master! He moves freely even within a grotto heaven!"

"If that senior knew his name and even inquired about his injuries... It’s likely they ventured into the grotto heaven together! A figure like that is no ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. He could probably reduce you to ashes with a breath!"

Both of them let out another breath of relief. The white-robed youth felt like he had narrowly escaped death. "There’s truth in the saying that disaster comes from the mouth. I’ve learned my lesson now... I’m lucky to be alive... Lucky to be alive..."

The black-robed man recalled Li Xuanfeng’s expression and could not help but shiver. When he saw that the entire restaurant was now silently watching him, eyes filled with curiosity, he added with a hint of smugness, "When the elder was away, they bullied his younger kin... Someone is bound to suffer for this!"

1. The name Jiang Yan ‘江雁’ means ‘a wild goose over the river’. It gives a sense of freedom, grace, and travel. Perhaps someone with a gentle but determined nature, or a person associated with distant journeys and heartfelt connections. It’s a very elegant and poetic name. ☜




# Chapter 664: Chen Yang

Li Chengliao wore a gentle smile as he replied to Xu Gongming, “The weather has eased a little, so we’ve finally gotten a harvest. That’s a relief.”

He took the family head’s seat as he looked at Chen Mufeng and Chen Yang below him, and said warmly, “This must be Yang’er. I’ve heard you’ve broken through to the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. What a rare talent!”

The eighteen steps in the hall were not mere decorations, they perfectly blocked the spiritual sense of ordinary cultivators of the Qi Cultivation Realm. More than that, Chen Yang was kneeling far away, ruling out the possibility that Li Chengliao had probed him with spiritual sense.

I’ve only just come out of seclusion, yet he already knew!

Li Chengliao descended the steps with a cheerful smile until he stood before the youth. He lifted Chen Yang’s hand, saw the boy raise his head, and gave a slight nod.

Turning back to Xu Gongming and the others, he laughed, “One look, and you can tell he’s one of ours. His brows and eyes are exactly the same!”

This statement clearly caught everyone off guard. Chen Yang was stunned for a moment, and his lips involuntarily curled slightly downward. But then his brows lifted, and his eyes shone with both joy and pride. His calm face suddenly came to life, bursting forth with a surge of spirit.

The crowd laughed heartily, offering their congratulations. However, Li Chengliao felt a shadow of doubt flash across his mind even as he smiled.

That expression... That expression... Good! Good!

Although Chen Yang was precocious, he was still far from matching Li Chengliao, who had managed his household for many years. Li Chengliao went beyond the boy’s seemingly proper eyes and his sharp glances, and found a familiar cast to the youth’s brows and the downward curve of his lips.

That rebellious and ambitious aura brought back memories like a thorn pricking his hand, making him grit his teeth and inhale sharply. Li Chengliao’s smile twisted slightly as he remembered a youth who had once wielded gray fire and rampaged across the sky.

He’s a seed of ambition.

Li Chengliao had always trusted his instincts. Just as he had once recognized Xu Xiao’s uniqueness at a glance, he now sensed the same budding ambition in Chen Yang. Yet, this was not blind arrogance; this boy carried more of the Li Family’s cunning and even a hint of cruelty.

And his talent is exceptional! If he is set loose into the world, he could stir up great storms... The Chen Family has produced a true prodigy!

Having made a preliminary judgment on the boy’s character, Li Chengliao smiled at Chen Mufeng and asked, “So, you plan to send him to accompany the heir? If he’s so remarkably talented, wouldn’t it be a waste not to allow him to solely focus on cultivation?”

While his eyes were fixed on Chen Mufeng, his spiritual sense was focused on Chen Yang. He noticed the boy’s head rise slightly, and the twitch of his eyelids. Li Chengliao’s heart stirred as he listened to Chen Mufeng’s courteous reply.

Chen Mufeng replied, “Embryonic Breathing Realm doesn’t require daily cultivation! It only takes a few hours a day for him to refine spiritual qi. The rest of the time is often wasted effort. It’s better for him to learn something at the heir’s side... After all, Yang’er is three years older than the heir. He can guide Zhouwei a little!”

Li Chengliao replied politely, though he had already agreed in his heart. He turned to the boy and deliberately said, “Yang’er, follow the corridor down. Someone will lead you to the heir’s residence. I’ve already informed him that I’m sending over a companion.”

Chen Mufeng was slightly stunned when he realized that Li Chengliao intended to have the two children meet alone. However, just as he stepped hesitantly toward his son, Li Chengliao smiled and added, “I still have a few matters to discuss with the battalion commander!”

Chen Mufeng could only come to a halt upon hearing these words. Recalling his wife’s words, he could only sigh lightly as he watched his child leave.

Li Chengliao said, “I recall that the Chen Family has been at odds with the Xu Family for generations. Has there ever been a marriage alliance between the two families?”

“Of course not!” Chen Mufeng answered firmly.

Chen Yang hesitated for a moment, and then thought that Li Chengliao did not wish for him to hear the following conversation. He quickly followed the guard down the corridor, passing through the winding walkway until he reached the courtyard’s outer edge.

When he glanced around at the pristine white ground and the two slightly ajar golden doors at the entrance, a trace of disdain flickered in his heart.

Chen Yang had always been the most talented among his peers since he was a child. He toyed with them like playthings, manipulating them with just a few words.

How could I possibly fear another child? He thought to himself. What of the heir? His talent is likely mediocre. I heard he’s only been cultivating for two years. At best he has condensed Radiant Lure Chakra and reached the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. That would be nothing for me to handle. Besides, what schemes could he possibly have when he’s been confined to this small courtyard every day? I only need a small trick to wrap him around my finger.

Chen Yang had always been cunning. How could he respect a child three or four years younger than him? He sneered inwardly as he mused that the heir likely could not even recognize all his characters yet.

As he stepped into the courtyard, a sudden, intoxicating fragrance filled his nostrils. Chen Yang frowned, but he was too young to recognize the scent.

He thought to himself, I don’t know what kind of incense this is, but it smells good. I should take some back later.

An old ape with white fur and drooping eyelids stood in the inner courtyard.

Chen Yang was too sharp to underestimate such a creature. He thought to himself, This is most likely the spirit beast that guards the heir. I wonder what level its cultivation has reached.

Since he could only guess that it was likely a spirit beast at the Qi Cultivation Realm, he respectfully bowed before entering. He felt pleased with himself, believing he had discreetly earned some favor.

When he pushed open the door, Chen Yang saw a boy dressed in gold and white, kneeling in the courtyard. He seemed to be only eight or nine years old and was facing away from him.

Before Chen Yang could greet him, the heir suddenly turned around. A pair of deep dark-golden eyes locked onto him. They were calm, yet filled with a disdainful scrutiny. The heir’s ears perked up slightly and twisted agilely to his feet as he noticed something off. For a moment, the way he moved resembled the supple, yet strong movements of a leopard on the prowl.

Startled, Chen Yang instinctively took a step back. But a moment later, he swiftly buried his embarrassed anger as he said quietly, “Greetings to the Heir of the Li Family.”

Li Zhouwei examined him for two breaths. His amber eyes seemed to become even more fearsome and sinister at Chen Yang’s tone. Chen Yang’s instincts prickled as he realized he quickly sensed the meaning in his gaze.

He quickly realized, Those are not ordinary eyes. Normal people would never even dare look at them unless they were kneeling before him. In fact, those eyes might be more effective against women. He stifled a wave of anger at being belittled. He sneered inwardly as he stepped forward, emphasizing his taller and stronger frame, and pretended to humbly say, “Greetings.”




# Chapter 669: Chen And Li

Li Yuexiang listened to her brother's words, but there was no joy on her face. She had more concerns on her mind and simply murmured softly, "I don’t feel wronged, but I fear that offending them too deeply may stir up trouble."

Li Xijun gently shook his head and replied: "There is no longer any question of offense. All the noble families have their eyes set on profit, and the Yuan Family has already lost its moral standing."

Li Yuexiang nodded slightly. Meanwhile, Li Xijun unfolded the small letter in his hand and read through it, then said softly, "Go and make preparations. Brother Xizhi will return in a few days to take you to Green Pine Island... His cave dwelling still has vacant spots. It will be beneficial for you to cultivate there."

Only then did Li Yuexiang nodded lightly, revealing a trace of happiness. Li Xijun did not wish to say more, so he dismissed them. After listening to the reports from below, he smiled and left the hall. He made his way through the corridor and quickly arrived at the Alchemy Pavilion.

Li Ximing, clad in a Daoist alchemist robe, sat leisurely in the hall. His garments were fresh and crisp, with a faint paleness to them. Having just broken through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm, he was basking in the triumph of success.

Li Xijun knew him all too well. Though he appeared composed, he was undoubtedly overjoyed inside. Playing along, Li Xijun strode up quickly and exclaimed in surprise, "That was fast, Brother Ximing! Was it a smooth breakthrough?"

Li Ximing chuckled happily, tightening his sleeve cuffs as he replied, "Since I took a medicinal pill, the breakthrough was effortless. I spent some time conditioning myself to stabilize my cultivation before coming out."

He was brimming with excitement and was about to go into detail when he suddenly scanned Li Xijun up and down, his expression shifting to one of surprise and delight. He exclaimed, "You’ve reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

Li Xijun allowed a small smile to surface and nodded slightly. Li Ximing immediately stood up and clapped him on the shoulder with a grin, saying, "What a fine snow-pine mana!"

Li Xijun nodded lightly, waiting for him to calm down before saying, "There’s something I need to discuss with you."

Li Ximing listened as Li Xijun relayed Li Xuanfeng’s words, his brows knitting together in thought. He shook his head slightly and said with questions in his mind, "I don’t see it that way. My cultivation in the Bright Yang path has progressed steadily. I have already surpassed some of the direct disciples of the Immortal Sects. How could I be deemed unfit? Perhaps the elder has grown too accustomed to the high standards of the southern border..."

He suddenly clenched his fist, belatedly realizing something and muttering, "If I had followed the family's arrangements back then, as the elder suggested, perhaps my cultivation wouldn't have progressed much slower after all..."

While Li Ximing mulled over his thoughts, Li Xijun caught sight of a potted orchid on the table from the corner of his eye. Despite being in seclusion for years, it was still flourishing. It indicated that someone had been tending to it carefully.

His eyes flickered as he turned his head to the other side, gazing at the alchemy furnace. The flames inside flickered unpredictably, while the world outside was engulfed in a raging storm. Li Ximing, unaware of why Li Xijun's expression had changed, looked on in confusion.

Li Xijun paused before suddenly asking, "Brother Ximing, have you taken a liking to orchids in recent years?"

Li Ximing looked slightly embarrassed and quickly replied, "I just grow them for leisure, it has nothing to do with Zhuoyun!"

As soon as he said it, he realized he had spoken too quickly. But before he could adjust his tone, he saw Li Xijun suddenly frown, gazing at the storm outside and murmuring, "It’s a celestial phenomenon!"

Li Ximing was still trying to form a response, but Li Xijun’s words shut him down. In an instant, Li Xijun vanished. Li Ximing swiftly followed behind. He rode a streak of golden light, and soon stood beside Li Xijun atop Mount Qingdu. Both of them gazed into the southern horizon where a golden radiance shone in the distance.

Their Immortal Foundations Realm rippled gently, allowing them to faintly perceive the rising multicolored light in the distance. Li Ximing sighed enviously and said, "Someone must have broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm!"

The iridescent hues spread swiftly, forming clouds that took the shape of beasts and birds across the sky. They were so lifelike they seemed almost real. At the heart of the vast ocean of clouds, a massive celestial elephant formed from pure white mist trumpeted toward the heavens, radiating golden light in all directions.

The golden radiance rippled outward like waves, causing the vegetation in the mountains to sway gently. Leaves fell like a golden rain, covering the entire mountain in autumn hues. Li Xijun slowly closed his eyes, carefully attuning himself to the rising spiritual energy permeating the heavens and earth.

Li Ximing also paused, realizing what was happening. Both brothers closed their eyes and immersed themselves in the moment. After about fifteen minutes, they exchanged a glance, and Li Ximing said with a sigh, "The Profound Balance Atmosphere... It has already dissipated completely! It’s rare for it to last this long."

Li Xijun carefully observed the direction where the clouds were converging and estimated that it was within the Hengzhu Dao Gate. He murmured, "Hengzhu Dao Gate has gained another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!"

The two brothers rode the wind back down to the mountain together. Li Ximing said, "I clearly remember that Hengzhu Dao Gate and Yue Cultivating Sect have always had a good relationship. But how can such a breakthrough be controlled at will? A celestial phenomenon of this scale is like an announcement to the entire world and this phenomenon might just be the final surge that drains the remaining spiritual energy of heaven and earth."

Although the Li Family had slowly built some foundation, they still lacked methods to detect phenomena like Profound Balance Atmosphere and Falling Water Rising Storm, which were crucial to understanding the spiritual energy of cultivators at the Purple Mansion Realm. For now, they could only watch helplessly, unsure of how the spiritual energy of heaven and earth had changed.

"We lack the necessary spells. If we hadn’t anticipated a change and paid close attention, we might not have even noticed this subtle shift..." said Li Xijun, sighing.

Beside him, Li Ximing asked, "Why not have our aunt return for a while? If she uses her thunder techniques, she might be able to uncover some clues."

"I don't think it'll be that simple," replied Li Xijun. He had discussed this matter with Li Qinghong before and It seemed that Falling Water Rising Storm had only been perceivable in the past due to its connection to thunder techniques. Now, it would likely be much harder to detect. He continued, "Just send a letter to Brother Xizhi and ask him about it."




# Chapter 671: Things Of Mount Wu

Li Xijun spent years in secluded cultivation, refining spell arts and consolidating his Immortal Foundation. When he finally emerged, Mount Yuting had been influenced by his Immortal Foundation, Snow On Pine. The snow that once only covered the mountain's summit had now spread downward, blanketing the entire mountain in frost and snow.

By the time he emerged, the sun was shining, and the trees were flourishing. As expected, several letters that were all from Li Xizhi had been sent to him. Before he could read them, he heard that Li Xuanfeng was already waiting at Mount Qingdu.

Hurriedly riding the wind toward the meeting, he quickly pulled out two letters and read them carefully. One discussed the shifting patterns of spiritual energy, while the other described the increasing turmoil in the Eastern Sea.

Direct descendants from Chunyi Dao Gate and Island of Mount Qingdu have perished, and several members of the Guo Family on Crimson Reef Island have also died suddenly...

He only glanced at it briefly before tucking it into his sleeve and flying swiftly to the mountaintop.

"Second great uncle has been returning frequently! It seems the Ning Family has loosened their grip... or perhaps they've assigned him a task," muttered Li Xijun. He had been keeping track of these matters. He was perceptive and noticed that each time Li Xuanfeng returned, he always seemed to be under repeated instructions. He probed for information but dared not ask too much.

Now, passing through the deep blue Heaven-Guarding Formation of Five Waters, he landed back on Mount Qingdu. Li Xuanfeng stood with arms crossed in the grand hall, with Li Chengliao standing below him. Li Xijun took one look and spoke in a firm voice, "Ancestor, what is this!"

Li Xuanfeng had already advanced to the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm. His expression was no longer as deeply furrowed and heavy as before but had become cold and rigid. His chest armor was covered in glistening white blade marks and two pieces of his golden arm guard were shattered, revealing the gleaming silver interior.

A deep scar now ran along the side of his face, stretching from his jaw to his collarbone. The wound was a crystalline blood-red hue. It was glistening under the sunlight, indicating it had only recently begun to heal. It was a gruesome sight.

Li Xuanfeng hesitated for a moment before lightly waving his hand. He had originally concealed the wound with an illusion technique, but since Li Xijun had mastered the perception technique and saw through it instantly, he casually explained, "Just some minor wounds from dealing with a demonic beast."

Li Xuanfeng had spent decades slaughtering demons in the southern border. In the past ten years, he had also killed many people. His hands were drenched in blood. Though most were enemies or those deserving death, there were also innocent ones among them. Yet, with no choice, he steeled himself and carried out the killings.

Only a handful of families from that list had survived. The cunning and deceitful Xiao Family had sealed their mountain early, while the arrogant scion from Crimson Reef Island had his head taken by someone else. Nearly everyone else had been killed by his hand. The jade talisman bound with densely packed storage pouches was now stacked within his Eastern Sea cave dwelling.

Fortunately, this jade talisman was indeed extraordinary and the targets had been carefully selected. No one had discovered the truth and instead, conflicts among several families with Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators were provoked, leading to bloody feuds.

In the end, my hands are stained with filthy blood! thought Li Xuanfeng.

Li Xuanfeng's temperament was different from his elder brother Li Xuanxuan’s. The more bloodshed and enmity he faced, the more his resolve hardened like iron. His will was unyielding. The only time his will broke was when Li Tongya was killed. Now, the more he was tempered, the more unshakable he became.

He was not one to wallow in self-pity. He remembered both his grudges and debts with clarity, to the point that any sense of self-righteousness or arrogance had been thoroughly stripped away. What remained was a somber and profound realization, which lurked a faint, menacing indifference that made him seem less refined.

Seeing Li Xuanfeng’s guarded demeanor, Li Xijun dared not press further. He only sensed that something about Li Xuanfeng had changed. Just then, Li Xuanfeng changed the topic and asked, "The Ning Family has calculated it several times. After all this turmoil, Jiangnan is now a place of Upper Evil Spirit Storage, benefiting those cultivating Earth Virtue, devil cultivation, Water Mansion, and blood qi. It neither harms nor benefits our family, just something to be aware of."

Li Xijun nodded, assuming that Li Xizhi’s letter had also mentioned this. Then he heard Li Xuanfeng continue, "He has gone out less these past two years.. Zhouwei is naturally talented, so he doesn't need to rush within his sixty-year cultivation limit. Don’t let him focus solely on cultivation day after day. He should observe the world and see bloodshed. Otherwise, he might grow up twisted, becoming nothing more than a reckless fighter."

Li Xijun nodded. Just then, he saw Li Xuanfeng retrieve a jade slip from the beast-head ornament on his belt and softly said, "I selected this halberd technique after much deliberation. It was acquired by exchanging treasures I found from an Eastern Sea cave dwelling with one of the forces there. The more it's practiced, the more domineering it becomes. It seems well-suited for Zhouwei. Deliver it to him."

Li Xijun took it but hadn’t yet examined it when someone below reported, "My lord, Ancestor Fei Luoya has come to visit."

Li Chengliao, who had been listening attentively for a long time, seized this opportunity to interject, "Eighth Uncle, this man has come multiple times... You were in seclusion the previous times, so we had to send him away. This cultivator from Mount Yue isn't known for his patience, he’s starting to grow restless."

Li Xijun finally recalled this person. This Foundation Establishment cultivator of Mount Yue had long hoped to gain favor with the Li Family’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. This person had been half-heartedly dealt with since Li Yuanjiao's time.. Now, after decades, this old Mount Yue cultivator had actually reached the late stage of Foundation Establishment.

Li Xijun immediately turned to Li Xuanfeng and softly said, "This matter..."

Li Xuanfeng naturally understood. Currently, that man was the only one in the Li Family that was at Purple Mansion Realm. He nodded and said, "Let’s go take a look."

————

Li Xijun left Mount Qingdu and arrived at the hall. In the center, the Mount Yue cultivator stood with his hair disheveled and his hands behind his back. Despite wearing a Daoist robe, he had a fierce and menacing appearance and was standing coldly in the courtyard.

Upon seeing Li Xijun, his expression eased slightly, and he spoke in a deep voice, "Are you the one in charge now?"

Fei Luoya’s tone softened a little. He had met Li Tongya and Li Yuanjiao before. Over the past century, the Li Family had changed several elders, yet he had heard that all of them had died for their clan. Though he didn’t fully understand it, he held a certain respect for them and asked, "Has your esteemed family made any progress on the promise you made me years ago? I can’t stay by the lake any longer, I’ll be leaving in the next few days."

Li Xijun acknowledged his words first, then asked with some confusion, "Senior, why such a sudden decision?"

Had he not asked, it would have been fine. But the question made Fei Luoya glare at him and replied, "Zhu Xian is dead! He died so suddenly while he was out and his body wasn’t even found!"

Zhu Xian was one of Fei Luoya’s subordinates, he was at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Back in the day, Hooked Serpent Li Wushao had yet to grow back his twin-hooked tail, and his strength was similar to Zhu Xian’s. Though considered weak among Foundation Establishment cultivators, he was still a cultivator at that level. Yet now, without a sound, he was simply gone.

Fei Luoya continued, "Look around, the Golden Tang Gate’s young master is dead, Crimson Reef Island and the Great Xiukui Temple are at war. Cultivators from the Yue Cultivating Sect have stopped venturing outside, Golden Feather Sect and Mount Changhuai are constantly at odds and the Xiao Family has sealed their mountain in seclusion. This place may seem calm, but it's already caught in a storm!"

Fei Luoya spoke these words, but inwardly, he silently added, Your damned Li Family has severed ties with the Yuan Family, dismantled the Yu Family, and keeps producing Foundation Establishment cultivators. Your influence in the sect is rising rapidly, it’s only a matter of time before you set your sights on the lake. At least I won’t lose face if I leave early!

He paused for a moment before he spoke, "Besides... do you know what kind of spirit beast flew over the lake a few years ago?"

Hearing this, Li Xijun immediately became interested and asked, "My family has inquired far and wide but received no news. It seems that knowledge of such ancient beasts is still preserved in Mount Wu! I humbly ask for your guidance, senior!"

Although Fei Luoya was from Mount Yue, he had lived for over a century. Flattered by Li Xijun’s words, he remained composed and simply replied, "That was Weihou, a descendant of the Hongluan. It resides upon the Tongxin Tree of Mount Taishi. The mere sight of it invites calamity. Families will be torn apart and lives cast into endless exile. Leave sooner rather than later!"

Mount Yue cultivators were already highly superstitious about such omens. Now that Fei Luoya had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, he believed in them even more. With worry etched across his face, he continued, "It’s not just me, Fei Luoya. Jiao Zhongzi of Northern Mount Yue has been missing for years. He may have met a grim fate... Now, only Huo Luo'e in the south remains, secluded in cultivation like me."

Li Xijun listened intently. Back when Mount Wu was divided, four factions remained on the southern bank. Jiao Zhongzi was the strongest, occupying Mount Wu and establishing North Mount Yue. Fu Daimu took over Great Jueting but was later eradicated by Fei Luoya in alliance with the Li Family, and Great Jueting ultimately fell under Li Family control.

Looking at it now... the Foundation Establishment cultivators of Mount Yue, whom our elders once feared, have dwindled. Only Huo Luo'e, a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, remains. Taking control of all Mount Yue territories... doesn’t seem difficult anymore!

As he contemplated the population and spiritual resources of Mount Yue, his true desire lay in Mount Wu. Even if the cultivators at the Purple Mansion Realm had already scoured it clean, it had once been the palace of Duanmu Kui, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had dominated an era! If he could set foot there, he might unravel many mysteries.

While Li Xijun was lost in thought, Fei Luoya could no longer hold back and asked, "Your esteemed family should give me an answer!"

As soon as he spoke, he saw Li Xijun suddenly look past him, bow respectfully, and softly say, "Xijun greets the ancestor!"

Fei Luoya’s heart skipped a beat. His first thought was that Li Tongya was still alive! But when he extended his spiritual sense, he saw that a figure was approaching the hall at a steady pace.

The figure approaching had a cold face and white beard, his brows sharp as blades, broad shoulders, and a sturdy build. His dazzling Black Gold Spirit Armor shimmered brilliantly. Fei Luoya’s Immortal Foundation Untraceable Presence was highly attuned to reading the colors in others' eyes. But when he looked into this veteran’s gaze, it was like being pierced by twin swords. It seemed as if this old man had just slain a monstrous beast from the sea or killed an heir of an immortal sect, still carrying the lingering scent of blood.

Li Xuanfeng merely glanced at him coldly. Fei Luoya immediately turned around and cupped his hands in greeting, "So it is the Golden Bowstring Li Xuanfeng. I am Fei Luoya Greetings, General."

Li Xuanfeng’s reputation was at its peak. The direct disciples of Golden Feather Sect and Azure Pond Sect were all in seclusion,making progress in their cultivation. Meanwhile, he had made his name known with a single arrow strike against the Song Family, earning a reputation as the strongest cultivator below the Purple Mansion Realm.. Only a few others like Tang Shedu, Shen Xi, and Yuan Chengdun could compare to him. Although Fei Luoya was of an older generation, he did not dare act superior and instead addressed him as a peer.

Fei Luoya observed the veteran general, but Li Xuanfeng was also studying him, silently calculating, I’ve heard that his Immortal Foundation ability is Untraceable Presence. If he is more than a hundred miles away, he should be able to evade my first arrow and escape. But if not, I can take his head within twenty arrows.

Li Xuanfeng’s combat style was entirely different from that of ordinary cultivators. He never dragged battles out to a hundred exchanges. His bowstring technique was about piercing defenses and delivering swift, decisive kills, even at the cost of self-inflicted injury. If a fight lasted too long, he would be the one who couldn’t hold out.

Fei Luoya suddenly felt a chill on his neck, silently swallowed his saliva, and thought, This is the level of a true direct descendant of an immortal sect. Even if Jiao Zhongzi were here... he'd have no choice but to flee. I’ve heard he serves under Daoist Master Yuan Su. No wonder...

Li Xuanfeng took a few steps forward, stopping in front of him before asking, "I heard you seek refuge and wish to leave this place."

"That’s correct." Fei Luoya was overjoyed and bowed deeply, saying, "I hope the general will introduce me... I am willing to follow you and defend the southern border."

"Rise first." Li Xuanfeng simply said, "This matter can wait. First, tell me, where has Jiao Zhongzi gone?"

Fei Luoya was slightly startled but replied, "He should have fled to the Eastern Sea. I’ve checked multiple times, there’s no trace of him in North Mount Yue. There’s only a single early cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm left to guard the place..."

Li Xuanfeng knew that Jiao Zhongzi had already been at the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm many years ago and asked with doubt, "Did he break through to the Purple Mansion Realm?"

Fei Luoya shook his head and said in a low voice, "Duanmu Kui never left behind any methods at the Purple Mansion Realm, only methods at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Otherwise, Jiao Zhongzi wouldn’t have been so restless here. If he wants to seek a path forward, his only option is to head to the Eastern Sea."

Li Xuanfeng nodded in acknowledgment and finally said, "Recite your cultivation technique."

Li Xijun quickly took out a blank jade slip. Fei Luoya hesitated slightly but then nodded heavily. He took the jade slip, closed his eyes and concentrated deeply as he carefully engraved the technique.

A Foundation Establishment cultivator’s spiritual sense was swift. Within moments, Li Xijun received the jade slip from him, swept it with his spiritual sense and saw the title inscribed, The Concealment and Obfuscation Sutra.

This technique was of the third rank, containing over a hundred thousand words. The phrasing carried an ancient tone, showing that Mount Wu’s inheritance was indeed extraordinary. Surprisingly, it even included a complementary blade technique called Reflections on the Blood Court.

This blade technique seemed more like a collection of insights, it was highly profound. It was suited for those who practiced The Concealment and Obfuscation Sutra and had already attained significant mastery in blade arts. Since it was of no direct use to him, he silently put it away.

In order to assist the family, Li Xuanfeng had initially considered taking down a few Mount Yue cultivators while Daoist Master Yuan Su was still alive. But with the real concern Jiao Zhongzi now having fled, he said softly, "Since you have this intent, follow behind me for now and let's head to the southern border."

Fei Luoya nodded hastily. Li Xuanfeng allowed him to return to his cave dwelling to gather his belongings. Once seated again, Li Xijun said, "Fei Luoya has lived among our family for many years and has some sense about him. If he follows the second great uncle... he won’t be a burden."

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly and said in a quiet voice, "Qinghong is cultivating at sea, call Kongheng back. My task is nearly complete, and making a move myself is becoming troublesome. These minor Mount Yue cultivators... I leave them to you all."

"Yes!" replied Li Xijun.

Seeing Li Xijun respond, Li Xuanfeng said, "There will be changes ahead. It will no longer be suitable for me to remain in direct contact with the family, as I cannot oversee everything at once. I will watch from the shadows, I will act if there is anything I can assist with."

Li Xijun once again recalled the wound on his face and softly said, "Second great uncle, take care."

Li Xuanfeng dismissed the concern and paid it no mind. As Li Xijun cupped his hands in farewell, intending to summon Li Xuanxuan, Li Xuanfeng raised a hand to stop him and said, "Calling him is pointless, it would only disturb his state of mind. Just remind my elder brother to take care of himself."

His actions were decisive and unhesitating. Without delay, he boarded his jade boat and departed. Li Xijun returned to the hall, glanced at Li Chengliao, and asked, "How is Wei’er? Has he emerged from seclusion?"

Li Chengliao replied, "He has already exited seclusion and reached the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

Li Xijun nodded slightly, picked up his brush, dipped it in ink, and softly said, "Have the family prepare for the matters regarding Mount Yue. Once Kongheng returns, we will act. A month's time should be just right, and it's best to root them out completely."




# Chapter 673: Titled Minghuang

Morning.

The morning sunlight climbed the stone steps in segments, casting a golden hue over the two stone beasts at the entrance. The Li Family had commissioned artisans to craft these statues in the likeness of the Hooked Serpent, Li Wushao. The beast’ tails coiled tightly while its head held high.

Li Zhouwei emerged from the central hall, his brocade-lined golden boots clicking crisply against the ground. With a hand resting on the sword at his waist, he had matured significantly over the past few years. The innate aura he once carried had been restrained, no longer striking fear into those who beheld him.

Even the brilliance in his eyes had gradually faded, transforming into a distinctive shade of deep brown. The once-intimidating presence had seemingly vanished. He stepped forward lightly, and only in fleeting glances did a trace of cunning surface. Occasionally, his movements revealed a swiftness and agility that left others startled, making it hard to believe he was just a boy of eleven.

Chen Yang, clad in black armor, followed behind him. Li Zhouwei had grown taller over the years, now nearly matching his height. His expression remained unreadable as he silently trailed along. Upon reaching the main hall, he instinctively stopped outside and allowed Li Zhouwei to enter alone.

Li Chengliao was seated at the upper end of the hall, reading a letter. Seeing him approach, he smiled and said, "Wei’er, you’re here."

Li Zhouwei was now eleven years old and had reached the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Unlike other direct descendants who were sent to the mountain for cultivation, the Li Family had kept him focused on training halberd arts in the central hall. They feared that advancing too quickly would result in a weak foundation.

Yet, despite the lack of visible effort, he had recently spent a few days in seclusion and broken through to the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. His cultivation was progressing steadily and methodically.

Draped in a wolf-fur cloak, he exuded an imposing presence as he asked, "How are your eyes now?"

Seated firmly, Li Zhouwei answered, "It doesn’t turn gold if I do not make a move or lose my temper."

"Good," replied Li Chengliao.

Li Chengliao couldn’t quite understand how he had managed it but chose not to press the matter. Instead, he picked up a jade-bound cultivation manual from the desk and said softly, "Your uncle Xizhi recently returned home and obtained this perception technique for you. Take a look at it first."
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

Li Zhouwei strode forward and carefully took the manual. On its cover, the title read, The Grand Veined Golden Eyes.

Since Li Chengliao had suggested taking a look first, Li Zhouwei gently flipped through the pages in the hall and read it, "In the autumn of the fifth year of Wuming, I visited my friend Xuandou and met Yang Jinxin, a judge of hell. We had an engaging discussion, realizing that clarity and obscurity differ greatly, making true appearances difficult to perceive. Thus, I devised certain eye techniques and recorded them here..."

The introduction detailed the origins of the technique, followed by an extensive exposition of its practice. It primarily instructed on refining golden pupils by tempering the eyes with mana. A process that, in ancient times, required only twenty years to complete.

The best results could be achieved by acquiring a spiritual qi known as Bright Eve Qi, which would then significantly shorten the training period. Upon closer inspection, the final inscription bore the name Cui Yan.

Li Zhouwei glanced briefly at it, while Li Chengliao softly explained, "I have inquired about Cui Yan. It is said that he was a Golden Core cultivator of the Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion in the Wei State, known as True Monarch Shangyao. This perception technique was likely created in his early years. It is not of high grade and it’s only third-rank. But it should be good enough to conceal your eyes."

As Li Chengliao spoke, he motioned for Li Zhouwei to sit down and continued, "Only techniques obtained from these grotto heavens come with such detailed records of their origins. If this were an ordinary Jiangnan spell, would it even have a signature? Most of them have long since been lost to time."

Seeing Li Zhouwei nod in understanding, he picked up a book and a jade slip from the table and said softly, "As for this, it is a halberd art that elder Xuanfeng acquired from overseas. It was originally recorded within this jade slip, but since you have not yet developed spiritual sense, I have transcribed it for you. There is a copied version and the original, and both are included."

Li Zhouwei received it carefully and offered a formal bow in gratitude, saying, "Thank you, Father."

He glanced at the cover of the halberd manual, which read, The Armor Cycle Soul-Refining Halberd Art

Rather than immediately reading the book in the grand hall, Li Zhouwei changed the topic and asked, "I know a little about the history of the Great Wei, but only in fragmented accounts. How many True Monarchs were there? Has the family gathered any information?"

Li Chengliao was somewhat surprised by the sudden inquiry but responded, "Our family has learned some details over the years. In ancient times, Golden Core cultivators roamed the world, and Dao Embryos cultivators walked freely. The inland regions were several times larger than they are today, and the overseas territories were dozens of times greater. The Wei State produced several True Monarchs. Two from the Cui Family, one of whom was Shangyao Cui Yan. As for the Li Family, we had the Great Ancestor and the Yuan Emperor...

Li Zhouwei interjected, "Four True Monarchs."

Li Chengliao nodded in agreement and continued in a low voice, "After the Wei State fell, the succeeding states of Qi, Liang, Zhao, and Yan had emperors with progressively weaker cultivation. By the end, only Emperor Zhaowu of Zhao State had reached the level of a True Monarch. As for the present day, the state has fractured into regional divisions. There are no longer any so-called immortal states."

Li Zhouwei listened and nodded slightly. Seeing that he was lost in thought and had no intention of asking further, Li Chengliao smiled and said, "Let me introduce someone to you."

As his words fell, a wisp of gray mist rose from the side of the hall, swirling before taking the form of a man in gray robes. His face was sharp and menacing, and he knelt on one knee, speaking in a hoarse voice, "Wushao greets the heir."

Li Zhouwei nodded in return, while Li Chengliao said, "This is Senior Wushao, a cultivator at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. The family has specially assigned him to protect you."

For years, Li Wushao had been cultivating at the bottom of the lake, gradually gathering demons at the Qi Cultivation Realm as his subordinates to oversee the lake for him. This allowed him to avoid daily management tasks, appearing at the lake only occasionally. Originally, he had followed Li Yuexiang. But now that Li Xizhi had come to take his sister away, Li Xijun had ordered him to come down from the mountain.

Li Zhouwei gestured for him to rise. Li Wushao gave a crisp salute without a word and quickly faded into the shadows of the hall. The young heir observed him carefully for a moment before looking up at Li Chengliao and asking, "It seems the family has matters arranged."

"Indeed." Li Chengliao said, "You are growing older. When your great uncle Yuanping was your age, he had already assumed leadership of the family. You also possess the Bright Yang Dao Lineage and there are few true talents in the main family. This means that you will undoubtedly take on the household’s responsibilities in the future."

"I plan to choose a location in Mount Yue. You will take some troops there, and this will be a good opportunity to train your halberd arts. When the time comes, you will experience bloodshed firsthand."

The Li Family had always upheld this tradition of succession. Neither father nor son showed any surprise. Li Zhouwei nodded, tucking the items into his sleeve as he prepared to leave. Just then, Li Chengliao called out to him.

The young head, who was draped in wolf fur and exuding an innate charisma, smiled faintly and said in a soft voice, "After careful deliberation, the family has chosen to uphold tradition—not to address you by name, but to bestow upon you a Dao title... or rather, a noble title."

Li Zhouwei raised his brows with interest, a hint of cunning flashing in his eyes as he smiled and asked, "What title has the family chosen?"

Li Chengliao appeared pleased, laughing heartily twice before carefully writing down two characters on a piece of xuan paper. He lifted it gently and said, "Minghuang[1]."

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly, resting a hand on the sword at his waist and tilting his chin downward. His expression was not so much one of satisfaction as it was a sense of ease, like a beast discovering a suitable cave to rest in.

"Hmmm," the teen mused before bursting into a resonant laugh, the light in his eyes flickering in sync with his voice.

The grand hall gradually filled with the fragrant scent of peonies, accompanied by the soft rustling of fluttering wings.

Buzz... buzz... buzz...

The golden morning sun climbed the stone steps even faster now, slithering like a serpent as it weaved through the grand hall. Its brilliance intensified, radiating with such dazzling light that Chen Yang, who was standing outside, had to shut his eyes against the glare.

1. The characters used are 明煌 which means Bright Radiant. It can also mean wise and dazzling. I assume it has something to do with his cultivation because these characters are present in the Bright Yang Pass and Radiant Essence Scripture. Time will tell as to what it truly means ☜




# Chapter 674: Dili Family

Li Xijun had been waiting for two months when the narrow-eyed monk descended with the wind in front of the peak. Due to the newly replaced grand formation, he couldn't enter the mountain gate and could only wait in silence.

Seeing Li Xijun approaching in white robes, Kongheng remained composed, pressed his palms together, and softly said, "I heard that you successfully reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, a result of good karma. Congratulations."

Back then, Li Xijun had let him go and allowed him to seize the opportunity for a breakthrough. Kongheng was truly grateful. After offering his congratulations, he heard Li Xijun say, "Master Monk, you must be joking. What kind of good karma could come from my handling of Qingdu’s affairs? My family doesn’t believe in retribution... If such a thing truly existed, we could just sit and wait for it instead of being so fixated."

"This humble monk apologies," Kongheng chanted a Buddhist phrase.He then landed on the mountain and looked around curiously. Li Xijun led him along the mountain path and softly said, "This time, I’ve asked you to return so we can trouble you to take action and sweep the Mount Yue clean."

Li Xijun had already investigated thoroughly and added, "You, I, and Ximing will take action together to eliminate two individuals and one demon."

Li Xijun pointed toward Northern Mount Yue and said, "Jiao Zhongzi has gone missing, but in his absence, an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator named Mu Moli remains in Mount Yue. He is said to be fiercely loyal to Jiao Zhongzi and is guarding Northern Mount Yue alongside his Foundation Establishment Realm mount."

He circled that area with an ink brush and explained, "If this person is as described, there will be no room for negotiation. We must deal with him swiftly and root him out completely."

He then pointed to the remaining area in the south and continued in a low voice, "There is also a Huo Luo'e, who is at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm. If he can be persuaded to surrender, we should try. If not, we will besiege and kill him!"

The Li Family now had the foundation to back such words. Had this been twenty or thirty years earlier, they would have been laughed at. But at this moment, his words carried undeniable weight.

After Li Xijun finished speaking, Kongheng slowly closed his eyes and responded, "It seems bloodshed is inevitable!"

Li Xijun led him into the hall, placed the map down, and consoled him. He said, "These people from Mount Yue and Mount Wu are nothing good. No matter how many times we purge them, it will never be clean. Master Monk, you worry too much."

Kongheng simply looked at the densely packed village and tribe names on the map and replied, "I understand... but as your esteemed family’s forces march through, I wonder how many heads will roll and how much blood will stain Northern Mount Yue. I fear the number will not be a pleasant one."

Li Xijun furrowed his brows, momentarily speechless. Northern Mount Yue was filled with esteemed landlords and it was absolutely impossible for the Li Family to tolerate them all. Even if the killings weren’t thorough, it would still hinder future governance. How could they not kill? He could only say, "My family does not trouble the common folk. Once the pigs and dogs have been slaughtered, only then can those below have better days ahead!"

Kongheng, being an ancient cultivator, did not approve but could only agree. Only then did Li Xijun continue, "This time, I have been waiting for you because I have a matter to ask."

He had been observing Kongheng’s expression all morning and softly said, "Northern Mount Yue is different from Eastern Mount Yue. It is the ancestral land of the Yue people. Many evil shrines are hidden in the mountains, and its people have been deeply poisoned. When Jianixi was still around, there were constant uprisings. I fear this is not something that can be solved by mere slaughter."

"Master Monk, you are the most capable of swaying people's hearts in this world. Do you have a way?"

Li Xijun was thinking of things from a long-term perspective. The esteemed landlords of Northern Mount Yue were merely a matter of execution and sending people over to replace them.

However, Northern Mount Yue was the ancestral land of the Yue people and the cult of sorcery was deeply ingrained in their hearts. Human sacrifices were common and over a hundred thousand cult followers were spread across the land, with ninety-nine percent of them being mere mortals. After much thought, Li Xijun realized that the easiest way to resolve this was through Kongheng.

After Li Xijun explained everything, Kongheng’s face was filled with even greater guilt as he responded, "Using spell arts, divine abilities, Daoist scriptures, or worldly temptations to make people obey is the highest form of heresy. My Liao River Temple must not partake in such things! I am deeply ashamed!"

It was clear that asking Kongheng to sway these cult follower violated his precepts. He once again tactfully refused. Li Xijun was not too surprised by this answer and could only say with a sigh, "Then let them be killed!"

"Ah!" Kongheng was momentarily stunned but quickly reacted with a bitter smile. He responded, "Li Xijun, don't try to fool me. I have cultivated among the esteemed families for many years and I know them well."

Li Xijun chuckled and reassured him, saying, "The decline of the Liao River Dao lineage is partly due to such rigid adherence to rules... How can it possibly sustain itself if it remains so inflexible?"

Kongheng closed his eyes and replied, "The Seven Northern Dao Sects were once no different from my Liao River Temple. Yet, by opening just a single crack, they gradually became what they are today... My temple does not strive to endure but to uphold what is true."

Li Xijun said with a sigh, "If that is the case, what about the millions of common folk in the north?"

Kongheng was momentarily speechless with beads of sweat appearing on his forehead.

Li Xijun feared he might push Kongheng toward siding with the Seven Dao Sects. So he said no more about it and instead smiled. "Then, Master Monk, you only need to assist me in eliminating these few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators."

Li Xijun kept smilingas he gently set down the brush in his hand and continued, "The matters below the mountain shall be left to my family's child prodigy."

Great Jueting.

Fei Luoya’s territory was vast. Though it was mostly hilly, the plains around Great Jueting provided some stability. Over the years, as it came under Li Family rule, the population steadily grew to around fifty thousand.

Now that Fei Luoya had left with Li Xuanfeng, the land had fully fallen into the hands of the Li Family. Along with this shift, many Mount Yue cultivators either departed or pledged allegiance to the Li Family.

On the roads of Great Jueting, cavalry and soldiers galloped forward in an overwhelming procession. At the center of it all was a black carriage, glimmering with mystical light.

Black banners fluttered in the air, while the carriage wheels carved long tracks into the muddy ground. Chen Yang watched as the glow from the mountain peaks faded and lifted the curtain, speaking softly, "My heir, we have arrived at Great Jueting."

Inside the carriage, the young man sat cloaked in a heavy cloak with his boots propped on a cooled brazier. He carefully read the scroll in his hands while Chen Yang kept his head lowered respectfully and dared not steal a glance at the contents of the book.

The Jade Capital Chakra of the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm was a major bottleneck in cultivation. Over the past two years, he had only barely grasped its edges. In the meantime Li Zhouwei had already caught up to him in cultivation.

Back when they first met and fought, it could be said that he had acted hastily. Li Zhouwei had relied on his weapon's advantage to subdue him. Now, however, Li Zhouwei’s halberd arts had grown exceptionally refined. It far surpassed his own half-baked swordsmanship. In daily sparring, he was no longer a match and dared not act rashly.

Upon hearing his words, Li Zhouwei closed his book and stepped forward in the carriage. Looking carefully ahead, he saw the towering, ancient city standing before them.

The city gates, bearing the mottled scars of time, stood wide open. On either side of the road, countless esteemed families of Mount Yue knelt in submission with their heads lowered. Many had even styled their hair in the fashion of easterners, whispering among themselves as they kneeled.

He stood in silence for a moment before giving the order. "Enter the city."

As soon as Li Zhouwei's words fell, the carriage did not slow before the kneeling esteemed families of Mount Yue. Instead, it sped past them and charged straight into the city. On the way, the carriage splashed up high sprays of muddy water which caused the crowd to scatter and retreat.

Li Zhouwei remained silent while his Family soldiers marched in coldly, sealing off both sides of the road completely.

Standing at the front of the carriage, Chen Yang gazed at the sea of bowed heads below. A surge of satisfaction rose in his heart. However, now that he was fully aligned with Li Zhouwei, his cunning nature resurfaced. He reminded Li Zhouwei, saying, "My heir, you have less than a month to recruit troops here... You may still need to rely on these people. It might be worth pulling a few to our side."

Chen Yang’s words were quite reasonable. These people were all the descendants of Fei Luoya’s former subordinates. They held influence and prestige in the region. For decades, they had exploited the common folk while each controlled their own factions. The Li Family’s power was certainly above them but if they could secure their cooperation, integration would be much smoother.

After all, Li Chengliao had not provided any spirit items or provisions for this campaign. Great Jueting was already their territory. If they still required family support to raise an army here, it would undoubtedly be a sign of incompetence.

Just as Chen Yang finished speaking, he heard the rustling sound of Li Zhouwei lifting the curtain behind him, followed by the heir’s cold reply, "They are all doomed men. No need to bother with them."

Chen Yang raised an eyebrow slightly. His mind turned and quickly grasped the meaning. He replied with a smile, "Understood."

Li Zhouwei stepped out of the carriage, silently gazing at the grand city before him. He walked into the lavish yet aging main hall and stopped beside the towering throne.

He tapped his brocade boots twice against the floor, then stepped up beside the throne. He casually glanced around before turning back and said, "None of the twenty-one esteemed families in this city are innocent. Kill them all. Distribute their wealth to our forces and recruit a batch of men first."

Chen Yang nodded, but Li Zhouwei stared at him for a moment, thinking to himself, Father said this man is cunning and bold but lacks the ability to command true loyalty. If I let him go alone, resentment may rise and he might stir up a mutinous force.

Feeling uneasy about Chen Yang, Li Zhouwei took the halberd from the carriage and donned his armor. He shook out the robe behind him, mounted his horse, and said with a frown, "You will come with me."

Chen Yang mounted his horse and followed behind Li Zhouwei. Li Zhouwei pulled out a roster and selected a family with many followers but in a weakened state. Gripping the reins of his spirit horse, he called out loudly, "To the Dili Family!"

The city’s roads were uneven and full of potholes, but his heavy-set Zhongsuo spirit horse moved as if on flat ground and swiftly galloped out of the city.

In less than fifteen minutes, he reached a large village near the city’s edge. From afar, he could see people moving in and out. He reined in his horse, waiting for the guards to catch up before pulling his reins tighter and gazing toward the settlement.

Barbarians must be ruled by barbarians. To control them, one must have trusted subordinates with many followers. Yet those born into lowly and impoverished backgrounds should serve as the blade.

————

Dili Family Village.

Dili Youjie had spent the entire night in anxiety. Early in the morning, he was already pacing anxiously in front of the village. The bow and beast bones at his waist clang noisily, revealing his unease.
𝒇𝒓𝙚𝒆𝔀𝓮𝓫𝒏𝓸𝙫𝓮𝓵.𝓬𝙤𝙢

His Dili Family had cultivated this land for years, boasting a large population and many warriors. Yet they lacked enough shamans. This branded them as an inferior caste, forcing them to settle outside the city and provide a steady supply of sacrifices to Fu Daimu.

When this land later fell under Fei Luoya's rule, years of chaotic mismanagement caused the Dili Family to miss their opportunity for advancement. Leaving them as lowly outcasts again. However, after the transition to the Li Family, life improved significantly.

The reason was simple. Previously, the Li Family had little direct control over Great Jueting. Since most of Fei Luoya’s subordinates had settled here, the Li Family refrained from interfering too much. They were merely sending officials to survey and allocate spirit fields. It was more of a vassalage than actual rule.

But this morning, upon hearing that Li Family’s troops had entered the city, Dili Youjie found himself unable to gain an audience. Aside from growing restless within the village, he was truly at a loss for what to do.

Clop! Clop! Clop!

As the long-haired warrior was lost in thought, a sudden roar of thunderous sounds jolted him awake. As someone who had wielded strong bows and ridden fierce horses among the Mount Yue people, how could he not recognize that sound? He stiffened slightly, his expression turning to alarm. He muttered, "Cavalry?"

He abruptly lifted his head, hastily unfastening a horn from his waist. But before he could sound it, a deafening boom rang out. Above the ten-foot-tall village gate, a dark shadow soared through the sky, blocking out the blazing sun and casting a writhing silhouette below.

Dili Youjie caught a fleeting glimpse of a gleaming halberd slicing through the air. The blackened-gray armor made a harsh metallic sound and gleamed with an iron sheen of a quality Mount Yue had been unable to forge for generations.

Hsshhh...

As the hooves landed, sand and dust burst into the air, mingling with the chaotic snorts and neighs of the spirit horse. The people within the Dili village stared in shock, their minds momentarily blank. Even Dili Youjie who was usually resolute, unconsciously took a step back and his stern face turned pale.

Clang!

The halberd struck the ground, gleaming coldly through the dust. Before he could see the man clearly, a deafening clash of metal rang out. The village gate was torn to shreds. Armored eastern soldiers that were disciplined and orderly, flowed in like a relentless tide.

A few members of the Dili Family attempted resistance, but they were as helpless as lambs before these men and were subdued in mere moments. Dili Youjie immediately recognized them as the Li Family’s troops and dared not resist. He clenched his fists as he stood frozen in place.

"Ugh..."

With a heavy thud, Dili Youjie was pressed to the ground by several jade-armored soldiers. Amid the clanking of metal, cold blades pressed tightly against his neck. Their gleaming edges were sharp and menacing. More than a dozen iron spears encircled him, leaving him utterly immobilized.

In mere moments, the entire Dili Family was under control. Kneeling on the ground with disheveled hair, Dili Youjie dared not move an inch. He felt an icy chill creeping over his body.

The scorching sunlight cast a golden glow before him. Beads of sweat that were the size of soybeans dripped steadily onto the ground. Adjusting his posture slowly, Dili Youjie raised his head and met a pair of narrow eyes tinged with a faint golden hue.

The young man gave him a casual glance before surveying the surroundings, seemingly assessing the number of men present. Then, he lifted the silk document in his hand and read aloud, "Dili... Youjie?"

The voice was calm, carrying the clarity of youth. Dili Youjie, one of the most skilled hunters among the families within five kilometers and a young leader feared by many, found himself unable to meet the youth’s gaze. Hoarsely, he replied, "I pay my respects to the immortal family... My lord."

Sweat poured down his face as that gaze forced him to lower his head. With cold steel pressed against his throat, he did not dare to move. From behind, another man dismounted from his spirit horse. His expression was icy as he circled around Dili Youjie.

With long brows and gray-black eyes, the man studied Dili Youjie with an indifferent gaze, as if weighing his worth like that of a mere livestock. In a low voice, the man asked, "Your Highness... Is this man worth using?"

The youth on horseback did not answer immediately. Instead, he chuckled and asked, "Dili Youjie, the letter says you are young and capable. I am offering you an overwhelming fortune, will you take it?"

Dili Youjie had always been decisive, but never had his mind felt so clear. In a flash, he pieced everything together and responded with a trembling voice, "I give my thanks to the heir!"

Finally, he gathered the courage to meet those eyes. The eyes that were seemingly born to manipulate hearts. A dark golden hue flowed within them, sending a chill down his legs.

As Dili Youjie listened, the youth tugged his reins and the iron hooves struck the ground rhythmically. With a flick of his whip, he nudged aside the cold blade at his throat and said with amusement, "Gather your Dili Family. Ride into the city and kill!"




# Chapter 676: Undefeated King of Brightness

Dili Youjie slowly lifted his head as the glint of cold steel and blades around him withdrew. At last, he had a chance to rise to his feet and vaguely make out the face of the heir.

Li Zhouwei turned his horse and rode off, his Jade Court Guards following suit as they withdrew from the village. Only the family soldiers remained, standing in rigid formation on both sides. Yet, one figure remained unmoved—the cold, calculating young man stood there with his arms crossed, watching Dili Youjie with an unreadable expression.

The young man was Chen Yang. Chen Yang thought to himself, A lucky barbarian...

Chen Yang came from the prestigious Chen family, one of the most prominent surnames among the eastern towns. He bore the blood of the Li Family on his mother’s side.. Though he followed Li Zhouwei closely in battle, he was still considered a son of an esteemed family back in the eastern towns. Seeing himself as a celestial descendant, he inherently looked down on these barbarians.

Li Zhouwei had an uncanny ability to see through people's hearts, so in his presence, Chen Yang would tuck away his claws and behave obediently in front of him. But now that Li Zhouwei was gone, he reverted to his usual self.

He studied Dili Youjie carefully with his gray-black eyes before stepping forward to help him up. His expression changed faster than a page turning, and he said with a grin, "Brother Dili! I am Chen Yang. Now that we are working together, I look forward to learn from you."

Dili Youjie quickly lowered his head, adopting a humble demeanor, and replied softly, "Senior, I will follow your guidance entirely!"

Chen Yang nodded. His smile was warm and enthusiastic, as if they were real friends. He said with a chuckle, "The twenty-one esteemed families in the city have long oppressed the common folk. The heir has made it clear they need not be spared. I will take the troops over, but as for gathering forces, recording their crimes, organizing the family warriors, and placing trusted men... I suppose I don’t need to teach you how to handle that, do I?"

Dili Youjie respectfully responded, "I will make sure everything is handled properly."

Chen Yang warmly took his hand, pulling him onto the horse before letting go. In a hushed tone, he said, "Brother Dili, these twenty-one esteemed families have a considerable number of members and external cultivators. I ask that you check the records thoroughly..."

Chen Yang, dressed in black, feigned a playful yet fearful expression as he leaned in and whispered, "Make sure not a single person or horse is overlooked... The heir lives high in the celestial mountains and fears no vengeance, but you and I have families. We cannot afford to play games with the revenge of a fallen bloodline!"
𝘧𝓇ℯ𝑒𝓌𝑒𝑏𝓃𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝒸ℴ𝓂

Dili Youjie squinted slightly and said with a nod, "I understand!"

As the two walked into the city, they saw weapons gleaming coldly everywhere. Chen Yang spoke in cold tone, "Then, please proceed."

Dili Youjie immediately understood. He unfastened the horn from his waist and brought it to his lips, blowing into it through his mustache.

Riding forward, Dili Youjie saw the shock on the plump faces of the city’s esteemed families as his family warriors streamed in. A burning sense of dominance surged within him. It was like fine wine intoxicating his heart, sending him into a euphoric daze.

Dili Youjie thought, The Yedun Family robbed mine two years ago. Their heads go first.

—--—--—--

While Great Jueting was engulfed in the chaos of war, Northern Mount Yue remained eerily silent.

Located next to Great Jueting, Northern Mount Yue was bordered by a mountain range. Beyond it lay two vast plains that were densely populated. Li Xijun and Kongheng rode the wind and landed upon one of the great mountains.

According to Fei Luoya, Jiao Zhongzi was proud and ambitious. He cultivated an extremely difficult technique that did not rely much on blood qi. As a result, Northern Mount Yue had a thriving population. Just the plain beneath their feet housed over ten thousand people, with numerous villages and fortresses spread across the land.

Li Xijun observed carefully. At the same time, Li Ximing also arrived on a radiant gust of wind. As a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, his presence was imposing. His Daoist robe billowed, exuding an ethereal elegance.

Li Xijun spoke softly, "There is only one matter at hand... Although Jiao Zhongzi has disappeared, his subordinate Mu Moli and his Foundation Establishment mount are still in Northern Mount Yue. We must first surround and eliminate these two.

"According to Fei Luoya, Mu Moli cultivates the Morning Listening technique. It is an ancient art that allows him to perceive any unfavorable words spoken within a fifty-kilometers radius. We must not get too close to Mount Wu, or he may hear us."

The three of them needed no further speculation as it was almost certain that Mu Moli was in Mount Wu. However, they did not know if he had any hidden reinforcements there and could only hope to lure him out.

Li Ximing responded, "If Mu Moli is truly loyal, he will not sit idly by while Northern Mount Yue falls into our hands. A simple visit to the Northern Mount Yue royal court should be enough to force him out."

Li Xijun gently shook his head, turned to Kongheng, and spoke in a low voice, "This matter should be postponed for now. The shamanic spells that the people of Mount Yue use are strange and unpredictable and my family has suffered losses before. This time, I must trouble Master Monk to look after our heir."

Kongheng quickly waved his hand, closing his eyes as he replied softly, "Li Xijun, please command as you see fit. I have long held a hollow title without fulfilling my duties and my heart is already burdened with guilt."

Li Xijun withdrew his gaze from the distance and looked into Kongheng’s eyes with a calm expression, "This time, I ask Master Monk to first take a look at our heir."

The group rode the wind together, while Kongheng, deep in thought, asked, "This Morning Listening of the Mount Yue bears some resemblance to a certain mind-reading technique within Buddhist cultivation. If we gain anything from this encounter, I would like to examine that technique."

"That won’t be a problem at all," Li Xijun responded casually. However, he suddenly recalled a fragment of his family's history and thought, I once heard that within the demon dens of Mount Dali, there is a great demon capable of hearing events from a thousand miles away... It must be of the same Dao lineage as Morning Listening!

—--—--—--

As the sun set, the sky turned a hazy red, with drifting crimson clouds. The sounds of shouting in the city gradually faded, leaving behind a heavy silence.

The villages surrounding Great Jueting shut their gates tightly and not a single soul dared to step outside. Beneath the ancient city walls, doors remained firmly shut while the streets ran slick with blood.

Throughout history, this ancient city had fallen into the hands of many rulers, and each time, slaves and commoners were sacrificed to welcome a new ruler. But for the first time, it was the esteemed families and shamans being slaughtered, lending an air of grim novelty. The resistance had been particularly fierce.

Cultivators filled the sky, watching as the desperate struggled in vain. A few esteemed families and shamans attempted to take flight. But they were struck down and their bodies were smashed into pulp upon impact.

Chen Yang stepped out of the courtyard with his men. Severed heads, bone ornaments, and feathers lay scattered everywhere. Dozens of family soldiers carried heads into the courtyard. Chen Yang walked over the bloodied ground and wiped the blood from his left hand before saying with a grin, "This man was a lecher. Twenty-seven concubines and over a hundred female slaves... Even after years of drought, he still hoarded this much grain..."

The soldiers of the Dili Family looked uneasy. Even these hardened men had been shaken by how Chen Yang personally butchered everyone in the courtyard without hesitation and not a single one dared to respond. Chen Yang raised an eyebrow and asked, "Was I wrong to kill them?"

"It was... of course, it was necessary!" Dili Youjie answered quickly. His impression of Chen Yang had shifted. He had thought that Chen Yang was merely a scheming youth, but now he realized that Chen Yang was a ruthless and bloodthirsty man. Quietly, he became more cautious.

Dili Youjie checked the records, and confirmed that all members of every esteemed family in the Great Jueting had been wiped out. Their lineages were now severed, ensuring there would be no Qi Cultivators for at least several decades. The Li Family wouldn't care; if anything, it made ruling easier. Still, the sheer scale of the slaughter made Dili Youjie’s scalp tingle. He was secretly relieved that he had survived.

Chen Yang glanced at the troops on either side and ordered, "Send men to seize the two granaries... Wait."

His gaze darkened as he fell into thought, The Dili Family will bear the resentment. I, Chen Yang, will bear the sin of killing, but the Li Family must be seen as the benefactor. If anything is mishandled, Li Zhouwei will sneer at my incompetence.

He gazed at the pool of blood before him with appreciation and murmured, "Gather all these items and deliver them to the army."

After speaking, he kicked aside the severed head of a beautiful woman as if it were nothing more than a discarded gourd. Then, turning to Dili Youjie with a warm smile, he warmly patted Dili Youjie on the shoulder and said, "Brother Dili... Haha! General Dili, I must trouble you to present these goods and come with me to see the heir!"




# Chapter 679: Conqueror of the Pass

In the darkness of the night, every household in Great Jueting City had shut their doors. Earlier, the esteemed families had been massacred and the blood had yet to be washed away. It left the city as silent as a grave.

Amidst the darkness, the elite family troops and Jade Court Guards were secretly withdrawn. They disguised themselves as Mount Yue warriors, and quickly assembled. By the time Dili Youjie's forces left the city, three hundred soldiers were already standing before the formation like ghosts.

Under the night sky, Li Zhouwei stood clad in iron armor. A crimson cloud pearl at his waist glowed faintly, while his halberd rested against the ground. Beneath him, his spirit horse at the peak stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, Zhongsuo, gazed sharply into the distance with its eyes gleaming with intelligence.

As a group of Mount Yue warriors slowly took their positions before him, Li Zhouwei’s halberd began to glow with a faint red light.

The Armor Cycle Soul-Refining Halberd Art

This halberd art was brought back from the Eastern Sea by Li Xuanfeng. It was written by a long-forgotten general of the ancient Liang State and was an exceptionally old halberd art. As its name suggests, it was more than just a technique or skill. This was the art of halberd.However, it was an art, not merely a martial skill.

The essence of this halberd art lay in soul refinement. Each time an army was overturned, a sect annihilated, or a formation shattered, the halberd art would grow stronger. From the moment one began to learn it, dark shadows would shroud the halberd. When one mastered this halberd art to its fullest extent, it would summon raging soul phantoms, unleashing immense power.

As for its rank, it was impossible to evaluate like most ancient techniques. It did not seem to belong to the traditional Purple Mansion or Golden Core Dao system, making it even harder to classify. However, anyone who could execute the moves of a halberd art that had been refined through multiple combats and honed by warfare would undoubtedly be a powerful force in leading soldiers on the battlefield.

The red glow flickered quietly in the night, causing the Mount Yue warriors to glance up in alarm. As more eyes turned toward him, the red light on Li Zhouwei’s halberd intensified. He spoke in a deep voice, "Dili Youjie! Lead the troops forward slowly and don't cause any unnecessary disturbance. Hold position before Chan Pass and do not engage. Wait for my command at daybreak."

Dili Youjie knelt down steadily while Li Zhouwei spurred his horse forward. The family troops disappeared into the distance like the wind. As Dili Youjie stood up, he heard the murmuring voices of his subordinates below. "Jianixi..."

Dili Youjie was shocked and dared not let such talk spread. His voice was sharp as he rebuked them, "What nonsense are you spouting?! That is..."

However, with Li Zhouwei’s strict orders in mind, Dili Youjie dared not reveal that Zhouwei was the heir of the Li Family. He could only say, "We follow the king into the pass. Once we breach it and push north, the king’s title will be proclaimed. When we take the royal court of Northern Mount Yue, you and I shall be of esteemed lineage!"

Having voiced his ambitions, the Mount Yue warriors around him widened their eyes in shock.

To the north. Li Zhouwei’s horse galloped swiftly like a falling star, while Kongheng followed at an unhurried pace. The young man tilted his head slightly and asked, "Master Monk, how many people still recognize the name Undefeated King Of Brightness today?"

Kongheng shook his head slightly and replied, "This name has been transliterated multiple times from the language of the northern ethnic minorities and it has long been forgotten. Even if some recognize the title King of Brightness, they wouldn’t know how many times the title has changed. It is simply how we of Liao River refer to it."

"Good." Li Zhouwei responded with a single word, already grasping the situation. He mused, "It seems Bright Yang has been lost for many years. Its records and descriptions are completely erased... That is a good thing."

As he spoke, Chan Pass swiftly came into view. The green stone walls, darkened by the night, looked somber and foreboding. He glanced at it twice before instructing someone to step forward and speaking in a low voice, "Knock on the gate."

A man beside Li Zhouwei reined in his horse. He had thick brows, large eyes, and unkempt hair. He was Dili Youjie’s younger brother, who had come along as a guide for the Li Family. Lowering his head to listen, he heard Li Zhouwei speak softly, "Tell them that Great Jueting is slaughtering the esteemed families and that we have fled to seek refuge with the remnants of Northern Mount Yue. Say that this troop consists of direct descendants. As long as they let us in, we will offer our family's spirit items in full."

The Dili Family man nodded and quickly advanced. Li Zhouwei simply sat atop his horse in silence, completely unbothered. The disparity in strength and intelligence between the two sides was too vast and this deception was merely a way to save time.

After all, from Northern Mount Yue’s perspective, if this were truly the Li Family, why would they bother with such elaborate schemes? A direct assault by Foundation Establishment cultivators would have sufficed. Naturally, they would never suspect the Li Family.

Behind him, Li Wushao clearly shared the same thought. After a brief wait, he spoke in a sinister tone, "My heir... why don’t I just smash through this pass and storm in at once?"

Li Zhouwei gently shook his head.

In the darkness, Chen Yang lay low on his horse, seemingly piecing things together in his mind. It seems he wants Chan Pass intact, to make it appear as if the Dili Family is invading from the north... to avoid alerting the enemy?

While Chen Yang was deep in thought, a large basket was lowered from above. A young warrior of the Dili FAmily knelt and said, "Master, the garrison commander says the troops must wait outside. Only the one in charge may step forward."

Chen Yang remarked with a small grunt, "They’re somewhat cautious."

Li Zhouwei spoke in a low, mocking tone, "I doubt he’s just after these spirit items!"

Chen Yang chuckled softly, playing along. "He’s most likely planning to offer up the heads of these remnants to curry favor with the Li Family!"

Li Zhouwei planted his halberd firmly into the ground and tilted his head slightly as he said, "Senior Wushao, I’ll have to trouble you. Spare the garrison commander’s life. I still have use for him."

Li Wushao nodded slowly before drifting weightlessly into the basket. The rope above jerked as if pulled up hastily, making the entire scene seem somewhat ironic.

Once Li Wushao infiltrated their ranks, Chen Yang silently counted to seventeen before the pass’s grand formation was suddenly deactivated. The gates swung open, revealing a group of Mount Yue warriors kneeling inside. As Li Zhouwei rode forward, the cultivators on either side stepped back, revealing the blood-soaked ground beneath them.

Heads rolled across the ground.

The garrison commander trembled violently, presenting his bone sword with both hands. Li Zhouwei did not take it but instead ascended the pass step by step. In the distance, the Dili Family’s forces had begun to appear.

Only then did Li Zhouwei take a glance at the man from Mount Yue, who had been frightened out of his wits. The man was merely at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. After witnessing Li Wushao’s skills, he collapsed onto the ground and kowtowed repeatedly as he pleaded, "Greetings, Great King! Greetings, Great King! Du Dou is willing to serve under you and gather forces on your behalf!"

Li Zhouwei remained silent, his gaze causing Du Dou to break out in a cold sweat. When Dili Youjie rushed up onto the pass, the young heir simply waved his hand and spoke softly, "Revolt."

Chen Yang nodded while his mind was already forming a clear plan. He said with a smile, "Draft a proclamation and spread the word. Announce to all Northern Mount Yue factions that Du Dou acted on a secret decree from Mount Wu and allowed Dili Youjie into the pass to raise an army at Chan Pass."

Dili Youjie broke into a cold sweat upon hearing this. He had once again been thrust into the heart of the storm. But after glancing at Li Wushao and Kongheng beside him, he quickly calmed down. Meanwhile, Chen Yang stepped forward slightly, and Li Zhouwei said with a chuckle, ". Dili Youjie is already one of our own and Northern Mount Yue will eventually find out about this. I must have a title, or else It’s still rather inconvenient."

Dili Youjie didn’t understand Li Zhouwei’s mind as deeply as Chen Yang did, but he had his own ways of flattering him.. He quickly bowed deeply and said respectfully, "Great King, your brilliance shines like the sun. In the barbarian tongue, it is called Grand Concord of Radiance. I wish to honor you with this title!"

Seeing Li Zhouwei nod in approval, Chen Yang quickly added, "Then let’s proceed with the arrangements. Mobilize the troops! Before the Northern Court can react... we will march north swiftly!"

Li Zhouwei left the details to Chen Yang and idly gazed toward the sky. He wasn’t sure where Li Xijun and the others were hiding, but he muttered to himself, "Let’s see how the ruler of the Northern Mount Yue reacts... It would be best if this draw Mount Wu’s attention."




# Chapter 680: Entering The North

Northern Mount Yue.

The sky was shrouded in mist, but Li Xijun stood bathed in a snowy glow with his eyes shimmered with white light and a sword at his waist. He looked down to see the Dili family's troops enter the city below. A cloud of snow emerged beneath Li Xijun’s feet as he activated Snow On Pine, carrying him in an ethereal drift.

"Minghuang is intelligent. He has already taken on a Mount Yue title. Let’s test the ruler of Northern Mount Yue first."

Of course Li Xijun had made similar arrangements, but he chose to test the boy first. Now that he saw that everything had been properly arranged, he nodded and felt much more at ease.

Li Ximing watched in a trance. He had a mix of envy and satisfaction in his expression, his gaze lost in thought. He took out a jade bottle from his robe and said, "He has reached the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. If he takes this pill, he’ll reach the sixth... I also have Bright Spirit Powder for him. If he takes it with the pill, the Qi Cultivation Realm will be within his reach."

Li Xijun nodded, placing the items in his robe. As he looked up, he saw two forces leaving the city under the cover of night. "I’ve heard that the ruler of Northern Mount Yue is no mediocre leader. He’ll serve as Minghuang’s whetstone."

Li Ximing nodded, then suddenly asked, "Xijun, have you studied the Radiant Essence Scripture carefully?"

Li Xijun shook his head and replied, "I do not cultivate this Dao. I've only skimmed it for reference. Why do you ask?"

Li Ximing fell silent, gathering his words before speaking softly, "I have studied the nine secret techniques for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. They are all extremely difficult. Mastering three grants a fifteen percent success rate. Mastering all nine still offers less than a fifty percent chance, and that’s without factoring in one's personal conditions."

The Li Family naturally lacked an optimal environment for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Li Xijun did some calculations in his head and murmured, "If one truly masters all nine secret techniques, then the chances of success would be quite high."

"It’s nowhere near that simple!" Li Ximing smiled wryly as he replied. "Each secret technique is extremely difficult. You’ll need decades to master even one!"

"It’s that hard?" replied Li Xijun. But then, his expression changed as though he understood something.

He thought to himself, No wonder Ning Wan and the others have been stuck in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm for so long... She may not even have all nine techniques to practice!

Li Ximing paused before saying, "However, the scripture also records several spirit items that can aid in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm... Such as the Radiant Celestial Stone, Qilin Crow Spirit Husk, and White Blood Sap."

Li Ximing listed several spirit items, each a rare and precious treasure. He then continued saying, "All of the spirit items are at the Purple Mansion Realm..."

Li Xijun nodded slightly and replied, "Give me a list of the items. I’ll have Xizhi investigate and make inquiries in various places. Finding a lead would be ideal."

————

Meanwhile, in Chan Pass.

"Two passes and six towns." Li Zhouwei took out a map and examined it carefully. A vast plain dotted with numerous strongholds and a major town lay behind Chan Pass. Further beyond the plain was Moonlight Valley, another crucial pass which guarded the remaining five towns and the royal court.

In the past, their ancestor, Li Xiangping, had been able to move freely in this region. However, that was primarily because of two factors. First, he had a small and inconspicuous force. Secondly, a great drought had struck at the time and the lands of Mount Yue had just been ravaged by Jianixi. The region had been in complete ruin.

Now, with thousands of troops under Li Zhouwei’s command and with control over Chan Pass, where Xiangping had once been cornered in the north, their fate was bound to be different.

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment and thought to himself, Better to press the attack in one swift strike.

Li Zhouwei descended from the pass and swiftly mounted his horse. He ordered the Mount Yue general, Du Dou, to gather the troops and slaves. Standing atop the platform, he held his halberd up as his armor gleamed with a cold light.

Some of the soldiers of the Mount Yue forces wore armor, while the slaves were mostly bare-chested. It was evident that Du Dou had at least somewhat trained them, preventing complete disorder; however, they were still far from disciplined.

The warriors of Mount Yue looked around in confusion, as if it made no difference to them who their commander was. Only the eyes of a few revealed greed as they stared at the weapons piled atop the platform.

Li Zhouwei’s gaze swept across the filthy and wretched faces of the Mount Yue soldiers. A strange red glow began to emanate from his halberd, as if it could captivate souls. The Mount Yue warriors instinctively raised their heads toward him.

Those stationed to guard the pass were not of noble birth; in fact, most were slaves. They lifted their heads weakly, watching batches of provisions being brought onto the platform as they whispered among themselves.

"Gentlemen." Li Zhouwei’s voice echoed within the pass. It was deep and low as it hung in the air. It carried an almost bewitching quality. "I am the Grand Concord of Radiance, commanded by the Mandate of Heaven to conquer the Northern Court. It is my intention to first slaughter the esteemed families and distribute the farmland in towns taken by our forces. When we conquer the Northern Court, all slaves shall be freed from their servitude."

"Distribute farmland?"

"Freedom from slavery? Does this general truly mean it...?"

Li Zhouwei paused, then repeated himself. His voice became more ethereal and carried a mesmerizing force. The doubt and suspicion in the Mount Yue warriors’ eyes gradually faded away and was replaced by a surging, fervent greed.
𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

A touch of red began to glimmer deep in their eyes. They exchanged glances and stepped forward one by one to pick up the weapons before them. They were as fervent as a pack of starving wolves.

Chen Yang stood to the side and stared blankly. The voice had sunk into his brain without resistance. Even as a cultivator at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, he felt a momentary surge of excitement.

However, Chen Yang had a resolute mind. He quickly regained his senses and looked up at Li Zhouwei’s glowing, ghostly eyes before hastily lowering his head.

His heart quivered as he thought, So this is what Jianixi was like back then!

Dili Youjie stepped forward to report; he had already organized the troops and assigned personnel. Li Zhouwei’s spirit horse moved swiftly, leading the orderly tide of soldiers as they surged toward the towns hidden in the night.

The large town only had few guards to begin with. Before they could even react, several arrows shot through the air, felling them instantly. A few shamans swiftly scaled the walls and the gates swung open with a thunderous crash.

Li Zhouwei rode into the town atop his horse, the golden glow in his eyes flickering faintly. He could feel the soldiers following him in a trance-like state, as if a deep-seated instinct was gradually awakening within them.

He quickly reined in his horse and looked toward the stone tower at the village entrance. His silent yet frenzied troops poured into the town like waves splitting against rocks. They swept through the settlement in eerie silence.

A cacophony of voices rose around Li Zhouwei as he stared at the stone tower, a strange thought suddenly surfacing in his mind, I should be seated in a temple, presiding over an ancestral shrine...

He stood still as whispers spread like a Buddhist chant among the Mount Yue warriors. They all murmured. "In conquered towns, slaughter the esteemed families first, then distribute the farmland. When the Northern Court is conquered, all slaves shall be freed."

The Mount Yue warriors repeated the chant under their breath as they ran through the town. Small fires ignited across the settlements as they fought in the darkness. The cries of battle grew louder and louder, until they merged into a singular voice. "Grand Concord of Radiance!"

The chant made the Mount Yue warriors flush with battle fervor. Behind Li Zhouwei, Kongheng clutched a string of plain wooden prayer beads. He twisted them so tightly that they creaked. He was unable to conceal the shock on his face as he murmured, "A name destined for victory... Grand Concord of Radiance..."

A wisp of gray smoke gathered beside Kongheng, and the haunting voice of Li Wushao rang out. "Master Monk... what are you thinking?"

Kongheng merely shook his head with a bitter smile and replied, "Wushao, you are overly cautious..."

As the two Foundation Establishment cultivators conversed in hushed tones, Li Zhouwei spurred his horse forward and swiftly passed through the crowd. After securing control of the town, he rode toward the surrounding villages, bolstering his forces by another two or three hundred men. They marched quickly, leaving only a trail of blood behind them.

Li Zhouwei sent Chen Yang and Dili Youjie to lead separate units to conscript more troops while he galloped forward without hesitation. He no longer lingered in these villages and swiftly advanced toward the next pass.

But before Li Zhouwei arrived, a gust of gray wind swept past and deposited two jade bottles in his hands. One was green and the other white, but both bottles were exquisitely crafted.

Li Zhouwei inspected the contents using his divine sense before swiftly stowing them away. The valley before him was narrow, with troops stationed on both mountains. The pass was wedged between two gorges and appeared somewhat dilapidated.

His troops were lined up neatly as they paused for a brief moment at the valley’s entrance. Li Zhouwei looked to the side and addressed a Mount Yue soldier beside him, "Is this Moonlight Valley?"

The soldier nodded, bowed, and respectfully replied, "My lord, this place once belonged to the Moonlight Family, named after the rumored priest Yue Zhu[1]. During the great drought, the priest was slaughtered by the Easterners, yet it remains known as Moonlight Valley."

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly, thinking to himself, So, it was here, slaughtered by my ancestor.

Raising his halberd, he gazed at the narrow valley ahead and murmured, "Take this pass, then I’ll find an opportunity to break through."

1. Yue Zhu (月珠) means Moon Pearl in Chinese ☜

Northern Mount Yue Royal Court.

Flames flickered quietly in stone basins within the palace. A thin man with unkempt hair sat on the throne of Northern Mount Yue, gently tracing the inscriptions on a stone tablet in his hands.

The King of Northern Mount Yue, Xian Du, did not appear particularly imposing. His name was also a common one among the people of Mount Yue. Yet, if he had maintained his grip on the throne amidst a sea of esteemed families, his methods were undoubtedly extraordinary. Yet, he merely sat in silence and examined the stone tablet in his hands.

The tablet depicted a grand and turbulent scene. It showed a figure adorned in feathers and beast bones standing upon a sacrificial altar. Above the altar, storm clouds churned and a demon loomed in the sky.

Beside him, a high priest clad in beast bones and feathers knelt on the ground. Xian Du stared blankly at the image for a long time before asking, "Still no word from Mount Wu?"

"My king, we have tried eight times, but there has been no response. There is no sign of communication whatsoever." The high priest shook his head silently. He showed little fear. If anything, there was actually a trace of relief as he replied, "My king, perhaps this is for the best... Once the children pass the shaman transition, they will no longer need to ascend the mountain. Year after year, has a single one who went up the mountain ever returned? They have likely all been taken by the masters."

"Now that Mount Wu is silent, perhaps Master Jiao Zhongzi and Master Mu Moli have gone to the Eastern Sea. Does this not make things easier for us?"

Xian Du’s gaunt face was filled with unease. He shook his head heavily and gently placed the stone tablet down. He said quietly, "You fail to see the real threat. If Master Jiao Zhongzi has encountered trouble, then the dog of Eastern Mount Yue’s Li Family, Li Jiman, is watching us closely. The Great Jueting is but a hundred and sixty kilometers from Chan Pass. Two passes and six cities are nothing before a Foundation Establishment cultivator. They can be erased with a flick of a finger."

The high priest nodded submissively, though he thought to himself, If Mount Wu has truly fallen... how many of us could possibly escape? It would be better to surrender to Li Jiman, at least we’d have a chance to survive...

Xian Du was still deep in thought when a Mount Yue warrior rushed into the hall, shouting, "My king! There’s trouble at Chan Pass!"

Jiao Zhongzi really has run into trouble!

Xian Du sprang from his seat as if he had been struck by lightning, gritting his teeth as he asked, "Is it Li Jiman himself? Or a force from the Li Family?"

The warrior hesitated for a moment before replying, "My king! The Li Family has stationed troops at Great Jueting. The surrounding tribes, finding no way to survive, then deceived their way into Chan Pass... The garrison commander, Du Dou, was captured and defected to their side. Now, their forces are advancing northward and have breached the pass!"

"So it’s a rebellion!" Xian Du let out a small breath of relief as he asked, "Which tribe is leading this? Who is their chief? How many troops and cultivators do they have?!"

The Mount Yue warrior bowed and reported, "The rebel king calls himself the Grand Concord of Radiance... Perhaps he belongs to the Grand Concord Tribe, but we do not know their exact numbers. Rumor has it that the Dili Tribe outside the pass is secretly supporting them."

"Grand Concord Tribe? Never heard of it! What nonsense is this?" said Xian Du.

As the ruler of Northern Mount Yue, Xian Du knew every major tribe in the region. He knew their strength, their numbers, and their lineage. He even remembered the names of many of the mid-sized and minor tribes. However, there was no record of a Grand Concord Tribe at all in his memories.

Xian Du immediately furrowed his brows. He wasn’t concerned about a force of a few thousand men. But it would be another matter entirely if the Dili Tribe, which was likely under the control of the Li Family, had received Li Jiman’s silent approval.

That wretch is scheming against me day after day! thought Xian Du.

Neither Xian Du nor Li Jiman were mere figureheads. Northern Mount Yue and Eastern Mount Yue had long been wrestling for power in the shadows. But as vassals, neither dared to openly start a war without explicit orders.

A significant weight had vanished from his heart once Xian Du realized that this was merely a rebellion. At the very least, it meant that nothing had gone wrong with Mount Wu. Otherwise, the invading force would have been the Li Family itself.

Reassured, he simply said, "What’s there to panic about? At most, he has three or four thousand troops and a handful of shamans. What threat could they pose?"

But the Mount Yue warrior before him was drenched in sweat and his voice dropped to a hushed whisper. "The so-called Grand Concord of Radiance claims to have Mount Wu’s command... He is spreading rumors that Your Majesty has lost contact with Mount Wu... Please, my king... please..."

A frisson of alarm ran through Xian Du. It was true that Mount Wu had not sent anyone down in a long time. When he saw the warrior’s hesitant demeanor, he immediately grasped the implication but chose to remain silent.

Mount Wu has been silent for too long... The esteemed families of the realm are growing restless. They are using this as an excuse to probe Mount Wu’s status! thought Xian Du.

Xian Du quickly recognized this as a veiled message from the esteemed families, but he forced himself to remain calm and replied in a deep voice, "It is but a mere insignificant rebellion. Why should we disturb Mount Wu over this? Do you think you or I could bear the consequences if they take offense? I shall quell the uprising myself!"

"I have misspoken, my king!" The Mount Yue warrior, cowed by Xian Du’s reprimand, broke out in a fresh sweat as he repeatedly kowtowed. He then responded, "It’s just that... it is said that this man resembles Jianixi. My king, you must be cautious!"

"I am well aware!" Xian Du already knew his enemy was no ordinary opponent once h heard that they had easily deceived their way into Chan Pass,. Turning to his map, he decided to abandon the towns beyond the pass. His gaze was fixed on Moonlight Valley as he murmured, "Mobilize the troops immediately. I shall personally lead the campaign. March to Moonlight Valley and trap him outside our heartland."

He kicked the warrior aside as he strode forward. The Mount Yue warrior scrambled back to his feet in terror. Xian Du was at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and had long suppressed his breakthrough. He was particularly formidable among those of a similar level. That single kick left the warrior winded and trembling.

Donning his armor and grasping his spear, Xian Du swiftly departed from the royal court. His mind raced as he issued his orders in a steady voice, "Order Xian Zhunfu to lead five thousand troops down the eastern path along the lake. Check if we can enter the valley from its side. I shall personally lead seven thousand of my elite forces to Moonlight Valley. If we hold the pass, this threat will be of no consequence!"




# Chapter 682: Lured In

Xian Du's military banner left the Northern Court and headed south. The gaunt man sat silently in the carriage, his expression grim.

Mount Yue's power had always been fragmented. It was only during the reign of Jianixi that the land had united under one rule, with families of Mount Yue from the western foothills of Mount Dali crossing over to pledge allegiance. The rest of Mount Yue’s small or big kings ruled alongside esteemed families, dividing power further with the priesthood.

Xian Du had kept priests firmly in check during his rule. Now that he sought to mobilize troops, only a handful out of th e thousands of villages scattered across a thousand kilometers responded.

They’re all testing me... waiting for Mount Wu’s reaction.

Aside from his own five thousand elite soldiers, Xian Du had only managed to gather three thousand irregular troops. Even with careful planning, they might not reach Moonlight Valley within a week. This was making him increasingly anxious.

I must not underestimate the Grand Concord of Radiance! The esteemed families will shift with the breeze and will likely tolerate him. Though there are five thousand troops in the valley, I must remain vigilant.

Xian Du had seized the throne through his own cunning, so he was no fool. He silently jumped down from the carriage, called over a burly soldier and said in a deep voice, "Lead the troops forward. Do not delay!"

He then mounted a striped tiger-like beast and shot south like an arrow. He only took a group of elite guards along with him. The Mount Yue elite guards were all cultivators, so they made remarkable time. It only took them half a day to reach a major town close to Moonlight Valley.

Xian Du had the local family leader brought before him and said coldly, "Have the forces of the six towns mobilized to reinforce Moonlight Valley?"

As expected, the Mount Yue leader hesitated as he sweated profusely. He had never imagined that the royal court’s Xian Du would arrive at the valley’s gates overnight. Stammering, he said, "We have not... received the king’s decree... so we dare not act."

Xian Du's face darkened, then paled. He almost laughed out loud before drawing the blade at his waist with a sharp clang. He shouted, "To hell with your cowardice!"

His gaunt face flushed red as he raised the long blade high. Before the man could react, his head flew into the air, sending blood splattering everywhere.

Xian Du kicked the corpse aside, lifted the severed head and said coldly, "Send his head to the six towns. Order all forces to mobilize immediately!"

When he issued orders, he was forced to repeat them multiple times, yet they would still drag their feet and refuse to move. Even now, when the enemy was attacking the pass, they still wanted to play games with him. Xian Du was still furious, his gaze like a blade as it swept across the Mount Yue warriors before him.

He cursed, "You bastards are refusing to deploy troops? Are you just waiting for my blade?!"

His subordinates did not even dare to wipe the blood off their faces as they followed Xian Du out. After another half hour, they managed to gather a mere two thousand soldiers. Xian Du’s face was dark as he drove the troops forward. He sent men ahead to investigate the valley’s situation and rode swiftly out of the camp.

After riding for a kilometer, he saw that the road ahead was eerily empty. The scouts had not returned and the forces of the six towns behind him remained motionless.

Dissatisfied, he called his men forward and said in a low voice, "The six towns are too slow to act. If I leave, they’ll delay again. Chong Dui! Take the troops to reinforce the valley and I’ll gather more soldiers."

Chong Dui nodded in reply. Xian Du further instructed, "We don’t know the situation in Moonlight Valley. Be cautious on the road."

He was reassured when he saw his men nod repeatedly. He knew Chong Dui had always been reliable. He returned to the town with his trusted aides, and charged into another settlement. As expected, he found the family chief and various leaders sitting together, whispering and stalling. His rage flared instantly.

"You worthless scum!" Xian Du had, of course, planted his own men within the six towns. However, these towns were once great family fortresses. They governed entire settlements, so it was hardly easy to subdue them.

His fury mounting, he drew his blade and said coldly, "Cowards that are waiting to die!"

These men were pitifully unlucky. They had just found the severed head of one of their own when Xian Du burst into their quarters. As the King of Northern Mount Yue, he had no patience for excuses. It took only moments for the floor to be soaked in blood and for heads to roll.

Once Xian Du calmed down, he sheathed his blade and stepped out of the tent, only to see a bloodied rider speeding toward him. His heart tightened as the man tumbled from his horse, cupped his fists and cried out miserably, "My King! Moonlight Valley has already fallen without a sound! The Grand Concord of Radiance... ambushed us on the narrow path beyond the gorge! Thousands of our troops were wiped out... and only a few hundred managed to escape..."

Xian Du stood frozen for two breaths, his heart pounding in terror. He could only ask, "Where is Chong Dui?!"

The Mount Yue soldier wept as he replied, "I fear he is already..."

Xian Du’s legs nearly gave out beneath him. There was no time for grief, or to ponder how such a critical stronghold had fallen in mere days. The next question had already surfaced.

The Grand Concord of Radiance will surely advance... Do we fight or flee?

While Xian Du was overwhelmed, Chong Dui remained loyal as he rode swiftly toward Moonlight Valley. His troops were disorderly and uncoordinated rabble from various families. He could only force them forward, thinking to himself, I’ll sort them out once we reach the pass...

After marching just over five kilometers, he led his troops into the forest. He was only halfway through when a deafening explosion rang out as he was ambushed from both sides. Never had Chong Dui imagined he would be attacked while marching on his own territory.

Shocked, he shouted, "Form up! Retreat slowly!"

His words had barely left his mouth when he saw a flash of cold steel. A dark figure stormed through his lines like a violent gust of wind. The figure’s armor glinted with a frigid sheen under the night sky. A halberd appeared in the air for a moment, but it was already upon him before he had time to react.

Chong Dui was so terrified he could not even speak. He only had a cultivation at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm; how could he withstand such an assault? He barely raised his weapon before he was thrown into the air like a leaf in a storm. He felt a crushing pain in his chest as stars whirled around him. He barely made out the halberd tearing his warhorse to pieces.

Five hundred elite warriors tore into his disorganized troops like tigers among a flock of sheep, unleashing a tide of bloodshed. Though Chong Dui was still dizzy from the fall, he heard a metallic clang as a white iron halberd stabbed into the ground beside his neck. It sent chills down his spine.

The glint of steel was so blinding he could hardly keep his eyes open. Covered in blood, Chong Dui dared not move, his skin prickling from the icy aura of the halberd. Then, a deep voice rang out, "I thought it was Xian Du himself, so I came to welcome him in person. Turns out, it’s just a minor general."

Li Zhouwei examined Chong Dui quietly. Around them, the battlefield was filled with wails of agony. Blood stained the forest floor. Yet, the young warrior seemed utterly unbothered. He smiled slightly as he pulled his halberd from the ground and flipped it in his grip.

The halberd’s tip hovered just above the ground. Crimson blood dripped from it, forming a dark red trail across the dirt. Riding forward, Li Zhouwei thought to himself, He might be useful after all. Pretending to be reinforcements to lure Moonlight Valley’s forces away won’t be an issue.

Chong Dui struggled to rise as he glanced around. Apart from the silent soldiers of the Grand Concord of Radiance, only scattered corpses remained in the forest. He knelt and said, "I am willing to serve Your Majesty."

The Grand Concord of Radiance seemed even more amused, his voice bright as he said, "Look at me."

Chong Dui had no choice but to lift his gaze. A pair of dark brown pupils shrank slightly beneath the long brows as they flickered with traces of golden light. The sight of this eerie young man made Chong Dui shiver.

The youth lifted his chin and uttered words that sent a chill down Chong Dui’s spine, making cold sweat break out all over his body. "You are loyal; no wonder Xian Du sent you. But your cultivation is too weak, you cannot deceive me."

Chong Dui’s expression turned fierce in an instant but he was nowhere near as fast as the halberd. Cold steel flashed, and a head soared high into the air. His body thudded to the ground, sending gouts of crimson blood gushing out, staining the last clean patch of ground bright red.

Li Zhouwei merely cantered forward on his horse. It was only after he was several steps away did the severed head finally land on the forest floor.

They had already advanced deep into Northern Mount Yue territory. Moonlight Valley had many cultivators and soldiers. In the mountains, cultivators at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm had awakened their spiritual sense. This allowed them to detect cultivation realms. Thus, Li Zhouwei did not let Li Wushao take action immediately. Instead, he opted to first probe the enemy with two assaults.

The enemy had sent out two detachments of troops, both of which had been completely annihilated. However, they then refused to engage further, turning the battle into a slow war of attrition. When he saw the prolonged standoff in the valley, Li Zhouwei had no desire to waste time there. Instead, he led a group of cultivators and quietly circled around the battlefield through the mountains to arrive behind the pass.

This maneuver was only possible with the guidance of the Dili Family. Li Zhouwei ordered Chen Yang and Dili Youjie to hold Moonlight Valley while he laid an ambush along the road with his forces for two days. Timing everything precisely, he consumed a Talisman pill and successfully advanced to the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

"The Mount Yue reinforcements are truly pathetic," said Li Zhouwei.
𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

The mountain paths were treacherous, so he had only brought five hundred elite troops and waited a few days to stabilize his cultivation. Yet, it had taken a full five days for the so-called reinforcements to finally appear. They also looked like a chaotic, disorderly rabble.

Only that minor general seemed somewhat competent. Li Zhouwei indeed lacked a capable Mount Yue warrior from the royal court under his command. Unfortunately, this one could not be taken in.

As Li Zhouwei fell into thought for a few moments, his men had already extracted the necessary information from the survivors. Dili Youjie knelt and reported, "My King, Xian Du is in Chongwu Town."

Li Zhouwei urged his horse forward as he gradually increased his speed. Dili Youjie rejoiced and said excitedly, "My King! Why not advance immediately and capture the ruler of Northern Mount Yue?"

As his five hundred elite troops gathered around him, Li Zhouwei did not head straight for Chongwu Town. Instead, he spread out his map and murmured, "Xian Du must think that I’ve broken through the pass and am marching north with my army. If he flees in haste, he will either go east or west..."

He calculated Xian Du’s forces to be around five thousand strong across the six towns, while his own main army had yet to arrive. Holding the six towns was feasible. He chuckled and asked Dili Youjie beside him, "Will he defend or flee?"

Dili Youjie hesitated; he was unsure how to respond. Li Zhouwei sheathed his halberd, turned his horse around, and spoke, "If he abandons the six towns, Northern Mount Yue will be gutted from within. Since there’s been no word from Mount Wu, it would be suicide! Xian Du is no fool; he will defend! After all, we don’t really have five thousand troops storming through the pass. If he retreats, he might attempt to strike back. But if he holds, he cannot take the six towns. First, we seize Moonlight Valley, then we plan our next move. Take Chong Dui’s banner, cleanse it with the Purifying Spell and move south."

Li Zhouwei set a rapid pace until Moonlight Valley came into view. Stowing his halberd in his storage pouch, he paused beneath the pass. His five hundred troops took a brief rest before silently slipping back up the mountain.

The battle at the pass raged fiercely, yet the defending general remained vigilant. The rear was also well-guarded. The moment the troops moved toward them, a guard hailed them, "Are you reinforcements? Which unit?"

Dili Youjie quickly stepped forward, speaking in a Mount Yue accent, "Chong Dui, sent by the king to reinforce!"

The guard replied, "I do not recognize you, sir. General Sidu has set strict rules, he must verify you guys in person. Please wait."

Dili Youjie glanced at Li Zhouwei, who nodded. Without hesitation, Dili Youjie drew his blade and cleaved the man down in one strike. He raised the Grand Concord of Radiance’s banner, and sent the troops roaring forward to storm the archer platforms.

Li Zhouwei drew his halberd, a crimson glow spreading across its surface. He shattered the stronghold gate with a single strike. Mount Yue soldiers fell like cut wheat before his charge. His troops tore through them like tigers among a flock of sheep as he continued pressing the assault.

Moonlight Valley’s forces had been handling the southern assault with ease, but after days of being besieged, their troops were exhausted and their mounts weary. Now, instead of reinforcements, an enemy force had struck from the rear. They were thrown into disarray by the sudden assault.

Chen Yang seized the moment and launched a fierce offensive, triggering a chain reaction. Though the defending general was highly capable, his exhausted troops could no longer hold the defensive line, which collapsed.

————

Xian Du hurriedly gathered his troops, reorganizing the six towns and setting everything in place. Now that he had erected several layers of fortifications, he finally felt a moment of relief. He inquired repeatedly, but there was still no news from the south.

None of the scouts he had sent out returned, leaving him as blind as a man groping in the dark. Xian Du had no choice but to wait. It was only when his elite troops arrived that he finally realized, I’ve fallen for the Grand Concord of Radiance’s trick! He must have snuck through the mountain paths!

Xian Du was filled with regret. It wasn’t that he was foolish. The mountain roads were difficult to traverse; only one or two hundred troops could have passed through in just a single day. How many cultivators could a small family possibly have? Yet, they had managed to completely defeat Chong Dui!

His thoughts whirled and suddenly, a spark of joy flickered in his heart. The real problem is the lack of news! The Grand Concord of Radiance went to great lengths to eliminate my scouts, which means something must be happening in Moonlight Valley. It hasn’t fallen yet!

Gritting his teeth, Xian Du immediately ordered, "Mobilize the entire army! We must strike Moonlight Valley while their troops are still exhausted and can’t secure their position!"

He grabbed his spear, mounted his tiger-like beast and charged forward like the wind. His army marched steadily out of the town. Xian Du’s heart was filled with urgency, as he pushed his troops to their limits.

Along the way, they intercepted a few detachments from the Grand Concord Family, which had no doubt been the ones to kill his scouts. Their leader was highly skilled, which explained why none of his scouts had escaped. But when the detachments saw the approaching army, they fled at once.

Xian Du’s doubts were partially alleviated when he spotted Moonlight Valley. He could see flames raging in the valley, with about two hundred warriors battling fiercely beneath the stronghold. They were undoubtedly elite soldiers, but their movements had grown sluggish. They were clearly exhausted from prolonged combat.

"Hahaha! Just as I thought! No wonder they went to such lengths to eliminate my scouts!" said Xian Du.

The defenses were teetering on the edge of collapse, but Xian Du had arrived at the perfect moment. His heart swelled with joy.

"Good! I knew it! This is the strongest pass in the nation, guarded by General Sidu, who’s at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. How could it fall so easily?" exclaimed Xian Du.

Overjoyed, Xian Du urgently led his forces forward, his army surging ahead as he roared, "Reinforcements have arrived! Reinforcements have arrived!"

His troops echoed his cry in exhilaration, their voices shaking the heavens. Xian Du charged into the battlefield and pincering the enemy soldiers between his forces and the defensive line. The hundred or so enemy soldiers were forced to turn around and defend, while cheers erupted from the defenders atop the stronghold.

But just as Xian Du was cutting down foes, a deafening battle cry erupted behind him. Thousands of enemy soldiers scythed through his flanks, splitting his army in two. Shadows filled the stronghold above, as arrows rained down and banners with a glaring inscription unfurled. It was the Grand Concord of Radiance!

Xian Du felt as if he had fallen into an icy abyss in an instant. He yanked his reins as he turned to look back at the army charging out from the forest. On a hill opposite him, a young warrior was seated atop a black warhorse. His armor and halberd gleamed with a cold light as he gazed at Xian Du from afar. A faint, indistinct smile appeared on his face.

Xian Du felt as though he were being watched by a wolf or a tiger. His hair stood on end and cold sweat dripped down his back as he muttered, "Grand Concord of Radiance!"




# Chapter 684: Mu Moli

The grand formation on Mount Wu had originally been set up by Duanmu Kui, a formidable Purple Mansion Realm formation master. Unfortunately, Zhu Yue had welcomed Azure Pond after Duanmu Kui's death and this formation had long since been offered to the Azure Pond Sect.

Later, Jiao Zhongzi took control of Mount Wu and re-established the formation, sealing it tightly under a pitch-black light barrier.

A field of bones lay at the foot of the mountain. The grand priest shivered as he knelt before a boiling blood pool. A gray wind swooped down the mountain and coalesced into an elderly man in black robes. His deep, eerie eyes gazed coldly at the Mount Yue warrior before him.

The grand priest had finally received a response. His fear intertwined with joy as he cried out in terror, "My lord! Xian Du underestimated the enemy... The six towns were broken by the rebel army and all the generals were captured. Over five thousand have been killed or wounded. The rear army was also crushed, and are trampling over one another in panic. They were all driven into the six towns, which surrendered at the mere sight of the enemy. Their forces are now advancing upon the Northern Court..."

The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's expression darkened, and he muttered coldly, "Useless trash."

This was none other than Mu Moli. He adjusted his black robes and casually swept the sacrificial offerings into his pouch. He rode the gray wind into the sky, where he hovered for a moment. He placed a finger between his eyebrows and listened intently.

"Grand Concord of Radiance."

"Grand Concord of Radiance."

He was cautious enough to listen carefully. Yet, he noticed that the rebel army had stopped fifty kilometers outside the royal court. He cursed under his breath as suspicion rose in his heart. He thought, Could someone be trying to lure me out of the mountain? And at the perfect fifty kilometers range to target my Immortal Foundation...

Mu Moli felt unease stirring deep within him. In these times, Weihou advances from the north, the world is shrouded in turmoil, and the wolves and tigers lie in wait. My senior brother has not returned for many years. I must remain vigilant.

He prepared to ride the wind back up the mountain. But at that moment, he felt a blistering heat surge behind him. The clouds above him were torn apart as a brilliant golden light descended with a thunderous roar.

"I’ve been waiting for you!"

Mu Moli instantly broke out in a cold sweat. His figure blurred as black smoke surged from under his feet. Fear gripped his heart as he thought, Who is it?!

The golden light shone brilliantly as white stone bricks appeared and seamlessly joined together to form a towering fortress gate. The majestic gate stood tall, with two massive white pillars engraved with intricate patterns.

Radiant light shimmered inside the gate. It was hazy yet dazzling, as if it contained a blazing sun. The burst of brilliance completely dissipated the black smoke beneath his feet. Mu Moli was momentarily stunned before he swiftly flicked his sleeves and released two Tortoise Shields.

Only now did he clearly see the figure seated cross-legged atop the radiant gate. The young man wore a smile and his Daoist robe billowed in the wind. The brilliant light illuminated the town and rivers beneath them as he grinned, "I, Ximing, was ordered to guard this place. I have been waiting for quite some time!"

Li Ximing had obtained the Radiant Essence Scripture, and had spent a long time refining his mana. Though his Immortal Foundation Realm was not as perfect as the orthodox version of the Radiant Essence Scripture, it was nevertheless profound, resembling a great sun suspended in the sky.

"Li Ximing?" Mu Moli never expected to truly find someone from the Li Family. In that instant, disbelief struck him, and he regretted, I was too careless!

Mu Moli had not entirely dismissed the idea of the Li Family launching an attack, but he had assumed they would proceed methodically. He thought they would first crush the weaker Yu and Fei Families, who lacked even cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Then move on to the lone Huo Luo'e, before finally choosing to attack him.

He only wanted to hold Mount Wu for Jiao Zhongzi, and believed that the Li Family would not arrive so soon. However, because of this misjudgment, he had lingered too long and now found himself trapped.

"Damn it!" He silently formed a hand seal, causing the two Tortoise Shields to emit thick black mist that tried to mar the gate’s pillars. However, a searing brilliance scorched his face until his skin sizzled. Gritting his teeth, he shouted, "The Li Family is truly cunning and cautious! Though you have so many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, you still resort to such tricks to lure me out of the mountain!"

Li Ximing simply continued to channel his Immortal Foundation’s energy, pressing it down upon Radiant Origin Pass, and spoke softly, "Mount Wu was once the residence of Duanmu Kui. Even remnants of his techniques could spell eternal doom for mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators like us. Senior, your sorcery is profound, do not underestimate yourself."

Mu Moli felt as though he were sinking into a quagmire. The hazy yet dazzling light from the gate had set his robes ablaze. He could only discern that Li Ximing’s Immortal Foundation was of the Bright Yang lineage, which was skilled in suppression. Since he didn’t know where Li Qinghong and the others were, he spoke softly, "You seek only the lands of Mount Yue, Ximing. Let me go... I will return to the mountain and clean everything up, never to return... Why resort to bloodshed?"

The suppressive force within Radiant Origin Pass grew stronger. Li Ximing was more than happy to stall for time. He simply asked, "Tell me, where is Jiao Zhongzi?"

Mu Moli remained silent. He realized that the Li Family would never let him go. His expression turned grim as he retrieved a wooden talisman from his sleeve and crushed it, speaking coldly, "You wouldn’t even dare to plot against the north if not for my senior brother’s absence!"

Mount Wu trembled violently as soon as the talisman shattered. A river of black clouds surged from its peak, accompanied by a deafening susurration. The dark mass ascended rapidly, hurtling straight toward the two of them.

Boom!

Radiant Origin Pass trembled slightly as the black cloud condensed into a long-tailed black-furred panther. It was unmistakably Jiao Zhongzi’s mount. Its emerald-green eyes gleamed and it spoke in a thunderous voice, "Mu Moli! What kind of trouble have you stirred up this time? Calling for me in such a hurry!"

Mu Moli cursed back, "You fool... The Li Family is after Mount Wu!"

The beast was immediately startled. It leaped upward like a rolling cloud and attempted to pull Mu Moli free from Radiant Origin Pass. But then, a gust of freezing snow swept in from the east. The fierce wind and snow blew it away from the clouds.

Dressed in pristine white, Li Xijun approached with a sword strapped to his back. His refined features carried an otherworldly charm. He had two fingers pressed together as he summoned a piercing cold wind.

The young man nodded slightly, a faint smile on his lips as he said, "Greetings, fellow cultivator."

The Li Family was renowned for their swordsmanship. Even though Li Xijun had yet to draw his sword, the beast was already wary. The two Li brothers stood in the sky and exuded the aura of a celestial family from a major sect.

Mu Moli had exchanged dozens of moves with Li Ximing, yet he remained trapped within the brilliant radiance. His face was covered in red welts and his lips were pale. Frustration seethed within him.

He could tell that Li Ximing lacked combat experience and did not know any particularly powerful spell arts. Yet, his Immortal Foundation Realm was overwhelmingly strong. No matter how many shamanic spells Mu Moli cast, the Radiant Origin Pass held him firmly in place.

Moreover, the gate seemed naturally suited for suppression and eradication, which made escape even harder. Though Li Ximing could not defeat him outright, Mu Moli’s mana and blood essence were steadily depleting. He was getting pulled deeper into the trap.

"Ju Wu, assist me at once!" shouted Mu Moli.

As a seasoned cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm, Mu Moli immediately recognized that Li Xijun had only recently broken through. His once-hopeless heart stirred with renewed vigor as he thought, It’s not Li Qinghong with her Profound Thunder Dao Foundation Realm! Just a newly ascended Foundation Establishment brat... My chance lies here!

Mu Moli’s spirits lifted at once. If he were facing Li Qinghong, who wielded thunder and lightning, he would truly be doomed. So he urgently called upon the beast, Ju Wu, for help.

The panther-like demonic beast glanced at the scene and spat out a gust of wind as it charged forward. But before it could reach Mu Moli, Li Xijun formed a hand seal and chanted an incantation. He kept his two fingers pressed together as dozens of white streams burst forth. Waves of cold light transformed into fine, pine-needle-like snowflakes. The waves were carried by the wind as it swept toward Ju Wu.

“Hah! You—” The demonic beast had barely spoken when the chilling yin qi pierced through its body. Snowflakes gently descended from the sky and Ju Wu’s movements stalled. Li Xijun calmly reached for his sharp sword and unsheathed it in one smooth motion.

Clang!

A dazzling white sword light flashed. The Foundation Establishment Realm sword, Han Lin, had been forged for over a decade. Now, it finally displayed its true brilliance. The slender blade danced and its fierce radiance gleamed like snow.

Celestial Moon Slash!

All the snowflakes in the surrounding space shifted an inch in unison. Ju Wu let out a sorrowful wail as two short, thick claws flew into the air. Li Xijun had wielded a sword since he was a child. He had practiced against the falling snow in the mountains. Forty years later, he felt an exhilarating satisfaction as his blade tasted blood.

Many in the Li Family had mastered Celestial Moon Slash in the past century. Li Xuanling had great talent in swordsmanship but had perished too soon. Li Yuanjiao treated the sword merely as a tool for killing and did not refine his technique. Their Celestial Moon Slash was always the same pale-blue glow that merely imitated the sword of Li Chejing.

Only Li Tongya’s Celestial Moon Slash had ever been as grand as a ship’s sail. His slash carried a deep and vast sword force. He had truly made it his own sword. Now, as Li Xijun unleashed a fierce and drifting snow-white light, he finally stepped beyond mere imitation.

Threefold Moonlight!

His sword flicked back, releasing three agile streaks of white light. As he wielded his blade, admiration flashed across Li Xijun’s mind, The sword canon is profound. One could spend a lifetime and never exhaust its mysteries. My ancestor only wielded the blade for fifteen years before composing this text. Such a talent, truly peerless.

But his sword did not slow even as he reflected. Slaughter Jun Kui Light was a perfect complement for his swordsmanship. Ju Wu struggled to cast any magic, let alone defend against the sword as he was already bound by the spell. It was struck again and again until it vomited black blood.

Ju Wu was utterly terrified. It had been reduced to nothing more than a mount though it was a demonic beast. It was already weaker than most rogue cultivators. How could it endure such swordplay? In despair, it cried, “To hell with aiding you, Mu Moli... I’m about to be slain!”

Mu Moli, still locked in a stalemate with Li Ximing, felt a chill in his heart. He spoke coldly, “Leave at once! Find our senior brother!”

Mu Moli swallowed several pills, forcing his Immortal Foundation into full operation. His eyes gleamed with a faint red light as he retrieved a bronze tablet. He grasped his own shoulder and with a sickening crunch, tore off his own arm.

Before the blood could even flow, he hurled the severed arm high into the air. A flash of red light erupted as it transformed into a massive green-faced, fanged demon that charged fiercely at Li Xijun.

“Finally, a proper shamanic spell,” muttered Li Xijun. Li Xijun let the demon rush forward, knowing that Kongheng would handle it. Examining the creature with interest, he stepped forward, drawing his sword.

Although Mount Wu carried a lineage of shamanic cultivation, Duanmu Kui himself, along with his disciples, had followed the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Dao. Though Duanmu Kui likely possessed knowledge of shamanic spells, he rarely taught them. He only left a few techniques for his disciples to study on their own.

As a result, the shamanic spells used by the Mount Yue cultivators were a mix of Daoist and shamanic arts. It was often awkward and incomplete. Now that he was bearing witness to a fully realized shamanic spell for the first time, Li Xijun observed it carefully.

The green-faced demon stood over twenty feet tall, with a grotesque visage and a mouthful of fangs. Its body was covered in intricate runes, but instead of emitting mana, it radiated a faint green aura.

After a few sword strikes, Li Xijun noticed that the demon’s body was soft, almost like clay. It regenerated quickly but seemed particularly vulnerable to spell arts.

Forming a spell seal, he channeled Slaughter Jun Kui Light, and sure enough, the demon’s green aura rapidly diminished. He took out various talismans and started testing them one by one, silently memorizing their effects.

While Li Xijun conducted his experiments, Mu Moli was still struggling against Li Ximing after over a hundred exchanges. Forming a quick seal, he slapped his storage pouch and flung several skulls into the air.

The black smoke around him surged into the skulls, transforming into five or six shadowy mountain ghosts that shrieked as they charged toward Li Ximing. The ghosts were attempting to bypass Radiant Origin Pass and strike directly at his body.

Yet, the moment the ghosts rose, four ancient sigils on the left pillar of Radiant Origin Pass flared to life and immediately repelled the ghosts.

Li Ximing laughed. "My Bright Yang may not compare to Profound Thunder against such filth, but it ranks among the best. Senior, don’t bother with these petty tricks!"

But just as Li Ximing unleashed Radiant Origin Pass, Mu Moli transformed into a streak of crimson light and fled. Taking no chances, Li Xijun immediately gave chase. But, a figure emerged in the distant mist. The silhouette swept his sleeve and captured Mu Moli with ease.

Li Ximing stopped, brows furrowed. He was momentarily stunned as he watched the figure glide effortlessly through the air on a white, porcelain-like flying shuttle.

"This..."

The man bore the marks of age and wear, yet his expression was warm. His deep-set eyes and long face carried a serene demeanor. His white hair and beard had streaks of gray running through it as it framed his face. Dressed in a flowing white robe with cloud-patterned sleeves, he stood with his hands behind his back.

Several medicine pouches hung from his waist. In his hand, he held the transformed Mu Moli, effortlessly containing the crimson light’s movements no matter how it twisted and surged.

He met Li Ximing’s eyes and spoke in a gentle voice, "Ming'er."
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Li Ximing quickly kneeled in respect. His voice was choked with emotion as he reverently greeted, "Disciple Ximing greets Master!"

Li Xijun immediately understood and followed suit, bowing as he respectfully addressed, "Greetings, Senior Xiao!"




# Chapter 686: Bone Carving Skin Exchange

The person who arrived was Xiao Yuansi. His expression was gentle and his cultivation had already reached its peak. Merely standing there, he exuded a faint medicinal fragrance. The cloud patterns on his cuffs were a light golden hue and his demeanor was warm. He said, “No need to be so polite...”

Li Ximing had gone to the Xiao Family several times to seek him but each time he returned empty-handed. Later, the Xiao Family sealed the mountain which made it even harder to see Xiao Yuansi. Now, feeling sentimental, Li Ximing asked several questions in succession, “How is Master’s cultivation now? Are you preparing to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm?!”

“Still lacking a bit of refinement,” Xiao Yuansi responded warmly to each question.

During the short time Xiao Yuansi had been present, Li Xijun had already begun to speculate, thinking, It seems that Mu Moli and Ju Wu were lured out by the Man On Creek. The Xiao Family specifically made this trip, so they must have some intentions.

The Li Family’s trip was only to Mount Wu, what else was there that could be worth Xiao Chuting sending people over? The white-clothed youth shook his sleeves and first expressed his gratitude, “Many thanks for your assistance, senior.”

Xiao Yuansi waved his hand lightly. Whether they were thanking him for effortlessly capturing Mu Moli or for luring both man and beast out of the mountain, both parties understood in their hearts. Then, Li Xijun smiled and said, “I was troubled, unsure of the taboos and depths of Mount Wu. Since you are passing through, senior, I hope you can offer some guidance.”

“Alright, then let’s go take a look together.” Xiao Yuansi glanced at him in surprise, chuckled softly, and agreed, saying, “Speaking with Xijun is truly like a refreshing spring breeze.”

Xiao Yuansi paused for a moment. He could no longer hold the crimson light, which Mu Moli transformed into, in his hand. The crimson light then transformed into a bare head attached to a short segment of spine. Mu Moli opened his mouth and was going to beg for mercy.

Xiao Yuansi placed a finger on the center of his eyebrows. In an instant, Mu Moli lost his consciousness and drifted into a hazy dreamlike state. With a flick of his sleeve, Mu Moli melted into it like snow under sunlight.

After casting a spell to take him in, Xiao Yuansi finally spoke with slight apology, “Our Daoist Master has some matters to inquire about regarding Mount Yue.”

At this point, Li Ximing understood that Xiao Yuansi had come specifically for Mount Wu. He traveled with the wind and soon saw a narrow-eyed monk also flying over, golden light forming into a bundle of chains, tightly binding a panther-like demon.

Ju Wu had only managed to escape a few miles before Kongheng had already been waiting nearby. The demonic beast had suffered some minor injuries and had no chance of escaping from the Master Monk’s grasp. In just a moment, it was captured and brought back.

“The Master Monk has arrived,” said Li Ximing, stepping forward to greet him.

Xiao Yuansi glanced at Kongheng and said softly, “Take this demonic beast into the formation. It may be of use.”

Kongheng glanced at Li Xijun and gave a slight nod before silently landing beside the group and replied, “Kongheng greets the senior.”
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝘦𝓌𝑒𝑏𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝘭.𝒸𝘰𝑚

Xiao Yuansi nodded and looked at the pitch-black formation beneath his feet. Li Xijun brought Ju Wu forward and said in a deep voice, “Open the grand formation.”

Ju Wu stiffened his neck but couldn’t utter a word. His fierce expression masked his inner fear. Li Xijun glanced at him twice, then pointed to Xiao Yuansi and spoke softly, “This is Senior Xiao of the immortal family at the Purple Mansion Realm, a nephew of the Daoist Master. Even if Jiao Zhongzi returns for revenge, he will still fall into the hands of the Daoist Master, so there is no need to worry.”

Seeing the change in Ju Wu’s expression, he continued saying, “Or is Jiao Zhongzi currently in seclusion overseas, attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm? Do you think he can succeed?”

Ju Wu’s expression shifted several times. Jiao Zhongzi had been missing for years and Ju Wu truly had no idea where he was. Looking at the group’s demeanor, Mu Moli was likely dead. This demon had some relation with Mu Moli. With its friend slain, it sorrowfully shut its mouth and was unwilling to speak.

Li Xijun drew his sword and pressed it against Ju Wu’s neck with the icy blade biting into its skin. With that, Ju Wu immediately spoke, “To enter and exit this formation, a shamanic talisman is required. I have it on me. Loosen my bindings slightly and I will retrieve it for the Exalted Immortal.”

Among the cultivators present, any one of them could take his life. Li Xijun wasn’t worried about him playing tricks, so he signaled Kongheng to loosen the restriction. Ju Wu swept his gaze over the group and then looked at the Purple Mansion immortal descendant standing with his hands behind his back.

He opened his panther-like mouth, extended his blood-colored tongue and spat out a brown shamanic talisman. With a command toward the pitch-black formation, the mist dissipated instantly and revealed the great mountain hidden within.

Li Xijun nodded slightly. They could have forcefully broken through the formation but by taking this indirect approach, they preserved this rare shamanic array. This way, there would be no need to construct another grand formation to protect the mountain in the future.

As they drew closer to the mountain, the surrounding magical winds dissipated and made it feel as if they had sunk into quicksilver. With the grand formation now open, Ju Wu’s mentality shifted and he hastily explained, “Mount Wu once housed a supreme treasure. Over the years, mulberry trees have grown everywhere and the spiritual energy here has become heavy. When immortal arts are used here, the clarity of their essence is greatly diminished. The most affected is the art of wind-riding.”

“That must be Answers to a Beggar’s Questions Under the Mulberry Tree!” Xiao Yuansi frowned slightly. He possessed a flying shuttle which was a dharma artifact, meaning he wasn’t necessarily unable to fly here. However, considering the others, he spoke gently, “Let’s go up from the foot of the mountain and take a look.”

They descended toward the foot of the mountain and indeed saw the land covered in mulberry and pagoda trees, forming a dark landscape. White jade steps lined the mountain with spring water gushing forth, flowing in a stream of translucent green. The sound of rushing water echoed around them. The many jade stones bore the marks of time, their luster dimmed, revealing an ancient aura.

Li Ximing praised the sight. As the group ascended the steps, they reached a platform. Li Xijun, holding his sword, swept the area with his spiritual sense and saw below them a group of swine-like creatures sprawled haphazardly.

These creatures lay limp, their eyes were vacant and devoid of intelligence. Around their necks were jade collars engraved with formation patterns that were glowing faintly. Their bodies were bare and covered in various markings.

Their cultivation realms varied, some were at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, others as high as late stage Qi Cultivation Realm. However, all of them lay there mindlessly, dazed and unresponsive.

Seeing the group’s silence, Ju Wu stepped forward awkwardly and explained, “Shamanic spell arts often require blood sacrifices. These were... specifically raised... as offerings.”

Kongheng, having traveled extensively and seen much, had encountered such things often in the north. His eyes shut tightly, his face showing faint anger as he said gravely, “Human livestock.”

Li Xijun remained silent. So-called human livestock were akin to consumables like rice meat and blood slices. They were often made from cultivators, refined using various spiritual materials and alchemical substances. Finally becoming what they now saw.

“Judging by this, the Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators of Northern Mount Yue are all here.” Li Xijun responded softly, “Northern Mount Yue does not harvest resentment qi and blood qi. Instead, they stack up Qi Cultivation through sheer numbers of people, only to later turn them into human livestock...”

Xiao Yuansi glanced at the scene but remained silent. He gently lifted his sleeve and shook out a medicine cauldron.

The cauldron was entirely gray-white, appearing extremely sturdy. A gust of gray wind rose from its mouth, stirring among the human livestock. Screams erupted as flesh and skin flew in all directions, exposing eerie white bones. Chunks of meat peeled off the pig-like creatures’ faces, and eyeballs rolled to the ground.

In just a few seconds, their skin and flesh were stripped away. In the next, they dissolved into pools of blood. Another few seconds later, even their bones were reduced to dust.

Xiao Yuansi formed a seal with his fingers once more. The blood on the ground surged toward the cauldron and was swallowed cleanly by it. The jade surface beneath was left pristine, without a single trace. It was as if the human livestock had never existed.

What a remarkable dharma artifact...

The two brothers exchanged a glance. Kongheng let out a soft sigh and said warmly, “Shangqi Xun Wind... Such masterful technique, senior.”

Xiao Yuansi shook his head, seemingly lost in thought. He continued walking up the jade steps, where he soon encountered a vast jade wall along the cliffside.

The wall was covered with carvings of numerous spells. Some for transformation, others for blood sacrifices, venom curses, or hexes. Most required blood qi, resentment qi, or sacrificial offerings to cast. These were all of Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms. They were of little use to cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Ju Wu quickly explained, “Over the past centuries, Duanmu Kui occasionally had the whim to teach shamanic spells. There were six times in total. Everything he taught is recorded on this wall.”

Xiao Yuansi carefully examined every detail and committed it to memory. On the other hand, Li Xijun only casually glanced over it as he awaited his own people to record the inscriptions. Looking around, he did not find the spells that Mu Moli had previously cast, so he asked about it.

Ju Wu answered, “That green-faced ghost was something Mu Moli developed on his own... He kept proper talismanic rituals and transformation techniques at the Foundation Establishment Realm strictly to himself. There was no way he would teach us that!”

Ju Wu had clearly studied at Mount Wu itself, and spoke with evident resentment, “He got his hands on celestial texts and wielded Purple Mansion Realm shamanic spells with ease. Back then, he alone overpowered Chi Wei, Zhang Tianyuan, and Qing Jifang, while we, on the other hand, didn’t even have a single Foundation Establishment Realm shamanic spell to use!”

It’s no wonder that after Duanmu Kui’s death, the Mount Wu crowd defected to Azure Pond overnight...

Li Xijun listened carefully. It became clear that Duanmu Kui had never truly treated the Mount Wu cultivators as disciples. As such, the Mount Wu crowd had long shared a silent grievance. If they had possessed the strength to resist him, it was entirely possible that some would have abandoned Mount Wu for Azure Pond while Duanmu Kui was still alive.

As they spoke, Xiao Yuansi had memorized all the inscriptions on the jade wall. He stepped forward and spoke softly, “Answers to a Beggar’s Questions Under the Mulberry Tree is likely a Grade Seven or higher scripture. Only a few secluded sects from grotto-heaven and the cultivation techniques of Mount Luoxia could compare to it, let alone its exceptional material quality.”

Once they reached the summit, they saw a jade platform with numerous pillars of varying heights. These were inscribed with formation patterns for gathering spiritual energy. It seemed to be a dedicated cultivation ground.

The jade pillars varied in height, with the tallest featuring a jade throne, seemingly arranged according to status. They found a jade pool in the center, its blood long dried into blackened traces. A skeleton lay within, grotesque and grim.

Xiao Yuansi halted momentarily before stepping forward. He located the second-tallest jade pillar and tapped it three times in a precise sequence. The pillar instantly started to radiate light, its formation patterns glowing in sequence before ejecting a stone tablet. Xiao Yuansi caught it gently, brushed his hand over its surface and wiped away the protective layer of magical light.

Noting the astonished expressions of those around him, Xiao Yuansi remained silent for a moment before speaking, “There was a shaman who was a close friend of my uncle, Xiao Chuchou. His name was Dilu Tianfu. He specialized in talisman arts and also dabbled in demonic cultivation. His strength was formidable.”

A pained and complicated expression flashed across his face at the mention of Xiao Chuchou. His fists clenched unconsciously, and his breath grew slightly heavier as he continued, “Some time ago, as his lifespan approached its end, he sought to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. He rode the wind to my family, intending to entrust his affairs to us, only to learn that my uncle had long since passed away. So, he sought me out instead... He feared he would not survive his attempt to ascend and, having no heirs, left all his belongings behind. He also mentioned that he had hidden something in Mount Wu, which I have come to retrieve.”

When he saw Li Xijun nod in understanding, Xiao Yuansi handed the jade tablet to him and spoke softly, “You all examine this first. I will retrieve the rest.”

This is the reward.

Li Xijun accepted it with thanks, while Xiao Yuansi rode the wind toward a secluded part of the mountain. Meanwhile, Li Ximing gathered around to take a look at the jade tablet, which was engraved with an ancient secret technique.

Bone Carving Skin Exchange.

This secret technique recorded the Six Paths Blood Seeding Art, which required a certain level of cultivation to perform. The cultivator must capture a demonic beast alive and forcibly channel the demonic beast’s cultivation into themselves. This involved personally carving one’s bones and peeling one’s skin, then infusing their own body with the demonic beast’s blood and flesh, thereby absorbing its cultivation for personal use.

This technique required a demonic beast that shares a Dao resonance with the cultivator. Once it was completed, it allowed the user to assimilate the demonic beast’s cultivation, effectively possessing two Dao foundations within one body. This resulted in an immediate surge in power but, of course, permanently severed the possibility of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm.

“So, this is a demonic technique of Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace.”

Both of them had keen eyes and quickly discerned the nature of this technique. It was merely another method of consuming another’s Dao foundation. Every sect had records of similar methods and several major devils during the Devil Plague had practiced it.

This technique was rarer in the mainland, but it was more common overseas, where cultivation techniques were spread more freely and with fewer taboos. Many Purple Mansion and Golden Core Realms cultivators practiced it. They usually practiced it by refining humans instead of demonic beasts, which yielded a higher success rate and a better integration with their Immortal Foundation.

Li Ximing, who harbored ambitions for the Purple Mansion Realm, glanced at it but found no interest. He silently stepped away and began examining the other jade pillars. Li Xijun, however, took the jade tablet, looked over it briefly, and read aloud, “During the process... one experiences the utmost pain in the world, nearly obliterating one’s consciousness. Once mastered, one may be influenced by demonic natures... which can lead to changes in temperament.”

Li Xijun immediately clicked his tongue in surprise. Cultivation manuals were always written with extreme conciseness, often omitting even the author’s name. For it to specifically mention ‘pain’ was already notable, let alone ‘the utmost pain in the world’. It was likely even more excruciating than the Molten Metal Cave, which was infamous for its agony-based cultivation.

“What a shame. Too many drawbacks... Otherwise, it could be useful...” said Li Xijun.

Li Xijun was genuinely considering it. Not everyone could be like Li Xuanfeng. If the family’s resources were pooled into producing just one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator or even simply an invincible Foundation Establishment protector, this technique could be an option.

This technique has too many flaws, but it is still a useful method. Our family should consider collecting similar ones, thought Li Xijun.

He silently continued to ponder as he transcribed the jade tablet. He had long since abandoned any hope for the Purple Mansion Realm and had no personal ambitions. As long as he could protect his elder brother, Li Ximing, and his grand-nephew, Li Zhouwei, he would feel fulfilled.

My path to the Purple Mansion Realm has already been severed, so be it. If it means creating an invincible Foundation Establishment Realm guardian like Ancestor Xuanfeng, then I alone can still support the family even if Ximing fails to break through.

Li Ximing did not notice this, but Kongheng, who knew Li Xijun well, saw it clearly. He guessed at Li Xijun’s thoughts and mused to himself, I’ve heard that Li Yuanyun spent his life struggling in cultivation and died destitute at the border towns. He was the most neglected of his family... Yet somehow, his line produced the brilliant Xijun brothers. How interesting...

As everyone remained lost in thought, Xiao Yuansi drifted back with an elated expression. It seemed he had gained much. There was even a trace of a smile on his face.

“Senior!” said Li Xijun as he returned the jade tablet. Xiao Yuansi glanced at it, stored it away without much thought and instead asked, “Xijun, does your esteemed family have intentions of unifying Moongaze Lake?”

As soon as these words left his mouth, Li Ximing appeared slightly awkward, while Li Xijun fell silent in contemplation. The atmosphere cooled instantly. Sensing the tension, Kongheng subtly stepped away, closed his eyes and began chanting scriptures.




# Chapter 688: Unification

Since the Jiang Family split apart and fragmented into numerous smaller families, Moongaze Lake became a hidden source of profit for the Xiao Family. Although they did not demand tribute, the Xiao Family had controlled the various mines, spirit springs, and treasured lands on the eastern shore for over two hundred years.

Ultimately, in the eyes of the various families around the lake in earlier years, the Li Family was nothing more than a puppet propped up by the Xiao Family on the buffer zone of the southern shore. Following orders, the Li Family dismantled the Yu Family’s marketplace which led the Yu Family into gradual decline.

From a grand strategic perspective, Xiao Chuting merely played a single move, with minimal effort. Yet he managed to circumvent the ban on crossing domains beyond Azure Pond. He orchestrated the dramatic collapse of the Yu Family that was at its peak. It was a masterful stroke of calculation.

Now that the Li Family was expanding rapidly, they had become the dominant force on the lake. They showed ambitions of unifying the region. Naturally, this encroached upon the Xiao Family’s interests, making the Xiao Family’s stance all the more crucial.

Seeing Xiao Yuansi ask so directly, Li Xijun nodded slightly and replied softly, "The time is approaching. I intend to claim the Yu Family’s territory."

He mentioned only the Yu Family’s territory, signaling that he had no intention of interfering with the other families on the eastern shore. Upon hearing this, Xiao Yuansi did not say much but spoke softly, "Our sect’s Daoist Master recently met with Daoist Master Pu Yu of the Unison Sea’s Quhai Sect while receiving guests in the mountains. It is said that Daoist Master Yuanwu traveled to the Eastern Sea seeking medicine but was politely refused by Pu Yu. Yuanwu was quite displeased and left in a huff."

As soon as Xiao Yuansi said this, Li Xijun immediately understood. Xiao Yuansi continued saying, "Daoist Master Pu Yu’s divine abilities allow him to balance Yin and Yang and perceive life and death... His meaning was that Yuanwu’s six senses are collapsing internally, his essence dissipating externally and his consciousness growing dim. The dark radiance around him shows signs of sudden demise. It’s likely that he already has one foot in the underworld."

Upon hearing this, Li Ximing smiled slightly. Ju Wu, witnessing them discussing the life and death of a Daoist Master, was terrified. He kept his head lowered. Then, Li Ximing asked, "Was Daoist Master Yuanwu seeking an elixir of longevity? He seems to be only in the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm... Surely, he’s not attempting to break through to the Golden Core Realm?"

Xiao Yuansi replied softly, "He sought a Purple Mansion Lotus Water's Tranquil Origin for a body-snatching ritual. However, his divine arts have no connection to this path, it is an endeavor doomed to certain death. Daoist Master Pu Yu is a grandmaster in this field, how could he not see through it? Naturally, he refused to let him misuse it."

After finishing this explanation, he then added, "I must also take Ju Wu with me for further questioning. And Guiluan... did she fail her breakthrough and pass away in meditation?"

Li Xijun silently nodded. Xiao Yuansi had personally escorted the girl here for marriage back then. He couldn't help but sigh and said, "Upon hearing this, Guitu was deeply sorrowful. However, he has sealed the mountain and is not allowed to leave. He entrusted me to ask on his behalf, as a token of his condolences.

"Although Mount Wu is a place for witchcraft cultivation, its spiritual energy is quite extraordinary and could be put to great use. Once your esteemed family has cleared the dense forests, send a letter, and our family will surely come to offer our congratulations."

Xiao Yuansi said no more, cupping his hands lightly before grabbing the wailing and pleading Ju Wu. The two brothers escorted him out of the territory, then rode the wind back. Li Ximing remarked, "So Master’s stance is that the Xiao Family supports our family’s annexation of this land. The grand momentum is already in place."

Li Xijun responded softly, "Whether they support it or not, our family is set on taking Moongaze Lake. Given our ties, it’s only natural to turn this small benefit into goodwill."

Li Ximing nodded, glancing at the surrounding landscape before he said with a sigh, "The spiritual energy here is dense, there isn’t a single mountain in our family’s domain that can compare. Moving here for cultivation would be ideal."

Li Xijun only took a brief look before replying softly, "Among the lands of Mount Yue, only Huo Luo'e remains unyielding. We should press forward in one go and bring him under our governance."

The two soared on the wind. Li Xijun turned to Kongheng, who had remained silent the entire time, and asked, "Master Monk, who exactly is this Daoist Master Pu Yu?"

Kongheng pressed his hands together slightly and answered, "The overseas realms are vast, and the expanses of water are even greater than the mainland. Various sects exist, some hidden and some known. I have only heard that the Quhai Sect resides in Penglai, a sacred land that appears and disappears at times."

After some brief discussion, they soon arrived at Huo Luo'e’s territory. This was the southernmost area, it was close to Mount Dali. The region was sparsely populated and it appeared desolate.

Huo Luo'e had little presence among the Mount Yue regions. It was said that he was a reclusive cultivator with a taciturn nature, rarely interacting with others. Even his cultivation site was an openly accessible immortal mountain with weak protective formations.

He kept his mountain gates open and allowed anyone from Mount Yue with a spiritual orifice to enter and cultivate as they wished. He allowed them to learn as much or as little as they pleased. As a result, the mountain became widely occupied by various individuals, including some from the Li Family. Thus, the three of them traveled south and quickly arrived.

Li Xijun had already inquired about Huo Luo'e and developed an interest in recruiting him. Adopting a courteous approach before resorting to force, he called out in a powerful voice, "Li Xijun of the Qingdu Li family has come to pay a visit. Senior, please open the formation!"

After a few seconds, a figure rose on the wind. He was only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, appearing as a young man. He had a calm and respectful demeanor, his posture steady. He spoke politely. "I am Duan Duan. My master left for distant travels several months ago and left a message for me to convey."

He bowed his head deeply in utmost reverence and continued, "Huo Luo'e has occupied this sacred land for cultivation, offending many. Today, he follows the current eastward, heading to the Eastern Sea, never to return. All the spiritual items and talents he has gathered over forty years are left in Huo Luo Mountain, free for you to take."

Huo Luo'e ran away!

The two brothers exchanged glances, showing little surprise. Huo Luo'e either refused to join their sect or simply did not trust them. For him, avoiding a meeting altogether was the best option.

Descending into the mountain, they found that all the disciples had already opened the gates and surrendered. They were kneeling neatly in formation. There were only a few at the Qi Cultivation Realm and dozens at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. All of them looked well-trained. Dressed in eastern attire, they bowed their heads in submission and displayed no Mount Yue customs.

Li Xijun turned to look down at the Mount Yue lands beneath his feet, silently contemplating, The northern Mount Yue territories have all fallen into our hands. The entire southern shore of Moongaze Lake... now bears the Li name.

Several months later, at the royal court of Northern Mount Yue.

Blood dripped down the steps, pooling below. The silver-crafted throne gleamed, while toppled lampstands lay extinguished in the bloody water. Two rows of family soldiers stood silently.

Since the great defeat of Xian Du, Chen Yang and Dili Youjie had led two separate forces, sweeping through the entire Northern Mount Yue like a storm. Crushing all resistance, they reached the royal court.

The bright Radiant Origin Pass shone in the sky. Anyone in Northern Mount Yue could see its radiance upon looking up. With Eastern Mount Yue and the Li Family’s forces attacking simultaneously, the already crumbling Northern Mount Yue quickly fell entirely.

Dili Youjie knelt quietly at the foot of the steps, looking up at Li Zhouwei standing before the throne, silently contemplating, I wonder which prince they intend to support for this throne... or will they simply erase Northern Mount Yue and hand it to Li Jiman? That would be overly cumbersome...

As he was lost in thought, Li Zhouwei spoke in a low voice, "Dili Youjie, step forward."

The Mount Yue warrior hurriedly got up and ascended the steps in a few strides. A strong premonition surged in his heart, his blood rushing to his head. Then, he saw Li Zhouwei point his halberd at the silver throne and say softly, "Sit down."

Dili Youjie sat down in a daze, his mind exploding like lightning with thoughts racing through him. For a brief moment, he hallucinated spear tips pressing against his neck. Looking up, he saw the dazzling radiance above.

"Dili Youjie, the letter says you are young and capable. A grand fortune is being bestowed upon you, be sure to seize it!" said Li Zhouwei.

In just two short months, Dili Youjie had risen from a destitute family outside Great Jueting to the ruler of Northern Mount Yue. No matter how wildly he had imagined his future, he never thought grand fortune would mean this. He had assumed it was reserved for the esteemed families.

Li Zhouwei said nothing more, merely watching him in silence. Dili Youjie wiped away his tears and dropped to his knees with a thud, solemnly declaring, "The Dili Family will never betray its kin! The Dili Family will forever be the loyal hounds of the Grand Concord of Radiance...!"

He murmured his vow twice, but Li Zhouwei did not put much faith in mere words. Holding his halberd, he listened silently. Then, the sound of footsteps echoed from the courtyard, and several figures entered. There were some burly men wielding golden hammers and other elderly men with heads full of white hair. Leading them was a young man clad in a wolf-fur cloak, radiating a powerful aura.

Li Zhouwei put away his weapon, glanced at him and ordered, "Step down."

Dili Youjie was stunned but hurriedly withdrew. He then saw Li Zhouwei put away his weapon and descend quickly from the high platform, bowing respectfully. He said, "Minghuang greets father."

Li Chengliao nodded. Before anyone could speak, a subordinate stepped forward and reported, "General Chen has arrived!"

Chen Yang strode forward, his sword still dripping with blood. His demeanor had changed after the fierce battles. Looking toward the highest position in the hall, he saw a young man standing there, lost in thought.

"Peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

Chen Yang had advanced to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, developing his spiritual sense and finally gaining the ability to perceive others’ cultivation. When he examined Li Zhouwei, he realized that Zhouwei was already prepared to enter seclusion for the Qi Cultivation Realm at any moment. This caused his heart to pause.

As he hesitated, he quickly noticed another figure in the hall. A broad-shouldered man draped in wolf fur, standing with his hands behind his back. He was at the Qi Cultivation Realm.

"Chen Yang greets the Patriarch!" said Chen Yang.

Li Chengliao nodded and before anyone could speak, he said with a chuckle, "Not bad."
𝘧𝘳𝘦ℯ𝓌𝘦𝒷𝘯𝑜𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸𝘰𝓂

Li Chengliao glanced around, then sat at the head seat and spoke softly, "In these past months, the Mount Yue territories have nearly been settled. I will keep this brief."

As he entered, he had already seen the scene of Dili Youjie seated on the royal court’s throne. Li Chengliao understood that his eldest son had chosen Dili Youjie as the ruler of Northern Mount Yue and immediately declared, "Dili Youjie shall be established as the ruler of Northern Mount Yue. The borders shall remain unchanged. Cultivators from our family will enter to survey the spirit fields and examine the spiritual energy. All governing systems will follow the precedents set by Eastern Mount Yue.

"The former territories of Huo Luo'e and Fei Luoya shall all be incorporated under Eastern Mount Yue’s domain. As for the eight easternmost towns of Eastern Mount Yue, which are now largely populated by Easterners. They shall be restructured into a new prefecture and placed under the governance of Wutu Peak."

These matters had been agreed upon before the expedition but repeating them ensured that Li Zhouwei heard them clearly. Seeing that he had no objections, Li Chengliao waved his hand and instructed the gathered officials to take their men and begin surveying the spirit fields. He said, "You may all leave."

Dili Youjie, still kneeling, glanced around carefully. Not seeing Li Jiman’s figure, he let out a deep breath of relief.

Realizing that this future rival, whom he would inevitably have conflicts with, had not only lost the most prosperous lands but wasn’t even given a seat in the family discussions. Dili Youjie felt a great sense of satisfaction and secretly rejoiced in his heart, Li Jiman, your era is over. Now, it is the second lineage that holds the family power. The Grand Concord of Radiance personally appointed me as ruler. The only thing you surpass me in is cultivation...

Having only just ascended to this position, his mindset had already shifted. Brushing the dust from his robe, he left the hall and began his own silent calculations.

As the others departed, only Li Chengliao and his son remained in the hall. At last, a trace of concern appeared on Li Chengliao’s face as he spoke softly, "There are two matters I must inform you of... First, the senior White Ape has entered seclusion to attempt a breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Hm?" Li Zhouwei was slightly taken aback. The White Ape had protected him since childhood, and he had deep feelings for it. Now hearing this news, he asked, "There likely isn’t an Essence Gathering Pill, is there?"

"Of course not." Li Chengliao sighed and replied, "This pill has long been controlled by Azure Pond. Even a powerful family like the Xiao Family must rely on connections within the sect to obtain it... When your granduncle made his breakthrough, he may not have even had this pill to aid him."

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze slightly, but then saw Li Chengliao gather his thoughts and deliver an even greater piece of news. He said, "Your grandfather... has entered seclusion to attempt a breakthrough to Foundation Establishment Realm. Several of your uncles have already returned to witness it..."

Although Li Xicheng’s innate ability was not as high as his brothers’, he was more than ten years their senior. After years of tempering himself, he had long since reached the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Now, it seemed he had finally decided to attempt his breakthrough.




# Chapter 690: News From Both Side

Yi Mountain City.

The formations over Yi Mountain City glowed brightly, their intricate patterns appearing especially sharp in the winter snow. Golden light approached from afar, landing upon the city walls.

“Greetings, General!”

Li Xuanfeng rode the wind toward the city, carrying in his hand the corpse of a scaly demonic beast. Its blue eyes stared lifelessly at the sky, long dead. The guards on either side stepped back respectfully, addressing him as General.

He nodded briefly and descended the steps. Then, he walked straight to his residence and pushed the door open. The house had no servants and was somewhat dimly lit. Inside, a young man crouched in the courtyard, carefully adjusting a longbow in his hands.

At the brief sound of the door opening, the young man lifted his gaze. His features bore a seventy-percent resemblance to Li Xuanfeng. Especially his sharp eyebrows which carried a rebellious air. With just a glance, he raised a brow and said, “Father, you have returned.”

There was no particular excitement in his tone, though his lips trembled slightly with some unspoken emotion. He turned toward the courtyard and called out, “Mother!”

Li Xuanfeng stood quietly, the air in the residence growing noticeably colder due to the residual water qi emanating from the dead beast in his grasp. Li Xuanfeng watched as the youth turned his back, his expression remaining composed.

“Husband!” Ning Hemian rushed out from the courtyard. She had aged as well, now in the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. She hurried to his side, her eyes pausing momentarily on the gruesome wound on his neck. Her voice trembled softly as she choked back tears, “Oh...”

Li Xuanfeng gently patted her back, tossing the severed tail of the beast aside. His hands were covered in fine, scale-like wounds. He spoke in a low voice, “They were mostly young ones. I merely killed too hastily and inevitably suffered a few wounds.”

Li Yuanqin stood nearby, glancing at the wounds on his father’s hands. One hand was tucked into his sleeve, while the other gripped his bow tightly, as if deep in thought.

Ning Hemian sobbed softly against his chest twice before quickly composing herself and saying, “Since you have returned, you must go see the Daoist Master at once. His moods have been unpredictable in recent years and many of my brothers have suffered his wrath.”

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly, turned the scaly aquatic beast sideway, and sliced open its belly. From within, he retrieved dozens of silk pouches that were all tied together in a bundle. The pouches were dripping with blood and hanging from a jade talisman.
𝗳𝐫𝚎𝗲𝚠𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝘃𝚎𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺

He picked up the bundle, concealed his presence and silently slipped out of the residence.

Li Yuanqin saw everything clearly but remained silent. Only after Li Xuanfeng disappeared did a flicker of realization and a shadow of resentment rise in his expression. Ning Hemian called his name twice before he snapped back to attention and softly responded, “Mother.”

Ning Hemian frowned and said in a low voice, “Your father rarely has the chance to return, only a few times in ten years. Why do you show no joy at all?”

Li Yuanqin remained silent. Suddenly, a bright and youthful voice rang out from outside the residence. “Brother Qin, are you home?!”

“It’s the two brothers of the Chi Family again!” Ning Hemian showed some displeasure but said nothing further. Li Yuanqin picked up his bow and strode quickly out of the courtyard. A bright smile appeared on his face as he pushed open the gate, revealing two young men standing outside. Both of them were at the Qi Cultivation Realm.

The leader of the two exuded a refined aura, with striking features and a sword in his arms. He smiled softly at Li Yuanqin and said, “Brother Yuanqin.”

“Brother Fuxuan,” replied Li Yuanqin.

The three exchanged warm greetings and strolled into the street together. Li Yuanqin seemed entirely unaffected by his father’s injuries, exuding a carefree demeanor. The two Chi brothers exchanged glances before the leading youth asked, “We heard the General has returned to the city. How is he?”

“Him?” Li Yuanqin played with his longbow, speaking casually, “He went straight to see the Daoist Master as soon as he arrived. How would I know what he’s planning? The only thing I hope for is to inherit his archery skills but he still refuses to teach me!”

The two Chi brothers burst into laughter, while Li Yuanqin swaggered down the street with his hands behind his back. He was looking bold and unrestrained. Raising an eyebrow, he declared, “Let’s go drink!”

The Chi brothers exchanged a glance, then stepped forward. They linked arms with him and wild amusement was glinting in their eyes.

The Chi brothers trailed behind him, one of them smirking as he transmitted a message via spiritual sense, Li Xuanfeng has been away for ten years, leaving this boy completely unchecked. He has already become a spoiled wastrel under our control. The family’s arrangement is truly brilliant! As long as we hold this kid in our hands and once Yuan Su dies, Li Xuanfeng will be forced to obey our family to protect his family.

The other brother stroked his beard contentedly and responded through spiritual sense, Moreover, Li Yuanqin’s seniority within the Li Family is exceptionally high. In another fifty or sixty years, he will be one of the highest-ranked individuals in the Li Family. If we send him back to Qingdu, their family will lose nearly half of its autonomy.

As the two reveled in their scheme, they glanced ahead at Li Yuanqin. He was also smiling. Inheriting his father’s naturally fierce features, his grin carried an inexplicable, chilling coldness.

————

Li Xuanfeng rode the wind into the cave dwelling and found it shrouded in thick white mist. The great doors were already open, as if awaiting his arrival.

Stepping inside, he saw Daoist Master Yuan Su seated at the highest position as always. However, his face was now veiled in mist which obscured his features entirely.

Opposite him sat a young man in a flowing blue-and-white robe. His features were strikingly handsome and his brows were delicately arched, carrying a hint of femininity. He held a jade cup while sipping leisurely. He smiled as he looked down at Li Xuanfeng.

“Xuanfeng greets the two Daoist Masters.”

Judging by the young man’s demeanor, he was most likely also a Daoist Master. Li Xuanfeng bowed low, like a golden mountain toppling, before seeing the handsome youth nod in acknowledgement while Yuan Su simply waved his hand and said, “Li Xuanfeng.”

After speaking, he turned his gaze to Li Xuanfeng and said with a gesture, “This is Daoist Master Pu Yu, Sect Master of the Quhai Sect in Penglai.”

Li Xuanfeng bowed again, but before he could speak, Daoist Master Pu Yu gently said, “No need for such formalities. My sect’s founding ancestor was a cultivator from the Wei State. We share some distant fate.”

As he spoke, his striking eyes suddenly gleamed with a deep, ethereal blue light. He focused intently on Li Xuanfeng and let out a soft sound of intrigue.

Yuan Su, appearing unsurprised, merely poured himself a drink and sipped. Pu Yu then spoke softly, “Your blood qi is exceptional, your strength innate... truly, a fine body.”

He made this remark without the slightest attempt to conceal his meaning. Chuckling twice, he then asked, “Senior Yuan Su, do you intend to inhabit this body?”

Li Xuanfeng’s expression remained unchanged as he silently listened. Yuan Su let out a muffled chuckle, the mist over his face rippling slightly, before he lazily replied, “Forget it. I’m not accustomed to using another’s body, nor am I willing to practice such arts. If I had truly cared for such things, I would have reached the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm long ago. Why struggle to prolong life today?”

Pu Yu chuckled softly and replied, “The mainland is rigid and dull and you, Yuan Su, are the most rigid of them all.”

Yuan Su laughed heartily and responded, “If I were to practice the Profound Method of Continuation, Chi Wei would probably laugh himself back to life and the Creeping Fig Immortal Sword might just split the great void to chop my head off.”

Daoist Master Pu Yu fell silent for a moment, then murmured, “Li Jiangqun...”

Yuan Su waved his hand dismissively and simply asked, “What’s the situation in the Northern Sea?”

Daoist Master Pu Yu replied, “Qing Jifang and the others detected signs of spiritual energy fluctuations in the Northern Sea. When they reached the farthest north, a torrential jade rain suddenly began to fall, scaring them into fleeing immediately.”

“So it’s in the Northern Sea.” Yuan Su showed no surprise as he responded, “The conflicts between the Yue Cultivating Sect factions are nothing but a facade. Their true preparations have long been in the Northern Sea. I suspect Qing Jifang was acting under the orders of the one from Mount Changhuai, deliberately seeking out that location.”

“Exactly.” Daoist Master Pu Yu nodded and said gently, “Since it has already been discovered, there’s no need to keep it hidden. In a few days, the Yue Cultivating Sect will likely send out invitations for an observation ceremony.”




# Chapter 691: News From Both Sides

Having reached this point in their discussion, they took the opportunity to mock Yuanwu for a bit before losing interest in further conversation. Daoist Master Pu Yu cupped his hands in farewell, glanced at Li Xuanfeng with a smile, and remarked, “This one has a resolute heart and the potential to traverse the mortal world unhindered. His future is bright. My friend, why not break through the Golden Tang Gate and retrieve the Heavenly Lustrous Gold Sutra?”

The mist on Yuan Su’s face wavered slightly, revealing a faintly ruthless expression beneath. He simply replied, “That little brat of Situ is still alive. I fear it’s a trap.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Daoist Master Pu Yu had already vanished. Only then did Yuan Su finally dispel the mist from his face.

Daoist Master Pu Yu could manipulate Yin and Yang and perceive life and death. Moreover, he was an overseas cultivator. If Yuan Su did not conceal himself, he feared he might end up ensnared in another scheme, just as Yuanwu had before him. Thus, he had no choice but to keep his face hidden.

Now that Pu Yu was gone, Yuan Su finally relaxed and turned to Li Xuanfeng, asking, “What do you think?”

Li Xuanfeng replied, “I have fulfilled ninety percent of the Daoist Master's command. The remaining targets are either hiding in the mountains or refusing to leave their islands. I lack the ability to pinpoint them.”

Yuan Su waved his hand indifferently, lifting a large bundle of storage pouches from the ground. As expected, they were all unopened. He tapped them twice on the table.

Soon, footsteps echoed from the entrance of the cave. Ning Heyuan rushed in and Yuan Su picked up the bundle of storage pouches, casually tossing it into his arms as he said, “Take these to Chi Zhiyun. You should know what to say.”

Ning Heyuan bowed deeply and quickly retreated. The mist swirled in the cave, leaving only Yuan Su and Li Xuanfeng.

Yuan Su leaned back against the jade throne, a trace of fatigue showing on his face and said softly, “Do not wander outside in the coming days. Yuanwu is going to cause a stir before his end. Once his life ends, you will accompany me to the Northern Sea for the ceremony.”

Li Xuanfeng acknowledged the command and slowly backed away. Only when he had reached the cave entrance did he lift his head. For a fleeting moment, the mist-shrouded jade platform no longer seemed to hold Yuan Su, but instead, a vast pool of crystal-clear water.

A melancholic flute melody drifted past his ears, ethereal and mournful. Only after stepping out of the cave did Li Xuanfeng finally regain his composure, sighing inwardly, “Yuan Su does not have much time left.”

Green Pine Island.

Green Pine Island was not particularly large, but in recent years, it had been nourished by spiritual energy. The geomantic lines had grown stronger, causing the entire mountain to rise several times in height. Even the underwater mountain range gradually surfaced. Apart from the territories that had already been divided among various sects, some overseas forces of the Foundation Establishment Realm had begun establishing outposts there.

Yet ten years passed in the blink of an eye and the spiritual energy of Green Pine Island dwindled year by year. After all, it was never truly a blessed land, merely a former resting place of an ancient grotto heaven. Now, it was gradually returning to its original state.

As one of the most renowned forces in the mainland, the Azure Pond Sect occupied an entire peak of its own. The mountain was covered in green pines and the northern winds howled relentlessly.

Li Xizhi sat quietly in the mountains, while beside a jade table stood Li Yuexiang. She wore a flowing robe, gripping her sword as faint sparks of flame flickered around her. Blessed by the island’s spiritual energy, she had progressed swiftly over the years and had now broken through to the fifth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Xizhi, as composed as ever, had reached the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm. His spells had become even more refined. As he meditated quietly on his spells, shimmering rainbow lights appeared around him and radiated an aura of mystery.

After a brief wait, someone approached and reported, “Daoist, Han Shizhen has come to visit.”

“Let him up,” said Li Xizhi.

Hearing that Han Shizhen had arrived, Li Yuexiang quickly found an excuse to leave. Li Xizhi put away his jade slip and saw a middle-aged man step forward, wearing a broad smile as he greeted, “Greetings, Daoist!”

This man was the head of the Han Family from Dongliu. His cultivation was decent and as a heir in his younger years, he had personally visited the Li Family and established ties with them. Through this connection, he had partnered with the Li Family in the trade of Wanglin Blossom.

The Han Family was relatively close to this place. Han Shizhen had a sociable nature, willing to be both generous and humble when needed. This allowed him to establish connections easily. When he heard that the Li Family had stationed a Daoist Master here, he immediately became interested. Over the years, he visited over a dozen times, bearing gifts and making efforts to build rapport. Until finally, he was granted an audience on the mountain.

Since they already had some prior ties, Li Xizhi let him be. After years of persistence, Han Shizhen had indeed managed to build a closer relationship.

Han Shizhen, with an eager smile, exchanged some pleasantries before getting to the point. He said, “I have come with important news for the Daoist.”

Seeing Li Xizhi turn his gaze towards him, he put on a solemn expression and said in a serious tone, “Daoist, I have uncovered some clues. Yuan Chengdun may already be dead!”

“What?”

Li Xizhi merely frowned, but then Han Shizhen hurriedly pulled a piece of bluish stone from his sleeve and handed it over, speaking in a grave tone, “A few days ago, a group of rogue cultivators from the Qunyi Strait brought back a number of spirit item and sold them in our family’s market. My men kept reporting that these spirit items were unlike anything they had seen before.

“I went to inspect them myself and consulted several ancient texts. That’s when I identified this as Demon Suppressing Stone, a material long extinct overseas but still found in the mainland. When I pressed the rogue cultivators for details, they claimed that these stones suddenly appeared in midair and dropped into the sea.

“I had heard that Yuan Chengdun practiced Sprawling Azure Mountain, a cultivation method that, upon death, transforms the body into this very type of spirit item. Suspicious, I investigated further and found a considerable amount of these stones at the seabed.”

Li Xizhi, well-versed in such matters, immediately understood what he was implying. He murmured, “You mean… he perished inside a secret realm, transformed into spirit items as his body returned to nature, then the items were all expelled from the realm and landed in the sea?”

“Daoist, your insight is sharp!” Han Shizhen immediately flattered him. Li Xizhi had received much favor from his master and was particularly concerned about Yuan Tuan. Over the years, he had searched all over the Eastern Sea for clues. Knowing this, Han Shizhen did not hesitate to report any findings to him.

Now that he had finally obtained a clue regarding Yuan Tuan, Li Xizhi’s heart stirred, and he asked, “Did you find the two Demon Subduing Copper Rods?”

Han Shizhen shook his head. Li Xizhi pondered for a brief moment before deducing and said, “If Yuan Chengdun truly perished in this event, then the Demon Subduing Copper Rods must have already been taken. Those rogue cultivators likely have them. But such treasures are far too valuable, they must be hiding them carefully and would never admit it to you.”

Han Shizhen was briefly stunned but quickly realized the truth. He said regretfully, “I was careless! Once I had my suspicions, I rushed to inform you and didn’t dare delay. I should have captured them immediately.”

Li Xizhi, long aware that Eastern Sea cultivators operated with little regard for morality, was unsurprised. He said in a low voice, “I will accompany you to that market. While we’re there, I will take a look at exactly where in the Qunyi Strait this occurred.”




# Chapter 692: The Fall Of A Purple Mansion Master

Azure Pond Sect, Yuanwu Peak.

The news that Daoist Master Yuanwu was about to pass away had gradually spread. This Daoist Master at the Purple Mansion Realm was constantly shuttling in and out of the sect, and all the disciples understood the situation tacitly, not daring to bring it up.

Yuanwu Peak stood tall, shrouded in mist, with fire veins surging. This peak was Azure Pond Sect’s sacred mountain dedicated to artifact refining. Usually, cultivators came and went in a bustling scene but now it appeared rather desolate, as if people were deliberately avoiding it.

After all, Yuanwu was now the most unreasonable person in and outside the sect. Even if he encountered someone he found unlucky on the road and killed them with a wave of his sleeve, no one would dare seek justice.

Tang Shedu stepped out of his cave dwelling. With the sound of his armor clanking, he was looking rather troubled.

Tang Shedu had not gained any benefits in the grotto heaven. Instead, he had suffered serious injuries. Knowing that Yuanwu had been prone to madness these past years, he used the excuse of recovery to keep delaying, staying in seclusion on the peak for over a decade.

Now, however, he had reached a point where he could no longer avoid meeting Yuanwu. If he continued to hide, Yuanwu might one day remember him and slap him to death, tearing through the great void in the process.

Before he even reached the mountainside, he saw a young-looking man standing at the mountain entrance. The man startled Tang Shedu, who quickly said, “Greetings, Daoist Master Yuan Su.”

Yuan Su held a jade flask, seemingly still drinking. He waved his hand lazily, as if swatting away flies and said softly, “I’m just here to watch him die. It has nothing to do with you.”

Seeing Yuan Su’s carefree demeanor, Tang Shedu broke into a cold sweat, nearly crying inside. Yuan Su was sharp-tongued and would never miss such a golden opportunity to mock Yuanwu, only making things harder for them.

He hurried up the mountain and saw another person standing in front of the grand hall. This man did not wear the sect’s blue robes but was draped in a brocade robe. He had short facial hair, sallow skin, a thin and long face. His lifeless eyes were filled with extreme fear.

This man was Yu Su, another key figure on Yuanwu Peak who was notorious for his greed.

The two exchanged glances, both wearing mournful expressions. The grand hall, which was usually gleaming with golden light, was now dim and lifeless. The ever-dominant Yuanwu was nowhere to be seen. Instead, a white-haired old man sat kneeling at the hall entrance, his hair was disheveled as he stared blankly.

Tang Shedu’s legs trembled as he listened to the clanking of metal from within the hall. He wished he could gouge out his own eyes at that moment. He lowered his head to his chest as he stammered, “Master…”

Yuanwu, dazed and groggy, squinted his eyes to look and said in surprise, “Cheng’er, Xiuxian, you two are here.”

The two of them immediately turned pale, kneeling in silence.

Tang Shedu and Yu Su naturally understood these two names. One was Tang Yuanwu’s son, Tang Shecheng. The other was their former senior brother, Yu Xiuxian.

Tang Yuanwu was ruthless and unfeeling, yet the only ones he had ever cared about were these two. Back when they were alive, Yuanwu Peak had a completely different atmosphere and Tang Yuanwu still had a smile on his face.

Back then, Tang Shedu had merely been a collateral disciple, following Tang Shecheng around like a lackey. Yu Su, due to his greedy nature, was often strung up and beaten by his elder brother, Yu Xiuxian, wailing through the night.

Later, Tang Shecheng perished when he failed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and Yu Xiuxian was killed by Guo Er of Crimson Reef Island. Yuanwu had been powerless to change their fates. From then on, his temperament grew increasingly extreme which led to his current state.

The two of them knelt there, too afraid to speak. Tang Yuanwu, hair disheveled and eyes vacant, took a step forward. He reached out to pull Tang Shedu closer, asking, “Ah… Cheng’er… why are you wearing armor? How many times have I told you… wear a Daoist robe… look more carefree… Ah… wearing a Daoist robe is better…”

Though Tang Shedu both feared and resented Tang Yuanwu, his feelings for Tang Shecheng ran deep. He couldn’t help but shed tears. Yu Su was also moved as he listened. Tang Yuanwu then reached for Yu Su, asking, “Why are you dressed so extravagantly!… Xiuxian, you’re finally thinking about yourself… Your younger brother was useless… Ah… learn more Daoist spells… don’t just cultivate…”

Yu Su had already been holding back tears, but when he heard this, he could no longer contain himself. The notoriously greedy and ruthless Jinmao Xi burst into loud sobs.

That cry was a mistake. It instantly snapped Tang Yuanwu out of his moment of tenderness and confusion. The coldness and madness returned to his eyes, and a fiery brilliance reignited in him as he erupted in fury, “You worthless wretch! What are you crying for? I’m not dead yet!”

Yuanwu struck Yu Su’s chest with a palm which sent him spewing blood across the floor. He tumbled down from the high platform and rolled over and over. His brocade robe was soaked in blood as he struggled to get up, kowtowing in anguish. “Master!”

That single cry caused Yuanwu to lower his raised hand. His gaze averted, as if avoiding Yu Su, before landing coldly on Tang Shedu.

Tang Shedu’s lips were deathly pale as he stared straight at him. Yuanwu flew into a rage and cursed, “Rebellion! Everything is in revolt!”

He kicked Tang Shedu squarely in the chest. A series of sharp cracking sounds echoed as bones shattered. Tang Shedu fell from the high platform like a bird with broken wings. Yuanwu coughed up a mouthful of golden powder and spat, “Worthless wretch!”

The sky churned with storm clouds and a massive spiral was gradually forming. At its center, the sky was blank and cloudless, leaving only a deep golden radiance shining directly upon the floating figure of the white-haired old man.
𝚏𝕣𝕖𝚎𝚠𝚎𝚋𝚗𝐨𝐯𝕖𝕝.𝕔𝐨𝕞

Yuanwu’s hair was in disarray, his eyes bulging as he gazed at the torrential downpour of golden grains and iron dust falling from the heavens. He let out a wail that no longer sounded human.

All of Mount Azure Pond was engulfed in the metal storm, blinding everyone within it. Each person was as if stranded on an isolated island, unable to distinguish those around them. Daoist Master Yuan Su’s expression grew solemn as he raised his jade cup and made a distant toast toward the sky.

“Senior brother… go well.”

In the seventh month, Tang Yuanwu of Azure Pond perished through self-dissolution. Golden rain fell like a waterfall, iron dust descended like sand, his spiritual sense shattered beyond measure. When the rain finally subsided, stepping outside, one could see that the green peak had turned to gold within ten meters radius.

----

Green Pine Island.

“I will go with you to that market and take a look at where exactly it lies within the Qunyi Strait.”

After saying this, Li Xizhi paused for a moment. Both he and his companion’s expressions changed as they sensed the violent fluctuation of spiritual energy in the heavens and earth. Without hesitation, they rose into the sky, one following behind the other.

Green Pine Island was home to many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and soon, numerous figures could be seen gathering in the sky. They were all turning toward the south in unison. Their expressions ranged from complicated to mocking to cold sneers as they whispered among themselves.

“Yuanwu has fallen!”

Li Xizhi’s expression was somewhat conflicted. Though Yuanwu had never had a good relationship with his own faction, he was still a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. With a soft sigh, he slightly bowed to show his respect.

After a brief moment, the golden-metal storm in the distance quickly subsided. Li Xizhi turned back and summoned a disciple from Azure Pond Sect, instructing him in front of Han Shizhen, “I have obtained a lead from the peak master and will make a trip to the Han Family. Inform the others to avoid them coming one after another for instructions, only to waste their efforts.”

Han Shizhen lowered his head in silence. The disciple responded and left. Only then did Li Xizhi offer an apology, he said, “The sect has many rules, I ask for your understanding.”

Han Shizhen dared not say much and hurriedly responded, “I wouldn’t dare… wouldn’t dare… it is only proper.”

Without further delay, they rode the wind together. After two days, they descended into the market city. As soon as the market’s grand formation opened, the Han Family cultivators hurriedly approached and called out for their family head.

“Daoist, please take a look! This is our Tu Liu Market.” Han Shizhen ignored them, falling half a step behind Li Xizhi, smiling as he introduced the place in a soft voice, “Daoist, please follow me to the main hall for a short rest while I inquire about the whereabouts of those rogue cultivators.”

Hearing this, Li Xizhi furrowed his brows slightly and sensed something amiss. He followed Han Shizhen into the grand hall and took a seat at the side. Han Shizhen took two steps back, exited the hall and his smile quickly faded.

A burly man stepped forward with a heavy expression. Han Shizhen spoke in a low voice, “What did those men say?”

The burly man simply replied, “We searched one man’s soul. The others are beyond recognition.”

It turned out that although Han Shizhen claimed to have released them, he had long since skinned, dismembered and extracted their souls. The Demon Subduing Copper Rods had already fallen into the Han Family’s hands. But now, he regretted his actions and murmured, “If I had known Li Xizhi was this perceptive, I wouldn’t have taken that Demon Subduing Copper Rods. Now I can’t explain things properly. If any of them said something wrong, he might detest my family. I can only claim they escaped…”

Yuan Chengdun’s weapons were Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts, and a pair at that. Naturally, Han Shizhen had been tempted. Now, he could only go along with his lie. After waiting outside for a moment, he stepped back inside. Putting on a smile, he said apologetically, “Daoist! It was my carelessness. Those men sold their goods and immediately scattered in all directions without staying for a moment… As for the Demon Subduing Copper Rods, it is beyond our reach.”

It seems Yuan Chengdun truly has perished. Li Xizhi sat at the head of the hall, holding his teacup, but he did not believe a word of it. He thought in his heart, Han Shizhen, you’ve established yourself in the Eastern Sea, you're no benevolent figure. Upon learning of a Foundation Establishment Realm inheritance, you must have fabricated an excuse to capture those rogue cultivators. You just wanted to keep that pair of Foundation Establishment artifacts for yourself.

Li Xizhi had no desire for those artifacts, so he didn’t bother exposing him. Instead, he casually waved his hand and asked, “Is there any news about that location?”

Han Shizhen immediately answered, “Fortunately, my men asked beforehand. We already know its location.”

“Then let us depart.” Li Xizhi rose and said softly, “In that case, I must trouble you to collect those Demon Suppressing Stones. My family had some ties with Senior Yuan Chengdun. Sending them to Mushroom Forest Plain would at least fulfill a portion of that bond.”

Having already taken the Demon Subduing Copper Rods, Han Shizhen was feeling uneasy and dared not say more. He nodded repeatedly and led the way as they rode the wind, heading toward the Qunyi Strait.

Li Xizhi pondered along the way, flying far into the Qunyi Sea. The vast ocean stretched before them, with the golden crow sun hanging high, its scorching rays blazing down. Below them, on the scattered islets, the sea tribes looked up one by one.

Han Shizhen, accompanied by a burly man, flew straight toward a location within the vast seascape. He came to a slow stop above the water without even surveying the surroundings before cupping his fists and saying, “Family Head, Daoist, this is the place!”

Han Shizhen’s expression flickered, while Li Xizhi suddenly understood, thinking to himself, So they searched their souls… Those rogue cultivators must already be dead.

Han Shizhen carefully observed Li Xizhi. Seeing his expression remain unchanged, he finally gestured and said, “Daoist… please proceed…”

The three of them split up, flying down in different directions. After searching for several days, Han Shizhen finally came to a slow stop on the ocean floor and found nothing.

He paused several times, gradually losing motivation. Li Xizhi’s matters had nothing to do with him as he was only acting out of self-interest. He had his eyes on that secret realm, which was the only reason he had been willing to assist.

Now, waiting idly, he sat down beside a reef. Suddenly, a pair of long boots appeared before him.

The boots shimmered in a deep blue hue, silver-bright, their intricate craftsmanship and ornate patterns revealing them as anything but ordinary. Han Shizhen had no time to marvel, his initial surprise instantly turned into sheer terror.

This is…! His thoughts flickered like lightning in his mind. He hurriedly looked up, meeting a pair of emerald-green eyes and was so terrified that he immediately pleaded, “This humble one greets… greets the great demonic beast, Muhai…I…”

He stammered a couple of words, but suddenly, all sorts of illusions surged before his eyes. The water and sky around him trembled violently before he plunged into a deep and overwhelming darkness.

----

Li Xizhi naturally found nothing except for a few pieces of Demon Suppressing Stone on the seabed, which he collected one by one before pausing in the depths of the ocean.

With a secret realm like this, how could a mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator possibly find it without a specialized method?

He settled atop a reef, closing his eyes to cast a spell to summon his Immortal Mirror. But suddenly, his scalp tingled and his entire body trembled. The core within his qihai acupoints quivered slightly, forcing him to stop.

Li Xizhi hesitated momentarily before reopening his eyes, only to meet a pair of emerald-green pupils directly.

Standing right in front of him was a middle-aged man with sharp, narrow eyes and wild, flame-colored hair. His robe shimmered in gold, resembling the glimmer of scales. He was so close, barely a fist's distance, that Li Xizhi could feel the cold radiating from him.

Those emerald-green pupils stared at Li Xizhi icily, reflecting his own gray-black eyes within them.

In his hands, he held two severed heads, their empty eyes staring blankly at the sky. Their expressions strangely carried a hint of joy. One had neatly combed hair, while the other’s beard and hair were wildly disheveled.

“It’s Han Shizhen and his retainer!” muttered Li Xizhi.

It had only been a few days since they had separated, yet both men had met a violent end. Li Xizhi’s hair stood on end as he watched the radiant energy of the opponent’s divine powers flow like liquid from his feet, spreading like lightning and enveloping him instantly.

“A Purple Mansion Realm… cultivator…” said Li Xizhi.

He was completely immobilized and could only meet the cold gaze of this Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. The man narrowed his eyes slightly, but when he spoke, his voice was clear and bright, it was utterly unfitting for his fierce appearance. “Who sent you… Si Boxiu or Tang Yuanwu?”

Li Xizhi watched as the divine energy swirling around him turned a deep azure, casting a brilliant blue glow over his face. His thoughts flickered like lightning, and he quickly answered, “Reporting to the Daoist Master! It was none of these two.”

The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master slowly halted, revealing a strange expression. His emerald eyes blinked slightly, their hue deepening as if he had gleaned a great deal from Li Xizhi’s body. His red hair floated in the water as he sneered inwardly, Quite the audacity!

His gaze darkened, making it impossible to discern his true thoughts. As if suddenly amused, he chuckled and asked, “Was it Sui Guan?”

Li Xizhi, however, shook his head and respectfully replied, “This junior came of his own accord. My master has been missing for over a decade, yet the sect has remained unresponsive. It was my duty to seek him out personally. I had no intention of offending you, Senior.”

The Purple Mansion Daoist Master listened to his words, his gaze gliding coldly over Li Xizhi. His golden robe shimmered as he responded, “Someone wants you dead.”

Upon seeing the severed heads in his hands, how could Li Xizhi fail to grasp the situation? Green Pine Island had been given to him to guard, it was a prime location, conveniently granting him access to the Eastern Sea. Someone in the sect must have been waiting for this very moment! As long as he died swiftly, Qingsui Peak would inevitably fall into the hands of the Yuan Family!

Clearly, those rogue cultivators came and went without issue, there must be some kind of restriction or agreement in place! Chi Zhiyun must have suppressed the information, keeping it secret, just waiting for me to walk straight into this trap!




# Chapter 694: Dongfang Heyun

This place must have been a subject of negotiation between the Azure Pond Sect’s Purple Mansion cultivators and the Dragon Clan, where certain promises were made. A Foundation Establishment cultivator searching here must have violated a taboo.

Li Xizhi quickly formed a hypothesis, but this was not the time to dwell on it. He silently nodded and softly said, "There are always conflicts of interest within the sect, such things are inevitable. But my master's life is at stake. I cannot stand idly by."

The Purple Mansion cultivator stood with his hands behind his back, his eyes appearing to smile. Holding two severed heads in his hands, he spoke, "Good! Such courage! Such audacity!"

Li Xizhi lowered his gaze, suppressing his emotions, as he heard the Purple Mansion cultivator coldly say, "Do you know my name?"

Li Xizhi understood that this was the final test and had already formed his judgment in his heart, High nose, narrow eyes, flowing hair and beard. Clad in golden scales and a voice like a howling wind. This must be a dragon! Its supernatural abilities shine with a deep blue hue, embodying the essence of water, yet it does not resemble the dragon forms from the Azure Pond... It must be a newly ascended great demonic beast, one who profited from Dongfang You's downfall…

He bowed slightly and replied, "Junior greets the great demonic beast, Muhai."

The Purple Mansion cultivator suddenly burst into laughter, revealing his sharp, glistening white teeth. They were long and thin, appearing especially crystalline in the water. He laughed and said, "You have trespassed here and must be punished. Now, flee for your life!"

"Many thanks, senior!" Li Xizhi clasped his hands in salute, then swiftly retreated, riding his Heavenly Glow southward. The dragon waited for a moment before stirring his lips and tongue, exhaling a breath of icy coldness between his teeth.

The chill spun rapidly in the air, transforming into a deep blue droplet of water that floated and trembled continuously.

He picked up the two severed heads and flicked his fingers lightly. The water droplet fell into the mouth of one corpse, causing its flesh and blood to boil instantly, stretching and reshaping like soft clay. Soon, it took the form of a young boy. Muhai chuckled twice, his gleaming white fangs flashing as he released his grip, "Heyun, you have only one hour."

As soon as his words fell, the young boy came to life. His eyes were lively, his demeanor graceful and natural. After tidying his clothes, he gave a slight bow and disappeared southward like a flash of lightning.

Muhai stood with his hands behind his back as the great void beside him tore open, forming a figure who asked, "Dongfang Changmu, what has happened?"

Muhai blinked his emerald-green eyes and spoke softly, "The Azure Pond seeks to kill with a borrowed knife, deliberately sending a Foundation Establishment cultivator here. But I sense he has some backing. Father said that Suiguan does not resemble a human in form, so we should be cautious."

The figure nodded reluctantly, slowly revealing its form. It was a narrow-eyed woman of imposing presence, her robes billowing as she softly said, "Father and Dragon Monarch Xiyang will arrive soon. Be prepared."

Muhai nodded and smiled, "With both Dragon Monarchs acting together, we should be able to take Thundercloud Temple and complete the Thunder Summoning and Lightning Control foretold in the Azure Prophecy Scroll."

The dragon woman shook her head slightly, her expression tinged with melancholy, and merely said, "But while the Daoist Master Shangyuan is breaking through and the humans are entangled in internal conflict, we should seize this secret realm… Besides, that so-called Azure One is a figure from countless millennia ago. What was useful then may not be now."

Muhai simply chuckled, stroking the red whiskers on his lips as he replied, "He is an immortal, he would not be wrong."

----

Li Xizhi sped away on his Heavenly Glow, streaking a deep trail of multicolored light across the sea's surface. Holding a talisman in his hand, cold sweat trickled down his back.

Punishment.

He had no time to consider the causes and consequences. A chill surged behind him and when he looked toward the water, he saw tiny fragments of ice floating upon the surface.

Sensing something amiss, Li Xizhi watched as the seawater before him rose, transforming into a young figure. With neatly tied hair, fine eyebrows, and bright eyes, the figure adjusted his sleeves with graceful ease and said with a smile, "I am Dongfang Heyun. Greetings, fellow Daoist."

Hearing the surname Dongfang, Li Xizhi immediately recognized it as a method of the Dragon Clan from the Purple Mansion. He returned the courtesy as the gentle young man softly said, "By order of my Exalted Immortal lord, I have come to execute you. Forgive the offense…"

Li Xizhi had already placed his hand on his sword. Upon hearing these words, his sharp blade leaped from its sheath, flashing with radiant white light as he immediately executed the Celestial Moon Slash.

In terms of innate swordsmanship talent, Li Xizhi was not inferior to Li Xijun and was even older than him. However, due to his extensive practice of various spell arts, his focus was divided, making his current sword arc less refined than that of his younger cousin.

Dongfang Heyun was still adjusting his sleeves when he casually reached out, pinched the sword light between his fingers and crushed it instantly. Then, raising his gaze, he stepped forward.

With just this one move, Li Xizhi understood many things and thought, He is undefeatable!

The talismans in his grasp leaped into the air, transforming into streams of golden light. Three Foundation Establishment talismans shone brilliantly as they descended, intertwining to form a barrier.

If nothing else, Qingsui Peak had the greatest number of talismans. His grandmaster, Si Yuanbai, had been one of the greatest talisman makers of the Azure Pond Sect, leaving behind a vast collection before his westward departure. Another batch had been left by Yuan Tuan before he left, many of which now rested in Li Xizhi's possession.

As he released the three talismans, his figure dissipated like a mist of colored clouds, leaving behind three radiant trails in the air. In an instant, he had moved over two meters away, his sleeve of Heavenly Glow unfurling in the air, scattering like smoke and wisps of cotton, forming a small circle midair.

Yet Dongfang Heyun floated effortlessly in the wind. With a flick and a press of his fingers, the golden formation of talismans shifted an inch to the side and he stepped out of it with ease.

He continued forward, leaving the golden formation shimmering behind him. By now, Li Xizhi had already fled several miles away, vanishing into the distance. Dongfang Heyun dissolved into a wisp of misty rain, pursuing in silent chase.

Li Xizhi, riding his Heavenly Glow, vaguely sensed the shifting of the three golden talismans. His heart trembled slightly as he quickly analyzed the situation.

This person has not yet used the technique that allowed him to appear before me. There must be some limitations.

If he were a Purple Mansion cultivator, I should have perished already. Yet he does not resemble Foundation Establishment nor Purple Mansion Realm… Rather, he seems… as if he has received the divine power of Muhai!

His pupils reflected the endless expanse of sea and sky as he recalled the moment Dongfang Heyun had appeared. He thought to himself, He is likely neither of the Dragon Clan nor human… but rather a demonic spirit akin to the elements of heaven and earth, wind and rain… How rare!

To recognize the peculiarity of Dongfang Heyun, he had to thank Yu Su of Yuanwu Peak and his Jinwu Xi studies.

Knowing that his family would inevitably clash with Yuanwu Peak, Li Xizhi had been vigilant. He had learned from his father the strategy of planning before acting and had thoroughly studied the dharma artifacts, techniques, mindsets, and preferences of Yuanwu Peak's cultivators.

Coincidentally, Yu Su possessed a golden cage called Long Wind Cage, a treasured heirloom of the Yu family. It contained five imprisoned wind demonic beasts, each at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm, which could merge into a Foundation Establishment Realm demonic wind. It was a truly extraordinary artifact.

This dharma artifact was an immortal treasure among Foundation Establishment items. Li Xizhi had studied it extensively, and now, seeing Dongfang Heyun, he felt a strong sense of familiarity.

The wind follows the tiger, the clouds follow the dragon

Considering his name, Li Xizhi deduced that Dongfang Heyun was, in all likelihood, a spirit cloud entity.

Just as a Master Monk gains strength by adhering to a Maha, he follows and serves the great demonic beast Muhai, thus receiving divine power… He is capable of shifting spiritual energy, manipulating talismans and dispersing or coalescing at will.

Having reached his conclusion, Li Xizhi made an immediate decision, remaining calm as he thought, I cannot entangle myself with mist and clouds in midair. I must descend into the water to plan my next move!

Behind him, Dongfang Heyun narrowed his eyes slightly, watching as Li Xizhi plunged into the water. He nodded subtly and thought, Ordinary people assume I am of the Dragon Clan and dare not engage me in water combat. But this cultivator, who refines heavenly radiance, is both quick-witted and decisive.

Frowning slightly as if concerned about his robes, he released a burst of mana to repel the seawater before descending.A trail of bubbles were left behind as he sank swiftly.

As expected, once Li Xizhi entered the water, Dongfang Heyun's speed slowed slightly, though not significantly. Li Xizhi dived deeper, and the light before him quickly dimmed.

Following behind, Dongfang Heyun retrieved a luminous blue pearl from his sleeve, placing it between his palms before exhaling softly.

Poof!

Ahead, Li Xizhi's feathered robe flared with radiant light, emitting small wisps of gray mist. His face paled instantly as he spat out blood. The spell he had been forming in his hands reached completion. With his two fingers pressed together, he whispered, "Activate."

His figure instantly split into multiple shadows, yet instead of dispersing, they overlapped and merged together.

"An illusion technique? How could that possibly deceive me?" Dongfang Heyun frowned slightly as another jade pearl appeared in his palm. He flicked it forward with a slight movement of his fingers.
𝐟𝚛𝕖𝚎𝕨𝗲𝐛𝚗𝐨𝐯𝐞𝕝.𝐜𝗼𝗺

But Li Xizhi suddenly turned back, forming a spell seal in his hands. His middle and ring fingers bent into his palm while the others pointed outward which shaped the image of a cauldron. Layers upon layers of phantom shadows coalesced into a faintly visible, massive cauldron.

The jade pearl fell into the cauldron, erupting with a thunderous explosion. All of Li Xizhi’s phantom shadows shattered at once, his breath momentarily stalling. In the next instant, he flipped his palm and hurled a counterattack straight at Dongfang Heyun’s face.

The Rainbow Phantom Split technique was meant to confuse enemies, but Li Xizhi knew that Dongfang Heyun was a master of transformation and would never be fooled. Instead, he propelled himself away on his Heavenly Glow.

Yet the nature of techniques is ever-changing. Although his phantom split could not deceive Dongfang Heyun, it served as a medium to dissipate the backlash of his cauldron-dissolving technique, mitigating part of the force and shielding him from Dongfang Heyun’s spell.

Dongfang Heyun smiled gently and politely, watching as Li Xizhi reversed the spell upon him. His figure blurred and dissipated into a vast mist, vanishing completely.

Li Xizhi had barely flown several miles when frost suddenly began forming at his side, inch by inch. He carefully observed his surroundings and immediately halted. Before him, the mist thickened and Dongfang Heyun’s face reappeared once more.

Not even an hour...

This thought flashed through Li Xizhi’s mind as a round shield shot out from his sleeve, flying rapidly toward Dongfang Heyun.

Li Xizhi had cultivated both swordsmanship and spell arts to impressive levels, but he lacked a proper dharma artifact. During his years of cultivation on the peak, apart from refining the Dawn Colored Qi, he had never requested any treasures from his family.

Qingsui Peak had always been poor and the artifact he pulled from his sleeve turned out to be nothing more than a mid-grade Qi Cultivation item. Seeing this, Dongfang Heyun raised an eyebrow and said with a chuckle, "I thought you were an immortal descendant of the Purple Mansion!"

Clearly, Dongfang Heyun had finally discerned Li Xizhi’s background from this detail. Though he spoke casually, his hands did not slow. He extended his palm and the seawater instantly hardened into a steel-like wall. The water surged wildly and scattered Li Xizhi’s spell into disarray.

Then, he transformed his palm into a blade that was as smooth as jade, cleaving through the void. Li Xizhi had just enough time to execute half of Gold In Cloud, shifting his body sideways by a few feet.

Clang!

Li Xizhi’s feathered robe let out an ear-piercing wail as crimson blood erupted through the deep sea. His left arm was severed at the root, bursting into a brilliant cascade of multicolored radiance.

The feathered robe given to him by Yang Xiao’er was no ordinary garment. Golden light shimmered across its intricate patterns and responded instantly. Dazzling rays erupted and shot toward Dongfang Heyun, engulfing him completely.

A flicker of surprise flashed in Dongfang Heyun’s eyes. He raised a hand to shield his vision from the blinding light, yet fine, intricate holes appeared on his palm from the impact.

By the time he regained focus, only shimmering water remained before him, dyed with hues of rising colored mist, blood evaporating into radiant clouds. Li Xizhi was already gone, along with his severed arm.

The streak of light Li Xizhi left in his wake bore traces of red. Clearly, he had activated a secret technique. Doubt flickered across Dongfang Heyun’s face as he murmured, "Just where does he come from...?"

Dongfang Heyun understood his master’s intent well. If Li Xizhi truly were an immortal descendant of the Purple Mansion Realm, he should have possessed enough dharma relics, talismans, or other trump cards to last at least an hour in combat.

Yet this man was strange. His intelligence and tactics were first-class, yet his spell arts were a notch inferior. His feathered robe held mysterious power, yet his dharma artifacts were nothing but trash. The contradiction left Dongfang Heyun momentarily perplexed.

He paused for just a moment before a smile spread across his face. Adjusting his sleeves, he immediately took flight, transforming into a streak of white light as he pursued.

Ahead, Li Xizhi’s face was pale as the blood seeping from his wound transformed into multicolored clouds, fueling his escape technique.

His mastery of spell arts was far beyond that of ordinary cultivators. This Blood Harnessing Technique did not truly consume his essence blood but instead harnessed the natural flow of blood from his fresh wound to power the spell.

Once his leaking essence qi stabilized, he retrieved his severed arm from his embrace and carefully reattached it to his wound.

If things reach a desperate point, I may have no choice but to turn this arm into a spell itself...

The seawater here had turned a deep red-green hue. Li Xizhi calculated the distance, Zongquan Island was close. For some reason, Dongfang Heyun had hesitated in the water for a few moments, granting him a chance to accelerate. He could now vaguely see the defensive formations on the island.

Something’s wrong... Something’s off...

His complexion paled further as his mind raced. His thoughts flickered rapidly through his consciousness, but his trajectory was deviating more and more. He was drifting further from Zongquan Island.

Despite being in imminent danger, Li Xizhi's mind remained sharp. He kept replaying the words of the Purple Mansion's demonic dragon in his mind, Punishment... punishment... The cultivators of the Purple Mansion never go back on their word. If I hide within another sect’s formation, wouldn’t that make their punishment meaningless?

He struggled to deduce Muhai’s thoughts, formulating his conclusion in a flash, Muhai must despise how the Azure Pond Sect tried to use him as a weapon! But I trespassed into the Dragon Clan’s territory, which seems like a provocation... He can’t let me go easily...

Dongfang Heyun is far stronger than me. If this turns into a chase, I will die for sure... If he isn’t trying to kill me outright, then either he is restricted by time or I must pay a sufficient price to satisfy his authority!

No matter what, I absolutely cannot flee into my sect’s formation!

Gritting his teeth, he adjusted his escape path further southward, thinking to himself, If I embarrass Muhai, Dongfang Heyun will surely go on a rampage. I must not bring disaster upon my aunt!




# Chapter 696: One Palm

In the pitch-black depths of the ocean, two streaks of light flashed by. The one in the lead was dazzling and vibrant, resembling a long, flowing ribbon cutting through the dark waters.

The one trailing behind appeared far more ordinary, like a massive air bubble pushing aside the seawater as it advanced. Yet, it was much faster than the first as it was steadily closing the gap.

Li Xizhi sped forward, his light-trail shifted off course and left behind a stunning, multicolored ribbon. His escape technique, Dawn Imperial Movement, was a Grade Four spell of exceptional speed.

His cultivation of Universal Dawn Mist was already specialized in speed. But only with multiple reinforcements did he barely manage to maintain some distance from Dongfang Heyun, preventing immediate capture.

But as Li Xizhi’s course deviated, he unwittingly gave Dongfang Heyun the perfect opening to close the gap. The young pursuer lifted his gaze and spotted the colorful glow ahead.

Though he did not understand why Li Xizhi had changed course, Dongfang Heyun would not let the opportunity slip. He pinched a deep blue pearl between his fingers and flicked it toward Li Xizhi’s back.

Up ahead, Li Xizhi pulled out a talisman and braced himself. His severed arm had already reattached. Although it was slightly stiff, it was still functional. The sight made Dongfang Heyun raise his brows in surprise, He neutralized my mana so quickly?!

Dongfang Heyun’s palm-blade attack had not been a simple cut, it was imbued with mana designed to seep into the wound. It would disrupt Li Xizhi’s own mana circulation and prevent his injury from healing.

Had it not been for the golden radiance hidden within Li Xizhi’s feathered robe, his arm would have been utterly obliterated, leaving him no chance to reattach it. Yet now, somehow, it was functioning once more.

Did he take some kind of treasured panacea? thought Dongfang Heyun.

Li Xizhi focused solely on his talisman defense, paying no heed to the golden light of his robe. The reason his arm had reattached so swiftly was, of course, due to his talisman qi.

Having received the Rainbow Pierce Skyway talisman, he could dissolve external spell arts. As its colorful light circulated, the pale blue mana lingering in his wound rapidly dissipated. This allowed his flesh to knit back together, emitting brilliant hues of dawn.

As he gradually regained control of his arm, Dongfang Heyun’s spell advanced silently. It struck the talismans and erupted into a series of thunderous blasts which sent shockwaves rippling through the water. Li Xizhi let out a muffled groan as his breath faltered. The Heavenly Glow beneath his feet dimmed, it was slowing his escape.

Dongfang Heyun had already closed the distance in an instant, only to see Li Xizhi forming a seal once again.

The young pursuer watched with interest, as if expecting Li Xizhi to unveil a new technique. Yet, the seals he formed seemed oddly familiar, ones he had already used before.

In such a critical moment, Li Xizhi positioned his right hand above his left and extended a finger from each. He pressed them together and cast a duplication technique.

Is he courting death? thought Dongfang Heyun.

Dongfang Heyun remained calm and composed, showing neither hesitation nor doubt. No matter what Li Xizhi was attempting, he simply extended his palm toward the latter’s back.

Poof!

Li Xizhi coughed up blood as he had taken the full force of the palm strike head-on. A golden-blue imprint bloomed on the back of his feathered robe and an explosive surge of golden radiance burst forth, engulfing Dongfang Heyun’s vision.

This time, Dongfang Heyun was prepared. He pushed out forcefully, instantly shattering the golden light. But in that brief moment of pause, a thick mist of rainbow hues erupted from Li Xizhi’s body, swiftly spreading and dyeing the surrounding seawater in vibrant colors.

At the same time, seizing this fleeting moment, Li Xizhi's feet flared with radiance. His form dispersed like mist and left behind three dazzling trails of multicolored light.

Gold In Cloud!

In an instant, his well-honed duplicates leaped in separate directions. Everywhere, brilliant streaks of light wove through the mist, using the rainbow fog as cover while scattering in all directions.

Over two meters away, Li Xizhi’s silhouettes appeared in every direction, all executing identical movements. They all swept out a sleeve of Heavenly Glow that drifted like smoke and floating wisps. Then, each of them streaked away upon radiant trails.

Dongfang Heyun nodded slightly, a hint of appreciation flickering across his face as he thought, First, he took a direct palm strike to release a spell, using the golden light from his robe to blind my vision. Then, he masked his movements with rainbow mist, preventing me from discerning the real body and finally scattered in all directions...

In just a few seconds, despite Li Xizhi’s grave injuries, he had unleashed three different techniques in succession. He transformed into a dozen beams of radiant light shooting outward. Dongfang Heyun stood still, sweeping aside the rainbow mist with his sleeve, shaking his head slightly.

"What a pity," muttered Dongfang Heyun.

Li Xizhi had calculated everything to perfection, yet he failed to realize that Dongfang Heyun’s mana had already latched onto his feathered robe like a parasitic worm. Even if he couldn’t visually distinguish the real body, his mana could still trace the correct escape route.

Since he already took my palm strike, the connection remains. No matter how he scatters like falling petals, it’ll be futile in the end.

Closing his eyes slightly, Dongfang Heyun sensed the distant fluctuations of mana. Stepping upon the seawater, he flew for several more miles before his form dispersed once again like mist. The surrounding ocean waters froze over in delicate layers, producing faint, crackling sounds.

The sea roared as Dongfang Heyun figure dissolved into vapor and reformed, emerging ahead of the fleeing light which blocked it completely.

Dongfang Heyun casually flicked his sleeve, appearing before Li Xizhi once more. Perhaps due to his severe injuries, Li Xizhi's perception had dulled. He remained focused on flying forward, unaware of the imminent obstruction.

"Eh?"

Dongfang Heyun’s usually gentle and refined expression shifted, a faint smile appearing on his face. With a casual flick of his sleeve, the Li Xizhi before him shattered into scattered beams of colorful light.

The fragmented light dispersed like a swarm of tiny fireflies, vanishing into the air. Left behind in the water was only a tattered feathered robe, gently drifting with the current. On its back, the deep blue palm imprint still shimmered brilliantly, radiating an ethereal glow.

Seeing this, Dongfang Heyun's smile widened as he thought, Good... very good... So he deliberately took my palm strike, then placed the feathered robe on a clone. The rainbow mist was merely a distraction... As expected, humans are cunning.

His smile soon faded as he extended his pale, jade-like fingers, lifting the feathered robe. Turning it over twice, he finally noticed a tiny ancient seal in the corner.

Yang.

The writing style was not contemporary but rather archaic. Having lived for many years, Dongfang Heyun recognized the mark and nodded in realization.

"So, he is a descendant of Yang Jinxin! That explains everything." He showed no urgency in pursuing Li Xizhi, instead gazing at the feathered robe with a calm expression, murmuring, "To think that the once-proud Yang family has fallen to such a state... They don't even have a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator left!"

"But they do have connections in the Underworld... Even Suiguan wouldn’t dare act recklessly against them." After contemplating for a few seconds, he tucked the feathered robe into his sleeve. Then, pressing his two fingers together, he exhaled softly, causing a deep blue radiance to glow upon his fingertips. He whispered, "Heyun humbly borrows the esteemed force, passing through the Mansion’s decree, to traverse the great void..."

The seawater in front of Dongfang Heyun rippled violently, collapsing inward as though a great whale had opened its massive maw. A pitch-black rift appeared in the depths. Dongfang Heyun’s body transformed into mist, swirling upward before merging into the glowing light at his fingertips, then vanishing into the great void.

Far Away. The golden sun slowly rose over the ocean, casting a magnificent scene of gold and deep blue across the world. Yet Li Xizhi had no time to admire it, he was coughing violently.

Every ounce of his mana was being channeled into the Heavenly Glow beneath his feet. His qi reservoirs were being drained dry, all in service of maintaining his escape technique.

He had no idea how far he had flown. With trembling hands, he fished out several pills from his storage pouch and swallowed them hastily. He also stuck a few flight-enhancing talismans onto himself. Although their effects were meager, anything was better than nothing. Only then did he finally take a moment to survey his surroundings.

Dongfang Heyun fell for it, thought Li Xizhi.

With a single glance, Li Xizhi knew that Dongfang Heyun was an exceedingly confident individual. That very confidence had led him into the trap. Li Xizhi had sent out over a dozen clones and since Dongfang Heyun had failed to distinguish them immediately, he had lost his chance to do so altogether.

Even if Dongfang Heyun could use that void-traversing technique, there were certainly limitations. It took time to do so and he couldn’t just appear before Li Xizhi without cause or a guiding force. By all accounts, Li Xizhi had already escaped danger.

Yet, Li Xizhi dared not relax, nor did he let a single trace of triumph show on his face. He remembered well, this was never a true assassination. It was merely a punishment by a great demonic beast of the Purple Mansion Realm. Dongfang Heyun had never shown true killing intent.

But if he allowed even the slightest smirk, if he dared to laugh, things could take an entirely different turn.

So even though he seemed to have escaped on the surface, his expression remained cautious as he pushed himself to flee at full speed.

If the Purple Mansion master does not act... Dongfang Heyun’s most likely move would be to summon the sea tribes to inspect each clone one by one. If that happens, I won't last long. The question is, what will bring this to an end?

He flew in silence, the multicolored light beneath his feet reflected against the deep blue waters and created a breathtaking sight. He coughed twice, then, his pupils suddenly dilated.

Before him, a pitch-black void emerged in midair. A young man calmly adjusted his robes and stepped forward from within, gazing at him with refined elegance as he spoke softly, "Fellow Daoist, your calculations are truly impressive!"

He traversed the great void! There's... there's no escaping this! thought Li Xizhi.

Panic surged in his heart. He flung out the five or six talismans hidden in his sleeve. The talismans expanded in midair into colossal barriers of light and floated with glowing runes that exuded an imposing aura. But it was already too late.

Dongfang Heyun’s jade-like palm sliced through the air. Only the first talisman managed to briefly slow him down; the rest were left trailing uselessly behind. He gently pressed his palm against Li Xizhi’s abdomen, sending him reeling as he spat out blood, which billowed into a mist of multicolored light.

Dongfang Heyun’s palm pierced straight through Li Xizhi’s abdomen. As he withdrew his hand, the blood staining his flawless, jade-like skin rapidly transformed into radiant clouds.

Gold In Cloud!

It was only thanks to Li Xizhi’s mastery of escape techniques that, even in his dazed state, he could still step out the golden light. His form dispersed like mist, leaving behind three dazzling trails of multicolored radiance, reappearing more than two meters away.

The morning sun brightened along the horizon and Li Xizhi struggled to remain conscious. A shimmering glow appeared in his palm, which he pressed against the gaping wound in his chest.

From his other sleeve, he flung several more talismans. White runic light flickered in midair, but before they could fully manifest, a sharp cracking sound echoed. Ice crystals spread across the sea’s surface. Dongfang Heyun had already bypassed the barriers and stood right before him.

Once again, he unleashed that suffocating technique. The surrounding spiritual energy thickened, shattering the spell Li Xizhi had just formed. Dongfang Heyun calmly raised his hand and grasped Li Xizhi’s throat.

"Hmm?" The refined, gentle youth suddenly paused. A smile played at his lips as he blinked, his dark eyelashes catching the glow of dawn. He glanced at the sky and remarked, "Time is up."

Dongfang Heyun slowly released his grip, letting the immobilized Li Xizhi remain suspended in midair. Raising his jade-like hand, he straightened Li Xizhi’s disheveled robes.

He studied Li Xizhi carefully, then seemed to realize something. Reaching into his sleeve, he retrieved the tattered feathered robe, which had been neatly folded and gently draped it over Li Xizhi’s arm. Only then did he nod in satisfaction.

Dongfang Heyun politely stepped back, bowed slightly, and spoke in a warm tone, "I was merely carrying out an immortal’s decree to eliminate you. My offense is great. I ask for your forgiveness, fellow Daoist."

From the start of this chase until now, his robes had never once creased. He offered another courteous bow, his voice as gentle as before, he said, "I am Dongfang Heyun, born from the first breath exhaled by a Dragon Monarch during his pill formation. I follow the clouds and ride the mist, and it seems we share a certain fate. May I ask for your esteemed name, fellow Daoist?"

Li Xizhi wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and rasped, "Li Xizhi of Qingsui Peak."

"Good." With that single word, Dongfang Heyun dissipated like mist and vanished into the morning light. Li Xizhi's legs nearly gave out beneath him and he almost plummeted into the sea.

He was still clutching the feathered robe that Yang Xiao'er had given him. There were secrets hidden within it, but he had no time to investigate. Panting heavily, he quickly retrieved several medicinal pills and swallowed them.

Only after taking a few deep breaths did he manage to steady himself in midair. Spotting a small island, he descended. As soon as he landed, he coughed up a mist of multicolored blood and muttered, "My guess wasn’t too far off."

When Dongfang Heyun tore through the great void, Li Xizhi had indeed been startled. But the moment the palm strike landed, hitting him squarely in the abdomen, most of his fear had already dissipated.

Dongfang Heyun did not intend to kill him. The disparity in power between his earlier restraint and later attacks was significant. Considering his ability to traverse the great void, it was now quite clear.

Had he intended to kill, he could have done so immediately upon emerging from the great void. Why wait until now? It was simply because Dongfang Heyun had been tasked with inflicting enough damage within a limited time. Li Xizhi had calculated correctly. By forcing the time constraint, he had made Dongfang Heyun exert full effort at the last moment.

That being said, within the parameters of the battle, Dongfang Heyun had shown no mercy. This was, in itself, a form of selection. If Li Xizhi had not been up to standard, then he would have simply died. His survival or demise would have made no difference to the Azure Pond Sect or the Dragon Clan.

This chance at survival... I had to fight for every bit of it.

Even so, taking that palm strike directly without any dharma artifact to protect him was no minor matter. Li Xizhi slowly sat down, feeling the internal injuries that the strike had left behind and pondered over his condition.

Dongfang Heyun’s technique primarily inflicted mana-based damage, with deep blue energy continuously corroding his body. However, Li Xizhi was uniquely suited to counter it. His Rainbow Pierce Skyway allowed him to dissolve external mana.

But the fact remained that the palm strike had torn through his abdomen and coupled with his earlier severed arm, the injuries were severe and could not be ignored.

Now, sitting quietly, he finally had the chance to piece together the sequence of events and organize his thoughts.

"He wants to harm me..."




# Chapter 698: Cloud Smoke

Scarlet Pristine Sea, Zongquan Island.

The clouds over Zongquan Island drifted, the air was damp, and a towering bronze ritual altar stood tall, its intricate carvings depicted various patterns of rain, mist, and thunder. The hues of greenstone and bronze complemented each other.

Li Qinghong had cultivated here for over a decade. Since travel was inconvenient, she had Zong Yan construct another ritual altar on the island, at least granting some benefits to the island’s inhabitants.

She slowly rose as thunder flowed over her jade armor. Around her, a circle of bronze and silver statues flickered with lightning. The lightning surged toward her and cascaded down from the jade sleeves at her wrists.

Li Qinghong had been in seclusion here, cultivating for over a decade. Her strength had steadily grown, and her aura had become increasingly refined.

Falling Water Rising Storm was naturally abundant in thunder, and with the ritual altar’s support, Li Qinghong frequently sought out lightning to resonate with the thunder pool within her. These ten years of cultivation had been twice as effective, equaling over thirty years of inland practice, leaving her just one step away from the late Foundation Establishment Realm.

With her mana withdrawn, she stepped out on thunder. Below the altar stood a young man, appearing in his twenties. He was also a cultivator of thunder techniques. Holding a spear, he stood silently. Seeing Li Qinghong descend on lightning, he bowed and said, “Greetings, grandaunt.”

“Chenghui.” Li Qinghong nodded slightly. This junior, too, was a child of the second lineage, practicing thunder techniques. He had remained by her side, guarding the overseas island while using the altar to aid his cultivation.

Li Chenghui was reserved and spoke little. He cupped his hands in salute and said, “Congratulations, grandaunt, on your great advancement in cultivation.”

That was all he said. Li Qinghong nodded slightly, gave him a few pointers on cultivation, and then soared into the wind, flying off the island.

By my calculations, that spiritual thunder should be descending soon, thought Li Qinghong.

Using this altar, Li Qinghong had collected spirit thunder many times before. Although she couldn’t identify the specific locations or names of the seas, she could still venture out occasionally, sometimes returning with gains.

Li Qinghong soared with the wind, stepping on lightning as she flew northward. At her waist, a lightning-patterned black bottle gleamed brilliantly, it was exceptionally dazzling.

The black-patterned bottle contained eleven bolts of lightning yet remained stable and sturdy. Its exterior, resembling lightning cracks, shone even brighter. Inside, the translucent lightning pulsed with a soft purple glow. It was truly astonishing.

Over the years, she had gained a deeper understanding of the altar. The twelve surrounding statues each represented a region, suggesting that ancient thunder domains had been pre-designated. Whichever direction the lightning fell from determined its ownership.

The dragon-shaped statue in the southeast was the most active, providing the most information. Over the years, most of the thunder she obtained came from the southeast.

She flew through the sky for a while and was about to turn southeast when she suddenly looked back. Above Zongquan Island, a brilliant light rose and the jade talisman on her wrist emitted a warm glow.

Whenever Li Qinghong left Zongquan Island, she left behind a jade talisman as a precaution in case anything happened in her absence. However, her mana did not last long and she had never specialized in this art, so the talisman was only effective for a month or two.

What’s this...? Luckily, I haven’t gone far.

Li Qinghong turned back on lightning, swiftly returning to the island. She saw that Li Chenghui was already waiting at the formation’s entrance. Passing Zong Yan and the others, he stepped forward, bowed, and used secret techniques to transmit a message, Grandaunt, Third Uncle has entered the formation and he is gravely injured.

Xizhi!

Li Qinghong’s heart skipped a beat. Without a word, she soared into the wind and rushed into the great formation. Zong Yan and the others barely had time to react before she vanished like a bolt of lightning.

Inside the cave dwelling, Li Qinghong saw Li Xizhi sitting cross-legged, his face ashen, multicolored light flowing around him as he worked to heal his injuries. She hurriedly activated the formation, shattered a few spirit stones and stepped out of the formation.

Li Chenghui waited outside and whispered, “Grandaunt... Third uncle concealed his presence, used a jade pendant to summon me outside and then sneaked into the formation. No one else on the island knows.”

Hearing this, Li Qinghong pondered the implications, her expression darkening as she spoke in a low voice, “Something must have happened. Keep this a secret. Do not let anyone know that Zhi’er is here.”

Li Chenghui nodded and quietly withdrew. Once he disappeared, Li Qinghong shook her head slightly, lost in silent thought.

———

Mount Azure Pond.

The bells of Mount Azure Pond rang three times as the Dawn Cloudliner streaked across the sky in dazzling colors. Their massive, multicolored wings fluttered as they returned from all directions.

With the fall of the Purple Mansion Realm master, cultivators stationed across various regions were summoned back. Some who had long been absent from the sect also made an appearance, returning from the Eastern Sea, the southern border and even the Northern Sea.

“Yuanwu has fallen...”

Li Xuanfeng halted midair, circling twice through the white mist before landing atop the peak. The Ning Family members stood in orderly formation. As he looked around, he saw that the surrounding mountains remained lush and green, unlike the rumored golden landscape.

When news first spread, it was said that enough gold had fallen within the peak to bury several people. Now that Yuanwu had perished, the vast amounts of gold scattered across the mountains had already been gathered and stored within the sect.

Upon hearing this, Ning Heyuan laughed heartily and even joked that for the next hundred years, Yuanwu Peak would no longer need to request gold from the sect. It could rely solely on Yuanwu’s remains.

Listening to the Ning Family’s laughter, Li Xuanfeng remained deep in thought, The time to act on the lake has come... but I don’t know how things are on Xizhi’s side.

He waited for a moment before the Ning Family members dispersed into the peak. This was Dongquan Peak, one of the thirty-six great peaks. However, since Yuan Su never managed it and the talented members of the Ning Family had all gone to the southern border, its reputation remained obscure.

When Li Xuanfeng entered the grand hall, he saw Yuan Su seated at the head, alone. Clearly, no one dared to loiter in his presence. Clad in golden armor, Li Xuanfeng knelt before him and said, “Greetings, Master.”

Yuan Su’s expression was unreadable. He glanced down at Li Xuanfeng and spoke in a low voice, “Yuanwu has been utterly eradicated. Come with me to meet the Chi Family.”

Li Xuanfeng felt a flicker of suspicion but said nothing. He nodded, rose to his feet and followed Yuan Su out of the hall. At the entrance stood a tall middle-aged man named Ning Hejing.

Ning Hejing was the elder cousin of Ning Heyuan and Ning Hemian, one of the few Ning Family cultivators still residing in the sect. He was the peak master of Yuanxing Peak and had close ties with Chi Zhiyun.

Chi Buzi was Chi Zhiyun’s great-grandfather and Chi Zhiyun’s lineage was maternally tied to Ning Hejing’s branch. The two had grown up together and their interests were closely intertwined which made them as good as blood brothers.

Ning Hejing cupped his hands and said to Yuan Su, “Master, please proceed to the main hall.”

Yuan Su gave a slight nod and ascended into the wind. Ning Hejing merely nodded at Ning Heyuan and the others without so much as a smile. He maintained a careful distance as he led Yuan Su and a few Ning Family elites into the air.

Ning Heyuan’s expression darkened briefly before returning to normal. Behind him, several younger members of the Ning Family also looked displeased, clearly dissatisfied with Ning Hejing’s actions.

Ning Hejing ignored their reactions, showing only a hint of cordiality toward Li Xuanfeng. Li Xuanfeng nodded in return and together they descended into the Azure Pond Main Hall.

Mist billowed within the hall, clear energy drifting in wisps. In the center stood a large golden bell, it was undoubtedly the one that had just rung. Beside this golden dharma artifact stood a middle-aged man, who appeared to be from the Chi Family.

At the highest seat stood a man clad in a brilliant robe with a sword at his waist. It was most likely Chi Zhiyun, the sect master of Azure Pond. Given the striking resemblance between him and the man below, that person was likely his younger brother, Chi Zhiyan.

It was Li Xuanfeng’s first time seeing Chi Zhiyun, yet he found him familiar. Narrowing his eyes slightly, a thought stirred in his mind.

When all was said and done, the fame of their sword immortal was owed to this man. Back when Chi Zhiyun was still the sect’s young master, he had been overseeing Li Chejing’s journey to the southern border. By now, seventy to eighty years had passed.

Chi Zhiyun was now at the late Foundation Establishment Realm. No one knew how many secret techniques he had mastered, but his spiritual qi radiated warmth and grandeur. He had likely consumed many treasured panaceas. Standing at the top, he exuded a commanding presence.

“Greetings, Sect Master!” The gathered cultivators saluted, but Chi Zhiyun was focused on first bowing to Yuan Su, respectfully saying, “Greetings, Daoist Master Yuan Su.”

Yuan Su waved his hand dismissively, merely lowering his head slightly toward the central memorial plaque. He was acknowledging Yuanwu’s passing. The Ning Family members then stepped forward to pay their respects one by one. Chi Zhiyun watched coldly. When the formalities were complete, he glanced meaningfully at Ning Hejing.

Ning Hejing turned to Ning Heyuan and said in a low voice, “You all may leave.”

Ning Heyuan’s eyelid twitched at the command. He turned to gauge Yuan Su’s expression, but seeing the Daoist Master remain indifferent, he had no choice but to silently lead his people out.

Though brief, the exchange told Li Xuanfeng everything he needed to know. Once everyone had left, Yuan Su finally spoke, “Where is Senior Suiguan?”

At the mention of this name, Chi Zhiyun’s hand tensed slightly on the hilt of his sword. A faint smile appeared on his face as he responded in a soft voice, “The honored master is elusive as a dragon, roaming the great void, traveling between the mainland and the seas. We juniors, naturally, do not know his whereabouts.”

Even as he spoke, the jade talisman at his waist swayed slightly. Li Xuanfeng’s pupils contracted ever so slightly as he lowered his gaze in silence.

That jade talisman, there was no mistaking it. It was the very same one he had used overseas to reap countless lives, tying dozens of storage pouches to it. And now, it hung from Chi Zhiyun’s waist.

Is this a warning… or a hint? thought Li Xuanfeng.

He scrutinized Chi Zhiyun, only to find that the young sect master of Azure Pond was silently observing him as well.

The nephew of Li Chejing, thought Chi Zhiyun. Of course, he remembered that boy from back then. Eighty years had passed in a blink, yet he had never forgotten that one sword strike. Every time he practiced with his blade, the image of a crisp breeze and bright moon would surface in his mind, making him pause and reflect in silence.

As his cultivation grew and his sword techniques and spell arts became more refined, he was no longer the Chi Zhiyun who once rushed through his training. Yet, that sword strike had been so dazzling that it left him feeling unworthy, so much so that he rarely used his sword anymore.

With an uncle like that, it’s no surprise his nephew turned out like this!

The Li Xuanfeng before him was even sharper than that boy from long ago. He was weathered, ruthless and was clad in armor reeking of blood. He was like a blade, so perfect that one would want to treasure and collect him.

Having consumed many treasured panaceas, Chi Zhiyun still looked youthful, while Li Xuanfeng bore the visage of an old warrior. As Chi Zhiyun was momentarily lost in thought, Yuan Su finally spoke, “Suiguan intends to bring you to the ceremony?”

Chi Zhiyun quickly snapped back to attention, cupped his hands, and respectfully replied, “Yes, Master!”

Yuan Su nodded slightly, casually pointing at Li Xuanfeng as he said, “My family is full of useless people. I’ll only send this junior. If you get the chance, you should exchange pointers with him.”

Ning Hejing was inexplicably insulted but dared not protest. After all, he was only at the early Foundation Establishment Realm, his innate ability inferior even to his younger brothers. Knowing Li Xuanfeng’s reputation, he endured it in silence.

Chi Zhiyun was momentarily taken aback, but he quickly recovered, a kind smile appearing on his face as he nodded and said, “As you command, Master.”

Yuan Su nodded again before departing with Li Xuanfeng, leaving the three men standing in the hall. Ning Hejing remained in the corner, silent as ever. At last, Chi Zhiyan, who had not spoken all this time, finally broke his silence. His expression was dark and sinister as he muttered, “So this is Li Xuanfeng!”

Chi Zhiyan’s features closely resembled Chi Zhiyun’s, but his expression carried a more sinister and cunning edge as he spoke coldly, “That Li Chejing must have used some underhanded trick to defeat you back then… Our family has always held a grudge against the Li Family… Many have long harbored resentment toward him! Once Yuan Su dies—”

“Zhiyan!!” Chi Zhiyun immediately cut him off with a sharp reprimand, “How dare you!”

Chi Zhiyan fell silent, while Chi Zhiyun’s expression darkened as he strode forward, his voice icy, “How many times have I told you? Li Chejing defeated me fair and square with his sword intent! There’s nothing disgraceful about it! You lot keep distorting the truth and twisting it in circles. That’s the behavior of sore losers!”

Seeing Chi Zhiyan scoff, he snapped harshly, he said, “I admitted defeat under broad daylight and never sought to harm the Li Family afterward. That’s how I salvaged my honor! Yet your family keeps scheming recklessly, meddling with the Yuan Family. That’s what’s truly putting me on the pyre!”

Chi Zhiyan, now thoroughly chastised, shut his mouth in embarrassment.

Chi Zhiyun had never been truly bothered by his defeat at Li Chejing’s hands. Even now, how many in Jiangnan could wield sword intent? A loss was a loss. He had never stooped to petty tricks to cover it up.

And yet, as his position as sect master became increasingly precarious, Chi Zhiyun found himself struggling to find capable subordinates. Instead, he began to regret, saying, “If our ancestor hadn’t plotted against Li Chejing back then… how many competent aides would I have now?! Not only was Li Chejing unparalleled in sharpness, but his intellect was also top-tier! If I had him at my side, I wouldn’t have to suffer the stupidity of this lot!

“And beyond that! There’s still Li Tongya, Li Xuanfeng, even Li Xizhi. Each one of them capable of holding their own and guarding a territory! How did I end up stuck with only these imbeciles…”

Chi Zhiyun sighed in exasperation but suddenly realized that his brother had gone completely silent. Turning back, he saw Chi Zhiyan looking dazed, and his heart clenched in alarm as he questioned, “What have you done this time?!”

Chi Zhiyan had been lost in thought ever since the mention of ‘harming the Li Family.’ Now that his brother had called him out, he was visibly uneasy and mumbled, “Nothing much…”

Chi Zhiyun scrutinized him carefully, his tone turning frigid as he asked, “Hejing… The spirit bell tolled six times. Did Li Xizhi return to the sect as ordered?”

Ning Hejing pondered for a moment before shaking his head and answered, “No, he has not.”

Chi Zhiyun’s heart sank, and in a sudden burst of fury, he shouted, “You fool! Li Xizhi was still useful to me! If you’ve harmed him, how many capable people do we have left in the sect?! You’re ruining me!”




# Chapter 700: Take Action

Chi Zhiyun’s voice was stern and sharp, forcing Chi Zhiyan to lower his head in silence. He paced back and forth on the jade platform for two rounds, feeling irritated. Beside him, Ning Hejing’s expression was grim as he spoke, "Since we have already offended him, Li Xizhi must have harbored resentment in his heart for a long time. Even if he dies, Li Xuanfeng will surely investigate. If he uncovers anything, he will turn his hatred toward us again.

"Why not go all the way and wipe out the entire Li Family? Tear down Moongaze Lake, and as for Li Xuanfeng…"

Chi Zhiyun pressed his hand against the jade throne and pondered for a moment. His thick eyebrows arched slightly, his pristine white robe draped over the silver celestial seat. He still felt a trace of irritation in his heart as he murmured, "If we really kill Li Xuanfeng, then all the trouble we went through before would have been for nothing! Destroying Moongaze Lake is fine, but once we fall out with the Yue Cultivating Sect, who will act as our vanguard? Who will hold off the Buddhist cultivators coming from the south?

"Out of the thirty-six peaks, nineteen are stationed to guard the Four Seas, six are scattered across market towns and the remaining eleven must also consider Daoist Master Yuan Xiu. Only six peaks are truly available for deployment. When the time comes, who will be sent to fight against the devil cultivators and Buddhist cultivators?"

His speech grew increasingly fast, carrying a ruthless edge. He cast a cold glance at Ning Hejing and asked, "Will you go?"

Ning Hejing naturally lowered his head and shook it. Though he held considerable power within the sect, his innate ability was weak. Achieving Foundation Establishment Realm had already been a struggle for him. How could he possibly take on such a task? He could only shake his head.

Chi Zhiyun then turned his head toward Chi Zhiyan and asked, "How about sending you?"

Chi Zhiyan remained silent as well. He had aspirations of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm and was already preoccupied with his cultivation. How could he afford to go and risk his life in battle? Chi Zhiyun sneered coldly, saying, "Or should we send a few elders from the family? Who among us can command them? Or perhaps send our brothers? If they get injured, it won't just end there. Our uncles will demand a hefty price.

"Should we send the Yu Family instead? After Yu Yuxie was devoured by the ancestor, their entire family scattered, and they have no one left to use. Or should we send the Yuan Family? Yuan Tuan and Yuan Chengdun have already been harmed by you lot!

"Only the Jiachuan Lin Valley Family still has some talents left, and even if we select one or two more from Linhai Prefecture… it’s far from enough!"

Chi Zhiyan was utterly humiliated by the relentless questioning. He had nothing left to say and could only reply, "I was reckless… But… but forgive me for speaking frankly, is the current situation really our responsibility? Isn't it all because of the ancestor…"

Chi Zhiyun shot him a sharp glare and responded, "What a pity that Yu Muxian is dead… Leaving behind only Tang Shedu and Yu Su…"

When it came down to it, the Azure Pond Sect had very few truly reliable people. Daoist Master Yuan Xiu was a solitary cultivator. He was cold and stubborn, following only his own path. Chi Zhiyun would never dare to mobilize him.

The elemental forces had once again taken control of the southern border. Though it would likely return to the hands of the Ning Family in a few years, Chi Zhiyun only found it troublesome. He lowered his voice and asked, "You deliberately sent him to find Yuan Tuan… he most likely won’t survive…

"Regardless of whether Li Xizhi lives or dies, an explanation must be given. None of the major families are blind, especially the Yang Family. We killed their son-in-law…"

A headache overtook him. He could only wave his hand and say softly, "Find a scapegoat…"

The two quickly nodded and withdrew. Only then did Chi Zhiyun slowly take his seat, covering his forehead with his hand. He closed his eyes as if recalling something else.

The Dragon Clan has always despised us, and those Dragon Monarch descendants are lurking around Thundercloud Temple. How can we act recklessly? Brother Yan is too naïve… If we offend a Dragon Monarch, it will only bring disaster upon us!

At this thought, Chi Zhiyun could no longer sit still. He hastily picked up a jade slip from the table and assigned several people from the sect to track down leads.

Zongquan Island.

After several days of secluded cultivation, Li Xizhi sank his spiritual sense into his qihai acupoints. He saw a vast ocean of iridescent clouds and mist, with various colors drifting about. Compared to the usual dense cloud smoke, it appeared thin, a sign that his injuries had yet to heal.

Amidst the deep sea of clouds, not only did multicolored light drift but a dark blue cloud smoke also weaved through. It pushed aside the surrounding mist and condensed into a single mass.

Li Xizhi observed for a long time before realizing something was amiss.

He had assumed that when Dongfang Heyun’s mana invaded his body, it would cause great destruction. Yet, to his surprise, it merely left him cold throughout. Using his talisman qi, he was able to dissolve and expel most of it quickly, leaving only this lingering mass in his qihai acupoints.

The residual mana had gathered on its own, forming a compact mass in his qihai acupoints, floating obediently amidst the mist. It seemed ethereal and could be easily dissipated by his own mana, let alone with his talisman qi.

What does this mean…

Li Xizhi had read many Daoist texts. This kind of intrusive mana usually dispersed throughout the body. The mana would invade the organs and cause destruction, never gathering into a single entity like this.

He studied it closely and sensed the subtle changes in the mana. It didn’t seem like an offensive technique but rather an art of perception. He quickly came to a realization.

Dongfang Heyun wants to spy on the situation in Azure Pond Sect…

Muhai had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm and was a direct descendant of the Dragon Monarch. He was rumored to be the seventh son of the current Dragon Palace ruler. He was not someone to be trifled with. How could he tolerate Azure Pond Sect humiliating him without retaliation?

On the surface, he had sent Dongfang Heyun to hunt down Li Xizhi to fulfill an old agreement, but in truth, he was using this opportunity to plant a spy in Azure Pond Sect and monitor its movements through Li Xizhi.

And this completely unguarded approach clearly conveyed to Li Xizhi, he thought, The life granted to you by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was not granted to you for free…

Moreover, making this technique so obvious as a spying method would instill fear in Li Xizhi, preventing him from carelessly seeking the Muhai’s aid. The entire ploy was clear now.

Having already suffered betrayal by the Chi Family, Li Xizhi fell silent and hesitated.

"The Chi Family wants to use Muhai as a blade, but Muhai is one of the top cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm. He will surely retaliate… And yet, I am the one who suffers, caught between them, unable to offend either side…"

Now that Li Xizhi understood the situation, he sighed deeply, not daring to erase the mana cluster recklessly.

Li Qinghong had only waited two days on the island. She practiced thunder techniques, summoned wind and rain and cast spells to conceal the iridescent anomalies caused by Li Xizhi’s healing process. After three days of waiting, the sealed stone door finally opened.

Since achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm and receiving the blessing of the Immortal Foundation Realm, Li Xizhi had developed an innate noble aura. His features had become smoother and more composed compared to his youth. However, his current pallor lent him the appearance of a frail nobleman.

Dorlaken's Thoughts

Some readers might wonder why some Daoist Masters like Yuan Su and Yuan Xiu have spaces in between while some Daoist Masters like Yuanwu have no space in between. The reason: Yuanwu is the only one that had no space because it is his real name, the other two were Yuan Su and Yuan Xiu, which are their titles.Yuan Su is from the Ning family, while Yuan Xiu is from the Si family.And Yuanwu is from the Tang Family with the name being Tang Yuanwu.

Li Qinghong descended in a flash of lightning and entered the cave dwelling. Li Xizhi first cupped his hands in greeting, then shook out his tattered feathered robe, where a handprint remained on his back. Li Qinghong asked, "What happened?"

Li Xizhi responded concisely, "I was betrayed by someone from the sect and lured into a forbidden area of the Dragon Clan, where I encountered a demonic dragon of the Purple Mansion Realm.

"He had his own reservations and was unwilling to act as a blade for Azure Pond Sect, so he let me go. However, he placed a restriction on me that allows him to observe my surroundings."

Li Qinghong listened to his matter-of-fact tone, but she could well imagine the sheer terror of escaping from a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Upon hearing his final words, she was even more startled, realizing that certain topics could no longer be discussed freely. She hurriedly asked, "How are your injuries?"

"Dissolving the mana left within me has been relatively easy." Li Xizhi’s expression remained calm as he spoke gently, "Initially, it would have lingered in my body, hindering my recovery and damaging my mana, but I have been able to dissolve it quickly. The remaining injuries, while severe, will not obstruct my cultivation path and can be healed with time."

Li Qinghong nodded, pondered for a moment, then asked in a hushed voice, "Was it Chi Zhiyun?"

Li Xizhi shook his head and sat down with his aunt in the cave dwelling before replying, "Aunt, you may not know this, but although Chi Zhiyun has past conflicts with our family, he values his reputation. As long as his bottom line is not crossed, he conducts himself in a fair and upright manner.

"If he truly intended to harm us, how could our family have survived on the lake until now? He would have long found an excuse to wipe us out. As long as he cares about his public image, he cannot openly send people to harm me."

Li Xizhi’s speech quickened slightly as he continued in a soft voice, "This matter is either due to his carelessness, allowing someone to exploit a loophole, or it was the Ning Family attempting to completely control our household and orchestrate my downfall. If it is the latter, it is less concerning. Yuan Su’s lifespan is running out, and our granduncle’s reputation is formidable, so there is no major threat. I'm only afraid that it's the former."

Though Li Qinghong was devoted to her cultivation, she was also a perceptive woman. She frowned and said, "I'm afraid this incident will provoke Chi Zhiyun into wiping everything out in one go! I've seen his methods before. When he decides to be ruthless, he's far more terrifying than the likes of Ning Hejing and Chi Zhiyan."

Li Xizhi nodded solemnly and said in a serious tone, "Aunt, I must ask you to accompany me to Profound Peak Gate! Senior Kong was a close friend of my father. With her as a witness, we can distance ourselves from this matter. I can claim that I never went to Qunyi, that only the Han Family was involved and that no harm was actually done. This should put Chi Zhiyun at ease."

Though this was his outward reasoning, deep down, he had another concern in his heart, I don’t know what kind of person Daoist Master Suiguan is, but if he hears that I escaped from a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, he may personally come to investigate. That would be disastrous!

Li Xizhi wasn’t particularly afraid of his internal talisman seed being discovered. After all, even Chi Buzi had failed to detect it back then. If his internal restriction was found, it wouldn’t be a huge problem. But if the talisman seed retaliated and killed this peak Purple Mansion Daoist Master, Jiangnan would be thrown into chaos.

Suiguan is no ordinary person. If he dies here, Pristine Water will likely emerge on the spot, stepping out from the grotto heaven and dragging me back home to find the Immortal Mirror.

Li Xizhi silently weighed his options, realizing that this course of action was inevitable. Li Qinghong pondered briefly before she said with a sigh, "Even after being harmed, we must pretend as if nothing happened... Such is the fate of the weak."

Li Xizhi nodded in agreement, then Li Qinghong soared into the sky on a flash of lightning. Li Xizhi concealed himself behind her, and together they departed, crossing the Shallow Sea toward Profound Peak Gate.

Both of them traveled at an astonishing speed. After half a month, they landed on the shores of Lake Xian, where Li Qinghong rode her lightning toward the gates of Profound Peak Gate in Shanji Prefecture. The sect shimmered with pale-white radiance, and its cultivators bustled about, appearing quite busy.

She had one of the sect members report to Kong Tingyun and deliberately said, "I heard that my nephew Xizhi is at your esteemed family’s senior’s residence. Please inform Kong Tingyun."

Before long, a streak of golden light shot out from the mountain. Kong Tingyun, dressed in her usual deep indigo robes, approached with evident delight.

"Qinghong, my dear sister!" said Kong Tingyun.

Although Daoist Master Changxi was not particularly renowned in the Purple Mansion Realm, Kong Tingyun was still a descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. She had taken numerous treasured panaceas over the years, giving her an appearance even younger than Li Qinghong’s. She looked no older than her early twenties. With great enthusiasm, she greeted her, "It’s been so many years! What brings you here to visit me?"

Li Qinghong, now carrying an even more refined aura, had her long hair tied as usual. She replied gently, "I heard that Xizhi was here with you, and I was worried. So, I came to check on him."

Kong Tingyun’s ears twitched slightly as she listened to a private mana transmission, then smiled and said, "Please, come into the mountain first."

She activated the formation, and Li Qinghong waited for a brief moment before entering. She landed on Kong Tingyun’s immortal peak, and Li Xizhi revealed himself, bowing respectfully, "Many thanks, Senior."

Kong Tingyun smiled slightly, glanced at him twice, and thought to herself, He carries himself with more noble grace than his father. He must take after that Xiao Family woman.

Though their families were close, she dared not act too familiarly, lest she invite unforeseen trouble. She first said, "Don't rush to thank me. Speak of your business first."

Moongaze Lake.

Li Xijun patrolled the lake for a full round before gracefully landing in the town. Just then, a swirl of gray wind surged toward him and transformed into a human form before him. Li Wushao clasped his hands and spoke softly, "My lord, the heir has emerged from seclusion."

Li Xijun gave a slight nod and stepped forward to the hall's entrance. At the highest seat sat Li Chengliao who wore long garments. He gazed downward at Li Zhouwei, who stood holding a halberd. The boy had broken through after just half a year, achieving the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Xijun glanced at him, mentally calculating his age. Li Zhouwei was only thirteen, achieving the Qi Cultivation Realm even earlier than An Jingming had back in the day.

Minghuang had the boost of a Talisman pill, adding an entire level effortlessly. The medicinal power and spiritual energy he received were incomparable to what An Jingming had...

But An Jingming’s cultivation method, especially during the Embryonic Breathing Realm, allowed for rapid advancement. Comparing the two, it's hard to tell how vast the difference truly is.

After some thought, he stepped into the hall. Li Chengliao and his son turned their gaze toward him, but Li Xijun simply waved his hand and said, "No need for formalities."

He did not say much, only speaking in a low tone, "Xizhi is not on Green Pine Island. I've received other news. The golden rain was indeed caused by the fall of Yuanwu."

At these words, a faint smile appeared on Li Chengliao's face. He smoothed his robe and replied with a clasped hand, "I will make the necessary arrangements at once."

Li Xijun nodded, his thoughts drifting. His hand rested on the hilt of Han Lin, the slender sword gleaming faintly. He gazed at the morning light outside the hall, an unease settling in his heart.

This is a critical moment... yet Xizhi is not in the sect... He only said he went to visit the Han Family... but at a time like this, could something have gone wrong?

Li Xijun silently weighed his options, even hesitating about deploying forces to the eastern shore. However, this opportunity was too rare to pass up. His family had worked hard to secure the right connections, delaying further might cause unforeseen complications.

Standing at the foot of the steps, he observed the quiet mobilization of troops within the town. After calculating the timing, he finally took flight and soared toward the eastern shore.

I can't wait any longer... Granduncle’s letter mentioned that Shangyuan’s breakthrough is imminent and instability in Jiangnan is growing. I must act swiftly...




# Chapter 703: Secret Chamber

Milin Prefecture.

Azure Pond Sect did not impose strict regulations on the division of prefectural cities. These cities varied in size, and Milin Prefecture, which Yuanwu had established for Yu Muxian with just a single word, had always been under Yuanwu Peak’s jurisdiction.

Li Zhouwei rode in on horseback, capturing multiple cities in succession. The defenses crumbled at the first strike and the cultivators stationed in the city were nothing but debauched wastrels. Having long stagnated in their cultivation, they lingered in these lowland areas devoid of spiritual energy and indulged in petty tyranny.

Upon seeing the southern fires blaze and blood qi surge skyward, those with some sense turned and fled. Others who were unable to escape, fell to their knees. Li Zhouwei rode past them without pause, while the cultivators following him swiftly tied up the kneeling figures one by one.

Only a few figures rushed hastily to the city gates, their faces filled with fury as they began cursing.

The middle-aged man’s face was pale and he reeked of alcohol. It was unclear whether he was truly loyal to these esteemed families or merely a fool. His robe looked hastily thrown on and the jade bottle at his waist surged with blood qi. He bellowed, “Which fool from Milin dares act so recklessly? Qingdu has forbidden internecine slaughter. How dare you invade like this? Do you not fear the wrath of the greater families...”

His words barely left his mouth before Li Zhouwei’s halberd erupted with red-black light. With a single thrust, it pierced through his chest, spilling blood across the ground.

Clop, Clop, Clop...

The rapid hoofbeats echoed as he rode on, his expression calm and unwavering. The middle-aged man still hung lifeless from his halberd. With a flick of his wrist, Li Zhouwei flung the body to the ground, where a sickening crack of breaking bones followed.

“The audacity to secretly refine blood qi at Moongaze Lake,” muttered Li Zhouwei.

He flicked the blood from his weapon and entered the city beneath the immortal peak. Dust filled the air, filth and excrement littered the streets and chaos reigned. Emaciated commoners knelt everywhere. Occasionally, a few raised their heads with their sparse gazes sharp as arrows.

To be fair, the esteemed families had already been warned by the Li Family and the commoners under their rule did not live terribly. At least they had food to eat and linen clothes to wear. Yet, the way they looked over still burned with fervor.

After all, the commoners under the Li Family’s rule lived far too well.

The other esteemed families ruled over a mixed society of cultivators and mortals. Though the mortals survived, their lives were ones of servitude and they were subject to the whims of their overlords. They can’t compare to the Li Family’s land. Li Zhouwei galloped down the road, all he saw were bowed heads and countless withered hands prostrating densely upon the ground.

By the time he reached the Lu Family’s immortal peak, their family head at the Qi Cultivation Realm had already bound himself and emerged. He led a group of kneeling followers. Behind him, someone held a formation plate aloft and respectfully declared, “This humble one greets the Lord!”

The Li Family launched a covert operation and Li Zhouwei’s forces were not the only ones deployed. To prevent these esteemed families from fleeing with formation plates, spirit items, or cultivation techniques, seven divisions moved simultaneously. Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators suppressed the skies to ensure no one could escape.

The Li Family approached the battle like a lion pouncing on a rabbit. They went all out, only to overestimate these families. The Lu Family, the strongest among them, immediately activated their formation to welcome the invasion, assuming a submissive posture.

Li Zhouwei’s halberd was still dripping with blood. His expression carried a trace of disappointment. With a flick of his dharma artifact, he hooked up the formation plate and let it drift gently into his hand. Then, he examined it closely, saying, “Mid-grade Qi Cultivation.”

After inspecting it, he retrieved a talisman from his robe and flung it into the air. A golden light instantly shot up into the sky.

The Lu Family head trembled, not daring to speak. Li Zhouwei cast a sweeping glance over the family members behind the family head, then lifted his gaze to the heavens. He waited for twenty minutes, and one after another, golden lights began to rise.

“Six hours.” Li Zhouwei planted his halberd into the ground. Counting the newly risen lights, there were six in total. It was evident that in just one night, Milin Prefecture had fallen into his family’s grasp.

The Yu Family had once risen from the ashes of the Jiang Family, only to later fracture and disperse into the various families of Milin, with the Lu Family as their leader. Now, their gates stood dim and lifeless, shrouded in sheer terror.

These families lacked even a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Their hidden supporter, Jiang Heqian, had vanished without a trace. Even upon witnessing the faint golden glow rising from the south, they remained clueless about what had transpired and their attempts to gather intelligence yielded only fragmented whispers.

The Li Family had struck without warning. Clad in armor, Li Zhouwei rode forth. Wielding his halberd, he carved a bloody path through the families. Only when his army was upon them did they realize the severity of the situation. But by then, it was far too late to flee.

He surveyed the surroundings and spoke in a calm voice, “These remnants of the Yu Family, seal their cultivation and send them to Qingdu to await judgment.”

The Lu Family head turned deathly pale. Hearing Li Zhouwei label them as remnants of the Yu Family, he feared that all of Yu’s sins would be pinned on them. He opened his mouth to explain, but before he could utter a word, the surrounding Jade Court Guards sealed his lips and dragged him away.

Li Zhouwei rested his halberd against his horse. A soft, clear light emerged from his palm which wiped away the lingering blood.

He and his father had long discussed the fate of the Yu Family’s surviving branches. There was no chance they would be allowed to remain in these lands. These people had deep roots here and their own secretive means of cultivating blood qi.

They had fostered numerous landlords and even controlled most of the rogue cultivators, playing a crucial role in the Yu Family’s collapse. Their network of collusion ran deep. So, simply suppressing them was not an option.

“Local tyrants... then let them be exiled,” muttered Li Zhouwei.

Although many of them had consumed blood qi, wiping them all out was not feasible. The best course was to take advantage of the current momentum and force them southward. Once removed from their homeland, they would find it nearly impossible to stir up trouble again.

———

In the sky. Li Xijun had someone escort White Banyan back. Watching as golden talismanic lights rose across the vast Milin Prefecture in an instant, he let out a small sigh of relief as he said, “It seems everything has gone smoothly. None of the families caused trouble.”

That was to be expected. The Golden Tang Gate in the north was too preoccupied with its own affairs, the Fei Family on the northern shore dared not make a move and the western mountains marked the boundary between Azure Pond and Golden Feather Sect. The small temples and Daoist He on the western shore had always been reclusive. He was absorbed in his own matters, with no means to interfere.

The Xiao Family in the east had also been consulted, with an agreement that their vassal families on the eastern shore would remain untouched. The sect had mediated matters clearly. If anything still went awry, that would truly be unusual.

After a brief wait, Li Chengliao, who was clad in a gray cloak, ascended on the wind. At his waist hung the Dragon Coiling Pillar, patterned like fish scales. Having managed the family’s affairs for years, he was a prudent man. He halted before Li Xijun, clasped his hands in greeting, and reported, “Greetings, Eighth Uncle. The eighteen towns and five immortal peaks of Milin Prefecture are now fully under our control. The seven remaining branches of the Yu Family have all been captured and sent to Lijing.”

Li Xijun nodded and spoke softly, “Good. Make sure none are overlooked. Detain them all first.”

He gave his instructions, then asked in a lower voice, “Have you decided on how to handle them?”

Li Chengliao drifted forward with him on the wind and responded in a measured tone, “Eighth Uncle, do you still recall the many shamanic strongholds in Mount Yue?”

Li Xijun gave a slight nod and replied, “Of course.”

With the Li Family’s takeover of Mount Yue, the ancestral grounds of the Yue shamans hidden within the towering mountains were gradually unveiled. These places harbored deeply ingrained cultic worship and were frequently engaging in human sacrifices. The shamans numbered over a hundred thousand, scattered across various regions where ninety-nine percent of them were mere mortals.

As soon as the Li Family conquered Mount Yue, these remote wild temples sent envoys and claimed allegiance to the Li Family. Yet, their territories were barren and treacherous, technically within the domain of the demon den of Mount Dali.

Naturally, the Li Family was unwilling to risk provoking the demon den by delving deeper. Moreover, these mortals were fanatical cultists that were difficult to manage. The cost of governing them far outweighed any potential benefits, so they accepted only their tributes.

Near these desolate lands lay the ruins of Huo Luo’e, another spiritually barren region with a violent populace. This was the very shamanic lands Li Chengliao referred to.

“My plan is this... First, relocate all seven families to Lijing Mountain and register them individually. Then, use them to populate the shamanic territories deep within Mount Yue.

“Those heretical mountain temples are full of brutal customs. Most of the Yue people don’t even speak our language. The land is wild, barren and lacks spiritual energy. So, no cultivator from our family would ever want to go there. Sending our own people would be more of a punishment than a deployment... These seven families are the perfect fit to fill that void!”

Li Chengliao chuckled, clearly having planned this long ago and respectfully added, “These seven families aren’t weak. Placing them there will force them to consume each other while reshaping the culture. At the same time, they will serve as a deterrent to those wild temples, preventing them from engaging in blood sacrifices.”

Hearing this, Li Xijun nodded slightly and responded softly, “It is indeed a good plan. But make sure to send reliable people to oversee them. Keep a heavy hand on supervision.”

Li Xijun raised his sword-like eyebrows slightly and explained, “That place already lacks strong spiritual energy. These seven families are accustomed to consuming blood food, indulging in blood pills and rice meats. If they are sent there, they may only become more extreme... Worse still, they might collude with the wild mountain cults and prey upon the common people together.”

With these words, Li Chengliao immediately understood. He respectfully bowed and replied, “Thank you for your guidance, Eighth Uncle!”

Li Xijun chuckled softly and said, “It’s not really guidance. If you were in my place, you would have seen it yourself. It’s just about planning ahead to minimize losses... If we had acted just two days later, who knows how many more lives would have been lost...”

Li Chengliao nodded and followed behind. Li Xijun descended on the wind, soon arriving at the towering Milin Peak. Though not the best spiritual vein in Moongaze Lake, it was the most expansive and robust one. It was nearly half the size of Xianyou Peak of the Xiao Family.

Milin Prefecture consisted of one main peak and five additional peaks. This place was handled personally by Li Ximing, the highest cultivator present. He merely released the Radiant Origin Pass into the sky and the cultivators in the mountain, bathed in its dazzling light, emerged and surrendered without resistance.

After all, the formation guarding this mountain was no longer the Foundation Establishment Realm formation once built by the Yu Family. Having endured multiple chaotic battles, it had long since fallen into disrepair. Various foreign branches had conspired to dismantle it, each taking a share of the remaining spirit items.
𝕗𝚛𝚎𝚎𝐰𝗲𝗯𝗻𝚘𝚟𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝕞

The current formation was barely at the Qi Cultivation Realm, it was hardly enough to withstand even a few strikes from the Radiant Origin Pass. Li Ximing patrolled the mountain and found its core still intact. The spiritual energy and geomantic lines had not suffered severe damage, but the mountain itself had been stripped of nearly all structures.

The Yu Family had suffered too much turmoil during its fragmentation. Every family had seized what they could and carried off whatever was movable. Almost nothing was left behind, even the Alchemy Pavilion and medicine courts had long since become barren ruins.

Li Xijun landed atop the main peak, where Li Ximing stood waiting. Dressed in a golden Daoist robe, his entire body radiated with dazzling light.

Li Ximing’s cultivation had deepened significantly and his expertise in alchemy had improved as well. Two members from external branches had begun training in the Dao of Alchemy under him and now assisted in his alchemy room. Within the family, he was highly respected and even rogue cultivators occasionally came to seek his medicine.

Seeing Li Xijun and Li Chengliao descend, he first nodded toward Li Chengliao before smiling and saying, “The Yu Family’s storage vaults have been almost completely looted. It’s so empty you could fit a farm in there. I searched carefully twice and only then discovered a few hidden chambers.

“These chambers are reinforced with Foundation Establishment Realm blessings, likely requiring a token or a specific lineage to unlock. These families are all at the Qi Cultivation Realm before and after their split. I suspect only Jiang Heqian had access to them.”

He had clearly waited for Li Xijun to examine them together. Seeing his younger brother nod, he stepped forward, a hint of sentiment in his expression. Tilting his head to glance at him, he sighed and said, “Do you still remember An Jingming?”

Li Xijun naturally nodded and replied in a warm tone, “Other families may not know, but our family remembers him well. Any direct descendant who has read the Family History knows his name.”

Li Ximing sighed and retrieved an object from his sleeve. It was a gray, preserved head. Enchanted with spell arts, it was slightly dried from long storage. Its eyes remained tightly shut, the features lifeless, yet faint traces of heroic spirit still lingered in its brows.

“So now we finally see his face!” Li Xijun glanced at it briefly, noting how much it resembled An Siming and An Siwei, the two brothers. Li Ximing murmured, “An Jingming was too unnatural. After his death, his own family devoured his flesh, leaving only this head behind. The Yu Family couldn’t comprehend its significance, so they preserved it with mana and stored it in their treasury.”

“Later, the Yu Family suffered repeated upheavals, with internal warfare breaking out. The warehouses were rarely visited and when the family finally fractured, their secret vaults were raided. Blood was spilled everywhere.

“In the chaos of looting, no one cared for this head. It was left abandoned in a corner, thrown together with mundane items. If I hadn’t scanned the area with spiritual sense and deliberately searched for it, I might have missed it entirely.”

He silently put the head away, his voice carrying an inexplicable tone as he said, “I’ll store this away in our archives. If I recall correctly, Yu Mugao’s head is still somewhere... Ah... In the end, no matter how much one struggles, it all comes down to death, the destruction of one’s family, and the head falling into another’s hands.”

Li Xijun paused briefly before replying, “Take this back and give it to An Zheyan, so he can properly lay it to rest. As for Yu Mugao’s head, bury it somewhere as well... Let this be the end of past grudges.”

His sharp brows lowered slightly as he continued speaking in a quiet voice, “Today, we look at these severed heads and sigh with sentiment. But I fear that a hundred years from now, if our family were to decline and others break into our vaults, they too might look upon these same heads and sigh. ‘In the end, all past grudges amount to nothing but death and the annihilation of a family.’”

Li Ximing swallowed his words in silence. The two of them walked through the empty treasury until they reached its deepest chamber. Before Li Ximing could speak, Li Xijun had already raised his head, gazing at a blank section of the stone wall. He murmured softly, “There is indeed a hidden chamber. I should have known you’d spot it with your spirit eyes.”

Li Ximing remarked casually. The two of them studied the area for a while before Li Xijun’s keen eyes caught certain details. Though he wasn’t highly knowledgeable about formations, he could still discern some aspects and said in a low voice, “To activate this formation, it likely requires either the Yu Family’s direct lineage or a key from Jade Smoke Mountain. If we attempt to force it open, we might end up destroying whatever lies inside without someone highly skilled in formation arts.”

As soon as Li Xijun said this, Li Chengliao immediately understood and responded, “I’ve heard that after the Yu Family was destroyed, their direct lineage was almost completely wiped out. There may be very few survivors left. I will go investigate right away.”




# Chapter 707: Wrapping Things Up

The Han Family’s Dongliu Island was renowned for its rich deposits of spirit sulfur and spirit brimstone. Their earliest ancestor had been just a rogue cultivator selling spirit sulfur, but through generations of accumulation and currying favor with various powers, they had slowly risen to their current status.

Li Qinghong rode the wind and arrived at Dongliu Island which appeared peaceful and calm. She pondered quietly for a moment, I don’t know what kind of attitude the Han Family has… better not reveal myself just yet.

She cast an invisibility art and descended using her mana, arriving in the bustling market district. The population was decent and cultivators moved to and fro in a steady stream. She located one of the Han Family’s own establishments.

As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, she passed directly through the compound and reached the great hall at the back. There, a steward was busy with an abacus. He was at the Qi Cultivation Realm and appeared dressed like a trusted retainer of the Han Family.

A violet light rippled over her body as she slowly became visible from head to toe, and she asked, “Have your master come out and meet me.”

She suddenly appeared in the courtyard, thunder flashed in her eyes as her aura surged forth. The man was startled at first, then took in her clean jade armor and the mysterious violet flask at her waist. It was clear that she was no ordinary figure.

“Greetings, Fairy! Greetings, Fairy! The patriarch has gone out. I will summon an elder right away!”
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝒆𝒘𝙚𝓫𝙣𝙤𝒗𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

He bowed repeatedly, then hurried off. Not long after, he returned with a middle-aged man in a red robe who was looking anxious. The man who was at the early stage of Foundation Establishment Realm stepped forward and spoke softly, “I am Han Shihai. This is not a suitable place to talk. May I invite the Fairy to follow me inside?”

Li Qinghong nodded. Once they were inside the courtyard and tea had been served, Han Shihai tried to maintain his composure, but he kept turning the jade teacup in his hand as he asked softly, “Fairy… might you be from Azure Pond… or from Moongaze Lake?”

Li Qinghong had been training in the Eastern Sea for many years, often traveling to gather lightning. Occasionally she would stay temporarily and pay visits to nearby factions, so she knew the Han Family fairly well.

She knew well that Han Shizhen and his attendant had already perished. The Han Family had lost two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in one blow. One was a late-stage family head and another was a mid-stage loyal servant. With both arms severed, their wounds were severe enough to shake the very foundation of the family.

The death of Han Shizhen was surely known within the Han Family, but they had managed things well. On the surface, all seemed calm, yet behind the scenes, they were likely gripped by fear and unease.

Li Qinghong sighed inwardly and spoke softly, “I am Li Qinghong of the Li Family. I’ve come regarding a matter concerning my nephew.”

She paused briefly, her expression growing solemn as she asked, “My nephew Xizhi has gone missing. I went to Green Pine Island and heard only that he came to your esteemed family. Might I ask…”

The middle-aged man’s face instantly turned pale as he murmured, “Li Xizhi has gone missing… So it’s true!”

Li Xizhi was not only a disciple of Azure Pond, but also a direct descendant of the Li Family. Han Shihai had yet to recover from the grief of his elder brother’s death, and now felt even more terrified. He asked quickly, “How could this be? Could he have run into some demonic creature?”

He knew full well that this was no trivial matter, the Li Family had connections to the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator within the Azure Pond Sect. If Li Xizhi had truly perished, Azure Pond would never let this slide. His face grew even paler, and then he thought of someone, Li Xuanfeng, the Golden Bowstring!

This man’s reputation had been growing in recent years. The Han Family had personally witnessed him slay a mid-Foundation Establishment demonic beast. After just a few arrows near Dongliu Island, the creature had plunged straight into the sea!

If something happened to Li Xizhi, that ruthless man won’t let it go easily! I’ve heard he’s unreasonable. He might just storm the island!

Han Shihai’s face grew even paler. Their family’s ancestor had gone into seclusion decades ago to attempt a breakthrough into Purple Mansion Realm. By now, after so long without news, they were most likely dead. And now, with two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators dead, they had drawn the suspicion of the Li Family and Azure Pond Sect…

Seeing the whitened lips and panicked expression on his face, Li Qinghong could tell he’d already connected many dots. The words she had prepared were now tempered, and she thought to herself, The Han Family has long held friendly ties with ours. Han Shizhen may have come for profit, but in the end, he perished while handling Xizhi’s matter… In a way, it’s our Li Family that owes them. I shouldn’t press him too hard.

Her expression turned solemn. She didn’t take a single sip of her tea, setting the jade cup lightly on the table as she asked, “Is Han Shizhen dead?”

Han Shihai trembled. He had no idea how she knew, but could only respond sorrowfully, “Yes… But… but I truly don’t know where my elder brother took your esteemed one! I heard it was in search of Yuan Tuan…”

As a cultivator of the Eastern Sea, he had long grown used to death and injury. He wasn’t even thinking about avenging his brother as he only wanted to get through this situation as quickly as possible. He said in a low voice, “Fairy, do you have any news about them? Truly, this has nothing to do with our family!”

Li Qinghong paused, then said softly, “I do know a few things… It was in pursuit of Yuan Tuan. Since this was a private matter, I won’t press too hard. Finding them is the priority. Do you have any idea where they might have gone? I’ll go search.”

Han Shihai looked as if he’d been granted amnesty and quickly replied, “I heard they headed toward the Qunyi Sea!”

“Very well, I’ll go search there.” Li Qinghong nodded, seemingly ready to ride the lightning and depart. But then, as if suddenly remembering something, she spoke offhandedly, “Azure Pond Sect will likely send someone to investigate and they won’t be as lenient as I am. Fellow Daoist, you’d best pray for good fortune.”

Han Shihai had just begun to breathe easy when tension returned with a vengeance. Li Qinghong had struck right at his sore spot. He quickly said, “Fairy, please wait!”

Seeing Li Qinghong turn back, he immediately put on a sorrowful face. His expression shifted swiftly as he pleaded in a low, grief-stricken voice, “Our family has so few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Yet my elder brother took someone into the Eastern Sea and lost his life for nothing. Azure Pond Sect is fierce, just as you say, they won’t show mercy… Please, Fairy… show us a way forward.”

He gritted his teeth and said softly, “I don’t know the full details of the entanglement between my brother and your Daoist, but if your esteemed family has any requests, our Han Family is willing to cooperate fully. We'll help your family search for the Daoist’s whereabouts!”

Han Shihai was doing his best to curry favor, but Li Qinghong wasn’t the type to kick someone when they were down. All she cared about was the Han Family keeping this quiet, she had no mind to take advantage. She simply replied, “Fellow Daoist, our two families have a history of friendship and many years of trade. To be fair and honest, most of the blame for this doesn’t lie with your esteemed family.”

She gave a small nod and continued saying, “If Azure Pond Sect sends someone, your family need only insist that Xizhi came asking for news, then parted ways with your people. My family has connections within the sect, we won’t let your family fall afoul of Azure Pond.”

Han Shihai was stunned for a moment, then realization slowly dawned in his heart, That’s right… Inland families like the Li Family are said to value virtue and morality. No wonder she’s letting us off so easily… Good, good. People like her care about honor and reputation, I should flatter her a bit more.

With that thought, he immediately put on a grateful expression, his eyes almost brimming with tears, his face once again assuming sorrow as he spoke in a hushed tone, “Fairy! Thank you, Fairy! Such great kindness and virtue, our household has no way to repay it. Your sense of right and wrong truly makes you a model among the inland families…”

Han Shihai went on with scattered and overly careful praise, wracking his brain to say the right things. But Li Qinghong, having spent so many years overseas, knew exactly what these outer-sea families were like. She simply nodded perfunctorily and instructed, “There’s one thing for you to take note of, I came here quietly. Aside from that steward, no one else saw me on the island. This conversation must be kept secret, no third party must know. Just act as if I was never here.”

Han Shihai immediately understood, a ruthless glint flashing across his face. He revealed the true nature of an outer-sea cultivator as he respectfully said, “Rest assured, Fairy. No third person will ever know.”

Li Qinghong saw it clearly, the steward’s fate was likely sealed. But it was another family’s affair and concerned the Han Family’s very survival. She cupped her hands slightly, a hint of urgency appeared on her face as she said, “I must hurry to find my nephew. I truly can’t linger here any longer!”

This excuse only made Han Shihai believe her more. He nodded repeatedly, but still felt uneasy. Then he noticed that Li Qinghong hadn’t yet left, she was watching him with a pleasant smile. At that moment, Han Shihai understood and thought, She’s still expecting something!

He thought for just a moment. The Demon Subduing Copper Rods from the Yuan Family had always felt too hot to hold. He quickly took them from his storage pouch and lied, “This item is a dharma artifact once belonging to Yuan Chengdun. It fell into the hands of a rogue cultivator, and we later acquired it. We hadn’t yet had the chance to present it to the Daoist, so we’ll entrust it to you, Fairy.”

Li Qinghong glanced at the rods and saw their brilliant glow. The twin rods had blue-gold hue with intricate patterns. A rare matched pair of Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts. She replied, “This was a relic of Elder Yuan. He had ties with our family. I’ll see to it this is returned to his eldest son. I won’t claim it for myself.”

Han Shihai stared at her blankly, watching her take her leave and vanish outside the formation. He stood there for several breaths before murmuring, “Virtue… truly the most extravagant of all things.”

He was faintly moved, his hand resting on his sword as he walked to the threshold. The steward was lurking nearby, peeking out nervously. Upon seeing him, the man quickly withdrew his head, bowing quietly, waiting at his side.

If not for his brother’s death, Han Shihai might have rewarded the man in a moment of ease. But now, he smiled pleasantly and said, “Come.”

The steward took a step forward. Then, Han Shihai drew his sword and brought it down in one swift stroke, beheading him. The blood hadn’t even begun to spurt before it was drawn into the small gourd at Han’s waist. Flesh was stripped and bones crushed. In a matter of a few seconds, the man had vanished completely.

Han Shihai shook the jade gourd, listening to the sounds inside as he silently calculated, I’ll still need a proper excuse… to conceal my brother’s death, so the nearby families don’t start getting ideas.

Milin Peak.

The items from the secret chamber of Milin Peak had all been brought out, filling the hall completely. Li Ximing, distracted, was fiddling with the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token in his hand.

The token had a smooth, silver-gray surface. When exposed to sunlight, it would regain its silvery-white and purplish hue. But whatever had once been inside it had long been taken out. Only the notably sturdy shell remained.

Li Xijun was counting the treasures. He glanced briefly at Li Ximing and said gently, “Keep that Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token for now. When there’s a chance, send it to the southern border. Great uncle practices the Metal Dao, it would be better in his hands.”

“Understood.” Li Ximing replied, then muttered, “Merging Fire, Converging Water, Harmonising Metal… If the pattern holds, there should be five tokens. I wonder what they’re for. Converging Water… maybe it’s in the hands of the Dragon family.”

Li Xijun chuckled and simply said, “I’ve never heard of this Harmonising Metal. Perhaps it belongs to some Dao lineage in the north…”

He mentioned it in passing, then turned his attention back to the items before him. The Yu Family had suffered repeated setbacks in recent years and their foundation had been nearly exhausted. The only things truly worth taking were a few treasured panaceas.

Li Xijun was less knowledgeable in this area than Li Ximing, so he waited for him to take the jade box and lift the lid. Inside was a purple fruit that was the size of a fist. It was covered in countless tiny holes, with wisps of smoke drifting lazily from it.

Li Ximing examined it closely and replied, “Purple Lian Bodhi.”

He studied it carefully as it was his first time seeing such a thing. He spoke softly, “This is not something of the Immortal family.”

“Hmm?”

Li Xijun frowned, while Li Ximing, who had received instruction from Xiao Yuansi and was quite well-informed, explained softly, “It’s said that the Revered One wandered the nations, and wherever he paused in the face of mortal suffering, a strange fruit would appear. That fruit was the Purple Lian Bodhi. It is highly prized by Buddhist cultivators.”

“Indeed.” Li Xijun nodded and said in a low voice, “Kongheng has served our family in the Eastern Sea for decades. He was diligent, loyal and never asked for anything. We’ve never rewarded him properly… Let’s gift him this.”

Li Ximing naturally had no objection. He picked up two more jade boxes to examine. One of the remaining treasured panaceas was small and light. It was barely the size of an eyeball, pure white and crystal clear, as though it might float away at any moment. It was the healing Gorgecloud Vine.

The other emitted flickering flames that were bright yet hazy. Its long, slender body radiated intense heat. It was the rare fire-type treasured panacea, the Tai Fire Longfruit. Neither of them could identify the specific Fire Dao. It was clearly not Merging Fire, but the brilliance of the flames was unmistakable.

The two quickly packed everything away. Li Xijun summoned Li Chengliao and handed off the remaining matters to him, giving instructions, “Senior White Banyan is still waiting in town, I shouldn’t keep him waiting. I’ll head over now.”

Li Ximing nodded as well and went down to enter seclusion. Li Xijun rose with the wind, glancing across the southern and eastern shores, where his family’s banners now flew. Nearly half of the vast Moongaze Lake was under his family’s control.

He gazed quietly for a moment, recalling his conversation years ago with Li Yuanjiao about unifying Moongaze Lake and relocating the family to that land. That dream no longer felt so far away.

I need to work harder.

He drifted down on wind and snow, entering Lijing Town. As he landed nearby, he saw a bustling crowd. Many family men had gathered beneath a side hall, all looking up toward a specific spot.
𝗳𝐫𝚎𝗲𝚠𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝘃𝚎𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺

Li Xijun was slightly taken aback. There was White Banyan, one leg crossed as he sat on the rooftop eaves, the other leg dangling and swaying atop the tiles. He held a bowl of purple fruits and he was grinning down at the crowd below.

As he ate, he casually tossed fruits down and prompted the crowd to reach up eagerly as his eyes gleamed in anticipation.

“Truly a fox’s nature.” Li Xijun chuckled. The crowd of family men immediately grew nervous and dropped to their knees. He descended for a closer look and saw that they were all mortals. He waved them off and took to the air once more.

White Banyan, looking a little guilty, hurriedly tucked away the bowl of fruit and quickly changed the subject, asking, “How did it go?”

Li Xijun bowed respectfully and said with a smile, “Reporting to the senior. It went smoothly, of course.”

“Ohhh, very good.” White Banyan nodded, and Li Xijun led him all the way to Mount Qingdu, explaining, “Our family has now relocated to this mountain. If the senior visits again, you can come directly to Mount Qingdu.”

White Banyan acknowledged with a quiet hum, then lowered his gaze and said, “No wonder. I searched all over that mountain and couldn’t find Li Tongya’s grave… So it was moved. Let me pay respects to the departed first!”




# Chapter 709: Yanyang

Spring rain poured continuously. Li Tongya's grave had only been renovated ten years ago, but the tombstone remained the same as it had been back then. It was simple and elegant, standing quietly in the spring rain.

White Banyan stood before the grave for only a few seconds. Gazing up at the sea of tombstones, he stammered a few words in confusion, then backed away and muttered blankly, "Forget it... I'll choose another day to come... Let’s go inside and sit for a while first."

Li Xijun figured he was feeling a bit uneasy, so he led him into the main hall. He had already instructed someone earlier, and now a storage pouch was being brought forward. Li Xijun respectfully said, “Congratulations on your breakthrough, senior. This is a small token of respect, please accept it...”

Since White Banyan was, after all, a demonic creature, he didn’t stand on ceremony. He casually took the storage pouch, hooked it onto his belt and settled into the seat.

He was small in stature as he sat cross-legged in the seat. Turning slightly, he asked, “Upon coming out of seclusion, I visited the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator and heard that the world is in turmoil now. Is it true that Daoist Master Shangyuan is about to break through?”

Seeing Li Xijun nod, White Banyan continued, “My master said that there’s discord within the Immortal Dao. Disputes arose, and after much delay with pushing responsibilities toward the Dragon family, they finally gave up on the Thundercloud Grotto Heaven. Over a dozen Purple Mansion Realm cultivators entered together, seized what they could and quickly withdrew.”

Li Xijun didn’t know the secrets of this so-called Thundercloud Temple Grotto Heaven. It seemed even the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators couldn’t sweep it clean of treasures. He sighed inwardly, What a pity, our family had no chance to get a share. I’d even thought my aunt might have an opportunity...

Since the topic had come up, Li Xijun immediately seized the opportunity to ask, “May I ask, senior... My brother’s master became trapped in that grotto heaven... There’s been no word from him. Whether it’s good or ill, we still don’t know...”

Of course, Li Xijun was referring to Yuan Tuan. White Banyan lifted his cup, as if he had already expected this question, and said with a smile, “Someone from the Yuan Family? Cultivating the Azure Manifestation? Then this tribulation is one he was destined to face...”

White Banyan sipped his tea and continued saying, “You should know that the grotto heaven is the Thundercloud Temple, which in its prime called itself the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling. Its founding ancestor came from the north and was once the first disciple of the Yanyang Temple!”

“Yanyang Temple?” That name sounded quite familiar. Li Xijun, who had thoroughly studied the family history and had even personally overseen the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique to match fate for Li Wushao, immediately recalled, “That’s the Dao lineage attained by an ancestor of the Yuan Family!”

“This Yanyang Temple was rather interesting in its day.” White Banyan kept chattering as he spoke, “The founder of the temple-palace was a man named Can Yanzi, who in ancient times studied under a Dao Embryo Realm cultivator as a recorded disciple. Later, he had a wild idea and wanted to merge the Immortal and Buddhist Daos into one.

“But he couldn’t withstand it. He lost his mind and transformed into an immortal peak in the north, known as Yan Mountain... All these are ancient history, not worth dwelling on... but in short, there’s some heritage there.

“Our Mount Dali’s demon den has watched events unfold from here and knows of the Yuan Family. Their cultivation Dao is the Azure Manifestation, Azure Dam Divine Mountain Sprawling Essence. Nowadays, very few cultivate the Earth Virtue, so the Yuan Family has some renown.”

He crossed his legs and slouched lazily against the chair back and continued saying, “The Yuan Family thought no one was paying attention and didn’t even take much precaution, but how could they escape the eyes of Golden Core Realm cultivators? One look and they knew the Dao lineage they had acquired was from the northern Yanyang Temple!”

The rest was self-evident. Li Xijun followed the thread of his words and said softly, “So that’s how it is! I suppose the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators hoped to use the connection between Yanyang Temple and Thundercloud Temple to obtain more from this grotto heaven...”

White Banyan nodded and smiled with a hint of sarcasm, he said, “No matter how far the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling has declined, it’s still of the human race. With a few dragons circling it, how much favor can they expect? Naturally, they needed someone aligned with the lineage... to be sent in as a key.”

Li Xijun instantly understood and thought to himself, No wonder Yuan Tuan vanished without a word, it must have been beyond his control. These secrets circulated freely among the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm cultivators. No matter how clever she is, how could she have guessed? She must’ve been sent out by Azure Pond, only to be awaited by several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the Dragon family. She had no chance.

As for Yuan Chengdun... perhaps he knew as well. He headed for the Eastern Sea with tragic resolve, leaving behind a backup plan to give his eldest son a way out... only for it to be sold off cheaply by his elders... what a pity!

Li Xijun felt a pang of sympathy, like a fox mourning the death of a rabbit. He thought of when Li Tongya had fallen, perhaps the Yuan Family had felt the same way, schemed against from birth to death. The realization gave him a chill as he thought, Back when Chi Wei wanted to refine a pill, Yuan Tuan suppressed her Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough for so long. I’d wondered why Azure Pond couldn’t find a way to coerce her, assuming that her Immortal Foundation Realm was more valuable. But now it seems... she had many potential uses, destined to come in handy eventually!

Images floated before his eyes. The images of Yuan Tuan silently suppressing her cultivation on the mountain, while Chi Wei and the others sat on the clouds with faint, mocking smiles. He drifted into distraction, and White Banyan, seemingly unaware, reached into his sleeve and pulled out a string of fruits, tossing one into his mouth.

Can’t get used to spirit tea, fruit still tastes better. White Banyan muttered inwardly, then continued, “The Yuan Family is the same! You esteemed families are no different from the demonic beasts we raise on our peaks...”

Li Xijun responded with a sound, but his heart suddenly sank, Brother Xizhi never mentioned any of this! If the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are gathered around that grotto heaven, and he’s heading there... wouldn’t his life be hanging by a thread?!

Terror gripped his heart, but with no way to contact Li Xizhi now, he had to suppress his panic. He quickly called someone over and quietly gave instructions to send word.

White Banyan sat on his own for a while, then suddenly asked, “I heard a rumor in our den, your esteemed family is of Bright Yang lineage?”

Li Xijun sighed inwardly. He felt this matter was spreading more and more, and in time, it would no longer be possible to conceal it. He could only wave it off, while White Banyan appeared lost in thought.
𝚏𝕣𝕖𝚎𝚠𝚎𝚋𝚗𝐨𝐯𝕖𝕝.𝕔𝐨𝕞

The two chatted for a while, but White Banyan quickly grew restless and hurriedly conveyed what he needed to say, “I heard the elders in our den are planning to attend a ceremony in the Northern Sea in a few months. It’s likely about Shangyuan’s breakthrough. Best we avoid heading to the Northern Sea... there might be Golden Core Realm cultivators watching.

“Even if we can’t go directly to the Northern Sea, we can watch from afar. Who knows, maybe we’ll gain some insight.”

He laughed and continued saying, “After all, an event like this only comes once in several decades. And this is Shangyuan, the number one Sword Immortal of the past century. Just imagine that everyone from Embryonic Breathing Realm to Golden Core Realm, across the mainland and the outer seas, will be watching. That’s a sight worth seeing.”

Now that Li Xijun finally had the chance, he didn’t want to let White Banyan go so easily, so he quickly followed up with a question, asking, “In the Jade True Dao, is the Fruition Attainment position still unclaimed?”

White Banyan paused slightly. His expression finally turned solemn, and he said with a nod, “Correct! If Shangyuan succeeds in his breakthrough, he won’t just be the first Golden Core Realm cultivator in five centuries, he will refine the Jade True Unified Void Essence and become the holder of the Jade True Fruition Attainment. We will bear witness to a transformation of heaven and earth.”

He smiled again with a fox like cunning flashing across his face. He said, “If Shangyuan became a new True Monarch, regardless of anything else, it might very well shift the course of all cultivation arts.”

Li Xijun escorted him down the mountain. Watching White Banyan fly back to Mount Dali, he still felt uneasy. Below, his family men were rejoicing, their songs and dances filling the air.

After all, expansion was a very effective way to ease internal conflict. The Yu Family, which was a big piece of the pie, had been swallowed. And seven other families were thoroughly uprooted and sent off to Mount Yue. The space that remained could give rise to seven or eight new prominent families and everyone was eager and full of hope.

Li Xijun returned to the Jade Platform himself with an unsettled mind, A great shift is coming... If Daoist Master Shangyuan succeeds, it may be a transformation the likes of which hasn’t been seen in five hundred years.

Central hall.

The steps of the central hall gleamed, and the boots made crisp, pleasant sounds as Li Zhouwei strolled in. The family guards on both sides bowed their heads in deference.

Having broken through to Qi Cultivation Realm, Li Zhouwei now handled some family affairs and was gradually taking over the chief’s duties. The strangeness he’d carried since birth had faded greatly. He now looked more like a living man and would even smile occasionally when he spoke.

But when his subordinates erred, the sharpness in his eyes returned, enough to make others tremble. Chen Yang followed behind him, sword in hand, as they entered the inner chamber together.

Li Zhouwei set his halberd on the rack, glanced at Chen Yang beside him and saw that he was still at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He lowered his gaze and said, “Chen Yang, step forward.”

A warning bell rang in Chen Yang’s heart. Like lightning, he reviewed all recent events in his mind but found no mistake. He thought to himself. What is this tiger scheming again...? This doesn’t feel right...

He stepped forward and bowed respectfully, saying, “Your subordinate is here!”

Li Zhouwei pulled a jade vial from his robe and tossed it into his arms, speaking casually, “This is Bright Spirit Powder. Take it quickly and break through.”

Chen Yang paused, slightly stunned, and accepted it with suspicion. Li Zhouwei wiped his weapon and said softly, “I know you’re not satisfied. I’ll report to Qingdu and try to allocate resources to you according to your lineage.”

He sat quietly and continued, “Feel free to try and see if you can catch up to me.”

Chen Yang slowly raised his head and saw, at last, a hint of a smile in those always-calm eyes. He met the gaze squarely, openly and responded in a low voice. Seeing Li Zhouwei wave his hand, he quickly withdrew.

It wasn’t until he had walked out of the main hall and returned to his own cave dwelling that a look of eager determination appeared on Chen Yang’s face. His gray eyes narrowed slightly.

He had been suppressed by Li Zhouwei for years. Outwardly obedient, he had nonetheless studied his every move in secret, observing his character and handling every task perfectly. He laid the groundwork for his own advancement.

Chen Yang calculated inwardly and murmured, “Then let’s try... We are both Qingdu blood.”

———

Grand hall.

Li Zhouwei watched Chen Yang depart, set his weapon aside and quietly stared at the sunlight filtering into the hall.

Chen Yang is shrewd and decisive... takes pride in the Li bloodline, and is full of ambition... It’s just a shame he’s not my full brother...

Since taking over family affairs, he had gradually come to understand his generation better. Li Ximing had weak heirs, Li Xijun remained unmarried to this day and only Li Xicheng’s line had a flourishing number of descendants.

Looking across them, most had decent temperament but only average talent that was not even close to Chen Yang. Li Zhouwei could only elevate him to a middle rank, but it was difficult to keep him close.

He pondered a while but wasn’t overly concerned. He removed his outer robe and stepped into the courtyard beyond.

Li Zhouwei’s gray-brown eyes narrowed slightly as he sensed something off. His spiritual sense swept through the area and found a young woman standing obediently with her head lowered and silent.

He gave her a brief glance and understood at once. He thought, I just passed my fourteenth birthday a few days ago. The family must’ve sent someone ahead.

Li Zhouwei understood clearly. He stepped forward without hesitation and opened the door. The girl startled slightly and rose, bowing her head as she spoke, “I am Xu Peiyu. Greetings, heir.”

Li Zhouwei gave a brief acknowledgement, slowly walked forward and invited her to sit. He began to observe her closely.

Her face was slightly round, with delicate brows and curved eyes. It was the classic look of someone from the Northern Jiangnan region. She had clearly been carefully selected and looked several years older than him. She was already smiling even before speaking.

As Li Zhouwei studied her, Xu Peiyu was also quietly observing him. She glanced at his eyes only once, carefully, yet even so, was abruptly seized by an overwhelming feeling.

She suddenly felt as though a golden radiance had taken form before her. His eyes seemed filled with vibrant color, so dazzling they made her breath catch. She exclaimed involuntarily, “Ah!”

Xu Peiyu was eighteen, well-versed in how to charm and manipulate men with feigned modesty. Yet at this moment, she was completely entranced. A strange passion surged in her chest and she didn’t even notice when the man before her took her hand.

All her careful plans vanished before that face and those eyes, gone before she even realized it. Not until she lay upon the bed did she begin to come to her senses.

Li Zhouwei simply watched her flushed face. His eyes were frank and clear which revealed his desire. He asked, “You’re from the Xu Family? What do you want?”

This was a perfect opportunity, yet Xu Peiyu found herself speechless. That face, so perfectly to her taste, left her powerless. After a moment’s thought, she replied, “Men like you, when they take without returning, are somehow all the more irresistible to women.”

She felt an immense sense of comfort in her act of devotion, as if she were wrapped in the shadow of a vast, towering beast. A deep sense of safety rose within her. Even if he were to devour her body like a tiger or leopard, the thought still pleased her.

Li Zhouwei paused in surprise. A strange emotion stirred within him, this kind of fiery feeling was something he had seemingly never experienced before. He couldn’t help but smile faintly and spoke a few gentle, pleasing words.

Li Zhouwei was born able to sense the emotions of others. In this moment, it felt as if a fire was burning before him and offering itself to him entirely. A faint, unfamiliar sense of being moved rose within his heart.

After all, he was only fourteen. For all his cunning, the books he had read only taught him how to outwit enemies, divide factions and maintain power. It never taught him how to love. He simply held her close, trying to mimic the tone of romantic words he’d seen in books and suddenly, a quiet hope stirred within him, Us second lineage has mostly lived one life with one partner... following our ancestral founder, Lord Tongya, as an example... Even if I cannot give her the title of wife, I could still have only her.

As he was still deep in thought, he noticed that Xu Peiyu didn’t seem to be listening to him at all. She gazed blankly at the bridge of his nose, her slender hand rested on his shoulder and quietly slid downward until it reached his chest.

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly, and his emotions stilled in an instant. After studying her expression for just a moment, he understood immediately.

He cooled instantly, let out two self-mocking chuckles and suddenly grasped a simple truth, To deal with someone lacking firm resolve, all it takes is a Bright Yang body with enough allure.

He lowered his gaze, as though watching a fantasy quietly unravel, he thought, Unfortunately, I was born with unnatural gifts. For me, most people in the world have weak minds. She’s just a mortal, how could she possibly endure my test?

He could only push her away and return to sit at the head seat. Looking at the infatuation in Xu Peiyu’s eyes, he thought to himself, No wonder they fear me!




# Chapter 711: Divine Ability

Azure Pond Sect.

The main hall of Azure Pond Sect was grand and towering, shrouded in ethereal mist. White jade steps led upward and radiant spirit lamps glowed brightly. White spiritual qi flowed like fog. Chi Zhiyun was descending the steps when he saw a middle-aged man approaching with steady, relaxed steps. He simply asked, "What is it?"

The man was naturally Ning Hejing. He clasped his hands and replied, "Reporting to the sect master, the people from Green Pine Island have returned... They met a few individuals. Li Xizhi’s younger sister said he went to the Han Family but has since disappeared.

"Later, others went to the Han Family, but that family claimed Li Xizhi had left early and only sent some Han Family members to investigate the Qunyi Sea."

Ning Hejing paused, then continued, "Following the trail, we heard that Li Xizhi had accepted an invitation from Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak Gate and went to Xia Mountain to gather Dawn Colored Qi on behalf of Daoist Master Changxi. As for the two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of the Han Family, they are most likely already dead."

Chi Zhiyun listened quietly, his expression somewhat intriguing. He merely asked, "So you're saying Li Xizhi never went near Thundercloud Temple, but instead went straight to Profound Peak Gate... Interesting."

Ning Hejing bowed his head in response, then heard Chi Zhiyun murmur, "Could it be that Changxi made a move?"

A hesitant look appeared on Ning Hejing’s face, but Chi Zhiyun quickly shook his head and said, "It likely wasn't that Daoist. He hasn't cultivated a Life Divine Ability and wouldn't dare meddle in Azure Pond’s affairs..."

Both of them were direct disciples of an immortal sect, with elders from the Purple Mansion Realm in their families. So they were well-versed in Purple Mansion divine abilities and the various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Jiangnan.

Though all Purple Mansion Realm cultivators forged divine abilities, not all abilities were of the same type. They spanned a wide range which included Body Divine Ability, Life Divine Ability, and Eye Divine Ability... each possessed its own marvels, but the most crucial was the Life Divine Ability.

The Life Divine Ability was key to how Purple Mansion Realm cultivators touched upon fate. It resembled many techniques of Buddhist cultivators. It could confuse the heart and question the mind, subtly influence the course of events or discern traces of omens to deduce the truth.

Though it was rare for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to clash outright, except for those few at the peak, it was only those with a Life Divine Ability who could truly be considered players in the game. It was a true threshold.

Because each sect’s Daoist Masters wielded different divine abilities, the immortal sects also varied in strength. For example, Purple Smoke Gate had two peak Purple Mansion Realm Daoists and was vaguely considered the strongest beneath the top three sects. Meanwhile, the weakest, Snow Ji Gate, had its Purple Mansion Realm cultivator missing for years and even its disciples no longer dared show their faces.

Several of Azure Pond Sect’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivators possessed Life Divine Abilities. Back then, among the so-called Azure Pond Three Primordials, Yuan Su was the most renowned. He was known not only for his immensely powerful seal, but also for his divine ability, Spring’s Echo of the Pristine Water, which was both a Body and Life Divine Ability. It was an exceedingly mystical art.

As for Daoist Master Changxi, his cultivated divine ability was Fool's Mountain Chase, a rare art-type divine ability that was not suited for offense. In recent years, he’d stagnated due to the lack of techniques and had always been the most unassuming among the seven sects. Naturally, Chi Zhiyun had no reason to suspect him.

After pondering for a moment, Ning Hejing asked, "Could it be Daoist Master Chuting...?"

At the mention of Xiao Chuting, both of their expressions grew uneasy. Xiao Chuting had not appeared in years, yet he remained a figure that inspired apprehension.

This Daoist Master had clawed his way into the Purple Mansion Realm from narrow odds, struggling with every step. But later, he moved with grace and ease. By now, he had become someone all sides sought to win over.

Chi Zhiyun's expression darkened but he still shook his head and said softly, "If Xiao Chuting had made a move, it wouldn’t need to be done like this... Besides, he’s been in the Northern Sea this whole time, likely with Yuan Xiu over in Cangzhou. There's no way he could be manipulating events in the Eastern Sea from across thousands of miles..."

Ning Hejing fell silent for several seconds before finally saying, "I don’t understand how he dared go to the Northern Sea!"

Chi Zhiyun replied in a low voice, "It’s the grand occasion of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator attempting a breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm. Xiao Chuting wouldn’t want to miss that. Besides... his cultivation is aligned with Pit Water, and Cangzhou has the strongest Pit Water. This is a rare opportunity for him."

Ning Hejing parted his lips slightly, his voice barely above a whisper, "What you say is true, sect master... but... Xiao Xianyou’s death back then was suspicious, it was likely at the hands of Shangyuan. The ones below dare not speak of it, the Xiao Family dare not acknowledge it, but Xiao Chuting must know! If I were him, I wouldn’t even dare set foot in the north..."

Chi Zhiyun’s expression turned worse as he replied curtly, "Enough talk! How many were involved in the Donghua and Li Jiangqun affair back then? It wasn’t just Xiao Xianyou, even that one from Purple Smoke Gate was part of it too. Yuanwu, Yuan Xiu... which of them didn’t have a hand in it? There’s no reason he wouldn’t dare to go to Yue Cultivating Sect.

"Shangyuan was brought up by Donghua... but would he dare do anything? If you ask me, even if he became a Golden Core Realm cultivator, he wouldn’t dare say much about this matter..."

Ning Hejing could only nod repeatedly. As the two briefly touched upon events from centuries ago, a chill ran through their hearts. Chi Zhiyun reined in his emotions and came to a conclusion, "If Li Xizhi truly didn’t go, it’s ninety percent likely due to coincidence... but there’s still that sliver of possibility..."

Ning Hejing nodded slightly and spoke in a low voice, "It’s also possible the man was just putting on a show... He never truly intended to investigate Yuan Tuan’s case, which is why he let himself get sidetracked so easily... After all, once Yuan Tuan died, Qingsui Peak fell into his hands."

Chi Zhiyun nodded ambiguously, seemingly holding back other thoughts. He waved Ning Hejing away and sat alone in his seat.

After waiting a moment, he rose on the wind and flew to the top of Azure Pond Peak. There, white mist cloaked the summit and clouds drifted dreamily. He entered the veil and made his way to the deepest part of the cave dwelling.

At the deepest point was a clear, luminous pool. Chi Zhiyun examined the surroundings carefully and then gently formed a spell seal.

Lines of glowing inscriptions lit up rapidly across the cave’s stone walls, spreading densely to seal off the inside from the outside. The faint fluctuations they gave off were immensely powerful. It was a Purple Mansion Realm formation that even isolated the surrounding void.

Only then did Chi Zhiyun bend down, eyes burning with fervor as he gazed at the deep pool. After waiting for a full quarter-hour, a reflection slowly emerged in the once pitch-black water.

Though above the pool was nothing but bare blue rock, the water reflected a small tree that was silver-white and dazzling. Delicate and beautiful leaves shimmered like silver threads, rising and falling gently with the ripples in the pool.

Soft moonlight began to drift outward. Chi Zhiyun gazed silently at the small tree within the pool as he calculated the days in his mind and his heart filled with growing joy. He murmured, "It’s close... so close... it’s about to bear fruit... Buzi hoarded them every time, no matter how much I begged, he wouldn’t give me even one. But now that bastard has gone missing. At last, I have the chance to consume this fruit... just a little more time..."

As he calculated silently, the small tree within the pool stretched gently as if it was breathing. It released a soft and radiant moonlight shine. Around the pool’s edge, wisps of orchid grass sprouted which exuded a pleasant fragrance.

Yi Mountain City.

The ancient walls of Yi Mountain City were weathered, etched with countless traces of runes. A group of guards atop the walls looked downward. The desolate land before the gates was littered with white bones. A few crows had landed on the barren ground and were cawing harshly.

Above them stood a group of youths in luxurious robes, starkly contrasting with the family cultivators at their sides. One of them even sat suspended in midair, holding a wine cup and was leisurely admiring the view.

To the guards, Yi Mountain City was a place where lives were gambled. But to these Azure Pond Sect disciples, it was merely a site for bartering with demonic creatures and tempering disciples. It was hardly something to fear.

A few of them were in a playful mood, they were chatting and drinking atop the city wall. Slightly left of center sat a youth who seemed tipsy. He was leaning lazily against the wall.

His robe was loose and he straddled the steps as he tilted his head while raising his cup. His gray-black eyes were dazed with intoxication. This was Li Yuanqin, son of Li Xuanfeng in the southern border. He was seated at the center of the group.

The group chatted boisterously about amusing stories from various families and who in which immortal sect had obtained new fortunes. One man drank and said with a laugh, "Brother Yuanqin, you carry that bow on your back every day. Why not take a shot and let us see how much of your father's skill you’ve inherited?"

Li Yuanqin sneered at the comment, unstrapped the bow from his back and tossed it casually to the man as he said, "What skill could I have? It's just for show."

The group exchanged glances and, in unspoken agreement, shifted the topic. Soon, someone brought up a joke and said, "I heard there’ve been big changes in the southern border recently. Several of the shaman kingdoms near the northern edge are warring with each other. Rumor has it they’re trying to form some kind of major sect... Quite a strange thing."

The southern border wasn’t entirely ruled by demonic creatures, only Yi Mountain City faced their territory directly. The borderlands stretched for thousands of miles, running near Wu State and even bordering the territory of the Golden Feather Sect.

There were many shaman kingdoms in that region and most were raised by demonic creatures as a food source. Some were obscure minor factions, many of which perished during the devil plague.

"Weren’t there already many minor sects in that area...?" One of them asked.

Those tiny sects and humble temples were nothing compared to the massive Three Sects and Seven Gates. Most were founded by Qi Cultivation Realm rogue cultivators, nestled in the vast wilderness between Wu State and the southern border. They rose and fell with each day. He wore a nostalgic expression and murmured, "I think there used to be a fairly decent faction back then... called Slaughter... Slaughter Jun Gate?"

How could news of those minor sects from the wastelands reach the ears of these direct descendents? Thinking it over, only one came to mind, Slaughter Jun Gate. It had once gone unnoticed but now was known across the world thanks to Tu Longjian. Everyone seemed to understand the implication.

They brushed past that side topic and finally someone chuckled and asked, "So I’ve heard Daoist Master Shangyuan is attempting to break through to the Golden Core Realm. Gentlemen... have your families heard any inside news?"

Upon hearing that, Li Yuanqin's hazy eyes instantly focused. He quietly fixed his gaze on his wine cup as a member of the Chi Family spoke, "What news could there be? Even Duanmu Kui failed... what chance does Shangyuan really have?"

As soon as he said this, a man of higher status and finer clothing beside him sneered and replied softly, "Cousin, you're amusing. Shangyuan has the support of that one from Yue Cultivating Sect. What does Duanmu Kui have? Just one immortal text. He’s good in a fight, sure, but can that help him break through?"

The Chi Family member who spoke earlier clearly wasn’t aligned with him and immediately retorted, "Even an immortal once said he'd reach the Golden Core Realm. So what happened to him now?"

A chorus of voices erupted into noisy debate. Li Yuanqin stayed silent and glanced at the Ning Family members present. Their expressions were no better, each of them wore a gloomy face and drank heavily.

The reason was simple. Just a few days ago, Daoist Master Yuan Su had personally appointed Ning Heyuan as head of the family and peak master of the Immortal Peak. With Ning Heyuan receiving such authority, it was clear to the Ning Family that Daoist Master Yuan Su’s time was nearing its end.

With their own pillar faltering, none were in the mood for jokes. The Ning Family members wore somber expressions. Li Yuanqin listened quietly until the group settled on a shared question, "Where is Daoist Master Yuan Xiu now?"

With Purple Mansion elders in the sect seemingly about to fall one after another, the whereabouts of Yuan Xiu, whose condition remained unknown, suddenly became a hot topic. All eyes turned to one person in the corner.

The man had thick brows and large eyes, sitting in the corner with a cheerful smile. A member of the Chi Family spoke up, "Brother Si Honglang... Do you know anything? Let us hear it..."

Si Honglang didn’t have much talent nor any outstanding traits and usually remained unnoticed among the crowd. But now he finally had his moment and said proudly, "Our Daoist Master is skilled in longevity techniques, and he’s the youngest among the Three Primordials. He still has plenty of time!"

The crowd burst into laughter, but the leading Chi Family member suddenly fell silent as a golden figure flew toward them and landed slowly in front of the city wall. His expression was stern as his gaze swept over the group.

Most of the young nobles lost their nerve, backing away with bowed heads. Only a few Chi Family direct descendants stood their ground, cupped their hands and respectfully called out, "Greetings, General. Brother Yuanqin is here."

Li Xuanfeng immediately spotted Li Yuanqin where his face was flushed with wine and seated among the crowd. Even the bow he always carried was tossed carelessly at his feet and was lying cold on the ground. For a moment, Li Xuanfeng said nothing.

The crowd wore faintly troubled looks, they were too afraid to speak, though a subtle air of schadenfreude passed among them. Li Yuanqin stood up, picked up his bow and staggered toward his father.

Li Xuanfeng cast a cold glance at him and grabbed his collar without a word. He hoisted him up and flew swiftly back to the estate on golden spirit wind. Only after the father and son had left did soft laughter ripple through the group left behind.

Someone spoke up, "Truly a tiger of a father, but a dog of a son!"

A Chi Family direct descendant beside him smiled and said, "You fool, Li Yuanqin is no simple character. He just doesn’t see eye to eye with his father, that’s all!"

A look of great satisfaction flashed in his eyes.

Li Xuanfeng flew through the air on the wind, carrying Li Yuanqin all the way back to the estate. Only then did he let go and set him down in the courtyard. Li Yuanqin said nothing, he straightened his robes and stood quietly to the side.

Li Xuanfeng stood in silence for a moment before speaking softly, "I don’t know how you ended up like this. When I return from the Northern Sea, I’ll take you traveling... Don’t mix with that crowd anymore."

Li Yuanqin nodded, stepped back and gave a respectful farewell before leaving on his own. Li Xuanfeng remained standing a few more seconds before rising on the wind and flew toward Daoist Master Yuan Su’s cave-dwelling.

He circled past the stone statue by the entrance. Inside the cave, white mist still drifted in ethereal coils. Before Li Xuanfeng even reached the inner chamber, he heard the soft tinkling of spring water. Bowing low, he entered to find Daoist Master Yuan Su seated upright on the jade platform as always.

Yuan Su still bore the appearance of a round-faced youth in his twenties, sitting calmly in the seat of honor. When he saw Li Xuanfeng approach, he finally stood and spoke in a gentle voice, "Come with me to the Northern Sea."




# Chapter 715: The Jadeborn One

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes flickered slightly with the light of his perception technique. He couldn’t discern the youth’s true form, but upon hearing the surname Dongfang, he assumed it likely had ties to the Dragon Clan. He nodded and replied, “Fellow Daoist, are you from the Converging Sea’s Dragon Clan?”

Dongfang Heyun wore robes of blue and white, appearing refined, with a polite smile as he replied courteously, “Indeed. I was blessed by the Dragon Monarch, born of cloud and vapor, and now serve the dragons of the Eastern Sea. Thus, I was granted the surname Dongfang.”

Li Xuanfeng didn’t know what this man was up to, so he listened silently as Dongfang Heyun sat across from him and spoke gently, “What a coincidence. While patrolling near the Qunyi Strait, I once saw a young member of your clan flying through the clouds with carefreeness. He accidentally entered Dragon Clan territory, so I took action to escort him out.”

Xizhi…

In recent days at the southern border, Li Xuanfeng had only heard that Li Xizhi was out on an errand for Profound Peak Gate. He hadn’t expected him to have entered Dragon Clan territory. His eyes opened slightly as he replied, “Oh? Then it seems the younger one overstepped his bounds.”

Dongfang Heyun smiled and shook his head, speaking softly, “Yes, that did happen. He was injured by mistake. I’m here to ask how he’s recovering.”

Li Xuanfeng found it a bit unusual, and heard Dongfang Heyun continue, “If he’s mostly recovered, he’s welcome to visit the Converging Sea. I happen to have a bit of affinity with the Heavenly Glow technique.”

Li Xuanfeng couldn’t tell whether his intentions were good or ill, so he responded noncommittally. Only then did Dongfang Heyun rise, politely cup his hands and vanish into wind and rain.

This one is neither man nor dragon. But a creature born of heaven and earth. A troublesome sort. Li Xuanfeng watched his departing figure in thought, then turned his gaze to the swirling snow outside the cave and pondered, How did Li Xizhi end up in Dragon Clan territory? There’s something strange about Xizhi’s situation… I should find a chance to seek him out.

The information he received from this man was completely different from what he’d heard from the Ning Family. Sensing something amiss, he realized the child was likely scheming in secret. Not wanting to disrupt any plans, he resolved to speak with Li Xizhi personally.

Just as he was about to close his eyes and cultivate, someone nearby had been quietly watching for some time. Dressed in flowing white robes, a middle-aged man with a sword at his waist strode over quickly and smiled, “Xuanfeng! Senior is here!”

Li Xuanfeng looked closely, it was Xiao Yongling of the Xiao Family, an old friend of Li Tongya. Dressed in white, Li Xuanfeng immediately rose and said softly, “It has been a long time since I last saw you, senior.”

Xiao Yongling’s expression turned a little somber. He studied Li Xuanfeng for a moment and said softly, “Since that day at the Green Pine Grotto Heaven, I haven’t seen you again. Your killing aura has grown much heavier, Xuanfeng.”

He sat down nearby, accompanied by a young woman in violet robes who smiled sweetly and said gently, “Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak Gate. Greetings, Senior.”

Li Xuanfeng naturally knew of the Profound Peak Gate’s ties with his family and had heard the name before. He nodded slightly, and the three of them sat on the snowy peak. Kong Tingyun chuckled and said, “This Beihuan Sect is quite amusing. With all these talents of the Immortal Dao gathered from around the world, they didn’t even bother to set out tables or chairs. But they only opened this little cave and had everyone sit on the ground.”

Xiao Yongling, who seemed to have been here for a while, stroked his beard and said, “Beihuan Sect is of a very old Dao lineage. They still keep many of the old customs. They rarely leave the mountains, and they have only a few dozen disciples.”

He glanced slightly toward the figure standing on the peak and whispered, “That one is a descendant of a Golden Core Realm cultivator, from the Xie Family of the Northern Sea. Not sure which Dao lineage he cultivates but it’s rare to meet a True Monarch’s bloodline.”

Out of courtesy, Li Xuanfeng didn’t stare and saw nothing unusual about the man. Kong Tingyun, however, said with some intrigue, “I’ve heard that the Xie Family are adept in spells, they can manipulate spiritual energy, ride mist and cloud, and are masters of technique. They can even craft talismanic water to heal wounds.”

The phrase ‘talismanic water’ seemed to stir some memory in Li Xuanfeng, and he paused slightly. As they chatted on the peak, he looked north and asked softly, “Among all the immortal families with True Monarchs, aside from the Wang and Xie Families, how many others remain?”

Xiao Yongling paused, then replied, “In the ancient times, there were many. But now, those clearly still in existence are likely no more than five. The Wang and Xie Families are the most well-known.”

He hesitated briefly and then added in a low voice, “Years ago… There were also the Li and Cui Family of Longdi, the Ning State’s Li family of Daoist Master Donghua, and the Jing, Ji, Yang Family of Jiangnan. Some have declined, some were destroyed. Most have fallen silent.

“The rest, such as the Mount Tan Li Family of Wu State, the Chen Family of Jiangnan, my own Xiao Family, and the Shen Family of Jiangbei are a tier below. Known, but not prominent.”

Listening at the side, Kong Tingyun noticed Xiao Yongling pause and gently added, “If our guess is right, your esteemed family should be a remnant of a northern lineage. Formerly nobility of Wei State, and further back, likely descended from the Li Family of Longdi.”

Their reasoning was quite thorough, but Li Xuanfeng couldn’t be sure. Others might not know, but his family were originally farmers. His ancestor, Li Mutian and all who came before were mere mortals, wanderers who had drifted here.

When the rise of Lijing began, several brothers all possessed spiritual orifices, but these were granted through talismans. The outstanding talents of the later generations were likewise due to the presence of talismanic seeds and the support of immortal arts. Without these, their cultivation would have been as slow as that of ordinary people. They were by no means descendants of immortal families.

Although Yuan Su calculated that his bloodline was from Wei State, Li Xuanfeng felt that, at best, it might be from a collateral branch of a collateral branch. The Wei State Li Family had ruled for a thousand years, expanding from a few counties to dominate the north. No one could say how many descendants they’d produced.

Only Li Zhouwei stirred a hint of suspicion in Li Xuanfeng’s mind, something about him felt strange, If that’s truly the case, why is there not a single word of it? How could the line fall to generations of mere mortals…

He dared not think further. These thoughts filled his mind in just a couple of seconds. He couldn’t bring himself to acknowledge it, and simply muttered, “Just rumors and hearsay. If our family were truly descendants of Wei State, how could we have fallen to such a state?”

Kong Tingyun misunderstood his meaning. She exchanged a glance with Xiao Yongling, they both seemed to understand something deeper, she said, “Though so many years have passed, plenty of old enemies remain. The name of the Wei State Li Family may be glorious, but it brings plenty of trouble too.”

That said, Kong Tingyun couldn’t help but feel some envy. As long as the Li Family grew strong enough, the legacy of the Wei State Li Family would still be there, possibly traceable to ancient times. It wasn’t just a name, it was something that flowed in the blood.

Her own Kong family had produced only one Daoist Master and that was Daoist Master Changxi. Further up the lineage were merely rogue cultivators of the Yue State. They were ancestors who had once been mere county magistrates under the shadow of the powerful Yuan Family…

Xiao Yongling watched the two as their expressions shifted, forming a few guesses. He gently advised, “Rise and fall are part of the world, they are often unexpected. Don’t overthink it. Back then, everyone thought the Yuan Family was untouchable… who would’ve imagined today? Or that from a tiny village, a Li family would emerge with four generations and eight Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators? Even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators can’t fully divine such a thing!”

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly, and Kong Tingyun responded with a bright smile, secretly amused, Didn’t your Man on Creek already divine that? Leaving everyone stunned.

The three soon fell into silence, each adjusting their breath in quiet meditation.

Time passed swiftly as the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators cultivated beneath alternating light and shadow. Nearly half a month passed, and still there was no sign of Yuan Su. The three days he had promised stretched longer and longer.

Not until the twenty-third day did multicolored lights finally appear again, streaked with the blackness of the great void. From the sky descended an old man carrying a fishing rod on his shoulder. Beside him stood a middle-aged man with a stern demeanor and a thumb-sized glowing jade embedded in his chest.

“Greetings to the two Daoist Masters!”

Li Xuanfeng had met Xiao Chuting before. Back then, he was just a lowly Qi Cultivation Realm disciple, while Xiao Chuting had likely pretended to be Foundation Establishment Realm, collecting offerings atop the peak. His appearance hadn’t changed much, though now he seemed even more transcendent.

As for the other man, Li Xuanfeng could only guess, but he was likely the famed Daoist Master Changxi. His appearance was somewhat different than expected. Xiao Yongling and Kong Tingyun both took their leave and flew off into the clouds.

Li Xuanfeng gave a respectful salute. Both Xiao Chuting and Daoist Master Changxi seemed rather cordial. Li Xuanfeng thought Xiao Chuting hadn’t changed much from before but Xiao Chuting looked at him with completely different eyes. The once-innocent boy Li Xuanfeng, had grown into a hardened and unyielding veteran.

Xiao Chuting nodded and said in his hoarse voice, “Xuanfeng, wait here a moment.”

The four vanished swiftly. Li Xuanfeng turned to look, snowflakes drifted across the peak and only Xie Zhanchang remained. His hands were forming seals and he was seated cross-legged in meditation. In one shadowy corner, a dark figure sat quietly in the snow.

Li Xuanfeng looked closer. The man’s face was pale and grim, his robes a mix of gold and black. It was an all-too-familiar attire.

Someone from the Golden Tang Gate…, thought Li Xuanfeng.

This man was indeed from Golden Tang Gate. Li Xuanfeng didn’t recognize him by face, but the robes were unmistakable. After all, he had once slain the Golden Tang Gate’s young master ruthlessly, with blade after blade. There was no way he’d mistake their emblem.

Seeing this scene, realization struck him instantly, So the Situ Family’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, who’d been hiding for so long was still caught by Yuan Su in the end.

He sat cross-legged for another three days. At last, Yuan Su emerged from the void, his face slightly pale, halting midair. One of his hand tucked behind his back, the other holding a severed arm.

Yuan Su’s aura fluctuated, and the sound of bubbling spring water resonated clearly. His brows were tightly furrowed and his expression was faintly grim. The peak was almost deserted. He took Li Xuanfeng up into the clouds again and continued northward.

After ten or so seconds of silence, Yuan Su finally spoke in a cold tone, “That old bastard could’ve hidden wherever he wanted… but to show up in the Northern Sea? I’ll let him off with just one arm as a lesson.”

Hearing this, Li Xuanfeng understood why the Situ Family’s Purple Mansion Realm had gone missing all these years. They were waiting for Yuan Su’s lifespan to run out, trying to drag him down with them.

Yuan Su’s strength is indeed impressive. The Situ Family had no choice but to run for their lives, thought Li Xuanfeng.

The severed arm was sealed with mana, yet it still trembled faintly. Yuan Su raised it and said in a low voice, “Situ Huo, listen well. If you’ve got the guts, stay in the Southern Sea forever. Pu Yu and Yuming are looking for you too. Don’t get careless and come crawling back.”

After saying this, he broke off one of the fingers and tossed it into the sea, letting it find Situ Huo on its own. Only then did he stow away the arm. The sky above had already filled with starlight.

Without another word, he continued flying upward with Li Xuanfeng. The north wind grew increasingly fierce. It was strong enough to knock ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators out of the sky. The mountains below, streaked with black and white, looked solemn and austere.

They finally reached the highest ice plain. At its center was a small lake. Several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stood silently on the clouds. Upon the icy platform in the lake sat a lone figure in quiet meditation, a wooden sword hanging at the figure’s waist.

Standing on the cloud, Li Xuanfeng felt the fierce, biting wind halted just beyond the cloud barrier. After a few seconds, he suddenly heard a faint rustling. A soft, fragmentary clattering sound.

Because Yuan Su’s cloud aura blocked his spiritual sense, he couldn’t probe outward. He could only look around and noticed that amidst the falling snow were countless tiny white fragments. Each one striking the ground with a faint cracking sound.

Yuan Su, now much calmer, reached out his hand and caught a handful of snowflakes. With a gentle shake, he revealed specks of fine, white jade dust among them.

“It’s begun.”

Li Xuanfeng understood immediately. Sure enough, atop the platform, Shangyuan opened his eyes, scanned the surroundings one by one, and spoke, “I am Shangyuan. Today I attempt to break through to the Golden Core Realm. In accordance with the pact among the immortal cultivators of the Four Nations and Seas, I’ve invited you all to witness. Observe closely, there may be benefits to gain.”

He spoke calmly. In contrast to the trembling silence when Duanmu Kui spoke, or the mockery when facing Chi Wei, the assembled cultivators all nodded in return. Even those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who disliked his temperament now reluctantly returned the greeting.

Mist still shrouded Shangyuan’s face, his wooden sword swaying at his side. He looked off into the distance as two faint figures slowly appeared. Smiling faintly, he clasped his hands and said, “Fellow Daoists, one moment.”
𝐟𝕣𝕖𝐞𝐰𝕖𝚋𝐧𝗼𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝗰𝐨𝐦

The two blurry figures had seemingly been waiting for a long time and dared not delay. One of them, with a sharp voice, quickly said, “No need for such formality! If your breakthrough succeeds, we hope you’ll remember to guide us in turn!”

Shangyuan let out a brief laugh and began to rise into the air. No spell was cast, he merely pressed his hand lightly upon the sword at his waist.

In that instant, countless spiritual swords among the gathered cultivators began to tremble violently. Some slipped from their owners’ control, ringing out in unison with the urge to draw themselves. It was an awe-inspiring sight.

All the cultivators in the sky had been watching his every move. Almost simultaneously, the majority of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stepped back cautiously and assumed defensive postures. Only a few, Yuan Su among them, stood unmoved.

Li Xuanfeng looked up and saw a mocking smile on Yuan Su’s face, as if this display was very much to his taste. He stood with arms crossed, perfectly relaxed.

Under the veil of mist, a trace of amusement played across Shangyuan’s face. He released his grip on the sword, and the others found themselves left standing awkwardly midair. They were embarrassed in front of their juniors. Yet none dared to speak. At most, their faces darkened slightly, though most didn’t even dare show that much.

Shangyuan paid them no mind. He gently exhaled a breath of white mist.

The mist rose and twisted in the air, forming strange and marvelous visions. White-robed men, jade cliffs, cascading silks like waterfalls and even a great white jade disk rose into the sky.

Billows of white mist surged and spread. Within the clouds, endless scenes manifested. Beneath the glow of the jade disk, zithers and flutes played, white-robed men wielded spears and swords in dance, strange beasts ran across crescent moons and waterfall-like silk unfurled in the sky, flowing all the way down into the lake.

Amidst the many celestial visions, steps of white jade appeared beneath Daoist Master Shangyuan’s feet. Clad in his immortal blade, he ascended them with ease and composure.

With each step, surging waves of white mist erupted. The wooden sword at his waist began to glow with its grain turning to luminous jade. Shangyuan said softly, “The Jadeborn One.”

As the words left his lips, a radiant, elegant white feathered robe formed over him. Long strands of mist trailed from his sleeves like silk. Normally dressed simply, Shangyuan now looked like a being from the heavens.

Li Xuanfeng found it oddly familiar. He had read the Aged Courtly Path Scripture, and this feathered robe matched the descriptions there. Although it was far more mystical than he’d ever imagined. He thought to himself, This must be the Jade Court General form… perhaps a higher version of the immortal text or the ancient name of the Immortal Foundation…




# Chapter 717: Jade True Unified Void

Daoist Master Shangyuan ascended the long staircase of clouds with unhurried steps. With each footfall, celestial music rang out and conch shells echoed loudly. The cloudmist on both sides transformed into immortals boys and girls. They carried baskets of flowers, scattering white jade petals like snow, trailing mist as they gently descended to the earth.

Each illusory maiden bore a unique grace that was exquisitely lifelike. Their garments were perfectly coordinated, as if they were living beings. One or two even looked up with curiosity, gazing toward the gathered Purple Mansion Realm cultivators above.

The white mist spread farther and wider in the sky. Pavilions and towers emerged within it, encircling Daoist Master Shangyuan. Nearby, a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators watched with puzzled expressions and whispered quietly,n “What is this... no sign of water, fire, or the five elements, no convergence of qi, just white mist? Who breaks through like this...”

“They say it’s the path of illusion and reality...”

While the two whispered to each other, Yuan Su beside Li Xuanfeng also frowned. His expression grew wary, eyes narrowing as he stared into the mist. White jade petals drifted past and released faint mist as they fell into the lake below.

Daoist Master Yuan Su paused for a moment and murmured, “It truly is the Jade True Unified Void... I can’t believe Taiyue possessed such an immortal technique.”

Expressions among the crowd shifted subtly. Yet Shangyuan continued his steady ascent into the clouds. As he climbed higher, the surroundings churned violently. The white mist that was bright and dim, surged toward him from every direction.

Daoist Master Shangyuan spoke softly, “Green Jade Cliff.”

The moment he spoke, the wind and snow of the world suddenly stopped.

In the Northern Sea, where snow storms had raged for a thousand years, all fell silent for several seconds. Then, from the endless range of snowy peaks, large and small white pearls began to fall with a clatter, striking the earth in a downpour.

These white beads rolled and bounced with crisp sounds. Some broke thin layers of ice and sank into the lake, others rolled down the mountain slopes with a rushing clatter, and still others piled up in hollowed-out places.

The snow beneath his feet shifted from pure white to a soft blend of white and pale green, glowing faintly beneath the moonlight. Shangyuan exhaled slightly and intoned, “Patterned Brocade.”

In an instant, the falling beads transformed. The beads stretched and twisted into countless threads of white brocade that were dense and delicate. They drifted like cotton, blanketing the sky and blinding the view. Even a distance of one and a half meters became a vague, misty white.

The Dao lineage of the Jiang Family... Fei Wangbai’s Dao foundation...

Li Xuanfeng pushed his perception technique to the absolute limit, barely managing to make out a vague silhouette. Behind Shangyuan, a long robe had taken form, its silver-white patterns fluttering softly in the wind.

A gentle voice reached his ears, Shangyuan’s tone was light and contented, as if everything was unfolding with effortless ease, “White Jade Disk.”

Li Xuanfeng had heard of this Dao foundation before. Yu Yuxie in his day had cultivated it, but it required Supreme Yin Moonlight and Gao White Jade Essence, and the tradition had long been lost. As expected, it belonged to the Jade True Dao.

At that moment, the moon and stars in the sky dimmed completely, nearly blending into the night. In their place rose a brilliant and dazzling jade disk.

The moment the jade disk rose, the falling jade pearls and silk-like rain in the sky ceased. Daoist Master Shangyuan sat cross-legged in the air with the gleaming jade disk behind him. He was like an immortal or buddha reborn. The mist concealing his face finally dispersed.

His features were handsome, brows long and gentle. But now his eyes glowed pure white, staring unwaveringly into the heavens above.

He slowly turned his head, and white breath streamed endlessly from between his lips and teeth. Like waterfalls, the mist flowed from his hair and vanished into the air.

Yuan Su watched in silence, realization dawned in his gaze. Beside him on the clouds appeared the blue-and-white robed figure of Daoist Master Pu Yu. Pu Yu was full of astonishment as he said, “Marvelous... to think such a path exists! Incredible! This immortal art of Daoist Master Shangyuan’s could raise everyone’s chance of breaking through by at least half!

“If the ancient ways no longer apply, then one must seek their own nature. There’s no need to cling to the five elements or the twelve immortal qi. Those who seek clarity, seek clarity. Those who seek illusion, seek illusion...”

Daoist Master Pu Yu’s eyes gleamed, thoughts racing. He glanced at Li Xuanfeng beside him and murmured in praise, “He is just about to fuse his divine ability hence the signs of his immortal body’s fragmentation. A true genius... this immortal art must have been crafted precisely for the Jade True Dao. Such perfect resonance!”

On the other hand, Shangyuan did not pause. Word by word, he intoned, “True Dao Unification!”

In an instant, radiant white light surged. The cloudmist churned and rushed inward, converging around the bright jade disk behind Shangyuan, forming a vast white lake. At its heart, a luminous point of light began to take shape.

The gathered Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stared in awe at the divine light, but Daoist Master Pu Yu’s gaze passed over it and focused instead on Shangyuan himself. He secretly calculated and faint traces of blood began to rise on his fingertips.

Shangyuan subtly formed a hand seal, and streams of divine white light surged forward, striking the growing divine glow.

Above the divine light, a phantom shard of white jade emerged, slowly materializing. As it condensed, it became more solid. Then, it gradually began to fade into illusion again.

Shangyuan’s pale face regained color quickly. His eyes remained shut but glowed faintly like jade. His hands flickered between illusion and substance, and the white glow behind him surged and dimmed, struggling violently.

Jade rain began to fall once more from the sky. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators fell into silence. Some watched in envy, others in jealousy, and still others in deep unease. They were staring intently at Shangyuan.

Li Xuanfeng turned slightly. Yuan Su’s expression was filled with awe and envy as he remained stunned for over ten seconds, speechless. Beside him, Daoist Master Pu Yu stood silent, his eyes lowered, saying nothing.

Li Xuanfeng waited for a few seconds. Daoist Master Pu Yu glanced his way, then subtly pointed downward.

Li Xuanfeng looked down and saw a sea of pale green and white. Ice and stone had turned to jade and snow had become brocade. The entire Northern Sea ice peak had been utterly transformed into a Green Jade Cliff from top to bottom.

All the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators remained in an eerie silence. It wasn’t until every trace of radiance faded from Shangyuan, his form returning to that of a simple white-robed cultivator, his sword reverting to plain wood, that the silence began to stir.

He opened his eyes. He gave off a pure white aura. His body radiated a soft white glow.

The stars and moon dimmed. Shangyuan’s lips moved gently and his voice echoed from the great void into the present world, carrying far and wide, “I, Shangyuan, today in the Northern Sea have proven the Dao and attained the Jade True Unified Void Essence. I ascend to the rank of True Monarch. The foundation of jade across the world is now established. It may serve as array, as pill, as exalted immortal law, as talisman, as seal and as the cornerstone of the Jade True lineage...
𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝘦𝘣𝘯ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝑚

“From the earth’s veins, jade shall emerge. The Jade True Dao may manifest in spirit items, spirit plants and spirit beasts. My Dao shall prosper. I leave behind a Sword Mansion and Jade Cliff as legacy for future generations.”

His voice reverberated, mingling with the soft tinkling of countless jade fragments. No matter what relationship each Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had with him. No matter friendship or enmity, envy or admiration, they now bowed in unison and said, “Congratulations, True Monarch Shangyuan!”

“We pay respects to the True Monarch of the Jade True Unified Void Essence.”

Daoist Master Pu Yu, filled with emotion, turned slightly to Yuan Su and said, “True Monarch Shangyuan... this is a proclamation of immortal achievement. A decree, as in the ancient immortal arts...”

Yuan Su gave a slight nod, lost in thought. Daoist Master Pu Yu sighed softly and muttered, “It’s time to go. With this breakthrough, many things have now been decided... Within the mainland and across the outer seas, who knows how many cultivators will now be tempted to attempt their own ascension.”

Yuan Su remained silent. He bowed quietly toward Shangyuan, then stood gazing blankly at the lingering mist.

Shangyuan tilted his head slightly, as if listening. Before him, something neither solid nor illusory faintly emerged.

It resembled many things, a robe draped over his shoulders, a stone cradled in his palm, or even a void. Shangyuan lifted his eyes and stared straight into the empty sky.

The clouds beside him parted, and two indistinct figures slowly materialized. One of them spoke, “Congratulations, Exalted Immortal.”

The second figure likewise bowed with utmost decorum, then withdrew a golden scroll from his sleeve. With a gentle flick of his arm, the scroll unfurled.

The two held the scroll between them, presenting it to True Monarch Shangyuan. The one on the left produced a writing brush from his sleeve and said respectfully, “Exalted Immortal, having transcended the mortal realm, we humbly request you erase your name yourself. We dare not commit such sacrilege.”

True Monarch Shangyuan slightly shook his head and remained motionless. The two envoys exchanged uncertain glances, unsure what to do, when Shangyuan said calmly, “I am not listed in the registry. You needn’t search.”

The two underworld officials looked at each other again, then put away the brush and rolled up the golden scroll. Only then did Shangyuan wave a hand and say, “Leave quickly. If battle breaks out, you two may be harmed.”

“Many thanks for the True Monarch’s compassion. We take our leave.”

Nodding repeatedly, as if granted amnesty, the two officials bowed deeply and vanished into a gust of ghostly wind, dissipating swiftly from heaven and earth.

Shangyuan slowly stood up. The white radiance behind him retracted into his body. He pressed his hand on the sharp green sword at his waist and said coldly, “Fellow Daoists. There’s no need to wait any longer!”

At those words, all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the sky bowed their heads in unison. None dared to move or speak. Li Xuanfeng suddenly felt his entire vision fill with deep blue-green. The entire world seemed to have shifted.

“The sky... is gone...”

The sun, moon, stars, and night sky had all vanished. In their place was a vast and endless ocean of jade-colored water. It stretched from east to west and was suspended overhead. Looking up, he could still see speckled island reefs floating above.

“This is... this is...”

The sea above mirrored the snow-peaked jade mountains beneath his feet and the Northern Sea far below. Heaven and earth were now both ocean, the boundaries of up and down completely blurred.

The endless jade sea above shimmered and closed in silently. Li Xuanfeng’s eyes throbbed in pain, golden stars flashing before his vision. He dared not look any longer. Yuan Su had already grabbed his armor and forcibly turned his head aside, facing his own.

Ning Tiaoxiao’s right eye socket was completely hollow, with emerald-green seawater pouring from it. His left eye was also sagging, half-melted, dissolving into a pale blue mass. His entire face looked as though it had been splashed with water. Liquid green flowed down in streaks.

Li Xuanfeng’s vision went dark. He barely saw a blazing comet-like star fall into the ocean and then something massive, vast beyond comprehension, like a titanic body, slithering from the sea above to the depths below. Its inky-black scales shimmered as it moved.

There was only silence in his ears. He heard nothing. The world seemed frozen in time, it was utterly still. And before him, Ning Tiaoxiao’s lips moved slowly, saying, “Pristine Water.”

Eastern Sea. Xia Mountain.

Xia Mountain, a sea mountain north of the Converging Sea. It served as a resting point for the Heavenly Glow of the Eastern Sea. Those that rose from the Northwest or Northeast would always pause here before continuing along the celestial firmament.

Sometimes, this pause lasted just a few seconds but other times, it continued for several hours. The glow from the Northwest usually flowed toward Qunyi, while that from the Northeast drifted back to the Great Western Plains of Wu State.

Being in the Converging Sea, this was naturally Dragon Clan territory. For ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, coming here was certain death. But Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were welcomed to gather glow , and the dragons would treat them with great hospitality.

As the Heavenly Glow rose, a young man flew in atop it. He was refined and dignified, with sharp brows and bright eyes. In his hand, he carried a gourd.

He landed lightly on the peak and checked the time with a frown of puzzlement. At that moment, a woman flew in on the wind, cradling a swirl of multicolored radiance in her hands. Her arched brows curved gently as she asked, “My husband, what’s wrong?”

These were, of course, the couple Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao’er. Li Xizhi was recovering and harvesting glow here, and Yang Xiao’er had come across the entire Eastern Sea to find him. She had only arrived the night before, with the help of escorts from the Yang Family. Without them, the journey would’ve been extremely perilous.

Li Xizhi was currently observing the glow. On paper, he was collecting it for Daoist Master Changxi, and he intended to perform this duty properly. After some mental calculation, he muttered, “How strange... Something must have happened in the Northern Sea. Not a single streak of Heavenly Glow has passed through. Could it be that a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator fell, disrupting the heavens?”

He calculated a little further and said, “And yet there’s no celestial anomaly in the Northwest... How can no Heavenly Glow pass through?”

Yang Xiao’er understood at once and said softly, “Husband, you’ve been secluded here. You may not know but in recent days, Daoist Master Shangyuan was to undergo his breakthrough in the Northern Sea. It must have been him... unintentionally halting the Heavenly Glow.”

Li Xizhi’s brow furrowed with worry. But since no glow was coming, he had time. He took Yang Xiao’er with him and flew down to their cave residence.

This dwelling, prepared by the Dragon Clan, was spacious. He shut the stone door tightly and asked quietly, “You came so suddenly yesterday, I didn’t have time to ask. This place is secure. We finally have a moment.”

Li Xizhi reached into his storage pouch and retrieved the feathered robe. It was tattered and torn, with a deep blue palm print scorched into the back. Yang Xiao’er’s expression turned panicked at the sight. She cried, “What happened to it?!”

Having missed her husband dearly after hearing he was at Xia Mountain, Yang Xiao’er had rushed over on the wind. She’d been puzzled when she saw he hadn’t worn the feathered robe she gave him but now, upon seeing it, her heart filled with dread.

“What happened?!” she asked.

Li Xizhi explained the situation in general terms, then asked softly, “This feathered robe of yours... it’s only at Qi Cultivation Realm, yet it held a golden light as a final defense...”

Hearing that, Yang Xiao’er first carefully made sure his injuries were no longer serious. Only then did she purse her lips and huff, “Oh, that’s all?”

She chuckled and said, “I had two feathered robes. One from the main Yang Family line, the other part of my dowry. I was worried, with you running around outside and so many enemies watching... so I made sure to prepare for that.”

Li Xizhi, quick-witted as always, immediately understood. He said gently, “So... you swapped the robes.”

“Of course I did. I’m not out there fighting for my life, no one would dare lay a hand on me anyway.” Yang Xiao’er gave a light, proud smile and said, “So the one you were wearing is the Yang Family heirloom robe... and the one I’m wearing now is the one from my dowry!”




# Chapter 719: When Heaven Leaks, The Sea Rises

Li Xizhi was suddenly moved. He opened his mouth slightly, then simply pulled her into his arms and spoke gently, "Xiao'er, if it weren't for you, I would have perished in that sea long ago..."

His gentle words made Yang Xiao'er smile sweetly. She wrapped her slender hands around his neck, nestled into his embrace and whispered softly, "Don’t say that... please don’t blame us for not sending word to warn you... After all, those at the Purple Mansion Realm had just suffered a loss, and several brothers were reassigned..."

Li Xizhi shook his head and hurriedly instructed, "This matter is most likely the doing of the Chi Family. It must not be revealed. Act as if it never happened, I only used an excuse to come to this Xia Mountain..."

He explained the events in detail, leaving out what was in his qihai. Yang Xiao'er, clever as she was, understood and said with a nod, "Alright, I understand."

As the two spoke in detail for a while, they suddenly felt the mountains beneath their feet begin to tremble. White mist rose into the sky, blanketing the clouds and transforming into various illusions.

White petals, trailing smoke, drifted down, making the sound of jade pearls colliding. A cold and calm voice echoed, as if emerging from the void. It was neither loud nor soft, just perfectly clear beside the ear.

"I am Shangyuan. Today in the Northern Sea, I have attained the Dao and achieved the Jade True Unified Void Essence, ascending to the rank of True Monarch..."

Though the voice was not forceful, it made both of them rise with shock on their faces. The couple exchanged glances and quickly bowed, "Congratulations to True Monarch Shangyuan, the Jade True Unified Void Essence True Monarch..."

As the two offered congratulations from afar, a scene of bowed figures offering blessings spread across heaven and earth. Not only were all manner of people and demonic creatures on Xia Mountain solemnly saluting, but cultivators across the mainland and the four seas also looked up, respectfully sending their congratulations.

He has truly become a True Monarch... Li Xizhi sighed lightly, filled with emotion. The Heavenly Glow in his hand rose, still carrying disbelief. When he looked back at Yang Xiao'er, she too wore a shocked expression.

Over the years, many true cultivators had attempted to break through to the Golden Core Realm. Chi Wei and Duanmu Kui of Yue State were prime examples. Even in Wu State and the outer seas, both humans and demonic creatures had tried, but none had succeeded.

Even Dongfang You, a descendant of the Dragon Monarch, with terrifyingly deep reserves, failed in his breakthrough and burst into black clouds.

Though Shangyuan had long been regarded as the foremost of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and drew the most spectators to his ceremonies in recent years. So many before him had held that same title, yet he alone truly broke through in the end, which was still astonishing.

Li Xizhi, a disciple of Azure Pond Sect’s Immortal Peak, now on the verge of becoming its peak master, had some understanding of the Purple Mansion Realm and the Golden Core Realm.

The Golden Core Dao refined the Metallic Essence, and those who gained Fruition Attainment were remarkable beings. Writing carelessly about them could have offended a True Monarch, so there were no detailed records within the sect. Most knowledge was hearsay.

Once one achieved the Golden Core Realm, the Metallic Essence would remain in the world and the physical body would last a thousand years. The spirit would persist through reincarnation and be nearly indestructible. Each Golden Core corresponded to a Fruition Attainment of heaven and earth, and occupying that position granted powers akin to immortals.

In his heart, he thought silently, I've heard that the Jade True Fruition Attainment has long been vacant. Doesn't this mean that True Monarch Shangyuan, having broken through, can now ascend to that position and become the Master of Jade True...

Daoist Master Shangyuan has always hated evil with a burning passion. How could the northern Buddhist cultivators tolerate him... Of the Seven Daos, Wrath has already fallen, and at least three of the remaining six daos harbor deep hatred for him...

Li Xizhi looked northward and saw a bright, dazzling comet falling from the sky. It streaked along the heavens toward the north and plunged into the Northern Sea.

As soon as the comet fell, the Taibai Star began to flicker. It looked like an eye that was blinking rapidly. Emerald light streamed across the sky, it was intense and turbulent.

Li Xizhi's eyes grew blurry, as if he were in a half-dream, unable to tell what exactly he was seeing. Until the talisman seed in his qihai flickered, sending a wave of clarity into his mind. Only then did he gradually come back to his senses.

A Golden Core battle spell!

With the aid of this clarity, he could faintly make out the distant scene. After a few breaths, the stars in the sky reversed their motion, and another star lit up blindingly, blooming with red-tinged white light.

Li Xizhi studied it closely as he had never seen this star before. Looking at its sector of the sky, he saw three subsidiary stars trailing behind it, though only one was lit.

One of the three...

Thanks to the talisman seed within him, he was not overwhelmed by the distant might. He quickly took mental notes and saw a massive figure flicker into view in the distance. It appeared to have six arms and was holding a lotus-shaped dharma artifact.

Could it be a Buddhist cultivator...

But the figure only flashed for an instant, then emerald light flared, the comet fell and the red-white star blazed. The brown light streamed, the six-armed figure instantly deflated and exploded into a sky full of golden essence.

The comet's light was extremely intense, as if in a furious rage, it even wiped clean all the scattered golden essence in the sky. Lights twisted and tangled, shaking the very mountain beneath their feet.

Seeing this, even with the clarity preserving his awareness, Li Xizhi's eyes stung with tears. He feared that looking any further would damage his perception technique and he had to lower his gaze.

He wiped his tears and took a brief rest, but the sky dimmed. In the north, a pitch-black hue appeared, and meteors streaked across the heavens, trailing flames as they shot southward.

Beside him, Yang Xiao'er tugged at him with some concern. Suddenly, they heard the sea roar. The waves parted sharply and from within rose a massive creature, a white-gray scaled beast.

The beast had four strong limbs, each stepping on a cloud. Its waist and belly were long, and its tail was covered in densely packed scales the size of tabletops. It sped through the mist, letting out a long, echoing howl.

Li Xizhi quickly bowed his head and said quietly, "Greetings, great demonic beast..."

The scaled beast circled in the air, gazed carefully toward the north, then rode the clouds swiftly in that direction.

Li Xizhi looked north with concern. Beside him, Yang Xiao'er watched the great demonic beast of the Purple Mansion Realm depart and said softly, "Husband, something major is happening... I fear the True Monarch Shangyuan has started fighting the Buddhist sects."

Li Xizhi had already expected this after what he saw, but could not explain much to his wife. He merely shook his head in silence and watched as the meteors rained down, falling across the mainland and the four seas.

He stepped forward hesitantly. The couple rode the wind down from Xia Mountain, approaching the water's surface which reflected countless rays of Heavenly Glow. Li Xizhi wore a solemn expression, while Yang Xiao'er looked startled, "Huh?"

Xia Mountain was a columnar peak rising from the seabed, with smooth and delicate cliffs covered in iridescent layers of Heavenly Glow. It was exceptionally beautiful. She flew all the way to the point where the mountain met the sea and saw a swiftly descending waterline along the cliff face. In a serious tone, she said, "Husband... the waters of the Eastern Sea are receding..."

Indeed, the highest tide mark on the cliff wall and the current waterline differed by an inch. Li Xizhi examined it closely and said with a grave expression, "No wonder the great demonic beast was alarmed. The Converging Sea is the most stable region of the Eastern Sea, and Xia Mountain is a wonder of heaven and earth. Under normal conditions, the sea level never fluctuates more than a finger's breadth. If even the Converging Sea is like this, one can imagine the state of the other seas!"

Yang Xiao'er pressed her lips together and asked, "Then what should we do now..."
𝘧𝘳𝘦ℯ𝓌𝘦𝒷𝘯𝑜𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸𝘰𝓂

"Xia Mountain is the safest place," said Li Xizhi. Then, he flew back to the mountain with her, worrying in his heart, I wonder how things are back home...

Coincidentally, Yang Xiao'er beside him also looked concerned. She thought, The ancestor broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, yet just so happened to encounter such heavenly changes... who knows if it affected him!

Northern Sea.

When Li Xuanfeng woke, the sky was dim. He opened his eyes and looked toward the horizon where the stars and moon still hung properly in the sky. The once-blue havenly sea had vanished and the comet was nowhere to be seen.

Everything that had manifested faded into nothingness, leaving only the distant north where dark shadows of various sizes lingered between the stars. The moonlight and starlight had both dimmed.

Li Xuanfeng slowly raised his arm. Most of his golden armor had turned a brilliant white, glowing intensely. The iron hooks that once connected the armor plates had all solidified, rendering most of his body immobile.

He struggled twice and sat up. A quiet voice drifted from beside him, "The Golden Supreme Origin Green Core True Monarch of the Golden Feather Sect made a move. Your cultivation and armor were affected. The armor, originally made of Black-Hook Profound Gold, has mostly transformed into White-Bore Origin Gold, it needs to be reforged."

It's Yuan Su. Li Xuanfeng recognized the voice and turned his head in response. Yuan Su was quietly sitting beside him. The earlier image of a face streaming with blue tears seemed like an illusion. He now looked clean and calm, his round face relaxed.

Yuan Su noticed his expression and said with a smile, "Just now, when the True Monarch struck suddenly, I lost control of my emotions for a moment. I felt a flash of hatred and was nearly consumed by the backlash of the Metallic Essence. I almost turned into cave spring water."

Though Yuan Su said this lightly, given that he had reached the end of his lifespan, he clearly didn’t care much for his own life. Li Xuanfeng responded with lowered eyes and noticed that the reef beneath Yuan Su’s white robe had turned jade-green.

Li Xuanfeng responded respectfully and asked softly, "May I ask, Daoist Master, have the True Monarchs decided the outcome yet?"

"Not yet." Yuan Su propped his chin with one hand and said softly, "How could it be settled so quickly? Only a few of the True Monarchs showed glimpses of their power and clashed briefly in the Northern Sea."

He pointed toward a patch of darkness in the northern sky, signaling Li Xuanfeng to take a look. Li Xuanfeng squinted and saw the black voids of various sizes scattered among the stars which he had already found strange earlier.

Yuan Su said in a low voice, "The True Monarchs fought for several days and punched holes in the sky above the Northern Sea. They've ascended to the Outer Heavens now.

"I couldn't see too clearly, but during about half an hour of battle, a northern Buddhist cultivator, perhaps a Dharma Master, made a move. He received a sword strike from True Monarch Taiyue and fled in disgrace."

After hearing this, and seeing Yuan Su in such a talkative, relaxed mood, Li Xuanfeng quietly asked, "True Monarch Taiyue is that powerful?"

"Hmm?" Yuan Su laughed and replied softly, "There's no comparison. The Immortal and Demon Daos have produced multiple Dao Embryos. In the Primordial Era, Dao Embryos led the battles. The Buddhist cultivators only have a few Revered Ones, and though they've claimed the North and remain untouchable in their sacred lands, if they step outside to provoke others, the outcome becomes uncertain.

"Besides..." He paused, quietly gazing at the black void in the distant sky, then answered, "In the end, this is a private matter between the Green Pine Dao lineage and the Immortal Mansion’s decree. Though the lineage has now scattered, they once worked together. Only Dragon Monarch Xiyang came because of an old karmic tie. How could Buddhist cultivators have any right to meddle?"

After he said this, Li Xuanfeng noticed that in just the time it took for one incense stick to burn, the waterline on the reef had already risen by two inches. Yuan Su smiled and said, "The waters of the Four Seas fell into the Earth Abyss and then rose again. With holes torn open in the sky canopy, seawater began falling early. Those celestial voids continue to pour water down, filling the Northern Sea.

"At present, the surface of the Northern Sea is still rising, while the other three seas are gradually receding."

Li Xuanfeng squinted as he listened. Though he had time and again magnified his understanding of Golden Core Realm’s power, he was still shaken by the might of the True Monarchs. In a hoarse voice, he said, "They can truly change heaven and earth."

Yuan Su seemed in high spirits, smiling as he said:, "Don't underestimate it. In several great wars between immortals and demonic creatures, the mainland was reduced to barely one-tenth of its former self and more than half of the outer seas vanished. How vast heaven and earth once were!"

Yuan Su paused for a moment, then said quietly, "I am about to enter final repose. Pu Yu saw it long ago, but couldn't bring himself to say it directly in front of me, so he made excuses... Judging by the time, it should be soon.

"Li Xuanfeng, I didn’t bring much this time. I only intended to slap Situ Huo a few times, so I brought the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal."

He removed a small, pale gold seal from his waist and placed it into Li Xuanfeng's frozen left hand. He said with a smile, "This seal was gifted to me by Li Jiangqun. Chi Wei was jealous for quite a while. Back then, the few of us were carefree. Chi Wei would say anything. He claimed the seal had good flair, drew plenty of attention and that it was his favorite."

Li Xuanfeng saw tears fall from him, dripping onto the reef with a crisp tick-tick sound. Ning Tiaoxiao continued, "Thinking back on it, Xiao Xianyou, Zhang Qiushui, Chi Wei, Zipei... they were all drawn into the game. At first, we thought it was camaraderie. But in the end, it was the Golden Cores scheming. Only in this way could it all happen without a trace. But one must not hate."

A faint sound of a flute came from Yuan Su, echoing gently through the air. He leaned close to Li Xuanfeng and whispered in his ear, "You must not hate, Li Xuanfeng."

After saying this, Yuan Su slowly lowered his eyelids and closed his eyes as if drifting into slumber.

Li Xuanfeng lowered his gaze, looking at the hem of Yuan Su’s robe. The flute music in the sky grew louder and louder. Before him, Yuan Su transformed into a pool of clear water and vanished. Beneath the reef, the waters of the Northern Sea let out a mournful wail and the ground underfoot rumbled violently.

The entire reef began to rise rapidly. The place where Yuan Su had entered repose sank inward, becoming a pitch-black pit. After a dozen breaths, a burst of bluish-green spring water surged forth.

The spring gushed high into the air, then poured back down like rain. Mist filled the air, spreading with the sea breeze, until a bluish-green fog blanketed a hundred-mile radius.

Li Xuanfeng removed his armor and stored it in his storage pouch. He raised his brows and looked upward, seeing five or six figures gathered in the sky. They were men and women, young and old. All of them stood upon radiant divine lights, each of a different hue.

He vaguely recognized Xiao Chuting and Daoist Master Pu Yu, both bowing their heads solemnly. Another person had a mature face, stiff and unreadable, but wore the uniform of the Azure Pond Sect.

The remaining two were female cultivators. One dressed in golden robes with a veiled hat, her face obscured by flowing white silk. The other wore purple robes and tilted her head slightly, lost in thought.

Clutching the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal, he knelt quietly before the spring with head bowed. The figures in the sky remained silent. Li Xuanfeng waited, his heart cold as he thought, Half of Daoist Master Yuan Su’s legendary reputation rested on this little seal. It’s anything but ordinary. I wonder how many among those in the sky harbor greedy intentions.




# Chapter 721: Intervention

Li Xuanfeng held the small seal in both hands. He kneeled quietly on the ground and was feeling the cold touch in his palms. The seal was indeed small, it was only two fingers wide and three fingers tall.

Coiled atop the seal was a strange serpent, somewhat similar to the Hooked Serpent Li Wushao back home. However, this one was densely covered in feathers, with two long wings extending downward to shroud the sides of the seal.

Similar to a Hooked Serpent and with the seal’s name and Yuan Su’s Immortal Foundation in mind, could it be the legendary Pristine Water Feathered Serpent of old? thought Li Xuanfeng.

The seal was a pale golden hue throughout, perfectly uniform without a single impurity. Threads of bluish light flowed across its surface. Simply holding it made the skin feel cold, as though it weighed nothing at all.

This is certainly a spirit item and possibly an ancient one. I’ve heard it was gifted by Daoist Master Donghua, which would make it not only rare but likely one of the finest of its kind. It was worthy of upholding Yuan Su’s renown, thought Li Xuanfeng.

He remained silent as he was waiting for someone among the skyborne figures to speak. The seal, drawn by the lingering mana from Yuan Su’s passing, emitted a soft glow that cast a cyan-gold sheen across his collar.

He waited a long time, yet silence persisted. The flute song lingered briefly, then the stern-faced Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Azure Pond Sect’s in azure robes finally broke the silence with a calm voice, "The Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal belongs to my Azure Pond Sect. Naturally, it should be returned to its rightful owner."

Xiao Chuting remained silent, floating in midair. The purple-robed female cultivator suddenly spoke coldly, "Si Boxiu, is this seal truly Azure Pond Sect’s or does it belong to the Ning Family? You’d best make that clear! Or are you saying the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal should fall into your hands?"

This person was indeed Si Boxiu, a cultivator of Azure Pond Sect. Now he stood with hands clasped behind his back, responding bluntly with a resounding voice, "This matter is not yours to meddle in!"

At last, Daoist Master Pu Yu spoke, his figure drifting among the misty clouds, he said with a soft voice, "Please, seniors. No need for haste. The Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal is the relic of the late Senior Yuan Su. Naturally, it should be given to his descendants. With so many Daoist Masters present, this is evident to all."

He first turned to the purple-robed female cultivator and said gently, "Fairy Zipei, all of us here shared some degree of kinship with the late Yuan Su. Of course, we would not allow his possession to fall into the wrong hands."

Daoist Master Zipei nodded. After speaking, Pu Yu turned to look at Yuan Xiu, "Senior Yuan Xiu, let this item first be returned to the Ning Family. If Azure Pond still wishes to handle it further, let that be arranged internally within the sect..."

Si Boxiu remained relatively courteous to him, nodding with a neutral expression. Zipei simply flicked her sleeve, sending a wave of violet mist sweeping outward. She glanced coldly around and said, "Everyone need not linger here. No matter what, this item will never fall into the hands of outsiders."

These words seemed directed toward the hidden Purple Mansion Realm cultivators within the great void. A heavy silence followed. Her eyes brimmed with violet radiance as she swept her gaze through the void, seeing through all veils.

Though Li Xuanfeng never raised his head, he heard everything clearly. He had seen many spirit artifacts such as Yuanwu’s Cloudsunder and Binding Ring, and even the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. Yet this seal in his hand likely surpassed even that as it drew so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to covet it.

Zipei was one of the peak cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm. With a single sweeping gaze, she saw all with perfect clarity. Most of those who had been watching from the void quietly withdrew. Several even clasped hands politely before vanishing into the great void.

In just a few seconds, all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators dispersed. Partly out of respect for Zipei’s strength and partly out of wariness toward the Purple Smoke Gate and Azure Pond Sect. Soon, the field cleared except for one lingering figure.

Daoist Master Zipei crossed her arms. At her waist, a violet celestial sword lit up with dazzling brilliance. She spoke in a low voice, "Qing Jifang... What business brings you here from Mount Changhuai?"

As soon as her voice fell, a gray-robed youth appeared. He was holding a floating gray jade pearl that emitted streams of gray mist. He smiled and said, "Surely you jest, senior. Why shouldn't I be here? My Mount Changhuai in the Wu region is also one of the Six Chongming lineages. With such a great event unfolding, it's only right to come investigate and lend a hand."

He had only just appeared, and while the faces of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators remained composed, a sense of unease rose within them. Xiao Chuting held his white jade fishing rod and lowered his gaze as he thought to himself, As expected... even Mount Changhuai’s hidden force has made a move... I wonder if True Monarch Taiyi has already reached the late-stage of the Golden Core Realm... a pity for Shangyuan.

Clearly, the surrounding Purple Mansion Realm cultivators sensed from Qing Jifang’s words that Mount Changhuai had intervened and they each felt a foreboding within, though none let it show on their faces.

Only Qing Jifang remained calm and carefree, standing at ease with the hovering gray pearl in his hand. Though the others didn't express it, he could sense their wariness clearly and so he stood quietly, content.

By now, the situation had evolved beyond the mere ownership of the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal. Even Mount Changhuai’s True Monarch had seemingly become involved, altering the balance instantly. The assembled Daoist Masters fell silent, each deep in thought.

Taking advantage of their momentary distraction, Qing Jifang drifted gently down to the spring’s edge, gazing at the silent Li Xuanfeng and offering a faint smile.

As Qing Jifang looked at the old general with gray-black eyes, sharp brows, and a face subtly weathered from the absence of treasured panaceas, he felt a sudden, strange sense of familiarity. There was a ruthless dominance in the man’s presence that stirred something deep within him.

As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Qing Jifang had long mastered divine sight. A brief glance was enough to uncover the source of this familiarity. He paused, surprised, then smiled incredulously. He exclaimed, "I knew it! This face looked so familiar... What a coincidence. No, how uncanny! So it’s you!"

Li Xuanfeng kept his head lowered, saying nothing. But Qing Jifang burst into laughter and muttered, "Born of a yang father and bore the Three Nine True Talisman. Mother died by yin, with the Shamanic Blood Talisman. Brilliant, truly brilliant. Jiang Boqing’s methods are indeed formidable."

He bared gleaming white teeth and, as if recovering from amusement, called out, "Hand it over."

His laughter and cold demand drew the attention of the Purple Mansion cultivators above. Li Xuanfeng raised his brow and glanced at him but did not move.

Qing Jifang fell silent. Though Li Xuanfeng hadn’t moved at all, the gray mist surrounding him suddenly clashed with an unseen force which produced metallic ringing sounds. Qing Jifang sharply raised a brow and looked skyward.

There he saw Daoist Master Pu Yu in his blue-and-white robe nodding with a gentle smile, forming a spell with two fingers. The gray mist in Qing Jifang’s hand grew more agitated until a violet immortal sword appeared. Held between slender and fair fingers, it pointed directly at him. The sleeve’s purple silk unraveled and dissipated into violet mist.

Daoist Master Zipei stared coldly at him. Her red lips parted as she spoke bluntly, "You're welcome to try."

Though Qing Jifang was only at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm and clearly not a match for Zipei, his stance was firm. He stared in silence. The tension thickened to the point of suffocation. After over ten seconds, he finally said coldly, "You're not afraid, senior?"

Li Xuanfeng waited silently. At last, the golden-robed woman who had remained motionless in the air descended like a breeze, a leaden glow shimmering around her.

Her face remained hidden behind a veil of white gauze, concealing her features as she spoke gently, "Regarding today’s matter, my Golden Feather Sect shares the same view. Since Mount Changhuai is friendly with us... perhaps you could give me this courtesy."

Only after she spoke did Qing Jifang’s expression ease. With the Taibai Star still gleaming in the sky above, he could only reply, "Since this is Senior Qiushui’s stance, let this dharma artifact be handled by the Golden Feather Sect..."

Zhang Qiushui was cautious, unwilling to accept the words directly. She responded softly, "This is a matter for Chongming. I only hope it’s resolved properly, without losing decorum."

With Daoist Master Qiushui stepping in, the confrontation in the sky finally cooled. Qing Jifang gave Zipei a deep look and said quietly, "Your breakthrough is near, Daoist Master. Better to concern yourself with preserving your life."

With that, he pierced into the great void and vanished. Zhang Qiushui saw him off without a word, then calmly produced a crystal-clear jade flask.

She tipped it slightly, pouring a stream of clear wine into the air. The droplets landed on the reef below with crisp sounds, releasing a gentle, intoxicating fragrance.

After emptying the flask, she put it away. Her figure slowly faded until she too disappeared.

For a moment, heaven and earth fell silent. The spring murmured mournfully and the remaining Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the air said nothing. The sound of the flute left behind by Yuan Su’s passing echoed gently over the sea, evoking sorrow.

The flute’s melody clearly carried divine power. Fish and shrimp that leapt from the sea now lay limp on the reef, while faint sobs could be heard from the deep ocean below. Some demonic creatures must have heard the sound and been overwhelmed, they too were wailing at the seafloor.

The remaining Purple Mansion Realm cultivators present were all old acquaintances of Yuan Su. In life, he had been sharp-tongued and fond of sarcasm, not well-liked, so only a few had stayed behind.

None of them used divine ability and mana to resist the flute’s effects. Instead, they allowed themselves to be carried by its pull. As if they were lost in memory, all of them fell silent.

Li Xuanfeng listened for a while, his face tinged with sorrow.

He had followed Yuan Su for a long time. At first, it was more coercion than companionship. But later, Yuan Su had personally sought cultivation techniques and spirit armor for him, treated him as a junior or even kin. Though it was calculated, there was sincerity too. He had helped Li Xuanfeng through many hardships.

In the end, Yuan Su had pushed him to eliminate names on a certain list of cultivators. Yet Li Xuanfeng understood it was to prepare for matters after death. He couldn’t bring himself to hate him. He also knew Yuan Su had taken his uncle Li Chejing into the southern border. But now, everything felt uncertain.

"Hate... who should I hate? Who can I hate? They say everyone has hidden burdens... but if a burden exists, does that absolve guilt?" muttered Li Xuanfeng.

Now that this Purple Mansion Realm backer had passed away, it was impossible not to feel sorrow. Yet within that sorrow, he tasted the searing sting of betrayal. The mourning face of Li Tongya at his uncle’s death flashed before his eyes again. Li Xuanfeng bit his lip until blood spilled.

He remained kneeling on the ground when Zipei appeared beside him, frowning as she said, "Get up... Li Xuanfeng."

In an instant, all of Li Xuanfeng’s emotions vanished. He suppressed them once again into his heart, forming a cold, steely composure. He stood up quietly and said with respectful voice, "Greetings, Daoist Master Zipei!"

Her tone remained curt as she said, "Come with me to the Purple Smoke Gate."
𝐟𝕣𝗲𝕖𝕨𝗲𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝗲𝚕.𝗰𝚘𝐦

Yuan Xiu's face darkened at once, but Daoist Master Pu Yu quickly stepped in to smooth things over, speaking gently, "How about this. If you both still trust me, let the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal remain with me. I will accompany you to the Purple Smoke Gate myself.

"Senior Yuan Xiu can return to the sect first to handle matters and bring back Yuan Su’s descendants. The three of us will witness the spirit artifact recognize its master, everything will be proper."

Pu Yu, with his refined features and gentle smile, spoke smoothly. Yuan Xiu considered for a moment, then sighed with reluctant resignation. He waved his sleeve and said to Zipei, "Kan Xuyu... take care of yourself."

His form quickly faded and vanished. Daoist Master Zipei's expression remained unchanged. As Li Xuanfeng stood, still not fully reacting, he suddenly realized the seal had already been passed into Daoist Master Pu Yu’s hand.

He stood silently atop the clouds, listening as Daoist Master Pu Yu clicked his tongue in admiration, studying the seal’s carvings and sighing. He said, "So this is what the true Feathered Serpent looks like! Only the lineage of Daoist Master Donghua would know. After all, the Immortal Mansion’s Lord saw it firsthand. If even his records are inaccurate, then nothing in the world can be trusted."

After a while of praise, he began calculating with finger signs. Li Xuanfeng noticed faint traces of blood appear in Pu Yu’s palm, yet this strange Daoist Master turned the blood into fragments of mana and continued calculating relentlessly.

"Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal," he murmured... "To convert killing intent into suppression, to use the radiance of twin metals to summon Pristine Water... what a brilliant method. When this seal descends, it births slaughter beneath Xinyou, turning flat ground into a lucid marsh. No wonder it holds the makings of a true Dharma relic."

While he continued studying the seal on his own, Daoist Master Zipei finally spoke after a long pause, "I wondered when you became so kind. Turns out all your roundabout kindness was just to get your hands on this spirit artifact and examine it. Truly meticulous scheming!"

Pu Yu hummed in vague agreement, continuing to observe the seal carefully. The group soon emerged from the great void, reappearing in a realm filled with swirling violet mist.

Jagged peaks rose one after another, large and small, their summits appearing and vanishing within dense violet clouds. The mist coiled and swirled like silk, rising skyward with immortal elegance. Pavilions and towers gleamed with magnificence, and cultivators rode the clouds to and fro. It was a truly celestial scene.

Purple Smoke Blessed Land!

This was clearly the mountain gate of the Purple Smoke Gate. Daoist Master Pu Yu soon lifted his head to take in the view and praised, "What a blessed land indeed. In this very place, True Monarch Taixu attained his Dao and became a True Monarch, founding the Dao of Purple Essence. My grandmaster came to congratulate him, and even brought back a bit of dawn purple qi to craft a dharma artifact for my master."

At the mention of this, Daoist Master Zipei's expression finally softened somewhat. She spoke gently, "How flourishing the Six Chongming lineages once were... and now we've fallen to this. Had the founding patriarch not met with misfortune... perhaps things wouldn’t have ended up this way."

Daoist Master Pu Yu replied with a sigh, "True Monarchs Taiyu and Taixu, what a pity... If they hadn’t passed on one after another, the Green Pine Dao lineage might still have had a chance to rise again."

"Some people simply didn’t want to see it happen!" Zipei replied coldly. The two continued conversing while admiring the blessed land’s scenery, not bothering to avoid Li Xuanfeng listening to their conversation. After a few moments, Zipei finally remembered him and asked in a low voice, "Li Xuanfeng... which Li Family are you from?"




# Chapter 723: Pearl Swallowing

Daoist Master Zipei asked a question and then paused slightly. The purple mist within the cave dwelling paused along with her words, and Li Xuanfeng could only reply, "I was originally a cultivator of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake. Thanks to your guidance, I was stationed at the southern border. Now, I serve under the Ning Family."

"Li of Moongaze?" muttered Zipei.

Daoist Master Zipei didn’t seem to care much, only listening as Daoist Master Pu Yu spoke softly, "Senior, I heard they're a branch of the Wei’s Li lineage under Azure Pond Sect's jurisdiction."

"So it's the Wei’s Li branch," said Zipei.

Upon hearing this, Daoist Master Zipei immediately lost interest, as if she didn’t think much of Wei's Li. But since Li Xuanfeng had ties to Yuan Su, she pondered for a moment and said, "Wei’s Li, there’ll be room for movement later. Find a place to rest on the peak for now. When the time comes, return with Si Boxiu."

Li Xuanfeng cupped his hands and took his leave, descending into the mountain as purple mist drifted through the celestial landscape. Daoist Master Pu Yu watched him go and said seriously, "Senior Yuan Su truly went to great lengths to protect his junior, leaving the bargaining chip with the Ning Family was quite the calculated move..."

"Mm." Daoist Master Zipei responded softly, clearly seeing through the arrangement as well, "If he had passed away within the sect, this Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal would likely have ended up in the hands of the Chi Family or Si Boxiu. Even if passed to his descendants, it wouldn’t escape the sect's hidden manipulations.

"By passing away in public view, he actually secured the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal. With the Golden Feather Sect, you, and I as guarantors, and Si Boxiu needing to save face, it can be safeguarded for at least a few decades."

Daoist Master Pu Yu shook his head and said, "It won’t last forever. Once Si Boxiu waits too long and grows impatient, he’ll find ways, through pressure or otherwise, to make him hand it over willingly."

Daoist Master Zipei sat down amidst the swirling purple mist within her cave and said with a nod, "Isn't there a Ning Wan? A few decades should be more than enough. If she succeeds in her breakthrough, she’ll rightfully keep the spirit artifact. If she fails, it's a danger in her hands anyway, handing it over wouldn’t be a loss."

Both Daoist Masters had clearly seen through Yuan Su’s arrangement. Even Si Boxiu understood it, but each chose to go along with the flow.

Daoist Master Pu Yu paused, seemingly deep in thought, and after a long while spoke softly, "The True Monarchs’ battle won’t resolve quickly, but the heavens over the Northern Sea still need mending. All the sects must act together, we must invite another True Monarch.

"If we let the seawater continue to pour down like this, by the time the True Monarchs return, the Northern Sea will have flooded the wilderness, linked up with the Eastern and Western Seas, and submerged countless sects and territories."

Daoist Master Zipei nodded, clearly taking the matter seriously, and said softly, "Empress Beiyao has manifested often in recent years and is the easiest to negotiate with. Let’s seek her out.

"As for who should lead... naturally, it should be the Yue Cultivating Sect. All who acted such as the Azure Pond Sect, Golden Feather Sect, and the Dragon Clan should contribute. We just wait for Yue Cultivating Sect to make a move."

Daoist Master Pu Yu nodded gently, glanced eastward, and smiled, "All the True Monarchs have gone off to battle in the Outer Heavens, looks like the Dragon Clan is going to seize the thunder."

Eastern Sea.

Waves surged endlessly and the waters gleamed crystal-clear. All kinds of demonic creatures often rose with the wind and rode the waves. Islands were scattered irregularly across the sea like stars in the sky, with demonic creatures and beasts weaving in and out between them.

On a normal day, many cultivators would be seen flying across the sea, but now a sense of panic filled the air. Streaks of escape light flashed across the sky, trailing colorful glows behind them.

The islands across the sea gradually revealed a more ominous presence. The larger islands such as Splitreed Island, Chunyi Island, and Crimson Reef Island had expanded by thirty to forty percent, stretching out for thousands of meters. Marketplaces originally built on the seabed now emerged into view and formation arrays shimmered in the air with radiant light.

Even the mid-sized islands, like Qingsong and Dongliu, had greatly expanded. Cultivators looked out at the sea, their expressions a mix of concern and joy.

Demon dens slowly emerged on the exposed seafloor. Small demonic creatures held tridents in their hands, blankly watching the seawater recede inch by inch. Thunder roared across the heavens and earth, yet not a single drop of rain fell.

Li Qinghong led a group of cultivators from Zongquan Island to survey the area. The island had expanded nearly fifty kilometers and was still continuing to stretch outward, revealing various corals, fish, and shrimp.

There were now over thirty thousand people on Zongquan Island. Children and adults alike stood nervously along the former shoreline, staring blankly in fear. Some bolder ones had already rolled up their pant legs and stepped into the sea, tossing fish, shrimp, clams, and crabs into jars.

Li Qinghong hovered in the air with her spear in hand. Thunder surged beneath her feet and violet light flowed around her but she could not hide the worry in her expression.

She could vaguely see colorful lights rising in the north. But where Li Xizhi was, the Xia Mountain lay north of the Converging Sea and bordered the Northern Sea. From where she stood, in the Scarlet Pristine Sea nearly down to the Southern Sea, she could barely make out anything beyond a few faintly rising flashes of color.

All she could do was have Zong Yan arrange the people and, after waiting quietly for a while, decide to summon Huiyao to inquire further.

As the scouts were dispatched into the sea, Li Qinghong checked the time, quietly concealed her presence and waited in midair.

Sure enough, after waiting patiently for only a short while, a green fish with scaled wings under its ribs burst out from the water. It transformed into a half-human, half-fish form, holding a sea trident.

He finally withdrew his demonic wind, steadied himself, and respectfully said, "Ah! Greetings, Fairy."

Back when they fought the cloud octopus together, he had been terribly frightened by Li Qinghong’s thunder. Thunder was, after all, the righteous path for slaying demonic creatures, and he had submitted wholeheartedly ever since.

Now, seeing that Li Qinghong had already reached the late Foundation Establishment Realm and wore at her waist a small bottle with purple lightning-shaped patterns which radiated a deep and obscure thunderous power. He felt a chill of fear rise again in his heart, After all these years, this female cultivator of purple lightning has grown even stronger. Who knows what level she’s reached now... That’s right, Falling Water and Rising Storm in the Eastern Sea, this is the perfect time for a lightning cultivator.

He kept his head low and eyes down. Being a demonic creature of the Dragon Palace, he knew his place. Li Qinghong did not act arrogantly and asked, "Fellow Daoist, do you know the reason behind the receding seawater?"

Huiyao immediately understood and shook his head repeatedly, answering in a low voice, "Replying to the Fairy... Dingyuan the Dragon Son left some days ago. Now the many local demonic creatures are running about like headless flies. I inquired around several nearby waters, but all I heard were some vague and unreliable rumors."

Li Qinghong nodded, signaling him to continue. Huiyao said, "The word from several Water Mansions is that Dragon Monarch Beijia and Dragon Monarch Xiyang... dragged down a grotto heaven in Qunyi. As soon as the grotto heaven's entrance opened, the seawater began pouring into it, this is how things ended up like this!"

Li Qinghong had dealt with many demonic creatures over the years, but this was the first time she had heard the name Dragon Monarch Beijia. She asked, "Who’s Dragon Monarch Beijia?"

Huiyao paused for a moment, then suddenly understood and replied, "People like you, who are at the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Realm refer to him as the Dragon King of the Converging Waters."

So it was the leader of the Dragon Clan, the Dragon Monarch of Converging Waters, thought Li Qinghong.

Among the Dragon Clan, there were two well-known Dragon Monarchs. The first was the Lord of Converging Waters, known to commoners and lesser cultivators as the Dragon King of the Northern Sea. He had an extremely long lifespan and was referred to within the Dragon Clan as Dragon Monarch Beijia.

The other was Dragon Monarch Xiyang, who split from an immortal into three forms. Among Golden Core Realm cultivators, he was considered a junior and often appeared in the world which made him more widely known.

Seeing her expression, Huiyao quickly added, "Back in the day, the Dragon King was granted stewardship over the Northern Sea and was gifted the character 'Jia' by an immortal."

Li Qinghong nodded as she listened, though a strange look appeared on her face. She asked, "A grotto heaven? That’s impossible... With the power of those two Dragon Monarchs, how could seawater be allowed to leak into Thundercloud Temple?"

As the two were conversing, thunder suddenly exploded through the heavens and earth. The sea howled as dark clouds rolled, and waves of violet light began to appear in the eastern sky.

Layers of thunderclouds emerged, and a translucent, pale-golden circular outline hovered in the sky. Inside it, pavilions and towers gradually appeared, scattered among the violet thunderclouds.

"A grotto heaven!"

Countless bolts of thunder light emerged from the east. Li Qinghong felt her Immortal Foundation surging within, her internal thunder pool churning as a wave of intense foreboding washed over her. The shaft of her Duruo Spear shimmered with iridescent light, trembling with excitement.

Thundercloud Temple... Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling.

Li Qinghong understood that her destined opportunity lay here. But for now, she could only watch helplessly. Then, riding a streak of lightning within the black winds, she soared into the dark, heavy thunderclouds.

Intense thunder had already begun to spread in the area. Huiyao followed behind, trembling with fear. All around them, within the dark clouds, many cultivators could be seen looking up in stunned silence.

She gazed into the distant east, silently watching, passing through streaks of thunder, a trace of regret in her heart, It's a pity... I can't even touch this thing, and it's already fallen into the hands of the Dragon Monarch.

The Thundercloud Temple’s grotto heaven lay hidden behind the surging storm and thunder, and beyond the pale-golden barrier was a palace complex of thunder suspended in the air.

Countless black clouds gathered, covering the entire Eastern Sea. From time to time, a scale the size of a small mountain would emerge from the clouds, reflecting violet thunderlight so intense that Li Qinghong’s face turned deathly pale. She nearly lost her breath and fell from the sky.

She retreated some distance and saw that the black clouds above the Qunyi Sea resembled an enormous dragon's head, slowly swallowing a violet pearl.

It was now the moment when the grotto heaven and the mortal world overlapped. The scenery inside could be seen with the naked eye. Li Qinghong, having cultivated a perception technique, could clearly make out numerous ancient tomes swirling in the storm and falling like rain onto the palace rooftops.

She looked upward at the structure, the grotto heaven was composed of five thunder platforms. At the highest point stood a grand hall with finely carved eaves, rooftops of gilded copper, and floors paved with violet jade. Atop the ridge of the hall stood a lone, azure figure.

"Yuan Tuan..." Li Qinghong could barely make out her robes fluttering in the wind. She stood there, motionless like a statue atop the great hall, facing alone the dragon’s head whose teeth were as vast as mountains.

Boom!

Thunder roared as the woman and the violet grotto heaven sank into the clouds, like a shelled egg swallowed whole. They vanished from sight, and the Dragon Monarch didn’t even seem to chew before closing its mouth. The brilliant violet-golden light faded between its teeth.

In the final instant, Li Qinghong thought she saw that the woman's azure robes had turned red, vanishing like drifting sand within the depths of the celestial palace.

The black clouds in the sky vanished in an instant, retreating to the horizon as if fleeing, as though they had never appeared. Li Qinghong descended on a streak of lightning, feeling a deep sense of loss. Huiyao followed beside her and asked blankly, "Fairy, why did it suddenly start thundering...?"

Li Qinghong glanced at him quietly, a dazed expression on her face, and shook her head, saying, "The clouds were too thick, the thunder came in waves. I couldn't see clearly."

Both of them rode the wind downward. Huiyao muttered on about this and that, while Li Qinghong focused on calming her emotions.

"Such a surge of thunder... maybe the Dragon Monarch was simply dragging a grotto heaven as he passed through." Huiyao murmured with a tone of longing, "Seems like those from the neighboring waters didn’t have it right. After all, a grotto heaven should rest atop a mountain, not under the sea. There must be another reason."

Li Qinghong no longer hoped to learn anything useful from him. She politely sent him away, then quietly returned to her cave dwelling and sat alone in the upper chamber.

She sat for a while, but the image of the Dragon Monarch swallowing the pearl kept replaying in her mind. Li Qinghong understood, Yuan Tuan was most likely no longer alive.

Trapped in a grotto heaven for over ten years, watching helplessly as her would-be rescuer fell... and then slowly waiting to be consumed by the Dragon Monarch... Senior Yuan, thought Li Qinghong.

Li Qinghong had met Yuan Tuan before, back when she came to take Li Xizhi back to the sect. She seemed gentle and gracious. Later, Li Qinghong learned that Yuan Tuan had secretly intervened during the devil plague to protect Li Xuanxuan, which had made her grateful in her heart.

Azure Crest Manifestation is capable of blessing others, yet unable to secure good fortune for herself... only to fall into the tiger’s jaws in vain.

Whether Yuan Tuan's jade pendant in the Yuan Family still holds effect, I don’t know. But Azure Pond Sect’s soul lamp must already have gone out. As for Xizhi... there’s no need to tell him. He wouldn’t be able to see it anyway, it would only stir unnecessary trouble.

Just as Li Qinghong managed to settle her heart, she suddenly heard a crisp knocking sound.

Knock, knock, knock.

In an instant, Li Qinghong's heart felt as if it had been shattered like frost struck by a hammer, cold and shaken, filling her entire chest. All thoughts fled her mind, leaving behind only pure terror.

Knock, knock, knock...

The sound echoed through the cave dwelling, it was chilling and crisp. Li Qinghong’s expression changed slightly as she quickly gripped her spear and thought, Who’s there?

Zongquan Island was currently under the management of Li Chenghui, with Zong Yan assisting. If either of them needed her, they would activate the formation to summon her or send a voice transmission.

No matter what, it would never come to simply knocking on the door...

Creak...

Before she could respond and just as she picked up her spear, the defensive formation of the cave might as well have been decoration. The stone door at the entrance slowly creaked open, and a pair of cloth shoes stepped steadily inside.

The figure placed one foot inside, then pushed the door further open while stepping forward. As the door swung wide, a smiling face came into view, revealing eight gleaming white teeth.

The newcomer wore azure robes, appeared young, with flowing sleeves and long hair cascading down. His smile gradually faded as he squinted slightly at her, standing with hands clasped behind his back. He was seemingly curious.

His pupils were pale cyan, and he exuded a heavy and oppressive presence just by standing there. Countless rippling green shadows floated around him which overlapped and gleamed with an icy brilliance.

His robe was wide-sleeved and flowing, wholly azure in color, but at the waist hung a golden tassel. Li Qinghong recognized it, it was the uniform of the Azure Pond Sect.

Azure Pond disciples, guest cultivators, Daoists, peak masters, sect masters, and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators all wore similar robes but the details differed. Thanks to Li Xizhi and Yuan Tuan, Li Qinghong could recognize a peak master’s garb at a glance. But this robe, this one was even more ornate.

Her attention lingered on the robe for only a moment, then was immediately drawn to the man’s face.

Li Qinghong stared at him in a daze. She actually recognized this face. Not only did she recognize it, it was perhaps the last face she ever wished to see. Horror surged through her heart in waves as she thought, Chi Buzi!




# Chapter 725: Surplus Wealth

Li Qinghong’s pupils dilated slightly and the violet light in her eyes faded significantly. She had already stowed away the Duruo Spear, exhaled softly, brought her delicate hands together, and said gently, "Qinghong greets senior."

Li Qinghong remembered that day all too clearly. Chi Buzi’s soul had seemed damaged, and she didn’t know if he still recalled what happened. So she left it at that, simply calling him senior.

If Chi Buzi had indeed lost his memory, then it would be as if the two had never met. And if he was merely some Water Mansion Immortal Official, then her words would not be out of place either.

Chi Buzi, hair loose and unkempt, said nothing. He sat down on a nearby stone bench and his pale cyan eyes was fixed on her.

He had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm many years ago, and cultivated the Pristine Water Dao, which revolved around the balance of clarity and murk. Naturally, his appearance was refined and his presence ethereal. Yet in his eyes lingered something strange, something twisted and eerie. He parted his lips slightly and spoke in a low voice, "Li Qinghong, you recognize me."

Though he smiled, his words were cold like snow in the depths of winter, falling all over Li Qinghong’s body. She lowered her gaze and spoke, "Senior jests... Qinghong has cultivated for decades and never once laid eyes on a Purple Mansion Realm master. How could I be so fortunate as to witness a real Immortal’s presence..."

Chi Buzi sat quietly in the guest seat and used no divine abilities. Yet his presence was overwhelming, pressing heavily on Li Qinghong’s chest where she stood.

Dong, dong, dong...

The spring within the cave residence began to echo, its once-clear waters slowly turning a murky gray. Chi Buzi lifted his brow and said with a smile, "Li Qinghong, I can see it clearly. You're afraid of me, whether from guilt or fear itself. You may have methods to resist divine ability, but I can see it all."

Chi Buzi gazed at her calmly and continued, "That time, I likely used a soul searching technique and accidentally touched that one's Metallic Essence, that’s why I ended up like that. But this time... I won’t be careless."

The golden sash at his waist glowed faintly with spell-light. Chi Buzi rose and paced two steps atop the platform, speaking in a low voice, "I guessed it was your family, so I dared not return to Moongaze Lake. But after much searching, I found this Zongquan Island in the outer seas. So, I waited here."

Chi Buzi clasped his hands behind his back, standing with his back to the cave’s source of light. On his pale hands were two faint lines, and he spoke gently, "Now that Pristine Water has gone to the Outer Heavens and has no strength to oversee things here, I came. Li Qinghong."

He slowly turned around. From his pale cyan pupils emerged a terrifying murky qi, gathering into a mist-like haze that curled upward from the corners of his eyes. He asked, "And who’s the master? Yingze? Shexian? Or the one from the Water Mansion?"

Li Qinghong didn’t answer, only feeling the suffocating pressure in the cave intensify. She dissected Chi Buzi’s words, line by line and quickly arrived at a conclusion, 'I guessed it was your family'... 'you're afraid of me'. Chi Buzi's memory is definitely fragmented. Otherwise, he wouldn't be guessing, he'd remember what happened that day clearly.

There’s a ninety percent chance that he forgot what happened at the lake. Whether he truly forgot or merely dared not remember, it makes no difference!

Chi Buzi seemed indifferent, but those pale cyan eyes of his were clearly gauging her expression. He said, "Li Qinghong, that one left something in my soul, you must know this."

He smiled slightly, revealing sharp white teeth, beckoned with a finger, and whispered, "I didn’t dare think of it at all. I just wandered the Eastern Sea with that foolish Immortal Official, pointing everything out to him one by one, unraveling all his precious constructs. And so, his spirit wavered and he lost his foundation.

"Once his spirit wavered, he made the wrong choice. And then I consumed that foolish Immortal Official and swallowed all his cultivation. Only then did I dare to think again. You underestimated me, as did Chi Wei, Yuan Xiu and Pristine Water."

His tone remained calm, "I'm not some fool easily suppressed. The methods used to keep other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators obedient don’t work on me.

"I've already devoured the Immortal Official, it was a true tonic. It allowed me to master a fourth divine ability, one called Chougui Hidden Form. It conceals all dharmas within the body, and can do many, many things."

He walked to the head seat and slowly sat down, facing the glow of the cave, speaking softly, "The fact that you don’t dare kill me proves you’ve not yet reached the Golden Core Realm. You wish to reclaim your Fruition Attainment and to do that, Pristine Water must be eliminated."

Chi Buzi gave a faint smile and said gently, "How Pristine Water’s Fruition Attainment is dealt with, I won’t covet. I only ask for a single Golden Core, whether it’s a surplus position or an intercalary one, I ask only for that. The master will need someone like me..."

His expression was sincere, his tone gentle, "If the master wishes to reclaim Fruition Attainment or even ascend to immortal rank, you will need a capable hand. Trust me. In such a filthy world, whether for righteous path or heretical, people like me are the true sharp blades. The Immortal Official types... will only make more and more of a mess."

Chi Buzi didn’t wait for Li Qinghong to respond and said softly, "Whether Pristine Water will return gravely injured, whether Shangyuan will be struck down and retreat to Fruition Attainment. I, a mere Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, cannot see clearly. But the master surely can. If there is any command, you may stir fate itself to guide this humble one, Buzi will know."

It sounded like a pledge, yet also a subtle probe. He continued in a low voice, "But if this humble one dies, Pristine Water will surely notice. I fear it may jeopardize master’s plans."

Li Qinghong understood these words weren’t meant for her. She remained silent. Chi Buzi rose from the high seat, descended step by step, and came to stand before her, smiling and said, "Buzi takes his leave."

His figure vanished like a gust of murky wind, slipping into the cracks of stone and disappearing into the great void.

Li Qinghong remained standing in the courtyard, unsure whether the ‘master’ Chi Buzi spoke of was truly watching. She stood still for two breaths, then sat cross-legged, silently digesting everything Chi Buzi had said.

Qunyi Strait.

Chi Buzi moved through the great void, plunging deep beneath the sea. After traveling over five thousand kilometers, he stopped on a desolate, uninhabited island.

His hands, hidden in his sleeves, still trembled uncontrollably. His breath was rapid, and the calm, composed demeanor from earlier had long since vanished. His vision darkened with lingering panic.

"Damn it... That was a True Monarch or maybe even an immortal..." Chi Buzi panted as he tried to steady himself. The fact that he hadn't yet exploded into a puddle of blue water meant the True Monarch had at least partially accepted what he said.

"To bargain with a tiger... It's a desperate move, but the only one I have..." Chi Buzi’s expression darkened gradually as he muttered, "Pristine Water must know that the current Dao requires blending purity and turbidity to be successful. Yet he deceived Chi Rui and Chi Wei completely, handing down that Five Elements Command Metal Technique. He clearly just wants to keep them from breaking through!

"Right... Muhai said it himself, he’s strained everything to suppress the dragon nature of his Fruition Attainment. How could he possibly allow anyone else to attain a surplus or intercalary position? He fears being usurped more than anything!"

Chi Buzi’s gaze was steeped in shadow, like a venomous serpent. He muttered to himself, "If I want to reach the Golden Core Realm, staying under Pristine Water only leads to death! I’d be thrown into that Pristine Gui Pool eventually... If I can’t reach the Golden Core Realm in this life, what’s the point of living? Better to die now!"

He had nothing to lose. He didn’t fear being struck down by the Li Family’s True Monarch, or being discovered by Pristine Water. If he couldn’t break through to the Golden Core Realm, it was only a matter of time before he died anyway.

Let it be death then. I’ll try it anyway! Chi Buzi’s thoughts churned as he considered, That one is likely Water Virtue too, it’s able to navigate both sides. If I get a clear read on them, and they falter. Then, once things are done with Pristine Water’s backing, I might still have a chance at Golden Core Realm...

Mount Qingdu.

Li Xijun rode the wind back from the lake’s edge and landed atop the mountain. He had seen strange phenomena in both the north and east. Not only the Li Family, but the entire Jiangnan region was in turmoil, with everyone anxious and afraid.

Li Ximing had long since entered seclusion to cultivate, but Li Xijun had to stay alert to the situation. The Li Family’s forces in Milin Prefecture were gradually being reinforced, and a few branches had been transferred in as they were preparing to establish several peak offices.

After all, Milin Prefecture was quite vast, it was even broader than the family’s original territory. Distributing several peaks across it was more than feasible.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝚠𝕖𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝕖𝚕.𝚌𝗼𝗺

Just as Li Xijun entered the main hall, he saw a young man standing within. The young man was graceful and noble, clad in white robes, with an extraordinary presence. Li Xijun’s eyes lit up and he said with a smile on his face, "Brother Xizhi!"

The visitor was naturally Li Xizhi. Though he had stayed the night at Xia Mountain, in the end, he couldn’t rest easy. He flew back alone, leaving Yang Xiao’er safely behind at the mountain.

He nodded to his younger brother and spoke softly, "True Monarch Shangyuan has now successfully broken through in the Northern Sea, you must’ve heard."

Seeing Li Xijun nod, he gave a rough overview of the situation across the Four Seas. Just then, Li Chengliao flew up to the peak. Upon seeing Li Xizhi, his eyes lit up, and he bowed, "The family branches in Milin have all been settled. We’re surveying the earth veins now, and selecting several mountains to establish new peak offices."

Li Xijun replied in a low voice. Outside, the sound of a gentle drizzle began. Li Chengliao seemed uneasy and gave the falling rain a slight glance.

Li Xijun also felt a faint chill in his heart. Strange omens had been appearing frequently in recent days. He couldn’t help but worry for his elder brother Li Xicheng, who was in seclusion. While he was still processing the thought, someone came up from below.

The woman who approached was graceful and striking. It was Li Minggong, eldest of the Radiant Lure generation. Her cultivation wasn’t high, still only at the early-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and her face carried sorrow as she cupped her hands and said, "Reporting to Eighth Uncle... Eldest Uncle’s life jade has shattered."

Li Xijun froze in place for a moment, so this was the reason for the rain. Beside him, Li Chengliao’s eyes turned red upon hearing news of his father’s death. He stood there, stunned.

Li Xicheng was Li Xijun’s elder brother. Both of them had lost their father young, and the bond between them ran deep. Though he had a faint premonition, Li Xijun still stood frozen in place. Li Xizhi, unaware that Li Xicheng had been in seclusion attempting a breakthrough, showed a faint expression of grief and asked quietly, "What happened!"

The group swiftly rode the wind, descending like lightning into the underground Water Mansion of Mount Qingdu. Only then did they notice the dampness of the cave. When they reached the stone door where the seclusion chamber lay, droplets of water covered the surrounding walls.

Seeing this, Li Xizhi immediately understood. He lowered his gaze in silence, while Li Xijun hesitated for a moment before ultimately instructing Li Chengliao to open the chamber. At the same time, he turned to Li Minggong and ordered, "Elder Brother has many children, go summon them here."

Li Minggong nodded. With a sword at her waist and graceful bearing, she replied, "Messengers have already been sent. They’ll be arriving shortly, along with several elders from the chief’s court."

Years ago, when Li Ximing abdicated his position, Li Xicheng had been appointed in his place and later became head of the family. That role was then passed to Li Chengliao. His death was no small matter, it warranted the presence of the family elders.

By custom and courtesy, it fell to Li Chengliao to handle his father’s remains, while the other matters were left to Li Xijun. He quickly composed himself, observing as several youths entered the Water Mansion. They were nervous and reserved.

These were Chengliao’s younger siblings, some with low aptitude, others mere mortals. The Li Family's system was harsh in this regard. Most of these children had never even been to Qingdu, and every action they took was scrutinized because of their birth. All of them stood in silence.

Li Xijun took the time to ask their names, noticing their clothes were worn and modest. Before he could inquire further, the family elders arrived. Led by Li Xuanxuan, most of them were white-haired elders. Li Xuanxuan’s beard trembled slightly as he sighed in sorrow.

A few members of the chief’s court stood behind the current chief, Li Zhouwei. The heir stood quietly, head bowed, tightly gripping the jade slip in his hand, his fingertips slightly pale.

Having observed everyone carefully, Li Xijun finally spoke in a soft voice, "According to custom, the contents of Elder Brother’s storage pouch and cave residence go to Chengliao. The remaining spiritual assets and treasures shall be distributed among his children. We are all present to witness. You may begin the reading."

With that said, he waited for Li Zhouwei to handle the division. But the young man cupped his hands slightly and replied, "Grandfather left one residence, two meditation cushions, and a single incense burner. They are valued at three Spirit Stones. It's insufficient for division, so it was converted into three hundred jin of spirit paddy. Fifty jin for each child."

At these words, Li Xuanxuan froze. The elders all looked to one another, expressions shifting. Li Xizhi exchanged only a glance with Li Xuanxuan and both understood what the other was thinking, Chengliao and Zhouwei aren’t the type to covet wealth... so why are they making such a poor show of it?

After a moment of silence, one man stepped forward. He was Li Xicheng’s second son who was now married, with a grown beard. He bowed respectfully and said, "Honored elders, my grandfather left behind no remains. My father endured hardship since youth and disdained luxury. The things he acquired in life were all gifted to struggling cultivators, both inside and outside the family. While cultivating in Qingdu, his residence held not a single spirit item."

His words left the hall in silence. Li Xijun nodded slightly. Beside him, Li Zhouwei added, "Honored elders, Grandfather governed the household for seventeen years and he left behind no surplus wealth."

Li Xizhi listened in silence, and suddenly remembered the year he left home at twelve to enter the sect. He remembered how his elder brother Li Xicheng had used his savings to buy him an Embryonic Breathing Realm jade pendant.

That year, Li Xicheng had insisted on placing it in his hand. Coming from the Xiao Family on his mother's side, and with his father then the family head, Li Xizhi had grown up in luxury. Holding that jade felt like grasping burning coal.

The jade pendant wasn’t even as refined as those issued to Azure Pond Sect disciples. Yet he had worn it for years, fastened to his wrist until he no longer noticed it.

Now, he felt the cool touch of the pendant against his skin, its presence suddenly sharp. Hearing the words ‘no surplus wealth,’ an ache welled in his chest.

Li Xijun, who had spent many years with his elder brother, felt it even more deeply. His heart grew heavy, Elder Brother always believed he had stolen Ximing’s rightful place... He treaded as if on thin ice. Though called a young master, he never received a young master's due... Not even from himself.

As he was lost in thought, several family elders began murmuring among themselves. Li Xizhi turned his head toward Li Xijun and spoke gently, "Elder Brother was never one for words, only action. When Ximing emerges from seclusion, someone must tell him... That burden he threw down at eighteen, our elder brother carried all of it and he carried it well."




# Chapter 727: Chenghui

Heaven and earth reflected within the mirror.

The world was shrouded in gloom. Moon-white buildings lined up in neat rows, nestled among the rocky terrain. These jade-like palaces were mostly curved and gleaming, with massive stone beasts crouching along the cliffs. All of it appeared silver-white under the moonlight.

Lu Jiangxian sat quietly before the jade table, a faint azure glow emerging in front of him.

The moment Chi Buzi appeared on Zongquan Island, Lu Jiangxian was jolted awake. The contingency he had left within Chi Buzi’s soul quickly transmitted everything back. Various scenes of the Eastern Sea flickered through his pupils.

Two seconds later, Lu Jiangxian once again sat properly at the jade table.

Chi Buzi.

Back then, Lu Jiangxian implanted a hidden trick in Chi Buzi’s soul. It was partly to steal memories and partly to suppress him. Now, having obtained the Immortal Official’s memories, he immediately sensed something was wrong.

If memories were transmitted back... then the contingency within the soul must still be active.

Lu Jiangxian frowned and reviewed the memories. Sure enough, over the years, Chi Buzi had engaged in a battle of wits with the Immortal Official from the Water Mansion, wandering all across the Four Seas in search of traces of the so-called Immortal Court.

Those memories had been hastily fabricated by Lu Jiangxian to explain the Immortal Official’s origins. How could they match reality? After circling the Four Seas, both man and soul realized something was amiss.

Yet, this realm’s Daoist traditions resembled those of their previous life while differing in many ways. Various Dao Seed techniques had real foundations. After a brief quarrel, the split soul had to admit that the Immortal Court had indeed collapsed and vanished during some ancient immortal-devil war.

The Immortal Official’s soul was originally a fragment of Maha Jinlian Maha, a being of strange and demonic origin. Upon realizing the Immortal Court was gone, it immediately developed wicked intentions and sought to seize Chi Buzi’s body and live again.

The two battled endlessly. One was a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, an old devil from Azure Pond Sect. The other fancied himself a man of the righteous path, yet was equally cunning. They schemed against each other for over a decade.

In the end, Chi Buzi succeeded in assimilating the talisman qi, and the Immortal Official was devoured. Yet the radiance in Lu Jiangxian’s hand clearly confirmed that the Immortal Official had, over the years, mastered the soul arts of this path and might still be hiding somewhere deep in Chi Buzi’s soul.

That restriction within Chi Buzi’s soul still shimmered faintly. Despite their bitter battle of cunning and betrayal, neither Chi Buzi nor the Immortal Official had touched that seal. It was as if they had a mutual, unspoken agreement.

Lu Jiangxian sat silently upon the jade throne for a while. He was no longer the same man he once was. In his heart, he speculated, Chi Buzi might very well know the Immortal Official isn’t dead. Perhaps he doesn’t dare kill someone connected to me... deliberately handing over leverage to make me think he’s under control.

As for joining forces against Pristine Water...

Lu Jiangxian naturally had no impulse to confront Pristine Water now. The more he understood this world, the more cautious he became. All he wanted was to focus on restoring the mirror, why would he provoke Pristine Water?

I can’t even step out of the mirror, how could I possibly drag him down from his Fruition Attainment? thought Lu Jiangxian.

Those figures were still fighting beyond the Outer Heavens. His true body was hidden in the great void and he could faintly sense its tremors. If he revealed even the slightest trace, he feared he’d be immediately perceived.

Shangyuan has ascended to become a True Monarch...

Lu Jiangxian set aside the numerous techniques and spell arts in those memories for now. He stirred his divine senses and indeed found that the various Shamanic Talisman Dao arts he’d previously developed had all changed. There was an added ingredient of Jade True Essence Catalyst that made them quite different.

He sat quietly before the stone table, calculating inwardly, Over the past century, I’ve come to gradually understand this world. Not only the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, but even many Golden Core Realm cultivators are now familiar to me...

In Yue State, there’s Azure Pond Sect’s Pristine Water, Golden Feather Sect’s Taiyuan, and Yue Cultivating Sect’s Taiyue. That makes three True Monarchs. Wu State is similar in size to Yue, and I only know about Changhuai’s Taiyi. There are probably two or three there as well. So Jiangnan should have around six True Monarchs.

The Eastern Sea has two dragon kin. I've heard Valley Water is among them. The Northern Sea reportedly has two, and the Southern Sea is about the same size as the East. Altogether, the Four Seas should have about nine.

And then there are the Wang and Xie Families, Mount Luoxia, the Underworld... there’s quite a number overall.

By his calculations, the Immortal Dao alone had ten True Monarchs, clearly dominant. No wonder the Northern Buddhists had kept their heads down all this time...

And as for ancient True Monarchs, there must be even more of them!

From the Immortal Official’s memories, Lu Jiangxian had gathered much information. What he desired most, however, was to trace his own origins. For it was very possible that he had a previous life, and had been the lord of the Moonlight Origin Mansion.

After reviewing everything, he still felt that the identity of Yingze was the most likely.

First, his mirror was a treasure of moonlight origin. It was said the Moonlight Origin Mansion possessed the Sun-Moon Profound Light, possibly formed from both the Supreme Yin Profound Light and Supreme Yang Profound Light. It was a perfect match for Yingze, which symbolized both yin and yang.

Second, Yingze belonged to Green Pine Temple, and the Sun Seeker Ring bore the inscription Green Pine Temple Lu Jiangxian. This was another match.

But most importantly, Green Pine Temple’s grotto heaven reflected itself above and below, wasn’t that exactly like a mirror? And that grotto heaven had been forged by Yingze.

With these three clues aligning, Yingze seemed the most likely identity.

The Golden Feather Sect’s Taiyuan called Yingze ‘senior,’ so Yingze must have been at least a True Monarch, possibly even a Dao Embryo...

But things weren’t so easily concluded. Two matters still left him uncertain, he thought, The Lord of Moonlight Origin Mansion was said to be an Immortal Lord, Yingze might fall short of that. And Li Jiangqun has seen me, which means I was still active in the more recent ancient times, while Yingze seems to have perished long ago.

So he could only list Yingze as a suspect for now. He continued thinking, In any case, at least five True Monarchs are lying in wait for this Yingze. Mount Luoxia has a Dao Embryo and so does the Underworld. Exposure must be avoided at all costs.

He hadn’t even considered Chi Buzi’s suggestion as he only found the man troublesome. With a sigh, he muttered, “At the very least, Pristine Water is in a bad spot, he’s bound to suffer injuries this time and will have no energy to manage those beneath him.”

He conjured those memories into form, and soon a collection of ancient texts that were all stored within azure jade slips appeared before him.

Chi Buzi had been cautious, only allowing him to see the Foundation Establishment Realm chapters of Azure Pond Sect techniques... but Pristine Water’s five Daos were all complete.

He specially selected these five paths, which were Dark Floating Compliant Cloud Sutra, Lucid Marsh Profound Cave Sutra, Ugly Sunflower Water-Seeking Method, Clear Serenity Dusk Sutra, and Dew Tribulation Falling Petal Art.

These corresponded to Pristine Water’s five techniques, Heavy Murk, Spring’s Echo, Sunflower Concealment, Clear Dusk Rain, and Purging Dew.

Lu Jiangxian set them aside for now. Naturally, he wouldn't allow the Li Family to cultivate these techniques. They would serve only as references for his own spell art and the study materials related to the Pristine Water Origin Talisman Essence.

After all, the path of Pristine Water was closely tied to talismans. In Jiangnan, talismans were easily refined, perhaps this connection would offer some inspiration, thought Lu Jiangxian.

Lu Jiangxian didn’t examine the rest of Azure Pond Sect’s techniques in detail. He just glanced through several spell arts that all bore distinct characteristics of Azure Pond’s methods and footwork techniques.

After a full review, he stumbled upon something interesting.

It was an old biographical text that Chi Buzi had specifically found, hoping the split soul might recognize someone within it.

The book was quite peculiar. The author’s surname was Chen, Chen Xuanxiang. Lu Jiangxian brought it forth, transforming it into a small book he held in his hands.

“On the 21st day of the 11th month in the year before winter, in the early days after the chaos settled, I was betrothed young to a Li lady. I returned with my mother to Ning State and gained the service of two retainers, Xiao and Quan... I traveled south and roamed all across Jiangnan.”

This man had lived long ago, nearly a thousand years prior, during the flourishing era of the Yuan Family, when the Dongli Sect still existed. Remarkably, the text recorded news of the Six Sons of Chongming:

“Taiyue, Taiyi, and Taiyu shone brightly in the lead. Taixu, Taizhu, and Taiqing rose in their wake. The Dao lineage of Green Pine glowed brilliantly in the near-ancient era...”

Lu Jiangxian studied it closely, matching each name one by one. A strange feeling welled up in his heart, So that means... These were all disciples of Yingze...? One sect with four Golden Cores Realm cultivators? Maybe even six...

Doubt lingered in his heart, and he mused silently, “Just what kind of Dao lineage... was Green Pine Temple?”

———

Zongquan Island.

Li Qinghong waited a while inside the cave dwelling, but no response came. Even Chi Buzi's presence had vanished. The spring within the cave, once murky, had returned to clarity, and the tinkling sound of flowing water had disappeared.

She exhaled softly in the cave and did not dare to think too much. Turning back, she exited the residence. All was utterly still. Zongquan Island was cloaked in night, the formation intact, without a single disturbance or ripple of alarm.

Just outside was the ritual platform of the Profound Thunderpool. Li Chenghui was seated upright upon it in cultivation, barely three meters from the cave entrance. He had sensed nothing, not even the sound of knocking had reached his ears.

Li Qinghong stepped lightly outside. The starlit sky above was bright and serene. After enduring the falling of the sea, the dragon swallowing the purple pearl and the arrival of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, even someone as resolute as she no longer had the heart to cultivate.

She had barely stepped out when Li Chenghui, nearby, was instantly roused. He rose steadily and said in a deep voice, “Aunt, the matter the family asked us to investigate some years ago, we’ve finally found a lead.”

Li Qinghong immediately understood and asked, “Is it regarding the Bright Yang treasure?”

She had received a letter from Li Xijun, instructing her to keep an eye out for several Bright Yang treasures in the Eastern Sea to assist Li Ximing’s breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. Despite her efforts to investigate, there had been no results. Now reminded, she thought in her heart, A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could take our lives as easily as reaching into a sack. Ximing is already at the late-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. How many secret techniques has he mastered, and what are his chances?

But Li Chenghui had uncovered something else and simply said, “There’s a Dao lineage in the Scarlet Pristine Sea that cultivates Bright Yang. It’s located in a remote area to the east, and we’ve now found its exact location. We might pay them a visit, perhaps it will yield something.”

Li Qinghong asked for more details, and Li Chenghui presented a jade slip. Within, everything was meticulously recorded. Even the estimated truthfulness of the gathered information and how the retreating sea might alter the terrain for easier identification were recorded down.

He also offered a detailed report on recent changes to the island such as how much land had been revealed as the sea receded, how it was managed and how it was fairly distributed between the incoming family members and the native residents. Everything was orderly and transparent.

Li Qinghong read through it, and the worry in her brows eased slightly. She spoke gently, “Good child... among the Radiant Lure generation, only Chengliao, Minggong, and you have proven yourselves. Chengliao is now the family head, and Minggong is gradually taking hold of family affairs. Only you remain here with me, at the far edge of the sea... it’s been hard on you.

“Your elder brother... he didn’t send you here out of disregard. The family simply had no one else suitable. Please try to understand.”

Li Chenghui shook his head. He had always been silent and unambitious, diligently handling family matters with order and fairness. He never spoke of right or wrong. It was rare for him to speak in a deep tone, “Whether by reason or sentiment, even considering the heir, eldest brother is the family head. I know my own abilities well. Managing this small island is more than enough for me.”

He added quietly, “The three of us cultivated together since childhood, yet our cultivation cannot compare to our elders. We are far from it. Whenever this is discussed, I feel uneasy and unworthy. Things as they are now... are good. I am content.”

What Li Chenghui said could be called the shared burden of the entire Radiant Lure generation. From eldest Li Chengliao to youngest Li Chenghuai, they simply could not match the former generation.

No matter how hard these sons worked in cultivation, they found themselves far behind the records left by their fathers and grandfathers. No effort seemed enough. And then came Li Zhouwei, rising like the morning sun which made all others seem dim in comparison.

These children were sincere and clever. They looked at one another and felt unworthy of their place on the Qingdu rolls. This eventually led to the Radiant Lure generation’s voice within the family growing faint. Most did not dare not speak up at all.

Li Qinghong understood all this. Li Xijun had written to her several times on the matter. Nowadays, it was increasingly difficult to bestow talisman seeds, which meant one could not receive the formal initiations. The younger generation already lacked talent, without these two supports, how could they possibly catch up?

As for the heir Li Zhouwei, Li Qinghong naturally held great hopes. But she had seen too much in her life. What was highly anticipated often fails, and what was done without expectation often succeeds. Back when she left Li Chenghui to cultivate the thunder arts, she had her own reasons.
𝚏𝐫𝚎𝗲𝕨𝐞𝐛𝕟𝚘𝐯𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝗺

She simply encouraged him by saying, “I’ve prepared various pills for you. Now, with water falling and thunder rising, cultivation progresses quickly. It’s the perfect time to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. To speak frankly, you’re the only one in Radiant Lure who still has a real chance.

“Work hard on the island. The mainland shifts constantly, and a Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough is a remote hope. Success means joining the immortal families. Failure... if something changes in the family and we’re no longer here, someone must remain at Foundation Establishment Realm to steady things. Whether retreating overseas or gathering remnants... at the very least, you must reach Foundation Establishment Realm.”

After Qinghong had spoken to such an extent, Li Chenghui was startled. He stared at her blankly for a moment, then understood. He bowed deeply and said solemnly, “I, Chenghui, will keep this firmly in heart and dare not slacken.”

Li Qinghong nodded, then soared into the sky on lightning, speeding off in the direction marked on the jade slip. Li Chenghui stood quietly for a moment.

Li Chenghui had once been content. As one of the top Qingdu scholars in the family, governing a small island was effortless for him. He had simply wished to manage it well and await reassignment from the family.

But Li Qinghong had seemingly seen through his heart. Her words stirred something in him. Though his eyes remained lowered, there was now a subtle gleam within them. He sat back down in meditation, restraining the surge in his chest as he faintly resonated with the thunderclouds above.

If the family falls into turmoil, then I shall be the contingency. I will bear a spear and ride thunder into the fray.




# Chapter 729: After Yuan Tuan’s Death

Purple Smoke Blessed Land.

Purple mist drifted ethereally, clouds smoke blanketed the mountain peaks. Since Li Xuanfeng was personally brought back by a Daoist Master, the cultivators of the Purple Smoke Gate treated him with great courtesy and arranged a cave dwelling for him on the main peak.

Although his Dao lineage had nothing to do with the Purple Essence, the area at least had an abundant spirit vein and rich spiritual energy, which greatly benefited his cultivation. Had he cultivated here earlier in life, he might have broken through a few years sooner.

Unfortunately, my path of cultivation is gradually coming to an end, thought Li Xuanfeng.

Li Xuanfeng's cultivation method only allowed him to reach the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. It lacked the chapters to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. His cultivation had slowly reached a bottleneck, just like Tang Shedu and the like, stuck in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Even if he had time to practice secret techniques, he had no matching cultivation method to accompany them. Li Xuanfeng could only regulate his breath to the peak and slowly practiced footwork techniques and perception arts.

After a few days of cultivation here, Daoist Master Yuan Xiu soon arrived with his people, openly tearing through the skies above the blessed land. Li Xuanfeng, who was cultivating in the mountains, looked up and saw a man being carried in Yuan Xiu’s hand. Upon closer look, it was Ning Heyuan.

To be cautious, Daoist Master Zipei summoned Li Xuanfeng. Upon returning to the cave filled with fluctuating purple qi, he saw three Daoist Masters seated in a circle, with Ning Heyuan standing dazed in the center.

The impact of Ning Tiaoxiao’s death on Ning Heyuan was far beyond what Li Xuanfeng had experienced. Yuan Su’s place in Ning Heyuan’s heart was likely greater to how Li Tongya once regarded the Li Family. Li Xuanfeng saw him standing respectfully, yet his eyes were vacant, as if his mind was elsewhere.

Just as Li Xuanfeng stood still, Zipei spoke up and asked, "Li Xuanfeng, is this person a descendant of Yuan Su’s lineage?"

Seeing Li Xuanfeng nod in response, Zipei turned to Daoist Master Pu Yu, who performed a divination. The result was roughly accurate, so Zipei took out a small seal from his sleeve and said softly, "Ning Heyuan!"

"This junior is here," replied Ning Heyuan, nodding respectfully. Zipei placed the seal in her palm, seemingly lost in some old memories. After a moment of thought, she said, "Yuan Su never liked hearing about the past, and perhaps never spoke of it to you. Since I preserved this item for him, I must also tell you of its origin, so you know whose grace you are receiving."

As she finished, Daoist Master Pu Yu nodded slightly, while Yuan Xiu turned his face away and remained silent. Li Xuanfeng silently understood in his heart, I’ve always heard that this one from the Purple Smoke Gate was at odds with Yuan Su. But it seems they knew each other in the past and simply had a falling out... In the end, she still helped him preserve much.

Zipei spoke softly, "This seal is the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal, forged from Xinyou Profound Metal, Tai Pristine Essence, and Langya Jade. It is an ancient seal, and sealed within it is the Pristine Water Feathered Serpent.

"This ancient seal was originally a dharma artifact of a Purple Mansion Realm great demonic beast under the Feathered Serpent. Later, it was defeated by a senior from the Moonlight Origin Mansion and came into the hands of the Immortal Mansion, where it was refined by moonlight.

"Eventually, it came into the possession of Daoist Master Donghua of the Immortal Mansion, who then gifted it to Ning Tiaoxiao."

Daoist Master Zipei spoke clearly and without reservation. Li Xuanfeng listened quietly from the side and understood everything.

The attitudes of the Three Sects and Seven Gates toward Daoist Master Donghua had always been ambiguous. Publicly, they credited him as a beneficiary of the Immortal Mansion’s legacy, but many rumors claimed he was actually a direct inheritor.

Now, with a firsthand account from someone who had personally witnessed those events, it was a clear confirmation. It was one that contradicted the official records of the sect. Ning Heyuan didn’t dare speak further and accepted the seal with both hands.

Zipei spoke softly, "This treasure... both Qiushui and I used it back in the day. There are twelve incantations. I will now pass them to you, remember them well."

Si Boxiu stood with his hands behind his back, his rigid face cold and expressionless. He simply flicked his sleeve and vanished into the great void.

Daoist Master Pu Yu also nodded in farewell. The jade seal in Ning Heyuan's hands radiated brilliant light as streams of azure water manifested around him, and golden-blue light flowed by his side. His eyes were tightly shut, as if communicating with the seal.

Daoist Master Zipei finished passing on the incantations, listened carefully for a moment, then flicked her sleeve and said, "Now that you’ve received the treasure, go back and cultivate it well."

The two only felt a blur before their eyes as they were swept out of the blessed land by a wave of her sleeve. Looking around, they had arrived at Libu Prefecture, on the easternmost edge of the Azure Pond Sect. It was right at the border with the Purple Smoke Gate, and below them, the streets bustled with noise and bright lights.

Ning Heyuan and Li Xuanfeng both rode the spirit wind in midair to steady themselves. Ning Heyuan held the seal close to his chest, still processing what had just happened, and muttered, "Why did it happen so fast?"
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝒆𝒘𝙚𝓫𝙣𝙤𝒗𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

He muttered to himself, unclear whether he was speaking of Zipei's methods or Yuan Su. Li Xuanfeng stood silently behind him and then saw Ning Heyuan speak with a slightly trembling voice, "Brother-in-law, do you have any other affairs to attend to...? Or will you return to the sect with me?"

Ning Heyuan gripped the dharma seal tightly to the point where his fingers turned pale. His eyes shone brightly in the night as he fixed his gaze on Li Xuanfeng's expression.

Li Xuanfeng remained as composed as ever, neither arrogant nor servile, and said softly, "I await the family head's instructions."

With Yuan Su only just deceased, Li Xuanfeng's stance meant everything to Ning Heyuan. This seasoned cultivator didn’t need to do anything, just standing behind him gave Ning Heyuan confidence.

He immediately breathed a sigh of relief and quickly said, "If brother-in-law has matters to handle, feel free to go on your way... but if not, then return with me to the Ning Family."

Li Xuanfeng nodded and rose into the air with him. Ning Heyuan made small talk along the way and only after confirming that Li Xuanfeng’s demeanor hadn’t changed did he finally feel at ease.

Ning Heyuan paused for a moment and asked, "Did the Daoist Master leave any final words or messages?"

Li Xuanfeng gave a quiet nod and replied in a low voice, "Do not dare to hate."

Mushroom Forest Plain.

Clouds drifted slowly above the Mushroom Forest Plain. Yuan Huyuan stood quietly over the forested hills, watching the people below crawl like ants. The hands hidden within his sleeves had turned slightly pale.

A band of Heavenly Glow approached from afar, dazzling and floating in the sky. Yuan Huyuan instinctively prepared to retreat, but saw the glow take shape beneath the feet of a graceful young man.

"Senior Huyuan."

"Li Xizhi..."

The newcomer was indeed Li Xizhi. Upon returning to the Li Family, he had immediately received word from the sect that Yuan Tuan’s soul lamp had gone out and he had perished in the Eastern Sea.

Upon receiving the news, and with Yuan Chengdun’s pair of Demon Subduing Copper Rods already returned to the Li Family, Li Xizhi rode the Heavenly Glow to seek out members of the Yuan Family.

Unbeknownst to him, a brief survey of the skies using his cultivated perception technique quickly revealed Yuan Huyuan who was quietly concealed above.

Yuan Huyuan was nominally no longer part of the Yuan Family, but in truth, it was merely a ruse orchestrated by him and his brother Yuan Hudu. Upon seeing Li Xizhi, Yuan Huyuan sighed inwardly. Both families clearly understood the current situation, so there was no need to hide. He cupped his hands and said, "Greetings, Daoist."

Li Xizhi cupped his hands and said softly, "Master has fallen."

Yuan Huyuan’s aged face sagged, his brows tightly furrowed. He froze upon hearing the words and only said, "Oh... Tuan'er has fallen."

Of course, Li Xizhi knew his sister had been played by the Yuan Family, but their patriarch Yuan Hudu had also been shot in full view of the public, utterly disgraced and now still recovering from his wounds. In the end, the scales had balanced somewhat.

Li Xizhi simply asked, "The Dragon Clan needed Master as a key. The Yuan Family couldn’t have obtained the Azure Manifestation Dao lineage by chance. Your ancestors were disciples of Yanyang Temple, weren’t they?"

Li Xizhi stood still for a moment. The old man before him kept adjusting his sleeves, his wrists trembling slightly, never once meeting Li Xizhi’s gaze. With a trembling voice, he said, "Yes... yes..."

The multicolored glow around Li Xizhi gradually dimmed as he asked, "Did Master know the truth? Was she forced out by people like you... or did she go willingly?"

Yuan Huyuan had grown noticeably hunched and only said, "I don’t know... Xizhi... I truly don’t know... She was so clever that she must have known all along."

Li Xizhi looked at his expression and sighed inwardly, Whether she went willingly or not no longer matters. She had to go, either way.
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝒆𝒘𝙚𝓫𝙣𝙤𝒗𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

As Li Xizhi briefly drifted in thought, Yuan Huyuan was already drenched in sweat. Li Xizhi cast a quiet glance at him and said in a low voice, "You tricked Yuan Chengdun into leaving, didn’t you?"

Yuan Huyuan lowered his eyes and answered, "Yes... He thought he was going to rescue Yuan Tuan, but in truth, it was because he also cultivated the Azure Manifestation Dao. The Dragon Clan believed having another Azure Manifestation cultivator would increase their chances..."

"Good." Li Xizhi understood and nodded. He cupped his hands, preparing to leave. Yuan Huyuan spoke as if trying to hold him back, "Xizhi... back then, when Yuan Tuan brought Chejing back, I personally escorted him. He even called me senior... Li Tongya treated me with respect... even Li Yuanping and Li Yuanjiao...

"I never imagined things would come to this..."

Li Xizhi simply cupped his hands in return and said softly, "Senior, the tides of the era bring gathering and parting. No personal feeling can stand in their way."

He withdrew the Demon Subduing Copper Rods from his sleeve and continued, "These belong to their rightful owner, please take care of them."

With that, Li Xizhi rode the wind and departed. Yuan Huyuan clutched his sleeves in unease, still dazed, when a strong herbal scent wafted over. Another figure had appeared before him.

This man had a broad face and graying temples, with numerous medicine pouches hanging from his robes. Tears covered his gentle, kindly face, and his reddened eyes silently watched Yuan Huyuan.

Yuan Huyuan could only kneel with a sorrowful cry and said, "Brother Yuansi!"

Xiao Yuansi couldn't speak, he merely waved his hand silently. The kind and honest old man reflected bitterly. Yuan Tuan had been missing for years, and not a single person had told him.

"It must have been orchestrated by that infallible Daoist Master of our family."

He cast a glance at Yuan Huyuan. Xiao Yuansi, never one to speak harshly, gently persuaded him to go home. Then he rode the wind alone, returning to the Xiao Family. He had completely forgotten what he’d originally come to this place to do.

In his mind, the scenery of Qingsui Peak from years ago resurfaced. Li Chejing reading with his sword in his arms, and Yuan Tuan tying his hair back, smiling brightly as she called him senior brother.

"A hundred years in the blink of an eye, and I no longer even have the right to protect the junior sister who remains," muttered Xiao Yuansi, returning alone to Xianyou Peak.

———

Mount Qingdu.

Li Xijun sat cross-legged beneath a pine tree, white snow drifting down upon his robes. After a moment, someone approached and respectfully said, "My lord, someone from Profound Peak Gate has arrived."

"Send them up," said Li Xijun.

Li Xijun waited briefly, and a strange young woman came forward. As expected, she was an envoy offering condolences for Li Xicheng’s passing. Among the Three Sects and Seven Gates, hers was the only one to do so.

"Kong Qiuyan of Profound Peak Gate. Greetings, Daoist friend." The woman appeared composed and confident, with a tall nose and delicate skin. She offered her respects before speaking gently, "I’ve long heard tales of the Li Family’s Radiant Frost Pine Snow. Now that I’ve seen you, I realize those weren’t exaggerated at all."

Li Xijun responded politely, returned a few compliments, and asked about Profound Peak's recent affairs. Kong Qiuyan answered gracefully and with appropriate formality, earning a slight nod from him.

In recent years, he had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and gradually taken control of Qingdu. With increasing public appearances, many surrounding families had heard his name. Though oddly enough, it wasn’t his abilities that first spread far and wide, but rather his graceful appearance. Eventually, every major power across several prefectures knew of the Li Family’s elegant, snow-clad young cultivator.

The woman also gave him a couple of glances before finishing her formalities and retreating. Li Xijun paid it no mind and asked, "Has Ximing emerged from seclusion and descended the mountain yet?"

Seeing the man nod, he rose with the wind and made his way down the mountain.

Li Xicheng’s funeral had been ongoing for several months. White mourning cloths hung throughout the family, and Li Family members from every township had returned. The event was grand in scale, and the central hall saw a constant flow of figures. It was mostly the family’s core members.

First, because Li Xicheng had supported many family men and was highly respected within the family. Second, because the second lineage was now in power, and Li Xicheng was the father of the current family head. So everyone felt the need to pay their respects.

White cloths also hung in the central hall, fluttering gently in the air. Li Xijun descended amid wind and snow, landing at the front steps just as he crossed paths with Li Zhouwei, who was slowly walking forward with a halberd in hand.

"Eighth Uncle!" Li Zhouwei nodded and cupped his hands in greeting. Li Xijun helped him up with a soft nod, then followed him inside. Several others had already arrived and were quietly waiting.

Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong were absent, and Li Xuanxuan refused to take the main seat. As Li Xizhi had returned rarely, and with Li Xijun now present, everyone turned their gaze toward Li Xizhi. But he only glanced around, shook his head and said softly, "I cultivate in Azure Pond Sect and am not suited to preside, let the eighth brother take the seat instead."

Li Xijun could only nod and take the seat. Famous for his handsome appearance, snowlights danced around him. At his sides stood Li Xizhi who was graceful and radiant in heavenly glow, and Li Ximing, wreathed in crimson pill-fire, arms folded.

Li Ximing had just emerged from seclusion and was already at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. His cultivation speed was remarkable, and he had begun exploring secret techniques and pill arts, making him now one of the most powerful in the family.

Aside from Li Xuanfeng, both Li Qinghong and Li Ximing were in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Then came Li Xizhi and Li Wushao at the mid-stage, followed by Li Xijun in the early stage.

If Kongheng was included, the Li Family’s current Foundation Establishment Realm strength could be considered quite formidable.

Li Ximing had just received news of his elder brother’s death. Each time he emerged from seclusion, great events seemed to have occurred, and now he still felt somewhat dazed. Li Xizhi was already speaking softly, "From what I’ve heard, Shangyuan has successfully broken through, likely attaining the Jade True Fruition Attainment. He was besieged by Pristine Water, Taiyuan, and Taiyi. Two early stage Golden Core Realm cultivators and one late stage Golden Core Realm cultivator..."

He paused briefly and continued softly, "But one who has Fruition Attainment is not so easily slain. In years past, even when Yingze killed the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch, it still had to be split into three parts. How much more so with someone like him..."

After saying this, Li Xizhi drew a letter from his robes and said quietly, "My master... the soul lamp in the sect has gone out. In a few days, I may have to return to take up the position of Qingsui Peak Master. I cannot stay long."




# Chapter 731: Chaos

Just as he finished speaking, the sky outside the central hall suddenly flashed. Several streaks of light flew from north to esouth, leaving long trails across the sky. To the south, five bursts of Heavenly Glow rose into the air, dyeing half the sky red.

As the Heavenly Glow drew near, its true form was revealed. A cloudship wreathed in golden light, with wings like mist unfurled at its sides. It cut through layers of cloud, and atop it stood a gathering of shadowy figures.

"The Dawn Cloudliner..."

Li Xizhi frowned and glanced upward. The command token at his waist began to glow, each engraved character lit up one by one. His expression turned grave as he stared intently at the sky.

Figures scattered across the Dawn Cloudliner, and dazzling lights streamed southward from the north. Li Xizhi calmed his brothers, then rose on his own ribbon of glow, cloaked in swirling mist, and approached the cloudship.

He activated the glow in his hand and channeled his command token. Immediately, someone aboard the ship rode the wind over to him. The man's face was somewhat familiar. After a moment of scrutiny, he recognized Li Xizhi as well.

The man was short and plump, with a well-fed appearance. As he neared Li Xizhi, he opened his mouth and said, "Daoist friend..."

Only then did he recognize Li Xizhi’s cultivation level. His expression changed at once, plastering on a wide smile as he respectfully said, "Ah! Greetings, Senior! It's been so many years... and you've already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

"So it’s you!" exclaimed Li Xizhi.

The man before him was Yu Fuyu of Lingdou Peak. Years ago, when Li Xizhi had still been in the Qi Cultivation Realm, he had arranged a trade of sect duties with this very man to secure a trip home.

Though he was from the Yu Family, he had long severed ties with them, living modestly and alone. Afraid of Li Xizhi’s background, he now greeted him with excessive deference, "Senior, your cultivation has progressed with incredible speed!"

Though Li Xizhi’s progress had been swift, he couldn’t compare to his own younger brother and was considered only upper-mid tier within the sect. He paid no mind to the flattery and asked directly, "What’s going on here?"

Yu Fuyu quickly said, "Senior, Yue Cultivating Sect has sealed its mountains and withdrawn deep inside. All cultivators stationed from the north of Xu State to the Eastern Sea have pulled out completely, they’ve abandoned the front entirely.

"As a result, the large swath of Buddhist cultivators in northern Yue State, along with the devil cultivators who’ve been fleeing there year after year, are now completely unsupervised. They’ve already pushed into Xu State!"

He seemed almost animated, saying, "With Yue Cultivating Sect sealing itself off, they’ve tossed all former agreements aside. The nine seaward passes are completely unguarded, without a word of warning. The route from the Eastern Sea to Xu State is wide open, and who knows what kind of chaos is erupting now."

He even showed a hint of pity as he continued, "Poor Xu State... After decades of recovering from turmoil and finally showing some promise, now it’s going to fall into a sea of blood once more."

Li Xizhi felt uneasy hearing this, but the scene before him was becoming clearer. He asked, "So the sect has intervened?"

"Exactly!" Yu Fuyu replied, "Not just Azure Pond Sect, even the Golden Feather Sect has made a move."

Li Xizhi silently calculated the situation, then said with a sigh, "This is getting serious. Have any Purple Mansion Realm cultivators made a move? Has there been any new Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the sect?"

"None that I’ve seen!" Yu Fuyu nodded repeatedly and quickly added, "Quite a few seniors who attempted breakthroughs have fallen, many of them well-known figures. Like Li Encheng, the Water Wall Pearl, and Mo Chen, the Golden Profound Eagle..."

At this, Li Xizhi’s heart gave a sudden jolt. He thought to himself, So Li Encheng really did fail... Ah, it was something I’d long suspected...

Though thoughts stirred in his heart, his expression remained calm and focused, giving nothing away. The old man before him noticed nothing and went on eagerly, saying, "We’re just the advance group heading to Xu State. The sect has summoned all peak masters, each peak has been assigned duties. Someone’s probably already on their way to fetch you, Senior."

Li Xizhi gave a slight nod. Seeing that the cloudship was about to cross into Xu State, he prepared to ride the wind away, but Yu Fuyu grew anxious and quickly said, "Senior! My Lingdou Peak... we had strong ties with Qingsui in the past! My martial uncle and family elder, Yu Yuxie... he was a close friend of Senior Si Yuanbai...

"I... I’m no good at combat..."

Li Xizhi paused slightly, realization dawning. He thought, So this cloudship is full of those aging cultivators who loaf around the sect... now they’ve been sent to Xu State as the vanguard, it won’t end well for them. No wonder he’s so desperate.

Seeing Yu Fuyu’s tearful expression, Li Xizhi merely said softly, "This isn’t something I can decide on my own. I’ll have to return to the sect first and inquire more carefully. If I can help you find a less dangerous posting, I’ll do what I can."

After he said this, it was clear Yu Fuyu didn’t fully believe him. He barely managed to offer a couple words of thanks before Li Xizhi disappeared on a streak of glow, leaving Yu Fuyu standing there in a daze.

Moments later, a man in platinum-white armor emerged from the ship’s cabin, wielding a long halberd and exuding a commanding presence. He swept his gaze across the crowd, pointed at two people, and said quietly, "You... and you. Come with me."

Tang Shedu! As that finger pointed toward him, a chill ran down Yu Fuyu’s spine.

Li Xizhi descended on the wind and reentered the hall, where his brothers awaited. Seeing the grave look on his face, they exchanged glances. Li Xizhi quietly conveyed the news, and at the head of the hall, Li Xijun pulled out a map.

Xu State was situated between the Wu, Yue, and Zhao States, with a great river running through it. It bordered the Yue Cultivating, Golden Feather, Azure Pond, and several Buddhist and Daoist sects. The point where Azure Pond Sect touched Xu State, right in the middle, was Moongaze Lake.

Now that Yue Cultivating Sect had retracted its forces, it had effectively abandoned most of Xu State, leaving only the isolated Golden Tang Gate behind. Northern Yue had become a blank void, and where the Profound Peak Gate met the Eastern Sea, the shoreline was now untended wilderness. All of the areas connecting to Xu State were about to descend into chaos.

The territory was vast, nearly as large as the entire influence range of Azure Pond Sect. And it sat just north of Moongaze Lake and the Xiao Family.

Li Xijun studied the map closely, his expression grim and his voice heavy, "I’m afraid this won’t bode well for us."

The Li Family and Xiao Family had become the shield of the Azure Pond Sect. In the turmoil to come, they would not escape unscathed. What’s worse, their family had long been enemies with the Buddhist cultivators and now that Yue Cultivating Sect had opened the way, those Buddhist sects could march southward unchecked.

Everyone present had clearly thought the same and remained silent. Li Xizhi sighed and reminded them, "This won’t be simple. Azure Pond Sect will definitely summon every family to contribute forces and send them to Xu State... our family won’t be exempt."

Li Xizhi appeared deeply troubled and said softly, "Beyond that, something big may be brewing... The Three Sects and Seven Gates are stirring restlessly, I doubt there will be peace for long."

The refined man beside him gently shook his head and said warmly, "A time of chaos is coming..."

He paused, hesitating briefly, then said in a low voice, "There is news. Li Encheng has passed."

Li Encheng had been a key connection the Li Family built in the past, thought to be useful when the time came. But fate was unpredictable. By the time of his final meditation, no opportunity had ever arisen to make use of that bond.

Instead, the Li Family had poured quite a bit into him. When he made his final breakthrough attempt, they even sent him a batch of spirit items. Now with this news, all of that had gone to waste.

Li Xuanxuan, listening closely, said in a low voice, "It’s not a total loss... He did give me an Essence Gathering Pill, so at least he didn’t take our help for nothing."

Li Xizhi, occupied with preparing to return to the sect for inquiries, didn’t linger. He cupped his hands to the others and said softly, "Keep watch over the family for now and await my letter."

Li Qinghong rode thunder through the skies for a while, noticing that the seawater beneath her was receding at an extremely slow rate. It was so slow that, without close observation, one might not even realize the sea was slowly drawing back.

"It’s most likely the Dragon Clan making a move. According to the old agreements, everything beneath the sea belongs to them. With the sea receding like this, who knows how many treasures will be lost in just ten days or half a month," she muttered.

She then recalled the spiritual omen of the Eastern Sea, Falling Water, Rising Storm, and found it curious. She had thought it referred to heavy rainfall, but now the sea itself was truly falling, and thunder rumbled even more powerfully overhead.

Continuing to ride the thunder, the Qunyi Strait appeared before her. The once-scattered islets that could barely support a single person were now fully exposed due to the receding tide, revealing vast stretches of shoreline.

Flying another thousand miles eastward, the distant silhouette of Shiqi Island in the Qunyi Strait came into view, followed by the emergence of a large island ahead.

The island was shielded by a radiant golden-red formation, glowing with brilliance. On the newly exposed land from the receding sea, a group of fishermen moved about, dragging brown nets, their faint laughter carrying through the air.

But the laughter quickly vanished as her cultivator aura became visible. Those mortals fell to their knees in fear. Before Li Qinghong could speak, a streak of gold-white light shot toward her.

It was a young woman, about seventeen or eighteen, still youthful in appearance. She held a small golden ring and rode the wind toward Li Qinghong. Eyeing Li Qinghong warily, she asked, "Senior... are you here seeking someone, or...?"

Seeing how guarded the girl was, Li Qinghong responded softly, "I am Li Qinghong, a cultivator from the mainland. I’ve come this time... to inquire about some treasure-related news."

"A mainland cultivator..." These words caused the girl’s brows to relax slightly. She bowed respectfully and replied, "This junior, Cui Wanqing, greets Senior!"

Cui Wanqing paused, a trace of doubt in her eyes, and asked, "Senior... which Li Family do you belong to?"

Li Qinghong paused briefly before replying, "The Moongaze Li Family."

Cui Wanqing silently repeated the four words, guiding her toward the island as she muttered, "I’ve heard there's a great marsh in the mainland called Moongaze... could it be that one?"

Li Qinghong nodded and replied softly, "Correct. The marsh has dried up, leaving only a lake. My family cultivates beside it."

Cui Wanqing nodded thoughtfully and said quietly, "That makes sense. With no one holding the Water Mansion Fruition Attainment, it’s natural that the wetlands would wither."

From her words, it was clear she had inherited knowledge. Li Qinghong followed her down and took a seat in the courtyard while Cui Wanqing went to summon her elders.

This was, after all, the Eastern Sea, where everyone remained cautious of one another. Naturally, Li Qinghong wouldn’t recklessly step into someone else’s formation. The hall Cui Wanqing chose was specifically built on the island for receiving visitors, located safely outside the family’s protective array.

Soon after, an elder appeared at the edge of the courtyard. With solemn white whiskers and a stately posture, he wore a light blue robe. He was tall and spoke in a deep, composed voice, "I am Cui Changfu of Chongzhou Island. Greetings, Daoist friend."

The elder appeared to be of considerable age, with a cultivation at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. His aura was imposing, and as he appraised Li Qinghong, his gaze paused for a moment on the jade bottle at her waist.

Li Qinghong of Moongaze Lake.

Sensing that this elder might be difficult to deal with, Li Qinghong kept silent until the old man sighed and said, "Then Wei Lixun has arrived, has he?"

His tone was strange, and for a moment, Li Qinghong didn’t know how to respond. She simply shook her head lightly. The elder then said, "Please allow me to examine the dharma bottle."

Li Qinghong hesitated but removed it. Still, she grew tense as she worried that this elder, upon seeing the dharma artifact, might covet it and try to seize it from her. She said nothing, her silence heavy with caution.

Cui Changfu paused slightly, then seemed to understand and spoke gently, "The Cui Family of Chongzhou is currently under the protection of the Dragon Clan. We’re not too big, but not insignificant either. We still care about our reputation. I, Cui Changfu, am pretty well known in these waters... I wouldn’t act against someone over a mere Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact.

"Besides... judging by your bearing, I doubt your family is some powerless little force in the mainland."

Li Qinghong subtly assessed the terrain, gauging her distance from the formation. If the man before her were to suddenly attack, she might not win, but with her thunder-riding speed, she was confident she could at least escape. Only then did she relax slightly.

She nodded, offered a few polite remarks, and carefully handed over the dharma artifact. Cui Changfu took it, weighed it in his hand, and dimmed its glow before flipping it over.

The purple, vein-like patterns slowly dimmed, revealing several ancient seal-script characters, ‘Li Qianyuan of the Wei State Li Family.’ Cui Wanqing let out a soft gasp and exclaimed, "The Ancestor of Wei, Li Qianyuan!"

Both of their expressions turned complex, but in Li Qinghong’s ears, the name struck like thunder in a calm sky. She stood stunned for a full breath, "The Ancestor of Wei?"

Of course, Li Qinghong had always known her bottle wasn’t ordinary, that it had once belonged to a cultivator from the Wei State Li Family but she had never imagined it had such a prestigious origin.

Cui Changfu returned it and said in a calm voice, "But the Wei Emperor was no ordinary figure, he wouldn’t have used a mere Foundation Establishment Realm artifact. The authenticity of this item remains questionable.

"After all, I’ve never heard that the Wei Emperor had a dharma artifact shaped like a bottle. Either it was something he used early in life, or it’s a replica crafted by later generations."

At those words, Li Qinghong immediately felt relief, as though a great weight had lifted from her shoulders. She thought, Those True Monarchs... how many of them are simple? If something of his ended up in my hands, it must’ve been part of some grand plan. Even if this one has been dead for years... who can say what immortal arts a True Monarch left behind?

Oddly enough, the possibility that the artifact was a fake brought her comfort. She nodded slightly and tucked it back into her sleeve. Meanwhile, Cui Changfu was studying her closely, watching the subtle shifts in her expression.

Having survived in the Eastern Sea for so many years, Cui Changfu was no fool. His guard had been up from the start, and he thought to himself, Anyone with family history would know about the Cui Clan’s old ties with the Wei State Li Family. This woman’s artifact is far too conspicuous... I have to be cautious that she isn’t posing as a descendant of the Wei State Li Family to exploit us.

But seeing her subtle shifts in expression unfold naturally, he couldn’t quite make up his mind. In the end, he chose to wait and test further. He asked, "And what brings Daoist friend here, if I may ask?"

Li Qinghong nodded and answered directly, not bothering with further pleasantries, "I heard your lineage cultivates in Bright Yang across generations. My family lacks a Bright Yang treasure... so I’ve come here to inquire about it."




# Chapter 733: Peak Master

Li Qinghong finished speaking, and Cui Changfu grew suspicious, asking softly, “Fellow Daoist... what kind of spirit item are you seeking?”

Li Qinghong replied softly, “These things are hard to find inland from the Western Sea. They are Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm spirit items such as the Radiant Celestial Stone, Qilin Crow Spirit Husk, or White Blood Sap... No need for anything specific, just one of them will do.”

Upon hearing this, Cui Changfu’s expression eased slightly, and he said with a smile, “A Purple Mansion Realm spirit item? I once had a dose of Radiance Profound Essence... but it’s gone now!”

Li Qinghong was seeking these items to help a younger family member break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. It weighed on her mind. Although Purple Mansion Realm spirit items were hard to come by and she hadn’t held much hope, hearing this gave her a spark of interest. Her expression lit up and she asked, “Has it been traded to someone? Please share any information that you have...”

Cui Changfu finally believed her, this woman was indeed here for a spirit item. He seemed relieved and much less wary, speaking in a low voice, “Our branch... was once sent by Wei State’s Emperor Gong to venture beyond the outer seas, searching for Penglai. Emperor Gong was broad-minded and elegant. His reign was prosperous and generous, so our treasure ship carried many rare items.

“Later, chaos engulfed the sea, the Great Void shattered, and we lost contact. By the time the Qi State replaced Wei State, there was no news at all. The spirit items we had were used up one by one, until only two portions of Radiance Profound Essence remained.”

Li Qinghong listened closely as he continued, “One portion was given long ago to the Dragon family. Dongfang You drank it and gave birth to Dingyuan the Dragon Son. The other portion was sent to Mount Changhuai, where a Daoist Master used it to sire a child, who I’ve heard is called Qing Jifang. It was all thanks to the Radiance Profound Essence.”

Li Qinghong listened for a while and realized both doses had already been used. She was immediately disappointed. Cui Changfu noticed this and said softly, “Don’t be discouraged, Fellow Daoist... When the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven fell, I heard it was overseen by the two Daoist Masters, Yuan Su and Qiushui. That grotto heaven surely contained Purple Mansion Realm spirit items... Even if Chu Yi looted most of it, the Daoist Masters went there afterward. Surely they got their hands on something.”

When Cui Changfu mentioned Chu Yi, his tone grew awkward, his lips quivered slightly and he lowered his eyes. Yet his words were like a bell ringing through a dream. Li Qinghong suddenly understood and her heart lit up with joy, That’s it!

She hadn’t known before that the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven had passed through Yuan Su’s hands. Now that she realized it, he must surely possess Purple Mansion Realm spirit items. And since her second uncle served under Yuan Su, asking for them might not be too difficult.

At the moment, she cupped her hands in thanks and said, “Many thanks, Senior!”

Cui Changfu gave her a close look, stroked his beard, and nodded. Li Qinghong hesitated for a moment but still spoke up, “There is one more matter... My family also cultivates under the Bright Yang Dao Lineage. We are hoping to gather five Immortal Foundations to pave a smoother path for our family...”

Since the request wasn’t an easy one, she lowered her stance and continued softly, “If it’s convenient, I hope to borrow access to your esteemed family’s Dao lineage. We can exchange it with techniques... or dharma artifacts, or even spirit items. Whatever your family desires.

“If you are unwilling, I have no intention whatsoever of prying into your Dao lineage...”

Li Qinghong added a few more apologetic words. Cui Wanqing’s expression remained fairly warm, even slightly moved. But the old man of the Cui Family did not have the best look on his face. Cui Changfu responded in a hoarse voice, “I’m afraid, our ancestral Dao lineage cannot be shared.”

He rejected her firmly. Li Qinghong apologized, then took a spirit flower from her storage pouch and handed it to the two of them, saying softly, “Thank you for the information, Senior. This is the Wanglin Blossom, it can preserve life and ease sorrow. Please accept it as a token of gratitude.”
𝕗𝗿𝕖𝐞𝐰𝗲𝕓𝐧𝕠𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝐨𝚖

Fearing her prolonged presence might cause unease, she rode lightning into the sky and took her leave. Cui Wanqing seemed to have a good impression of her and saw her off, gently saying, “Take care, Senior.”

After sending Li Qinghong off, Cui Wanqing returned to the island only to see Cui Changfu still sitting where he was, tapping the table restlessly. His aged eyes were full of unease.

Curious, Cui Wanqing sat down beside the old man and asked softly, “Grandfather... this Senior Qinghong seems like a straightforward person. Her family has quite a few people with Bright Yang Dao Lineage. It’s not like they’re all one-of-a-kind. At worst, sharing one could be mutually beneficial...”

“Sigh...” Cui Changfu stroked his beard and didn’t respond immediately. He said in a low voice, “She may truly be a remnant of Wei's Li descendent...”

He pulled out a jade slip from his storage pouch, examined it carefully, then took out a map and studied it closely. He murmured, “Moongaze Marsh lies in Jiangnan. When Emperor Wu campaigned south, he passed through there... and met immortals within the marsh. Could a surviving bloodline really remain?”

Cui Wanqing was visibly moved and said quietly, “If she’s truly from the imperial family of old, Grandfather, why not help them? At most, it’s just a technique being exchanged... and we’d gain something in return anyway...”

Cui Changfu shook his head and said softly, “Not anymore...”

His expression suddenly became animated, his eyes sharp and piercing as he said, “Wasn’t the pain already enough? When Northern Qi State replaced Wei State, Li Xunquan raised an army in rebellion. Our ancestors crossed the seas carrying precious treasures to aid him, only to have their heads hung over Dianyang City for nine years, never taken down.

“When Li Xuan restored the empire, our great ancestors rushed to his side, taking with him two brilliant great-uncles. The kingdom fell again and they were slain. We lost three dharma artifacts, and even our treasure ship was left behind in Xu State.

“When the Dongli Sect was founded, my grandfather hadn’t even reached the Purple Mansion Realm. He rode the wind to join them, handed over all of Chongzhou Island to the Dongli Sect only for the Dongli Daoist Master to die suddenly. The sect to collapse and my grandfather perished in battle. If Dongfang You hadn’t come seeking a spirit item just then, we would have already...”

He sighed and said softly, “At this point, we truly can’t afford any more turmoil!”

Cui Changfu’s expression grew grim as he continued, “Moongaze Marsh lies in a land torn by four powers. Taiyi to the west, Taiqing to the south and east, and the Seven Releases to the north. What good position is that? Even Li Xunquan had True Monarchs aiding him and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators following him. Yet he still lost and died in defeat...

“This one is at least wise, not driven by greed to openly claim the name of Wei Li... but that’s as far as it should go. Only disaster awaits if we get too deeply involved with them!”

After hearing this, Cui Wanqing could only sigh and nod. Then she heard Cui Changfu say, “We must preserve our remaining lineage, only then will there be a chance to restore what was lost. If we follow any passing branch of the Wei Li bloodline without caution, that would be blind folly, with no hope at all!”

The conversation between the two members of the Cui family in Chongzhou naturally didn’t reach Li Qinghong’s ears. She rode the wind back on her journey, feeling a twinge of disappointment.

She had only made the request in the hope that the longstanding friendship between the Li and Cui Families might help. Even hearing a condition would’ve been something.

But Cui Changfu clearly wanted nothing to do with any karmic entanglements. His tone showed no softness. Li Qinghong saw this clearly, thus she didn’t push the matter and quickly took her leave.

“After all, so many years have passed, and the Cui Family suffered plenty of entanglements. They won’t trust easily...” muttered Li Qinghong.

The last immortal-devil war had ended with the Battle of Pingming Ford. Then Northern Qi replaced Wei, only to fall to Liang, which in turn was destroyed by Emperor Zhao’s father Fu Qiyan and King Yan, Murong Dechang. That was over sixteen hundred years ago. If the world hadn’t changed since, even a True Monarch would have long passed away, perhaps the old bonds had faded with time.

Later, when Dongli Sect was destroyed, many from the Cui Family died too. Showing even a decent attitude when facing someone from the Li Family, whose identity might not even be real... that’s already more than fair.

Thinking this way, Li Qinghong felt the Cui family’s reaction was understandable. She glanced westward and suddenly saw several Dawn Cloudliners tearing through the sky, leaving trails of Heavenly Glow behind.

The cloudliner was massive and radiated colorful light. Having paid tribute to one before, Li Qinghong instantly recognized it as the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner. Her heart jumped in alarm, Something’s happened inland!

Azure Pond Sect.

Azure Pond Sect was usually shrouded in mist and clear clouds. But perhaps due to the repeated failures and deaths during the breakthrough attempts to the Foundation Establishment Realm in recent months, the clouds now seemed much thinner.

From within the distant clouds, a streak of Heavenly Glow sped forth with six-colored trails. The man atop it was elegant and noble, it was none other than Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi, riding the Heavenly Glow, rushed back from outside. As he entered the sect, he saw people bustling around. Landing atop Qingsui Peak, he was quickly greeted by his junior brother Yuan Chengzhao.

Yuan Chengzhao had not yet broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he was at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm. Holding a dharma artifact in hand, he looked a bit flustered.

Among this generation of the Yuan Family, only Yuan Chengdun had unmatched strength. He was one of the rare cultivators capable of contending with direct disciples of the great sects. Unfortunately, he had perished in the Eastern Sea. Of the remaining younger ones, only Yuan Chengzhao had any chance of a breakthrough.

The Yuan Family’s former pillar, Yuan Tuan, had also fallen in the Eastern Sea. Though the family's numbers remained intact, with these two core figures gone, they had no strong Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators left to speak of.
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝓮𝒘𝙚𝙗𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝒐𝙢

Though they now had the Chi Family’s support, pressure still loomed large. Yuan Chengzhao, staying in the sect, felt especially awkward. He sat blankly atop the peak and was unsure of how to face anyone.

Now, seeing his senior brother Li Xizhi, he was at even more of a loss, fumbling as he spoke, “Senior brother... I truly don’t know anything about the family’s affairs!”

“None of this is your fault, of course.” Li Xizhi frowned slightly, noticing with sharp eyes that Yuan Chengzhao’s clothes were thin yet immaculately white. It was subtly of higher quality than the average sect disciple’s garb.

He smiled gently and said, “What’s this? You’ve got new clothes now, I see.”

Yuan Chengzhao finally realized what was happening and was momentarily speechless. He then said in a low voice, “I... this... senior brother! Come with me up the mountain!”

Li Xizhi’s smile gradually faded. He followed quietly behind until they reached the small pavilion at the mountaintop, where the lights were dim and a piece of clothing lay draped messily over the desk.

Li Xizhi knew this little room like the back of his hand. With just one glance, he noticed that the sharp green-bladed sword that once hung on the wall had been taken down, it was nowhere to be seen.

Sweat formed on Yuan Chengzhao’s brow. He led Li Xizhi inside and, upon reaching the desk, dropped to his knees with a thud. He bowed in silence.

Li Xizhi seemed to have expected this. His expression was calm as his gaze swept over the robe draped on the desk.

The robe was a pale bluish-green, seamless in its make and glowed faintly with multicolored light. A silver ornament dangled awkwardly from the waist, haphazardly tossed on the corner of the desk.

Of course, Li Xizhi knew exactly what this garment was, it was the robe of the peak master.

Looking again at Yuan Chengzhao’s inner garments that were pure white and flowing, it was clear they were part of the same set as the robe on the desk. But with Li Xizhi’s sudden return, Yuan Chengzhao had only managed to remove the outer robe in a hurry, forgetting about the underlayer before rushing to meet him.

“Senior brother...”

The contrast made everything obvious. Yuan Chengzhao kept his head very low, sweating profusely. Yet Li Xizhi didn’t seem angry. His voice was cool as he asked, “The sword?”

Compared to the peak master’s position, it seemed he cared more about the sword that used to hang on the wall, the one once wielded by Li Chejing.

With Yuan Tuan’s whereabouts uncertain, Yuan Chengzhao had long lived under the discipline of his senior brother Li Xizhi, and had a deep sense of awe toward him. Now he was stumbling over his words.

“I... I...”

Although this senior brother was graceful and refined, back when he’d misbehaved, Li Xizhi had truly scolded him coldly and disciplined him with a ruler. Now, with red-rimmed eyes, he trembled as he said, “Senior brother! The Chi Family is coming... I was afraid they’d recognize uncle’s sword... so I hid it ahead of time!”

He hurriedly retrieved the sword from his storage pouch and offered it with both hands. Before Li Chejing had forged his spirit sword, he had used this very one to cultivate the Profound Water Sword Technique. The blade was simple, without any ornate designs.

Li Xizhi received it with both hands, then took out a jade box from his own storage pouch and carefully stored the sword away before speaking gently, “The Chi Family personally appointed you?”

Yuan Chengzhao nodded repeatedly, forcing himself to respond, “Yes... yes! They used the family as leverage, saying I absolutely had to take the peak master’s position...”

“Mm.” Li Xizhi’s expression didn’t change much. He nodded lightly, used one hand to help him up, and with the other, lifted the green robe from the desk and draped it over him, smiling as he said, “You, your cultivation is still a bit lacking. Once you reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, you’ll be able to hold the stage properly.”

Yuan Chengzhao began sweating even more, beads falling down as he muttered, “Senior brother! This was meant to be yours... I know the Master thought the same... it’s always been yours. I... I... had no power to resist...”

“What’s mine or yours!” Li Xizhi chuckled softly, patted his shoulder, and said gently, “I’ve returned after completing my task and still need to report to the main hall. Peak Master Yuan, you wait here first. Once I’m back, you and I shall have a proper drink.”

Yuan Chengzhao was at a complete loss and simply nodded. It wasn’t until Li Xizhi rode off on the Heavenly Glow light that he hastily pulled off the outer robe and tossed it back onto the desk, feeling as if he were in a dream, “Senior brother’s not angry at me... thank the heavens...”

He sat there dazed for a while, staring at the silver pendant that symbolized the position of peak master. His hands grew hot with excitement, and he couldn’t help but touch it twice.

Meanwhile, Li Xizhi rose on the wind, stepping through the moonlight and glow. His expression was gentle, but his eyes were cold. One hand was clasped behind his back, posture poised as he thought, Trying to manipulate me? You think this was Chi Zhiyun’s oversight? Unlikely!

What a clever ploy... Chengzhao’s not cunning, and he craves status, it’s only natural he’d fall into this trap. Qingsui Peak is still in the hands of the Yuan Family... nine out of ten, this was a reward for them. And in the end, they still get to strike a blow at me...

He looked refined and calm, wearing just the right trace of displeasure on his face, but inside there was no anger but only a cold smirk.

My Li Family has seven Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, the Profound Thunder Golden Bow, Bright Yang Rainbow Mist, and ties to the Xiao family in the east. Should anything arise, we could even force the Xiao, Ning, or Yang Families to intervene. We have so many cultivators across the peaks of Moongaze Lake. They’re a gift from the heavens, the perfect shield. Who among them would willingly give that up?

At this moment, the calm elegance Li Xizhi had cultivated since youth remained flawless, but inwardly his mind was calculating with precision. He was, after all, the son of Li Yuanjiao. On the surface, he seemed gentle but underneath, he had already seen everything with piercing clarity, At such a desperate moment, what else could this be but one hand wielding the stick, the other offering the sweet date? Very well... let’s see what kind of performance the esteemed masters put on next!




# Chapter 735: Changtian Peak

Li Xizhi first arrived at the General Affairs Hall and returned the jade token. The cultivator in charge nodded politely and said respectfully, “Greetings, Daoist... your cultivation truly progresses with remarkable speed.”

Li Xizhi nodded slightly, and the man continued, “However, the merit you’ve earned will have to be withheld for now...”

Before Li Xizhi could ask, he quickly added, “The sect sent someone to investigate. They found that you hadn’t been on your peak for nearly half a year, and that you’d gone to Xia Mountain to gather glow for personal affairs, this was reported to the main peak.

“It was Daoist Chi Liangzhe of Hongda Peak who reported it... and the matter reached the sect master himself, who’s considering punishment.”

Li Xizhi had already expected someone would seize this issue to make trouble, so he wasn’t surprised. He asked, “Very well. Am I to be sent to Yuanxing Peak?”

The man shook his head repeatedly and said in a low voice, “This matter didn’t spread because the sect master suppressed it. He left a message here, asking you to visit the main hall upon your return.”

Li Xizhi nodded, said nothing more and rode his Heavenly Glow toward the Azure Pond Sect’s main hall. Mist swirled atop the jade tiles. A figure stood within. Li Xizhi waited a moment before the dragon-carved and phoenix-painted doors until he was finally allowed in.

He walked slowly into the hall, straightened his sleeves, and bowed loudly, “Xizhi greets the Sect Master!”

The man above had already risen and came down quickly, using both hands to help him up, speaking gently, “No need for such formality.”

Li Xizhi rose accordingly and met his gaze. He saw a face with upright features and a neatly trimmed beard, eyes full of warmth. He lowered his gaze and said, “I stand as one awaiting punishment! I dare not speak freely!”

Chi Zhiyun, however, took the chance to observe those handsome, slightly narrowed eyes, elegantly arched brows and composed bearing. Then he thought to himself, Just as the rumors say. He is not someone to provoke lightly.

Chi Zhiyun simply smiled and said, “I’ve long heard of your reputation, Xizhi, and have been looking forward to meeting you! But you’ve often been away on tasks, and we’ve kept missing each other, only now do I finally get to see you.”

Li Xizhi cupped his hands in salute, but Chi Zhiyun waved it off, cutting him short and pausing before saying, “That task at Xia Mountain was assigned by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it was no personal errand... but some petty men are using it to slander you...”

He lifted his head and said with a laugh, “If it had been them, they’d have offered up their lives and fortunes at a single order from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. What face do they have to judge you? Of course I would never believe them!”

Li Xizhi made a show of gratitude, nodding with a slight bow. Chi Zhiyun came forward eagerly, gripped his arm, and said in a low voice, “I know you’ve heard all kinds of rumors, saying the Chi Family meant to harm you... Sigh, this really is my fault.

“Some in my family still hold grudges from the past, thinking Chejing shamed me. What kind of logic is that? They lack perspective. When I went into seclusion, they deliberately sent you away... and snatched Qingsui Peak.”

Chi Zhiyun looked deeply embarrassed, painting a picture of remorse on his face, though his eyes remained alert, quietly studying Li Xizhi’s expression as he said with a sigh, “As fate would have it, you never ended up going to the Qunyi... and it was the Han Family brothers who paid the price instead!”

Li Xizhi asked in confusion, “Qunyi? What happened there? I only heard the Han Family was present... Ah, they were searching for news of my master on Azure Pond Sect’s behalf.”

Chi Zhiyun sighed and said, “The Han Family’s master and servant both died! While investigating, they ran straight into the Dragon Clan’s hands! You weren’t there at the time... If you had been, you could’ve used your Azure Pond Sect’s credentials to get them out safely... What a pity!

“Those fools, in trying to push you aside and seize Qingsui Peak, ended up getting the Han Family killed instead!”

Li Xizhi appeared visibly shocked but inwardly applauded him, What a clever redirection! What a graceful misdirection about ‘saving them had I been there’... If I hadn’t actually gone myself, I really might’ve been fooled!

Outwardly, Li Xizhi only showed sorrow, saying softly, “It seems I’ve caused their deaths...”

Chi Zhiyun patted his shoulder and said gently, “This was my oversight in the end. I asked you here today to make it right, to restore fairness and return the peak master position to you!”

“I dare not!” said Li Xizhi. How could Li Xizhi accept that now? His heart turned cold. If he reclaimed the position so directly, that would no longer be a mere falling-out with the Yuan Family, it would be a full-blown feud!

From then on, the Yuan Family wouldn’t just distance themselves from the Li Family, they would truly hate them and the Li Family would find itself beset on all sides. So he let guilt fill his face, choking with emotion as he said, “I’ve thought it through... Putting aside grudges and resentment, my master always valued the family above all. The Yuan Family is in a difficult spot, if she could choose, she’d choose our junior brother too... I’ve toiled in the Eastern Sea all this time and still haven’t found my master, not even a whisper... I’ve no face left to be a peak master!”

Chi Zhiyun shook his head repeatedly and said in a sorrowful tone, “Xizhi... the world is full of helpless things. We must learn to let go... Back then... there was more to Chejing’s case than you know... I too was powerless!”

Li Xizhi showed just the right trace of curiosity on his face, and Chi Zhiyun immediately changed the topic, speaking solemnly, “Since you won’t take back Qingsui Peak, there are still empty seats among the Thirty-Six Peaks. Zhang Lingshu of Changtian Peak just died in the Eastern Sea, and his Dao lineage was severed. So I’m assigning that peak to you!”

Just as Chi Zhiyun finished speaking, Li Xizhi didn’t immediately give thanks. Instead, he feigned a look of being deeply moved and asked, “May I ask which Dao lineage it belongs to...”

“Oh, it came from a rogue cultivator. Zhang Lingshu was an only daughter,” replied Chi Zhiyun.

Li Xizhi nodded repeatedly, appearing touched as he said, “Thank you, Sect Master! I am truly grateful...”

Chi Zhiyun was smiling as he stroked his beard when someone below interrupted. An elegantly dressed man stepped forward and respectfully said, “Sect Master! To the east...”

Only then did he notice Li Xizhi in the room. Startled, he fell silent at once. Li Xizhi immediately recognized him as Ning Heyuan of the Ning family, now showing great deference toward Chi Zhiyun.

Chi Zhiyun said warmly, “Xizhi, you may go for now... My younger brother is already waiting below, just follow him.”

Li Xizhi bowed respectfully and withdrew. Ning Heyuan kept his gaze lowered in silence. Chi Zhiyun, smiling inwardly, waved his hand and listened as Ning Heyuan began his report, “Sect Master... there’s trouble at Crimson Reef Island and Great Xiukui Temple... Lin Chensheng killed Guo Hong’er on an Eastern Sea island. Red rain filled the sky and it caused quite a stir. It seems a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator intervened.”

Chi Zhiyun seemed to already know. He calmly turned the jade talisman in his hand and said softly, “The east and west sides of Crimson Reef have long been at odds. Guo Shentong hasn’t appeared for ages... this was bound to happen eventually.”

Ning Heyuan finished reporting a few other minor matters and gradually withdrew, leaving Chi Zhiyun seated alone. He quietly gazed in the direction Li Xizhi had gone, the smile on his face slowly fading.

A thought stirred in his heart, None of them are easy to handle... I thought Tang Shedu was already troublesome enough. But this Li Xizhi... he’s even harder to control than Tang Shedu. The Kong Family indeed needs Heavenly Glow. And Changxi did request it from Daoist Master Suiguan... Li Xizhi alone doesn’t have that much clout...

Chi Zhiyun pondered for a moment, then set the jade talisman aside, If Tang Shecheng and Yu Yuxie were still alive, with Xiao Yuansi and Yu Xiuxian also here... I wouldn’t have to rely on anyone in particular right now...

Among the many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, he actually preferred Yuan Su’s way of doing things and disliked people like Chi Wei, who fished the pond dry. But then he reconsidered and thought, Once I reach Purple Mansion Realm myself... perhaps I’ll think differently.

Back on Li Xizhi’s end, he descended through the wind. A young man was waiting on the mountain. He resembled Chi Zhiyun quite a bit, but had a gloomier air. Yet now his face bore a sincere smile as he said, “Zhiyan greets the Peak Master!”

Li Xizhi had heard of this man’s reputation and dared not take him lightly, so he waved his hands repeatedly in courtesy. Chi Zhiyan, however, was warm and talkative, rambling on at length.

Li Xizhi nodded politely and saw him off with a cupped-hand salute as they arrived together at Changtian Peak.

Changtian Peak wasn’t very tall, it was rugged and steep in places. Since it had been uninhabited for years, wild grass covered the slopes. Li Xizhi descended with the wind and saw that only a single, quaint little dwelling stood atop the summit.

Li Xizhi had intended to inquire about Zhang Lingshu, but didn’t trust Chi Zhiyan. So he exchanged a few polite words, then courteously escorted him off the peak.

Chi Zhiyan cupped his hands in farewell and still made bold assurances. He said, “Brother Xizhi! My elder brother’s always busy and can’t manage all his underlings... But if you face any trouble at all, just come to me, Chi Zhiyan! I’ll handle it myself! I won’t let Changtian Peak suffer the slightest indignity!”

Li Xizhi nodded and smiled, though he didn’t believe a word. He returned to the peak on the wind and began tidying up carefully.

Most of the formations within the pavilion were still functional. It looked elegant and refined. As he continued tidying the mountain, sure enough, a visitor arrived after just fifteen minutes.

The visitor was tall and, upon stepping into the mountain, he greeted with enthusiasm, “Xizhi! You’ve finally got yourself a fine mountain!”

“You’re quite well-informed, brother-in-law,” replied Li Xizhi, smiling faintly and showing a hint of genuine warmth. The man before him was Yang Ruizao, the older brother of his wife, Yang Xiao’er. He was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator with whom he had crossed paths a few times before.

Yang Ruizao looked around briefly, exchanged a few words, and before Li Xizhi could even ask, he smiled and said, “I’ve heard some things too. I don’t have much detail yet, but I’ve already sent someone to compile information on this peak. You’ll have it delivered tonight.”

Moongaze Lake.

The northern shore’s mountains were covered in pristine snow. Li Xijun had been silently observing the lake for several days and had already seen signs of more than a dozen skirmishes.

“The Fei Family is really in trouble,” muttered Li Xijun.

The north bank of Moongaze Lake bordered Xu State, and the Fei Family was the first to bear the brunt. The Buddhist and devil cultivators fleeing Xu State were split into two groups by Mount Xiping, heading separately toward Wu and Yue States.

Fortunately, the Fei Family’s formation was a legacy from ancient times, capable of withstanding Foundation Establishment REalm attacks. And with the cultivators in a rush to cover their tracks, unwilling to linger, nothing too disastrous had happened yet.

Even so, several members of the Fei Family who ventured out had been killed by devil or Buddhist cultivators. They had now learned their lesson and withdrawn entirely into the mountain, refusing to budge.

Li Xijun waited patiently. After a time, he saw two streaks of light flying past the lake’s central island. The one ahead emitted panicked dharma light and the one behind was dim and shadowy, its origins unclear.

Li Xijun looked at their trajectory and he was pretty sure that they were coming from Xu State. He thought, Just as the Yue Cultivating Sect pulled its forces back, Xu State’s cultivators are already fleeing into Yue State... they’re flying around blind. It’s clear how chaotic Xu State has become...

He had encountered five or six such cases over the past few days, but hadn't found the right opportunity to catch someone for questioning.

First, avoid Buddhist cultivators, they’re clever, love playing games, and have tangled history with my family. As for devil or orthodox cultivators, I must choose someone with low cultivation and no strong backing.

He had waited for days. Finally, these two came along. Their light-escape techniques were crude at best, likely devil cultivators or immortal cultivators. He rode the breeze and snow, instantly cutting off the one in front.

Li Xijun reached out and grabbed the man. The man’s light was instantly shattered. He had no time to react just like a lamb to the slaughter, he was caught. His cultivation was sealed and cast into the swirling snow.

The man turned out to be an old fellow in a tattered Daoist robe that was holding a fly whisk. His face was full of terror, but with his cultivation and speech both sealed, he could say nothing.

Though unable to speak, he curled up in the wind, pressing his palms together and pleading for mercy with frantic gestures.

The one behind reacted far faster. At the first sign of snow and wind, he turned tail and fled, erupting into a red mist. Clearly, he had used a blood-burning spell that consumed life force for speed.

Li Xijun nodded slightly, formed a seal with two fingers, and pointed gently at the fleeing figure.

A stream of white light, the Slaughter Jun Kui Light, gushed out like a flowing ribbon. It was as thin as silk and as swift as lightning. It flashed through the air, brushed across the fleeing light, and with a cry of pain, all of the man’s spells were wiped clean. He plummeted into the lake below.

The fleeing man turned out to be a young cultivator. His face was pale from the secret technique he had used. Clad in black, his blood qi surged, whether from his cultivation method or the spell itself was unclear.

Li Xijun reached out, sealed the young man’s cultivation and pulled him up without pause. Two Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators were nothing more than meat on the chopping block before him, they were entirely defenseless. Without saying a word, he took to the wind and flew south.

After around five minutes, Li Zhouwei appeared, clad in armor and standing with a halberd in hand. Behind him was Chen Yang, who had just broken through Qi Cultivation Realm and was now riding the wind as well.

As the years passed, the oddities in Li Zhouwei’s appearance had faded. Now, standing aloft on the wind, he looked no different from an ordinary cultivator except for a strange power in his gaze that made it difficult to look away. Everything else about him was well-concealed.

His features had matured, his shoulders had broadened and he now bore a resemblance to his father. The strange aura from his birth had mostly dissipated, though Chen Yang still stood at attention with proper form and discipline.

Li Zhouwei was now at the third stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He wasn’t rushing to advance further, as doing so might draw unwanted attention. Instead, he devoted most of his time to mastering halberd techniques.
𝕗𝐫𝐞𝕖𝕨𝐞𝗯𝚗𝕠𝘃𝐞𝚕.𝐜𝗼𝚖

After a short wait, Li Xijun arrived on the wind with a breeze of snow trailing behind. The young Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in charge of Qingdu wore a troubled look, and two cultivators lay curled up on a spirit wind beside him.

Li Zhouwei had now officially joined Qingdu’s ranks. With Li Ximing in long-term seclusion, Li Qinghong away across the outer seas, and both Li Xizhi and Li Xuanfeng stationed at Azure Pond Sect, only Li Xijun and Li Zhouwei remained on Mount Qingdu to manage family matters.

Li Zhouwei glanced briefly at the captives and understood at once. He said in a low voice, “Uncle, there was another disturbance just now. This is already the seventh Buddhist cultivator to fly across the border this month...”

The northern skies were dim and heavy. Li Xijun had just returned from visiting the Fei Family. Over the past few days, he had seen things clearly, and upon hearing this, replied, “That’s right. I came back from the northern shore. The Fei Family has already lost three Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators. I caught these two along the way. We’ll question them thoroughly about what’s happening up north.”




# Chapter 737: Father And Son

The two returned to Qingdu, flinging the two cultivators to the ground. First, they sealed the six senses of the white-robed old Daoist, tossing him aside like a rotting log, then removed the restraints on the black-clad cultivator.

The black-clad cultivator immediately turned over and kowtowed, respectfully saying, "Greetings to the two seniors. I am He Yitao, a cultivator from Xu State, cultivating at Mount Bianyan. With the Buddhist cultivators pushing south, we had no place to stand and were forced to cross into Yue State. If we have caused any offense, I am willing to offer full compensation!"
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝒆𝒘𝙚𝓫𝙣𝙤𝒗𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

Li Xijun merely waved his hand and asked, "What is the current situation in Xu State?"

The black-clad cultivator quickly replied, "The Buddhist cultivators swept southward, reaching the southern parts of Xu State. The battles centered around Mount Bianyan, and even the great demonic beast Sanjun of the mountain couldn’t stay out of it. His subordinate demonic generals were captured and eaten, and Sanjun himself fled on the wind to Mount Dali, leaving chaos in his wake..."

"Did the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators or Maha intervene?" Li Xijun asked carefully, and the black-clad youth replied, "I haven’t seen them. Only two of The Merciful Ones were overseeing the battle. The Golden Feather Sect and Azure Pond Sect sent a group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, but there has been no sign of Maha in the north."

Lowering his eyes respectfully, he quietly observed and said, "Across Xu State, landslides and cracks have appeared everywhere, and strange phenomena abound. I’ve heard a giant boulder, two thousand meters tall, fell in the north. The rivers in the east have dried up, and fish and shrimp in the riverbeds are singing... Events like these are countless."

Li Xijun asked another two questions, then continued, "Which Dao of the Buddhist cultivators is leading the charge?"

He Yitao froze, gritted his teeth in thought for a moment, then said, "I’ve only heard of the Way of Compassion and the Dao of Great Desire.., and also the Way of Emptiness. As for which Dao lineage the two Merciful Ones belong to, I am too low in rank to know."

Li Xijun nodded. Beside him, Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and asked with concern, "Has there been any sign of the Way of Wrath?"

He Yitao paused for a moment, then said uncertainly, "Your Excellency may not know, but the Way of Wrath once reincarnated. Back then, its physical form was cleaved by the Celestial Moon Li Tongya, and its true form was besieged by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Its Dao lineage suffered heavy losses, their inquiries to the law went unanswered. It's rarely seen anymore."

Li Xijun nodded slightly, gave him a glance, then questioned him three more times. He sent a stream of mana into his body and sure enough, the man was a devil cultivator.

Without waiting for him to speak, Li Xijun flipped his hand and tossed him aside, then removed the restraints from the old Daoist. The old man fell to his knees with a thud and said in a trembling voice, "Your Excellency..."

The biting wind and snow around Li Xijun were fierce, but his voice was gentle as he asked, "Old man, where are you from, and why have you come here?"

"I am from Xu State... a rogue cultivator from the Floating Cloud Cave of Mount Xiaoshi..."

He cried sorrowfully, "The five-eyed Merciful One of the Way of Emptiness and several Master Monks descended near Mount Xiaoshi. Sixteen households of us scattered in panic... those who ran slowly slit their own throats... or cut off their limbs, ears, and noses, or leapt off the cliffs...

"I've cultivated for over a hundred years, and only managed to survive by running fast. I escaped from the hands of Master Monk Xu Mu... and ended up in this region."

Li Xijun gripped his sword, frowning as doubts arose in his heart. Before he could speak, the man cried out repeatedly, "Please wait, Your Excellency! Please wait!"

He raised his head slightly, one eye glancing upward to read their expressions. Curling his body inward, he spoke quickly like spilling beads, "My martial uncle has been cultivating by this lake for many years! I came here this time just to seek refuge with him! Please wait, Your Excellency... perhaps we are even allies!"

The old man was well-versed. Upon hearing this, Li Xuanxuan became intrigued and asked, "When was this... and does he have a Dao title?"

Seeing his expression, the old Daoist quickly formed a plan. A flattering smile appeared on his face as he replied, "I am Fu Yuan. My martial uncle's Dao title is Ling Guizi... He broke through the Qi Cultivation Realm about one hundred thirty years ago and came to this lake to seek fortune. I don’t know if he has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm by now..."

Li Xuanxuan found the story odd. His smile faded, and he quietly glanced at him, saying, "I think you've lost your mind, daring to spout nonsense here... A rogue cultivator takes what, sixty years to break through the Qi Cultivation Realm? He came here a hundred and thirty years ago? He’s probably long dead in some forgotten corner.

"Just because someone once cultivated in a place doesn’t make them destined to be there!"

Daoist Fu Yuan was terrified, shaking his head repeatedly as he hurriedly said, "Your Excellency! My martial uncle carries a great fortune with him! He is definitely not ordinary!"

Li Xuanxuan no longer quite believed him and only asked, "What kind of fortune?"

Daoist Fu Yuan couldn’t explain and stammered, "My master was still thinking of my martial uncle on his deathbed, saying our grandmaster passed the fortune to him before he died..."

He couldn't explain it, and what great fortune could a Qi Cultivation Realm rogue cultivator possibly have anyway? Fu Yuan knew this in his heart, and could only keep kowtowing without saying another word.

Li Xuanxuan saw that the man's qi wasn’t particularly impure. For someone from a place like Xu State, it was already rare and precious. He wasn’t planning to make things difficult and was just about to speak.

"Wait..." Li Xijun suddenly stopped him, frowning and shaking his head.

Daoist Fu Yuan grew even more terrified, raising his head in panic, thinking, The old man is kind, but this handsome young man is ruthless.

Li Xijun simply gave him a calm glance and asked softly, "Old man, how did you escape from the Merciful Ones and the Master Monks?"

Daoist Fu Yuan stared blankly at him, as if trying to recall, and after several breaths, he exclaimed in surprise, "Oh dear... I’ve completely forgotten!"

Blood seeped from his mouth and nose. With a cry of pain, his body collapsed like a bundle of firewood, hitting the ground with a thud. He was dead without another sound.

Li Xijun stepped back and used mana to flip the body. Daoist Fu Yuan's face was pale and skin cold. With two fingers forming a sword, Li Xijun slit open his abdomen.

Inside was pitch black. His internal organs had vanished, leaving behind only a shriveled, dead maggot.

Li Xuanxuan stood in a daze, while on the other side, Li Zhouwei gripped his halberd thoughtfully. Li Xijun conjured flame between two fingers and gently dropped it onto the empty skin. With a burst of crackling sounds:

Boom...

The dried-up flesh caught fire instantly, flaring brightly for a moment before turning to ash.

Seeing this, He Yitao was terrified to the extreme, tears and snot flowing as he said in a low voice, "I possess nothing of value. Your Excellency would disdain such things. But for the sake of my harmlessness, I beg for my life. I will obey your every command, without a hint of betrayal."

He feared Li Xijun would ask something that would cost him his life on the spot. But the man merely took his storage pouch, examined it for a breath, saw it was full of blood-stained meat and rice, and shook his head.

Before He Yitao could react, a scorching pain bloomed in his chest. Heat surged from his belly and spurted out his nostrils. A halberd had pierced through his chest, its shaft held by the young man.

The demonic fetus he had nurtured in his abdomen immediately awoke. It was a tiny, mouse-like lump of flesh, it wriggled a few times inside him, but before it could burst out or hide, a hand plunged once more into his belly.

Li Zhouwei held the halberd with one hand, stirred around in the belly with the other, fished out the demonic fetus, studied it for two seconds, and casually crushed it.

Though He Yitao was at least an early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivator, he had no chance to react. His head was removed in the next instant.

Golden flame surged from Li Zhouwei’s hand, laced with black smoke. He cast it onto the corpse, and in an instant, golden sparks consumed it completely. The young heir retracted his halberd, and Li Xijun nodded, saying, "The Bright Yang Dao is also effective against devil cultivators... Though it’s not as potent as Supreme Yang or Profound Thunder, it’s still well-regarded."

Beside them, Li Xuanxuan was still staring blankly at Daoist Fu Yuan’s corpse. Li Xijun turned to look back and, seeing the old man lost in thought, said with some concern, "Uncle..."

Li Xuanxuan stepped forward slowly, took the storage pouch from Daoist Fu Yuan’s waist, examined it closely, and murmured, "So very familiar!"

This small brocade pouch was different from the ones commonly used in Yue State, it was more delicate and compact. Li Xuanxuan studied it for a while, and a look of reminiscence appeared on his face as he softly said, "The first storage pouch my family ever owned... looked just like this!"

After saying this, he grew more certain, turning the pouch over again and again, his voice drifting, "Back then, Uncle Xiangping went to rescue the Wan Family. Who would have thought the Ji Family borrowed strength from the Golden Tang Gate and utterly crushed the Wan Family... My uncle ran into an old Daoist who tried to kill him.

"That old Daoist had waited in the lake for thirty years, seeking a fortune... but was killed by my uncle, who brought back this very storage pouch. It seems... he was the martial uncle mentioned just now."

Li Xuanxuan paused in thought for a breath and softly said, "If there's ever a chance, we should go visit Floating Cloud Cave on Mount Xiaoshi."

Li Xijun, of course, understood what he meant. He nodded silently and said softly, "The situation in Xu State is utterly chaotic. With the Fei Family holding the front, we can discuss things more thoroughly. After all, it’s a rare Foundation Establishment Realm formation. If used well, we could reduce our own losses significantly."

Li Xuanxuan put the storage pouch away, his expression showing faint dissatisfaction as he said, "Even at this point, they still refuse to send someone to ask for aid."

Li Xijun let out a small laugh. Li Zhouwei stood tall and said softly, "The Azure Pond Sect is ten thousand miles away, far beyond reach. It takes over a month to go and return. But we’re just across the lake, close at hand. A distant stream can't put out a nearby fire. They'll see it clearly soon enough."

Both seniors nodded. After arranging the defenses, Li Zhouwei soon took his leave, riding the wind out of Qingdu, drifting lightly into the side courtyard of the central hall.

Chen Yang followed closely behind, speaking respectfully, "Your Highness, my father has been waiting in the hall for quite some time."

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei nodded and finally came to a stop. As expected, he saw the middle-aged Chen Mufeng waiting respectfully in the great hall, holding a young woman by the hand.

Chen Mufeng had now reached the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Though he had erred in the Xu Xiao matter years ago and was severely punished, the Chen Family remained a prominent family, and Chen Donghe held considerable favor. So, Mufeng still had some standing.

He approached with a full smile. Chen Mufeng had married Li Xicheng's younger sister and was also Li Chengliao's uncle by marriage. He spoke, "Your Highness, this is my youngest daughter, Chen Shao... born of a concubine. Now that she's grown a bit older, I’ve brought her for Your Highness to see..."

Li Zhouwei naturally understood what he was trying to do. Glancing at the demure, downcast girl, he deliberately avoided eye contact and flung his robe aside. He walked straight into the room, leaving only a voice echoing through the courtyard, "Go ask my father!"

Chen Mufeng was thoroughly shut down. He exchanged a glance with Chen Yang, and could only withdraw quietly.

As the father and daughter left the courtyard, Chen Shao seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, her steps growing noticeably lighter. Chen Mufeng let out a low sigh, while Chen Yang walked slowly with a dark expression clouding his face.

Back at the Chen residence, Chen Shao gave a hurried bow and retreated as if fleeing. Chen Mufeng seemed calm enough, simply leading Chen Yang forward.

The father and son said nothing as they made their way swiftly to the rear courtyard. Madam Li was reading, and glanced up to ask, "So it didn’t work out?"

Chen Yang answered coldly, "Correct!"

He gave a slight bow, flung his sleeve, and left.

Chen Mufeng stood awkwardly in the courtyard. Madam Li merely sighed and said, "If it didn’t work, so be it! We just wanted to see if either side would take a liking... I don’t blame you for anything."

Madam Li had always been a gentle and fair mistress of the household, Chen Mufeng knew this well. He nodded, and when their eyes met, both saw the same worry reflected in the other.

Chen Mufeng’s expression was no longer just awkward, he was angry too. After brooding for a while and drinking several cups of tea, he could no longer hold back and said in a low, tense voice, "He... he’s truly vicious to the core!"

Madam Li sighed. The middle-aged woman was gradually growing helpless too, and said softly, "I don’t know who he takes after... The more we taught him, the more he learned to manipulate and use people."

Chen Mufeng's anger surged again, and he ground his teeth as he said, "How did we... end up raising him like this! He wasn’t this cold and heartless, this sharp and unkind when he was little!"

Though he had always favored this eldest son, he was still a father. His heart held feelings for all his children. He said coldly, "The way he looked. It was as if the younger sister didn’t marry the heir, he’d pull a blade to force her!"

Madam Li lowered her eyes, unsure of how to comfort her husband for a moment.

Creak...

A crisp creaking sound echoed as the courtyard gate was pushed open. A pale, lean and nimble hand appeared, followed by their eldest son, Chen Yang, stepping inside with a calm smile on his face.

His face was sharp and cold, even smiling. He exuded a chilling sense of cunning. The eldest son spoke softly, "Father, let’s go see the family head tomorrow."

Both husband and wife felt a chill run down their spines, struck speechless. The courtyard gate was supposed to isolate sound. Chen Yang, who had just left, couldn’t possibly have heard their conversation. Yet Chen Mufeng felt his son’s gaze chill him to the bone, like frost.

Somehow, he nodded unconsciously. Chen Yang chuckled, gripped the doorway with both hands and stepped out backward. He closed the doors behind him with two crisp creaks, tight and shut.

Chen Mufeng vaguely felt sweat forming on his forehead. He picked up his tea and drank heavily for several gulps before turning to look at his wife again.

Madam Li sat frozen in place, staring blankly. After a long moment, she finally said in a soft voice, "I once thought that sending him to the main household... would refine his temperament, teach him humility and restraint, help him understand there are always greater people in this world..."

Her eyes lowered slightly as she spoke quietly, "Now I feel... sending him to the heir’s side, letting him lead troops and kill, suppressing Mount Yue only sharpened his claws and fangs. He once only looked cruel and cunning but now it's in his very bones."

Chen Mufeng sat in a daze for more than ten seconds, feeling an icy chill spread through his heart before he finally said coldly, "He only values the ones on Qingdu... Only sees them as his kind... Only yields to the heir. As for us... we're nothing more than tools he can rely on when needed."

Hearing this, Madam Li was startled and shocked. She suddenly raised her head, staring at the man who had seemed foolish beside her for most of their lives, and a strange premonition rose in her heart, So it turns out... the son's cunning comes from a father who was never simple either.

When she tried to ask Chen Mufeng again, the man remained silent.




# Chapter 739: Miao Quan

Eastern Sea.

Li Qinghong rode the water veins all the way back from the Scarlet Pristine Sea. Only when she reached the Shallow Sea did she emerge from the water, then flew for a few more days, gradually finding the skies above growing livelier.

She had only ridden the thunder for a few miles when she sensed mana fluctuations from all directions. The flow of spiritual energy was unstable, and when she looked around, dharma lights streamed across the sky. It was chaotic and bustling.

"It’s come to this kind of mess..." she muttered.

At that, Li Qinghong had no choice but to conceal her light, lower her speed and fly a bit higher as she headed westward. Along the way, she witnessed many battles.

There were immortal cultivators clashing in dazzling light, buddhist and devil cultivators locked in chaos, and even some familiar sects among them.

As she passed over an island, the sea below was dyed blood-red and just then, she ran into a black-robed man riding the wind with a severed head in his hand.

Li Qinghong sensed trouble and quickly veered her light in another direction, hoping to avoid him. But the man frowned at her, then actually rode his spirit wind to approach.

Hmm? A surge of warning rose in her heart. She gave the man a brief glance. His robes looked to be from the Great Xiukui Temple, black and gray interwoven, inscribed with many runes.

They glanced at each other. The man seemed to have confirmed something and flew straight toward her. Li Qinghong had no way to avoid it, so she cupped her fists and said, "May I ask what business brings you here, senior?"

The man had just killed someone and still held a severed head, yet his expression was polite and gentle as he said softly, "Are you Qinghong?"

"And you are...?" Li Qinghong was certain she had never seen this man before, and doubt filled her heart.

The man simply said, "I am Lin Chensheng. I’ve seen your portrait before. I have some acquaintance with your second uncle."

The Great Xiukui Temple didn’t have a particularly bad reputation. Li Qinghong was half convinced when the man added, "Best not to go ahead. Detour a bit as the Great Xiukui Temple is attacking the Crimson Reef Island market ahead. If you stray into it, you might get hurt..."

With that, he stowed the severed head, paid a brief farewell, and turned to ride the wind away. He didn’t care whether Li Qinghong believed him or not.

After thinking for a moment, she recalled vaguely hearing that name from her second uncle, Li Xuanfeng. She changed direction and flew with her aura suppressed, but soon noticed more and more devil cultivators appearing.

The Eastern Sea was Dragon Clan territory, it was not like the Southern Sea that was known for its devil cultivators. Its major powers were mostly Purple Mansion and Golden Core Realms cultivators, considered orthodox immortals nowadays. Normally, one wouldn’t see so many devil cultivators here.

But now, the sky was truly filled with rolling demonic clouds. After a few more seconds of flight, she suddenly saw thunder roiling ahead. There were multiple bolts of lightning interlinking in the clouds, unleashing deafening booms.

It’s truly descended into chaos! Avoid one disaster, run into another! thought Li Qinghong.

"Miao Quan! You... how dare you...!" A clear, cold, melodious female voice rang out. Li Qinghong had been preparing to flee stealthily, but the voice made her pause. There was something familiar about it. She thought to herself, Seems like... someone I know...

She glanced slightly and saw a female cultivator standing amid the clouds, with elegant brows and bright eyes. Recognition immediately dawned in her heart, So it’s her...

Sure enough, there came a dull thunderclap from within the clouds, lightning scattering, followed by a male voice, "Fellow Daoist Yanqing... I do not seek your life, only that Profund Thunderstone... I simply wish for a way to exchange for it. You need only name your terms, Fairy."

The woman was none other than Shen Yanqing, whom Li Qinghong had met back when she visited the Purple Smoke Gate. Also a practitioner of thunder arts, Shen Yanqing came from an illustrious background. Not only was she born into a Purple Mansion Realm immortal family, but she was also a personal disciple of the Purple Smoke Gate. She had been very courteous to Li Qinghong back then.

Now, however, her expression was nothing like the polite warmth she had shown Li Qinghong, it was cold as she replied, "Profund Thunderstone? What Thunderstone... I’ve only heard of such an item and it’s extremely rare. Why would I have such a treasure?"

The man gradually revealed his figure. He was bare-chested, muscular, with a wild expression. He held a large axe in his hand and spoke with relative politeness, "Fairy Shen must be joking. With your background and lineage, that Profund Thunderstone must surely be in your possession."

Profund Thunderstone...

Thunder roared around them. Li Qinghong sighed inwardly. Now that she had come this way, she likely couldn’t avoid this matter. She wasn’t sure if the others had noticed her, so she remained silent.

But Shen Yanqing was growing colder by the moment. She said simply, "Daoist Miao, please step aside."

Miao Quan, standing before her, stared intently. A subtle calculation began to form in his heart, The Purple Smoke Gate’s senior is preparing for a breakthrough. He definitely has no time to oversee anything. The Yue Cultivating Sect is sealed, and Daoist Master Yuming is in no state to interfere... This is a perfect opportunity...

I don’t need to kill her... just force her to hand over the item. As long as I get the Thunderstone, even if Daoist Master Yuming has objections, my own elders can shield me... If I miss this chance, there may never be another opportunity for the Profund Thunderstone!

After a moment of silence, he raised his great axe and spoke gently, "I’ve heard that several thunder cultivators have emerged in the mainland, all from lineages that summon and command lightning. Yet I’ve never had a chance to test myself against one.

"It’s rare to encounter a fellow Daoist here, how about a friendly match? It’ll be a good learning experience."

Those words made Shen Yanqing’s expression shift slightly. A cold sneer tugged at her lips, "You, a well-known late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator who’s nearly at Purple Mansion Realm... want to 'spar' with me, a junior barely in the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm?"

Miao Quan said nothing more. He silently raised his lightning axe and started gathering white lightning. Shen Yanqing responded in kind, summoning her own thunder.

Boom!!

Miao Quan struck her lightning technique apart with a single axe blow, and felt a considerable force coming through his hands. He thought, This Shen Family girl does have some skill, she’s not like the usual Foundation Establishment Realm rabble.

Just as he gathered more white lightning, a silver spear burst through the clouds, radiating intense violet light. It streaked across the sky, decisively and forcefully barring his path.

As the clouds briefly parted, a female cultivator in jade armor appeared. Her apricot eyes gazed calmly ahead as she spoke in a soft tone, "Daoist friend, if you seek to test yourself against thunder cultivators of the mainland... then you're in luck. Let us spar together."

Miao Quan’s expression darkened instantly. Courteous as he had been to Shen Yanqing, she was, after all, a direct descendant of the Shen Family. But he had no idea who this new woman was. He said coldly, "You meddle too much... Are you not afraid of death, or the extermination of your family?"

His voice was icy. Behind Li Qinghong, Shen Yanqing looked pleasantly surprised. After a slight pause, she called out, "Sister!"

Li Qinghong had been watching quietly for a while now. Her intervention wasn’t impulsive. She’d experienced much and suspicion had long stirred in her heart, A duel between thunder cultivators, and I just happened to stumble into it? Curious indeed... Shen Yanqing and I are acquainted, and she’s backed by two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... With a clash like this, I wouldn’t be surprised if signs of higher-realm interference had already begun.

Regardless of whether Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were involved, Li Qinghong knew her stealth art wasn’t anything profound. She suspected that Shen Yanqing had already sensed her presence earlier, perhaps she had even been retreating in this direction on purpose.

Whether or not it’s worth intervening, if I turn away now, I’ll likely offend both the Purple Smoke Gate and the Shen Family. There’s no other way forward.

As the two of them were speaking, Li Qinghong had already reached her decision. She reversed her spear grip, let violet light flicker from its tip, and surged forth on thunder, intercepting the man in an instant.

Shen Yanqing was quick-witted, calling her sister was enough to startle Miao Quan into momentary hesitation, making him glance over in a daze.

After all, Li Qinghong was a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. If she was indeed from an immortal family bloodline, her strength was likely on par with Miao Quan’s. And with Shen Yanqing at her side, taking Li Qinghong down wouldn’t be easy.

Miao Quan’s face flickered with indecision for a second. Then he gave Li Qinghong a once-over and suddenly sneered, "You think I'm so easily fooled? That armor of hers doesn’t even register at the Foundation Establishment Realm. She’s not from the Shen Family."

Li Qinghong wasn’t surprised in the least. She angled her spear and said quietly, eyes blazing with battle spirit, "Come."

Miao Quan’s face turned grim. He raised his axe high, white lightning surging from its edge. He said, "Foolish!"

He lunged forward, and the lightning gathered before him in a flash, rippling outward from his axe. This wasn’t Celestial Thunder he cultivated, it was brighter, denser and violently focused.

Li Qinghong lifted her spear. Her technique born from the Xiao Family's Wing Clipper Spear technique and the Fei Family’s Dragon Reflection had become increasingly masterful. Pale violet avian shadows burst forth in the air, swarming like birds from every direction.

As the two types of thunder clashed, a series of deafening explosions echoed through the sky, churning the waves and dispersing the clouds. Miao Quan pulled his axe back and only a faint layer of white light remained on its blade.

Only slightly better? He was secretly shocked, though his face betrayed nothing. With a flick of his wrist, he rode the momentum to summon more lightning. White brilliance surged outward in dense, worm-like arcs, striking toward both opponents.

Li Qinghong twirled her spear gracefully, sending up a wave of violet light to block the strike. Nearby, Shen Yanqing's face paled slightly as Miao Quan suddenly erupted with overwhelming force. The white lightning around his axe grew several times stronger, shaking the air with deafening momentum.

That white lightning clung to his axe like countless writhing worms, crawling up his arm, it was a terrifying sight. His earlier moves had only been feints, now he was showing his true strength.

But Shen Yanqing was only in the early Foundation Establishment Realm. Li Qinghong had no choice but to step forward with her spear and intercept the blow.

Boom!

A thunderclap rang out from the flat sky. White lightning crashed into the sea, raising clouds of steam and countless dead fish floating belly-up in the water.

Staggering slightly in the mist, blood trickled from Li Qinghong’s lips. Her long spear hummed with excitement, resonating against the thunder.

"Know your place! Get lost while you still can!" Miao Quan still didn’t know her background. He simply wanted to scare her off quickly. Lightning lashed forth from his axe as a faint smile crept onto his face, though it quickly froze in suspicion, Why is it... like her aura is growing stronger...?

He saw Li Qinghong’s spear dance with increasing might. Purple lightning and spear shadows surged forth in a storm, battering his axe without pause.

Miao Quan thought her reckless. White light flared from his elbows as thunder surged up his arms, connecting with the lightning of his dharma artifact. He released pulse after pulse of blinding white light.

He fought two opponents alone. His spirit axe swung faster and faster, thundering with lightning. Li Qinghong still managed to trade blows and deflect the backlash, but Shen Yanqing was clearly beginning to struggle.

Growing more ruthless, Miao Quan clenched the air, grasping a roiling bundle of white lightning. His other hand formed a seal, then flipped his palm outward. White lightning leapt forth.

At that exact moment, the violet-patterned lightning flask at Li Qinghong’s waist activated, erupting with streams of purple-white lightning in various hues that collided with Miao Quan’s spell.

Miao Quan's spell was clearly of a high tier, yet it matched Li Qinghong’s long-refined lightning forged from heaven and earth. He was briefly surprised, then gave a chilling grin.

His spell seals grew faster and faster, and the white lightning became more ferocious. Shen Yanqing quickly pulled a small mirror from her robes and released a soft yellow glow that shone gently toward the white lightning.

Boom!

The spell faltered. Miao Quan's expression shifted, he rapidly changed his hand seals but could no longer hold it together. The lightning scattered into countless motes of white light and vanished into the air.

Just as anger began to show on his face, Li Qinghong suddenly lifted her head. A pair of violet glints surfaced in her eyes. Though her voice was a touch hoarse, it still carried that same nimble and spirited tone, "Senior... take this strike from me."

Li Qinghong pressed her lips together and exhaled a bead of white light. The warm and elegant light bounced lightly and in an instant expanded to the size of a fist. In the sky, streaks of violet lightning patterns appeared.

The white light flickered in the air and surged forward at incredible speed. Miao Quan’s face twisted in sudden fear. His heart skipped a beat as he cried inwardly, Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling?!

Boom!

He only had time to summon a bronze shield. In a blink, the reef stones on an island several hundred meters away crumbled with a crash. The sea depressed inward, then erupted violently, streaked with violet-white lightning that rained down in a dense barrage.

It was the Profound Thunderbolt, nurtured for years in Li Qinghong’s personal thunder pool!

Li Qinghong hadn’t spent her years cultivating in the outer seas in vain. Times had changed. Back when she was only in the early Foundation Establishment Realm, that very thunderbolt had already drawn praise from Zhang Yun of the Golden Feather Sect.

Now she was in the late-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Her cultivation, insight, mana and spiritual sense were all far beyond what they had once been. When this thunderbolt landed, it was as though even heaven's light bent down in awe.

Only when the white radiance finally faded did Miao Quan reappear, his expression dark. He hadn’t been gravely injured as only a corner of his robes was singed. But there was clear frustration and humiliation on his face.

His body was now covered in writhing white lightning. It was like a fearsome armor clinging to his frame. Taking a step forward, his hand brimming with lightning, Miao Quan reached straight for the long spear in Li Qinghong’s hands.

But how could Li Qinghong let him get his way? She flicked her spear with elegant precision. The tip lashed out with a flash and a boom, forcing him several inches away in a burst of thunder.

Miao Quan grasped at nothing and felt as if he’d struck solid iron. Then his eyes fell on the silver spear in Li Qinghong’s hand, it looked oddly familiar. He froze for a moment, focused his gaze, and blurted out, "Duruo?!"

The moment the words left his lips, Li Qinghong was visibly taken aback. Behind her, Shen Yanqing was also momentarily stunned. Both of them turned their eyes toward the spear in her hand.




# Chapter 741: Returning To The Family

As soon as he said this, it truly startled Li Qinghong.

The Duruo Spear was the first Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact she had obtained, very handy in use. In all the years it had been in Li Qinghong’s hands, it had never been inferior to any weapon held by her enemies.

The spear had no name inscribed on it. When Li Tongya obtained it back in the day, he couldn't use it and didn’t know its name, so it was kept in storage until Li Qinghong formed a bond with it, at which point she learned it was called Duruo.

But this was the first time someone had called out the name of her dharma artifact.
𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝘦𝘣𝘯ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝑚

Miao Quan who was in front of her, now wore a look of both hatred and shock. He didn’t make another move but instead hovered mid-air on a beam of white light and asked, "Are you from the Golden Feather Sect? Or the Azure Pond Sect?"

Li Qinghong withdrew her spear and stood calmly, replying softly, “Senior, you’re mistaken. I’m from neither.”

Miao Quan’s expression shifted several times before he ground his teeth and said, “Doesn’t matter whether you are or not, or whether you admit it. Once I capture you, I’ll find out everything by asking!”

He spoke in haste, unable to hold back a couple of coughs, which made Li Qinghong secretly pleased, Looks like that sudden Profound Thunder strike did affect him, he’s just forcing himself to hide it.

Now that Li Qinghong was in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, she could condense three Profound Thunders in his Thunder Pool. Having only used one so far, she felt confident and wasn’t overly afraid.

Miao Quan once again summoned white lightning into his hands and gripped the axe handle with both hands, his eyes flashing white light. Li Qinghong also quietly activated her lightning arts, preparing for battle.

Just then, several soft cries echoed as a figure appeared between the two like a gentle breeze. It was a middle-aged man in a green robe, with a jade flute at his waist softly glowing.

He wore a Daoist crown and stood with his hands behind his back, coldly staring at Miao Quan. The shirtless, burly man’s lightning gradually dissipated, his face stiff and grim.

“Daoist Shen,” said Miao Quan.

Hearing this, Li Qinghong realized a senior from the Shen Family had arrived. She calmed the surging thunder in her Sea of Lightning. Shen Yanqing let out a breath of relief and said joyfully, “Father!”

But Shen Yanqing quickly came to her senses, pulled Li Qinghong along, and said softly, “Let’s quickly retreat, for fear that if a fight breaks out, Father will be hindered...”

Li Qinghong nodded, summoned her lightning, and slowly withdrew with her. She glanced back from a distance and saw Miao Quan still staring at her from afar.

His eyes were filled with white light, burning intensely, as if silently saying to Li Qinghong, “I will come for you...”

Li Qinghong felt a slight headache and followed Shen Yanqing across the sea. The girl oriented herself and said softly, “Sister Qinghong, we’re close to Green Pine Island. It’s safe there, let’s rest a while.”

Li Qinghong nodded, and the two flew together for a while. Soon, Green Pine Island came into view.

The island was now completely different from before. Large reefs and beaches had emerged, its territory expanded several times over. Faint traces of old structures could be seen on the rocks and sand, even a few toppled stone steles.

Shen Yanqing beside her seemed to be seeing it for the first time as well and exclaimed in awe, “I’ve heard that in ancient times, the Shallow Sea was a fertile land, and Green Pine Island was once Green Pine Peak... It’s just as they said!”

The two landed together at the Shen Family’s cave residence on the island and activated its protective barrier. Only then did Shen Yanqing step forward with a smile and say, “This time, it’s all thanks to your help, Sister!”

Li Qinghong modestly replied, “I was merely passing by... Even without me, he wouldn’t have been able to do anything to you... I only interfered unnecessarily.”

“You’re too modest, Sister.” Shen Yanqing shook her head and smiled as she said, “The Eastern Sea is known for Falling Water Rising Storms. Thunder cultivators from across the seas and inland all flock to the Eastern Sea... The Miao Family was originally a thunder cultivation family from the Southern Sea. Who would’ve thought this guy would end up all the way here?

“I too came to cultivate here because of the Falling Water Rising Storms of the Eastern Sea. I’ve been training on the island in recent years. When a major upheaval occurred, I returned by lightning and didn’t expect to run into him.”

Li Qinghong hesitated slightly and asked tactfully, “I was just thinking... for your esteemed family, a Purple Mansion Realm immortal family, traveling between the inland and the outer seas, surely you should have a reliable escort...”

Shen Yanqing lowered her gaze at once, a trace of concern appearing between her brows, and said softly, “Sister Qinghong, you may not know... The Yue Cultivating Sect has sealed its mountains and opened to the sea, leaving a vast territory behind. Devil and Buddhist cultivators are migrating south en masse, and my family, being under Yue Cultivating Sect’s domain, has taken quite a blow.

“With the island’s cultivators needing to hold their posts and the family’s cultivators unable to spare the strength to come... Our family’s master is likely entangled between The Merciful One and devil lords, unable to attend to all matters...”

She explained calmly, never bringing up the matter of the Profund Thunderstone again. Li Qinghong didn’t ask either, such things were beyond her reach. What concerned her more was the Duruo Spear.

Li Qinghong considered for a moment, then asked, “Fairy, do you know anything about the Duruo Spear Miao Quan mentioned?”

She had expected Shen Yanqing to know its origin, but after a moment of thought, she replied, “I’ve never heard of it... The name is unfamiliar. But judging by that Miao familyman’s reaction, there seems to be some connection.”

As the two conversed, radiant light once again flowed across the western sky. Several streaks of multicolored light swept by, and Li Qinghong observed them clearly and said softly, “Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliners.”

Shen Yanqing nodded and said, “Azure Pond, Golden Feather, the Buddhist sects and the devil factions, they’ve likely already begun fighting in Xu State. These Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliners are probably transporting conscripted cultivators...”

These words struck right at the heart of Li Qinghong’s worries, and she felt uneasy, If Azure Pond Sect is going to conscript cultivators, my family will surely be included. Several of our juniors... Xizhi is most likely still at Xia Mountain, Ximing absolutely cannot be sent to battle, and if Xijun returns home, it’ll all fall apart again... I may be the only one suited for this role.

Who knows how the Shen Family will handle things next... best to hurry home while they keep Miao Quan occupied.

The more Li Qinghong worried about her family, the less she could sit still. She spoke gently, “Since we’re now out of danger, I must hurry back home to check on things. I won’t stay here any longer, please give your father my regards...”

Shen Yanqing understood her concern for home. With her own father locked in a battle that might drag on, she nodded and said, “Then Sister Qinghong, please head back first... If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll visit to thank you properly.”

After a few polite exchanges, Li Qinghong left the Shen Family’s cave dwelling. She didn’t take to the skies right away but thought to herself, “Xizhi has gone to Xia Mountain, but Yuexiang is still on the mountain. Who knows how the people of Azure Pond Sect treat her. It’s better to bring her home.”

She immediately took the path to the other side. The Azure Pond Sect was not something the Shen Family could compare to, she had her own peak there. She simply gave her name, “Li Qinghong of Qingdu, please ask Yuexiang to come down.”

The Azure Pond Sect cultivator guarding the gate heard her surname was Li and responded with great respect. Before long, Li Yuexiang descended on a gust of wind. Upon seeing Li Qinghong alone at the foot of the mountain, her face instantly turned pale as she asked, “Aunt, my brother! Someone came looking for him the other day... They even said he abandoned his post without permission...”

Li Qinghong shook her head and spoke gently, “Your brother is fine. Pack your things, we’re heading home. I’ll explain everything on the way.”

Li Yuexiang nodded at once, and even gathered Li Xizhi’s belongings from the peak as well. Together, they headed west.




# Chapter 742: The Eve

Night deepened over Mount Qingdu. Li Xijun had not entered seclusion and stood amid wind and snow among the clouds at the mountain’s peak. After waiting a while, he saw a bolt of violet lightning weaving through the clouds. It halted before him and transformed into two figures.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

“Aunt! Little Sister.” Li Xijun called out, and before him stood Li Qinghong in jade armor with her white spear, and his younger sister Li Yuexiang. Li Qinghong descended on the lightning and spoke softly, “Xijun.”

Li Yuexiang followed behind and greeted him. Li Xijun merely nodded and offered his congratulations, “Congratulations on your cultivation breakthrough, Aunt. I’ve heard things are in chaos out at sea. I’ve been meaning to go pick up Little Sister... but couldn’t spare the time. I was about to send a letter to Brother Xizhi when I happened to be on my way back.”

“Was the journey back safe?” Li Qinghong descended with him into the main hall, and only after they sat down did she speak, “There were some surprises... thinking back on it, something doesn’t add up.”

She recounted the events of her journey. After listening carefully, Li Xijun pondered for a moment and replied, “There is something odd, but it's hard to see clearly. The Eastern Sea is vast, how did you just happen to run into the Miao Family and the Shens? Perhaps some faction is behind it...

“Even if you hadn’t gone, Shen Yanqing surely could’ve held out until the Shen Family’s head arrived. I don’t think their Daoist Master used your strength to save her... I’ve never heard this Daoist Master’s Life Divine Ability to be particularly cunning either, so it’s likely not him.”

Li Qinghong nodded, she had been reflecting along the way as well. She spoke softly, “I suspect someone recognized the Duruo and used this method to inform the Miao Family... But thinking deeper, what was the point? If a Daoist Master had intentions for it, it’s only a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact. Would our family refuse if they simply came to claim it?

“I’ve heard the Miao Family also has a Daoist Master. If the artifact were truly so important, they could’ve torn through the great void and taken it from me as easily as lifting a garment off a bed. They’d earn a favor, and we’d owe them thanks. Why resort to all these twists and turns?”

Li Xijun held a jade cup in hand, nodded slightly, and said, “The Profund Thunderstone... just by the name, it’s clearly no ordinary item. For Miao Quan to request it even while facing pressure from two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, it must be something extremely vital.”

He actually had some suspicions in his heart, but lacking certainty, he didn't want to speak them aloud, Could it be that Daoist Master Chuting used those two as a mouthpiece to tell Aunt about the Profund Thunderstone? But there’s no need for all that, he could’ve just sent someone to say a word. Doing it this vague way only leaves us with a name.

The aunt and nephew exchanged a glance, seeming to reach some unspoken agreement, and quickly moved on from the topic. Li Xijun simply said, “In any case... I’ll look into this matter properly.”

Li Qinghong then explained what the Cui Family of Chongzhou had said. After a moment of hesitation, she recounted her conversation with Chi Buzi. Li Xijun broke into a cold sweat just listening, not daring to speak rashly, and replied, “The Cui Family said the Ning Family might have it, then I’ll write a letter to the southern border to inquire.”

The aunt and nephew discussed for a while. Then Li Xijun began writing, one hand pressed to his sleeve, and said warmly, “Yuexiang...”

He had wanted to bring up his younger sister Yuexiang’s marriage, but when he saw his aunt smiling at him, he suddenly remembered his own status was still unsettled, and stopped, a bit embarrassed.

Li Qinghong removed her jade armor and gently placed it on the table. She took a white outer robe from her storage pouch and draped it over herself, it blended seamlessly with her snow-white inner garments. She said, “My cultivation has progressed. I no longer have need for this spirit armor, it's time to return it to the family.”

Li Xijun nodded and put it away. Li Qinghong thought for a moment, then asked, “By the way... does the heir have any armor? If the chance arises, I’d like to craft a set for him.”

“Armor...” Li Xijun fell silent for a moment, then said softly, “Aunt... our family does have some spirit ores, even ones suitable for Foundation Establishment Realm. But I still think we should use them to forge a spirit armor or feathered robe for you instead.”

“For me?” Li Qinghong frowned slightly, but then saw Li Xijun smile and say, “He’s still just cultivating within the family now. In the future, he’ll be managing the family and its affairs. With his bold personality, he’ll have no trouble obtaining whatever fine items he wants. Aunt, you should think of yourself for once.”

Li Xijun brushed his hand over the storage pouch at his waist and retrieved several items. The first being a piece of gleaming, silvery refined iron. He said, “This is Nishui Cold Essence. Our family’s iron mine has been in operation for decades. The cold iron extracted was refined repeatedly, and the most refined essence has been preserved here. It has been refined over two hundred times, producing this Foundation Establishment Realm material.”

Next was a thin golden sheet, which Li Xijun explained, “This, Aunt, you know already. It’s Altar Goldstone. It was obtained alongside the Earth-View Bloodstone that can heal and save lives. Also Foundation Establishment Realm, though not very large in size...”

This was originally meant to forge a dharma artifact for Li Ximing. But after acquiring the Sun Seeker Ring, it seemed he already had one. Yet as Green Pine Temple’s name became increasingly controversial, no one dared to use it...

Li Ximing was single-minded in his cultivation and cared little for dharma artifacts, so with chaos looming, they decided to take it out early for crafting.

The final item was a pale-blue, head-sized ore. It was a Heyu Emerald, barely Foundation Establishment Realm, but abundant in quantity. It was taken from the Yu Family’s treasury.

He handed all these items to Li Qinghong and simply said, “Aunt, please use these to forge yourself spirit armor or a feathered robe.”

Li Qinghong was briefly surprised but then nodded and accepted them, saying gently, “The Azure Pond Sect will surely conscript Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to the north. I’ll lead the group myself, having a set of spirit armor will be safer.”

She paused and added softly, “Among the many markets, we don’t really know any trustworthy artifact smiths. In times like these, with constant unrest, who’s to say they won’t take our materials and vanish? I can’t bring myself to trust them.”

Having spent a long time in the Eastern Sea, Li Qinghong’s way of thinking had taken on the region’s pragmatism, she always considered the worst outcome first. She simply said, “Let’s wait a bit, Xizhi may be returning soon. Better to let him handle these things.”

“You’re right, Aunt,” replied Li Xijun.

Changtian Peak.

Li Xizhi searched through several pavilions on the peak but couldn’t find a single scroll. There was no sign of a fire vein or pill furnace, and the medicinal gardens were completely desolate. Only the central main hall had a jade slip hanging within, hidden behind the hall. With his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation and careful inspection, Li Xizhi spotted and retrieved it at once. It was the Complete Mercury Ingestion Method of the fourth grade.

It was indeed a quality technique, though it seemed to be already available for reference within the sect. It lacked a method for spiritual qi intake and required a substance called White Mercury Cinnabar Elixir, which appeared to be quite rare.

Yang Ruizao strolled casually with him along the mountain paths as they chatted. After a while, someone arrived delivering a translucent jade slip. Li Xizhi read it through. Changtian Peak indeed had a long history, with its own inherited cultivation method that had been passed down within the peak, rarely relying on sect-wide techniques.

It could be traced back four hundred years. The peak master then was known as Daoist Changtian, who cultivated in the Helin Mountain Range before joining the Azure Pond Sect and being granted a peak of his own.

He specialized in the Whole Pill Dao, particularly Secret White Mercury, and was once considered one of the two greats alongside Ning Wenyue, the Moon Lake Peak master who cultivated Lake Moon Autumn.

Later, Daoist Changtian perished, and his teachings were passed into the sect. Successors tried to follow the Dao, but none matched his level. Their cultivation progressed slowly, even lagging behind standard techniques. The lineage steadily declined, yet each generation stubbornly persisted. With the death of the last peak master, Zhang Lingshu, the lineage was considered severed. All chants and secret texts vanished, leaving behind only a single cultivation method.

The Yang Family had noted that this technique, still stored in the Sutra Repository, had remained untouched to this day. It, too, was named Complete Mercury Ingestion Method.

Secret White Mercury... thought Li Xizhi.

Now that Li Xizhi held peak master status and had the Yang Family’s backing, his access to information was gradually improving. Seeing he didn’t quite understand, Yang Ruizao softly explained, “Xizhi, this Secret White Mercury belongs to the Whole Pill Dao.”

To Li Xizhi, it sounded like something of Metal Virtue, but the three metals were Swamp Metal, Geng Metal, and Xiao Metal. There was nothing called the Whole Pill. So he asked, “Is it a metallic essence?”

Yang Ruizao shook his head and said, “If you’re referring to classifications like the Five Waters as Water Virtue, the Five Fires as Fire Virtue, the Twelve Qi, primal magnetism, or yin and yang. The Whole Pill Dao doesn’t fall under any of these. It’s part of what we call Ancient Merging Techniques.

“The Xiukui from the Great Xiukui Temple, the Jade True of the True Monarch Shangyuan, even the Hengzhu of the Hengzhu Dao, all fall under this category. They often carry an air of shamanic mystery, ambiguity between real and illusory, and the ancient alchemical flavor of mercury-ingesting and metal-seeking.

“From descriptions alone... Secret White Mercury is truly mysterious and profound. While it may not excel in direct combat compared to modern techniques, it can do so much more in so many other areas...”

Li Xizhi quietly took note of it and thought to himself, Since I’ve inherited someone else’s Dao lineage, if I can gather the right spiritual qi and when I can take on disciples in the future, at least one of them should cultivate this Dao...

After putting the jade slip away, he saw another stream of Heavenly Glow flying in from the south. Yang Ruizao looked up in surprise, did a quick calculation, and said, “Looks like it’s the fourth wave of reinforcements, the sect has sent most of its own by now, and it’s probably time to conscript from the various esteemed families.”

Li Xizhi nodded. Then Yang Ruizao asked, “I wonder if your name is on the list...”

The two exchanged a glance, and Li Xizhi simply nodded. Yang Ruizao smiled and said, “Yes, even if the deployment orders haven’t arrived yet... all the benefits have already been handed over. You’ll definitely be sent.”

Though he said it lightly, Yang Ruizao’s expression gradually grew serious. He spoke in a low voice, “There are only two more rounds of dispatch left. Xizhi, you should head out early. If you miss the timing, someone may use it against you.”

Li Xizhi nodded. The two rose into the air together, watching intently as the massive yet elegant Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner folded its long glowing wings and slowly descended into the formation array.

From all thirty-six peaks, people took to the skies. Li Xizhi and his brother-in-law Yang Ruizao stood amidst the clouds, watching as the defensive formation on the cloudliner also faded. Yang Ruizao asked, “I wonder who’s leading the team?”

Just then, as the glowing formation gradually vanished, they saw a golden-armored cultivator standing at the ship’s bow. He had deep-set eyes, broad shoulders, thick white brows and hair, and slightly narrowed old eyes. A fierce golden bow was slung across his back.

The old man’s armor shimmered with white light in the glow as he stood with hands behind his back. Yang Ruizao was slightly startled. He glanced at Li Xizhi beside him and said with a smile, “So it’s Li Xuanfeng, the Golden Bowstring.”

Since Li Xuanfeng was leading this ship, Li Xizhi would naturally go along. He was just about to fly toward the cloudliner when Yang Ruizao beside him paused slightly and said, “My family also has two brothers... They’ll be joining as well.”

Li Xizhi understood the unspoken request at once and, without waiting for him to continue, smiled and said, “Brother-in-law, go ahead and bring them. We’ll head out together, it’ll be good to look after each other on the journey.”

“Much appreciated,” said Yang Ruizao as he took his leave with a smile. Li Xizhi, however, paused thoughtfully, There's no telling whether brother-in-law got wind of the deployment early and wants the Yang Family to accompany my uncle, all under the guise of coincidence...

The Chi Family was exerting heavy influence in this matter. Aside from several peaks under the command of Daoist Master Yuan Xiu, most others had sent direct descendants. Yang Ruizao himself might very well be heading out too.

Li Xizhi wasn’t bothered as relations between esteemed families weren’t built on sentiment alone, but on mutual benefit. The Yang Family had many daughters, and for Yang Ruizao to maintain closeness with him, it was partly due to his own strong cultivation and partly because the Li Family was now powerful. Had the Li Family still been as weak as during Li Tongya’s fall, this brother-in-law would’ve offered little more than a polite smile in passing. None of these connections would exist.

He reviewed everything in his mind but didn’t immediately seek out Li Xuanfeng. Instead, he flew to the General Affairs Hall and used his new command token to receive his official assignment.

Station at Baixiang Valley, on the border of Xu State near Mount Bianyan. Await further orders. Mission: resist devil cultivators...

He stored the token away, retrieved a map for careful study, and after some thought, decided to make a stop at the Sutra Repository just in case.

This Complete Mercury Ingestion Method was, after all, a secret technique left on the peak, there might be a different section or version, he thought.

He searched for about fifteen minutes and borrowed the sect’s copy of Complete Mercury Ingestion Method. After a detailed comparison, he was slightly disappointed.

“The two versions are identical. The only difference is that the one from the peak isn’t restricted. I can bring it back home,” muttered Li Xizhi.

After inquiring, he learned the sect had some White Mercury Cinnabar Elixir available. He returned the borrowed text, boarded the Dawn Cloudliner, and found a private chamber to settle into.

Li Xuanfeng had gone to the main hall to report. Only members of the Ning Family came over to greet him politely.

Li Xizhi waited a little while, and the Yang Family members soon arrived. He recognized a few of the brothers by face, perhaps he’d seen them once when fetching Yang Xiao’er. They followed him into the cabin.

The Yang Family, descended from the ancient Yue kings. They had deep roots and an extensive legacy. Though they had gone through periods of decline, they had now regained stability and begun to display their profound foundation once more.

But Li Xizhi also clearly saw the flaws. In the chaos of earlier times, the Yang Family’s secular branches had been nearly wiped out. With their numbers dwindled, they only had a single peak within the Azure Pond Sect. Children often began cultivation from birth, and the extinction of sub-branches was common.

Moreover, the Yang Family had no external holdings or industries. Nearly every member embodied the aloofness of esteemed family disciples. They were detached from worldly matters, indulgent, and carefree. Having cultivated exclusively atop immortal peaks since youth, they were even more extreme than other families.

Now, gathered before Li Xizhi, they greeted him politely but quickly withdrew to the side, joking amongst themselves without the slightest awareness of the life-or-death battle ahead. Their Dharma robes were bright, but their cultivation was shallow. They gave off an air of frivolity, and that was the better part of it. One of them was only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, with his blood qi murky. What’s worse, he had brought along a woman of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She was strikingly beautiful and her cultivation method was peculiar, likely of the furnace vessel variety.

Li Xizhi scanned the room but found no one truly noteworthy. His brother-in-law must not have had an easy time managing this lot.

That said... if even one of them can make it through the bloodshed, it might be worth watching. With that thought, a faint eagerness stirred within him, If there’s an opportunity that isn’t too perilous, perhaps I could bring along the younger ones from the Radiant Lure generation.

Li Xizhi rested briefly as the cloud ship beneath his feet began to move. A man at the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm approached from outside the door. He had a pale face without a beard, hair white as snow, bearing a dignified air. Only one sleeve hung empty, and he stopped beside Li Xizhi.

He cupped his hands in greeting and said softly, "I am Fei Yihe. Greetings, young master."

Li Xizhi found the name vaguely familiar, likely one of the Fei Family members who had accompanied them back then. In recent years, under the care of Li Xuanfeng, he had survived despite being covered in wounds.

Li Xizhi returned the courtesy and replied gently, "Xizhi greets the senior."

He then recalled his uncle Li Yuanqin, who had been stationed in the southern border. He was likely younger than himself, though what he looked like now was anyone’s guess. He asked, "I wonder if my uncle has come... I must see him at least once..."

Fei Yihe shook his head and replied, "The master was sent into the sect to cultivate alongside disciples of the Chi Family."
𝐟𝐫𝕖𝗲𝘄𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝕧𝐞𝚕.𝕔𝕠𝐦

Upon hearing this, Li Xizhi’s heart became clear as a mirror. He sighed inwardly, while Fei Yihe appeared somewhat anxious, taking a seat beside him and asking, "I've spent many years in the southern border, often in seclusion. The general has marched to the Eastern Sea once again. I've only heard scattered words about the Fei Family. May I ask, Peak Master... How is my family doing? What realms have Tongyu and Tongxiao reached?"

Li Xizhi nodded slightly and answered, "At present, Young Master Tongyu manages the household. We've lost contact with them, so I know little. I’ve only heard that Young Master Tongxiao failed to make a breakthrough and perished, his Dao and lineage ended."

The news seemed to match the old man's expectations. He showed no visible shock, but at the words ‘perished, Dao ended,’ his fingers trembled on his knee, and he said somewhat at a loss, "Ah... I knew that boy."

Li Xizhi then recounted all the information he knew. Fei Yihe nodded in thanks repeatedly but could say nothing more. He sat upright in his seat, sleeves gathered, remaining silent for most of the journey.

The Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner was incredibly fast. In just a short while, it began to show signs of stopping. Only then did Fei Yihe shake out his sleeve, revealing a hand gone pale from gripping tightly. He pulled out a small letter he had written long ago and said, "If there’s a chance, may I trouble Peak Master to deliver this letter... to the Fei Family on my behalf?"

Over the years, every time Li Xuanfeng returned home, Fei Yihe would ask him to bring a letter. By now, there were at least three, if not five. Had anything changed in the Fei Family? Likely not. Yet this old man remained incessant, faithfully writing every time. Though he never opened the letters, even an outsider could see the sincerity in his heart.

Li Xizhi could see it clearly and sighed inwardly. He put the letter away and replied, "If the chance comes, I will certainly deliver it for you, senior."

Fei Yihe nodded. As he watched the cloudliner gradually descend, he finally couldn’t hold back and said quietly, "If one day... the Fei Family collapses... if it's within your power, I beg you to preserve at least one bloodline..."

Li Xizhi did not dare to promise, so he could only respond gently, "With Daoist Friend Qingyi cultivating in Yuanwu, your esteemed family will surely overcome adversity. The elders will also look after things. Please rest assured, senior..."

Fei Yihe nodded and said no more. After some time, Li Xuanfeng stepped inside, with his golden armor already removed. He spoke softly, "So, Xizhi, you’ve arrived."

Li Xuanfeng gave a slight nod and continued, "We’ll make our first stop in Xu State to meet the people of the Golden Feather Sect."

Li Xizhi followed him to the bow of the ship. A cold northern wind stirred gently. They had already crossed the great river that divided north and south. Waves churned, and the water current surged mightily.

Only after crossing the great river did the spiritual atmosphere completely change. The surroundings turned a dusky yellow-gray. The ground was dry and cracked, scattered with white bones. The air was filled with the lingering presence of blood and resentment.

Several escape lights streaked across the sky. When they saw the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner emerge, they all turned back. These people seemed experienced, after flying a short distance, they dived straight into the earth and vanished into the gray smoke.

Li Xizhi watched for a moment, then asked aloud, "Uncle, do you know how the conscription of the various families will be arranged?"

Li Xuanfeng’s armor had actually lost its spiritual glow back when the two True Monarchs, Pristine Water and Taiyuan, had taken action. Now it was little more than a few pieces of hanging metal and would require significant effort to repair.

Since his return was brief, he had yet to repair it and had already stored it away. Upon hearing Li Xizhi’s question, he answered, "Naturally, it won't be for us to handle. When the time comes, Dawn Cloudliner will arrive at various places to conscript cultivators. According to the sect’s directives..."

Li Xuanfeng paused, then continued, "As an initial precaution, forty-five percent of each family’s cultivators will be drafted to Mount Bianyan. If the fighting intensifies, more will be summoned..."

Li Xizhi listened in silence and softly said, "If forty-five percent of a family's cultivators are taken, it’s like breaking their bones... I had wondered how many of our family’s cultivators would be sent. Now it seems there’s no escaping it."

"Indeed." Li Xuanfeng stood quietly, then spoke after a while, "In the mountains, blades and spears spare no one, yet for small families, opportunities abound. Resources and dharma artifacts they normally couldn’t dream of, today, they can find them just by scavenging two corpses. Great chaos brings great opportunity."

The two chatted for a while, then a few people approached. Li Xizhi took a closer look. The leader wore a flowing dharma robe that shimmered with light. It was his brother-in-law, Yang Ruizao.

Just earlier on the ship, Yang Ruizao had gathered a few close Daoist friends. Several of them were at the Foundation Establishment Realm and now followed behind him, bowing respectfully toward Li Xuanfeng and saying, "Greetings, senior!"

Li Xuanfeng nodded in acknowledgment, asking each of their names in turn. Yang Ruizao stepped closer, and the three of them stood together at the bow of the ship, signaling unity in leadership aboard, with Li Xuanfeng at the head.

Yang Ruizao gave Li Xizhi a look and spoke softly, his tone tinged with helplessness, "You’ve met those younger ones from my family, right, Xizhi? What did you think?"

Li Xizhi smiled and nodded, replying, "Very polite and composed."

Though the words were praise, Yang Ruizao understood the subtext. He sighed and said, "Let’s hope they improve."

As they conversed, Mount Bianyan gradually came into view. The mountain lay at the center of Xu State's twenty-three southern cities. It was an ideal position for dispatching reinforcements in all directions. It was shrouded in white mist, giving off a faintly eerie atmosphere.

While the younger ones chatted, Li Xuanfeng grew absent-minded. He still vividly remembered these mountains and the Zhenhui Temple atop them. He had once come here with his uncle to capture a wolf demonic beast. By now, the place had likely fallen to ruin...

Xuanling... The name of his younger brother echoed in his heart, though his expression remained blank. Only Li Xizhi, behind him, seemed to notice something and glanced at him quietly.

Mount Qingdu.

While Li Xuanfeng and his party traveled north, another Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner descended at Moongaze Lake. It gleamed with the same soft, glowing hues, and was now resting atop Milin Mountain. The various households around the lake rushed to send representatives.

Cultivators bustled up and down Milin Mountain. Li Xijun stood atop the jade platform on the mountain's summit, gazing at the silently landed Dawn Cloudliner with a somewhat complicated expression. He thought to himself, Truth be told... this is the first time our family has hosted a Dawn Cloudliner. Though unexpected, it does mean we’re recognized as a voice of authority in the region.

He waited on the platform for a moment. Beside him stood Chen Donghe and An Zheyan, both at the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. On the other side were An Siming and An Siwei, who had also reached the same stage. The two brothers had just returned from the desert, so they were still dusty and travel-worn.

Li Xijun’s calculations back then hadn’t been wrong. Now, among the Li Family’s esteemed ones and core lineage, there were only seven late stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, and the An Family alone accounted for three. Even this year, the brothers' offspring had made breakthroughs in the Qi Cultivation Realm. The An bloodline was extraordinarily potent, it was something everyone knew.

Still, none had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. That said, the two brothers were unquestionably loyal, the type who followed orders without a word of complaint. This gave Li Xijun a measure of reassurance.

The Chen and An Families were the strongest. Lined up behind them were the Tian, Dou, and Xu Families. Further back stood Dili Youjie of Northern Mount Yue and Li Jiman and Shamoli of Eastern Mount Yue, off to the side. As for the surrendered tribes and families settled in Mount Yue, they didn’t even qualify to stand on the platform.

Shamoli was an elder of his family. He had been the first King of Eastern Mount Yue, rising to power after pledging allegiance to the Li Family. He practiced thunder arts and had even met Li Tongya. Thunder arts consumed lifespan, and the methods practiced by this old Mount Yue cultivator were far from orthodox. He aged faster than most and now stood in the back, eyes half-closed, saying nothing.

At the lake now, aside from the Li and Fei Families, only the small families from the eastern and northern shores remained. All greeted the Li Family respectfully. The Fei Family stood to the side, hesitant and uncertain.

After a short wait, a man in white robes flew down from the Dawn Cloudliner. Dressed in ornate garments with a splendid crown, he descended from the ship with a faint smile and presented a jade seal.

He parted his lips lightly and spoke, "By the immortal order of the sect, Yuanwu Peak’s period of governance has ended. Moongaze Lake and the eastern banks, including the Lixia Families, are henceforth placed under the jurisdiction of Moon Lake Peak!"

The crowd fell into a thunderous bow and responded in unison, "Greetings to the Emissary of the Immortal Sect!"

Good! As expected, it’s the Moon Lake Peak! thought Li Xijun.

Li Xijun led the response, but inwardly, he caught several layers of implication. Since the Xiao Family broke away and took most of Lixia Prefecture with them, the region had been fractured. Now, judging from the emissary’s words, what remained was to be carved off and attached to Moongaze Lake’s domain.

It wasn’t a trivial matter. Though it technically made Moongaze Lake’s territory larger, it wasn’t really good news. After all, with the Xiao Family nearby, these lands essentially belonged to them and were untouchable.

As Li Xijun was deep in thought, the white-robed cultivator descended from the clouds and came forward with a gentle smile, reaching out to help him up, speaking kindly, "My master is in seclusion, attempting a breakthrough and couldn’t come in person. I am Zhao Tinggui, first disciple of Moon Lake Peak. I’ve come on her behalf... No need for formality, Xijun!"

Naturally, the Peak Master in seclusion referred to Ning Wan. The two families were indeed close, and Zhao Tinggui carried himself with a humble demeanor, smiling as he urged Li Xijun to rise. Li Xijun didn’t dare be careless and returned the courtesy. Only then did Zhao Tinggui return to the ship above and speak softly, "My visit this time follows a sect order, we are to conscript cultivators."

His smile faded gradually, though his tone remained polite. He looked toward the surrounding minor families and said gently, "This military conscription concerns territories assigned to me and my fellow brothers at Moon Lake Peak. Our merit and lives are at stake. Do not think to fob me off with cultivators bearing various unrefined qi."

He paused for a moment, then said in a soft tone, "If I note which family’s disciples are too poor in quality, and return a few months later to conscript again, there will be blood."

Zhao Tinggui looked every bit the refined young gentleman, but his words were far from mild. Several nearby family heads exchanged nervous glances, all too frightened to speak. Zhao Tinggui went on, "If a family's disciples perform well and earn merit, I, too, will not withhold rewards. Not to mention, the battlefield offers great opportunities. You should put forth your most capable ones."

Watching the scene unfold, Li Xijun knew full well, though Zhao Tinggui seemed to be warning the minor families, his words were just as much meant for him. No matter how close their two families were, matters concerning life, death and merit couldn’t be taken lightly.

Just as that thought crossed his mind, a group of disciples in blue robes descended from the cloudliner. Zhao Tinggui waved his hand and said softly, "Each of you, bring your assigned people aboard."

Then he turned toward Li Xijun, came closer with great politeness, and extended a hand as white as jade, saying, "Xijun... let us discuss this thoroughly."

The two descended into the peak together and sat down in a grand hall built of white jade. After exchanging a few polite pleasantries, Zhao Tinggui casually said, "I wonder how many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators your esteemed family can spare?"

Li Xijun sighed and replied softly, "I'm sure you know, Tinggui... most of our seniors and brothers have likely already headed north..."

Zhao Tinggui couldn’t allow him to dodge so easily, thinking to himself, Sure, Li Xuanfeng and Li Xizhi are making contributions, but not on behalf of Moon Lake Peak! If I could secure even one of them, I wouldn’t have to worry about a thing. I could relax in the sect with peace of mind... Why would I need to come all this way otherwise?

He quickly raised a hand, his expression turning solemn as he said gravely, "Xijun, you’re a clever man, and our families are close. I won’t speak in circles with you."

Zhao Tinggui gently set down his teacup, "Elder Qinghong must be deployed... I don't know about others, but she might well rival our peak's core disciples. And being of the Thunder Dao lineage, she’s perfectly suited for a post of defense."

Li Xijun pondered for a moment and gave a slight nod. Zhao Tinggui paused briefly, then continued gently, "We’ll also need one mid-stage and one early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to establish a foothold first."

Zhao Tinggui had already made his calculations. Li Ximing of the Li Family was likely a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator and a rare alchemist. If he could bring him to the northern front, it would reduce casualties significantly...

Li Xijun thought for a while, then replied, "Reporting to the Emissary, my family has a buddhist guest cultivator, a Master Monk, whose strength more than equals a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. We also have a mid-stage demonic cultivator, though lacking lineage and spell arts, his combat power is at least equivalent to an early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator."

Zhao Tinggui showed brief surprise, then frowned and asked, "What of Daoist Ximing...?"

"He’s in seclusion, attempting a breakthrough. He won’t be available anytime soon..." Li Xijun gave a gentle excuse.

Zhao Tinggui sighed as he heard it, and could only say, "Very well, there’s no need to rush. Let’s proceed as you suggest for now. But if the front becomes critical, we may still need Daoist Ximing to act. If things truly become dire... we might even have to trouble you, Xijun..."

He agreed.

Li Xijun nodded politely and said, "Of course."

Zhao Tinggui acknowledged with a nod, then said with hesitation, "As for the Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, the Ning Family has already been assigned elsewhere. The main burden will fall upon your esteemed family..."

Though Li Xijun had anticipated this, unease still rose within him. He thought to himself, The Chi Family truly squeezes out every drop of value...

Among all the families, the Li Family had one of the largest pools of low-level cultivators. They were especially generous with outsiders, freely sharing cultivation methods. Li Xijun believed that Chi Zhiyun would undoubtedly be tempted by this and simply asked, "How many cultivators are required?"

Zhao Tinggui replied awkwardly, "Five late-stage, seven mid-stage, twenty-seven early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, and one hundred Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators... all must be of orthodox spiritual alignment..."

"What?!" exclaimed Li Xijun.




# Chapter 746: Parting

Li Xijun felt a chill rise in his heart. This single conscription request would nearly empty out the Li Family. After calculating carefully, he realized the numbers had been set with precision, exactly seventy percent of their available cultivators.

He almost instinctively reacted, unable to hide his displeasure, and blurted out, "What?!"

Zhao Tinggui could only respond with an awkward chuckle. Li Xijun quickly composed himself and said softly, "Forgive my rudeness."

Zhao Tinggui quickly waved it off with a faintly apologetic look. He didn't want to offend the Li Family, but these people had to be taken. With lives and legacies on the line, no amount of courtesy or sentiment could change that. He simply drank his tea in silence.

Seeing his stance, Li Xijun had no choice but to speak up himself, softly, "Honored Emissary... There's truly no justification for this. Even the average esteemed family wouldn’t face such a sweeping draft. Our family stands guard over Moongaze Lake, bearing the brunt of impact and serving as a barrier for Azure Pond Sect... I ask that you consider this carefully."

Though Zhao Tinggui was Moon Lake Peak’s senior disciple, he came from a humble mortal background and had only been taken as a disciple by Ning Wan through a stroke of luck.

Now a loyal follower of the Ning Family, he feared no ordinary esteemed family but even so, facing the Li Family, he felt some apprehension and simply said, "I am merely carrying out orders..."

The two sides remained at an impasse for a while. Though Li Xijun hadn’t known exactly which peak would send an envoy, he had done his homework on the likely candidates. Recognizing Zhao Tinggui, he sensed hesitation in the man which meant there was room to maneuver. He thought, He came from humble roots, and it was his talent and disposition that earned Ning Wan’s favor. He’s smooth with people and not without kindness. If I apply the right pressure... there may be room to negotiate.

Li Xijun gradually fell silent. Zhao Tinggui pondered a moment, then finally gritted his teeth and said, "Our two families do have a long-standing bond... so I’ll speak plainly. There are two conditions..."

He spoke in a low, serious tone, "Your family’s core bloodline, especially those of your own generation should accompany the expedition."

The moment these words left his mouth, Li Xijun understood, So that’s what this is really about...

Zhao Tinggui’s calculations were focused here. If the Li Family’s core bloodline went to the battlefield, then should anything happen, the Li Family would be compelled to intervene. And those not under Moon Lake Peak’s control, like Li Xuanfeng and Li Xizhi, would be even less likely to stand idle. And once those two were drawn in, if the situation escalated further, it could even prompt the Yang and Xiao Families to intervene as well...

Li Xijun saw the situation clearly and sighed inwardly. If Zhao Tinggui had come prepared, then his intentions were all the more evident. He thought, It seems Yuexiang must go as well...

Li Yuexiang was Li Xizhi’s younger sister, and from how Li Xuanfeng had acted during the Yuan Family incident, it was clear she held a special place in his heart. Zhao Tinggui had surely calculated this and was aiming to ensure she went along.

After a moment’s thought, Li Xijun nodded silently and gave the order, "Go, summon Yuexiang."

Seeing Li Xijun’s action, Zhao Tinggui’s expression brightened slightly as he continued, "There is another matter. I’ve heard your esteemed family possesses a herb called the Wanglin Blossom that soothes sorrow and extends life. If your family could provide it for six of my junior brothers, I would be deeply grateful."

It wasn’t an unreasonable request. Li Xijun had already reserved some for his direct lineage. Though it would be a bit tight to give some away now, their stock could still last a year or two. He nodded slightly.

Zhao Tinggui looked genuinely pleased and said, "On behalf of my junior brothers, I thank your esteemed family!"

Li Xijun’s thoughts, however, were still on the arrangements for his family. Zhao Tinggui paused briefly, then continued, "Back to the matter of personnel, if your family is strained, you needn’t send quite as many at once.

"Four late-stage, four mid-stage, nineteen early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, and eighty Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators... how does that sound?"

Li Xijun understood this was the result of dual compromise and could only sigh, "If the sect has issued the order, the Li Family shall naturally obey."

As they spoke, a young woman entered the courtyard. She had willowy brows and almond eyes, wore a flowing white dress, and carried a longsword at her waist. She seemed to have just finished a cultivation session as traces of golden-red flame still flickered across her form.

Li Xijun said softly, "This is my younger sister, Li Yuexiang.

"This is the emissary of Moon Lake Peak, Senior Zhao Tinggui."

Zhao Tinggui glanced at her and returned the gesture with a formal salute. Though Li Xijun already knew her answer, he still turned to his sister and asked, "Our family is to serve under Moon Lake Peak, but we still lack a strong enough core bloodline representative. Yuexiang, would you be willing to take on this duty?"

Li Yuexiang simply smiled and said, "I’ve been idle at home long enough. It’s good to finally be of use. Arrange as you see fit, brother."

Li Xijun let the two formally exchange greetings, then turned to Zhao Tinggui with a smile and said, "Do not underestimate the women of our family, Emissary. Yuexiang is not some delicate lady of the boudoir, she will be of great help in the north."

Zhao Tinggui quickly agreed. Li Yuexiang, after hearing their arrangement, responded gently, "I’ll go now to assemble the people."

She left swiftly. Zhao Tinggui took a glance at her departing figure and sipped his tea. Li Xijun, deep in thought, spoke softly, "Yuexiang is our youngest sister. We brothers all cherish her dearly. I ask that the Emissary look after her."

After all, Li Yuexiang’s presence already signaled the Li Family’s intent to support. Naturally, they would intervene if something happened. Li Xijun had no intention of letting this man treat her like a mere pawn. His words carried a subtle warning as he said, "My little sister is in your hands, Daoist Friend."

Zhao Tinggui simply replied, "Rest assured, Xijun. I am not such a base man. If anything happens to Daoist Yuexiang, you may hold me personally accountable."

"Good. Then I ask that the Emissary go with her to choose people from the family," said Li Xijun.

Zhao Tinggui nodded and took his leave, leaving Li Xijun alone in the hall. After a moment’s contemplation, he refilled his teacup and murmured, "Zhao Tinggui is still unmarried, and he’s only thirty-nine... The Ning Family has reportedly broached marriage talks several times, but he declined each time, citing cultivation as his priority."

He did not believe for a moment that Zhao Tinggui's glance had been one of lust. Nor could he imagine that someone who had risen from a humble mortal household, who had boarded the Ning Family’s vessel and carved his way to become the head disciple of Moon Lake Peak through sheer talent and tenacity, would pine for beauty in his presence. It was, at most, a signal, nothing more.

If one seeks background and temperament, or beauty and talent. My little sister is indeed a match for him...

A flicker of coldness passed through his handsome eyes as he recalled Zhao Tinggui’s subtle message, thinking, He's striking the mountain to shake the tiger, advancing and retreating with control, killing three birds with one stone, and balancing personal and political matters. A capable man indeed. But it all depends on what Yuexiang thinks. Once she's spent time with him and sees his true character... she’ll know where she stands.

News of the Celestial Sect’s decree had spread earlier, and the Li Family had received word internally as well. Now that the Dawn Cloudliner had arrived and several esteemed family leaders descended the mountain, the message was perfectly clear.

Li Yuexiang descended the mountain to meet Li Chengliao, who was overwhelmed with tasks. Only when his aunt landed gracefully did he hurry forward to greet her.

"They want nineteen early stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, and they have to be orthodox cultivators... can’t be substandard..." said Li Yuexiang.

After reviewing the numbers, Li Chengliao realized that even if they filled the list with outer surnames, a few of their own brothers would still need to go. Not to mention, they needed to leave some power behind for the esteemed house. If there were too few cultivators with the Li surname, Zhao Tinggui likely wouldn’t be satisfied.

"An Zheyan, Li Chengchu, Chen Mufeng, Li Wen... these will cover the late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators...

"Li Minggong, Li Chengyou..."

He finished the list. Li Yuexiang reviewed it and found the arrangements sound. An Siwei from the An Family was being left behind, and their own core line had contributions. She asked, "With these people sent out, what strength remains in the family?"

"Elder Chen and others remain... As for the Radiant Lure generation, only Chenghuai and Chengxi, who is stationed at the Eastern Sea, are left. Most others with decent cultivation will be sent out."

Li Yuexiang replied softly, nodding, "Your arrangements are sound. Go ahead and summon them."

Li Chengliao nodded. Then Li Yuexiang said softly, "In my view... the northern campaign won’t be easy. As time drags on, more rounds of conscription will follow. They won’t rest until all the major families are hollowed out. Watch over the household, we may need to send more later."

Li Chengliao understood and took out several storage pouches, saying, "All provisions and pills are prepared here. Take care, Aunt."

As the two were speaking, those summoned had gathered outside the hall. Li Yuexiang stepped out of the inner hall and saw Zhao Tinggui descending on a breeze.

Just as Zhao Tinggui left Mount Qingdu, thoughts had already begun stirring in his heart, I’ve seen Li Xizhi before. He is refined, noble, undeniably worthy of an esteemed family’s core bloodline. We never spoke. But Li Xijun... he’s truly a hard man to deal with.

Zhao Tinggui had met many people in the sect, including the likes of Yu Muxian and couldn’t help but sigh inwardly, Moongaze Lake really is a land of talent and destiny. How many figures have emerged from here over the past century? Nearly every storm of the era seems to touch this place.

Returning to his senses and looking at the two, Zhao Tinggui, always courteous in speech, simply said, "Greetings, Daoist Friends."

Li Yuexiang replied respectfully. Zhao Tinggui immediately looked over the gathered cultivators below, pointed out a few to be replaced, added new ones, checked the list twice, and asked, "Your family has very few who cultivate wood or earth Dao but quite a few thunder Dao cultivators."

He smiled and continued without waiting for a response, "It matters little, I have two junior brothers who specialize in wood and earth. They’ll fill the gap. Thunder cultivators, however, are rare and valuable."

Li Yuexiang smiled faintly. Zhao Tinggui said nothing more, only spoke softly, "Then let it be settled. Submit the list to me, boarding begins in four hours."

"Please allow the family's disciples time to bid farewell to their families..." Li Yuexiang turned and looked at the disciples below, most wore complex expressions, though a few seemed eager. She addressed them, "This journey is a matter of life and death and of opportunity. Go now and bid your families farewell. In one hour, gather at the Dawn Cloudliner in Milin Prefecture."

The crowd responded in unison and dispersed. Li Yuexiang went to the peak to pay respects to her parents and bid farewell to her brother. Li Xijun handed her a few talismans and said quietly, "Above all, protect your own safety first. I’ve spoken with Zhao Tinggui, he will see to your well-being."

Zhao Tinggui gestured for her to proceed. After bidding farewell, Li Yuexiang left with him toward the cloudliner. The area was filled with mourning and gloom. On the vast vessel, few faces looked pleasant.

Moon Lake Peak had shown courtesy to the Li Family but to the smaller families, they had simply taken people by force. After all, asking these minor families one by one would take until tomorrow, and the ship didn’t have the manpower to spare.

The area echoed with weeping. These people practiced crude techniques. Among a whole group of elders, they couldn’t muster three proper spell arts. For them, heading north likely meant working to death.

As for killing enemies and earning treasures, not only was it unclear if they could kill any, even if they did, whether they’d be allowed to keep what they got was uncertain. All they could hope was that Moon Lake Peak acted with fairness.

Zhao Tinggui, seeing all this clearly, deliberately raised his voice, "Fellow Daoists, Xu State is not like Jiangnan. Do not despair... Xu State is unlike any other region, it is filled with opportunity."

As the highest-ranking figure present, once he spoke, all eyes turned to him. He smiled and said, "Xu State is a land of constant strife, filled with countless spirit husk cave dwelling and chaotic spiritual aura. The demonic, buddhist, and immortal Daos clash endlessly. The Great Void itself is a storm, its aura shifts multiple times a day, triggering countless opportunities...

"Now, neither the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators see it clearly nor Maha can divine it. Omens everywhere. Grotto heavens open and close, ancient ruins rise... Rain falls as jade, the earth rolls with gold and stone... Pristine water shimmer."

As he spoke, many faces changed and greed began to show. Zhao Tinggui smiled and added, "You’ve all come, why wallow in gloom? Better to strive with all your might and seize your chance. Perhaps after a year, you’ll return riding the wind... as Foundation Establishment Realm or even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!"

Li Yuexiang quietly shook her head. Reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm was still possible but reaching Purple Mansion Realm just from a trip to Xu State was pure fantasy. Yet many below were tempted, murmuring questions about spiritual aura, which they didn’t even understand.

Zhao Tinggui, hearing a few confused questions, explained, "A region's spiritual aura is the flow of its spiritual energy. Its scope may be vast or narrow and often aligns with symbolic essences like metallic essence allowing it to resonate with certain grotto heavens or cause fated opportunities to manifest... The more chaotic the area, the smaller and more frequent the changes..."

"For instance, in a condition like Falling Water Rising Storm, it’s easier to connect with a thunder arts grotto heaven. Xu State now changes three times a day, with nine types in one region. Naturally, there will be many pportunities."

The crowd stirred with chatter. Some began asking what metallic essence was. Zhao Tinggui realized this line of explanation could go on forever, but the atmosphere had improved so he stopped speaking.

Li Yuexiang watched quietly. A few of the younger cultivators showed promising talent and bright, eager eyes tinged with hope.

When the times change, all hope to be the dragon or serpent that rises from the land... thought Li Yuexiang.

Not just the young, though sorrowful, few among the gathered lacked some sliver of hope. Each dreamed of perhaps being the one destined for greatness in this era.

At Mount Bianyan, danger and opportunity walked hand in hand. Who knew what spells, dharma artifacts, resources, or pills one might stumble upon?

After a while, her family members gathered. The cloudliner began to move, and Mount Qingdu slowly disappeared from view.

Soon, the scenery beneath began to shift. Desert villages, jagged stones, fields full of bones, and flickering dharma light could be seen from above. Only when the great river appeared below did Li Yuexiang begin to feel she had truly left home.

Just as Zhao Tinggui had described, the world grew misty. To the east, the fog shimmered gold like a blazing sun. To the south, it was heavier. It was cold and ominous, with no visible boundary.

My brothers always sought to shield me, leaving no place for my hand. At last, I have a chance to contribute.

She felt no fear, only a quiet sense of peace. She gazed silently northward until Mount Bianyan appeared on the horizon. Then her expression grew complicated, thinking, There should be a Zhenhui Temple on that mountain...

Zhenhui Temple was not well known, and now reduced to ruins but in the hearts of the Li Family, it stood equal to the southern border. In the mists of a mountain ravine, she thought she could just make it out and stared for a long time.




# Chapter 748: Tuoba

Xu State.

The cultivators of Azure Pond Sect had gradually gathered, while in the north, only the occasional streaks of devilish and colorful light flashed by like flying shuttles, hidden deep in thick haze, making it impossible to see clearly.

But Li Xizhi had received word that both buddhist cultivators and devil cultivators from the north were gradually arriving in Xu State. Of the Seven Daos, three had already come, and even the Yan State had sent a group of devil cultivators, all silently surveying the surroundings.

Mount Bianyan was shrouded in mist. Li Xizhi had been stationed here for several days and had learned much. He and Li Xuanfeng were both guarding the eastern flank, not too far and not too close from their Moongaze Lake.

“We are stationed in this area. Those minor buddhist and devil cultivators coming down from the south are of little consequence. The main forces we must face are two.

“The Dao of Great Desire and the Tuoba Family of devil cultivators from Yan State...”

Li Xizhi’s strength was already quite formidable; ordinary cultivators couldn’t keep him in check. Only Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from these two Immortal Sect could truly threaten his life, so he paid extra attention to them.

“The Baixiang Valley I’m heading to is often frequented by devil cultivators, and even direct descendants of the Tuoba Family have made appearances there...”

He checked the time, cultivators from the rear should be arriving soon. After landing in the formation, he watched the comings and goings of cultivators and, after a moment, found Yang Ruizao.

His brother-in-law was seated upright in the courtyard, holding a small letter in his hand, frowning deeply.

Seeing Li Xizhi approach, Yang Ruizao quickly flipped his hand to put the letter away, stepped forward, and said softly, “Xizhi... the assignments for each peak have been issued, and the cloudliners should have already arrived.”

“I wonder how things are at home...” Li Xizhi hurried to ask, and Yang Ruizao responded, “Moongaze Lake was assigned to the Moon Lake Peak of the Ning Family... Though it’s technically a return to its rightful owners, I heard the Ning Family pulled a lot of strings to force out several ambitious immortal peaks.”

As expected, it fell into the hands of Moon Lake Peak. Li Xizhi had somewhat anticipated this and instantly felt a headache coming on. He thought to himself, But the Ning Family already has their hands full with staffing Yuanxing Peak and Cave Spring Peak... and now they’ve added Moon Lake Peak on top of that... how will they have enough manpower...

The Ning Family is short on manpower. To guard all these territories... they’ll surely need to draw heavily from my family’s forces...

Li Xizhi gave it a brief thought, and quickly gained a clear grasp of the situation. It all became evident to him, Moon Lake Peak of the Ning Family got Moongaze Lake just as they wished. This must be Chi Zhiyun’s deliberate scheme... With the Ning Family short on manpower, they’ll inevitably offend my family by heavily demanding reinforcements...

If the Ning Family fails to defend the place and people die, they’ll be severely punished by the sect and secretly blame our family for not putting in enough effort. Meanwhile, if our dispatched members suffer casualties, the Ning Family will just come asking for more reinforcements. Resentment in our household will be inevitable...

He found the whole thing rather thorny as he thought, Shifting Azure Pond Sect’s internal conflict onto the families... What a troublesome move...

With Li Xijun at home, Li Xizhi wasn’t truly afraid of open conflict with Moon Lake Peak, He just needed to see how far they could compromise. After all, if the Ning Family couldn’t hold the land, his own family wouldn’t benefit either...

Li Xizhi understood this clearly and stayed silent for a moment. Yang Ruizao was still reading the letter with furrowed brows, speaking in a low voice, “As for the sect’s other territories... grievances are running high. And yet the Ning Family wants to send people here to borrow manpower from us... What kind of logic is that...”

Azure Pond Sect had divided territories among the peaks, allowing each to conscript people to head north. Initially, the command was to conscript forty to fifty percent. The peaks accepted the orders and set out by boat.

But upon arriving at the territories, they found vast stretches to defend. Except for a few peaks of major families from large commanderies, almost none had enough people. They had no choice but to increase conscription to sixty or seventy percent. Smaller families with no backing were pushed to the point of sending eighty to ninety percent of their cultivators, with some migrating entire families.

Li Xizhi was aware of these reports. He had seen much sorrow and hardship in the formations these past days. After a moment of silence, he quietly said, “The sect mainly values the Eastern Sea. Many fellow disciples are still guarding the islands there and haven’t been recalled. Naturally, there’s a shortage of manpower everywhere.”

Yang Ruizao understood what he meant and softly said, “In the past few days, many cultivators have voiced complaints, but this mountain simply must be held. If the buddhist and devil cultivators cross the Great River, they may not be able to breach Mount Azure Pond but the bloody storm will surely engulf most of Jiangnan.”
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝚠𝚎𝚋𝗻𝗼𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝚘𝐦

Li Xizhi nodded. He had gotten the information he needed and said simply, “I’ll head out for Baixiang Valley now. I came to say farewell.”

Yang Ruizao had been assigned elsewhere, and upon hearing this, he quickly stood up with a solemn expression and said softly, “I’ve already asked around about Baixiang Valley for you. It directly faces the Tuoba Family’s territory. That family has been orthodox devil cultivators since ancient times, and even produced a Golden Core Devil Monarch...

“Though they’ve declined terribly, even a broken ship still has iron. Be extremely careful. With your cultivation, as long as you stay cautious, you should avoid any serious harm.”

Li Xizhi had also made his own inquiries. He nodded silently, bid a peaceful farewell, and rode the wind into the skies, leaving Mount Yan behind and heading east.

After traveling a few hundred kilometers, the sky suddenly brightened, pouring glaring light across the land. Li Xizhi dimmed his rainbow light and flew over several cities to the south, slowly spotting a gorge ahead.

The gorge was filled with golden-yellow maple trees. Several escape lights drifted from north to south across the sky, and formations below glowed with light. Li Xizhi descended with a stream of Heavenly Glow, arriving just as a few devil cultivator-looking figures were snooping around the formation’s edge.

As Li Xizhi landed, his concealment techniques were superb. The group noticed nothing and continued moving through the grove below.

He simply flicked his sleeve, releasing several streams of Heavenly Glow. The glow had brilliantly colored, softly drifting through the forest, spiraling a few times before darting toward each of the men.

Those at the rear couldn’t react in time and were instantly bound tight, immobilized and tumbling to the ground. The ones in front turned back alertly, but with only Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivation, they couldn’t withstand it and fell one after another like rolling gourds.

Only the leader had mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivation. He reacted faster, drawing a dharma sword that shimmered with red light, blocking the oncoming glow with a reverse slash.

Clang!

With a crisp sound, the leading devil cultivator staggered from the impact. The rainbow light recoiled just an inch, then lunged forward again.

“What is this thing? Could it be spell art?”

This devil cultivator was from Zhao State and had spent the first half of his life dueling buddhist cultivators. He had never seen an immortal cultivator before and froze for a full breath, during which a figure stepped into view, treading on Heavenly Glow.

“Crap!”

The figure flashed before his eyes for only an instant, then his sword vanished from his hand and landed in the other’s. Just as fear struck him, his body was already tightly bound, unable to even activate his escape light.

Li Xizhi examined the dharma artifact he took. It was indeed unbearably crude, forged from blood qi and soul remnants. It emitted a faint bloody glow in his hand but had nothing worth praising.

Li Xizhi rode the Heavenly Glow to the front of the formation, the captured men still bound behind him. Using a command token to activate the formation, he saw an unbelievably small marketplace nestled in the valley. A few figures rode the wind to welcome him.

This marketplace consisted of no more than a few courtyards, it was extremely crude in appearance. The formation looked newly set, likely placed by Azure Pond Sect.

As the group reached him, they all bowed deeply. Li Xizhi examined them. One was at the mid-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, three were early-stage, and the rest were only at the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

How pitiful.

He felt somewhat troubled as these cultivators of Baixiang Valley were so overjoyed they hadn’t slept for days, each of them eagerly addressing him as Peak Master.

The mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm old man seemed to be the overseer of Baixiang Valley. He was moved and emotional, saying, “Peak Master, sir... I’ve long heard that Jiangnan is a flourishing land of immortal cultivation. To come such a long way to aid us... I, Bai, am deeply grateful... Please accept my bow...”

Li Xizhi was momentarily stunned. After asking a few questions, he realized all of them were surnamed Bai, they were the local cultivators of Xu State. Apart from establishing a formation in Baixiang Valley, no other Azure Pond cultivators had arrived yet.

He chuckled and shook his head, letting out a breath of relief and thought, Of course... Baixiang Valley is a crucial defensive point. They wouldn’t leave just a few Qi Cultivation Realm disciples for me... I’ve just grown too wary after being schemed against by the Chi Family...

With the rest yet to arrive, Li Xizhi wasn’t in a rush to interrogate the devil cultivators. He had them clear out some rooms and waited quietly.

Just as the night passed, two escape lights flew in, one ahead and one behind.

First came a white-haired old man, neatly dressed, looking even older than Li Xuanxuan. He was in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and appeared to be about a hundred years old. This meant he was likely over two hundred by cultivator standards.

The old man cupped his hands in greeting. Right after, a middle-aged man with mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, neatly groomed beard, stepped forward and said loudly, “I am Quan Yi of Linghe Peak. Greetings to you both, fellow Daoists.”

The old man followed with a hoarse voice, “Yu Yuwei of Panqi Peak. I have three disciples, they will arrive one by one in the coming days.”

Li Xizhi didn’t know Quan Yi well, but he did recognize the Yu Family and Panqi Peak. He nodded and smiled, “Changtian Peak, Li Xizhi.”

After exchanging names, Li Xizhi pointed to the devil cultivators on the ground and said, “Two seniors, I arrived a bit earlier and happened to run into this group of devil cultivators skulking around. I brought them back on the way.”

Quan Yi gave a small smile and said, “I know a few spell arts that are just right for interrogation.”

He conjured a pale blue flame, pressed it to the captive’s forehead, and began questioning in a low voice. After about five minutes, he said in disappointment, “Just a petty scavenger trying to take advantage of the chaos! They are not from the Tuoba Family.”

As he withdrew and stood up, the man before him slumped to the ground in a daze. The surrounding devil cultivators looked increasingly terrified, but they were still sealed by Heavenly Glow and unable to move.

Li Xizhi, ever thorough, casually picked up the devil cultivator’s storage pouch. After rummaging through it, he found nothing more than some blood qi, tattered clothing, and a few worn-out cultivation manuals.

Inside the clothing was a hidden letter. He opened it in front of the two others but it was nothing more than a family letter with handwriting that were blurred and aged.

Quan Yi turned away in disappointment. The three of them clearly understood where the true threat in this region lay. Yu Yuwei gently shook his head and stroked his beard, saying, “Fellow Daoist... if these were truly spies from the Tuoba Family, they would never leave behind anything incriminating. The Tuoba are extremely skilled in manipulating souls, it’s difficult to detect. Even though Azure Pond Sect’s techniques are excellent, I fear we still fall short of their level.”

These words didn’t give Quan Yi much face, but he didn’t mind. He nodded, seemingly enlightened, and casually slapped the captives to death.

The captives let out a brief gasp of terror before their lives were snuffed out. Only then did he smile and say, “I was too rash. Senior, you’re well-experienced, having served as peak master for many years and coming from an esteemed family, could you explain a bit more about the Tuoba Family?”

Yu Yuwei nodded slightly and said, “The Tuoba Family has a grand background. Though they are now in decline, they were once a first-class great family... Are you aware of how Northern Qi replaced Wei, and then Great Liang destroyed Qi?”

Both nodded. When Yu Yuwei mentioned the rise of Northern Qi over Wei, Quan Yi cast a subtle glance at Li Xizhi. Yu Yuwei continued softly, “Emperor Taiwu of Liang was surnamed Tuoba, with given name Xuantan.”

“So they were once the imperial family of the Northern Dynasties,” muttered Quan Yi as his expression grew increasingly grim, he was clearly shaken by the name. Li Xizhi hadn’t expected the Tuoba background to be this deep either and fell into silent thought. Yu Yuwei continued softly, “Later, the Emperor of Liang perished, and the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch died as well. Great Liang reached its peak and then fell hard.

“With Great Liang’s territory shattered, the Tuoba Family suffered heavy losses. Only by relying on the Shengle Heaven did they recover slowly over the years. Now, they have reestablished themselves in Yan State.”

“They even have a grotto heaven!” Quan Yi looked at the two with a complicated expression, calculating with his fingers before speaking in a low voice, “With the three of us, plus senior’s three disciples, if the Tuoba Family sends just one person, we might be able to fend them off. But if three or five come... resisting would be pointless. Better to face punishment than lose our lives...”

Yu Yuwei laughed heartily and patted him on the shoulder, saying, “Fellow Daoist, you worry too much! So many years have passed... The Tuoba Family is no longer what it once was. Even if they have a few prodigies left, they wouldn’t send them to a place like this...

“If just hearing a surname is enough to shake us, then there are countless more people surnamed Li, Fuqi, Tuoba... than Xie or Wang...”

Quan Yi merely waved his hand and nodded in reply, “What you say is true, Senior... but my heart still feels uneasy.”

His mood never picked up. After a few perfunctory words, he found a side room to rest. With two calls, the family head–looking elder of Baixiang Valley hurriedly offered up his own cave dwelling.

The old man, however, took the opportunity to slowly approach Li Xizhi. Yu Yuwei asked, “Fellow Daoist Xizhi, are you from the Li Family of Moongaze Lake?”

Seeing Li Xizhi nod, Yu Yuwei smiled and said, “What a coincidence.”

Li Xizhi looked slightly puzzled, then saw the old man continue leisurely, “Back in the day... the Yu and Ning Families were quite close. Some from the Ning Family cultivated on Panqi Peak. By seniority, one of them was my martial uncle.

“Later, when the position of Moon Lake Peak master became vacant, my uncle took the seat. While cultivating over the lake, flying by on the wind, he once saw a woman at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She was very beautiful.”

He chuckled and continued, “He was quite the romantic, and quickly fell in love with her. They spent a passionate night, and he couldn’t let her go, so he brought her back to the sect. It was quite the scandal. There were many nights of indulgence and much gossip.

“In the end, the woman’s talent was too poor and she died young. Before her death, she entrusted her family to him. My uncle agreed, but after he died, Moon Lake Peak saw it as a scandal and barely took care of her brother.”

Yu Yuwei looked up, as if reminiscing, and murmured, “I believe his name was... Lu Sisi, wasn’t it? Have you heard of him, Daoist?”

Li Xizhi fell silent and said softly, “I’ve heard the name...”




# Chapter 750: Husband And Wife

Lu Sisi...

Of course Li Xizhi had heard that name, the internal and external family histories both have records of this man. After the elder finished speaking, Li Xizhi silently pondered, Ancient matters from long ago... Why bring them up again? Things with no meaning now... What exactly is Yu Yuwei trying to say...

Yu Yuwei paused for a moment, then steered the conversation back with a smile, saying, “Just idle chatter... Back then, our families were closely allied, and my family was united. Times have changed, we’ve lost contact with the Ning Family. I merely asked when I heard that Moon Lake Peak had fallen into their hands.”

He cupped his hands respectfully, then slowly withdrew, finding a small courtyard to cultivate in.

Li Xizhi listened with a thoughtful expression. He also found a quiet courtyard and sat down peacefully, thinking, Could he be warning me that the Ning Family is untrustworthy... Matters between the two families hinge on uncle. I have a decent grasp of the situation. This kind of reminder, it’s his way of extending a subtle courtesy.

Thinking it through, with the deaths of Li Tongya and Li Yuanjiao, ties between the Li and Xiao Families had grown distant. As long as the Li Family faithfully guarded the west for them, there was little interaction. The Xiao Family had since sealed their mountain and grown ever more reclusive.

They were once close with the Yuan Family, but that too grew distant and eventually broke off. The Li Family then gravitated toward the Ning and Yang Families, their political alignment had shifted over the course of a century, no more.

Such is the way of the world... closeness and distance eventually turn to separation. If I hadn’t personally handled the Qingsui Peak affair, we might have broken with the Yuan Family outright.

Love and enmity fade in an instant. Human sentiment is hollow, like standing atop a needle’s point.

A faint gloom rose in his heart as he reflected, The Ning Family has long been loyal to the Chi Family. For hundreds of years, they likely had relations with families like mine and the Yu Family. Yet now, all that has vanished? Would the Chi Family simply sit by? Their deep resentment toward the Li Family... it probably ties back to this.

With Yuan Su's death, the Ning Family has grown weaker, and now they’re being pushed into conflict with my family... It’s not a good look. Things are still manageable for now, but if the situation becomes urgent... something is bound to happen.

The stars and moon had risen in the sky. Li Xizhi sat upright in the courtyard, dust thick on the windowsill. His eyes shone like stars, and one hand rested on the stone table as he murmured inwardly, “It all hinges on uncle. Ning Heyuan is two-faced, and Ning Hejing is a trusted agent of the Chi Family. When there’s no harmony in interests and no depth in sentiment, how can anything last?”

———

Xu State, Mount Yan Pass.

Traveling north from Moongaze Lake into Xu State and crossing the Great River, one would reach Mount Yan Pass. This place was already close to the Golden Tang Gate. Looking up, one could faintly glimpse golden light atop the distant peaks.

Of course, the Golden Tang Gate was now tightly sealed, nothing remained but Mount Golden Tang itself. Li Qinghong flew out of the pass on a bolt of thunder-light, seeing only endless golden light, while roiling devil smoke surged from the distant horizon.

Directly across from Mount Yan Pass were the forces of the Dao of Great Desire and various devil cultivators. The land before the pass was vast, with a long defensive line. For months now, the devil cultivators had been growing restless, this was one of the most fiercely contested fronts in all of Azure Pond Sect’s defenses.

She had been stationed here for several months, and the probing skirmishes were growing increasingly frequent. Kongheng and Li Wushao had been reassigned elsewhere and were no longer at her side.

Among the cultivators under Li Qinghong’s command, only Li Minggong and Chen Mufeng were from her own household. An old acquaintance was also present, Fei Tongyu of the Fei Family, who, despite being the family head, had been dispatched here and now stood quietly in a corner. The rest were a mix of cultivators from various families.

This arrangement had only one purpose, to prevent cowardice or inaction in the face of danger. The great families had been deliberately mixed across the defensive lines, forcing every segment to support one another without bias.

Li Qinghong closely observed the devil smoke to the north, it was far more massive than previous scouting waves. She took out the jade ring issued to her and saw it glowing entirely red, with only a few dim white spots.

“Take your positions in the formation. Prepare to engage!” She gave a command and pulled a spear from her storage pouch. The other cultivators hurried into formation. As she focused her gaze, a dozen figures emerged from the black smoke.

The Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivators were of no concern. Her attention was fixed on the pair leading them. The pair was husband and wife, both at Foundation Establishment Realm. The woman was gentle and charming, her aura clearly at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. She held a delicate brocade fan. The man appeared cold and aloof, wielding a blade and possessing slightly stronger cultivation. He was likely at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The couple led their devils to the formation’s edge. The woman flicked her snow-white robe and said with a smile, “Daoist ahead... may I ask which branch of Azure Pond Sect you hail from?”

Li Qinghong stared at them coldly without replying. The couple’s subordinates weren’t idle, they cast spell arts at the formation. Soon, black-clad figures emerged at their feet, devil cultivators of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, who took quite some time to reach the frontline.

Though outnumbered, the defenders within the formation counterattacked under its protection. Thunderous blasts erupted. The devil cultivator couple noticed no response from Foundation Establishment Realm defenders and thought to themselves, Could it be that no Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are currently inside the formation...

They immediately launched their dharma artifacts. Li Qinghong couldn’t allow them to attack unchecked, so she rose into the air and flew out from the formation.

When the devil woman saw her appearance, her eyes lit up, and she withdrew her artifact, calling out, “Daoist! Daoist, please wait!”

Li Qinghong flew using only mana, not revealing her foundation or true cultivation. She replied coldly, “Who’s your fellow Daoist!”

The man simply stared at her coldly, while the gentle devil woman laughed lightly and spoke, “In the end, we’re all comrades of the devil Dao... Though our Dao lineages differ, the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Daos once belonged to devil cultivators as well... Why can’t we address each other as Daoists?”

Li Qinghong angled her spear, thunder gathering silently within its shaft. She gave no reply. The woman quickly spoke, “Daoist... you and I are both merely pawns. Why escalate things? Just send out half the cultivators in your formation, and I’ll allow you to kill half my little devils. We’ll report accordingly, and call it even...”

Li Qinghong didn’t believe a word. She merely laughed coldly, “Send them out? You wish!”

The gentle woman wasn’t surprised. She exchanged a glance with her husband and said helplessly, “Daoist, how heartless! Why must things always come to violence...”

Li Qinghong smiled brightly and replied, “The ones in my formation are my kin and comrades. I can’t trade them like that. But how about I offer a spirit item in exchange for one of your devil heads?”

“Oh?” The gentle woman and her husband exchanged a glance, thinking to themselves, Even if we can’t lure her into weakening the formation, there’s no harm in at least seeing the treasure...

So Liu Qiao smiled and said, “Wonderful! Please, Daoist, let us see it... I am Liu Qiao, and this is my husband, Helian Changguang. May we ask your name?”

Li Qinghong had no intention of giving her name. She didn’t believe the devil cultivators’ introductions anyway.

She simply pulled out a small point of white light and said softly, “Take a look, Daoist!”

The white light spun once in the air, then shot directly at the couple’s faces. Liu Qiao's expression shifted, but Helian Changguang seemed prepared. He flicked his sleeve and released a black cloud that wrapped tightly around them both.

The flickering white light stopped in midair, hovering brilliantly. Li Qinghong frowned and asked, “What’s the meaning of this?”

Liu Qiao hesitated for a moment and moved her wrist as if to explain, but Helian Changguang seized her wrist tightly, his face stern, and pulled her backward.

He growled, “You may have fooled her, but not me.”

Before his words had even faded, the white light burst forth, expanding in the blink of an eye. Concentrated lightning exploded outward, shifting from pure white to violet-white, then splintered into a torrential rain of lightning that lit up the sky with vibrant hues.

Boom!

Even the devil cultivators on the ground below were stunned and breathless. They had no choice but to raise their dharma artifacts in defense as the lightning rain poured down. The cultivators within the formation seized the opportunity and unleashed a barrage of spells.

Morale surged among the defenders. Li Qinghong also seized the moment. She drew her spear, and bolts of lightning formed avian shapes that flew into the crackling glow.

Another thunderous boom resounded as Helian Changguang burst from the lightning. Black qi rose around him, while his face was cold and scorched with soot.

He raised his blade to block the lightning and shouted, “Thunder cultivator!”

Liu Qiao had fared worse. Her robe was charred black, and blood was trickling from her mouth.

She waved her brocade fan, stirring up a gust of dark wind, and said in a low voice, “Damn you... you wretched thing! Once I break your formation, I’ll turn every one of your kin into blood food!”

Li Qinghong’s almond-shaped eyes widened slightly. She said nothing, but silently committed the words to memory. Though the devil pair had suffered heavily from the exchange, they didn’t retreat. They charged her together with black smoke billowing.

Liu Qiao thought to herself, That power must’ve come from a talisman technique... Yet this woman doesn’t understand the art of timing, she should have used it when exhausted to turn the tide. Wasting it early... how fortunate for us.

Helian Changguang was far more cautious. He secretly used mana to transmit a voice message, “Qiao’er, could this woman be a direct descendent of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? And a thunder cultivator at that... we should be careful!”

Liu Qiao dismissed the concern and replied, “How could she be a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm without even a feathered robe? Besides, where in the mainland is there a great thunder cultivation family? She may be strong, but she must be carrying treasures.”

The two attacked Li Qinghong in tandem as they conversed. Her spear flickered with violet lightning, dispersing the black smoke with ease. After exchanging a few moves, she had already gauged them in her heart, Helian Changguang is quite powerful, while Liu Qiao is weak and unfocused. They are clearly not on the same level. Helian could match an esteemed descendant, but Liu Qiao feels like a mere Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivator.

Her thunder spear danced through the air with practiced ease, blocking their attacks completely. Every now and then, she’d suddenly thrust, forcing Liu Qiao into narrow escapes and cold sweats.

Frowning, Helian Changguang took out a skull-shaped artifact and tossed it into the air. Gray-red smoke billowed out, and beams of light shot from the skull’s hollow eyes, enveloping the couple.

Still feeling it wasn’t enough, he retrieved a red agate from his storage pouch and suspended it at his side. It emitted beams of crimson light aimed at Li Qinghong’s eyes.

What a deep arsenal.

Li Qinghong’s eyes narrowed. Her family also practiced perception techniques. It was nothing too advanced, but decent enough to resist the glare without being heavily affected. Still, she could no longer strike at will, and her mind quickly calculated the shift in balance.

The brocade fan and robe on the female cultivator were Foundation Establishment Realm items. It was nothing outstanding, but still respectable. They clearly didn’t match her strength. They were likely gifts from her Dao companion.

Meanwhile, Helian had consecutively taken out two Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts. Though not top-grade, they were clearly sufficient to reveal his identity. He was most likely a direct descendant of some devil family.

Devil cultivators found it easier to forge dharma artifacts compared to immortal sects, albeit they were lesser in quality. Even so, these two Foundation Establishment dharma artifacts were already tipping the fight. One restricted Li Qinghong, while the other protected Helian. They were slowly gaining the upper hand.

After dozens of exchanges, Helian noticed Li Qinghong hadn’t taken out any artifacts or talismans. He breathed easier, and assumed he had been overthinking it. His expression turned increasingly vicious.

He pulled out a blood-colored glow from his pouch and said coldly, “You offered me a bolt of thunder, Daoist. Let me return the favor!”

He flicked his finger, and the blood light fluttered twice in the air, expanding and unfolding as it descended like a fog. Blood dust was now raining down from the sky.

The protective thunderlight around Li Qinghong was soon stained by the blood glow. Her movements grew heavy and her spear slower. She had no choice but to step back and shift from offense to defense.

Boom!

A muffled thunderclap rumbled through the clouds as violet light burst from Li Qinghong's eyes. Her Immortal Foundation, Profound Thunderpool, surged to its peak. It unleashed a blast of explosive lightning that forced the couple to stumble back a step.

Her cheeks were flushed slightly, but she pressed on. Each strike of her spear sent violet arcs of lightning outward. She fought through the suppressive blood light, and her momentum became even fiercer than before.

Helian Changguang parried several strikes before snorting coldly. The red agate that had been floating in the air descended and burrowed into his chest, instantly erupting with blinding black light.

He charged at Li Qinghong, blade in hand, engaging her in the sky that echoed with thunderous bursts. Liu Qiao couldn’t find a chance to interfere; she could only distance herself and send black smoke from her brocade fan to harass Li Qinghong from afar.

“Good...”

Helian's mastery of blade arts was average, but his mana was immense, and his cultivation method top-grade. His technique was solid, and he fought Li Qinghong on even ground for a while. After another few dozen exchanges, he seized a moment amid the black smoke and struck viciously.

But Li Qinghong found her rhythm as she fought. Her inner thunder surged like a stormy sea. Her spear strikes grew more violent and forceful. Not only did she break through his attack with ease, she reversed her weapon and stabbed diagonally with explosive force.

Helian had to expend nearly double his mana reserves just to block the blow. Something felt off; her spearwork was only growing more aggressive and lethal. Not only did her lightning suppress his devil magic, it completely shattered his blood qi techniques, rendering them useless.

Did she take some kind of pill...

He gritted his teeth. Though he hadn't seen her take any pill, devil cultivators knew many tricks. They even stored medicine within their flesh, ready to be absorbed in moments of crisis. It wouldn’t be strange. So he held his ground, weathering her assault.

Li Qinghong’s advantage grew more pronounced as she flung out two violent arcs of thunder. Liu Qiao hurried to block them with black smoke, but in that instant, Li Qinghong’s spear reversed mid-flight, bursting with purple lightning as it lunged directly for Liu Qiao’s face.

“Ah!”

Panic surged through Liu Qiao as she rapidly retreated. But the stored lightning had been waiting, and her defensive smoke was instantly blown away. The searing thunderlight stabbed at her eyes as she desperately retrieved a talisman.
