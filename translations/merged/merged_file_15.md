# Chapter 749: Selecting the Market Site

Dantai Jin was a direct descendant of the Purple Mansion lineage. With the Si family's own numbers dwindling, and to diminish the appearance of a hostile takeover, Si Yuanli had appointed Dantai Jin to manage the sect's affairs while he was in seclusion. Though it was framed as a merit-based selection, Dantai Jin was, for all intents and purposes, a Si clansman.

Li Xizhi guided him to a seat. Dantai Jin accepted the offered tea, took a sip, and savored it for a moment before smiling.

"Excellent tea."

Now that he was the brother of a Purple Mansion Daoist Master, Li Xizhi had the standing to sit and share tea with a direct descendant like Dantai Jin. Si Tongyi, despite his lesser cultivation, was the most promising of the Si family's younger generation and could have rightfully joined them. However, ever one to humble himself, he stood respectfully to the side in the posture of a junior.

After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Li Xizhi inquired, "Your Excellency has graced my Heaven-Probing Pavilion with your immortal presence. What instructions do you have for me?"

Dantai Jin quickly waved his hand, shaking his head. "I wouldn't dare say 'instructions'. I merely have a small matter or two to trouble you with, Pavilion Lord."

He set down his teacup, his expression turning serious. "The Si family has a talented young man who has just begun Qi Refining. His aptitude is remarkable, and his understanding of spiritual arts far surpasses his peers. Tongyi has observed him closely and fears that our own tutelage might tarnish this uncut jade. Thus, we were hoping he might be accepted as your disciple… If you would not be opposed, Xizhi, I ask that you meet him."

The moment Dantai Jin finished speaking, Si Tongyi stepped forward and presented a wooden box with both hands. "Pavilion Lord, your mastery of spiritual arts is divine," he said. "Our family would not dare ask for your Dao lineage lightly. This is a copy of the Heavenly Glow Dao lineage's 'Five-Colored Sinking Sword Art', a fourth-grade ancient spell that a Daoist Master of our family acquired in the north many years ago. For a century, none have been able to master it. Only the Pavilion Lord is worthy of such a technique."

Si Tongyi's declaration—'Pavilion Lord, your mastery of spiritual arts is divine, our family would not dare ask for your Dao lineage lightly'—left Li Wushao, who was standing nearby, momentarily stunned. He almost missed the words that followed, marveling inwardly.

'Damn, a direct descendant of the Si family… It's amazing how polite they are when a Purple Mansion Daoist Master is involved.'

Li Xizhi, however, found the situation slightly surreal.

'They're actually coming to me, asking to join my sect.'

He had to admit, the "Five-Colored Sinking Sword Art" was incredibly tempting. It wasn't just a sword technique but a true spiritual art, one deeply intertwined with one's sword-related cultivation. The Li family possessed a similar text, the "Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts," which was even more purely focused on its spiritual art aspects.

Li Xizhi had been searching for such an art for a long time. His own "Rainbow Pierce Skyway" could directly enhance his proficiency with spiritual arts, and his innate talent for the sword was not weak. In his hands, this art could produce truly extraordinary results.

But no matter how tempted he was, he showed no eagerness on his face. Accepting this disciple would undoubtedly strengthen his ties to the Si family, and he was unsure of his brother's stance on the matter. He couldn't agree immediately.

"You are too kind, Tongyi," he replied. "But the matter of accepting a disciple hinges on the affinity between master and student. I cannot risk hindering your clan's prodigy! This isn't something to be settled with a simple nod. We must choose an auspicious day for me to meet and test him…"

Hearing this, Dantai Jin nodded in understanding. He knew Li Xizhi needed to consult Li Ximing first. "What does the Pavilion Lord propose?" he asked.

"Send the boy over first," Li Xizhi answered. "Let me see if we have an affinity. I will select two Daoist texts and test him a little. We shall see if fate wills it."

Both men understood perfectly well what "fate" implied. Having settled the matter, they moved on.

"With the death of Senior Changxi, the Profound Peak region has descended into chaos," Dantai Jin said. "Shanji Prefecture is now beset by enemies on all sides, and the number of demonic cultivators has risen sharply. I hear the heirs of the Profound Peak Gate have gone into the wilderness, leaving the riverside territories without protection. Demonic cultivators from the Eastern Sea can now slip in."

"If Shanji Prefecture falls into disarray, these demonic cultivators and beasts might try to pass through our Azure Pond Sect's territory. We plan to bolster our defenses and will likely send a contingent of disciples there. If any of your own disciples are seeking experience, Xizhi, they are welcome to join them."

Li Xizhi casually agreed. With his business concluded, Dantai Jin finished his tea, and he and Si Tongyi made a motion to depart. A thought suddenly occurred to Li Xizhi, and he asked, "May I know the name, age, and cultivated arts of your clan's young disciple?"

"Ah, how could I forget!" Si Tongyi said with a serious expression. "The boy is of the 'Xun' generation and was given the name 'Hui'. He is just eighteen and cultivates the 'Empty Response Dispersion', an immortal foundation that excels in the practice of spiritual arts. Once he reaches Foundation Establishment, his prowess will soar to new heights."

Li Xizhi nodded thoughtfully and had Li Wushao escort them out. Though the old serpent was of humble bloodline, his status was now considerable. As a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, he commanded respect from everyone, and even Si Tongyi greeted him with a polite smile.

Once outside the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, Dantai Jin sighed. "Tongyi, it seems Li Xizhi wasn't overly moved. We'll have to wait for Daoist Master Zhaojing's reply."

Si Tongyi nodded silently, his expression complex. The dynamic was a far cry from the days when he and Li Xizhi could casually call each other brothers. "Years ago, when Yuan Tuan visited Moongaze Lake, I had just begun my cultivation at the peak," he reminisced. "I heard the entire Li clan came out to welcome her, and Li Xizhi was a nobody. Back then… even Yuan Tuan had to greet me with a smile."

"Now, with Zhaojing's ascension, I have to be polite to even the most junior members of the Li family… like that Li Jiangqian. It's truly unpredictable…"

Dantai Jin simply shook his head. "Such is the way of the world. Forget Yuan Tuan, how mighty was the Yuan Clan in its day? The great Yanyang Dao Lineage… look what has become of it. Today, Yuan Chengzhao has to live at our beck and call. Do you think he doesn't feel wronged? But what good does it do?"

The two men fell silent and flew away on the wind. "Our Daoist Master had some designs on that part of Shanji Prefecture," Dantai Jin said regretfully. "But Changxi died too suddenly, catching many Daoist Masters off guard. Daoist Master Yehui was the one who reaped the benefits. As it stands now, that land will likely be carved up by the neighboring powers."

***

Moongaze Lake.

The small hall on the island was brightly decorated, with numerous plum trees planted in the courtyard. The season was not yet right, so their bare branches reached up like lonely fingers, while cultivators bustled about.

A cultivator in a crimson robe strode down from the main hall. He had a powerful build, with a bristling beard and a sharp jaw, and his eyes were particularly captivating. Merely standing there, he possessed a presence that was hard to look away from.

Ding Weizeng's injuries had almost fully healed. He was a figure the Daoist Master had personally mentioned, and he had been given a "Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill." This pill had the ability to help transcend tribulations, which was wonderfully synergistic with Ding Weizeng's "Palace-Yang Tiger" immortal foundation, known for its ability to overcome Yin tribulations. The effects of the pill had been maximized.

As a result, while many others still bore injuries from the battle—even Li Chenghui, who had preserved most of his strength, still needed time to recuperate—Ding Weizeng, who had been among the most grievously wounded, had left the mountain early, having recovered seventy to eighty percent of his power.

Now, as he sat in the hall, a servant reported, "My lord, Wang Quwan of Funan has come to call."

Ding Weizeng was not surprised. He took his seat at the head of the hall and said, "Show him in."

A moment later, a man with his hair tied back and a sword on his back entered the hall. He bowed respectfully. "This junior, Wang Quwan of the Wang Clan of Funan, pays his respects to you, my lord."

As newcomers to the Li family, the cultivators from the Jiangbei region naturally stuck together. The Funan faction was larger, mostly composed of men who had been trained under Qu Bushi, and they proudly identified with their Funan origins.

The other group consisted of cultivators from Midong—primarily surrendered generals and members of Midong's noble families who had been conscripted into the Milin army. They were led by Miaoshui. They were few in number and their cultivation was not high. Miaoshui had a good relationship with Qu Bushi, so this group often gathered around the Funan cultivators under the broader Jiangbei banner, though they were still considered a step below.

Wang Quwan's Wang Clan was a Jiangbei clan, but technically from Midong. Fortunately, they had relocated to Funan years ago. Ever the opportunist, Wang Quwan had emerged from Gardenia Scenery Mountain a few months prior and immediately began referring to his family as the Wang Clan *of Funan*. He had paid his respects to Qu Bushi first, and Ding Weizeng was his second visit.

Ding Weizeng was fiercely loyal and paid no mind to factions. Yet, his current standing made him the tacitly acknowledged leader of both Jiangbei groups. It was, therefore, no surprise that Wang Quwan had come to see him.

While Wang Quwan had come to be shrewd, Ding Weizeng had already been wanting to meet him.

The reason was simple: the person to whom Ding Weizeng had pledged his life and loyalty was Li Ximing. Wang Quwan had earned Li Ximing's favor, to the point where it was rumored an Essence Gathering Pill was being set aside for him. This naturally gave Ding Weizeng a very positive impression of the man.

"Quwan, there's no need for such formality," Ding Weizeng said. "Have your resources and living quarters been arranged?"

Wang Quwan quickly explained the arrangements. Ding Weizeng listened, noting that he had been given the clan's highest level of treatment. He nodded silently, his belief that Wang Quwan was highly favored now confirmed.

"Has Senior Qu explained the clan's internal affairs to you? Do you understand everything?" he asked.

The old guard from the Lijing clans was in a clear decline. The once-dominant Huayu faction had fallen silent with An Siwei's capture. Meanwhile, the Milin and Nanzhang factions were growing in power. This left the newly arrived Jiangbei faction in a somewhat awkward position, where a misstep could easily cause offense.

Even if Qu Bushi hadn't explained these things, Wang Quwan would have figured them out after a few days of observation. But having it spelled out was better. "Yes, my lord," he said. "I understand completely."

Ding Weizeng nodded but still offered a word of caution. "Though the old ministers of the Lijing clans are not as prominent now, you must still show them respect. As for the matter between the Fei family and the Funan cultivators, you need not get involved. Just focus on your cultivation."

Wang Quwan knew what he was referring to. The Fei family of the North Bank had a bloody history with Funan from the past decade. Many of the Funan cultivators were from smaller North Bank families that had fled to Floating Cloud Cave. Though they now served the same master, the bad blood remained.

But his Wang family was from Midong and had never been part of that conflict, leaving him cleanly detached. After Ding Weizeng's admonition, Wang Quwan replied, "The Young Master and the Patriarch have instructed me not to leave the island until I reach Foundation Establishment."

Ding Weizeng understood immediately.

'Wang Quwan is important for the morale of the Funan people. They're afraid the northerners will harm him!'

Li Jiangqian was indeed afraid that the Capital immortals Dao would harm Wang Quwan. After all, he was the only one currently available who could be of use regarding the Xiaoshi Mountain affair. If he were killed, there was no telling how long they would have to wait for another opportunity. Though they had arrived at the same conclusion for different reasons, it seemed perfectly logical to both of them.

They spoke for a while, and Ding Weizeng found himself nodding repeatedly. From the island's interior to its shores, Wang Quwan had already managed everything with a thoroughness that surpassed even what Ding Weizeng himself had considered.

Pleased with the conversation, Ding Weizeng rose to his feet and, ignoring the other's protests, personally escorted Wang Quwan out. "With a patriarch like you, the Wang Clan of Funan has truly received a heaven-sent blessing!" he laughed.

"I am merely fortunate to have earned the Daoist Master's favor!"

As they reached the entrance of the hall, they were surprised to see a young man in a dark red, pleated robe waiting on the steps. Ding Weizeng paused for a second before bowing.

"Greetings, Young Master!"

Li Jiangqian smiled and approached, giving Wang Quwan a polite nod. The man tactfully excused himself and departed. Ding Weizeng quickly invited Li Jiangqian inside, but the young man didn't state his purpose. Instead, he smiled.

"Lord Ding, what is your assessment of Wang Quwan?"

Ding Weizeng's expression turned serious. "That man," he said in a low voice, "is no small fish in a pond."

"Oh?" Li Jiangqian prompted.

"Though he is not young, his cultivation is stable and profound, and his spiritual qi is pure," Ding Weizeng continued. "His clothes are simple, his posture steady. The tassel on his sword is worn, and his palms are calloused from forming hand seals. The ambition of a clear conscience shines between his brows, yet he bows his head without losing his dignity. If he proves decisive in his actions, knowing when to advance and when to retreat, he will surely rise above his peers the moment opportunity strikes."

Li Jiangqian pondered this for a moment. "You think very highly of him, my lord."

On the surface, he looked surprised, but inwardly he had already made his judgment.

'Opportunity? The Xiaoshi Mountain Dao lineage is a guaranteed opportunity. Can it be that destiny is truly at play? I should bind him with resources, treasures, and the favor of the clan's women…'

But as the thought formed, Li Jiangqian was suddenly struck by a realization.

'But how do I know that this very idea to lavish him with favor… isn't just the good fortune brought about by his destiny? Is it fate that shapes a man, or a man who forges his fate?'

He considered this for only a fleeting moment, but it was enough to cement Wang Quwan's importance in his mind. A smile returned to his face as he spoke.

"I came today because there is a matter I must trouble you with, my lord."

"Please give your orders, Young Master!" Ding Weizeng said, bowing his head.

Li Jiangqian's expression became serious. "I was previously ordered by the Daoist Master to construct a pavilion, a Jade Court, and a market. The Jade Court is complete, and the pavilion is nearly so, but the market has yet to be sited."

"The Daoist Master returned for a short while at midnight. I made a special trip to Gardenia Scenery Mountain to ask him about it. He has chosen a location: a place within the old territory of Milin Prefecture, situated between the Milin Mountains and the East Bank. It lies at the confluence of five earth meridians, an ideal spot to establish the market."

"However, the site needs a Foundation Establishment cultivator to oversee it. I have consulted the elders, and at present, only you are available, my lord. I would like you to go there to assume command, coordinate the manpower, and see this market built."

Ding Weizeng immediately bowed. "I will obey the revered Daoist Master's command!"

Li Jiangqian drew several jade slips and a token from his sleeve and handed them to him. "The earth meridians in that area are damaged," he explained. "They have repaired themselves somewhat over the years, but several flaws remain that must be fixed. Take my token and have the disciples from the Profound Peak Gate see to the repairs."

Damaged earth meridians were a relatively rare problem, and few spiritual arts or Daoist texts recorded methods of repair. Most simply waited for time to heal the wounds. Fortunately, the members of the Profound Peak Gate, who excelled at such matters, were now with the Li family. Ding Weizeng looked slightly confused, so Li Jiangqian elaborated.

"That location was once the site of the Yu family's market. The Yu clan had a good eye; it's the best spot for a market on that entire stretch of the East Bank. During the wars between the great families, the market was destroyed, and the shattering of a Jade True formation damaged the earth meridians, creating the trouble we face today."

He gave a calm smile and added, "I will arrange the necessary manpower for you, my lord, and the formation masters I've hired will arrive on schedule. But once you are on the East Bank, all the cultivators around those five peaks will be under your command. Don't hesitate to go to my younger brother. Tell him it is the Daoist Master's order and show him my token. He will not refuse you."

Ding Weizeng bowed deeply. "This subordinate obeys!"



# Chapter 750: A Teacup's Worth of Mountains

At the Xuanmiao Temple, a fine spring rain fell, a gentle, drifting drizzle. Inside the temple, several disciples were busy with their cultivation, their forms like gliding fish as they wove through the downpour, riding streaks of light. In their hands, pale green radiance continuously gathered, coalescing into wisps of flowing energy.

A middle-aged Abbot with a slightly square face and simple clothes walked along the stone steps, his robes hitched up, wooden clogs clattering. His movements were like those of an ordinary person with no cultivation. Upon reaching the front of the courtyard, he pushed the door open and smiled, "Please, come in, Zhaojing!"

A Daoist Master in white robes with gold patterns entered through the doorway. He had a proper, dignified appearance and looked quite young. His eyes held no ferocity, yet his calm gaze was enough to make the disciples on either side lower their heads. Li Ximing followed him past the steps and replied, "This spring rain is a rare sight. I see your temple's disciples are all busy gathering qi. It seems they look forward to this day every year. No wonder I haven't seen Qiuxin."

Sumian merely smiled as he welcomed him, "Qiuxin left a while ago. The matters in the Eastern Sea are truly troublesome, and he must be there to oversee them. As for the spring rain, we gather it every year, but it's never enough. Sometimes, I even have to use my Divine Ability to refine it myself."

He let out a laugh and continued, "Your clan has quite a few cultivators. If you're willing, could you have them help me collect some from the lake as well?"

'That old man is a miser, plucking feathers from every passing goose.' Li Ximing chuckled, "Of course. As long as I can take a look at your Qi-Gathering Art, my clan's cultivators can gather the qi and come to your temple to trade for some spiritual items."

"I'll send it to your clan shortly." Sumian's confidence was unshakeable, not in the least bit concerned about the Qi-Gathering Art being leaked. Li Ximing, however, was not intimidated. The Li clan was short on many things, but cultivators were not one of them. Many had time on their hands, and a small side business would be a good thing.

After speaking, Li Ximing sighed inwardly and said again, "It's only been a few days, and a formation has already been built on the late Senior Changxi's mountain! That old Daoist Master certainly works fast... It seems this spirit mountain is quite useful!"

Sumian smiled without a word. When they reached the courtyard, they saw a woman in a yellow satin robe, her eyes marked with a touch of blue at the corners. It was Daoist Master Tinglan of the Purple Smoke Gate. Li Ximing wasn't surprised. He greeted her and took a seat directly.

Li Ximing had received a message from Sumian earlier, saying they needed to discuss the matter of the Profound Peak Gate. He knew for sure that Sumian would not be the only one at the Xuanmiao Temple. At least one of Tinglan or Lingmei would be there, and perhaps Yehui himself.

Picking up his cup, Li Ximing did not beat around the bush. "Fellow Daoist Sumian, what's your proposal?"

Sumian nodded with a smile and replied, "This matter should have been dealt with a long time ago. We delayed it for a few months to save some face for Profound Peak. Now that Tinglan has come to visit and brought it up with me, I've invited you over."

Li Ximing smiled, "Has Fellow Daoist Yehui already been here?"

Sumian hesitated slightly, but Tinglan took over the conversation. "He came once, clarified his conditions, and then we invited you."

She looked at him more intently and said in a gentle voice, "Enemies are better resolved than created. We are all Purple Mansion cultivators. It's only natural for the cultivators below us to stir up trouble and for you to take notice, to have some thoughts of your own. It's just a matter of preserving your honor. There's no need to truly become enemies... We can play a game of chess, but we don't have to get truly angry."

Regardless of whether the Li clan and Capital immortals Dao were truly enemies, Tinglan was helping to resolve the matter for her own sake. It was likely she had orchestrated the entire thing. Li Ximing, of course, understood her good intentions. He still had to show respect to this Daoist Master of the Purple Smoke Gate. He straightened his expression and said, "Fellow Daoist Tinglan is absolutely right. Senior Yehui and I have clashed once or twice, and we've played a round of chess in Jiangnan and Jiangbei, but it hasn't escalated to true enmity. This matter should be simple to resolve."

Sumian's influence was clearly not as great as Tinglan's, but the old Daoist Master didn't care in the slightest. As long as he could persuade these two who were constantly clashing and prevent himself from being dragged into it, it would be a success for him. The old Daoist Master asked, "I heard you went to investigate. Did you find anything?"

Li Ximing nodded. "I asked another Daoist Master to divine the matter. The guest elder in the sect was Fu En, and the one who died earlier was Kong Haiying. The soul lamp had been tampered with by Daoist Master Changxi and was no longer his. As for Kong Tingyun... I don't know where she is making her breakthrough."

Hearing that he had consulted a Daoist Master for a divination, Sumian couldn't help but take a sip of his tea. Tinglan, however, smiled, "Then it's simple. I have a friend who cultivates near the World's Navel. Her name is Zhugong, and she's been thinking about moving into this place. With that, the matter can be settled."

Sumian raised an eyebrow and asked, "Tinglan, if your friend takes this place, isn't she afraid that if Kong Tingyun successfully makes a breakthrough, she will come seeking revenge?"

"Just listen to me," Tinglan said, blinking. This Daoist Master, who hailed from the Qi region, had a beauty that was different from the poised elegance of Jiangnan. She smiled, "I will make it clear to Yehui that Zhaojing is willing to give up Profound Peak and allow him to enter the sect's gate to search on his own. But after he's searched and plundered, and moved any mountains he wishes to, the sect's gate must be returned to me."

"Then, when Yehui brings his people to attack the mountain, Zhaojing can resist a few times, dismantle the Hundred Mountains Concealed Storage Spirit Array, feign defeat, retreat, and hand over the sect gate to him. After leaving some spiritual items behind, Yehui will finish collecting and searching, and I'll have my friend come to seize the mountain and get Yehui to give it up."

She held out her hand and pressed down on each finger one by one. "For you, Moongaze, wouldn't gaining the formation, the Profound Peak Dao lineage, and the support of the people be better than guarding that one piece of land and inviting the covetousness and jealousy of all those around you? Even if, by some miraculous chance, someone successfully makes a breakthrough, Zhaojing's actions would be completely justified... He'd even gain a debt of gratitude!"

"As for Capital immortals, they'll have plundered the spiritual items and cultivation arts, moved the mountains they wanted, and resolved a deeply-rooted enmity. While they won't get Shanji and Profound Peak, it's enough to save their face! As for where Kong Tingyun might be, that's his problem. Having gone to this extent, is he still afraid of offending Profound Peak?"

She took a slow sip of her tea, her expression serious. "And for Yehui... What's good about Profound Peak is the cluster of spiritual lands within the sect, not its geographical location. If he were to truly devour this place, controlling such a vast territory across a river, he would be stretched too thin. Besides, being so high-profile isn't necessarily a good thing."

"As for Daoist Master Zhugong, she will have righteously gained this mountain from an enemy. She won't have to bear the resentment of Profound Peak, and she can even show favor by accepting and heavily promoting the Profound Peak cultivators... Once she establishes a relationship of gratitude and kinship, even if someone truly makes a breakthrough and returns, what could they say? It might even turn an enemy into a friend!"

"And for me and Old Daoist Master Qi... we won't have to worry about your affairs anymore."

She finished her explanation just as she finished her cup of tea and the game of chess on the board. Each Purple Mansion cultivator had received their share of the spoils. The courtyard fell silent for a moment. Sumian was a little dazed by what he heard. He sighed, "I have long heard that the orthodox path is skilled at chess, and that Purple Mansion cultivators can avoid danger and profit in the invisible... This is truly the case! This grand scheme of yours, Daoist Master, has left this old man in awe!"

While Sumian was showering her with flattery, Tinglan shook her head, a complex look of lingering fear in her eyes. She smiled, "Old Daoist Master, you are too kind. I have only watched a few of the Purple Mansion games over the past few years. It's nothing compared to the methods of Chuting and Qiushui, or Yuanxiu and Changxiao... It's just a few minor tricks compared to even Tian'an and Chi Wei's schemes!"



# Chapter 751: A Commission

After Tinglan and Sumian had spoken, Li Ximing fell silent for a moment. It was clear that neither of them cared whether Fu En or Kong Haiying occupied the mountain; all that mattered was that events proceeded according to their plan. The Profound Peak Gate’s fate was sealed.

‘Tinglan sees things clearly,’ Li Ximing mused. ‘The Purple Smoke Gate is in a period of weakness. Simply seizing the Profound Peak Gate’s territory would be an overextension. Drawing in a friendly Purple Mansion cultivator is the best possible move, and it aligns perfectly with her long-term ambitions.’

Tinglan was all smiles. The Purple Smoke Gate had merely stepped in to mediate, and with just a few words, they had secured the Profound Peak Gate’s mountain for their ally. And Li Ximing was expected to thank her for it.

He understood the situation perfectly. When a Daoist Master from the Purple Smoke Gate personally came to offer a "suggestion," how much room did he truly have to refuse?

Tinglan was a Daoist Master of the Green Pine Temple's Dao lineage. By personally mediating this conflict, she was extending him a significant amount of courtesy, even if it was a calculated move. Sumian, meanwhile, did little more than chime in with praise and nods of agreement, his flattery almost shameless. His stance was blindingly obvious.

Setting the Li family’s interests aside, the Purple Smoke Gate was determined to support Daoist Master Zhu Gong. If Li Ximing raised any objections, he would not only offend Tinglan but also stand in the way of her sect. The Xuanmiao Temple, which sought a peaceful resolution, would be displeased, and Yehui would be laughing all the way.

‘There aren’t many spiritual resources left in the Profound Peak Gate anyway. It’s a vague matter of how much my family gets versus how much Yehui gets. And with Kong Haiying absent, Yehui is the one who truly loses out in this deal. He probably only agreed under pressure…’

Tinglan had dismissed the Capital immortals Dao with a single, cutting remark: ‘We’ve already given him enough face!’ She clearly held them in low regard.

‘My family holds the reputation of a righteous clan in Jiangnan. With the Xiao family watching from the side and the Azure Pond Sect as a potential retreat, Tinglan has to show me some respect. But Yehui… even with his higher cultivation, he likely has very little say in the matter.’

Since the Purple Smoke Gate wanted the mountain and Yehui needed to be placated, Fu En’s fate was sealed. Li Ximing could only concede.

“That can be arranged,” he said. “But what of the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate to the east?”

The Profound Peak Gate bordered their territory, and even though the Sword Gate had already claimed land around Lake Xian—prompting a hurried apology from Sumian—their official stance was still required. Li Ximing’s question was expected.

“Do not worry,” Tinglan replied smoothly. “Daoist Master Lingmei has already stated that he will no longer interfere in the affairs of the Profound Peak Gate.”

With that, Li Ximing had nothing left to say. He took a sip of his tea. “Moving a Purple Mansion array is a troublesome affair. I must ask for your assistance, Daoist Master.”

Tinglan knew he had agreed, but she still lowered her head in thought. Li Ximing’s request meant she would have to personally enter the Great Void and retrieve the array. To outsiders who didn’t know the details of this chess game, it would look as though she were taking advantage of the chaos to steal the Profound Peak Gate’s grand array.

Given that Li Ximing had no skill in the Dao of formations, the request was reasonable. ‘So be it,’ Tinglan thought. ‘Those watching from the Great Void are just spectators. With a little thought, they’ll understand the situation.’

She nodded, and the matter was settled. Li Ximing produced the secret incantation for the Profound Peak Gate’s formation disk, along with the jade pendant, and handed them to her.

“In that case,” Tinglan said, “Zhaojing, you should begin making arrangements. The first signs will appear within the next few months. Once this is resolved, I will visit the lake to set up the new array.”

She made no mention of alchemy in front of Sumian, speaking only of the formation. The old Daoist Master listened with a smile. “With this matter settled, I can finally enter seclusion. Many of my affairs were delayed because of the Profound Peak Gate.”

The spring rain continued its gentle patter outside as the three of them drank tea and conversed in a relaxed atmosphere.

Sumian tilted his chin up. “A friend of mine who cultivates in the Yan Kingdom shared some interesting news. The northern tribes have grown more aggressive in recent years. Several large confederations have emerged, boasting an army of a hundred thousand, and they even have Purple Mansion cultivators among them now.”

Tinglan showed no surprise. “Emperor Zhao has lost his authority. He can’t even leave his own palace, let alone control his ancestral homeland in the north. After a century, it’s no surprise that turmoil has erupted.”

“I have another friend who has been struggling to gather a particular type of Qi and needs the conflict of nations to advance,” Sumian continued. “When he heard the news a few months ago, he was overjoyed and went there immediately. I hear many ancient ruins have been unearthed as well, leading to speculation that a person of great destiny has appeared.”

Li Ximing sipped his tea in silence. ‘Right, everyone has friends everywhere… I’ve only just become a Daoist Master and have hardly left Jiangnan.’

Unaware of his thoughts, Sumian pressed on, his line of questioning clearly intentional. “Since there is a person of destiny, have you gone to see, fellow Daoist? Could it be a reincarnation of a sacred land’s Daoist Master?”

His question was a veiled reference to Daoist Master Zipei, a subtle probe. But Tinglan was direct.

“Why would someone like that reincarnate in such a place, only to become a pawn in another’s game?” she laughed. “You worry too much, old friend! Besides, my Purple Smoke Gate has an elder at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm. Although his whereabouts are often unknown, he went to take a look. If it were truly her, he would have brought the person back long ago.”

Her tone was smooth and natural, without a hint of hesitation, as if the missing peak Purple Mansion cultivator was exactly as the sect claimed: elusive, but occasionally returning for seclusion. Her words made it sound as if she had just seen him recently.

Sumian nodded repeatedly.

Tinglan continued, “After all, he is old and has his own affairs to arrange. He’s so busy that he’s almost never seen… Ultimately, these matters fall to us, the younger generation.”

Sumian quickly interjected, “I once cultivated in the Eastern Sea and met the Senior near the barbarian isles. We spoke for a time, and his guidance was immensely beneficial. I am forever grateful. If you ever have the chance to see him upon his return to the sect, please send for me so I may pay my respects.”

Tinglan’s expression remained unchanged as she nodded in agreement. Soon after, she and Li Ximing took their leave. Sumian escorted them all the way out of the Xuanmiao Temple, leaving the courtyard to the quiet, drizzling rain.

After the time it takes for half an incense stick to burn, Sumian tore through the Great Void and returned, a thoughtful look on his face. He sat down on his prayer mat and murmured to himself, “If Senior Wen truly returns to the sect often, he would have heard the news of my own sect’s founding and would surely have clarified matters. Tinglan couldn’t possibly be unaware of the events on the isles… which means she hasn’t seen him in at least sixteen or seventeen years.”

He paused. “Whether he has fallen or is simply missing… as long as he’s not around, I can use the Qi-Stone Demonic Embryo with more confidence.”

***

After leaving the Xuanmiao Temple’s domain, Li Ximing stepped into the Great Void. Tinglan traveled alongside him, clearly having lingered for a private word.

“About the pills…” the woman began with a smile. “I’ll have to trouble you.”

Li Ximing waved his hand dismissively. “Daoist Master, please don’t say that. Zhaojing is incredibly grateful that you took time from your busy schedule to resolve my family’s troubles.”

Pleasantries cost nothing. After offering a few words of flattery, Li Ximing saw Tinglan get to the point.

“Since we are using the Profound Peak Gate’s formation, I should offer you some compensation for helping with the modifications.”

The terms of the alchemy had already been decided: any pills produced beyond the first three would belong to Li Ximing. He was confident he could refine more than three, and gaining the services of a Purple Mansion formation master on top of that was a profitable deal no matter how he looked at it. Still, he sighed.

“I dare not accept your payment in advance, fellow Daoist. If I fail to refine the pills, I would be too ashamed to face you again.”

Tinglan clearly disliked that possibility. She didn’t believe he would waste such a precious portion of primal water, and she forced a smile. “You should still tell me what you need now. I can look for it while I’m traveling. Otherwise, we’ll just waste more time, and I’d hate to keep you waiting.”

Li Ximing could see that Tinglan was a cultivator who liked to have everything planned and in order. He relented. “It’s difficult for me to decide on such short notice. However, I am in need of a high-quality Bright Yang Dharma artifact to serve as a spirit embryo. An ancient one would be best. Do you have any leads?”

“Oh?” Tinglan considered this for a moment, then nodded. “That shouldn’t be a problem. I can select a few artifacts from the Purple Smoke Gate’s collection for Zhaojing to choose from. As for an ancient artifact… I will have to make some inquiries.”

It was a small request, but Li Ximing had his own plans. He wasn’t just asking Tinglan; he also intended to write to the Azure Pond Sect, inquire with the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate, and even have Cui Jueyin send a letter back to his own clan.

The reason for such complexity was not just to have a wider selection. Having met so many Purple Mansion cultivators, a seed of caution had taken root in his heart.

‘I need a Bright Yang Dharma artifact to forge my spirit embryo, preferably an ancient one. This item will become my personal Purple Mansion Dharma Artifact. How can I let anyone know its form and function so easily? Not even its abilities from the Foundation Establishment Realm. I must create a smokescreen, make it impossible for anyone to know for sure which artifact I used to forge my spirit embryo.’

As he pondered this, he asked another question. “The Hundred Mountains Concealed Storage Spirit Array is excellent, but when you relocate and rebuild it… could you modify it as much as possible? It can be of similar power, or even slightly weaker. I just ask that it be significantly different.”

After all, the array belonged to the Profound Peak Gate. If he took it and set it up on Pingya Island exactly as it was, anyone passing by would recognize it. More importantly, what would the numerous former members of the Profound Peak Gate think when they saw their grand array protecting his island?

The damage to his reputation was one concern; the security risk was another, and a far greater one. The Profound Peak Gate’s legacy would now be scattered. The Li family would have a part of it, as would Yehui, Zhu Gong, Sumian, and even Tinglan. What if one of them held a core record of the array’s weaknesses? He had no desire to become the next Fei family.

“Oh?”

If his first condition was minor, this second one was rather troublesome. Tinglan hesitated. “A Purple Mansion array… every node is carefully researched and meticulously placed. If you change even one part, corresponding adjustments must be made throughout the entire formation. Adapting it to a new landscape on top of that… it would take an enormous amount of effort…”

Li Ximing smiled. “Refining these pills will take five or six years. That should give you enough time to work on the formation. I’m not asking for a complete overhaul, just enough changes so that it looks completely different on the surface, with a few key components altered.”

His tone shifted as he let out a sigh. “With the Profound Peak Gate’s legacy scattered, your friend may one day come to my door, and I might have to grudgingly return her people. Those cultivators are intimately familiar with the Hundred Mountains Concealed Storage Spirit Array. My family doesn’t want to be left with such a vulnerability.”

By mentioning Zhu Gong, he put her on the spot. Tinglan paused. It was true that Li Ximing had been very accommodating, allowing her to arrange everything.

“Very well,” she conceded. “Leave it to me. I will set aside the time to modify it over the next few years.”

With their agreement settled, they parted ways. Li Ximing tore through the Great Void, flying until he reached his own territory and materialized on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The rain didn’t seem to fall over the lake here; the mountain was perpetually bright and radiant, its slopes carpeted with drifting blossoms.

As was his routine, he first retrieved the Profound Pattern Vase from the Baleful Earth to refine it. The fire-attribute baleful Qi within the vase had accumulated to a significant degree, making it progressively harder to refine. But with a single activation of his Valley Wind Flame-Guiding Art, the process became effortless.

By now, the baleful Qi in the vase was far too potent for any Foundation Establishment cultivator to handle. Only a Purple Mansion cultivator who had mastered a divine ability could continue the refinement. Li Ximing estimated that in another ten years, even cultivators without a Fire Virtue divine ability would be unable to manage it. But for him, with his unique art, both the speed and difficulty of refinement were trivial.

Li Ximing lifted his sleeve and examined the vase. Wisps of crimson patterns, like rising flames, had begun to appear on its surface. Despite all his efforts, however, its power was still at the Foundation Establishment level and useless against a Purple Mansion cultivator.

‘The material of the Profound Pattern Vase is extraordinary, but there’s no sign that its refinement is reaching its limit. It only increases in power, not in mystique… The gap between Foundation Establishment and Purple Mansion is too vast. It’s not just a matter of whether you can hurt them, but whether you can even hit them. The moment I pull out my artifact, they can just escape into the Great Void. What’s the point?’

Still, with the vase in his hands, Li Ximing felt no fear, only a hope that its potential would remain limitless each time he picked it up. He returned the small bottle to the earthen fire and reappeared on the mountain peak.

White flowers covered the ground. The stone table and chairs were clear; the gardenias dared not fall where he usually sat, forming a pristine circle around it. The tea on the table was still warm.

He raised an eyebrow and saw a Jade Court Guard waiting at the foot of the steps. The guard, clad in white armor, was stationed permanently on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. His surname was Dou; he was, technically speaking, a distant cousin. His father, Dou Yi, had been one of his own father’s most trusted men. The Dou clan had been in decline in recent years, and Li Zhouwei had sent the young man here as a gesture of goodwill and support.

“What is it?” Li Ximing asked.

The guard, having served for a year, had grown somewhat accustomed to his master’s sudden appearances and disappearances, but he still jumped in fright. He quickly bowed. “Reporting to the Daoist Master! The Young Lord came by. He said he has an urgent matter to report.”

“Send him up.”

Li Ximing sat down and took out the recipe for the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill to study it. Li Jiangqian arrived shortly, holding a letter.

“Reporting to the Daoist Master,” he said respectfully. “A letter from the Azure Pond Sect.”

Li Ximing nodded and took it. Li Jiangqian had reported to him nearly every time he had been away, and they had become familiar with the routine. The young man proceeded to report on the family’s various affairs.

Li Jiangqian’s management style was clearly different from Li Zhouwei’s. His father would handle everything meticulously and rarely disturbed him. This young man, however, came up the mountain more frequently. He would provide a concise, rapid, and accurate overview of the family’s operations and progress. Li Ximing would listen casually, gaining a general understanding of the clan’s state, and was often asked for his input on various matters.

Li Zhouwei was already the White Qilin of the Li family, one of the few who could consult with Li Ximing as an equal. But Li Jiangqian, as a member of the younger generation, was eager to make an impression on the family’s Daoist Master, hoping to strengthen his own authority. Li Ximing saw this clearly and permitted his visits every time.



# Chapter 752: Courtly Red Dust

Upon receiving the letter, Li Ximing recognized his brother's handwriting at a glance. As always, Li Xizhi’s tone was polite and carefully measured. It was the same courteous manner he had adopted in his letters home when he first became the Master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion. Back then, it had seemed a sign of humility; now, even after Li Ximing had become a Daoist Master, his brother's tone remained unchanged, a testament that he was not one to ride on another's coattails.

Li Ximing read the letter, his thoughts turning inward.

'Si Xunhui... the Empty Response Dispersion.'

The Empty Response Dispersion was one of the three core Dao lineages of Xiaoshi Mountain. For the Si family to send one of their direct descendants to pursue this path, and to specifically request entry through his family’s gate, was a clear signal.

'Daoist Master Yuanxiu’s lifespan is running short. By having his own kin trained in a Xiaoshi Mountain lineage, he's likely hoping to stumble upon some opportunity. He wants a hand in their affairs.'

'This move serves two purposes. First, it gives him a way into Xiaoshi Mountain through my family. Second, it’s a gesture of goodwill. By having his descendant study under my brother, he’s securing an ally for the Si family’s future…'

Si Boxiu’s overture was not necessarily a bad thing for Li Ximing. The Azure Pond Sect was situated in a critical location, deep within their territory, and stability there was paramount. He considered the situation further.

'Si Xunhui is only at the Qi Refining realm. Wang Quwan is already on the verge of Foundation Establishment, so their paths are unlikely to cross. However, the other two lineages of Xiaoshi Mountain are still unaccounted for. Opportunities could still arise.'

He took out a brush and paper, penned a reply, and handed it to Li Jiangqian to be delivered. "You seem to be in good spirits," he remarked. "Is there good news?"

A smile broke across Li Jiangqian’s face. "The Daoist Master's insight is as sharp as ever. The Guanxie Pavilion has been completed and erected at the Inherited Clarity Gate. The Jade Court has also been built at the foot of Mount Yuting. Its palaces stretch on and on, and all the Court Guards have moved in. We have one at the Foundation Establishment realm, nineteen who have attained Qi, eighty-nine at Embryonic Breathing, and over twenty thousand elite mortal soldiers. It is truly a court in name and in fact. More than ninety-six thousand people reside at the foot of the mountain, far exceeding the conditions required for Qi gathering."

"A few days ago," he continued, his voice brimming with excitement, "Protector Li Wen went inside to gather Qi and truly manifested signs of the Courtly Red Dust Qi! The family's *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* can finally be cultivated!"

"Excellent!"

The Guanxie Pavilion was a crucial site for Li Ximing's own plans to refine a Spirit Embryo. He had been paying close attention to it but hadn't pushed for its completion due to the lack of a suitable artifact. He was pleasantly surprised it had been finished so soon.

As for acquiring the Courtly Red Dust Qi, it meant the family now had an additional Purple Mansion Dao lineage. Li Ximing was naturally overjoyed. Moreover, the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* was an ancient technique practiced by the direct line of the Jiang family, survivors of a fallen Immortal Mansion. In this new era where jade was flourishing, its power might be far greater than imagined.

Li Jiangqian bowed respectfully. "I have come to request the Daoist Master's decree. How should we manage this cultivation method?"

Li Ximing tapped his fingers on the jade table. "The Court Guards practice the *Sutra of the Courtly Guardian*, a method designed for rapid progression. While the technique itself is unremarkable, its strength lies in the swift transition from Embryonic Breathing to Qi Refining. We typically select cultivators with lower talent from humble backgrounds to train in it. However, they are inherently suppressed by those who cultivate the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* and would stand no chance against them. The cultivation of the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* must be held firmly in our own hands."

There were other reasons the Li family used the *Sutra of the Courtly Guardian*. A critical factor was that gathering Qi for it was astonishingly cheap; one only needed to dig a well, requiring almost no spirit stones.

"When the Jiang family was destroyed, their cultivation method was scattered," Li Ximing recalled. "The surviving members should have all had copies, but they were later wiped out, leaving only the An family branch. I remember my father severed their connection to the technique long ago. Has this been thoroughly investigated and confirmed?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, I have looked into it," Li Jiangqian said respectfully. "There are still a few families with outside ties to the Yu family in Nanzhang, but during the rebellion, they failed to breach the Yu family's treasury and never obtained the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra*. However, in reading the Yu family's history, I discovered a small family on the northern part of the eastern shore with the surname Pu. They are descendants of the Jiang family. I made a special request for Granduncle Chenghuai to pay them a visit, and he found that they did indeed possess a hidden copy."

Li Ximing gestured for him to continue.

"I have invited the direct line of the Pu family here," Li Jiangqian explained. "I had the father and son swear a spiritual oath to sever their inheritance of the technique. As compensation, I established a hereditary position for them within the Jade Court to shelter their descendants. This branch will now cultivate within the Jade Court. In time, a newborn from their line will be sent back to the Pu family to inherit their title. After two generations, the technique's lineage will be completely broken."

"Well done. Although we now control the Qi, making the technique useless to others, it is wise to take precautions and prevent outsiders from prying into the secrets of our Dao lineage."

Li Ximing sipped his tea and nodded in approval, though other thoughts were brewing in his mind.

He had long known that Li Zhouwei's children were not close to one another. Over a century had passed since the clan’s founding. The three remaining main branches of the family still shared some kinship, but their numbers were dwindling.

Now, more and more of the cultivators in the region were geniuses produced by the sheer numbers of collateral branches, who would then return to the main family line. Having spent time outside, these returning members felt even more distant. With Li Jiangqian managing the mid-to-high levels of the clan's administration, outsiders and members of these returning branches were gradually becoming the majority.

'The blessings of a great man fade after five generations. The Youngest Branch, with my brother's help, at least managed to produce Chenghuai and Zhouluo. But the First Branch has been diluted by its vast mortal population. Though they have many cultivators, no true geniuses have emerged…'

Li Jiangqian had handled the matter beautifully, and Li Ximing offered no further comment. Yet, he understood the underlying politics. The An family held considerable influence in the Jade Court. Li Wen was a lone official with no faction, but this Pu family branch would undoubtedly become Li Jiangqian’s people.

He had to view every cultivator in the family not as an individual but as part of a larger web. Li Jiangqian was more than just himself; he represented the Second Branch and, through his mother, the An family. Whether it was Li Jianglong or Li Jiangxia, their innate desire for power was one thing, but the power they gained served not just them but the factions behind them.

Li Jiangqian had his own supporters: the An family, the Second Branch, and a large group of cultivators who upheld the system of primogeniture. From another perspective, wasn't this move also a self-preservation tactic by the An family, an attempt to shore up their waning influence after the loss of An Siwei?

There was nothing inherently wrong with it, so Li Ximing let it be. "This technique is powerful," he said. "Someone from the direct line must cultivate it. I recall Li Jiangliang is only at the Embryonic Breathing realm. By the time he is ready, the Qi will be available for him to harvest. Let him be the one."

"As you command," Li Jiangqian replied, but then added, "However, there was a marriage agreement for Jiangliang with the Profound Peak Gate."

"They wouldn't dare bring it up now," Li Ximing answered dismissively. He hesitated for a moment, however. If the Profound Peak Gate did produce a Purple Mansion cultivator in the next few years, the matter might not be so simple. He amended his decision. "In that case, let Jiangnian cultivate it. As for Jiangliang… let your father decide his path!"

Li Jiangqian acknowledged the order and withdrew. After a moment of quiet contemplation, Li Ximing’s form flickered and vanished into the Great Void.

***

The Eastern Sea.

Jagged black reefs pierced the sky. Waves crashed against them, not with white foam, but with an inky darkness. The surface of the sea held no reflection. Here, in the far eastern reaches of the Eastern Sea, the spiritual Qi grew thin, and the fabric of the Great Void became placid.

Beneath the surface, the water was a profound, lightless black. Occasionally, a few spirit fish would dart by, but the depths were otherwise empty. In the midst of this deep, silent vista, a young man in a green robe with a golden tassel at his waist sat cross-legged, his eyes shut in meditation.

Before him pulsed a colossal array of interwoven turquoise patterns, like a gigantic agate dome sealing the seabed. The reef below, hardened over millennia to a point where even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would struggle to scratch it, was sliced cleanly apart as if it were tofu, its severed pieces scattered across the ocean floor.

After an unknown amount of time, the young man slowly opened his eyes. His irises were a pale cyan, and the restless Pristine Water swirled around him, forming a faint turquoise halo that stood in stark contrast to the black water of the deep sea.

"Friend! What do you think of my formation?"

The young man’s cheerful voice traveled through the water, unimpeded by the crushing pressure, and pierced into the array. A second later, the sea around the formation began to boil violently, and a thunderous shriek echoed out.

"Chi Buzi! Have you lost your mind? When have I ever offended you?!"

Chi Buzi rose from the reef and descended through the water, a smile playing on his lips. "It is precisely because you have never offended me that I can trap you here, is it not? It’s only been two years of refining, and I haven’t even made my move yet. What’s the rush, friend?"

"Besides," he added, "this is the World's Navel, the domain of the True Monarch of Wondrous Transformation. My reverence and admiration for her are boundless. I would naturally not take your life in this place. You can rest assured!"

Chi Buzi’s words fell, and the demon inside the array was so incensed it fell silent for three full breaths.

He knew exactly how aggrieved the demon felt. He had laid this trap piece by piece, a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator with four divine abilities preying on a weaker target. He had fabricated traces of ancient ruins, pretended to enter seclusion nearby, and then simply waited for her to come to him.

She had seen the formation from the Great Void but, assuming it was merely part of a Purple Mansion cultivator’s seclusion, had paid it no mind. As she drew closer, she was deceived by Chi Buzi's art of concealment and failed to notice that the array was a full circle larger than it appeared to her spiritual sense.

Even then, the demon had approached cautiously from a distance, remaining beyond the array's reach. Chi Buzi had patiently played along for nearly two years before she finally, inadvertently, stepped before the array and was ensnared by his divine ability.

Once she was trapped, Chi Buzi had used a spiritual artifact to suppress her, reinforcing the array with his arts day after day. He had waited in silence for two years, to the point where the demon almost believed the array was malfunctioning and that he, too, had been fooled.

Now, the truth was out. The demon was on the verge of coughing up blood. Her voice, surprisingly, was that of a charming young woman. "Chi Buzi! Even we beasts know of parents and kin! You, a man with no sect and no clan, who stood by and watched the Azure Pond Sect fall into new hands, you are a truly fickle villain! Not a single word from your mouth can be trusted. My only regret is believing you, never imagining you were just some unhinged madman!"

Chi Buzi laughed. "Only a beast would fail to understand. Sects use secret teachings to coerce and control you. Clans use bloodlines to establish their tyranny. The two are intertwined, a turbid current of filth. How could I allow my enlightened self to be shackled by such vulgar, mortal concerns? And you, a mere beast, can only speak of parents."

Though she was also at the Purple Mansion realm, the demon was no match for Chi Buzi, who had studied the classics since childhood. His words left her speechless. "I may be a beast," she retorted, "but you are a monster! How can you say such things?"

Chi Buzi no longer deigned to reply. He stepped into the array, and as he did, the surrounding seawater transformed from black to turquoise. It separated into two layers, turbid below and clear above, a change that extended all the way to the surface, where a downpour began to fall from the sky.

As Chi Buzi entered the formation, walking upon the Pristine Water, the Purple Mansion demon was terrified. She had only just broken through to her realm. With the Great Void sealed off, how could she possibly be his opponent? "Chi Buzi," she pleaded, "I have sworn an oath beneath the Tree of One Heart! The Luan-Phoenixes know my name. You should think carefully about what you're doing."

He answered her with a smile. "I chose you precisely for that reason! What does it matter if they know? You swore a single oath. In your current predicament, who will bother to come for you?"

In an instant, the array erupted with power. The might of the Pristine Water surged, and a brilliant Lesser Yin radiance filled the space, coalescing into countless icebergs like fields of white snow. A gloomy aura began to rise but was mercilessly crushed by the Pristine Water.

The demon had the appearance of a beautiful young maiden, clad only in a translucent blue veil. But under the crushing force of the Pristine Water, she could no longer maintain her form and revealed her true self: a spirit sparrow with brilliant blue and white feathers.

Chi Buzi had not even glanced at her human form, as if he were afraid it would dirty his eyes. But her true form made his eyes light up, and he looked her up and down with admiration. "Excellent, excellent," he sighed. "Another feathered-beast, just as the ancient texts described. Lesser Yin transforms into feathers, Bright Yang into carapaces. The latter is often considered a fallacy, but the former is almost always true!"

The spirit sparrow couldn't comprehend why this person was so intent on harming her. Hearing him ramble on about ancient books, she gritted her beak in fury. "Idiot…"

The two clashed, their battle shaking the formation and churning the sea outside. Light and shadow flickered across the surface as the rain continued to fall, unabated, for more than half a month. Several cultivators passing by were drawn to the phenomenon and stopped to observe from a distance.

"The Pristine Water flows without end. Could there be a treasure emerging here?"

Their cultivation was too low to venture into the deep sea, so their watch was fruitless. Down below, the Purple Mansion demon was nearing her limit. After a long and brutal fight, most of her feathers had been shorn off. Pushing back against the Pristine Water with all her might, she charged toward the edge of the great array.

With a desperate, muffled cry, she slammed her head into the formation's barrier. The impact was made with suicidal force. With a deafening boom, the demon's head exploded into a thick, ghastly white mist that splattered across the array.

A divine ability flared. The great array, already weakened by half a month of attacks, finally wavered under the powerful blow. In the single instant that it faltered, a sliver of the Great Void was exposed. In that instant, the demon vanished.

Chi Buzi remained unhurried. With a casual wave of his hand, the great array shrank and flew back into his sleeve. Bolstered by his own divine abilities and spiritual artifacts, he knew the demon could not have outrun him even at her peak, let alone now that she was grievously injured.

He murmured to himself, "What an obedient little demon. I said she couldn't die at the World's Navel, and she dutifully fled elsewhere to do it!"

Chi Buzi tore open the Great Void and sped through, but it was empty, as if no trace of her remained. He paid it no mind. He extended a hand, hooked his little finger, and touched his thumb to his index finger.

'From where do the clear and turbid arise?' he chanted internally. 'In the radiant pool, I see ice and scorching heat and bitter cold—these are the traces of Lesser Yin.'

His eyes flashed with understanding. He stepped through the Great Void and immediately spotted the spirit sparrow. She was fast, but not fast enough. Halfway through her flight, she gave up on the Great Void and plunged back into the physical world.

The moment the spirit sparrow emerged, she found herself above the sea, right where the group of cultivators was still gathered. There were more than a dozen of them now, scattered about, each warily eyeing the others, all convinced a treasure was about to surface. The injured Purple Mansion demon, without a second thought, devoured them all—ancestors of great families and masters of small temples alike—and flew away without a sound.



# Chapter 753: Another Job

Chi Buzi burst from the void close behind her, his green robes fluttering. He caught sight of the carnage, and his voice thundered in rage: "Vile demon! I trapped you with my divine abilities, yet you still dare to devour mortals! You are truly courting your own doom! If I fail to capture you today, I will have failed my cultivation!"

The spirit sparrow sped through the air. His words struck her ears, causing every feather on her body to stand on end as fury flooded her chest. 'You... you! You running dog of the Pristine Water, you shameless demonic cultivator! The Azure Pond Sect kills more people in a year than I have feathers on my body, and you have the audacity to lecture *me* about devouring mortals!'

She had cultivated in the overseas realms for many years. With her celestial bearing, she was treated as a Purple Mansion immortal wherever she went. Since achieving true sentience, she rarely consumed mortal flesh. She had only done so now out of absolute desperation. Chi Buzi’s hypocritical scolding left her choking on unspoken bitterness. With no time to even turn and argue, she simply lowered her head and flew desperately onward.

Seeing that she offered no retort, Chi Buzi continued his pursuit, shouting insults as they flew. The two figures flickered in and out of the Great Void, one chasing, one fleeing, until they reached the absolute farthest eastern reaches of the Eastern Sea. The edge of the world was just ahead. The spirit sparrow abruptly wheeled around, tearing back into the Great Void to return the way she came.

Chi Buzi, however, had been patiently herding her eastward this entire time. How could he let her turn back? He shook his head. "Friend, that simply won't do."

He immediately retrieved a cauldron from his sleeve. Tossing it into the air, it instantly swelled to the size of a small house. Chi Buzi chanted an incantation, swept his sleeve across the vessel, and following a clear chime, he declared: "I petition the Palace of Heavenly Aspect to shift its position. Let there be rain."

The spiritual artifact was intrinsically tied to the Pristine Water lineage. As Chi Buzi channeled his power, he simultaneously activated a divine ability. 『Heavy Murk』 manifested as rolling gray qi that spread at terrifying speed, blanketing the sky and sea, casting everything into a gloomy twilight.

The spirit sparrow saw the world ahead of her change abruptly. Rain began to lash the surface of the sea, transforming the world into a boundless expanse of gray. Fear struck her heart, and she immediately fled back into the Great Void.

But Chi Buzi followed close behind. The sparrow flew for some time before he caught up again, forcing her back into the physical world. She blinked, realizing that the Great Void around her had become uniform and placid; she could no longer distinguish any direction or location.

"What kind of spiritual artifact is this!"

She was forced to pick a random spot and return to the physical world. She was met again by the same gray, misty rain. Rolling fog churned below her, obscuring her path and leaving her completely disoriented. Gritting her beak, she plunged into the roiling mist below, only to shoot out an instant later from the rain clouds *above*—colliding directly with Chi Buzi, who waited with his hands clasped behind his back, watching her coldly.

'This spiritual artifact is extraordinary... It's an ancient spirit treasure!'

Chi Buzi’s divine ability did not wait. He had been gathering power, and now a torrent of turquoise Pristine Water crashed down. The sparrow had never cultivated a body divine ability, was already injured, and was weaker than him to begin with. She took the blow head-on. It felt as if her bones and feathers were melting, and she let out a piercing, tragic shriek.

This attack struck at her very life force. The spirit sparrow remanifested in another location, flying blindly, her heart filled with despair. 'All of the Azure Pond Sect’s spiritual artifacts must have ended up in this bastard’s hands! A dignified late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, armed with three spiritual artifacts and a great array, and he *still* had to resort to ambushes and deception to trap a junior like me…'

But no matter how long she flew, she was caught again, struck by another divine ability. She grew sluggish. Chi Buzi's array had been terrifying enough, and now this ancient spiritual artifact... Her heart turned to ice.

She flew while frantically observing her surroundings. Occasionally, a few small islands would flash past in her vision. This at least proved the spell wasn't forcing her to fly in circles, not as tyrannical as that spiritual artifact belonging to Ning Tiaoxiao...

'But the Eastern Sea is vast! This miraculous artifact, combined with Chi Buzi’s deliberate herding, is more than enough to prevent my escape! How can I just wait inside this spiritual artifact’s rain-curtain, letting his Pristine Water divine ability slice me apart like death by a thousand cuts?'

She was tormented by her predicament, but Chi Buzi never let his guard down. This spirit sparrow had, after all, attained the Dao through the Lesser Yin lineage as an rogue cultivator. Though he had never heard of her acquiring any great opportunities, one could never be careless when facing a Purple Mansion opponent.

He paused slightly, but the spirit sparrow suddenly wheeled around. She unleashed her Lesser Yin divine ability at full power, converging it into streams of white tassels before her. Chi Buzi didn't recognize the specific technique, but he had investigated her background thoroughly and could guess its nature.

'A Lesser Yin divine ability, 『All-Fragrance Sinks』. This power is born from the first blush of splendor and the onset of Yin-cold. It commands cold, yet contains fire; it commands Yin, yet it is dry. Since 『All-Fragrance Sinks』 is a spell art divine ability, it must be a fusion of that cold and dryness, manifesting as flame.'

As he analyzed it, the white tassels indeed erupted with an eerie Yin-fire, vaporizing the surrounding rain into mist. Even the gray fog below showed signs of dissipating. Chi Buzi could not allow that; he simply flicked a finger.

『Clear Dusk Rain』!

A torrential downpour descended, temporarily suppressing the flames. The sparrow pushed her power to the limit, causing the fire to flicker erratically in the rain, becoming unstable. A flicker of regret crossed Chi Buzi’s mind.

'The Lesser Yin's Sovereign Fire of Cold and Dryness should be suppressed by the Pristine Water's Purging Jewel Dew. It is a perfect counter. If I just had that one divine ability, capturing this demon would be effortless. But unfortunately, I never managed to acquire the 『Purging Dew』 ability!'

The Azure Pond Sect's legacy was incomplete. The Qi-gathering method for the associated technique, the *Art of the Dew-Calamity Splendor*, was unattainable. The Chi family had spent years collecting fragments of the technique, but every attempt at gathering the required Qi failed. Therefore, even he, a direct descendant of the Chi family, had been unable to master 『Purging Dew』.

The Pristine Water lineage was clearly dominant, yet gathering the Qi for 『Purging Dew』 always failed. Chi Buzi hadn't dared to overthink it while at the Azure Pond Sect, but out here in the Eastern Sea, the truth was obvious. Who else could it be but the explicit will of their own True Monarch of Pristine Water?

As long as that True Monarch held this intention, all Qi-gathering methods for that specific art were rendered useless. The specific spiritual Qi required by the Chi family’s technique had never been found in any ancient ruin. Chi Rui had tried to use a Pristine-Water harmonization method and repeatedly failed. Chi Wei had also failed to achieve 『Purging Dew』 and had been forced to use 『Horn Wood』 as a substitute to cultivate...

His thoughts were wandering, but the spirit sparrow seized the moment, switching from defense to offense. Her sharp, pale-yellow beak snapped open, revealing rows upon rows of fine, needle-like teeth. A blinding, deep-white brilliance erupted from her throat.

Chi Buzi finally turned serious. His hand seals changed, and the great cauldron burst from the Great Void to shield him. His pupils slowly shifted from pale cyan to a deep, profound turquoise.

『Spring's Echo』!

This potent ability, both a Life and a Body Divine Ability, activated instantly. His physical form dissolved into the water of the Spring's Echo, merging seamlessly into the great cauldron as the tinkling sound of a bubbling spring filled the air.

A full incense stick of time passed before the sparrow’s desperate, life-risking blast of white light finally knocked the great cauldron over with a deafening clang. The spring water was blasted free, but a voice emerged from within the turquoise-gray liquid itself:

"The spring echoes; turbidity rests within the water. Therefore, it neither congeals nor ceases; it neither dries nor halts. Your Sovereign Fire may be strong, but how can it possibly harm me?"

The spring water surged forward, defying the deep-white light, while the great cauldron simultaneously pressed down from above. The brilliance dimmed, and the surrounding gray turbidity thickened once more, sealing her fate.

This single exchange revealed the vast chasm in their Dao attainment. This was a gap the demon could not hope to cross. Despair flooded the spirit sparrow’s heart. She had only just broken through to her realm. How could she fight back? Chi Buzi surpassed her in cultivation, possessed stronger divine abilities, used miraculous arrays and spiritual artifacts, and held a far deeper understanding of the Dao. This was utterly hopeless.

"It's 『Spring's Echo』!"

The spirit sparrow recognized it an instant too late. Realizing he must have activated his core Life Divine Ability, she tried to seize the opening, but it was already gone. The turquoise-gray Pristine Water was already descending upon her.

Chi Buzi remained vigilant. Though the sparrow was trapped, she was not incapable of fighting to the death. If she died here, all his years of careful preparation would be for nothing.

Thus, while maintaining the pressure of the Pristine Water, he allowed his form to reappear, a confident smile of absolute victory on his face. "Friend, do not be alarmed," he said. "I went to all this trouble not to end your life."

The demon did not believe him for a second. "Then let us fight to the death! My abilities may be shallow, but if I burn my life, I can certainly injure you!"

Chi Buzi blinked, his expression turning utterly sincere. He looked earnest, almost righteous. "I truly have no intention of killing you. Our Dao lineages are unrelated, and there is no enmity between us. You possess no great spiritual artifacts or treasures, so why would I harm you? I am merely trying to secure an opportunity related to the Lesser Yin lineage, and I was afraid you might try to seize it. That is why I was forced to take these measures."

The demon remained unconvinced. Chi Buzi kept the Pristine Water divine ability active, continuing: "A fight to the death helps neither of us. Friend, why not take a chance?"

Even as he spoke, a silver-white rope hidden within his sleeve began to glow faintly. He maintained his mask of sincerity, staring at her earnestly, while the pressure from the Pristine Water silently, steadily increased.

***

The World Within the Mirror.

Clouds of mist drifted past bright, translucent white tiles. Several stone lanterns stood in the courtyard, casting a pale yellow light. A young boy with pale-green eyes lay slumped over a stone desk, looking utterly demoralized.

'The *Art of Drumming Profundity Fire Refining*... a True Fire control technique. Let's see... it uses the Path of the Twelve-Storied Pagoda... What ancient era did this technique come from? Gotta fix it...'

Dangjiang listlessly picked up his brush and began making revisions. The pavilion was empty save for two dull-witted, Yellow-Armored Strongmen staring blankly ahead as they carried jade slips upstairs.

Dangjiang had received his promotion, but his workload hadn't lessened, and the number of people he saw had plummeted. Back when he was in the Honored Lord's mansion, near the Son of Heaven, there were at least a few people to talk to. Now he was tossed into this pavilion and couldn't even leave easily. It was misery.

After receiving commendations last year, he had begged and pleaded—not for a transfer, just for a colleague. Immortal Officer Liu finally told him he would be assigned two Strongmen as subordinates. Dangjiang was thrilled to finally be a boss, but when he returned to the pavilion, he discovered the two Strongmen were brainless puppets.

Dangjiang was disappointed, but no matter how stupid they were, at least they were someone to talk to, a way to break the monotony. Besides, there wasn't really anything to move in this place, making the two Strongmen redundant. This made Dangjiang feel a little guilty, so he kept quiet about it.

Still, every time he looked up and saw those same thick-browed, wide-eyed faces, it dampened his spirits. 'Next chance I get,' the boy mused, pausing his work, 'I’m changing their Dharma bodies. Both of them. They’re going to be serving maids. Graceful, gorgeous ones. One will hold a green pipa and wear white robes; the other will carry a jade pot, wear a pink skirt, and the pot will be filled with hot milk... Now *that* would be beautiful...'

He was lost in this fantasy for several moments when he heard a *knock-knock* at the gate.

Dangjiang leaped from his seat in joy, shouting, "My Lord, please enter!"

Sure enough, a white-robed Immortal Officer stepped into the courtyard. His features were plain, but Dangjiang was so happy he looked moved to tears. "Lord Liu!" he cried. "It’s been too long!"

Immortal Officer Liu gave a slight nod. "Greetings, fellow Daoist. I have been away. How goes your progress?"

Dangjiang, long accustomed to Liu's cold tone, didn't mind at all. Maintaining his enthusiastic grin, he immediately launched into his work: "I was just reviewing this *Art of Drumming Profundity Fire Refining*! The 'Profundity' here refers to the Profound Marsh, meaning to spread blessings across the Great Wilderness, taking the meaning of 'nothing is beyond its reach.' This fire refining art is ancient, so we must discuss the Twelve-Storied Pagoda..."

He opened his mouth and didn't stop, pulling concepts from the east, mixing them with the west, rambling north and south. He talked, and talked, and talked. Lu Jiangxian’s fists clenched, relaxed, and clenched again.

'Why, why did I ask?'

Lu Jiangxian had sent this avatar regarding the Chi Buzi situation. Chi Buzi was about to deliver a Purple Mansion demon, but Lu Jiangxian didn't have many high-value rewards to spare and was reluctant to grant him a Azure Talisman. He would most likely have to reward him with Talisman Pills and White Talismans.

Such a reward wasn't particularly generous, and Chi Buzi was the type who wouldn't release the hawk until he saw the rabbit. He was not easily fooled. Lu Jiangxian needed to ensure Chi Buzi remained a loyal asset, and he also saw this interaction as a trail run for engaging with the Li family.

He was too lazy to manage the interaction personally; he didn't want to have to put on an act every time they met. Chi Buzi was sharp, and no performance Lu Jiangxian mounted could match the genuine, heartfelt belief radiating from an honest soul like Dangjiang. So, he had decided to use Dangjiang.

But he'd been listening to this rambling monologue while, outside the Mirror-World, Chi Buzi had already beaten the demon into submission and was about to capture her. The timing was about to be missed. Lu Jiangxian finally snapped.

"Fellow Daoist, your words are indeed profound!" he interrupted, his voice tight. "Such fascinating speculations... However, I am here today... to bid you farewell!"

"Ah?"

Dangjiang, who had been at the peak of his rant, heard this thunderclap and froze. "This... how can this be! Is this the will of the Great Registrar?"

Immortal Officer Liu nodded grimly.

Dangjiang looked like he was about to burst into tears. "You are the only kindred spirit I have up here! No one else will even talk to me... All my work is submitted through you! If you leave, what am I going to do!"

"I am not descending for reincarnation," Liu said. "It is merely a position transfer. I just won't be able to see you as often. Someone else will come to handle the handovers... Do not worry. When I have the time, I will come and visit."

Dangjiang visibly relaxed. At least he wasn't vanishing forever like some other Immortal Officers. But then Immortal Officer Liu sighed. "However, one matter has been weighing heavily on my heart. I have a favor to ask you... I have thought about it for a long time, and I feel I must ask."

Dangjiang, eager to curry favor, slapped his chest. "My Lord, please speak! I will certainly do my best!"

Immortal Officer Liu hesitated. "With this transfer, my original duties in the mansion are now vacant. We are short-staffed in the heavens, and several other colleagues have descended to the mortal realm. My new post is on the other side of heaven, and traveling back and forth is simply too inconvenient. Therefore, I petitioned the Lord... thinking that I might ask you to cover for me for a time."

Dangjiang’s smile froze. His expression warped into one of stunned, mournful disbelief. He raised a trembling hand and pointed at himself.

"My Lord, you mean... your... your work..." he stammered. "Your *job*..."

"I have to do that, TOO?!"



# Chapter 754: Suspicion

"That's not how it works! Don't you dare complain about the job."

Immortal Official Liu just smiled.

"Weren't you the one saying day after day how tedious and burdensome this work is? My original post was a real plum assignment. I specifically saved this position for you. The work is novel, you get to hear endless flattery, and you can even observe the situation in the lower realm. Isn't that wonderful?"

He folded his sleeves, feigning disappointment.

"But if you're unwilling, then forget it!"

"My lord, wait!"

Hearing this, Dangjiang had a sudden realization. He wasn't the least bit tired anymore. He scrambled up from the table, forcing a smile.

"This lowly one was just confirming the details! Whatever tasks my lord arranges... I am happy to do them, sweet or bitter. Even the greatest hardship would be sweet as honey. How could I possibly complain? Only now do I realize my lord's kindness. I am truly, deeply moved!"

Lu Jiangxian knew he was a practiced flatterer and just said:

"I am pressed for time and cannot say more. Take my token. Leave this Secret Vault Profound Seven Pavilion of the Saintly Purity Palace and follow the path across the heavens. You will naturally see a treasure pavilion."

"We haven't had contact with the lower realm in years, so the staff in that pavilion has dwindled. Just match the token, ascend the steps, and someone will be there to receive you."

Dangjiang started to ask another question, but Lu Jiangxian cut him off immediately. He continued, mimicking Immortal Official Liu:

"I must depart now. You should have a lower realm sacrificial rite to attend to. If you are free, go and handle it immediately."

After speaking, he quickly took his leave. Dangjiang followed him reluctantly to the edge of the courtyard, hesitating.

"My lord previously said this pavilion must be guarded, which is why I've stayed here day after day. If I leave, this place will be empty. Won't I be charged with dereliction of duty?"

"Relax."

Lu Jiangxian had only given that order previously because he feared Dangjiang would wander off, forcing him to constantly find someone to cover the post. He replied, "As long as you carry my token and are performing official duties—not just idling or wandering aimlessly—it doesn't count as abandoning your post. You can stay securely at either location. Just hurry when traveling between them. Do not dally."

With that, he walked away quickly. Dangjiang couldn't leave the courtyard and could only watch him disappear over the horizon. He looked back at the token left on the table. It was the length of a forearm, pure white, and engraved with ornate, silvery Supreme Yin patterns. A single glance confirmed it was no ordinary item.

He admired it for a moment, glanced at the half-revised cultivation manual on his desk, and mused internally:

'I'll finish writing the last little bit, then go take a look.'

He buried his head in his research, but after only two lines, he couldn't wait any longer.

'I'll go check it out first. A quick look around will be a nice break, then I'll come back.'

He immediately stood up, left the small courtyard beneath the pavilion, and stepped onto the clouds. He took out the token, and just as expected, a faint silver star lit up in the distance. He flew through the streaming clouds, following the light closely.

Before long, the clouds and mist parted, revealing a vast, majestic grand hall. It was guarded by dragons and phoenixes, a scene of infinite, opulent splendor. Below his feet, a golden lake rippled, spanned by twelve white jade bridges leading to the central palace.

Dangjiang took one look and his eyes stung from the brilliance. He quickly lowered his gaze. He noticed rows upon rows of golden-armored Celestial Soldiers standing beside the white jade bridges, their armor magnificent, their gaze fixed forward.

Naturally, Dangjiang didn't dare strike up a conversation. He figured he wasn't qualified to set foot on those celestial bridges anyway. He looked down at his token; sure enough, it instructed him to circle around the lake. He dutifully lowered his gaze and hurried forward.

This palace complex was terrifyingly large. Even the lakeshore had guards. Dangjiang didn't dare even lift his eyebrows. He wound his way around, following the corridors deeper into the complex, the atmosphere growing more profound. He finally arrived at a palace gate by the lakeside.

Two even more imposing Celestial Soldiers guarded this gate. This time, one of them finally raised an eyebrow to look at him. Dangjiang just held up the token.

He heard one of them say, "Ah, an official from the Supreme Yin Palace. Please, enter."

Dangjiang hurried inside. Once through the palace gate, the decor gradually returned to the style of the Supreme Yin lineage. There was even a faint trace of snow on the ground. This area was also massive, and everything was opulent.

He twisted and turned, never missing an opportunity to observe his surroundings. There were quite a few people in this palace, but every single one seemed impossibly noble. The armor of the celestial generals was mostly just a step below a high decree, and some even looked equal. Celestial maidens drifted by, tassels fluttering. He finally spotted a few immortal officials, but every one of them was silent and frightened, not daring to speak.

Dangjiang was already an over-thinker. This one look was enough for him to understand his new standing. He just shrank his neck and hurried onward until he reached a small courtyard. The serving maids on either side closed the gate behind him, and only then did he let out a sigh of relief.

The small courtyard was perfectly orderly. The ground was paved with spotless white jade bricks, and four white jade lamp pedestals were spaced evenly. In the very center sat a round, bottomless pool. Other than these things, there was nothing else. It was obviously not a courtyard meant for habitation.

He circled the area, wringing his hands, unsure what to do. Suddenly, the token in his hand lit up. The water in the round pool rapidly turned a shimmering white. He knew it was time to work. He hurried forward and peered into the pool's depths.

He watched the white color in the pool recede, the surface becoming mirror-like. First, it was pitch black, then a faint light flickered. It seemed to be coming from an extremely hidden place. A respectful, prayer-like voice emerged, buzzing like a swarm of bees, gradually becoming clearer:

"...This lowly cultivator, Chi Buzi, having piously prepared this sacrificial offering, respectfully petitions the Supreme Yin, praying to the Celestial Officials to avert disaster and dispel evil, that my immortal path may be vast..."

Dangjiang froze. All his previous nervousness and anxiety vanished, replaced by a wave of smug satisfaction that spread across his face. He lifted his head and laughed.

"I was wondering which esteemed person it might be. So, it's our very own Daoist Master Chi!"

He channeled his spiritual sense into the token, activating the artifact to receive the connection. The light and shadow in the pool grew more and more real. After half a moment, the radiance flowed out and coalesced in the courtyard, forming the shape of a man in green robes.

The man had only just stabilized his footing when he realized his surroundings had abruptly changed. He was standing in a courtyard, shocked and suspicious. He looked up and saw a young immortal official with pale green eyes standing before him. The official’s robes were embroidered with Supreme Yin patterns. Although he didn't seem high-ranking, Chi Buzi reacted instantly, bowing immediately.

"This lowly cultivator greets you, my lord!"

Dangjiang was grinning so wide his mouth wouldn't close, his smile practically falling off his face. "Daoist Master Chi! Open your eyes and take a good look... Do you know who I am?"

Chi Buzi paused, then looked up. The man was young, but his mannerisms were oddly old, carrying a strange sense of familiarity. He couldn't help but hesitate...

Chi Buzi had never actually seen Dangjiang's true form. In the conflicts years ago, they were always fighting over control of *his* body. Even when Dangjiang won, it was still Chi Buzi's body, just with a new owner. But he was extremely clever.

'The only person I could possibly know up here... seems to be that damned donkey... This person doesn't look like an idiot, but his tone is *exactly* the same as that idiot's.'

He tested the waters: "Daoist Friend Dangjiang?"

He didn't even need Dangjiang's answer. One look at the smug grin on that idiot's face told him everything. Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow.

"Yo... the old bastard actually has some status up here?"

Despite being in a position where he clearly had to bow his head, Chi Buzi showed not a shred of fear, instead questioning him with a mocking laugh.

Sure enough, Dangjiang laughed aloud, then feigned anger. "You insolent demonic disciple! How dare you show such disrespect to an esteemed immortal official of The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity?"

The title sounded magnificent, but Chi Buzi wasn't scared. He had a keen grasp of human nature and, after so many years, understood Dangjiang perfectly. With this type of person, acting subservient only emboldens them. The only way was to laugh and curse, showing no fear.

Besides, after all those years of mutual scheming in the Eastern Sea... call it enmity, but with the Immortal Lord overseeing everything, would he really have let Dangjiang perish? Calling it "training" sounded nice, but whether it was hatred or camaraderie depended entirely on Chi Buzi's attitude.

And Chi Buzi was someone personally granted a cultivation art by the Immortal Lord. How could Dangjiang dare to harm him? He immediately laughed.

"Still posturing! Looking at those robes, you're just a minor official up here in the heavens!"

This hit the nail on the head. Dangjiang’s breath hitched. He snapped, "One official in the heavens is a hundred times more impressive than a Daoist Master on earth!"

Chi Buzi understood immediately.

'This idiot is having a *really* bad time in whatever heaven this is.'

Chi Buzi naturally assumed this "heaven" was a Grotto-Heaven, just like Anhuai Heaven or Pristine Speech Heaven—the personal domain of the mighty Immortal Lord. And this "Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin" was just that Immortal Lord's immortal sect or bureau. Having figured out the other's situation in just a few words, he glanced silently toward the courtyard gate, suspicion rising in his heart.

'Why don't I see anyone else... In the Immortal Lord's Grotto-Heaven... the only person I'm dealing with is Dangjiang?'

Aloud, he declared, "Enough nonsense. I am conducting this ritual array according to the Immortal Lord's decree. What right do you have to intercept me?"

This shout terrified Dangjiang. He quickly grabbed Chi Buzi's sleeve and hissed, "What are you yelling about! His lordship granted you a summoning array, and now you think you're really somebody? Outside this gate, it's nothing but immortal officials and celestial generals! If you stir up trouble, I can't protect you!"

Chi Buzi narrowed his eyes slightly, instantly shifting his attitude to align with Dangjiang's. He whispered back, "I'm not familiar with this Grotto-Heaven... From now on, are you the one who will receive me? I managed to acquire a Purple Mansion demon beast. It *is* Purple Mansion level, so it must count as a significant contribution even in a Grotto-Heaven. This benefits both of us. You have to ensure my contribution is reported properly. If you steal my credit, or can't protect it, what's left for us to discuss in the future?"

Dangjiang knew he was smart, but he hadn't expected him to think through so many angles so quickly. He was momentarily stumped.

"According to the feedback from the token, your contribution is indeed recorded. I still have to go to the main hall to report your merit. Do you have any requests for a reward?"

Chi Buzi's eyes lit up immediately. "Yes... yes! It's that immortal-rank inheritance you carried on you all those years ago... do you remember? My Chou-Gui Hidden Form... I only managed to forge that using your item! I only ask for that thing, nothing else!"

Dangjiang didn't know if that item was even available. He frowned. "That thing was also granted by the heavens, and it was related to the Purple Mansion realm to begin with... I have connections in the heavens. I know a high-ranking official in a revered lord's palace. It won't hurt to ask."

"But... I vaguely recall... back then, you had the Foundation Establishment art and the spiritual qi for the Chou-Gui Hidden Form, and you built your immortal foundation. But you didn't have the Purple Mansion chapter. You didn't break through to a divine ability. You relied on sensing that treasure to make the breakthrough..."

As he spoke, Chi Buzi also frowned, clearly realizing the discrepancy. Dangjiang continued:

"But now you are supposed to cultivate 'Purging Dew.' You don't even have the immortal foundation for it. This situation is not the same as before. What if the treasure is wasted... you won't even have a place to cry..."

"True..."

Chi Buzi frowned. Back when he received the cultivation art, he only knew it might restore his path. He knew nothing else. Arriving here was completely unexpected; how could he have thought this far ahead? Now understanding the situation, he reacted instantly.

'That's right. The Purging Dew art is nowhere to be found. Furthermore, Taiqing does *not* want to see me break through... If I don't cultivate the Purging Dew, it's fine. But the moment my fifth divine ability becomes Purging Dew, if I fail to break through again before Taiqing returns... I'll die without a complete corpse.'

He fell silent. Dangjiang whispered, "Why not ask for something else? I manage the cultivation arts. The heavens certainly don't lack spiritual qi. I can first request the Purple Mansion cultivation art and the spiritual qi for Purging Dew. You can cultivate it yourself."

Chi Buzi's mindset had already changed. He shook his head. "No. Even if I got it, I wouldn't dare cultivate it. It's useless."

Although he knew the man before him loved to boast, Chi Buzi could only grit his teeth and reply, "Don't you have connections in the heavens? Ask for me... You understand my strength and my methods. If I successfully cultivate to the Golden Core realm outside the Grotto-Heaven, it would be an excellent outcome for you too. Even if I were just recommended to enter the Grotto-Heaven, it would benefit you greatly."

Dangjiang nodded silently. No matter how luxurious the heavens were, a Golden Core True Monarch still commanded respect. If one visited the heavens on a normal day, even just inviting a celestial general or a minor deity for tea, they would have to give face... He was tempted. "That person *is* a powerful figure. He'll only humor me because he knows me. He can ask for you..."

Chi Buzi nodded, half-convinced, and asked, "But how do I return? And after I go back, how do I see you again? I can't just go hunting a Purple Mansion demon every single time, can I? I'm not a Golden Core True Monarch."

Dangjiang shook his head. "Just jump into the pool and you'll return. I've already recorded your contribution with the token. In the future, if you need to reach this place, just activate the array with your divine ability. You'll be able to arrive with your spiritual sense. You just won't be able to enter with your true body like today; it will only be for transmitting messages."

"That's fine."

Chi Buzi sighed, seemingly ready to leave. He took a step toward the pool's edge. He placed one hand on the white jade lamp pedestal by the pool, feeling its solid, real texture. Then, he touched his storage bag, only to find that it wouldn't open.

The young man’s expression suddenly relaxed. His previously brisk pace halted. He turned his head.

"Can I see the scenery outside?"

Dangjiang didn't detect anything wrong. He just sneered, "I'm afraid it would scare you to death!"

He led him to the courtyard gate and pushed it open slightly. Chi Buzi saw a street covered in cold snow, lit by bright moon lanterns. The emblem of the golden osmanthus and crescent moon was everywhere. He could see white-robed cultivators flying through the sky. Further in the distance, the faint outlines of golden palaces and pavilions hung in the air, along with celestial-spanning white jade bridges.

Chi Buzi squinted, observing, but ultimately did not dare to step out. He just turned back around.

'I can't get out... and there's nothing in this courtyard I can take.'

The young man's green eyes carefully scanned the entire area. He smiled. "Daoist Friend Dangjiang, those robes of yours are quite magnificent. Why not gift me one?"

Dangjiang looked at him strangely. "Are you insane? Is this something you are qualified to take?"

Chi Buzi just smiled without replying. He took a step, glancing at the white jade moon-lantern pedestal. The lantern was sealed shut; he couldn't see what was inside. The jade bricks beneath his feet were perfectly fitted, with no debris between them.

He put on a sincere smile and said with great formality, "Daoist Friend Dangjiang, I am a mortal man and do not recognize the treasures of the heavens. I wonder if I might take one small item as a souvenir? I can look at it and admire it in my daily life, and it will remind me that I truly once visited the Grotto-Heaven."

Hearing this, Dangjiang felt his pride swell. He laughed heartily and nodded repeatedly.

"But of course! That is perfectly fine!"



# Chapter 755: Shaohui

Dangjiang agreed readily. He felt his sleeves—they were completely empty. Broke as he was, his heart began to pound, but he wouldn't lose face.

"However, the rules in the heavens are extremely strict," he said with a practiced smile. "I cannot simply bring personal items with me to this palace. Fortunately, nothing here is mundane. Wait just a moment."

He walked quickly to the courtyard gate and pushed it open. Two attendants were standing just outside. They were beautiful, both clad in rainbow-like celestial garments. Though their clothes drifted like clouds, they bore no embroidery. One held a white-rimmed, green jade pipa, while the other carried a flower basket piled high with glittering qiong grass.

Dangjiang glanced at the basket. "What spirit grass is this?"

The attendant replied, "Reporting to my lord: Today the Dipper points to the Station of Virtuous Report, Yin crosses the Earthly plane, and the Time Ruler commands: Supreme Yang gathers the Radiant and Plunders Profound Flowers; Supreme Yin clips the Golden Branches of the Moon Laurel. The pivots move as normal, and the Twelve Qi are drawn from the celestial phenomena."

"Moon Laurel Golden Branches."

Dangjiang nodded and said, "May I have a branch?"

The attendant immediately retrieved a white laurel branch. Tiny white blossoms dotted the twig, and the cut end was golden-yellow, revealing spiraling, concentric rings that radiated a subtle chill.

Dangjiang hadn't actually been sure it would work. Seeing her comply so easily, he relaxed inwardly. He took the branch and turned back, only to see Chi Buzi thoughtfully savoring the words he had overheard:

"Supreme Yang gathers the Radiant and Plunders Profound Flowers, Supreme Yin clips the Golden Branches of the Moon Laurel..."

Dangjiang lifted his chin, his voice swelling with pride. "Daoist Master Chi, guard this well! A single Moon Laurel branch from the heavens is an extraordinary treasure down in the mortal world!"

Chi Buzi offered a sincere word of thanks. He took the spirit item, tucked it into his sleeve, and nodded slightly. "Then I shall depart. From now on, I will draw the array annually to contact you. If you find out anything about my path to Golden Core, please send word."

Dangjiang seemed reluctant to see him go. "How about once every three months? I could use the extra trips... at least it's something to do... And you can report to me about happenings in the lower realm."

Chi Buzi still wasn't used to the term "lower realm." He frowned. "Just focus on your work and don't get reprimanded. If that happens, I'll have nowhere to report my contributions..."

Dangjiang could only nod. He suddenly remembered something and said urgently, "I just recalled! There is an immortal official in the heavens, surname Li, who went to the lower realm to reincarnate for his cultivation. If you chance upon him, and if he still remembers his life in the heavens, please ask him something for me. Ask him when he is returning... I cannot take this job for one more day!"

Chi Buzi frowned, committing this to memory. "What exactly is this job of yours?"

"Organizing techniques and correcting Dao lineages," Dangjiang replied, his face a mask of misery.

Chi Buzi’s expression instantly turned bizarre. He stared at Dangjiang, his voice laced with the sound of grinding teeth.

Back in the day, Chi Buzi would have practically lived in the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, refusing to waste a single step outside its doors. Now, this was the library of an Immortal Lord's Grotto-Heaven, a place countless Purple Mansion cultivators would shatter their skulls trying to enter! Looking at Dangjiang’s miserable face, he could only curse:

"You worthless fool! Blessed with fortune and you don't even know it..."

He flicked his sleeve angrily, stepped into the pool, and his form dissolved like water.

Dangjiang trudged out of the courtyard, his face still long. The moment he pushed the gate open, the attendant stepped forward and bowed respectfully.

"Reporting to the Immortal Official: That Golden branch of the Moon Laurel has already been recorded under the Immortal Official's name. If the remainder is not required, this basket must be presented to the bureau for logging."

"Ah?"

Dangjiang froze. The words struck him like thunder, and his heart sank. Regret washed over him.

'Damn it... This stuff isn't free?!'

He had put on such a brave face for his guest, but now he regretted it to his very core. Dangjiang had only just attained the rank of immortal official. He had used what little merit he had earned to exchange for his attendants; he had no savings left. A chill shot through him.

"This item... how is it calculated... Why was it delivered here...?"

The attendant replied, "The products of the various domains and palaces are always delivered to the different halls. This was established by Immortal Official Liu some time ago. They are kept in regular supply in the courtyards for convenient access."

"Aiya... That dog Chi Buzi has ruined me!"

Dangjiang's face went pale with anguish. He immediately asked, "This item... can it be charged to that Chi Buzi's name? He was the one who took it... it has nothing to do with me!"

The attendant just lowered her gaze. "It was the lord who gave it away. Heaven and Earth witnessed it."

...

The Sea's Cape.

The depths of the ocean were utterly dark. Cold, icy currents flowed beneath the reefs. Spiritual energy here was almost nonexistent; a Purple Mansion cultivator would find no path forward here and would have to revert to flying through the physical world.

Deep within the Cape, the terrain rose, and the seawater cascaded into an endless abyss below, rising back up as mist. This place was extremely close to the beyond, yet cut off from the Great Void. There was no more hidden place between heaven and earth.

Inside a dark karst cave, bright white array patterns glowed faintly. Chi Buzi's vision slowly faded from the brilliance of the heaven back to the gloom. He scanned his surroundings, confirming he was indeed back in the secret cave he had formed using the *Heavy Murk* earth-escape art.

He let out a breath and felt his sleeve. He reached in, turned his palm upward, and a snow-white laurel branch lay in his hand. It emitted a hazy white halo, and the cut section of the stem glowed with golden patterns. It was clearly a treasure of the highest quality.

The young man's gaze lingered on the laurel branch for a long time. The cave began to fill with the chill of the Supreme Yin. He retrieved a jade box from his storage bag and placed the branch inside.

"It truly is a supreme treasure of the Supreme Yin lineage... Items from that place can be brought out... But... I wonder why I couldn't open my storage bag."

Chi Buzi held the jade box, looking down quietly, his mind racing. After a moment, his thoughts settled.

"This spirit item alone, in the current world, is worth no less than that demon beast. If that's the case... the *Ritual of the Celestial Seal and Profound Clarity* is indeed a way to contact a Grotto-Heaven... But the offering... must it be a demon beast?"

Chi Buzi’s expression grew contemplative, and understanding dawned.

"Counting every Purple Mansion demon beast in the Eastern Sea, there are few that aren't related to dragon-kind. I certainly can't kill them... But demons... spirit beasts also count as demons... Those Maha of the several northern Ways love to collect spirit beasts. Not only do they have demons who become Merciful Ones, but those long-cultivated Merciful Ones love to merge their lifeforce with their attendant spirit beasts, making the beast equivalent to a Purple Mansion life-pact... Aren't there far more of those than demon beasts?"

The more he thought, the brighter his eyes became.

'Yes, yes, good. Although a Merciful One is hard to kill, there are far more of them, and they are easier to deal with than a true Purple Mansion demon. Their backing is only a Maha. I wonder if they'll count as a full contribution? If not, even half a contribution would be good...'

He couldn't think of a more suitable offering than a Merciful One. A realization struck him:

'It seems this personage also looks down on the Northern Buddhists...'

He paused, sat cross-legged in the cave, and began to admire the Moon Laurel Golden Branch in the jade box. The grade of this spirit item was even higher than Supreme Yin Moonlight Essence; it was utterly rare in the world. Merely placing it before him caused Supreme Yin Qi to emanate.

The young man stared quietly at the clusters of white flowers on the branch, the ambition in his eyes startling. He propped his chin on his other hand, his voice growing softer, his cadence like the chanting of scripture:

"All Fruition Attainments of Yin revere the Supreme Yin, while the Supreme Yang is the first manifestation of the day, which all Yangs follow... The Supreme Yin's Profound Splendor falls upon the waters of Bing-Zi... guiding both the Pristine and the Converging..."

...

The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity.

White snow piled beneath the bright moon lamp pedestals. Lu Jiangxian sat at the table as the various illusions before him slowly faded.

"Chi Buzi... he really is something."

Currently, Lu Jiangxian naturally lacked the ability to pull people into the Immortal Mirror's world and have them take things back out. When Chi Buzi used the array to connect to the Immortal Mirror, his situation was effectively no different from that of Maha Jinlian or Five-Eyes; he was trapped in an illusion.

But the difference was that Chi Buzi had arrived as an intentional visitor, not someone kneeling in terror. He was able to move freely! He could even pick things up and put them down. If Chi Buzi had tried to take something from his storage bag, Lu Jiangxian wasn't incapable of making it manifest... but what then?

'Chi Buzi is cunning. I can't control his storage bag. Even if I manifested the item, the moment he gave it to Dangjiang or set it down, he would just feel his storage bag upon returning, find the item still there, and instantly know the trick.'

The Immortal Mirror did not yet have the ability to move physical objects in and out. This was a fatal flaw. Therefore, Lu Jiangxian had locked his storage bag from the start. But merely by Dangjiang mentioning it, Chi Buzi had still grown suspicious, wondering if the place was an illusion since he couldn't retrieve things. This is why he insisted on taking a souvenir. The moment he left, a simple touch of his sleeve would tell him if it was real or fake.

Lu Jiangxian could certainly have arranged for Dangjiang to stonewall him with various regulations, preventing him from taking anything. But Chi Buzi was not easily fooled. The entire point of letting him "arrive in true body" this time was to dispel the lingering doubts from the previous, dream-like illusion. Using the same trick twice on a Purple Mansion cultivator of his caliber would guarantee deep suspicion.

Thus, he specifically allowed Chi Buzi to 'take' a Supreme Yin spirit item back with him. This item was the only thing Lu Jiangxian could currently condense in the physical world. It was just enough to plug the hole in the illusion.

"But this method only works this one time. I managed to acquire the offering for free, using this extremely precious Supreme Yin spirit item to placate him. But... after this, he can forget about getting any response for future Purple Mansion demon offerings!"

He had only managed to pull this off thanks to having Dangjiang on hand. Dangjiang could drop the formalities with Chi Buzi, analyze the pros and cons, and talk frankly. If Lu Jiangxian had conjured a fake persona to handle it, Chi Buzi never would have spoken so deeply... and he never would have achieved the current effect.

"This, however, presents a new problem. Chi Buzi is sharp. Although he won't ask for cultivation arts again, his focus has shifted to the Golden Core path. If I can't provide sufficient guidance, it will inevitably stir up trouble."

Chi Buzi was a double-edged sword. He was incredibly useful, understood how to read situations, acted with caution, and possessed supreme strength—in Jiangnan, he was second only to Qiushui and Yuanxiu. His death would also be a major problem. For now, Lu Jiangxian still needed him.

That was a problem for later. Lu Jiangxian looked up. A large, blue-and-white-feathered bird was lying on the jade bricks by his feet. It was the size of a writing desk, its pale, gauze-like tail feathers spread in a circle on the ground.

This Lesser Yin demon beast was different from all the demons sacrificed previously. The Li family sacrifice used incense fire as a base, slaying the demon with the ritual blade and sending its soul, blood essence, and immortal foundation flying into the Mirror as a single, mixed lump.

This demon, however, had been sacrificed individually. It had bypassed the incense-fire refining part of the sacrificial rite. Its immortal foundation, blood essence, divine-ability body, and even the Shengyang Mansion within the Great Void had all been sacrificed whole and unharmed.

Even better, the soul of a Purple Mansion cultivator resides in their Shengyang Mansion; upon death, it leaves the body but is not extinguished. Thus, the spirit sparrow's soul was able to fly into the Mirror. It was right here, still possessing consciousness. In a sense, this demon was the first *living being* to ever enter the Mirror!

Lu Jiangxian’s gaze was fervent. This was new labor, on par with Dangjiang!

He lifted the soul and scanned it, quickly understanding its history.

'This demon was born in the Northern Sea. Its bloodline was average, but it struck fortune, ate a treasure medicine, and entered the path of cultivation. For the first two hundred years, it ate everything, raising several tribes for food. Gradually, it attained enlightenment in the northern deserts.'

'After gaining intelligence, it read a few books and realized humanity was dominant. It promptly transformed, becoming a protector spirit beast for a tribe, taking the tribe's name as its own, calling itself Fuyu.'

"By the time this demon emerged from seclusion after breaking through to Foundation Establishment, the Fuyu kingdom had long since been conquered. It emerged into territory belonging to the Lou family. It could only wander, yet it managed to acquire quite a few opportunities."

"Its talent for techniques is extremely high. It researched many techniques on its own, and by currying favor with the Luan-birds, it managed to visit Mount Taishi and successfully attained Purple Mansion..."

Lu Jiangxian looked closely. In its several fights with Chi Buzi, most of the techniques the demon used were its own creations. Unfortunately, a demon's Immortal foundation is rarely comparable to a human's. Although its talent for techniques was high, it hadn't read as many Daoist lineages as Chi Buzi, and it had only just broken through to Purple Mansion. Thus, it was no match.

He searched through its memories, finding them sparse. Looking closer, he confirmed someone *had* tampered with its mind. All memories concerning the Luan-birds were gone, and it had even actively forgotten events involving Golden Core matters from centuries ago. Stripped of this complex history, all that remained were a few cultivation arts it had acquired by chance.

It really did look like it had no background, which explained why it fell into Chi Buzi's hands. Lu Jiangxian reviewed it one more time, frowning as understanding settled in.

"This is good... very good... but if I use this soul here, the Azure Talisman side will be short one Purple Mansion soul. The incense fire is currently sufficient, but using this will leave the Azure Talisman lacking."

He thought for a moment and relaxed.

"However, there are still five years until the next sacrifice, and Li Zhouwei is also in seclusion. There is plenty of time. I will wait and see... After all, this creature's talent for techniques is extremely high. Adding such a person to my Mirror is an enormous boon."

He lifted his sleeve, and a bright Supreme Yin radiance appeared in his hand. He picked up the jade pot from the table and flicked a finger.

The spirit sparrow on the ground instantly dissolved into a sky of Lesser Yin splendor, which drilled into the pot. In an instant, the pot was filled to the brim with a blue-white, starry, ocean-like divine ability. Opening the lid revealed a small mansion floating within that ocean—the spirit sparrow’s Shengyang Mansion.

A faint, illusory shadow remained on the ground: the demon's soul. Lu Jiangxian flicked his sleeve again, and the soul immediately attached itself to a descending beam of celestial light, glowing brilliantly.

The Mirror was the seat of Lu Jiangxian's own divine abilities. He infused the soul with a wisp of Lesser Yin, condensing it into the form of a woman in tea-white celestial robes. She was petite, yet possessed a clear, otherworldly aura. She held a pipa, and a stark white circular sigil adorned her brow. Her bearing was extraordinary.

The woman blinked, seemingly confused as to why she was here. As her soul’s memories merged, she looked up in a daze. When she saw the person seated above her, the confusion and blankness in her eyes were instantly replaced by terror and awe. She knelt and bowed, her voice soft:

"Lesser Yin Wu-Gui Celestial Attendant, Shaohui, pays respects to the Palace Lord!"



# Chapter 756: The Opening

"Shaohui."

Lu Jiangxian studied the Lesser Yin attendant he had manifested. Although the bird demon Fuyu's memories had been washed away, her core Dao lineage of Lesser Yin remained within the celestial attendant's new memory. Her celestial title and even her name were details she had supplied herself based on that inherent lineage, and they certainly sounded appropriate to the Lesser Yin path.

Only her tea-white robes set her apart from the original demon, looking far more dignified. The pipa in her hand was also a treasure, one that would rival any ancient spirit artifact in the outside world. Lu Jiangxian could create as many as he wished, purely according to his preference.

He looked at the celestial attendant, the second true living being within his Mirror. The stone sprites and celestial soldiers he had shaped previously possessed only basic instincts and acted only on orders. While they filled the celestial court and made it look bustling, they were really just extremely advanced puppets.

'The affair with Chi Buzi was a matter of putting out a fire, but I never expected to follow through with it this far. It may not be a bad thing. In the future, whether exploring ancient secrets or recruiting subordinates, I will need to manifest a background sufficiently convincing and impressive to support both the reception rites and the sacrificial arts.'

'Slowly filling this place... it might have greater uses in the future. And at least I won't have to endure the silence in the Mirror alone.'

Seeing the white-robed attendant bowing respectfully in the court, Lu Jiangxian said softly, "The Lesser Yin path has not yet returned to its station or opened its palace. A turn of fate and opportunity allowed you to return to your celestial station early. For now, report to Zhengao, receive your duties, and temporarily follow the orders of the Supreme Yin Palace."

Shaohui bowed deeply. Although the personage above her was not her direct superior, he was clearly among the foremost of the Palace Lords. She naturally obeyed with reverence, clutching her pipa as she withdrew.

She exited the grand hall, descending the white jade steps shrouded in ethereal mist. The immortal officials on both sides bowed their heads in greeting. Although Shaohui was a Lesser Yin attendant, many here were from the Supreme Yin Palace. She nodded, dismissing them, and proceeded by familiar paths to a high platform engraved with bright moon patterns.

The platform was beautiful and pristine, dusted with falling frost-like snow and encircled by flowing spirit water. Several imposing celestial soldiers guarded the banks. She stepped onto the path toward the platform and saw, just as expected, a handsome celestial general reading a book.

"Daoist Friend Zhengao!" Shaohui called out respectfully.

The handsome man looked up, slightly surprised, and replied, "Long time no see! Has the Daoist Friend returned from reincarnation? Congratulations, congratulations!"

Although Shaohui’s celestial rank was equal to his, she was, firstly, not his equal in the sharpness of her celestial sword or the power she wielded, and secondly, she was essentially a guest in another’s palace. She spoke graciously:

"It was not a return through cultivation, but an early arrival. My memories are unclear. It must be due to a shift in the Lesser Yin Wu-Gui path. My own Palace Lord has not returned to his station, so I know even less."

Zhengao nodded, his armor exuding an icy chill. "The Lesser Yin path has not recovered. It seems the Revered One wishes you to serve the Supreme Yin Palace for now."

"Your insight is like a torch. I am here to receive my orders." Shaohui's personality was not reserved, and she smiled brightly.

Zhengao consulted a scroll on his desk and nodded. "You are of the Lesser Yin station, after all. It would be awkward for you in the Supreme Yin Palace. I will not make things difficult. I will select a small tower for you at the edge of the heavens. Your duty will be to revise the Lesser Yin lineages and manage the nearby immortal officials."

Shaohui smiled gratefully and thanked him repeatedly.

"There aren't really any immortal officials nearby to manage," Zhengao clarified. "It's just a nominal position. There is only one minor deity who was promoted from below. You just need to hand off some work to him."

He paused, then added with a hint of exasperation, "The fellow is a silver-tongued chatterbox. Right now, he's sitting in the East Third Prefecture, agonizing over the cost of three branches and two leaves. You might as well retrieve him on your way. It will serve as an introduction."

Shaohui was quite satisfied with this. If she had been assigned actual Supreme Yin officials, their conflicting stations would have made managing them difficult. A promotion from the world below came with no such concerns. She accepted the token and thanked him again.

"Many thanks, Daoist Friend! In the past, I only heard of your great reputation, but I never knew you were so amicable."

Zhengao pulled a jade box from his desk and smiled. "Don't thank me yet. This box is full of Lesser Yin techniques and cultivation arts. They need you to revise them."

Shaohui readily agreed.

"Only one thing," Zhengao added. "The Heavenly Gate is not open, so you cannot come and go freely. If you travel to the outer heavens, you must return via my Supreme Yin Palace and receive clearance to enter."

She smiled. "The Lesser Yin Palace isn't even open, so I have no desire to wander about. Spending my days in a pavilion reading and writing, increasing my Daoist cultivation, rather than wasting time outside... this is exactly what I would have wished for."

Shaohui was nothing like the flighty Dangjiang. Having settled her affairs, she left the high platform to find him.

She descended to the designated area and, sure enough, saw a young man standing near an attendant, anxiously inquiring about something. When the attendant saw Shaohui descend, she immediately bowed in fearful reverence, not daring to make a sound.

Dangjiang, having reported his merit, had returned to ask about the price of the Moon Laurel Golden Branch. Seeing the attendant drop to the ground, quieter than the dead, he felt a jolt of alarm. He looked up and saw a celestial attendant in tea-white robes holding a pipa. Her features were still youthful, but judging by her garments, her status was extremely high.

Dangjiang instantly knew he had run into a major figure and hurried to bow with the attendant. "This lowly official pays his respects to the Celestial Lady!"

He was an absolute wreck. Bowing on the ground felt humiliating.

He had casually given away a celestial treasure, and while this was within Lu Jiangxian’s calculations, if the fellow wasn't taught a lesson, the first time would lead to a second. If he started grabbing random things to send down—items that were *not* Supreme Yin spirit matter—Lu Jiangxian wouldn't be able to manifest them!

Now, Dangjiang was penniless. He had carelessly gifted the spirit item, and the heavens did not offer credit. As soon as the attendant had reported back to the palace, someone had immediately come looking for him. Dangjiang hadn't even warmed the seat of his new post, and now he was facing dismissal. How could he remain calm?

In her mortal life, Shaohui had been a playful bird demon. Her memories were washed, but her personality remained. She immediately asked, "What is all the noise about? Let me hear it."

Dangjiang quickly recounted the entire affair.

Shaohui laughed. "The Moon Laurel Golden Branch? You really know how to pick them. There are only a few days in the entire year when the Supreme Yin and Lesser Yin treasures are at their most valuable, and you managed to pick one."

Dangjiang grew even more embarrassed.

Then Shaohui said, "Immortal Official Liu is away. From now on, I am your superior. I can't just watch you wringing your hands. Put it on my account for now. When you have the savings, you can pay me back."

Dangjiang froze, stunned, then overcome with gratitude. He kowtowed. "Thank you, my lady! Thank you! May I know my lady's esteemed name?"

Shaohui smiled. "I am not from your Supreme Yin Palace. I hold the Lesser Yin Wu-Gui station. My Daoist name is Shaohui."

Only then did he realize she was a figure on the same level as Zhengao. He scrambled to his feet, still miserable.

'That dog Chi Buzi... hurry up and kill some more Purple Mansion demons! I need a cut of that light! If this keeps up... how many cultivation manuals will I have to write to pay this debt?!'

Dangjiang fell silent, following obediently behind the celestial attendant in tea-white robes. Crushing anxiety and awe for his superior kept his mouth shut for once. His surroundings blurred, and in the next moment, he was dropped back into his own courtyard.

His heart still ached.

'I'm going to pester him in a few months! Definitely!'

...

Moongaze Lake.

White blossoms drifted down from Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The Daoist Master in white and gold robes sat at his table, dense white light flowing like water across the ground, brushing past several jade pillars and pulsing with halos of light.

Li Ximing cultivated quietly. More than half a year passed like flowing water. His cultivation had advanced slightly, and his divine ability had condensed further. His cultivation talent was, after all, quite good; his efforts were not wasted.

The heavenly light was bright, a perfect time for cultivation, yet he suddenly opened his eyes. He took one step forward, manifesting over Moongaze Lake and gazing toward the east.

Over Shanji Prefecture, an ink-like purple qi was gathering, staining the entire sky a gloomy shade. With his Purple Mansion-level sight, he could even see streaks of light rising rapidly at the horizon, speeding toward Moongaze Lake.

'Yehui has made his move.'

Sure enough, a streak of light shot up urgently from below. Li Jiangqian stopped before him, his expression grave. He bowed. "Reporting to the Daoist Master: Daoist Master Yehui has appeared at the Profound Peak mountain gate in Shanji Prefecture. He is suppressing the grand array with his divine ability. The entire eastern bank is in turmoil, and messengers have arrived from several territories."

Li Cheng arrived a step behind, riding lightning with several others, his expression equally heavy.

Compared to the anxiety and tension of the others at the lake, Li Ximing was perfectly calm. "Were the personnel inside the mountain gate evacuated long ago?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master: As ordered, they were all withdrawn six months ago. Only a few Profound Peak elders remained, refusing to leave."

Li Ximing had not shared the details of the Xuanmiao Temple affair with his family. Firstly, neither Li Minggong nor Li Chenghui possessed a Talisman Seed; hearing such secrets would only become a liability. Secondly, the matter didn't require much participation from his family cultivators. Some things were calculations left to the Purple Mansion realm, and Li Ximing felt it best to carry the burden alone. If something went wrong later, at least it wouldn't make things too difficult for the Li family.

The horizon was already pulsing with the deep purple brilliance of a divine ability. Li Ximing remained unhurried. The Hundred Mountains Concealed Storage Spirit Array of the Profound Peak Gate was not something Yehui could break in a moment, and the Profound Peak cultivators no longer had the ability to open it anyway.

He only asked, "What of Profound Peak's spiritual resources and supplies?"

Li Jiangqian answered respectfully, "Over the past half-year, Kong Guxi moved three mountains' worth of assets to the wilderness. He only stopped when the earth meridians in that part of the wilderness could no longer bear any more relocation. Most of the treasury has been moved, and the entire inheritance of techniques was transferred. Most of what could be moved was moved. The majority of low-grade supplies required the grand array to remain sealed, and the wilderness is ill-equipped, so they were not moved."

"Good."

Li Ximing understood. The Li family did not lack those spirit grains and herbs. Leaving them at Profound Peak also aligned with the story about the spirit items. As for the losses from the rest of the treasury, they were acceptable. He gave the order:

"Withdraw all personnel from Shanji Prefecture."

The moment the words fell, his figure vanished from the lake. He crossed the Great Void, instantly manifesting over Shanji Prefecture.

Black-purple qi roiled across the prefecture, shrouding the entire region in darkness. Below, Capital immortals Dao disciples surrounded the mountain base. The mountain range, the life's work of Daoist Master Changxi, was protected by a pale-yellow shield of light. The shield brightened, only to be immediately suppressed by the overwhelming dark purple divine ability.

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

Pressed down upon the Profound Peak gate was another, separate mountain peak condensed of pure white qi, soaring into the clouds. It presented a majestic, magnificent posture amidst the swirling darkness. A few fleeing Profound Peak disciples scrambled like ants through the black qi.

He stepped forward, appearing closer. Half the sky above the mountain gate abruptly brightened as radiant clouds surged, pushing back the black qi, drawing a clear line between them. Those disciples, as if seeing a life-saving rope, fled into the heavenly light.

The Capital immortals Dao cultivators behind them, who had been toying with them like cats with mice, immediately wiped the sneers from their faces, turned, and fled. The few who had been leading the chase respectfully called out "Daoist Master" before bowing and retreating.

Li Ximing didn't spare them a glance. He stood alone, facing the behemoth manifestation of the Eastern Feather Mountain and the assembled Capital immortals Dao cultivators in the sky, yet his aura lost nothing. Heavenly light illuminated the sky, claiming half of it.

No matter how many Capital immortals Dao cultivators were present, at this moment, the field belonged only to Yehui and Li Ximing. As disciples of famous sects, how could they not understand this? Every one of them was silent as cicadas in winter, not daring to speak.

Li Ximing looked at Yehui, who stood atop his divine ability, the Eastern Feather Mountain. The Bright Yang Purple Flames rose gently behind him.

"Senior Changxi has only just fallen, and already Daoist Friend rushes to swallow Profound Peak. This is overly hasty. Have you asked Senior Sumian about this?"

From above, Yehui laughed. "Daoist Friend misunderstands. I am acquainted with a demonic disciple hidden in these mountains and have come only to eliminate the threat. If I bore any ill will toward the Profound Peak lineage, would it not be easier to go directly to the wilderness? I am not here for the mountain gate. Once the search is complete, I will naturally withdraw."

'A fine excuse...'

Li Ximing knew exactly what was happening, but he hadn't expected Yehui to turn the plot back on him, assuming such a mask of righteousness. He sighed.

"Daoist Friend is merely here to eliminate a future threat. There is no need for such accusations. I shall accept your challenge!"

"Please!"

Yehui's tone held little anger. The two spoke as calmly as friends catching up. The moment the word fell, both men vanished with their divine abilities, disappearing into the Great Void.

The vast purple qi and radiant clouds that had split the sky instantly vanished. The towering white mountain peak dissipated like smoke. A clear, bright sky returned, causing the trembling, terrified mortals of Shanji Prefecture to kowtow.

It had all happened too fast. All that remained was an empty sky, where only the Capital immortals Dao cultivators hovered on the wind. Their leader, clad in black Daoist robes with a silk belt and silver trim, was high-browed and deep-eyed: the Capital immortals Dao Head Disciple, Guan Gongxiao.

His eyelid twitched. He was clearly just as stunned as everyone else. He stood silently before the massive Purple Mansion array. The cultivators on either side looked to him. Guan Gongxiao knew what they were thinking. He, too, was staring blankly at the array.

'They left us? To attack a Purple Mansion Grand Array?'

Yehui and Li Ximing had blithely flown off into the Great Void to fight, apparently giving no thought to the fact that their disciples had come here to attack a mountain. What could a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators possibly do to a Purple Mansion Grand Array? No matter how weak the Profound Peak array was at offense, if it counter-attacked, few here would dare to receive the blow!

Guan Gongxiao could almost picture Li Zhouwei bursting from the array with a contingent of troops and slaughtering them. He nearly lost his composure but forced himself to state flatly:

"Maintain the perimeter and drain the array! The Daoist Master has a plan!"

He said this aloud, but Yehui always acted on whims. He had brought them here the moment he emerged from seclusion. Not only did Guan Gongxiao know nothing of the plan, but he also had no tools for breaking the array.

'How can one guess the thoughts of a Daoist Master... What is the point of us staying here? Aren't we just revealing our weakness? Surely this grand array isn't just going to unlock its seals and collapse on its own while they fight?'



# Chapter 757: One Glyph, One Register

Li Ximing traversed the Great Void. Gloomy, purple-black vapor hung heavy in the air as he raced forward. Ahead, the massive peak of condensed white qi materialized once more. Yehui was perched atop the same scaled, bird-like beast, its massive beak a glaring gold, its pupils a milky white.

From the beast's back, Yehui glanced at Li Ximing, divine power gathering in his hands.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing," he began, "your willingness to take that step back, abandon the Profound Peak mountain gate, and sacrifice Kong Haiying proves you are truly a reasonable man. Yehui acknowledges this favor, and I thank you for it."

Li Ximing watched him, his gaze heavy. The smile on the man's face was polite. When facing Li Ximing, Yehui never resorted to the cold mockery or scathing ridicule he had used against Changxi. Even now, initiating a battle of divine abilities, he maintained an air of civility.

His attitude projected a distinct detachment—whatever the subordinates below did was their own affair. Your chariot takes my cannon; I checkmate your general. It was merely moves on a chessboard. To hold a grudge over it only proved one lacked magnanimity.

It was this attitude, combined with Li Ximing's own caution, that had preserved a sliver of diplomatic room between their two factions at the Purple Mansion level. Now, isolated in the Great Void, Yehui was actually offering thanks.

Li Ximing could only reply, "What is Daoist Friend saying? Since you intended to move on the Profound Peak mountain gate, I was bound to intervene."

Yehui gave him a deep look, seeming to weigh his options. "Then very well," he replied. "Today, I shall properly test the might of your Bright Yang divine ability."

The instant his voice fell, a violent fluctuation tore through the Great Void.

A vast deluge of purple water descended, filled with leaping, human-headed fish. The peak of white qi surged again, its snowy summit piercing the gloom.

Radiance immediately erupted from Li Ximing's back. Dazzling celestial light surged upward, staining the void as the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' manifested once more. The intricate, bright-white celestial gate rose from the void, dragon banners and luan chariots passing through it, jeweled standards and ceremonial parasols fluttering in an unseen wind as figures in golden armor and robes appeared.

A cacophony of war cries erupted. Golden-armored soldiers charged forth from the gate while the human-headed fish swam through the purple water. As the brilliance of their divine abilities clashed, the white mountain peak slammed down, pressing heavily onto the Celestial Gate. Li Ximing felt the pressure instantly double, his own divine ability shuddering violently.

The human-headed fish, unlike their previous encounter where they scattered on impact, now stubbornly blocked the charge of the golden-armored soldiers, forcing them back inch by inch. The white qi mountain peak was no longer static; it began to swell, inflating as if breathing.

Previously, Yehui had been cautious, uncertain of his opponent's capabilities. Now, having committed to the duel, he unleashed his power without reservation. The purple tide swelled, the colors growing several times richer, forcing Li Ximing's celestial light into a desperate, three-zhang sphere, unable to advance another inch.

Only now did Li Ximing realize that Yehui had been toying with him before. This was his true strength. His own cultivation gains over the past two years had produced negligible improvements to the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate,' and he was rapidly forced onto the defensive. He had no choice but to ignite the celestial light at his brow, pushing his divine ability to its limit just to resist the 'Sorrowful Southern Water.'

Yet, the purple tide parted, revealing Yehui floating within. The Daoist Master wore deep blue robes, his features compact, and he cradled the same softly glowing sword. Behind him, however, a pair of treasures had appeared.

To his left floated a flat, palm-sized jade disc, intricately carved like a profound glyph. To his right hung a long, wide register, its black surface etched with flowing white script. Both items pulsed with a brilliant light.

Yehui formed a hand seal and chanted, "By this decree, the wind stills, the waters cease; the Dharma manifests the Primordial."

The glyph and the register vanished. A profound chill shot through Li Ximing. He took a step back as violet flames erupted beneath his feet, celestial light bearing down from above.

'He obtained the Douxuan lineage!' Li Ximing thought, alarmed. 'He truly possesses spiritual artifacts!'

He had barely manifested his flames when a vibration shook his mind. The flat jade glyph appeared, *clanging* as his celestial light instinctively tried to suppress it. The glyph locked onto his face, and a devastating volley of lightning rained down.

The lightning was silver-white and utterly ferocious, blasting his protective violet flames into chaotic waves. Li Ximing fought the urge to summon the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. Instead, he formed a rapid seal, projecting a ray of Bright Yang light from his hand to intercept the lightning.

But the moment he committed to the seal, the long, black-and-white profound register leaped into existence on his other flank. A discordant sound blurred the air, and a torrent of crimson True Fire, fierce and agile as a falcon, sprayed toward him.

Li Ximing was already strained just blocking the lightning; how could he possibly fend off the fire? Furthermore, his 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' was completely pinned by Yehui's two divine abilities, leaving it immobile.

He gritted his teeth. His own Bright Yang nature meant that enduring intense flame, while agonizing, was preferable to taking a direct hit from that destructive lightning. He had to prioritize. He focused his defense on the lightning while the celestial light at his brow flared again, projecting a beam of white 'Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light' to counter the True Fire.

As expected, his hastily cultivated Hidden Light was no match for a dedicated spirit artifact. Although the beam split the fiery torrent and slightly diminished its power, a devastating amount of True Fire still rained down.

This was his Purple Mansion Dharma Body, not mortal flesh. Even so, the impact was excruciating. The searing True Fire split like boiling water, flowing over his Dharma Body as white steam hissed from every point of contact.

Li Ximing took the hit, his entire form blazing, his Dharma Body shimmering with a glazed, ceramic hue under the flames. This was no ordinary lightning, no common flame; it couldn't be extinguished by simple suppression. It was fire from a spiritual artifact, uncontrollable by his own Talisman Qi.

Worse, Yehui had already raised his Dharma sword, the tip aimed directly at Li Ximing's face, and had begun chanting another spell.

Li Ximing no longer cared what nonsense the man was mumbling. He only saw a yellow light flash before him, making his eyes sting, as multiple halos of light—one layered upon the next—began to manifest in the west. Whatever it was, it did not look easy to handle.

'This old fox is getting serious!'

Before Yehui could finish casting, Li Ximing forcibly burned his own vital energy. The 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' behind him erupted in a final, dazzling flare of violet flames, momentarily throwing back all the suppressing forces. In that single instant, Li Ximing’s figure vanished.

The purple water calmed. The white qi mountain struck empty space. The radiant light that had defied the void disappeared. The halos behind Yehui slowly dimmed. He sighed softly and gave chase through the Great Void.

Li Ximing reappeared a vast distance away, his body still wreathed in stubborn flames. Fortunately, his Bright Yang nature excelled at handling fire, and this True Fire wasn't the dreaded Merging Fire, which grew stronger as it burned. Extinguishing it wasn't his immediate priority. He fled onward, his mind racing.

'Yehui truly intends to fight. This is likely a demonstration of force... but if he sees an opportunity to inflict a serious injury, I doubt he'll pass it up!'

Those two artifacts had genuinely startled him. Now, Yehui pursued him from the west, the sensations of lightning and fire already beginning to manifest on his body again. Li Ximing was forced to continue fleeing east.

But Yehui’s speed in the Great Void was greater than his own—significantly faster than before. The 'Sorrowful Southern Water' surged beneath his feet, the purple water reflecting his burning silhouette. Li Ximing cursed inwardly and hesitated for a fraction of a second.

He was already far from Profound Peak territory. His options for sanctuary were few: the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate, the Xuanmiao Temple, the Xiukui Monastery, or fleeing all the way to the Eastern Sea. The Sword Gate and Xiukui were neutral observers; dragging a fight into their territory, especially one that required traversing the mortal world, would surely antagonize them.

That left the Xuanmiao Temple. Li Ximing didn't hesitate. He banked his light, altering his trajectory directly toward their territory.

'Going to Xuanmiao at least gives me a path of retreat,' he calculated. 'If Yehui really tries to kill me, Sumian is still there. And if Sumian refuses to intervene, I’ll drop directly into the mortal world. The Xuanmiao Temple is in Jiangbei. How dare Yehui continue a fight there?'

Dropping into Jiangbei was a desperate, last-ditch maneuver. First, while the region’s cultivators would undoubtedly intervene to stop the fight, alarming every Purple Mansion expert in both Jiangnan and Jiangbei was a disastrous way to maintain relationships. Second, this entire affair touched upon the True Monarch's grand design; it was nothing to be trifled with.

He raced onward, alternating between the Great Void and the mortal realm to shake his pursuer. He had just crossed the Snow Wings Gate's territory, his body taking several more licks of flame, when Yehui’s calm voice echoed from behind:

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing! A duel is a duel. Fleeing to Jiangbei is simply tasteless."

'How the hell do I know if you're dueling or trying to murder me!' Li Ximing retorted in his mind.

But just as he formulated the thought, the very fabric of the Great Void ahead of him changed. It twisted, becoming steep and treacherous. Snow began to fall. In the distance, an impossibly vast wind, heavy with frost, roared toward him.

The wind drew near. It was a pale, sickly green, yet it cast a gloomy, gray pall over everything, dimming the celestial light beneath his feet. Snow immediately accumulated, rising half a finger deep on his shoulders. Li Ximing's expression turned cold.

This wind felt familiar. He had seen arts derived from this lineage before—the 'Deep Abyss' aspect of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen came from this exact path.

'A divine ability from the Great Wind of the Deep Abyss lineage!'

He stopped short, realization striking him like a bolt of ice.

'The Capital Guard divine ability: "Western Heaven Plateau"!'

The Western Heaven Plateau—the legendary, desolate expanse west of Long and Shu, the very birthplace of the Great Wind. It was a place of absolute desolation, where spiritual qi was severed and the Great Void itself could not be crossed.

The moment the divine ability manifested, Li Ximing’s speed plummeted. The void beneath him warped under the ability's influence, becoming treacherous and rugged. Simultaneously, Yehui spat a plume of white qi as his 'Eastern Feather Mountain' divine ability activated. The white qi seemed to weigh thousands of tons, and the entire stretch of the Great Void around Li Ximing began to solidify.

'Western Heaven Plateau' and 'Eastern Feather Mountain' stacked upon each other. Their combined control over the Great Void instantly reached an apocalyptic new level. Li Ximing was horrified, a dark suspicion blooming in his mind.

'Does Yehui intend to kill me?!' he realized. 'The Capital Guard path... all three of its major divine abilities are lethal... Why have I never heard him use "Western Heaven Plateau" before!'

In the lightning-fast instant he processed the thought, the white qi descended and the void froze, nearly severing his connection to the mortal world. He was trapped. Li Ximing had no choice but to halt and manifest the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' once more.

'Eastern Feather Mountain' was not unfamiliar, nor was it overwhelmingly strong on its own; Li Ximing's own Celestial Gate could achieve a similar void-lock. Yehui had used it in their very first confrontation, and Li Ximing had broken the lock with purple fire to escape.

But that was then. Now, the glyph and the register hovered menacingly nearby. Lightning and True Fire were already descending. The white qi mountain peak was crashing down, and the 'Sorrowful Southern Water' surged from below. With his purple flames occupied, how could he possibly counter everything?

Li Ximing saw only two choices. He could use his purple flames to fight the lightning and fire, and the Celestial Gate to hold back the mountain and water, effectively trapping himself here to wait for an opening. Or, he could tank the artifacts' attacks directly and use his purple flames to blast open the void lock and flee to the mortal world.

'The mortal world below is the Snow Wings Gate's territory,' he analyzed frantically. 'Yehui will chase. I'll still have to cross Lake Xian. If I'm injured, my speed will be even slower. Taking the damage doesn't even guarantee my escape...'

'Use the Mountain-Chasing Tiger? With divine abilities pressing me from every side and a sword at my neck, the Tiger can't teleport me instantly. I'd just be wasting its defensive charge for nothing.'

In that split second, the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' roared to life, rising to meet the white mountain and purple water. The purple flames in his mouth clashed with the descending lightning. Once again, Li Ximing used his Hidden Light and his own Dharma Body to endure the True Fire.

The sound of sizzling crackled through the void. This time, the True Fire scorched his Dharma Body far more severely. Though the glazed hue remained, faint but undeniable scorch marks now marred its surface.

Li Ximing suddenly threw up a hand. The recently learned 'Sun's Resonant Parting Art' activated, swatting the black-and-white register away, while his other hand blurred into a different seal.

'Should I use it?'

He knew the 'Geng Tiger Dao' aspect of his divine ability could get him out of the lockdown. However, the Geng Tiger Dao excelled at stealth, concealment, and bypassing seals; it did nothing to augment his escape velocity or aid in traversing the void. Speed was not its strength.

Most critically, the True Fire still burning on his body made him as conspicuous as a lantern. He was too close to Yehui; he wouldn't get far. It would be a complete waste of the ability.

He committed. Divine ability blocked mountain and water. Purple flames blocked lightning. The Resonant Parting Art and Hidden Light blocked the True Fire. With no capacity left to counter Yehui's chanting, Li Ximing slapped his storage bag.

A stone box flew out. This was the container Li Zhouwei had brought back, filled to the brim with Serpent Origin Spirit Water. It was the largest supply of high-grade spirit water the Li family possessed. In this crisis, it was the only water he had in sufficient quantity. There was no time to worry about the waste.

Fortunately, Yehui seemed unaware that Li Ximing needed to extinguish the fire to utilize a stealth escape; the Daoist Master was only chanting faster.

Li Ximing slammed his palm onto the stone box. A sheet of crystal-clear spirit water burst forth, dousing his Dharma Body as he pushed his other abilities to their absolute limit.

*Pssssssht!*

The stubborn artifact-flames flickered wildly, sputtered, and finally, reluctantly, extinguished.

Before Li Ximing could feel a whisper of relief, a hazy yellow brilliance manifested behind Yehui. The Daoist Master completed his chant:

"Profound Light of the Three Xu Abandoning Purity... Go!"

Having just doused the fire, Li Ximing wasn't waiting around for the attack to land. Yehui had barely spat out the first word of the ability's name when Li Ximing sacrificed a white pearl, engraved with a tiger looking over its shoulder, from his Shengyang Acupoint.

Rainbow light flashed. In an instant, the pearl transformed into a spirit tiger that looked carved from gray-black stone, its eyes glittering with uncanny intelligence.

Li Ximing mounted the tiger. Immediately, the brownish-yellow 'Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen' shimmered into existence, wrapping around him like silken threads. He slammed his divine ability against the enclosing water and mountain, felt the void-lock shudder and loosen, and instantly tore through the opening, vanishing into the Great Void.

The 'Profound Light of the Three Xu Abandoning Purity' flashed and dissipated into the empty space he had just occupied.

Yehui was left standing alone, sword in hand, the purple river flowing quietly at his feet. He let out a long breath, clearly having expended significant energy. He made no move to chase. He simply stood motionless, allowing his divine abilities to recede.

As the white mountain and purple water faded away, Yehui stared into the vast emptiness where Li Ximing had vanished, a look of hesitation on his face. After a long moment, he composed himself, stepped back onto his flow of purple water, and departed.



# Chapter 758: Suspicion

Lake Xian, which connected to the Eastern Sea, was technically seawater. It sparkled under the midday sun while a few demon-soldier crab-generals patrolled the surface. Their numbers were far greater than in previous years; clearly, the war between Capital immortals Dao and Profound Peak had put all nearby demons on high alert.

Into this fragile peace, the Great Void tore open.

Immense violet flames erupted, instantly vaporizing the shimmering lake, causing it to cave in under a cloud of steam. Yellow-white salt crystals flash-formed on the reefs just before the rock itself melted away. From within the flames, the Daoist Master in white-gold robes burst forth, riding his tiger.

He had only just touched the lake's surface when the Great Void directly north of him tore open again, spitting out three streaks of yellow light. Li Ximing had no choice but to forcibly wrench his direction south, fleeing toward the coast.

He had just reached the estuary where Lake Xian meets the sea when the three yellow streaks arrived. Li Ximing felt a chill shoot up his spine, sighing inwardly.

'What *is* this technique!'

In the distant Great Void, thunder boomed and True Fire flared. He could vaguely feel the oppressive, sealing power of the 'Western Heaven Plateau' closing in again from the west. Yehui was definitely approaching. Li Ximing had no time to deal with the yellow technique and veered sharply away.

'Good thing I dispelled that True Fire... I left no traces in the Great Void,' he thought frantically. 'Unfortunately, this *Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release* has locked onto my aura. Yehui probably doesn't know the fire is gone... which means... if I can just evade this technique, I can escape completely!'

The *Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release* was impossibly fast. In the span of that single thought, it was upon him. Li Ximing paused for only an instant, shuttling into the Great Void. He took several long strides through the void before the three streaks of light arrived at the spot he had just vacated.

'Just as I thought! It's only a technique. Its ability to traverse the Great Void cannot compare to me riding the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. It’s a step too slow!'

Riding the spirit tiger, he flickered in and out of existence, weaving repeatedly between the Great Void and the mortal world. Although the chasing technique could also traverse the void—and possessed a raw speed greater than his own—it completely lacked his flexibility. The constant spatial weaving forced it to slow down.

Li Ximing didn't know if Yehui could still sense his position. He focused only on maximizing the distance, racing over the open sea for the better part of fifteen minutes. Yehui himself never appeared. Only this relentless technique pursued him.

Finally, seeing his chance, Li Ximing turned and spat a concentrated gout of purple flame, fixing the yellow light in place.

He was just about to follow up with a divine ability to destroy it when the *Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release* simply dissolved like sand in the wind, leaving only a hazy yellow mist. From within it, Yehui’s voice echoed:

"I was merely acting on arrangements from Purple Smoke to spar with Daoist Friend. I meant no actual harm. My apologies for the offense; please do not hold it against me! I gained much insight from this duel. If there is a chance in the future, we should certainly spar more often!"

The voice reverberated through the Great Void. Li Ximing scanned his surroundings. Yehui was truly gone.

The flames in his hand slowly dissipated. The wounds on his Dharma Body, scorched by the artifact-fire, flared with a dull, throbbing pain.

'What in the hell is that old fox playing at?'

'Wounds from that True Fire are notoriously difficult to heal... thankfully, the injury isn't severe. It shouldn't take *too* many years to recover...'

He stared heavily at the patch of dissipated mist, silently backing away. The Geng Tiger beneath him plunged back into the Great Void, heading deeper out to sea.

He had only taken two steps when his expression suddenly tensed, his face flooding with deep suspicion and outright alarm.

'Wrong. This is wrong.'

A spar? Impossible!

'Yehui’s goal was absolutely not a friendly duel! Something is deeply wrong here!'

'Yehui must have only recently perfected "Western Heaven Plateau." It was clearly the first time he had ever displayed it to anyone; otherwise, I would have heard of it. The only reason I ended up in such a sorry state was because of that surprise ability. If it were just "Eastern Feather Mountain," how could he possibly have pushed me that hard?'

'The Capital immortals Dao lineage has been isolated for years; it's mysterious and unpredictable. What does revealing a completely unknown, top-tier divine ability represent? Surely Yehui knows the implications!'

'An ability that domineering, used as a surprise attack, could cause another Purple Mansion cultivator to suffer a massive loss, securing enormous benefits for him. Why would he waste it on a mere "duel" with me? Now that he’s revealed it to me, its strategic value as an ambush weapon is gone!'

For Yehui to expend such effort to design this entire confrontation... it could never be just a spar.

"Someone wants to force me out into the Eastern Sea! Someone wants to harm my family..."

But the instant that terrifying thought flooded his mind, Li Ximing stopped dead.

"No... no. If they wanted to harm my family, they must first deal with me. Whether I realized their plot or not, I would absolutely return home. Therefore, they must have set up an array or an ambush along my route back..."

"In fact, it's *better* for them if I realize the plot. I would rush back anxiously, distraught and careless... But it's better for me to stay out here. As long as I am free and not trapped in an array, I can ensure the family's core survival... As for the rest... sacrifices will have to be made."

Li Ximing abruptly spun the Geng Tiger around. He poured his divine ability and Dharma power frantically into the spirit artifact, pushing its concealment and escape powers to their absolute limit. He plunged headlong back into the Great Void, intending to race toward the deepest depths of the Eastern Sea.

Yet, only an instant later, his paranoia hit another agonizing peak. He stopped again.

'Wrong. I am not an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator. Any array on the path back... I can detect it with the Immortal Mirror! I *can* go back. They cannot ambush me.'

His body reacted faster than his mind. He wrenched the Geng Tiger to a halt and spun around again, flying back west toward the continent. His power circulation was so violent that the tiger's eyes blazed with an intense white light. The Dharma patterns of the Geng Tiger Dao swirled rapidly across its stone body, dragging a long, white afterimage through the void.

Li Ximing pointed himself west. Halfway through the mental prayer for protection, he stopped dead.

The light faded completely from the Geng Tiger. It froze in place, standing utterly alone in the pitch-black Great Void.

Far ahead, a figure was striding toward him.

The man walked as if strolling through a peaceful courtyard, yet his speed through the Great Void was even faster than Yehui's. Everywhere he passed, the oppressive darkness brightened. He was a moving source of illumination. In the single instant Li Ximing had stopped, the figure vanished from the distance and reappeared directly before him.

Li Ximing felt that tyrannical, overwhelming aura flood the void. It felt like cold snow being pressed directly against his heart, and he shivered.

'West or east... it doesn't matter anymore,' he thought, despair settling in. 'He came to take it himself. What a way to come and take it.'

He looked up.

The man wore a yellow-white feather cloak. Each individual feather was etched with small, circular patterns, making them look almost like scales. Beneath it, he wore a bright white robe. A sword was strapped to his back.

His visible fingers were pale, holding a twelve-sided, glass-bodied, copper-based lantern. It emitted a soft, pale-yellow light that illuminated the surroundings.

The Daoist Master's features were, on the surface, kind and gentle. He had a high-bridged nose and broad cheeks, projecting an aura of scholarly refinement. But he also possessed a pair of willow-leaf eyes, and these added a chilling majesty that struck cold fear deep into the heart.

He raised an eyebrow, looking over at Li Ximing with that same mild warmth.

Li Ximing, however, felt the chill rush from his heart straight to his brain. The agonizing pain from his scorched Dharma Body flared anew. He forced his expression to remain neutral.

"A late-stage Purple Mansion Grand Cultivator. Changxiao!"



# Chapter 759: Desperate Flight to the Eastern Sea

Changxiao's reputation was immense. He and Guo Shentong had once shocked all of Jiangnan when they escaped a Grotto-Heaven with priceless treasures, right under the nose of a Purple Mansion cultivator's grand scheme. After achieving the Purple Mansion realm himself and founding his own Dao lineage, the Daoist Master became known as one of the foremost experts in manipulating the strings of fate.

Yet, his face was genuinely gentle and sincere. If not for the shrewdness in his eyes, he might have even appeared simple and honest. He held the lantern with a delicate touch, and his voice was deep and resonant.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing! It has been too long!"

A chill crept through Li Ximing's heart, but his voice betrayed nothing.

"Greetings, Senior Changxiao. I was just sparring with Daoist Friend Yehui and was on my way back. I did not expect to run into you, Senior. Is there something I can help you with?"

Changxiao lifted the lantern slightly, maintaining a careful distance from Li Ximing and securely blocking the path west through the Great Void. He watched him quietly before speaking.

"I had a grand-disciple. His worldly name was Wang Fu, and his Daoist title was Yu Fuzi. He was stationed in the Eastern Sea in his early years. He was a bit of a libertine, but his talent was undeniable... A pity... he was later killed by a cultivator of the Hengzhu Immortal Dao."

"At first, I didn't know the reason why. Only later did I learn that you, Daoist Friend, desired the Bright Radiant Sky Stone. You conspired with the Hengzhu, and it cost him his life... Heaven and earth bore witness to this matter. The traces remain in the Eastern Sea. Surely Zhaojing hasn't forgotten?"

His expression was placid, his eyes fixed on Li Ximing, searching for any flicker of emotion.

The man before him kept his head slightly bowed in an attitude of reverence. Changxiao studied him carefully. This Li Ximing seemed to lack any remarkable presence. His robes were conventional, and his expression was a mix of guilt and fear. Changxiao frowned slightly.

'Li Ximing…'

In the instant Changxiao paused to think, a dazzling radiance erupted from Li Ximing. Profound Light illuminated the void as the vibrant splendor of Bright Yang burst forth. A celestial gate rose from nothing, adorned with dragon banners, luan-drawn chariots, and jeweled standards.

The illusory colors of the Supreme Yang and the glow of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light converged, climbing the ornate, bright-white celestial gate. Billowing clouds of iridescent light surged directly toward Changxiao's face.

Facing the rushing Bright Yang divine ability, Changxiao simply lifted his sleeve, revealing his arm. He formed a hand seal.

"Fall!" he commanded.

Behind him, a field of brilliant white dots materialized, dense and dazzling against the pitch-black of the Great Void. With that single word, the Bright Yang divine ability at his feet shattered. Countless streams of radiant light scattered in every direction.

Li Ximing was already gone.

The moment Changxiao had spoken, Li Ximing knew his guess was right. The man had come with ill intent. Fearing some hidden trick, he didn't bother to reply. He poured all his accumulated divine ability and Dharma power into the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, transforming into a streak of light and vanishing into the void.

'The matter with Wang Fu… What nonsense! That Bright Radiant Sky Stone was bait, a hint pointing toward Tu Longjian, but the fact that my family ended up with it was the result of a gamble. How can he possibly place the blame on my family's head!'

Li Ximing had been present when Wang Fu died. The man's last words had been clear.

'He hates Jinlian... so he wants me dead!'

It was obvious that Wang Fu had been nothing more than a disposable pawn. Changxiao was just using his death as a convenient excuse!

As Li Ximing fled at maximum speed, Changxiao remained unhurried. He took a leisurely stroll through the Great Void, pinching his fingers together in a divination three separate times. Only then did he vanish, a streak of light tearing through the void in hot pursuit.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing… you took a spirit item from my Purple Mansion. Because of this tribulation, you have come to the Eastern Sea. Who here can possibly help you?"

Li Ximing's attack had been a diversion. He had summoned *Audience with the Celestial Gate* only to vanish an instant later. Now, riding the tiger in his desperate escape, he pushed its concealment abilities to their limit. But he found that the profound blackness of the Great Void around him was slowly lightening, shifting to a deep gray.

'He's already caught up.'

Changxiao was approaching from the south at an incredible speed. Li Ximing had bought himself only a moment's lead, and his only option was to flee east. Changing direction now would be foolishly closing the distance between them. The wondrous power of the Geng Tiger Dao began to activate, his form growing increasingly faint.

Compared to Li Ximing's life-or-death flight, Changxiao had barely quickened his pace. Holding his lantern, he watched Li Ximing's form fade into the distance. Suddenly, he spoke, his voice ethereal, rustling like wind through leaves as it crossed the void to Li Ximing's side.

"So the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger truly is in your hands. That old man from Profound Peak is a clever one, knowing that preserving your life was paramount... But it's not enough."

The lantern in Changxiao's hand brightened. Flames no larger than a thumb ignited on each of its twelve silver-and-gold-inlaid corners. The flames themselves did not give chase, but an intense wave of True Fire erupted from the lamplight. Li Ximing's fading figure instantly snapped back into sharp focus, and the surging power of the True Fire bore down on him, illuminating his back.

Li Ximing felt a searing heat on his back, but he could still bear it. However, the lantern's power clearly grew with proximity. As the seconds ticked by, the roasting sensation intensified.

'True Fire again!' he thought.

This wasn't surprising. Changxiao had entered the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven as a pawn of a Purple Mansion cultivator, so the Dao lineage and spiritual artifacts he obtained would naturally hail from there. Yehui's own lineage had been seized from Zhang Lingshu, also a product of the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven. That Grotto-Heaven's fame was widespread and its arts diverse, but their spiritual artifacts were almost certainly of a similar nature.

'Yehui… Changxiao… their Dao lineages come from the same source. Yehui's great offense against my family long ago was nothing more than a declaration of his stance… which means this plot began even earlier… it must have started when the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion first moved against us!'

'Whatever Changxiao is plotting against my family… he began laying the groundwork long ago. It's even possible that my breakthrough to the Purple Mansion realm disrupted his plans to some extent… leading to the current situation…'

'And Yehui was always hesitant, unwilling to burn his bridges completely. Even at the end, he withdrew his technique. He probably wasn't truly on the same side as Changxiao, but Changxiao must have some hold over him! That would explain his inconsistent actions, his constant restraint. He might have even been hoping I could escape Changxiao's grasp!'

His spiritual sense spread through the Great Void, evading the True Fire. He saw Changxiao's willow-leaf eyes, and a realization struck him like a thunderbolt.

'And Changxiao used precisely that… Why force a reluctant Yehui to participate? That reluctance, that restraint, was the key to his entire scheme!'

Changxi had left him the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger as a trump card. The only way to ensure Li Ximing would engage in a prolonged, traceable fight all the way to the Eastern Sea was to have Yehui—who, under Purple Smoke's authority, had no desire to make a true enemy of the Li family—be the one to make the move. This double, or even triple, layer of assurance was what made Li Ximing confident enough to fight without immediately hiding his trump card and fleeing back to Moongaze Lake on his spiritual artifact.

How much of this scheme Yehui understood was unclear, but it was his half-hearted obedience to Changxiao, his constant attempts to mediate, that had become a tool in Changxiao's plot.

A lone Purple Mansion cultivator could travel silently through the Great Void, but a battle between two was far more conspicuous. Once their fight reached the Eastern Sea and promptly ended, the watching cultivators—perhaps even Sumian and Tinglan—would disperse. Changxiao could then emerge at his leisure, cornering him in the isolated waters of the Eastern Sea.

'I can't fathom his entire plan… but that, at least, is part of it…'

The True Fire at his back, while different from before, felt familiar, lending credence to his theory. Li Ximing exhaled to calm himself. He stopped thinking about whether Tinglan and the others were complicit or if he had simply unraveled the plot ahead of time. Staying alive was all that mattered now.

'Since Changxiao also follows the Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage… he might have techniques related to thunder. I must be careful!' he silently warned himself. 'Thank goodness my foundation is Bright Yang… If it were anything else… either the True Fire or the Profound Thunder would have been a perfect counter to me!'

With the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger's concealment nullified, Li Ximing stopped trying to hide and simply focused on speed, streaking through the Great Void. Changxiao, lantern in hand, steadily closed the distance.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, we were merely discussing old times. Why leave without a word? It is rather impolite!" he called out softly.

"Senior Changxiao! If we are to discuss the past, why block my path home? Once I return to the mainland and find a place to heal, I will naturally send an invitation for you, Senior, so we can discuss things in detail. There is no need for such hostility, chasing me through the Great Void!"

Hearing this, Changxiao chuckled. He continued his inexorable approach, the scorching True Fire searing Li Ximing's back. Li Ximing's voice was grim.

"Rise!"

In an instant, the ornate, bright-white celestial gate materialized from the void. The intense Profound Light held Changxiao back for only a moment before the terrifying True Fire crashed down like a river of crimson, spilling over the sides of the gate and incinerating everything in its path.

Li Ximing's face turned a ghastly shade of pale, clearly injured by the backlash. He had only managed to open a sliver of distance before he heard Changxiao finish casting a spell.

"*Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art*, strike!"

Li Ximing immediately sensed a small, silver-bright vase flying toward him from behind. It moved with incredible speed, appearing as solid as a real object despite being a spell. He flicked his wrist, sending a jet of purple flame to intercept it.

"Hmph!"

But before the purple flame could connect, Changxiao snorted. A silver, circular disk flew out from behind him, engraved with golden osmanthus patterns. It shone upon the purple flame, and a burst of cold moonlight erupted, completely extinguishing it.

Employing the same trick as before, Li Ximing dove out of the Great Void. He emerged into a world of churning waves and dark, rolling clouds. He was met instantly by a flash of white light that had clearly been waiting for him in the physical world, and it shot straight into his eyes.

'A divine ability from Changxiao!'

He felt as if a spike had been driven into his skull. His vision swam, and his mind filled with a gray fog. The divine ability he had been half-forming nearly dissipated.

Fortunately, a cool sensation rushed into his mind, soothing the chaos. As his senses returned, he caught a glimpse of Changxiao emerging nearby and immediately plunged back into the Great Void.

But having broken through to the Purple Mansion realm only a few years ago, how could he possibly be a match for Changxiao? His mastery of the Great Void was far inferior. He had only just pierced through the veil when he was met head-on by the silver vase, which tilted and slammed down on him. The blow was staggering. Stars exploded behind his eyes, his chest seized, and he gasped for breath. Relying on that thread of coolness to maintain his posture, he spurred the tiger onward.

A moment later, Changxiao tore into the Great Void just as Li Ximing was pulling away. But this time, Changxiao didn't attack immediately. Instead, he watched with a look of surprise.

"Something's wrong…"

Changxiao had been a Purple Mansion cultivator for many years. He knew exactly what effect his divine abilities and arts should have, with only minor variations depending on his opponent's own powers. This was completely unexpected.

"To take a direct hit from my divine ability, followed by the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art*, and still be able to control a spiritual artifact… there must be something else at play. Either his soul is unusual and his destiny different, or he possesses some treasure that can keep his spiritual sense clear."

The next moment, he broke through into the physical world in pursuit. A torrential downpour lashed the surface of the sea, and the world was plunged into darkness. But mere rain could not impede the vision of a Purple Mansion cultivator. He stepped onto the wind and gave chase.

The Treasured Vase had left Li Ximing dizzy and disoriented. The circulation of his Dharma Body was sluggish, and even his divine abilities felt clumsy. Changxiao caught up to him twice. Forming a seal, a brutally intense, multi-colored beam of profound light, as thick as a fist, shot from between Changxiao's brows.

Li Ximing felt a mortal chill crawl up his spine. He immediately tore open his own chest, his organs shifting and rearranging to create a large cavity through his torso.

*Boom!*

The profound light shot straight through the hole. But a Purple Mansion cultivator's attack was not so easily thwarted. The beam was composed of two intertwining strands that rapidly expanded, cutting both up and down. Li Ximing, now at the end of his rope, was forced to act. His body split with a sickening tear, the two halves diverging to evade the attack.

Changxiao's brow-light swept through the world, leaving two trails of white vapor that boiled the sea and sent fish and shrimp tumbling through the air. His eyes watched, devoid of emotion, as Li Ximing's body reformed and continued its desperate flight.

"*Audience with the Celestial Gate* is said to be an art divine ability, but it has traces of a body divine ability. I miscalculated."

He spoke of miscalculation, but it was Li Ximing who was suffering. Splitting his body had allowed the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* to seep deeper, its effects growing more severe. And yet, his mind was now completely free of distracting thoughts, replaced by a crystalline clarity filled with fierce resolve.

'I am no match for him, but even Changxiao must have his own concerns. I will drag this out for as long as I can… a moment, a day… Unless my Shengyang Manor is utterly annihilated, if I can just escape far enough… I will show this old bastard something he'll never forget!'

Though they had only just reached the edge of the Hetian Sea, still a great distance from the far eastern reaches of the sea or the World's Cape, Li Ximing swallowed his own blood and pushed himself faster. He drove his divine abilities without regard for the cost, a bloody light beginning to glow around his body.

The influence of the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* was immense, but fortunately, Li Ximing's spiritual sense remained lucid. No matter how great the interference, he could use his sheer willpower to compensate. He suddenly looked back, raising the *Audience with the Celestial Gate* to defend himself, only to see a cloud of gray smoke gathering in Changxiao's hands.

The Daoist Master smiled.

"The Hetian Sea is far enough from Mount Luoxia, and this is dragon territory, where Luoxia's authority doesn't reach… We've been at this for the better part of a day, and there's been no reaction from the upper sect…"

Li Ximing ignored him, speeding further away, his urgency mounting.

'I've reached the edge of the Hetian Sea. This is unequivocally dragon territory. I cannot use the Supreme Yin Profound Light here… I have to get beyond this sea. Disappearing into the east is my best bet. The World's Navel is out of reach… but I must at least get to the far eastern edge of the sea, out of the dragons' sight.'

His grip tightened on his spiritual artifact.

'Even if I have to detonate the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, even if I have to sacrifice my Dharma Body… as long as a single sliver of my Shengyang can escape to the east… I can survive!'

He flew onward with his head down, only to see a cloud of gray smoke drift in from high above, starkly visible against the dark storm clouds. Blinding flashes of lightning brewed within the smoke, mirroring the storm in the heavens. Changxiao's voice, amplified by the Profound Thunder in his spiritual artifact, echoed across the sky.

"Your family's Bright Yang truly isn't a front for Mount Luoxia! In that case, I won't let you run any longer!"



# Chapter 760: Profound Arts

'Mount Luoxia... He’s even dragging Mount Luoxia into this...'

Dense gray smoke spread across the sea surface, threatening to close in. Before the thunder could fall, Li Ximing had no time to think and plunged directly into the Great Void. But the Great Void itself was already unstable, its spiritual energies roiled by the thunder fluctuations, causing the void to heave like a stormy sea, erupting in chaotic peaks and troughs.

Changxiao’s thunderous voice echoed all around. Li Ximing clearly felt the pulling sensation of the gray smoke. Whether it was a divine ability or a spiritual artifact, the smoke possessed a sealing power, though perhaps not its primary function. The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger struggled, tore free, and fled.

Changxiao’s figure tore through the void moments later. Li Ximing spurred his spiritual artifact onward, simultaneously retrieving a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill and consuming it. As his Dharma Body began to circulate the medicine, the debilitating effects of the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* finally lessened. But Changxiao merely raised the silver disk in his hand, shining it directly at him.

'Another spiritual artifact, without a doubt!'

Changxiao had inherited the Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage and was a Purple Mansion cultivator of immense experience. The lantern, the silver disk, and the gray smoke outside—these powerful spiritual artifacts were overwhelming. Li Ximing’s heart went cold.

'Do I flee the Great Void, or do I resist this head-on? Fleeing means facing that thunder array. It’s just a choice between the Supreme Yin and the Profound Thunder!'

'But the Great Void offers a huge advantage right now! We're at the edge of the Hetian Sea. Further east, the spiritual qi of the world thins out, unlike the abundant qi of the coastal waters. Flying in the Great Void becomes far more efficient out there—perhaps five or even ten times faster!'

Li Ximing wavered. Ultimately, he raised *Audience with the Celestial Gate*. This time, it wasn't a feint or an attack; he used it to reinforce his own position. An ornate, bright-white celestial gate materialized above him, bathing him in Profound Light.

The clear, bright radiance from the silver disk shone down, but before it struck the gate, a thick, brownish-yellow light screen erupted first. It was the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen.

The Supreme Yin light poured down but was temporarily held back by the screen. Li Ximing felt a moment of relief. 'Thank goodness it works!'

But his realization struck a second later. 'Changxiao isn't Yehui. I absolutely cannot keep jumping between the Great Void and the physical world. Instead of delaying him, I'll just be falling right into his traps!'

What was Changxiao famous for? Manipulating the strings of fate and mastering divination! Li Ximing knew his own combat experience was lacking. His previous tactic of weaving between the two realms had been read perfectly. A master of calculations like Changxiao could easily predict his emergence points and simply wait on the other side with attacks prepared.

He had already fallen for it twice—the blinding white light and the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* had both struck him head-on the instant he transitioned, leaving no time to defend. If any ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator had taken those two hits directly, they would be utterly incapacitated by now.

'If I'm going to transition, it has to be sudden and unexpected, not just a reaction when his arts are already descending. Otherwise, he'll predict it every time—especially someone who excels at calculation like him.'

For now, he was holding back the silver disk, but the Supreme Yin light was intensifying. Li Ximing had learned his lesson. Even if the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen started to fail, he absolutely would not jump back to the physical world just to interrupt the spell.

'I don't even need to think about it. That Profound Thunder array is definitely tracking me out there. The instant I emerge, it will blast me in the chest! There’s no room for error!'

His mind raced. He unleashed rays of Supreme Yang light and Bright Yang purple flame, sending them surging into the Great Void to intercept the small, exquisite jade vase flying toward him.

*Boom!*

Although the two lights were brilliant, they visibly faltered, pressed down by the vase and sliding backward. Still, it was far better than having the attack appear suddenly in his face.

But Changxiao’s next divine ability was already manifesting. Layers of white qi surged up, turning the surrounding void into a viscous swamp. The qi crawled up the structure of *Audience with the Celestial Gate*, attempting to lock the divine ability in place.

Li Ximing's only goal was to delay; he couldn't afford to be pinned down. He immediately sent *Audience with the Celestial Gate* flying upward to block the descending Supreme Yin light, while the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen plunged down to counter the encroaching white qi.

*Audience with the Celestial Gate* held steady against the silver disk, but the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen was clearly no match for the swamp-like divine ability. After a brief stalemate, Li Ximing knew he couldn't afford to be trapped. Forced to choose between the incoming *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* and the oppressive Supreme Yin light, he unhesitatingly prioritized the latter. *Audience with the Celestial Gate* suddenly flared with intense brilliance.

The Supreme Yang light and purple flames blocking the vase detonated, momentarily blasting the artifact back. Li Ximing then sent *Audience with the Celestial Gate* soaring, smashing it directly toward Changxiao’s face as a diversion. Ignoring the vase, Li Ximing spurred the tiger onward, bracing himself against the raw Supreme Yin light as he resumed his desperate flight east.

With *Audience with the Celestial Gate* occupied, the Supreme Yin light streaked toward him like a silver fish. Li Ximing pushed the tiger to its limits. His spiritual sense flared, and a dim yellow halo erupted from his body.

*Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption!*

This was another innate wonder of the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. Li Ximing hadn't used it until now for one simple reason: the ability reduced damage from attacks outside the Twelve Qi and the Fire Virtues. Since he had previously faced only True Fire or been caught off guard by surprise attacks, it had been useless.

Now, the dim yellow halo wrapped his Dharma Body in silken threads. When the Supreme Yin light struck it, the attack was instantly weakened by several degrees. Though it still detonated against his body and blasted numerous holes through him—an injury roughly comparable to the True Fire burns Yehui had inflicted—Li Ximing seized the opportunity. For the first time, he actually pulled away, opening up a real distance between them.

'He learns fast,' Changxiao thought, frowning slightly as the celestial gate rushed him. His cultivation was profound; he instantly recognized the Geng Earth light protecting Li Ximing. With a simple gesture, he recalled the twelve-cornered lantern from the physical world, tearing it back through the void into his hand. He would simply switch back to True Fire.

The sight sent a profound shock through Li Ximing. 'So it wasn't just thunder waiting for me in the physical world! He had this True Fire lantern positioned out there as well! If my realization had come even a moment later, if I had made that mistake one more time, it would have been fatal!'

But Changxiao’s expression turned solemn. He raised his hand, and white flames began to surge in the Great Void. Before he could even finish casting the spell, Li Ximing vanished, slipping back into the physical world like a nimble fish.

The logic was simple: Changxiao had just recalled his True Fire lantern. All that remained in the physical world was the thunder. Since *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* was highly effective against thunder, if he didn't escape now, when would he?

The moment Li Ximing emerged, countless silver-white thunderbolts materialized and crashed down. The *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* flared brightly, venting the electricity away from him. Although the ability was far more effective against thunder than Supreme Yin, this electrical storm had been accumulating power for a long time. Li Ximing's Dharma Body was blasted until black smoke rolled off him, yet he endured, pushing forward at extreme speed. The damage wasn't even as severe as that single hit from the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art*!

He waited for Changxiao to follow him back to the physical world, planning to dive back into the Great Void at the opportune moment, but Changxiao never appeared. As Li Ximing sped through the torrential downpour, his heart began to pound with dread.

Li Ximing had learned from his two painful lessons and adapted, but Changxiao was a man of deep calculations. He was a cultivator who, much like Tu Longjian, had clawed his way to the top against numerous Purple Mansion experts. How could such a man willingly serve as a whetstone for his opponent to sharpen his skills?

He felt a sudden chill crawl up his spine as a voice exploded in his ears, vaguely articulating a chant:

"*The Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art.*"

A stream of deep black light tore out of the Great Void, moving with incredible speed. Li Ximing refused to stop, pushing his own escape light forward. He knew he couldn't dive back into the Great Void to dodge this; gritting his teeth, he flew onward, but the black light drew closer and closer.

'If I hadn't taken those debilitating hits earlier, I wouldn't be in such a wretched state now!'

After a long chase through the relentless storm, the air ahead of him warped. Three silver vases tore through the rain—the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* again. Having already suffered from it, Li Ximing didn't bother looking for Changxiao; he activated his *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* and simultaneously summoned *Audience with the Celestial Gate*, the massive white gate rising from the storm, its power pressing down to suppress the incoming spells.

He used his full strength, barely managing to pin the three vases, only for his pupils to reflect an endless sea of True Fire. The twelve-cornered lantern had just torn through the Great Void to manifest before him.

'*Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* can't block True Fire!'

Li Ximing had no choice but to divert his power, unleashing Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light and Bright Yang Purple Flame to counter the lantern. In that instant of vulnerability, the jet-black *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* slammed into his body, exploding in a dark flash.

A second later, his body vanished from the physical world, having fled back into the Great Void.

Changxiao, however, smiled.

'The great matter is settled.'

Both the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* and the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* were profound arts from his Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage, but the *Sangyu* art was far older. It wasn't an attack of light or spiritual energy, but something derived from ancient immortal arts. Its effectiveness relied on three conditions: being seen by the target, being heard by the target, and landing on the target.

Just now, Li Ximing had clearly seen the black light, distinctly heard the name of the art, and had finally been struck by it. He had taken the full force of its conditions. This was not something the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* could even compare to.

Chasing him from the coastal waters all the way to the Hetian Sea, Changxiao had never been completely certain he could capture or kill him. Li Ximing, though wretched, had not suffered a fundamental injury, and his reactions were quick, even managing to create opportunities to counter. If the chase dragged on much longer, the Hengzhu lineage would absolutely intervene.

But Changxiao had schemed for this outcome, first testing Mount Luoxia’s attitude, then the attitude of the dragon clans, ensuring no one would interfere. Now that his masterpiece, the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art*, had landed, the matter was finally guaranteed.

'Mount Luoxia has no intention of protecting him, and the dragon clans clearly don't care either. Li Zhouwei may have been invited by a Dragon Prince in the past, but that alliance was clearly only with him as an individual. The Li family is not on the list of those the dragon clans will intervene to save.'

'And even if the dragon clans *did* want to protect him, the only ones in the Eastern Sea who could intercept me are the demon cultivators. Letting him escape would cause me little loss, but Mount Luoxia would no longer just watch from above. That action would be all the proof they needed that the dragon clans are attempting to seize the Bright Yang Dao!'

Changxiao never acted without calculating every angle. He pushed the gray smoke forward, letting the thunder roll, intentionally shaking the surroundings. He sensed several other cultivators—Demon clan experts and masters of the Eastern Sea—stepping through the Great Void to observe from a distance. This set his mind further at ease.

'Even in the one-in-ten-thousand chance that Li Zhouwei was secretly a pawn left by the Bright Splendor Imperial Monarch, that entity wouldn't dare save him now. With so many Purple Mansion experts watching, wouldn't that just expose to the world that the ancestor Li Qianyuan still retains his private consciousness?'

'I've made a huge commotion, and Purple Smoke Gate and the Hengzhu clan will certainly rush here immediately. But it is already far too late!'

The Daoist Master listened intently. He tossed the lantern back into the Great Void, letting the spiritual artifact continue the pursuit on its own, while he himself crossed into the physical world. He flew through the rain for a moment, then stopped and began pinching his fingers, calculating.

Li Zhouwei's connection to Mount Luoxia, and perhaps even Li Qianyuan, was a strong possibility. And Li Ximing himself, though seemingly ordinary, had shown abnormalities—that treasure protecting his spiritual sense, perhaps even some hidden link to the Wei Emperor. Changxiao would not give his quarry any chance whatsoever to turn the tables.

Bypassing calculations aimed directly at Li Ximing's fate—which might be shielded—he focused only on the fluctuations in the Great Void. Sure enough, he pinpointed where Li Ximing, clad in his white-gold robes, would emerge nearby. Changxiao formed a hand seal. The silver disk behind him leaped into the air, and the gray smoke rolled with thunder. He raised an eyebrow.

*Boom!*

The rain poured as thunder shook heaven and earth. Far away, the Great Void rippled, and Li Ximing burst forth. His Dharma Body was now wreathed in the black qi of the curse, and the Geng Tiger beneath him had slowed considerably.

Li Ximing was suffering under the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art*. The black qi wrapping his Dharma Body had erupted into dark flames, burning him with an audible crackle. A sharp pain radiated from his Juque Palace, as if the black fire was erupting from within it. Fortunately, his *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was nurtured within that very palace, and his own Bright Yang Purple Flame was suppressing the curse. For the moment, it wasn't debilitating. Li Ximing clutched his spiritual artifact tightly and plunged headlong into the darkness of the storm.

Daoist Master Changxiao recalled his lantern and took a step to follow, only to freeze.

His actions ceased. He stopped the pursuit. Instead, he lifted his head and looked toward the heavens.

The rain poured, and monstrous waves clawed toward the sky. Thunder writhed like dragons, and silver cracks spiderwebbed the pitch-black night.

But the thunder in the sky no longer obeyed Changxiao's command. Instead, it converged resolutely before him, purple and white electricity intertwining, forming a flowing river of liquid lightning that snaked downward, emitting a violent, deafening roar.

Changxiao's vision was completely filled by the cascading purple-and-white brilliance. His gaze remained cold, fixed on the atmospheric thunder. The Supreme Yin silver disk began to circle his body clockwise, slowly moving to hover directly in front of his face.

*BOOM!*

A massive, shivering silver-white thunderbolt dropped from the sky, smashing into the silver disk with a deafening metallic *clang*. The lightning did not dissipate; it flowed wildly, condensing three feet away from him, stabbing relentlessly at the disk and burning away patches of black smoke.

The front seven inches of the thunderbolt were shaped like a sharp prism, flat as a buckwheat seed, buzzing as it pierced the artifact. The shaft behind it appeared to be six feet long, its light flowing, as purple-and-white electricity seemed to flow backward from it, connecting up into the heavens.

Changxiao slowly raised the twelve-cornered lantern, using its light to disperse the overwhelming glare of the thunderbolt. Only then did the shape before him stabilize, revealing its true form.

It was a silver-white, intricately patterned spear.



# Chapter 761: Thunder

The thunder roared. Silver-white lightning flowed backward along the spear's tip, extending six feet into the air. Though the storm still poured in the distance, the nearby rain suddenly suspended, each drop becoming a crystal-clear sphere that evaporated and shrank within the lightning's aura.

The glow from Changxiao’s lantern intensified, steadily wearing away the electrical glare. He saw the spear was held in a slender, pale hand. The thunder climbed affectionately around the wrist, leaping onto a sleeve cuff adorned with purple-and-white feathers.

Only then did he clearly see the female cultivator standing before him. She had a high-bridged nose, willow brows, and apricot eyes, but within those pupils, purple qi flowed like mist. Her black hair fell like a waterfall, her brow marked by a purple sigil. The dense lightning climbed her body, converging behind her to form an immense, purple-and-white circular disk.

Whether this disk was a divine ability or a spiritual artifact, it was vast as a mountain, covered in dense, fractal patterns of lightning. Suspended over the sea, the woman at its center looked like a mystic bird floating within the eye of the storm, her long spear leveled directly at Changxiao’s glabella.

The churning waves below rapidly ceased, and the sea grew preternaturally calm. The rain that should have been falling was caught by primordial magnetism, the drops hovering above the surface before shrinking into nothing. In an instant, the ocean became a perfect mirror, reflecting the mountain-sized thunder disk and the mystic bird of a woman within it.

Changxiao held his lantern as the dense white smoke gathered around him once more. His pupils reflected the purple-and-white lightning filling the world as he asked softly, "Are you a dragon?"

*Boom!*

A vast thunderclap answered him. The silver spear reversed, planting itself in the air with a metallic clang. The woman stood clad in purple-and-white feathered thunder-robes and boots etched with fine silver patterns, floating in the void. The long feathers of her outer robe began to lengthen, trailing behind her in the lightning.

Her voice was clear and icy, ringing out in harmony with the heavens: "I am Thunder."

Instantly, a silver-white thunderbolt as thick as a water bucket dropped from the sky. Changxiao reacted immediately; the silver disk etched with profound patterns flashed overhead. Its Supreme Yin light held against the lightning for only a fraction of a second before flaring brightly, clearly reinforced by Changxiao’s own divine ability and Dharma power.

*BOOM!*

The sound of the impact arrived a moment later, far louder and more majestic than the bolt itself. The silver disk shook violently, flashing in protest.

Changxiao watched in silence as the purple-and-white lightning gathered like a tide, surging within the dark clouds and reflecting the hazy figure in the sky. The lantern in his hand grew steadily brighter.

The mirror-like sea was completely covered by the purple-white lightning, reflecting the giant thunder disk from both above and below. But at the far horizon, a speck of brilliant gold began to rise.

"Daybreak," Changxiao observed.

The morning sun breached the horizon, signaling the end of the long night. Sunlight pierced the dark clouds, illuminating Changxiao’s face and the deep calculations within his willow-leaf eyes.

The Daoist Master understood that as time passed, the chase had become meaningless. Even if he suppressed this woman, he would never find Li Ximing’s trail further east.

Although the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* was a lock, Li Ximing was also a Purple Mansion cultivator. He wouldn't be stupid enough to double back, and his *Audience with the Celestial Gate* specialized in suppression and refinement. He must have been suppressing the curse while fleeing, and by now, the trail was cold.

Changxiao’s experience and cultivation base were profound, and he quickly reached a judgment: the dragon clans would absolutely not intervene in this situation. The woman before him could only be a lucky beneficiary of some thunderous fortuitous encounter within a Grotto-Heaven.

Changxiao raised his head and said coldly, "Presumably, Daoist Friend, you gained an opportunity by swallowing thunder, becoming an agent of Thunder for the dragon clans. You've barely reached the Purple Mansion realm, yet you wield such astonishing majesty."

"I was merely passing through the sea territory you guard. You wish to help someone from your human bloodline; that is reasonable enough. Out of respect for the dragon clans, I will no longer pursue the matter of Li Ximing."

He raised his lantern, preparing to tear through the Great Void and depart, only to find the world erupting in thunder. Purple-and-white lightning fell like a waterfall. Changxiao’s expression frosted over as he turned his head.

The thunder that had been gathering in the sky began to move. The sea below surged with an incalculable number of aquatic beings; countless silver and green scales and fins breached the surface before vanishing back into the depths.

The woman hovered in the center of the massive, purple-white Thunder Pool disk, which blazed with fractal patterns. All the storm clouds in the sky converged toward it, like myriad stars paying homage to the moon, arraying themselves around the Thunder Pool, holding it between the heavens and the sea.

"Then *I* must pursue this matter," her clear voice echoed across the world. "After all, the dragon clans have face. You, Daoist Friend, do not."

***

East of the Eastern Sea.

The immense thunder storm had just passed, and the torrential rains over the Quhai Sea had stopped. The only thing left on the water's surface were a few pieces of splintered wood, spinning in small whirlpools. A damp, cold wind blew from the coast. Upon the shore, the Great Void fluctuated, and a brilliant light emerged.

The moment this Profound Light appeared, raging flames manifested around it, searing the sea surface and sending up clouds of white steam. It sped across the water and landed on a nearby island.

The light resolved into the cultivator in the white-gold Daoist robes, who staggered several steps before collapsing to his knees.

Earlier, Li Ximing had been fleeing the storm when he sensed Changxiao had run into trouble. He immediately seized the opportunity, fleeing headlong without ever looking back, and plunged back into the Great Void.

Out here, in the vast seas east of the Eastern Sea, his travel speed within the Great Void was astonishingly fast. He did not sense his pursuer's aura, and trusting that detection grew fainter the further east he went, he kept his Supreme Yin Profound Light hidden and focused only on speed.

He didn't know how long he had flown, but spots began to appear in the void ahead, and he could faintly perceive the end in the far distance. Li Ximing had a sudden realization: 'I’ve reached the Sea’s Cape!'

The Great Void behind him was utterly silent; it seemed Changxiao had not given chase. Still, Li Ximing dared not relax. Dragging his heavily injured body, he changed direction in this desolate region, flying south for the better part of a day. Only after using his Immortal Mirror to scan the area and confirming no one was present did he finally emerge into the physical world.

He knelt on the sandy ground, stirring up a cloud of dust that revealed the stark white bones hidden just beneath the surface. The wooden fragments still drifted on the sea. Li Ximing couldn't stop himself from coughing.

"Cough... cough..."

He spat out a mouthful of brilliantly shining blood. When it struck the sand, it sounded like stones colliding, shattering into a dense white powder mixed with tiny insects that immediately scattered. The few drops that pooled in hollows instantly grew into clams, remaining motionless among the rocks.

The flames of the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* still flickered on and off across his body, melting the surrounding sand into patches of crystal. Li Ximing felt a searing heat throughout his body; the damage to his Dharma Body was clearly significant.

"Hahaha... *cough, cough*... Hahahaha!"

Li Ximing laughed even as he coughed, feeling not distress, but overwhelming relief at having survived the calamity.

He had been fully prepared to sacrifice his spiritual artifact, even his Dharma Body itself. He had been ready to leave behind just a single sliver of his Shengyang and use the Supreme Yin Profound Light to take Changxiao down with him.

Once Changxiao was dead, the resulting trouble would have been just as severe as if he lived. But now, Changxiao was alive and he had escaped, saving both the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger and his Dharma Body. Although he was heavily injured and afflicted by the curse, this outcome was far, far better than his grimmest expectations.

He stood up. The ground was covered in the white insects, still waving their slender, pale limbs. Li Ximing suppressed the searing pain in his spiritual sense, glanced at them, and whispered, "Return."

The instant he spoke, a wind swept the ground, scraping all the scattered white powder and stone fragments toward him. The countless white insects swarmed back, and even the clams leaped from the rocks, gathering into a single mass at his feet before self-immolating in a burst of purple flame.

'This blood... corrupted by the curse... it cannot be reabsorbed into the Dharma Body or refined into Bright Yang materials. Normally this wouldn't matter, but in my weakened state, I absolutely cannot leave a single trace behind that someone could use for divination.'

Taking a step, Li Ximing noticed a sand-louse type of Demon beast burrowed beneath the sand. It had not yet developed true intelligence, but its cultivation wasn't bad; it knew a terrifying presence had arrived on the shore and was trembling in its hiding spot. The bones he had seen earlier... they were likely this creature's leftovers.

Unwilling to leave any trace of his presence, Li Ximing suppressed the urge to cough and stomped his foot once. The sand-louse was instantly incinerated into nothingness. He turned, found a reef, and leaned against it to inspect his injuries.

His Dharma Body had been roasted by True Fire multiple times, leaving his entire back slightly cracked. His shoulder was pierced by several holes from the Supreme Yin light. Changxiao’s arts focused on yin-aligned powers and curses, so while his body had no massive missing sections, his overall condition was far from optimistic.

His Shengyang, a key Purple Mansion acupoint, ached under the influence of the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art*—he still didn't know what medium Changxiao had used to inflict it. Black flames roiled within his Juque Palace, while both invisible and deep-black flames intertwined on his skin, steadily draining his divine abilities and Dharma power.

He gathered his thoughts, his gaze sweeping over the wooden fragments on the sea. "I don't know which outer sea this is, but people clearly live here... That’s convenient enough."

Li Ximing was not afraid of encountering some powerful expert here at the Sea's Cape, where spiritual qi was thin. Even if he was so heavily injured that his Dharma power failed and his body collapsed, killing a Foundation Establishment cultivator was merely a flick of his sleeve. As for Qi Refining or Embryonic Breathing cultivators, it would take nothing more than a puff of air or a sharp glare.

"Unless a Purple Mansion cultivator happens to be passing through, only then would I need to be cautious."

The flames on his body raged. Unwilling to scorch the coastline and leave obvious traces, Li Ximing used his Bright Yang divine ability to suppress them. But as he took two steps, the black fire within his Juque Palace surged, rising to contend equally with his own Bright Yang Purple Flame.

Li Ximing focused his divine ability inward to suppress it. Yet, the moment the black fire in his Juque Palace dimmed, the flames on the surface of his skin suddenly swelled, nearly breaking his containment and threatening to incinerate his surroundings.

"What a bizarre art. The inner and outer flames are a single entity. Suppress the external fire, and the Juque fire flourishes. Suppress the Juque fire, and the external fire rages... This must be from the Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage."

It was too inconvenient to deal with now. Li Ximing could only let the flames inside his Juque Palace rage temporarily as he rode his escape light forward, stepping once to appear in the forest at the island's center.

This forest was dotted with numerous villages. They had pale yellow thatched roofs and were mostly wooden structures; the better ones were merely crude stone-framed houses. Li Ximing scanned them. Based on this level of architecture, even if cultivators were present, they wouldn't exceed the Jade Capital Wheel realm.

As expected, when Li Ximing landed for a look, the inhabitants were all savages. They had no cultivation and were shouting in some barbarian tongue, babbling incomprehensibly.

His injuries were worsening, and he couldn't spare them much thought. He scanned again. There were over ten thousand savages gathered below. Though they lacked cultivation, they had their own survival methods, including a stone altar that was covered in bloody offerings from dissected animals. Red blood flowed down its sides, where a powerful-looking tiger demon crouched, lapping up the blood.

This tiger demon seemed to be at the Qi Refining realm. It looked like some wild, backwater species; not only was its cultivation impure, it didn't even know how to properly refine the blood offerings, merely lapping them up raw. Li Ximing couldn't be bothered to give it a second glance. He raised a finger and blew lightly.

A wisp of purple flame shot from the air and landed on the ground. The tiger demon had no time to react; it was still lapping at the blood when it was instantly incinerated into ash. The area below exploded into chaos. The crowd of kowtowing savages stared, dumbfounded. After a moment, seeming to conclude their god had departed on the wind, they gathered the remaining offerings and quickly retreated.

'It’s lucky for them it was me who arrived. Had it been another Purple Mansion cultivator, this group of barbarians—not even my own species—wouldn't have amounted to two mouthfuls.'

Li Ximing glanced away, then activated the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, channeling the *Mountain-Chasing Profound Evasion* art to escape into the earth beneath the island.

He had spent a long time searching in the Great Void before selecting this specific island. Although its spiritual qi was thin, its earth veins, water veins, and fire veins were all complete and sufficiently complex. The terrain was also stable and wouldn't be easily disturbed, making it suitable for his recovery. After all, he didn't know how to set up arrays, and he was injured; if he healed in an ordinary place, the leakage of his power would soon sprout Bright Radiant Sky Stones, gray cicadas, or gardenias, attracting unnecessary suspicion.

After traveling deep into the earth veins, Li Ximing found a gentle junction where the earth and water veins intersected. He casually set down a simple array disk and sat cross-legged. The fire in his Juque Palace was already burning uncontrollably. He activated his *Audience with the Celestial Gate* divine ability, and it flashed, slamming down hard internally.

*Boom!*

Intense black flames instantly erupted from his body, accompanied by a violent tremor that spread outward. The fire, deep within the earth, immediately began to gather the earth-baleful qi, roasting the surrounding veins until they roiled.

The *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* was clearly extraordinary, especially having been cast at full power by a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator like Changxiao who had already crossed an immortal threshold. The curse was astonishingly stubborn. His attempt to suppress it not only failed to wear it down but instead stimulated its full power, causing turmoil throughout the earth veins.

Li Ximing couldn't stop himself from spitting out another mouthful of blood, which he instantly incinerated. He activated *Audience with the Celestial Gate* at full power, forcing all the black flames out of his Juque Palace and redirecting them to his sides.

Although Li Ximing had never studied the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art*, he was beginning to understand it. The curse was clearly designed to grow stronger and stronger after impact, but his own *Audience with the Celestial Gate* divine ability specialized in suppression and refinement, which was the only reason the curse hadn't been able to advance an inch.

He was not afraid. Activating *Audience with the Celestial Gate* fully, it manifested within his Juque Palace as the ornate, bright-white celestial gate. The dragon banners and luan-drawn chariots within its heavenly glows all transformed into pure light, beginning the arduous process of grinding the curse down, bit by bit.

Bright Yang was, after all, the core Dao lineage of the former northern hegemon, the Wei state. Barring a few specific counter-lineages, its flaws were pitifully few. *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was not only supported by his Dharma Body, it could stand against a tyrannical curse like the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* without backing down. As one of the premier divine abilities for suppression and refinement, it immediately bore down on the black flames, causing them to dim and begin fading at an agonizingly slow, but steady, rate.



# Chapter 762: Curse Fire

Li Ximing cultivated within the earth veins for some time, managing to temporarily grind away nearly half of the black flames within his Juque Palace. His bright Bright Yang Purple Flame had once again regained the upper hand, but he was forced to stop.

The reason was simple: as he steadily forced the fire out of his Juque Palace, the invisible and deep-black flames covering his body grew increasingly intense. They had already melted layer after layer of the surrounding cavern walls and were spreading into the earth veins. If he continued, this earth vein would transform into a fire vein, and a volcano would soon erupt on the island.

'No matter how stable this region is, it can’t simply endure a Purple Mansion-level flame burning indefinitely... When the time comes, it won’t just attract other cultivators to investigate; I’m afraid it will also cook all ten thousand or so people on the island alive'.

Li Ximing stopped. Fortunately, his current cultivation was worlds apart from what it had been. Furthermore, having just walked the line between life and death, his understanding of both Bright Yang and the Great Void seemed to have deepened significantly.

He immediately took out the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger and activated its divine ability. The entire earth vein rumbled and began to shift, moving several inches to the left. He then flicked a finger, and with a chiming sound, a jet of cold water erupted from the wall.

*Tsssss!*

He had linked the earth vein to the water vein. Surging groundwater poured into the chamber, and the surrounding water vein instantly released countless clouds of steam. The baleful qi in the earth vein sank immediately, but the dense curse fire still filled the space, instantly vaporizing the water as it entered.

'This ground-water is naturally nothing against a Purple Mansion’s arts, but its advantage is that it flows without end. It can prevent the fire-balefulness from accumulating, affecting the surface, or causing anomalies on the island that might attract unwanted attention'.

Sure enough, the steam generated by the water vein immediately rushed up through the gaps in the earth-baleful qi toward the surface. The rest of the groundwater refilled the area but could not get close to the flames, leaving only a chamber of roiling black fire and endless steam rushing upward.

'Now, what rises to the surface isn't fire balefulness. The qi will condense back into water, at most forming a large spirit spring. This kind of tectonic change is common. The traces are almost non-existent, and it won't harm the people on the island'.

An operation that would have been impossible during his Foundation Establishment realm was now accomplished with a mere flip of his hand. He used the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger to slightly reinforce the earth vein, then sat cross-legged again. Pinching his fingers to calculate the time, he realized several months had already passed.

"The family hasn't crushed the emergency jade pendant, so nothing too urgent must have happened".

"Furthermore, I am overseas and not injured to the point of death; I still retain a significant portion of my strength. The family should be safe. Even if Changxiao has it out for me, he likely won't trouble my family...".

"Second, this entire affair was handled through Purple Smoke Gate. If I had been struck dead by Changxiao instantly, Tinglan and Sumian could have pretended nothing happened and stayed out of it. But since I didn't die, they have both lost face in this matter. They will have to protect my family, at least somewhat".

"Only Zhouwei... he is the one in danger now. It’s a good thing he was already in seclusion, cultivating within the lake. I just don't know how he is".

"This *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art*... it’s becoming harder and harder to deal with".

Li Ximing had been afflicted by the curse for a long time now. Although he had forced most of the fire out of his Juque Palace, the flames on the surface of his body were now roasting him so fiercely that his skin flowed with a glassy, glazed light, growing more fragile by the moment.

'[Valley Wind Guides Fire] isn't wondrous enough to seize another person's flame and make it my own; it can only control my own flames or ownerless fire. Otherwise, I wouldn't be suffering like this...'.

Li Ximing remained troubled, but the profound relief of having escaped Changxiao’s grasp still allowed him a moment of grim humor.

"If I, Li Ximing, could actually seize another person’s flames for my own use, people might even believe I was the reincarnation of some Fire Virtue True Monarch...".

It wasn't just the bottleneck in expelling the flames; the curse's negative effects on his Dharma Body were becoming more pronounced. He felt a stinging pain in his forehead, and as the dual flames burned him inside and out, his divine abilities and Dharma power all felt icy cold, a sensation that was difficult to resolve. He could only suppress the flames, but the stinging forehead and the encroaching cold in his power were not so easily dismissed.

"At least *Audience with the Celestial Gate* drove most of the fire out of my Juque Palace," he mused. "That counts as a good thing".

By stabilizing his Juque Palace, his Dharma Body at least wouldn't collapse. Though the surface flames were troublesome, Li Ximing could still move and cast spells while enduring the curse.

'But in this state... it’s not suitable for traveling. And I’m afraid I’ll run right into Changxiao if I try to go back'.

He had luckily escaped during that storm, and Li Ximing guessed that the dragon clans might have intervened. Either by accident or through one of their pawns, someone had blocked Changxiao for him.

"Xiao Chuting is away in the Northern Sea, so it couldn't have been him. The others wouldn't be bothered. Senior Tu Longjian is in the Southern Sea... It could only have been a dragon. A pity... I still ended up using Zhouwei’s favor with the dragon clans. I've let him down".

Li Ximing understood perfectly how much that favor would have helped Li Zhouwei after his breakthrough; only after reaching the Purple Mansion realm himself did he truly appreciate the sheer power of the dragon clans. He could only sigh silently in guilt.

He tried to divert his thoughts, sitting in place for several more days to repair his Juque Palace, but the flames on his skin only burned hotter, and cracks began to spread across his Dharma Body. Anxiety finally gripped his heart.

"What a venomous art! And the Earth-Gazing Bloodstone is back in the family treasury... But even if I had it in my hands, it would likely be just a drop in the ocean against an injury of this magnitude".

If he wanted to preserve his Dharma Body, he would have to suppress the external flames, which meant giving up the ground he had taken in his Juque Palace. The past several months of effort would be wasted. But if he didn't suppress the external flames, his Dharma Body would grow weaker and weaker until it, too, showed signs of collapse.

Li Ximing could also use spirit items to mend the damage, but the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* was not Yehui’s True Fire. These Foundation Establishment-grade materials would only treat the symptoms, not the root cause. It would just be delaying the inevitable for a few years and wasting his savings.

'If I don't want to just sit here and wait for death, the only alternative is to risk going out to search for a cure. But in this state, wreathed in a massive aura of fire... whether in the Great Void or the physical world, I’m like a shining lantern. Who wouldn’t see me?'.

He pondered this for a long time before silently raising his head.

His gaze instantly pierced the layers of rock above him, observing the ten thousand savages on the island—a group even more primitive than the Mountain Yue.

Since advancing to the Purple Mansion realm, Li Ximing understood many profound mysteries. Like every cultivator who reached this realm, he intrinsically understood how to consume blood qi, just as he understood how to fabricate a new body or how to occupy a Dharma Body with his Shengyang—it was all as natural as eating or drinking.

And that wasn't even mentioning that he was an alchemist.

If he just had the inclination, with his alchemy skills, he could easily refine a suitable pill to solve his current problem. With such a pill to suppress the curse, combined with his divine ability, he could drive the fire out completely without any risk or significant cost.

Li Ximing stared grimly at the surface for a long moment. His ear twitched. Finally, he closed his eyes. He retrieved a stone box from his sleeve and flicked it open, revealing a clear, bright spirit water inside.

He drank two mouthfuls before entering deep seclusion to continue the suppression.



# Chapter 763: The Xia Migration

**Moongaze Lake**

Brilliant sunlight bathed Pingya Island, casting the long shadows of its towers across the stone steps. Ascending those steps tier by tier, Kong Guxi knelt before the main hall's entrance. To his left and right, cultivators hurried past, none paying him any mind.

The array formation at the Profound Peak mountain gate had been easily shattered, their ancestral lands were lost, and the entirety of Shanji Prefecture had fallen. Fu En, who had been in seclusion for a breakthrough, had died catastrophically, unleashing a pillar of Geng Earth Qi into the heavens. Yehui himself had appeared at their mountain gate, shaking the Wasteland to its core. The Kong family members could do nothing but beat their chests in despair.

The Profound Peak Gate had treated the common people and cultivators under their rule well, and their influence was deeply rooted. The half-million people who had migrated with their clan and their affiliates all wept, and a chorus of grief rose to the heavens.

The Profound Peak Gate was, for all intents and purposes, destroyed. Kong Guxi had long been prepared for this and was not surprised. Though his grief was profound, he still set about stabilizing the situation.

The fact that he had now abandoned the Wasteland to rush here for an audience was due to a single reason: Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing, had not been seen in four months, while Daoist Master Yehui was unharmed and had appeared multiple times in Shanji Prefecture.

Even more damning were the rumors spreading among the great clans and immortal sects: Daoist Master Zhaojing had been attacked by Yehui and another Daoist Master working in concert. Whether he had fallen was unknown, but at the very least, he was said to be gravely wounded somewhere in the Eastern Sea.

The news had made Kong Guxi’s legs weak. Hearing further that the northern Funan territory was under attack, he used it as a pretext to come to the island and seek an audience with Li Jiangqian.

Now, as cultivators ignored him or shot him disdainful looks, whispering amongst themselves, Kong Guxi’s heart grew heavier. Behind him, Kong Qiuyan knelt obediently, not daring to even lift her head.

After a long wait, a voice called from above.

"Lord Kong, the Young Lord will see you".

Kong Guxi quickly gathered his robes and hurried up the steps. Passing through two sets of hall doors, he saw a young man in dark red robes seated in the main chair. It was Li Jiangqian, the current head of the household. Standing beside him was a woman in a cloud-silk dress—Li Que'wan.

Li Jiangqian had been sitting in this hall for five sleepless days. It wasn't just him; the entire Li family's upper echelon was in constant motion, while the lower ranks were silent with fear. To put it bluntly, the entire clan was frozen in a tense silence.

The situation was incredibly difficult. Kong Guxi was no longer the master of the Profound Peak Gate; he was someone to be avoided. Without access to information, he couldn't grasp the situation, but even he could smell that something was terribly wrong. How could others not?

Though the young man before him was only at the Qi Refining realm, Kong Guxi bowed with the utmost respect.

"Greetings, Young Lord".

"Lord Kong, you're too polite".

Li Jiangqian seemed calm, showing no signs of panic as he replied evenly. "Is there an urgent matter, my lord?".

Seeing Li Jiangqian’s composure, Kong Guxi felt a measure of his own anxiety subside. His main purpose for this trip was simply to see the Li family's state for himself and get a sense of his own position. He didn't dare ask too many questions, instead saying respectfully, "We were guarding the Wasteland when a group of cultivators arrived from the east. They claim to be from Crimson Reef Island and wish to gather qi. I did not dare to stop them... so I came to ask the Young Lord first".

Li Jiangqian subtly clenched his fist within his sleeve. "Gather what qi?" he asked in a low voice.

Kong Guxi replied, "The Guo family members said they wish to gather the qi of the people's lament. Over in Shanji Prefecture... Daoist Master Yehui has already given his approval. I still have half a million people in the Wasteland, all loyal followers. Their grief is potent; one can act as ten. The Guo family hopes to gather qi there".

'They came so fast...' Li Jiangqian thought, falling silent for a moment.

The relationship between the Li family and Crimson Reef Island was extremely tense. Although their Purple Mansion masters had yet to meet, there was no shortage of enmity between their subordinates. Crimson Reef was also on friendly terms with Capital immortals Dao, making this group's arrival a highly complex matter.

If Li Ximing were actually at home, waving them away would be a trivial matter. The fear was that with Li Ximing absent, Capital immortals Dao and Crimson Reef Island were colluding, using this as a pretext to interfere on the Eastern Shore.

'Daoist Master Yehui of Capital immortals Dao fought with our Daoist Master. He must be certain our Daoist Master is not at the lake. This is trouble...'.

He nodded. "I understand. Please wait for a moment, my lord. I will consult my elders and give you a reply".

Kong Guxi nodded quickly and retreated, his heart pounding with fear. Some things didn't need to be asked. Just by making this trip, the atmosphere of the situation told him more than enough.

After the man had left, the great array of the hall sealed shut. Li Jiangqian sat down, a hint of exhaustion on his face. "Wan'er," he said quietly, "I know your cultivation is important, but I had to call you out. This matter is too great".

Li Que'wan asked, a little uneasily, "The Daoist Master...".

"It's true. He has not returned for several months". Li Jiangqian rubbed his wrists. "His absence is a small matter; Capital immortals Dao's reaction is what's truly alarming. Situ Mo has crossed the mountains again and is eyeing Funan covetously. Capital immortals Dao has already consolidated its hold on Shanji Prefecture, and the situation on the Eastern Shore is growing more unstable".

"Elders Minggong and Chenghui have both gone to Funan, and Ding Weizeng and the others have gone to the Eastern Shore. Father is in seclusion. If a fight breaks out, we can only save either the Wasteland or Funan".

"What is the elders' decision?" Li Que'wan asked.

"Save Funan". Li Jiangqian’s gaze was heavy. "As I see it, if Capital immortals Dao pushes south, Purple Smoke Gate and the Sword Gate cannot sit idly by. Shanji Prefecture is easy for Capital immortals Dao to attack but hard to defend; they cannot hold it for long. Once some compromise is reached and they withdraw, the Wasteland cannot be held either".

"And if the Wasteland falls, the Xiao family will also be uncomfortable. Funan belongs to our family alone, but the Wasteland does not. It is easier to retake the Wasteland after it's lost than to save Funan once it has fallen".

Li Que'wan nodded in agreement, then added worriedly, "But this matter with Crimson Reef Island...". She paused, glanced at her brother, and then continued, "Right now, only the Purple Mansion realm and the other immortal sects know our Daoist Master is missing, so we can maintain a calm facade. But the next step is for everyone, inside and out, to know our family is in trouble... Since you are preparing countermeasures, brother, even if the Wasteland is abandoned, our weakness will be exposed sooner or later".

Li Jiangqian sighed. "Kong Guxi isn't making a scene. He hasn't shed a single tear. He's too perceptive. If a stupider leader had come and thrown a fit, our family would have the perfect excuse to abandon the Wasteland, let him rebuild the Profound Peak Gate as a buffer, and delay our weakness from being exposed...".

After a moment of thought, Li Jiangqian summoned a subordinate. "Go and make it clear to Kong Guxi. Crimson Reef shouldn't even think about causing trouble on our territory. If they want to gather qi of resentment, they can go back to their own overseas domains and collect it. They have more than they could ever use; why come to our home?".

After the man left, Li Jiangqian pulled out a letter, his brow furrowed with impatience. "I'll write to Jiangxia at once. The Wasteland can be lost, but the people of Profound Peak must be evacuated. Tell that boy to keep himself alive. If he dies at the hands of Capital immortals Dao or Crimson Reef, I, his older brother, will have to avenge him".

Li Que'wan nodded silently. She saw another figure approach from below, emerging from the shadows like the wind. He was clad in pitch-black Dharma robes with a black jade pendant at his waist, his expression grim. Li Jiangqian quickly stepped back and bowed respectfully.

"Grand-Uncle".

Li Chenghuai nodded. "I've just returned from the north. Capital immortals Dao has made a move. They've sent a man named Wang He to consolidate the power of the Wang clan in Jiangbei".

The Funan Wang clan was involved in the family's strategic layout around Xiaoshi Mountain in the north and was also key to Funan's stability. This was no small matter. "What happened?" Li Jiangqian asked. "Our family is in some trouble at the moment, and Wang Quwan is in seclusion at the lake. With the head of the Funan Wang clan absent, I fear they won't be able to stand against Wang He's influence...".

To his surprise, Li Chenghuai shook his head. "The one in charge of the Wang clan... is Wang Quwan's younger brother, Wang Quyu. He went against all opposition and barred Wang He from entry, refusing to see him. He then led a contingent of his clansmen from their home to meet your brother. They have already been integrated into the various mountain defenses and are standing guard together".

Li Jiangqian nodded slowly, pacing back and forth twice. It was the first piece of good news he had heard in a long time. Li Chenghuai also seemed pleased. "I thought that when trouble started, Funan would be the first to become unstable... After all, a large portion of the Wang clan's main branch is still under Capital immortals Dao's domain. For them to provide timely aid like this and stabilize Funan...".

"Although we still can't rule out the suspicion that they're placing bets on both sides, this move from the Wang clan is undeniably beneficial. Once this is over, they should be rewarded".

Li Jiangqian nodded. "The Wang clan has deep roots in Jiangbei; they have the capital to hedge their bets. With his own sister in seclusion at our lake, he naturally couldn't meet with Wang He. This just goes to show that Wang Quyu has excellent control over his branch of the family".

Li Chenghuai sighed. Li Jiangqian then recounted the situation with Crimson Reef Island, and the good mood from the news vanished. "The cultivators of Crimson Reef are difficult to deal with," Li Chenghuai said. "Their Merging Fire arts are exceedingly venomous, damaging one's life force and essence. We should consult with Brother Chenghui on this".

***

**The Eastern Shore**

In the center of the Eastern Shore's dense forests, and further east still, stood a mountain at the border between the Wasteland and the Eastern Shore proper. It was not particularly grand, but it was covered with numerous towers and pavilions, bustling with cultivators coming and going.

In the main hall at the mountain's peak, a burly, golden-eyed man rose from his meditation, his breath flowing like light. As he stepped down, several of his trusted aides immediately approached him, bowing respectfully.

"Third Young Master!".

Li Jiangxia lifted his chin. "How much time has passed?".

"Reporting to my lord, two months have passed".

Li Jiangxia's cultivation talent was extremely high, second only to his elder brother Li Jiangqian's within the family, and his resources were first-rate. He never worried about cultivation bottlenecks, only about whether his foundation was solid enough or if he had mastered enough arts. He had spent two months breaking through to the fifth layer of Qi Refining and still felt he had energy to spare. He asked in a deep voice, "Have you seen the Daoist Master?".

He was in command of the various families on the Eastern Shore, and his generous and forthright personality had naturally attracted a group of loyal followers, including many minor officials. Upon hearing his question, they all hesitated and shook their heads.

Li Jiangxia's expression immediately darkened. He had them report the latest news, and his eyelids twitched as he listened. "Where are the various lords stationed?" he asked again.

The cultivators bowed their heads and mumbled evasively. One guest elder stepped forward. He seemed to be from the Wasteland, at the early Qi Refining realm, and had only pledged allegiance in recent years. His surname was Fu, and he had switched his allegiance from the Profound Peak Gate early on.

He seemed rather clever. "Reporting to the Young Master," he said with a smile, "my family received news from Kong Guxi. Lords Minggong and Chenghui are both in the Funan territory".

Li Jiangxia looked up, taking note of the man. He glanced around and waved his sleeve. "Everyone, return to your duties. There's no need for so many of you here...". He paused, a faint, unreadable smile on his face. "Guest Elder Fu, you will stay".

The crowd hastily departed, leaving only a few of his personal aides in the hall. Just then, a Jade Court Guard brought a letter up from below. Li Jiangxia began to read it as he spoke. "You have good sources of information".

He scanned the letter in his hand and saw that his family's elders were indeed in Funan. He understood at once.

'Crimson Reef Island is also getting involved... Li Jiangqian intends to abandon the Wasteland... It's not a bad strategy, and it's easy to relocate the Profound Peak Gate's cultivators. But Li Jiangqian, oh Li Jiangqian... have you considered the half-million common people in the Wasteland?'.

'Crimson Reef Island, Capital immortals Dao—which of them isn't looking to make a profit? The moment we abandon this place, those two won't play your game of relocating people to bolster Shanji... They will be eaten clean and taken away!'.

Frustrated, he waved the Jade Court Guard away. The guest elder, Fu, was pleased with the praise and stepped forward. Seeing that only Li Jiangxia's confidants remained, he cupped his hands and whispered, "Young Master, Capital immortals Dao is watching like a tiger, and their troops will surely march east. The Wasteland and the Eastern Shore have benefited from your grace for years and are both your pillars; neither should be lost. I hope the Young Master prepares early".

Li Jiangxia stood with his hands behind his back. "What preparations?".

Guest Elder Fu lowered his voice. "When Capital immortals Dao attacks, first abandon the strongholds connecting the shores. When the enemy reaches Funan, you can dispatch troops to the Second Young Master's side to relieve his pressure. Then, when the Profound Peak arrays can no longer hold, you should cede the Wasteland and retreat to the Eastern Shore. The various lords will surely come to your rescue. The Wasteland may be lost, but the Young Master's own forces will be completely preserved".

Li Jiangxia understood his meaning instantly. He glanced at the man. "You mean the elders would come to rescue the Eastern Shore, while Funan is caught between the Golden Tang Gate and Capital immortals Dao, its rear cut off by cultivators crossing the river. My second brother's forces would be utterly routed, losing both land and men".

Guest Elder Fu simply smiled without a word. He watched as Li Jiangxia put away the letter and looked up at him. Those golden eyes flashed as he lifted his foot, revealing a boot of black iron with gold trim. Fu was stunned. "Young Master, what is...".

*BAM!*

He felt a massive force slam into him as a heavy kick landed squarely on his chest, accompanied by the sound of cracking bones. His entire body flew through the air, crashing into a pillar with a loud boom and then tumbling, breaking several more pillars before spitting out a mouthful of blood.

"Pfft!".

Li Jiangxia’s gaze was glacial, as if he were about to devour the man alive. He took a step forward, and with a sharp *shing*, he drew the sword from a nearby aide's scabbard. The bright blade pointed directly at Guest Elder Fu's forehead.

"You son of a bitch... My brother and I might squabble amongst ourselves, but that's for the Li clan to take power from the Li clan... What the hell are you? You dare come here to sow discord and play these treacherous games?!".

Guest Elder Fu didn't know where Li Jiangxia got such strength. A burning pain spread through his chest. He opened his eyes to see a pair of ruthless golden pupils staring back at him. The easygoing and generous young master was gone, replaced by someone with a terrifyingly cruel edge.

"Young Master!".

Li Jiangxia pressed the sword to his neck. An aide, who knew this man was courting death but hadn't realized how badly, quickly tried to intervene. "The Fu clan is, after all, an external family of Profound Peak. At this critical time... it is not advisable...".

'Profound Peak...'.

Li Jiangxia paused. He grabbed the man by his collar and lifted him into the air with one hand. The young man was already powerfully built, and Fu broke out in a cold sweat from the pain. He heard the youth's cold voice say, "If your words were to leave this room, everyone from Profound Peak would have to kneel on Pingya Island, and Kong Guxi would have to flay you alive to protect his ancestral lineage!".



# Chapter 764: Threats

Hefted the man, Li Jiangxia tossed him to one of his trusted aides and paused briefly before giving the order.

"Send him to Kong Guxi."

The confidant departed with the man. Only then did a youth who had clearly been waiting for some time step into the hall. He approached and bowed.

Li Jiangxia’s attitude softened considerably. "Xuantong, you’ve arrived just in time."

An Xuantong was the most outstanding cultivator of his generation in the An clan. A year older than Li Jiangxia, he was already at the Qi Refining realm. He had been in seclusion in the dense forests, mastering the *Art of the Azure Cliff and White Smoke*, a third-grade cultivation method from the Jiang family lineage. This technique only became viable again after the spiritual qi was restored following the return of the Jade True.

He looked weary from his journey. Clasping his fist, he retrieved a jade pendant from his sleeve.

"Young Master, I just came from the forests. Lord Cui passed along a message. This jade has been nurtured by his own spiritual sense. If the situation in the Wasteland changes, crush this talisman, and my lord will come to provide reinforcements."

"Good."

Li Jiangxia tucked the item into his sleeve and strode forward, listening as An Xuantong continued in a low voice, "I heard that Profound Peak Gate has lost its authority. The minor clans on the Wasteland border are wavering, sending feelers out to Capital immortals Dao. Neither side is stable."

Li Jiangxia remained unconcerned. "Ignore them for now. Ultimately, they are Profound Peak’s people. If they truly defect to Capital immortals Dao, it is Profound Peak that loses face. My older brother is the definition of vengeful; the clan is keeping detailed records. When this situation stabilizes... they will pay."

He turned the question back on him. "Elder An... is missing... and with so much happening, has the An clan remained stable these days?"

An Xuantong answered respectfully, "The An clan has been loyal for five generations; we are old vassals of the household. The entire family worries for the clan's affairs. Several of my younger brothers have come out of seclusion, and the elders repeatedly petitioned to come east and fight Capital immortals Dao to the death. Fortunately, the elder lord stopped them..."

Unlike the reserved An Siwei from the previous generation, An Xuantong clearly had a mind of his own. Li Jiangxia knew these were not empty pleasantries; the An and Chen families were the most deeply entangled with the Li clan, bound securely to their war chariot. The moment the Li family showed instability, those two families grew the most anxious.

"Elder Zheyan is old," Li Jiangxia replied. "There is no need for him to risk himself again. These matters are for the younger generation... Is Pei Xie out of seclusion? I will go see him. You handle things here."

An Xuantong nodded quickly. "Lord Pei is currently managing affairs in the Wasteland."

Pei Xie was a rogue cultivator from the Wasteland and one of Li Jiangxia’s closest friends, whom he had known for five or six years. This rogue cultivator was highly talented, and though somewhat older, he had relied on resources from Li Jiangxia to reach the late stage of the Qi Refining realm.

As Li Jiangxia’s most trusted subordinate, An Xuantong had already arranged everything. He reported Pei Xie’s location, saw Li Jiangxia off, and then returned to seek out another attendant.

An Xuantong asked about the incident with the guest elder. After listening to the explanation, he fell silent for a moment and sighed.

"A timely word cannot save a ghost destined to die. That man Fu Jie has a suicidal nature. I suppressed him time and time again, but he just assumed I was afraid of him stealing the spotlight. The moment I went into seclusion, he ran off to get himself killed."

He let out a cold laugh. "So be it. Did the Young Master send him to the Lake... or to Profound Peak?"

"Reporting to my lord, he was sent to Profound Peak."

An Xuantong understood immediately.

'He's afraid the Eldest Young Master (Li Jiangqian) will exploit this against Profound Peak... It seems the Third Young Master still pities the common people of the Wasteland. This means that even if we must retreat, he’ll try to block Capital immortals Dao and save more people for the Eastern Shore.'

'But sending him there... puts Profound Peak in a difficult spot. Fu En was, after all, loyal. This is bound to chill some hearts.'

Having anticipated the fallout, he immediately began preparations. He retrieved several scrolls and had some cultivators deliver them to his quarters. After a moment's hesitation, he returned and sought out someone to carry a message to the Lake.

"Profound Peak's mountain gate has fallen," he said quietly, "and Fu En died catastrophically during his breakthrough. This is already an extremely sensitive matter. At this critical time, this Fu Jie refused to keep a low profile and instead courted his own death. He is finished. The Fu family is unlikely to survive this. If anyone begs for mercy, the main family absolutely must not agree."

***

The Wasteland.

Kong Guxi felt a chill rise from the soles of his feet as he returned from Moongaze Lake. Behind him, Kong Qiuyan hurried off to issue orders to the sect members. The Gate Master walked quickly toward the main hall, where, as expected, a crowd was waiting.

Their expressions varied. Some were families and former sect members who had fled Shanji Prefecture, desperate for a place of refuge. Others were local cultivators from the Wasteland border whose mountains had been seized by Capital immortals Dao, here to beg for aid. More still were members of the Kong clan itself.

The new Profound Peak mountain gate was not even as spacious as their original gate's reception peak. Now, crowded shoulder-to-shoulder with people, the grievances aimed at him, the Gate Master, threatened to blot out the sky.

Before Kong Guxi could speak, a gray cloud descended from the heavens. The mountain fell instantly silent as a voice boomed from above:

"The Guo clan of Crimson Reef Island has come to visit the Kong clan. Please show yourself!"

Crimson Reef Island had a terrible reputation. In an instant, the refugee cultivators and the opportunists alike scattered like the wind. Kong Guxi understood his own predicament clearly; seventy percent of his sect was disloyal, but he never realized it was this porous.

'I haven't even walked out the door... and they're already here.'

A middle-aged man in ornate red robes descended from the gray cloud. He was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm, his cultivation clearly honed to its limit. He wore a token at his waist, and behind him, a retinue of Crimson Reef cultivators stood in array. Though the man’s features were grim, the display was imposing.

"My lord, I..."

Kong Guxi moved to greet him, but the man cut him off coldly.

"Guo Hongjian, of Crimson Reef Island."

Although Kong Guxi did not recognize the man, he knew from his bearing that he was from the direct lineage. He quickly gestured to the main seat. Guo Hongjian ignored him, refused the tea that was offered, and demanded, "That matter of gathering qi. Have you asked your masters?!"

Kong Guxi’s expression changed drastically.

When Crimson Reef first asked, they addressed the "Kong clan," not Profound Peak. Now, this man did not call him Gate Master, and referred to the Li family as "your masters." The implication was that Profound Peak was destroyed, and the Kong clan were nothing but servants.

While this wasn't far from the truth, it was a reality that neither the Li family nor Profound Peak was willing to acknowledge. All other visiting powers had afforded them basic courtesy. How could they compare to Crimson Reef Island?

Kong Guxi swallowed his rage and replied respectfully, "Daoist Guo, I have received a reply. The Wasteland is a chaotic warzone. Capital immortals Dao watches us like a tiger, ready to strike west at any moment. Your esteemed clan wishes to build palaces to gather qi, but I fear the war will interfere. It is simply not convenient for your sect to operate here."

Guo Hongjian was not interested in the polite refusal. He knew the roundabout answer meant no.

"Your Profound Peak? *Your* Profound Peak?" he spat. "You have to ask the Li clan's permission for everything. What Profound Peak do you have left to speak of! A few remnants! We should be praised for not simply crushing you, and you stand here playing games with me!"

Kong Guxi gritted his teeth, but Guo Hongjian stepped closer, his voice rising.

"Surnamed Kong! Back then, regarding the Radiant Sky Stone affair, wasn't it your family that instigated things? How many times did you sow discord? My sister entered the inland seas on orders, and wasn't it your people who blocked her at Lake Xian, forcing her to reroute and miss her chance! All the little tricks your Profound Peak has pulled over the years! Today you dare to dither with me? If we truly settle old debts, none of you have enough lives to pay!"

Behind them, Kong Qiuyan’s face went white. Kong Guxi lowered his voice. "The decision regarding the gathering of qi was made at the Lake. It is not something a minor cultivator like myself can decide. My lord does not need to take his anger out on me."

"Then go get the Li family member!"

Guo Hongjian was no stranger to the Li family. He had crossed blades with Li Qinghong during the North-South conflict and had nearly captured Li Xijun while escorting the Radiant Sky Stone. His clan had sent him here for a precise reason.

'They just want me to probe Li Xi... Daoist Master Zhaojing. I'm only afraid I can't make *enough* trouble!'

He barked, "I see you're nothing but a sniveling servant. Get the Li representative here!"

Kong Guxi retreated silently, whispering to an attendant, "Go to the forest and request their presence."

Only then did Guo Hongjian take a seat. A short while later, a figure strolled into the hall. He had refined brows and steady eyes; while not stunningly handsome, he possessed a graceful air, draped in purple robes. Guo Hongjian glanced at him. "Who are you?"

Cui Jueyin had just rushed over from the dense forests. His Cui family was also an Eastern Sea power; he knew exactly what Crimson Reef Island cultivators were like, and the relationship between their two families was poor at best.

"Cui Jueyin of Moongaze Lake," he answered calmly. "I govern the dense forests and manage the Wasteland on the Eastern Shore."

Guo Hongjian sipped his tea. "Not a Li... a Cui will do just fine. Crimson Reef wishes to gather qi in the Wasteland. Your clan simply needs to cede a piece of land."

The youth opposite him remained perfectly composed. "It is not that Moongaze Lake is unwilling to lend the territory. Your esteemed clan uses Merging Fire, and gathering qi in this manner harms living souls. The inland is not the outer seas. Such an act against cosmic harmony cannot be permitted. Hengzhu and the Sword Gate both uphold the righteous path and will not tolerate such actions."

Before Guo Hongjian could explode, Cui Jueyin continued, "This is our family's concern. We fear, Daoist friend, that you will perish here and damage Crimson Reef's reputation. However, if you have no such fears, I can report this matter again and ask the Lake."

Guo Hongjian’s expression turned ugly. Seeing Cui Jueyin’s calm demeanor, he sneered, "If Moongaze Lake cannot help me with this, and I receive no news in three days... then it doesn't *have* to be Moongaze Lake. Once Capital immortals Dao crosses the border, I shall be able to gather qi in the Wasteland all the same."

Hearing the threat, Cui Jueyin gave a mild, flat bow. "Daoist Guo speaks reasonably. By all means, wait for Capital immortals Dao to cross the border, then you may gather your qi. When Capital immortals Dao invades, and your Crimson Reef acts as their accomplice, killing everyone... let us see how the Sword Gate and Purple Smoke Gate react."

His voice turned cold. "Daoist friend, you ventured inland. Be careful not to cross a line and die here in the Wasteland. Crimson Reef wouldn't even be able to say a word."

Guo Hongjian laughed in fury. "Good, good... I truly want to see who your family intends to send to defend the Wasteland."

Though Cui Jueyin’s cultivation was lower, his aura did not yield an inch. "As you wish, Daoist friend. Just don't laugh too soon, only to be slapped to death here in the Wasteland by a Daoist Master."

Cui Jueyin flicked his sleeve and departed.

Guo Hongjian was suddenly uncertain. This was, after all, a matter of life and death.

'I must visit Daoist Master Yehui’s mountain gate and listen to his divine instructions,' he thought. 'This Cui seems to have a strong background. I need to investigate him.'

Guo Hongjian likewise stormed off, riding the wind away. The confrontation had ended badly for everyone, but Kong Guxi, waiting at the side, felt a wave of relief. He wasn't afraid of them fighting; he was afraid that the Li family would back down and negotiate.

When the hall doors were sealed and the array was activated, Kong Guxi finally spoke. "Cui Jueyin was strong. The Lake must still have an ace up its sleeve."

Kong Qiuyan nodded, answering fearfully, "I hope so."

Kong Guxi sighed. "Our mountain gate is gone. Regardless, Profound Peak owes the Fu family. We must care for their descendants in the future."

Kong Qiuyan only nodded. Kong Guxi studied the haggard look on her face. The ordeals of the past two years had clearly broken her spirit. That unique composure belonging to the disciple of a great house was gone, replaced by a constant, forward-looking terror. The sight left a bitter taste in Kong Guxi’s mouth.

"Yan’er," he said, "my vision was too shallow... Back then, when the North-South conflict was looming, the sect discussed a marriage alliance with the Li clan. I held onto the empty airs of an immortal sect, feeling that you should not marry down..."

"After Li Xicheng died, Aunt Tingyun even had you meet Li Xijun. You, too, felt he was a great character. But the idea was shot down by us old stubborn fools and arrogant fools... Otherwise... otherwise..."

Kong Qiuyan was silent for a long moment before she replied. "Otherwise what? Otherwise the sect would be better off today? Or perhaps, otherwise I would simply be a widow by now? My lord, although you act with the sect in your heart, you cannot say such things. I still have sect duties to attend to. I will take my leave."

She exited through a side door, leaving Kong Guxi stunned by the response. Just then, a frantic, chaotic banging echoed from the main hall doors.

Kong Guxi still felt hollow, but his body reacted first. He moved to open the door and found an elder man knocking urgently. Kong Guxi stared blankly as the door opened, revealing a figure bound and pressed to the ground in the courtyard, wearing rich robes, his face obscured.

The elder, Kong Guli, his face flushed red, whispered, "Gate Master, Fu Jie provoked the Third Young Master, intending to harm the direct lineage! He was captured and sent here... The Third Young Master’s meaning is... for the Gate Master to handle it himself."

Kong Guxi’s vision went black, and he nearly collapsed. He steadied himself and asked, "Is this... Elder Fu En’s direct kin? Fu Jie... yes, I have heard that name."

Seeing the man beside him nod, Kong Guxi felt his mouth go dry. The Fu clansman knelt on the hall floor, moaning, mumbling incoherently. Kong Guxi was lost. He grabbed his brother by the arm.

"Wasn't he called clever? Brave? Always saying shocking things? How could he fall so low as to sow discord!"

No one answered him, least of all Kong Guli, who didn't know the specifics. The man on the floor just whimpered, unable to speak clearly. Kong Guxi finally managed to summon the guards who brought him, and after listening to their report, he felt a fire consuming his heart. He stalked forward, grabbed Fu Jie by the collar, and snarled:

"Was this the time to be clever? You are a child of this sect, sheltered for generations! How could you interfere in the affairs of an Immortal Clan... trying to be a petty strategist..."

The wound on Fu Jie’s chest had not healed. His pale lips trembled. Mortally terrified that Fu Jie might actually speak, Kong Guxi slammed him back onto the ground, interrupting his words. With a sharp *shing*, Kong Guxi drew his sword and hacked down with all his might.

He struck in such a hurry that with a wet tearing sound, the man before him was split in two. Blood, bile, and viscera spilled out, splashing across Kong Guxi’s feet.

The Gate Master stumbled back a step and threw the sword down with a clang. Dizzy, refusing to look at the remains on the floor, he ordered, "Quickly! Send someone to thank the Third Young Master!"



# Chapter 765: Inquiries, Before and After

**Funan.**

The main mountain of Funan seemed much emptier than before. A young man in silver armor and black robes stood at the peak, with six ancient-style silver tokens hanging from his waist. His long spear was planted in the ground beside him, occasionally sparking with motes of lightning.

A woman in a red palace dress, holding a six-pointed brazier from which a feather-like flame danced, quickly ascended to join him. The young man looked up wearily, setting aside the thin paper in his hand.

"Elder Sister, you've come. Is Situ Mo here? What word from Weizeng?"

"No," Li Minggong shook her head, her expression heavy with worry. "There's no need to worry about Weizeng. Bringing him into the family back then was an exceptionally wise decision. He can hold his own now and is completely loyal. With him watching the front lines and us stabilizing the rear, Situ Mo will not move easily."

"I came this time because I received news from the main family..."

She handed the letter to Li Chenghui. The young man read it, his calm expression shifting to surprise. "Fu Jie was killed..."

They exchanged a look. Li Minggong sealed the hall doors and lowered her voice. "It no longer matters which young master is using this to weaken Profound Peak's prestige and influence. In short, the matter is trivial. What's important is Crimson Reef Island. Guo Hongjian appearing in person—that is a major event."

Li Chenghui read the letter twice more. "Jiangqian is ruthless, decisive, and willing to sacrifice Profound Peak. Jiangxia, though arrogant, prefers the open and righteous path and feels pity for the common people. This arrangement is correct. There is no need for us to be reassigned."

"As for Crimson Reef Island... let Guo Hongjian do as he pleases. The man doesn't look very bright; in truth, he relies entirely on Yehui's instructions. We can only wait."

Li Chenghui pondered this for a moment, confused. "But Capital immortals Dao is being far too polite to our family. Ever since they conquered the mountain gate, they haven't seemed particularly keen on avenging themselves against Profound Peak or Kong Haiying. Otherwise, why would there still be no reaction after all this time?"

Just as Li Minggong was about to answer, the hall fell deathly quiet. The great array shuddered slightly. The tightly sealed doors rattled violently, as if pushed by some unseen force.

*Creee...*

The hall doors swung open naturally, from the inside out. A cold wind rushed in from outside. Li Chenghui felt the wind, bone-chilling and sharp, and shot up from the main seat. His heart sank.

'Purple Mansion!'

To a Purple Mansion realm expert, the mountain's array was no different than air. For such a cultivator to bother pushing the door open upon entering was already a sign of considerable friendliness. Regardless of who the visitor was, neither of them had the right to remain standing. They moved to the side, bowing low to welcome the guest.

"We juniors of the Li clan respectfully welcome the Daoist Master," Li Minggong said deferentially. "We wonder which esteemed personage has graced us..."

A figure in a simple brown robe materialized before them, faintly radiating a profound and mysterious light. Neither sibling dared to look up.

"We pay our respects to the Daoist Master," Li Minggong said.

The Daoist Master's voice was surprisingly amiable, though it carried a heavy, deep resonance.

"No need for such ceremony! I am Sumian, the Abbot of Xuanmiao Temple. I searched the seas for several circles, but I never found a trace of the Daoist Master, so I came here to ask you two."

They quickly guided him to the main seat and stood respectfully to the side. Only then did they see the Daoist Master's true appearance: he was dressed as a layman, appearing middle-aged. Age did not show on his features, but his voice was deep.

"Rumors are flying everywhere, and going directly to the Lake is inconvenient. Seeing as you two are both here, I turned aside to ask... has Daoist Zhaojing returned?"

Li Minggong hesitated instantly. But facing a Daoist Master, she couldn't exchange a glance with her brother. In that brief moment of hesitation, Sumian sighed.

"No need to hide it. The sea is in chaos; I heard the news as well. Pursued by Changxiao. I am just asking for any sign, any trace of his whereabouts. Any small bit of news would keep the two of us from being this worried."

Li Chenghui couldn't coordinate a story with his sister, so he could only listen as Li Minggong replied, her voice fraught with worry, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, we have not returned to the Lake for several days, but we have received no news whatsoever of the Master's return... We do not know his current situation."

Sumian studied Li Minggong, as if discerning something. After a long moment, he demanded, "Then where is Li Zhouwei?! Things are in such a mess, and he still hasn't come out to stabilize the situation? Must he wait for Capital immortals Dao to attack?! Without him here to stand guard, how can a few of you possibly withstand their plots!"

At Sumian's sharp question, Li Minggong looked awkward. She had no choice but to answer, "The Family Head has gone into seclusion..."

Sumian flicked his sleeve, appearing impatient. "Any time would be better than this one! Your Lake is not some great nexus of spiritual qi; his breakthrough will probably take even longer!"

Li Minggong paused, then said hesitantly, "Yes... a breakthrough from Foundation Establishment can be long or short. We juniors cannot predict the time... Our direct lineage..."

"Enough!"

Sumian cut her off with a wave of his sleeve before she could finish. "You two just focus on defending Funan. You don't need to worry about the Wasteland. I will go find Yehui and ask him for the details."

The two quickly expressed their thanks. When they finished bowing and rose, the Daoist Master had already vanished. Li Chenghui felt a deep sense of unease. He hesitated twice, but the question he wanted to ask remained unspoken.

Li Minggong’s worry only deepened. She paced the hall anxiously. "Daoist Master Sumian usually manages nothing, but in a true crisis, he appears..."

Li Minggong stopped abruptly. Li Chenghui also looked up, thoughtful. He had detected a strange floral scent in the air. A clear breeze drifted in from the courtyard, hovered, and then coalesced in the hall, forming a person.

This woman wore an autumn-yellow satin robe embroidered with butterfly patterns. Her face was lovely, with thin eyebrows and two small dots of teal pigment at the corners of her eyes. The moment she appeared, she raised a hand to stop the siblings' movements, frowning.

"Chenghui... Minggong... it is you two, correct?"

They understood immediately: the previous Daoist Master had barely left, and a second one was already in their hall. They had no choice but to retreat to the side and bow respectfully. "We pay our respects to the Daoist Master."

The female Daoist Master kept frowning, though her voice was melodic and gentle. "Rise... I am Daoist Master Tinglan from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. I have a question or two for you. There is no need for such ceremony."

She seemed to briefly scan the hall’s furnishings. "Has a Daoist Master with willow-leaf eyes, carrying a bright lantern, been here to find you?"

She paused for the briefest instant, then asked, "Never mind... *has any* Daoist Master been here to find you?"

Li Minggong replied respectfully, "Daoist Master Sumian was just here..."

She recounted the entire previous conversation. The female Daoist Master paced one step in the hall, then sat down in the main seat, silent.

Her makeup was exquisite. As she sat there quietly, she was as refined as a divine statue. Illuminated by the dawn light, a faint, weak rainbow halo pulsed behind her head. Daoist Master Tinglan’s expression, however, was not beautiful. Her eyes had even turned somewhat sinister.

The satin-robed Daoist Master narrowed her eyes slightly and spoke, enunciating every single word.

"I just came from Xuanmiao Temple. Old Daoist Master Qi is right there in the temple. He has not moved at all."



# Chapter 766: Capital immortals Dao's Choice

The moment she spoke, the entire grand hall fell silent.

'The Daoist Master Sumian from earlier was fake!'

Li Minggong was shaken, a profound chill flooding her mind. The siblings stood frozen by the side of the hall, a suffocating, bone-chilling pressure filling the air. Behind her, Li Chenghui’s earlier suspicions were instantly resolved, replaced by that same cold dread.

"That person was probing for information," he thought. "He asked about Zhouwei... his entire purpose was to ask about Zhouwei...".

How could a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator possibly see through the divine abilities of a Purple Mansion expert?. If that wasn't Sumian, who was it? Yehui? Changxiao?.

The thought flashed past like lightning, only to be replaced by a second, more terrifying one.

"If the first Sumian could be fake... how do we know this Daoist Master Tinglan is real?!".

Tinglan, meanwhile, lowered her gaze in thought. Seeing the two so shocked and suspicious they couldn't speak, the satin-robed Daoist Master tapped the table, her voice laced with doubt.

"He probably isn't Changxiao. While Changxiao's Life Divine Ability isn't primarily focused on confusing the mind, deluding you two would be trivial. To disguise himself as Sumian... logically, it must be someone whose Life Divine Ability is still incomplete.".

Her voice was gentle, giving them a moment to digest the information. Seemingly reaching her own conclusion, she asked again, "Your family head. Where is he currently in seclusion?".

For a second, the air in the hall seemed to vanish. Li Minggong froze.

While everyone in the clan knew Li Zhouwei was in seclusion, there was no specific news about *where*. But it wasn't hard to guess... the place where spiritual qi gathered, the nexus where Bright Yang converged, it had to be Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

As the Daoist Master before them repeated the question, Li Chenghui stepped forward and answered honestly, bowing, "His seclusion was a matter discussed between the Daoist Master and the Family Head. It should be somewhere on the Lake. As for the specific mountain, we do not know.".

Tinglan listened and shook her head, her expression turning serious. "Fine. I will ask you only one thing. What is the status of Zhaojing's soul lamp?".

Without hesitation, Li Chenghui bowed. "The soul lamp is fine, I ask the Daoist Master to rest assured. If something had truly happened to our Daoist Master, the rising Bright Yang would have illuminated an entire domain. The Eastern Sea shows no such phenomenon, which is proof enough.".

"I know," Tinglan nodded grimly.

"There is no phenomenon in the Eastern Sea, otherwise your family wouldn't be in this state. As long as Zhaojing is still alive, Li Zhouwei’s seclusion will not be disturbed. Things will just be... rather difficult for a while.".

She rose and paced down from the main seat. "I heard," she said softly, "that your family still holds a token to my Blessed Land, left by that old Ling Yanzi back then. My Blessed Land happens to be accepting disciples these days, and there are still spots remaining. Ling Yanzi's own lifespan is nearing its end, and he is anxious to pass on his legacy. Send a few people over.".

Having said her piece, she vanished from the hall like a gust of wind. The two bowed deeply to see her off. Long after she was gone, Li Minggong finally stood up, feeling a chill crawl up her spine. "Brother," she whispered, "Foundation Establishment cultivators cannot see through divine abilities. Never mind one transforming into another Daoist Master, even if one transformed into our own ancestor... how many of us would be able to tell?".

Li Chenghui’s expression was heavy. He picked up his spear from the side. "Whether we can see through it or not, we must act as if we can't. The best course is to say less. Daoist Master Tinglan mentioned the old story and clarified the path to the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. It probably wasn't an impersonation.".

He fell silent for a moment, avoiding any mention of Li Ximing or Li Zhouwei. He only asked, "Who among the Jiangque generation is suitable for Purple Smoke?".

Li Minggong saw the exhaustion in his eyes and knew not to press the other matters. "Purple Smoke primarily accepts female cultivators, and their requirements are strict. I think Queyi is the most suitable, but several of the children can go and try. Whoever ends up staying can join the Purple Smoke Gate.".

"Then they must go," Li Chenghui said, then hesitated. "However, given the current turmoil, our family's direct descendants should not be traveling, and we have no spare manpower for an escort. Write a letter first. Invite Senior Ling Yanzi to come here as a guest. He can take them back with him when he leaves. That will avoid complications.".

The young man put his brush down, resting it on the edge of the table. "It's just... although Queyi is an obedient and clever child, she lacks her own opinions. With the family in such trouble, once she's on someone else's territory, who knows if she'll be bullied...".

Li Minggong stepped forward, placing her brazier on the table. "We cannot predict the future," she comforted him. "If she enters Purple Smoke, she will at least have a life-saving talisman, and one's temperament is not set in stone. It used to be said that Elder Brother Chengliao was the accomplished one, I was too soft, and you were too reserved. Aren't all of us holding our own now...?".

Li Chenghui finally nodded. At the mention of his brother, Li Chengliao, a deep weariness crossed his face. "Brother Liao... if he were here, the family would be much more stable. The younger generation is not what it used to be; they lack discipline. You and I were forced to take up this burden halfway through and have no energy left to manage them.".

He finished writing the letter to Purple Smoke and handed it to Li Minggong, just as a figure rushed frantically into the hall. He was white-haired, his face a mass of wrinkles, his back hunched—it was Qu Bushi.

The old man’s clothing and provisions had improved greatly; at a glance, one might mistake him for the patriarch of some lesser clan. But his face was stricken with panic, and he had lost all composure. "My lords!" he reported, "Situ Mo has made his move! Capital immortals Dao's forces have also reached the river's edge! There are already calls for help from the northern border!".

Li Chenghui’s form instantly dissolved into lightning and shot out of the hall. Li Minggong exited with Qu Bushi, who was visibly frantic. Li Minggong tried to reassure him in a low voice, "Old senior, do not worry. Funan is heavily defended. The people coming this way are merely a diversion to tie us down. Their main army has gone to the Wasteland, greedy for plunder.".

Qu Bushi didn't know the larger picture; the news of Li Ximing's disappearance alone was enough to terrify him. Having scraped by in the Eastern Sea for a hundred years, the old man only held one truth in his heart:

'It doesn't matter who is greedy for what, east or west. It doesn't matter what you lose, as long as you have your Purple Mansion expert. If you lose your Purple Mansion expert, nothing you gain matters...'.

The two sped onward and saw rolling golden qi to the west; a battle had already erupted. Li Minggong squinted into the distance. Li Chenghui’s ocular arts were stronger than hers; he saw the distant figures first, decisively changed direction, and his heavy voice echoed back:

"Capital immortals Dao's attitude is ambiguous, and they didn't send many people. You all will be enough to resist them. I am going to reinforce Ding Weizeng. Situ Mo has been coming year after year; it's become too easy for him. If we don't beat him until it hurts and kill a few Golden Tang Gate members, that old bastard will never learn restraint...".

Li Minggong tossed the Chongming Profound Insight Screen into his hands. Li Chenghui immediately vanished in a streak of lightning. Hearing his words, Li Minggong’s pounding heart finally began to slow.

'Capital immortals Dao... why did their attitude suddenly soften...?'.

A streak of light rapidly approached from the horizon, while another figure rode the wind from the front. She was at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, with somewhat captivating features, but dressed in plain robes and holding a sword. She skimmed across the water; it was Miaoshui.

Miaoshui had once been a cultivator of Dense Cloud Cave and had some friction with Li Minggong. But when she surrendered years ago, Li Minggong had personally pleaded her case. Minggong was generous, magnanimous, and willing to bend; after a few friendly overtures, the old grudges were naturally never mentioned again.

In their last clash with Capital immortals Dao, Miaoshui had nearly perished, saved only by the intervention of the Daoist Master. Having hovered on the brink of death, Miaoshui’s temperament had changed considerably, and her cultivation had improved. Seeing Li Minggong, she wore a grave expression.

"Minggong, you're here. We just received word from the Northern Brocade River King. Guan Lingdie is leading a group of Capital immortals Dao cultivators this way. Gongsun Bofan and Song Yunbai are right behind her... there are six in total.".

With Li Chenghui and Ding Weizeng occupied with the Golden Tang Gate, their side consisted of Li Minggong, Qu Bushi, Miaoshui, and Elder White Ape. There was also Sun Bo, a guest elder originally from Profound Peak, still on the mountain. They were clearly outmatched in strength.

However, the moment Li Minggong heard that Guan Gongxiao was not present, she knew he must be leading the main force to attack the Wasteland. She let out a heavy sigh of relief. After all, besides Li Zhouwei, the Li family currently had no one who could handle the Capital immortals Dao Young Lord. If he had come personally, it would have been a catastrophe.

"Daoist Friend Miaoshui," Li Minggong said, already prepared. While crushing a jade pendant to summon reinforcements from the family, she retrieved a chain of small, cold-iron rings from her sleeve, all engraved with Pit Water patterns. There were eighteen silver rings, each no larger than a fist.

She pressed them into Miaoshui’s hands. "This is Capital immortals Dao's own artifact, the Pit-Metal Encircling Chain. Use it for now. This artifact excels at entanglement and imprisonment; you've tested it a few times before. Leave Gongsun Bofan to me...".

Although their side was short two people, Li Chenghuai was just across the river on the north bank, only a moment away. He wore the Supreme Feather Night-robe and carried the Yang family's Night Ghost Secret Talisman, which could summon Foundation Establishment-level yin-qi puppets. He could easily stall two opponents.

Since Guan Gongxiao had not come, and Guan Kan had been killed by Li Zhouwei long ago, as long as they blocked Guan Lingdie and Gongsun Bofan, defending Funan would not be difficult. They wouldn't even need Cui Jueyin for support, freeing him to reinforce Profound Peak.

Miaoshui accepted the artifact and nodded. With a light gesture, the chain of cold-iron rings began to weave through the Converging Water around her wrist. Li Minggong soared upward on her fire, activating her Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier and Pure Feather Li-Fire simultaneously, unleashing countless red and white plumes backed by soaring flames.

As expected, a woman in a colorful skirt and azure ribbons flew in from the north, tall and slender. Gongsun Bofan, still in his straw cloak, stood beside her holding his saber. The scattering of cultivators behind them were clearly not famous figures.

Li Minggong glanced at them from afar, recalling Li Chenghui's words. As the group drew near, she bowed slightly and said, "Daoist Friend Lingdie.".

Guan Lingdie, who had been extremely hostile the first time they clashed, showed little malice in her eyes today. Seeing Li Minggong bow, the woman instinctively raised her hand, almost returning the courtesy. Her hand reached her chest before she remembered she was here to pick a fight. She awkwardly retracted it. "Ming... Li Minggong...".

Guan Lingdie recovered quickly, adjusting her attitude and stating calmly, "In the battle on the river years ago, my Capital immortals Dao narrowly lost. Today, we find this opportunity, and wish to spar a round or two with our Daoist friends!".

This statement stunned not only Li Minggong, but even the guest elders on Capital immortals Dao’s side. Only Gongsun Bofan, looking thoughtful, gripped his saber tighter and watched the group calmly.

Li Minggong simply summoned her feather-fire and nodded. "Please!".

***

**Shanji Prefecture.**

At the Profound Peak Gate, the mountains were as majestic as ever, but the ground was a scene of utter ruin. Palaces, pavilions, and even the courtyards on the mountainsides were in disarray. All manner of items were scattered across the steps; the place had clearly been looted clean.

Black-robed Capital immortals Dao disciples could be seen moving about the mountain gate. Some held brushes, transcribing array formations; others held jade vases, suctioning spiritual fire and spirit water from the treasure grounds. After draining them, they didn't bother to destroy the arrays but simply walked away, heading to the summit to deliver the spiritual items.

Despite invading another's mountain gate, there was a strange sense of order to their actions. The Capital immortals Dao disciples were highly disciplined, each working silently at their tasks, only occasionally hiding a spiritual item or spirit stone in their sleeves, without any fighting or commotion.

Following the steps upward, spiritual qi billowed from the great cavern of Profound Peak's main summit. Upon the jade seat where Changxi had meditated for centuries, a youth in a deep blue Daoist robe was now seated. He had a rather sharp chin and could be considered handsome, but his expression was not pleasant.

The Daoist Master tossed a brownish-yellow token up and down in his hand. Kneeling before him was a man in black Daoist clothes, his face marked with several black lines. A white silk ribbon tied at his waist trailed on the ground as he pressed his forehead respectfully to the floor.

"Paying respects to the Daoist Master!".

Hearing this, Yehui, seated above, finally turned his gaze to Guan Gongxiao. This young lord was very talented and extremely respectful. Yehui had always found him useful, so he gave him an extra look. "You are obedient enough.".

Guan Gongxiao said reverently, "The Daoist Master is as lofty as Mount Taishi, his vision spanning ten thousand miles. This junior has only a mouse's short-sighted view and would never dare defy you.".

Yehui ignored the flattery. "This is clearly the Li family's weakest moment," he said quietly. "Do you know... why I ordered you to sit here and do nothing?".

Guan Gongxiao hesitated. "Daoist Master Zhaojing?".

Yehui gave him a heavy look. "If you couldn't even see that, you wouldn't need to be the Young Lord. Right now, whoever moves against the Li family is just a spear for Changxiao, to be used to force out Li Zhouwei. This holds zero benefit for my Capital immortals Dao. You must understand, Li Ximing is a cultivator who is deeply bound to his family. If you grievously wound *him*, he might just dust himself off, walk away, and maybe even greet you the next time he sees you. But if you were to kill Li Minggong and force Li Zhouwei to appear...".

Yehui paused briefly. "Then you, Lingdie, and everyone in Capital immortals Dao, up and down, would have to be ready to face the Profound Light from the Great Void... at any time.".

Guan Gongxiao nodded slowly. "But... our sect is already enemies with the Li family. To do nothing... to just let this pass...".

But the Daoist Master said softly, "You think our few conflicts made us mortal enemies? No. As long as you and Lingdie didn't die... and Li Zhouwei and Li Chenghui didn't die... this entire affair can be spun as me helping *him* (Zhaojing) build his reputation. It was just part of the standard process of carving up Profound Peak.".

"The only event truly worth debating was me driving him from the Eastern Sea. And even that, I can claim I was *used*... Do you understand?".

Guan Gongxiao listened, looking slightly bewildered. He watched the Daoist Master continue.

"In this world, the truth is never what happened. It is what it *can be*, and what both sides *need* it to be for their mutual benefit. Changxiao is strong, and I was coerced by him. That is enough.".

"Teaming up with someone like Changxiao, one single misstep, and you will be the one carrying the blame for him. I have already handled this affair delicately enough...".

Yehui stood up, passing the brownish-yellow jade token from his left hand to his right. He raised an eyebrow.

"Since he, Li Ximing, was willing to cede the mountain gate, and Kong Haiying is now dead at my hands, what irreconcilable hatred remains between us?. Changxiao still wants me to take the fall for him? How could such a wonderful thing happen in this world?".



# Chapter 767: Retreat

Guan Gongxiao clasped his hands, still confused. He lifted his head, his forehead no longer pressed to the floor, and his voice remained low.

"This junior is dull... I still do not understand. According to the reports from the surrendering Profound Peak disciples, the one in the secret chamber was Fu En. Daoist Master Zhaojing investigated it, and when I later took his belongings, everyone also said it was Fu En."

Before Yehui could answer, Guan Gongxiao bowed respectfully again.

"This junior understands the Daoist Master's meaning—that all things can be weighed. But Kong Haiying was a Purple Mansion seed and exceptionally talented. How can this be compromised? If we simply let this be glossed over, and Kong Haiying breaks through, I fear he will be no less a threat than Li Ximing."

A flicker of approval finally appeared in Yehui's expression. He nodded, and with a pinch of his thumb and forefinger, he flipped the brownish-yellow jade token in his hand, revealing the golden character carved upon it.

【Kong】

The Daoist Master spoke softly.

"How could I not know? I have met Kong Haiying personally. We fought, we drank together, we even allied to deal with that pig-headed Guo E. I am familiar with his aura. I would not mistake it."

His gaze grew complex. "The one in that secret chamber was Kong Haiying. The aura was clear. Everything else might be wrong, but that point is undeniable."

Understanding dawned on Guan Gongxiao. He replied respectfully, "This junior understands! This is the Li family's 'sincerity.' They spread the news that it was Fu En to save face, while in reality, they handed Kong Haiying over to us as a tacit plea for peace... No wonder... no wonder..."

With that piece solved, everything else clicked into place. He continued, "Therefore... the heavy defenses at Funan and the emptiness of the Profound Peak Wasteland follow the same logic. If not for the Daoist Master's guidance, this junior would have nearly blundered into disaster!"

Yehui's gaze, however, did not rest on him. It drifted past, settling on the 'Kong' character in his hand with an illusory emptiness. His heart felt hollow.

'He is well and truly dead...'

Guan Gongxiao was still thinking, stating respectfully, "Daoist Master, rest assured. The Kong clan's lineage... I will wipe it out..."

He was halfway through his sentence when Yehui shot him a weary look. The Daoist Master's eyes were sharp-cornered, and his exhaustion only made them look more vicious. Guan Gongxiao froze instantly.

"Give Purple Smoke Gate some face," Yehui said coldly. "Kill, kill, kill... You've come all the way from the overseas to Jiangbei, and all you can think about is killing. Look at the Chengyun Gate over there. Learn from Zhong Qian! Chengyun Gate is already the leader of Jiangbei's righteous path, and you are still here, obsessed with killing!"

Guan Gongxiao bowed in terror. "This junior knows his crime!"

Yehui slapped the jade token onto the table. "When you are inland, you follow inland rules! You must play their games. If I hadn't made that trip personally back then, Gongsun Bofan would have defected to Chengshui Marsh long ago. Why would he ever serve you, Guan Gongxiao!"

Guan Gongxiao lowered his head. "There are half a million commoners in the Wasteland who hate Capital immortals Dao. If we do not use them as blood food, we are leaving countless enemies behind!"

A flicker of real anger stirred in Yehui. "Still thinking with that overseas brain !" he cursed. "Li Chenghui already showed you how it's done, and you still haven't learned! Why is the Dense Cloud territory still in chaos? When you take the Wasteland, you do not touch those half-million people. You show great magnanimity. Then you turn heaven and earth upside down—depose the main branches of the lesser clans and elevate the secondary ones; support the outsiders and punish the insiders. The foundation of Profound Peak, its people, will instantly dissolve. They are about to be absorbed by Purple Smoke anyway; they won't have a chance to correct it. By then, they'll only have one or two Foundation Establishment cultivators left. In three generations, the hatred will vanish!"

Guan Gongxiao could only nod in agreement.

Daoist Master Yehui continued in a calmer tone, "From now on, I will not show my face often. Baiye will do the same. Dismantle the great clans, carve up the spirit fields, and forbid annexations. We will no longer walk the path of blood-qi. We will operate as a righteous path."

Guan Gongxiao whispered, "Many of the Dao methods in our sect rely on blood-qi. We will have to rely on our overseas footholds for supplies."

Yehui shook his head. "Learn from the North. Apply heavy pressure and exploitation, forcing those below to secretly refine blood-qi themselves. Then, we shall 'exorcise demons and defend the Dao.' And just like that, the blood-qi is ours. You can learn something from every direction... You still have much to improve upon."

"Learn from the Li Clan's centralized control over the populace, but not their rigid self-restraint. Learn from the Golden Feather Sect's laws against annexation, but not their defensive lack of ambition. You can learn how Chengyun Gate manipulates public opinion to pose as righteous, or how Xuanmiao Temple tricks its disciples into bitter cultivation, all to gather qi for their Daoist Master... Even Situ Mo, that opportunist... his methods are worth your study."

"And that blood-qi. From now on, our own disciples use less of it. Using it to heal injuries is fine, but don't let people see you walking around radiating turbid energy, looking like an obvious demonic cultivator!"

The Daoist Master stood and paced down from his seat. Glancing at Guan Gongxiao's expression, his voice finally took on a trace of solemn gravity.

"Your aunt died early, before she could bear me an heir, and I am too tired to remarry. Capital immortals Dao will belong to you and your Guan clan in the future. If not for your mother's dying wish, I would have lost patience and replaced you as Young Lord long ago. I would never have taught you this much. You would do well to remember that."

Guan Gongxiao was overcome with gratitude. He knocked his head respectfully on the floor three times. "Uncle's guidance will be remembered, every word. The Daoist Master is the Lord of Capital immortals Dao, today and for a hundred, even a thousand years. Gongxiao will serve you faithfully, without a second thought."

"Haha!" Yehui laughed twice, then cursed, "Scram... You certainly learned how to flatter quickly enough."

As Guan Gongxiao retreated, Yehui was struck by a moment of contemplation. He stood and murmured to himself.

"Having a descendant like Gongxiao may not be a bad thing. Someone brilliant like Li Zhouwei is too risky; if he doesn't ascend to the clouds, he plunges into the abyss. Someone weak and mediocre like Kong Guxi is just talentless trash destined for ruin. And those like Zhong Qian or Li Xijun are gifts from heaven, far too rare. Someone who is simply willing to learn and willing to listen... that is enough."

***

**The Wasteland.**

As the sky darkened, Kong Guxi stepped out of the hall, only to see a crowd of people rushing up the peak. The old man leading them was his own brother, Kong Guli, his face a mask of shock and terror. He yelled:

"Ninth Brother! Capital immortals Dao is attacking!"

The situation was so urgent that Kong Guli forgot all honorifics, shouting his sibling's ranking. Kong Guxi was too stunned to care. His hands and feet went numb. "How many?!"

Kong Xiaxiang, standing to the side, had long since lost the arrogance in his brow. "We heard the Capital immortals Dao Young Lord, Guan Gongxiao, is leading them personally! There are more than ten Foundation Establishment cultivators. The sky is filled with the light of their techniques! Our scouts took one look from afar and fled back immediately."

"I already went down to give the order, telling the main lineages and cultivators in every prefecture to escort the populace and retreat. Most of them are loyal..."

"Guan Gongxiao is here!"

Kong Guxi was terrified. He gritted his teeth. "We already had evacuation plans, but they came so fast... We won't be able to stop them. I fear few will survive..."

As he spoke, Kong Guxi immediately turned back into the hall. "Qiuyan! Grab everything!"

Just as Kong Qiuyan acknowledged the order and turned to leave, a massive explosion tore through the sky. A gray cloud blazing with fierce flames appeared, casting a white-hot crimson glare across the heavens as rings of clouds shot toward them.

*BOOM!*

A torrential rain of Merging Fire poured down, smashing into the mountain's defensive array and causing it to shake violently. The great hall swayed, forcing Kong Guxi to ride the wind and burst through the array's barrier.

The figure in the sky stood atop a cloud-ring, wielding a token of Merging Fire, his back lit by billowing gray flames. Who else could it be but Guo Hongjian?

"Kong remnants! Come out and die!"

As the Gate Master of Profound Peak, Kong Guxi was not lacking for artifacts. With a light flick of his sleeve, he summoned a pale green mountain peak and a deep black banner. Grasping the flag, he sent the mountain flying up to meet the flames.

"Daoist Friend Guo, why such burning anger!"

He already hated Guo Hongjian to the bone, but he couldn't afford to offend Crimson Reef Island. Even with a belly full of rage, he couldn't let a single sharp word escape.

He had only just activated his artifact when the scalding Merging Fire crashed down, covering his defenses and causing the artifacts to groan and crackle. He heard incantations from the other side and vaguely saw a red light speeding toward him.

Merging Fire damages one's essence and life; it was one of the most insidious Dao lineages. He wouldn't dare let it strike him, frantically raising the black banner to defend himself.

But Kong Guxi had little talent to begin with and had spent the first half of his life as a wastrel with almost no combat experience. Guo Hongjian, while not particularly bright, had survived numerous life-and-death battles. He feinted, then unleashed a rope of fire from his other side, attempting to hook Kong Guxi's artifact.

*CLANG!*

Fortunately, Kong Guli arrived in time. The old man was far more experienced in fighting. He thrust out a spear, hooking the fire-rope and triggering a blinding flash in the air. Guo Hongjian was just about to shout a threat to boost his own morale when a thunderous roar erupted from below:

"Dog thief!!"

A man in a golden-armored mask burst upward, spear in one hand, axe in the other. His face was hidden, but the eyes visible through the mask were shot with crimson blood. "Do not harm my Profound Peak Gate Master!"

He shot through the flames like a streak of golden light, splitting the cloud-ring with his axe and sending Guo Hongjian stumbling back. Only then did Kong Guxi manage to escape. He looked up to see radiant light bloom in the sky as the white Steps of Radiance descended. Cui Jueyin appeared, saying softly:

"Gate Master, leave this to me! Take the others and retreat first."

Kong Guxi scrambled back. He tried three or four times but couldn't extinguish the flames clinging to his artifact; his own robes were beginning to smolder. Kong Guli stepped closer, helping him put out the Merging Fire as the other Kong Foundation Establishment cultivators gathered around.

Kong Guxi looked at the black clouds massing on the horizon. Fu Yuezi was fighting with extreme ferocity; his Immortal Foundation, 'Heavenly Gilded Helm,' activated, he glowed with golden light, coordinating with Cui Jueyin's techniques to tie down their opponent. But more figures were flying in from the distance. Kong Guxi was horrified.

"Capital immortals Dao attacks with such force. What of Moongaze Lake?"

"We heard Capital immortals Dao forces are attacking Funan, and Situ Mo has also taken the opportunity to push south. Funan is in peril!" Kong Xiaxiang replied.

Kong Guxi shuddered. "The Situ family... they were once our allies, and now it has come to this... What do you all advise?"

Kong Guxi had already ordered Kong Qiuyan to pack their valuables. The meaning was obvious. The others, no matter how slow, understood. They bowed.

"Capital immortals Dao's momentum is too great. We must retreat."

Kong Guxi wailed, "But... but the Wasteland still holds the people of my Profound Peak."

Several men immediately grabbed him to pull him away. Kong Guxi's mouth cried in sorrow, but his feet were very soft. With just two tugs, he was moving, taking off on the wind. The group flew away like a gale, nearly leaving Kong Qiuyan, who was still gathering the valuables, behind.

Kong Qiuyan, her expression awkward, hurried to catch up with the other disciples. Kong Guxi immediately ordered, "Quickly! Inventory the spirit items and artifacts!"

The Foundation Establishment cultivators hurriedly began taking stock. Having already lost their mountain gate once, losing their new headquarters didn't seem quite so painful. Only a few disciples, whose families were still in the Wasteland and now likely lost, began to sob quietly.

Kong Guxi dispatched a few of them, instructing in a low voice, "I have already crushed the jade talismans. Every prefecture knows to flee. If you are worried, you may go and provide support."

Most of the Profound Peak disciples who remained loyal were related to the Kong clan by blood or marriage; their relatives had already been transferred to the Lake. Only a few held local defensive posts not far from here, so they scattered to assist them.

Kong Guli felt uneasy. "Gate Master, we are abandoning our territory and fleeing. Will Moongaze Lake punish us?"

"It should... be fine..." Kong Guxi paused, lowering his head. "Capital immortals Dao came with overwhelming force. The Daoist Master will likely be relieved that we simply survived. As for punishment... it shouldn't be too severe..."

He sighed. "Never mind Guan Gongxiao, we also had that peak Foundation Establishment cultivator Guo Hongjian. His Merging Fire is ferocious. We are not his match. If we had been any slower, and one of them caught us, we might not have kept our lives. If the other one joined, escape would have been impossible."

The group stood in silence. After a while, the eastern sky was covered by the black clouds, and Moongaze Lake's first mountain on the eastern shore, [Dense Forest], gradually came into view. Only then did Kong Guxi's terror truly set in. He looked back several times and whispered:

"Go see the Third Young Master first. Li Chenghuai... we can pay respects to him later..."

He sped toward the eastern shore boundary, only to find the area bustling with cultivators moving back and forth; it was far from stable. Kong Guxi landed and sent someone down to ask. A moment later, a man descended quickly from the main hall—tall, with golden eyes and long hair, walking with a steady gait.

"Third Young Master!"

Li Jiangxia had been run ragged these past few days. The hearts of the people in the Wasteland were unsettled, requiring him, a direct descendant, to personally stabilize many situations. Now, with Capital immortals Dao attacking, the trouble had multiplied.

Though Li Jiangxia looked worried, he was still polite to Kong Guxi. He nodded curtly. "What is the situation in the east? I saw Lord Cui's light heading over. Did he intercept them? Is the Gate Master injured?"

Kong Guxi replied, "It is shameful. The Capital immortals Dao forces came too quickly. Guo Hongjian is powerful. Daoist Friend Cui intercepted him. Crimson Reef Island harbors ill intentions. I did not dare remain and retreated early. I am not injured."

Not long ago, Li Jiangxia had bound Fu Jie and sent him over, and Kong Guxi had endured the pain of executing him personally. But both men tactfully avoided the subject, acting as if there was no friction between them.

Li Jiangxia merely lifted his head slightly. "The Profound Peak populace is still in the Wasteland. Has the Gate Master arranged for disciples to bring them to the eastern shore?"

Kong Guxi found it difficult to speak. He paused before saying, "There were arrangements. But Guo Hongjian arrived too quickly. We... fled in panic and lost our composure. But I have sent disciples to clean up."

Hearing this, Li Jiangxia lowered his gaze and nodded. He asked again, "The primary lineages of the minor clans and the orthodoxies of the small temples under Profound Peak's rule. Were they brought out?"

Kong Guxi grew uneasy. "No... But they received the message. We will count them when the time comes, and see how many were saved."

Li Jiangxia lifted his chin, thoughtful. "Since the Gate Master has already escorted his disciples here, have them fall back to the eastern shore. Proceed to the border between the shore and the Wasteland, and according to the situation, support Lord Cui's retreat."

Kong Guxi nodded repeatedly. Behind Li Jiangxia, An Xuantong sighed inwardly, bowing his head in silence.

'What a pity. The foundation of Profound Peak... finally reduced to nothing. Standing before me is truly no longer the Gate Master of Profound Peak, but merely a remnant of the Kong clan!'



# Chapter 768: The Fiend

**The Ends of the World.**

The small island was thick with dense jungle, threaded by the movements of wild beasts and dotted with numerous native stockades. Spiritual qi was thin, but at the island's center boiled a bottomless azure spring. Several azure creeks flowed out from it, vanishing into the forest.

A cultivator in black robes sat cross-legged by the pool, guarding it in silence. After most of the day had passed, a brown-robed cultivator finally sped over, landing by the spring and clasping his hands.

"Daoist Friend Feng, I borrowed the Lishu Fire-Averting Cover."

The cultivator named Feng leaped up from the poolside, his earlier stillness clearly just a pretense. "Many thanks, Daoist Friend Fang! Quickly, bring it out!"

The man surnamed Fang retrieved a bright red jade pearl from his sleeve, his voice full of reluctance. "You must be careful... I had to pledge my family heirloom, the Wuting Talisman Brush... and even added a spirit stone as rent. If that brush weren't so unique, they never would have let it go..."

Cultivator Feng glanced at him, speaking patiently. "Relax. I've been to this island many times. The savages here were raised in this place by my own great-ancestor, conveniently left for his descendants to use. He was so afraid of them producing someone powerful that he never even taught them to write."

"This island has always been barren of spiritual qi. When I came today, I found the island suddenly had a faint aura, all of it originating from this great boiling spring at the center. There must have been a change in the earth-veins."

He took the jade pearl and infused it with his spiritual qi. It immediately swelled and expanded, transforming into a red barrier covered in runes that enveloped them both. Feng led the way, sinking into the lake while speaking.

"I once visited Lord Xia, an alchemist in the Admirable Sea. He mentioned that a spring, azure in color, that erupts powerfully from the earth with a rising intent, is called a 'Cave Spring' when it reaches the point of transforming water. A remarkable Dao lineage inland cultivates this. They call it 'Pristine Water'."

Daoist Friend Fang asked, "Pristine water? What kind of Pristine water? What level of expert does one become after cultivating it?"

Cultivator Feng shook his robes and pointed upward. "Naturally, higher than the sky."

The surrounding lake water was growing hotter. Fang said in alarm, "Higher than the sky? A Foundation Establishment cultivator's Dao lineage!"

Cultivator Feng smiled without speaking, shaking his head. "That's called Purple Mansion! It is the lineage of a Purple Mansion cultivator! Don't be fooled by how impressive those island lords look moving mountains and filling seas. A true expert of that lineage could kill them with a single glance."

He changed the subject. "Regardless, the object in this cave is capable of making the entire area boil and filling the whole island with spiritual qi. It must be a Foundation Establishment-level spiritual object. As long as we get our hands on it, you and I won't have to worry for the rest of our lives."

Fang sighed. "I rely completely on your guidance, Daoist friend. I am just a mixed-qi cultivator. What good would a great treasure do me? Daoist Friend Feng, at least you have pure-qi. Once you obtain this opportunity and ascend step by step, do not forget to lend me a hand."

As they spoke, they had already entered the earth-vein. On both sides, scalding steam mingled with flames, blasting the artifact and making it hum. Cultivator Feng was clearly struggling to power it, and he handed control to his partner. His face changed.

"How tyrannical! We haven't even reached the depths of the earth-vein... where did such terrifying earth-fire come from!"

Fang's lineage was clearly inferior to his; he had never even seen earth-fire before. He could only pretend to nod. Feng's expression shifted several times before he gritted his teeth.

"How many medicinal pills do you have left!"

Fang mumbled the meager contents of his pockets. Feng made a decisive choice.

"We both have enough pills. Since we have already come this far, how can we return empty-handed? We must go deeper into the vein and see. Even if we can't take anything, at least we will know what is down here!"

He gritted his teeth and pushed his spiritual qi, flying downward for several more minutes. Finally, the steam ahead of them thinned. The subterranean flames flickered, and they vaguely saw an open space.

The cavern floor was made of smooth stone slabs, carved with countless complex patterns. At the very center, on a platform resembling an altar, danced a plume of deep black fire.

A rush of excitement flooded their minds. Before they could even recover from the shock, Cultivator Feng took advantage of a moment when the flame dimmed to scan the area. He vaguely spotted a skeleton sitting next to the fire!

The skeleton sat cross-legged and appeared to have been dead for many years. A glittering, metallic-looking storage bag lay beside it, gleaming dazzlingly in the firelight.

Cultivator Feng's heart pounded as greed consumed him.

'The sitting-place of a deceased cultivator! My opportunity has come!'

He immediately began to back away, whispering urgently, "I can't hold on much longer! We must leave, quickly!"

Both men were spent forces, and the surrounding flames were beginning to flare brighter with the earth-vein's cycle. Fang could already feel his feet burning. He nodded frantically, and the two vanished back into the sea of fire.

Long after they departed, only the vast flames remained. On the ground, the skeleton's finger twitched. Flesh and skin instantly reappeared, and a white-gold Daoist robe shimmered back into existence, revealing a proper face.

Li Ximing let out a long, deep breath, feeling a sense of relief.

"Someone came!"

Li Ximing was trapped by Changxiao's Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art. The moment he left this spot, the flame on his body would flare like a beacon, so he could only use spiritual items to suppress it. Months had passed, and he had already used more than a dozen drops. His only hope was for someone to come from the outside.

"This spring is subtle; it doesn't draw attention and looks like a natural change in the earth-veins, so it won't cause a major disturbance. The downside is... very few people come. After waiting for months, a single Qi Refining layer-one cultivator finally shows up!"

A Qi Refining cultivator was naturally useless. If Li Ximing hadn't intentionally suppressed his flames, the two men wouldn't have even been able to see him. He left them alone, letting out a long line to catch a big fish.

'Qi Refining is far from enough... I need at least a Foundation Establishment cultivator... only then is there a possibility of escape.'

The only Purple Mansion-grade healing item in his possession was a single Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill. He still had plenty of treasure medicines and supplementary herbs in his storage bag. Li Ximing was, after all, a Purple Mansion Alchemist. Over the past few months, he had slowly formulated a path to healing. Unfortunately, it required a Foundation Establishment demon beast as the primary ingredient. Sitting here paralyzed, he certainly couldn't refine it.

'Lure a few Foundation Establishment cultivators here, find a way to make them gather a few spiritual items for me... and then capture a Valley Water demon beast. Then I can devise a way to refine a pill... and suppress this injury first.'

He pondered briefly, then borrowed the power of the Immortal Mirror. His spiritual sense leaped out, watching the two men depart. Before they had even left the island, the black-robed Cultivator Feng, seeing that his partner's spiritual qi was exhausted, drew his sword and, in a flash, cut him to pieces.

'Truly decisive... Now he doesn't even have to return the artifact. He can just keep it for himself.'

Li Ximing coldly watched Cultivator Feng leave the island, a strange feeling rising in his heart.

'So now *I'm* the old Purple Mansion fiend suppressed in an earth-vein, just like in the stories... just waiting for some foolish kid to accidentally release me, only to be utterly slain by him with an immortal sword after seventy-eight chapters of twists and turns. What a beautiful story.'



# Chapter 769: Deeper into the Mist

Moongaze Lake.

A black shadow flashed past. The man, clad in dark robes, raced forward on the wind, leaving a chilling trail of gray mist in the air. He wore the Supreme Feather Night-robe, an artifact adorned with foot-long black tassels that shimmered with iridescent light at their tips, accelerating his speed with every moment.

To put it bluntly, the Supreme Feather Night-robe was the finest Dharma artifact the Li clan possessed. Li Xizhi had exhausted countless resources to acquire it; it was doubtful a better robe could be found in all of Jiangnan among those beneath the Purple Mansion Realm.

The two-finger-long piece of black jade in his hand was unremarkable, appearing merely as an impure trinket. But Li Chenghuai knew this Night Ghost Secret Talisman was far more extraordinary.

The rest of the Li family believed the talisman could only summon an entity at the Foundation Establishment level. Li Chenghuai, however, understood it was a genuine ancient artifact capable of far more than just summoning a night-ghost. Its true potential was simply beyond his current level of cultivation.

Soon, the landscape of Funan came into view. The sky above it was a blazing mix of red and white flames. Li Chenghuai pushed his speed, riding the wind until his form blurred and faded like water.

Li Minggong stood in mid-air holding her brazier, spiritual fire surging to block Guan Lingdie. Nearby, Miaoshui, Elder White Ape, and even Qu Bushi were locked in desperate combat. Clearly outnumbered, the Li allies were pale and hard-pressed.

'My brother isn't here...' Li Chenghuai mused. 'Li Chenghui must have gone to rescue Ding Weizeng.'

He retrieved the black jade from his sleeve, placed it in his palm, and tossed it lightly into the air.

A fierce gale erupted. Swirling motes of yin qi coalesced into a dancing vortex of blackness, from which a magnificent, horned yaksha emerged. Wielding a trident of dark energy, it charged straight into the ranks of the Capital immortals Dao.

The yaksha possessed considerable power. It dissolved into black mist and descended upon the cultivators, immediately unleashing a frigid wave of energy that disrupted their techniques. It followed by sweeping its trident, throwing the Capital immortals Dao formation into chaos.

Li Chenghuai himself materialized from the shadows directly beside Guan Lingdie, his own sword drawn, unleashing a brilliant white slash of sword-light as large as a ship's sail.

Startled, Guan Lingdie’s form dissipated like smoke. Li Chenghuai shook his robes, his own body flickering as he prepared to pursue, when a soft voice sounded next to his ear.

"Little brother, no need to be so fierce!"

Li Chenghuai instantly recognized the voice of his elder sister, Li Minggong. Though shocked, his reflexes were sharp; he immediately slowed his attack by half a beat, letting the sword-light strike empty air as he sent back a spiritual transmission: "What is..."

Li Minggong, who had already formed suspicions, replied concisely, "The Capital immortals Dao is merely going through the motions. Their real goal was to destroy the Profound Peak Gate's foundation. Now that it's come to this, there's no need to fight them to the death. Just keep them occupied."

Understanding dawned on Li Chenghuai. He engaged, coordinating his attacks. His techniques and swordplay were fundamentally sound, and he pressed the assault. Guan Lingdie, now facing two opponents, likewise fell back, refusing to be drawn into a desperate fight.

Guan Lingdie was the stronger cultivator; even when holding back as if in a spar, she had completely suppressed Li Minggong. Now, with the pressure relieved, Li Minggong finally had a moment to think. The Capital immortals Dao's peculiar attitude, combined with the words of Daoist Master Tinglan, rushed back to her.

'If the real enemy isn't the Capital immortals Dao, but Changxiao trying to destroy my family... was chasing our Daoist Master out to sea truly his only plan?'

She poured spiritual qi into the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier. Flames mixed with the distinct red-and-white down of Pure Feather Li-Fire billowed forth.

'Based on what Daoist Master Tinglan implied... Changxiao probably hasn't returned either. But if he orchestrated this plot long ago, seeking something our family possesses... wouldn't this be the moment for that plot to manifest?'

'If that's the case, the Daoist Master who disguised himself as Sumian is almost certainly the other Purple Mansion cultivator from Changxiao Gate: Daoist Master Chengyan!'

Daoist Master Chengyan was famous for never emerging from seclusion, but given the circumstances, it wasn't unreasonable for him to finally appear. Li Minggong’s nerves tightened. 'What instructions did Changxiao leave for Chengyan? That Daoist Master came here to gather intelligence; he must be about to act!'

She felt lost in a dense fog, unable to see the path clearly.

'Is defending Funan the right move or the wrong one? But even if we abandon this place and retreat to the north bank... as long as our Daoist Master doesn't return, will we ever know peace? It just means moving the target for their schemes back to the north bank!'

***

Elsewhere over Funan, the sky was heavy and dark. Fierce winds howled as golden light clashed with resounding cracks of thunder.

Li Chenghui stood amidst the storm, his robes billowing as he held his long spear horizontally, treading upon bolts of lightning. Thunder descended from the heavens, striking the air before him and condensing into a torrential waterfall of lightning that crashed downward.

He had arrived riding the thunder, catching them by surprise. Descending from the sky with the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman, he had struck down a Golden Tang Gate guest elder with nine consecutive bolts to rescue Ding Weizeng. Now, besides Situ Mo himself, the Golden Tang Gate still had three other Foundation Establishment cultivators clustered around their leader, jointly fending off Ding Weizeng.

This was Li Chenghui’s first time fighting Situ Mo directly. Although his Dao lineage held no specific advantage, his artifacts countered the Golden Tang Gate’s techniques. By joining forces with Ding Weizeng, they managed to suppress the group.

Now, Li Chenghui beckoned. The six punishment talismans immediately spun around his wrist, unleashing a gushing wave of silvery-white brilliance. "Where Yang culminates, the Six Thunders are born!"

A blinding flash erupted as runes lit up sequentially on the six slender, elegant tokens. In response, Situ Mo casually tossed out a golden shield.

*BOOM!*

Billowing black smoke surged from the impact. Fortunately, the golden shield was not an artifact powered by blood-qi and managed to hold. Situ Mo instantly drew his saber, blocking the thunder spear that shot out from the smoke with a sharp *CLANG*.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

Li Cheng’s thunder spear danced, each blow seemingly suppressing the Golden Tang Gate Master, yet Li Chenghui’s expression was far from relaxed.

'What is Situ Mo playing at...'

This was too strange. The man fighting him now was not performing at the level expected of the Golden Tang Gate Master. Situ Mo was a veteran Foundation Establishment cultivator who had long ago begun practicing secret arts. Even with the Chongming Profound Insight Screen high above suppressing his golden needles and saber, he should never be such an easy opponent.

Li Chenghui’s gaze darkened. The Gate Master opposite him seemed almost dazed. His sister had always described Situ Mo as "suspicious, cunning, sinister, and venomous," yet the man before him today was merely a silent, detached warrior.

Nearby, Ding Weizeng was growing deeply uneasy. He had dealt with Situ Mo many times, had even fought him, and knew the man well. The eyes that should have been brimming with malice and cunning were utterly changed, replaced by a silent, detached calm that set Ding Weizeng on edge.

He sent a covert transmission: 'Lord Chenghui, I fear this man is plotting something...'

Li Chenghui replied, suspicious, 'You all claim he is treacherous and unpredictable. If he were scheming, why would he act this way and deliberately arouse our suspicion?'

While the two allies grew suspicious, Situ Mo simply rode his golden light, weaving through the wind to meet the rain of lightning. He circulated his power, only for the bronze-green light of the screen in the sky to shine down, locking his two primary artifacts in mid-air, rendering them immobile.

Forced to rely only on hand seals, Situ Mo released bursts of light to counter the thunder. It was a dull, frustrating fight, yet his face remained blank as he silently endured the assault.

Situ Mo had been fighting the Li clan since the era of Li Yuanjiao. He had been at the Foundation Establishment Realm far longer than most; he was an elder of the same generation as Li Xuanxuan. To be suppressed by Li Chenghui—a junior among juniors—using an external artifact should have been a pathetic, shameful humiliation. Yet Situ Mo merely watched in silence.

When Situ Mo set out today, he had received three flying letters, all dispatched from the Great Void. Two ordered him to kill Li Chenghui. The third ordered him to kill Ding Weizeng, specifically to force Li Zhouwei to show himself.

Accompanying the letters were two items: a gray rope etched with patterns of mountains, edged in gold, and surrounded by a faint white halo; and a purple talisman that shimmered like rippling violet water, radiating an unfathomable power. It was ice-cold to the touch, a chill that pierced straight to his soul.

He could not decipher the purple talisman, but the gray rope... Situ Mo knew the gray rope all too well. He had read of it countless times. It was the prized treasure of his clan’s own Daoist Master, Situ Huo. A Purple Mansion-grade Spirit Artifact: The Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope!

His clan’s Daoist Master, Situ Huo, was exiled overseas, his status—living or dead—unknown. Rumors claimed his Dharma Body had been severely wounded—some said by the elements, others by an enemy—and that he had lost an arm, forcing him into hiding, never daring to return. Why would *he* get involved in this mess? What possible reason could he have?

Situ Mo had skirmished with the Li clan for years, always carefully dancing along the edge of the established rules. He recalled the time on Jindou Island, when Li Xuanfeng waited in the waters with his bow drawn, forcing Situ Mo to hide, paralyzed, on the island. In truth, the terror he felt then paled in comparison to this.

Since its third generation, the Golden Tang Gate had seen countless masters die suddenly, commit suicide, or be assassinated by their own kin. Situ Mo was a product of this environment; he himself had killed his own brother to take his position. To have survived in the cracks for this long, his insight was sharp. He understood the current situation perfectly.

'Today, the only person who can kill a direct descendant of the Li clan—and do so *within the rules*—is me.'

The Li clan’s backing was Li Ximing, who was away. The Situ clan clung to existence thanks to Situ Huo, who was also away. At this precise moment, no one was more suitable for this task than Situ Mo.

In terms of motive, his enmity with the Li clan was deep. In terms of status, he too was the descendant of a Purple Mansion cultivator. He was the perfect hot potato—dangerous to touch, difficult to discard. The only difference between him and Li Chenghui was that Situ Huo placed no value on the Golden Tang Gate.

'Once I kill Li Chenghui, who will Li Ximing seek vengeance against? The Golden Tang Gate, a faction with only a few weaklings left, who could simply seal their mountain and play dead? Will he target Changxiao? Or Yehui? Did the powers who sent this artifact and this talisman not consider this?'

'But what about *me*? Did they expect me to calmly return to the Golden Tang Gate and enter seclusion for my next breakthrough? Impossible!'

The gold-armored man stood coldly, seemingly suppressed and unable to break free, but internally he was frozen, as if clutching a bone-chilling dagger, utterly paralyzed by indecision.

Yes, the Golden Tang Gate possessed a Purple Mansion-grade formation, but what good was it? The formation core was sealed by a higher power, rendered inert. It wasn't just the Golden Feather Sect that held a jade key to the array; the Azure Pond Sect and the Yue Cultivating Sect had keys as well. That grand formation offered Situ Mo no protection at all.

The moment he used this Purple Mansion Spirit Artifact to kill Li Chenghui, a Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect would likely arrive. They would kill him to appease the Li clan, and secondly, they would seize the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope for themselves. They wouldn't show an ounce of mercy.

'But if I *don't* kill him...' he thought, 'I will have accepted gifts from two Purple Mansion cultivators while defying the orders of three. Who under heaven will grant me refuge then?'

Situ Mo had considered handing the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope over to the Golden Feather Sect, begging to survive in the cracks. But he knew that at this very moment, the entire scene over the Tangdao Mountain Range was falling under the gaze of the Golden Feather Sect. Their utter silence was, itself, an obvious answer.

'Daoist Master Qiushui has been in seclusion for years, leaving Daoist Master Tianhuo to manage the sect... That Daoist Master has already given his tacit approval. Perhaps... perhaps one of those three letters came directly from him!'

No matter how he looked at it, Situ Mo was the Golden Feather Sect’s dog. If the sect hadn't approved this, who would dare make such a move?!

Situ Mo gripped the Spirit Artifact in his sleeve. Time ticked by, second by agonizing second, as if counting down the last moments of his life. The man finally lifted his sleeve and hissed, "Li Chenghui!"

The man opposite him glanced over. Li Chenghui's eyes were sharp and dazzling, like twin points of ink, with arcs of lightning crawling across his robes. Situ Mo stared at him, momentarily lost, grinding his teeth so hard they audibly cracked.

'There is only one path to survival... only one path...'

Li Chenghui watched the man opposite him. Situ Mo’s golden robes whipped in the wind, pulsing with metallic light. The man was clearly over-agitated; his sharp, white teeth were bared, and his body seemed to hunch over as strange, guttural sounds escaped his throat.

'Gold resides in Geng-Xin... Earth forms mountains... that which is baleful shall be bound...'

Li Chenghui sensed the danger and retreated a step. At that exact moment, Situ Mo snapped his head up and let out a guttural roar: "HAA!"

Time seemed to slow. Li Chenghui watched clearly as a gray rope snaked out of Situ Mo's sleeve. It was covered in overlapping mountain patterns, edged in gold, and surrounded by a faint white halo. As it appeared, the light around them instantly dimmed.

*BANG!*

The Chongming Profound Insight Screen high above shuddered as if struck, recoiling with a dull boom. Its suppressing light vanished. Instantly, the massive swarm of golden needles and the school of fish-like daggers were released, screaming through the air as they shot downward.

In the next instant, the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talismans that hovered around Li Chenghui exploded outward, blasted apart and scattering in every direction. The lightning they had generated held back the gray rope for a fraction of a second before being utterly annihilated.

"A Spirit Artifact!"

Li Chenghui's mind screamed the warning, but the rope moved like the wind. It coiled like a clever serpent, instantly leaping onto his long spear.

Although Li Chenghui was one of the Li clan’s top cultivators and his spear was a Foundation Establishment-grade artifact, it was merely standard issue—nothing compared to Li Qinghong’s Duruo Spear. But even if he held the Duruo, it would have made little difference against a true Spirit Artifact.

With a sickening *thud*, the lightning on his spear vanished and all spiritual qi dissipated. The gray rope bound the weapon tightly, then flicked, contemptuously sweeping the spear toward the ground.

But that brief instant was all Li Chenghui needed. He summoned a palm-sized, ornate bronze mirror from his sleeve. Its rim was carved with two rings depicting galloping beasts. It was the Bronze-Winged Brightwhite.

This was the mirror artifact recovered from the Capital immortals Dao. Though ornate, its quality was not high—only slightly better than his spear. It leaped forward and struck the gray rope. A sharp *TANG* rang out as the mirror was sent flying backward, emitting agonizing, cracking sounds.

But the desperate blocks had not been useless. Ding Weizeng, who was close by, was already swinging his staff to intercept. Crucially, Li Chenghui had bought himself just enough time. He opened his mouth and drew a mote of brilliant white light from his internal Thunder Pool.

"Secret Art of the Purple Talisman’s Primal Light!"



# Chapter 770: Ambition and Capacity

A brilliant white point of light flashed, rapidly expanding and transforming. A waterfall of lightning poured down, blocking the gray rope. Only then did the violent crack of thunder sound: "BOOM!".

The Secret Art of the Purple Talisman’s Primal Light was, after all, from the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring lineage. Intense lightning and a violent impact spread out simultaneously. It was far more powerful than his previous artifacts, clearly causing the gray rope to slow significantly, even knocking it backward.

But the thunder-waterfall's dominance didn't last long. The mountain patterns on the gray rope lit up one by one. The center of the lightning burst seemed to spring a leak and instantly deflated. All the purple lightning-plasma was sucked into the gray rope as if by a great whale drinking, vanishing completely in an instant.

'It's a Spirit Artifact of the Earth Virtue or Metal Virtue! Earth smothers rampant thunder, and Metal dissipates residual lightning—it perfectly counters my thunder techniques!'.

Li Chenghui saw it immediately. For years, his lightning, with its tyrannical speed, had been what he used to slay demons and restrain enemies. Now, he was finally the one being suppressed. He spun around, treading on lightning to retreat.

Ding Weizeng had already rushed to support him, striking the gray rope twice with his staff. The rope, however, acted unhurriedly and vanished into the Great Void. Situ Biao and the others pressed forward, intercepting Ding Weizeng. Situ Mo himself, his face cold, rode the wind to chase Li Chenghui.

One golden and one purple streak of escaping light shot toward the sky. Without a thought, Li Chenghui fled east. Above his head, a dark cyan radiance rose as the screen panels unfurled. The brilliance of the "Heavy Abyss Gale" surged out, rushing toward Situ Mo. But Situ Mo's escaping light was generated purely by his own cultivation, not an artifact, making it hard to shoot down. Furthermore, he had long understood the function of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen in the sky. He had already recalled his golden needles and golden saber into his sleeves. Facing the assaulting cyan light, he only paused for a moment.

Fortunately, Li Chenghui's escaping light was a notch faster, keeping him temporarily ahead. The Chongming Profound Insight Screen's light cycled back, but a patch of gold suddenly appeared before him, captured in his vision. It was an enemy technique that had secretly circled around. Li Chenghui gathered lightning in his palms and pushed forward, dispersing the technique.

As he raced onward, riding the thunder, a thought flashed through his mind like lightning: 'Situ Mo has a Spirit Artifact! A Purple Mansion cultivator must be involved!'.

Li Chenghui felt little panic; instead, his heart was heavy with grim realization. 'Who is behind this? Situ Huo? The Golden Feather Sect? The Capital immortals Dao? Changxiao? ...Perhaps it's not just one person, but the collective will of several Purple Mansion cultivators...'.

'This is for our clan's Heir... I'm just a thunder cultivator whose Dao path is already severed. Why would they need such a grand formation to deal with me?'.

'They are trying to force Minghuang to appear! This isn't just about Changxiao. I already knew that among the Purple Mansion cultivators, probably none of them wished to see Minghuang break through to their realm, but I never expected their actions to be this ruthless!'.

Li Chenghui had always been deeply baffled by Changxiao's sudden, lethally offensive move. Now, having reached this point, he finally understood.

'I suspected long ago that Changxiao, having acted against the "Son of Heaven's Mandate" repeatedly, held ill intentions toward Minghuang, but I never thought he would act so decisively and so quickly. It seems I underestimated the malice the other houses hold for my family. Changxiao is simply acting on the collective will! Regardless of whether other cultivators want Minghuang to fall into Changxiao's hands, in the matter of forcing our clan Heir to appear... there are far, far too many aligned interests.'.

'As for what happens after he appears, some will want to capture him, others will want him dead... Changxiao saw this clearly. As long as he forced Li Ximing out to sea and kept him occupied, even if Yehui was unwilling to act, too many other Purple Mansion cultivators would fan the flames. Never mind the Golden Feather Sect or the Crimson Reef—even the Si Clan of the Azure Pond Sect, who supposedly backs the Li family, don't they also harbor thoughts of pushing our family to the brink?! If they want the Li clan to submit fully to the Azure Pond Sect, this is the perfect time!'.

Although Li Chenghui didn't know about the events at Mount Luoxia, he interpreted this persecution as fear of his clan's leader, and the conclusion he reached was no different. He had slowly managed to sort through the complexities.

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Situ Mo, his expression savage, closed his fist on empty air behind him. He caught the gray rope in mid-flight, its bright mountain patterns flashing. His voice boomed like thunder as he roared, "Li Chenghui! Die!".

This shout snapped him back to reality. What was Situ Mo's situation in all this?.

The man, Situ Mo, was clearly recorded in the clan annals as a cunning and venomous individual. His own elder sister had dealt with him and confirmed he was a ruthless tyrant. Such a person, if he were to use a technique or sacrifice an artifact, would naturally do so silently, his expression calm, to prevent his enemy from preparing. Why would he be like this, with a savage expression and a voice like thunder, as if terrified Li Chenghui wouldn't notice him?.

In that instant, clarity dawned on Li Chenghui. He understood. 'Even though he's menacingly trying to kill me, it is only by me continuing to flee, making this commotion bigger and bigger, that I serve his interests! He needs to force Minghuang... he needs chaos! He needs everyone's eyes to fall upon my clan's Heir, satisfying the Purple Mansion cultivators! Only then does *he* have a sliver of a chance to live!'.

At this moment, Li Chenghui was like a black moth caught in a spider's web, beating its wings, struggling to survive. But wasn't the golden-skinned poisonous spider opposite him also trembling, caught in the very same web, just trying to stay alive?.

*BOOM!*

A torrent of purple lightning surged out, blasting backward into a wave of thunder. The golden needles retreated, but from their midst, the venomous snake-like gray rope shot out again.

Although Situ Mo appeared desperate and furious, and his vicious words served as a veiled hint, he understood even more clearly what must be done and what must not. His hands did not relax in the slightest. The Spirit Artifact that suppressed lightning continued to bind him.

Li Chenghui had already seized the opportunity to swallow a medicinal pill. A red glow immediately lit up his body as both his cultivation base and lifespan burned away to fuel his desperate flight eastward.

On the other side of the Funan region was the battle between Li Minggong and the Capital immortals Dao. Although that situation was also grim, it now seemed to be his only chance.

'How ridiculous... The Capital immortals Dao is my family's greatest public enemy since our Purple Mansion breakthrough, while all the other houses are polite and smiling. I never thought... that I would now have to rely on the "goodwill" of the Capital immortals Dao!'.

The world's affairs were truly profound; everything had been reversed overnight. Li Chenghui tore through the air, just beginning to ride the thunder, when he heard a maddened roar from Situ Mo behind him: "Run! Do you think you can escape!?".

This roar, powered by spiritual energy, echoed across the sky and pierced Li Chenghui's ears. The young man's expression faltered for a fraction of a second. Thoughts raced through his mind: *Can I escape?*.

Was merely having Situ Mo chase him enough to force Li Zhouwei to appear? This tiny Funan region was only the size of Moongaze Lake's northern shore—wasn't the distance too short? Thunder was fast; if there was any slip-up, or if the Capital immortals Dao decided to help, wouldn't the opportunity be wasted?.

'It isn't a chase... it's my life... Situ Mo's meaning is probably that he doesn't just have one Spirit Artifact... he has more... If he's pushed too hard, he *will* strike to kill first.'.

As Li Chenghui's thunder dissipated, the gray rope fell, blocking the path ahead. He forced himself to take a step, feeling his entire body grow heavy. He changed direction, heading toward the river. Across the river was Moongaze Lake—the place where Li Zhouwei was in seclusion!.

The moment Li Chenghui turned, Situ Mo knew his opponent understood, at least partially. He was overcome with relief, yet still broke out in a cold sweat. 'Thank goodness the Li family cultivators are smart!'.

He never in his life thought such a sentiment would cross his mind, yet there it was.

'Go south! Force Li Zhouwei out onto the lake! That is the only way we both live! Otherwise, you die... and I will be boiled alive!'.

Situ Mo's face remained savage and agitated, the anxiety in his eyes undiminished. But the hand seal he was forming paused for an instant—he had clearly breathed a sigh of relief. Even the gray rope slowed down. Li Chenghui rode the thunder forward several steps, with Situ Mo using the Spirit Artifact to "forcefully" push him across the river.

*BOOM!*

The wide river had just appeared before them when the Golden Tang Gate Master slowly raised his eyebrows. The gray rope erupted in brilliant light. Runes flowed out from the mountain patterns, coalescing in the air into falling streams of pale golden light, revealing the artifact's profound function.

It wasn't unheard of for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to use a Spirit Artifact to fight an enemy; Ning Heyuan back in the day was one such example, and he held an ancient Spirit Artifact at that. But whether in terms of cultivation, combat skill, or even the compatibility of the artifact with his Dao lineage, Ning Heyuan absolutely could not compare to Situ Mo.

Now, as this profound ability emerged, Li Chenghui clearly felt the space around him grow obscure, as if he were trapped in a mountain ravine. The gray rope continued to expand and spread, casting down pale golden light from the sky, using the Great Void to lock onto him.

Situ Mo was no easy opponent; Li Chenghui had no choice but to move forward. The Golden Tang Gate Master, growing more confident, was already plotting his next move: 'I absolutely cannot be left holding the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope. As soon as we are over the lake, Li Zhouwei cannot sit by and ignore this. Even if he is truly in deep seclusion, Li Xuanxuan will be forced to wake him.'.

'The moment he appears, I will smash the Rope onto Li Zhouwei, hit Li Chenghui with the Purple Mansion talisman, abandon the Spirit Artifact, and flee!'.

Situ Mo was confident that as long as the Rope was not in his hands, ninety percent of the Purple Mansion gazes on him would vanish.

'As long as I don't flee with the Spirit Artifact, and I don't hide in my own sect's formation in the Tangdao Mountains, but instead make a break for the Eastern Sea, I can definitely survive!'.

'Because—I can still be used as bait to lure out Li Ximing!'.

'As long as I am useful, I will live!'.

Situ Mo was truly worthy of the man who had climbed from the son of a concubine to the position of Gate Master. Even in this certain-death scenario, he had managed to find a path to survival.

He wasn't worried about what Li Chenghui might do; he just stared darkly at his back. 'Li Zhouwei has to show himself sooner or later anyway. His appearing doesn't necessarily mean anything fatal will happen to him, but it *will* save your life. No one in this world doesn't cherish their own life, especially when it's not even asking for Li Zhouwei's life in exchange!'.

Situ Mo's eyes remained fixed on Li Chenghui. He clearly had the Spirit Artifact for suppression and the talisman as insurance, and Li Chenghui knew that stopping meant certain death. But Situ Mo's suspicion surged again. 'But the Li family binds its disciples with clan bloodlines and ancient morals. Li Zhouwei is the clan head. How do I know Li Chenghui isn't some stubborn fanatic willing to throw his life away?'.

And so, the next moment, he silently hid a cluster of golden needles in his sleeve and poured his spiritual qi into them. A chilling voice suddenly emerged: "Li Chenghui! If you dare to die, I will turn around and kill Li Minggong!".

Li Chenghui's figure, flashing like lightning over the river, flickered and stopped dead. Situ Mo's cold voice arrived an instant later: "Don't think I won't do it. The Daoist Masters watching will only think I'm being sensible!".

Li Chenghui's eyes widened slightly, his ink-black gaze staring straight at his opponent. He held one hand, fingers pointed like a sword, two inches from his chest. His other hand was extended behind his back, fingers also pointed. Both hands pinched a glittering golden talisman.

The talisman in front of Li Chenghui suddenly flared, releasing a burst of deep cyan light, heavy as bedrock and solemn as an ancestral temple. It was the Rite of the Azure Manifestation Earth Virtue!.

The talisman behind his back, however, lit up with a dense black light, hidden as a forest shadow and eerie as a shaman's temple. This was the 'Concealment' ability of the Ancient Merging Shamanic Talisman Dao! Shamanic Talisman Gold Charms!.

This stack of Shamanic Talisman Gold Charms, brought back from the Great Ning Palace by Li Xuanfeng, was one of the Li family's great treasures. Several of the direct descendants carried them. Li Xijun had once used the 'Transformation' talisman to disguise himself as Guo Hongyao. Now, the two remaining types were finally being put to use.

Once the Azure Manifestation Earth Virtue 'Rite' was activated, it immediately flowed over him like a heavy golden liquid, causing little visible change. But when the Ancient Merging Shamanic Talisman 'Concealment' activated, a black light surged from Li Chenghui's body, causing the gray rope in the sky to freeze.

A Spirit Artifact locking onto a Foundation Establishment cultivator via the Great Void was an inescapable death sentence. But at this moment, Li Chenghui seemed to be hidden from the world, breaking free from that golden lock and soaring away on the thunder. 'Good! It worked!'.

Li Chenghui clearly remembered the talisman's function. When Li Xizhi brought it back, he had explained that 'Concealment' seemed to be a condensed form of the 'Untraceable Presence' Purple Mansion divine ability. Its greater function was escaping Purple Mansion-level scrying and calculations. 'They can't calculate my position anymore!'.

Li Chenghui understood perfectly. The current situation only existed because all the major powers were pushing and nudging each other, fanning the flames. This meant that no single Purple Mansion cultivator would personally use their divine abilities to lock onto Situ Mo or himself!.

'Our clan's Purple Mansion cultivator is out there, watching. No one wants their own Dao lineage to know no peace for the next four hundred years! If they cannot calculate my next move, I have room to act!'.

His figure had only just broken free from the golden lock when Situ Mo reacted in shock. But Situ Mo's eyes had already turned golden. He took a single step, and the cluster of golden needles flew from his sleeve, exploding into countless golden filaments that shot out in all directions like rays of light.

His reaction was astonishingly fast. He had already hidden the artifact in his sleeve, and the very instant Li Chenghui drew the talismans, Situ Mo began activating his own technique. He was so fast they had almost acted in perfect sync.

Li Chenghui's action was unexpected. Any other Foundation Establishment cultivator might have been lost for that crucial instant, creating an opportunity to escape. But the blade the Purple Mansion cultivators had chosen—Situ Mo—had been hammered, forged in fire, and forced to swallow his own hatred. He was too sharp, and too fast.

*TINK!*

The tens of thousands of light filaments released by the golden needles instantly extended for several miles. Far to the east, a faint, crisp sound of impact was heard.

The sound itself didn't travel back, but Situ Mo sensed it through the connection to his artifact. Before his body could even move, his head snapped around. His venomous eyes, completely bloodshot, focused their golden light, stabbing toward Li Chenghui like two arrows loosed from a bow.

A chill ran down Li Chenghui’s spine.

He suddenly recalled his time as a Qi Refining cultivator guarding that small island in the Eastern Sea. The sea was rough then, the setting sun a waxy yellow, and he would read the clan annals. He could recite every passage clearly:

"Later, Geng of the Jin approached the Eastern Sea, but Mo defended the island and would not come out. When Situ Chen arrived, Chen was tricked and killed by him, and thus did not return. When the news reached home, Cheng looked to him and said: When my uncle was still alive, he often worried about this man. He could not be removed, and he once warned me of him with a single sentence, which I have kept in my heart.".

"Liao said: I wish to hear the details.".

"He replied: Observe his ambition and capacity; he will surely become a future disaster!".



# Chapter 771: Unexpected

The brilliance of the Shamanic Talisman Gold Charms flowed over Li Chenghui's body. As thunder rose from his feet and a powerful golden light erupted from behind him, the young man's thoughts were quickly interrupted.

*BOOM!*

Situ Mo, having been tricked and almost losing his target, was no longer just feigning fury; his face was twisted in genuine, dark rage, like a snake handler whose prey had bitten back.

The brilliance of the Golden Tang Gate Master instantly brightened. His diamond-patterned golden robe shimmered with layer upon layer of runes. With a single step, his speed was a world away from before as he reached out to seize his enemy.

A torrent of red and purple light surged over Li Chenghui, with all the purple lightning flowing down to his feet. His expression remained calm, devoid of any fear or panic, like an ice-cold pond. He stepped forward in mid-air, barely managing to evade Situ Mo's grasp by a single, narrow margin.

Situ Mo showed no remorse. As long as Li Chenghui remained within the range of his spiritual sense, there was no way he could escape. His only fear was a repeat of the momentary disappearance from before, which had sent a cold sweat down his spine.

The dark look on his face swiftly vanished, replaced by a cold ruthlessness. A point of golden light rose from the back of his head, transforming into a gourd as white and cold as snow.

'A Dharma Art... or a Dharma Artifact?' Li Chenghui didn't have time to distinguish. A chilling, splendid mist immediately poured from the gourd, descending like a heavenly light that split the clouds and shone directly on him.

Situ Mo's own speed was considerable, and he now closed the distance once more. He joined the tips of his index fingers, murmuring, "Receive the Western orthodox hue, and let the Qi arise…"

With his vast combat experience, Situ Mo didn't waste a moment. While chanting, he also sent his golden needles and golden saber flying. They first sought out the Chongming Profound Insight Screen in the air, and seeing its cyan movement, successfully forced the Dharma Artifact to appear.

Meanwhile, the chilling mist swirled over Li Chenghui. He had already surmised that Situ Mo had held back in their previous encounters, so he prepared his thunder to counter the incoming cold light.

However, a gray-green light rippled over him, and the spell's cold mist cascaded down, as if striking a slippery, round rock. It scattered to either side, and Li Chenghui found he didn't have to act at all.

This was his first time using the talisman, so he was unfamiliar with its effects. The unexpected success was a pleasant surprise, and he quickly raised his thunder. A series of piercing noises rang out in the air.

*CLANG!*

A dark-gold ruyi scepter appeared directly above his head and smashed down. Li Chenghui raised a bolt of lightning to block it, which burst in mid-air into a spray of brilliant white light and glimmering sparks.

Unfortunately, Metal is born from Earth and distinct from it, and it suppresses rampant thunder. The ruyi scepter effortlessly shattered the lightning and struck the gray-green light on his body, which instantly let out a sharp, cracking sound.

"Crack!"

Li Chenghui knew the talisman's protective power had reached its limit. He could only seize the last fading light to take a few more steps, his hand forming a spell seal as he said, "Where Yang culminates…"

Before he could finish the incantation, a cold aura surged from behind him. A torrent of Geng Metal's baleful qi rushed in, slamming into the dark-black light of the Shamanic Talisman. The black light vanished in an instant, like ebbing seawater.

The 'Concealment' ability was shattered and gone!

"Puh."

Li Chenghui spat out a mouthful of blood, which turned into scorching thunder. His cultivation was far inferior to his opponent's, and the number of years he'd spent cultivating couldn't compare. His thunder techniques were also countered, making a battle of Dharma Arts hopeless.

He could only grit his teeth and ride the thunder eastwards. Situ Mo watched him, his eyelids twitching, his expression growing ever more savage.

'He still won't give up!'

The venomous, snake-like gray rope crawled up his sleeve, and Situ Mo simply moved aside, throwing the Spirit Artifact forward.

Li Chenghui's talisman was broken, and the Spirit Artifact vanished back into the Great Void, secretly locking onto him again. A curtain of golden light, patterned with mountains and rivers, descended from the gray rope, sealing off the path to the east.

Situ Mo's heart seethed with hatred. Watching Li Chenghui trapped like a bird in a cage, he felt an unexpected sense of powerlessness. He let out a low sigh and said, "You... you are so foolish! You don't even care about your own life! How many people in your Li clan do you think I can kill?"

Li Chenghui brandished his spear, his gaze fixed on the other man as he stated calmly, "You are welcome to kill me. If killing me doesn't force anyone out, then killing anyone else is useless. Once your usefulness is gone, let's see who protects you then."

Situ Mo felt a mouthful of bitter blood stuck in his chest, unable to be spat out. His heart was hot. The situation was now clear to him: Li Minggong and the others were rushing to aid Li Chenghui. Ding Weizeng, without the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, would soon be defeated. Situ Mo's own family members were also on their way.

Li Chenghui absolutely refused to return to the lake. The only option now was to kill him.

Situ Mo refused to give up hope. "Zhaojing's plan failed. How far can Li Zhouwei hide? What good is it for you to die for nothing?"

Li Chenghui was silent for a moment. He glanced at his opponent, his striking eyes seemingly empty. He then replied, "Kill me if you must. When my clan's forces arrive, they will also kill you."

*BOOM!*

The light curtain of the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope trembled. Someone had arrived nearby. Situ Mo finally gave up. He looked at Li Chenghui one last time and said, "I don't know if I'll survive, but you must die first."

The golden screen in the air descended, and Situ Mo drew his blade. He saw the young man in silver armor and black robes spit out a brilliant, blood-stained point of light. Blood began to seep from the young man's face. Situ Mo's eyes lit up, and he let out a couple of low, laughing sounds from his throat.

He had a deep grudge against the Li clan, and seeing this scene brought him a sense of relief.

Li Chenghui's eyes bulged, and amidst a sky full of lightning, they disintegrated into points of light. His flesh and skin followed, turning into a bloody, crackling torrent of thunder. A suffocating amount of lightning filled the air. Six pieces of the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman coalesced, maniacally draining all the spiritual qi from his body.

Situ Mo retreated without hesitation. He threw the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope, which wrapped around all the lightning and hurtled far into the distance. He clasped the Purple Mansion talisman in his hand and took flight.

*BOOM!*

No matter how powerful this surge of thunder was, it was no match for a Purple Mansion Spirit Artifact, especially one of the Earth and Metal Virtues. It was ultimately contained within a long, muffled rumble. The lightning tried to lash out at Situ Mo, but it was completely trapped, unable to move a single inch.

As the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope's light faded, all the pale golden brilliance returned to the sky. Situ Mo raised his eyebrows, taking in the scene before him.

To the west were his own cultivators from the Golden Tang Gate. Situ Biao and the others stood ready, with one or two bearing minor injuries. It seemed they had dealt with Ding Weizeng.

On the other side was a woman in a red skirt, holding a six-sided lantern. Red and white flames flickered, and her brilliant eyes were filled with tears. Behind her were the rest of the Li clan members.

Should he continue to fight?

Situ Mo's mind was made up in an instant.

'The Li family has a talisman that can evade Purple Mansion-level scrying. It's not difficult for Li Zhouwei to escape the notice of Purple Mansion cultivators. If it were me, I would have fled in secret, too. Li Chenghui was right—killing them is useless now!'

Situ Mo immediately stepped back. As Situ Biao came to meet him, the Gate Master took the purple talisman from his sleeve and pressed it into the old man's hand.

*BOOM!*

The thunder in the sky suddenly flared. Even after being heavily suppressed by the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope, Li Chenghui's final, desperate act still made the heavens turn white. Everyone had to close their eyes and retreat from the blinding light.

This was precisely why Situ Mo had thrown the Spirit Artifact. He used the opportunity to catch the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope as it returned from the Great Void. From within it, he retrieved a black brocade bag, then placed the Spirit Artifact back into Situ Biao's hand. He transmitted a cold message to him: "Kill them all! I'm going to the lake to find Li Zhouwei!"

*BOOM.*

The thunder subsided, and Situ Mo's figure had already vanished as a pale golden streak of light.

Situ Biao could only activate the Spirit Artifact where he stood. A flurry of Dharma Arts passed through the thunder and headed towards him. With flames interlaced with golden water chains, the old man clutched the Purple Mansion talisman, a sense of unease rising within him.

'Why would he give this to me…?'

But he had no time to think. Li Minggong, seeing Li Chenghui's death, nearly vomited blood. Her face wet with tears, her fury was palpable. The old man could only hold up the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope.

However, he had not received the Gate Master's full inheritance. While he knew a few of the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope's wonders, he was clueless as to its true secrets. He could only release waves of yellow light to defend against the incoming Dharma Arts.

…

Situ Mo sped south for a while. Once he was out of sight, and the broad river flowed beneath his feet, he immediately changed direction and headed east towards the Eastern Sea.

This was the most promising path to survival he could think of in that instant.

He left the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope and the Purple Mansion talisman with Situ Biao, so he wouldn't be seen as coveting another's Purple Mansion artifacts. With the Rope and the talisman as a trump card, Situ Biao could continue to fulfill the Purple Mansion's orders, draw their attention, and even manage to kill one or two of the Li clan members, making his sacrifice all the more meaningful.

As for Situ Mo himself, he had deliberately taken Li Chenghui's storage bag to give Li Ximing a way to find him, so he could become a "fish hook" for the Purple Mansion cultivators. This way, even if one of them wanted to kill him, others would be unwilling to see him die.

As for "going to the lake to find Li Zhouwei," that was just a pretense to convince Situ Biao to stay behind and die for him.

'It's a pity about that Chongming Profound Insight Screen; it was a magnificent treasure. Since Li Minggong was there, I had no way to take it. If she had been able to tie me down, the outcome would have been uncertain…'

Having abandoned even the Spirit Artifact, he certainly wouldn't be greedy for the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. He rode the wind, terrified and on thin ice, his mind racing.

The sky before him slowly grew dark. Situ Mo's heart was aching with anxiety, and his hands and feet were ice-cold. The river below reflected the setting sun. He scanned the scene from south to north, as if expecting a Purple Mansion cultivator to leap out at any moment and crush him to pieces with a single palm strike.

After flying for a while, the land to the south grew desolate, turning into a vast wilderness. There was no one around, not even a passing cultivator. The river was as calm as a mirror, with no sign of a single aquatic demon.

Situ Mo's heart, to his own surprise, began to calm. A cold sweat broke out on his back, and the Golden Tang Gate Master's mind grew clearer than ever.

'I succeeded… Amidst this chaos, the Purple Mansion cultivators' positions will only become more and more fixed. They have colluded to harm Li Zhouwei, and with every passing hour, their thoughts will shift in silence toward wanting to kill Li Zhouwei, and even Li Ximing!'

'After all... even if no one else knows, it's better for those I've harmed to die sooner rather than later!'

His thoughts became more focused, buried deep within his mind. Situ Mo knew he was on the right path to survival. Li Chenghui's face, stained with blood and filled with determination, flashed in his mind for a moment, then quickly disappeared.

He continued to fly out of the wilderness, sometimes in the sky, sometimes diving deep into the river, changing his path constantly. The black storage bag of Li Chenghui was clutched in his hand like a life-saving talisman, and he never opened it.

At this point, his spiritual qi was running low. The long chase with the Spirit Artifact had left him mentally and spiritually exhausted. The tension he'd held all day finally began to ease.

*Splash!*

He burst from beneath the river's surface, sending water flying in all directions. The water fell back, and the surface of the river became a mirror once more. The world was now at its darkest point, and the surroundings were incredibly black, save for the faint sound of wind rustling through the trees.

The last of the river water dripped from him, and Situ Mo lowered his eyes, his gaze falling upon the river's surface.

Reflected in the water was a man in golden-white armor. A black robe was draped over his shoulders, billowing in the night wind. A brilliant light of Bright Yang heavenly light streamed down from his armor, rippling across the surface of the water.

His black hair was loose. Two black-flame arms grew from his back, each holding a black halberd pointed towards the river on either side. A white-veined profound armor plate extended slightly on his left hand, and his fingers were joined, pinching a shimmering golden talisman that was slowly transforming into a black light in the wind.

'Concealment.'

The young man's other hand held a long halberd outstretched. A dazzling heavenly light surged from the center of the Grand Ascension Halberd, and the sharp, long blade rapidly grew larger before his eyes. Situ Mo vaguely saw a point of light rise from the center of the other man's brow, and then, a boundless white light engulfed his vision.

*CLANG!*

The Grand Ascension Halberd struck his Dharma Robe like a streak of light, and the Golden Tang Gate's top-tier Dharma Robe groaned under the unbearable pressure. Situ Mo felt as if his internal organs were on fire.

*BOOM!*

Then, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light smashed into his face like a sharp sword. An explosive boom mixed with the sounds of shattering reverberated through the night sky.

A mouthful of fire shot from Situ Mo's mouth and scorched his lungs, making his entire body convulse. He wasn't surprised by the man's power since he'd left seclusion. All he felt was a chilling horror.

'How is this possible?! How is he here at this time?!'

'This is a vast river! How could he have blocked my path?'

It all happened too suddenly. Situ Mo had never imagined a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion cultivator would appear right in front of him. And all the things he had relied on for his arrogance at the lake—the Purple Mansion talisman and the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope—he had thrown away in Funan!

What was more, the person who had appeared was a Purple Mansion Seed like Li Zhouwei!

His golden robe could no longer bear the strain. It dimmed in mid-air. The bright light shone through, and two arms made of black flames shot out from either side. Situ Mo's golden talismanic light shield had no time to fully form. It was seized by the arms, which were imbued with an anti-Dharma power, and it corroded away, unable to close.

*Thump!*

One of the arms suddenly locked around his throat. Situ Mo felt the world spin. The stars and moon blurred before his eyes. He had been lifted into the air and was now staring into a pair of golden pupils.

A pair of golden eyes, full of hate, as if blood were about to drip from them.



# Chapter 772: The Sword

The flames boiled, flowing down the heavenly light. The hand on his neck tightened. Situ Mo still couldn’t understand.

*Why?*

How could Li Zhouwei have found him on this vast, flowing river? Situ Mo's initial shock quickly gave way to a cold understanding. Li Zhouwei must have been guided by a Purple Mansion cultivator. But why would Li Zhouwei reveal himself? Wouldn't it be better to flee straight to the Eastern Sea?

The Purple Mansion masters might not be able to track Li Zhouwei, but could they not track *him*? Situ Mo had been released by them, yes, but how could their profound abilities not include a few watching eyes? No matter how fast Li Zhouwei fled, he could never outrun a Purple Mansion cultivator.

'Why did he have to eliminate me, the knife?'

'Unless... the Purple Mansion cultivator guiding Li Zhouwei *wanted* him to eliminate me... But their eyes are definitely on me. Even if he uses that talisman again... can he really escape?'

But he had no time to speak. Bright Yang and heavenly light erupted from his face. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light from Li Zhouwei's brow exploded Situ Mo's entire head into a mist of bone and gore. Scalding blood vaporized instantly into golden baleful qi.

The Golden Tang Gate Master, who had fought the Li family for four generations, finally melted away in the scorching Bright Yang light. All that remained were two storage bags and a dim, diamond-patterned golden robe hanging from the Grand Ascension Halberd, its empty sleeves flapping in the wind.

*Clatter.*

Brilliant golden needles fell from the sky, scattering onto the river's surface. This precious set of Foundation Establishment Dharma Artifacts was drawn up by the heavenly light and floated back into the air. Li Zhouwei withdrew his halberd, his body turning into a streak of light.

*BOOM!*

As Situ Mo perished, the sky rapidly brightened. The woods around Lake Xian stirred, every leaf rustling as it drooped. The calm water rippled violently. A massive surge of golden baleful qi struck the lake, pulling at the celestial phenomena above, scattering the clouds and mist. A deep autumn chill spread, and the night passed in an instant, revealing the dawn.

Situ Mo had been a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator who practiced a secret art and had his sights set on the Purple Mansion Realm. His sudden death meant his essence and life force were largely preserved, creating a swift and violent phenomenon.

The golden baleful qi touched the heavens before descending, making contact with Lake Xian's surface and bed. Gold is the child of Earth. The scene instantly became a hundred times more brilliant. The lake's surface shifted between azure, blue, and red as the earth-veins vibrated, clearly nurturing a new mineral vein below.

Li Zhouwei did not suppress the death phenomenon. The changing sky and trembling earth instantly drew countless gazes. Instead of fleeing to the Eastern Sea, he flared his Dharma light and appeared against the brightening sky by the riverbank. Placing two fingers before his chest, he surged his spiritual qi.

*BOOM!*

The river gurgled past as the sky grew brighter with the morning glow. A Radiant Pass materialized from thin air. Piles of white bricks stacked high, its corner towers rising, golden and resplendent. It tore through the void with tremendous momentum, illuminating the surroundings from within the clouds.

Powered by Li Zhouwei's full strength, the Radiant Pass shone over Lake Xian, visible from far and wide, attracting observers. Li Zhouwei stood beneath it, clad in platinum armor, holding his halberd.

The view here was open—the former shore of the Profound Peak Gate's territory. As he simply stood there, gazes from the Great Void locked onto him one by one. Streaks of light even whistled in from over the river, stopping cautiously over the lake nearby.

Li Zhouwei remained motionless. His platinum armor gleamed under the radiant light. He planted his halberd on the ground, raised his head to the sky, and his voice boomed like thunder:

"Li Zhouwei of the Moongaze Li Clan is here! If you intend to kill me to prevent future trouble, then make your move!"

The sound rolled across the lake. After a moment of brief silence, no one answered.

Li Zhouwei's grip on the Grand Ascension Halberd tightened, his knuckles whitening. With a *clang*, he set the halberd upright in the air beside him and actually sat cross-legged beneath the Radiant Pass, taking a jade box from his back.

The box was as bright green as jadeite, with clean, elegant lines. The lid slid open smoothly, revealing a cyan blade.

The sword was four feet five inches long, its body a blend of cyan and white. The edge was pure white and magnificent, its light shimmering like water. Two ancient characters were engraved on the center of the blade:

**Qingchi**

Amidst the chilling gleam, the sword seemed to pulse faintly. The hilt was wrapped in simple black cloth, meticulously trimmed by the original owner, with rounded edges. Where the tassel hung, two more words faintly appeared:

**Annihilation**

This was Seven-Foot Azure Nether Bronze, a Metal of the Supreme Yin and Lesser Yin. After years of care, its cyan-white hue had only deepened. Even under the brilliant radiant light, the sword’s own gleam shot toward the sky.

Li Zhouwei simply placed the jade box on his knees and waited.

Points of bright escaping light quickly appeared over the river, drawing closer. After two breaths, six cultivators in gray-white robes arrived, nearing the lake's surface.

Their robes were gray and white with golden trim—the attire of Changxiao Gate. The leader was handsome and tall, his eyebrows slanted up to his temples, carrying the air of a true immortal adept. He was clearly a high disciple of an immortal gate, but his expression was complicated.

Seeing the young man sitting unmoving beneath the Radiant Pass, the man flicked his sleeve. He did not attack immediately, but turned his head and asked, "Where is the Daoist Master? This man fled to Lake Xian, making us wait at Moongaze for nothing. Now that we are here, why is the Daoist Master not present?"

A cultivator beside him bowed. "Martial Uncle Yunan, Zhaojing is outside. The Purple Mansion cultivators within the sea have no reason to privately harm a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Daoist Master Chengyan should be supporting us from the Great Void."

Yunan Zi was usually stationed overseas and had a fiery temper, but he understood the affairs within the sea. Hearing this, his anger flared. "Baibin Zi, you are too soft! What is there to fear? This is a Purple Mansion Seed! I hear he has destiny on his side and is far more terrifying than Zhaojing. Isn't it more dangerous to let him escape? If the Daoist Master just killed him with one palm, the Moongaze Li Clan is still on the lake, a weakness we can still hold. If Zhaojing dares to harm one of our disciples, we can just grab a Li clan direct descendant and kill them. What can he do?"

Baibin Zi whispered, "Martial Uncle, you are used to killing overseas, but it is different here. The Li Clan has ties to several Purple Mansion families and is an immortal clan itself, with several in-laws among them. Even a Daoist Master can not kill and fears such retribution. Brazenly harming a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion line is not something the various houses will tolerate."

"Cowardice only leaves behind future disaster! ...All those ambushes on the lake... we let him escape. The Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope isn't here, and now we're short one Situ Mo!"

Baibin Zi could only try to placate him. "Martial Uncle, do not be angry. Fortunately, several Daoist Masters kept an eye on Situ Mo. Daoist Master Chengyan, following the Grand Daoist Master's orders, had us stand guard at the lake while he personally tailed Situ Mo. Now, we have caught our fish."

"What's more, Daoist Master Chengyan said... Li Zhouwei is too dangerous, and the other sects only want to fan the flames. If things go wrong, he will personally act. Even risking retaliation, he will capture Li Zhouwei. We are just trying the low-cost method first."

"Situ Mo wasn't bait for *him*! Without Situ Mo, do you know how many things can no longer be done?!" Yunan Zi retorted angrily as the group came to a halt over the lake.

Yunan Zi squinted, looking at the Radiant Pass in the clouds. Its aura was shocking, and he finally grew serious. He stared intently at the young man, shook his sleeves, and said, "Bring your swords. We can capture him just the same!"

The others immediately moved closer. Just as Yunan Zi moved his fingers to form an incantation, the young man abruptly raised his head. A pair of golden pupils stabbed toward him. Yunan Zi froze, his anger turning into a chilling palpitation.

'No wonder the Grand Daoist Master wants him captured...'

Yet, facing six sudden opponents, Li Zhouwei didn't say another word, nor did he form any seals for a Dharma Art. The first thing the young man did was tie the cyan-white treasured sword to a prominent place on his armor.

The group, feeling profoundly slighted, glanced at each other. Baibin Zi had already taken a glowing ring from his sleeve. It was only the size of his palm and as thick as a finger. He pinched the ring and looked at the man below, a silent doubt in his mind.

'Strange…'

There was no time to think. Every extra hour brought another variable. The cultivator showed no mercy, immediately bringing out a Spirit Artifact. He raised the glowing ring and chanted, "Dispel the light and scatter the sharpness, let the sun dim and stars fall. Do not let bright fire be born, do not nourish its qi..."

As he spoke, Yunan Zi led the charge. The Daoist held a thin technique sword, which pulsed with rings of golden light. He acted decisively, striking first.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him and drew his halberd. With a surge of strength, the weapon lunged like a flood dragon emerging from the water, thick with black flames. Yunan Zi, relying on his extra years of cultivation and his experience overseas, did not flinch, meeting the halberd's light head-on.

*CLANG!*

With a metallic shockwave, Yunan Zi's longsword was uncontrollably forced upward. The Geng Metal light on the blade was corroded by the black flames and vanished completely. Li Zhouwei was unforgiving. Pinning the blade, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light erupted from his brow and shot forward.

The golden Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light suddenly expanded. This Dharma Art, enhanced by Concealed Plunder Gold, pierced the distance. It wasn't aimed at Yunan Zi, but shot instantly toward Baibin Zi, who was casting his spell further away.

The attack was too fast. Baibin Zi never expected Li Zhouwei to ignore the other five and attack him from afar. Caught off guard, a halo of light appeared around Baibin Zi, barely blocking the blast. It burned fiercely, sizzling and crackling.

Baibin Zi's chant faltered, causing the light in his hand to flicker. The others, feeling slighted, brandished their own Dharma Artifacts. Li Zhouwei pulled his halberd back, sweeping it horizontally to scatter the attacks from two opponents as his two black-flame halberds shot out to intercept the enemy artifacts.

One remaining Li Fire Dharma Art was fast and fierce, shaped like a sparrow. It had a strange brownish-yellow hue, clearly empowered by a spirit flame and not just a simple technique. Its power was immense. Before it even reached his back, flames erupted all around.

A small banner immediately appeared behind Li Zhouwei. Five-colored Li Fire swept out and collided with the attack, blocking it. But the enemy Li Fire suddenly changed color, and a sword shot out from within it. The sword blazed with fire, its light flashing—it was a sword-control technique.

"Excellent technique, Junior Brother Zhuang!"

The Li Fire user was clearly powerful. Yunan Zi knew his strength and had specifically chosen him for this. Now, Yunan Zi also drew his sword, unleashing his own long-brewing Dharma Art. He released a wind of Radiant Essence, pressing toward Li Zhouwei.

But Li Zhouwei was unhurried. The Radiant Pass behind him flared brightly. Heavenly light descended, gently suppressing the flying fire-sword. He feinted with his halberd, then stabbed back toward another person nearby.

He held off all five Changxiao cultivators by himself, showing no sign of strain. Facing Yunan Zi's wind of Radiant Essence, he was fearless. He swept his halberd, turned his head, and shot the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light from his brow at the sword of the cultivator named Zhuang.

A short distance away, although Baibin Zi had been interrupted, his cultivation was profound. Within a few breaths, he finished the spell. He gently tossed the light ring, which expanded rapidly in the air until it was the size of a courtyard and as thick as a tree trunk. Waves of spiritual light pulsed from it, enveloping everything.

In an instant, the color of the Radiant Pass behind Li Zhouwei dimmed. The flames on the Li Fire banner flickered, and even the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light on his brow shrank.

Only the black flames on his halberd raged on, undiminished, even forcing the spiritual light from the sky back by a fraction.

"A Spirit Artifact," Li Zhouwei stated, bracing his halberd. Yunan Zi's wind of Radiant Essence was still swirling around the weapon, dispelling the Bright Yang spiritual qi. Attacks assailed him from both sides, forcing him to take a step back.

Yunan Zi and the man named Zhuang were both direct descendants. The other three were slightly weaker, but two were still late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. With Baibin Zi controlling a Spirit Artifact from above, the contingent Changxiao Gate had sent was clearly intended to overwhelm him.

He stood firm as the Changxiao cultivators slowly spread out to surround him. Baibin Zi, operating the Spirit Artifact in the sky, watched him carefully, the shadow of doubt in his mind refusing to disperse.

"Still no orders from the Daoist Master... How strange. Whether it's to kill or capture... there should be an order!"

A cold wind whistled through the upper sky. Baibin Zi was almost distracted. He looked up. Higher in the sky, a faint wisp of cyan was drifting northwest.

Baibin Zi was a high-level cultivator from Changxiao Gate. He certainly knew what that cyan wisp was. It was the "Treasured Tassel Spring Breeze" from the Sword Gate. It flew from the top of the Sword Peak, traveled all the way to Lake Xian to merge with the daytime sea breeze, and nourished the lands of Jiangnan. It was a precious commodity, but no one dared collect it within the Sword Gate's territory.

'Before merging with the sea breeze, the Treasured Tassel Spring Breeze travels through Sword Gate territory... Is this its path? ...Why is it blowing over the Profound Peak Gate?'

His expression froze. A white light flashed from his hand, and he snatched a rogue cultivator from the air nearby. The man had been enjoying the show and was caught completely off guard, nearly spitting up blood in terror.

Baibin Zi grabbed his throat and hissed, "Whose territory is this?! Wasn't Profound Peak eaten by... the Capital immortals Dao?"

The man was a local rogue cultivator. He stammered in fear, "Daoist, sir... Profound Peak hasn't had any territory by the lake for a long time! I heard that the entire area around Lake Xian was secretly returned to the Sword Gate. It's been Sword Gate territory for ages! The Xuanmiao Temple also hurried to hand over their land. From here all the way north, including more than half of Lake Xian's surface... it's all Sword Gate land!"

"Sir, they say that if a sword cultivator looks up from here, they can even see the glow of the Sword Peak!"

Baibin Zi and the others had been in seclusion for years. The moment they came out, they were pulled into this ambush on the lake, all within a day or two. They only knew the Capital immortals Dao had annexed Profound Peak; they had no idea about any of this. His heart pounded.

"So that's it! No wonder... He unexpectedly walked right into the 'trap'... No wonder!"



# Chapter 773: The White Crane Falls

'That cyan-white sword at his waist must be the legendary Qingchi.'

Baibin Zi watched the man fighting within the spiritual light of the Yongjing Profound Ring, and a deep sigh escaped him.

Li Chejing had not been a member of the Sword Gate, nor had he reached the Purple Mansion Realm. After a hundred years, the Sword Immortal's connection to them had faded. For all these years, there had been no news of interaction between the Sword Gate and the Li family. The Sword Gate's feelings for that short-lived Sword Immortal were likely more regret than any deep bond.

But Baibin Zi remembered, back when he was only an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator assigned to guard the Changxiao Gate's assets in the Chengshui Mausoleum Market, he had heard of another man: that Sword Immortal's elder brother, Li Tongya.

And that man, Li Tongya of the Celestial Moon Sword, had personally slain a Maha, causing a sensation. He had been recorded in the Sword Gate's Chenghua Hall as an exemplar for all Sword Gate disciples, praised and remembered by all.

Baibin Zi understood perfectly. The man before him, Li Zhouwei, was not just the Li Clan Head and a descendant of a Sword Immortal; he was the direct, orthodox blood descendant of Li Tongya!

'A figure like this, wearing the Qingchi sword—a blade that belonged to a past Sword Immortal and a great virtuous cultivator—if he is killed by a Purple Mansion cultivator on Sword Gate territory... Myriad Radiance will surely erupt in shame and humiliation! The Sword Gate can forget about its moral high ground and its reputation as sword cultivators ever again!'

Even now, Baibin Zi had not received a single word from Daoist Master Chengyan. He didn't need to think hard to know why. The Daoist Master must be in some kind of trouble in the Great Void... At any rate, he was their Daoist Master, so Baibin Zi could only frame it charitably in his mind: he was in a "standoff" with the master of the Sword Gate.

'We can't count on the Daoist Master...'

Baibin Zi was lost in thought mid-air. Below, within the spiritual light, the black flames raged. Li Zhouwei had retracted most of his Dharma Arts, his halberd thrusting and stabbing, shadows blurring. He used the black flames' anti-Dharma properties to resist the spiritual light, and had already found his footing against the five-man encirclement.

'What is Baibin Zi spacing out for up there?!'

Yunan Zi was fighting with suffocating frustration, his heart burning. This young man had almost no weaknesses. Not only were his Dharma Arts powerful, but his halberd possessed an anti-Dharma power that shattered flames and magical light with every sweep and thrust. Yunan Zi could only use his own sword to run interference.

Daoist Zhuang at his side excelled in Dharma Arts. Back in the Eastern Sea, his torrential Li Fire had always overwhelmed his enemies. Who knew he would run into a Bright Yang cultivator who didn't fear fire, and who also had anti-Dharma flames that corroded his techniques? He couldn't even use fifty percent of his true strength.

This enraged Yunan Zi. He leveled his sword, pressed two fingers against the blade, and began chanting. Talismans shook loose from his sleeve. Daoist Zhuang, having worked with him for years, reacted instantly, crushing a green gourd and shouting, "Trap him first!"

The two cultivators on the flanks exchanged a look and each pulled a chain of purple, water-patterned links from their sleeves, gripping the Dharma Artifacts as they chanted.

Li Zhouwei seized the opportunity to pull his halberd free from the swamp of Dharma Arts. The flames of the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts flared, finally calming the five or six gales of Radiant Essence that had been swirling around him.

In the span of a single move, Li Zhouwei suddenly raised his halberd, the light between his brows surging. Four of his opponents scattered, but the last remaining Changxiao cultivator was out of luck. The old man, standing on the wind holding a brown-lacquered peach-wood staff, had no choice but to grit his teeth and block.

Having gained a moment's breath, Li Zhouwei's assault became ferocious. Before the halberd even arrived, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light struck first. The old man raised his tortoise-shell-like defensive artifact. With a tremendous *BOOM*, white light and flames exploded against the shell, sending it flying backward.

Only then did the halberd arrive, trailing raging black flames and a turbulent wave of spiritual qi.

With the swarm of Dharma Arts no longer tying him down, Li Zhouwei attacked with his full strength, golden flames practically leaping from his pupils. The old man was scared witless. He raised his peach-wood staff high, his Immortal Foundation spinning as a wave of brownish-yellow power surged forth.

*BOOM!*

The old man was no expert in artifact combat. The few techniques he specialized in had already been broken, and now he was suddenly taking such a ferocious hit. Fortunately, the peach-wood staff had some life-saving properties. The Dharma Artifact let out a low, mournful cry.

*CRACK!*

The halberd suddenly swept sideways. Its bright, crescent-shaped blade flashed. The old man felt an overwhelming, uncontrollable force transmit from his hands. The peach-wood staff was instantly ripped from his grasp, hooked by the halberd, and sent flying high into the air.

"Not good!"

The staff struggled wildly in the air. The old man was, after all, a direct descendant of Changxiao. He immediately formed a seal, and the staff turned into a brown speck of light, trying to pierce the void and return to his hand.

*BOOM!*

But the pristine white Radiant Pass appeared, smashing down on the speck of light. The technique was instantly shattered by the suppressive force, revealing the artifact's true form, firmly pinning it below.

'There's a reason the Wei and Li families often use halberds... Combined with this Immortal Foundation, it truly is the Dao of Suppression...'

The old man, having lost his artifact, was humiliated. But thankfully, Daoist Zhuang's green gourd was already active, pouring forth a torrent of white water that descended with overwhelming spiritual qi.

Li Zhouwei immediately felt the wind of heavenly light gathering at his feet weaken. He knew at once:

"A Water Mansion Dharma Artifact!"

The raging Water Mansion washed over his feet. Before the water even touched him, the spiritual wind supporting him had completely dissipated, leaving only a fading spark of heavenly light beneath him as he hovered in the air.

He stomped thin air, and a jade mountain appeared beneath his feet. The mountain expanded rapidly, revealing vivid clouds, immortal cranes, and ancient pines. In less than two breaths, it had firmly planted itself in the water.

Li Zhouwei stood atop the Jade-Mist Mountain. The Jade True Dharma Artifact flared with light, forcing the surrounding Water Mansion to part. But two purple, patterned chains were already flying toward him, seeking to bind him. Li Zhouwei had always despised these binding-type artifacts. He had no choice but to raise his halberd and parry them.

"Hah!"

A sharp shout echoed from above. Yunan Zi had drawn his sword. He took a mouthful of clear water and spat it onto the blade, unleashing a wave of azure-green, gloomy light.

*Shoo…*

The profound light shot from the sword, seeming to take the weapon's own spirituality with it. The Geng Metal radiance that had covered the blade vanished completely, leaving only a hollow, dim sword body.

Yunan Zi cultivated True Qi and had practiced Dharma Arts for many years. His casting speed was extreme. He left the sword hanging in the air and pulled a jade talisman from his waist, clutching it as he immediately began preparing his next technique.

Li Zhouwei, however, grew serious. The Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner unfurled violently, blasting five-colored Li Fire to temporarily hold back the two purple chains. He thrust his halberd upward. *Clang!* He struck the azure-green light from the air.

The profound light flickered and disappeared.

Li Zhouwei swept his halberd back, blasting apart the techniques on either side and stirring up a wave of spiritual qi. But his golden eyes were still searching the air.

He knew from that first clash that this thing was unusual. It seemed to be some kind of Dharma Art condensed with metal essence, difficult to disperse. To make matters worse, the spiritual light from the ring above was constantly falling, suppressing his own techniques.

He silently swallowed a pill. His two black-flame arms swept their halberds into the Li Fire to fend off the two purple chains. He glanced at Yunan Zi hiding in the back and stepped forward into the void, his Jade-Mist Mountain suddenly rising.

*CLANG!*

The azure-green light was getting faster, dodging his halberd several times. Only thanks to the suppressive influence of the Jade-Mist Mountain was he able to knock it from the air.

This great mountain of the Jade True Dao Lineage had appeared at the perfect time. It radiated beams of white light, coordinating with the suppressive power of his Bright Yang. When Daoist Zhuang saw him searching the air and realizing he was using the Dao of Suppression, he knew Li Zhouwei wanted to pin his martial uncle's azure-green light. Zhuang hurried forward, stirring up his Li Fire.

Li Zhouwei controlled his artifact, which suddenly flew out of the Water Mansion. It shone brightly, but instead of attacking the nearest target, it pressed down on Daoist Zhuang.

By ignoring the others like this, the azure-green light was able to escape. It found an opening and slammed into his back. The scales of his Yuan'E Soft Armor instantly stood on end. The light around Li Zhouwei dimmed, and the technique shot away again.

But the mountain pressing down on him sent Daoist Zhuang's soul fleeing. His techniques were strong, and in an instant, he turned into a streak of fire and scattered, gritting his teeth. "If Martial Brother Yufu hadn't fallen overseas, how could this beast be so arrogant!"

But the jade mountain did not chase him. Instead, it *boomed* as it smashed down onto the green gourd.

'The most critical piece here is Daoist Zhuang's Water Mansion artifact. I'm already suppressed by the spiritual light from the sky, and this artifact scattered my movement technique. I was trapped on the Jade-Mist Mountain, waiting to be besieged!'

The gourd was not a defensive artifact. Pinned by both an Immortal Foundation and a Dharma Artifact, it instantly began to wail, faring even worse than the wooden staff. In a moment, it was seized by the Radiant Pass above.

As Li Zhouwei broke free, three Dharma Arts exploded against him. His armor brightened rapidly, every scale humming.

The next instant, he transformed into a brilliant streak of heavenly light, as fast as a fish darting through water, and vanished within the golden mist.

The light-shifting ability of the Yuan'E Soft Armor!

A sense of crisis erupted in Yunan Zi's heart. The jade talisman in his hand was only half-lit when a blinding heavenly light shone in his eyes, so bright it seemed to scorch his face. He was forced to abandon his technique, sweeping his sleeve to release a black halo.

*CRACK!*

The halberd stabbed the halo. His hastily deployed defense was useless; it shattered into motes of light. The halberd's light flew in, and the Radiant Pass from behind Li Zhouwei shot forward as well.

Yunan Zi's technique was rushed. He was still reeling, his feathered robes ringing as sparks flew. He couldn't just wait to die. Using the moment his opponent's technique faltered, his figure vanished and reappeared several dozen feet away.

But the halberd pursued him relentlessly. It made a small turn, the crescent blade stabbing at him again. This time, Yunan Zi had a moment to breathe and was much calmer. He flicked a jade bead from his sleeve to block it.

Who knew the halberd would just hook and slap the bead aside? Li Zhouwei completely ignored the sword and techniques chasing him from behind. His two extra arms didn't even turn to defend, but instead brought their own halberds stabbing forward.

"How dare this demonic disciple be so savage!"

Yunan Zi's mouth was full of shock and anger, but his legs were already moving. Most of his Immortal Foundation's wonders were related to Dharma Arts. Changxiao Gate was a great Dao lineage of techniques; almost none of them practiced artifact combat. Their swords were only for casting. How could he possibly fight this man up close? He turned and fled.

As he dashed away, the sound of flames and water exploded behind him. Spiritual light shot everywhere as Li Zhouwei blocked the surrounding attacks. With another loud shockwave, Li Zhouwei burst out of the flames and shot directly toward him!

The golden-eyed man was now covered in fire. The scales of his Yuan'E Soft Armor were baked red, glowing faintly under the extreme strain. Li Zhouwei used the armor to shift through light and close the distance, the mantra in his mouth having hummed for some time. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light between his brows was condensed to its absolute limit:

'Shine upon the Eight Desolations, let all bow to me... Ten thousand spirits look up, the Shangyao is the Celestial God!'

After three consecutive pursuits, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light finally erupted into a brilliant white column of light as thick as a water bucket. Yunan Zi's pupils were instantly enveloped by the boundless, brilliant light.

He finally understood why his opponent had chased him three times without giving him a single moment to react.

'We're outside the range of the Yongjing Profound Ring!'

*BOOM!*

A gray light shield suddenly erupted from Yunan Zi's body. The searing Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light spread over the entire shield like molten baleful earth. He felt his entire body burning and yelled through clenched teeth, "Baibin Zi!"

His voice was immediately drowned in the light, which was now mixed with black flames that slammed against the shield, hissing and sizzling.

Yunan Zi was confident in the strength of his talisman and wasn't afraid. In fact, he was enraged that such a precious talisman had to be used, and a venomous sneer crossed his face.

But as he looked up, he vaguely saw a glint of gold within the flashing light.

'What is that…'

In an instant, his vision cleared. He saw a small, palm-sized vial engraved with crimson-gold Li Fire patterns. It was tilting.

From the mouth of the vial, a single drop of liquid slowly trickled out. It was extremely viscous, and the liquid itself was covered in patterns of a terrifying apricot-yellow.

Fear, belatedly, seized Yunan Zi. He wanted to move, but realized that all the brilliant light surrounding him was only there to trap him.

*Drip.*

Li Zhouwei snapped his halberd back. The halberd swept out a crescent of wind, carrying dense black flames that blasted the pursuing Li Fire and Water Mansion into a shower of light. As the halberd returned, the five cultivators chasing him all retreated a step.

*BOOM!*

A dazzling, apricot-yellow light shot into the sky. The others couldn't help but squint. Lake Xian, already colorful, was now reflected as a pure golden lake. A massive torrent of Li Fire instantly filled the sky, so powerful that even the glowing ring above dimmed slightly.

Daoist Zhuang looked stunned. He was swept by the intense Li Fire, and his robes began to burn with apricot flames. But as a Li Fire cultivator himself, he was already in the best shape of the group. He batted at the flames on his robes while looking up.

The apricot light dimmed slightly, finally revealing the scene.

A violent storm of Li Fire was rising from behind the golden-eyed man. As the apricot flames rolled over him from behind, Li Zhouwei raised one hand, the edge of his Grand Ascension Halberd pointed flatly at the five men. The circular core of the halberd pulsed with rings of light.

That little speck of azure-green light had lost its spirituality. It drifted sluggishly within the halberd's core, its once-sharp form having been baked into an oval shape, struggling feebly.

Li Zhouwei stood there, armored and holding his halberd. Behind him was the light of True Qi, suppressed by the Li Fire. The falling phenomenon of the cultivator's death was transforming into gentle, ethereal immortal cranes. They had only just managed to flap gracefully in the air three or four times before they were swiftly consumed by the fire and fell from the sky.

'Yunan Zi is dead! The esteemed direct descendant of a Purple Mansion, Yunan Zi, just died like that!'

The lake was golden. The dawn was brilliant. Li Fire ascended, and white cranes fell. Amidst the bright apricot glow, Li Zhouwei's halberd seemed to gather all the golden light in the world, dazzling the eyes of the remaining cultivators.

And his cold voice echoed across the lake:

"A direct descendant of Changxiao, is this all you are."



# Chapter 774: The Flames Die

As the shout fell, the apricot-yellow light was still spreading, and fear had already taken root in the others. Daoist Zhuang held his Li Fire aloft. Seeing Li Zhouwei stand motionless with his halberd, he realized the man was recovering his breath. His heart seized, and he yelled:

"Act now! That Dharma Artifact he just used was no simple thing! He must be weak right now!"

His shout instantly steadied their resolve. The few of them exchanged a glance, urged their Dharma Artifacts forward, and instead of retreating, charged at the man before them.

Daoist Zhuang, meanwhile, formed a hand seal and cast a spell, standing still. With two fingers clasped, he moved his fire into his dantian, his heart filled with both fear and greed. In truth, Daoist Zhuang was not one of the original direct disciples of Changxiao Gate, but a late addition who didn't even have a Daoist name. He had no loyalty to Chengyan in the Great Void to speak of. But his eyes were sharp. In the raging Li Fire just now, he was the only one who saw that the opponent had used a Dharma Artifact.

'Such a powerful Li Fire artifact... it must be extraordinary... if I could get my hands on it...'

At that moment, Daoist Zhuang's killing intent was the strongest. Righteously, he had stabilized the morale of the group, while Li Zhouwei, for the first time, revealed a smile. He pushed his halberd sideways, bracing it with a clang against the Dharma Artifacts of two of them. Behind him, the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner rose once more.

The few cultivators engaged in combat again. As expected, after the intense battle, Li Zhouwei seemed to be running low on spiritual qi. The spiritual light from the sky descended once more, surprisingly pinning down the savage man again.

The battle below was fierce. In the sky, Baibin Zi had tears in his eyes and gritted his teeth. Area-of-effect Dharma Artifacts like the Yongjing Profound Ring were inherently taxing on the mind, and it was even more difficult for him to control the Dharma Artifact with his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, making it hard for him to free his hands. But with his heart filled with grief and indignation, he no longer cared about whether a Daoist Master should intervene. His eyes bulging with fury, he poured all of his spiritual qi—even his essence—into the Dharma Artifact.

With this influx of spiritual qi, the Yongjing Profound Ring finally revealed its true might. The suppressive spiritual light grew thicker and thicker, gradually even pushing back the black flames on Li Zhouwei's halberd. He was increasingly put on the defensive, sustaining several injuries in a row.

Baibin Zi watched with elation, pouring even more spiritual qi into it. Who knew that a small gray brocade pouch at his waist would suddenly leap, and a talisman inside would activate with a pop, bursting into flames. Suddenly, a brilliant azure light shone forth, and a golden beam escaped from the top of Baibin Zi's head. He abruptly regained his clarity. His mind was blank for a moment, and his confusion quickly receded.

'Not good!'

Seeing the agitated state of the others below, he felt a chill crawl up his spine. Taking advantage of the talisman's effect before it faded, he struck the Yongjing Profound Ring with a palm. The spiritual light in the sky instantly shifted, and the Dharma Artifact reverted to its original form, falling into his hand. Baibin Zi's face was grim. He felt his entire body go soft and quickly formed a hand seal, descending.

When Li Zhouwei saw the spiritual light from the sky cease to fall, he understood that the other party had not fallen for it. A sense of pity arose in his heart. The halberd in his hand, however, suddenly changed. The raging black flames increased in power several times over, and the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light between his brows erupted again. Just as the old man was about to retreat, the Sun's Resonant Parting Art suddenly burst forth, transforming into several white beams that dragged him to a halt. In just that single moment's delay, the halberd descended with intense wind pressure.

*BOOM!*

The old man's hands were instantly shattered. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light flew over and punched a fist-sized hole in his head, flashing with flames. He was surely cooked inside.

'What a pity...'

The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was launched too hastily this time, its power far less than before. As the remaining few quickly retreated, Li Zhouwei did not give chase. Instead, he retracted his weapons and stood still in the air.

Baibin Zi descended on the wind. Daoist Zhuang, who was extremely displeased with Baibin Zi's sudden retraction of his Dharma Artifact, was about to lash out, when he saw Baibin Zi's cold expression and heard him say:

"The talisman from the Daoist Master worked! We were either deceived by fate just now, or deluded by a Divine Ability or Dharma Artifact. Retreat, now!"

When he said that, Daoist Zhuang felt a wave of cold rush to his head. He was horrified, thinking to himself:

'Why would I have craved his things!'

Baibin Zi took a few steps back, his heart ultimately filled with unwillingness. The original plan was not as simple as just the Yongjing Profound Ring. The Yongjing Profound Ring was a Dharma Artifact designed to destroy techniques and overturn profound formations. It was originally meant to deal with the vast number of cultivators and a dozen or so Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Li family, to break their formation at a critical moment and prevent Li Zhouwei's escape.

The real tool prepared for Li Zhouwei was the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope! That spiritual rope was for entangling and binding, restraining artifact combat. Coupled with the Yongjing Profound Ring, it would have left Li Zhouwei with no way to escape.

'Who knew... it would come to this!'

Gazing at Li Zhouwei, who stood steadfastly with his halberd, Baibin Zi's eyes slowly fell. His heart was bitter:

'This matter today... it's not just my Changxiao Gate, is it? More than one or two people want to harm Li Zhouwei.'

He could only keep these words in his heart, not daring to speak them aloud. The Yongjing Profound Ring in his hand glowed faintly, and his mouth trembled. In the end, he said nothing at all, and flew away on the wind.

The immortal cranes in the sky still wailed and circled within the raging Li Fire. Li Zhouwei propped up his halberd and slowly closed his eyes. The golden-eyed man wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth, and stepped, one foot at a time, from the air to the ground. A glint of moisture appeared at the corner of his eye, only to instantly evaporate and vanish on the scorching red Yuan'E Soft Armor.

***

The Great Void was a pitch-black expanse, undulating without cease. Yet, in one spot, a faint light shone, revealing a low table in the darkness. A middle-aged man in a Daoist robe sat cross-legged beside it. His hair and beard were half-white, and he appeared amiable. On his back, he carried a treasured sword with a Geng Metal scabbard, which emitted a brilliant light.

Across from this sword cultivator sat a man in brown clothes. He seemed somewhat simple and honest, waiting respectfully by his side, head bowed and silent, as if awaiting instructions.

"Senior Li... what do you think..."

Although the brown-robed man was respectful, his expression was troubled. He hesitated before speaking, and the sword cultivator across from him finally raised his brows, glanced at him, and replied:

"What is there to see?"

The brown-robed man immediately fell silent, sitting there feeling somewhat stifled. The sword cultivator lowered his brows and observed the Great Void for a moment. Only when the surrounding Purple Mansion cultivators had dispersed did he speak:

"Fellow Daoist Chengyan, I don't care how you throw your weight around on your own territory, but for you to run all the way to my Sword Gate's domain to act so brazenly, and to try and kill a descendant of one of our Sword Immortals, that's against the rules."

'Was that just me...?'

Chengyan's heart was bitter, but he replied aloud:

"This matter was my oversight. I originally wanted to invite this young friend to my Changxiao Gate for a visit, and to ask him for news of our Great Daoist Master. I didn't expect such a great conflict to erupt. It makes my sect look bad."

"It's true that this junior was imprudent. I apologize to you, Senior... please do not hold it against me."

Daoist Master Lingmei raised his brows, and the upward slant of his eyebrows immediately revealed their sharpness. The sword cultivator replied:

"Bullshit."



# Chapter 775: Sorting the Aftermath

This reprimand from Daoist Master Lingmei was blunt, almost an open scolding, yet Chengyan did not dare show the slightest hint of dissatisfaction, standing with his head bowed obediently.

Lingmei sat upright with his sword on his back, admonishing him as if he were a junior:

"Changxiao is a treacherous one. I saw long ago that he was vicious and his schemes poisonous. And now he’s taught you to be just the same, utterly lacking in composure!"

Chengyan could only nod in agreement. Lingmei continued, his face cold:

"It’s useless talking to you. You lot from overseas are all unscrupulous, stirring up such a commotion. You bring out one Dharma Artifact after another. That Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope belongs to Situ Huo. How did it end up in your hands?"

Hearing this, Chengyan shook his head and replied, "Senior, that Dharma Artifact was either given by Situ Huo, or the Situ family found it somewhere. It truly has nothing to do with my sect. How could it be a Dharma Artifact supplied by Changxiao…"

"Who knows," Lingmei sneered.

"The Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope isn't a signature Changxiao artifact like the Yongjing Profound Ring. If you really did provide it, who would ever know? What's the plan for it now?"

Chengyan raised his eyes, slightly embarrassed, and said in a low voice, "Daoist Master Tianhuo... should be on his way to retrieve it. After all, it was meant to be given to them."

The Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope had fallen into the hands of the Golden Feather Sect the moment it appeared. If it was something Changxiao Gate had acquired, this would look like a massive loss. But Lingmei remembered clearly, and said:

"Changxiao really does make good bargains. Situ Huo pledged the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope to the Golden Feather Sect back then. Later, he was driven out, missed the rendezvous, and remained in hiding to nurse his injuries, so the Dharma Artifact stayed with him..."

"I'm afraid Changxiao was entrusted by him, took some benefit, and was supposed to return this item. But it’s a hot potato; you couldn't even use it once without being linked to Situ Huo, inviting a whole crowd for interrogation. So you conveniently threw it into Situ Mo's hands, letting him use it once while also wiping your own hands clean..."

Although Daoist Master Lingmei was a conservative and stubborn member of the Sword Gate, he himself was not bound by convention. His mind was flexible. While this was his speculation, it was very likely the truth. He dared to say it, but Chengyan did not dare to confirm it, only replying:

"Senior jests. This matter is so complicated, and our sect's Daoist Master has not returned from the Eastern Sea. His whereabouts are still unknown. How could we possibly arrange so many things…"

Seeing him continue to play dumb, Lingmei scoffed and replied, "I won't waste any more words on you. I fear if you stay longer, you'll run out and get killed by Hengli, and the blame will land on my Sword Gate. This matter ends here. Do not stir up any more trouble near my Sword Gate's territory!"

As if granted amnesty, Chengyan immediately took his leave. Lingmei remained seated in the Great Void, feeling rather relaxed.

'Li Zhouwei gave me a good excuse. I didn't get dragged into it, and now he owes me a favor. Just showing up to intimidate Chengyan was enough to stop others from fanning the flames. Li Ximing gave me enough face, so with this, both human sentiment and face are fully satisfied!'

He stood up cheerfully, took the treasured sword from his back, and held it in his arms, laughing inwardly:

'Now let's see if those old fogeys in the sect can still lecture me about morality and orthodoxy... claiming I'm a heretic who has strayed from the Sword Heart... If I had hidden away adhering to the Immortal Abode's rules, how could I have saved Li Zhouwei? When rules and morality conflict, I'd like to see what you have to say now!'

***

Moongaze Lake.

The sky was gloomy, laced with crackling thunder. A continuous, dreary rain drifted through the air, scattering across the vast expanse.

The faint golden radiance of the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope hung frozen in the sky, the ferocious Li Fire suppressed beneath it. A golden stream of light rose up as a white-haired old man in a Golden Tang Daoist robe formed hand seals to cast a technique.

"Situ Biao!"

The red-skirted woman and the others were trapped by the Dharma Artifact, unable to advance or retreat. The Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope was an item of both Earth Virtue and Metal Virtue, making it difficult to effectively counter. It scattered chaotic, pale-golden light, pushing them back time and again.

The Golden Tang Gate had the upper hand, but Situ Biao's expression was as ugly as if he’d seen a ghost. It was laced with despair.

Situ Biao was one of the few remaining elders. His bloodline wasn't particularly close to the main branch, but his cultivation was high, which was the only reason he had survived round after round of purges. He wasn't stupid. Having reached this point, even if he couldn't see the full network of plots behind the scenes, he had sensed enough.

He could accept Situ Mo using him as cannon fodder. Situ Biao didn't have much lifespan left anyway, and he reckoned trading his worthless old life for Situ Mo's escape wasn't a loss. Besides, with a Dharma Artifact in hand, he could at least deceive himself. But who knew that right in the heat of battle, a vast and familiar surge of Golden Baleful Qi would suddenly erupt in the east, soaring to the heavens.

*Crack...*

The jade talisman in his sleeve shattered. The talisman the old man held tightly in his hand even loosened its grip. He hesitated, but ultimately, he did not throw it. Instead, he put it back safely in his storage pouch.

Situ Mo was dead. There was no need for him to hold out here.

"Pfft."

Not far away, Li Minggong spat out a mouthful of blood. She too looked up at the pillar of Golden Baleful Qi rising in the distance. Tears welled in her eyes again, but through the blur, she saw that the wretched light of the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope had frozen solid.

Everyone's techniques solidified in mid-air. Even the roiling Li Fire stopped, as if it were a sculpture. The mountain and river patterns on the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope abruptly dimmed. A hand and half a sleeve reached out of the empty air.

The sleeve was embroidered with golden flame patterns, its cuff adorned with golden stone and wind-blown sand. The hand itself was fair and delicate, with long fingers.

This hand lightly pinched the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope. The gray rope, so imperious just a moment ago, twitched in his grasp like a dead snake and, under the petrified gaze of the crowd, vanished.

A full breath passed before the flowing mountain patterns in the sky belatedly faded. The space beside Situ Biao was suddenly empty. The old man trembled in the air like a plucked chicken.

"Clang!"

Tears streaming, Li Minggong held her lamp in one hand and activated the Capital immortals Dao Bell. With the other hand, she drew the sword from her waist and shouted:

"Your Golden Tang Gate's actions... even a Daoist Master couldn't bear to watch!"

Situ Biao's scalp went numb. An ill wind was already rising beneath his feet. He hurriedly took the talisman out again, concealing it in his hand as he yelled into the oncoming wave of Li Fire:

"Retreat!"

The Chongming Profound Insight Screen was still in the sky. Without the support of the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope, the Golden Tang Gate's techniques were almost half-useless. There was no point in fighting. The old man just held the talisman high and shouted:

"Li Minggong! Don't force my hand!"

Li Minggong tearfully called for her people to halt, allowing Situ Biao to retreat several miles. She rode her True Fire, glaring after them with hatred, but then she paused, stunned.

She wasn't the only one. Elder White Ape, Li Wen, and the others all froze in mid-air. Far in the distance, Situ Biao was once again frozen, unable to move, the light around his body ceasing to pulse.

The same hand with the golden stone and flame sleeve emerged from the Great Void again. It stretched out five fingers and, with a *whoosh*, plucked the talisman right out of Situ Biao's hand.

'This...'

Despair washed over the faces of the Golden Tang Gate cultivators, one after another. But the frozen state did not break. The Daoist Master stepped fully out of the Great Void. He wore robes of golden stone, wind-blown sand, and flowing flames. He was seven chi tall, with elegant brows, handsome eyes, and his hair bound up.

This Daoist Master flipped the talisman over in his hand and asked:

"Any more?"

Situ Biao trembled in terror, shaking his head frantically. The Daoist Master said, "Oh," turned, and stepped back into the Great Void.

Only then did Situ Biao and his men, drenched in sweat, flee on the wind. The Li clan cultivators didn't dare approach the Daoist Master, so they had no choice but to let them escape.

Once Situ Biao's group was gone, Li Minggong finally crumpled, her vision going dark as she nearly fainted. Li Chenghuai quickly stepped forward to support her.

She had rushed to provide aid, then fought a desperate battle against Situ Biao, who wielded a Dharma Artifact. Her heart had been frantic, and she had lost her composure, fighting the hardest of anyone. Her spiritual qi was long since exhausted; she had only been forcing herself to stand straight.

"Elder Sister..."

Li Chenghuai supported Li Minggong and looked around. Everyone was wounded.

Elder White Ape had reverted to his original form to resist the Situ family and had his heart and lungs pierced by a golden hook. His body was covered in gouges where his flesh had been ripped away. Now, back in the form of a white-haired, robust man, many wounds were deep enough to see bone.

Li Wen's strength wasn't enough to fight alone, so he had assisted Elder White Ape and was not badly injured. Miaoshui, who had only recently recovered, had been wounded again—her collarbone was pierced, and half her neck had been carved off. Though she had patched it with Converging Water, it still looked hideous.

The old man Qu Bushi had little combat ability to begin with, so fighting desperately hadn't helped much. He just had a few broken bones. The old man simply stared at the devastated Funan territory below him, his heart aching.

As Li Chenghuai was taking stock, Li Minggong recovered her breath and stood straight in the fire. "Where is Ding Weizeng!" she asked in a low voice.

Before they arrived, Ding Weizeng had held off the entire Golden Tang contingent by himself. His injuries could only be severe. Now that he was nowhere to be seen, he was likely in terrible trouble.

"No phenomenon has appeared. He should be fine," Li Chenghuai comforted her.

They descended together into the main hall. Li Minggong wiped away her tears and asked, "How is the Clan Head's life jade... That golden baleful qi in the east, was that Situ Mo's death?"

"I'll go ask right now."

Li Chenghuai replied and quickly left the hall. Li Minggong looked at the gazes of the surrounding cultivators, gritted her teeth, and said, "Where is Sun Bai? Bring him here, quickly."

Miaoshui said in a low voice from the side, "During the fight with the Capital immortals Dao, when we retreated, Guest Elder Sun Bai... lacks combat ability. He couldn't get away and seemed to be forced into a formation somewhere in the mountains to hide."

Miaoshui was being polite. The Capital immortals Dao had intentionally let them go. Sun Bai could have left with them. But caught between a wolf in front and a tiger behind, the man's nerve had broken. He had feigned defeat to flee and hide.

Li Minggong had already stopped her tears. Sun Bai's actions were understandable, and it wasn't as if they relied on him heavily. To put it nicely, it was more useful for him to preserve his life. She only said, "This is precisely when we need him. Hurry and bring him."

They looked at each other. Li Wen clearly wanted to guard Li Minggong and didn't move an inch. Qu Bushi, being relatively lightly injured, flew up and out of the hall, heading east.

Only then did Li Minggong sit in the master's seat, feeling the world spin. She wielded the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier and the Capital immortals Dao Bell, and had also been controlling the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. She had been the main force resisting the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope and had suffered many internal injuries. Though she looked fine on the surface, her insides were a wreck.

They waited a while. Sun Bai had not arrived, but a streak of white light first flew across the sky, dancing elegantly as if stepping on stairs in the air, landing outside the hall.

The white light resolved into a figure in a pale white Daoist robe, looking refined and scholarly, his face etched with worry. It should have been a very civilized attire, but it was singed in several places by Merging Fire, making him look rather battered.

It was Cui Jueyin who had arrived first.

"Lord Cui!"

Li Wen immediately went forward. Compared to the other outsiders, he seemed to trust Cui Jueyin, whom Li Ximing had brought back, far more, pulling him over.

Cui Jueyin saw that more than half of Li Wen's jade armor was shattered and his aura was weak. He felt a trace of unease. Seeing the sorrow on everyone's faces, his suspicions were finally confirmed. His heart dropped. "When I saw the thunder shake, I knew something was wrong... Damn it..."

Hearing this, Li Minggong coughed, hiding the blood she brought up in her palm. She took out a pill and swallowed it. "Many thanks for holding off Guo Hongjian in the wilderness. If not for you, the wilderness would have been in peril."

Cui Jueyin cupped his hands. "It was not my achievement alone. Profound Peak Gate has one Fu Yuezi. That man's strength is outstanding. His artifact skills and Daoist cultivation are extraordinary; he must be the foremost expert of Profound Peak."

Just as he finished speaking, Qu Bushi hurried in with Sun Bai. The old man Sun Bai looked wretched and somewhat ashamed. He bowed. "My strength was insufficient. Please punish me, milady."

Li Minggong had no patience for pleasantries and immediately told him to come and check her pulse. Only then did Sun Bai lift his robes, step forward, and conjure a green light with his Immortal Foundation's wondrous ability. As he placed it on her fair wrist, his expression changed to one of utter shock, and he quickly closed his eyes to circulate his spiritual qi.

Li Minggong's complexion improved slightly. She swallowed a mouthful of blood, and her speech became smoother. "Quick," she said urgently, "go find Ding Weizeng... Send everyone out. We must find him first. Nothing can happen to him."

As she spoke, she pulled her hand back and motioned for Sun Bai to check Miaoshui's and Elder White Ape's injuries first. She coughed twice and asked, "That Daoist Master from before. Do any of you recognize him?"

Miaoshui had been listening from the side. Just as Sun Bai was about to check her injuries, she pushed him toward the old ape and spoke up. "I cultivated in this area in my early years and had an... entanglement with a Golden Feather disciple. Because of family matters, it never came to fruition. From the description I heard, this should be the youngest of the Golden Feather Sect's Tian generation, Daoist Master Tianhuo..."

Li Minggong committed the name to memory. After Sun Bai had checked everyone and analyzed their injuries, she sent them away to heal, then turned to Cui Jueyin. "I'll have to trouble you to lead the search."

Cui Jueyin nodded, left, and departed as a streak of light. The entire hall fell silent, leaving only Li Wen sitting cross-legged outside the hall, silently guarding her.

Only then did Li Minggong let the tears fall, coughing softly. Her heart ached as she thought:

'Now... in the entire clan, it's just me and Chenghuai. Chenghuai was brought out later by Uncle Jun and lacks the same connection and prestige... He can't step up... I cannot enter seclusion. I have to handle my younger brother's funeral rites first.'

'Brother... back then... at the little courtyard on Mount Qingdu... all the brothers and sisters sitting together, we couldn't even fit at three big tables. When Uncle Xijun came with the Clan Head, I never even thought I could reach Foundation Establishment.'

'I thought back then that my role, Li Minggong, was to be an advisor... Now... I'm the only one left to face this.'



### Chapter 776: Thunderstorm

After resting for some time to meticulously tend to her wounds, Li Minggong felt as though a great deal of time had passed before Li Chenghuai finally entered the hall. His expression was heavy, a complex mask of relief and worry.

“Elder Sister,” he began in a low voice, “Situ Mo has fallen. Word is the Family Head took action above Lake Xian. He first killed Situ Mo, claiming vengeance. Then, while facing six cultivators from Changxiao, he also slew Yunan Zi, forcing the Changxiao contingent to withdraw.”

Li Minggong immediately looked up, her expression flashing with vindicated hatred, only for it to be replaced by anxiety. “What happened next?”

“It is said he was received by members of the Cheng family,” Li Chenghuai replied, “and has retreated to Myriad Radiance.”

Li Minggong let out a visible sigh of relief, the weight in her heart lifting considerably. “As long as he escaped, that’s what matters. Both fronts are secure now. Just remind him, while he is out there... his priority is to preserve his life.”

Li Chenghuai nodded. Li Minggong coughed, then continued, “I cannot hold on much longer; I must enter seclusion soon. First, organize your brother's funeral rites. Don't let the elders bear too much of that burden. Afterward, I need you to watch over the family. Help them make the decisions. What... what are your intentions?”

Li Chenghuai immediately hesitated. “I wish to share the clan’s burdens,” he said. “But my father is the Master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, and my mother is an immortal scion of the Azure Pond Sect. If I were to take charge, I fear it would not look proper... Our branch has always cultivated at Azure Pond. My appointment to Mount Qingdu was already an exception; there is no precedent for someone like me overseeing the prefecture's affairs or acting as the clan head.”

Li Xizhi was the Pavilion Master and highly regarded by the Si family; he was unequivocally an Azure Pond cultivator. The Yang family were also an imperial clan affiliated with Azure Pond. Li Chenghuai’s status was indeed sensitive. But Li Minggong had no one else to turn to.

She could only sigh. “Just manage things quietly. You don't need to be the public face. Now that things have settled, the other families won't move rashly. My only fear is that someone might use your status to drag Third Uncle into this, giving the Azure Pond Sect an excuse to interfere. With the clan’s Purple Mansion cultivators absent, we would be powerless to resist and would surely fall into a disastrous, muddled outcome.”

Li Chenghuai said softly, “Father was involved too deeply in the destruction of the Chi family. The True Monarch has not returned, and Chi Buzi is still out there, his fate unknown. This is precisely why Father and the Daoist Master decided against returning to the family... We must remain cautious.”

Li Minggong finally nodded. “This matter isn't insurmountable. After all, we still have Cui Jueyin. His cultivation is profound, his Dao attainment is deep, and his character and ability are both of the highest caliber. With him watching over the clan, nothing truly disastrous should happen.”

Just as they concluded their discussion, Qu Bushi appeared at the hall's entrance seeking an audience. Li Minggong quickly asked, “Have you found Ding Weizeng?”

Qu Bushi wore a strange expression and shook his head repeatedly. “Guan Lingdie of the Capital immortals Dao is here to see you.”

Li Minggong froze, hesitating for a moment before replying, “Then… let her come up.”

Li Chenghuai frowned, taking a step forward to stand beside his elder sister. Li Wen also hurried back, and the two flanked the injured woman protectively just as the lady in the colorful dress entered the hall.

Guan Lingdie had not come alone. The guest elders escorting her remained outside the hall; only Gongsun Bofan, still wearing his straw cloak, followed at her side. For once, the woman showed some propriety, stopping at a distance. Looking rather awkward, she offered a greeting that was half-soft, half-rigid:

“Greetings, Daoist Friend Li.”

“Daoist Friend...?” Li Minggong suppressed the exhaustion in her features, replying with her usual courteous tone. “What is this about?”

Guan Lingdie stated her purpose directly: “My sect has a Capital immortals Dao Bell currently in your esteemed clan’s possession. I am here today to exchange for it.”

Given how fickle and erratic the Capital immortals Dao had proven to be, Li Minggong had absolutely no intention of offending them now; reconciliation was the priority. She only said gently, “Daoist Friend, please speak your terms.”

The moment she said this, Guan Lingdie, who retained the temperament of a little girl, immediately dropped her defensive posture. Her tense body relaxed. “Years ago, during a sparring exchange, Situ Mo delivered one of your clan's guest elders to us. The Capital immortals Dao has provided him with good food and drink ever since. Now, we thought to return him, as a token of gratitude for the return of the Capital immortals Dao Bell.”

‘An Siwei...’

Relief flooded Li Minggong’s heart. She raised her eyebrows in hope. “Is this true?”

Guan Lingdie paused, then recited fluidly, “Many past frictions and misunderstandings were mostly instigated by the Profound Peak Gate or forced upon us by Changxiao. They were unavoidable circumstances...”

She continued speaking for some time. Li Minggong, noticing how smoothly the words flowed and realizing Guan Lingdie didn't seem like the sort of person who could formulate such a speech, surmised she had likely memorized it from Guan Gongxiao. She waited patiently until the woman finished, then retrieved the dark, lacquered bell from her sleeve.

“The Dharma Artifact is here,” Li Minggong said softly. “Please proceed.”

Guan Lingdie was overjoyed and quickly gave Gongsun Bofan instructions. He departed, and not long after, Qu Bushi returned. The old man warily circled Guan Lingdie before approaching Li Minggong and whispering:

“The Capital immortals Dao people below have released Guest Elder An. His aura is stable, and he appears unharmed. His previous wounds have all been healed.”

Li Minggong handed the artifact over. Guan Lingdie inspected it, sighed in relief, and without another word, departed on the wind.

A few breaths later, An Siwei finally entered the hall.

His aura was stable and his clothes were clean. The long spear was strapped to his back, looking identical to how he was when he left, save for one detail: his eyes were rimmed with red. In the span of merely a year or two, his face had aged significantly. Though he had no white hair, his entire bearing had decayed, worn down by an invisible weight.

The truth was, the Capital immortals Dao cared little for An Siwei. In Guan Gongxiao’s eyes, he was just trash who had relied on spiritual atmosphere and the Jade True lineage to luckily reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. They had nearly forgotten him in the dungeon. Yet for An Siwei, the internal struggle and anxiety had intensified daily, tormenting him relentlessly.

To now be exchanged for a peak-grade Dharma Artifact by the Li family was utterly sudden. Abruptly released, An Siwei still felt a deep unease. He bowed deeply. “Many thanks, my lady.”

As such an old veteran, An Siwei was treated more like a senior relative. Li Minggong urged him to rise. “Please go and rest. Minggong still has many affairs to handle and cannot keep you. The Old Master has been deeply worried; this counts as good news. Please, let him hear it.”

An Siwei bowed once more and quickly withdrew.

Li Minggong forced herself to stand, stepping down from the main seat. She stared somewhat blankly at the thunder rumbling in the sky above. “Brother Huai, go capture some of that lightning... seal it in a vial. It is time to inter it in the clan tomb.”

Li Chenghuai retrieved a small, dark copper vial from his sleeve. “I already captured some yesterday…”

Li Minggong sighed and followed him out of the hall. A young man was waiting by the main gate—golden-eyed, dark-haired, with a plain face. It was the Second Young Master, Li Jianglong.

Li Jiangqian had already passed down the necessary orders; the arrangements were complete. The group silently flew toward the lake.

They crossed the river. On the north bank, the Fei family had already hung white mourning gauze. Li Chenghui had defended the north bank for years, saving many members of the Fei family from the Floating Cloud Cave. He had spent most of that decade there, and the Fei family knew him well. The sounds of distant weeping carried on the wind.

Beyond the north bank, the entire lake island was draped in white. Despite Li Chenghuai’s request for simplicity, sheets of white fabric were everywhere. The area was shockingly silent, a quiet that held until they reached the main island settlement, where the air erupted with chaotic wailing.

The ceremonial hall was hung with white banners. On either side stood many respected elders, while youths and children knelt below. The spirit-coffin rested in the center, surrounded by low sobbing, awaiting the arrival of the symbolic remains.

Li Minggong, now changed into white mourning robes, stepped into the great hall.

The instant she appeared, the sound of grief detonated. Every last person began to howl. Those who had just been whispering or exchanging glances saw her and immediately began to wail at the top of their lungs, forcing out cries whether they had tears or not. The sheer spectacle of it caused Li Xuanxuan, standing in the center, to finally shed tears.

Before the coffin knelt a youth, crying with particular, agonizing grief. Li Minggong moved silently to the side as the spiritual item representing the bones was presented. Li Xuanxuan began to conduct the rites. The youth cried as if his world had ended, nearly fainting from the exertion.

Li Minggong waited for a long time. All eyes kept glancing toward her, clearly awaiting the announcement of the inheritance. She felt utterly sickened by the scene. She turned and went back outside the hall.

Only when the sun began to set did Li Chenghuai emerge with the Old Master. The three of them finally began their discussion.

Li Minggong still found the reality hard to accept, but the inheritance had to be settled to prevent future trouble. She suppressed her pain and asked quietly, “Younger Brother was unmarried, let alone had children. Treasures like the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman must return to the clan treasury. But his other possessions—spiritual materials, his Foundation Establishment Dharma Artifact, his Qi Refining robes—they must all be passed down according to the laws of succession. They are immensely valuable. Are there candidates?”

Having managed Mount Qingdu, Li Chenghuai answered immediately. “Elder Brother had considered this. Having no son of his own, he thought of adopting the youngest son of one of his clan-brothers. However, the Old Master felt that since he was still young, he might have a natural-born son later, which would create conflict. So, he forbade it.”

No one could have imagined Li Chenghui would fall so soon. Li Xuanxuan, his tears spent, just clutched his sleeves and said nothing.

Li Minggong asked, “Who are the closest relations now?”

“There are three,” Li Chenghuai reported. “The first has the closest blood relationship: the young son of that clan-brother, the one originally intended for adoption. He is thirteen. He never once met Brother. He is the one you saw in the hall, crying himself to death. That clan-brother dragged the child here at dawn and forced him to kneel there, just to claim the position…”

Li Minggong’s brow furrowed in worry. “I thought that might be it... He cries too forcefully. I fear he is skilled at deception, feigning grief for appearances. If we allow such a one to inherit the lineage, I am afraid it will ruin our brother's good name.”

Li Chenghuai continued, “There are two others. The older one is also very close in blood. He is excellent in all respects, but he possesses a hot, straightforward temper. He was kneeling in the hall just now, but he did not cry.”

“The third is younger and more distantly related. But there was a time when he often visited Brother’s residence, and I heard Brother was quite fond of him... However, he is currently stationed at the East Bank defense and has not returned.”

Li Minggong was silent for a moment. “Looking at the scene in the hall, it seems most of this generation care only for their own small families and branches; even more care only for themselves. Very few look toward the clan as a whole. They behave like sect disciples. This sickness isn't unique to our family; the Xiao and Chen clans are the same. It is a common ailment of aristocratic clans.

“It is not technically wrong,” she mused, “but... secure the Dao lineage for these three. We will observe them all carefully in the coming years... only then will we speak of the inheritance.”

She hesitated, just as Li Xuanxuan spoke, his voice hoarse. “Gong’er... bring all three to the main island. Do not let them cultivate other ambitions out there. It will become ugly later.”

Both Li Minggong and Li Chenghuai nodded in agreement.

Just then, a slight commotion rose from below, followed by hurried footsteps in the corridor. A man in red robes arrived late, still pulling on white mourning clothes as he flew. His face was groomed to be rather handsome. The Old Master saw that face, and his heart turned to ice. His lips began to tremble.

Li Chenghuai glanced over. It was, as expected, Li Ximing’s direct grandson, Li Zhouming. He had been conspicuously absent earlier, and both Li Chenghuai and Li Minggong had tacitly avoided mentioning him. Now, the boy had walked directly into the line of fire.

“Bastard!”

Li Xuanxuan was, after all, a veteran of the ninth level of Qi Refining. The old man swept his sleeve, and an invisible force plucked Li Zhouming right out of the air. The young man had been trying to sneak into the crowd, never imagining the three highest authorities of the clan would be waiting at the entrance. He was terrified.

Trembling, he didn’t dare struggle, collapsing to his knees with a heavy thud.

“You... YOU!” Li Xuanxuan was overcome with grief and rage. “Your uncle died serving this clan, and you... the sheer audacity! You dare to arrive late for his funeral rites!”

As the direct grandson of a Purple Mansion cultivator, Li Zhouming was supposed to be a pillar of his generation alongside Li Zhouwei and Li Zhouluo. Instead, he had turned into this useless degenerate, a sight that made the old man’s vision darken.

The youth remained kneeling, the golden longevity lock Li Xuanxuan had gifted him at birth dangling and flashing brightly. His face was a mask of terror. He scrambled forward and grabbed Li Xuanxuan’s leg, wailing, “Old Master, don't be angry... please, don't be angry! Worry for your health!”

He wasn't ugly; in fact, he was rather refined and well-dressed. If he weren't groveling on the ground, he might even possess a certain dignity. But with his grandfather Li Ximing only recently missing, Li Xuanxuan couldn't truly strike him, and only stared with a frigid expression.

Li Minggong had always despised him. She turned her head away, refusing to watch as Li Zhouming pleaded with the old man.

‘Sigh…’

In the end, it was a funeral. Li Xuanxuan gave him a kick. “Get inside!”

Li Chenghuai, ever the diplomat, never commented on such matters and even offered the youth a few quiet words of admonishment.

Li Minggong merely nodded wearily, glancing back into the hall. The moment the three leaders had stepped out, the volume of the crying had instantly diminished, though many were still forcing desperate sobs. The sight filled her with disappointment. She couldn't help but mutter:

“I only fear that the ambition of our six generations... will ultimately be inherited by a pack of...”

“Minggong!”

The old man struck his wooden staff against the stone, cutting her off. Though Li Xuanxuan’s eyes were filled with tears, his voice was powerful and aged. “When a family grows this large... useless descendants are inevitable. They will cry here, and then they will go home... The island's selection process for talent remains clear and fair. Several in the Jiangque generation are quite promising. Do not speak such hopeless words.”

Li Minggong quickly nodded.

Li Chenghuai stood by silently, though he held his own thoughts back, sighing internally. ‘If not for Zhouwei, the Zhou generation would already show signs of exhaustion. And if not for Zhouwei producing good children... how many in the Jiangque generation would truly be presentable? The Old Master always prefers to see the bright side of things…’

The three fell silent. The rain in the sky grew heavier, churning the lake surface.

Suddenly, Li Minggong raised her eyebrows in astonishment, her gaze snapping toward the heavens. Her voice was raw. “Someone is breaking through!”

Li Chenghuai looked up as well, his expression one of immediate delight. He stepped forward, probing the shifting spiritual energy, and met his sister’s eyes.

“The Jing Dragon King!”

“Chen Yang! He has been in seclusion these few years and has finally broken through! It makes sense... he must have borrowed the power of the Inward Heart Surging Profundity.”

The lake surface rippled violently. Li Chenghuai nodded to his sister and soared into the air, vanishing into the storm. As expected, he saw a coiling, gray flood dragon rising above Mount Qingdu. It bared its fangs, its gaze fierce, its whiskers impossibly long.

A young man in black robes rode atop the dragon. He had broad shoulders, long eyebrows, and pupils the color of pale gray ash. His black hair whipped wildly in the downpour. He circled once before landing gracefully in front of Li Chenghuai. He smiled and clasped his fist.

“Greetings, my Lord!”



# Chapter 777: Xia Shouyu

The Sea's Cape.

The sky was a deep azure. A streak of escape-light shot past, drawing a brilliant red arc across the heavens as it sped toward a region where the spiritual qi was thin. After flying for the better part of a day, the light finally descended upon an island, resolving into the figure of a woman.

She wore a wide, brown Daoist robe, over which an ornate Kesi silk cloak had been rather abruptly hung. On her feet were cotton boots dyed an autumn yellow. The ensemble barely looked like a matched set.

She identified her bearings for a moment before flying toward the island's center. As she flew, she observed the masses of savages covering the land and nodded grimly to herself.

‘After I inspect the situation, I can take this group away. They can be brought back to the temple to cultivate the barren mountains. I only need to leave a few thousand behind as breeding stock...’

She flew to the heart of the island and found exactly what she was looking for: a massive, churning, green-water hot spring. The spiritual qi was surprisingly abundant, and she was instantly delighted.

‘After I collect the item, if this spring eye is still functional, I can certainly put it to good use.’

Her expression turned thoughtful. ‘Then again... according to that demonic cultivator, there is a core of flame beneath it. If I move the primary item, this entire spring will probably vanish.’

At this thought, she sneered.

‘That bastard surnamed Feng certainly had a clever plan. How dare he steal *my* Lishu Fire-Averting Cover? Using the Wuting Talisman Brush as collateral is one thing, but the Cover is still *mine*... Where did he possibly think he could run with it?’

With a light toss, the Lishu Fire-Averting Cover bloomed into a protective red halo. She meticulously probed the hot spring, and only after confirming there were no traps did she dive in.

This woman's cultivation was significantly higher, and her speed was nothing the two minor cultivators from before could compare to. She quickly reached the bottom of the spring and followed the earth meridian downward. After a quarter of an hour, she plunged into the heart of the blazing inferno.

Xia Shouyu's Dao attainment was not shallow. Her face lit up with immediate, joyous surprise.

‘There really is fire beneath the grotto-spring water!’

She cupped a handful of the flame, observing it closely, and her surprise grew. ‘This is *artifice fire*... it is not natural. There truly might be the remains of a cultivator down here! To possess such lingering might after death... he must have reached Foundation Establishment at the very least.’

As the woman moved cautiously forward, the pair of eyes watching from within the flames narrowed in hesitation.

‘Why is it only a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator...’

Li Ximing had waited here for another half a month. His luck, it seemed, was outstandingly good; a second person had already arrived. After observing her for only a few moments and hearing her muttering, he immediately grasped the situation.

‘The previous killer who stole the treasure was himself killed. And it seems his killer was the item's original owner, the creditor. He must have exposed his tracks in a market square or some other place. The Eastern Sea is just as chaotic as they say... another life snuffed out.’

Li Ximing quickly dismissed the thought, a bitter taste in his mouth. The Sea's Cape simply couldn't compare to the rich lands of Jiangnan, the center of the world. This godforsaken place was an absolute backwater. After all his efforts at luring someone here, he couldn't even attract the shadow of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

This Xia Shouyu was likely a top figure in this specific territory, a true "local snake" given that she could so easily track down her own Dharma artifact.

‘It makes sense... Anyone capable of reaching Foundation Establishment definitely wouldn't waste their time in this forgotten corner. They would head to the coastal seas, perhaps the Hetian Sea, and pledge allegiance to a major power. Why would they stay here and "eat dirt" in a desolate wasteland with thin spiritual qi?’

Ninth-level Qi Refining would have to do. This cursed place wasn't going to offer anyone better. Li Ximing gritted his teeth and accepted it. As he watched her move step by step through the flames, he found himself facing a dilemma.

‘A minor Qi Refining cultivator from the Eastern Sea... she undoubtedly wants nothing to do with the affairs of the Purple Mansion realm. If I reveal a righteous identity, she will never trust me. It seems I truly must adopt the demonic cultivator persona. If I use threats and promises, she will, paradoxically, feel much safer.’

Li Ximing reflected that if *he* encountered some old ghost trapped in the Eastern Sea claiming to be of the righteous path, demanding he fetch a demon beast for a blood sacrifice in exchange for a heavy reward, he wouldn't believe it for a second. He would run as far and as fast as possible!

Furthermore, judging by her mismatched, cobbled-together attire, even if she was a local tyrant, she couldn't have any significant background. She probably didn't even understand the political stances of the major Purple Mansion powers.

‘Besides, to lure a Foundation Establishment demon beast here, you don't necessarily *need* a Foundation Establishment cultivator to do it. There are countless ways to trick a beast to this location. A Qi Refining cultivator isn't guaranteed to fail. Since she’s at the ninth level, she'll even have an easier time finding one.’

While he plotted, Xia Shouyu was already going mad with joy. If the time and place weren't so inappropriate, she would have started dancing on the spot.

‘The legacy of a Foundation Establishment cultivator! That’s Foundation Establishment! If there is just one Foundation Establishment Dharma Artifact in there, my family is set for generations!’

She hurried forward, bracing against the flames while cautiously scanning her surroundings. She sent out several talismans to probe ahead, ensuring everything was safe. Only then did she finally walk up to the withered skeleton and send forth a beam of Dharma light to retrieve the storage pouch lying on the ground.

*Paff!*

The instant her light extended, the surrounding flames swarmed like starving beasts, instantly devouring the beam completely. It vanished into smoke without a trace.

Xia Shouyu hesitated for a second, then had no choice but to bend down, extending her own arm to cautiously pick it up by hand.

*Kacha.*

An extremely faint sound of friction drifted into her ear. Terror seized Xia Shouyu's heart. She tried to yank her hand back like a bolt of lightning, only to find she couldn't pull it free. Her arm was locked in an icy grip, grinding against her bones with agonizing pressure.

A skeletal white arm had risen from the ashes, its five fingers clamped precisely around her wrist.

Every hair on Xia Shouyu's body stood on end. Her Dharma power surged frantically into her trapped arm as the movement technique she had practiced for years erupted. Her free hand simultaneously shot toward the storage pouch at her own waist.

She couldn't move.

Her spiritual qi vanished as if poured into a bottomless black hole. Every motion she attempted failed. Xia Shouyu froze in place, a perfect statue of terror.

Li Ximing forced her down into a sitting position opposite him. Controlling a mere Qi Refining cultivator was utterly effortless. Slowly, flesh materialized over his skeletal face. He certainly wasn't using his true appearance. Instead, he deliberated, trying to choose the visage that looked the *least* like a good person.

As he pondered, a sinister face instantly flooded his memory: long eyebrows, gray eyes, a visage both fierce and venomous, looking perpetually ready to devour someone whole.

Li Yuanjiao.

"Second Uncle..."

Li Ximing froze, just for the briefest of moments.

Memory always strikes so suddenly, arriving like an unreasonable, brute force—a hurricane without origin or warning, smashing violently into his mind. This was Daoist Master Zhaojing. He had been hunted by a late-stage Daoist Master, had nearly lost his life in the Eastern Sea, and had not shed a single tear even when balanced on the edge of oblivion. Yet now, in this fiery pit, his eyes turned red.

Li Ximing had always been terrified of Li Yuanjiao. Strangely, he had cried when Li Yuanjiao fell, but his grief had been nothing compared to his father, Li Yuanping. In the years that followed, he rarely thought of his uncle, save for paying respects on his death anniversary. But now, in this fleeting instant, it was like seeing him again. This sudden vision was like lightning, and with it, he found he was not only unafraid—he missed him terribly.

‘Damn it.’

Li Ximing cursed inwardly. The face flickered rapidly before finally resolving into a complete, terrifying blank. It was a smooth, featureless void. Though it lacked any conventionally fierce expression, this empty visage was more horrifying than any face could ever be.

Opposite him, Xia Shouyu made no sound.

After all, she was completely immobilized; she couldn't have made a sound even if she wanted to. But her eyes were dilated to their absolute limits, as if she would lose consciousness in the very next second.



# Chapter 778: Chengming's Seclusion

Only then did Li Ximing remember Xia Shouyu. The woman was already so frightened her legs had gone soft. Seeing the dark, vacant look in her pupils, he worried that a little more time would scare her to death, leaving him with no way to find an exit. He forced the blank, white expanse of his face to split open into a mouth and spoke.

"Little friend... you've finally come."

'Which old monster's cave did I break into! I'm finished, finished! A monster like this... it's probably going to steal my body!'

After all, Xia Shouyu knew she had nothing on her person worth coveting. The only thing a high-level cultivator might possibly target was this body of hers. She wasn't afraid of losing her virtue... she was afraid of someone seizing her body for reincarnation!

Xia Shouyu scrambled on the ground, but her legs were too weak to stand. Fortunately, for this woman to have achieved her status in the marketplace, she naturally had some cunning. She spoke, trembling with dread.

"My... Milord... this humble woman is just a wandering cultivator from the Eastern Sea. I have hardly any flesh on my bones, and the Dao I cultivate is nothing special... I've offended your sacred domain by accident. If Milord has any task! Please, just command me... If you need a blood offering... please let this humble woman go out and find one for you."

Li Ximing let out a dry chuckle. "What do you mean, 'by accident'?"

When Xia Shouyu saw that he was clear-headed and wasn't immediately demanding to eat her, she felt a sliver of relief, but the terror remained an indescribable weight. She shivered.

"It... it was this lowly one, blinded by greed, who offended this sacred place..."

Li Ximing casually released his grip on her, and the woman flopped to the ground, kneeling. He corrected her, "You were *fished* over here by my Divine Ability."

'A Divine Ability? A Purple Mansion expert?!'

A chill seeped straight into Xia Shouyu's heart. She stared at the ground in disbelief. Li Ximing still wore that blank face, and she didn't dare use her spiritual sense to probe him. She could only continue to kneel, shrinking in on herself.

"You don't believe me?"

Li Ximing figured she wouldn't. He immediately raised his hand and waved it through the empty air. Xia Shouyu felt an intense heat flare through her limbs as all four were instantly incinerated to ash. With a dull thud, she dropped to the ground like a block of wood.

"Ah?"

Now limbless, Xia Shouyu lay on the ground like a human trunk, staring blankly at the ceiling of the karst cave. Above her, that faceless visage appeared once more. It blew out a breath, split its mouth open, and commanded:

"Grow!"

Xia Shouyu felt an agonizing, itching numbness at her four stumps. As if an old tree were sprouting new buds, her arms and legs burst forth from the charred wounds. The warm sensation of the ground returned beneath her.

She pushed herself up, the world spinning around her. Her newly grown limbs were even paler and more tender than before, and they felt alien to her. She stumbled and fell right back onto her knees, crying out:

"Daoist Master! I believe you... I believe you! This lowly one believes! I will follow all of the Daoist Master's commands!"

Li Ximing laughed. "That's more like it! Your body is like worthless grass to me. This Daoist Master has no interest in your mortal flesh. What matters is the task I am about to give you. If you do it well, I guarantee you will receive boundless benefits!"

Xia Shouyu couldn't possibly guess what he wanted. She could only press her forehead to the ground, awaiting his orders.

"This Daoist Master is here suppressing an object and cannot leave," Li Ximing said. "I have been hungry for a long time and have no nourishing items on hand. I require a demonic beast at the Foundation Establishment level that cultivates Valley Water. It just so happens you broke in. Bring me one demonic beast of the Valley Water virtue, and you will have earned your merit."

"Me?"

Xia Shouyu froze. The woman actually didn't agree immediately just to escape. Instead, she kept her head bowed and replied:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, this lowly one is all alone, and my cultivation is pitifully shallow... How could I possibly capture a demonic beast for you!"

Seeing her reaction, Li Ximing knew his previous display had earned her belief and awe. He adopted the tone of a Purple Mansion expert of the demonic path and said:

"Fool! I don't care what excuse you use. Say there is a great treasure here, or some spiritual item, whatever it takes. Just lure it to this spot. Once it's here, it won't be able to escape even if it has nine lives!"

"This lowly one understands!"

Xia Shouyu shuddered violently. After a moment, she asked carefully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master... this lowly one knows the territories of a few Demon Generals... The 'Valley Water' you speak of... should be one of the water virtues, but this lowly one has never seen it... I cannot be certain."

'...'

Only then did Li Ximing remember that, given the barrenness of the region, the knowledge and experience of these cultivators were probably lagging by leagues. He had no choice but to explain.

"The creek and valley are low and receptive, thus they are 'valley.' Valley Water is the water of the gully. It lies in what is stored but not yet released. In the heavens, the rain clouds are the valley, thus it is cloud water. In humans, the belly's storage is the valley, thus it is amniotic fluid. It is all manner of nourishing water that is gestating and unreleased."

'What in the world... how am I, a Qi Refining cultivator, supposed to understand a Purple Mansion expert lecturing on the Dao.'

Xia Shouyu cried out, "This lowly one does not understand..."

Li Ximing's blank face darkened. "Just go find the Demon General who is the best at healing!" he barked.

"Right away!"

*This* Xia Shouyu understood. She nodded repeatedly. Just as she was about to get up, Li Ximing commanded:

"Wait!"

He reached out a hand and tapped the woman lightly on her pale forehead. The power of a Divine Ability poured down, flowing all the way into her Juque Palace, which she herself could not see, and transformed into a wisp of purple fire that entered within.

"I can't just let you walk away so easily," he said. "I have planted a Divine Ability inside your body. If you dare to flee, this ability will detonate and kill you... This is the far reaches of the sea, and no one you beg for help can dispel it!"

Xia Shouyu was not surprised. The other party wasn't running a charity. It was perfectly normal for a mighty Purple Mansion expert to plant some safeguards. She immediately dropped back to her knees, performing a hand seal and placing her hands over her precious sea of Qi, swearing an oath.

"This lowly one has received this great kindness and will wager my life to accomplish Milord's task! If I violate this oath, may lightning strike me from above, may my Profound Core shatter, and may my path of cultivation be severed forever!"

'Lightning strike her? This truly is the backwater... the Thunder Palaces have already been dismantled, yet they still add that line to their spiritual oaths.'

Li Ximing was reasonably confident in her. He just said, "Be careful! If anyone dares to perform a soul search on you, this purple fire will explode, and you will all die... If this matter is successful, I will reward you with an Essence Gathering Pill and guarantee your path to Foundation Establishment!"

'An Essence Gathering Pill?... Could that be... the Foundation Establishment Pill?'

Although Xia Shouyu didn't know what an Essence Gathering Pill was, she certainly understood what "guarantee your path to Foundation Establishment" meant. She nodded repeatedly and backed away, flying up out of the fire and exiting the hot spring. The cold sweat that had been plastering her back finally stopped.

The night wind whipped past, making her legs feel weak. Xia Shouyu lifted her sleeve, looking at the distinct marks on her shoulder and her unnaturally pale new forearm. She felt as if she had just passed through a lifetime.

"Is this a fateful opportunity... or a path to certain death?"

...

Moongaze Lake.

Thunder rumbled low on the horizon, and rain began to fall across the island. Water vapor rose from everywhere, and a stillness fell over the land. The great hall was draped in white. Figures hurried to and fro, yet the only sounds were the drip of the rain and the shuffle of footsteps.

No one in the hall spoke. They waited until the storm swept in from the north, blurring the world into a vast sheet of rain. Only then did a streak of light weave through the downpour and land before the hall, resolving into a woman with a jade pendant at her waist. Her features were unremarkable, but she possessed a clear, sharp aura.

"Lady Xinghan!"

The cultivators on both sides bowed to her. Li Xinghan gave them a hurried nod and strode up the steps into the main hall. There, she saw Li Jiangqian descending from the upper level, dressed in white mourning robes. This First Young Master, who was acting as the family head, lowered his brows and spoke.

"Aunt, you've arrived. I was just about to send for you. I received word from Uncle Zhouluo that two more of our elders from the Zhou-generation met misfortune in Funan to the north. Their families have sent someone to collect the subsidy. I cannot make a decision on this matter; it requires an elder's approval."

Li Xinghan had been dispatched to the eastern shore to defend against cultivators from the Capital immortals Dao. But while the mission was called "defending against the Capital immortals Dao," this time it was more about dealing with demonic cultivators who had come to plunder amidst the chaos. Her sword had claimed several lives. She had seen blood since she was young and still felt it wasn't enough.

Having rushed back from the eastern shore, she now felt a pang of sadness at this news. "Which brothers and sisters were they?"

Li Jiangqian replied, "One was Uncle Zhouken from the Second Branch, early-stage Qi Refining. The other was Aunt Xingsai from the First Branch, peak Embyronic Breathing."

Li Xinghan knew both of them. Li Zhouken's innate talent had even been considered decent, and he had visited the main island in the past. Hearing this, a sour grief welled up in her heart.

"The family always insists on sending direct lineage clan members out, treating them the same as any common retainer. They are prioritized for border assignments and slaughter grounds... It is meant for training, a good intention, but unfortunately, when something like this happens, their lives are cut short."

Li Xinghan had practiced the sword since childhood and had never encountered this sort of administrative affair. She was perfectly efficient at killing people or demons, but organizing funeral matters left her at a loss. She felt a bit helpless.

"Where are the two senior elders?" she asked, referring to Li Minggong and Li Chenghuai.

Upon this question, Li Jiangqian said, "Great-Aunt Minggong and Great-Uncle Chenghuai have both entered seclusion to heal their wounds. Guest Elder Miaoshui and Elder White Ape are doing the same. Lord Cui is out searching for Protector Ding. Only Qu Bushi, Li Wen, and An Siwei are on the lake."

He paused, then added, "And Protector Chen Yang."

Strictly speaking, Chen Yang was Madam Chen's elder brother, and the biological uncle of his own second brother, Li Jianglong. His breakthrough had undoubtedly allowed the Chen Clan members on the lake to stand a little taller. The Chen Clan and the Li Clan were joined by blood, so Li Jiangqian should have been happy, but he seemed to lack any enthusiasm for the topic.

"Still no sign of Guest Elder Ding?"

Worry filled Li Xinghan's heart. Ding Weizeng's combat power was absolutely top-tier, and he had always been loyal to the family. For him to be missing for several months was deeply unsettling.

After hearing his report, she replied, "We should still gather all the brothers and sisters for a proper discussion. The family has reached this state, and we have all lost our guiding pillar. If we don't work together now, it will be a dereliction of our duty."

Li Jiangqian nodded at once and sent someone to relay the summons. "Reporting to Aunt, I must also enter seclusion soon. Although there is one last Dharma Art I haven't mastered... the matter of Foundation Establishment can no longer be delayed."

He cultivated the sixth-grade Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun. He had recently mastered the movement art Tread on Flames, the accompanying escape art Crimson Sun's Heavenly Parting, and the now-famous Sun's Resonant Parting Art. The unmastered technique he spoke of was the sixth-grade Dharma Art, Great Parting's White Brilliance. This art required Purple Mansion-level Li Fire, and there was no longer any hope of waiting for that.

Li Xinghan didn't know the details, but she nodded in response, a touch of envy in her eyes. Although she was a generation above him, she was still only at the fifth level of Qi Refining.

After a short wait, a man in black, pleated robes entered the hall. He wore a sword at his waist, his body radiating a sharp, metallic aura. He was clearly in a hurry. His cultivation had already reached the seventh level of Qi Refining.

Li Xinghan nodded. "Brother!"

Li Zhouluo responded. He had recently been in charge of Mount Qingdu and had reached the point of needing to stabilize his cultivation and practice his arts. The affairs on the lake had become increasingly numerous and hectic. Only now, sitting in the hall, did he finally have a moment to rest.

They waited a while longer, and the eldest brothers, Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang, arrived at the hall. The two brothers looked like they’d been carved from the same mold. They always went wherever they were needed and never spoke much. They offered a simple greeting and stood off to the side. Li Jiangqian immediately excused himself and withdrew.

The Zhou generation was not known for producing great talents; these few were already considered their leaders. Li Zhouluo was just about to speak when he heard the thunder and rain raging outside. A person landed before the hall, shook the rain from his robes, pushed the door open, and entered with a laugh.

"Brothers, it's rare to see you all!"

This man wore a golden lock that swayed and tinkled around his neck. His face was rather handsome, and he wore white robes, clutching a fan painted with birds, fish, and insects.

Li Zhouluo looked slightly awkward, though his expression remained mostly normal. He took a step forward to greet him. "Fifth Brother, you've come. We don't usually see you on the island. What a coincidence you're here today."

Li Xinghan glanced over. The newcomer was none other than the Daoist Master's direct grandson, Li Zhouming. His early-stage Qi Refining cultivation was the lowest among them all. Li Xinghan had almost never seen him. She gave a slight bow and replied, "Today I finally have the chance to meet Fifth Brother."

Li Zhouming smiled, bowing left and right. He hitched up his robes, stepped into the courtyard, and snapped his fan shut in his palm. "Same here. A while back, I ran afoul of the Old Master and got a fierce tongue-lashing. He told me to turn over a new leaf and start acting decent. So, I had no choice but to come over to the island to take a look... and listen to what's going on."

"Good."

Li Zhouluo accepted this. He held the highest post among the brothers present. With Li Zhouwei absent, it was natural that he would lead. He lowered his voice.

"That child Jiangqian needs to enter seclusion for Foundation Establishment, which means someone needs to manage the island's affairs. Jiangxia and Jianglong are both good kids, but they each hold important positions. Placing either of them in charge of the island would show favoritism... I asked the Old Master, and he said the choice should come from the Zhou-generation... What do my younger brothers and sister think?"

As soon as Li Zhouluo finished speaking, Li Zhouming tucked his fan away and grinned. "Well, naturally, Brother, you have the most prestige! Just let Brother manage the family affairs. There's nothing more to say! Nothing at all!"

He tapped the fan against his robes. The brothers Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang remained silent as always. Li Xinghan also just held her sword, saying nothing. Seeing this scene, Li Zhouming just said, "So that settles it? I thought it was some big crisis."

Li Xinghan finally couldn't hold back. She spoke up, "Brother... when the Old Master said the choice should come from the Zhou-generation, did he mean we are choosing one of the *young masters*, or choosing one of *us* from the Zhou-generation?"

Li Zhouluo, who was the most handsome of the group, replied in a clear voice, "The Old Master was afraid the young masters would be dissatisfied. He is hoping to pick from among us brothers. After all, it is only to manage things temporarily for a few years..."

Only then did Li Xinghan find the will to nod. Although she was often away, she was aware of her brother's political achievements. At present, there was truly no other candidate besides him. She hesitated, thinking:

'The Youngest Branch has never had a precedent of managing the family affairs... Do the two Foundation Establishment elders know about this? If this was the Old Master's order, it's no different than directly appointing Fourth Brother to take charge...'



# Chapter 779: The Rules

After a moment's consideration, Li Xinghan made a mental note to ask Li Xuanxuan about this later. Outwardly, she accepted the decision.

"Since the elder has commanded it, then we will have to trouble you, Brother."

Li Zhouluo was dressed in black. He cultivated the Gleaming Gold Qi, and regardless of his personality, his aura possessed a certain stern quality that inspired confidence. He clasped his hands in a salute and said solemnly, "Rest assured, little sister."

Nearby, Li Zhouming looked from one to the other, wanting to speak but hesitating. Li Zhouluo had managed Mount Qingdu and had punished Li Zhouming several times before, so he was naturally afraid of him. And though his younger sister Li Xinghan was young, the sword on her back and the heavy killing intent she carried were just as intimidating. He couldn't bring himself to say anything.

Li Xinghan couldn't muster any affection for the Purple Mansion expert's direct grandson, either. The Daoist Master had few descendants to begin with, and the one he finally got was utterly useless. Though Li Xinghan was often away, she had heard the rumors.

'I've heard... that when he's assigned to a post, he becomes greedy, yet in the clan center, he's burdened by incompetence. The Daoist Master doesn't value him and hasn't given him any decent Dharma Artifacts. He's useless in a fight, nearly losing to a cultivator from some minor family. He's a complete disgrace. The old man is just afraid of losing his only direct grandson... He sees him idling about all day and just wants him to stay out of trouble...'

In the end, Li Zhouming was a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion cultivator. For the Daoist Master's sake, it was no great burden for the family to support him. But Li Xinghan disliked him intensely. She turned to leave, but as she reached the hall's entrance, she saw the Li Zhoufang brothers following her fourth brother, Li Zhouluo, their heads bowed low. She vaguely overheard their voices:

'We two brothers... our father worked himself to death on the river, and now our younger brother is also dead... Regarding the clan's compensation, we hope you can grant his child a sinecure...'

Only then did Li Xinghan remember that the deceased Li Zhouken was, in fact, the biological younger brother of the Li Zhoufang brothers, given up for adoption to carry on another family line. The two were taciturn in front of elders but cared deeply for the younger generation of their own branch. They were here to beg for an official post.

'One should receive resources from the island commensurate with one's talent and effort... Sinecures are usually reserved for outsiders. The clan fears its own descendants will become complacent through generations of entitlement and rarely does such a thing... aigh!'

Li Xinghan realized that her first and second elder brothers were excellent in every way, save for a powerful obsession with this idea of hereditary privilege. She couldn't help but pause, wanting to go back and say something, but she heard a voice call out from behind her.

"Sister!"

It was Li Zhouming, who had followed her out.

'Forget it... Brother Zhouluo should be able to handle this.'

Li Xinghan had no choice but to stop. Facing the fan-wielding young man, she remained polite. "Fifth Brother, is there something you need?"

Li Zhouming clasped his hands together and smiled. "I heard that sister will be leading a group to the western deserts to eliminate a band of rogue demonic cultivators. I've heard there's a type of material in the desert called White Falcon Gold, which can't be bought on the lake. It can be used to forge Dharma Artifacts. Could I trouble you to bring some back for me? I'll compensate you with spiritual resources."

Li Xinghan was a little surprised. "You're starting to think about Dharma Artifacts? That's wonderful news. I'll be sure to bring it for you."

Li Zhouming let out a breath of relief, thanked her profusely, and scurried off. The woman, meanwhile, mounted the wind and flew toward the island's center, a thought turning over in her mind.

'How strange.'

Pondering this, she first detoured to her own cave-residence to pack. By the time the sky began to dim, she landed before a courtyard on the island. The two kumquat pots that used to flank the gate had been replaced with stone lions treading on golden rocks. The woman sized them up for a moment, hesitating.

"So much more extravagant!"

Pushing the gate open, a smile finally appeared on Li Xinghan's face. "Mother!" she called out.

The woman was instantly overjoyed and hurried to greet her. A man tasting wine in the courtyard looked over, and her brother and sister-in-law put down what they were doing and rushed out from the inner room. The whole family immediately pulled her inside with cheerful commotion.

In truth, Li Xinghan's family had once been fraught with conflict. Her father's cultivation was mediocre and he felt unappreciated, while her brother and sister-in-law had even harbored thoughts of splitting from the family. No one cared whether she came home or not. But ever since she had descended from Gardenia Scenery Mountain, her brother and sister-in-law couldn't be driven away. The house was filled with laughter day in and day out, and every time she returned, it felt like a festival.

She was pulled down to sit beside her father, listening to her mother, whose face was beaming. "Han'er! Your uncle has been accumulating merit for so long, he's finally been promoted to be an aide on Wutu Peak!"

A peak aide was already a high position in the Li family, with very few openings. Moreover, Wutu Peak was considered prosperous. Li Xinghan was delighted. "He's finally made it!"

But after the initial joy, something felt wrong. Her uncle was stained by his connection to the remnants of the Yu Clan, and his cultivation wasn't high. Logically, it should have been very difficult for him to be appointed to such a position. Her smile faded. "When was the appointment made?"

Her mother smiled. "It was announced at noon. He was just as surprised and delighted. This position is a great honor. I heard he's been so busy he still hasn't come back..."

'Noon?'

A jolt went through Li Xinghan's heart.

'I had only just left... and Brother Zhouluo specifically promoted him...'

The joy drained from Li Xinghan's face, replaced by a sense of confusion. She held her bamboo chopsticks, unable to decide whether to pick up the food before her. She fell silent.

Li Xinghan asked herself honestly: the Jade True Qi she cultivated, the Treasured Qi of True Unity, was the result of her uncle, Chi Tiaozong, giving up his own cultivation to sit at an altar year after year, chanting sutras to gather it for her. To put it bluntly, the fact that she had earned the Daoist Master's favor and might one day reach Foundation Establishment was at least half due to her uncle's efforts.

Even in her early days, her uncle had provided more than enough help with resources and guidance on her path. While her current cultivation was indeed mostly thanks to the clan's support, it was her uncle who had helped her stand out in the first place.

Her silence grew heavier. Seeing her expression, her family in the courtyard suddenly quieted down. Her father, beside her, glanced at her and said in a low voice, "Zhouluo is in charge of the family today, and you are one of the most prominent figures of the Zhou generation. Some things you just have to accept. Your uncle has worked hard for decades; it's time he received his reward."
 
"Are you going to be an ungrateful wretch and ask your fourth brother to retract the order? Is your uncle not doing his job correctly, or is your fourth brother's promotion based on merit not just? You had better give me a reason!"

It was true that Chi Tiaozong was competent, but it was also true that Li Zhouluo had promoted him as a favor to thank her for her support. Her uncle had finally achieved a breakthrough in his official career. Li Xinghan truly could not bring herself to refuse this kindness...

Li Xinghan usually looked down on those who engaged in favoritism, but at this moment, her lips parted and closed, unable to form a single word. She put down her chopsticks and said quietly, "Let's just cherish this... I am away all year. The family should carry on as usual. Don't be extravagant, especially since the elders are in mourning. It's best to keep things simple."

The middle-aged man beside her put down his wine. "Eldest son, tomorrow you will sell the stone lions at the gate and put the two kumquat pots back."

"But Father, you just carefully picked those out a few days ago, you were so happy... you were always going to the gate to look at them... why sell them now..." her brother lamented.

His wife shushed him. She took Li Xinghan's hand and said in a low voice, "Speaking of the elders' affairs... you're an important figure on the island now. Your own safety comes first. If anything happens to you, all of this family's hopes will be ruined."

Before Li Xinghan could answer, her father spoke with earnest gravity. "We all understand... serving the lake is important. But while serving the lake, letting your own friends and family benefit a little is not a conflict of interest. Who can truly act like a saint, completely untainted by personal gain?"

"Daughter understands."

Li Xinghan listlessly ate a few bites, finding it hard to swallow. She knew her father was about to start asking for a post for her brother, so she quickly excused herself from the table. Her father said nothing, but her mother saw her all the way out.

Outside the courtyard, her spiritual sense could still clearly perceive the scene within. Without her, the large table of food seemed suddenly empty. Her mother was wiping away tears, her father was sighing, and her brother and sister-in-law exchanged a glance. There was a long silence, until she heard her father's voice.

"She fancies herself too pure... without her, there's still your uncle. You won't be short an official post. It just won't look as good and might attract the attention of the Clan Justicar from Mount Qingdu. Tomorrow, you'll come with me..."

Li Xinghan couldn't bear to listen anymore. She walked away quickly, mounted the wind, and let the cold night air rush against her face, her heart bleak.

'Pure? If I were truly like Great-Aunt Minggong and the others, who think only of the good of the lake, my uncle wouldn't have a post to begin with! It's just that I care more about appearances... In the end... his favor wasn't great enough to command me...'

Since childhood, Li Xinghan had held to her Sword Heart, upholding justice and eradicating evil. Now, a thought was gradually becoming clear in her mind.

"I used to think that the constant favoritism on the island was a failure of Mount Qingdu's duty. Now it seems, this is a justice I cannot even uphold myself."

She rode the wind all the way to Mount Qingdu. The side peak was draped in white. An old man, leaning on a staff, was pacing on the summit. Li Xinghan had never seen him rest, and this time was no exception. She bowed.

"Old Master!"

Li Xuanxuan merely glanced at her. "Xinghan, you're here! Is it about Zhouluo's matter? Come inside and talk."

Li Xuanxuan's seniority was immense. Li Xinghan followed respectfully behind him into a pavilion. Once inside, Li Xinghan said deferentially, "The Old Master's orders are naturally well-considered. This junior has no objections. In the family, only Fourth Brother is capable of this great responsibility. It is just that this junior has just gotten a taste of clan affairs and is about to depart again, and my heart is somewhat uneasy..."

She hesitated for a few breaths, then said anxiously, "On the lake... there is much favoritism... cultivators value personal relationships heavily... Xinghan... is guilty!"

Li Xinghan recounted what had happened with her family. Li Xuanxuan stopped what he was doing and nodded silently. The old man sighed. "Xinghan... how old is your father? What is his cultivation level?"

Li Xinghan quickly cupped her hands. "My father is forty-seven years old, at the fourth level of Embyronic Breathing."

Li Xuanxuan nodded slowly. "That child... his path of cultivation, for this life, has already come to an end. He has but a few decades left. Xinghan... can you reach Foundation Establishment?"

Li Xinghan gave a slight nod. "This child will do her best. There is still hope."

The old man let out a long sigh. "And Purple Mansion?"

Li Xinghan could only say, "I dare not hope for it!"

Li Xuanxuan said in a low voice, "For many people in this world, the road of cultivation stops very early. It's not just you who doesn't think about the Purple Mansion Realm; even the young masters rarely dare to hope for it. For all of you, once you reach Foundation Establishment, your cultivation has nearly reached its limit. But you have a great deal of time left."

"On this lake, cultivators like your father are countless. Eighty percent of cultivators stop at Embyronic Breathing. A small portion manage to refine some miscellaneous qi, but their path also ends. The rest get stuck in Qi Refining; most can't advance after a few levels. And then there's the last handful, stuck at the peak of Qi Refining."

The old man seemed to be in a daze. "They have no further path in the Dao. Their cultivation for this life is over. What can they do with the hundreds of years of time they have left? When these cultivators who can't advance a single step have nothing to do, who can control them? No one can!"

Li Xinghan remained silent.

Li Xuanxuan continued languidly, "Don't underestimate them. Preying on mortals, taking a thousand wives and concubines, murdering for blood, cultivating demonic arts—they are capable of all of it! The fact that they now engage in favoritism and scheme for the security of their descendants is already the best possible outcome under our guidance."

The old man said quietly, "Xijun created such a complex, clearly stratified system of bureaucracy, relationships, supervision, and motivation for a reason... Han'er... sometimes we don't need them... but keeping them busy is very important, for us and for the mortals. We can't always keep them busy with merit alone."

Li Xinghan stared blankly at the old man before her.

Li Xuanxuan said, "Later, Zhouwei found various excellent medicines for breaking through bottlenecks. Some of them weren't as useful as imagined, but they had to make sure their descendants were well-arranged before they would be willing to enter seclusion to risk their lives for that slim chance of a breakthrough... A certain degree of sheltering descendants, of relying on personal connections to seek office, is not necessarily an evil thing."

"In the current age, with people everywhere refining blood essence, you cannot hold them to too high a standard."

Li Xinghan clenched her fists slightly. The treasured sword on her back glinted coldly in the moonlight. She asked in a low voice, "Old Master... but is this... truly in accordance with the righteous path..."

The old man leaned back in his chair, his snow-white beard resting on the back of his wrinkled hand. Li Xuanxuan seemed tired. He said softly, "We cannot control a group of eternally greedy people... we can only redirect their greed elsewhere. Han'er, things are not accomplished overnight. Perhaps your generation will have a better way, but to protect the peace of the mortals, this is how it must be for now."

The confusion in Li Xinghan's eyes slowly cleared. She nodded thoughtfully.

"Xinghan, I already spoke with your fourth brother about this in the morning. I only want you to understand one principle."

The old man was hunched in the high-backed mahogany chair, shrinking into the shadows of the room. For a moment, he seemed incredibly ancient. His voice was extremely soft.

"Many things that seem to be outside the rules are, in fact, within them."

...

Island Center.

The night was thick. The great hall was still brightly lit, with scrolls and documents stacked high on the desk. Li Zhouluo read through them carefully, one hand propping up his head, lost in thought.

It was his first time in control of the Pingya Island, and he felt a great unease. After settling matters with his siblings in the morning, he had been busy in this spot until now. He had only just learned many of the clan's secrets.

'So... so many of the retainers are directly subordinate to the island. The family has quite a few geniuses from outside clans. There are even two who failed their Foundation Establishment breakthrough on the island...'

He examined the documents in detail. Well past midnight, he heard someone come up to report.

"My lord, the Third Young Master has returned from the eastern shore. He is waiting outside the hall."

Li Zhouluo quickly put down his brush. "Quickly, show him in."



# Chapter 780: Seeking the Pill

A moment later, a golden-eyed young man clad in armor entered the hall. Li Jiangxia was tall, a full head taller than even Li Zhouluo. Upon seeing him, he bowed low, resembling a crouching bear.

"Greetings, Fourth Uncle!" he said in a rumbling voice.

Li Zhouluo quickly helped him up. Li Jiangxia’s expression was grim. "Uncle Zhouluo," he said quietly, "I have been guarding the eastern shore all these days, but no news of my father has come from the clan. I could no longer restrain my anxiety. I also have matters to report, so I came back personally to ask you."

Li Zhouluo then recalled that the Second Young Master, Li Jianglong, had returned with Li Minggong and the others. He had learned the news long ago and even attended Li Chenghui’s funeral. But at that time, Cui Jueyin was not on the Eastern Shore, which was also swarming with demonic cultivators looking to make a fortune. Li Jiangxia, as the only one who could make decisions, had been unable to leave the dangerous roads. He could only pay his respects from afar. Now that things had stabilized, he had returned with the Profound Peak cultivators to report.

"There is no news," Li Zhouluo replied. "But he should be safe and sound... How are the Profound Peak cultivators?"

"Kong Guxi has returned. Fourth Uncle can ask him for the details... I came this time... to ask for men."

Li Zhouluo frowned. "What is the situation?"

Li Jiangxia looked troubled. "The Capital immortals Dao forces have not continued west. They are even pulling people back. But the nearby demonic cultivators heard that our clan's Purple Mansion expert is indisposed, and they’ve been paying frequent visits, hoping to rob us blind. Feeling that there is safety in numbers, they come in groups of three and five..."

"At first, it was just minor skirmishes. But over time, they realized there were no serious consequences. These past few days, it has become more intense. We have even spotted the shadows of Foundation Establishment cultivators."

"Several of the Profound Peak experts are injured, leaving only Sect Master Kong... we are stretched dangerously thin. I was hoping to ask the clan to send a few experts to help."

Li Zhouluo looked somewhat awkward. "It is not easy for anyone in the clan to leave right now. All the powerful elders are in seclusion... There are demonic cultivators in the desert as well. I am already preparing to send Li Wen and Qu Bushi there with Xinghan. It will take several days."

Li Jiangxia sighed.

Li Zhouluo then said, "You wait here a moment. I will see Chen Yang and have him make a trip to the Eastern Shore... His combat ability is strong, and his Immortal Foundation excels at fighting multiple opponents. He is the most suitable choice."

Li Jiangxia had no choice but to nod. He did not immediately withdraw, however, but hesitated before speaking again. "I also came... to request one of the clan's Essence Gathering Pills from uncle."

Li Zhouluo frowned instantly, shooting him a puzzled look. The young man before him was clearly only at the fifth level of Qi Refining. "You are still a long way from Foundation Establishment," he asked. "And even if your cultivation were high enough... would you not practice your techniques first? The clan will naturally prepare a pill for you. Why are you in such a hurry?"

Li Jiangxia hesitated briefly before replying, "This is a request to *trade* for it... I have a sworn friend named Pei Xie, a man of the wilderness. He has reached the late stage of Qi Refining and lacks only this pill to break through. If the clan has a quota, I would like to exchange for one on his behalf."

Realization dawned on Li Zhouluo. He shook his head. "What is the meaning of this! Since you are confident he can break through to Foundation Establishment, and he is your sworn friend, the clan is in desperate need of manpower. We can simply grant it to him. Have him come to the lake to receive his orders. I will see him myself."

At these words, Li Jiangxia looked very uncomfortable. "Reporting to Fourth Uncle... Brother Pei has other plans. He intends to break through in the Eastern Sea and adventure overseas..."

"This!"

Li Zhouluo was stunned. He was secretly displeased.

'From the sound of it... he wants to use the clan's resources to curry favor for himself! We don't even know if this man can break through... giving this to some rogue cultivator from the wilderness is like tossing a meat bun at a dog! It will be gone for good!'

He fell silent, and Li Jiangxia immediately understood his thoughts. "That is why this nephew thought to *trade* for it from the clan..."

Li Zhouluo let out a long sigh and shook his head. "How can this be a simple matter of a trade!"

With Li Ximing missing, if he was injured and healing overseas, he might not return for twenty or even fifty years. Every Essence Gathering Pill used was one less they had. This was not merely a question of value. Under the joint monopoly held by the Purple Mansion clans of Jiangnan, the Essence Gathering Pill had long since achieved a status far exceeding its intrinsic worth.

The Xiao Clan always minded their own business, and Xiao Chuting was wandering the four seas—even the Xiao family couldn't find him. They were also eating into their own stockpile of Essence Gathering Pills. It wasn't easy for the Li Clan to get any from them, either.

After he sighed, the young man before him seemed entirely unsurprised. He bowed.

"This junior is willing to relinquish my own future pill allotment to take this one. When the time comes for this junior's Foundation Establishment... if nothing has changed, I will no longer ask the clan for one!"

"You..."

Li Zhouluo shook his head. "Get up, quickly. What is this nonsense? How could the clan deprive you of your pill? You have long had a reputation for judging character, so I naturally trust you. What Dao path does he cultivate? It's not Merging Fire, is it?"

He made a small joke. Li Jiangxia was overjoyed. "Of course not! Brother Pei cultivates the Attainment of the Western Gaze, a path of the Metal Virtue."

"Metal Virtue... Many of Jiangnan's wandering cultivators do indeed cultivate the Metal Virtue... We have one in the stores. Take my writ and go get it."

Li Jiangxia let out a breath of relief, nodding repeatedly before quickly withdrawing. Li Zhouluo, however, was lost in thought.

'I suspect this Pei Xie has been planning to attempt his breakthrough for a long time... He just wasn't confident he could ask for the pill... The moment I take charge, this kid runs right over to request it!

Among the recent managers of the clan, he truly was the easiest to talk to on this matter. After all, Li Zhouluo figured he would only be in this position for three to five years. Li Jiangxia's talent was so high; naturally, Li Zhouluo was willing to sell a favor and have the young man owe him one.

He paced for two steps, adjusted his composure, and sat back down in the main seat.

"Send in the Sect Master of Profound Peak!" he announced.

Barely ten breaths later, an old man hurried in. His hair was white, his features withered. Upon seeing Li Zhouluo, he dropped to his knees with a thud.

"Greetings, Clan Lord! Everyone at Profound Peak is grateful to the noble clan for saving our lives! Guxi is here to thank the noble clan on behalf of all of Profound Peak!"

Li Zhouluo was somewhat astonished. This was the first time Kong Guxi had ever performed a full kneeling kowtow to someone of his status. Previously, he only knelt so completely before the Daoist Master. When meeting the Li Clan Lord, he almost always offered a cupped-fist salute.

"Sect Master Kong, please rise, quickly!"

But Kong Guxi did not get up.

In Kong Guxi's eyes, the Li Clan's benevolence and righteousness had reached the absolute limit. This Sect Master of Profound Peak was kneeling out of deep, genuine emotion. Tears flowed uncontrollably from his eyes, and a low sob escaped his throat.

The Capital immortals Dao's attack had resulted in the disappearance of the Li Clan's Purple Mansion expert, Daoist Master Zhaojing, and the Clan Lord and Purple Mansion seed, Li Zhouwei. And in Kong Guxi's view, this entire disaster had started because of his Profound Peak Gate! How could this not move the old man to his very core?

Now that the storm had passed, even the few young Foundation Establishment cultivators in his own Profound Peak Gate had fallen silent. Kong Qiuyan, who had once been inscrutable and deep-thinking, was now personally descending to heal the Li Clan's cultivators. Even the long-suffering Kong Xiaxiang had begun patrolling the entire Eastern Shore on the Li Clan's behalf, not to mention the elder Kong Guli... His old brother had nearly refused treatment for his own wounds, insisting on coming to the lake to offer a humble, profound apology!

'The bonds of blood and ties of brotherhood are nothing compared to that Daoist Master's single promise... My Profound Peak... owes the Li Clan an immense debt!'



# Chapter 781: A Lesson

Seeing the man’s display, Li Zhouluo had no choice but to rise from his seat and step aside. “Sect Master Kong, please, rise at once. You are a Foundation Establishment cultivator and an elder… you honor me too greatly.”

Kong Guxi did not wait to be helped. He rose in a single, fluid motion, his voice low and deferential. “In the face of saving our entire lineage, the distinction of elder means nothing. The younger generation of my family is boundlessly grateful to your clan. The Profound Peak Gate has preserved the spark of its existence today solely because of Moongaze Lake. From this day forward, any command from the lake will be met without question.”

Li Zhouluo nodded. Moongaze Lake’s position was precarious, and they were in the delicate process of easing tensions with the Capital immortals Dao across the shore. The last thing he needed was for the Profound Peak Gate to do something rash. “For now, you may use the territories on the eastern shore as a temporary station,” he said softly. “It would be best if you patrolled them, but there is no need to do anything more… As for the matter with the White Ye Immortal Sect, I must ask you to endure the humiliation for the time being. Do not provoke them again and cause further trouble.”

Kong Guxi nodded vigorously, vowing, “I have already instructed my juniors. The Profound Peak Gate is weak. We will be exceedingly polite even to independent cultivators and will never cross the river to cause trouble again. If we bring any more problems to your clan… you won’t have to lift a finger. I will personally deal with any of my foolish disciples.”

“Just be sure not to cause any trouble,” Li Zhouluo cautioned. “If you do, it will be a matter far greater than one or two disciples.”

Kong Guxi agreed. Li Zhouluo continued, “The wilderness is no ordinary place; the various major families will not allow them to occupy it for long. Once the Daoist Masters have concluded their discussions, the Capital immortals Dao will certainly withdraw, and you will be able to return… For now, how many disciples have you managed to gather?”

At the mention of this, a chill like a block of ice settled in Kong Guxi’s heart. “Reporting to the Family Head,” he said in a low voice, “aside from a few core Foundation Establishment cultivators, we have four at the Qi Refining stage, ten at the miscellaneous Qi stage, and several at the Embyronic Breathing stage…”

He found the words difficult to say. “When our mountain gate fell, some surrendered and some died. We managed to gather a few more after relocating to the wilderness, only to be attacked again. The Capital immortals Dao sent the very cultivators who had surrendered to us to win over the rest. Their loyalty wavered.”

After so many defeats, even the most loyal disciples knew the Profound Peak Gate was beyond saving. Though Kong Guxi had repeatedly promised that a Purple Mansion expert would soon emerge, his followers knew they might not live to see that day. The Capital immortals Dao also had a Purple Mansion Realm master. What retribution would they face in the future if they didn’t surrender now?

Thus, during their decline in the wilderness, the Profound Peak Gate not only lost a great number of loyal scions from allied families but also had its ranks of common disciples utterly gutted.

‘Alas!’

The Profound Peak Gate, once one of the great Three Sects and Seven Gates, was now reduced to a handful of nobodies. Such a small group wouldn’t have been enough to even establish a single hall in the sect’s former glory. Li Zhouluo could only remain silent.

Kong Guxi asked tentatively, “I have seen many independent cultivators on the eastern shore. The Profound Peak Gate was hoping to send someone to see about recruiting a few disciples…”

The eastern shore had always been the Li family’s territory, so Kong Guxi naturally did not dare overstep. He couldn’t recruit from the local clans, so his only option was to try his luck with the unaffiliated cultivators.

“That should not be an issue,” Li Zhouluo replied. “However, Sect Master, you must be careful. The character of these independent cultivators is hard to discern. Do not tarnish the name of the Profound Peak Gate.”

Kong Guxi nodded repeatedly. He found this new Family Head of the Zhou generation to be more approachable than his predecessors, and a wave of relief washed over him. Having received permission, he hadn’t even fully expressed his gratitude before he produced a jade box from his sleeve.

“The Profound Peak Gate has lost nearly all its members, leaving many of our Dharma artifacts unused,” he said respectfully. “They are wasted in our hands, and with the recent surge of demonic cultivators, our defenses are strained. I thought it best to deliver them into the hands of your clan’s cultivators, where they can be put to good use.”

“What is the meaning of this, Sect Master?” Li Zhouluo demurred as a matter of politeness.

Kong Guxi immediately gave him an out. “I have no other intention. My sect is all but empty, and my few remaining juniors cannot unleash the full power of these artifacts. They are constantly getting injured, and I fear for their futures. If we could ask your clan’s Foundation Establishment cultivators to wield them, each artifact would be used to its full potential. This is merely a measure to ensure the safety of my young ones.”

He pressed on, “And I heard that the lake was planning to send experts to help us defend against the demonic cultivators. This makes me feel even more indebted… We can’t let your clan’s cultivators make the trip for nothing…”

Li Zhouluo went back and forth with him for a while, feigning that he was being worn down by the old man’s persistence, before finally relenting. Kong Guxi eagerly opened the jade box, revealing a chain of glittering, crimson jade fragments.

The old man supported the base of the box with one hand and with the other, he lifted the strand of fragmented jade beads. He draped it over four fingers, his trembling index finger coming to rest against his middle finger. “This is an heirloom of my sect,” he said with a smile, “the Crimson Orb Jade. Worn around the neck, it can invigorate one’s blood and Qi and protect the body. It is quite formidable. It was once an ancient Dharma artifact, capable of transforming into a crimson jade chain to suppress enemies, but it can no longer do so.”

Noticing Li Zhouluo’s expression, he quickly explained, “It was shattered in a battle long ago… A Daoist Master later pieced it back together, so it no longer qualifies as an ancient Dharma artifact… but it is still powerful…”

He placed the necklace back and lifted the false bottom of the box. Beneath it lay a small, transparent glass vial containing a gray, scale-like object. “This was left behind by my sect’s Daoist Master,” Kong Guxi said. “He once answered the call of another Daoist Master to slay a demon in the sea and obtained this spiritual item. It is a scale from a Purple Mansion demon beast. While not a true Purple Mansion-level material, it can be considered a resource for one… If your clan has need of it, it would make for excellent armor.”

“I once overheard the Daoist Master say that if forged properly, the result might not be inferior to an ancient Dharma artifact.”

Besides the glass vial in the center, there were two other Foundation Establishment Dharma artifacts, one on each side. Their quality was average, hardly worth mentioning, with only a jade slip beside them for identification. After presenting these items, Kong Guxi finally took a pair of small, brightly shining cymbals from his sleeve. They were covered in intricate patterns and looked like two miniature straw hats.

His voice choked with emotion. “This last item… was prepared for Daoist Friend Chenghui’s descendant… But I heard he passed away in his prime, without even leaving behind a bloodline. I am overcome with shame. I can only ask the Family Head to accept this on his behalf… as a token of the Profound Peak Gate’s gratitude!”

Li Zhouluo could see clearly that these cymbals were forged from Geng Metal combined with the essence of another lineage—he couldn’t tell if it was True Qi or Purple Qi—and it radiated a sense of unified, balanced power. Not only were they formidable, but even an injured lightning cultivator could wield them without the slightest discomfort. It was clear Kong Guxi had put a great deal of thought into this…

But Li Zhouluo himself cultivated the path of Geng Metal. Whether this gift was truly for some supposed descendant or intended for him was, frankly, debatable.

‘What a clever man, this Sect Master Kong,’ the young man thought.

He set the jade box aside and singled out the cymbals. “Since this is a gift for an elder’s descendant,” he announced, “Someone attend me!”

A Jade Court cultivator stepped forward.

“Take this item and deliver it to the clan treasury,” Li Zhouluo commanded.

He had the cymbals taken away right in front of Kong Guxi, who showed no sign of awkwardness. The sect master simply nodded repeatedly. “Such artifacts are rare these days and extremely useful in battle… The functions of all the items are detailed in the jade slip in the box. I shall take my leave now.”

As the sect master hurried out, Li Zhouluo returned to his seat. The court guard returned, knelt on one knee with his head bowed, and presented the cymbals with both hands.

“Reporting to the Family Head, the grade of the treasure has not been determined. I do not know which treasury to store it in.”

Slightly surprised, Li Zhouluo looked at the artifact in the man’s palms. “Quick-witted. Which family are you from?”

“This servant’s surname is Dili, with the given name Guang,” the guard replied. “I am from the royal house of the Northern Mountain Yue.”

‘Dili… once a lowly surname among the Mountain Yue, and now they are royalty…’

Li Zhouluo gave a slight nod. The royal house of the Northern Mountain Yue sounded impressive, but in reality, they were nothing compared to the likes of the An, Chen, Dou, and Xu families—only slightly better than a humble clan.

Dili Guang had a sharp mind and had sought confirmation, but Li Zhouluo truly had no intention of coveting the artifact. “It is a peak-grade item for the Foundation Establishment realm. Send it to Mount Qingdu for the venerable elder to appraise.”

Just as Dili Guang was about to leave, Li Zhouluo stopped him. “You are on duty on the twenty-second… For the next two years, serve in the main hall. After that, you will attend me directly. I’ve received word from the venerable elder and must go see him now.”

Before he could even leave the great hall, a messenger announced that Chen Yang was waiting outside. Li Zhouluo held his elder brother’s capable subordinate in high esteem and gestured for Dili Guang to depart.

A young man in soft armor entered the hall, a broad smile on his face. He knelt as soon as he was inside, observing all proper etiquette before speaking.

“Chen Yang greets the Family Head!”

Li Zhouluo nodded. “Congratulations. Your breakthrough comes as a great relief to the clan in this pressing time!”

Chen Yang remained kneeling as he listened, only rising after the Family Head had spoken. A fierce light glinted in his eyes. “Family Head, I’ve heard that a number of demonic cultivators are causing trouble on the eastern shore. At a time like this, how dare one or two of them target Moongaze Lake? Please, allow me to make a trip and give them a taste of our strength!”

This was exactly what Li Zhouluo had in mind. Among his trusted followers, Chen Yang possessed a high-grade Immortal Foundation and was skilled in combat. “That is precisely why I’ve called you,” he said. “I need you to go. The Profound Peak Gate has just delivered some Dharma artifacts under the pretext of aiding the eastern shore. Take them with you. It will both enhance your strength and serve as a response to them.”

Li Zhouluo immediately took the Crimson Orb Jade from the box, along with a shield and a small pagoda from the lower compartment, and placed them in Chen Yang’s hands.

“Take your pick between the shield and the pagoda, whichever you find more suitable. Take the Crimson Orb Jade as well. With these two artifacts, head to the eastern shore…” he said in a low voice. “Your priority, as always, is self-preservation. With your strong foundation and powerful artifacts, a few demonic cultivators should not be able to trouble you. Just be careful.”

Chen Yang picked up the jade slip and read it, a thoughtful expression on his face. He then picked up the shield, a hint of doubt in his eyes. “Family Head, at this point, I find it unlikely that these demonic cultivators are acting on the orders of some Purple Mansion master. After all, those who should have been offended have been, and those who wished to stay out of it have long since extricated themselves. If it were simple robbery, one or two incidents would be reasonable, but so many demonic cultivators… several at the Foundation Establishment Realm, even. What could they possibly hope to plunder on the eastern shore?”

Li Zhouluo frowned. “What are you suggesting…”

“I am not yet certain,” Chen Yang replied softly. “It seems they have ulterior motives, yet it doesn’t feel like they are targeting our family specifically. The eastern shore and the wilderness have no clear border; their territories are deeply intertwined. I will investigate once I arrive. If the Capital immortals Dao on the wilderness side has also been attacked, it’s possible these demonic cultivators are someone else’s subordinates, and we have merely been caught in the crossfire.”

“I’ll leave this matter in your hands.”

Finding merit in his reasoning, Li Zhouluo entrusted the task to him. Chen Yang quickly departed. Ever respectful of his elders, Li Zhouluo remembered Li Xuanxuan’s summons and flew directly toward Mount Qingdu without a moment’s rest.

Crossing the lake, he soon saw the vibrant glow of the Five Waters Imperial Heaven Array. He descended from the sky, landing on a side peak. An old man, dressed formally in blue and black robes, sat silently within a pavilion.

Li Zhouluo landed at the edge of the courtyard and walked the rest of the way. The venerable elder’s seniority was so great that even his own father would have to approach on foot. Upon entering the pavilion, he bowed deeply.

“Greetings, venerable elder.”

“Come.”

Li Xuanxuan smiled kindly upon seeing him and had someone serve tea. He waited for Li Zhouluo to be seated before dismissing the attendants on both sides. Only then did he ask, “I heard you gave an Essence Gathering Pill to the third boy?”

The moment he heard this, Li Zhouluo instinctively knew something was wrong. He steeled himself. “That is correct, venerable elder.”

Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment before speaking, his voice aged. “The Essence Gathering Pills are, after all, precious. Every single one that is used is known to the clan elders. I made a special inquiry with Jiangxia and learned that he requested it for a friend…”

“This matter… you acted without sufficient thought.”

The words struck Li Zhouluo like a physical blow. He began to sweat. It was only because Li Xuanxuan had always been protective of the younger generation, never airing dirty laundry in public. But with the elder’s prestige, that single sentence was enough. From now on, it wouldn’t matter if Li Zhouluo managed the family well or poorly—in the eyes of many, it would be poorly.

“Please, elder, enlighten me!”

He responded, and Li Xuanxuan only sighed. “A single pill is not a great matter, and we need not be so calculative. The problem lies in taking it for private use. you have only just taken charge of the family and have yet to establish your prestige. This affair reflects poorly on you…”

“That Pei Xie is said to be a first-rate fighter. You should have at least organized a competition, invited all the unaffiliated cultivators at the peak of Qi Refining to participate, and awarded it as the grand prize. That way, everyone would have been convinced… You have no prestige of your own, and the pill did not come from your own resources… How could this be appropriate?”

The old man seemed anxious. His withered hand repeatedly pressed down on his teacup, then lifted, then pressed down again. “But your order has already been given, and the clan elders are aware. I cannot simply stop you…” he said, his voice raspy. “You have just taken this position. If I were to block you like this, you would never be able to accomplish anything in the future…”

Having never lacked for resources in his life, Li Zhouluo had subconsciously never considered an Essence Gathering Pill to be anything extraordinary. Even Dharma artifacts that others would kill for were just objects in his eyes. He had agreed without a second thought, but now, with the elder’s gentle prodding, he understood. “I will return at once… and deduct… deduct the pill from my own personal allotment… to demonstrate fairness.”

Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan’s brow finally relaxed. He spoke earnestly, “These few words are spoken behind the closed doors of my own courtyard. Whether it is your fifth brother, or you, or even Han’er… I watch over each and every one of you, and I will not let these matters spread outside. However… managing a family is not as simple as becoming the master of Mount Qingdu. You must remember this lesson for the future!”

At that moment, Li Zhouluo felt a genuine surge of emotion. He had always seen the venerable elder as a figure of authority, someone to be respected, but now he felt a true sense of affection. “Rest assured, venerable elder,” he said in a heavy voice. “Though I may be slow-witted, I will come to you often for guidance in the future to ensure the peace of our home.”

Aside from Li Zhouwei, Li Xuanxuan was counting on him to have some administrative ability, so he did not reprimand him further. “Go… go… everyone is watching you at this time. Don’t linger here too long. Just treat this as a simple visit to pay your respects.”

Li Zhouluo understood. He kowtowed once before exiting. Li Xuanxuan sipped his tea, sighing to himself.

‘That third boy is truly formidable… With this move… Luo’er has to give up his own pill to support him. Now, everyone will think that the Family Head, Li Zhouluo, favors Li Jiangxia…’



# Chapter 782: Inquiries

The Funan territory.

The arrays set upon the mountain peaks were already undergoing repairs. The land, once choked with black smoke, had begun to look orderly once more. The Golden Tang Gate had been forced to come, but they had no desire for wanton slaughter. The mortals below had suffered little damage and were now gathered at the foot of the mountains, rebuilding their flattened villages.

A streak of golden light sped through the air, transforming into a young man with the appearance of a scholar. His face was etched with worry as he flew, coming to a stop at the edge of the Funan territory.

Cui Jueyin had been searching for over half a year. Ever since Ding Weizeng vanished, he had scoured the entire region, but the jade pendant at his waist had shown no reaction. His search had taken him west to the Great Desert and east to the Eastern Sea; he had even secretly traveled north into the territories of the Golden Tang Gate and the Capital immortals Dao, but there was no trace of him.

He had no choice but to fly back, his heart half-frozen with dread.

Cui Jueyin knew Ding Weizeng well and held him in high regard. More importantly, both men had been personally elevated by Li Ximing and were the Daoist Master's trusted aides, standing on the same side. He was a pillar among the Foundation Establishment cultivators, and Cui had no intention of slacking in the search, giving it his absolute all.

He returned to the Funan territory, his spirits low. Not wanting to return to the lake just yet, he landed on Funan’s main peak. The cultivators below did not know him well, but they recognized his face and hurried to greet him.

“Lord Cui, the lake sent Lord Qu to manage the cleanup. He has been sorting out the spiritual fields and is currently free in the main hall.”

Hearing this, Cui Jueyin turned toward the hall. Moments later, he saw the old man sitting within, draped in a rather magnificent robe and holding a box of soil, which he was examining intently.

“Senior Qu!”

Cui Jueyin offered his greeting. Qu Bushi immediately rose and strode forward to meet him, sighing.

“Lord Cui, we’ve been anxiously awaiting you. Things at the lake have been busy… Any sign of Weizeng?”.

Qu Bushi was actually very close to Ding Weizeng, often referring to him as ‘Weizeng’ as one would a junior, and he was deeply agitated by the matter. His first question was for news. When Cui Jueyin shook his head, the old man’s expression turned grim.

“He should be alright…” Qu Bushi murmured. “After all, his life jade at the lake has dimmed, but it hasn’t changed. As long as a Purple Mansion master didn’t strike him down, Weizeng is likely in seclusion somewhere.”

Cui Jueyin mused, “I have one more idea… The Northern Brocade River King… is there any news of him? Demons infest the three rivers; perhaps we can ask him to make some inquiries”.

At the mention of this demon, old man Qu sighed again. “We already thought of him. But that old demon, whether by cunning or by chance… went off nearly two years ago to celebrate the birthday of some Xu Water Demon King and hasn’t been seen since. Our messengers… their messages are just piling up in his river palace with no reply”.

“The Xu Water Demon King?”.

Cui Jueyin, having come from overseas, immediately caught the significance of this name. He frowned. “I know of this Xu Water Demon King. He supposedly visited Chongzhou Island with the Dragon King once. I never heard he was one for extravagance. A banquet lasting a year and a half ought to be over by now. I will go and ask”.

He had a feeling he knew what was happening. Taking the command token from Qu Bushi, he immediately sped toward Baijiang Creek. After covering most of the distance, he submerged himself and descended to the riverbed.

‘A figure as important as the Xu Water Demon King is cooperating with this,’ he thought. ‘Using a birthday celebration to move him out of the way… they must be afraid of dragging the Northern Brocade River King into this mess. When it comes to inland affairs, the dragon lineage ultimately chose not to get involved…’.

Cui Jueyin saw the truth clearly. While the dragon lineage was signaling its withdrawal, this did not mean the rumored connections were imaginary. On the contrary, the connection had to be real for them to mobilize a Purple Mansion demon like the Xu Water Demon King to coordinate this...

‘If the rumors were baseless, the Northern Brocade River King could have just stayed put and ignored any requests for aid. Why else would he go to all this trouble?’

‘Our only hope of finding the Daoist Master and the Family Head... rests with this flood dragon!’

With this understanding, his actions became more assured. As he approached the river palace, a fish demon emerged. Cui Jueyin had some experience dealing with demons and explained his purpose clearly.

“My King only just returned this morning and was about to send a reply,” the demon said. “Please, Lord, come in”.

Cui Jueyin strode confidently into the palace. It was a scene of shimmering gold and brilliant splendor. Demons had no sense of restraint; the steps leading to the high throne were an extravagant mix of gold and precious spiritual materials.

Upon reaching the main hall, he saw a tall, stately man dressed in a magnificent brocade robe of slate-blue cut silk and a cape of white fur embroidered with an azure sea. If not for the shimmering, sapphire-blue scales on his neck, he could have passed for the master of any great sect.

“This humble cultivator, Cui Jueyin, pays his respects to the Northern Brocade River King!”

He bowed his head and stated his name. The man flicked his robes and descended the steps, smiling.

“Chongzhou Island?”.

“Indeed!”

One was a demon, a servant of the dragon lineage; the other was from an overseas family, a descendant of Chongzhou. Neither man lacked for worldly knowledge, and both knew many secrets. They were, in fact, both subordinates of the dragon lineage. As the man and the demon met each other's gaze, a volume of unspoken secrets passed between them.

The Northern Brocade River King, Ying Hebai, gestured for him to take a seat. “Chongzhou is also under the protection of the White Dragon lineage,” he said in a low voice. “Years ago, the Dragon King brought my own King along to accept this charge, forging a bond. My connection to Xu Water is also close. We are all one family”.

“Naturally.”

Cui Jueyin replied with an easy smile, inwardly noting that Ying Hebai seemed to know a great deal.

“I only learned of Brother Chenghui’s fall after I returned to the sea,” Ying Hebai continued, his voice low. “But even if I had been here, I could not have changed anything… I must ask you, Lord Cui, to speak a few good words on my behalf”.

“I am, after all, a minor player on the periphery. I can help pass a message or two, but I cannot do more. I was waiting for you… From now on, any dealings must be counted as a private friendship between us.”

Cui Jueyin naturally nodded. “The lake sees the situation clearly. This was always coming. When Situ Tang achieved the Purple Mansion, he still faced the calamity of having his mountain besieged. When Xiao Chuting attained his divine ability, he was likewise trapped in the Eastern Sea. Moongaze Lake could not expect to be an exception. That the Daoist Master was able to escape overseas is already the best possible outcome.”

Seeing Ying Hebai nod, he lowered his voice. “We have been targeted recently. My only true concern is the matter of the White Qilin entering the sea. Has His Majesty heard any news?”.

Ying Hebai shook his head. “There is no need to worry. Since he used the Sword Gate’s rigid morality to preserve his life, he has slain Situ Mo and fled to the Eastern Sea. It is unlikely any further harm will come to him. The one in an awkward position now is Cheng Yan. I heard from my Demon King that the man has a terrible reputation—reviled by everyone. With Changxiao gone, he would never dare pursue anyone into the Eastern Sea”.

Cui Jueyin immediately understood, and a great weight lifted from his heart. He then changed the subject. “What of the Daoist Master?”

Ying Hebai’s response was immediate. “I was in the Hetian Sea at the time. I know no details of the matter”.

Whether he knew or not, he must have heard something. His eagerness to avoid the topic was a clear signal. Cui Jueyin tactfully shut his mouth, clasping his hands. “Then I must ask the Demon King to help the lake with another matter, to search for a certain Daoist friend…”

A smile finally touched Ying Hebai’s lips. “On that, I have good news for you. Daoist Friend Ding is right here in my river palace, healing from his injuries!”.

Although Cui Jueyin had suspected he might know Ding Weizeng’s whereabouts, he never imagined the man was in the palace itself. No wonder he couldn't find a single trace. He was instantly overjoyed. “My deepest thanks to you, Your Majesty!”

Ying Hebai led him down through layers of coral, soon arriving before a palace of azure bronze. Cui Jueyin waited only a moment before a burly man with the whiskers of a tiger rushed out from within.

Ding Weizeng’s aura hadn't changed significantly, but his eyes were filled with anxiety. The large man rushed up and seized Cui Jueyin’s hands.

“Is there any news of the Daoist Master?!” he demanded.

Cui Jueyin, stunned that this was his first question, uncertainly shook his head.

Ying Hebai smiled. “Daoist Friend Ding fell into the creek. My little sister found him and brought him back, placing him in my palace’s Pristine Water Pool, which healed his wounds. Any slower, and he would have been left with permanent internal injuries that nothing short of a Purple Mansion cultivator could have fixed.”

Cui Jueyin nodded slightly. Ding Weizeng spoke in a low voice, “The Golden Tang Gate besieged me. I used my Immortal Foundation to escape but was severely wounded. I originally fled to the desert, but I was worried about Chenghui. I tried to come back, but I delayed too long, and the injuries were too severe. I fell somewhere in the west.”

“I was unconscious for a long time. I was awakened by several mortals who were fleeing here from the Golden Tang Gate’s territory. Once I was awake, I secluded myself for half a day, then continued flying east. Halfway here, I ran into demonic cultivators. I killed them, but the effort triggered my wounds, and I fell into this river…”.

Ding Weizeng made it sound simple, but to repeatedly lose consciousness was no small matter. A Foundation Establishment cultivator’s injuries would not cause them to lose their senses unless they were truly on the brink of death. If not for the tenacity of his Immortal Foundation, he would have long since perished.

Cui Jueyin let out a deep sigh. “Since you were here healing, why didn’t you send a letter back? You have caused me a bitter search.”

But Ding Weizeng replied in a low voice, “When Miss Ying brought me back, I didn’t know the situation. But I inquired about the present state of affairs and learned the lake was not in danger. I only wanted to use this treasure-land to heal as fast as possible, so I could go to the Eastern Sea and search for the Daoist Master…”

Cui Jueyin understood. The man before him was genuinely worried about Li Ximing. This man felt little belonging to Moongaze Lake itself and had no interest in the clan’s power; his loyalty was to Li Ximing, and to him alone.

“Alas… how can a single Foundation Establishment cultivator find what several Purple Mansion masters cannot? Even if you found him, what help could you be? You should return with me to the lake. We must stabilize the situation at home first.”

Ding Weizeng shook his head. “That is not necessarily true. If the Daoist Master is injured and has no one attending him, there is certainly risk. As for whether I can find him… even if I just search outwardly, I might draw the attention of those with ill intent. That, too, would be good for the Daoist Master!”.

‘Draw the attention of Purple Mansion masters… He’s willing to throw his life away!’

Cui Jueyin, though loyal to his duty, knew he was incapable of sacrificing his own life in such a way. He sighed inwardly. Seeing that Ding Weizeng was about seventy or eighty percent recovered, and hearing his tale of grievous injury—all healed in merely half a year—he instantly understood that Ying Hebai must have used considerable spiritual treasures. The clan now owed a debt. He could only bow.

“On behalf of the lake, I thank His Majesty!”

Ying Hebai laughed and waved his hand, escorting the two men out of the palace. He nodded as they parted. “I heard that Daoist Master Zhu Gong from overseas has recently been a frequent guest at the Purple Smoke Gate. There may be more changes coming. It would be best for the lake to be careful.”

***

Moongaze Lake, Vermillion Bud Pavilion.

The lake water rippled under a perfect sky. The light from the bluestone lanterns had been extinguished. The woman in the pavilion, wearing a long skirt with several talismans affixed to her sleeves, had one hand covering a cloth map marked with dozens of notations, while the other rested on an azure jade mortar.

“Three qian of ochre, three qian of metal essence, five fen of White Origin, one and a half qian of roasted golden silkworm… There should be no issue. It’s strange, why won’t it manifest…”

(T\L Note: Qian is 5 grams, Fen is 0.5 grams)

She observed the half-gold, half-black powder at the bottom of the mortar. When it stubbornly refused to turn platinum, she cut off her spiritual qi and set the jade pestle down.

‘Could it be because of the current spiritual environment, Inward Heart Surging Profundity?’ she mused. ‘Metal is the child of Earth, and this aura damages Earth. There is not enough gestational energy, so the child cannot be born. If I add another half-qian of ochre, I can try again.’

She pulled a jade box from her sleeve, revealing chunks of crimson ochre spirit stone. Just as she was measuring it, a cultivator reported from outside the pavilion.

“My lady, the Third Young Master has arrived.”

“Please, show him in!”

Li Que'wan quickly put her things away and stored the cloth map. As expected, the tall figure of Li Jiangxia strode up the corridor. He clasped his hands with a smile.

“Greetings, Sister!”

“Third Young Master.”

Li Que'wan invited him to sit. The young man raised an eyebrow at the jade mortar on the table. “I don't often come to visit, so it’s rare to see you. My apologies for the interruption.”

Li Que'wan picked up the mortar, her voice gentle. “It is nothing important. A branch of the clan obtained a new cultivation art from the Golden Virtue lineage. The problem is, the spiritual item they need for Qi Refining is not produced in Northern Yue; it comes from the Western High Plateau. They put in a request to the clan. I figured that since it's only a Qi Refining item, it wasn't too precious, so I’m trying to adjust the properties of other materials to create a substitute”.

Li Jiangxia nodded. He hesitated a moment, then slid a box out from under his sleeve. “I came today because I have something I need you to look at,” he said softly.

He placed the stone box on the table and gently opened it. Inside lay a dark, metallic stone. A subtle brilliance flowed across its surface, which was cut as smooth as a mirror, reflecting their faces.

She picked up the metallic stone, tested its weight, and observed it carefully. Surprise filled her face. “Where did you get this? This isn't Dui Metal or Geng Metal… it must be Wandering Metal! This is extremely rare in the south; it’s much more common in the north. I do not know its name, but this is without a doubt a Foundation Establishment-grade Wandering Metal spiritual item”.

“The north…”

Li Jiangxia silently processed this. ‘It seems Brother Pei’s legacy must have been left by a cultivator from the north…’.

He was about to ask more when someone hurried up from below, bowing respectfully.

“My lords! A message from the main island! Please come quickly!”

Li Que'wan immediately stood and handed the stone back. “Do they say what it is about?”

The messenger bowed. “Many people have arrived at the main island on a spirit-vessel, trailing Purple Qi. The vessel is incredibly lavish. It has already docked at the island’s edge.”

Hearing this, Li Que'wan understood at once.

“It must be the sisters,” she said to herself, “returning from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land!”.



# Chapter 783: Good Tidings from Purple Smoke

Swirls of purple qi permeated the air as an ancient, long boat hovered silently. The lake below reflected its violet hue. Standing on the deck was a girl in a pink skirt, gazing into the distance. Her face was round, her ears small and delicate. This was Li Queyi, the second young lady of the Jiangque generation.

Li Queyi stood upon the deck, surrounded by the other young girls who looked to her as their elder sister. They had clearly failed to gain entry to the sect; their spirits were low, and they kept their heads down, afraid to speak.

As Li Queyi felt the spiritual boat move beneath her feet, her own anxiety grew. They were returning from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land, personally escorted by the sect itself—an impressive honor. But the significance of this spirit boat was complex. Where it chose to land—hovering over the lake versus settling upon the isle—was a delicate matter of protocol. With the Li family’s Purple Mansion expert missing, their clan could not afford any further loss of prestige.

As Li Queyi fretted, another girl at her side—this one possessing a slightly colder demeanor—spoke up. She looked to be only eleven or twelve; though her features had yet to fully mature, their refined beauty was already apparent. Head held high, her face beaming with undisguised pride, she whispered to a companion:

"So *that* was the Purple Smoke Blessed Land... What an incredible place! I doubt even the cultivation grounds of celestial fairies or divine maidens could be any better than this!"

Li Queyi shot her a nervous glance before quickly turning her gaze forward again. She didn't relax until the spiritual boat finally settled upon the isle, landing softly on the ground. When she saw the Purple Smoke Gate cultivators disembark on their own, making no demands for a formal reception, she finally breathed a quiet sigh of relief. Lowering her gaze submissively, she followed them off the boat.

"Greetings, fellow Daoists!"

An elderly man dressed in dark blue robes moved forward to receive them. The young cultivator leading the Purple Smoke delegation didn't recognize him. Confused as to why the Li hadn't sent a Foundation Establishment expert to greet them, he nonetheless maintained a welcoming smile and offered enthusiastic congratulations. "Senior! This is wonderful news! Your esteemed clan having two disciples accepted by our gate is truly a joyous occasion."

The elder seemed momentarily startled, but his face quickly broke into a broad smile. The children were ushered forward, dispersing like running water, until only two girls remained before the hall: one older, perhaps seventeen or eighteen, and one barely past her tenth year.

The girl in the pink skirt was, naturally, Li Queyi. Li Xuanxuan wasn't surprised; among the girls of her generation, Li Queyi’s talent was second only to the eldest, Li Quewan. The family had pinned their hopes on her. He nodded, smiling in approval.

The second girl, however, was unexpected. She was the young daughter of a remote lineage within the First Branch, dressed in white robes that matched her aloof temperament. Li Xuanxuan had met all the candidates; he recognized her as Li Quexi. Because she had been brought in from outside the main isle, her generational name had been added later, and it didn't adhere to the standard conventions of the four main branches.

"Excellent! Excellent!" Li Xuanxuan was genuinely delighted.

The cultivator opposite him, however, froze. Someone in the delegation had clearly recognized the elder and was stunned that Li Xuanxuan himself had come. Unsure how to properly address him given the circumstances, they hesitated for several breaths before pushing Ling Yanzi forward.

This man was ancient. Years ago, after being hunted by the Changxiao Gate, he had fled until Li Tongya saved his life. He had visited the Li family then, and now he was here to accept a disciple.

Li Xuanxuan bowed deeply. "Senior... I trust you have been well since we last met."

Ling Yanzi’s hair and beard were snow-white, and he clutched a simple wooden staff. His eyes filled with complex emotions as he nodded silently.

He had met the members of the Xuan generation before. He remembered the youthful Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanling, how they had joked with him. Back then, Ling Yanzi had just escaped death and was recuperating on Mount Lijing. He vividly recalled the steady strength of the middle-aged patriarch and the vibrant, ambitious energy of the youths. Now, looking up, all that remained before him was this frail, withered elder.

"You are... Xuanxuan... the eldest brother..." Ling Yanzi mumbled.

Li Xuanxuan nodded softly. "The old senior still remembers. Of those who were on the mountain that day, I am the only one left."

"I remember," Ling Yanzi’s voice was hoarse with age and memory. "A brush with death... how could I forget?"

The two men looked at each other, seeing both a stranger and a familiar ghost. Their attempts at pleasantries felt hollow, lacking genuine warmth, laced instead with a subtle, shared dread. They were two souls who had barely clung to life against the ravages of time, each terrified the other might speak a memory that cut like a needle.

An awkward silence stretched between them. Seeing this, Li Zhouluo, standing just behind, quickly stepped forward. "Esteemed elders, please continue your conversation," he said respectfully. "This junior can handle the arrangements here."

Li Xuanxuan indeed had matters to discuss with Ling Yanzi, and the two elders made their way toward the main hall. Just then, Li Quewan and Jiangxia arrived, riding the wind. They began arranging accommodations for the Purple Smoke disciples. The Foundation Establishment expert who had led the delegation smiled amiably at Li Zhouluo. "This one is Wen Wu, a cultivator from Mu Zuo Peak. I specifically requested this mission to meet the Clan Head, as there is a particular reason..."

He clasped one hand behind his back, walking casually as he chatted with Li Zhouluo. It was rare to see a male cultivator from the Purple Smoke Gate. "The situation is rather interesting," he smiled. "Your disciples originally came to Ziqi Peak seeking apprenticeship. Your Li Queyi, despite being slightly older, is already condensing Qi—specifically, Jade True Qi. Since our sect has several compatible cultivation methods, it wasn't considered a conflict, and she earned Senior Ling Yanzi’s approval."

"But then, unexpectedly, after Li Queyi had been accepted, my own master—Peak Lord Qian Lizi of Mu Zuo Peak—happened to visit. She saw Li Quexi and immediately took a liking to her. She petitioned the Gate Master directly and accepted her as a disciple."

Wen Wu looked vibrant, and his eyes, which seemed enhanced by some ocular art, flowed with light. A clear joy was visible in his gaze as he spoke softly. "This is truly a wonderful stroke of fate. As the Eldest Disciple of my peak, I felt it necessary to come to the isle personally. First, to inform the Clan Head and observe the proper etiquette. Second, I needed to meet her family members and explain the situation clearly."

Li Zhouluo instantly understood and nodded inwardly. "This is wonderful news," he smiled. "Since Senior is being so considerate, I will personally guide you to meet them on the isle."

Mu Zuo Peak was clearly in a different league than Ling Yanzi’s Ziqi Peak, which had nearly seen its lineage severed multiple times. Peak Lord Qian Lizi was a renowned Foundation Establishment expert, known by the title "Treasured Vase." The fact that this Eldest Disciple, Wen Wu, was himself at the late stage of Foundation Establishment spoke volumes about the peak's strength.

Furthermore, despite the chaotic reception, Li Zhouluo had clearly observed that Ling Yanzi—a Peak Lord and a sect elder—had walked half a step *behind* Wen Wu. The other Purple Smoke cultivators all deferred to Wen Wu as their leader. Clearly, this Eldest Disciple's status was exceptionally high.

'I wonder if a Daoist Master intentionally arranged this... Regardless, having one more disciple accepted is undoubtedly a good thing.'

This was the first good news Li Zhouluo had received in days, and he felt a weight lift from his shoulders. Beside him, his elder sister, Li Quewan, held Li Queyi with one hand and Li Quexi with the other. Her thoughts, however, took a darker turn.

'From what I know of Ling Yanzi’s disciples... every one of them has either shallow cultivation or has hit a bottleneck they can't surpass. I suspect the only reason that old man chose Queyi is because her talent is high *and* she's already at the Qi Refining realm. If he'd taken an Embryonic Breathing novice, he'd likely die of old age before she ever reached Foundation Establishment.'

'Looking at how powerful Mu Zuo Peak is now, and how pathetic Ziqi Peak has become... Ling Yanzi doesn't have many years left to protect anyone. In the future, the lives and treatment these two sisters receive... I fear they will be separated by a gulf as wide as heaven and earth.'



### Chapter 784: Settling Matters with Purple Smoke

Li Zhouluo walked ahead, introducing Wen Wu to several of the isle’s cultivation spots. Wen Wu was exceedingly gracious, nodding repeatedly.

"I have heard of this place!" he said. "Rumor has it that this was once a market city. My master cultivated here in her youth and often told me what a fine place it was. She said its key locations were no worse than those in our Blessed Land."

Li Quewan listened intently, but she noticed that Li Quexi, at her side, was walking with hurried steps. The girl was nearly a full body length ahead of her, trying to stay close to Wen Wu.

"Eldest Senior Brother," she asked with great curiosity, "how does this place compare to Mu Zuo Peak?"

Wen Wu chuckled and gave a vague reply.

"Mu Zuo is the second peak of the Blessed Land. Its spiritual energy is so abundant it ranks among the best in all of Jiangnan. However, according to my master, back when she cultivated in the market here, the most expensive location was every bit as good as Mu Zuo Peak."

Pingya Isle was an excellent place, its spiritual energy far more balanced and potent than the surrounding lakeshore. But Li Zhouluo knew it was no match for the Purple Smoke Blessed Land, let alone one of its immortal peaks.

Wen Wu's words were diplomatic. The isle may have been comparable in the past, but after the great war to eradicate the Chen Clan remnants and years of suffering under a great sealing formation, it had long since lost its former glory.

"There is no comparison, of course," Li Zhouluo said with a smile. "The Blessed Land belongs to the Green Pine Supreme Yang Dao Lineage, a heritage a thousand years strong. My family falls far short!"

Since Li Zhouluo had stated it so plainly, Wen Wu could only swallow the awkwardness and reply, "Your noble clan rose from humble beginnings. The bearing and ambition of your ancestors are things we at Purple Smoke have long admired."

The younger girl had now moved a full step forward. As she was not the primary host, Li Quewan couldn't very well walk ahead of their guest. The angle became awkward, and she had to release Li Quexi's hand, holding only her sister Li Queyi's.

Soon, they arrived at Li Quexi’s family home. Li Zhouluo and Wen Wu led the girl into the small courtyard, where they were met with a chorus of joyful laughter and effusive compliments. Li Quewan, holding Li Queyi, stopped outside, deciding not to enter. She straightened her younger sister’s collar and spoke softly.

"Your sister Quexi is still young and doesn't understand many things. A girl not yet of an age to wear hairpins... this is a time of vanity. You can't expect her to handle things perfectly. In the Blessed Land, she will have few to guide her. If you get a chance to see her, you should offer her some reminders."

"Elder Sister..."

Though Li Queyi had a sweet appearance, she was older and understood the subtleties of the situation. "I saw the Blessed Land on our way," she said tactfully. "Ziqi Peak is not faring well... For them to form a connection with our family, the immortal gate likely felt they couldn't neglect the favor owed to the Daoist Master. Quexi's acceptance was genuine; mine was merely an excuse to round out the deal. Once we enter the gate, our statuses will be very different. I'm afraid I will be the one needing her to remember the bonds of sisterhood and help me. Even though I am a few years older, it would not be my place to lecture her."

Although the Purple Smoke Gate honored ancient customs and did without the formal division of inner and outer disciples, the distinction between the strong and the weak was everywhere, giving rise to countless differences in status. Li Quewan understood this perfectly and sighed to herself.

'Sister Quexi is still a child, after all. She believes her talent is exceptional, that she is different from ordinary people, and that she earned the favor of a great cultivator through her own merit. She has no idea it was all because of the Daoist Master's connections... If Queyi had been born three or five years later, this opportunity would never have been hers.'

Li Quewan waited for a moment before raising her head. She had cultivated an ocular art, and her vision was superb. She spotted Li Xuanxuan and Ling Yanzi strolling not far away, clearly having followed them.

She quickly pulled her sister along to greet them. "Greetings, esteemed Senior! Greetings, esteemed Elder!"

Ling Yanzi nodded repeatedly. Li Queyi also greeted him as "Master." Seeing the heavy atmosphere between the two old men, Li Quewan, ever the elder sister, quickly tried to smooth things over.

"For my sister to receive the esteemed Senior's guidance is truly her great fortune. If she faces any difficulties within the sect, or if our family fails to provide sufficient cultivation resources, she is young and shy and may not speak up. I ask that Senior please write to us."

Normally, once a disciple entered a sect, the family's provision of resources was carefully considered; there was no logic in giving too little or too much. But Ziqi Peak was so poor that Ling Yanzi had to fight for his own Foundation Establishment resources. By having her family supply Li Queyi's needs, she could share with her fellow disciples, which would naturally earn her their goodwill.

The suggestion to "write to us" was also a way to offer Ling Yanzi a graceful exit, so he wouldn't lose face by asking a disciple for resources. He could simply request them from the Li family directly. Ling Yanzi understood perfectly and nodded slightly.

"Her senior brothers and sisters are all good people. Queyi will not be wronged on my peak."

Li Xuanxuan walked beside them with his hands behind his back, his earlier joy having completely vanished. Li Zhouluo soon returned to escort Ling Yanzi and Li Queyi to meet her family elders.

When all the arrangements were finally settled, Wen Wu and his contingent prepared to return to their sect. After tearful goodbyes between the two families, Wen Wu walked briskly to Li Xuanxuan's side.

"Venerable Senior, please join me in the hall for a private discussion," he said with a smile.

Li Xuanxuan understood at once. He dismissed his attendants and entered the hall with Wen Wu.

"Venerable Senior," the man began politely, "Daoist Master Zhaojing left a Purple Mansion formation with my master. He was to provide medicinal pills, and in return, she was to come to the lake to set up the formation. But now that the Daoist Master is away, this matter has been delayed..."

"A Purple Mansion formation?!"

The words caught in Li Xuanxuan’s throat, and his heart pounded. His grandson had not communicated much with the family since becoming a Daoist Master; he had no idea he had secretly arranged for such a powerful defensive array. The old man's voice trembled with surprised delight.

"The Daoist Master's meaning is...?!"

Wen Wu lowered his voice. "My master inquired about the situation. Seeing that Daoist Master Zhaojing has not returned and knowing this is a critical time, she thought to find an opportunity to come to the lake first and set up the formation for you."

Li Xuanxuan was now truly overcome with a mixture of shock and joy. "My family's Daoist Master... has been gone for so long, he cannot fulfill his promise," he hesitated. "For Daoist Master Tinglan to show such profound generosity, Moongaze Lake... is both deeply grateful and terribly anxious. I do not know how we can accept!"

Whatever deal Li Ximing had struck with Tinglan, the alchemy was surely part of it. For her to offer to set up the formation first was completely unexpected. Li Xuanxuan voiced his disbelief, and Wen Wu replied:

"This matter... has long been on my master's mind. That day, I was with her when she met your Daoist Master. She sighed repeatedly, saying that Changxiao's actions were unexpected and that it was her own miscalculation that she could not help him. Setting up this formation first is her way of making amends."

"My Purple Smoke Blessed Land follows the righteous path; we are not like those who have migrated from overseas. Venerable Senior, please do not worry."

Seeing the old man nod, Wen Wu continued, "There is just one thing I must make clear. My master is currently occupied with an urgent matter. It will take about a year. After that time, the Capital immortals Dao will have retreated."

With this information, Li Xuanxuan finally felt a sense of security.

"Now that the two young ladies have entered the Blessed Land," Wen Wu went on, "the gate's rules are clear. Since they are women, their entry does not prevent them from continuing your immortal clan's lineage. However, the matter of their marriages will be decided by them and our Blessed Land. They are now people of the Purple Smoke Gate, and we will not permit them to be engaged in arranged alliances."

"That is only natural," Li Xuanxuan's voice was low and hoarse. "Ever since the example set by my own sister, our lake has largely abandoned that practice. Unless it is by mutual consent, I have put a stop to any such notions. Later, when Qinghong and Minggong succeeded in their cultivation, we had their examples to follow, and the clan no longer placed limits based on gender. It is only because the Veiled Yin is not prominent that we naturally have fewer female cultivators, making it seem as if the men are more numerous."

Li Xuanxuan knew that Purple Smoke was a sect led by female cultivators and chose his words with extra care. Wen Wu nodded gently, clearly already aware of this.

"Although the Blessed Land follows ancient customs, most things must still be earned through one's own efforts. The young ladies will inevitably face some hardships. I ask for your understanding."

His words were not directed at anyone else but Li Queyi. The two of them walked out together. The spirit boat was waiting for Wen Wu alone. The deck was silent, with no sign of impatience. Li Queyi stood to one side with Ling Yanzi; since he was familiar with the Li family, her position was even better than on the journey there. Li Quexi, meanwhile, stood at the prow. Her eyes were red, but she was the center of attention, a figure of glory.

As the purple mist drifted away, most of the cultivators left behind looked on with envy. Only Li Zhouluo glanced once before turning back. He followed Li Xuanxuan into the hall, and once they were alone, he frowned.

"Elder, it seems to me that the girl Quexi is a bit too frivolous. Now that she has obtained a Dao lineage, I do not know if it is for better or for worse."

Li Xuanxuan, in his old age, had seen it all quite clearly. But the news of the Purple Mansion formation had put him in a good mood. "It is human nature," he said in his weary voice. "Do not be too harsh. It's not just Quexi. Which of our juniors, having received such favor, wouldn't hold their head a little higher standing on that prow? It's just that she appears a little too eager."

Li Quewan added in a gentle tone, "I think we must treat her well from now on. Regardless of whether she cares for the family, the family must be good to her. Even if she becomes a high-level cultivator of the Purple Smoke Gate, her name will still begin with Li."

The other two nodded in agreement. The old man asked about family affairs.

"All is peaceful," Li Zhouluo reported. "We received news from the Xiao family. The Yushan branch wished to return for a visit, but that area has been unstable recently, and they have been unable to make the trip."

"Qingxiao... tell her to take care of herself."

Seeing they were alone, Li Xuanxuan recounted what Wen Wu had told him. The other two were equally overjoyed. Li Zhouluo paced around the hall twice before whispering, "Another year or two... I wonder if it's because Changxiao has yet to reveal himself... I only hope we can pass this time safely."

Li Quewan offered her thoughts. "Since the Capital immortals Dao is retreating, the wilderness they vacate should be returned to the Profound Peak Gate. Our family has done all we can in this matter and should not interfere further. In this junior's opinion, we should place them back in their original territory and let them re-establish their sect. Let this matter be concluded. We should not waste any more effort on it."

"Agreed," Li Zhouluo replied. The Profound Peak Gate was endlessly grateful, and the Li family had profited greatly from their decline. But with their own Daoist Master missing, they had grown fearful of further entanglement, regardless of whether Li Ximing's disappearance was intentional or part of some deeper plan.

As the three were talking, a shout came from outside. Li Zhouluo dispelled the privacy formation and frowned. "What is happening?"

The newcomer was Dili Guang. He dropped to the ground in a deep bow, his voice filled with joy.

"My Lord, Elder Lord... Lord Cui has returned to the isle with Protector Ding!"

"Excellent!"

With the return of these two powerful, Foundation Establishment-level combatants, Li Xuanxuan felt a great weight lift from his heart. Li Zhouluo strode forward, beaming.

"Have them come in at once!"

A moment later, the magnificently robed Cui Jueyin entered. Following behind him was a burly man with the jaw of a swallow and the whiskers of a tiger. He was powerfully built, his eyes sharp and imbued with a mysterious power that sent a chill down the spine of anyone who met his gaze.

It was Ding Weizeng.

"Excellent, excellent!"

Li Xuanxuan, hearing one piece of good news after another, descended from the dais. Cui Jueyin immediately bowed his head in a deep salute, while Ding Weizeng moved forward to gently support him.

"With the two of you back," Li Xuanxuan said, "the lake has nothing to fear!"

Ding Weizeng looked slightly awkward, but Cui Jueyin recounted the full story of their experiences. Hearing it, Li Xuanxuan’s old eyes grew red. "As long as you returned safely..."

But Ding Weizeng dropped to his knees with a thud. "Reporting to my lord! This subordinate has returned only to make adjustments. Once I have prepared enough pills and resources, I will immediately depart for the Eastern Sea to find the Daoist Master!"

"What?"

Li Xuanxuan was stunned, momentarily thinking the man meant to abandon them for another clan. Cui Jueyin had to explain his intentions. The old man sighed repeatedly, but Ding Weizeng remained kneeling stubbornly.

"Protector Ding," Li Quewan tried to persuade him, "if you go to the Eastern Sea and someone traces you back to the Daoist Master, won't your good intentions backfire?"

Ding Weizeng shook his head gently. "Weizeng is not of the lake's bloodline, so I cannot be easily traced. The Daoist Master would not meet with me. But if I venture determinedly deep into the sea, I can draw the attention of other Purple Mansion cultivators, easing the pressure on him."

Li Quewan was about to say more, but the old man stopped her. Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard. Though he worried for his grandson, he understood that Ding Weizeng’s journey to the Eastern Sea would, in all likelihood, stir up immense turmoil. It could not only cost the man his life but also cause untold trouble.

'If Ximing can escape, what need has he of him? If he cannot, what use is he?'

'Judging by the soul lamp, Ximing is not yet at death's door. The Eastern Sea is vast. Where would one even begin to look for him?'

He spoke with a calm voice. "Did the Daoist Master leave any orders for you?"

"He did not..." Ding Weizeng hesitated slightly.

"Since you received no orders," Li Xuanxuan continued, "how can you know he is truly injured? Could it not be that he is feigning injury, hiding in the sea to lure out his enemies? If you rush to the Eastern Sea and ruin the Daoist Master's plan, what crime would that be?"

At these words, understanding dawned on Cui Jueyin's face. Ding Weizeng was shocked speechless. Even Li Zhouluo and Li Quewan stood frozen in place, the hall falling into a sudden, deep silence.

A cold sweat broke out on Ding Weizeng's back. He bowed low, his voice trembling with lingering fear. "Thank you for your guidance, my lord! If not for the Elder Lord's prudence, Weizeng would have made a grave mistake! From now on, this subordinate will focus solely on protecting the lake and await the Daoist Master's return!"

***

On the Purple Qi Spirit Boat.

The Purple Smoke Gate's spirit boat was quite spacious, its interior much larger than it appeared from the outside. While it couldn't compare to the Azure Pond Sect's world-famous Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner, it was still a luxurious Dharma Artifact of the highest order.

It departed from the lake and soon reached the untamed wilderness. After seeing to the other passengers, Wen Wu returned to the prow, where his new junior sister, Li Quexi, was leaning against the railing, watching the scenery.

Wen Wu clasped his hands behind his back and strolled over. The girl immediately looked up, her smile as innocent as a child's, reminding him of his own daughter. "Eldest Senior Brother!" she chirped.

Wen Wu nodded slightly. "Junior Sister, why aren't you with your sister?"

Li Quexi lowered her voice. "I am not very familiar with my sister. I was only brought to the main isle when I was nine and my talent was deemed sufficient. That was the first time I met her. We only exchanged simple greetings. So many people flocked around her back then; I never joined the crowd. We've barely spoken a few sentences."



# Chapter 785: Purple Mansion

When Wen Wu heard this, he leaned one hand on the boat's railing, thinking for a moment before replying.

"Junior Sister, once you are inside the sect, this elder sister of yours is your closest kin. You must remain close with her; having someone looking out for you in the sect, having an extra sister, gives you an extra path in all things."

"You and Queyi won't be returning to Moongaze Lake often, but you must maintain your family relationships. You cannot discard them."

Li Quexi nodded distractedly. Her senior brother smiled and retrieved a pair of talismans from his sleeve. One depicted a tiger, the other a dragon; one shimmered golden, the other shone brilliant white.

He lowered his voice. "These are treasures bestowed upon me when I first paid respects to the Daoist Master. The gold talisman is a treasure of Geng Metal; it can change its form at will and overwhelm other cultivators. The white talisman is a remnant of the Jade True lineage; it can protect the user. While not as mighty as the gold one, it possesses its own divinity."

Seeing that he had her attention, Wen Wu smiled. "You have these artifacts as well."

Li Quexi blinked, confused, as Wen Wu continued:

"The Purple Smoke Sect and Mu Zuo Peak are your gold talisman. They are undeniably powerful. But the Moongaze Immortal Clan is your white talisman, and it, too, has its divine uses. Have you seen me throw away my white talisman just because I acquired the gold one? Even if the white talisman’s power doesn't compare to the gold, if you threw it out, tens of thousands of cultivators would fight to the death for it."

"This is obvious when looking at Dharma Artifacts," he said, "but people often lose clarity when it applies to themselves."

The girl fell silent, gripping the hem of her robes as she nodded.

Wen Wu pressed on. "Your surname, 'Li,' and your generation name, 'Que'—those two words alone are the envy of countless others. Even if you feel no emotional attachment, you must perform the etiquette and maintain the relationship perfectly. When you eventually hit a bottleneck in your cultivation, those two words might win you an opportunity. If you fall into mortal danger, those two words might fight for your survival. You never know!"

"Even if you feel you have 'used up' those two words, if Moongaze Lake is ever in crisis and comes to beg you for help, the power will still be in your hands. With the gold talisman backing you, whether those two words become a burden or not... won't that be entirely up to you?"

Li Quexi was only half-understanding, lost in his logic. She mumbled, "Junior Sister doesn't understand these things. I will have to learn from Senior Brother in the future."

Wen Wu placed both hands on the railing. The glow of the Purple Smoke blessed land was slowly appearing on the horizon. The man weighed the two talismans, tucked them back into his robes, and let out a breath, shaking his head.

"Don't learn from me. I've been stationed overseas for so many years, I learned long ago how to be crooked. The Master has reprimanded me several times. You won't learn anything good from me... don't learn from me."

"Besides..." A smile spread across his face, and he let out a laugh. "You're a member of the Li family. An Immortal Clan that clawed its way out of that pit of vipers at Azure Pond. Why would you need to learn from me? It's more likely I should be learning from you."

Li Quexi didn't know how to respond and could only pretend not to hear. After some time, the spirit boat stopped amid the vast purple qi. A group of cultivators came aboard to make arrangements. Wen Wu, without a second glance, disembarked with his hands clasped behind his back.

He rode the wind straight toward the towering jade platform at the very center of the Purple Smoke blessed land. He passed several pavilions, ascending the heights on foot. A female cultivator in white Daoist robes, holding a jade vase, was waiting to the side. On the main seat sat a Daoist Master dressed in robes the color of autumn-yellow satin, currently studying a jade slip.

Wen Wu bowed his head, not daring to meet her gaze, and said respectfully, "Greetings, Daoist Master. Greetings, Master. Wen Wu has returned from the lake. The requested message has been delivered."

Tinglan glanced at him. "How did the Li family respond?"

Wen Wu replied respectfully, "Li Xuanxuan is managing affairs at the lake. The old man agreed to everything, one by one. He seemed genuinely unaware of the matter and appeared pleasantly surprised. After receiving the reply, he saw me off."

"As for the Bright Yang signature," Wen Wu continued, "it was not obvious. The lake has many female cultivators. Although power is concentrated, it is not the tyrannical despotism of the ancient Wei. Not everyone cultivates Bright Yang. On the contrary, their paths are quite complex; most cultivate Jade True, Pit Water, True Fire, and Cold Qi. Even their direct lineage divides their cultivation among various Daos."

Hearing this, the white-robed woman beside them breathed a sigh of relief. Tinglan leaned back against the purple jade throne and smiled.

"Good. I have met Zhaojing, and he doesn't strike me as a Bright Yang cultivator, nor does he have the arrogance of the Wei or that other Li branch. If anything, he resembles the Cui family more. Perhaps his divine ability is analogous to the remnants of the Heavenly Radiance lineage, and he does not walk the path of worldly contention. Li Zhouwei is the same... Although he strongly resembles a White Qilin, he lacks that vicious aura and extreme temper."

The Daoist Master murmured, "Neither is vicious enough. Perhaps this branch intermarried with the Cui Clan and needs not be bothered."

Wen Wu, having bowed, remained silent. Only then did the Peak Lord of Mu Zuo Peak, Qian Lizi, respond:

"This disciple simply cannot see clearly. Capital immortals Dao has this attitude... acting all harmonious now. Our sect is a Supreme Yang Dao lineage, of the Supreme Yin Immortal attribute, and holds the Purple Qi inheritance. They cannot afford to offend us, so they are naturally respectful. But now they are also weak toward the Li family... This smells of bowing to the powerful after initial arrogance."

Wen Wu kept his head down, but his ears pricked up. Daoist Master Tinglan merely smiled faintly.

"Zhaojing hates Changxiao to the bone. Do you imagine Yehui does not? Even if Yehui could tolerate Zhaojing hating him by association after escaping, he absolutely cannot tolerate removing an enemy *for* Changxiao. He will not let Changxiao seize a great opportunity while he himself is left holding the blame..."

Tinglan paused meaningfully before changing the subject. "Are all of Daoist Master Zhu Gong’s subordinates settled?"

Qian Lizi quickly nodded respectfully. "Daoist Master Zhu Gong has already given instructions, and all the cultivators have been arranged nearby. She went to Profound Peak Gate this morning. Daoist Master Yehui must have shown her around, and most matters have been discussed. She just returned... however..."

Tinglan raised an eyebrow. Qian Lizi continued with a look of half-embarrassment and half-disgust:

"Daoist Master Zhu Gong’s subordinates are, after all, Eastern Sea cultivators. Those at Foundation Establishment, along with the crowd of Qi Refining disciples below them, have awful tempers. Under the guise of 'scouting the terrain,' they went out pillaging. Raiding the wilderness and Shanji Prefecture is permissible, but a few of them went all the way to the eastern shore of Moongaze Lake... It has made the Moongaze Immortal Clan extremely nervous."

Daoist Master Tinglan seemed to have expected this and dismissed them both.

Moments later, a young girl appearing sixteen or seventeen, dressed in red, materialized on the jade platform, her hands clasped behind her back. Tinglan, who looked seven or eight years her senior, gave a slight bow.

"Sister, you have arrived."

Daoist Master Zhu Gong stepped forward. "Sister, judging by Yehui's attitude, Kong Haiying is dead. This was Zhaojing’s plot, disguised as Fu En making a delivery. You said Zhaojing was sincere and magnanimous, a stable personality. I disagree. If another Li Zhouwei shows up, won't they think they own the heavens?"

"He is truly dead..." Tinglan pondered this, then shook her head. "This matter requires deliberation. In any case, since Li Ximing is recovering in the Eastern Sea and Changxiao is missing, you must give the Li Clan some face. I will handle the Profound Peak matter. Sister, you need only maintain propriety."

"Fine..." Daoist Master Zhu Gong nodded with a smile.

"The Kong Clan has a Kong Qiuyan," Zhu Gong continued. "I happen to have a clan nephew. And that younger one, Kong Xiaxiang... I also have clan members for him to choose from. By showing such grace in their time of crisis and treating the Kong Clan with such ceremony... sending charcoal in a snowstorm is invaluable."

"This is an open and honorable move. The Kong descendants will be indebted to us for generations. Below, it will unify the hearts of Shanji; above, it will help cure these demonic Dao habits of theirs."

The wind atop the jade platform grew stronger. Tinglan poured her tea. With a single sentence, Zhu Gong had arranged the marriages for the entire Kong Clan, and in her unspoken words, the very lives and deaths of several other Kong members seemed faintly visible.

Tinglan offered a reminder, "Mount Jingyi still has Kong Gumo. I hear Xuanyi favors him. You and Xuanyi have always been close; do not go too far."

Zhu Gong hesitated, putting down her tea. "That... is indeed a problem."

***

Sea's Cape.

Flames surged within the earth's veins. Water and fire clashed violently, sending white steam everywhere. Li Ximing sat cross-legged in the center, flames exiting his nostrils with every breath, spreading outward.

The longer The Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art remained in his body, the more ferocious the surrounding black flames became, roasting his physical form until it crackled like stressed glass, covered in minute fissures. Li Ximing still refused to guide the fire into his Juque Palace, which would waste all his previous efforts. He could only intermittently take out the Serpent Origin Spirit Water.

But to his alarm, as the art's flames burned, they gradually developed a resistance to the Serpent Origin Spirit Water. Its effects were diminishing.

'If I weren't an alchemist...' Li Ximing mused, '...with a precise grasp of my own injuries and a deep understanding of fire, this technique would be truly impossible to resolve. The Mirrored-Mirage lineage... I must be careful of them in the future.'

He snapped his eyes open. His spiritual sense shot through the earth's surface, faintly hearing a clamor. A particularly effeminate voice stood out:

"You, surname Xia! Is the place right here?"

"Reporting to milord, yes, this is it..."

Excitement finally flared in Li Ximing’s heart. 'Good, good, good! This Xia woman is truly useful. She is, after all, just a local cultivator from the ends of the earth, completely without background. How could she possibly recognize complex traps... The Foundation Establishment cultivator brought his entire crew!'

The thrill passed, and he immediately began chanting internally, activating the scouting ability of the Immortal Mirror. He scanned the surrounding Great Void, ensuring not a single Purple Mansion cultivator was lingering nearby before looking up.

He saw a massive swarm of demons—shrimp, snakes, turtles, and crabs, some humanoid, some not—crowding around an effeminate man holding a folding fan and riding a giant turtle. They were slowly approaching from the sky.

The woman, Xia Shouyu, looked wretched. She was suspended in mid-air, both her calves bitten clean off, revealing the stark white ends of her bones. Disheveled and covered in blood, she still had to force a fawning smile onto her face.

Suppressing the urge to fly out, Li Ximing observed the situation. When the effeminate man glanced at the hot spring, the surprise of a Foundation Establishment demon flashed in his eyes.

"You! And you! Get down there and look immediately."

Two lesser demons eagerly dove into the water. Xia Shouyu cried out pitifully, "My lord! If you can break the seal below, I beg you, please spare my life..."

Li Ximing understood the situation. The demon clearly didn't trust the woman's words. She had probably changed her story several times and was only believed after being tortured to this extent. Hearing her still shouting, he cursed inwardly.

'You reckless fool. I am a Daoist Master... not a True Monarch. Missing limbs are a trivial fix for me, a wave of the hand. But if you die of your injuries right here, all I can do is set up a tombstone for you...'

While Xia Shouyu shrieked above, the two small demons rapidly approached his position. Though Li Ximing had not coordinated with her, his mind moved. He allowed the white skeleton and the storage bag on the ground to become visible again.

Since Li Ximing was fishing, he naturally couldn't let these minions steal the bait. He released a pulse of fire. The two small demons couldn't stand the heat and scrambled back out, yelling, "Great King! It is true, just as the human said!"

The demon leader was instantly ecstatic and scrambled off the giant turtle. He lived at the edge of the world, poorer than dirt, and could count the number of techniques he knew on one hand, let alone possessing any real Dharma Artifacts. Hearing there was likely something good in the flames, he rushed in, not forgetting to "shoo" Xia Shouyu down from the air.

Xia Shouyu's face was ashen. The demon was impatient. "Lead the way, quickly! If you force me to search your soul, you had better worry about your little life!"

'Like hell you can,' Xia Shouyu thought. 'If you were capable of soul-searching, you wouldn't need me.'

She had been terrified of this local demon, who had intentionally leaked some information before. The demon had tried soul-searching on others and killed them, losing the clue. Otherwise, why would she, Xia Shouyu, have needed to risk her own skin?

Now, inside the fire, the effeminate man saw the skeleton and rejoiced, but suspicion remained. He yelled, "You! Go and retrieve it!"

Xia Shouyu cursed him internally. She had no lower legs, the flames here were ferocious, and she couldn't even ride the wind properly. She flew halfway before tumbling to the ground. She lifted her head, staring blankly at the skeleton.

'Old thing, aren't you going to make your move? Don't tell me this old bastard can't even beat this guy!'

Li Ximing clearly read the exasperation in her eyes. The demon was already a turtle in a jar. He was merely observing the demons outside to make sure they hadn't wandered off to eat the local savages. Slightly embarrassed, he stood up, adjusted his posture, and spoke in an eerie, evil-filled laugh:

"Jie jie... Little friend, however did you get yourself into such a state?"

Watching the skeleton rise to its feet, the effeminate man looked as if he had seen a ghost. He frantically tried to activate his Immortal Foundation and pull a talisman from his sleeve, but his vision went white. Fire flashed, heavenly light bore down, and he let out a scream.

"Aiya!"

In an instant, the man dissolved, reverting to his true form: a shimmering blue, segmented sea earthworm. It flopped onto the flames, writhing in agony. He knew instantly he had encountered a truly terrifying existence. His main body, lacking a mouth, pulsed from its abdomen as if an infant were drumming inside, producing insane, muffled cries for mercy:

"This lowly... this base demon did not recognize the Daoist Master's presence... I offended the Daoist Master... Please... please..."

One couldn't blame the demon for being stupid. The circumstances were just too absurd. Even in the near seas, no sect disciple would ever imagine that a mighty Purple Mansion cultivator would be hiding in a cave, waiting for someone to walk into their trap.

Li Ximing didn't even glance at the demon. He lifted the woman and, just as before, blew a breath of air at her.

*Shua!*

Two pale, tender calves sprouted like green onions. Xia Shouyu stood steady but still hadn't processed what happened. She stammered blankly, "You... you..."

She knew this demon was no match for the skeleton, but this was a Foundation Establishment demon! It was one thing for her, a Qi Refining cultivator, to be as fragile as tofu before him, but this Foundation Establishment expert was weaker than a baby chick—at least grabbing a chick required you to reach out your hand.

'A divine ability... so this is a divine ability...'

The sea worm flopped on the ground like a piece of meat. The exhilarating rush of vengeance vanished from Xia Shouyu, replaced by sheer terror of a being who could incinerate her with a single breath. The woman collapsed to her knees, trembling violently.

"Con... congratulations, Daoist Master!"



# Chapter 786: Profound Adamant Essence Gathering

Xia Shouyu collapsed to the ground, kneeling, as the demon general writhed on the cave floor, screaming hoarsely.

"Daoist Master... Daoist Master, spare me..."

Li Ximing found him noisy. With a mere thought, the sound was muffled, sealed away from his senses. He smiled at the woman.

"Little Friend Xia, you chose well. This fellow is undoubtedly of the Valley Water attribute. Does he have any significant background? Any powerful friends or relatives? I would rather not make too large a disturbance and attract outside attention."

Xia Shouyu understood the implied meaning immediately. This old monster wanted to lie low and heal. Old monsters like this often had enemies, most likely powerful champions of the orthodox path. If she caused trouble that drew them here, she would be crushed like a bedbug.

She nodded repeatedly. "Daoist Master! This creature is just a demon general of Sea's Cape known as King Qiu. This area is simply too remote; even the Dragon-kin of the Admirable Sea never venture here. His only connections are with the few other Foundation Establishment demons that have passed through over the years and some local small-fry. Even if this whole group died, it’s unlikely anyone would notice..."

Li Ximing didn't fully trust the words of a mere Qi Refining cultivator.

'This lesser demon has some brains,' he thought. 'Although he didn't march here with drums and banners, he still brought his trusted subordinates. If they all die here together, it will certainly draw unwanted gazes. It is better to keep the ripples small.'

Seeing his silence, Xia Shouyu feared he was hatching some scheme and would use her as his vanguard. Hoping he would choose discretion, she quickly added in a low voice:

"This demon is manageable. But I have heard that if you travel due west from here, across the sea, you reach the Peacock Sea. Within that sea is Nine Mounds Mountain. A great power with divine abilities resides on that mountain, one whose might is infinite, capable of making the dead speak and the living ascend. An emissary from that mountain came to Sea's Cape over sixty years ago to accept disciples... so they are clearly still paying attention."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing deduced this must be a Purple Mansion cultivator, the closest one to this edge of Sea's Cape. "What is his name?" he murmured. "What does he cultivate? What else is he known for?"

Xia Shouyu quickly kowtowed. "This lowly one does not know! I only hear that a great power often travels to and from that immortal mountain. That great power possesses a gourd. More than a decade ago, a golden talisman lit up the sky above Sea's Cape, and shimmering light rained down like gauze. A gourd the size of a mountain appeared. It must have been him sparring with another great power."

Li Ximing had never heard of any expert with a gourd, but he noted the location warily. He waved his hand for Xia Shouyu to stop, then looked down at the sea earthworm.

"You monster. You just had to run straight into my hands. Who do you truly serve?"

The demon general wailed, "My lord! I am from the Zhu South Water Mansion! Daoist Master! I offended you unintentionally, please, on behalf of the Water Mansion... spare this lowly demon's life!"

As the demon shouted, he untied the storage bag from his waist and dumped everything out. A flashy, pathetic pile of junk spilled out, pathetically poor and sparse, mostly items corrupted with blood-qi. The worthlessness of the hoard was breathtaking; he was poorer than a standard Qi Refining disciple from a major Jiangnan sect.

Trembling, he plucked a single jade bottle from the mess and offered it up miserably. "This is something this lowly one acquired by chance. I offer it to the Daoist Master!"

"Haha!"

Li Ximing glanced at it. It was an ancient-method pill; there was no telling if it was even still effective. He found the situation laughable. He had intended to listen to the demon's pleading and see if he could be utilized, but he couldn't be bothered with such a clumsy lie. He lifted the lump of flesh, slightly relaxed the pressure of his divine ability to allow the demon to regain its humanoid form, and snapped:

"Utter nonsense! The Zhu South Water Mansion is far south of the Vermillion Sea. This is the Eastern Sea's Cape! It would take you a year and a half just to fly here from there, and you dare feed me this garbage!"

Li Ximing's own Zongquan Island was near the Zhu South Water Mansion; he knew the region far better than this demon. The effeminate man broke out in a cold sweat, trembling.

"Reporting to my lord! This lowly demon... once served under Lord Yun Shaozi in the Water Mansion. Later, I left to seek my fortune and eventually ended up here at Sea's Cape..."

"Enough!" Li Ximing cut him off, a mocking smile playing on his lips. "Call your subordinates down. Tell them you need to study this formation in detail and are dismissing them. Have them return to your mansion to stand guard. Leave two behind to watch this island, and let no one know you are here."

A thousand calculations and ten thousand schemes might have raced through the demon's mind, knowing his death was imminent, but he was completely powerless. Even if he wanted to furrow his brow or mouth a silent warning to his men, faced with a divine ability, he could not manage a single superfluous expression.

He could only meekly give the orders to the demons waiting above. Li Ximing, augmented by the Immortal Mirror and supervised by his divine ability, watched everything clearly. The demon general was unable to cause the slightest disturbance. The crowd of demons, suspecting nothing, departed together.

Using the Immortal Mirror to scan them from afar and confirming the group showed no abnormalities, Li Ximing returned to the cave. He retrieved a pitch-black alchemy cauldron from his storage bag. It landed with a thud. It was covered in complex patterns of ocean waves and fierce beasts, standing firmly on three legs.

The River-Center Cauldron.

In truth, now that Li Ximing had advanced to the Purple Mansion Realm, a cauldron was no longer essential for his alchemy. This was especially true for the River-Center Cauldron, which wasn't even a Foundation Establishment artifact. But this was a life-saving pill he was refining; he had to be exceptionally cautious.

The demon's face was ashen. In an instant, he reverted to his true form. Li Ximing lifted the carcass, commenting idly, "Yun Shaozi, really? That old cloud-octopus has been dead for years!"

The gap in information between a Jiangnan Purple Mansion cultivator and a Sea's Cape Foundation Establishment demon was simply too vast. What this demon general considered his most secret information was nothing but a joke to Li Ximing. As he inspected the carcass, he saw its dharma power churning violently, emitting pinpricks of gray qi. Li Ximing couldn't help but click his tongue.

'Such fine Valley Water potential, yet he failed to nurture it properly. He stuffed his cultivation with this much blood sacrifice.'

He pondered for a moment, adjusting his plan. He set aside the Serpent Origin Spirit Water he originally intended to use, replacing it with the Baleful Earth Coldspring and adding Clear Dusk Spirit Flower to neutralize the immense demonic qi in the body. Most of the Li family's valuable spirit items were on his person, so he quickly assembled the ingredients.

He opened the cauldron and began refining. Purple fire raged, casting his silhouette onto the stone wall, the shadow leaping and dancing. Xia Shouyu, still kneeling, grew increasingly uneasy. Her eyelids twitched, uncertain of the magnitude of the evil she had just facilitated.

'How long will this old monster refine this pill... If he buries his head in alchemy for ten or twenty years, I'll miss my chance... I'll be trapped in this place until I die.'

She knelt in the bright firelight for two full days and nights. Then, the flames unexpectedly began to recede. Xia Shouyu was astounded. She suddenly saw the old monster slap the cauldron lid.

"Rise!"

Instantly, a clear, pure fragrance permeated the cave. Xia Shouyu felt she had never smelled anything so wonderful. The rich medicinal aroma flooded her senses, rushing to her mind until she felt ecstatic, unsure of where she even was. Then she heard a dull *thud*.

*Bang!*

The cauldron lid flew high. A string of seven pills shot out, each one a blue-white orb etched with luminous purple patterns. They fell, one by one, obediently into Li Ximing’s palm, chiming against each other with the crisp sound of glass.

"Success!"

A sudden joy surged in Li Ximing. Seeing seven pills, he couldn't help but laugh aloud. With a flick of his finger, all seven pills rolled neatly into a jade bottle.

'A joyous surprise!'

What Li Ximing had just refined was not based on some long-existing recipe. He had used the Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill as a foundation, combined it with the profound Valley Water spirit pill method he had read about in the Purple Smoke sect—Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction—and tailored it perfectly to his own injuries. To refine seven pills in a single attempt was proof that his Alchemy Dao had already leaped beyond the bounds of the Xiao Clan lineage. He could truly be called a Purple Mansion Alchemist.

"Good... Based on the Profound Adamant (Xuánquè) refining method and gathering essence (Yùncuì) using the Heavenly Oneness technique... I will call it the Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pill!"

He roared with laughter, terrifying Xia Shouyu, who immediately began kowtowing like a pestle pounding garlic. "Congratulations, Daoist Master, on the creation of this divine medicine! Congratulations, Daoist Master, on taking another step forward!..."

Li Ximing found her praise bizarre and somewhat inauspicious. He stopped laughing. Without giving the woman another glance, he silently retrieved one pill. The purple patterns on its surface were still glowing faintly, exquisitely beautiful.

The moment the pill entered his stomach, pure Valley Water power began to circulate. Under Li Ximing’s guidance, it surged entirely toward his Juque Palace. The Juque Palace, acting as the "Valley", allowed the pill’s nurturing, latent power to disperse instantly, bringing a cooling sensation throughout the palace.

At once, the rushing gray water of the curse rose from within the Juque Palace, surrounding the technique-fire. Li Ximing seized the opportunity to suppress the external flames on his body. The Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art resonated inside and out, and the internal black fire immediately flared.

He sat cross-legged. The technique-fire that had been burning relentlessly on his Dharma body for so long was finally extinguished, transferred completely back into the Juque Palace. There, it was immediately suppressed by the Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pill, unable to spread.

Witnessing this, Li Ximing finally let out a long, heavy breath. When he slowly opened his eyes, the colorful light of a divine ability flashed within them. He exhaled slowly.

"Finally suppressed!"

The pill worked. This meant Li Ximing no longer had to walk around wreathed in flames; he could finally move freely. The Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pill was still slowly consuming the fire within his Juque Palace. While one pill wouldn't last forever, Li Ximing had six more. They could support him for a year, perhaps a year and a half. He might not even need to refine subsequent pills; the technique-fire might be completely extinguished by the combined efforts of his divine ability and the pills alone.

*BOOM!*

With the flames gone, the cave became vast and pitch-black. The black water vein on the ground was still erupting with a violent roar, and the spring water from the surface above began to pour back in, mingling green and black in a dazzling, chaotic display.

Li Ximing grabbed Xia Shouyu and flew out of the cave. The lake's temperature had already dropped. The vibrant green of Pristine Water rapidly faded to the black of Water Mansion water.

The two lesser demons were still standing guard dumbly by the lakeside. Li Ximing knew these two certainly captured humans to satisfy their cravings on normal days. He swept his gaze over them, and both demons’ heads fell to the ground. He tossed Xia Shouyu down.

"Collect their things. And move the people off this island."

Xia Shouyu was confused. Now that this devil was out of seclusion, eating everyone on the island—human and demon alike—would require less effort than speaking a sentence. She could only obey, packing up the two demons' remains, and said respectfully, "There are so many savages... I cannot move them alone... I must return and ask for help to transport them."

Li Ximing himself was poor and didn't even own a spirit boat. He waved his sleeve dismissively. "Fine, then! Forget it. Just lead the way..."

'Lead the way where... where else could we go... Naturally, to my lineage's home, Qingxu Temple...'

Xia Shouyu's heart hammered with anxiety. She glanced up and realized the old monster had grown facial features. His glabella shone with heavenly light, like a true immortal. His face was balanced and proper, his eyebrows smooth, but his eyes were a pale, unsettling gold.

What could she say? She was the one who had released this terrifying master of divine abilities. Was there a second path for her to walk now? She silently began to lead the way, her expression a mask of terror she couldn't control.

Li Ximing, however, felt refreshed and invigorated. Standing in the wind, the sea breeze had never felt so crisp. He took out the jade bottle the demon had given him.

Li Ximing studied it for a moment, his resolve hardening.

'I will absolutely not return to Jiangnan until this injury is healed! This Sea's Cape has a truly ancient feel. I will wander a bit and find a way to get news from home.'

Li Ximing possessed the Immortal Mirror. In a desolate place like Sea's Cape—where in some areas the Great Void didn't even exist—he feared no one. If Changxiao dared to chase him here, the Immortal Mirror would deal with him in a single exchange. His confidence was absolute.

As for the pill in his hand, it was worthless. However, the refinement technique was ancient, seemingly involving the gathering of the essence of heaven, earth, sun, and moon. Li Ximing saw this clearly and felt a stir of interest.

'The refinement method for this... I wonder if it still exists at Sea's Cape. If I could obtain a recipe for refining lunar essence into pills, that would be an infinite, endless supply of resources...'

A method for refining lunar essence into pills would, of course, require more than just moonlight. But Li Ximing considered himself a Purple Mansion Alchemist now. With such a recipe in hand, he could devise countless modifications. Even just using lunar essence to replace one or two key spirit items in other recipes would be an enormous gain.

Xia Shouyu did not dare to delay. After flying over the sea for some time, a peak rose from the ocean surface, crowned by a large complex of temples. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow and murmured, "Oh? A temple?"

Xia Shouyu felt a chill shoot straight to her brain. This man was clearly a great demon; he most likely despised Buddhists. Fearing a misunderstanding, she rushed to explain:

"Reporting to Daoist Master! My lineage is Qingxu Temple! We once worshiped a great divine power known as Xu Xiang, hence the temple... We are not related to the Modern Buddhists or the Ancient Buddhists! Please, my lord, see clearly!"

'Tongxuan Palace's Xu Xiang!'

Li Ximing was familiar with the name. Sumian's profound Dao lineage revered Xu Xiang of Tongxuan Palace as its patriarch. He nodded slightly. "Ah, the lineage of the True Monarch of Treasured Earth. Rare indeed."

Xia Shouyu clearly had not expected Li Ximing to recognize the name. Her heart skipped a beat as she mentally filed away the title "True Monarch of Treasured Earth."

The demon-like master raised an eyebrow. "You also know of Ancient and Modern Buddhists?"

Xia Shouyu said respectfully, "Reporting to Daoist Master, there are Ancient Buddhist lineages at Sea's Cape, but few Modern Buddhists stop here. Most of the lineages at Sea's Cape are temples, but they worship ancient great powers, not many actual Buddhist figures."

Li Ximing nodded at her words, a strange look in his eyes. He wondered if that flock of grasping Buddhists disdained coming here, or if they *could not* come here. He smiled.

"The Modern Buddhists are mostly shameless cowards who bully the weak and fear the strong. Since you all worship an Immortal Dao True Monarch, I suppose they don't dare to go too far."

He stood in the clouds, looking down at the layout below with keen interest. Xia Shouyu waited respectfully by his side, watching as the cultivator smiled.

"Shouldn't you go down first and prepare everyone? If I descend from the sky just like this, I'll frighten everyone in your lineage unconscious. That probably wouldn't be a good thing."



### Chapter 787: Qingxu

As soon as Li Ximing finished speaking, Xia Shouyu nodded eagerly and ducked back into the temple. Li Ximing, meanwhile, rose on the wind, concealed his figure, and began a wide circuit of the island.

The island itself was unremarkable. While its spiritual energy might be considered exceptional here at the Sea's Cape, in Jiangnan it would only rival their ancestral lands at Mount Lijing. The earth vein was substantial, but the land was barren, completely lacking mineral deposits; it possessed neither a fire vein nor a water vein.

'No wonder Xia Shouyu is considered an accomplished cultivator in this place, yet her robes are still a patched-together mess.'

A barren, spirit-dead mountain dominated the center of the island, much like the Western Mountains back at the lake. It was a place where one couldn't even find purchase in the Great Void—a sheer mass of inert earth and stone occupying the terrain. Someone had dug two small caves into it. It seemed the monks of Qingxu Temple were engaged in a generational effort to move the mountain, planning to excavate it entirely.

The temple compound held no surprises. Arrays were pitifully scarce; their poverty was appalling. Only the highest shrine held anything of note: a Daoist statue sculpted from a spiritual item of Treasured Earth, a 'Wondrous Life Stone.' Judging by the aura, it was indeed meant to be Xu Xiang of the Xuanmiao Temple, though the craftsmanship was even cruder than the statue there. This version was standing, not riding his customary donkey.

Having completed his survey, Li Ximing had a clear picture. 'True Monarch Xu Xiang belongs to the Tongxuan Dao lineage. If the Xuanmiao Temple was founded upon receiving a direct branch of Xu Xiang’s legacy, then this Qingxu Temple was, at best, established by some tangential disciple who barely grazed the true teaching. It is far too crude.'

He returned, treading on light, to the space above the temple, just as an urgent bell began tolling, its clangor echoing across the entire island. A flood of monks in yellow robes, their feet in white bindings and black shoes, came rushing up the mountain path, covering the slopes like a yellow cloud. They lined both sides of the path, gradually filling the space with kneeling figures. The yellow-robed monks pushed and shoved; several weaker ones tumbled from the narrow edge, falling down the slope and striking their heads, drawing blood. Still, those behind them continued to press forward, fighting for a place to kneel. Above them, several Qi Refining cultivators zipped through the air, shouting stern reprimands at the chaotic crowd.

Li Ximing swept his gaze over the scene below. Everything was arranged—a sea of bowed yellow robes and heads of all sizes. Xia Shouyu emerged supporting an old man dressed in simple hemp robes, followed closely by two other middle-aged men. The group knelt before the temple entrance, their voices rising in unison: "We humbly welcome the Daoist Master! This small temple at the Sea's Cape is overwhelmed by your presence and eternally grateful!"

The old man’s voice drifted through the air. The sheer scale of the reception was excessive, forcing a frown from Li Ximing. He immediately descended as a beam of light, materializing before the four of them.

The sudden appearance of the white-and-gold-robed Daoist Master made the old man shudder, and he pressed his forehead firmly to the ground. Even seeing this, he struggled to believe it. 'Why would a master of such profound power visit the Sea's Cape? Could it be a Foundation Establishment cultivator in disguise?'

But whether Foundation Establishment or Purple Mansion, Qingxu Temple could afford to offend neither. The old man kept his head bowed. Li Ximing had no intention of bullying a mere Qi Refining cultivator. "What is all this ceremony for? Dismiss them. Just lead me inside."

Xia Shouyu immediately took the lead. The temple's interior paths were narrow corridors carved from the rock, supported by numerous wooden beams. No sunlight penetrated this deep; only the steady glow of dharma lamps kept the passages from true darkness. The old Temple Master hurried to catch up, his voice still trembling. "Daoist Master..."

Li Ximing waved him off. "Which lineage is this? Where does it trace back to?"

The old man and Xia Shouyu exchanged a glance. Drawing on fragmented memories from ancient texts, the old man, Xia Sui, hurried to explain. "Reporting to the Daoist Master! This lowly one is Xia Sui, the unworthy master of Qingxu Temple. Our lineage originates from the Shu region. We were once subordinates of the Xumi Palace. After an upheaval within the palace, it fractured: Qingxu fled east, Qingkong fled south, and Qingzhen fled north. The three temples scattered, eventually settling by the Ju Sea.

"Later, the world changed, as did the ancient rules of Dragon-kin 'sea-herding.' The Ju Sea was seized by Daoist Master Caichi, who renamed it the Peacock Sea. His oppression grew heavier, forcing our ancestors to flee again, finally settling here at the Sea's Cape."

This 'sea-herding' they spoke of was indeed an ancient matter. Once, all seas were the domain of Dragon-kin. Beyond the major oceans like the Hetian Sea and the Vermillion Sea, countless smaller seas existed. Various dragon clans received fiefdoms within these waters, taking turns overseeing the different oceans in a practice known as 'sea-herding.' Today, the Dragon-kin are largely reduced to the Eastern Sea and their numbers have dwindled, but other seas, like the Admirable Sea and the Crimson Reef Sea, are still ruled by dragons bearing the title of Dragon King. Their territories have simply become fixed and hereditary, and the term 'sea-herding' has fallen from common use.

"'Such an ancient origin... surviving has not been easy for you. Qingkong Temple...'"

Li Ximing recognized the name; it was familiar. There had been a minor sect by that name back in the Wu state, a place where Elder White Ape had once concocted medicines. He wondered if it was the same branch. That sect, however, had been annihilated during the demonic calamity.

"Qingkong Temple was destroyed decades ago," he said softly. "The north, furthermore, is the territory of Buddhist cultivators. It is likely that of the old Xumi Palace, your lineage is the only one left. Treasure what you have."

Seeing his knowledgeable demeanor, the old Temple Master Xia found himself mostly convinced. Yet, the man before him was a fiend of immense power, and the words of such beings could rarely be trusted. He could only nod meekly in agreement, offering no real response.

Li Ximing smiled. "Come, show me around."

The two hurried to lead the way, but Li Ximing walked faster, moving as if he knew the temple better than they did. He proceeded directly to a small pavilion. The two middle-aged men behind them lowered their heads and exchanged a nervous glance. Xia Shouyu nearly tripped over herself scrambling to keep up, rushing ahead to open the door for him.

As the pavilion door swung open, the meager collection of scrolls and sutras stored within was revealed. Li Ximing did not step inside, but smiled. "I have heard that the Sea's Cape preserves many unique alchemy techniques, most derived from ancient paths, though they say few are usable today. I happen to be an alchemist. Might I be permitted to study them?"

Xia Shouyu’s heart seized in terror. 'Does he even need to ask? I already know he’s an alchemist... He refined that Great King with nothing but a breath!'

She scrambled to retrieve the few alchemy manuals they possessed, clutching the pile tightly as she offered them respectfully. "The Sea's Cape is remote, and our alchemy Dao is withered. Our lineage possesses no usable recipes... These are all relics from antiquity. With our meager cultivation, we have long been unable to make use of them."

'Truly destitute,' Li Ximing realized. Qingxu Temple didn't have a single functional alchemy recipe. The massive pile Xia Shouyu held was just a collection of ancient, defunct formulas used to pad their archives. He took them and flipped through a few, finding them filled with nonsensical concoctions fabricated by later generations.

"..."

He paused, silent for a moment, then said in a low voice, "Your Qingxu Temple will collect ancient recipes from the surrounding areas for me. If any formula seems suspicious or unique, acquire it."

"Yes..." Xia Shouyu agreed immediately, but the old Temple Master, who had not witnessed the events in the cave, hesitated at the implied cost.

Li Ximing simply turned and walked away. Xia Shouyu hurried after him, only to feel a sudden weight drop into her sleeve. Several jade vials had appeared.

"Consume these resources," Li Ximing’s voice transmitted to her. "Polish your cultivation to its peak as quickly as possible, so that you may consume an Essence Gathering Pill."

Joy flashed in Xia Shouyu's heart. She saw that the old Temple Master and the two middle-aged men were oblivious. She nodded silently. When they returned to the main courtyard gate, the group stood respectfully by his side.

The Daoist Master turned back to them, the Profound Light between his brows flashing. He smiled. "You must understand, that pill was of great use to me. You rendered significant aid both before and during the process, and you were badly injured. Allow me to offer you a reward."

Xia Shouyu and the old Temple Master were overjoyed at his words, but the woman immediately dropped to her knees. "To have aided the Daoist Master and witnessed the birth of an immortal pill is this lowly one’s greatest fortune! How could I dare ask for repayment?"

Li Ximing ignored her protests. With a gentle shake of his gold-and-white sleeve, he issued his command: "Instruct everyone in the temple. Order them all to remain within the temple grounds. For the next seven *shichen*, they are to burn incense and chant sutras. No one is to leave the temple. There will be no cooking or lighting of fires, no riding the wind or striking bells, no gathering or refining of Qi, and no use of any gold or silver implements."

(T\L Note: Shichen converts to "Two Hours)

Though Xia Shouyu did not understand the decree, she immediately sent the two middle-aged men to relay the orders. The men were clearly unaccustomed to taking commands from her, their expressions showing anger they dared not voice. Li Ximing noted this, then pointed at her. "You, and the old Temple Master," he said softly. "The two of you will remain here, in this courtyard. Do not leave."

Xia Shouyu and the old Temple Master exchanged a look and agreed. The Daoist Master in white-gold robes had already vanished.

A creeping dread settled over the two as they sat down in the courtyard, facing each other in silence. After one *shichen* passed, a frigid wind began to howl, whistling through the cracks in the courtyard gate. The cold was bone-piercing. A while later, the ground beneath them began to tremble violently, as if an eruption of Baleful Qi was surging from below. Xia Shouyu’s vision blurred black and gray as dust and debris rained down from the roof beams.

"Aiyooo!" The old Temple Master, barely a Qi Refining cultivator, lost his footing completely. He rolled on the ground, wailing in despair. "It’s over! Fiends are man-eaters by nature! How could we trust his words! He must have been injured before and couldn't act, and now he’s going to devour the entire temple! We invited this doom upon ourselves!

"I heard people on the next island say that masters of great divine ability have entire worlds inside their stomachs... All this commotion... if he isn't moving us into his belly, what else could it be? Aiyooo... we’re going to spend eternity living in the dark inside his guts!"

Although Xia Shouyu was equally terrified, she clung to the memory of him sparing the islanders. She forced a shaky smile. "Great-Grandfather, what nonsense are you sprouting? The Daoist Master commands the Profound Light; his stomach must surely be brightly lit. At least we’ll save money on lamps..."

A short time later, they heard the sounds of shadows moving outside and a chorus of terrified screams. The two were horrified and clung to each other, weeping, but they still dared not leave the courtyard. They waited until the sky began to lighten at dawn, only then did they hear ecstatic shouts from beyond the gate.

"Temple Master! Madam! You must come out! Quickly!"

The voices were brimming with joy. 'The environment inside his stomach must be quite pleasant,' Xia Shouyu thought wryly.

The two finally opened the gate. They were met by bright daylight and two yellow-robed monks kneeling before them. Their robes were covered in dust, but their faces were masks of ecstatic shock. "Madam!" one cried out. "The mountain! It's gone!"

"What?"

Xia Shouyu and the old Temple Master froze in unison. Exchanging a look of disbelief, they both rose on the wind.

It was true. The spirit-dead, barren mountain was completely gone. The massive peak that had dominated the island and blocked their view had vanished, replaced by a vast, open plain stretching as far as the eye could see. Shrouded in the morning mist, the new expanse of flat land measured thousands of acres.

With a bubbling rush, clear spring water erupted from the new ground. The old Temple Master's legs gave out, and he collapsed onto the fresh earth. A moment later, he scrambled back up, ran to the spring, and grabbed a handful of dark soil, bursting into tears. "It’s good... it’s good... From now on, we don't have to dig the mountain..."

Xia Shouyu wiped away her own tears, the memory of the screams returning. She turned to the two monks. "Why did we hear screaming during the night?"

One hurried to answer. "In the middle of the night, the Baleful Qi was overwhelming. Some of the bolder disciples disobeyed orders and went out to look. A few were burned in the eyes by the Qi, and several had their legs broken by falling rocks. There was also one idiot who lit a fire in private to smoke some leaves; a stray spark ignited something, and the blast took off his hand..."

"Haha." Xia Shouyu let out a cold laugh. "Serves the idiots right. A whole vine of lazy, idle fools. It’s fortunate they didn't jeopardize the Daoist Master’s work, otherwise beating them to death would have been too lenient!"

The old Temple Master was still kneeling on the new earth, completely mesmerized. Xia Shouyu had to shake his shoulder forcefully. "Great-Grandfather! The ancient recipes! The alchemy recipes! We must send people immediately! We cannot delay!"

This finally snapped the old man out of his stupor. He nodded frantically, his voice trembling with residual fear and newfound awe. "Men! Everyone, assemble!"

When the remaining monks had gathered, the old Temple Master dispatched them all with frantic orders. Afterward, he stood in the main hall, wringing his hands and muttering to Xia Shouyu, "I have heard that Foundation Establishment lineages possess mountain-moving arts. But even those require complex arrays, rituals, and months of effort! Who has ever heard of leveling an entire mountain in just seven *shichen*? This is a master of great divine ability, without question! He must be one of the figures from Nine Mounds Mountain! If we serve him well... this is an opportunity most people could never dream of!"

Xia Shouyu already knew the 'old fiend' was terrifyingly strong, but she hadn't realized he was capable of *this*. She lifted her chin, a touch of pride in her expression. But she was keenly aware of the Foundation Establishment path Li Ximing had promised her. She kept this guardedly to herself.

'He also promised an Essence Gathering Pill... I cannot let the old man know about that. There are too many fawning men in this temple. I manage everything for you fools day and night. I let you skim resources here and there, but this supreme opportunity? I will not let any of you steal it from me.'

***

Meanwhile, Li Ximing toured the surrounding sea. Treading on light just beneath the waves, he found the seabed was relatively shallow. Sunlight pierced the depths, illuminating the water in a clear azure hue—the distinct color of Converging Water.

He searched the area. It was just as impoverished as the island, holding nothing but coral and white sand. He eventually located one undersea cave with a trace of spiritual energy, but the demon beast dwelling within—having had nothing substantial to hunt—was surprisingly full of clear spiritual qi. He waved his hand and chased it away.

Relying on his current cultivation base and the power of the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, his ability to move mountains—while perhaps not equal to Changxi’s Bound Earth divine abilities—was certainly not lacking. Furthermore, the barren peak had been spirit-dead, unconnected to any water or spirit veins and only loosely tied to the main earth vein. It was little more than a pile of inert rock sitting on the land, making its removal exceptionally easy.

'Everyone in Qingxu Temple has average talent at best... only Xia Shouyu is outstanding. She's usable. Her background is clean—dirt poor—and she knows how to act...'

To earn a rating of 'outstanding' from Li Ximing, her innate talent was naturally excellent. One had to understand that in a desolate place like the Sea's Cape, resources were pitiful. Even as a high-ranking member of the temple, her access to resources was incomparable to cultivators within the inner seas. To reach the late stage of Qi Refining here, relying on almost nothing, was a genuinely difficult achievement.

Since he had promised her the path to Foundation Establishment, he intended to follow through. If she succeeded, she would gain the ability to cross the seas to major lands like Hetian or Vermillion Sea. She certainly wouldn't remain at the Sea's Cape. Why would he waste an Essence Gathering Pill otherwise? Of course, the plan was to bring her back to the lake for his own use.

He already had a role planned for Xia Shouyu. Taking out an array disk, he casually set up a perimeter array within the empty undersea cave. He retrieved the Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pill.

'While I wait for them to collect the recipes, I can continue suppressing the flame, repairing my dharma body, and finding ways to gather intelligence... There is no hurry to return. The Sea's Cape is infinitely safer than Jiangnan right now.'

Li Ximing suddenly understood why Xiao Chuting spent so much time running off to the Northern Sea. That Daoist Master was partly plotting his own advancement, but he was also using the isolation to avoid countless overt and subtle probes back home.

With that thought, Li Ximing cleared his mind and entered seclusion.



# Chapter 788: Two Letters

Pingya Island.

Li Zhouluo, dressed in black robes, was hunched over his desk, brush in hand. The lamps in the hall cast a dim, waning light. Dili Guang stood below the dais, silent as a statue.

An old man was ascending the steps, his back held ramrod straight. His features were proper, but his cheeks were gaunt, making him appear exceptionally frail. His expression was heavy, and the dark, forbidding sword at his waist inspired a natural sense of awe.

Li Zhouluo raised an eyebrow in surprise. Seeing the man arrive before the dais, he quickly set down his brush and rose.

"Elder Donghe," he said in a low voice. "Why did you come without sending word? We have troubled you to make this trip."

Chen Donghe had aged rapidly in recent years, growing thin and ever more silent, becoming a shadow of his former self. His skin seemed draped over his bones. He stood in the hall, completed his salutations, and spoke, his voice hoarse. "This old man is advanced in years. I am rigid and obsolete, and I dare not speak much in the hall. I merely came to see the Clan Head."

Li Zhouluo rarely wore the formal robes of the Clan Head, reserving them only for the most official occasions. He would only retrieve and wear that particular robe when he absolutely had to; the times he had worn it in recent years could be counted on one hand. His daily attire was, as always, his preferred black robes.

Chen Donghe’s gaze swept over him just once, taking in the precise style of those black robes.

Li Yuanjiao.

The last person in the clan who had habitually worn black robes was Li Yuanjiao, the man to whom Li Tongya had entrusted everything just before his death. He was also the man the Fourth Branch considered its founding patriarch, the one who had finally held the branch together. Although Li Yuanjiao also carried the status of having been adopted from the First Branch, he was, at that time, considered a member of the Fourth Branch.

'This young Clan Head before me,' Chen Donghe mused, 'is likely using this attire to declare his own legitimacy, to express his intent to emulate and learn from the past. As for how much ability he truly possesses... he likely cannot be compared to Li Yuanjiao.'

Just as Chen Donghe finished his assessment, Li Zhouluo spoke with a smile. "Elder Donghe is too humble. The clan is in dire need of capable hands. Chen Yang has repeatedly earned merits on the eastern shore, repelling the demonic cultivators several times. He even turned a retreat into an advance and nearly captured one of them alive. We must congratulate you, Elder."

"The congratulations belong to Moongaze Lake," the old man replied flatly, then asked, "I have heard in the last two days that Fei Qing'yi of the Fei family intends to break through to Foundation Establishment. He has come to the main hall to pay respects, hoping to acquire an Essence Gathering Pill. Is this true?"

This was a headache for Li Zhouluo, and the rumors had indeed been swirling wildly. It was true. He nodded. "Correct. Every vassal family has its eyes on this pill. He is currently staying in the side hall, waiting to see me."

Chen Donghe’s prestige within the clan was immense. For several years now, he had not held any practical positions of power, nor did he often see people. If this news hadn't caused such a commotion, it never would have disturbed him. Yet, the old man did not press for details about the Fei family. Instead, he said, "I hear... that we are short-handed on the lake. Now that Fei Qing'yi is preparing for seclusion, I find I cannot sit still. I have hurried here to see if the lake has any task for me."

Li Zhouluo was instantly overjoyed. The position overseeing Mount Qingdu was, after all, still vacant, and they lacked a suitable candidate. With Jiangxia having returned to the eastern shore, Chen Donghe, with his high prestige, was the perfect choice to reassure everyone.

"The Elder's righteousness is profound," Li Zhouluo said. "I will entrust the affairs of Mount Qingdu to you. I shall draft the documents immediately. We are troubling you, senior!"

Chen Donghe closed his eyes briefly and bowed respectfully before departing.

The stewardship of Mount Qingdu was a thankless job, one guaranteed to offend people. Chen Donghe’s willingness to support him solved an urgent crisis for Li Zhouluo.

'I fear the Old Ancestor himself had to personally persuade him to come and help me... *Sigh*.'

Li Zhouluo had no time to dwell on it; the matter of the Fei family still demanded his full attention. He picked up a letter from his desk. It was from the Pavilion Master of the Azure Pond's Heaven-Probing Pavilion—his own grandfather, Li Xizhi.

The letter mentioned many people, filled with heartfelt care. It also mentioned that Li Xizhi himself had gone to the Southern Sea to suppress demonic cultivators and could not return home often, but he had some news to pass along as a reminder.

"Fei Qingyi... within the sect, she has grown gradually closer to Peak Master Qin Xian of Siyao Peak. It seems they intend to finalize a betrothal soon..."

Although Fei Qingyi appeared to stand aloof from worldly affairs, she was no simple character. Several days ago, she had sought out Li Xizhi, stating that both her parents were deceased and she had no elders left in her family. She hoped Li Xizhi might act as her senior elder to accept Qin Xian’s marriage proposal. Her words had been utterly sincere.

In his letter, Li Xizhi had specifically noted that this Qin Xian was a trusted confidant of Dantai Jin, and the two were extremely close. And Dantai Jin had always been the primary representative of the Si family’s interests. How much of this proposed match was genuine emotion and how much was calculation was very difficult to say.

Viewed against this backdrop, Fei Qing'yi’s push for Foundation Establishment suddenly became... interesting. With Fei Qingyi having secured such a powerful connection, the entire Fei family took on a different cast. If Fei Qing'yi also became a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Li Zhouluo felt a deep sense of unease.

He mulled it over and finally gave the order. "Let Fei Qing'yi come in."

Dili Guang immediately withdrew. Before long, a man in white robes entered the hall. His face was handsome and elegant, with rounded features. The space between his brows and eyes was narrow, and his lips were red against white teeth—a sight that drew admiration. He bowed. "Qing'yi pays his respects to the Clan Head!"

This was Li Zhouluo's first time seeing him. He couldn't help but remark, "Qing'yi, what a handsome appearance. It is often said that the men of the north-shore Fei family are the most comely, and it is indeed true."

Fei Qing'yi replied respectfully. Li Zhouluo then asked about the Fei family’s recent situation: the spirit-rice harvest, and whether the cultivators dispatched by the Li family to manage their prefectural peaks were diligent.

The Fei family had only been vassals for a single generation, and the Li clan treated them gently. The stewards sent were either Fei family members themselves or individuals known to be friendly toward them. Naturally, in Fei Qing'yi’s telling, everything was perfect. After circling the topic, Li Zhouluo adopted a serious tone.

"Breaking through to Foundation Establishment is a matter of life and death. Since you are preparing for this, your family must be informed. Have you sent a letter to Azure Pond? What was the reply?"

At the mention of his sister, the young man clearly hesitated for a fraction of a second before answering, "I have sent a letter. Sister’s meaning is... that I should not rely on family connections. I must follow the standard process, report to the lake, and then submit the application to Azure Pond. As for the Essence Gathering Pill... that, too, must be handled according to the lake’s rules."

It was clear that regardless of whether his sister, Fei Qingyi, *could* procure a pill for him, she certainly did not dare to do so directly. Her attitude toward her own family was strictly professional. After hearing this, Li Zhouluo asked, "Your sister’s wedding is approaching; we certainly should not bother her. The lake will make arrangements for this matter. You cultivate Cold Qi. This Essence Gathering Pill will be allocated according to merit, but the slot must also be discussed by the peak masters. It is not a decision I can make alone. You must first go and pay respects to the Old Ancestor and hear his opinion."

Fei Qingyi nodded repeatedly, but then the young man hesitated. "Wedding?"

The look in his eyes was one of pure, unadulterated shock. That startled, disbelieving expression did not seem feigned, and seeing it, Li Zhouluo’s own heart shook.

'Fei Qingyi never even mentioned her marriage to her own family! This...'

Right now, Fei Qing'yi was staring blankly at the floor, his pupils dilated. Li Zhouluo felt a flash of awkwardness. He instantly realized that the distance and avoidance between Fei Qingyi and her vassal family was not entirely an act. And the avoidance was not just for his, Li Zhouluo's, benefit.

While handing a small missive requesting an audience—just delivered by Dili Guang—from Ding Weizeng, Li Zhouluo spoke with deliberate hesitation. "It seems my information traveled a step faster. I heard it was a joyous occasion. I only heard whispers, but it seems Fellow Daoist Qingyi and a certain Peak Master in the sect have formed a deep bond and are very much in love."

As he spoke, Fei Qingyi’s expression shifted from shock to joy. He was just about to ask for more details when Dili Guang stepped forward, bowing respectfully and interrupting. "Clan Head, Guest Elder Ding has an urgent report."

"Good! Bring him in quickly!" Li Zhouluo replied, his voice bright with relief.

Fei Qing'yi was perceptive enough to take the cue. Despite his burning curiosity, he knew he had to withdraw. Just as his hurrying figure vanished down the side-hall corridor, the look of relief vanished from Li Zhouluo's face.

"Show Ding Weizeng in," he said in a low tone.

Dili Guang withdrew, but the next sound was a chaotic rush of footsteps. To Li Zhouluo’s surprise, Chen Yang was the first to burst wildly into the hall. His dharma robes were torn and ragged, and a shallow red scratch marked his neck, but his expression was one of absolute delight. He bowed deeply.

"Clan Head! The Capital immortals Dao has retreated!"

Li Zhouluo shot up from his seat, his expression electrifying with hope. "What?! Where are the cultivators from Profound Peak? What about the territory?"



# Chapter 789: The West Bank Blood Petition

Chen Yang’s face lit up with joy. "The Capital immortals Dao retreated overnight! They’ve vanished completely. The entire wilderness is empty. We weren't stopped until we reached Shanji Prefecture. It seems both Shanji and the Profound Peak mountain gate have been occupied by someone else."

"Kong Guxi and the others were overjoyed and returned to the wilderness. They left only two people behind to reorganize their forces. The rest followed Kong Guxi here to the lake to offer their congratulations and thanks. They are waiting outside the island."

"Excellent!" Li Zhouluo stood up, beaming.

Chen Yang bowed, equally full of smiles—the two actually bore a slight resemblance in that moment. Chen Yang presented a jade box. "Clan Head, both Dharma Artifacts are inside, returned to the clan as requested."

He offered the jade box first, then retrieved a dark, black pearl from his robes, reporting respectfully, "Clan Head, some days ago, demonic cultivators came to raid us. I, the Kong family members, and Lord Ding worked together to set an ambush. Although we were unlucky and the demonic cultivator escaped, we had an unexpected gain."

"This is the Dharma Artifact that cultivator used to cover his retreat. It was originally intended to self-detonate, but unexpectedly, Sect Master Kong summoned a spiritual mountain and barely managed to suppress it, allowing the artifact to survive..."

He knelt with profound respect, hands raised, presenting the black pearl in his palms. "This item is called a [Mishui Pearl]. It was forged from extremely pure Mishui Cold Iron. While the material itself isn't extraordinary, the refinement technique is brilliant. It is a Dharma Artifact of Cold Qi."

This was also exceptionally good news. Li Zhouluo nodded cheerfully. The Li Clan rules were strict; he could not immediately inspect a tribute item himself. He had Dili Guang take the pearl and examine it while he asked, "I often hear that these demonic cultivators travel in small groups. It’s surprising that Protector Ding acted and still let them escape. They must not be simple characters. Did you notice anything else?"

Chen Yang nodded repeatedly. "The Clan Head sees clearly. Protector Ding and I both attacked, only to find that while they were covered in demonic aura on the surface, their cultivation underneath was extremely pure. We fear they aren't rogue demonic cultivators, but rather practitioners from another Dao lineage in disguise. Fearing trouble, even though we had a chance to encircle and kill them, we only forced out this Dharma Artifact and let him go."

"These people are formidable. They weren't using their full strength in the previous raids, but we cannot identify their lineage. Protector Ding and I discussed it; they are most likely cultivators from overseas."

Li Zhouluo nodded slightly and glanced at Dili Guang. The Northen Yue youth replied, "Clan Head, this Dharma Artifact is indeed exceptionally pure. There are no traces of blood-qi refinement."

Only then did Li Zhouluo speak. "The clan will render a decision on this matter later, but your merit has been recorded. As for the Capital immortals Dao retreat, it must be the result of calculations among the Purple Mansion ancestors. They must have negotiated the handover of Shanji Prefecture... You have worked hard, Protector. Several elders wish to see you. For now, please send the Kong family members in."

Chen Yang bowed and retreated. Li Zhouluo waited a moment before Kong Guxi hurried in from outside the hall, hiking up his robes as he ran.

"Greetings, Clan Head!"

Kong Guxi’s eyebrows were arched high, his eyes shining brightly, and the wrinkles on his face had smoothed out. His aged face seemed a perfect barometer for Profound Peak Gate's fate, now radiating a bright, excited vigor. He knelt solidly on the floor, proclaiming respectfully, "The Capital immortals have withdrawn! Congratulations, Clan Head!"

Kong Guxi had no regard for saving face. Despite being a mighty late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, he dropped to his knees before Li Zhouluo without hesitation. This forced Kong Qiuyan, standing behind him, to kneel as well. Where previously this woman had always kept her head bowed and eyes nearly shut in the presence of the Li family, she now looked up, her gratitude unmistakable. Beside them, Fu Yuezi knelt like a stone statue, his eyes calm, as if this concerned him in no way whatsoever.

Li Zhouluo helped the sect master up, smiling. "This is a joyous occasion for you as well, Sect Master. All of Profound Peak Gate's former institutions in the wilderness will be returned to your control. The agreement between our two families remains in effect. The Lake will not occupy a single inch of Profound Peak Gate territory."

Kong Guxi agreed obsequiously, but the Li family clearly wanted nothing more to do with this mess. Li Zhouluo said gently, "Since the enemy has retreated and the wilderness is back in your hands, you cannot let the hearts of your people scatter any longer! The banner of Profound Peak Gate must be raised again as soon as possible... Sect Master, you should delineate your territories, recruit a new batch of disciples, and rebuild Profound Peak Gate immediately!"

Hearing this, Kong Qiuyan was stunned. There was no such thing as a free lunch in this world. They had received such an immense favor; she expected they would have to leave behind most of their Daoist texts and send away all their guest elders just to escape Moongaze's grasp. She thought freedom would come at an unimaginable price, yet here it was, laid out before them. She stared at Li Zhouluo, lost in confusion and shock.

Even Fu Yuezi moved for the first time; the face beneath the golden mask seemed to quirk into a smile.

Only Kong Guxi remained kneeling blankly, answering nothing.

To the other two, those words were heavenly news. But to Kong Guxi’s ears, they meant something entirely different.

'The agreement between your ancestor and our Daoist Master has been fulfilled. My family has done more than enough. Our Daoist Master is still missing; how can we spare the effort for you? We are handing the wilderness back. Rebuild your sect quickly. After this, Profound Peak Gate's affairs are yours alone!'

The fate of the Profound Peak Gate mountain gate was still unknown, and the Capital immortals Dao was still watching like a tiger. The Kong family had only Fu Yuezi, who excelled at combat. What could he possibly accomplish alone in the wilderness? Raising the sect banner now was undoubtedly an extremely dangerous proposition...

Looked at another way, Profound Peak Gate had nothing left for the Li family to exploit. Their mountain gate was gone. Their Purple Mansion spiritual artifacts and resources had been presented to the Li family. Their Purple Mansion Grand Array was lost. All that remained was the 'Fool's Mountain Chase' Dao lineage, a handful of Foundation Establishment treasure medicines, Dharma artifacts, and basic supplies—things the Li family probably wouldn't even want.

He could only bow and say, "The wilderness is currently in chaos and ruins. We must reorganize thoroughly before we can consider rebuilding the sect."

Although Li Zhouluo was also waiting for news from Shanji Prefecture, his attitude remained firm. "Sect Master, you needn't be so modest. My family has no intention of interfering with the Profound Peak Gate Dao lineage. The territory in the wilderness will be transferred to your sect. The resources stored on our mountain will also be returned by the Jade Court Guard, not one item missing. All subsequent arrangements are entirely up to your sect."

Kong Guxi’s expression was awkward and uneasy. Unable to remain stubborn, he said shamefully, "I ask only that the Clan Head grant us some time..."

Li Zhouluo nodded, lowering his voice. "Rest assured, Sect Master. Focus on cleaning up the wilderness. With the three great mountains moved from Shanji, Profound Peak Gate's foundation still remains."

Hearing this exchange, Kong Guxi estimated the Li family wasn't forcing him to establish the sect *immediately*, and he breathed a sigh of relief. Li Zhouluo didn't waste any more words, gave his instructions, and politely dismissed him. The other two, however, seemed to be in high spirits as they followed Kong Guxi out of the main hall.

Li Zhouluo ordered someone to investigate the situation in Shanji Prefecture. The Capital immortals Dao, a weight pressing on his mind, was gone, and the Profound Peak Gate clan, which had been stuck to his hands, was about to be sent away. His mood soared. "I heard Xinghan just returned from the west. I have good news for her. Hurry and send her in!"

Dili Guang left immediately. Before long, Li Xinghan entered the hall, travel-worn and carrying a sword on her back. She announced respectfully, "Greetings, Clan Head!"

"Sister, please rise!"

Li Xinghan had indeed just returned from the great desert. She had also heard the news of the Capital immortals Dao's retreat and was overjoyed. After congratulating Li Zhouluo, he looked at her and asked, "How are things in the desert?"

Li Xinghan knew her brother had likely already been briefed, but he wanted to hear it from her, who had participated personally. She sighed. "There are numerous demonic cultivators. Protector An mentioned that the desert never used to have so many; they've only increased in recent years. We expelled them, but that section of the city wall has completely collapsed. We can no longer harvest Qi there."

"What a pity." Many of the Li family’s Bright Yang cultivation arts relied on harvesting Qi from that ancient wall. With the Purple Mansion ancestor gone and the source now severed, it was a serious problem. "I also received reports," Li Zhouluo lamented, "that the desert outpost is separated from us by the Western Mountains, making it difficult to maintain. The family has always seen it as a hardship posting; the direct descendants all dislike going. Now that the wall is down, everyone is saying we should just abandon it."

Li Xinghan frowned at this. "Clan Head," she advised, "our market has been delayed because of the conflict with the Capital immortals Dao. It’s ninety percent complete but sitting idle in the dense forest. While now isn't the right time, we will eventually open it. If we can hold the desert outpost, the increased traffic will be highly beneficial for the market."

"The talk in the family is just elders worrying about their descendants. We don't need to heed it." Li Zhouluo laughed aloud. "I heard you brought something back for Fifth Brother, is that true?"

Li Xinghan wasn't surprised. She had acquired the White Falcon Gold openly, exchanging her own resources with the clan stores to get it, so of course, Li Zhouluo knew. "That's correct," she replied. "I obtained seven liang of White Falcon Gold in the desert. It’s for Fifth Brother. I already sent someone to deliver it."

Li Zhouluo shook his head. "You send it over today, and in a month, it will probably be a hairpin on some beauty's head. You don't know his personality. He asked me for various types of metals several times in the past few years... He’s useless at most things, but he has a real talent for forging hairpins."

Li Xinghan sighed at this. "I suspected it was for such a purpose. But this was the first time he ever asked me for anything; I couldn't just ignore him. It’s not a critical item anyway. Consider it material for him to practice his craft."

Li Zhouluo, still in good spirits these past days, chuckled and shook his head. He picked up a black scroll with silver borders from his desk. "But let’s not talk about him. I have some excellent news for you."

He smiled. "A few days ago, several of the clan elders were talking and you were mentioned. The Old Master brought up the topic of your Dharma Artifact. Since the Daoist Master isn't currently in the clan, and your sword requirements are very high, he suggested that you inherit one of the family's blades."

Li Xinghan loved the Way of the Sword. Hearing this, she grew visibly excited. "Heavens... Which one could it be?!"

Li Zhouluo untied the scroll in his hand, slowly unfurling it as he smiled. "Three chi, nine cun, and three fen long. Ninety-two jin and twelve liang heavy. Bright as flowing water, pure as white frost..."

'Hanlin!'

Li Xinghan knew the dimensions of every artifact-sword in the clan by heart. The moment Li Zhouluo recited the length, she knew. She was simultaneously stunned and overjoyed. "How... how can it be Hanlin?"

Many in the Li clan practiced the sword, and Hanlin—known as the sword "Colder than Winter Snow, Sharp as the Autumn Harvest"—was highly revered. Its previous owner, Li Xijun, had managed the clan's affairs, lending the blade an extra aura of authority. Since Li Xijun left no heirs, it had remained in the treasury... This sword held a unique weight among the clan's blades. Excluding the sword on Li Zhouluo's desk—Coilling Dragon Pillar—which was more symbolic than practical, Hanlin was second only to Qingchi.

Li Xinghan had imagined that Li Zhouluo might get a new blade and pass the Xushi sword down to her, or perhaps that Li Chenghuai would give her his Darksea Serpent. She had never dared to covet Hanlin. She stood frozen in place.

Li Zhouluo gave a long sigh. "When Grand-Uncle Xijun fell, the Old Master took this sword back. No one from the Second branch was qualified to take it. Thus, the Old Master overruled all objections and decided to entrust it to you first."

Li Xinghan accepted the scroll with both hands, her head bowed low. This kind of precious artifact could not be transferred by proxy; she would have to take the scroll and retrieve it herself. Her eyes reddened. "I must go thank the Old Master personally."

Li Xinghan was part of the First branch. If any other elder from that branch had tried to designate Hanlin for her, it would have invited gossip and criticism. Only the Old Master, Li Xuanxuan, could make such a decision with absolute authority, beyond all reproach.

Li Zhouluo nodded, watching her leave. He processed affairs in the hall for the better part of the day, his mood excellent, realizing he hadn't rested in days. Sighing, he finally decided to allow himself a short walk.

He had barely stepped out of the hall when he saw several of his uncles waiting before the palace, all wearing bitter expressions. He stopped immediately, frowning. "What is it?"

Dili Guang shook his head.

Li Zhouluo had learned well the tenacity of these clansmen in recent days. When it came to begging for resources or positions, each was more shameless than the last, yet they were all his elders. Seeing them gathered like this could only mean trouble. "We'll use the side hall," he said darkly. "Do not let them see us."

He had just turned when Li Wen approached with a steady stride. Li Wen bowed before the hall. "Clan Head, the Jade Court Guard has received word. A large group of cultivators ascended Mount Qingdu to submit a report. They presented a joint blood petition, claiming that the leaders of the Four Prefectures of the West Bank are colluding, deceiving their superiors and oppressing the populace. They plead for Mount Qingdu to intervene and administer justice."

Li Zhouluo’s heart seized. The joy vanished from his face, replaced by utter disbelief. "What?! The Four Prefectures of the West Bank?!"

He froze, asking in a low voice, "Where are they now?"

"They are all on Mount Qingdu," Li Wen replied. "It coincided with several elders emerging from seclusion. Even Lord Chengzhi has been summoned up the mountain. The matter has blown up."

Although Li Chengzhi was a mortal, he was the Daoist Master's direct son, so the loyal Li Wen still referred to him as 'Lord'. Li Zhouluo suddenly broke out in a cold sweat. The Li family consisted of Sixteen Prefectures, Two Peaks, and One Mountain; the West Bank accounted for four of those prefectures. To put it bluntly, nothing this serious had happened at Mount Qingdu since the prefecture system was established, let alone a blood petition from all the cultivators of the West Bank!

He gritted his teeth. "No wonder that crowd was waiting at the entrance..."

The names of the Sixteen Prefectures, Two Peaks, and One Mountain were all clear in Li Zhouluo’s mind. He immediately identified the individuals responsible: "An Xuanxin, Ren Ting, Li Chengpan, and Li Hun... They went to Mount Qingdu, not the Jade Court Guard... This means Li Chengpan and Li Hun are the ones pulling the strings..."

The West Bank was populated by the scattered, minor clans left behind from He Jiumen’s era. They had always lacked a voice within the Li family, ignored by every major faction. Yet, the region was rich in spiritual ore, and its prefectures were always carved up as spoils by the different cliques...

"An Xuanxin represents the Huayu faction. Ren Ting’s Ren Clan belongs to the Lijing faction. Li Chengpan is a direct descendant who was pushed into his position, and Li Hun is from a branch family... Good. Everyone’s involved."

He closed his eyes briefly. "I'm heading to Mount Qingdu immediately... You've heard the details. Is the evidence conclusive?"

Li Wen replied respectfully, "It’s about eighty or ninety percent certain."

"Are Mount Qingdu and the Jade Court Guard blind... "

Li Zhouluo felt this news was a bolt from the blue. He rushed over, listening as Li Wen replied earnestly, "My lord, the situation is complex. I didn't understand it all. It is better if you hear the details on the peak."

Li Wen was honest and loyal, but it was precisely this honesty that frustrated Li Zhouluo now. He had no chance to slow down and prepare on the way. He could only steel himself and fly over. Moments later, he landed on the summit of Mount Qingdu. As expected, it was crowded everywhere.

"The Clan Head is here!" Cries rose from all over the peak.

The main hall at the highest point was already full. The elder Chen Donghe stood off to the side, while the white-robed An Siwei stood with his head bowed. The others seated were all seniors—some with cultivation, some without, some looking ancient beyond measure—all occupying the head seats.

Li Zhouluo’s gaze swept the room, landing on the key figures.

First on the left was the Daoist Master’s direct son, the aged Li Chengzhi, who looked terribly weak and seemed to be slumped in his chair. Standing beside him, powdered and painted, was his own Fifth Brother, Li Zhouming.

Below them sat the elder Li Chenghao. This man was the uncle of his elder brothers, Li Zhoufang, and had recently broken through to Qi Refining, granting him new status in the clan. Middle-aged and strong, his hair only lightly grayed, he stared intently at Li Zhouluo.

On the other side sat elders of an even higher generation: the gray-robed, severe-faced Elder Li Xi’e, who was Li Cheng’s father and held immense status. Slightly below him was the rounded, pale-skinned Li Xixuan, the father of his aunt, Li Minggong.

'This is a disaster.'

Among the oldest generation of elders, these four were the only ones who really mattered. Li Zhouluo sighed internally. Fortunately, Li Xuanxuan’s expression remained normal, which calmed his nerves slightly. He walked to the main seat amid the greetings and only then noticed someone kneeling on the floor.

The man appeared to be a minor family head from the West Bank, surnamed He, distantly related to the He Jiumen of old. He must have been the one who led the petition. But he had no right to speak here. Chen Donghe had already presented the silk document.

The first item listed accused Li Chengpan and the others of soliciting bribes when collecting spiritual grain and ore, amounting to a staggering thirty percent cut.

This wasn't unheard of; such things happened in every prefecture and peak. The Jade Court Guard was spread thin across the lake prefectures and mostly just monitored the final year-end collections. After being caught a few times, most officials learned to steal small amounts—one or half a percent—during normal times, unlike Li Chengpan, who was blatantly arrogant.

"It's only because the West Bank has no backing... they are just lambs to the slaughter."

Li Zhouluo skipped past that line. The next accusation was far more severe: The He family accused Ren Ting of tyranny, abuse of power, and forcing a woman of the He family to become his concubine.

The final item concerned the West Bank's mineral veins, which were complex and shifting. New branch veins often appeared, sometimes changing monthly. An Xuanxin and the others had colluded to conceal these new veins and embezzle the ore... They had sent people from the East Bank to do the actual mining, but someone with intentions had recorded it all.

He finished reading, set the letter down, his heart sinking. 'These four... their connections run too deep...'

Before he could speak, the rounded, pale Li Xixuan said in a low voice, "Clan Head! The Jade Court Guard already investigated the matter regarding Ren Ting. The He family sent that girl over themselves! Now they’re turning around and slinging mud... We have the marriage contract and the letters. The man’s fawning words are written right on them. We can bring them out for confrontation!"

Li Zhouluo looked at the stack of letters presented to him and paused. The Ren Clan was part of the Lijing faction and also part of the First branch. Li Xixuan's wife—Li Minggong's mother—was surnamed Ren. This Ren Ting was Li Minggong's biological uncle...

The others remained silent, clearly confident in their own positions, waiting for him to deal with the letters. Li Zhouluo could only brace himself and question the kneeling Clan Head He.

The old man just lamented, "Those above us are Immortals and officials. When they give us so much as a look, what choice do we have but to fawn over them?"

His words left Li Zhouluo speechless. Nearby, Li Chengzhi hesitated, but Fifth Brother Li Zhouming smiled. "Clan Head, the matter of An Xuanxin’s mines is also suspicious. All records have been retrieved from Yuting. Those minerals *were* delivered to the island."

Li Zhouluo finally found an opening. "Why did they not follow standard procedure?"

Li Zhouming hurried to explain, "At that time, we were in the middle of the war with the Capital immortals Dao. There was no reply from the island for days, and that branch vein was about to shift and disappear. An Xuanxin feared the resources would be wasted. He submitted a separate letter after the excavation, which the family did review at the time."

Li Zhouluo did recall these items. But such reports came in every year; minor branch veins that appeared outside the main records were impossible to verify. Whatever amount they reported was the amount recorded. Before he could respond, the displeased-looking Li Chenghao spoke up: "I personally trained Li Chengpan! Everyone in this family knows his character! He is incapable of doing such things!"

This was the uncle of his elder brothers, the Li Zhoufang brothers. Li Zhouluo was already feeling numb. "There is evidence for every matter. How can this be settled with a simple 'impossible'?"

Of the group, only Li Chenghao's father, the gray-robed Elder Li Xi’e, had not spoken. Now that all his allies had said their piece, everyone turned to look at the old man. Li Xi’e coughed once and said quietly, "We ask the Clan Head to investigate clearly."

"..."

The entire group of elders stared at him. Li Zhouluo studied the letter, suppressing his irritation.

'Father is already in seclusion, otherwise, I would fetch the Talisman Brush and test these people!'

Li Chengzhi and Li Zhouming, as direct Purple Mansion descendants, likely couldn't be tested accurately, and Li Xixuan was probably the same. But he didn't need to test the elders. Li Zhouluo ignored their words and simply ordered, "Bring the four individuals in question up."

A "Yes" echoed from far below. The four men entered the hall and knelt one by one. Li Chengpan knelt at the very front. He was Li Zhouluo’s clan-uncle, and handsome enough, but he kept his head down and said nothing.

Among the three behind him, the one with the highest status was An Xuanxin. The young man's answers were fluent; according to him, every single mine vein had been reported, and he could even pinpoint the exact date for each.

Li Zhouluo asked a few more questions. The four either remained silent or stubbornly stuck to their stories. The atmosphere in the hall finally grew awkward. The elders fell silent, carefully listening to Li Zhouluo's interrogation.

Li Zhouming, who had been looking around enjoying the show, seemed to wake up as if from a dream. He finally sensed the shift in the atmosphere. He stood up straight, studying the expressions of everyone present, and muttered internally:

'Aren't they just making things difficult for Fourth Brother... What are these elders plotting...'



# Chapter 790: Making a Scene

Li Zhouluo hesitated for a moment, lifting the letter. Every eye in the hall was fixed on him. An Siwei, a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the An family, stood beside An Zheyan but remained silent.

Matters concerning the ore veins were notorious for exploitation. An Xuanxin, the man in charge, was someone Li Zhouluo had personally summoned before. Both the young man and his elder brother, An Xuantong, were renowned geniuses of their generation. Li Zhouluo was familiar enough with them and quickly formed a strategy.

'The An family is illustrious; they have no need to skim a few minerals. Besides, the daily ledgers all balance. They didn't take anything. These four individuals represent ninety percent of the influence on the lake. I must divide them.'

He set the letter down and spoke in a conciliatory tone. "Elders, please, do not be anxious. All matters must be handled reasonably. I have personally reviewed every daily report Xuanxin has submitted. This issue regarding the shifting branch veins is precisely why we are finalizing new regulations. I was just about to consult with him on this. Naturally, there has been no misappropriation or theft."

Having offered an exit, he gave a subtle signal. Dili Guang immediately moved to help An Xuanxin to his feet. As the kneeling An family members rose, the elderly An Zheyan, face flushed red, began a long tirade about his failure in disciplining the youth, only to be pulled back by An Siwei. The middle-aged Foundation Establishment expert turned, fixed An Xuanxin with an icy glare, and declared:

"However, the West Bank is in turmoil. An Xuanxin is guilty of negligent oversight! I shall apprehend him immediately and deliver him to the Jade Court for interrogation!"

He seized An Xuanxin, hauling him up from the floor, and led the other An members straight out of the hall. They had made a clean retreat.

As soon as the An family departed, Li Chengzhi —who had been reclining weakly in his seat—immediately bowed his head. Li Zhouming, who had previously spoken in support of the Ans, felt a growing sense of unease. While he excelled at little else, his many years as a rake, dedicated to deciphering the hearts of women, had made him an expert at reading expressions. Watching the clan elders, the infamous wastrel grew uncomfortable. With a *snap*, his fan closed, and his grip tightened around it.

Most people only offered him superficial respect; privately, none took him seriously. Li Chenghao, his hair gray, watched the An family depart before turning to ask in a low voice, "Are Zhoufang and Zhouyang still not here?"

The fathers of those two—the eldest and second eldest of the 'Zhou' generation—had perished, making their uncle, Li Chenghao, their closest relation. They were usually completely obedient to him, yet they were conspicuously absent. Without the backing of those two, and the other elders being mere mortals, Li Chenghao felt a surge of insecurity.

Li Zhouluo, having temporarily settled the An Xuanxin matter, focused on the remaining petitioners. One was Ren Ting, the maternal uncle of Li Minggong. The other was Li Chengpan, his own clan-uncle. Each was more difficult to handle than the last. He decided to squeeze the softest target first. "Li Hun!" he called.

Li Hun’s seniority placed him outside the main lineage. He only carried any weight because his father, Li Anshuo, managed affairs on the North Shore and had married into the Chen family. In this main hall, however, that prestige meant nothing. He was huddled near the back, shrinking away. At Li Zhouluo’s summons, the middle-aged man trembled, shuffled forward two inches on his knees, and stammered, "This lowly one is present!"

Li Zhouluo suspected the three petitioners had coordinated their stories. He began the interrogation: "You oversee the spirit rice. A thirty-percent bribe must have passed through your hands. I am currently summoning the various families of the West Bank and all peak officials for cross-examination. Confess now who ordered you... Otherwise, the moment the truth is exposed, I will execute you first."

Li Hun kowtowed. "Reporting to the Patriarch! There was such an arrangement. But this lowly one was only following orders! I was instructed to collect the payments in two separate portions. The directive came from Guest Elder Ye of Nine Gates Peak. He said it was an order from the Nine Gates Peak Supervisor... These matters... they have always been handled by the Nine Gates Peak Supervisor."

The hall fell silent. Li Zhouluo froze. The Nine Gates Peak Supervisor... was An Xuanxin, the very man who had just walked free.

"Where is this Guest Elder Ye?" Li Zhouluo demanded.

From the side, Chen Donghe replied: "I looked into him. Several months ago, he reported achieving peak Embyronic Breathing. He registered his status with the family and has already departed to seek an opportunity for a breakthrough."

'A convenient escape,' Li Zhouluo thought. He glanced at Li Hun, who looked genuinely terrified and likely knew nothing deeper. He gave a low command: "Dili Guang. Go retrieve An Xuanxin and the woman from the He family. Then proceed to the shore and begin interrogating the peak officials. Bring every waiting family head up the mountain, one by one."

Chen Donghe answered quietly, "Patriarch... the He family woman has already taken her own life."

The words made Li Zhouluo grit his teeth. Suddenly, the pale, plump Li Xixuan knelt forward, sighing dramatically. "Patriarch! These underlings are nothing but insects, scheming and lying! It is impossible to discern the truth! I beg you... please ask Li Chenghuai! Let him use a Dharma Art, and this whole mess will be understood instantly!"

This demand caught Li Zhouluo completely off guard, stunning him. Li Chenghao immediately seconded the request, dropping to his knees. "The boy's reputation cannot be ruined like this! Please, Patriarch, summon our brother to ascertain the truth!"

Li Chengzhi remained seated in silence. The final elder, Li Xie, stirred. He was an old man with thinning white hair and a kind face, but he merely closed his eyes, refusing to join the petition.

Li Zhouluo fell silent, his gaze sweeping across the petitioners. Li Chengzhi, who clearly wanted to protect An Xuanxin, had been forced to open his eyes at the mention of the "Nine Gates Peak Supervisor," yet he remained silent. Of the four, this uncle seemed the most reluctant participant.

That left Li Xixuan and Li Cheng—the only one with a cultivation base—as the most insistent. Li Chenghao's father, Li Xie, had built his entire reputation on the martyrdom of his own sons; he clearly prized his standing and now appeared deeply conflicted.

'This is obviously a coordinated effort... Why are they so insistent that Father break his seclusion?'

Unable to grasp their true motive, he gritted his teeth. "Father is injured. It is not appropriate for him to break seclusion over such a minor issue."

Li Xixuan sighed, his pale, plump face a mask of regret. "We were hoping the family could make this decision together. We must ask Li Chenghuai to come. This concerns the honor of the entire clan. An investigation would take less than half a day... Otherwise, Chengpan’s life is utterly ruined!"

Li Xixuan had blocked every rebuttal. In the center of the hall, Li Chengpan remained silent, head bowed, the very image of patient suffering. The pressure shifted entirely back to Li Zhouluo. But before he could respond, a furious shout echoed through the hall:

"Did you esteemed elders not hear the Patriarch’s decision?"

The public roar stunned the assembly. Everyone looked up, astonished to see a young master in flowing red robes striding forward, his face a mask of fury.

It was Li Zhouming. He couldn't restrain himself any longer. The direct grandson of the Purple Mansion patriarch, seething with anger, slammed his fan down and shouted:

"If it cannot be investigated now, then lock them all up and wait a year or two! One of you is browbeating, the other is sighing in despair. What exactly are you trying to pull?"

The hall was struck dumb. People exchanged confused glances, whispering amongst themselves. 'What madness has seized this young master now?'

Li Xixuan was stunned speechless by the outburst. He was the father of Li Minggong; who dared treat him with such contempt? His pale face instantly flushed crimson. "You..." he sputtered.

Li Zhouming’s anger had been simmering throughout the entire proceeding. His red robes trembled as he advanced another step. "I only call you 'Elder' out of respect! If you hadn’t sired a talented daughter, what the hell would you be? I may be a wastrel, but at least I know how to stay down! What do you want? What?! You’re taking advantage of the Daoist Master's absence to bully us juniors, aren't you! You... you... you son of a..."

Even fouler curses were about to spill forth when Li Chengzhi, shocked out of his deathbed stupor, sat bolt upright. He grabbed Li Zhouming’s sleeve, roaring, "You animal! Are you trying to stage a rebellion?"

The hall descended into chaos. Li Zhouming was known as an impulsive wastrel, but his temperament was usually predictable. No one had anticipated this sudden explosion of madness. As the direct grandson of the Purple Mansion patriarch, no one dared truly provoke him, so they all scrambled backward. Only his father, Li Chengzhi, leaped to his feet—back no longer aching, legs suddenly strong, brimming with vigor—and seized him, screaming insults.

Yet his father was only a mortal; he stood no chance of restraining his son.

Unreliable though he was, Li Zhouming was still at the third level of Qi Refining. Of the four elders, only Li Chenghao possessed a cultivation base, and he was a level weaker. When this wastrel went berserk, he was like a bull. Terrified of being slapped to death, Li Xixuan lost all decorum, scrambling backward in a panic as Li Chenghao and two younger relatives rushed frantically to shield him.

"Wicked beast!"

Li Zhouming tuned out his father’s screaming. He finally understood. He realized the speech his family had fed him earlier was *also* part of this scheme to pressure Li Zhouluo. A wave of hot, resentful fury washed over him. The surrounding chaos—the shouting, the gasps of alarm—made his head spin. For the first time in his life, his eyes widened not in petulance, but in genuine rage. He roared, "Shut your damn mouths!"

He infused the roar with spiritual energy. It exploded like sudden thunder. Cultivators merely flinched; the mortals in the hall nearly had their eardrums rupture. Every gaze snapped toward him.

They saw a young man with sharp features and strong brows. His usual, indifferent demeanor had been utterly burned away by rage. A shimmering radiance—the light of Bright Yang —welled up around him. With his eyes wide in fury, he stood center-stage, hands clasped behind his back.

As the echo faded, the hall filled with the rustle of robes as nearly everyone dropped to their knees.

Li Zhouming was, after all, the biological grandson of Li Ximing. Despite the garish red robes, despite the powder and rouge, the resemblance in his brow and eyes was undeniable. Standing there radiating Bright Yang, his glare burning, he looked exactly like the Clan Head. He was only thinner and lacked the spark of Profound Light between the brows. The sight terrified the assembly. Even the Foundation Establishment guest elders had to avert their gaze, exchanging a look before kneeling.

"Daoist Master..."

Even his own father, Li Chengzhi, felt his heart leap into his throat. He released his grip as if he had touched hot coals. The insult "beast" died on his lips. His legs gave out, and he nearly collapsed.

The courtyard was utterly silent, broken only when points of red light materialized beside Li Zhouming. A powerful, stocky man clad in crimson battle armor instantly appeared at his side.

The man radiated a ferocious, baleful aura. He had a strong jaw and a bristling mustache, and his eyes cut like swords, forcing everyone to lower their gaze. He held two short clubs, his chin slightly lifted, standing guard by Li Zhouming. His expression was so dark it looked ready to bleed.

The Palace-Yang Tiger: Ding Weizeng.

Only at this moment did everyone—both on the mountain and below—finally remember exactly who he was: the direct grandson of the Purple Mansion patriarch. They fell silent as winter cicadas, daring not even to meet another's gaze. The hall was filled with kneeling figures, most pressing their foreheads to the stone floor.

"Your Highness..."

Hearing the trembling calls from below, Li Zhouming seemed to snap out of a trance. He tossed his fan aside, stepped back, and waved his hands frantically. "My apologies for troubling Protector Ding!"

He stumbled back to his seat, looking dazed. No one dared approach him. Ding Weizeng nodded, the radiance of his immortal foundation faded, and his armor dissolved back into a simple Daoist robe as he silently retreated to a corner of the hall.

Li Xixuan, who had collapsed weakly to the floor, now became the focus of all attention. Mortified, he struggled back to a formal kneeling position, remaining silent.

The hall felt as if a violent storm had just passed, shattering the tense, aggressive atmosphere. Li Zhouluo kept his gaze lowered to the letter, but through the slit between his fingers, he watched the stunned Li Zhouming return to his seat. It was the same powdered, painted face as always, but Li Zhouluo felt his own eyes begin to sting.

'Good Fifth Brother...'

He had no time to dwell on it. A soft *thud* echoed in the hall.

Li Chenghao had dropped to his knees. He was one of the last remaining cultivators of the Chengming generation. His eyes were red-rimmed as he spoke, his voice heavy. "Chengpan is the youngest of his brothers. From the day he was brought from the lake periphery to the inner territories, I have guided him. The boy has been diligent since childhood, earning praise wherever he went. He served on the West Bank for years without a single complaint. Now, he suffers this sudden slander. If we cannot clear his name, where is the justice in this clan? Patriarch, I only ask that you summon our elder brother. If Chengpan is found to have the slightest stain on him... I am willing to share his punishment!"

His plea was heartfelt, making Li Zhouluo grip the letter tightly. He closed his eyes, his resolve wavering. He knew the truth: his father, Li Chenghuai, wasn't seriously injured. He *could* leave seclusion...

At that moment, Li Xuanxuan, who had sat motionless watching the entire drama unfold, finally spoke. The old man’s voice was dry and aged. "Li Chenghuai is in seclusion. He is not to be disturbed."

The old patriarch's single sentence silenced the hall. The petitioning elders froze. Li Zhouluo thought he heard a muffled sob. It seemed Li Chengpan, still kneeling in the center, had finally broken. The young man kept his head bowed, but his shoulders began to tremble.

The sound of weeping hammered at Li Zhouluo’s conscience, leaving him confused and conflicted. The letter in his hand suddenly felt impossibly heavy. "Regarding the West Bank," he announced, his voice low, "the Jade Court and Mount Qingdu will both dispatch personnel to investigate. Chen Donghe and Li Wen are ordered to the West Bank. Both peaks will conduct a joint interrogation. A final judgment will be rendered after."

"The situation remains unclear, but the families of the West Bank are in turmoil and require an answer. Ren Ting is stripped of his duties, effective immediately, and will be imprisoned in the dungeons of Mount Qingdu. Li Chengpan is guilty of negligent oversight; he will be returned to the main isle for interrogation."

Li Xuanxuan had blocked the path to summoning Li Chenghuai, and Li Zhouming had thrown the hall into chaos. Li Chenghao and Li Xixuan could only remain silent. They watched as Li Zhouluo folded the letter and declared calmly, "Li Hun accepted bribes and has confessed. Execute him."

Li Hun’s head snapped up, his face a mask of terror. Before he could scream, guards seized him. Li Zhouluo watched the man being dragged limply from the hall. "I apologize for troubling you elders today," he said. "Within ten days, this matter will have a definitive conclusion. I will inform you all then."

He could no longer bear the atmosphere. Rising quickly from the main seat, he bowed deeply to Li Xuanxuan and walked out without a backward glance. No one else moved; they avoided looking at Li Zhouming. Only after the wastrel finally left, taking Li Chengzhi with him, did half the assembly begin to disperse.

Li Chenghao, his expression grave, hurried after the escort taking Li Chengpan back to the main isle. Only outside the hall did he encounter the belated arrivals—the eldest and second brothers of the Zhou generation. He gave them a cold, silent stare. Embarrassed, the brothers explained softly, "Uncle... just now, we were summoned away by sister Xinghan..."

Li Chenghao was no fool; he understood their excuse perfectly. He suppressed his fury and stalked away, leaving the utterly humiliated Li Xixuan behind. As Li Xixuan turned to leave, a middle-aged man blocked his path.

This was Li Shuya, the brother of Li Que'wan. After losing his ship on the lake, he had remained by Li Xuanxuan’s side—a blessing in disguise. He bowed deeply. "My lord. The Old Master requests your presence."

Li Xixuan looked uncomfortable but followed Li Shuya to a side peak. He entered a small, immaculate courtyard where Li Xuanxuan was calmly preparing tea at a square table. Seeing the old master's peaceful expression, Li Xixuan relaxed slightly. He moved forward and knelt respectfully. "Grandfather."

The tea in Li Xuanxuan’s cup was scalding, hissing white steam. He set the cup down, raised one wrinkled hand, and carefully rolled back the sleeve on his other arm. He reached forward and slapped Li Xixuan hard across the face.

*Smack!*

The blow wasn't heavy, but it was shockingly loud. The pale, plump man instantly broke into a cold sweat. He dropped forward, pressing himself to the ground at the old master’s feet, not daring to utter a sound.



# Chapter 791: The Sacred Writ Gate

Li Xuanxuan retracted his hand, leaving the pale-skinned man prostrate on the ground, afraid to rise. Only then did the old man’s fury become apparent. He ignored the tea, letting it sit untouched on the table, and spoke in a rasping voice:

"This incident... exactly how much was Li Chenghao involved?"

Li Xixuan remained pressed to the floor, kneeling obediently. "Grandfather... why would you say such a thing?" he whispered.

Li Xuanxuan gave him a dark look. "I know. Li Chenghuai's 'divine insight' implicated a crowd of people. None of you have had a moment’s peace since, and worse, it terrified the external clans and minor sects. That is why I persuaded him to withdraw. Now Li Chenghuai is in seclusion, yet you demand his return. Did you prepare some new shamanic trick to test him? Or devise some convoluted ploy to bypass his judgment? All while ensuring Zhouluo suffers a catastrophic loss of prestige... Is *this* how you conduct yourself as an elder?"

Li Xixuan whispered, "It was only for the sake of Chengpan’s good name."

Li Xuanxuan laughed, a sound devoid of humor. His eyes flashed, his aura suddenly turning vicious. "I don’t care what schemes you plotted. The investigation would inevitably conclude that only Li Hun was guilty of a capital crime. A perfect scapegoat! Li Chenghuai may not dare investigate you personally, but do you think *I* don't? There is no one else here. I will summon Li Chenghuai this instant."

Li Xixuan broke. He shuffled forward an inch, tears streaming down his face as he choked out his words. "Grandson just feels the clan is too cruel! Zhouluo, Xinghan, and you, Old Master, you live comfortably on the main isle, but have you ever once considered what life is like for the other bloodlines?

"The direct-line mortals of other immortal clans live as local emperors, or at the very least enjoy boundless wealth and servants. But our family! Our proud direct bloodline! The moment my children were found to lack spiritual apertures, they were relegated to farming! Mount Qingdu provides just enough food to survive, while every other aspect of their lives is monitored with demonic scrutiny, endlessly harsh. If *my* children are treated thus, what about the others? Our clan boasts a century of glory, but how many direct-line tears are shed in the shadows?"

"Those with outside surnames face no scrutiny from Mount Qingdu; they live quite comfortably. Meanwhile, the number of clan members with cultivation bases grows, both on the isle and off, yet our unity fractures day by day. Have you ever wondered why? Chengpan is one of the loyal ones. Old Master, do you want to see how much attachment those brought in from the periphery truly feel for this clan? Before they awakened their talent, you demanded they eat chaff and wild vegetables. Now that they have spiritual apertures, you demand they dedicate their lives to the lake and the common folk. How can the world be so convenient!"

"I watched this, and my heart ached. I did what I could, privately looking after the younger generations. Then Li Chenghuai took charge of Mount Qingdu. He was so incorruptible. He arrested several clan elders, and all avenues of support were severed. The lake was 'cleansed.' But do you know, Old Master, how many people wept beneath that cleansing? We are all of the Moongaze bloodline! The main isle acts with such heartless indifference!"

He slammed his head against the floor. *Thud, thud, thud.* "I am an old man with few days left!" he wept. "Grandson *is* selfish! I want my sons to live a decent life! But I also cannot bear to watch our clan tear itself apart, growing more alienated by the day. Of the younger generation, Zhoufang and Zhouyang see it most clearly. They have constantly fought to secure shelter and privilege for the children of the elders, only to be repeatedly rejected by Mount Qingdu. If this continues... the clan faces certain disaster!"

Li Xuanxuan’s breathing grew ragged. "What?" he snapped. "You want our family to implement a caste system? You want everyone named Li to be a first-class citizen, enjoying wealth from birth until death? When other families decline, they can till the fields, but someone named Li is forbidden?"

Li Xixuan prostrated himself again, weeping bitterly. "Old Master... the Azure Pond Sect belongs first and foremost to the Chi and Si clans. The Purple Smoke Gate belongs first to the Kan and Wen! Even Myriad Radiance belongs first to the Cheng! Old Master, the world *is* built on ranks! The first class belongs to high cultivators and their descendants! It is common talk that sects are rife with power struggles, yet they *still* have a first class sitting at the top. Our family carries the name Li! Why are *we* forbidden from being first class?"

Li Xuanxuan’s face flushed crimson with rage. He shot up from his seat, drew back his foot, and kicked Li Xixuan squarely in the head, sending the man rolling several meters. "You..." the old man roared. "You read all those books on Mount Qingdu for nothing!"

Li Xixuan’s pale face streamed with blood. "It is *because* I read those books!" he screamed. "Old Master! This affair was only meant to prove that even divine insight can be flawed! It was to free those clan elders and rally our family’s spirit! Li Chenghao didn't know the full plot... I know he only joined because he pitied Chengpan and I dragged him in, but he understood the stakes and he helped me! His daughter Xingsai just died... and Li Chenghao, her father, did not utter a single word of complaint! Yet now, even *he* stepped forward to help me! This shows where the hearts of the clan truly lie! It was Xie and Li Chengzhi who treasured their reputations and retreated! Old Master, can you still tell loyalty from treason?"

Li Xuanxuan, burning with fury, descended into a coughing fit. The violent sound terrified Li Xixuan, who swallowed the remainder of his defense. The old man violently flung his sleeve. "Get out!" he snarled, teeth gritted. "Get! Out!"

Li Xixuan kowtowed three times and retreated, looking utterly broken. Li Xuanxuan coughed violently for some time before sinking back into his seat. Li Shuya, eyes red with alarm, nervously brought him the tea.

He remained seated late into the night. Finally, he retrieved a wooden box from the courtyard, took out a jade slip, and rubbed it thoughtfully. It contained the writings of Li Tongya. He reviewed the contents again and again, remaining silent in the darkness.

***

Moongaze Lake.

Li Zhouluo returned to the lake and interrogated the West Bank families through the night. As expected, the evidence still pointed back to Li Hun and Ren Ting. Whoever gave the orders from above remained unknown, but all the actual crimes had been executed by Li Hun. Li Hun had been sentenced to death and was still being held in the main hall.

The interrogation revealed that all four petitioners believed they were genuinely committing crimes. Ren Ting hadn't even realized he was being bribed; in his memory, the He woman didn't even have the surname He. Li Hun, meanwhile, despite sensing something was amiss, directed all blame toward An Xuanxin.

'If Father used his art, the results would show the four petitioners as innocent and the West Bank families as guilty. But if I investigate closely, the West Bank families are also innocent... The intermediaries are either dead or have fled.'

He faintly sensed the outline of a conspiracy. Just as he was drowning in work, Li Zhoufang entered the hall and bowed respectfully. His eldest brother already wore a long beard, looking thoroughly middle-aged. Li Zhouluo quickly set his work aside. "Thank you, Elder Brother."

Li Zhoufang looked exhausted. He shook his head slowly. "This incident left Uncle Cheng humiliated. I could not sit by; I refuse to bear the reputation of an unfilial nephew. I came seeking the Patriarch for a reason... My uncle's daughter, our sister Xingsai, who perished... she left a child behind..."

Li Zhouluo’s grip tightened on his brush; he knew exactly what the next sentence would be. He was saved by the sound of urgent footsteps. A Jade Court Guard hurried in. "Patriarch! An urgent report from the wilderness! Lord Cui has arrived on the isle with the Kong family!"

Li Zhoufang was meticulous about protocol, and matters of familial privilege could always wait. He shook out his sleeves and immediately took his leave. Li Zhouluo, granted a moment's reprieve, felt his anxiety about the East sharpen. "Send them in!"

Cui Jueyin strode in, clad in Daoist robes. He and Ding Weizeng were now ranked as the Li family's two greatest combat strengths and were highly respected. Li Zhouluo descended from his seat to meet him. Cui Jueyin bowed and spoke concisely:

"Reporting to the Patriarch: the reason for the Capital immortals retreat has been confirmed. An overseas Dao lineage, the Xuanquan Great Dao of the Matron, emerged from the river, invaded Shanji Prefecture, and forced the White Ye Immortal Sect to flee. They have occupied the Profound Peak Gate!"

"Daoist Master Zhu Gong of that lineage has established a new sect in the mountains, claiming to be the inheritor of the Tongxuan Dao lineage. They established a branch called the Xuanmu Divine Writ Dao, or the 'Sacred Writ Gate' for short. Under the banner of 'aiding the weak and distressed,' they are integrating the Profound Peak Gate, which they also claim as part of the Tongxuan lineage. They have renamed the mountain Mount Muquan and formally declared their dominion!"

Li Zhouluo was deeply shaken. Cui Jueyin continued, "Three months from now, Daoist Master Zhu Gong will host a banquet on Mount Muquan for all cultivators. We have heard that cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate ascended the mountain just today. Even Daoist Master Tinglan of the Purple Smoke blessed land went personally."

Unlike Li Zhouluo, Cui Jueyin was not entirely surprised. He had, after all, accompanied Li Ximing to the Purple Smoke Gate and had gathered several oblique hints during his long conversations with their cultivators.

Li Zhouluo absorbed the report. "How did the Kong family react?"

The Sacred Writ Gate was claiming the legacy of the Profound Peak Gate under the guise of "aiding the distressed." This instantly turned the Kong family's marginalized status into a sensitive political crisis. Li Zhouluo had seized upon the crucial question, and Cui Jueyin had clearly anticipated it.

"Most of the Kong family members are confused and distraught. Two of their juniors tried to gather information about the Sacred Writ Gate but were severely reprimanded by Kong Guxi. As of now, the Profound Peak survivors have shown no intention of contacting the Sacred Writ Gate, and the Sacred Writ Gate has made no attempt to contact them."

Li Zhouluo breathed a sigh of relief, grateful his own position hadn't yet become awkward. Just then, Chen Yang rushed in. "Patriarch! An envoy from the Sacred Writ Gate has arrived on the isle! He claims he is here to deliver an invitation!"

This news signaled a friendly attitude from the new sect. Li Zhouluo brightened. "Bring him in immediately!"

A young man in ornate gold and azure robes entered the hall. He had fair skin, a wide smile, and was followed by a figure in plain robes and a wide bamboo hat that obscured his face. The young man bowed. "Dai Jinquan of the Xuanmu Divine Writ Dao greets the Patriarch. With joyous events approaching, we congratulate the immortal clan on its evergreen prosperity, enduring for countless generations..."

He rattled off a long string of pleasantries. Li Zhouluo forced a smile in return. "We have often heard of your immortal Dao's great name. To relocate within the seas and acquire such a treasured land is truly a joyous occasion..."

The Li family was, after all, harboring the Kong clan. The Sacred Writ Gate's occupation of their mountain was an awkward topic. Hearing Li Zhouluo’s neutral response, Dai Jinquan’s smile widened. He retrieved a gold-and-azure invitation from his sleeve. "I trust your noble clan has heard. Three months from now, our Daoist Master will host a banquet on Mount Muquan for all cultivators. We sincerely hope the immortal clan will grace us with its presence..."

His purpose achieved, Dai Jinquan offered one more platitude and fell silent. The man in the bamboo hat stepped forward and removed it, revealing an energetic, familiar face.

It was Wen Wu of the Purple Smoke Gate!

Wen Wu produced a purple-gold token. "I am Wen Wu of the Purple Smoke Gate," he said solemnly. "We have met before, Patriarch. I have taken advantage of the Sacred Writ Gate's journey to deliver a message from my Daoist Master."

At these words, Cui Jueyin immediately activated an ocular art to verify him. Wen Wu presented the token, and a plume of purple smoke—a divine ability—streamed from it, coalescing in the center of the hall. Everyone started in alarm, and Li Zhouluo quickly descended from his seat to bow.

The smoke solidified into the image of Daoist Master Tinglan. She scanned the hall, and upon recognizing Cui Jueyin, she raised an eyebrow. "Jueyin. Your Daoist Master Zhaojing already made the arrangements; he discussed this with me at Purple Smoke. The Profound Peak Dao lineage belongs to the Sacred Writ Gate. Out of consideration for Moongaze's reputation, Zhu Gong will not make the first move. Your family should handle the arrangements quickly. It will look better for both sides."

Cui Jueyin bowed respectfully. The apparition vanished. Dai Jinquan and Wen Wu, still kneeling, completed their farewell salutes. Only then did everyone else rise. Wen Wu replaced his hat, and the two envoys departed without another word.

Li Zhouluo had Chen Yang personally escort them out. He released a quiet breath of tension. "Send the Profound Peak contingent up."

'Profound Peak is also part of the Tongxuan lineage? It's not impossible...'

There was already one Tongxuan lineage in Jiangbei: the Xuanmiao Temple, entrusted to them by Changxi. Sumian had always claimed descent from the Tongxuan lineage's Xu Xiang. Li Zhouluo began to ponder.

'Xuanmiao Temple starts with *Xuan*. Profound Peak Gate (*Xuanyue*) starts with *Xuan*. The Sacred Writ Gate's full name is the *Xuanmu* Divine Writ Dao... it also starts with *Xuan*.'

While he was lost in thought, Kong Guxi hurried into the hall. The sect master looked distraught, his face streaked with tears. He bowed deeply. "Patriarch... our ancestral mountain has been *stolen* by the Sacred Writ Gate..."

He used the word "stolen" to make his position clear. Li Zhouluo, hiding his own suspicions, adopted an expression of shared grief and indignation. "Sect Master Kong, I heard the Sacred Writ Gate claims your sect is part of the Tongxuan Dao lineage... How is it we have never heard you mention this?"

At this question, Kong Guxi’s expression filled with resentment and sorrow. "Patriarch," he bowed, "the Tongxuan Dao lineage is an ancient one, and it is indeed connected to our own Fool's Mountain Chase technique. When our founder established the sect, he registered our lineage under the Tongxuan banner, calling ourselves the 'Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains.' But... because our inheritance was incomplete, we could not even name our specific progenitor. We were never recognized by the main lineage. Eventually... we stopped using the title."

"While our Founder was alive, he worked day and night seeking recognition for that title, but it came to nothing. And now... now that it has come to this... purely so they can annex us, *now* they suddenly recognize the connection!"

Li Zhouluo nodded gravely. He stepped forward and solemnly helped Kong Guxi to his feet. "Sect Master Kong, we have discussed this matter thoroughly. Although the Capital immortals sect has retreated, there is no guarantee they will not strike south again. Our own Daoist Master is absent, and the wilderness is fraught with peril. I fear... I fear we can no longer guarantee your sect's safety."

"As it stands, the Sacred Writ Gate has driven off the White Ye Immortal Sect, and Daoist Master Zhu Gong is protecting the Profound Peak disciples. We hear they are searching throughout Shanji Prefecture to gather all the survivors. Sect Master, perhaps you should take your people there. You will be safe from the White Ye Immortal Sect's assassins, and you can preserve your Dao lineage!"

Kong Guxi’s heart turned to ice.

From the moment the Sacred Writ Gate announced they were "aiding the distressed," his hopes of rebuilding his sect had turned to ash. The Sacred Writ Gate was already "saving" and "merging" the Profound Peak lineage. If another Profound Peak Gate suddenly appeared in the west, how would that be interpreted?

The sect master had only hesitated to leave the Li family's protection because the time was not right, not because he intended to abandon his lineage. It was impossible for him not to despise the Sacred Writ Gate, a fact his earlier outburst had made perfectly clear.

But Li Zhouluo's meaning was undeniable. The great tide of events was moving, and it was not something the Kong clan—or even the Moongaze Li clan—could stop. Kong Guxi went limp, collapsing back to his knees in a stupor. "Pa... Patriarch..."



# Chapter 792: The End of the Line

Li Zhouluo remained silent, watching the Sect Master Kong collapse to the floor. Dili Guang, seeing this, shut the great hall's doors tight. The hall first fell into dimness before the lamps within flickered to life. Kong Guxi muttered, "Clan Head... Clan Head... Daoist Master... Daoist Master, he! I... *Ai*!"

This was, after all, a monumental event, so Li Zhouluo did not press him. He stood for a while, waiting until Kong Guxi finally seemed to regain some clarity. The old man brushed at his own hair, which had turned stark white in just a few short years, and bowed.

"The Ancestor is dead, and the Profound Peak Gate has crumbled. For years... one refused aid, another watched with folded arms. We were fortunate to receive the help of the Immortal Clan, allowing a few juniors in the clan to survive. This kindness... this old man has etched it into his heart. The entire Kong Clan has etched it into their hearts...

"Now, the clouds have parted to reveal the moon. The Tongxuan Dao lineage has come to our rescue, delivering us from the sea of suffering and allowing us to return to our mountain gate. However, our Dao lineage ends here. From this day forward, there is only the Kong Clan. There is no more Profound Peak."

"Senior Kong Tingyun is still out there... Rest easy, esteemed elder..."

Li Zhouluo offered a few words of comfort. Kong Guxi listened respectfully before replying, "Since the Profound Peak Dao lineage ends here, there is no longer any talk of Daoist scriptures. I have already brought the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* of the Fool's Mountain Chase. Please... Moongaze... accept it!"

He retrieved a jade-yellow slip from his sleeve, knelt with a thud, and offered it up with both hands clasping either end. Li Zhouluo rushed to help him up, but his cultivation was far inferior to the other man's; naturally, he couldn't lift him.

Kong Guxi choked back a sob. "Since we are going to the Sacred Writ Gate , the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* must be returned to the Xuanmu Divine Writ Dao lineage, returned to the sect. In the future, my descendants will have meager fortunes and shallow fates. We may not be able to continue cultivating the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains... Please, Moongaze, keep a copy!"

He snapped his head up, his eyes bulging wide. His already gaunt face looked doubly aged beneath that intense stare. He stared deeply at Li Zhouluo, clutching his sleeve tightly, and moaned incoherently, "Leaving it with your esteemed clan is good... leaving it here is good. This is a fine cultivation method, one with a long history. Fifty years... a hundred years from now, they can take a look, yes...?"

The sentence was disjointed, the "they can take a look" seemingly referring to the Li family. But his eyes, bulging as if they might fly from their sockets, and his pleading gaze had their intended effect. Understanding struck Li Zhouluo like lightning.

'Returning the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* to the Xuanmu Dao lineage is a certainty. They will surely have methods to sever the inheritance. Whether the Kong family can borrow it to practice in the future... remains unknown...

'He is leaving a copy of the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* at Moongaze Lake, waiting. Fifty or a hundred years from now, when the Sacred Writ Gate lowers its guard, someone from his Kong clan might have the chance to come and view it. They will not have their Dao path completely severed, left with no chance to ever rise again!'

He placed his hand over the old man's. In a voice that was both soothing and deliberately ambiguous, he said, "The Daoist Master is concerned... Why stop at only a hundred years?"

The words worked. Kong Guxi pressed the jade slip into his hands, whispering, "The *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* is here... it's just a Purple Mansion Dao lineage, nothing more. My gratitude is endless. This is just a small token..."

His face was a deathly white as he remained kneeling, trembling as if having just survived a terrible danger. He quickly took his leave. The *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* felt heavy in Li Zhouluo's sleeve, compelling him to hurry back to the main seat.

He inspected it with his spiritual sense. It was indeed the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra*. Not only that, it also contained *Viewing the Pavilion Terrace, Forged in Fire* and another manual, *The Art of Wondrous Earth and Moving Treasured Mountains*, which detailed the art of shifting and moving mountains.

Li Zhouluo placed the jade slip quietly on the table. The image of Kong Guxi's eyes still lingered in his mind. After witnessing the plight of the Profound Peak Sect Master, he suddenly felt his own situation wasn't so troublesome. He gave an order:

"Ask Protector Cui to make a trip... personally escort the members of Profound Peak back to their mountain gate. Ensure all courtesies are perfectly observed. We must not allow others to misunderstand."

Dili Guang immediately departed. A woman in white robes, carrying a sword, entered the hall and waited below. Li Zhouluo dismissed the contingent of the Jade Court Guard, then lowered his voice. "Xinghan..."

Li Xinghan hadn't been able to attend the meeting in Qingdu Hall, but as the current eldest sister of the First branch, she knew a great deal. Her expression was grim. She stepped forward and cupped her hands. "Those elders are all too accustomed to using public office for private gain. They have made things difficult for you, brother."

Li Zhouluo gave a dry laugh. "Right now, I'm thinking about Xingsai. Zhoufang and the others still feel it isn't enough. They don't just want compensation; they want shelter..."

He explained the lengthy affairhow to provide these people with care without breeding new problems. Every detail had to be calculated. Li Xinghan listened, sighing inwardly.

Putting herself in his shoes, given Li Zhouluo's family status and background, he lacked neither resources nor Dharma Artifacts. He had only taken the position of Clan Head because there was truly no one else left...

Li Xinghan also knew clearly that Li Zhouluo, representing the Fourth branch, was the sole heir, and his maternal clan influence here was weak. With Li Chenghuai in seclusion, one could even say Li Zhouluo *was* the Fourth branch. He lacked the natural support of elders and core pillars that the First and Second branches possessed when they held power. He was inherently at a disadvantage.

Seeing him in such a difficult position, she could only listen quietly. Li Zhouluo finished his tirade, paused, and asked, "How is Fifth Brother now?"

At the mention of Li Zhouming, a hint of a smile touched Li Xinghans lips. "I just came from his place. Didn't you give him that White Falcon Gold? He came down from Mount Qingdu and didn't even change his clothes, just rushed back to forge hairpins. Who knows which songstress he's trying to please this time..."

Their opinion of Li Zhouming had clearly changed. Normally, such words would carry a tone of helpless exasperation, but now they held more amusement. Li Zhouluo shook his head. "Elder Chen will meticulously note this down against him again. Ive only just realized that hes the one who truly sees things clearly. Anyone else in the clan gets a demerit recorded at Qingdu and they look like theyre attending a funeral. Only himhe gets noted down, gets punished, and makes the exact same mistake next time."

They both chuckled. Li Xinghan replied, "I need to set off again soon to enter the mountains and train my sword. But before I leave, I'll see Uncle Cheng and have a good talk with him."

Li Zhouluo nodded repeatedly. "Cheng" was Li Xinghan's direct uncle; her words carried immense weight. He said quickly, "Thank you, sister!"

Li Xinghan cradled her sword and departed briskly. Li Zhouluo busied himself in the hall. Only half a quarter-hour passed before Chen Yang entered unexpectedly. The man bowed and said respectfully, "Clan Head, wonderful news! Wang Quwan has successfully broken through and forged the Floating Cloud Body!"

Li Zhouluo's eyes lit up. He strode quickly out of the hall and looked up. Sure enough, floating clouds obscured the sun in the north. He asked, "Excellent! The Essence Gathering Pill the Daoist Master gave him was not wasted. He truly did not disappoint. Where is he?"

Chen Yang replied, "Judging by the celestial phenomenon, he has just broken through. He is almost certainly on his way to pay respects! His seclusion spot isn't far from here. The floating cloud has been rising for some time. I reckon he'll arrive at any moment."

"Good!"

Wang Quwan was not just anyone. For one, the man represented the clans of Jiangbei. The Wang Clan had mobilized their entire clan to help the Li family defend Jiangbei. Furthermore, he had been personally promoted by Li Ximing. His significance was extraordinary.

Moreover, Wang Quwan's sword Dao cultivation was not weak, and he had long held a reputation. That Floating Cloud Body was no simple lineage; it represented an immortal foundation of the Body Divine Ability, and it was highly compatible with artifact refinement. This man's future was truly bright.

Li Zhouluo hurried back to the main seat, pulled out a jade slip from the side, glanced at it, and said, "I hear he is also a sword cultivator. It is only right to reward him with a Dharma sword. Protector Chen, what artifact does he currently use?"

Chen Yang replied, "I am told it is a common, low-grade Qi Refining item."

Li Zhouluo nodded immediately. "A Foundation Establishment artifact cannot be bestowed lightly, but a peak-grade Qi Refining Dharma sword possesses both value and significance... Let me check the treasury... There is still one peak-grade Qi Refining Dharma sword, obtained during the North-South conflict. Quickly, bring it for inspection."

Wang Quwan would certainly come to pay respects immediately. Dili Guang understood time was tight and hurried off. Chen Yang said, "Clan Head, I will go outside the island to greet him!"

Li Zhouluo watched him go, feeling a quiet sense of relief. He waited only a moment before a man stepped forward to pay respects. This man had average features, trod upon clouds, and carried a sword on his back. His gaze was resolute, his steps steady. He bowed. "Wang Quwan of Jiangbei greets the Clan Head!"

The man was unremarkable in appearance, yet held quite the reputation. Li Zhouluo smiled and helped him up. "Congratulations, Quwan! It is truly not easy for Jiangbei to produce a sword cultivator such as you."

Dili Guang returned at the perfect moment, holding a jade box. Li Zhouluo took it with one hand and opened it. Inside lay a longsword. The blade shimmered with intersecting gold and blue light, emanating a pure aura. One glance confirmed it was of the highest grade.

Li Zhouluo smiled. "This sword is three chi, one cun, and two fen long. It weighs fifty-two jin and one liang. Its base is Jinghai Cold Iron, forged with Golden Essence from the bottom of the Great River. Its color resembles the waters of Jinghai, and its patterns depict the Golden Beast of the Clear River. Its name is..."

This sword had been seized as spoils. Although the materials were discernible, no name was engraved on the blade. Li Zhouluo paused slightly, then bestowed a name ripe with meaning.

"Jingxi Qing!"

Wang Quwan was a sword cultivator; no sword cultivator dislikes Dharma swords. The "Jingxi Qing," as a peak-grade Qi Refining weapon, was even higher quality than Li Xinghan's previous Northern Jade. Although Wang Quwan was now the head of the Jiangbei clans, he had relied on his Wang surname and his own two hands to fight for his position; he did not come from a prominent background. He immediately bowed. "Clan Head! This is too precious!"

Li Zhouluo shook his head. "Your family exerted great effort defending Jiangbei. This is a reward you deserve. From now on, it also represents the status of your Jiangbei Wang Clan at Baijiang Creek. How can we speak of its value? If we must speak of value, this sword is worth less than that Essence Gathering Pill."

Since Li Zhouluo insisted, Wang Quwan could only accept the jade box with both hands. His gaze toward the Dharma sword was filled with an undisguisable affection. He clutched it to his chest as if it were a priceless treasure, thanking him repeatedly.

Li Zhouluo knew this man's reputation; he was definitely reliable and capable. That he had emerged from seclusion and immediately received a sword personally bestowed by Li Zhouluo was deeply significant. This solved an urgent problem for Li Zhouluo. He wasn't in a rush to put the man to work, simply asking smilingly about matters in Jiangbei.

After inquiring for a time, Li Zhouluo learned that Wang Quwan's elder brotherthat Alchemist of the Wang Clanhad gone missing on an outing years ago and hadn't been heard from since. The one managing the family at home was his younger brother, Wang Quyu. Li Zhouluo had heard of this man; he too was talented, and though his aptitude was inferior to Wang Quwan's, his methods were formidable.

He studied Wang Quwan's expression and asked, "How... is your sword Dao cultivation? With your sword qi already formed, sword essence should not be far off, yes?"

This was, naturally, flattery. Sword essence was exceptionally difficult to achieve. As expected, Wang Quwan shook his head. "Sword essence is nowhere in sight; I hit a bottleneck long ago. I am merely hoping to borrow and read the sword Dao scriptures from around the lake, hoping they resonate with the sword Dao of Jiangbei, and see if I can walk my own path."

According to custom, Wang Quwan still needed to pay respects to Li Xuanxuan, Ding Weizeng, and the others. Li Zhouluo let him go, his mood greatly improved. He ordered the small windows on both sides of the main hall opened. The hall brightened instantly, morning light spilling inside, illuminating the tabletop in brilliant light.

The dawn light climbed the jade racks, flowed over the glistening scales of the Coiling Dragon Pillar near the table, and reflected onto the main seat. It passed over Li Zhouluo, casting faint, shimmering scale patterns across the far wall.

***

After Kong Guxi left the hall, he returned to the island, lost and desolate. His elder brother, Kong Guli, was waiting below, looking preoccupied. When he saw Kong Guxi's expression, the old man already anticipated the answer and covered his face in silence.

Kong Guxi didn't say an extra word. He took a few steps, only to see Fu Yuezi approach and bow respectfully. "Gate Master."

Hearing this title, Kong Guxi felt a hundred conflicting flavors well up in his heart. He was about to speak when he noticed a vast swathe of floating clouds surging on the northern horizon. They were white and misty, reaching straight to the heavens, blotting out the sun.

"Someone else has reached Foundation Establishment."

He shrank into himself, forgetting even to close the courtyard gate, simply watching Kong Guli and Fu Yuezi pack their things... In truth, there was nothing to pack. They were merely waiting for the Li family to escort them. To avoid looking like they were just sitting and waiting for their fate, the old men kept themselves busy with pointless tasks.

After about fifteen minutes, the sound of urgent footsteps and horse hoofs suddenly echoed from the streets and alleys, followed by the sharp, crackling explosion of firecrackers. Several people were shouting in the alleys:

"Great joyous news! Great news! Lord Wang Quwan of the Jiangbei Wang Clan has forged an immortal foundation! Great news... great news! Come and share in the good fortune, collect your rewards and gifts... Come, come..."

One auspicious shout followed another. The two Profound Peak disciples guarding the gate also received immortal rewards and joined the congratulations, starting to laugh. For them, joining the Sacred Writ Gate and ending their lives of wandering and dependency was naturally a good thing. They hadn't thought too deeply about it. Now, they too were cheerful, and the courtyard was filled with thunderous, joyous laughter.

The laughter rang out for a long time before a clear voice finally intervened. "Everyone disperse. The honored guests are resting inside. It is not good to be so rowdy."

It was Cui Jueyin's voice. He always spoke gently, and he understood that Kong Guxi inside was not feeling well. A trace of pity moved him to disperse the crowd. The people finally scattered.

The sounds of joy and laughter faded as they spread out in all directions. Cui Jueyin raised his eyebrows slightly, catching the sound of heavy, suppressed crying from the courtyard. He could faintly make out choked sobs:

"Gate Master... Gate Master!"

"Fu Yuezi... go join the Li family... Go and join the Li family! In any case... in the end, following me to the east will just be more suffering..."

"Gate Master! What are you saying..."

"Brother... rising and falling, such is the way of the world. Outside, the gongs and drums celebrate; inside, we grieve our end. A twenty-year-old minor branch is just beginning its rise; a three-hundred-year-old immortal clan is reaching its demise. Our luck has run out! Our fate has reached its end... Let us go to the east!"

# Chapter 793: The Three Profundities

Sea's Cape.

The coral cave was brilliantly lit. Seawater churned, rolling up plumes of fine white sand that flowed from the cave like a waterfall, drifting and settling in layers on the seafloor. A large school of white shellfish shuttled through the sand, stirring dazzling reflections in the water.

The Daoist in white-gold robes sat with his hands on his knees. With every breath, roiling spiritual qi of the Bright Yang surged, and faint, violet flames intermittently flew out to circle beside him.

Li Ximing had refined three Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pills in succession, suppressing and grinding away more than half of the flames raging within his Juque Palace. His situation immediately improved.

He still possessed a good number of spiritual items and treasure medicines, and even more spiritual water. Applying the right remedy, he used the "White Waterfall Cold Water" he had received at the Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly, along with his own clan's "Taiyun Flower," to refine a cauldron of pills. He swallowed them all in one go. The scorched, glazed color on his Dharma body slowly returned to normal.

More than a year passed in a flash. Estimating that sixty to seventy percent of his injuries had recovered, and that Qingxu Temple had likely gathered most of what he needed, Li Ximing finally opened his eyes. A flash of light filled the cave. He took out the jade pendant from his sleeve and checked it; nothing major had happened at home.

"This single jade pendant, nourished and enhanced by my divine ability, was secretly given to Grandfather. It has not yet been crushed... meaning the clan has not yet faced a crisis of survival."

He casually collected the array plate in the cave and passed outside. Li Ximing found that the seawater was still azure, but the seabed was completely different. As far as the eye could see, it was covered in fine white sand. He could faintly see several Embyronic Breathing realm white shellfish busily working the sea floor.

"Curious..."

Li Ximing understood with a single glance. He was clueless about formations and couldn't seal his divine abilities. A Bright Yang Purple Mansion cultivator practicing here had instantly altered the spiritual mechanics of the location. The coral cave should have spewed out Radiant Sky Stone day and night, but the spiritual mechanics at Sea's Cape were insufficient, causing it to spew only layers of white sand.

Even so, it had been enough to make passing demonic beasts stay and settle. Seeing this, it looked like it was about to become a small spiritual land. Li Ximing scanned the area. There were one or two traces of excavation nearby; he didn't know if it was Qingxu Temple or some other group that had come to harvest.

'It's not easy... In Jiangnan, Radiant Sky Stone is used to construct palaces... the bigger the block, the better... This is the first time I've seen anyone collect it as spiritual sand.'

Since fate had brought it about, and there was a rare stretch of vibrant life beneath his feet, Li Ximing simply stretched out his hand, brought two fingers to his lips, and spat out a mouthful of Bright Yang Purple Fire.

The purple fire hovered before him. Li Ximing then took out a jade pot. It was merely a Qi Refining item, kept purely for drinking tea. He formed a seal and cast an art, using his divine ability to leave behind three to five strands of inheritance, before locking the purple fire inside.

Li Ximing's control over fire could only be described as terrifying. The jade pot immediately transformed into a violet-red color, searing hot, radiating waves of bright solar brilliance. With a casual toss, he threw it back into the cave.

The stalled waterfall of white sand began to flow once more. Li Ximing estimated that this mouthful of purple fire, slowly dissipating, could keep the process running for seventy or eighty years. Struck by inspiration, he lifted a brush and wrote:

"Valley Wind."

He flicked his sleeve, and his figure vanished. Crossing a hundred li, he reappeared above Qingxu Temple.

He saw a vast, fertile plain of wheat blowing in the wind, the monastery buildings scattered elegantly within. Only a year had passed, but Qingxu Temple was completely different. The monks in yellow robes no longer seemed to cover the mountains and fields; instead, they were dotted amongst farmers in coarse, short clothes.

He descended on his light, materializing in the highest monastery courtyard. The area seemed empty. The monks of Qingxu Temple had indeed dwindled; presumably, they had all removed their monastic robes to reclaim the wasteland.

Li Ximing sat down at the stone table in the courtyard. He was just hearing the sound of footsteps when Xia Shouyu's accusatory voice arrived first. The woman was highly displeased, snapping, "It's just one pill recipe! It's been half a month and you still haven't gotten it?! How much skill do those people even have that you're finding it so difficult?"

"Shouyu... even the cleverest housewife can't cook without rice. Without resources... what are we supposed to exchange?"

This was followed by a clamor; clearly, many people had arrived. Xia Shouyu dealt with them, annoyed, and sneered, "No resources? You think I can't see through your petty schemes? You're just after those few pills the Daoist Master gave me. I'd dare to give them... but would you little nobodies dare to accept?"

The men following her were clearly all from the Xia family. Their expressions varied. The leader glared, wanting to curse her, but swallowed his words out of fear. He retorted, "Your words are meaningless. We don't even know when the Daoist Master will return... How can the temple have that many resources to use?"

"Pah!"

Xia Shouyu pushed the door open, but the curse on her lips died in her throat. She saw the courtyard was filled with light. The man in the white-gold Daoist robe was sitting at the stone table, holding a pill manual, reading it distractedly. The Profound Light in the center of his brow flickered, striking terror into the heart.

_Thud!_

Xia Shouyu had only managed to get half a foot into the courtyard before she dropped to her knees. The expressions of the men following her also changed drastically. One after another, they fell like rolling gourds, collapsing in a heap.

In an instant, the area outside the courtyard, inside the courtyard, and on the steps was filled with kneeling figures. One had slipped on the threshold, his rear end stuck high in the air, yet he didn't dare move. The ground was covered in figures, still as statues.

Clearly, neither the island-protecting grand array of Qingxu Temple nor the arrays within the courtyard existed for this Daoist Master. Xia Shouyu truly felt as if half her life had been scared out of her. She trembled. "The Daoist Master's immortal chariot has arrived... this lowly one failed to welcome you from afar... please forgive this offense..."

Li Ximing sat in the seat of honor. His gaze shifted from the pill manual in his hand. He gave a noncommittal nod. When dealing with these overseas cultivators, one couldn't afford to be too polite. He just raised an eyebrow. "The pill recipes."

Pill recipes!

Xia Shouyu kowtowed, immediately retrieving a jade box from her storage bag. She turned to look at the trembling crowd behind her. Every last one of them was now behaving, frantically pulling pill recipes from their sleeves and passing them to Xia Shouyu.

She shot the men a venomous glare before turning back. She presented everything respectfully in her hands—a thick stack of beast-hide scrolls piled atop the jade box. Xia Shouyu shifted an inch forward and said respectfully, "This lowly one has spent the last year sending out every cultivator from the temple, searching everywhere. Everything within sight of Sea's Cape, anything famous or rumored... we have checked it all. The harvest is right here."

Li Ximing picked them up one by one to read. No one on the ground dared to move. Soon, the old Temple Master Xia also rushed over, saw the scene, and didn't dare speak, hurriedly kneeling on the ground.

Li Ximing flipped through them. As expected, most were fabricated nonsense. Only three recipes looked reliable, all using ancient spiritual items and resources.

"One from the Azure Manifestation lineage: 'Treasured Manifestation Divine Mountain Pill,' using 'Supreme Concealed Origin' as the main ingredient. One from the Supreme Yin lineage: 'Single Qi Heart-Overwhelming Pill,' using 'Clear Yin Womb Herb' as the main ingredient. And the last one, from the Capital Guard lineage: 'Purple Water Immortal Marsh Pill,' refined using Crimson-Headed Profound Soul and 'Immortal Pure Qi'."

He had to admit, ancient cultivators were truly wealthy. Not one of the spiritual items listed here was below the Purple Mansion level. Among them, "Supreme Concealed Origin" was a supreme treasure of the Azure Manifestation lineage. Who would actually use it for alchemy?

As for the "Clear Yin Womb Herb," he had never even heard of it. "Immortal Pure Qi" was a Purple Mansion spiritual item of the Pure Qi lineage, and Crimson-Headed Profound Soul was almost certainly also a precious spiritual item of the Capital Guard lineage...

The only one Li Ximing held any hope for was the "Single Qi Heart-Overwhelming Pill." If he substituted the core ingredient with "Supreme Yin Lunar Essence," perhaps with some tinkering, it might produce some effect.

Just as he was reading the recipes, someone hurried up from below. Not daring to approach, the person only handed up a jade slip, which was passed along the line of kneeling cultivators until it reached Xia Shouyu.

Xia Shouyu recognized it at a glance: it was the very pill recipe they had just been haggling over. It had clearly been acquired long ago; they were just dragging their feet, demanding one of her pills in exchange, obviously intending to pocket it themselves.

Though furious inwardly, she could only present it respectfully. Li Ximing's eyes lit up. With a thought, the jade slip flew into his hand.

There was one reason for his interest: of all these ancient pill recipes, this was finally one recorded in a jade slip!

He scanned it. The jade slip was not newly inscribed; it looked like an original. It recorded the "Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art," a lineage of the Secret Enclosure Sect.

Although this Secret Enclosure Sect (Mìfán) sounded similar to the Secret Diffusion (Mìfàn) Monastery of Xiaoshi Mountain, this lineage was no newcomer. It already had a reputation in Jiangnan. The Secret Enclosure Sect Ruins in the Eastern Sea were famous; both Li Encheng of the Azure Pond Sect and the Chi Clan Ancestor, Chi Wei, had benefited greatly from the Water Wall Pearl found there.

But when he looked at the jade slip in his hand, suspicion immediately arose. He raised an eyebrow. "Since you bought this from someone else... shouldn't you have transcribed a copy? Why bring the original back?"

A man behind Xia Shouyu shuffled forward on his knees, trembling. "G-Great... Great Lord... that person also stole it... His alchemy skills are crude... This jade slip is mysterious and vast. Lowly cultivators like us... our heads spin just looking at it, let alone trying to copy it..."

Li Ximing narrowed his eyes. "Oh? And he was willing to sell it?"

Being questioned like this, the man was so nervous his calves cramped. He cried out, "T-Truly, Daoist Master! He already tried to refine it according to the steps. This pill art is already ineffective. That's why he sold it!"

Li Ximing slowly sat upright, solemnly immersing his spiritual sense into the slip. Sure enough, he saw the vast, ocean-like text within.

"At the dawn of heaven and earth, Yin and Yang formed first. The Heavenly Lord established his world, and the Five Virtues were thus born, bestowing the Three Profundities, which became the First Dao Archive. Around the Three Profundities, the Four Daos supported them. Below the Three Profundities, only then came the Twelve Mansions... The Secret Diffusion lineage inherits the Encompassing Profoundity..."

Sudden realization struck Li Ximing.

"The Secret Enclosure Sect is already an extremely ancient lineage, yet it's also part of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition... That is unheard of... With such a massive background as the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition, it's no wonder that just one or two opportunities from it could produce figures like Changxiao, Yehui, and Guo Shentong..."

He now valued this "Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art" even more. He began reading it on the spot. The more he read, the stranger and more regrettable it seemed. Finally, he slapped the jade slip against his hand, unsure what to say.

The "Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art" was extremely bizarre. This art didn't follow the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao path of "seeking the pill through nature"; instead, it advocated "seeking the pill through destiny." It was exceedingly complex. Li Ximing gave it a rough overview; the difficulty was extremely high.

'No wonder the Sea's Cape cultivators couldn't refine it. Even I would be extremely strained trying to refine this. Sea's Cape is filled with cultivators of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao... how could they possibly succeed? Even if they learned everything... they would end up refining their own destiny away...'

He looked at the jade slip, his mind racing.

'If that's the case... perhaps there is a reason why Guo Shentong and Changxiao were the most ruthless in their attempts to harm the one favored by fate. Those two must have obtained some technique from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition, perhaps they were also scheming for this aspect.'

'Changxiao was plotting against our clan's Scion this time, too... Unfortunately, I didn't expect him to be so decisive, so ruthless. He's the head of a Purple Mansion-level power, yet when he struck, he aimed to create a mortal enemy...'

It was a pity that he only held a pill art. He couldn't even glimpse the actual Dao lineage of the Secret Enclosure Sect, let alone the even more ancient Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. Stowing the jade slip, Li Ximing fell into thought.

"The Three Profundities. Encompassing Profoundity is already one. I wonder if Comprehending Profundity can reach that level. That leaves one more, I wonder whose it is... The Green Pine Dao Lineage dominates Jiangnan. Perhaps tracing it upward, it too is one of the Profundities."

He remained silent. Xia Shouyu and the others kneeling below were suffering, waiting anxiously. Finally, Li Ximing raised his gaze and ordered, "You stay. The rest of you, scatter."

The courtyard emptied as if swept by a gust of wind, leaving only Xia Shouyu kneeling. Li Ximing studied her and asked, "What lineage do you cultivate?"

Xia Shouyu hurriedly replied respectfully, "This lowly one practices the _Art of Suppressing Fire and Expelling Cold_. The immortal foundation it builds is called 'White Li Heart.' As for what lineage it is, no ancestor has ever succeeded in cultivating it, so we do not know what it is."

She immediately presented the cultivation art. Li Ximing scanned it. It was indeed an unranked ancient art. Judging by the contents, it wasn't particularly profound, most likely third or fourth grade. He raised an eyebrow. "How rare... it's actually Blazing Fire. This is truly a lineage seldom seen in Jiangnan... Good, good. An unexpected delight!"

Li Ximing had long intended to bring Xia Shouyu back to the lake. Every Dao lineage has its own strengths and weaknesses. The lineage she cultivated was, naturally, the more different from the Li family's, the better. Even if this woman failed her breakthrough, this _Art of Suppressing Fire and Expelling Cold_ was a rare lineage manual in itself.

He smiled and nodded, considering the medicinal pills.

'Unfortunately, I don't know the principles of generation and restraint for the Blazing Fire lineage. I only recall descriptions of it 'calming dampness,' 'expelling rain,' and 'transforming cold into heat.' I should avoid the Water Virtue and Cold Qi. Choosing the Fire Virtue is safest.'

He raised his gaze. "Are there any demonic beasts nearby that spit fire and wield flames? I promised you the Great Dao of Foundation Establishment; I should deliver."

Hearing this, Xia Shouyu was practically overwhelmed with joy. She kowtowed repeatedly, her head striking the ground. "This lowly one cannot repay this grace in nine lifetimes! If you have any command in the future, I will die ten thousand deaths to fulfill it..."

She didn't offer too much fawning praise, only saying respectfully, "I have only heard that the Peacock Sea to the east has many islands and many peacocks. Each one is as large as a courtyard, swallowing metal and spitting fire, ferocious and intimidating. The sea also holds single-horned ox-demons. They are all demonic beasts that spit fire and wield flames."

Li Ximing recalled that the Peacock Sea was also home to a Purple Mansion power, Nine Mounds Mountain. Logically, he could pay them a visit. But looking at this clever woman, a plan formed in his mind:

'Zhouming is... he might not even succeed at Foundation Establishment... His reputation has never been good, making him easy to manipulate. I cannot let him marry a direct descendant of some Purple Mansion clan! This Xia Shouyu is intelligent, clever, and exceptionally talented. Her background is clean... and she is very beautiful... She is perfectly suitable.'

As for Li Zhouming's own opinion, Li Ximing wasn't worried. That child was an incorrigible lecher; he wouldn't have any complaints about marrying her. Thus, he said, "Prepare yourself well. Once you achieve your immortal foundation, another opportunity will await you."

His figure dissipated like flowing light. The sky was already dimming, and the courtyard instantly grew dark. Xia Shouyu's eyes, however, glittered brightly. She stood up, thinking to herself:

'As long as I have the chance to leave this destitute place... as long as I don't have to be trapped on this desolate island until I die... this is a heaven-sent fortune!'

# Chapter 794: Great Divine Ability

The Peacock Sea.

The waters of the Peacock Sea were unique, a deep brown tinged with green luminescence. Many stretches of the surface were an iridescent mix of coppery-purple and verdant-violet, glittering with ten thousand colors, dazzling to behold.

Upon this jewel-like, shimmering sea, a cultivator in white-gold Daoist robes pierced through the Great Void and materialized.

Li Ximing estimated he had arrived at the Peacock Sea and began to walk across its surface, a sigh of emotion rising in his heart:

'The Sea's Cape is truly distant...'

Li Ximing had traversed the Great Void to get here. His original plan had been to ride the winds all the way from the mortal world, collecting spiritual materials along the route. Who would have thought that even flying for days at his Purple Mansion Realm speed, he hadn't even managed to fly out of the Sea's Cape region? Beyond the waters controlled by Qingxu Temple, there was nothing but an endless, mundane sea, utterly cut off from spiritual qi.

Such places had no connection to the Great Void; within that higher dimension, they were but a single, almost nonexistent point, bypassed in a flash. For an ordinary cultivator, flying that distance would take months, if not years. No wonder no one was willing to travel to the Sea's Cape.

He had merely found a spot with a bare minimum of spiritual qi, entered the Great Void, and this time, he reached the Peacock Sea almost instantly. Gazing back at the boundless ocean behind him, he couldn't help but marvel:

"What a desolate and impoverished place. If a cultivator ever managed to fight their way out from a land like that, they would be a truly world-shaking talent."

He flew along the Peacock Sea for a while. The spiritual qi finally grew dense. Several of the barren islands he passed possessed spiritual qi on par with Qingxu Temple. Flying and stopping intermittently, he soon spotted several large peacocks with vibrant, colorful wings soaring through the air, bringing with them a rolling wave of heat.

The largest of these peacocks was the size of a courtyard, its back broad enough to carry a building. Even the smallest was powerfully built, larger than a bedframe, its feathers a riotous blaze of purple, red, and green. Flames churned around it—a truly majestic sight.

Li Ximing glanced over and thought he saw human figures on the peacocks' backs. He immediately dismissed the idea of attacking and traversed the Great Void again, materializing over a massive island bustling with a noisy, lively crowd below.

This place was nothing like the Sea's Cape; concealing his tracks was necessary. Li Ximing casually altered his face and retracted the aura of Profound Light from his robes, erasing every trace of his Bright Yang divine ability.

He grasped his hand, and the jade-bead-like Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger materialized. Pinching it in his fingers, he used the spiritual tool's authority to transform his entire aura into that of the Bound Earth Dao lineage, suppressing his cultivation to the late Foundation Establishment Realm.

Taking a step forward, he transformed into a middle-aged cultivator wearing brown robes.

Li Ximing was utterly clueless regarding the Dao of Transformations. This series of changes couldn't fool a Purple Mansion cultivator, nor even a Foundation Establishment cultivator who specialized in such arts. Unfortunately for them, the island was filled with nothing but Qi Refining and Embryonic Breathing cultivators, all of whom prostrated themselves the moment they saw him.

The one leading them was the island master. He was similarly dirt-poor, but at least slightly better off than Qingxu Temple; the man wore a Qi Refining-level magical sword at his waist. He kowtowed and said:

"I do not know where the Master comes from? My land is humble and may stain your noble feet..."

Although the archaic customs here weren't as pronounced as at the Sea's Cape, they still retained the "Master" form of address. Li Ximing asked:

"What place is this, and whose domain are these seas?"

The island master bowed. "Reporting to Master, this is Gaoxuan Island. The Peacock Sea is the territory of the Grand Dao of Tai-Tao and the Nine Mounds. About two thousand li east of here, there is a Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain, where the Daoist Masters reside."

Inquiring here at the Peacock Sea was far more convenient. This single sentence was infinitely more useful than the vague information Xia Shouyu had provided. Li Ximing lowered his voice:

"I have heard there is a great divine ability user in the Peacock Sea. Might I ask which Daoist Master cultivates here?"

The man hurriedly bowed again. "Reporting to Master, on the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain resides Daoist Master Yuandao, a possessor of great divine abilities. The entire Peacock Sea venerates him alone. He is kind and charitable. Not only do people from all the nearby sea regions come to seek his teachings, but even Daoist Masters from the unreachable Jiangnan come to pay their respects..."

'Daoist Master Yuandao...'

Li Ximing had never heard the name. He frowned, forced to ask, "Do you know what lineage the Grand Dao of Tai-Tao and the Nine Mounds is... What is the surname of their direct line?"

The man was only at the Qi Refining level; how could he possibly know anything about lineages? Terrified of offending the powerful cultivator, he broke into a cold sweat, racking his brain.

"This lowly one is in a remote place and knows nothing of lineages... or direct lines... I have never had the opportunity to ask..."

Just as sweat poured down his face, his eyes suddenly lit up. "However... when this lowly one was young, I followed my father once to the Peacock Sea Market. The lord administrator of that market had come down from the mountain. All the cultivators called him... Lord Dantai..."

'Dantai?!'

Enlightenment struck Li Ximing. He thought inwardly:

"Someone from the Dantai family! Dantai Jin of the Azure Pond Sect is from that family... This Daoist Master Yuandao must be Si Boxiu's friend!"

"Well, well. So the Dantai family is in the Peacock Sea... and they command such prestige! Daoist Master Yuanxiu truly found a powerful backer for his descendants..."

With this understanding, he felt an unexpected surge of delight. He raised an eyebrow. "I see... Are all the peacocks in this sea from the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain? Who normally governs the demons here?"

The man didn't know why the topic had suddenly shifted to demons, but he replied, "You may not know, sir, but the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain is located in the southwestern part of the Peacock Sea, which is also where the largest clusters of islands and landmasses are. The peacock lords are all in the northeast... stretching continuously northward, there is a Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendor. It is where the peacock lords cultivate. They all read sutras and strike wooden fish. They are said to have blessed lands within their bellies and have saved many people."

This piqued Li Ximing's interest. He asked, "The Peacock Sea once had a Demon King, and now its descendants are studying Buddhist cultivation? For the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain to tolerate them, they must have someone backing them."

The island master naturally didn't know the details. "They are indeed the descendants of that great one. I've heard that these lords, with their myriad colors, are connected to many Dao lineages within the sea. They often share life and death with those great figures..."

Li Ximing understood. The Merciful Ones of the mainland frequently came here looking for mounts. He mused internally:

'If I'm going to hunt demons, hunting these sutra-chanting peacocks would be the most satisfying. Unfortunately, my condition is not optimal, and I don't know who stands behind them, so it's not wise to make a move. Still, I can memorize the location...'

"In the future, if I need sacrifices for a ritual or ingredients for alchemy, I can swing by this flock of peacocks and 'reap an autumn harvest.' After all, demons without backing are hard to find, but the peacocks in this temple are both fat and plentiful."

Thus, he asked, "Do you know of any area that is more chaotic, where demons run rampant?"

The man replied, "Further south, there is the East A-Wang Sea. The dragon-kin have withdrawn and no longer govern those waters, so it's in total chaos... Everyone is planning to go there to make a fortune."

Li Ximing nodded. He casually tossed the man two medicinal pills and traversed space. Being so close to the Sea's Cape, the Great Void was extremely efficient. He quickly arrived at this East A-Wang Sea. Peering through the Great Void for a moment, he tracked the spiritual qi fluctuations and broke through. Sure enough, he saw battles raging everywhere in utter chaos.

Not far away, a great black-feathered bird with crimson eyes was flying, wreathed in roaring flames. Two groups of people were scattering in panic. The flame-spewing bird blotted out the sun, its fire scorching the surroundings white as it stretched its neck, swallowing cultivators one by one, leisurely pursuing the fleeing crowd.

"Yo! Better to arrive at the right time... than to arrive early."

Just as the demon was reveling in its power, a cultivator in white-gold robes appeared from thin air beside it. He reached out one hand and seized the majestic demon by the neck, lifting it casually. In an instant, all the flames vanished. The bird, struck by the divine ability, was forced back to its original form, shrinking to the size of a common wild goose. Its legs stuck out rigidly, unable to move a feather.

The sea was instantly plunged into silence, broken only by the hysterical, heart-wrenching shriek of a lesser demon below:

"The Great Demon King of the Primal-Parting Treasured Pagoda who Burns the Heavens has been captured!"

Li Ximing frowned at the name, suspicious. He held the vicious demon like a dead bird, grabbing its tail and holding it upside down. He slapped its beak, forcing the dead-seeming bird to open its mouth wide, and gave it a few shakes, emptying everything from its stomach.

He glanced at the pile. Not a single item was noteworthy. Realizing the demon was worthless, he frowned.

"What corner of the wilderness did this demon crawl out of? Utterly ignorant. With such shallow cultivation, how dare it take such a magnificent title. Anyone who didn't know better would think a Demon King was here..."

He untied his belt, looped it around the bird's neck, tied it off, and fastened it to his robe, looking just like a Daoist descending a mountain after buying a chicken from a farmer. He then turned and left.

He left behind a crowd of cultivators and lesser demons, all standing frozen on the spot, staring dumbly at each other. Faintly, they heard cries that "The Great Demon King... has fallen!" One cultivator raised his head, his face a mask of indelible shock and the profound relief of having survived. He whispered, "A great divine ability user... This is nothing less than a great divine ability!"

A cultivator next to him, wearing similar attire, let out a heavy breath and replied, "Let's go... Brother Li. This place is not safe. Elder Shihai is already on his way. We must rendezvous quickly."

...

Moongaze Lake.

The rainy season had passed. Without the bother of the rain, the stone steps of Mount Qingdu appeared even cleaner. The moonlight swept across the courtyard, year after year, just as it always had.

The small courtyard was quiet. An old man stood with his hands clasped behind his back, pacing the yard. Li Shuya, dressed in brown, stood to the side holding a jade tray, waiting. As the bell tolled the midnight hour, Li Shuya took a step forward and said softly:

"Old Master... it is midnight."

In the jade cup on the tray, a clear tea had already been poured. This was brewed from the treasure medicine "Cleansing Cloud Floating Leaf," an item Li Ximing himself had ordered years ago to help Li Xuanxuan recuperate, to be consumed along with his medicinal pills.

Li Xuanxuan understood this was Li Shuya's duty and didn't make it difficult for him. He drank it quickly, finally unable to hold back his question:

"Xixuan has been locked in the ancestral hall. How... how is he now?"

Li Xixuan had been confined to Mount Qingdu ever since his argument with Li Xuanxuan and had not yet been released. Li Shuya, however, misunderstood the question and replied respectfully:

"The entire island and the shore are using this as a cautionary tale. Progress on the western bank has also sped up considerably..."

Li Xuanxuan fell silent for a moment, then asked:

"Minggong is in seclusion... and Xixuan is confined to the courtyard by me. The Yuanwan branch must be in an uproar. Has no one come to plead for him recently? Are there any other movements?"

Li Shuya shook his head, hesitating. "This junior does not know... The Yuanwan branch has not formally split the family. Only one branch with a few Spirit Aperture members split off. Later, it was only after Lady Minggong reached Spirit Aperture that Lord Xixuan's side was established as its own branch. Right now, the five or six households are extremely anxious. Some have even tried to persuade this lowly one, hoping I can convince the Old Master to calm his anger..."

Li Xuanxuan asked again, "What is the island saying about this matter?"

Li Shuya paused, then said haltingly, "All the clan members are very... emotional..."

"Emotional?"

Li Xuanxuan knew exactly what they were feeling. He sighed, his voice weary. "They are all wringing their hands in sympathy for him, aren't they... Xixuan championed the greater good, fighting to secure them shelter... going so far as to defy me... How could I, his grandfather, not see what these children are thinking? Let him be confined for now. We will see how many people jump out later."

He paced the courtyard another round, then looked up. "It's getting late. You should rest. I am going to see the clan head."

Li Shuya was, after all, a mortal. Worrying day and night alongside Li Xuanxuan during this period had taken its toll. The old man dismissed him to rest and flew up on the wind alone, landing on the continent shore shortly after.

He saw a scene of bright lights and revelry. Several brightly lit red pleasure barges, burning candles and lamps, drifted lazily across the lake's surface. Waves of fragrant perfume and song drifted from the barges, floating over the water.

These were clearly not transport vessels, but a new form of entertainment and pleasure. The trend had begun in Lijing Prefecture, confined only to the rivers. Later, as the Li family cultivators grew in number, the restrictions on luxury and pleasure-seeking had loosened somewhat. They all moved out onto the lake, making the scene even livelier.

The pleasure barges were filled with high officials and nobles. The direct descendants of the Li family naturally did not frequent them; they were mostly places of enjoyment for those with other surnames or from minor clans. Therefore, Li Xuanxuan did not find the scene decadent; rather, he found the bustling atmosphere relaxing.

'One, it diverts the idle thoughts of these cultivators. Two, it keeps the lake from looking dead and dreary... A bit more open celebration means a bit less hidden debauchery...'

After Li Ximing reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the interactions between the island and the shore had grown closer. Many of these things seemed to have sprouted from the cracks in the rules, but in truth, they had been permitted successively by both Li Zhouwei and Li Jiangqian. The old man looked around, shaking his head and sighing to himself:

'It is very prosperous... No wonder those on the island are envious.'

But just as the old man shifted his gaze back toward the island, he spotted a youth in red robes secretly landing, seeming to have just returned from outside the island. He cleared his throat and flew over in pursuit, calling out:

"Li Zhouming!"

Li Zhouming jumped in fright. Seeing who it was, his first instinct was to run. He took one step back before realizing it was too late. He put on an obsequious smile.

"So it is the Old Master... I haven't had the chance to visit you these past few days..."

Li Xuanxuan sized the boy up. "Where did you go?"

Li Zhouming gave an awkward smile. "I met a lovely girl on the shore. She just reached the second layer of Embryonic Breathing. I saw her family was struggling and couldn't afford any Dharma Artifacts, so I had a hairpin made... Yup... I just delivered it tonight."

Although Li Zhouming was a wastrel, his one redeeming quality was that he never lied to Li Xuanxuan; otherwise, the old man wouldn't have such a crystal-clear understanding of his debauchery. Li Xuanxuan just frowned.

"Which family's girl is it this time... You fall in love every three days and replace her every six months. Don't you dare do anything disgraceful!"

Li Zhouming bowed with his hands clasped. "Old Ancestor... this junior is just appreciating her, I haven't tried any dirty tricks... The family rules are so strict, if I even had such a thought, they'd surely force her on me. Then I'd never be able to look at beautiful women again..."

Li Xuanxuan was often helpless against him. He shook his head and sighed. "Behaving like this... it is not good for the girl's reputation... You should interact less..."

Li Zhouming quickly said, "Rest assured, I have my ways of handling Mount Qingdu... It will never come to that, otherwise how would I have muddled along until today? This is my only hobby. If you cut this path off, you'll be taking my life..."

"Scram, scram!"

Li Xuanxuan could only let him go. He walked quickly toward the main hall. Only after the old man was gone did Li Zhouming straighten up. His two attendants looked at him as the wastrel muttered:

"Those few families do nothing but wail and mourn all day, acting like a little confinement is a death sentence! One wants to go farm, the other wants to go pole a boat. I heard it all from little sister Xinghan! They've secretly taken who-knows-how-much wealth from Aunt Minggong... I bet they have so much money they don't know how to spend it!"

"Aunt is kind-hearted and afraid they'll be punished, so she keeps quiet about it, and now they've bothered the Old Master himself! Let's go, let's go..."

The two couldn't help but look up. "Your Highness..."

Li Zhouming's face turned serious. He flicked his sleeve, snapping his fan open with a *shua*, and declared:

"Didn't those families spend all day staring at me just to report me to Mount Qingdu? Damn it, they can't even figure out how to sneak around and enjoy themselves properly, they just spend all their time being jealous of me. Today, we're going to their courtyards, and we're going to pick out the laziest crybaby, the foulest bird in the nest, the whiniest dog looking for fun... and curse them out before we leave..."

"At the very least, we'll vent some anger and piss them off. Let's see how sincerely they can keep crying then!"

Brimming with enthusiasm, he stalked off, damning his two attendants, who were sweating in terror. They scrambled after him, trying and failing to dissuade him, whining miserably:

"Little master! You can't just go cursing people... everyone on the island is watching... Aiyo..."

# Chapter 795: Purple Geng Broad Valley

Li Xuanxuan arrived at the main hall. The lamps within were blazing brightly. Li Zhouluo was still present, having apparently just finished handling administrative affairs, and was now cultivating a Dharma Art. He formed a seal, and five or six dazzling golden rays circled his fingers, emitting a piercing shriek.

The moment the elder arrived, the young man opened his eyes, halted the Dharma Art, and descended from the main seat.

"Elder, you've arrived," he said respectfully.

Li Xuanxuan nodded, coughed, and replied, "You've worked hard these days... The West Bank affair is troublesome. You are caught between several branches with no one you truly trust. It's a difficult position... Have you heard about Li Xixuan's situation?"

Li Zhouluo bowed. "This is this junior's duty. As for the elder's matter... there have been some grievances on the isle recently. However, they are not directed at you, Elder. Most of the blame is aimed at Mount Qingdu, claiming it harbors treacherous villains who are sowing discord in the clan."

He led Li Xuanxuan to a seat nearby. "I have read the letter you sent me a few days ago, Elder. The situation is indeed thorny."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head. "When the ancestors set the rules, they decreed that if main branch disciples lacked spiritual apertures, they could not serve as officials or merchants. But the isle is rich in spiritual energy, and the main branch holds a respected status. These children do not separate from the family and continue living on the isle. They want to maintain their main branch status while also gaining favor to enter official posts... I’ve thought it over and over. These two prohibitions cannot be relaxed. If they enter the shore territories carrying the title of a main branch direct descendant, even a fool sitting in that post would have people lining up to deliver money... to say nothing of the harm a few cunning ones could do. That would be ruinous."

Only after Li Xuanxuan had firmly stated his position did Li Zhouluo speak in a low voice. "Junior has also reflected on this recently. The isle is indeed too idle. Everyone is living right under Mount Qingdu's watch, which isn't comfortable. Those two rules absolutely cannot be relaxed. But we can compensate elsewhere. We can loosen the oversight on finances... It’s hard to criticize them for receiving some wealth from their cultivator siblings. Yet, the competitive methods used against external families cannot be applied to them, or it will harm the peace between the four branches. They are mortals, after all. There is no harm in letting them enjoy some comforts."

Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan replied in a weary voice, "You must not underestimate mortals. These people are the future parents of cultivators. I fear we are fostering a trend of extravagance... The clan rules must be changed, but they cannot be changed by you... You are the sole seedling of the Fourth branch. If you offend the clansmen, your entire branch will be isolated."

Li Zhouluo hadn't considered that point. He nodded slightly, listening intently as the elder continued.

"The plan now is to placate them for a few years and ensure you can step down from your post intact, preferably having earned a benevolent reputation. This is crucial so that the Fourth branch can maintain close relations with the other three branches in the future."

Dili Guang had already withdrawn. Li Zhouluo personally served the elder tea as Li Xuanxuan continued.

"How many people are currently receiving favor?"

Li Zhouluo replied, "I have strictly followed the clan rules and not granted favor easily. I only granted it to the orphans of a few uncles and brothers who died in battle. The remaining mortal clan members pleaded relentlessly. My heart softened somewhat, and after careful consideration, I arranged some very minor official posts for them..."

He did not expose Zhoufang and his brother, claiming only that his own heart had softened. Li Xuanxuan sipped his tea and replied:

"Tomorrow morning, you will bring men to my courtyard to plead on Li Xixuan's behalf. Make sure to bring Zhoufang; I see he has been very anxious lately... After pleading, you will retrieve Li Xixuan."

Li Zhouluo respectfully agreed. The elder continued, "Once you bring him back to this hall, you will announce that you cannot bear to see your brothers and sisters suffer and have already considered the matter of granting favor and promoting mortals."

"Let Mount Qingdu handle the selection. Use a secret inspection method. Assess candidates based on their character, their parents' merits, their knowledge, and their loyalty and piety. Promote the descendants and observe them for three years. Announce the list at the sacrificial ceremony three years from now."

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouluo. The elder continued, "Do not mention the number of positions in the list. First, keep them settled for a few years. After three years, having promoted individuals from every branch, you can step down from your position. Earning their reputation is enough. Then we wait for Li Jiangqian to come out and play the villain... That child is fierce, ruthless, and clever. He isn't afraid of offending anyone. They will have their hands full."

Li Zhouluo felt complete admiration for the elder. Few in the clan understood his awkward predicament. Li Xuanxuan was, as always, the one elder who genuinely considered his welfare. Deeply moved, he replied, "Thank you, Elder."

Li Xuanxuan nodded. "Although the isle is united in intent, few are willing to take the lead. Of the four who troubled you that day, Li Chengzhi and Xi'e are easily pacified. Li Xixuan is currently locked up. Only Li Chenghao is stubborn. He cares deeply for the clansmen and acts with seasoned cunning. It would be best to send him away. The rest will then be a dragon without a head."

"Although I arrived in secret, I have already shown my face. The isle will soon know. You understand what to say... I don't need..."

He was halfway through his sentence when the sound of hurried footsteps came from outside the hall. Dili Guang's voice was urgent. "Patriarch, an urgent report from the isle."

Li Zhouluo glanced at Li Xuanxuan, who nodded. "Bring it in."

Dili Guang strode forward, bowed to both men, and reported respectfully, "Young Master Zhouming has arrived on the isle. He went to the courtyard of the Yuanwan Branch and caused a huge disturbance. Tonight, the clansmen invited elders from other branches, and they were wailing in the courtyard. The Young Master cursed them until they fled in all directions. The several elders are extremely embarrassed."

Li Zhouluo was stunned. Li Xuanxuan, however, showed no surprise. He rose from his seat and said flatly, "That monster stirs up trouble everywhere. You and I will go and capture him right now."

Li Zhouluo understood the elder was going over to back Zhouming up. He nodded. "Elder, please..."

The two rode the wind together, swiftly descending upon a residence on the isle. It was a large, antique-style complex. The central courtyard was in chaos. Several middle-aged men stood there, their faces flushed red amid the uproar.

Zhouming, dressed in red robes, was instead sitting calmly in the main courtyard, his fan resting beside him, a faint smile on his face. Surrounded by the furious yet silent expressions of the crowd, he truly looked the part of a dissolute aristocratic scion.

When Li Xuanxuan and Li Zhouluo landed in the courtyard, a wave of exclamation erupted. Everyone dropped to their knees. Zhouming also leaped from his seat and bowed. "Greetings, Ancestor! Greetings, Patriarch!"

Li Xuanxuan swept his gaze over the scene. "You're causing trouble again! With so many elders present, what right do you have to speak? Yet here you are, lecturing your brothers."

Zhouming quickly replied, "Ancestor, I was just passing this place when I heard weeping from the courtyard. I suspected that perhaps Grand-uncle Li Xixuan was advanced in age and this was a funeral. Only after listening did I learn that Grand-uncle Li Xixuan has gone to live on Mount Qingdu..."

He crossed his arms and said angrily, "When I saw them rushing to divide the family property, holding a funeral mourning in advance, this fire in my heart... I just couldn't stop it..."

"You... You're spouting venom!" a middle-aged man nearby flushed crimson again.

Zhouming laughed. "It's not dividing property? Then what is it?"

Chaos erupted. Li Chenghao immediately stepped forward, pulling the two sides apart and silencing them. He glared at the surrounding people until everyone in the courtyard finally shut their mouths.

Li Chenghao was one of the few remaining cultivators of the Chengming generation. Besides the two at the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had the highest cultivation. His two brothers had gone with him to the river, but he was the only one to return. He had even lost an arm, which Li Ximing had later restored.

Now, his daughter had also died in Funan. He was a man of great hardship and merit, seasoned by the vicissitudes of the world. He was beyond comparison to this group of people who only lived on the isle.

'The Elder is playing favorites. Arguing with Zhouming will achieve nothing; he'll just turn the questions back on us. I must seize the current situation.'

He raised his brows and bowed. "Elder, Young Master Zhouming has caused a disturbance in the courtyard without reason, insulting his elders and clansmen. I request he be handed over to Mount Qingdu."

But Li Xuanxuan was even more cunning. He immediately nodded and replied, "Correct. Come... escort the Young Master to Mount Qingdu."

Dili Guang quickly stepped up and escorted Zhouming away. The young man snapped his fan shut and departed resentfully.

Li Xuanxuan coughed, reaching out to help Li Chenghao up. He spoke warmly, "It's good you are here, child. I was just looking for you. I have an important clan matter to entrust to you."

Although Li Chenghao was stubborn, he deeply respected Li Xuanxuan. Hearing this, he quickly rose and followed him out respectfully, leaving the courtyard full of people exchanging glances. Some wanted to leave, some turned to Li Zhouluo to plead their case, and others began apologizing for the trouble.

Li Xuanxuan had dissipated the storm in the courtyard with just two sentences. Taking Li Chenghao out was also not a spur-of-the-moment decision.

Once outside the courtyard, the elder walked for a moment and sighed. "Child, Li Minggong and Li Chenghuai are both in seclusion. There aren't many elders left in the clan, so many things must fall on your shoulders... The Profound Peak Gate has relocated, Cui Jueyin has returned to the isle, and the various families of the Eastern shore and the wilderness beyond are all in Jiangxia's hands. The authority of the Milin Mountains to command the Eastern shore cannot be left vacant. I must ask you to make a trip and take charge of the palace affairs in his stead."

This was a task that was both demanding and offered little reward. But Li Chenghao flicked his robes and dropped to the ground with a thud. His voice was exceptionally low. "If the Lake commands, Chenghao will not shirk death! But Ancestor, please do not send me away just to stabilize the island..."

He knocked his head heavily on the ground. "When my clan uncle made his move, this junior only acted to protect Chengpan. But this situation in the clan is definitely wrong, and it must be changed. Our Moongaze Li clan is raising a flock of idle mouths on this isle, a bunch of Purple Mansion immortal descendants who only farm! What decency is there... It must be changed, Elder..."

Li Xuanxuan helped him up. "I know your heart. You also grew up in the courtyard with Li Chengliao and the others. Otherwise, you wouldn't have fought so desperately in the north back then. No one of the Chengming generation is a coward. This is what I am thinking... Take the younger generation of the clan... those who dare to fight, especially those without elder backing, take them all with you. Let them follow you, learn, and see the world..."

"Thank you, Elder!" Li Chenghui nodded repeatedly.

Li Xuanxuan offered a few more words of comfort and sent him off. He stood there, clasping his sleeves, taking a breath and releasing it. He leaned against a lacquered wooden pillar of the corridor, gazing at the night scenery. Patches of purple qi were visible at the horizon. Just as he was wondering, he saw Dili Guang rushing up.

"Elder," Dili Guang reported, "People from the Purple Smoke Gate have arrived! It’s a large, lively procession, and they are insisting on seeing you."

"So soon!" Li Xuanxuan was both shocked and overjoyed. For a group from the Purple Smoke Gate to arrive at this specific moment, demanding to see him by name, it must be about the formation. He immediately hurried off. Dili Guang's cultivation was lower, and he broke into a sweat trying to keep up.

They reached the main hall in moments. Wen Wu was already waiting, chatting warmly with Li Zhouluo. Seeing Li Xuanxuan, his face lit up with a smile. He retrieved two carp-shaped wooden boxes from his sleeve and laughed. "Senior is as kind and gentle as ever. It warms this junior's heart just to see you... The two children from your clan are doing very well. Li Quexi asked me to bring a letter. I figured since the children are so filial, I made a special trip to Ziqi Peak and brought Li Queyi's letter as well!"

Wen Wu had a very agreeable way of doing things. He passed the letters into Li Xuanxuan's hands. The elder smiled and accepted them. As a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator, he didn't even need to weigh them to feel the significant difference in weight between the boxes. He put them away with a flick of his sleeve and replied, "We have truly troubled you, sir... The children from my family are slow. We must trouble Senior Brother to guide them well."

Wen Wu laughed heartily. "Senior, you may not know, but our Purple Smoke Blessed Land holds an annual competition, with contests separated by cultivation level. Little Junior Sister's Dharma Arts are profound and her reactions are extremely fast. She delightfully secured sixth place in the Embyronic Breathing division and received an award!"

"Everyone in the sect knows she is from the Moongaze Immortal Clan. They all give her a thumbs-up, saying she has the same flair Shen Yanqing had back in the day..."

Li Zhouluo nodded repeatedly and asked, "I wonder how Li Queyi..."

Wen Wu picked up smoothly. "She is also striving hard! Within the sect, the coordination between Dharma Arts and cultivation methods for Qi Refining cultivators is already well-established, and their Dharma artifacts are very powerful. Among all the early-stage Qi Refining cultivators, Li Queyi placed thirty-first, just missing the top thirty. Though regrettable, her 'Celestial Moon Sword Arc' stunned the audience and even made the Peak Lord of Qi Sword Peak raise his eyebrows!"

Wen Wu selected only the pleasant news to share. Li Zhouluo was also pleasantly surprised. "The Purple Smoke Blessed Land is truly formidable. She never grasped it at home, yet she masters it immediately after joining."

Li Xuanxuan smiled and brought the topic back, pointedly ignoring Li Queyi and praising Li Quexi instead. Wen Wu paced and nodded, the pair of gold and white talismans at his waist clinking together.

"Senior," Wen Wu said, "I have come this time regarding the Daoist Master's affairs. I heard from my Peak Lord that the Daoist Master from your esteemed clan entrusted our Blessed Land with a Purple Mansion Grand Formation. After all, the Daoist Master's skill in formations is exquisite. The original plan was to ask the Daoist Master to set it up personally, but a Purple Mansion formation is not the work of a day or two, so we came over first."

He observed the expressions of the two men and continued formally, "The matter of a formation concerns the continuation of a Dao lineage. It is often said it cannot be lightly taught to others. Our Paradise also considered this, which is why we dared not come to build it rashly. Our dispatch this time is to first forge several components related to the formation platform. This timing should allow us to wait for Daoist Master Zhaojing's return. He can inspect everything personally before we proceed to the next step."

His words perfectly displayed the grace of the Supreme Yang Dao lineage. He retrieved a heavy, purple-gold scroll from his sleeve, patterned on both ends with deer, birds, and scripture symbols. He tucked it into his robes first, saying:

"For this task, the Muzuo Peak, Tianzhen Peak, and Cuiging Peak of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land have joined forces. We have dispatched five Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, twenty-seven late-stage Qi Refining cultivators, two master refiners, six artisan refiners, one formation master, and four formation artisans, for a total of thirty-two members, led by myself, Wen Wu , first disciple of Mu Zuo Peak."

He presented the purple-gold scroll to Li Xuanxuan. "Senior, this grand formation requires thirty-two 'Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails.' Each must be one hundred and eighty *ren* long and three *zhang* and two *chi* in circumference. All specifications, runes, and spiritual materials are recorded in this scroll. Please verify them, Senior."

### Chapter 796: Purple Mansion Forethought

'One hundred and eighty *ren* long, and three *zhang* and two *chi* in circumference!'

Li Zhouluo quickly made the calculation. The main hall on the isle was three hundred and eighteen *chi* long. A single one of these "Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails" was as long as four main halls. Stood on end, it would be taller than twelve Inherited Clarity Gates stacked together...

And a circumference of three *zhang* and two *chi* meant it was as wide as a small hut. Furthermore, these Profound Nails certainly wouldn't be made of ordinary metal; they would require an admixture of spiritual objects. The materials needed had reached terrifying levels!

Li Xuanxuan was also visibly shocked. He accepted the scroll with both hands and looked at the densely packed list of spiritual materials, a chill rising in his heart. His expression remained calm as he asked, "These thirty-two Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails... what is their main component? What is their approximate value?"

Wen Wu cupped his hands. "The main body only uses iron essence and copper essence. The Eastern Sea has plenty of those. My Purple Smoke Gate has markets in the Eastern Sea and several small mining islands. We will deliver it in batches; Senior need not worry."

"As for the cost, it is not excessive. The iron and copper essences just require labor, and your esteemed clan can smelt them yourselves. Our people will handle the runes, formation patterns, and forging for your clan. Only the other spiritual materials need to be procured by your clan. I estimate... around ninety spirit stones."

He paused, then added, "Per nail."

Li Xuanxuan scanned the scroll back and forth, picking out several materials required in large quantities to study. He spoke in his aged voice, "We don't need to trouble the Blessed Land for everything. Many of these spiritual materials can be sourced from our own Lake."

"Qingwu, Wuhui Spirit Molybdenum, and Mishui Cold Iron are three minerals abundant at the bottom of the lake. Both production and reserves are vast, and we have been excavating them regularly over the years. Shu-White Copper, Fufu Lapis-Iron... these eight types are all produced on the Western shore. The Eastern shore also has Cuiyuan Copper Essence and other such items. Most of these can cover the requirements."

Li Xuanxuan was no longer managing the clan's assets, so while he knew the inventory list, he didn't know the specific quantities. There was also "Yecai Stone" produced on Zongquan Island, but the amount required wasn't large, and Zongquan Island wasn't public knowledge, so Li Xuanxuan didn't mention it to him.

As soon as he finished speaking, Li Zhouluo had already started calculating. He nodded slightly. "We produce these items in-house. The remaining cost can be lowered to sixty or seventy spirit stones. Also... please wait a moment, you two."

He retrieved a jade slip from the desk, checking it against the purple-gold scroll. A strange look crossed his face. "There are some... heirlooms left by the ancestors, and some spiritual materials gathered from the wilderness. These match up. They match up perfectly. I will give the list to you later..."

Wen Wu nodded cheerfully, seeming entirely unsurprised. He bowed. "These thirty-two Profound Nails are very troublesome, especially the materials. Bulk procurement will cause prices to soar, so we cannot rush it. It probably won't be finished even in three to five years. I must ask the Patriarch to designate a resting place on the isle for our Blessed Land's cultivators. Many sect cultivators will be traveling in the vicinity or journeying back and forth from the sect for handovers. We will have to trouble your clan."

"But please rest assured, everyone from my sect has sworn a spiritual oath. They are all elites and will absolutely maintain secrecy. Not only will the formation patterns be drawn separately and the components forged separately, but they will not even know the names of the components or the formation itself."

"How can you say that? It is Moongaze that must thank the Blessed Land."

The two exchanged pleasantries. Wen Wu also had spiritual materials and pills to deliver to Li Quexi's family, and the Purple Smoke cultivators on the isle still needed arranging, so he departed early.

The great doors of the hall closed tightly. Li Xuanxuan frowned. "Zhouluo, what 'ancestral heirlooms' and 'wilderness materials'? Those are just one or two items. How can they be used for the immense quantities needed for the Mountain-Piercing Nails? How much could that possibly save?"

Li Zhouluo no longer concealed the strange look on his face. "Elder, this will save at least twenty spirit stones in expenses! Twenty per nail, times thirty-two nails... that's six hundred and forty spirit stones!"

Li Xuanxuan was thoroughly shocked. "Where did this come from!"

Li Zhouluo looked somewhat awkward. "This... Elder, you don't know. Back when the Profound Peak Gate collapsed and Kong Guxi moved his mountain into the wilderness, he was terrified of a sudden raid by the White Ye Immortal Sect emptying his vaults. He stored a large amount of spiritual materials with our family..."

"Later... the wilderness was also gone. Kong Guxi packed his valuables and came to the Eastern Shore, but the materials remained stored with us. Finally, the Profound Peak Dao lineage vanished. Kong Guxi didn't even want to take back the large batches of Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining materials. He only packed up the treasure medicines. The rest... he either gifted away or sold cheaply, currying favor with many factions..."

"The bulk of the materials was enormous. Selling it suddenly would crash the price, and selling in batches would have taken five or ten years... After all, no single family was willing to buy it all. So, half-selling and half-gifting, he gave it all to our family as a favor."

Li Zhouluo looked bewildered. "Now, reading this scroll and checking it, I find that nearly eighty to ninety percent of the items listed are things produced or stockpiled by the Profound Peak Gate! And this is *after* the Profound Peak mountain gate was lost and Kong Guxi took a batch of materials back with him. If we had obtained the complete assets of the Profound Peak Gate, we might not have had to spend a single spirit stone to forge these thirty-two Profound Nails!"

Only then did Li Xuanxuan understand. He hesitated, then sat down in the hall. "This matter was arranged in advance by the Daoist Master. Given the Profound Peak Gate's current situation, they have probably figured things out. Otherwise, where would this formation design suddenly come from..."

The elder’s expression grew wary. "The matter of the 'Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails' must remain secret. The name, especially, must not be leaked. Since the Purple Smoke side is maintaining secrecy, it's even easier for us. Do not mention the mountain. Do not mention 'Geng'. It's best not to even mention 'Profound.' If anyone absolutely must ask, just say they are called the 'Thirty-two Prefecture Purple-Broad Spirit Needles.'"

Li Zhouluo respectfully agreed. The elder coughed. "Let Cui Jueyin handle the matters regarding the spiritual materials and the Blessed Land. His cultivation is high, he acts decisively, and he's more capable than the others on the isle."

The elder gave instructions for a while longer, then left the main hall. He took out the carp-shaped wooden boxes from his sleeve, found a seat in an empty side hall, and opened them.

The first box was from Li Quexi. The child had clearly worked hard in the sect; her handwriting was much more elegant. She generally asked about family affairs and Li Xuanxuan's health. It was three pages long. At the very end, she added a note:

*'Purple Smoke has many strange and rare spiritual items. Junior received an award in the competition and also has a quota for requisitions. If the family is in urgent need of anything, you can ask junior.'*

The elder put the letter down. Li Queyi's letter was clearly much thicker. Compared to her sister Li Quexi , who had Wen Wu personally deliver her family letter, Queyi had piled letters for everyone here. Li Xuanxuan picked out his own. The girl offered greetings, then specifically asked if her father, Li Zhoufang, was still seeking favors all day. The rest of the letter beat around the bush for a long time before asking if the family could send her three types of cultivation resources.

Li Xuanxuan looked at it for a moment. He had two of the three resources in his own storage bag, and the last one wasn't hard to collect. He decided to just cover it himself. He also took out several medicinal pills to send back, packed everything together, and wrote a reply for someone to deliver.

He sorted the remaining letters to be delivered to the others, tucked both sisters' letters into his sleeve, and returned to Mount Qingdu alone via a side corridor.

'This world really turns things upside down,' he thought. 'Li Queyi was diligent and reached Qi Refining early, yet she ended up on Ziqi Peak. If she had slacked off in her childhood and been one step slower, Mu Zuo Peak definitely would have taken her... Li Quexi is aloof and proud, her talent less obvious, yet because she was born two years later, she ended up on Mu Zuo Peak.'

'That fellow Wen Wu knows how to teach and is willing to teach. Li Quexi also seems willing to learn... Her flaws in temperament are being corrected. From resources to background, the difference between them is like clouds and mud. She is poised to soar to the heavens...'

Li Xuanxuan was old and had seen many things. He had a vague premonition about the future. Seeing these two letters from the sisters left him feeling extremely conflicted.

Li Xuanxuan returned to Mount Qingdu , but Pingya Island was bustling. Li Zhouluo quickly arranged matters, settling the Purple Smoke Gate cultivators on the isle in the eastern sector. He then gave instructions to summon Cui Jueyin. For a time, the area was bright with lamps and filled with clamor.

The western courtyards, however, were quiet and dark. Ding Weizeng was just riding the wind back down into his courtyard. The burly, tiger-whiskered man looked anxious. Seeing the maidservant at the door, he asked, "How is the mistress?"

The maidservant lowered her head. "The mistress has had a poor appetite these past few days and often complains of stomach pain..."

Ding Weizeng had married his wife, Mistress Ma, in Jiangbei. Back then, Ding Weizeng was just a minor Qi Refining cultivator. Later, he submitted to the Purple Mansion Immortal Clan, and his status rose like a boat on the tide. Prestigious families often offered him their women, but Ding Weizeng refused them all, remaining loyal to Mistress Ma. It was already difficult for cultivators to bear children, even more so when both parents were cultivators. They had finally managed this one pregnancy. Now three months along, the burly man treasured it dearly.

He went in to check on his wife and helped regulate her body. He was preparing to return to Mount Qingdu immediately when his nephew came up to report.

"Wang Quwan requests an audience."

Ding Weizeng froze. The clan had not assigned any new tasks. His current duty was to patrol the lake and protect Li Zhouming and his father. His movements were irregular. Logically, they shouldn't have run into each other. He immediately grew suspicious. "Such a coincidence?"

His nephew replied, "Lord Wang has been coming every single day recently. But sir, you said you would see no one, so the message was never presented. Lord Wang seems to have urgent business; he has been waiting on the isle for you."

"So that's how it is." Ding Weizeng wanted no part in the various factions' struggles and had always refused all visitors. But Wang Quwan was an exception. This man had also been promoted by Li Ximing and was very important. "In that case, let him come up."

Before long, a middle-aged man strode into the courtyard. He had an extraordinary bearing, with a blue-gold treasured sword hanging at his waist, giving him a heroic look. Ding Weizeng laughed.

"Daoist Friend Wang, you've arrived! I haven't yet had the chance to congratulate you... That 'Jingxi Qing' sword of yours has made all the cultivators in Jiangbei and Funan sick with envy... They are all praising you as the foremost sword cultivator in Jiangbei now!"

"Senior jests... I was merely favored by the Daoist Master and seized the initiative... managing to come out on top, that's all."

Although Ding Weizeng now called him Daoist Friend, Wang Quwan remained polite and observed the etiquette of a junior. "Senior's affairs are important, and Quwan does not wish to delay clan business. However, I have encountered a thorny and confusing matter related to Jiangbei, and I have come specifically to ask for Senior's guidance."

Ding Weizeng indeed did not want to waste time. He made an inviting gesture. Wang Quwan said gravely:

"After this junior broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and paid respects to the seniors on the Lake, I received the clan's order to stand guard in Jiangbei. After I passed the Funan border, I heard considerable unrest among the cultivators there. Upon careful inquiry, there is a rumor... a rumor that an opportunity is about to manifest in Jiangbei..."

"Haha, and I wondered what it was." Ding Weizeng shook his head, explaining with a smile, "Anywhere... as long as there is spiritual activity, don't rumors fly every other day? Did Quwan hear some specific news?"

Ding Weizeng also hailed from Jiangbei and was naturally familiar with his homeland. Too many cultivators had fallen in Jiangbei during the past north-south conflicts. When he was young, every ten or fifteen days there was a new rumor about some cultivator obtaining someone's Dao lineage. It was common. Wang Quwan was a highly reliable man; he wouldn't bring this up without conclusive evidence. Sure enough, when asked, Wang Quwan spoke obliquely.

"The Wang clan migrated to Jiangbei back during the Ning State era. Our relatives are widespread. Although my branch declined and I was born of humble means, I still have two relatives... further north."

Ding Weizeng's gaze sharpened. He cut him off: "The Golden Tang Gate or the Capital immortals Dao?"

Wang Quwan said quietly, "The Chengyun Gate!"

Seeing Ding Weizeng nod thoughtfully, Wang Quwan continued, "I heard... two cultivators from overseas sought refuge with the Chengyun Gate and brought news. That ancient lineage from the Jiangbei region, the Wanling Upper Sect, has an underground palace. It is located right beneath the Chengshui Marsh. This palace is a complex maze with many entrances... and they hold three profound stone tokens that are the keys to opening its formation..."

"Oh?" Ding Weizeng watched him intently, saying only that. Wang Quwan retrieved an object from his sleeve.

"I obtained this when I intercepted a demonic cultivator."

Wang Quwan lowered his gaze. In his hand lay a small, exquisite token, displaying an ink-wash pattern of black and white. On it were carved the two ancient seal characters: "Wanling." Gently turning it over, the back read three words:

"South Seventh."

He presented the token to Ding Weizeng with both hands. The burly man held it up, feeling an icy chill on contact. He gripped it suddenly with five fingers, but the token didn't budge.

This token didn't seem like a powerful Dharma artifact, yet he couldn't discern its grade. It secretly held the radiance of a divine ability and was abnormally sturdy. Ding Weizeng gently placed the token on the desk.

"This position of mine... I cannot move or leave it. I naturally have no opportunity to break away. If Quwan is looking for me to accompany him, I'm afraid I must disappoint you... I wonder what Quwan's intentions are..."

But Wang Quwan rose and bowed deeply. "I request that Senior submit this to the main clan on my behalf, and let the masters handle it!"

Ding Weizeng was stunned. He frowned. "This is *your* opportunity..."

Wang Quwan shook his head. "One only does what one's abilities allow. I am just a minor character who has barely broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. How could I participate in the games of such an ancient Dao lineage? I only hope to offer it to the main clan, that it might provide an advantage in the contests between the great families. That would be making the best use of it."

His words made Ding Weizeng noncommittal. Wang Quwan was at the Foundation Establishment Realm and a sword cultivator, personally promoted by the Daoist Master. As long as he didn't lose his mind and try to touch Purple Mansion level benefits, making a huge profit wouldn't be difficult. This was likely a feint—retreating in order to advance.

Ding Weizeng replied, "Moongaze is not a stingy main clan. If this is truly an opportunity you found, no one on the Lake will steal it... At most, I will go up and ask about this matter for you. It would be best to probe for more details to facilitate your trip north."

This response truly exceeded Wang Quwan's expectations. He was, after all, only an external Foundation Establishment cultivator. He assumed that once the opportunity was submitted, it would go to some young master or Ding Weizeng himself. He truly hadn't thought it would have anything to do with him. He stammered, "This..."

"This what?" Ding Weizeng held the token, laughing. "The Lake has always been fairest toward external clans, guest retainers, and protectors... You don't stay on the isle often, so you don't know. Even a direct descendant of the dignified Purple Mansion wouldn't dare insult a Qi Refining guest retainer without reason. I have even less interest in taking your opportunity... Let's go to the main hall together. It will also put your mind at ease!"

# Chapter 797: Visitors from the Southern Sea

Li Zhouluo sat in the main hall. He had spent the morning dragging Li Zhoufang along to "bitterly plead" with Li Xuanxuan, putting on a masterful performance. Only now did he finally have time to manage the clan's affairs. He set his brush aside, deep in thought.

'Phoenix Tail Stone is exceptionally rare in the northern regions... The main deposits are all within the territory of the Azure Pond Sect... I need to write a letter and ask. Grandfather mentioned he has a disciple on duty in their market; he would be the best one to help.'

The Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails were a precious Purple Mansion Realm formation base. Even with Moongaze Lake's wealth, the clan's own vast mineral savings, and the materials added from the Profound Peak Gate, the remaining deficit was still around fifteen hundred spirit stones.

The Li clan’s spirit stone reserves were down to about six hundred. Yet, Li Zhouluo was not worried about the cost. The more pressing issue was that casting this item wasn't just about having enough spirit stones; it required procuring massive amounts of spiritual materials. This item was scarce, that one in short supply. Even if they had the spirit stones, they couldn't spend them.

'The price of spirit qi within the family is also being driven higher and higher... Several clan members have come to complain... Cultivators from humble backgrounds can no longer afford it, relying solely on the few portions the prefecture allocates to geniuses each year...'

This was an all-too-common problem. The cost of spirit qi suitable for Qi Refining throughout Jiangnan had been inflated to twenty or thirty spirit stones per portion precisely because it was so scarce. The Li clan's rise had granted Moongaze Lake a formidable, organized capability for gathering qi. However, the resulting flood of new cultivators mastering Embyronic Breathing had not alleviated the shortage of Lesser Clear Spirit Qi; it had perversely intensified the demand.

Even more interesting was the fact that without a corresponding cultivation art, this basic qi was useless in one’s hands. The Li clan's rise had brought an unexpected change: as the number of cultivators practicing the "River-Center Clear Qi" art increased, that very resource—unheard of and worthless on the market a century ago—gradually acquired value.

The Li clan, controlling the entirety of Moongaze Lake, could produce a significant amount of River-Center Clear Qi annually. Setting aside the obscene profits of sixty spirit stones per portion made by the Azure Pond Sect's Qi-Plucking Peak, the price of this local resource had climbed to over thirty spirit stones. Without this supply of River-Center Clear Qi, the number of non-clan Qi Refiners in the region would be cut in half.

'The northern shore also has snow mountains near the great river. In the future, we must station people on the river permanently. The River-Center Clear Qi there is even more abundant than at Moongaze Lake... It would be best if we could find a Water Mansion qi-gathering art suitable for lake cultivation.'

He was pondering this while drafting the letter when Dili Guang arrived with a report. Hearing that his two most capable subordinates, Ding Weizeng and Wang Quwan, were reporting, Li Zhouluo felt a jolt of surprise and immediately had them brought in.

"Greetings, Clan Head!"

Ding Weizeng bowed first and explained Wang Quwan's situation. Li Zhouluo listened with great curiosity. The token was passed only to Dili Guang , allowing the Eastern Yue man to inspect it carefully.

Li Zhouluo set his brush down, his expression doubtful.

"The Wanling Upper Sect is indeed a formidable lineage. As for some ‘earth palace’... I doubt it is a virtuous place. Immortals and Buddhists died all over Jiangbei, their conflict shaking heaven and earth; how could it not have been discovered then? If it were re-emerging, why now? Why didn't it appear back when blood qi was rampant, spiritual opportunity was boundless, and the eighteen Buddhist masters fell, dyeing the riverbanks pink? Why wait until today, when the spiritual opportunity has gradually calmed and settled?"

Li Zhouluo’s highborn status meant he understood nearly ninety percent of the truth behind the war between the north and south, and he knew the true principles by which ruins manifested. Suspicion bloomed instantly. He felt it improper to leave two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators bowing, so he rose from his seat, helped both men up, and said softly:

"Currently, the Daoist Master is away, and the elders are in seclusion. I fear this item brings trouble."

Wang Quwan was a clever man and understood the subtext. He replied, "Thank you, Clan Head, for the guidance. I acquired this token as spoils of war and am here to submit it to the clan. I ask only that the clan elders examine it before making a decision."

Li Zhouluo frowned and shook his head. With the clan’s own Purple Mansion Realm expert away, his standing policy was that less trouble was always better. He wouldn't be tempted even if the earth palace contained Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items. He replied:

"The item remains yours. Hold onto it for now and quietly observe the situation. I will report this to the clan elders, and when there is news, I will summon you."

Dili Guang had already handed the token back. Wang Quwan looked slightly stunned and opened his mouth to speak, but Ding Weizeng, quick-witted, accepted it on his behalf. Li Zhouluo turned the conversation:

"The Wang Clan in Jiangbei is suppressed by the major families and has struggled these past years. Wang He of the Capital immortals Dao is your Wang clan’s leader. Has he made any troublesome moves?"

Wang Quwan quickly bowed and replied, "Reporting to the Clan Head, Clan Uncle Wang He has repeatedly sent people over with condolences and has also sent many spiritual resources as aid. However, my younger brother refused them all. These matters have all been reported to the clan..."

Li Jianglong submitted reports monthly, so Li Zhouluo was naturally aware of this. But the matter was important, and he couldn't help but probe one more time. He shook his head.

"Although Wang He is far senior to you and his cultivation is higher, his innate talent is simply abysmal. He is a nobody in the Capital immortals Dao, entirely incomparable to you. Naturally, he will do everything he can to curry favor."

Wang Quwan bowed low. Seeing Ding Weizeng nod beside him, he said respectfully, "Reporting to the Clan Head, the loyalty of the Funan Wang Clan is beyond reproach!"

"I am aware! The Milin Palace has resumed operations. The Wang Clan may send two disciples to enter. Quwan, seeing your own bearing, I trust your disciples will not be lacking. They will certainly achieve great things."

Both men had duties to attend to and quickly took their leave. Li Zhouluo turned his thoughts back to the letter for Li Xizhi's people, deciding to include this matter as well. He was buried in work. As soon as the letter was sent, the situation he had set in motion earlier that morning had finished simmering. It was time to release Li Xixuan.

Li Zhoufang was already waiting outside the hall, the man visibly restraining his anxiety. Seeing Li Zhouluo, he hurried to follow. Li Zhouluo nodded gravely.

"Since the Old Master has agreed, let us go and invite the elder out."

"Thank you, Clan Head!"

Li Zhoufang nodded repeatedly. "Only the Clan Head, by stepping forward to plead this case... could have made the Old Master relent. No matter what,  Grand Uncle Xixuan is still Aunt Minggong’s father. How can we just lock him in the ancestral hall! If he cannot overcome this... and something dreadful happens, what will the family do in the future?"

Li Zhouluo and Li Zhoufang were both Qi Refining cultivators; they covered the short distance in moments. They unfastened the Dharma artifacts from their waists, handing them to a nearby Mount Qingdu cultivator. Removing their shoes, they entered the hall. There, they saw the pale, plump Li Xixuan dressed in a single layer robe, reading at a desk.

Seeing the two enter, Li Xixuan acknowledged the Clan Head, Li Zhouluo, with a slight nod before immediately sitting back down.

"Congratulations, Grand Uncle! The Clan Head pleaded bitterly with the Old Master and has finally secured your release..."

"Oh..."

Li Zhoufang, his face bright with joy, invited the old man to leave, but the elder merely seemed listless and utterly disinterested.

The drama staged by Li Xuanxuan and Li Zhouluo might have fooled ninety percent of the clan, but it could not deceive elders like Li Xixuan and Li Chengzhi. Li Xixuan immediately recognized the duet; his own biological grandson, Li Zhoufang, was the one truly left on the outside. He sat desolately by the desk.

With the old man refusing to cooperate, Li Zhoufang could only pace anxiously. As the eldest brother, caught between both parties, he was in an impossible position. Li Zhouluo smiled.

"Big Brother, please wait outside for a moment. I would like to chat with Grand Uncle alone."

Li Zhoufang immediately retreated. Li Xixuan leaned weakly against the desk. He watched as the young man personally poured him a cup of tea.

"Grand Uncle," Li Zhouluo said softly, "your courtyard holds nineteen children and nephews, and over a hundred grandchildren. The Yuanwan Branch possesses only this single manor in the prefecture. You are struggling under the burden of managing these hundred people. The Old Master... he sees this."

At this mention, Li Xixuan’s spirits suddenly revived. He shook his head heavily. "Do you, who sit in the high halls, truly understand this bitterness? These children of mine... they possess no spiritual apertures. The very moment the family divides, they become minor branches. One day they are descendants of immortals; the next, they are packing their bags to go perform hard labor by the shore. If I split the family just like that, will they not hate me? Will they not hate the clan?"

He sighed deeply. "This old man does not dare to divide them... Not dividing means over a hundred people remain squeezed into a single manor. Relatives, you see... they are useless when at the far ends of the earth, and merciless when pressed right before your eyes. Only when they are neither too far nor too close, a presence that almost isn't, are they comfortable. Right now, a friction starts in the east, an argument breaks out in the west... does this not wound our kinship? What can I do? This old body doesn't have many years left. The moment I die, they *will* split the family. The few main lineages will be comfortable, but those cast out will begin to hate. Is this not an omen of our decline?"

"Keeping them trapped in the courtyard now, letting them resent one another, is still better than dividing them later and having them unite in their resentment of the prefecture. This old man can understand you all, but you... you cannot understand this old man. Perhaps this truly is the difference between immortal and mortal..."

Li Zhouluo remained silent. He had heard whispers of Li Xixuan's situation. He poured the elder another cup of tea and said only this:

"The prefecture’s patronage quotas have been set. There are several positions. Mount Qingdu and the Jade Court will conduct the evaluations jointly. I will make the final ruling."

Li Xixuan’s eyes flew wide, staring round. His entire demeanor shifted in an instant. His back straightened, and he leaned forward urgently.

"The Clan Head means..."

Li Zhouluo spoke in a low voice, "The evaluation criteria are largely the same things Mount Qingdu monitors daily. This was not supposed to be announced for another month... The prefecture has many clan members who study diligently, work hard, and have received commendations from Qingdu. Grand Uncle should begin preparations early."

Li Xixuan was a shrewd old man. His expression became animated. He nodded repeatedly, "I understand... I understand... What are the ranks of these positions, and how many are there?"

Li Zhouluo merely smiled, shook his head, and rose to his feet. Li Xixuan shot up from his seat, his eyes suddenly turning red.

"Thank you, Clan Head... Thank you, Clan Head, for pleading with the Old Master... The Yuanwan Branch has many good children. They are counting on this... this is their salvation..."

Li Zhouluo didn't seem like someone who possessed such authority on his own. Li Xixuan knew that this "patronage" was ninety-nine percent the work of his own grandfather (Li Xizhi). But the final right to rule lay in Li Zhouluo’s hands. Li Xixuan seized the step down that had been offered. Hiking up his robes, he hurried out the door, only to see the utterly baffled face of Li Zhoufang.

"Clan Head!"

Seeing Li Zhouluo was already departing, Li Xixuan urgently grabbed Li Zhoufang. "Quickly, Eldest! Get me back to the prefecture!"

"Oh, oh, okay!"

Li Zhoufang, completely bewildered, pulled him along as they rushed toward the prefecture center. Li Xixuan slapped his own thigh and hissed:

"I need you to run another errand. Find those few bastards who are sneaking around idling in the prefecture and call every last one of them back..."

***

While the two hurried back to the prefecture, Li Zhouluo landed before his own hall. Dili Guang was pacing frantically, like an ant on a hot skillet. The moment he saw Li Zhouluo, he cried out:

"Aiyo... Clan Head! People from the Azure Pond Sect are here! They have been waiting in the side hall. You left so suddenly, I couldn't find you... I notified the Old Master, and he just arrived himself..."

Li Zhouluo quickly pushed the doors open. Sure enough, Li Xuanxuan was standing in the middle of the hall, looking anxious. Seeing Li Zhouluo, he said immediately, "Quickly, invite them in!"

Li Zhouluo straightened his robes just as two figures walked quickly up the outer steps. The one in the lead wore silvery-white attire, draped in a magnificent, embroidered red cloak. He had a round face and large eyes. The man following him was handsome and slender, with fair skin and a sword at his waist.

Beside them trailed a guard-like figure, dressed in black robes, tall and thin, with a sinister and vicious aura. It was the Hooked Serpent , Li Wushao. The demon snake, who had been stuck at the peak of the late Foundation Establishment Realm for a long time, bowed to both Li Xuanxuan and Li Zhouluo.

The red-robed youth in the lead bowed, his round face breaking into a handsome smile. "Quan Yuduan of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion greets the Clan Head!"

The youth behind him glanced around the hall’s decor with open curiosity before following suit with a bow. "Si Xunhui, of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, greets the Clan Head..."

"Please, please rise..."

These were Li Xizhi's own disciples. Li Zhouluo felt an instinctive warmth toward them. He hurried to help them up. "Esteemed cultivators, are you resting at our lake by coincidence, or are you here bearing instructions from my grandfather?"

The instant he said the word "grandfather," the way Quan Yuduan looked at him changed completely. He quickly took a step back and bowed respectfully.

"So it seems you are the Young Master! My Third Junior Brother and I rushed here from the Southern Sea, entirely unaware that the Young Master was managing the household..."

Quan Yuduan had assumed Li Wushao's bow had been for Li Xuanxuan; only now did he realize it was for this young man. He nodded, overjoyed. "The Young Master's cultivation speed is astonishing! Excellent, excellent... truly worthy of this bloodline..."

Beside him, Si Xunhui raised an eyebrow, his gaze filled with envy.

There were few family backgrounds in all of Jiangnan capable of making Si Xunhui envious. This was the first time Li Zhouluo had been addressed as "Young Master," and it felt awkward. He looked up. "My grandfather... how is he now?"

At the mere mention of Li Xizhi , Quan Yuduan’s face lit up, and he beamed.

"The lake must not have heard the news... My Master's reputation as the Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow now shakes the entire Southern Sea! From Lufang to Danrong Wuluo, everyone knows his name. Never mind those demonic cultivators... even the Clan Head of the Thunder Island's Miao Family came to spar and was no match for him! He was beaten until rosy light overflowed his body. If my Master had not intervened to dispel it... that old man would have perished on the spot!"

"Master now governs all nineteen islands of the Azure Pond Sect in the Southern Sea, and he has swept the entire sea region clean of demonic cultivators! The sacrificial resentment arts that the Lingu Family couldn't eradicate in three generations have now been almost completely severed at the root. The four directions are at peace, and the market's reputation and resources have multiplied several times over, filling all the deficits from the previous years..."

Li Xuanxuan threw his head back and laughed. Si Xunhui, also clearly moved, added softly:

"My own Daoist Master also met my Master. After they discussed Dharma arts, he called him a heaven-sent genius. He later told us juniors... that my Master’s attainment in the Heavenly Glow Dao already far surpasses the Lingu Xia of old, and has perhaps even eclipsed the very Daoist who first adapted the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique... He called him the undisputed foremost practitioner of heavenly glow arts in the last three hundred years!"

Li Zhouluo was filled with astonishment. Li Xuanxuan, stroking his beard, let out a long, deep sigh and couldn't help but ask, "Where were these words spoken? Has this news already spread throughout the Southern Sea?"

Si Xunhui quickly shook his head. "This was heard in a private conversation. I only repeated it to my Senior Brother. It has not spread... Master instructed me to remember this but not to publicize it... It is only because I am meeting the elders today that I could not help but share the joyous news."

"Good, good, good!" Li Xuanxuan's eyes grew moist. "Zhi'er is truly formidable... To have walked this far, all alone in the sect... his path was no easier than any of his brothers'... Good... This is truly wonderful..."

# Chapter 798: The Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda

As Si Xunhui finished speaking, Quan Yuduan immediately stepped forward and lowered his voice.

“Master sent us this time for two reasons. First, a sect mission required me to escort Junior Brother here. Second… I have something extremely important to deliver.”

Li Zhouluo understood at once. With a lift of his chin, Dili Guang led the contingent of guards out, and the hall fell empty in an instant.

Quan Yuduan spoke softly, “Master is guarding the Southern Sea. He has completely overturned the blood-essence resentment system that the Chi and Lingu clans ran for over two hundred years. He simultaneously eradicated the demonic cultivators throughout the entire Shitang Island system under his jurisdiction. With the disciples of the five peaks he leads acting as a barrier, he transformed the islands under his rule into territories filled with smaller sects, minor islands, and lesser factions…

“From then on, they used those islands as their foundation. Several nearby demonic sects, large and small, came to raid. But as soon as they made a move, Master slaughtered virtually all their high-level cultivators… Since then, the entire Shitang Island system has been peaceful. The markets are also a cut above. Southern Sea cultivators are now willing to travel several extra days and nights just to visit the Shitang markets…

“Now, all commerce in the northern Southern Sea flows toward Shitang. This has, consequently, offended Thunder-Hearing Island. Fortunately, Daoist Master Yuanxiu is at the height of his prestige, so Master is naturally fine. He just warned the family to be careful, as he fears someone might retaliate.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded silently, his heart sinking. Li Zhouwei had spoken to him about the Southern Sea. Most of those demonic cultivators were actually fostered by Thunder-Hearing Island. This was probably about far more than just grabbing market profits.

'Daoist Master Yuanxiu likely did this intentionally,' the old man thought. 'Transferring Zhi-er to the chaotic Southern Sea and then ordering him to reorganize the markets. The Si Clan gets all the profit, while Zhi-er is forced to bind himself even tighter to them…'

While his mind was turning, Quan Yuduan retrieved a colorful, glazed pagoda from his sleeve. It was only the size of a finger, small and exquisite. He held the pagoda in his palm and said in a low voice:

“Master specifically had me bring this artifact back. It is called the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda. It was an artifact from an ancient Southern Sea sect that resurfaced a few years ago, and Master spent enormous effort to acquire it.”

Li Wushao took the item and handed it to Li Xuanxuan. Though the object was merely thumb-sized, the old man felt it sink heavily in his hand, almost dropping it. He looked at Quan Yuduan.

“Young Master, this Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda is an extremely special and wondrous artifact that can be used to temper disciples. It has twenty-four levels. Every sixth level has a doorway, which, when opened, unleashes water, fire, wind, and thunder. From bottom to top, they are respectively: Supreme He Fire, Crop-Injuring Wind, Autumn-Perishing Water, and Northern Palace Thunder.”

“As for the remaining twenty levels without doorways, each has a considerable capacity and can be used to store related spiritual items. When locked within, the pagoda can be connected to a spirit vein to preserve the spiritual items. It is extremely useful.”

This looked like an artifact meant to guard a sect gate, the equivalent of a foundational treasure. If it were a Dharma Artifact, it would be something that anchors the sect's destiny, even for major lineages like the Azure Pond Sect or the Golden Feather Sect.

He shook his red robes and explained:

“Master checked carefully. This should be a replica of a pagoda created by an ancient lineage to help disciples avoid the 'Three Disasters and Nine Calamities'. But even if it’s a modern lineage's replica, to us, it still comes from an extremely ancient past…

“Nowadays, there is no longer a need to avoid any 'Three Disasters', so this ancient artifact's effectiveness is greatly reduced, but it remains a rare treasure, integrating punishment and tempering into one.”

His eyes filled with admiration as he praised it endlessly.

“The Supreme He Fire refines True Essence. Within that doorway are three types of potent Merging Fire that have been highly refined and neutralized. The Crop-Injuring Wind expels distracting thoughts; its doorway holds six types of spiritual wind, all possessing clarifying abilities. The Autumn-Perishing Water washes away vanity; its doorway contains twelve types of spiritual waters from the Pristine, Converging, and Pit Water daos…”

It truly was an incredibly wondrous artifact. Li Zhouluo knew immediately it was ancient; only ancient cultivators were this extravagant. The spiritual items sealed within, if dismantled and sold, would likely represent more than half the entire savings of an old Foundation Establishment family.

But Quan Yuduan stopped abruptly at that point. Li Zhouluo couldn't help asking, “But isn't there still the Northern Palace Thunder at the very top?”

Quan Yuduan hesitated for a breath, then nodded.

“The Northern Palace Thunder… erm… it can also kill… in combat. This doorway contains twenty-four types of lightning… Contrary to the previous ones, these twenty-four types are all Profound Thunder, specifically pointing toward the four divine abilities of Profound Thunder…”

“It’s very convenient for killing people. If it strikes the body, it can blast them directly into ash.”

“This…”

Li Zhouluo and Li Xuanxuan exchanged a look. The old man nodded. “So the highest doorway is for defense and killing enemies. Truly profound and wondrous.”

Si Xunhui chuckled. This was his Master's grandfather, after all; he remained very respectful. He cupped his hands.

“My lord, according to the Daoist Master, the creator of this artifact was deeply dissatisfied with the Thunder Palace. The first three doorways, though agonizing, all leave a sliver of life, and one can even receive various benefits. But this top doorway exclusively uses Profound Thunder. Not only is there no benefit whatsoever, but it also refuses to stop until the person is struck dead… The Daoist Master said the specification of twenty-four paths is extremely high… He said that person… must have been struck miserably when they broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm…”

“…Oh… haha…”

Since it was a joke from a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, even if it wasn't particularly funny, the two men in the hall had to laugh. Li Xuanxuan coughed out a few laughs, beautifully admiring the thumb-sized pagoda in his hand.

'This is an excellent artifact to suppress Mount Qingdu,' he thought. 'In the past, when the family punished those cultivators, we just docked some merits or, at worst, sent them to the periphery. Actually killing them was too much… We lacked anything truly intimidating. With this artifact, it is beneficial in many ways.'

The Li family's Milin Mountains already had an ancient artifact suppressing it called Stray Fragrance, an incense burner that could regulate the ley lines and store spiritual energy. For the last ten-odd years, the spiritual energy had been flowing in and out of Milin.

Quan Yuduan smiled. “Old Ancestor, don't be hasty. I have more.”

He took a storage bag from his sleeve and explained, “Inside are four stalks of treasure medicines. They are Azure Reverence Flower, Zi-Wu Vine, Profound-Patterned Yellow Viper Fruit, and Untraceable Grass. There are also three Foundation Establishment spiritual items, and over one hundred and fifty spirit stones, to subsidize the family.”

Li Zhouluo took the heavy storage bag and secured it. Quan Yuduan then retrieved a letter from his sleeve, his expression turning solemn.

“This… Master entrusted this to me, requesting that I personally deliver it to Chenghuai and bring back a reply. I was wondering…”

Li Xuanxuan frowned, hesitating. “Chenghuai is in seclusion. Since it is so important… I will send someone to ask him.”

When Quan Yuduan heard this, he quickly waved his hands and replied, “The matter is important, but it is not urgent. If he is in seclusion, we can certainly wait. I will finish the business I have on hand, and I still have to pass by the lake on the way back. I can see the young master then. It will not be too late.”

“Right now, there is another critical matter. Back when Daoist Master Zhaojing visited Chengyun Gate, it was decided that Moongaze would have a share of the Xiaoshi Mountain Dao Repository. Has your clan's cultivator reached the Foundation Establishment Realm? The time is near. I also came today to escort my junior brother there.”

He nodded slightly and stepped aside. Clearly, the next words were not his to say. Even as the senior disciple of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, he could not speak on behalf of the Si Clan. Si Xunhui stepped forward, cupping his hands.

“Since your clan's cultivator is also going, we ask that you trouble yourself to bring this junior along.”

'The Xiaoshi Mountain Dao Repository?'

Li Zhouluo looked thoughtful and glanced up, but Li Xuanxuan stopped him. Li Zhouluo didn't know the details of these matters, but the old man knew much more. His aged voice sounded:

“There is a Foundation Establishment sword cultivator on the lake. He was raised from obscurity by Daoist Master Zhaojing himself. His Immortal Foundation is the Floating Cloud Body, which is precisely from the Xiaoshi Mountain lineage.”

“He already reached Foundation Establishment!”

Si Xunhui was startled. Neither his Si Clan nor the Li family were Purple Mansion powers who had known about this firsthand; they had joined the endeavor much later. After all, it was hard to find a suitable Embryonic Breathing candidate, and even if they found one, it was difficult to raise their cultivation level in a short time. He mulled this over internally:

'And he's an outsider. That's good. If it were truly a relative of Master, some uncle or elder, it would be extremely awkward when we had to compete for things… An outsider is good. Daoist Master Zhaojing isn't greedy.'

Thus, the Si Clan direct descendant replied, “It is indeed the Floating Cloud Body. With your clan's senior here to watch over things, this junior also feels at ease.”

Li Zhouluo immediately went personally to summon Wang Quwan. Li Xuanxuan, meanwhile, stroked his beard and asked, “I read the clan reports. It said Chengyun Gate captured two cultivators, and an underground palace appeared beneath Chengshui Marsh. Is this true? According to the report, the palace is a ruin of the ancient Wanling Upper Sect…”

Si Xunhui shook his head silently. Quan Yuduan, however, was far more impulsive and direct. He replied:

“Of course that's just what Chengyun Gate spread themselves! It's true they caught cultivators, but they just used them to lure out the Xiaoshi Mountain cultivator, thereby fulfilling the conditions to open the Dao Repository.”

“As for some underground palace, I've never heard of it! What kind of lineage is the Wanling Upper Sect? If they really built an underground palace, anyone entering would just be seeking death. If you ask me… Chengyun Gate built it themselves!”

Si Xunhui's information was clearly more comprehensive. He spoke softly, “It is highly likely Chengyun Gate built it themselves. One reason is to provide a training ground for their own disciples. Second, collecting blood qi everywhere is inconvenient. If they suppress the families under their command for too long, resentment inevitably builds. This palace is much more useful.”

“And they can sell talismans and pills on the side, making their sect's legitimate business easier… After all, their items are crude and simply cannot compete with Jiangnan. Using this method, they can continuously and reliably profit from the local area.”

Li Xuanxuan understood and nodded. Li Zhouluo had already returned, bringing Wang Quwan up from outside the hall. The middle-aged man still wore his sword, his expression grave. Li Zhouluo smiled.

“Protector Wang, this is the First Disciple of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, Quan Yuduan… And this… is Young Master Si Xunhui of the Azure Pond Si Clan.”

These two names might not sound too terrifying to the current Li family, but in Wang Quwan's eyes, they were absolute top-tier young masters. The Si Clan now ruled the Azure Pond Sect. He quickly moved to bow, but he heard Si Xunhui call out:

“Greetings, Senior. We… will be troubling you this time.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded lightly and spoke. “These two disciples from the immortal sects are heading to that underground palace and were passing through. Since you also received the opportunity, you will go together.”

“How can this be permissible?... Such an opportunity should go to the direct line of Moongaze…”

Wang Quwan's first reaction was panic. He tried to bow lower, but Quan Yuduan understood the situation. He gave a meaningful look and smilingly interrupted:

“The scenery of Moongaze Lake is beautiful. We brothers will take a stroll on the lake and return later.”

He pulled Si Xunhui away. Li Xuanxuan waved his hand, and Li Zhouluo also retreated, leaving only the two of them in the hall. Wang Quwan knelt firmly. Li Xuanxuan helped him up, speaking softly:

“Quwan, rest assured. You are not being sent as a pawn. Although Si Xunhui is a young master of the Azure Pond Sect, this time you are not meant to protect him… If they really needed protection, why wouldn't Azure Pond just send two Peak Lords?”

This sentence startled Wang Quwan. He quickly raised his eyebrows. The old man before him was smiling and nodding.

“This time, you are representing the Moongaze Li Clan. Although I do not know the situation in the underground palace, few families should trouble you right now. Foundation Establishment cultivators have their own opponents. Protect yourself, and see what opportunities you can fight for.”

“As for Si Xunhui, do not fear him too much. Whatever should be shared, you take your rightful share. Unless it is a spiritual item of the Purple Mansion level—in that case, you must let him take it, so that you can stay alive…”

Wang Quwan finally nodded, his voice respectful. “This subordinate will remember the Old Master's instructions and will do my absolute best…”

Li Xuanxuan continued, “As you head out, go find Zhouluo. Get the Hundred-Stone Spirit Shield and the Crimson Orb Jade of the Profound Peak Gate from him. After all, the palace is filled with the direct descendants of Purple Mansion lineages. We are not asking you to gain great prestige, but with these two items for protection, at least you will not be completely suppressed by a single artifact.”

These were two complete Foundation Establishment artifacts. The Hundred-Stone Spirit Shield was of ordinary quality, but the Crimson Orb Jade was an exceptionally rare treasure. Wang Quwan nodded heavily, finally saying:

“Quwan will remember the main family's grace. I will certainly bring both of these artifacts back fully intact from this trip north.”

Only then did Li Xuanxuan see him out, instructing Li Zhouluo to equip him with the artifacts. Wang Quwan, however, set the items down, stating solemnly:

“This matter is significant. Please allow this subordinate to return home first and instruct my descendants. I will then return to retrieve the two artifacts.”

He rode the wind toward Jiangbei. Si Xunhui and Quan Yuduan, who said they were going to tour the lake, flew a circle. Li Wushao returned early.

The old demon still wore his middle-aged appearance, wearing a sword at his waist. Upon seeing Li Xuanxuan, he bowed, his voice low and hoarse:

“Wushao greets the Old Master!”

Li Wushao's appearance greatly resembled Li Yuanjiao. Li Xuanxuan stared, dazzled, and quickly helped him up, tears welling in the corners of his eyes.

“It has been many days…”

Li Wushao saw this and cupped his hands. “Old Master! I’m having a great time at Azure Pond! In that damn place, everyone calls me Lord Li. But if I take a trip to the Eastern Sea, and they don't recognize me, shit, they might even try to capture me for alchemy… Haha…”

The old man couldn't help but laugh, shaking his head. “You still speak so crudely, even after entering an immortal sect… You can't shake those Eastern Sea habits. People will talk about you…”

“Can't learn! Won't learn!”

Li Wushao said, “They have to say I'm 'frank and passionate,' 'unrestrained and free.' I say it's all bullshit… Anyway, I've returned and taken a look around, so I have something to report back to the Pavilion Master. The young master isn't married yet, is he?”
