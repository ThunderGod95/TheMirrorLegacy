# Chapter 1049: Deceit

A faint crimson still pulsed on the horizon as the sun went down. The lavishly dressed Demon beast turned, clutching his magnificent cloak for warmth, and looked at the Daoist Master beside him.

"Daoist Master Chi, would you consider this man a fiend?"

Chi Buzi glanced back at him, his expression placid, almost matter-of-fact.

"He's all bluster and no substance. A pathetic, despicable whelp—nothing more than a petty demon."

The Demon beast smiled.

"Isn't that perfect? My subordinate only used a divine ability to influence the woman; all of his actions stemmed from his own heart, from the inherent evil of the Bright Yang. In my eyes, that's more than enough."

"He serves a purpose. He can lend a hand with matters that Minghuang has no time for."

'Minghuang... that’s Li Zhouwei…'

A strange and unsettling feeling, tinged with suspicion, crept into Chi Buzi’s heart. The Demon beast’s expression remained serene as he studied Chi Buzi closely.

"I am Dingjiao, the White Flood Dragon of the Clear Seas and Serene Pools, Inheritor of the Azure."

Chi Buzi took a sip of wine.

"So, you are the White Dragon's crown prince. I am Chi Buzi, a rogue cultivator."

Of course, Chi Buzi had heard the name. Dingjiao was a prodigy of the White Dragon clan, a direct descendant of the Dragon Monarch himself. His bloodline was pure and noble, making him one of the most distinguished members of the Hornless Dragon lineage.

Dragons were by nature licentious yet utterly heartless. They would mate even with their own kind, including siblings, though such unions rarely produced offspring. In contrast, their liaisons with various Demon beasts were far more fruitful, though most of these children were treated as mere servants. Only the few with a pure bloodline earned the right to be called a Dragon Prince. Take the Demon King of Xu Water—in truth, he was a noble Demon Perch and a son of Dragon King Beihai, yet he was forced to call a pure-blooded heir like Dingjiao 'master'!

'Moreover, he’s a descendant of Dongfang You, which makes him a direct heir of the Dragon Monarch. If the Dragon-kin succeed in their great undertaking, his status will skyrocket. He could very well ascend to a golden throne himself one day!'

The Daoist Master slowly averted his gaze, making a subtle swallowing motion. 

"I see only a pitiful villain. The Bright Yang Fruition Attainment influenced Li Zhouwei, and by extension, it has influenced his son. This is an undeniable fact. Why go to such lengths to prove it?"

The Dragon Monarch shook his head, his expression unreadable.

"It's not that simple. From a Daoist perspective, Minghuang was favored by the Fruition Attainment, so it’s natural he would develop a Bright Yang temperament. But he is a man of profound schemes, his true nature hidden behind a facade. He is also unbound by divine abilities, so who can truly know what he is like? My elders have always felt his humanity outweighs his Metallic Essence, making it difficult for him to achieve the Dao…"

"They tried to test him, but they failed. Still, there’s no need to test him directly."

The Dragon Monarch smiled.

"What a father keeps silent, his naive young son will surely speak aloud. The sons of this world carry their fathers' secrets, and they expose them unwittingly, forcing the fathers to confront their own ugliness. This is what you cultivators call the Sin of the Yang Cusp."

"So, we just need to test this Li Jiangnian. If he truly possesses that Bright Yang evil, how could his father be free of it?"

Chi Buzi fell silent, though a new question arose in his mind.

'The Dragon-kin are testing Li Zhouwei to gauge the possibility of the Bright Yang. It's a brilliant move, certainly, but what does it have to do with me? I have no claim to the Bright Yang position, nor do I have any connection to the Li family. Why tell me all this? It’s as if he thinks I’m one of them…'

Dingjiao, however, shook his head.

"But my father still dislikes it. He always worries… after ascending to that position… he will be a True Monarch. How can he be manipulated? It’s far too uncontrollable… But I see things differently."

His pale blue eyes flickered as he smiled.

"I am certain the prophecy will be fulfilled, and I believe my Dragon-kin must ally with these True Monarchs…"

Hearing this, a shadow of gloom finally fell over Chi Buzi.

"Oh?"

Dingjiao stated flatly,

"However… whether it’s my father’s opinion or my own, we are both in complete agreement regarding the Great Daoist Master's matter."

A cold, mocking smile spread through Chi Buzi’s heart.

'Agreement? How could they not agree? Forget you Dragon-kin, even Pristine Water is in full agreement… Who wouldn't want to lure out that Feathered Serpent's Metallic Essence? The only one no one cares about is me… I’m just supposed to die quietly in a corner. Am I supposed to agree to that as well?!'

The Dragon Monarch stared at him, seemingly reading the emotion in his eyes. He let out a soft sigh.

"There are some things Li Zhouwei cannot spare the time for, nor can he necessarily contact the person behind him. It would be difficult for me to discuss this with him… But discussing it with you, Chi Buzi, is it not the same thing?"

He turned his head, his pale blue dragon eyes fixed on Chi Buzi.

"Great Daoist Master, am I right?"

Chi Buzi’s eyes narrowed instantly. A thick fog of confusion filled his mind, but his natural talent for deception kept his face a dark, unreadable mask. He said nothing, merely taking a sip of wine before murmuring,

"I must admit my confusion. On what grounds does the Dragon Monarch make such a claim?"

His words brought a slight smile to Dingjiao's lips. Leaning forward, he said calmly,

"Back then, you were merely at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, still trapped under Lord Du's thumb, unable to act freely. Yet while he was in seclusion, you slipped away to Moongaze Lake. After that, your entire demeanor changed. You roamed the seas, often acting erratically, and then, for no reason at all, you broke through to the Purple Mystery—for absolutely no reason!"

His smile faded.

"Lord Du might not know about these things, but we Dragon-kin certainly do. If our high-ranking members hadn't been cleaning up your messes, do you think Lord Du became a True Monarch for nothing? Do you really think you’d still be alive today?"

Dingjiao's gaze turned icy, carrying a palpable sense of intimidation. The unspoken meaning behind his words was crystal clear.

'You went to great lengths to visit Penglai, presenting the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch that appeared out of nowhere. You fabricated that grotto and led the Chunyi Dao Gate completely astray. We saw everything. We were the ones who cleaned up the mess for you!'

"Our Lord Du has never hesitated—he’d rather kill the wrong person than let one slip by!"

Chi Buzi lowered his head, eyes narrowed. His mind felt as if mountains were collapsing, yet it was also a complete blank, as if he had plunged into a bottomless abyss.

'Me? What did I do?'

Dingjiao’s attitude didn't seem like a bluff. A descendant of the Dragon Monarch had no need to deceive him with such baseless nonsense. Either the Dragon King before him was mistaken about something… or… the Dragon-kin had truly covered up some terrible misdeed for him, keeping it hidden from Pristine Water!

'Why do I know nothing about this?!'

But no matter how baffling his words were, no matter how desperately Chi Buzi racked his brain, his expression remained perfectly calm.

Dingjiao smiled.

"In all the world… which other family can produce a Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch!"

"The cultivation method was given to you by Lord Xuan'an, wasn't it? It was there, at Moongaze Lake, under the gaze of the Azure Insight Origin Mirror, that you received his guidance. Only then did you have your great awakening, gaining some unknowable benefit before setting out to roam the four seas!"

'Xuan'an… Who is that…'

The name was a complete blur to Chi Buzi. He didn't know how to respond, so he simply lowered his eyes and said nothing, allowing a complex look to cross his face.

Dingjiao waited. Seeing no answer, he continued in a level tone, "Don't worry. Now that Wei Xuanyin has placed the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal in your hands, it signifies the approval of the Profound Governance Pavilion, and by extension, Mount Luoxia. With our guarantee, even if Pristine Water discovers something, he still won't kill you."

A flicker of amusement appeared in his eyes. "But you are in the Pristine Pool, and Pristine Water is full of suspicion. How Lord Xuan'an will protect his schemes with you from under Pristine Water’s nose, how he will get the fox clan to contact you… that is his problem to solve."

Chi Buzi was no fool. After hearing these two sentences, the threads of a plot began to form in his mind.

'First… this Lord Xuan'an must be the True Monarch behind the fox clan…'

'And Moongaze Lake… it must be his territory. That’s why Dingjiao sees me as his man, whether it's a misunderstanding or the truth…'

'The Li family also has his shadow behind them—at the very least, this True Monarch wants that Li Zhouwei to achieve the Dao! And I, as the Great Daoist Master representing his interests, am being used by the Dragon-kin as a messenger!'

'In other words, in the eyes of the dragons, I am extremely close to Li Zhouwei. Li Jiangnian’s situation might involve some transaction or proof between two True Monarchs, and I am here as a representative. That’s why they invited me to watch this little show!'

His earlier confusion vanished in a flash. Chi Buzi finally understood why Dingjiao had sought him out. But as he uncovered this hidden truth, a chilling dread filled him, followed by the realization of his new reality—no matter what, he now had to be the man of this so-called True Monarch Xuan'an.

He raised his brows and said softly, "That is not something the Dragon Monarch needs to worry about."

Dingjiao just smiled, but Chi Buzi’s ambition swelled in an instant, filling his entire being.

What was the root cause of his distrust for the Dragon-kin? It was that they had no absolute need for him, and he lacked the backing to negotiate with them as an equal! If he could truly borrow the authority of a True Monarch—not to fake an alliance, but to genuinely join his side—then he still had a chance!

'The most urgent task is to investigate this True Monarch Xuan'an!'

His thoughts moved like lightning. He withdrew his hand, his expression inscrutable. "In that case, your noble lord must have known long ago that I intend to cultivate the Water Mansion."

His response was perfectly timed. Dingjiao chuckled. "How could we not know? The Water Mansion belongs to 'Azure Profoundity'. In this day and age, how many people have the ability to even touch it!"

This sentence sent another chill through Chi Buzi’s heart.

After his laugh, Dingjiao saw that he still didn't respond and sighed internally.

'Xuan'an's condition is truly poor… Moongaze Lake has the Azure Insight Origin Mirror, which prevents the other lords from prying. But Lord Tang is personally guarding the lake! That Qingyu Qian merely brought a member of the Department family into the lake for a moment, and that person was immediately exiled and destroyed… The defenses are airtight…'

As his thoughts raced, Chi Buzi looked up, cleverly shaking his head. "I see now," he said faintly. "Senior Zeng Zan's appearance today was not without reason. It was the crown prince who granted me this role."

Dingjiao laughed. "Zeng Zan is close to the Black Dragon faction. You could say this was granted to you by Guangfou."

At the mention of Guangfou, Dingjiao showed little displeasure. Unlike his father, Dragon King Beihai, this White Dragon prince was more ambitious and driven. Though he disliked the Black Dragon faction, he held a certain fondness for Guangfou and similarly hoped to draw more True Monarchs to the Dragon-kin's side. But his father’s command was difficult to defy… otherwise, he wouldn't have volunteered to come and test Li Jiangnian today.

Chi Buzi’s gaze shifted slightly as he watched him. Dingjiao spoke softly, 

"Lord Xuan'an was willing to bring out the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch and place it in the hands of the Chunyi Dao Gate. My Dragon-kin saw this and were quite pleased. My lord was full of praise when he heard… saying that Lord Xuan'an has finally seen the bigger picture, made a sacrifice, and will no longer cling to his so-called pristine purity…"

Chi Buzi frowned, seizing the opportunity to ask in a low voice, "I am not entirely clear on this matter. I would ask for your guidance."

Dingjiao frowned slightly and said earnestly, "When Jiequn perished while attempting to attain the Dao, it already proved that there might be a problem with the Supreme Yin position. Yet everyone remains wary. Some unknown True Monarch specifically wrote a book, the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity, and secretly slipped it into the legacy of the Chunyi Dao Gate… forging Jiequn's last testament to deceive them."

"This Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity is indeed a breakthrough method, but its secret arts also point directly to the very root of the Supreme Yin. It uses the life-mandate of the Dao-seeker, combined with a spiritual item from the Supreme Yin Auxiliary Position, to resonate with the main position and probe the truth of the Fruition Attainment's master from within the Supreme Yin's haze…"

"The truth of a Fruition Attainment is normally impossible to see, but the original master of the Supreme Yin left behind a failsafe, locking one Auxiliary Position and keeping it illuminated so that future generations could ascend… It was this very failsafe that the method exploited."

The Dragon Monarch flicked his sleeve.

"Attaining the Dao through a spiritual item using this method can greatly advance the True Monarchs' speculations about the Supreme Yin. Once the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch achieves its Dao and senses the Great Void, the truth will be revealed. Perhaps then, the matter of the Supreme Yin position will finally be settled."

The sky gradually darkened. Chi Buzi sat in his seat and said grimly, "Then what are you lords waiting for? And what do the Dragon-kin… need?"

Dingjiao answered quietly, "We wait for the world to be at peace, for the True Qi to be proven, for the True Dragons to appear, for the Bright Yang to fall, and for the Upper Shaman to return. Once all the great houses have settled their affairs and the lords have returned to their positions, Donghua Heaven will descend. The long-standing mystery of yin and yang must have a resolution. As for you…"

"Daoist Master, can you wait until that time?"

Dingjiao lowered his voice. "As for us… I don't know what plans the great one has for you, but my lord hopes… that you, Great Daoist Master, will accept this role. Once your divine ability is perfected, you will act as a hidden trump card for our Dragon-kin, ready to intervene in Jiangbei at the critical moment."

The Demon beast looked at him intently. "This helps you, it helps him, and it helps us."

Chi Buzi was silent for a long time. The figure before him had already dissipated like the wind. The colossal beast sank soundlessly into the depths of the sea, taking the vast, glittering palace with it, leaving not a single trace behind.

'Xuan'an… I must investigate him thoroughly…'

The bright moon hung high in the sky, casting its brilliant light upon the world. Chi Buzi stared at the empty surface of the sea as the turmoil in his heart slowly subsided. He watched the ebb and flow of the tide.

'But Pristine Water… is he really ignoring me?'

'Why would a being like him tolerate my actions… allowing me to join the Dragon-kin's camp without a care, unconcerned about a potential new True Monarch-level enemy in the future…'

'Is that even possible?'

He slowly lifted his head, his gaze fixed on the gleaming moon.

'Or… are Dingjiao and the Dragon-kin deceiving me, just like Pristine Water? Do they both have absolute confidence… that I will never succeed?'

# Chapter 1050: Six Harmonies

The river surged, its waters churning violently. A long, pale-green stone wall, etched with mysterious patterns, stood firm against the relentless assault of the waves. High above on a magnificent veranda, a man in crimson robes gazed into the distance, his expression somber.

Beside him stood a man in black, who appeared more mature and possessed a much deeper cultivation. He wore a polite smile.

"You've worked hard, brother-in-law," he said. "The Changrang Army is now stationed on the bank. You can leave this place to me."

Addressed as such, the man in crimson turned, revealing a face with well-defined features. It was Li Jiangzong, now in charge of affairs, having successfully emerged from his seclusion after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The man in black was Sima Xunhui, the husband of Li Queyi. Since Li Queyi and Li Jiangzong were siblings born of the same father, their bond was exceptionally close, which naturally extended to a warm relationship with Sima Xunhui.

Li Jiangzong sighed. "Then I'll leave it in your hands, brother-in-law."

Sima Xunhui was a man adept at leveraging connections. Whatever his private thoughts, he always managed to maintain harmonious relationships between the various families.

"I visited the lake once, years ago," he said with a warm smile. "I still remember how the scenery of the lake and river are the jewels of Jiangnan. I even fished on the river. Being stationed here now is a true feast for the eyes."

Representing both the Song imperial court and the Sima Family, Sima Xunhui was stationed on the riverbank to guard against any southward advance from the north. Though his forces were not large, their presence helped share the burden on the Li family. Li Jiangzong maintained a courteous tone in response.

"It's the rainy season, so the river is wider than usual. I went out on the water yesterday. The constant clashes these past few years have left many casualties, feeding the fish until they're plump. But their bellies are full of human fingernails. They're inedible now."

Sima Xunhui fell into a contemplative silence. Li Jiangzong then pointed.

"Guest Retainer Ding's ambush was a success yesterday. He brought back another group of captives, including a Zhao general. He's being held in the pavilion. You should go see him."

The two descended the stairs together. Sima Xunhui's expression turned serious.

"This is precisely why I've come! My family's Daoist Master observed him for a long time, intercepting the approaching Maha in the Great Void to finally capture him. We have your clan to thank for your cooperation!"

Li Jiangzong waved his hand dismissively.

More than three years had passed since the great war that had founded the Great Song. On the northern bank, the grand formations had been rebuilt behind towering city walls, garrisoned with heavily fortified troops.

Perhaps the war three years ago had dealt a heavy blow to the north as well. While the past three years had seen considerable friction, with occasional probing incursions by the Merciful One or Maha, no major conflicts had erupted. A fragile peace had settled over the region.

The Li family had benefited greatly from this lull. Li Minggong, Li Zhouda, and others had fully recovered from their injuries, their cultivation and Dao-Profundity showing marked improvement. Li Jiangzong, too, had survived his fated trial of life and death. Yet, a deep worry still clouded his heart.

‘King Wei is injured… From what Daoist Master Qinghu said, it's serious. He'll certainly be out of commission for the next few years. Daoist Master Zhaojing remains in seclusion, and there's been no sign of him. Everything at the lake requires troubling Daoist Master Qinghu. This can't go on forever…’

Li Jiangzong led the way to the highest veranda. Though it was still early, the sixteen lampstands in the plaza were blazing brightly. The doors to the grand hall were shut tight, and two guards knelt before them, their heads bowed in silence.

It was clear someone was already inside. Li Jiangzong calculated the time and understood. He turned back with a smile.

"It seems my father has come to the shore. He's in the hall… This is a good chance for you to meet him."

"So it's my father-in-law!"

Li Zhoufang lacked talent and his cultivation was mediocre, leaving him with little reputation to speak of. But he was, after all, Sima Xunhui's father-in-law. The scion of a Purple Mansion Realm clan straightened his robes and followed his brother-in-law closely. Just as Li Jiangzong took a step forward, the doors to the hall creaked open of their own accord.

His father, Li Zhoufang, was indeed inside, but he stood at the very back of the hall. Flanking the main seat were a woman dressed in red with golden trim, from whom waves of True Fire Qi emanated, and a stout man in brilliant armor with the sharp jaw and fierce whiskers of a tiger. Both stood turned to the side, silent.

In the center of the hall knelt a man with a pale, fierce countenance. His armor was exquisite, but he knelt with his eyes closed, exuding a stubborn defiance.

Though he was clearly a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, his face was smooth and hairless, and his head was completely bald where his helmet had been removed—all signs pointing to him being one of the Buddhist cultivators.

As Li Jiangzong stepped inside, Ding Weizeng immediately cupped his fist in salute.

"Daoist Master Qinghu gave orders not to harm him," he whispered, "but he refuses to speak."

They all exchanged glances, their eyes finally settling on Sima Xunhui. But the cultivator from the Sima Family was just as clueless.

"I'm afraid we must wait for the Daoist Master's command!" he said with a wry smile.

Just then, the entire hall was suffused with a hazy white light, like a gentle morning mist. The stout, tiger-whiskered man collapsed to his knees as if a mountain of gold had toppled.

"Your subordinate pays his respects to the Daoist Master!"

Seated on the main throne, where no one had been a moment before, was a middle-aged man in a white and gold Daoist robe.

His long eyebrows were relaxed above a pair of authoritative eyes, and a brilliant golden light shone from between them. His features were natural and his expression was casual, yet he emanated an aura of inviolable dignity.

'A Daoist Master!'

It was Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing!

Perhaps due to his ever-increasing mastery of divine abilities, Li Ximing looked subtly different from how he was remembered. His features had undergone a slight transformation. Li Jiangzong dared not look too closely, but he sensed that his eyebrows were a little longer, the bridge of his nose more prominent. Though he looked the same, he now possessed a striking and commanding presence.

A surge of joy and apprehension washed over Li Jiangzong. He froze for a second, then pulled back the foot he had placed on the stairs and dropped to his knees with a thud.

"This junior pays his respects to the Daoist Master! Congratulations on mastering a great divine ability!"

While Li Jiangzong had been relatively relaxed in his own family's hall, Sima Xunhui was already on edge. He reacted instantly, kneeling right behind his brother-in-law. A calm voice then drifted down from above.

"Jiangzong, you've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. Good."

Li Jiangzong quickly offered a few auspicious words about the Daoist Master's divine protection. Li Ximing smiled faintly and gestured for him to rise.

"All of you, rise."

Sima Xunhui scrambled to his feet and moved to stand beside the figures at the side. Li Jiangzong swiftly glanced up. Seated in the guest chair, though he hadn't been there a moment ago, was a man in green robes. He didn't dare look at the man's face, but judging by Sima Xunhui's deferential posture, it could only be Daoist Master Qinghu.

Neither of the Daoist Masters displayed any overt power, yet the atmosphere in the hall had become profoundly solemn. Only the captive Zhao general's face flushed red. He raised his head, his eyes burning with hatred, and opened his mouth to shout a curse.

But at that exact moment, Li Ximing, having just accepted a cup from Li Minggong, turned his gaze upon him.

His face was like warm, lustrous jade, the divine light in his eyes softly veiled. He resembled a profound spirit seated within a sacred shrine, the floating white light in the hall like the curtain before it, making him mysterious and impossible to look upon directly.

That single glance caused the Zhao general's expression to go vacant. In an instant, it was as if something invisible swept across his face. The hatred, like a cloud of foul energy, was utterly blown away, vanishing without a trace. He shuffled forward on his knees, his eyes filled with a deep and irrepressible reverence. He began to weep.

"This subordinate greets you, my lord!"

The spiritual locks binding him fell to the floor with a clang. The man stood, then knelt again below the main seat, just in front of Ding Weizeng, blending seamlessly and respectfully into the ranks of the Li family.

For a moment, a chilling silence fell over the hall. Even Ding Weizeng's eyelids twitched, a sliver of cold fear piercing his heart.

Li Ximing gave him no glance. He nodded slightly at Sima Xunhui, and the direct descendant of the Sima Family immediately bowed. Li Ximing took a sip of tea and spoke quietly.

"Speak."

The word was clearly directed at the Zhao general, who answered with utmost reverence.

"This subordinate is Li Ju, a native of the northern mountains. I cultivate under the jurisdiction of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. I followed Maha Vast Cicada south and served in the army…"

Li Ximing's expression grew thoughtful. He looked toward Sima Yuanli. Daoist Master Qinghu nodded, his face grave.

"This year, I observed large-scale troop movements on the opposite bank, all from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. I felt the north was planning something, so I devised a plan to capture one of them… It's a fortunate coincidence that you've come out of seclusion, fellow Daoist. We can discuss our countermeasures."

Li Ximing frowned slightly.

He knew the name 'Vast Cicada', of course. He even knew—from his encounter with Nu Xiao and the Merciful One years ago—that this Maha also possessed Wei-Li blood!

'This is not good…'

As he considered this, Sima Yuanli studied his expression and let out a soft laugh, his voice tinged with envy.

"Congratulations, fellow Daoist Zhaojing… Remarkable… truly remarkable!"

He had emerged from seclusion today, his Life Divine Ability, 'World's Radiance', now fully mastered!

A Life Divine Ability held a unique significance for all cultivators in the world. It was not only a shadow that loomed over those of lower cultivation but also a crucial means of perfecting one's status in the Purple Mansion Realm. Now that he had succeeded, he seemed to have transcended the mundane, appearing almost like a different person.

'It truly wasn't easy!' Li Ximing thought with a surge of emotion.

The cultivation of a Life Divine Ability was heavily dependent on one's Dao-Profundity and destiny, making it incredibly difficult. For Li Ximing, the challenge had been even greater. This period of seclusion had lasted five or six years, and he had come dangerously close to failure.

'I was too hasty… Although I refined pills every year and grew more proficient in the Bright Yang Dao, my Dao-Profundity was still a step behind… If not for that portion of Soul-Listening Purple Intent Qi, which perfectly compensated for this weakness… I would have failed again!'

Currently, Li Zhouwei's Dao-Profundity was just shy of a Great Daoist Master's. When Li Ximing had entered seclusion, his own was merely that of an ordinary early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Many Daoist Masters with far greater Dao-Profundity had failed to master a Life Divine Ability, let alone someone like him.

But with this single success, his Dao-Profundity had advanced considerably. He felt a profound sense of relief and triumph, as if a great weight had been lifted. He raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"Just a bit of luck…"

Sima Yuanli shook his head, sighing with admiration.

"I wouldn't say that. First, your clan's destiny is strong. Second… you are brilliant, fellow Daoist. My own elders have advised that if one cannot achieve the Dao through a Life Divine Ability, one should, if their talent permits, make it their second divine ability. After all, they become harder to cultivate later on. Making it third is even more difficult. To wait until you encounter the Purple Mystery to practice a Life Divine Ability… that's practically asking for trouble!"

Sima Yuanli felt a genuine pang of envy. His own Dao lineage was well-defined, and a Life Divine Ability was now the foundation of his Dao, yet he had absolutely no confidence in mastering it. The situation was urgent, however, and he couldn't afford to stagnate. How could he not be envious seeing Li Ximing overcome such a monumental hurdle?

Li Ximing listened to his words with a faint smile.

With this divine ability mastered, the world he saw was entirely different.

Spheres of profound light, like luminous pearls, hung above everyone's head. They varied in color and brilliance—some were bright and full, others dim and withered—each corresponding to the person's Spiritual Qi cultivation. This was the world as perceived by 'World's Radiance'.

In other words, everyone in the hall was under the sway of his Life Divine Ability. In fact, its influence extended beyond the hall, covering everything within the range of his spiritual sense.

The wonders of this Life Divine Ability were divided into two main parts. The primary function acted upon Li Ximing himself, described in the texts as: ‘Born of the sacred, foundation of kingship, master of the Six Harmonies, balancer of heaven and earth, companion to gods, interrogator of the cosmos.’

This aspect was linked to his personal Dao-Profundity, influence, and status. Once activated, it would bestow the blessing of 'World's Radiance', manifesting a 'Light of the Six Harmonies' that could impose binding edicts and dispel calamities.

This 'Light of the Six Harmonies' was intrinsically tied to 'World's Radiance' and deeply connected to his Dao-Profundity in the Bright Yang Dao. Besides its use in combat, it could also be used for divination and seeking the Dao—to "balance heaven and earth, interrogate the cosmos."

Beyond the Light of the Six Harmonies, the secondary functions highlighted the unique nature of a Life Divine Ability.

If one were to compare a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to a mortal, 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' would be a sharp weapon, and 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' would be a suit of armor. In contrast, this aspect of 'World's Radiance' was like one's appearance, strength, bearing, and fortune—intangible qualities.

This divine ability was not something to be activated or retracted like 'Audience with the Celestial Gate'; it was more like a natural elevation of his own being.

'World's Radiance' didn't cover a physical area so much as it permeated the web of power and relationships within a faction.

This divine ability governed promotions and demotions. Those he favored and protected would receive the grace of 'World's Radiance', causing Heavenly Light to manifest within their sea of Qi, which would in turn fortify their righteous thoughts and illuminate their true nature.

Through this mystical connection, he could command absolute loyalty. It allowed him to instantly sense any dissent or resentment from subordinates like Ding Weizeng and Qu Bushi.

If he sensed such feelings and grew angry, a mere verbal rebuke could strip them of their cultivation. For those at the Qi Refining or Embyronic Breathing stages, it was trivial. He could even demote a peak Foundation Establishment Realm expert like Ding Weizeng to the mid-stage with a single sentence, erasing decades of hard work in an instant.

Furthermore, the 'Light of the Six Harmonies' had a corresponding power. A gentle sweep of the light could befuddle a person's spirit, causing them to forget themselves completely and follow his every command as if it were a sacred edict.

'It's not as if they are reborn as a new person, like a monarch's reincarnation… but unless another Purple Mansion expert's special Life Divine Ability breaks the spell, the person will remain loyal to my instructions until they die! Over time, their own will would be completely lost… Even if another Purple Mansion cultivator intervened, they couldn't be saved.'

At the same time, as the culmination of the Bright Yang arts, 'World's Radiance' could resonate with 'Audience with the Celestial Gate'!

When 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' was used, it would summon a host of golden-armored soldiers from the heavens. These summoned soldiers possessed only the strength of Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment cultivators and had little more than basic combat instincts. Without a special technique from the Wei Kingdom, they were useless against a Purple Mansion Realm expert and could be wiped out in a single breath.

But this was where the 'companion to gods' aspect of the 'Light of the Six Harmonies' came into play. A single touch of the light would vastly increase the intelligence of the golden-armored soldiers. If his Dao-Profundity reached a sufficient level, he could even use the Light of the Six Harmonies to merge the divine abilities, creating a golden-armored immortal general capable of fighting other Purple Mansion Realm experts.

'This… must be a manifestation of the Wei-Li Celestial Dynasty's arts!'

# Chapter 1051: Vast Profound Suspended Void

‘World’s Radiance.’

Li Ximing secretly pondered the name while Sima Yuanli remained silent, his own thoughts churning. He knew little about this Bright Yang divine ability, but in terms of sheer insidiousness, ‘World’s Radiance’ was no less terrifying than the seven forms of the Northern Buddhists…

‘Abilities like ‘Heavy Murk’ or ‘Tainted Visage’ have to be activated; there are always traces left by a divine ability’s operation. But ‘World’s Radiance’ seizes control of the mind without a whisper, making it incredibly difficult to detect…’

When observing with a qi-perceiving ability, ‘Heavy Murk’ left a gloomy aura on its victim’s face, while ‘Tainted Visage’ created a distinct red cluster between the eyebrows, making it easy to identify. Yet, when Li Ximing had stolen the general’s mind with a single word, Sima Yuanli had only glimpsed a faint light brush across the man’s face. Once the general was under control, even staring intently revealed nothing unusual. Only upon careful calculation could he sense a hint of Bright Yang qi.

‘This is a massive problem.’

Without having tried himself, Sima Yuanli wasn’t sure he could wake the man. Lacking a Life Divine Ability, his chances of success were probably slim to none.

‘I’d need a Life Divine Ability to discern ‘World’s Radiance’ as easily as I can ‘Tainted Visage’. But I’ve heard that the influence of ‘World’s Radiance’ grows more severe with time, until the victim completely loses themselves. In the end, even if the divine ability fades, their mind can never be turned back. That makes it impossible to truly observe…’

Sima Yuanli wasn’t afraid of what Li Ximing might do, but he was deeply wary of King Wei, Li Zhouwei. That man was blessed by fate; if his divine ability reached perfection, there was no telling how bizarre it could become.

‘No matter what… he can’t possibly bewitch me, can he…?’

He lowered his gaze and sipped his tea. Li Ximing noticed his unspoken concerns and waved a dismissive sleeve.

“You are all dismissed.”

The attendants bowed and retreated. The general, Li Ju, followed them out naturally. He even held the hall door open for Li Jiangzong before standing guard outside, leaving Li Jiangzong with a strange, almost embarrassed expression.

After a moment of silence, Sima Yuanli sighed.

“I wonder… how is King Wei?”

Li Ximing’s expression turned grave.

“He was gravely injured this time and has sealed his residence. I haven’t been able to see him since…”

Sima Yuanli let out a low sigh.

Li Ximing watched him closely, finding it odd that the Daoist Master accepted his words so easily, so definitively.

‘Was he really injured that badly back then? The way Sima Yuanli looks, if I told him the King was fully recovered, he’d just think I was putting on a brave face…’

Li Ximing felt no such concern. With his own divine ability successfully cultivated, he knew Li Zhouwei was also in the Heaven of Sun and Moon’s Shared Radiance. His dark flames surged to the heavens, his celestial light was blinding, and his divine ability, ‘Sovereign’s Perilous Tread’, had long since reached perfection. He was in the process of condensing his immortal foundation. Forget being injured—Li Ximing was confident the King could stand up right now and slap a cultivator like Nu Xiao into submission with a couple of strikes.

‘It seems that Profound Vastness Art, which elevates Pure Qi, is truly formidable. I must find a chance to practice it myself…’

Though his thoughts were full of this strange discrepancy, his face showed only sorrow and concern. Sima Yuanli sighed again.

“Daoist friend, you may not be aware. Last year, a Grotto-Heaven descended upon the Northern Sea. I don’t know what power it belonged to… but the ensuing battle was earth-shattering. I heard even Senior Tu Longjian made an appearance—he’s already at the middle-stage Purple Mansion Realm now!”

Li Ximing’s eyes lit up as Sima Yuanli continued.

“It was a veritable clash of titans. A sword immortal from a Supreme Yang Dao lineage had initially claimed the prize… but then an unknown Great Daoist Master appeared out of nowhere. Senior Tu Longjian, the North Ring Sect… even the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the Xiangxiong Kingdom on the Great Western Plateau suffered heavy injuries. Some even perished.”

A frown creased Li Ximing’s brow, a flicker of worry for Tu Longjian appearing in his heart. He nodded silently. Sima Yuanli observed him for a moment before changing the subject.

“I came today… to ask a favor of you. The coast is rife with danger, and I have been eagerly awaiting your emergence from seclusion. The supply of Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder can finally be replenished.”

During Li Ximing’s seclusion, Sima Yuanli had tried to find another alchemist. Using his connections, he had met with an old Daoist Master on Overlook Peak. The old man had beaten his chest in assurance, but when Sima Yuanli went to collect the pills, the cheerful old master presented him with a batch that was one pill short of what Li Ximing would have made.

Sima Yuanli had smiled politely, but whether the old man was greedier or simply less skilled, he never mentioned a second batch. He had waited impatiently for Li Ximing to emerge, not willing to delay another moment.

Li Ximing was more than willing. The ingredients for Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder were precious and its effects were excellent. Now that he no longer had to worry about his divine ability, how could he refuse? He readily agreed.

But just as he did, his words caught in his throat. He raised an eyebrow in thought as a gust of purple wind swept before the main hall, coalescing into a woman clad in an autumn-yellow robe. She stood before the entrance, a faint, pale smile on her lips.

Li Ximing jolted slightly and quickly rose to his feet, taking a step forward.

“Daoist Tinglan!” he said in a low voice.

The woman was none other than Daoist Master Tinglan, who was supposed to have been sealed within the Purple Smoke Blessed Land!

When Li Ximing had visited her in the Purple Smoke domain years ago, his first impression was of her meticulous elegance and striking beauty. She wore the same satin robe of autumn yellow today, but the delicate butterfly pattern at the corner of her eye was gone. The pale color of her lips gave her a frail, sickly appearance.

Her eyes, too, seemed much softer. As one of the few surviving Daoist Masters of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, her demeanor was lost, almost awkward.

Seeing Li Ximing approach, she hurried forward a few steps.

“Zhaojing! It has been a long time…”

Li Ximing’s trust in her surpassed even his trust in the Sima Family, and their bond was stronger. His feelings were complex as he said,

“After the battle on the river, I was deeply concerned for all of you. But with the blessed land sealed, not a whisper of news escaped… What matter has brought you here today…?”

His tone was polite and tactful. Tinglan offered a slight smile in return.

“The Emperor has established his nation, fostering martial might and radiance. The conflict between north and south is a matter that concerns millions of lives. We who follow the path of Purple Qi cultivation cannot simply stand aloof from the world. In the days to come… we will have to trouble you to look after us…”

Even though Li Ximing had suspected this was the reason, hearing her say the words herself still struck him with a sense of how much things had changed.

‘The status of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition has collapsed, and its dignity has vanished with it. Kui Qi would rather sacrifice himself for the Dao than live to see this day… And now… now she is left to struggle in this predicament, where the Supreme Yang has lost its brilliance…’

Their conversation was not hidden. Sima Yuanli, sitting nearby, turned his head away uncomfortably. He raised his cup and then set it down, resisting the urge to speak.

Tinglan’s gaze happened to fall on him. She bowed slightly and said politely,

“Greetings, Daoist Qinghu.”

Sima Yuanli had long since severed his ties with the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, and the Sima Family had parted ways with the Azure Pond. Her tone was distant and flat, utterly lacking the warmth one might expect when meeting the descendant of a former senior of the tradition.

Sima Yuanli scrambled to his feet, returning the bow with considerable awkwardness.

‘It seems… the relationship between the Sima Family and the remnants of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is not close… or rather, they don’t dare to be too close…’

Li Ximing saw it all clearly. But setting aside the plight of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, he felt a measure of relief at seeing Tinglan. After all, she was one of the few figures in the Purple Mansion Realm whom he knew well and trusted. Her skills were profound, and having her as an ally was a good thing.

He guided her to a seat and hesitantly poured her tea.

“And Daoist Wenqing…?”

If the Purple Smoke Gate was re-entering the world, she surely wouldn't be the only one to emerge.

Tinglan’s voice was soft.

“I was ordered to join the Bureau of Immortal Rites, though I remain the master of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. Together with Ning Wan, I have been tasked with guarding the four directions. Wenqing… Wenqing’s cultivation is a bit weaker. She is currently stationed at the Violet Zenith Pavilion in the Imperial Capital, awaiting the Emperor’s command.”

This was more or less what Li Ximing had expected. He nodded to himself.

‘Tinglan, though also in the early-stage Purple Mansion Realm, is a far more capable fighter than Ning Wan. With her Spiritual Treasure, she could likely hold her own against a mid-stage cultivator…’

Li Ximing hesitated, the question circling in his mind several times before he finally asked, somewhat tentatively,

“The great battle back then… what became of the other Daoist Masters…?”

Tinglan shook her head. “Qi Lanyan attacked with his forces. He wielded the Crystalline Jade Branch. I was already exhausted, and the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion was under heavy seals… I could not abandon the Spiritual Treasure, so I was forced to fight to free it. I was struck by his treasure… and was gravely injured…”

The Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion was the core Spiritual Treasure of the Purple Smoke Gate; it was no surprise that Tinglan valued it more than her own life. Her expression grew complicated as she continued,

“Daoist Master Houfu was also besieged, but he faced more enemies and was not as lucky as I. He was shattered to pieces by a Spiritual Treasure and nearly perished on the spot… He managed to escape back to his monastery… but he’s… he’s done for.”

“What?!” Li Ximing drew a sharp breath.

“The Crystalline Jade Branch is an exceptionally potent Wu Earth Spiritual Treasure,” Tinglan said. “Once it strikes a person, both their soul and body suffer the punishment of the Crystalline Wu Earth. I survived only because I was protected by a treasure of the Purple Qi Dao, but the Wu Earth still injured my body, a wound that has not healed in years. His entire body was pulverized, leaving only a sliver of his True Spirit. I heard the disciples at his monastery took wood from a Sun-Sighting Mulberry and carved a fist-sized figure for him to inhabit…”

“Though his life was saved, no one short of those from Penglai could heal such an injury. And so long as the punishment of the Crystalline Wu Earth remains, he suffers the agony of being flayed and having his bones crushed every single day, completely helpless… I don’t know how long he can hold on…”

Li Ximing was silent for a long moment.

The cultivators of the Great Xiukui Monastery had always been fiercely proud and concerned with their reputation. Houfu was a prime example of this, a man who valued his honor above all else. For such a proud Purple Mansion Daoist Master to be reduced to living inside a wooden carving, suffering daily humiliation…

‘That must be a worse fate for him than death!’

He sighed deeply and turned to look at Sima Yuanli. The man known as Daoist Qinghu kept his eyes lowered, saying nothing, focusing only on drinking his tea.

Li Ximing was no longer the naive Purple Mansion cultivator he once was. He understood. Tinglan’s words weren’t necessarily for his ears alone… more likely, they were for the Daoist Qinghu beside him, and by extension, for the Song Imperial Court far to the south.

‘The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is utterly broken. The Great Xiukui Monastery is barely clinging to life. Daoist Master Lingu, whom they trained, is already a subject of the Song Court. The Purple Smoke Gate and Tinglan herself can serve the Song Court to the death, if only the Song Emperor will spare the Great Xiukui Monastery… and stop pressuring Houfu…’

By emphasizing Houfu’s injuries, Tinglan was emphasizing his uselessness. Li Ximing understood, and how could Sima Yuanli not?

A flicker of old camaraderie remained in his heart, and he found he couldn’t bear it. He clenched his jaw.

‘What can I possibly do? Do they not understand? It’s all a matter of a whim for the great figures in power. She thinks far too highly of me, imagining I have more freedom and influence than I do!’

The atmosphere in the hall grew heavy. Li Ximing put on a worried expression and asked Tinglan,

“Are your injuries still serious? Let me take a look…”

Years of injury had severely hampered her cultivation. Tinglan looked unwell and did not refuse his kindness. As Li Ximing’s fingers, imbued with his divine ability, touched her wrist, she murmured,

“‘World’s Radiance’… you’ve already mastered it.”

Li Ximing didn’t answer. He lowered his gaze slightly, saying thoughtfully,

“The punishment of the Crystalline Wu Earth seems to have been suppressed by medicine, but the foundation of your divine ability has been damaged… It needs to be restored.”

He considered for a moment.

“During the campaign to eliminate Changxiao, I obtained a Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf. Using it with some Purple Qi would be most suitable for your recovery… allow me to formulate a prescription…”

Watching from the side, Sima Yuanli spoke, his voice pale and weak.

“Zhaojing’s skill in alchemy is beyond question… I have duties to attend to in the east, so I will not impose any longer…”

He bid farewell to them and departed from the hall. Tinglan watched his retreating back, a faint smile touching her lips. She turned to Li Ximing and shook her head.

“Sima Yuanli is of a gentle nature. My words were enough to make him too embarrassed to stay. If Yuanxiu were here, he would have remained perfectly composed, sipping tea and chatting. It truly shows the difference in their temperaments. The Upright Wood is a Daoist tradition as unyielding and proud as metal. How does he expect to master the nature of Upright Wood?”

Only then did the woman display some of her former spirit. Li Ximing chuckled and shook his head.

“What is there to master or not master? I find that people in this world often lack the destiny for metal, yet possess the heart for it. If he truly had an unyielding and proud nature, would his current situation be any better?”

Tinglan nodded and let out a long sigh. Her gaze turned teasing.

“I just returned from the Xinyu Archipelago. It seems Kuang Yu has become quite familiar with you. She said she came looking for you twice but you were gone… If she knew you were out of seclusion, she likely would have come with me.”

Li Ximing gave an awkward laugh. Tinglan’s expression then turned serious. She lowered her eyes.

“Daoist Zhaojing… the grand order of True Qi is now established. All things of True Qi in the world have been revitalized. The power of the Immeasurable Water and Fire in my hands has grown substantially. Several True Qi treasured lands within my blessed land have also transformed, and even the Purple Qi is shining with new color… They resonate with each other, triggering a flourishing of Pure Qi. The spiritual atmosphere has finally stabilized…”

Having just come out of seclusion, Li Ximing had missed the years of this atmospheric shift. It finally dawned on him. He frowned slightly, his fingers moving in a quick calculation as his Life Divine Ability activated. He nodded.

“You are right… True Qi flourishes, purple light shines in reflection. The pursuit of truth and immortality has caused the twelve Qis to prosper, and yin and yang have become more balanced…”

For Li Ximing, who had only just achieved his Life Divine Ability, to be able to deduce this much was truly impressive. Tinglan nodded in admiration.

“This is the Vast Profound Suspended Void. It dispels demons and stops evil, aiding in the enterprise of immortal ascension. Of the twelve Qis, all but Profound Qi have been enhanced. It is especially beneficial for True Qi!”

She paused, her expression solemn.

“The elevation of Pure Qi is beneficial for comprehending the Dao. Spiritual apertures throughout the world have expanded, and spiritual resources are proliferating. Most importantly… with the Vast Profound Suspended Void, the Profound Foundation gains radiance. Grotto-Heavens and Dharma Realms will flourish, and all under heaven will begin constructing immortal realms and opening their own Grotto-Heavens!”

“Back then, the Great Ning established a new system and abandoned the old names, calling it ‘The Era of Conquest, Peace and Martial Glory.’ The original name… is a secret known only through the transmissions of our Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition… in all of Jiangnan, perhaps only a handful of families are aware of it!”




### Chapter 1052: True Dao Immortal Cultivation

Li Ximing stroked his beard, his mind racing. "The Vast Profound Suspended Void," he mused aloud, "and it involves True Qi. It must be intimately connected to the Ning State."

Tinglan studied him for a long moment, carefully weighing her words before she finally spoke.

"Zhaojing… have you heard of the True Dao Sect?"

A flicker of surprise went through Li Ximing, but his expression remained unchanged.

"I would be grateful if you could elaborate, fellow Daoist."

A peculiar look crossed Tinglan's face. "The True Dao Sect consisted of four branches, all based on what was once Profound Truth Mountain—the very land where the Xiuyue Mountain Gate now stands. They championed a path of natural cultivation, a Great Dao that encompassed the Five Virtues. During the era of the Wei Emperor, this sect was the foremost cultivator of True Qi and Purple Qi."

She paused, considering her next words.

"Only, they didn't call it True Qi and Purple Qi. They called it 'True Yang' and 'Purple Yin'."

Li Ximing's brow twitched, his mind instantly alight with a thousand thoughts. Tinglan continued, unaware.

"In primordial times, a True Monarch whose family name was Zhuang cultivated on Profound Truth Mountain. People called him Daoist Zhuang—an extremely high honor in an age of ignorance. When he ascended to immortality, he left behind a cave estate containing a single tome: the Taihua Classic."

"His six disciples shared the book. In time, they all fell, but not before passing on their knowledge to their own successors. These inheritors jointly safeguarded the classic, forming the nascent True Dao Sect."

"The True Dao Sect's mastery of True and Purple Qi was unparalleled. The Vast Profound Suspended Void… was the spiritual atmosphere that their Daoist Tradition conceived. However, during the fall of the Zhou Dynasty, a schism tore the sect apart. The paths of True Qi and Purple Qi diverged, and their doctrine of the Five Virtues all but annihilated the principles of Yin and Yang. Despite this, the Daoist scriptures they preserved remained incredibly profound. They are, to this day, the foundational texts for all who cultivate True and Purple Qi."

Li Ximing nodded slowly.

"The True Dao immortal cultivators... stripped of their crowns, their wings clipped..."

'Of course I knew,' Li Ximing thought. 'It was a defining moment in history—a glorious victory the Cui clan boasted of, and a pretext later generations used to condemn the Wei Emperor. No matter the perspective, there was no ignoring the emperor's shocking decree!'

Tinglan's surprise was fleeting. She quickly understood and shook her head. 

"Precisely. The Wei Emperor marched from Guanlong, sword in hand, and declared that any immortal cultivator who had forsaken the mortal world and refused to aid the common folk would be stripped of their crown and have their wings clipped. They weren't the only sect to face his wrath, but they were by far the most renowned."

"After the True Dao Sect was annihilated, the Wei Emperor read the Taihua Classic and was stunned by its brilliance. He decided to restore the path of Profound Truth, appointing the King of Jiangling to guard the mountain. And the descendant of that king… was none other than the future True Monarch Tianwu!"

As Tinglan laid out the history, the pieces clicked into place for Li Ximing. It was a moment of sudden, blinding clarity.

"No wonder," he exclaimed. "No wonder the Ning State took in the great families fleeing from the north and postured as the successor to the Wei's mandate! So that's the connection… This is a history that only a Dao Lineage like yours, one that cultivates Purple Qi, could possibly know so well!"

Tinglan nodded gravely and lowered her voice. "I suspect that even the Sima Family doesn't know the name 'Vast Profound Suspended Void'!"

"When the True Monarch Tianwu first appeared, the spiritual atmosphere was just as it is today. The two Qis worked in harmony with yin and yang, stars were visible in daylight, Anhuai Heaven rose, and Wanling Heaven expanded the land for who knows how far. The Ning State was the center of the world's attention. But because of the True Dao Sect's destruction, all their relevant Dao Lineages were locked away in the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate. The Sima and Su families were just noble clans; for all their searching through ancient texts, they could never find the name of this spiritual phenomenon. They had no choice but to report it to the throne as 'The Era of Conquest, Peace and Martial Glory'."

She mused, "My master theorized that since the Ning State inherited the Wei's mandate and established its own empire, it was inappropriate to use a name like 'Vast Profound Suspended Void'—a term from the True Dao Sect that advocated for worldly detachment and ascension into grotto-heavens. So they adopted the name proposed by the Sima and Su families instead."

Li Ximing nodded in understanding, another realization dawning on him.

'So... it was no accident that Zhouwei obtained the Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence from the Cui clan. It was said to be from an immortal estate, yet it contained little to no Bright Yang energy. It's highly likely that it originated from the absorbed arts of the True Dao Sect!'

'A grotto-heaven… a Mystic Realm…'

The thought stirred something within him.

He and Li Zhouwei had considered this long ago. But while their family was now a major power in Jiangnan with techniques second to none, they lacked the deep foundation needed to touch upon such immortal secrets. They didn't even possess a method to traverse the Great Void, let alone create a grotto-heaven Mystic Realm.

Li Ximing had originally pinned his hopes on Li Que'wan. Hearing this news now didn't disappoint him; instead, it solidified his resolve.

'A spiritual atmosphere like this... even if it only lasts for fifty years, let alone a hundred... with the help of the Talisman Seed, Que'wan will definitely have enough time. As for the technique to open a Mystic Realm…'

Spiritual items and resources could eventually be found, but secret arts were priceless and often existed only in the vaults of major powers. That was the real challenge. Yet, a smile touched his lips.

'Other places might not have one, but the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance is a different story!'

Back when Zhouwei destroyed the sect, killed Cheng Yan, and earned fifty-seven immortal merits, he had used the remainder after exchanging for the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light. Twelve merits were left. The battle on the river hadn't yielded as much, but he had still disposed of Taixi and crippled Chiluo. Countless Buddhist monks died in that great war, earning them even more immortal merits than the time with Cheng Yan—a full sixty-five.

'I shouldn't have to worry about immortal merits for a while. The only issue is explaining the origin of the spell arts!'

As he considered this, a trace of delight grew in his heart.

'The Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence is a sleeve-dwelling technique. To put it plainly, it’s not an exaggeration to call it a minor Mystic Realm. If this spiritual atmosphere is so beneficial for elevating Mystic Realms, it should drastically reduce the cultivation cost of this art as well...'

While his mind was occupied with his own affairs, he spoke his thanks aloud.

"To share such secrets so freely… Zhaojing is deeply grateful, fellow Daoist!"

Tinglan shook her head with a smile.

"With the blessed land's emergence, Quexi has also come out of seclusion. She's been cultivating diligently all these years and is blessed with good fortune; she's already at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. She's been clamoring to come back to the lake for a look... but Wenqing values her greatly and immediately whisked her away to the imperial capital. It will be a few days before she returns."

"However... there is another junior..."

With a wave of her sleeve, Tinglan opened the hall doors. A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator strode in quickly. He was tall and thin, but his bearing was proper. He bowed excitedly before the grand hall.

"This humble one, Ding Mu, greets the Daoist Master! Congratulations on your great advancement in divine ability."

Tinglan smiled.

"He came from your lake. Life in the sect has been simple for him these past years, but he has not been a disappointment. When he heard I was coming to the lake, he knelt before my grotto-estate for several days, insisting that I bring him along to express his gratitude."

"So it's you…"

Li Ximing smiled with genuine interest.

Years ago, when cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate came to construct an array on the lake, a certain amorous Daoist Cao had taken a widow from the shore with him, bringing her orphaned son, Ding Mu, to the Purple Smoke Gate to cultivate. The boy back then had been so small and skinny; who would have thought he'd grow into the young man before him now?

"How is your mother?"

Ding Mu kowtowed and replied respectfully

"The Spiritual Qi on the mountain is dense. My mother's fortunes were thin, and she passed away early. My master entered seclusion for an unknown length of time, so she couldn't even see him one last time. I handled her funeral arrangements myself and have been cultivating on the mountain for what should be ten years now..."

Daoist Cao was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. He might have pitied the young Ding matriarch in her youth, but once she grew old, she wouldn't have received a second glance. Li Ximing nodded slightly. Tinglan chuckled.

"Daoist Cao's wife is a jealous woman. In his early years, he relied heavily on aid from the lake and is very grateful for it. Seeing his devotion, I decided to send him here to guard your family's lake. It should fulfill his long-held wish."

Tinglan spoke lightly, but Li Ximing suspected it was more than just 'aid'. The widow Ding must have borrowed the fox's prestige to live out her natural life. He sighed softly.

"Go find Weizheng. He is your clansman, after all."

Ding Mu wiped his tears, kowtowed three more times, and retreated. Li Ximing sipped his tea and remarked,

"Que'yi has gained Kuang Yu's favor. Her cultivation is progressing rapidly, already catching up to her younger sister."

Tinglan acknowledged his words, then bowed and took her leave. Li Ximing saw her out, saying seriously,

"Please wait a moment, Tinglan. I will start the furnace to refine the pills! I will have someone deliver them to you."

Tinglan thanked him. Li Ximing rode a beam of light back to the island. His smile vanished as he landed and hurried inside. The main hall was silent. Li Jiangzong and the others were already waiting.

Li Ximing took the main seat, his gaze sweeping over them before landing on a white-robed youth at his side. His eyes lit up.

"Jiangchun… you're out of seclusion!"

The sword-bearing youth in white smiled slightly and bowed.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, Jiangchun was fortunate not to fail his mission. I successfully forged my immortal foundation last year!"

Li Jiangchun had entered seclusion around the same time as Li Ximing, who had paid special attention to his progress. The family had long prepared Essence Gathering Pills refined with Lesser Yin spiritual items for him. Given his exceptional talent, achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm was not surprising, but it was still a cause for great celebration. Li Ximing nodded, looking at him with a beaming smile.

"And... what wonders has it brought?"

Compared to his brothers, Li Jiangchun was especially favored and was familiar with both Daoist Masters. He showed no fear, bowing with a smile.

"It is called 'All-Fragrance Sinks'. It uses the harmony of cold and heat to drive water and fire, sense good and ill, perceive azure spirits, connect above to the yin of Purple Qi to absorb great purity, and draw up the harmony of Cold Qi from below to nurture the Water Mansion..."

He raised a hand, palm up. In his jade-white palm, tassel-like streams of white light swirled. It looked unassuming, yet it emanated waves of an eye-catching Pure Qi.

Li Jiangchun spoke in a warm voice,

"All-Fragrance Sinks resides in the harmony of cold and heat. It has an affinity for Cold Qi and Water Mansion, allowing me to command Purple Qi as if it were my own limbs. It also has the ability to mend the injuries of others. The so-called absorption of great purity means I can consume medicines harmonized with Lesser Yin and Pure Qi as if they were pure yin dharma power, using them freely without fear of harm. By circulating my immortal foundation, I can transform the wonders of the Water Mansion for healing."

Li Ximing nodded, his eyes bright with approval.

'The Lesser Yin is not a well-known path, and it's rare in the world, but it's a harmonizing Dao that all major powers covet!'

'Not to mention, Lesser Yin and Pure Qi... they are perfectly suited for him!'

Joy bloomed in his heart, but with others present, he held his tongue. 

Suppressing his curiosity, he said,

"Excellent. In my travels through the Eastern Sea, I once saw a Shade-Cleansing Pool within the Daoist Tradition of the Nine Mounds. It contained a Lesser Yin treasure called Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew, which could heal the spiritual sense, advance dharma power, and enhance divine abilities without any risk to one's foundation. I imagine... that was also due to the wonders of the Lesser Yin!"

He smiled.

"I shall swallow my pride and request a portion for you!"

"Many thanks, Daoist Master!"

Li Jiangchun bowed repeatedly in gratitude, then said seriously, "The Lesser Yin path exclusively fears Molten Fire and Gathering Wood. The three thunders are incompatible, and it has no affinity with Ancient Merging. As for the twelve Qi, it is compatible with most."

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully. "Then the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record... how is your progress?"

Li Ximing had read the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record. It was incredibly difficult, perhaps even more so than the Great Parting's White Brilliance. He had Li Jiangchun cultivate it to build a solid foundation and broaden his Dao-Profundity, preparing him for a breakthrough in his divine ability.

Hearing the question, Li Jiangchun answered respectfully,

"This junior cultivates it day and night. In addition to practicing the sword, I spend much time on this art. The foundation is now set, and a Profound Mystery locus has formed within my body to contain water and fire..."

Having read the art himself, Li Ximing knew he had reached the stage where he needed spiritual items for support.

"What items do you require?" he asked.

Li Jiangchun bowed.

"The wonder of Lesser Yin commands water and fire. Among the fire virtues, both Blazing and True Fire heed its call. Although Li Fire is distant, it can be used in a pinch, but it uniquely fears Molten Fire. Among the water virtues, it most favors Water Mansion. Wherever its power reaches, even Converging and Valley Water will submit. Only with Pristine Water is it incompatible. It is not a matter of suppression, but their wonders clash and cannot be easily reconciled."

"The old master often asked about my progress and prepared both a Water Mansion treasure, 'Flowing Water Mansion', and a True Fire, 'Long-March Pheasant Flame', for me long ago. They are constantly being nurtured in my Profound Mystery locus to aid my cultivation."

Li Ximing smiled upon hearing this.

"Your great-grandfather is older and wiser. He understands that Water Mansion and True Fire are a perfect match, providing more than enough for you juniors to study carefully!"

Everyone nodded in agreement. In truth, Li Ximing had bigger plans.

'If the opportunity arises and the family's finances allow, perhaps I can find him a spiritual water and a spiritual fire.'

Li Jiangchun certainly couldn't refine items of the Purple Mansion Realm himself, but if the family truly had the means, Li Ximing could personally seal them into his acupoint. The benefits would be immense.

However, this was still just a notion. To bring it up in front of all the brothers would seem far too partial. Li Ximing tucked the thought away and asked,

"Jiangqian's side… is there any news?"

Li Jiangchun's eyes lit up.

"Big Brother came out of seclusion once last year. I heard his Dao-Profundity has advanced again. The flames around him burned fiercely with overwhelming might. He wanted to pay his respects to the Daoist Master but was unable to see you, so he returned to the mountain to continue his cultivation."

Li Jiangchun spoke tactfully, not mentioning the secret art. Li Ximing nodded in satisfaction and looked at Li Minggong.

"Have him come see me."

"Yes!"

As the woman left, Li Ximing asked about the others' cultivation one by one, offering encouragement. Then, he rose on a beam of light and landed on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. He opened the jade box and took out the Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf.

The spiritual light in the leaf's veins pulsed. It was already missing a corner, a sign that it should have been refined immediately. After several years, its spiritual nature had weakened further. Li Ximing conditioned it with Valley Water and Purple Qi, placed it in the furnace, and prepared to form it into pills using the One Will Technique.

His skill in alchemy was profound now. With just a single pat on the furnace, he felt a connection.

"'World's Radiance' is complete. With the enhancement from my Life Divine Ability, alchemy is much smoother... especially this One Will Technique. It resonates with my Life Divine Ability, increasing the speed of refinement significantly..."

It had been a long time since he'd touched a furnace, and he felt a sense of exhilaration. His movements were like flowing water. Closing his eyes, he lost himself in the process. After nine cycles of sun and moon, the furnace mouth vibrated. A rich fragrance filled the air as six verdant pills with a hint of purple shot out. Li Ximing slowly exhaled and calmly collected them.

'Refining pills is so much more relaxing than cultivating!'

The Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf was missing a corner, after all, and its medicinal properties had been lost. Producing six pills was already a feat. He took out two, packaged them carefully, and summoned a subordinate.

"Deliver these two to the Purple Smoke Gate."

He looked at the four remaining pills in his palm, thought for a moment, then took out a piece of silk cloth. He carefully wrote down the effects and ingredients, then added a few lines: I heard Senior was injured while seizing a treasure and have been deeply worried... This item is highly beneficial for injuries... If there is any need, please do not hesitate to command me... He sealed two more pills with the note.

"Deliver this to the Slaughter Jun Gate!"

The subordinate quickly agreed, then said cautiously,

"Daoist Master… the Young Master saw the blazing light on the mountain and did not dare to offend you. He has been waiting at the foot of the mountain for nine days and nine nights..."

# Chapter 1053: Preparing for the Purple Mansion Realm

Li Jiangqian ascended the mountain from below and knelt amidst the forest, his voice respectful.

"Congratulations on achieving your new divine ability, senior. This junior is overjoyed and deeply honored."

It had been some time since Li Ximing had last seen him. During his years of secluded cultivation, he had involved himself little in worldly affairs. Li Jiangqian’s attire had become simpler; he wore only a plain, light-white Daoist robe that gave him a different air. Li Ximing looked him over and smiled.

"Your time is precious. I've made you wait."

Li Jiangqian bowed.

"It was no long wait. I passed the time listening to my cousin Jiangchun recount the changes of the past few years. I have been reflecting ever since. The world is changing far faster than I anticipated... The matter of my own divine ability cannot be delayed."

Li Ximing knew he had always been a man with his own ideas and wondered what was on his mind now.

"I heard that Jiangxia was assigned to guard the Wilderness and that Jianglong is still in the imperial capital. Both brothers have their ambitions. The Purple and Gold Palace is a great opportunity... What are your thoughts on the matter?"

Li Jiangqian smiled faintly.

"It is not for this junior to say. My brothers are dedicated and will surely not neglect the family."

Li Ximing simply shook his head and changed the subject.

"How goes your cultivation?"

At this, Li Jiangqian's expression turned serious.

"Of the four secret arts in the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun, I have mastered the third, Setting the Snare. Only True Flame remains. Its difficulty is immense. I have studied it closely, and its mysteries are as vast and profound as a boundless sea. I fear... it is not something I can master in five or six years. Even if all goes smoothly, it will likely take a decade."

The words gave Li Ximing a headache. As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator himself, he understood the difficulty of secret arts. The Bright Yang arts he had studied back then had been thoroughly analyzed and explained, written with perfect clarity—far simpler than the scripture Li Jiangqian held.

'Not everyone can be like his father, after all...'

Li Jiangqian did not dwell on his own struggles but lowered his head slightly and continued,

"Over the years, several secret letters have arrived from overseas, written by my younger sister, Que'Wan. Her progress is not slow. The Golden Book of Houshu contains five secret arts, and she has already mastered three of them!"

"Three?" Li Ximing was taken aback.

Because she had to practice shamanic arts year-round, Li Que'wan's cultivation had always been a step behind Li Jiangqian's. When he was mastering his second secret art, Heavenly Apricot, she had only just begun her first. Yet now, her pace was faster.

Li Jiangqian nodded with a smile.

"Her shamanic practices have greatly enhanced her Dao-Profundity, which in turn has aided her mastery of the secret arts. Even though her cultivation method is more difficult than mine, she is still a bit faster."

Li Ximing smiled and nodded, letting the topic pass. He counted on his fingers, a frown creasing his brow.

'Ten years for True Flame... and that's if things go smoothly. Then he'll need to enter seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm... By my standards, that's another ten years. Two decades will pass in the blink of an eye. By then... Minghuang might already be a Great Daoist Master.'

Li Jiangqian was still young. If the world were stable, Li Ximing wouldn't mind waiting twenty, forty, or even sixty years. But he understood Li Zhouwei's dilemma all too well.

'He needs the support of a Purple Mansion cultivator to suppress the Buddhist cultivators. Twenty-odd years... that's a bit too long...'

He looked intently at Li Jiangqian and asked in a low voice,

"True Flame... must you truly master it?"

The question was all Li Jiangqian needed. He understood at once and replied solemnly,

"That is precisely what I came to discuss with you, Daoist Master. I propose we abandon this art and seek my divine ability directly!"

He paused, a hint of regret in his eyes.

"When you were in seclusion, I had already asked the old master about this. But he firmly rejected the idea, insisting I master every secret art before making the attempt... So I had no choice but to return to my cave-dwelling."

Li Xuanxuan was always more protective. Li Ximing, however, was different. He frowned and nodded.

"If things don't go smoothly, it could be more than a decade... We truly cannot afford to wait. In that time, with the help of medicinal pills, you could have already refined an additional divine ability..."

And Li Jiangqian had not even received his talisman qi yet. If everything went well, the two divine abilities he would gain after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm would come to him with incredible ease. Reaching the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm would not only be a certainty but would happen with astonishing speed.

'A mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, a decade or so sooner... that's enough to change the entire situation.'

Li Ximing pondered this for a long time. Kneeling on the ground, Li Jiangqian's mind was also racing, his emotions a mix of caution and complexity. His personality dictated that he would never allow the slightest mishap in a life-threatening event like a realm breakthrough, nor would he pass up any opportunity to increase his chances of success. But the current situation... the more he heard, the more unsettling it felt.

'Father is seeking the path of Bright Yang... and the conflict between the north and south is escalating. If something goes wrong, it will be a world-shattering catastrophe...'

A shadow fell over his thoughts.

'I once believed Father could protect us for three hundred years with ease. Now, it seems that is far from enough. The quest for the Gold depends on the state of the world; it certainly won't take more than a century. In an extreme case, it might only be sixty or seventy years...'

Of everyone at Moongaze Lake, his father, Li Zhouwei, was the one he could never read. He had no idea how confident his father truly was. In such circumstances, Li Jiangqian always prepared for the worst.

'If something happens to Father, I need enough power to protect myself... preferably as a Great Daoist Master... someone valuable enough to be noticed by the great powers...'

Given the urgency, Li Jiangqian could wait no longer. One secret art, True Flame, would take over a decade. Opportunities are fleeting; where would he find another ten years to spare?

'Reaching the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm won't be difficult, but the legendary immortal threshold of the Purple Mystery is no joke. I cannot wait.'

Driven by these considerations, Li Jiangqian bowed solemnly before the Daoist Master.

"Father is entangled in the north-south conflict, and the lake faces constant threats. At this time of crisis, Jiangqian is unwilling to wait any longer!"

Li Ximing gave a heavy nod and reassured him,

"You need not be anxious. I have considered this matter deeply."

He produced a box from his sleeve, revealing the spiritual object within.

Inside lay a perfectly round, brilliant golden pearl. Feather-like patterns drifted across its surface, and a deep golden light swirled within, emanating an exceptionally profound aura of Li Fire. Li Ximing explained,

"I asked about this item. It is a Golden Li Amber Pearl. It is of immense help to Li Fire cultivators. It can enhance divine abilities and be used to forge dharma artifacts, though it cannot be consumed to heal injuries. It is also an ideal spiritual object for a breakthrough!"

This treasure had been obtained from the Li Fire Palace in the grotto-heaven, prepared by the senior named Lu for his lineage's successor. It had clearly been chosen with great care. Li Ximing handed it over, then produced a jade vial.

"This is an Embracing-Feather Uniting-Heart Pill. I acquired it back in Poluoduo while refining pills for a Li Fire Demon King. It's a Purple Mansion Realm pill, made with incredibly potent ingredients to trade for spiritual fire. It will be more than sufficient for your needs."

Li Jiangqian quickly accepted them, but before he could offer his thanks, Li Ximing waved him silent. With a flip of his palm, he revealed a Spiritual Treasure that shone like a Golden Core—it was the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

"This is an extremely precious Spiritual Treasure," Li Ximing said. "It belongs to your father, who intended to give it to you long ago. I have merely been keeping it for him. Within it lies a wondrous mystery, a form of Dao-Cultivation that can assist in cultivating divine abilities of the Li Fire and True Fire path."

He offered a slight smile.

"It is only because of this marvelous Spiritual Treasure that I am willing to let you attempt your breakthrough early!"

Li Ximing's preparations were nothing short of meticulous. He spoke with deep meaning,

"When your father rushed into seclusion on the sea all those years ago, he didn't have conditions like these, to say nothing of myself. These items... even most Immortal Sects couldn't gather them all. Your father prepared each one for you. You must remember this."

Tears streamed down Li Jiangqian's face as he kowtowed.

"I will engrave the family's kindness in my heart... and I will not fail your expectations."

Li Ximing sighed softly. "Have you chosen a location?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head.

"It can only be on the lake. Anywhere else... I would not feel at ease."

Li Ximing had considered Wave-Suppressing Mansion. He thought to himself:

'The spiritual aura in Jiangnan is unlikely to change. In some ways, it's safer than being overseas. But there's always a chance our family won't be able to defend it, and enemies could break through...'

'Que'Wan will definitely be at Wave-Suppressing Mansion. In that case, Jiangqian should stay on the lake. They will be in seclusion separately. If something happens to one location, at least we can ensure one of them survives.'

He agreed to the plan and, with a flick of his sleeve, declared,

"You will enter seclusion within the inner array. The spiritual qi there is stable, and you will not be disturbed. I will personally activate the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and use my divine ability to lock the Spiritual Treasure within the great array to aid your breakthrough!"

## Pingya Islands

Brilliant Heavenly Light always shone upon Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Farther from the mountain and out over the lake, the radiance dimmed considerably. Li Suining traveled with haste, landing before the grand hall on the island just as a man in hemp clothes was descending the steps.

"Guest Retainer Nantanchen!"

Li Suining offered a slight bow, and Nantanchen cupped his hands with a smile. 

"Greetings, Young Master!"

Much like in his previous life, Nantanchen, the Nanzhang cultivator of humble origins, had revealed a talent for alchemy and had quickly taken charge of the family's pill-refining operations. Li Suining had come to see the old master, Li Xuanxuan. Seeing Nantanchen coming from the hall, he knew the man had been reporting directly to the elder. He smiled kindly.

"Congratulations, Guest Retainer."

Nantanchen shook his head, bowed again, and quickly departed. Li Suining watched him go, strange feelings and lament rising within him.

'Chen Jinxi... he actually fell...'

Chen Jinxi was Chen Yang's own son and a pillar of the Chen Clan. He had later reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, and alongside Chen Jinguang, they were known as the Twin Jewels of the Chen Clan. While not widely famous, they were ranked among the top cultivators of the vassal families on the lake.

'This recent battle was unexpectedly fierce. He was killed, and even Nantanchen seemed moved by it, going to offer his condolences...'

This was what struck Li Suining as odd. In his past life, Chen Jinxi had suppressed Nantanchen for a lifetime, thwarting him at every turn. Their conflict had been bitter, and the entire Chen Clan had never shown Nantanchen any kindness. Upon hearing of Chen Jinxi's death, Nantanchen should have laughed three times over.

'With his pillar gone, Chen Yang has suddenly reined himself in, with no mind to bother Nantanchen. That must be why he has risen so quickly in this life...'

He sighed with mixed feelings, but his greater concern was the situation on the shore. He was perpetually worried.

'King Wei was likely injured more severely this time and probably won't be coming out of seclusion anytime soon. Thankfully, no major disasters have occurred.'

He walked forward quickly and entered the great hall, announcing respectfully, 

"This junior, Suining, pays his respects to the old master!"

A curt grunt answered him, bidding him enter. Li Suining bowed again. 

"Suining's cultivation is complete. I have come to request a pill!"

He looked up and found the old man before him was gray-haired and weary, leaning back in the main seat. He seemed troubled, a book held in his hands. In the ambient light, his aged eyes seemed clouded, looking startlingly close to the image from Suining's memories. For a moment, Suining was lost in a daze.

'The master... he has aged so much.'

Li Xuanxuan, however, seemed not to notice. He stood with a pleased expression.

"You've finished regulating your qi... you're ready to break through!"

Li Suining quickly put on a smile. Li Xuanxuan helped him up personally, his eyes filled with approval.

"Sometimes I can't tell anymore," he sighed. "Whether it was Que'Wan or your younger granduncle back then, you children who grew up by the lake are all so sensible. The ones who grew up here on the islands... they just don't like to listen."

Li Suining thought he was referring to Li Zhouming and shook his head in confusion. Li Xuanxuan sighed again.

"That cousin your Uncle Jiangzong gave you... Li Suiqing... the older he gets, the more disobedient he becomes. His father was in seclusion for most of the years after he was born, but he was clearly taught by others. I don't know how he turned out this way. He's managed to displease everyone. But enough of that. Today is a happy occasion for you, let's not speak of such vexing things..."

Understanding dawned on Li Suining.

His uncle, Li Jiangzong, now handled most of the family's affairs and was a rare talent. He had a legitimate son, Li Suiqing, who was utterly useless.

Suining remembered him vividly. Li Suiqing had a mischievous personality, which he could curb when scolded by the elders, but his greed was an incurable flaw. He was repeatedly punished, eventually being sent out to a market town where his corruption was so severe he was dragged back to Qingdu and was never heard from again.

As the family grew, so did the number of both good and bad seeds. Since Suining wasn't at the Jade Court, he didn't know the details, but Li Suiqing's status was significant, and he was a great source of pain for Li Jiangzong, which was why Suining remembered him. He offered a few words of comfort.

"Cousin is still young... he still needs the old master's guidance."

Li Xuanxuan seemed agitated.

"How can he be considered young? Zhouming is at least always by my side, so I know his nature. I've observed Suiqing too. He isn't mischievous; he's malicious... How much can an old man like me change him?"

Suining was amazed by his sharp insight and drew a quiet breath, shaking his head inwardly.

'This is while King Wei is still around... Once he's gone, and the few Purple Mansion cultivators disappear or fall, that's when the real chaos will begin...'

As he was thinking, a cultivator in white robes rushed into the hall. He was an unfamiliar face with a low cultivation base. He announced himself three times before being allowed to enter, his face streaked with tears. He fell to his knees and cried out,

"Old Master... my old ancestor... he can't hold on any longer!"

Li Suining felt the old man before him freeze. Li Xuanxuan gasped for breath, stood up, and asked in a daze,

"Qiuyang... is it Qiuyang?"

The white-robed cultivator could only nod, sobbing. Tears welled in the old man's eyes.

"Qiuyang is even a few years older than me. It hasn't been easy... not easy at all! He was burned by the Merging Fire. Even with so many spiritual pills and Sun Bai's personal treatment, it only prolonged his suffering in his final years..."

A chill ran through Li Xuanxuan's limbs. He tossed the book onto the table and hurried out of the hall. Filled with concern, Li Suining quickly supported him, using the wind to help him along.

They flew all the way to the lakeshore before the old man seemed to come to his senses. Suining felt an icy grip on his wrist as the elder suddenly clutched his hand, choking back a sob in a state of bewildered helplessness.

"Suining... how much time do I have left to watch over you all? The Qingdu branch is arrogant, the Jade Court is strict, and the Daoist Masters only have eyes for a select few. Their minds are on heavenly matters. The day I'm gone... who will be there to unite the four branches of our family!"

# Chapter 1054: Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body

The light in the great hall was dim.

The dharma lamps to the side had been refilled three times, warming the entire chamber like a furnace, yet the old man on the couch remained damp and cold. He had lain there for three months, drifting between sleep and consciousness, when he suddenly remembered his surname was not Li.

'Back then, Father was called Ye Chengfu.'

When his father was still Ye Chengfu, their days were always a frantic rush. He seemed to run a small business at the village entrance, but work was scarce, so he often took odd jobs at others’ homes. Occasionally, he would return with a large sack of rice, beans, and wheat, striding proudly through the door and proclaiming himself the third-smartest man in Lijing Village.

Li Qiuyang couldn't remember much more. If he had managed to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, perhaps he could recall more of the past.

The old man lifted his head slightly. Beside him, Sun Bai was applying a balm to his lips, using the spiritual resources of Horn Wood and dharma power to nourish the 'lips'—the symbolic gateway for appetite in the context of Merging Fire. He hoped to prolong his life by a few more breaths, a desperate measure akin to drinking poison to quench one's thirst.

The old man stared blankly at the ceiling, his voice weak and thin. “Xuan… Xuan…”

A white-haired man nearby coughed twice and bowed his tall frame. Tears welled in his drooping eyes as he replied,

“Wait… just a little longer.”

Li Qiuyang’s memories were faded, but he still recalled kneeling before that old man as a small child to receive the "Azure Origin Wheel Nourishment Art."

Li Mutian had instructed him to honor the sect and revere the Dao, to be close to his relatives and live in harmony with his clan. And so, he had taken the surname Li.

With that one act, he, Li Qiuyang, had enjoyed a respected status for one hundred and sixty-five years. Now, at Moongaze Lake, even cultivators of the Foundation Establishment Realm had to treat him with courtesy.

“Old Ancestor… the master is here, the master is here!”

Through the haze, a gentle breeze drifted to his pillow. Li Qiuyang forced his eyes open, only to see another aged face. Li Xuanxuan looked even older than Chen Donghe, who stood beside him; he was a wreck, though his spirit and vitality remained intact. His face was stained with tears.

“Qiuyang… old friend. It looks like you’re leaving me too…”

Li Qiuyang struggled for a moment but couldn't turn over. If not for a Horn Wood Foundation Establishment cultivator sustaining him, he would have been long gone.

In his youth, Li Xuanxuan had run a shop in the Xiao Clan Market. He and Li Qiuyang had survived a demonic raid together, forging a bond in a time of peril. The current generation of the Li clan could no longer comprehend that kind of precarious, lonely fear. With so many of their old acquaintances gone, the two had often found comfort in each other's company, and their friendship ran deep.

The Li Qiuyang he once knew was gone. The man on the bed was like a lump of rotting flesh. Merging Fire had ravaged his essence and vitality. Although his body had been restored later, the damage to his foundation and lifespan was irreparable. Li Xuanxuan could barely recognize his features anymore, seeing only two turbid eyes peering from within the withered skin.

A profound sorrow welled up in Li Xuanxuan’s heart, followed by a terrifying loneliness. He lowered his head.

“Qiuyang… Qiuyang… what is it you can’t let go of?”

The old man on the bed let out two shallow breaths but gave no other response.

Li Qiuyang's talent hadn't been poor. The spirit fruit he consumed in his youth had accelerated his cultivation, but it had also doomed his chances at Qi Refining, forcing him to cultivate a miscellaneous form of Qi. Yet among his many descendants, not a single one had shown any real promise. After more than a century, none had managed to surpass him.

Li Qiuyang laboriously shifted his gaze to stare at Li Xuanxuan.

He had always known this brother from the main family held many secrets. He also knew he had never truly been part of the Li clan’s inner circle. And it wasn't just him. Even Chen Yang, for all her outstanding talent, had he truly been accepted after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm? The so-called Qingdu bloodline was nothing more than a joke.

But he had held Li Yuanxiu in his arms, led Li Xiangping’s horse, shared tea with Li Xuanfeng, and walked through Lixia with Chen Mufeng. Moons had set and suns had risen. He had witnessed sixty-two thousand sunsets over Moongaze Lake. For this land that had birthed and raised him, and for the people on it, he felt a deep, sorrowful love.

As if mustering his last ounce of strength, the old man’s lips parted, and he murmured, “Xuanxuan… they are too close…”

Li Xuanxuan’s brow twitched. He paused, stunned, then reached out to support him. A frightened Sun Bai rose to his feet, instructing a junior to moisten the Old Ancestor’s lips with medicinal soup before hastily retreating.

Li Xuanxuan seemed lost in thought, asking blankly,

“Who… who is too close?”

Li Qiuyang began to struggle, coughing so violently it seemed he would expel his lungs. He groaned,

“Out…”

Li Xuanxuan took the bowl of soup from the junior, waving his hand to dismiss the others. Chen Donghe raised an eyebrow, looking at the dying man on the couch. Seeing the intense stare fixed on him, he hid his tears and turned to leave.

Soon, only Li Xuanxuan remained in the vast hall. Li Qiuyang’s breathing grew ragged and intense. A sliver of strength returned to his hand, and he gripped Li Xuanxuan’s arm, his voice a strained, guttural hiss.

“They… and you… are too close… The Jiang… the Jiang family…”

Li Xuanxuan’s lips trembled. The old man’s teeth chattered as he began to spit blood.

“If… if he were here… only by crippling them all… would it be clean…” he mumbled.

Li Xuanxuan couldn’t tell who ‘he’ was—Old Ancestor Li Mutian? Or Li Xiangping? He certainly understood the reference to the Jiang family, but since Li Ximing had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he hadn't given the matter a thought for a very, very long time.

'The Jiang family… their ancestor was murdered… But our family is flourishing. Not to mention King Wei, both Jiangqian and Que'Wan are seeds for the Purple Mansion Realm. If we were ever to lose all our Purple Mansion experts, the clan would surely be annihilated. Why worry about internal strife now…'

He fell silent for a moment. The old man before him finally went still. Li Xuanxuan turned and sat on the steps, his choked sobs giving way to quiet weeping. A clutter of footsteps sounded from outside the hall. The first to rush in was an unfamiliar man who fell to his knees before Li Xuanxuan with a thud, wailing,

“Old Ancestor!”

A middle-aged man who followed close behind was knocked off balance but refused to be outdone. He too dropped to his knees, his cries even louder, his howls like thunder.

Li Xuanxuan raised his tear-filled eyes and scanned the crowd of descendants scrambling to get inside. With a dazed expression, he drew the curtain around the couch and, with a flick of his sleeve, sent them all tumbling out of the hall.

The chamber fell silent instantly. No one remained but Chen Donghe, who stood with his eyes closed, tears streaming down his face. After weeping for a while, Li Xuanxuan noticed that the cries outside were sparse, mostly replaced by whispers. He spoke, his voice devoid of energy,

“After six generations, the bonds of kinship have faded, but their foolishness remains as strong as ever.”

## Deer Weeds Island

The storm at sea had subsided, and the sky had taken on an eerie, verdant hue. All color was blocked out by the light of the grotto-mansion. On the walls, bluish-purple patterns flickered one by one, channeling a torrent of Spiritual Qi inward.

A woman in a white robe sat cross-legged in the center. Her willow-like eyebrows were curved, her expression serene. Her vermilion lips were slightly parted, as if holding a hazy, colorful glow. Her hands formed a seal at her abdomen, radiating a brilliant divine light.

After an unknown amount of time, she concluded her wondrous art. The colorful glow retracted into her Shengyang Acupoint. She rose to her feet, the light in her almond-shaped eyes brightening and then dimming as she exhaled, her eyebrows raised in satisfaction.

'The difficulty of mastering the "Rainbow Throne" is much lower than I anticipated… I estimate it will take no more than two years…'

In her early years, Li Que'wan had spent a vast amount of time on the Shamanic Talisman Dao. Her spiritual aperture was located between her eyebrows, allowing her to visualize the Shengyang Acupoint from a very early stage. Coupled with her exceptional talent for shamanic arts, cultivating this art had still felt like rowing against a current—arduous and slow.

Fortunately, that effort had not been in vain. When she switched to cultivating this secret technique, it felt as if she were unraveling a silk cocoon, each step clear as day. All that time spent in her youth was now paying back tenfold, as if she had divine assistance.

'The Whole Pill is a great test of one's Dao-Profundity. If an ordinary person were to cultivate the "Rainbow Throne," it would be impossible to succeed without ten or twenty years of effort… Yet in my hands, it feels so easy…'

She breathed a silent sigh of relief, though her thoughts drifted.

'I heard my clan uncle was enfeoffed as King Wei… I wonder how much trouble that will bring. It’s infuriating that I can only stay overseas, unable to help.'

Her desire to reach the Purple Mansion Realm grew more urgent by the day. Fortunately, she had patience and simply redoubled her efforts. Still, when the day came for the family letters to arrive, she always emerged from her seclusion on time.

As she walked out of her grotto-mansion, cultivators on both sides bowed deeply. Li Que'wan hurried onward and, just as she expected, saw the grotto's main hall shimmering with light. The pale blue patterns of the wall murals reflected off a violet-gold table. A man sat at its center, dressed in a white fur cloak with a precious pearl tied at his waist. Three vertical marks adorned his brow as he stared intently at a scroll on the table.

“Greetings, Daoist Master!”

This man was Daoist Master Yuanbian, Liu Changdie.

Liu Changdie appeared very composed. He had spent little time in seclusion these past years, choosing instead to guard this island. He used to venture out occasionally, but after that one stormy night, he had not taken a single step off the island.

The reason was simple: he was terrified.

The thunderstorm that night had been highly unnatural, clearly directed by someone. Liu Changdie had suppressed his impulse to investigate. Afterward, he secretly performed divinations and, combining them with the subtleties of his own divine ability, managed to uncover several clues.

'A powerful cultivator must have acted that night, likely targeting me… But they were wary of the grand formation and, being in the Eastern Sea, were thwarted by the Dragon-kin. That’s the only reason they failed!'

There was a reason Liu Changdie spent most of his years in the Southern Sea and the Eastern Sea. Many of the treasures he possessed were 'fated opportunities' he had stumbled upon in these waters. He had long suspected that the Dragon-kin had a vested interest in protecting him. This incident had confirmed all his prior suspicions.

'Even hiding here in the Eastern Sea, within this grand formation, there are still people who want to harm me… If I went elsewhere, who knows what would happen!'

Seeing Li Que'wan, Liu Changdie seemed pleased. He nodded at her and rose with a smile.

“You are quite punctual.”

When Liu Changdie first arrived on the island, he received instructions from Li Ximing to protect Li Que'wan at all costs. He had kept this in mind, and after a private conversation with her, he was utterly stunned by her heavenly talent. The depth of her Dao-Profundity and the clarity of her thinking when casting spell arts were not at all like those of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Upon further inquiry, he learned that Li Que'wan had practiced shamanic arts for many years, which explained a great deal.

'The Shamanic Talisman Dao is ancient, even more so than the Ancient Immortal Dao of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature or dining on mist and sipping dew. It points directly to the root of the Great Dao…'

The Ancient Immortal Dao of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature or dining on mist and sipping dew usually referred to the Three Profound Daoist Traditions, which originated from the Orthodox Origin Yin-Yang. One of these traditions had spread and evolved to become the Three Profoundities known throughout the world today. But the Shamanic Talisman Dao was a tradition that had spread across the world in the same era as the Orthodox Origin Yin-Yang!

'Within the Ancient Merging Method, the Shamanic Talisman Dao alone accounts for the earliest three figures: the Merging Owl, the Upper Shaman, and the Jade True. Furthermore, they occupy the most critical first, third, and sixth positions of the nine slots, which speaks to its immense power.'

'If one can achieve great things in the Shamanic Talisman Dao, commanding most of the spell arts of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao becomes effortless…'

Of course, achieving 'great things' was no small feat. It was not something one could accomplish by merely learning a few shamanic arts or mastering some curses. One had to be an orthodox successor of this Dao. The legendary Duanmu Kui, who could suppress all his peers, and Jiang Boqing, who was versed in the two paths of Immortals and Buddhists, were testaments to this.

For this reason, Liu Changdie held this junior from the Li clan in extremely high regard. He could already see her future path to the Purple Mansion Realm and had begun to treat her as a peer.

“Come!” he said with a smile. “Take a look at this!”

Li Que'wan’s respect for him deepened. She strode forward and stood beside the table. On it lay a golden scroll of soft material, seemingly woven from some kind of spirit silk. The runes upon it were abstruse, with several lines of large, colored characters.

[Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body].

As Li Que'wan examined it, Liu Changdie explained with a smile, “This scroll was sent by your family. They obtained it from some place called the Changxiao Gate. It’s an ancient artifact, locked with a secret preservation technique. They asked me to decipher it… It took quite some effort.”

“Now that it’s open, I see it is a wondrous method for Body-Swapping Transference, and a very sophisticated one at that. It can be used to refine an alternate body for preserving one’s life, cultivating the Dao, evading tribulations, and avoiding disasters. If one’s Dao-Profundity is high enough and they possess some rare treasures, they might even be able to use this art for reincarnation.”

Li Que'wan’s eyes burned with intensity as she stared at the golden script. 

“It’s so precious!” she exclaimed.

Although Li Que'wan wasn't entirely clear on Li Zhouwei's current situation, she understood the principle that once one's divine ability was perfected, the only paths forward were seeking the Golden Core or reincarnation. The thought that this might be useful to her own Daoist Master brought a radiant smile to her face, and she studied the scroll with great care.

Such an item might not have been extraordinary in ancient times, but today, when methods for reincarnation and Great Void-walking were mostly lost, it was invaluable. Liu Changdie nodded in agreement.

“A pity,” he sighed. “Its primary purposes are the first four. The reincarnation aspect is merely a side benefit. The resources required to refine an alternate body to the point where it could be used for reincarnation… one could probably cultivate several Purple Mansion experts or acquire numerous new divine abilities for oneself with that amount of wealth. And it wouldn't even add much to the chances of success. Why bother?”

“Compared to ancient demon embryos, the Ten-Colored Heart-Uniting Pearl… or even Metallic Essence, the probability of this technique succeeding is far too low, and it comes with many side effects. It can only be considered a final resort, a path taken out of desperation.”

He chuckled.

“In any case… it is still precious. I was fortunate enough to get a few good looks at it.”

Li Que'wan quickly shook her head, saying respectfully,

“Your friendship with our family’s Daoist Master is profound; it was only right that it be sent to you to share. How could you say such a thing? We couldn’t possibly let you spend so much time deciphering the scroll for nothing…”

Liu Changdie shook his head and laughed. He had long since stopped considering his time a precious commodity. He took a letter from his sleeve and said,

“A letter from home… Go on, read it.”

Li Que'wan received it like a treasure and began to read. Liu Changdie watched her profile and sighed inwardly.

'I used to think… if I still had a son or daughter, I could arrange a match with her. But looking at her now… even if I did have a child, they would not be worthy of her.'

As Liu Changdie was lost in thought, a figure hurried into the grotto. The man bowed before him and reported respectfully,

“Daoist Master… there is a… a Demon King waiting outside the island! He… wishes to see you!”

'A Demon King?!'

Liu Changdie’s first thought was of the Dragon-kin, and his heart leaped in alarm. But then, he felt a sudden resonance and took a golden jade pendant from his sleeve. A closer look brought a flash of understanding and a hint of embarrassment.

'It's Senior Fuxun! He’s come to find me!'

# Chapter 1055: Possession

Liu Changdie rolled up the scroll in his hands and dismissed Li Que'wan. He then hurried to the edge of the great formation, where he saw a lone figure standing above the churning sea. The man’s eyes were a startling mix of white and red. He was clad in bone armor and blood-red silks, a pair of golden wings folded neatly behind him as he stood in silence.

Seeing his faint and listless aura, Liu Changdie was filled with sorrow. He quickly opened a path in the formation and gestured for the man to enter. The Demon King strode in with his hands behind his back, staggering like a lost soul.

He cried out in a rasping voice, "Gods… I almost didn't make it!"

Liu Changdie sighed. As he led the man inside, he retrieved a vial of spirit pills from his sleeve.

"Are you feeling any better?"

Fuxun took the jade vial, uncorked it, and, to Liu Changdie’s pained expression, poured the pills into his cavernous mouth as if they were candy. The demon beast didn't seem to taste them at all. He smacked his lips, his red eyes fixed on Liu Changdie.

"What are you looking so pained for? Following that great Alchemist, how could you possibly be short on pills?"

Li Ximing had indeed refined and left behind pills for him when he came for the cultivation art, but Liu Changdie was exceptionally frugal. He shook his head and sighed.

"These are not normal times. He possesses an abundance of spiritual materials and resources, so much so that even the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition in its heyday was never so extravagant. Besides… how could I simply take his things for free!"

Others might not have known, but Liu Changdie had been the one to handle every single transaction for the Neck Feathers. He even knew that the supply of Wall-Sinking Water from the Eastern Sea had dried up long ago, halting production entirely. Liu Changdie knew exactly how luxurious Li Ximing’s cultivation was. Even with his own considerable wealth, he could only admit his own inferiority.

Meanwhile, Fuxun had taken a seat. He glanced around the wondrous, blue-and-gold cave-residence with a nod of approval, then began brewing himself a pot of tea while cursing.

"Damn that blasted White Victory Dao! Damn that Zha'xi Ciwang! The day I achieve the Dao and become a great Demon King, I’ll punch three holes straight through their sacred palace!"

Liu Changdie frowned. He watched as the demon beast lifted his robes, revealing three massive holes in his otherwise flawless, jade-like Dharma Body. But inside the wounds, there was no bone or flesh. Instead, they looked like a rich man's cellar; golden sand cascaded like a waterfall, with gold tables and chairs scattered about. Emeralds and rubies the size of fingernails dotted the scene, where one or two lavishly dressed, thumb-sized lesser demons knelt in the sand, weeping.

Liu Changdie stared, stunned for a moment.

"The Xipo Kingdom is lost? Who took it!"

"Lost, of course it's lost!" Fuxun said mournfully. "Carved up by those bastards. Luckily, I took an Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill long ago and successfully refined the Observing Jin Auspicious Body. I gathered all my subordinates and fled, otherwise I'd be all alone today!"

The profundity of Fuxun's Observing Jin Auspicious Body was limitless. While it bore some resemblance to the Murong clan’s ability to contain things within their bodies, its fundamental nature was entirely different. In essence, it was a Body Divine Ability that created an enormous physical form, allowing countless demons to attach themselves to it. The art then transformed this main body and all the attached demons into a new shape, concealing them beneath his skin.

Liu Changdie was momentarily speechless. He didn't believe for a second that Fuxun was particularly benevolent toward his so-called subordinates. They were there for two reasons: one, to run errands, serve him, and help him cultivate his Dharma Body; and two, they were probably emergency rations for when his injuries became unstable.

Though he was certain of this, he asked aloud,

"Senior Qingyan…"

Fuxun’s face contorted with grief and despair.

"They captured him!" he spat through gritted teeth.

"What?!"

Liu Changdie had anticipated that the two demons might face a calamity, but he never imagined it would be this severe. He was horrified.

"Senior Qingyan… How could they have calculated his whereabouts! Doesn't he possess a wondrous art to conceal himself? Situ Huo ambushed him for ten years and never caught him… How could…"

He cut himself off, suddenly realizing that Situ Huo was nothing compared to the White Victory Dao. He fell silent.

Fuxun said bitterly,

"The White Victory Dao is not what it once was. That great lord must be showing signs of revival, perhaps he's even regained some ability to act! Only by borrowing his divine power could they have schemed against Qingyan so easily!"

At the mention of the fiend from the Great Western Plateau, a flicker of terror crossed Fuxun's eyes, and he seemed momentarily flustered.

"When the White Victory Dao ambushed us, we were no match for them. Fortunately, Qingyan still had that Azure Tome of Subjugation. He used it to buy us a chance to escape from the White Victory Dao Lord, though it came at the cost of grievous injury. But that man has a Profound Banner! As long as our wounds haven't healed, they can track us anywhere!"

"We fled in terror, even casting an art to call for your help, but we were out of hope. That wondrous art you mentioned… it was enough to fool someone like Situ Huo, but how could it ever deceive the White Victory Dao Lord? He carried the Wind-Horse Profound Banner. Even though Qingyan's art let him flee over a thousand miles, a single wave of that banner was all it took to find him again. If I hadn't broken away when I did… I would’ve been captured along with him!"

A wave of guilt and unease washed over Liu Changdie. He lowered his head. 

"It's not that I wouldn't save you… That night, this place was wracked with lightning and thunder. A Daoist Master was lying in ambush nearby, waiting for me. If I had gone out, I wouldn't have been able to save myself either."

The Demon King began to wail at the table. His tears fell like crystals, and as a Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat, a naturally strange species, a fragrant powder scattered where they landed, filling the air with an exotic scent. After crying for a while, he shook his head.

"How could I ever distrust you! I figured it out long ago. Since they were so determined to capture Qingyan, they would have been watching from every angle. How could they possibly have let you come to the rescue!"

He collapsed back in his seat, utterly devastated.

"Such pain!"

Liu Changdie wasn't as close with Qingyan as he was with Fuxun, but they were well-acquainted. A storm of complex emotions churned within him, and a surge of grief rose in his heart.

"What could I have done even if I had saved you?" he sighed. "The White Victory Dao Lord came personally. How many rounds could I last against him…"

But just as the demon before him lowered his head, his jade-white cheek suddenly began to writhe, as if something underneath were struggling violently to break free. A grotesque, fist-sized face tore its way out. Its two eyes were hollow sockets, the flesh sunken in, and they stared blankly at Liu Changdie.

Liu Changdie staggered back a step in shock.

"What foul creature are you!" he roared.

His shout was infused with divine ability and dharma power, yet it only caused the fist-sized face to pause for a moment. Its hollow eyes shifted, as if surveying the surroundings. Fuxun’s reaction, however, was faster. His hands shot up and viciously clamped down on the face.

The tumor-like visage was instantly crushed. Pale golden blood burst from between his fingers, releasing a strange fragrance. Fuxun wiped the blood away, his eyes cold and vicious as he broke into a violent coughing fit.

Liu Changdie’s brow was tightly furrowed. He remained silent for a long time. After his coughing subsided, Fuxun knew the other man was waiting for an explanation. He forced a smile.

"I was hit by the White Victory Dao Lord's Lesser Yang art. My Dharma Body is probably filled with these little Yang Worms, all eagerly waiting to report back to him."

Seeing Liu Changdie’s tense expression, Fuxun understood and quickly shook his head.

"Don't worry, don't worry. I came here during a gap when they were being summoned by his prayer banner. Once I entered the great formation and was sealed off from the Great Void, it got much better. No message can get out now, so relax… _cough_… _cough_…"

Only then did Liu Changdie feel some relief, though he was still torn between sympathy and anxiety.

"It's not that I'm being suspicious," he said in a low voice. "This Deer Weeds Island is Li Ximing's territory. It's already a great kindness that he allows me to cultivate here. If something were to happen, if I were to bring disaster down upon this place… how could I ever face him!"

They looked at each other in silence. Liu Changdie sighed.

"I will take responsibility for your injury. Supreme Yang spiritual items are hard to find, but I'll think of other ways. I can contact some high-level cultivators who specialize in healing arts for you. For now, just stay here and recuperate, senior."

Fuxun lowered his head, wanting to say something grateful, but no words came out. He simply raised his cup. After a long pause, he sighed. "After this battle, the Great Western Plateau now looks down upon Poluoduo, controlling it completely. There's no going back. All the demon beasts in Poluoduo are in for a world of pain… and I have nowhere left to run!"

"My family, my followers… their upkeep is immense. And I myself must pursue the Dao. I certainly can't go to the outer seas. The Western Sea, the Northern Sea… is there any place for me in either?"

Liu Changdie remained silent, shaking his head.

"Where else can you go now? I doubt you even dare to step outside this formation!"

Despite his words, he began to think of a path forward for the Demon King. 

"What about… the Dragon-kin?"

A flicker of interest appeared in Fuxun’s eyes, but he shook his head hesitantly, gritting his teeth.

"My bloodline is… unusual. I’m truly afraid one of the Dragon Kings might just eat me! Before coming here, I had to ask around through my connections. Otherwise, how would I dare just stroll into this territory?"

"And even if I weren't eaten… my future would be uncertain. We demons are not like you humans. If they have no use for me, how could I dare to pledge allegiance so recklessly!"

Sensing that Fuxun had something more to say, Liu Changdie asked,

"It seems you have a plan, senior."

Fuxun sighed.

"To be honest, I'm at my wit's end. The White Victory Dao never had room for me; it's just that I used to keep a low profile… prancing around outside their line of sight."

"They are notoriously vengeful. That old friend of my father's… all he did was step in to save someone, and he later died a miserable death at their hands. It's only because you didn't come to our rescue that I can hide here with you for a while."

He looked somewhat embarrassed.

"That… that White Qilin… he has ties with the Dragon-kin. I was hoping that through him… I might find a powerful backer."

Liu Changdie finally understood. He was silent for a long time.

'Dragon-kin… And since when are dragons a benevolent sort? Li Zhouwei calls himself the White Qilin and seems close with the dragons, but who doesn't know what that bunch from the Hornless Dragon lineage is scheming!'

Liu Changdie knew nothing of the great powers' grand plans, but he would bet his life that the Dragon-kin had ulterior motives. Unless it was a last resort, he truly didn't want to trouble Li Ximing.

'I just hope this doesn't attract any major trouble.'

But Fuxun's situation was also important. He was caught between a rock and a hard place. After a long silence, Liu Changdie finally replied,

"I will ask on your behalf, senior. But I cannot promise whether it will succeed or fail."

He chose a cave-residence for Fuxun to enter seclusion. After the earlier episode, the Demon King's condition seemed to have worsened. He stumbled as he walked, and worse, his mind seemed to be wandering, a clear sign that his foundations had been shaken.

Liu Changdie silently shook his head and left. He had only taken a few steps when he saw Li Que'wan hurrying across the main hall, her face slightly pale.

Liu Changdie quickly called out to her.

"The senior's arrival was sudden," he said with a sigh. "I will write a letter to Ximing. You need not worry."

"I will prepare the things he needs for his recovery. However, he still has many subordinates with him. I'll have to trouble you to arrange for some people to prepare spirit grain and food for him on a daily basis."

Li Que'wan lowered her gaze slightly, her expression quickly returning to one of composure. 

"Yes," she said respectfully.

Liu Changdie sighed inwardly.

'Gaining a Demon King for no reason… This probably won't be easy to explain to Ximing.'

---

In the hall of white jade, which was like a construct of snow, the light of the sun and moon shone down together. A pale azure sword was embedded among the bright white jade stones, with a cup of clear tea balanced on its hilt. No matter how the longsword trembled, it could not dislodge the cup.

'Fuxun…'

On the table lay an azure scroll, its pale gold, mystical patterns flickering in and out of sight. The man beside the table wasn't looking at the sword, but was gazing out beyond the realm's border, lost in thought.

After the fall of Wanling Heaven, Lu Jiangxian had been forced to divide his attention. He had to monitor the overall situation, compose the method for seeking Gold for Chi Buzi, and simultaneously suppress the Way of the Sword dao inheritance within Li Jiangchun. He was incredibly busy.

The most mentally taxing of these tasks was the method for seeking Gold. Such methods were inherently difficult to create, and Chi Buzi’s was a unique case. The theory behind it was sound, but there was a world of difference between a mere Daoist treatise and actually writing out the complete method. Its profundity and difficulty made the Nine Dao Secret Arts he had created in the past—which had the benefit of borrowing from existing Metallic Essence concepts—seem like child's play in comparison.

In truth, Li Zhouwei’s method for seeking Gold was equally important, but he hadn't even started on it yet. Lu Jiangxian was confident he could manage Li Zhouwei's cultivation progress; there was still time. Chi Buzi, on the other hand, was a rare, unpredictable piece on the board. His mind was flighty, and he had ties to various powers. His future trajectory, under the indirect influence of the various Dao Embryo plots, had become difficult to calculate.

Therefore, Lu Jiangxian had prioritized his method, in case the situation suddenly changed and Chi Buzi found himself standing at the forefront of a new era with an empty mind, staring blankly at Du Qing after regaining his memories.

It was because his attention was so divided that Lu Jiangxian’s perception of the Eastern Sea was not as sharp as usual. Fortunately, Li Que'wan was an astute and careful person. The moment she saw a Demon King enter the formation, she had naturally used the Immortal Mirror to scan him. That single scan was enough to jolt Lu Jiangxian to full attention.

'Something's wrong…'

Under the illumination of his divine sense, a bright golden thread, fine as a hair, hovered above Fuxun's head, attached to some distant, intangible point. And on the back of his head, another face was faintly visible. It had sharp teeth, golden lips, a low-bridged nose, and pure white pupils. Its features writhed and shifted, roaming erratically across the back of his skull.

The first instant Lu Jiangxian saw it, he knew this creature was not of the Purple Mansion Realm. He was shaken. Looking closer, he detected the flavor of Metallic Essence… He searched his memory and suddenly recalled that strange True Qi bird from long ago!

'Liu Changdie, oh, Liu Changdie, you've invited a plague into your home!'

A Metallic Essence fiend!

A world-destroying monster, exceedingly rare in the current age!

Upon careful consideration, it was clear this fiend had cultivated some wondrous art. It was hidden so perfectly, almost completely cut off from all external information, that it had to rely on Fuxun’s injuries "flaring up" just to observe the outside world. This spoke to its incredible skill, but a fiend's cunning nature did nothing to reduce the danger it posed.

Fuxun thought he was merely injured, that there were still Yang Worms left by the White Victory Dao Lord that he had yet to expel. In reality, it was just the fiend occasionally stirring, wanting to use his body as a vessel to peer out at the world!

'It's perfectly normal that Li Que'wan was scared white… In fact, her ignorance was bliss. She only thought it was terrifying because of how it looked. If she truly knew what this thing was, forget her, even Chi Buzi would be drenched in a cold sweat. This is a fiend… something involving a Golden Core existence!'

If this fiend were to go berserk, it wouldn't matter if the Purple Mansion Realm formation could hold it. The entire island chain would be transformed into a living hell. Sovereign Fire, Minister Fire, Dawn Fire… all sorts of spiritual flames would manifest alongside the light of the Lesser Yang, and the next thing to descend would be the true body of the Dragon Monarch of the Northern Sea!

Lu Jiangxian frowned and watched for a long while. He saw that Fuxun’s expression was normal, but he didn't dare look away. Watching him crush the "Yang Worm" on his face, Lu Jiangxian felt a chill in his heart and muttered to himself.

'Where is the Underworld? And the two Dragon Monarchs in the Eastern Sea… how can they have no reaction at all?'

# Chapter 1056: Clarity

A cultivator's Metallic Essence is the crystallization of their life-mandate and Dao-fruit. Supremely exalted and precious, it is a treasure coveted by all under heaven.

Based on Lu Jiangxian's current Dao-Profundity and his understanding of the True Monarch level, the Metallic Essence was something forged within oneself, a power that truly belonged to the cultivator. A Fruition Attainment, on the other hand, was a station granted by Heaven and Earth. Cultivators today often spoke of seeking this golden state of being, a process that involved two distinct stages: forging the essence and ascending to the station. Most only ever managed to complete the first step.

The late Duanmu Kui and, more recently, Si Boxiu had both forged a Metallic Essence. Once such an essence became ownerless, it would be seized by the energies of Heaven and Earth and transform into a demonic entity. In Lu Jiangxian's view, however, these Demons existed in a clear hierarchy.

'A Metallic Essence is fundamentally the cultivator's life-mandate and Dao-fruit. If that cultivator was the master of a Fruition Attainment, the station would recognize them, and by extension, it would recognize their Metallic Essence. Thus, the essence inherits the master's authority...'

These Demons were born with an innate connection to their Fruition Attainment, making them incredibly difficult to oppose. The vile bird formed from the True Monarch Tianwu's Metallic Essence was a prime example; even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator empowered by a divine ability was as fragile as a mortal before the authority of a Fruition Attainment.

But what about the Demons formed from the Metallic Essence of those like Duanmu Kui and Si Boxiu, who had died while attempting to forge their own? How much weaker were they? Lu Jiangxian had carefully considered this and arrived at a surprising conclusion.

'The Demons that manifest after a failed breakthrough... they aren't actually that much weaker.'

The key lay in the nature of failure within the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.

The moment Lu Jiangxian had seen Wang Xun practicing ancient immortal methods, he knew the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was a shortcut. It didn't seek to align with one's destiny but instead gambled a lifetime of cultivation on a single moment of connection with a Fruition Attainment. Only in that instant of seeking the Dao, as prescribed by the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao, could a Metallic Essence even be said to exist.

When a cultivator seeks to forge their essence and ascend to a station, they are essentially petitioning the station with their own Metallic Essence. In that moment, as long as the station is unoccupied, the Fruition Attainment has already sensed them. To use a crude analogy, the wisp of Metallic Essence left behind from a failed attempt has already become familiar to the station. While its power might diminish over time, in the immediate aftermath of the failure, the resulting Demon is no less formidable than those left from antiquity.

'That's why the Underworld has to dispatch Dharma Treasures... Firstly, their agents in the mortal realm aren't powerful enough and could let some of the more unique Metallic Essences escape. Secondly... some people's Metallic Essences are just that formidable.'

Beyond these, however, was another possibility. Practitioners of ancient Daoist Traditions like the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature, the Shamanic Talisman Dao, or ancient demonic paths—traditions that perfected the life-mandate—could condense a Metallic Essence without ever seeking a Fruition Attainment. They might use it to benefit their descendants or bribe emissaries of the afterlife.

The Demons that condensed from such essences were far inferior to the other two types.

Understanding these distinctions, Lu Jiangxian needed only a single glance to know that the thing on Fuxun was extraordinary.

'It possesses a stable, tyrannical authority. If it goes berserk, the devastation it could unleash would rival that of a True Monarch!'

Ordinarily, the great powers of the world should have been aware of such a significant matter. Yet, Lu Jiangxian had meticulously scanned the Great Void and scoured the mortal realm, finding no trace of them aside from a few Dragon-kin patrols guarding the seas.

'It's not impossible that they simply haven't noticed. After all, this thing was so well hidden that I only detected it after Li Que'wan activated her investigative art...'

Lu Jiangxian had encountered a fair number of True Monarchs over the years, and his spiritual sense was ultimately a cut above. If even he had such difficulty, it was plausible that the other True Monarchs had missed it as well.

'In that case, this entity is no ordinary Demon. It must be the result of some True Monarch's specific technique...'

'Lesser Yang...'

The most likely culprit at the moment was the Demon Monarch from the Great Western Plateau, Xiyan. His full title was the Western Eternal Loyalty White Victory Yan True Monarch. As a demon monarch, it wouldn't be surprising if he had some insidious methods up his sleeve.

He focused his gaze. Fuxun had already settled down in the secret chamber, consuming spiritual items to heal his wounds. Suddenly, the five facial features on the back of his head began to twist, sliding down his cheeks to his chest, then along his waist until they came to rest on his ankle.

The golden lips parted slightly in a smile. They then leaped from his ankle onto the floor, which was covered in array patterns. The pure white eyes remained on his thigh, gazing down at the floor as if guiding the way.

The thing was unsettlingly demonic. The golden lips seemed perfectly natural lying on the floor, not disturbing the grand array in the slightest. The powdered lips twitched, as if the entity might stand up at any moment, treating the entire island as its body.

'If this thing latches onto a member of the Li family, I might be able to fight it quietly. But if it devours all of Deer Weeds Island, the commotion would be so great that no one would survive...'

If the Metallic Essence Demon voluntarily transferred itself to Li Que'wan, Lu Jiangxian was confident he could suppress it. Even if it refused, should Fuxun agree to enter an immortal array, Lu Jiangxian would dare to risk a direct confrontation. But all of this was predicated on it being an ordinary Demon. A doubt lingered in his heart. How could he know if this Demon wasn't some True Monarch's hidden gambit... or perhaps even part of a consensus reached among all of them?

'It's not impossible for a True Monarch to split off a sliver of their Metallic Essence to roam the world! True Monarch Tianwu was able to leave behind three suits of armor as guardians, so why couldn't the others do something similar?'

If that were the case, and the entity simply vanished after attaching itself to Li Que'wan, it would be a dead giveaway.

Fortunately, after wandering about the secret chamber for a while, the lips seemed dissatisfied. They jumped back onto Fuxun's body and retreated to the back of his head, where they began to whisper fiercely amongst themselves.

Lu Jiangxian’s brow furrowed slightly as he listened intently, his suspicions growing stronger.

'This thing has an incredibly high intellect... and possesses multiple consciousnesses that can argue with each other... This is definitely no ordinary Demon!'

Realizing this, he paradoxically felt a sense of relief, though it was mixed with vexation.

"Since it's so intelligent, even if it doesn't understand its master's grand plan, it should at least know how to protect itself and won't erupt without reason. Fuxun wants to join the Dragon-kin now... this might be the entity's suggestion. Perhaps the Demon itself wants to find the dragons... If the Li Clan agrees... we'll be drawn into this mess. But if I ignore it, who knows what madness this Demon will unleash..."

After weighing his options, Lu Jiangxian decided to observe the situation for now. He would first see how the entity reacted before having Li Zhouwei deal with it, effectively passing the time bomb to the Dragon-kin.

His attention divided, he had long since stopped writing, his mind clouded with worry.

'Yang Tianya...'

When Li Zhouwei was heading to Simin, the cultivators of the Yang Clan were holding a secret meeting in their main hall. Though he wasn't physically present, his Immortal Mirror's investigative illumination allowed him to hear their words clearly from afar.

And the name they mentioned, Xuan'an, was the exact same one Chi Buzi had heard from Dingjiao!

'The power behind Mount Dali is a remnant of the Immortal Mansion. It's Xuan'an, and the Azure Insight Origin Mirror.'

He pondered for a moment, his thoughts racing.

"Qingyu Qian and Xuan'an control an immortal array, command the Moon Laurel’s Transmuting Radiance, and possess an Immortal Artifact—the one they call the Azure Insight Origin Mirror..."

This was a crucial clue. The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book couldn't calculate the schemes of a Dao Embryo, nor could it divine an Immortal Artifact. When he had performed his calculations, the Immortal Mirror itself and many of his conjectured Dao Embryo techniques had been input as known variables. The fact that the Azure Insight Origin Mirror could be calculated meant it wasn't a secret; many smaller Golden Core powers knew of this Immortal Artifact and had revealed its existence.

Through repeated calculations, Lu Jiangxian had even managed to obtain a brief description of the artifact.

'The Azure Insight Origin Mirror... an artifact of an ancient Immortal Lord, capable of making diviners miscalculate and observers miss their mark...'

The strange thing was, Lu Jiangxian couldn't detect the presence of such an Immortal Artifact over the lake at all!

'Either it doesn't exist, or it isn't in the Great Void and doesn't operate through it... If neither of these is true, then the only possibility is that my own broken Profound Mirror is at the Dao Embryo level, the same as an Immortal Artifact, which means they can't sense each other...'

But if Lu Jiangxian couldn't sense it, it meant the fox Demons might know many of the lake's secrets. Qingyu Qian had even specifically cultivated the Celestial-Awakening Ear just to listen to the mortals around the lake. The Demon King claimed he never used it, but if there were no restrictions, how could he possibly resist?

'Mount Dali is a remnant of the Immortal Mansion, a gambit left by its master. The Azure Insight Origin Mirror and Qingyu Qian were left to protect me during my initial stages... And the Moon Laurel’s Transmuting Radiance is key to keeping Moongaze Lake from being completely exposed. Otherwise, with a True Monarch overseeing Moongaze, I wouldn't be able to do anything...'

Although he had never seen the Moon Laurel’s Transmuting Radiance, he had seen something remarkably similar—the Golden Crow's Transmuting Radiance.

That power resided within an immortal array at the bottom of the sea, used to suppress it. Its might was so great that not even a True Monarch could withstand it. That array was precisely where Li Jiangqun had held secret discussions with other cultivators years ago!

'So... there's more than one such immortal array... There must be a corresponding Supreme Yin immortal array... Xuan'an, despite his weakened state, can still influence the world... He must be relying on this Moon Laurel’s Transmuting Radiance...'

'This array is either in the Immortal Mansion's Donghua Heaven, or the Mystic Realm the fox-kin are hiding in is the array itself, allowing them to remain concealed from the Great Void. That has to be it...'

As for Xuan'an... Lu Jiangxian was not entirely without a clue!

When Wanling Heaven fell, the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book had unleashed numerous influences upon the world. Lu Jiangxian had seized the opportunity to set his own plans in motion, using Li Suining as an overt piece on the board, openly exerting the power of the heavenly book.

Because this gambit was so obvious, the moment Li Suining was reborn with altered memories, a power descended from the heavens to investigate him. Lu Jiangxian had been lying in wait, eager to see which faction was monitoring the lake, and he caught the culprit red-handed!

That was when Lu Jiangxian became certain that there was an existence beyond the Purple Mansion Realm behind the fox clan.

Although the aura vanished in an instant, Lu Jiangxian was far more powerful now than before. Having personally used the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book for deductions, he immediately identified the aura as belonging to the Heaven–Governing Dao. The realization brought a strange expression to his face.

The aura possessed an extremely high status but seemed to be suppressed by something, leaving it utterly exhausted. If the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book hadn't been a Rank Designation of the Heaven–Governing Dao, allowing him to leverage its authority to intercept the probe, it would have dissipated into thin air midway.

This led Lu Jiangxian to a secret conjecture.

"Either this Xuan'an is incredibly weak... or... he is not the true master of the Immortal Artifact and is himself constrained by the Azure Insight Origin Mirror's influence! If it's the latter, my position becomes much more advantageous!"

But regardless of which it was, the fox-kin had been instrumental in allowing the Li Clan to develop safely to this point. Knowing the other party possessed an immortal array and an Immortal Artifact, Lu Jiangxian did not act rashly. He simply made a mental note.

'For now, I'll watch how things unfold. I'll wait for Li Zhouwei and Chi Buzi to perfect their divine abilities and uncover more high-level secrets... to see the true origins of these people... It would be best to wait until Li Zhouwei overcomes his current tribulation... and I take my own most crucial step before deciding anything.'

His gaze shifted, returning to Fuxun in the secret chamber.

'If I don't get rid of this thing quickly... how can Li Que'wan possibly enter seclusion on this island? At her current Dao-Profundity, she should be ready for seclusion in five or six years... Five or six years... Li Zhouwei should also be coming out of seclusion once by then. Alas... but that means I'll have to divert my attention to watch over the island during that time.'

He wasn't surprised that Li Que'wan's cultivation speed was accelerating. If a secret art was an extremely difficult exam, she had already been studying the answer key for decades.

'By distributing the time needed to practice secret arts across the earlier years of cultivation, those foundational Daoist principles can in turn aid one's progress and breakthroughs at every stage... This is probably how the Golden Core Daoist Traditions cultivate their disciples...'

This method was slower in the early stages but offered nothing but benefits later on. The only catch was that it required profound Daoist arts that were closely linked to Purple Mansion Realm secret arts—something only a power with a seated True Monarch could possibly provide.

It was precisely because this model of studying advanced arts early on was so beneficial for the Purple Mansion Realm that Lu Jiangxian, having tasted its sweetness, had hastily chosen the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record for Li Jiangchun. This wasn't just to delay his name from appearing on the Sword Gate's registry, giving him more time to develop, but also for his future in the Purple Mansion Realm!

This art couldn't compare to the Shamanic Talisman Dao, but it was still a carefully considered choice. When the time came... even if Li Jiangchun's speed in practicing secret arts couldn't match Li Que'wan's, it would still far surpass Li Jiangqian's.

'The All-Fragrance Sinks he practices, while situated within the three yins, is a Lesser Yin foundation, which contains a great deal of yang. Cultivating in a place of Bright Yang isn't a bad choice. Furthermore, All-Fragrance Sinks is at the confluence of Lesser Yin and Pure Qi, which has the effect of boosting cultivation. Thanks to Li Suining's interference, Li Ximing was never injured and didn't get entangled with the White Victory Dao. If Ximing is lucky and can really get him the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew from the Peacock Sea—a spiritual herb with a perfectly compatible origin—I'll have less to worry about for him.'

'Besides... with this change, he's obtained a wisp of Purple Qi, and Li Ximing's World's Radiance is finally complete. In the worst-case scenario I divined, it took him five full attempts...'

Although Lu Jiangxian didn't know much about the Lesser Yin Fruition Attainment, his choice of that path had been carefully considered. He still held most of the divine ability cultivation he had taken from Shaohui for Chi Buzi's Profound Blade. As soon as he had the chance to bestow it upon Li Ximing and help him form his core, pairing it with the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew would make Li Jiangchun's cultivation speed before and after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm truly terrifying.

'The only problem is that the cultivation method he uses has been modified by me to have the potential of a sixth-grade art, but he doesn't have a single secret art to go with it. That's another project entirely!'

Feeling a bitter taste in his heart, he had no choice but to pull several more cultivation methods and spell arts from the pile of divinations on his desk—ones the Li family was projected to acquire. He sent them off for Dangjiang to work overtime modifying them, lest he be the only one buried in work.




# Chapter 1057: Silver Light

Simin.

The morning sun scattered its light across the stacked eaves of the grand pavilions, making the newly constructed official residence seem majestic and imposing. Several carriages hurriedly pulled up before the estate, and servants began unloading large, heavy chests, carrying them one by one into the mansion.

"Your Excellency, we've arrived at Adjutant Li's residence."

A servant leading the procession bowed his head and spoke softly. The carriage curtain was immediately drawn back, and a man stepped out. Dressed in robes of azure and white, with handsome features, his presence was unforgettable. A mark of violet-blue adorned the space between his brows, etched with the intricate pattern of a purple-gold python. He nodded to the attendant at the gate.

"Please inform your master that Li Jiangliang, Grand Emissary of the Profound from the Palace of Revering Martial Arts, requests an audience."

The attendant vanished inside, taking the steps two at a time. Moments later, a powerfully built young man strode out from the mansion's interior. Cupping his fists in a salute at the entrance, he said,

"Greetings, Your Excellency!"

Li Jiangliang raised an eyebrow. Their golden eyes met for an instant, and he smiled.

"It has been a long time, brother. You haven't changed a bit."

Li Jiangxia watched him quietly for a moment before breaking into a wide grin. 

"Please, come in, Your Excellency."

Li Jiangliang dismissed his entourage, instructing them to carry the lavish gifts inside. He followed his brother through the halls and into the main chamber. Once they were seated in the opulent residence, he sighed.

"You've grown so distant, brother."

"Oh?" Li Jiangxia heard this and let out a hearty laugh, his golden eyes radiating a frank and magnanimous air. He shook his head.

"I am not Li Jianglong. I don't hold such petty grudges. I am immensely proud of the heights you've reached today. This isn't distance; it's a matter of status. You dared to take risks, to forge your own path, and you obtained a divine ability. You have earned the title of 'Your Excellency.'"

The violet-blue mark between his fourth brother's brows had grown deeper, and his aura had clearly surpassed the Foundation Establishment Realm, pulsing with the might of a divine ability.

When Yang Zhuo became emperor, he was clearly one of the first to reap the rewards.

But Li Jiangliang disagreed with his words. He shook his head.

"You're wrong, brother. It has nothing to do with daring to take risks. The current situation simply has a use for me. I am well aware of my own capabilities."

Though Li Jiangxia was only in the Foundation Establishment Realm, his presence seemed even weightier than his brother's. He chuckled and replied, 

"The Emperor's rewards are generous indeed—power, a grand residence, spiritual resources, beautiful women... I feel I am unworthy of them."

At this, Li Jiangliang's expression turned serious.

"The Emperor has mentioned to me several times that among all his generals, he favors you the most. He intends to promote you past your rank, to have you enter the palace and become a Holder of the Profound... Compared to that, this residence and these resources are nothing."

The positions within the Purple and Gold Palace were not granted all at once but were awarded based on territory and authority. The highest rank was Holder of the Profound. Yang Zhuo's intention was clear: he wanted Li Jiangxia to be the foremost of his military commanders.

Seeing his brother's noncommittal expression, Li Jiangliang sighed softly. Li Jiangxia, however, was more interested in his divine ability. His gaze narrowed as he asked,

"What is your... current state?"

Li Jiangliang lifted his brows.

"My official post is Grand Emissary of the Profound from the Palace of Revering Martial Arts. I am also the Emissary of the True Light Cloud, the Founding Duke of Li Province, and a Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, blessed by the Tianwu divine ability. Though I don't have a specific, tangible ability, I possess the wonders of True Qi, the station of the Purple Mansion Realm, and the ability to traverse the Great Void..."

Li Jiangxia's eyes narrowed further.

"The Merciful One?"

His fourth brother shook his head, his tone grave.

"I should be a cut above that. Somewhere above the Golden Lotus Seat, but below Maha."

This made Li Jiangxia's expression turn solemn.

"That is more than enough... What about your own divine ability? I seem to recall... you cultivate Li Fire, do you not? Is there still a chance for you to attain a divine ability? What are your odds?"

Hearing this, a flicker of hesitation crossed Li Jiangliang's face.

"My immortal foundation is perfected, nourished daily by the wonders of True Qi. It grows more flawless by the day. But I know my own Dao-Profundity is lacking. I estimate... it will be at least a decade before I can attempt to break through to the divine ability level."

Li Jiangxia set down his cup, a trace of suspicion in his mind. He raised an eyebrow.

"You can still form a divine ability!"

Li Jiangliang did not deny it.

"Correct. In fact, this blessing is quite beneficial to my cultivation. Once I achieve my own divine ability, the two will combine, and my power will instantly surpass that of an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator with a single divine ability!"

Li Jiangxia was silent for a long moment before asking,

"How many official posts do you hold now?"

"The Emperor commands water and fire," Li Jiangliang explained.

"Water represents the civil ministers, and fire the military officials. The Palace of Revering Martial Arts, where I serve, is essentially a military institution for defending against external threats. If you really want to get into specifics, I suppose I'm half a military official now, with the additional honorary title of Founding Provincial Duke... You could say I am the head of all officials."

Li Jiangxia let out a heavy breath.

"Why did the Emperor send you here? What does he want?"

Li Jiangliang's face was serious.

"The Emperor wishes to welcome you as a Holder of the Profound but lacks a suitable pretext. He has considered that the various Shaman Kingdoms in the Southern Borderlands have yet to submit. He wishes to dispatch troops to pacify the six bordering states, thereby securing the rear for the Jinghai Military Commissioner."

He flicked his sleeve, extending his arm forward.

"The tiger tally and seal are outside," he said softly. "If you accept them, brother, you can depart as a Holder of the Profound and guard a domain. As long as the Emperor does not recall you, you may act as a Holder of the Profound in his stead, with the same authority as the rest of us!"

In Li Jiangliang's eyes, Yang Zhuo's favoritism toward Li Jiangxia was glaringly obvious. It wasn't just an appreciation for his character and conduct; it involved much more...

'Second Brother was brought back by General Yang and is clearly a trusted confidant, but I have no idea what benefits General Yang promised him... Second Brother is extremely cautious. After seeing the Emperor... he was quickly dispatched to lead troops, and we only met briefly...'

Whether his second brother had sided with Yang Ruiyi, Li Jiangliang couldn't be sure. But the Song Emperor was clearly uninterested in him. Instead, he showed great favor to this third brother, who had arrived in the imperial capital later and had a much bolder personality. Li Jiangliang wouldn't dare say there was a conflict between the Song Emperor and the Yang family, but at the very least... the Emperor did not want the Yangs to have too much influence.

For that reason, Li Jiangliang had long been certain that his third brother, Li Jiangxia, would become a Holder of the Profound before his second brother. Still, when he received the order this morning, he had been utterly shocked.

'This is far too rushed...'

His expression was complicated. Faced with the temptation his fourth brother presented, Li Jiangxia showed little excitement. Instead, he stared intently into those golden eyes and said softly,

"Liang'er, you're finally acting like one of our Li family."

The words caught Li Jiangliang off guard, but he recovered instantly with a slight smile.

"I thought you might say I was acting like Guest Retainer Cui."

Li Jiangxia laughed and rose to his feet, walking over to the window. He shook his head.

"Among us five brothers, only Jiangnian is unremarkable, a mere mortal. The one least like us is Li Jiangqian—you probably don't know this, do you? Our eldest brother is vicious. He is the most unscrupulous of all. When he gets ruthless, there is nothing he won't sacrifice."

He took a step forward, emphasizing his next words. "Absolutely nothing."

A thoughtful look appeared on Li Jiangliang's face. Li Jiangxia continued with a smile,

"Li Jianglong, your second brother, refuses to submit to him in his heart, but he knows he's just like our eldest brother. He cherishes his life and is selfish, but he lacks that final, cruel edge. That's why I don't like him."

"But you and I are more alike. At least... I've read the records. After the army passed, devastation was left in its wake, and only you and I would give any thought to the mortals. The messages you sent home, Eldest Brother sneered at them, but I believed you. You said you joined the Song to fulfill your ambitions, and I believe that too."

"I also know that you feel guilty."

Li Jiangliang froze as if struck by lightning, staring blankly at his brother, who simply smiled.

"But there is no need."

"With the rise of Tianwu, it's less that I was forced to come to Simin and more that I came with ambitions of my own. In this, we are both like our father."

He pushed open the doors of the hall. His gaze fell upon the golden tiger tally and the violet-blue seal resting on a jade platter, held by an attendant of the Profound. His voice was calm.

"Neither of us can just wait for our doom under his wings—no one's ambition is greater, more arrogant, or demands more sacrifice than his."

---

As the sun began to set, the white funeral banners before the hall fluttered, casting fragmented slivers of gold into the shadows. Li Suining had been waiting in the corridor for some time when he saw Li Zhoufang hurry out of the hall.

Li Qiuyang had been an important figure, but for most of the Li family, his life or death was of little consequence. No one truly cared. The funeral had taken on an oddly festive atmosphere. Even for a direct descendant like Li Zhoufang, there was little grief on his face as he emerged from paying his respects, only a hint of concern for Li Xuanxuan's health.

Following behind the middle-aged man was a youth who was looking around distractedly. The top of his robes was carelessly tucked into his sash, a sliver of the white inner lining showing, giving him a listless appearance.

It was Li Suiqing.

Li Suining sighed inwardly.

Li Zhoufang had been overjoyed when his son, Li Jiangzong, became the head of the clan. It wasn't about status among his peers; it was simple pride that his child was capable and could serve the family. But now, after several years in seclusion, Li Suining could see that Li Zhoufang had aged considerably. All that remained was a profound exhaustion.

He brightened slightly upon seeing Li Suining, but his grandson, clearly bored out of his mind, looked ready to bolt. Li Zhoufang shot him a glare, but the boy wasn't afraid. He stared right back, about to speak. Li Zhoufang gritted his teeth, a bitter feeling rising in his heart.

'My boy... your cousin here is exceptionally talented. You, a good-for-nothing, will have to rely on him in the future... If you don't build a better relationship now, what will you stand on later in life!'

But afraid of making a scene, he could only wave his hand in dismissal and tell him to get lost. Turning back to Li Suining's smiling face, he sighed.

"I've made a fool of myself."

Li Suining shook his head. The elder immediately took his hand and began walking, his voice laced with worry.

"Over the years, Suiqing's incompetence and foul nature have only worsened. Your Uncle Jiangzong only has this one son. I've tried to discipline him, again and again, but the more I try, the more I realize he's a lost cause..."

Just as Li Suining was about to speak, Li Zhoufang waved his hand.

"Don't you try to comfort me with stories about Zhouming. It's not the same. Zhouming might have been a bit of a troublemaker in his youth, but he always had a smile for us. His heart wasn't bad."

"But Suiqing... I don't know where he gets this stubborn streak. His mind is twisted, and the more you scold him, the more vicious he becomes. Even when we drag him to the Court of Justice, unless you beat him to death on the spot, he'll still have that fierce, malevolent look in his eyes."

He stared at Li Suining, his eyes glistening.

"The old master and I still think he can be saved, but your Uncle Jiangzong scolds him every time he sees him. He's told me in private more than once that he truly has the urge to kill him with a single palm strike."

Li Suining knew his younger cousin was a disappointment who had brought much gossip upon their family, but he didn't think killing him was the solution. He bowed slightly.

"Just keep him under restraint and don't let Uncle see him..."

Li Zhoufang shook his head bitterly.

"My talent is abysmal. I can't even touch the possibility of Foundation Establishment. A couple of years ago, I tried to advance by hastily taking some pills, but all it did was rattle my sea of qi and greatly damage my vitality. I can't avenge my blood feuds myself. Only King Wei remembered me and killed Nu Xiao for me. But I still harbor this hatred, feeling it's not enough, still hoping for a greater revenge. But seeing Suiqing in this state, I feel so ashamed, and my hatred feels even more helpless."

He vented his emotions in a rush of words, then shook his head, looking somewhat dazed, and forced a smile.

"You are about to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm... I have already reported it to the Daoist Master. He specifically asked for you to visit Gardenia Scenery Mountain. He must be preparing pills for you."

Li Suining felt a pang of sympathy for him, but he couldn't find any comforting words. He could only nod silently before riding the wind toward Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

From a distance, he could see the mountain covered in white flowers. He was in no mood to admire the scenery, his mind filled with troubled thoughts. He landed at a pavilion at the foot of the mountain and found someone was already there.

The man was dressed in a feather cloak of azure and gold and wore a dark green ceremonial cap. His attire was exquisitely crafted and magnificent, lending an air of authority that compensated for his otherwise average looks. His face was like white jade, his aura full and vibrant as he stood with his hands behind his back.

Li Suining was startled for a moment, but when he saw the man's golden eyes, he realized who it was and quickly spoke.

"Second Uncle!"

It was Li Jianglong, returned from the Song court.

With just a brief glance, Li Suining could tell that his cultivation was exceptionally complete, his presence formidable, and faintly connected to the Martial Cultivation Star in the heavens. He knew at once that his uncle had entered the Purple and Gold Palace. Though he was not yet a Holder of the Profound, a divine ability was within his reach. It was undoubtedly a joyous occasion. He immediately offered his congratulations.

"Congratulations, Second Uncle!"

A subtle shift occurred in Li Jianglong's expression, as if he were trying to discern the true meaning behind the words. He gave a slight nod.

"Thank you for your thoughts, Suining."

Li Suining smiled at him, but the smile slowly faded as a strange feeling crept over him. To be rewarded for military merit and given an important position should be a time of great triumph, yet his second uncle seemed far from pleased. In fact, he looked somber, almost melancholic.

Li Suining's arrival did little to distract him. His hand rested on his wrist, fingers tapping lightly, betraying an inner turmoil.

Just then, a garden attendant arrived at the pavilion, bowed, and invited them inside.

Li Ximing was not one for extravagance. The mountain retreat exuded the serene atmosphere of the Immortal Dao. The Daoist Master sat quietly, a tall alchemy furnace placed beside him. Lively red and white flames danced at its base, occasionally pulsing with a terrifying power.

To his surprise, another Daoist Master was seated at the table. Dressed in dark green robes, he had a smile on his face but seemed slightly reserved. The moment the two arrived, his eyes fixed on Li Jianglong.

It was Guo Nanwu.

Li Jianglong didn't recognize him, but Li Suining instantly grew wary.

'It's Daoist Master Nanwu. Did he join the lake this early...?'

Among all the Daoist Masters, Daoist Master Yuanbian was the closest to the Li family, but he guarded the Eastern Sea and never entered the mainland. Of those who did visit the lake, Daoist Master Nanwu and another, Daoist Master Kuang Yu, came most often.

But the power of a Daoist Master was immense. He didn't dare let his thoughts wander and quickly lowered his head.

Guo Nanwu had been handling a matter for the Li family. He had just returned from Poluoduo, where he had been sent to deal with the Radiant Crimson Fiendfire that Li Ximing had obtained from Minghui. The Radiant Crimson Fiendfire was a fine item, but it had been meddled with by Buddhist cultivators for a century, making it troublesome to handle. Li Ximing had consulted the fire sparrow, Huo Yang, but she had shown little interest.

It was understandable. Li Ximing was after other spiritual flames, and besides the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame, Huo Yang surely had others that were no worse than the Radiant Crimson Fiendfire. From her perspective, why would she go through the trouble of trading a perfectly good spiritual flame for one that had been tainted by Buddhists for a hundred years? Even Li Ximing would have difficulty purifying it, let alone anyone else.

The trip had been fruitless. He had only managed to acquire some spiritual materials from Huo Yang to refine pills for her. With Tu Longjian yet to return, Li Ximing had no choice but to accept the outcome.

'Finding a fool to take this off my hands is proving difficult. In the end, I'll have to deal with it myself. Once it's cleansed, I can use it or wait for a buyer... At least it will have a purpose, instead of being stuck in my hands like it is now.'

So he had tasked Guo Nanwu with traveling to the Eastern Sea to trade for some spiritual resources. Guo Nanwu had agreed but had lingered, asking about Li Jianglong's whereabouts.

The Song court still held many secrets from the Purple Mansion cultivators, and the Daoist Masters of the Southern Sea remained restless. It was clear that this Daoist Master had come specifically to see Li Jianglong. Since Li Ximing also needed to see him, he had casually invited him up.

"This is Li Jianglong," he said with a smile.

As he made the introduction, he examined Li Jianglong closely. He sensed that within the man's Bright Yang Qi, layers upon layers of the wonders of True Qi were faintly visible, constantly nurturing his cultivation. He placed two fingers together, and World's Radiance responded, a flicker of invisible light dancing at his fingertips.

Activating his Life Divine Ability, he finally perceived the abnormality in Li Jianglong.

'His fate is irregular.'

After achieving his Life Divine Ability, Li Ximing had secretly observed Li Zhouwei and found his divine ability to be overwhelmingly powerful, like a blazing sun in the mortal world. But Li Jianglong was different. A faint purple light clung to him, as if connected to some profound and mysterious treasury.

Li Ximing retracted his divine ability and asked,

"Nanwu, what do you see?"

Guo Nanwu nodded slightly. He cultivated the 'Heretical Seeking' path of the Lesser Yang Dao, giving him wondrous abilities in observation and travel, as well as the great divine art of transforming Lesser Yang into Yin. His insight was exceptionally sharp. With a single glance, a sense of crisis welled up in his heart. A sudden premonition struck him, and he transmitted his thoughts via his divine ability.

"If I were to kill him, a calamity would surely befall me!"

"How formidable... No wonder they aren't worried about the Buddhists making a move. Forget converting him... even harboring killing intent is extremely unwise."

Li Ximing's eyes narrowed slightly. He had already gleaned a great deal.

Guo Nanwu also felt the pressure of the Martial Cultivation Star, but this made him feel truly strange... for one simple reason: he felt absolutely no threat from the star itself.

Li Ximing watched for a long time without speaking. After his observation, Guo Nanwu seemed to have his answers. He stood up and took his leave.

Li Ximing's expression remained neutral as he bid him farewell with a smile, showing no sign of anything unusual. Li Jianglong, meanwhile, bowed deeply. 

"Congratulations on emerging from seclusion, Daoist Master, and for achieving your great divine ability!"

Li Ximing's smile widened. "I should be congratulating you! Tell me, how much wondrous power have you gained?"

Li Jianglong's expression was composed as he replied respectfully,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, this junior has only just entered the court. The Emperor has appointed me as an administrator in the Palace of Revering Martial Arts, a minor cultivator in the Purple and Gold Palace, and the Prefect of Jiangjuan Prefecture, to lead the Great Song's forces in defense, support Ting Province, and await the orders of my father and the Great General!"

The so-called Jiangjuan Prefecture was located in what was now the Wilderness, which meant it was close enough to be considered a support for Moongaze Lake. Li Ximing quickly understood the South's intentions.

"As for wondrous abilities," Li Jianglong continued, "I cannot compare to my fourth brother. I have merely gained control over a few methods of True Qi and some enhancement to my cultivation. I must achieve further merit to advance."

Li Ximing asked with great interest, "And how is Jiangliang?"

Li Jianglong lowered his voice.

"Fourth Brother is now the head of all officials, a Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, and wields the Tianwu divine ability! He is already in the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Li Ximing held his breath, his heart a storm of complex emotions. He sighed inwardly.

'The pursuit of the Dao... is nothing but the cultivation of one's life-mandate. But if this life-mandate is not cultivated by oneself, but is bestowed by another, how is it any different from the Merciful One or Maha!'

'And yet... it is achieved so easily! The entire world will surely flock to it in a frenzy.'

His expression was complicated. Li Jianglong, on the other hand, looked somewhat apprehensive.

"As for these wondrous abilities... I'm afraid I cannot demonstrate them for you, Daoist Master..."

Li Ximing frowned.

"Why not?"

Li Jianglong gave a helpless smile and shook his head.

"Father is blessed by the Mandate of Heaven and has been enfeoffed by the Emperor. Within the state, he is sovereign. The Martial Cultivation Star does not interfere. Even the highest-ranking immortal official of the court would be stripped of his power upon entering our state of Wei... Not only would he lose the status of Holder of the Profound, but even the divine abilities that aid cultivation would be gone!"

"Oh?"

A theory Li Ximing had been pondering was suddenly confirmed. Understanding slowly dawned on him, though a shred of doubt remained.

'So it's true? Does it really work like that? Even the North can be bathed in the light of the Martial Cultivation Star, yet this enfeoffment has such a strange effect... Does it only apply to lands granted through feudal partition?'

Though puzzled, his face remained calm. He put on a look of sudden realization and smiled.

"I see... It seems none of you brothers are suited to stay on the lake."

Li Jianglong lowered his head slightly.

"The Daoist Master's insight is sharp. The Great General's recommendation for me to be the Prefect of Jiangjuan Prefecture was made with precisely this in mind. I can both receive the light of the Martial Cultivation Star and watch over the lake. It's the best of both worlds..."

Li Ximing listened for a while, then turned his attention to the alchemy furnace as if to adjust the heat, leaving Li Jianglong kneeling. After a long period of contemplation, his mind was made up.

'I must use the Immortal Artifact to see the truth!'

With a thought, he shifted his gaze slightly. His spiritual sense converged, and he reached out to the Immortal Artifact.

The world before him opened up. The purple light around Li Jianglong grew thin, and he could see strands of purple silk erupting from his Shengyang Acupoint, scattering into the air like snapped strings.

'It seems that here, the power of the Martial Cultivation Star is like rootless water... unable to connect to the star in the heavens... It is just as he said, because this is the land of a vassal...'

He felt no joy, only a sudden chill.

'If so... do the rules of the Martial Cultivation Star even apply on the lake?'

If the rule that punished those who harbored killing intent was also nullified here, it meant the North could slaughter the people of Moongaze Lake with impunity...

His heart grew heavy, but he didn't press the matter. As he slowly averted his gaze, a flash of silver light suddenly slammed into his vision.

Kneeling to the side, as if he were part of the scenery, Li Suining's body was glowing with an intense silver light, a hundred times thicker than the faint martial cultivation light on Li Jianglong. It was so brilliant it was almost blinding.

In that instant, Li Ximing felt as if he had discovered a demon hiding beside his own bed. The hair on his body stood on end, and a thousand terrifying possibilities flooded his mind. A profound sense of crisis washed over him, and he almost leaped to his feet.

'What?!'

**Main Characters in this Chapter:**

Li Ximing [Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm]

Li Jianglong [Audience with the Celestial Gate] [Peak Foundation Establishment Realm] [Purple and Gold Palace]

Li Suining [Ninth Level of Qi Refining]




# Chapter 1058: One After Another

The glaring silver light was blinding, and Li Ximing's heart turned ice-cold.

In his eyes, although the Li family had many capable individuals, the matter of succession was troubling. Li Zhouwei was consumed by his pursuit of the Dao, and the scions of the Bright Yang line all had their own plans. If the situation collapsed, Li Ximing knew full well he couldn't rely on them. The fate of the Bright Yang bloodline would be precarious at best.

Li Que'wan and Li Jiangqian both had the potential for the Purple Mansion Realm. He viewed Li Que'wan, in particular, as the Li family's escape route to the Eastern Sea should the Bright Yang Dao fail. Li Jiangchun was a "Purple Mansion seed" and also possessed the Yang family bloodline, making him a perfect successor to follow—another hidden card.

But when considering the younger generations after them, Li Ximing was struck by a strong sense of foreboding.

It was simple: if the Bright Yang scions couldn't be preserved, the following generations would be mediocre. Li Jiangchun's sword heart was renowned, and the family was counting on him to break through to Sword Intent. They had no intention of letting him be distracted, meaning it was ninety-nine percent certain he would have no heirs. Also at the Foundation Establishment Realm, it was better to count on Li Zhouluo than him. Li Que'wan was singularly focused on the Dao and already preparing for the Purple Mansion Realm, making her even more unlikely to have heirs. The second and fourth branches had no outstanding descendants, the third branch had already split off, leaving only the first branch to prosper.

Li Zhouming had been the best choice. But Li Ximing had privately discussed it with Li Xuanxuan; Li Zhouming, after all, cultivated Bright Yang... The old man mulled it over. A Bright Yang cultivator should not be put in charge again.

Li Suining's arrival was timely. He was from the generation just below, highly talented, and showed great promise in the Formation Dao. Most importantly, he had a stable, intelligent, and calm personality. Li Ximing had liked him from their first meeting and hoped to see his bloodline continue... all for the sake of future considerations.

But with Li Jianglong's example right there, and now this flash of silver light before his eyes, Li Ximing subconsciously felt this was the work of some mighty expert. The candidate being groomed to shoulder the family's burdens might just be a mole for another power. How could Li Ximing not be horrified!

In that instant, he forced his gaze to remain on the furnace. His face remained calm, but his heart had turned to a pool of ice. He activated the scouting ability of the Immortal Artifact, locking it firmly onto Li Suining.

He saw the silver light on the young man's body fluctuating erratically, like breathing. Li Ximing focused his vision and saw the silver light gradually fade, revealing a somewhat familiar aura.

'It seems to be... the aura of the Fox Clan's 'Heaven–Governing' Dao... And it also resembles the wondrous fluctuations from when Wanling Heaven first opened.'

Although Li Suining also cultivated 'Heaven–Governing', his mere Qi Refining cultivation couldn't possibly shine so dazzlingly under the Immortal Artifact's scrutiny. Li Ximing made his judgment quickly, growing suspicious. He mused:

'Could this be an arrangement by the Fox Clan...'

This slightly lessened the chill in his heart.

After all, his family had a considerable relationship with the Fox Clan. Back when the Great Daoist Master from Luoxia had come to the lake, a Fox Clan Demon King had even appeared to confront him... In a sense, they still had common interests.

'But while this silver light seems noble, it doesn't look like it has any substantial power. Instead, it seems more like the Immortal Mirror detected some special characteristic... Besides, if this really were a reincarnation, it wouldn't have just happened today or yesterday...'

He closed his eyes slightly, pondering for a long time before reaching a preliminary conclusion,

'Back then, the Yang family most likely didn't understand the situation at the lake. The Martial Cultivation Star, someone as lofty as a True Monarch, also met their end at the lake. Whatever the reason, the lake holds many secrets... Rather than a mole, could it be... reincarnation? Or some kind of fortunate encounter?'

Li Suining hadn't left many flaws in his story. In fact, his behavior couldn't even be called flawed. But viewed from a different perspective, once a trace of suspicion had formed, many things looked completely different:

'It all makes sense now. It must be because he's the reincarnation of a powerful cultivator that he's so calm and composed at such a young age. And it explains how he inexplicably obtained such high Dao-Profundity in formations... that's not something "talent" alone can cover.'

'But his concern for the clan doesn't seem fake... Could it be that he hasn't fully awakened his past-life memories?'

Li Ximing sank into deep thought. Although he didn't think Li Suining himself possessed any great strength, he had secretly raised his vigilance to the maximum. Not wanting to startle his potential "prey," he simply waved his hand and instructed:

"Go back to Jiangjuan for now. We wouldn't want anyone accusing you of abandoning your post."

Li Jianglong said no more, immediately bowing and taking his leave. Only Li Suining remained standing on the mountain. Li Ximing didn't speak for a moment. Just then, Li Minggong came up the path and handed him two letters.

"Daoist Master... A letter from the Wave-Suppressing Mansion."

Li Ximing had to temporarily suppress his feelings and take out the letter. He read it. Liu Changdie had written a hundred grand-sounding words explaining the situation, his tone filled with pleading. Li Ximing's expression tightened.

'Something's happened to Qingyan, and Fuxun is gravely injured...'

A dark premonition surfaced in his mind. He set that letter down and picked up the one from Li Que'wan. Reading it from beginning to end, he noticed she had addressed him as "Lord."

'Trouble on the island...'

Li Ximing's sense of foreboding intensified. Li Que'wan always addressed him as Daoist Master. Before she left, he had made an agreement with her: if something strange happened on the island that they didn't dare write about openly, they were to change "Daoist Master" to "Lord." He certainly didn't believe Li Que'wan had made a simple mistake.

'Good, she only changed it in one place, and the tone isn't urgent. It should be able to wait a little while.'

But his worry suddenly escalated, and a chill seeped into his heart. Li Ximing cursed inwardly,

'Everything is happening at once!'

If Li Suining represented the future pillar who would manage the family's affairs, then Li Que'wan was, without a doubt, a critical combat asset who absolutely could not be lost. This was a trip Li Ximing had to make.

Although Daoist Master Yan had agreed back then to help him after achieving 'World's Radiance', and he also had to make a trip to the Nine Mounds for Li Jiangchun... those things paled in comparison to this forced trip to the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. Li Ximing's mood soured instantly. He casually set the letters down, his expression remaining outwardly calm. Composing himself, he spoke with deliberation.

Li Suining had been waiting all this time. He finally heard the Daoist Master ask with a smile,

"Here to get your pills for a breakthrough?"

Li Suining was deferential, keeping his gaze lowered. He hadn't noticed anything unusual about the man. He nodded politely and replied,

"This junior's aura has reached completion, and I am preparing to break through... It's just that spiritual resources and Demon beasts for the 'Heaven–Governing' Dao are rare, and Essence Gathering Pills for this path are even rarer. The Old Master sent this junior to see you, Lord."

Li Ximing nodded slowly.

"The 'Heaven–Governing' Dao doesn't have many prohibitions... However... if you can find a quality pill, it not only provides a better guarantee but can also save you a year or two of delay..."

He smiled.

"I don't have those things on hand. But I happen to be going to the Eastern Sea soon. I'll ask for some from Daoist Master Yuanbian for you."

Li Suining seemed reluctant to have him go to such trouble. He bowed his thanks with some hesitation, wanting to say more but holding back. His heart felt bitter.

'If I'd known, I never would have brought this up! Although there hasn't been a war for a year or two... what if something happens to him out there...'

Li Ximing, however, was observing his expression. He gestured for him to come and sit, casually brewed a cup of tea, and smiled.

"Your... cultivation in the Formation Dao... how is it coming along?"

Li Suining merely bowed, found an appropriate level of detail, and began to speak concisely. Li Ximing listened in silence, secretly committing it all to memory, preparing to discuss it in detail with Liu Changdie later.

But watching the young man speak with such confidence and eloquence, Li Ximing's suspicion grew:

'But since he hasn't formed a divine ability and doesn't have a Talisman Seed... how could he possibly resist my Life Divine Ability? If I used my Life Divine Ability to control him, wouldn't he fall right into my hands?'

Moreover, he still had doubts, and he had to rush to the Eastern Sea. Naturally, he had to leave some safeguards in place before he left. He smiled and said,

"I am going to the Eastern Sea to fetch spiritual resources for you... but my pill furnace is still on the mountain. How about you read your Formation Dao Classics while keeping an eye on it for me?"

Li Suining had no intention of refusing. He nodded quickly, accepting the task with great seriousness. Li Ximing reached into his sleeve, using his divine ability to coalesce a magical fan. He placed it in the young man's hand and said solemnly,

"This means you'll have to act as my medicine boy. Just use your dharma power to wave this fan and watch the furnace fire for me until I return."

"Yes!"

Li Suining treated this as an extremely important mission and nodded gravely. The moment that "Yes" left his lips, a hidden radiance flashed in Li Ximing's eyes. His hand, concealed in his sleeve, performed a quick incantation seal, and the Light of the Six Harmonies leaped forth.

It was the 'World's Radiance'!

The call and response seemed like a mere formality, but this subordinate relationship was captured by the 'World's Radiance'. It triggered a mystical response, placing Li Suining under the watch of the Life Divine Ability!

If Li Suining felt even a trace of resentment or disloyalty, Li Ximing would sense it! The golden fan in his hand would immediately respond and blast him to smithereens.

The colorless Light of the Six Harmonies pulsed faintly at his fingertip. Li Ximing's heart relaxed slightly,

'The feedback from 'World's Radiance'... he genuinely respects me. It seems his feelings for the family are also real, without a hint of falsehood... It looks like... this child really did just receive some kind of fortunate encounter...'

If it was indeed the latter, and Li Suining had obtained some opportunity related to the Heaven–Governing Dao, Li Ximing was relieved, but he also had to consider if there was a problem with the opportunity itself. In any case, with the 'World's Radiance' in effect, Li Ximing could set his mind at ease for now.

'He seems like a good kid... I can't wrong him. This is the best way to handle it for now. When I return, I'll send him into seclusion and wait for Zhouwei to emerge. We can discuss it in detail then.'

With that, he strode off the mountain. He ordered Li Minggong to lock down the great formation of Gardenia Scenery Mountain, forbidding anyone from entering, and instructed,

"Go and invite Daoist Master Nanwu here. Ask him to hold the fort on the mountain for me... Something has come up in the Eastern Sea. I'll be back as soon as I can."

Only then did he hastily ride the winds, stepping into the Great Void.

---

The night was grim and dark.

The sky above Chengyun Gate was thick with dark clouds, devoid of any illusory color. A young man stood on a high platform, his face slightly pale as he gazed at the night sky. His long robes, patterned with white feathers and black mystic sigils, fluttered slightly in the air, adding to the oppressive atmosphere.

This was none other than the master of Chengyun Gate, Daoist Master Changyun.

He stood silently on the high platform. The surging gale only managed to stir a few strands of his hair, and his eyes held an extremely profound gaze.

Beside him, a young man in black robes also stood in the wind. He was a full head taller than Daoist Master Changyun. His long spear was planted on the ground, and his body pulsed with divine ability, giving him an imposing and powerful aura.

After an unknown amount of time, the spear-wielding young man lowered his gaze and advised,

"Lord, that person instructed that when cultivating this kind of secret art, it is best not to be seen..."

Changyun calmly shook his head. "Zhonggong... there will be no more chances after this."

This spear-wielding Daoist Master was, astonishingly, the Sect Master of Chengyun Gate, Zhong Qian!

He had not been in the Purple Mansion Realm for long, but his divine ability and aura were overwhelming. His features were sharp. When he had met Li Xuanfeng back then, his face still held a trace of childishness, but that was now completely gone, replaced by the dignity and calm belonging to the Purple Mansion Realm.

Changyun turned his head and said flatly,

"A great war is about to erupt in the south. They will certainly come to dispatch me. They're playing dumb, wanting us to suffer in silence, unable to voice our grievances."

His words were scathing, but his expression showed no sign of dejection. It was as if his own secret being exposed was no big deal.

After a while, a golden-white light soared over from the distance. A high-spirited Daoist landed, though he was riding a propitious cloud, which looked somewhat out of place.

"Brother Changyun!"

The monk shouted, landing on the platform. He wasn't surprised to find that Changyun already knew he was coming. He bowed, his expression a bit awkward, and said,

"I've received orders to invite you to head south and guard the riverbank."

Zhong Qian's expression flickered at these words, but Changyun smiled and invited the monk inside. He studied the monk's face, shook his head, and said:

"Daoist Friend Minghui... these past few years haven't been easy for you, have they!"

Minghui's awkward expression gradually faded. He let out a deep sigh and replied,

"Daoist Master, your eyes are as sharp as a torch. I've been living on this riverbank as if walking on thin ice. This business of ordering you south is an offensive task, so naturally, it fell into my hands..."

After the great war of the nation's founding, the Li family got a chance to rest and recuperate. But Minghui had truly suffered these past few years. He'd been transferred to Shanji, and every year, he was the one sent on probing missions! He had tasted the power of Tinglan's Immeasurable Water and Fire more than once!

Minghui complained for a while, then secretly glanced at Zhong Qian. Just one look, and he felt a surging brilliance from the man's body. He was stunned.

'Such a powerful destiny! If this man were to join the Buddhists, he would definitely achieve great things!'

While he was still secretly observing, Changyun was already sneering inwardly,

'Qi Lanyan... oh, Qi Lanyan. I've been in seclusion for so long, yet you just had to be the one to call me out! Fine, fine. A minor cultivator from the Qi family, with the support of Profound Governance, thinks he can call the wind and summon the rain. He's utterly, unbelievably stupid!'

'Are there so few great figures in the world who know about this? No! But every last one of them has learned to be clever and play dumb. Only this idiot lets himself be pushed to the forefront, thinking he's learned some secret and dares to scheme against my Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition...'

Just as Qi Lanyan had predicted years ago, the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition was certainly furious. But Changyun—or rather, Zhang Yun of the Golden Feather Sect—saw Qi Lanyan's boldness as mere ignorance:

'It is usually _my_ Dao that schemes against others and controls the world. Now it's his turn to scheme against me!'

His thoughts were dark. The monk, Minghui, could no longer hold back. His eyes filled with envy as he looked at Changyun and said,

"Daoist Master, you've already achieved three divine abilities! Such speed! Even those scions of immortals at the Golden Core level are no better than this!"

No matter how much flattery or politeness his words contained, they struck Changyun as sensitive. After all, he, Changyun, _was_ a hidden agent of the Golden Feather Sect. The words sounded like mockery. His eyes, which already seemed somewhat gloomy, swept over the monk:

'Does this monk know or not? His words are so sharp... Could it be that the Lotus Temple also knows? Given Jinlian's status... by common logic, he shouldn't have access to this information...'

Outwardly, he just said flatly, "Pure luck."

Minghui shook his head and sighed. "I heard the Yang family's Purple and Gold Palace has opened. Something is bound to happen on the river sooner or later. I came this time not only to do this offensive task, but also to ask you a question or two."

"Oh?"

Changyun raised an eyebrow. He listened to the monk's troubled agonizing. After a long pause, and seeing that the grand formation was sealed, Minghui finally whispered furtively,

"You and I have been friends for many years... Do you... do you know any good ways to get oneself killed? Could you... teach me...?"

At these words, Zhong Qian, who had been standing by looking serious and worried, couldn't help but twitch his lips. Changyun stared at the monk, dumbfounded, and replied in a strange tone,

"How bizarre. In this vast world, paths to survival are few. You're telling me paths to death are also hard to find?"




# Chapter 1059: Lesser Yang

Minghui heard this, shook his head, and sighed bitterly.

"Daoist Master, you don't understand. This 'dead end' isn't truly death... Sometimes, the dead end is the only path to life. If I don't die now, I will truly perish later!"

Daoist Master Changyun was already a calculating man. Just from that one sentence, he had a good grasp of the situation. He lowered his gaze in thought, uncertain.

"If that is your concern... it's not as if there are no Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the Song State at Shanji. I hear you are dispatched on missions daily. How hard could it be to find an opportunity to seek death!"

Minghui shook his head.

"Daoist Master, you don't know. At Profound Peak, they now have Gongsun Bei and Qi Lanyan. Although they haven't acted, they are watching my duels with Tinglan. The most I can manage is to get injured. How could I find a chance to die?"

"But if you fail to die and only accumulate injuries, when the real calamity arrives, won't your chances of survival be even slimmer?"

Daoist Master Changyun nodded slightly. If there were some easy way out, how could _he_ know more than Minghui, a high-level Buddhist cultivator? The other man clearly had a favor to ask.

"What does Maha require of me? Please, speak."

Minghui nodded as expected and lowered his voice.

"I came south all those years ago at the request of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. Now that I am trapped, I must naturally turn to them to resolve this calamity. But I waited and waited, and the one the Great Adoration Dharma Realm sent... was... Vast Cicada..."

At the mention of Vast Cicada, Minghui's expression turned grim. Changyun, however, looked thoughtful.

"The one descended from the Undefeated King of Brightness... who now presides over the Precious Tusk Golden Land? A Bright Yang descendant?"

Minghui stared at him, slightly stunned, as if surprised. He suddenly remembered the man before him had been to the Profound Governance Pavilion and had likely interacted with many Buddhist cultivators. He nodded.

"That's him... The Great Adoration Dharma Realm acquired the Precious Tusk Golden Land, expanding the Buddhist Land, and he became a favored figure under the 'Great One'... But it's precisely because he is so entrenched in the Precious Tusk Golden Land that he feels little kinship with the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and doesn't accept their doctrines... I simply cannot reason with him!"

A look of profound frustration crossed his face. Changyun, however, shook his head and said quietly,

"I see it as more than that... You are intent on self-preservation, and your esteemed Lotus Temple wishes to avoid involvement in the fall of the Bright Yang. He came south specifically for the White Qilin. How could you two possibly find common ground? He probably wishes you dead at the hands of the south, just to drag your temple into the fray."

Seeing that Changyun understood everything clearly, Minghui stopped beating around the bush. He adopted a fawning tone.

"Daoist Master has sharp eyes... I am in the most difficult position right now... Seeing you come south, I finally feel a ray of hope. I was hoping that once you are under Qi Lanyan's command, you might... if not request my transfer... at least lend a hand when the fighting with the south begins."

As he spoke, his emotions swelled, and his voice filled with dread.

"I only have you to rely on, Daoist Master!"

Daoist Master Changyun remained noncommittal, giving him a deep look.

'The great tide is just beginning; the time is not yet ripe. Jiangbei looks impregnable, and the south is defensive, unable to attack. But mortal strength has its limits. How can it contend with the Great One's methods? When the True Qi continuously rises and the Bright Yang's foundation shakes ever more violently, Jiangbei will be impossible to hold. The Great One made arrangements long ago. My opportunity will surely come...'

'But before that, I'll inevitably have to bow my head to the Profound Governance Pavilion... If I'm alone, who knows how Qi Lanyan might scheme to frame me. The Lotus Temple has no ambition to stir up the world; their only desire is to retreat to the north. They make a convenient ally...'

He pondered for a moment, then rose.

"You and I have been friends for many years... It's not that I cannot help you with this. But I have my own plans. I will save your life on this venture, but in the future, I will need you to yield to me in turn."

Their words were overflowing with intimacy—"many years of friendship," "deep bond"—but they both knew each other's nature. They knew there was little pure friendship between divine ability Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, especially those from different factions. At its root, it was all an exchange of benefits.

Precisely because they understood this, Changyun was direct. Minghui, in turn, became extremely solemn. He raised his hand.

"If Daoist Master saves my life, I will be bound by this karma. How could I watch you die and not intervene! Today, I swear to the Great Compassionate, Joyful Lotus-World Aspect that I will repay you generously in the future!"

"Generously repay..."

Daoist Master Changyun's expression was a little strange. He shook his head.

"Your 'generous repayment' as Buddhist cultivators... I don't really dare to trust it. Back when the master of the Way of Emptiness failed in his pursuit of the Dao, every power took advantage of the chaos. The Buddhist Land collapsed. Zhelu fled from the Long Dao... he received the grace of the Auspicious Tablet Gate. But when _he_ became the master of the Way of Emptiness, he hurried back and forcibly 'converted' their entire sect... A 'generous repayment' indeed..."

After all, Buddhist cultivators had a poor reputation, and such incidents were common. Minghui was extremely embarrassed and started cursing Zhelu, but Changyun paid it no mind.

'When the Great One's plan closes its net and I reveal my identity, I won't have to worry about you failing to deliver!'

But Minghui was thinking just as hard.

'Master told me to find Changyun, so this fellow must have something good that can protect me... If I'm tossed around and truly have no way out, Master will also act. I must find a way to make those two bastards suffer...'

The two reached an agreement, each harboring their own agenda. Minghui whispered,

"I've thought this through. Once the north and south clash, the critical point will rest on two people. First... Yang Ruiyi. Second, Li Zhouwei."

The monk usually looked flighty, but his eyes were now crystal clear.

"And I... will likely be sent to fight Yang Ruiyi. It's even more likely they'll place me alone on Yang Ruiyi's path! And you, Daoist Master... I fear your assignment will also be related to Yang Ruiyi."

His expression darkened.

"After all, from the current look of things, Qi Lanyan has set his sights on Li Zhouwei. The ones sent to fight him will surely be people like Gongsun Bei and Vast Cicada, who want him dead at all costs. If he sent you, he would definitely worry you wouldn't try your best... Conversely, against Yang Ruiyi, you, Daoist Master, will have to protect yourself."

Daoist Master Changyun nodded. Minghui continued,

"Yang Ruiyi commands the Exiled Qi. It's highly likely he can blockade all traces, slip into the north undetected, and kill me easily. My master will use his great dharma power to observe the Great Void. Although he certainly won't be able to see the Exiled Qi's movements, he _can_ see _me_. The instant he loses my trail, he will immediately send you word!"

"I am confident I can protect myself for a short time. You must come and save me, Daoist Master..."

Daoist Master Changyun nodded slightly, settling the matter. Only then did Minghui retrieve a jade slip from his sleeve and hand it to Changyun, raising an eyebrow.

"This is what Daoist Master Qi instructed me to bring."

Daoist Master Changyun raised his own eyebrows. He unfurled the jade slip, only to find it completely blank under his spiritual sense. There were no words. But after unrolling it, he saw a line of characters written in ink on the bright white surface:

'To be granted land and title, the time is today. Hiding in your sect, how will you repay your superior's grace?'

Daoist Master Changyun sneered inwardly.

'So, you, Qi, are also playing with fire. The "superior" you refer to... that must be _my_ True Monarch! Fine, fine. Have your little joke today. Wei Xuanyin will inevitably achieve the Dao. We'll see who comes to protect _you_ then.'

Minghui kept his head down, staring at the table in silence. He watched the Daoist Master smile.

"How rare, how rare. To think Daoist Master Qi is actually showing consideration for me, worrying that I might betray the trust of Lord Wei!"

Minghui had no desire to get involved in their dispute either. He just murmured in agreement and did not linger. After informing Changyun of the deadline for him and the Chengyun Gate disciples to head south, he stepped into the Great Void and departed.

Daoist Master Changyun watched him disappear, standing on the terrace for a long time, lost in thought.

"Li Zhouwei already has two divine abilities... The Profound Governance Pavilion was too ruthless this time. He won't recover for at least five or six years... Qi Lanyan does have a mind to delay the fall of the Bright Yang..."

Beside him, Zhong Qian's expression turned complicated upon hearing news of the Li family, but he did not reply. Daoist Master Changyun paced the terrace, silent for a long time.

'When I met Li Tongya back then, I only felt his destiny was unusual. I never imagined he was of the orthodox Bright Yang Wei-lineage. Thinking back, it's reasonable. The Great One's schemes truly run deep...'

'Emperor Wei... Emperor Wei...'

There were many in the world who wished for Li Qianyuan's demise. He didn't know what the Great One above was thinking, but from Changyun's perspective, it would be better if this matter ran into some complications.

'Luoxia's power is too vast right now... So vast it's suffocating us. If this affair could just go wrong... I'm not even asking for Li Qianyuan to reclaim his Fruition Attainment. If he could just cling to life for another one or two hundred years, that would be good...'

'Back then, when the Wei State dominated, the Great One was cultivating on Bone-Ridge Mountain. Wei soldiers entered the mountain, and Emperor Wei met the Great One, leaving behind the Heart-Emptying Stone... The relationship between the Wei Kingdom and my Golden Oneness of Highest Azure was originally excellent...'

Later, when Emperor Wei fell into decline, his own Great One sent an incarnation into the mortal realm, stirring up the world and personally engineering the Qi Emperor's downfall. Even if it was for his own benefit, in Zhang Yun's eyes, this had already repaid the favor of old. Otherwise, if the Qi Emperor had truly achieved the Dao and survived to this day, following Luoxia and aiding the tyrant, Li Qianyuan's situation would be incomparably more wretched.

As for the massacre of Emperor Wei's bloodline in Guanzhong, Zhang Yun had heard of it, but he was unconcerned.

'They were going to die eventually. What difference does it make who killed them? They are True Monarchs, after all. Would they truly care about the lives of a few descendants?'

Mulling it over, he secretly stroked his beard.

'I see that Qi Lanyan has some intention of putting Li Zhouwei to death. This won't be easy—the Seven Aspects faction is enormous, with many Dharma Masters. They are still probing. How could a minor cultivator like him manage it... I can just watch from the side. The Seven Aspects' feelings for the Bright Yang scions cannot be suppressed. When the time is right, they can be used...'

His thoughts turned dark.

'True Qi is a great boon to the Whole Pill Dao. Counting across the world, there are few Whole Pill divine ability cultivators left... If the Ancestor can succeed, my Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition will finally have a little breathing room under the Heavenly Glow...'

'I still must wait... The Whole Pill True Monarch of old fell in the Eastern Sea, and the Wondrous Whole Root-Nature subsequently fell into Beijia's hands. The Great One was forced to compromise with the Dragon-kin...'

He stared intently at the desk, his expression calm.

'Things have come to this... no matter which family... no one can afford to lose.'

...

## Wave-Suppressing Mansion

The sea churned, and the sky was dim.

Li Que'wan stood on the shore, fraught with worry, feeling the sea breeze buffet her face. She waited and waited, her heart growing hesitant.

'That Demon King Fuxun has already entered the formation. The grotesque thing on him is clearly bad news. If someone instructed him, I'm afraid Wave-Suppressing Mansion is about to be lost...'

Li Que'wan used the Immortal Mirror and found that the grotesque entity was still scanning everywhere, wandering about the cave-mansion. Within the Immortal Artifact's field of vision, she could even see a hazy golden radiance covering the creature, illuminating the entire island, penetrating deep underground, and occupying every blind spot.

It was precisely because of this illusory radiance that even now, Li Que'wan couldn't be sure if she was within the creature's sight... which also made her afraid to crush the jade talisman.

'With the Talisman Seed, at least this thing can't see what I'm thinking. But if I crush the jade talisman, I won't be able to explain why... It will definitely attract attention...'

This thing was piggybacking on a dignified Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and Fuxun himself was completely unaware. Li Que'wan couldn't be too cautious. If not for the fact that Li Ximing was also protected by the Immortal Artifact, she would be worried that he, too, would meet with disaster if he came!

Li Que'wan stood silently for a long time before she vaguely saw a golden light appear on the horizon. In the blink of an eye, it was before her, revealing a Daoist Master in white-gold robes with a speck of light on his brow. Who else could it be but Li Ximing!

Her first reaction was not joy, but worry. Excitement flooded her face, as if she were merely a girl who hadn't seen her elder in many days. She rode the wind and immediately flew _past_ the formation boundary!

The action was quite natural, but it conveniently cut off any thought Li Ximing might have had of continuing forward.

But Li Ximing had stopped there, not entering the formation precisely because he was being cautious. Why would he move forward? He smiled brightly at her, his gaze not falling on the island, but his spiritual sense was already linked with the Immortal Artifact.

In an instant, the entire scene on the island appeared before him. Li Ximing's heart suddenly clenched in alarm.

He immediately noticed Fuxun, who was in seclusion within the cave-mansion. On the back of the Demon beast's head was something with golden lips and white teeth, bizarre and inexplicable. Its eyes were tightly shut, and a pale golden light surged out, threatening to submerge everything.

'What is this demon beast...'

But the very instant he appeared at the island, that pair of eyes suddenly snapped open, revealing pure white pupils. It stared at Li Ximing with profound interest!

'It can sense me remotely, even through the Great Purple Light Formation?! This thing is far too terrifying!'

At first glance, he had thought it was some kind of Dharma Body the other had cultivated, or perhaps a unique injury. But with just that one look, Li Ximing's heart went cold. He spoke in a perfectly natural voice:

"Is Daoist Master Yuanbian in seclusion?"

Li Que'wan was extremely sharp and nodded repeatedly. Li Ximing knew this was no place to talk. He immediately fabricated an excuse, smiling.

"I came out this time to visit the Nine Mounds. I'll take you along. We shouldn't disturb him. Let's go!"

Li Ximing had her leave a written note, then casually took the young woman's hand. Bracing himself, he acted as if nothing was wrong and rode the wind away. He could feel those pure white eyes slowly moving, quietly watching in the direction he had left.

Only after Li Ximing had vanished from sight did that pair of eyes slowly move back. The pale golden lips smacked together, and a garbled mumble suddenly became clear:

"Bright... Yang... Li..."

The lips twisted continuously, the skin seeming to be controlled by many different people, forming very awkward shapes. It kept smacking, gradually becoming more proficient. After a long while, it formed the words again:

"Bright Yang useless... Want... Lesser Yang..."

This sentence seemed to be some kind of command. Fuxun's eyes snapped open in an instant. He subconsciously stood up and started to walk forward. But as his hand touched the entrance of the cave-mansion, he woke as if from a dream. He couldn't detect anything amiss. He simply lowered his head, his eyes clear and calm, and said thoughtfully:

"Indeed. My injury is severe. But if I could have a **Lesser Yang** cultivator examine it, it would be far better than me wasting years to no avail!"




# Chapter 1060: The Five Virtues Doctrine

The waters of the Peacock Sea shimmered with myriad colors, beautiful under the glow of the Heavenly Light. Li Ximing flew on his beam of light, his expression heavy with thought.

He had left in a hurry, ostensibly to deal with the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. A trip to the Nine Mounds was necessary, true, but it was hardly _this_ urgent. The truth was, when he'd arrived back at the island, one look had made his scalp crawl. He hadn't dared to step foot inside. Thankfully, this "urgent business" provided the perfect excuse to immediately get Li Que'wan away from there.

As they traveled, he listened to Li Que'wan's account, and all Li Ximing could do was laugh bitterly.

"Life is full of unexpected turns... When I invited Senior Liu to the island all those years ago, I worried he might attract... undesirable elements. I never thought it would actually come to pass."

Hearing his transmitted thoughts, Li Que'wan worried he was blaming Liu Changdie and quickly replied, "Lord Liu has been very kind to us all these years. It's not as if he _meant_ for this to happen..."

Li Ximing saw her mistake and shook his head.

"This can't be blamed on anyone. If Senior Liu hadn't been guarding the Eastern Sea, the Wave-Suppressing Mansion would have been lost long ago. Not to mention, we would never have had such a steady supply of Neck Feathers!"

The Wave-Suppressing Mansion had been incredibly valuable over the years. The amount of Wall-Sinking Water they had collected was staggering, pool after pool of it, so much that the price for Wall-Sinking Water in the Eastern Sea had skyrocketed. If Daoist Master Kuang Yu hadn't also been collecting it under her own name, they would have drawn far too much unwanted attention.

Eventually, Wall-Sinking Water became nearly impossible to find. But thanks to that long period of accumulation, Li Ximing had been able to covertly trade with Golden Feather for Profound Shell Flower-Leaves twice more. After a total of four such trades, he _still_ had two Neck Feathers in reserve. And that wasn't even counting the other spiritual resources obtained through those exchanges, which were easily worth as much as two or three Spiritual Artifacts.

He said worriedly, "Look... his claim about finding the Dragon-kin isn't baseless. We should just do our best to satisfy his request. Let those nobles fight amongst themselves. The important thing is to get him off our island, and fast."

Li Que'wan remained anxious.

"If something goes wrong, I just pray the Dragon-kin don't take their anger out on our family. We're forced to pretend we see nothing, caught right in the middle. If they decide to blame us, there's no way to escape."

Li Ximing gave her a deep look.

"They won't dare. They will not provoke Minghuang."

Li Que'wan nodded thoughtfully. Li Ximing, however, turned the situation over in his mind, suddenly unsure what he should or shouldn't say.

The only two people in the Li family who truly understood their current predicament were Li Zhouwei and himself. Li Que'wan was resilient and gentle-natured; she could be told some of it. But Li Jiangqian... his mind was far too active. Li Ximing found he didn't dare discuss it with him. He sighed internally.

'Let Zhouwei decide for himself... I'll just keep my mouth shut.'

He pushed the thought aside, but the anxiety in his heart only deepened. Even with the excuse, he could only rush toward the Nine Mounds. After something like this, how could he possibly feel settled? Gritting his teeth, he finally made a decision,

'I didn't want to disturb Zhouwei, but this threatens the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, and possibly our very foundation... I'm afraid I have to see him.'

And so, he flew with Li Que'wan over the Peacock Sea for a time, but not directly toward the Nine Mounds. Instead, he veered toward the East A-Wang Sea. There, he dove beneath the waves, locating a hidden recess in the seabed—the very same subterranean cavern where he had refined the Treasured Pill all those years ago.

He had cleaned the place meticulously, leaving no lingering aura of pills or herbs. Li Ximing casually sealed the entrance, scanned the surroundings to ensure they were alone, and instructed Li Que'wan to cultivate while she waited. Then, he rose into the air, drifting away toward the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

A moment later, his vision filled with interlocking gold and white. The familiar sight of the sun and moon shining together, and the perfectly stable spiritual aura, materialized around him. Li Ximing descended from the entrance pavilion. The entire space was bathed in radiance. He saw the man seated atop the platform in the center of the courtyard.

Li Zhouwei had removed his armor and wore a simple grey Daoist robe. His long hair, rarely unbound, spilled down his back. He sat silently cross-legged on the platform, resembling an ancient, slumbering lion coiled in its lair.

Li Ximing then recalled that Li Zhouwei's armor was being repaired in the Baleful Fire Qi of Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Strangely, without that imposing suit of profound armor, the junior before him somehow seemed even more unsettling.

Li Ximing took a single step forward. Instantly, those golden eyes snapped open, keenly alert. A pool of cold, golden light shone from the shadowed courtyard, falling directly onto Li Ximing's face.

"Minghuang!"

The soft call made the vision of the white qilin vanish. Li Zhouwei stood, gathering his long hair with one hand and tying it back as he spoke respectfully,

"What instructions does Grand-Uncle have for me?"

Li Ximing sighed.

"Trouble has found us. I'm afraid I might need you to go out and take a look..."

He quickly explained the situation. As he listened, Li Zhouwei's gaze grew heavy. He stepped off the platform, and his first question was:

"In his letters, did Liu Changdie ever mention Fuxun seeking an audience with the Dragon-kin?"

Li Ximing replied, "He did..."

This earned a slight nod from Li Zhouwei.

"The fact that my injuries have healed is a closely guarded secret. It's critical for the plans to come, so I cannot leave seclusion. If I'm revealed, it could very well trigger the war between north and south prematurely. I cannot go."

His expression was distant as he continued, "As for the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, that's not difficult to resolve. Since Liu Changdie already mentioned it, your trip now has a perfect pretext. I'll write a letter at once. Grand-Uncle, you will take it to Chongzhou and give it to Huiyao. Have him ask the Sea-Patrolling Envoy to make a trip to the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. That will solve the problem without our family getting too deeply involved."

He raised his hand slightly, drawing a piece of silk cloth from his sleeve. He conjured a brush from thin air and, using his divine ability and dharma power as ink, began to write golden characters on the cloth. His expression was stern.

"I will frame it as arranging my affairs and appointing a Demon King to look after the Li family's younger generation. The White Dragon Shrine will not refuse such a request."

Li Ximing nodded, relieved. Li Zhouwei finished the letter with a final stroke.

"As for Suining," he said in a low voice, "you don't need to worry, Grand-Uncle. Just feign ignorance. I was already planning to see Qingyu Qian; I have a plan for this. We'll just send Suining into seclusion. In five or six years, I'll have arrangements in place. If it _is_ some external influence, it won't be too late to eliminate it then."

Hearing this, Li Ximing understood Li Zhouwei's absolute determination to achieve his next divine ability. He didn't ask what would happen if disaster struck during those five or six years. His worried expression gradually calmed. He raised an eyebrow and looked at his grand-nephew.

"I will go and request a Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill for you."

Li Zhouwei paused, but finally nodded. Li Ximing silently tucked the letter away as Li Zhouwei added a reminder.

"The yin and yang in this place are perfectly balanced; that balance will leave a trace on the cloth. Since this is for the Dragon-kin, let it air out for a while after you leave. Don't be in a hurry to deliver it."

Li Ximing nodded and walked out quickly. When he reached the steps, he hesitated and glanced back. The young man was already seated on the platform again, as still and imposing as a divine statue.

...

In the cavern, the fire vein pulsed with power. Li Que'wan had been waiting for a long time when Li Ximing finally stepped out of the void and reappeared.

The Daoist Master's expression was natural, and he seemed much more relaxed. He patted her on the head and smiled.

"Don't worry. It's all been handled."

He then summoned his light and sped outward. Seeing Li Que'wan's confused expression, he began to reassure her.

"You're not at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, so even if its Purple Mansion Great Formation is lost, it's fine. This place we're going to is the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition. The host is Daoist Master Yuandao. You must be proper and polite. Don't speak out of turn; only answer if you are directly asked."

Li Que'wan indeed looked a little nervous, but she nodded seriously. Li Ximing chuckled.

"I fled here once when I was gravely injured... You mentioned you were 'touring the east,' so we'll stick with that story. The master of Nine Mounds was very kind to me back then, even giving me a type of spiritual fire. You must make a good impression. I also plan to... probe him a little today. If anything happens in the future, if you find yourself wandering the seas alone, this is a place you might be able to come for help."

Li Que'wan's serious expression immediately crumbled. She pressed her lips together and gave a small, low sound of assent.

Decades had passed since his last visit, but Nine Mounds Mountain was still a sea of crimson and purple. Maple leaves rippled like waves in the sea breeze. Li Ximing waited before the main gate. Soon, he saw an old man descending a small mountain path and immediately smiled and bowed.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, it has been a long time!"

This old man was none other than the old Daoist Master Lingdu!

The old Daoist Master's cultivation wasn't exceptionally high, but he had the classic bearing of an immortal sage. His kind, benevolent face instantly put one at ease. Li Ximing smiled, his heart settling a bit.

"Greetings, Senior... I was ignorant in my youth and caused you much trouble..."

Lingdu just smiled, shook his head, and invited him up the mountain.

"Nonsense, nonsense..."

The two exchanged pleasantries as they walked up to the maple grove. The stone table where Lingdu and Houfu had once played their game was still there on the summit. Li Ximing sighed inwardly at the sight and deliberately took a seat to the side, rather than opposite.

Lingdu saw the gesture and shook his head, saying nothing. Li Ximing, in turn, tacitly avoided mentioning the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. He accepted the tea the old man offered.

"I came this time... to ask about your esteemed order's Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew. My family has a promising junior who cultivates the path of Lesser Yin, and I am trying to plan for his future."

Lingdu raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

"He cultivates...?"

Li Ximing replied, "All-Fragrance Sinks."

"How rare!"

Lingdu praised the fact, then set down his tea.

"That's not difficult," he smiled. "Are you looking to help him break through to a new divine ability? Are you asking to reserve a spot in the pool for your friend?"

Li Ximing had cultivated in the Shade-Cleansing Pool before and knew it could sharpen one's spiritual senses, making it highly beneficial for breaking through to a new divine ability. But he had never imagined the Daoist Master would be this generous; he had only intended to ask for a small vial of the pool's water. A look of delighted surprise crossed his face.

"Senior, that is too great a kindness! I was only going to ask for a small sample of the Wondrous Dew!"

Lingdu laughed and shook his head, his expression turning serious.

"In the Shade-Cleansing Pool, the Lesser Yin is heavy and the Pure Qi sinks deep. Not just anyone can break through in there. The very reason it can condense a spiritual resource like the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew is to specifically aid the cultivation of those on the Lesser Yin path."

He tapped lightly on the tabletop. A cultivator hurried over and bowed to them both. Lingdu gave his instructions.

"Go fetch the Profound Urn. Have your Eldest Disciple-Brother join you. Wait for the midnight hour, and when it unseals, draw a full urn of Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew and bring it here."

He turned back to Li Ximing.

"Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew normally cannot be removed from the pool. However, our Daoist tradition has studied it for many years and made some progress. We possess a 'Cinnabar-Mark Profound Urn' crafted from treasures of Lesser Yin and Pure Qi. With this urn, the dew can be transported for a short time, though it still cannot be preserved indefinitely."

He smiled.

"The 'Cinnabar-Mark Profound Urn' is, however, a spirit embryo that my disciple is currently nurturing. After you have used it, Daoist Friend, please remember to return the Profound Urn."

"Thank you! Thank you!"

Li Ximing nodded gravely. If this had been years ago, he would have been stunned at their willingness to casually lend out a spirit embryo. But having seen more of the world, it now felt... normal. Daoist traditions like this one had been accumulating treasures since ancient times; who knew what wonders they possessed.

'It's a long journey back here,' he thought. 'I'll just have Guo Nanwu run the errand when the time comes.'

But Li Ximing had no intention of accepting such a gift for free. He immediately retrieved a box from his sleeve and presented it solemnly.

"Here is a Cangzhou Serpent Scale and a Neck Feather. Please accept them as compensation. First, as thanks for the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew, and second, as gratitude for the kindness you showed me when you saved my life all those years ago!"

There was a reason Li Ximing had immediately apologized for his "ignorance" back then. In those days, he hadn't understood just how precious the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew was for advancing a divine ability. Now, he understood perfectly. Sima Yuanli had used the Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder to advance his own, and that was refined from a Hollow-heart Profound Mulberry—a true spiritual treasure!

By that logic, the amount the Shade-Cleansing Pool could condense must be limited. When he had used his Valley Wind Guide-Fire art back then, he had absorbed far more than a single person's share. How could they _not_ have known?

"Daoist Friend, you are truly too polite."

Seeing Li Ximing's gesture, Lingdu gave him an appreciative look, but he smiled and pushed the box back.

"The Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew only has that 'advancing divine ability' effect when one is _inside_ the Shade-Cleansing Pool. The true efficacy lies in the pool itself. Otherwise, why would I offer a full urn for a junior at the Foundation Establishment Realm? You don't need to be so concerned."

"And as for the Shade-Cleansing Pool itself, Daoist Friend, don't overestimate it. While it can certainly clarify the spiritual sense, breaking through to a new divine ability is a matter of natural law. When that state of obscuration emerges, the Shade-Cleansing Pool cannot dispel it. And if heart-devils arise, that is one's own battle to fight."

Li Ximing finally understood. He nodded thoughtfully, leaving the returned box on the table. He sensed an opportunity and, feigning a hint of reluctance, pressed on.

"This... obscuration... can it truly not be removed? With so many mighty cultivators throughout history, is there not a single precedent?"

He was clearly, if subtly, asking about his own family's situation. The question was posed naturally. Lingdu stroked his beard, pausing for a moment before he spoke.

"It is not _entirely_ so. Has Daoist Friend ever heard of... the Wuguan Legacy?"

Li Ximing raised his eyebrows, adopting a posture of keen interest as the old man continued.

"The Three Profound Daoist Traditions each have their own orthodoxies and differing philosophies. Long, long ago, in the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition, there was a great figure named Wuguan. He was the first to propose abolishing the Five Virtues Doctrine and replacing it with the Clear-Deep Six Movements Theory. He occupied the Pure Qi Intercalary Position and was one of the four ancestors of the Ancient Demonic Dao."

"He left behind a legacy, one transformed from his own Rank Designation. Those favored by this legacy can obtain many wondrous benefits. One of those benefits is precisely the power to reduce that state of obscuration and elevate the Shengyang Acupoint."

Li Ximing frowned, finding this difficult to grasp.

"Abolish the Five Virtues Doctrine? The Five Virtues are a fundamental principle of heaven and earth. How can they simply be abolished?"

Lingdu shook his head.

"Fire Virtue, Water Virtue... these are just the unified names used by the various sects. But what _is_ the true connection between water and fire? Why should the Five Elements be collectively called the Five Virtues? You yourself have heard that Earth Virtue has five earths, yet there is also a sixth earth, Azure Manifestation. And Azure Manifestation is _also_ classified as Ancient Merging, is it not?"

"Ultimately, these are just names people have grown accustomed to using. In the eyes of those at a higher level, Fruition Attainments are simply higher or lower, some closer, some more distant. There isn't one grand, overarching category. Or perhaps there was, but the various immortals and Immortal Lords could never fully agree on one, and so, it ceased to exist."

"In ancient times, the world was at peace. Conflicts were not over life and death, but debates between Daoist Traditions. Cultivators openly exchanged knowledge, generously sharing their own Daoist canons. Many schools of thought contended, and so these various doctrines spread throughout the lands."

He glanced at Li Que'wan, who was standing behind Li Ximing, and smiled with amusement.

"For example, the progenitor of the Whole Pill dao referred to the Three Shamans and Two Rites as the 'Prime Virtue,' placing it as a _sixth_ virtue. He claimed that the Whole Pill was the 'origin-embryo' of the Prime Virtue, and the Prime Virtue was the 'root-nature' of the Whole Pill. This teaching is still passed down today. Every major tradition has its own doctrine, created to better organize its own cultivation methods and make it easier for future generations to practice. He was another of the figures who supported abolishing the Five Virtues Doctrine. If you were a Whole Pill cultivator, using the 'Whole Pill Prime Virtue Theory' to understand the world's mysteries and the transformation of elements would certainly be more intuitive than the Five Virtues Doctrine!"

Li Que'wan looked up thoughtfully, understanding that the old Daoist Master was intentionally enlightening her as he spoke.

"The Purple-Gold Dao, on the other hand, just carelessly lumps all the many Dao lineages that exist outside the Five Virtues and Twelve Qis together, calling them 'Ancient Merging Methods.' While there's no issue with practicing them, it's a clear symbol of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao's shortsighted, shallow foundation at its origin."

"And that is why Azure Manifestation can be both the 'sixth earth' and also Ancient Merging. There is no conflict!"




# Chapter 1061: First Residence

Li Ximing listened for a while and felt a sense of sudden enlightenment. He said thoughtfully, 'When I cultivate, I sense that the Ancient Merging methods are all different. Whether it's the Five Virtues or the Twelve Qis, they all have similar marvels and are combined, but the Ancient Merging itself is extremely different. At the time, I often attributed it to the strangeness of ancient methods... simply the principles of heaven and earth.'

He paused and replied, "I visited Poluoduo once in my early years and heard the term 'Three Shamans and Two Rites' there. I thought it was just a classification within the Ancient Merging, but I never expected it to be relevant here!"

Lingdu raised his eyebrows, a slight smile appearing.

"Poluoduo was originally a barren, savage land, but quite a few ancient cultivators seeking tranquility, or perhaps demonic cultivators fleeing disaster, went there. It's natural that some legacies were left behind."

He then turned, pouring tea, and said, "Our Daoist Tradition of Tai-Tao and the Nine Mounds is passed down from Azure Profoundity. This Nine Mounds Mountain beneath our feet was also called Spirit-Pacifying Moon-Clear Mountain in ancient times. However, as Yin and Yang waned, it became vastly different from before. In terms of our Daoist Tradition, we are inheritors of the 'Yin-Yang Primacy Doctrine.'"

He smiled. "This isn't hard to explain. Within our Daoist Tradition, Yin and Yang are held higher than the Five Virtues. There are, and only are, Three Yin and Three Yang. As for how to coordinate the methods of the Ancient Merging, there are various disagreements within the mountain. The 'Prime Virtue Doctrine' also has quite a few adherents..."

"Jiangnan successively experienced proselytizing by the Chu State and the Immortal Mansion. The overarching Daoist Canon there is based on Yin-Yang, the Five Virtues, and the Twelve Qis. Although they don't compare Yin-Yang and the Five Virtues in hierarchy, they also recognize Three Yin and Three Yang, which is similar to us."

Li Ximing didn't know the purpose of comparing the hierarchy of Yin-Yang and the Five Virtues, but it didn't stop him from having a realization. He looked up and asked,

"Placing the Five Virtues above Yin and Yang... that is likely a Northern Daoist Tradition, isn't it?"

Lingdu's hand, which was pouring tea, paused. He hesitated for a moment, then shook his head. "The philosophies within are complex, and the disagreements many. I'm afraid only our Great Daoist Master can make sense of it all. But Zhaojing, if you must speak of something _above_ Yin and Yang... in truth, only 'Pure Qi' has a few adherents who would recognize it as such."

Although his words were reserved, afraid to say too much, Li Ximing was already thoroughly convinced.

'Who in this world places the Five Virtues above Yin and Yang? Using Earth Virtue to shepherd Bright Yang... isn't that an expression of the Five Virtues suppressing Yin and Yang?'

The low, heavy words of Li Zhouwei from years ago surfaced in his mind: 'Too many people in this world want Li Qianyuan dead! The conflict between the North and him isn't just rooted in Daoist Traditions, Dao Paths, and divine abilities; it's also rooted in grievances, philosophies, and cultivation...'

Li Ximing sighed internally. 'Bright Yang being suppressed beneath Earth Virtue... many people were likely unwilling to see that. But Li Qianyuan's path was too tyrannical... so tyrannical that all the immortal cultivators in the world set aside their disputes to deal with him. That is what led to this outcome...'

His thoughts grew complex. He sipped his tea silently for a moment, then set the cup down and smiled.

"This kind of precious ancient secret is something only the Nine Mounds Immortal Dao could possibly decipher, yet Senior has imparted it so generously. Zhaojing has gained much. Thank you, Senior!"

Lingdu smiled and shook his head. Li Ximing turned back to Li Que'wan and smiled.

"This old senior is giving you pointers, holding this profound discussion specifically for you. You must thank him properly."

The meaning behind Lingdu's words was far-reaching; it was obviously not just for Li Que'wan. But regardless of the fundamental purpose, with the Heavenly Glow blazing in the north, some pretext was needed. Li Ximing waited for Li Que'wan to give her thanks, a thought stirring in his mind.

'Old Daoist Master Lingdu is quite amicable, and the Nine Mounds Daoist Tradition seems easy to get along with... Right now, the Wave-Suppressing Mansion is unstable, and it's even harder to say if the Fuxun matter can be handled. If it implicates Senior Liu and a fight breaks out one day while Que'Wan is still in seclusion on that island... then my family will have lost a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!'

'Since we're already at Nine Mounds, why not rent a cultivation abode and let Que'Wan break through here...'

Li Ximing wasn't worried about other things; this mountain might even be safer than the lake. The difficulty lay in Lingdu's willingness. Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then smiled first.

"Junior came here this time to fulfill an appointment with Daoist Master Yan. It has been several decades since we last parted. I wonder if Daoist Master Yan is well?"

Lingdu stroked his beard and mulled it over for a long time before finally saying, "He's the same as always. A few years ago, an important junior of his failed their breakthrough, which left him mentally and physically exhausted. Then, while traveling the outer seas, he fought with someone—who knows who—and not only failed to get the treasure but also returned injured. Back home, his eldest son caused more trouble, making him so angry he nearly killed him... In short, he's not having a good time."

Li Ximing nodded, seemingly considering something. Lingdu then smiled.

"Que'Wan... it's inconvenient for you to bring her along. Leave her on the mountain. I'll watch over her for you."

Li Ximing had been waiting for those exact words. He had someone lead Li Que'wan away, and only then did his expression turn serious. "Senior, what do you think of this child of my family?"

Lingdu raised an eyebrow and smiled, his tone filled with admiration.

"Rare, truly rare. That body of dharma power and True Essence... I should really have my Nine Mounds disciples take a good look, just to let them know there's always someone better out there!"

Li Ximing lowered his voice.

"It's embarrassing to say, but this junior has also reached the point of needing to assail the divine ability stage. Unfortunately, I have many matters to attend to next, and I don't know when Daoist Master Yan's affair will be concluded. It's hard on her, following me around, rushing from place to place."

Lingdu raised an eyebrow, understanding perfectly.

'He's asking for protection... It's a good thing she's a girl, and not of the Bright Yang bloodline. Otherwise, it would be difficult to forge this connection...'

He laughed and said, "What's so difficult about that? The spiritual atmosphere at Nine Mounds is stable, and Pure Qi is abundant. If, Fellow Daoist, you estimate you have enough time, just have her enter seclusion on my mountain!"

"How could I impose..."

Li Ximing chuckled and exchanged a few polite pleasantries with him, and the matter was thus settled. But this, in turn, reminded Li Ximing of something even more important.

'In all these years, I haven't gathered a single piece of news about Whole Pill spiritual items. If Que'Wan breaks through, she'll have to use the Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue. What a waste...'

The Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue wasn't bad; it was _too_ good, to the point of being wasteful. He proceeded to ask Lingdu, but this time the old man finally shook his head. "We once had a 'Prime-Response Metal'. Later, when Daoist Master Qiushui needed to cross the immortal threshold, she collected six types of Whole Pill spiritual items to verify her cultivation, and someone from Golden Feather traded for it."

Li Ximing's teeth practically ached hearing this. He was about to take his leave, but Lingdu stopped him. He took a jade talisman from his robes and smiled. 

"Take this and show it to him, as proof you've already been to Nine Mounds."

Li Ximing paused, then immediately understood.

He was no longer afraid of what Yan Dushui might be plotting; on the contrary, Yan Dushui was now afraid of _him_. If he helped Yan Dushui open the treasure and was then overcome by greed, killing him to seize it, Yan Dushui's old body truly couldn't take it. Having this Nine Mounds jade talisman as a witness would set his mind at ease.

He smiled and accepted it, then rode the wind away from the mountain. He crossed the glittering sea and soon saw the West Curtain Sea.

The high seabed once again appeared below. Decades had passed, but the mortals here were still harvesting reefs for the Panorama Immortal Gate, just as their ancestors had, suffering the calamity of drowning. The only difference was that things looked much more chaotic, which must be due to instability within the Immortal Gate.

He waited for a while. A bright Heavenly Light shone in the sky. After a moment, there was a disturbance in the Great Void, and Daoist Master Lin Yi—Yan Dushui—hurriedly arrived.

The old Daoist Master was still draped in his white feathered robe, his appearance largely unchanged. However, his demeanor was far worse than before. A gloomy, volatile, and sharp light floated in his eyes, lacking the peaceful look of the past. He only restrained it upon seeing him, saying joyfully, 

"Fellow Daoist Zhaojing has arrived!"

The old man, afraid his joy was in vain, stared at him intently. Only when he saw Li Ximing nod with a smile and produce the jade talisman from his sleeve did he comprehend, exclaiming with both joy and envy,

"Zhaojing's cultivation speed is truly formidable."

Li Ximing was no longer the greenhorn who had just set out. He was much more composed. He gave him an extra look and smiled.

"It seems these years have not been easy for Daoist Master Lin Yi."

Yan Dushui led him inside, his expression dark.

"The sensible junior perished, and the ones who remain are unfilial, rotten to the core. Not even a divine ability could save them. Yesterday, I killed a few to rectify the atmosphere on the mountain."

No matter how worthless one's disciples or juniors were, those who resorted to butchering them were few. Li Ximing was slightly taken aback and didn't know how to respond. He understood that the Panorama Immortal Gate had weakened severely over the past decades.

"How did it come to this," he replied.

Yan Dushui looked somewhat lost.

"It's no great matter. I'm more worried that the spirit veins of the West Curtain Sea are failing. It's one thing to have no resources, but as the younger generation's cultivation falters, we're finding fewer and fewer children with spiritual apertures..."

The two passed through layer after layer of the sea region. Yan Dushui then drilled down toward the seabed. Soon, they found a thumb-sized fissure on the sea floor. The two of them flickered, transforming into two streaks of light and tunneled down, going deep.

Li Ximing was bored to death, and his mind started to whirl.

'Yan Dushui seems to be nearing the end of his lifespan... In that case... things must be arranged in advance.'

Yan Dushui owed him a favor for taking action. Li Ximing's original intention for using him was to deal with a Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast, to be used for a sacrifice. If he waited until Yan Dushui perished, even if Jishan couldn't escape the obligation, what use was a group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators?

'Jiangqian is also about to break through. I must use this guy's favor! And as it happens, there's also Guo Nanwu!'

The two of them sometimes vanished into the Great Void, sometimes leaped out at disconnected points. After traveling an unknown distance, Yan Dushui finally came to a sudden halt. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He saw that this place was a cultivation abode. The entrance was very simple, without even a plaque.

The stone door was slightly ajar. The threshold was frighteningly high, reaching an adult's waist. Two small holes were dug on either side, and a faint blue flame burned weakly within them.

Li Ximing's expression finally turned grave. He swept the area carefully with his spiritual sense, only to find that everything before him was a blur. It was even less clear in his spiritual sense than it was to his naked eye!

"This is... 'Exiled Qi'..."

Li Ximing's heart tensed. He heard Yan Dushui say with emotion,

"This is the place!"

He turned his head and instructed solemnly, "Fellow Daoist Zhaojing, this cultivation abode is supported by a single treasure. Normally, the things inside are inert, like dead objects. But as soon as someone enters, the treasure immediately resumes burning. When it burns out, this abode will vanish like smoke..."

"My ancestors entered many times. It has been passed down to this day, and it's already half-burned. Once we enter, we cannot hesitate for even a moment. We must act quickly!"

'As expected of something from the Underworld...'

Li Ximing marveled silently and nodded in agreement.

Yan Dushui stepped inside, his figure flickering between light and shadow. Li Ximing, however, walked forward slowly, stopping at the high threshold. He immediately saw the main hall of the abode. It was pitch black. A table and a stool sat in the center. On the table, there seemed to be a bowl, and within the bowl, a speck of red light shimmered. The rest of the place was dark and deep, like a ghostly mansion.

Spiritual sense was useless here; he could only rely on his blurry vision. Yan Dushui himself hadn't been here many times and looked somewhat terrified. Li Ximing, however, steadied himself and connected with his spiritual sense.

'Immortal Mirror!'

A transcendent feeling descended. In an instant, all the darkness before him vanished. The threshold, the stone table, the stone chair—all of it disappeared! Before him was just an enclosed space of black stone. There was no cultivation abode at all, just a low, short stone hollow, about the size of a desk!

In the center of this stone hollow was a pile of pale black, withered firewood. From a distance, it was just the right size to resemble a dog's kennel.

Scattered on this pale black firewood was a pure white skull, facing upward. Its jaw was tilted high, revealing the empty space within. Looked at this way, it rather resembled a cenotaph dug casually by some cultivator!

Li Ximing swallowed silently. He knew where that "cultivation abode" had come from now.

'This is a pocket realm built by an ancient... a small immortal abode, but it's _attached_ to this skeleton!'

He suddenly understood. Hearing Yan Dushui call to him from within the "abode," he stepped inside. The darkness that rushed to meet him was bone-chillingly cold. Li Ximing gently pinched some of the darkness in his hand and was immediately stunned.

'Purple Qi, Cold Qi... and it seems there's Lesser Yin and Supreme Yin as well...'

Li Ximing looked down and saw, in the bowl on the table, half a stick of faint yellow incense, as thick as a pinky finger. Just one look at it stunned him.

He actually recognized this thing—it was identical to the profound incense Li Zhouwei had brought back from Wanling Heaven!

And the speck of red he had seen from outside the abode was the smoldering, dark fire at the tip of this incense. It had already burned halfway. The other half, a segment of grayish-white ash, lay broken in the bowl, completely intact, not scattered in the slightest.

Yan Dushui walked up to him, his voice tense but hopeful, speaking very quickly.

"Fellow Daoist!"

Li Ximing awoke as if from a dream and quickly followed him inside. They walked several steps, passing through the main hall, and saw an inner chamber.

This chamber was extremely deep and long, shaped like a narrow box. The far end seemed to connect to some empty, vast space, from which a ghostly, cold wind blew, brushing past diamond-shaped jade stones hanging from the ceiling and causing them to _ding_ and _dong_.

The patterns on both sides were arcane, and the various decorations were bizarre and inexplicable, things he had never seen before, carved with numerous Shaman-Registers, birds, beasts, and ghostly symbols. They flickered in and out of sight in the dark mist.

There were three steps in this inner chamber. On the highest, golden, circular platform sat a piece of withered wood. It looked like a piece of broken mulberry that had withered halfway through its growth. The broken end was the size of a fist, but its root system below was wide, nearly as large as a tabletop!

Suspended above the broken surface of this dark mulberry wood was a faint black object: a feather, the length of an index finger and the thickness of a thumb. Its pitch-black surface was entwined with dense golden patterns. It had none of the aura of an immortal, transcendent being; instead, it inspired dread and felt utterly bizarre!

Yan Dushui had already hurried forward. He gently flipped his hand, carefully taking out a light-cyan jade casket covered in profound patterns. It seemed to be an important treasure. He gingerly placed it in Li Ximing's hands and said urgently,

"It's up to you now, Fellow Daoist!"

Li Ximing felt an icy chill as it touched his hands. He looked down, and his pupils finally contracted violently. His mind reeled—he, Li Ximing, had also seen this jade casket before. He even had one in his possession with similar, even mostly identical, patterns!

'The item from the Pingya Island marketplace back then!'

# Chapter 1062: The Profound Casket

In his youth, the ancestor Li Tongya witnessed the sacking of the Pingya Island market. He later infiltrated the site and, using a water-control art, retrieved a jade casket from the eye of the array. The casket was pale azure, covered in dense, profound markings, but it was empty.

Though the ancestor found no treasure within, he sensed the casket's unique quality for storing precious items. He carried it with him, and it was eventually passed down, later serving as the vessel for the Sword Codex.

Li Ximing was no swordsman and had rarely handled the casket, so he should not have recognized it. However, back when the Li clan unified Moongaze and dismantled the Great Prohibition Array on Pingya Island, Li Xijun had taken this very casket out to study the island's formations. Li Ximing had been present and caught a glimpse, searing it into his memory.

Watching a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator now present this very object with such cautious stealth, how could Li Ximing not be astonished? It wasn't the right moment for questions. He formed a hand seal, activating 'World's Radiance'. The intangible Light of the Six Harmonies immediately gathered at his fingertips as he began a careful divination.

Yan Dushui didn't notice Li Ximing's brief stupor. He retrieved a black jade slip from his sleeve and handed it over, whispering, "Fellow Daoist, please press this talisman to your brow. It's the only way to see the spiritual object. This thing is incredibly bizarre. If it weren't anchored here by this piece of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, it would have drifted off long ago."

"Just... lifting it... it might shave off a bit of your destiny. I won't take any of the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. It will all be yours as compensation!"

Li Ximing could already see everything clearly with his Immortal Mirror, but he accepted the jade slip with grim gravity, applied the talisman, and fell into thought.

The spiritual object was truly mystical. When his spiritual sense, mighty for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, swept over the area, the wooden stake appeared utterly empty. He detected nothing. Only when the Light of the Six Harmonies grazed it did an anomaly flicker into existence.

The Light of the Six Harmonies was the Bright Yang Dao's only Life Divine Ability, its purpose to 'balance heaven and earth, interrogate the cosmos.' On a normal day, it sensed the energies of fate and destiny that saturated the world, filling every void. If spiritual sense perceived the world as an empty room containing various objects, the Light of the Six Harmonies perceived it as being submerged in a vast ocean, with those same objects resting on the seabed. The distinction was usually subtle.

But here in this cavern, his spiritual sense perceived only emptiness. The Light of the Six Harmonies _also_ perceived nothing but a void above the stump. This was a critical distinction. An ocean with no water? The anomaly was glaring.

'Exiled Qi can devour all energy signatures. If this were forged into a weapon, it could pass right through an enemy before they even knew they'd been hit!'

He marveled silently, opened the jade casket, and pushed it forward. He obviously couldn't touch the spiritual object directly with his divine ability; he could only use the Light of the Six Harmonies to nudge it, ever so gently, and lift.

The divine ability and dharma power within Li Ximing's body instantly hemorrhaged at a terrifying rate, as if he were trying to lift a mountain of blackest stone. The Light of the Six Harmonies wavered violently, yet all it accomplished was to make the feather flutter faintly.

But that faint flutter made Yan Dushui's eyes widen, his heart thumping in his chest.

'The master was right! This thing cannot be lifted by divine abilities or detected by spiritual sense. Only the fundamental order of heaven and earth, the ultimate destination of all spirits, the union of the cosmos and man, can interact with it... Thank heavens 'World's Radiance' is effective!'

Yan Dushui was overcome with joy, but Li Ximing's expression twisted.

As he moved the feather, his own Life Divine Ability was rapidly decaying. The Light of the Six Harmonies was being consumed, actively eroding his cultivation in that specific divine ability!

'Such a terrifying speed!'

His scalp prickled. He dumped his divine ability and dharma power into the effort like a raging waterfall, and the feather finally, _finally_ drifted down into the jade casket. Strangely, the moment the object—which had felt heavier than a mountain—settled inside, it became as light as its feathery appearance suggested, possessing no weight at all.

Li Ximing's face was now chalk white. The talisman on his brow dissolved into ash. He pushed through the exhaustion, using the last of his Light of the Six Harmonies to gather some of the cavern's black qi, sealing it in the casket to nourish the feather. He stood breathing deeply for several moments before a hint of color returned to his cheeks.

'Too close. If that talisman hadn't absorbed most of the backlash, I would have suffered internal injuries.'

After confirming he was internally sound, he sealed the casket and presented it to Yan Dushui.

"Congratulations!"

Yan Dushui's eyes were bloodshot. He nodded heavily, gestured to the stake on the platform, and said,

"The Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. It's all yours, Fellow Daoist."

Even though the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood could be taken normally with a divine ability, Li Ximing scanned it cautiously several times before reaching out to collect it. He then surveyed his surroundings, memorizing the various runes, and thought to himself:

'This place is long and narrow. It feels like a coffin.'

He suspected the black qi drifting in the air was valuable, so he began to bottle some. As he did, he watched Yan Dushui. The old man looked deeply conflicted, gazing around the room with a mixture of reluctance and hesitation, before finally stepping forward.

In the front hall, the incense stick still burned, though it was now slightly shorter. The darkness in the chamber seemed to have deepened, so thick you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.

Li Ximing took careful note of this and also spotted a second passage on the far side of the hall. When it became clear Yan Dushui had no intention of exploring it, Li Ximing's mind raced. He appeared to walk forward at a leisurely pace, but he was secretly activating his Immortal Artifact once more.

In an instant, the oppressive gloom vanished from his sight. The patterns on the walls became perfectly clear. Down the other passage, six stone lamps appeared, illuminating a path deep into the rock. At the passage's end stood a smooth stone wall.

Faint markings were etched upon the wall, outlining what looked like a small, sinister array. It pulsed with the profound mystery of the Shaman-Register Dao.

'This place isn't very large... no bigger than a house.'

Li Ximing had no time to study it further. The two men crossed the threshold and stepped outside, the cavern immediately vanishing behind them in the impenetrable black mist. When they had both fully exited the location and stepped back into the Great Void, they turned to look back, but the cavern was gone, as if it had never been.

Li Ximing's expression was carefully neutral, but he had already memorized the cavern's location. He turned to Yan Dushui. The old man was oblivious, listlessly clutching the casket and muttering,

"An ancestral treasure, passed down for a thousand years... and it ends up in someone else's hands."

Li Ximing knew the casket was destined for Nine Mounds; they had orchestrated this entire event. But what choice did Yan Dushui have? His lifespan was nearing its end, and his descendants were failures.

"Ancestral treasures exist to protect the clan," Li Ximing offered. "It doesn't really matter whose hands it falls into. Besides, this opportunity to build a relationship with Nine Mounds... other families would kill for it."

But these were just polite platitudes. Even Li Ximing, standing right beside him, felt little pity. His gaze was fixed on the jade casket. After a few more empty comforts, he allowed a trace of envy to show on his face and asked,
\
"This journey has been truly eye-opening. But... that casket... what is it? How can it so easily contain an object of Exiled Qi, something said to be completely undetectable?"

Yan Dushui was still agitated. He glanced back at Li Ximing, forcing a smile.

"This casket was lent to me by Daoist Master Lingdu of Nine Mounds, prepared specifically for this task. It's not just you who can't discern its origin, Fellow Daoist... I can't either."

Li Ximing nodded and pressed no further. The two proceeded in silence, walking by tacit agreement toward Nine Mounds Mountain. Only when the sea of crimson leaves covering the mountain slopes came into view did Yan Dushui speak again, his voice desolate.

"You were right, Fellow Daoist. My ancestors tried for generations, but not one could retrieve that thing. Without this jade casket, it was like entering a treasure mountain only to return empty-handed. It was all pointless, just leaving it there..."

They entered the mountain, and Li Ximing saw Lingdu sitting just as they had left him, quietly engrossed in a Daoist text. He seemed not to have moved an inch, simply waiting for their return.

Yan Dushui bowed respectfully before the table and smiled. "Master... This one, Lin Yi, has come to pay his respects. The item has been retrieved for you."

Li Ximing had known the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition held a high status, but he'd never imagined it was _this_ high. He was secretly speechless. Lingdu, however, acted as if this was perfectly normal. He smiled, invited them to sit, and placed the jade casket on the table.

"You've both worked hard," he said, raising an eyebrow.

The old man didn't open the casket. Instead, he drew a clay coin from his sleeve. It was barely two fingers wide and as thin as a cicada's wing. He placed it atop the casket. The side facing up was a glossy black, inscribed with four characters:

Treat Death as Life

As he set it down, the clay coin, moved by some invisible force, flipped over by itself, revealing the four characters on its other side:

Supreme Obscurity Becomes Sacred

Apparently, the jade casket could not be opened outside of that 'ghost-house'. Lingdu had to use this special method to confirm the spiritual object was inside. Content, he put the coin and casket away and turned to Yan Dushui.

"I have asked on your behalf. In addition to the pure essence you were promised, Zhiyan Peak is willing to form a bond. They will support three of your descendants, spanning from you to your grandchildren. As for whether any of them can awaken a divine ability... that will depend on your family's own fortune."

Yan Dushui nodded silently, offering his thanks again and again, before falling into a long silence. Lingdu then turned to Li Ximing with a smile. 

"Congratulations, Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing's gains from this trip were immense. While he had sacrificed a significant amount of his cultivation, that could eventually be restored with medicinal pills. A piece of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood the size of a tabletop, however, was a treasure he might never encounter again.

His thoughts had been completely stuck on the jade casket, but this reminder sent a thrill of joy through him.

'Zhouwei... me... Jiangqian... Que'Wan... this is more than enough for all our soul lamps. It's barely a fraction of the wood! I can cut off two palm-sized pieces for Minghui, and the rest will be more than enough to use freely. I can even start researching life-saving or body-splitting consumables...'

Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood was exceedingly precious. He had only heard that a few of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition possessed any, passed down from their ancestors specifically for their Purple Mansion Realm experts. He recalled that Changxi of Profound Peak Gate had used a 'Jade Seat Gold-and-Silver-veined Soul Lamp'. That lamp was merely a large life-jade, crafted from Bound Earth and other jade treasures. Its only advantage was that a divine ability could be infused into it for a long period without needing constant nurturing, making it convenient for a Purple Mansion cultivator.

Li Ximing was in high spirits, but Yan Dushui remained silent and mournful. Seeing this, Li Ximing returned to his previous question, asking once more about the mysterious casket. Lingdu smiled and shook his head, his expression gradually turning serious.

"If we are to speak of its true origin... it once belonged to True Monarch Taixu."

Li Ximing froze. Even Yan Dushui's head snapped up, his face a mask of disbelief.

"It is truly so... so revered?"

Lingdu sighed softly.

"At that time, True Monarch Taixu had not yet achieved the Dao. He was cultivating in the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven, known colloquially as the Green Pine Mirage-Realm. After all, the Green Pine Daoist Tradition has risen and fallen three times; its lineage has been fractured and rejoined. The Green Pine Temple alone is not its sole inheritor."

"Legend holds that there were several 'seats' within that realm. At each seat, a certain immortal left a jade casket for his disciples, corresponding to Cultivation Transcendence, Changhuai, Hengzhu, Sword Gate, Purple Smoke, and Azure Pond."

"This object is one of those. It is the very one that belonged to True Monarch Taixu."

He gave Li Ximing a heavy look.

"Your family has entered that realm before. You should have seen it."

'Green Pine Island!'

Li Ximing was reeling.

'If that's true... then the casket in _my_ possession... which one is it?!'

Li Ximing's mind raced, but he only nodded silently.

Lingdu continued, "When the True Monarchs opened that realm, there were six caskets inside. The Changhuai and Hengzhu ones were empty. The Azure Pond and Purple Smoke caskets were lost. The Sword Gate casket was recovered, and the Cultivation Transcendence one went to the Kui Cultivating Sect."

He deliberately said 'Kiu Cultivating' and paused. Seeing no surprise on Li Ximing's face, he understood that Li Ximing also knew of Xiukui's history. Stroking his beard, he went on.

"One of the lost caskets ended up with a certain cultivator. He was a man blessed by a fire-virtue destiny and possessed outstanding talent. Our Great Daoist Master thought very highly of him, looking after him and offering much guidance. Eventually, our Great Daoist Master acted as an intermediary to return the Purple Smoke casket. Great Daoist Master Zimu accepted the contents, but entrusted the jade casket itself to our Daoist Tradition for safekeeping."

Hearing this, Li Ximing was thunderstruck and momentarily speechless.

The Li family had been involved in that jade casket incident! The cultivator Lingdu mentioned... it was almost certainly the self-preserving Tu Longjian, who was now in hiding overseas!

'It was Senior Junjian!'

'Senior Junjian had deep ties with the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition! And not just that—it was on the guidance of this Great Daoist Master of Yuandao that he had left Jiangnan so early to hide in the Northern Sea!'

All the clues snapped together, and his expression grew grim. His heart pounded.

'When did this happen? Does this mean he was a pawn for the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition all along? When the other Daoist Masters sealed the Great Void, how did he escape? It must have been this Great Daoist Master who saved him! Only someone with his immense divine ability and Dao-Profundity could have spirited a man away from right under the noses of all those Daoist Masters!'

'And was this Great Daoist Master's motive all for this jade casket?'

He bit back his questions. His first instinct was to wonder if the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition's favor toward him was due to his connection with Senior Tu Longjian. But when he glanced at Lingdu, the old man seemed completely oblivious, offering no subtle glances or hints at the mention of Tu Longjian's name.

The old man continued on seamlessly.

"The casket itself isn't priceless. It was an ordinary thing, but it was present for the enlightenment of those True Monarchs and carries the symbolic weight of being passed from master to disciple. Because of this, it absorbed a sliver of their transcendent aura, becoming extraordinary. Storing rare and unusual treasures is, of course, no problem for it."

He seemed nostalgic, shaking his head.

"A Purple Mansion expert has already awakened a divine ability. Most objects permitted to circulate in this world cannot hide from such power. When you find something that even a Purple Mansion cultivator cannot identify the materials of, cannot guess the origin of... nine times out of ten, it is connected to a True Monarch. And ninety-nine percent of _those_ items are simply things a True Monarch once used..."

He sighed again.

"These things were never truly valued by those great beings. They don't have any specific, wondrous powers. In the hands of a low-level cultivator, they're useless, apart from being durable. Even in the hands of a figure with the heaven-shaking Dao-Profundity of a Great Daoist Master, its only use is to store a bit of Exiled Qi."

Listening to these secrets had eased Yan Dushui's dark mood. He couldn't help but ask,

"But what if such an item _was_ valued by them? What if it _does_ have some wondrous power?"

Lingdu turned to him and laughed.

"You can't outrun destiny. Your life would be over. At that point, what could you do but kneel and kowtow? You'd have to seriously consider if your life is worth more... You think you could actually _take_ such a thing?"




# Chapter 1063: The Dao of Nine Mounds

Li Ximing listened, and doubt began to surface in his mind.

'If... all six of the Chongming Scions' jade caskets are inside the Grotto-Heaven, how could one be out here? Besides, the timeline makes no sense. When Pingya Island was shattered, how old was the Green Pine Temple Grotto-Heaven? It's impossible for something to have escaped...'

He looked up at Lingdu, his expression thoughtful. "Do you know what happened to all those jade boxes? What was inside them? And... I remember there were numerous treasures under the prayer cushions in Chongming Hall. Weren't they all supposed to be miraculous? How were they handled?"

"Azure Pond's was lost. Purple Smoke's is here. The rest are in the hands of their respective Dao Lineages. As for what was inside... honestly, the valuable ones were empty. The ones that weren't empty just held small mementos of the patriarchs."

"The only truly valuable item was a treasure from the main hall called the Silent Bell."

Lingdu's eyebrows rose, his face filled with yearning. "I've heard it can change size. At its largest, it's like a mountain, the supreme Dharma Treasure. At its smallest, it's like a cup or a bell, appearing as a mere Spiritual Artifact or dharma artifact. Even a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator could use it! When it conceals its nature, it becomes like a common object; even a True Monarch could be fooled...

"Inscribed within it are countless profound Dao arts, allowing one to commune with heaven and earth and channel Material Transformation. It ultimately landed in the hands of that eminence from the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. That lord expended immense effort to acquire it, all for the sake of Daoist Master Qiushui's breakthrough!"

Seeing Li Ximing pensive, Lingdu wasn't surprised. He just chuckled.

"Whatever you're speculating, every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator back then had the same idea. They all figured that items used by such mighty figures must hide some profound mystery. That's the only reason so many of them bothered to carve up the spoils... Otherwise, why would that many Purple Mansion Realm experts fight over items fit for the Foundation Establishment Realm, or even mere mortal trinkets?"

"But... they were sorely disappointed. For the True Monarchs who are still living, their respective Dao Lineages naturally reclaimed their belongings. The few trifles that got out were useless. Only one or two were ever refined into spirit embryos."

He poured more tea, sighing.

"True Monarchs don't leave such wonders lying around. They prefer to conceal their presence, to obscure their Fruition Attainment. If a junior cultivator held one of their items, wouldn't it be like a beacon broadcasting their name? Not only would they attract the attention—and manipulation—of other True Monarchs, but it would also constantly reveal the status of their own Fruition Attainment. That is _not_ a good thing."

Li Ximing nodded inwardly. He understood this perfectly. Those who had formed a Golden Core and attained fruition left no traces; their very presence was scrubbed from the world... As he mulled this over, a new thought struck him.

"Green Pine Temple... has it really only opened once? I seem to remember that Guo Shentong, Changxiao, and that group... they also emerged from a Grotto-Heaven, didn't they?"

Changxiao was an old thorn in the Li family's side. Seeing that the old man before him was both knowledgeable and approachable, Li Ximing decided to seize the chance to kill two birds with one stone. He watched Lingdu sip his tea.

Lingdu smiled. "Guo Shentong, Yan Jianxiao... even Li Mei from the Sword Gate. They all came out of the same Grotto-Heaven, one from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. Back then... I was cultivating in the markets of the Eastern Sea and heard a whisper or two. It was called the 'Chuyi Grotto-Heaven.' And the one who gained the most from it wasn't Changxiao."

His expression grew solemn. "The very first to enter were the Miao Family and Situ Tang. There was another powerful figure, too, named Qu Tan—the grand-master of the current Daoist Master Xuanyi of Mount Jingyi. Those three went in first!"

"Within the Chuyi Grotto-Heaven lies the Encompassing Profoundity Mountain. It has three tiers, brimming with countless treasures, most of them aligned with Earth Virtue. On the highest tier, the 'First Mountain,' there are even Spiritual Treasures..."

As Li Ximing listened, he suddenly recalled the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain. Understanding flashed through his mind.

'So I _had_ heard of this Grotto-Heaven... When Zhu Gong mentioned the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain, she said it was a treasure from beneath the First Mountain of Encompassing Profoundity, and that Senior Lingmei obtained it... It was an Earth Virtue item, that's right... Could Daoist Master Xuanyi's Corner-Cleansing Merit Bottle have come from there as well?'

But Lingdu didn't pause, his voice dropping.

"And on that mountain, there is a spring. It connects to the Pure Qi above. Cultivating beside it allows one to seek a divine ability! Even if you can't cultivate there, just a single drink of its water is an immense boon."

At this, Yan Dushui's eyes lit up. Li Ximing's brows shot up, his expression startled. Lingdu nodded grimly.

"I asked the Great Daoist Master. It is, indeed, the Wuguan Legacy. Those cultivators back then all drank from that spring. Especially Qu Tan. His power was formidable, but his aptitude was poor—he had the least hope of anyone in the Purple Mansion Realm group. But by relying on that spring, he attained the Dao. A true carp leaping the dragon gate..."

The old man's tone shifted. "The Chuyi Grotto-Heaven has opened more than once. Green Pine Temple is no different. The world is full of talents. A batch of them slipped in secretly... the likes of Zhang Cuotian and Guo E..."

Hearing this, Li Ximing had a moment of sudden clarity.

'It _was_ Zhang Cuotian! The false identity of that marketplace master, Chen Taoping! That item... it must have come from the Grotto-Heaven. If so... where are the rest of the contents?'

Li Ximing fell into pensive silence. But Yan Dushui, who had lived abroad for so long, knew nothing of Green Pine Temple. His thoughts were entirely consumed by the Chuyi Grotto-Heaven.

"That Grotto-Heaven," he asked, his voice laced with hope, "is there any... any chance of entering? My descendant... I would only ask for a single drink from that spring!"

Lingdu gave him an empathetic look.

"Such opportunities are rare. Moreover, not just anyone can reach that place. And even if they could, they would need a descendant capable enough to seize the opportunity."

Though Lingdu's words were polite, Yan Dushui understood. With his remaining lifespan, he would never live to see it open. He certainly lacked the power to secure such a chance for his descendants. He sighed, offered a respectful bow, and departed in silence.

Li Ximing watched him go. Now that they were the only two left on the mountain, he also prepared to leave. Just as he was about to, a thought struck him.

'Daoist Master Yuandao has deep ties to the Peacock. He only helped me back then to collect that karmic fire... The Radiant Crimson Fiendfire I have now came from those Buddhist cultivators. This is the perfect opportunity to ask about it.'

He steered the conversation with a smile, then retrieved the precious pearl from his sleeve. It instantly flared with a dazzling golden light, shimmering with hypnotic, glazed colors. Lingdu's eyebrow rose.

Li Ximing smiled.

"Is Nine Mounds interested in this?"

Lingdu accepted it with both hands, scrutinizing it. After a dozen breaths, he said, a note of uncertainty in his voice,

"Radiant Crimson Fiendfire... Which fool defiled this? They had the Peacock's ambition but lacked the Peacock's power and standing. How pathetic."

Lingdu truly hailed from a great Daoist Tradition. He was slower to identify it than Li Ximing, but his insight was still profound. Li Ximing smiled.

"I acquired this from a Buddhist cultivator up north. I figured I'd try my luck here in the Immortal Dao."

Lingdu stroked his beard, silent for a long moment, his expression troubled. "It's not that the item isn't precious. But the spiritual resources required to purify it... that is a massive cost. To say nothing of the immense effort involved..."

Just then, a hot gust of wind swept across the mountain peak. An exceptionally tall young man materialized at the table. He was dressed in formal, profound robes, a silk sash at his waist, his eyes crinkling with a smile.

'Daoist Master Yuandao!'

Li Ximing shot up from his seat, bowing with a hint of trepidation.

"Junior pays his respects, Great Daoist Master!"

When Li Ximing had first come here, he was green. He knew the man was powerful, but he had no concept of _how_ powerful. Now, having seen countless experts and great masters across the land, he finally understood the terrifying weight of the man's 'Perfected divine ability.'

'This is a _perfected_ divine ability!'

'This Daoist Master Yuandao... he might be the most powerful cultivator I have ever met! Even the Lord of the Profound Governance Pavilion is probably his inferior!'

Furthermore, now that he had cultivated the World's Radiance, his perception was far keener. The man stood before him, yet he commanded the spiritual pulse of the entire mountain range. A hazy, crimson Fire Virtue draped over him like a robe, and a shocking realization struck Li Ximing.

'His life-mandate is whole... He... he has a real chance to attain the Great Dao.'

His bow was far deeper than it had been all those years ago. Daoist Master Yuandao, however, seemed exactly the same. He smiled, gestured for Li Ximing to sit, and remarked,

"Your divine ability has progressed swiftly."

Li Ximing murmured that he was undeserving. Daoist Master Yuandao didn't press, instead taking the pearl. He held it between three jade-white fingers and commented lightly,

"This is from the Murong family, of the Way of Compassion. No wonder you were in a bind."

His handsome eyes turned to Li Ximing, a subtle hint within them. He smiled.

"Another Blazing Fire, and one outside the category of True Conjoined Triple Fire. A troublesome thing to resolve."

How could Li Ximing fail to understand? He flushed, unsure how to respond. It was horrifyingly clear: the little secret he'd guarded for years was no secret at all to the man before him.

'The Intercalary Sun Art came from Senior Junjian. Since Senior Junjian is so close to Nine Mounds, the Great Daoist Master must have known about the art long ago. It's not surprising... He probably knew from the very first time I visited.'

But the art was too valuable. Unsure of the implications, he couldn't be the one to broach the subject. He played dumb, nodding quickly.

"I came this time to ask the Nine Mounds Daoist Tradition to help me neutralize the Buddhist cultivator's methods within it. I can provide equivalent items to cover the spiritual resources... Once this Blazing Fire is purified... I was hoping to trade it within the Immortal Dao for a wisp of Li Fire..."

His gaze was pleading. "My family is small. It would take me ages just to gather the materials, never mind the painstaking effort to unravel the technique. It could take decades. Nine Mounds is a great and noble sect... and an expert in this Dao..."

Yuandao listened, then lifted his cup.

"Very well," he said softly. "But I cannot guarantee the quality of the Li Fire."

Li Ximing blinked, stunned. He realized Yuandao wasn't particularly interested in the fire itself; he was simply doing him a favor. He agreed immediately. Yuandao flipped his hand, storing the pearl, and said calmly,

"Wait on the lake. This will take time. Daoist Master Lingdu will contact you when it is done."

Li Ximing breathed an inward sigh of relief. He'd already been delayed long enough, and Daoist Master Yuandao showed no sign of wishing to chat. He called Li Que'wan up, gave her some quiet instructions, and then tactfully excused himself.

Li Que'wan wasn't surprised. She had assumed when they arrived at Nine Mounds that her Daoist Master was finding her a place of sanctuary. She properly thanked both Daoist Masters and obediently withdrew.

In moments, only Yuandao and Lingdu remained on the peak. The master of Nine Mounds, he of the perfected divine ability, showed a rare trace of approval.

"That girl's Dao-Profundity is remarkable. I see she also practices shamanic arts. Qiushui was at a similar level back in her day... Not bad at all."

He was speaking of Li Que'wan. Lingdu looked surprised, as if he'd seldom heard Yuandao offer such high praise.

"I think it's a pity... We already have one Qiushui."

Daoist Master Yuandao smiled and shook his head.

"No, you should say it is _fortunate_ we already have Qiushui. That girl is no longer young, and is only just now seeking her divine ability. If not for that, given how intent the lord of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition is on securing the Whole Pill, she would have been crushed. Remember Great Daoist Master Miaoqi from the Western Sea? She had neither the destiny nor the desire to attain the Dao, but simply because she glimpsed the Purple Mystery, she lost her life-mandate."

"From what I see of the Li family, besides Li Zhouwei—the one descended from Bright Yang—only this girl's talent is noteworthy. Senior Xuan'an allowed her to cultivate the Whole Pill because he calculated it was already too late for her to interfere with Qiushui. She might even be able to ride Qiushui's coattails, so to speak, and align with the Golden Oneness of Highest Azure faction."

A thoughtful look crept over Lingdu's face as he understood.

"Which is why she is still... just a girl."

Daoist Master Yuandao smiled but didn't reply, taking a sip of tea.

"He likely knows about Tu Longjian. He's sensible, so he didn't ask, but I'm sure he's guessed most of it."

Lingdu lowered his gaze.

"After you helped him so much... how could he not?"

Yuandao rose, clasping his hands behind his back.

"Master left Nine Mounds in my care. I often worry I do too little, or that I do too much. This stems from the Fox-kin's arrangements, a remnant of the Immortal Mansion. Our relationship should be close. If the world's situation weren't so tense, we should have warmly received his disciples and helped him sort out his Dao Lineage."

His deep eyes gazed into the distance.

"Now, add to that the debt we owe Tu Longjian, of course we must help. I shouldn't have hinted, but Bright Yang descendants are a suspicious lot. Without a reason, he'd refuse the aid. We just can never speak Tu Longjian's name. We'll repay the favor this way, and keep him from being dragged too deep into the Bright Yang conflict..."

Lingdu looked both worried and resigned. He quickly rose and stood beside him.

"But... when the Bright Yang matter concludes and Donghua Heaven falls, Senior Xuan'an's situation will be... difficult. That Li Que'wan... will you... shield her?"

Yuandao tapped the table lightly.

"If I succeed, and Senior Xuan'an comes to an agreement with the lord of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, protecting her shouldn't be a problem."

Lingdu exhaled slowly.

"I see... In any case, Junjian will find it hard to do nothing. And... there is the _other one_ on the mountain."

Lingdu's "in any case" was a euphemism for what would happen if Yuandao _failed_. Such words were taboo. But Yuandao understood.

The normally placid Great Daoist Master looked troubled.

"No one in this world is without sin," he said softly. "We are all born indebted. Tu Longjian is righteous by nature; he wants me to fail no one, which is not good. It was fine when his cultivation was low. But now he's a significant figure, and he still clings to that pure heart. I'm afraid he will shatter his own Dao."

Lingdu was silent for a long time. "Whether it shatters or fulfills... it's impossible to say."




# Chapter 1064: Heretical Worship of the Layered Mountains

A light breeze drifted across the island. The sun was scorching, bleaching the reefs bone-white. A man in white robes stood silently within the clouds by the shore, appearing perfectly calm.

An Siwei was old. After his father, An Zheyan, died, he became the most senior elder of the An clan. When the Way of Great Desire swept south, An Xuanxin and countless core members and supporters of the An family were annihilated. While it wasn't a crippling blow to the Li family, for An Siwei, it was a thunderbolt from a clear sky.

The blow had struck him heavily. The letter An Xuantong sent from the lake was a long, heavy scroll. An Siwei read it with tears streaming down his face, clutching the scroll and wringing his hands in despair. He had to stop and start three times just to finish it, and even then, he had no idea how to reply.

'To think we would suffer such a calamity!'

He was filled with a boundless terror. He understood clearly that while the An clan's position still seemed stable, An Xuantong had no sons. Within the next century, the An clan would have no one capable left to rely on. The conflict between north and south was only intensifying. If their luck ran out and An Xuantong fell, the An clan would become the next Tian clan!

A cultivator's appearance was linked to their lifespan, but it was even more connected to their will. With his will now exhausted, this loyal Guest Retainer of the An family suddenly aged decades. He looked like a truly old man, standing numbly by the sea. Despite it all, a desperate hope began to stir in his heart:

'I may be old and useless, but I do not cling to my life-mandate. Could I... could I beg the Old Master to send me to the riverbank? Perhaps I could trade my life for Xuantong's...'

He had privately discussed this idea with his children. An Xuantong had vehemently opposed it, vowing to avenge his brothers' blood-debt, just as An Siwei himself had done all those years ago. But An Siwei was a man who had lived through it. He understood in his heart that this vengeance was impossible. Not in a hundred lifetimes, not in a thousand.

This sent him into a daze, and he unexpectedly thought of his father. 'When my younger brother died, did Father ever consider what I'm considering? ... Probably not. In his heart, there was only one son, only Jingming. It was the name he cried out before he died. The rest of us were just... offspring he sired to fulfill a will.'

The crushing weight of clan and family affairs pressed down on him, leaving him standing there, lost and unsure of what to do.

He waited by the shore for some time. Suddenly, he saw the waves churn, as if some massive, dark object was moving beneath the surface. His thoughts scattered instantly. He became alert and gripped a talisman tightly in his hand.

'What Demon beast... dares to approach Deer Weeds Island?'

Deer Weeds Island was guarded by a Purple Mansion Realm expert, so there was no need to fear an attack. Furthermore, the Li family was on close terms with the Dragon-kin. An Siwei merely suspected some Demon beast had recklessly wandered too close. But then, the water splashed, and a figure in white leaped out.

It was a man wearing a short, sea-green silk jacket, draped in a fine brocade cloak. Faint, azure scales were just visible on his neck. His cultivation base was incredibly dense, emanating a suffocating pressure.

Behind him, the water rippled. The Demon beast from the depths rose, carrying an enormous, azure palace-sedan. It was dotted with gold and jade, a seven-storied pavilion with six grand halls, adorned with pearl tassels. It rose from the water like a high platform. The sight terrified An Siwei, and he immediately dropped to his knees.

To command such power in the sea... who else could it be but the Dragon-kin! Having spent many years in the Eastern Sea, he knew exactly how domineering the Dragon-kin were.

But the man's expression was polite. He took a step forward and bowed from outside the island's grand defensive array. "Are you of the Li clan?" he asked respectfully. "Please inform your master that the Xu Water Demon King is here to visit."

An Siwei was alarmed. He quickly sent someone ahead with detailed instructions to report to Liu Changdie, while he himself waited humbly to the side. Stealing a terrified glance, he asked with extreme caution:

"Could it be... Lord Ying?"

The brocade-clothed youth lowered his gaze, a flicker of gratitude in his eyes. He nodded. "It is I... Are you an old acquaintance from the great river?"

An Siwei's heart settled somewhat. "My Lord, do you remember the Floating Cloud Cave?" he asked quickly. "When King Wei was campaigning in the north, I was serving under his command..."

'He's King Wei already...'

An Siwei didn't need to explain the title. The moment he heard 'King Wei', Ying Hebai understood completely. His heart burned with emotion, and he was momentarily at a loss.

'He saved my entire clan! How can I ever repay such a debt!'

Back then, the situation on the mainland had changed drastically. Ying Hebai hadn't dared to stay, retreating in a hurry. Although he saved his own life, he had abandoned his post without orders, which was a grave dereliction of duty. It angered his direct superior, and his life had been difficult ever since.

Since returning from the mainland, his clan's fortunes had taken a sharp downturn. The Xu Water Demon King had attended the divine ability banquet of the Dragon King of Crimson Reef Island. At the feast, his own aunt had been reckless and offended the White Wave Demon King. Although the Xu Water Demon King managed to protect her, she lost favor. After that, the missions Ying Hebai received grew increasingly dangerous. His clan's status plummeted, and they faced the threat of annihilation.

Fortunately, this King Wei had mentioned him to Dragon King Beihai. His superior's superior had personally spoken on his behalf. Even that White Wave Demon King came to apologize, giving immense face to the Xu Water Demon King...

'With a single word, he saved my clan's lives and honor!'

Perhaps years ago, Ying Hebai had only been respectful to him because of Dingjiao. Now, he was utterly and truly convinced of the man's power.

'I fear that even Dragon King Beihai must give weight to this King Wei's wishes, to say nothing of the Xu Water Demon King. My promotion today, placing me here as the King's vanguard... it's a gesture to the Li family, and it's also the Xu Water Demon King's way of showing loyalty to Beihai Sea...'

He smoothed his brow, composed his expression, and waited quietly. Only a breath passed before a man stepped out of the void, his body gleaming with the silver light of a divine ability. He bowed low and said hurriedly:

"This humble cultivator, Yuanbian, greets the Great King!"

Liu Changdie had only heard that the Dragon-kin were visiting, but he largely understood. Li Ximing was so pressed for time he hadn't even been able to meet, rushing off with Li Que'wan. He must be desperate to secure relations with the Dragon-kin so he can hurry back to the mainland... It made Liu Changdie feel a pang of empathy.

'In the end, the Wei-Li position is a heavy burden. He doesn't dare linger anywhere for long...'

Only then did he see a man in ink-black armor descend from the pavilion. He wore a helmet that obscured his face, and a longbow was strapped to his back. He strode forward, his voice deep and powerful:

"I am Lu Xu. I have come to this island on orders. My apologies for the disturbance."

"Not at all..."

Liu Changdie led him inward. The two did not enter the cave dwelling, but instead sat in the island's courtyard. The Demon King's expression was calm as he said faintly,

"I have long heard of your reputation."

As those words registered, Liu Changdie realized this visit wasn't just about Fuxun. He grew vigilant, though his words remained humble.

"I never imagined my meager reputation would have reached your esteemed ears!"

The Xu Water Demon King raised his tea directly.

"I am a coarse creature, unused to your human pleasantries. I won't waste time weaving words. There is a Great Daoist Master named Changxiao. He wanted to kill you. It was our Thunder Maiden of Profound Pool who saved you. If not for her, you would already be dead."

The suspicion in Liu Changdie's heart was instantly confirmed. He shot up from his seat, bowing low in a profound show of gratitude. "Yuanbian has long sensed... I am deeply indebted to this great lady..."

Lu Xu's expression remained stern.

"While it was a turn of cosmic fateand Her Highness the Profound Maiden, who watches over the Qunyi Archipelago, did not wish to see one favored by the Heaven-Governing fall-it was also because the Thunder Maiden shares a karmic affinity with you..."

Liu Changdie was stunned. "This... Profound Maiden...?" he asked, confused.

Lu Xu reacted as if he'd been stung. His calm expression vanished, replaced by alarm.

"Is 'Profound Maiden' a name you can use so casually?" he hissed. "There is only one Profound Maiden in all the heavens, the Maiden of the Profound Valley! The one you cultivators call the True Monarch of Wondrous Transformation, the Nine Heavens Matriarch of the Profound Valley!"

Liu Changdie finally understood. The 'Profound Maiden' Lu Xu meant was the Valley Water Matriarch. It was true; cultivators did usually call her 'Matriarch'. A cold sweat broke out on his back. He had been rattled by the phrase 'favored by the Heaven-Governing,' which had exposed his deepest secret. He was flustered and, unable to control himself, quickly slapped his own face several times in apology. He tried to cover his panic with a question.

"I didn't know... this Thunder Maiden..."

''Favored by the Heaven-Governing'... the Valley Water Matriarch... Could it be that that person of the Heaven-Governing knew her? But... hasn't the Matriarch ceased to manifest in the world for ages...'

His mind raced as he continued to apologize. The Xu Water Demon King's expression finally softened.

He continued, "When she was human, her mortal name was Li Qinghong."

Liu Changdie was struck by a sudden, total understanding. All his past questions seemed to answer themselves at once. A wave of sorrow washed over him, leaving him speechless. Lu Xu watched him quietly.

"You are to guard this island. Stop running all over the place. If you wander off to the mainland or some other sea and get yourself killed, we won't be able to do a thing about it."

His gaze was intense, as if trying to discern if his words had taken root. Liu Changdie sighed, tears welling in his eyes.

'So it was a favor from the Li family all along... In that case, guarding this island is no different than returning to my post as a Guest Retainer for the Li clan. The karmic affinities of this world... they are truly wondrous!'

The Xu Water Demon King then gave an order.

"Bring that Demon beast up."

Liu Changdie hurriedly excused himself. A moment later, the white-robed, red-eyed youth rushed into the hall and kowtowed deeply.

"Greetings, My Lord!"

As he bowed, a pale yellow light began to flow, unnoticed by the trio. The eyes on the back of Fuxun's head opened once more, their milky pupils staring blankly at the sky.

The Xu Water Demon King, completely unaware, looked him over with curiosity, praising him internally.

'An auspicious beast! How rare! After this Bright Yang affair is concluded, perhaps the Dragon King will have a use for him... But for now, I must hide him well. Can't let the other Kings see him, or they'll fight over him and ruin our important plans.'

He adopted a formal posture.

"Since King Wei himself made the request, you will naturally be put to good use. Where do you wish to be stationed?"

The eyes on the back of Fuxun's head swiveled, his lips moving as if in silent discussion. A low voice whispered,

'Dongfang Weixi... and Zhongli Bailu... must not see us. The Qunyi Archipelago is good... the World's Navel is also good. In this place... assuming the posture of receiving the Valley... They will not see clearly.'

Tears were already streaming down Fuxun's face.

"I have no one to rely on, only this one brother," he choked out. "I wish to be stationed somewhat close to Daoist Master Yuanbian..."

Lu Xu had anticipated this. His main concern was preventing Fuxun from wandering and attracting the attention of other Dragon Kings. He smiled.

"Between this archipelago and the World's Navel, there is a place called Danping Reef. I can assign you to guard it, but you must not leave your post without reason. If you delay the Lord's business, you will not be spared!"

Fuxun was overjoyed and nodded repeatedly. The Xu Water Demon King helped him up, then turned to Ying Hebai.

"From now on, I order you to patrol the seas in this area. Bring all your clansmen here. If King Wei has any instructions, go directly to the palace and find Dragon King Jiaohai!"

His own territory wasn't here; this was effectively handing Ying Hebai over to Dragon King JiaohaiDongfang Dingjiaowho was close to King Wei. The Xu Water Demon King was not an easy master to serve. Ying Hebai nodded and bowed repeatedly, ecstatic to the point of tears. He escorted the massive palace-sedan far out to sea before riding the wind back, making a point to find An Siwei.

The scales on the Demon beast's neck flexed. His face was streaked with crystalline tears that clanged against his armor as they fell. On that empty beach, he bowed low.

"Please," he cried, "report to King Wei. This kindness is impossible to repay! Even if one day he demands my heart and lungs, demands my very life-mandate, I, Hebai, will offer it gladly!"

## Southern Borderlands

The sky was thick with dark clouds, and a massive, blue-purple banner snapped in the chaotic wind. Far below, at the foot of the mountain, ant-like columns of barbarians were visible, tied together with ropes and led along like cattle.

On the mountaintop, a golden-eyed man stood with his hands clasped behind him, his cloak billowing in the wind. The purple sigil between his brows pulsed with a faint light, as if breathing. His golden eyes overflowed with contemplation.

'So, this is a divine ability.'

He raised his hand. A brilliant, emerald flame ignited on his fingertip, causing the surrounding Great Void to ripple. As the True Qi fire flickered, it even seemed to carry a trace of the aura of Immeasurable Water and Fire.

This flame penetrated his body, tracing a path down into his sea of qi, illuminating everything within it. It was like a draught of sweet dew descending upon his immortal foundation, continuously nourishing his Audience with the Celestial Gate. It allowed him to faintly resonate with the Great Void, preparing him for the future Purple Mansion Realm.

Li Jiangxia mused to himself:

'Jiangliang mentioned the Golden Lotus Seat, but I think its overrated... At best, it's just a sattva. This 'Holder of the Profound' power is tied to authority and position. I wonder if it's a boon from his founding noble title, or an amplification from being head of all officials... It's a notch higher than mine.'

But none of that truly mattered. What Li Jiangxia valued was the advancement of his own divine ability. Authority and position were granted by others; how could they compare to the freedom of one's own power?

'My Bright Yang cultivation is far smoother than his Li Fire. With this 'Holder of the Profound' amplification... I believe I can probe for my own divine ability within ten years...'

As he was considering this, An Xuantong hurried up the mountain. He, too, was now clad in armor, looking majestic and imposing. The shadow of his brothers' deaths had not yet lifted from his brow, yet he seemed to have found new hope for vengeance in the miracle of Li Jiangxia's sudden advancement. He appeared fiercely ambitious as he bowed.

"All the cultivators from the petty kingdoms have been bound," he reported. "We have rounded up all their forces. My Lord... how should we dispose of them?"

A thoughtful expression crossed Li Jiangxia's face.

Once this place was pacified, it was destined to become a cultivator's fief. Before he left, Li Jiangliang had mentioned that, given Yang Zhuo's way of doing things, this territory would almost certainly be granted to him. Li Jiangxia narrowed his eyes, as if recalling something.

'Heretical worship of the Layered Mountains, bound and brought to Wei.'

He paced a step.

"This is the seventh kingdom," he murmured. "There aren't many cultivators left here. Bind all these shamans and transport them to the capital. Let the Emperor decide their fate... As for their people..."

The golden-eyed youth's expression grew chillingly remote.

"When I departed," he replied, "the Emperor gave a command: 'The light of Tianwu does not shine on barbarian tribes. Those of Baiji, Jiaozhi, and the Piaoren are of lowly, slave-like stock. They delight in transgression and are ignorant of grace. Their tribes are to be exterminated and replaced with our own people.'"

Before and after Yang Zhuo became emperor, he had not engaged in slaughter, always treating the populace with benevolence. But clearly, his definition of 'populace' had its borders. His words carried a bone-deep chill. Li Jiangxia lowered his gaze to the ant-like masses at the foot of the mountain.

"The true edict is before us; it cannot be defied. Pass on my order: All barbarians are to be branded on the face and driven as slaves to build the Emperor's new palace. The women are to be taken back to the capital as handmaidens."

The Li family had always cherished the common people, treating even the Eastern Yue under their rule with leniency. An Xuantong was visibly uncomfortable with such a command, but the emperor's order was absolute. He could only withdraw, filled with apprehension.

Li Jiangxia seemed completely unaffected. He stood quietly for a moment before the sound of hurried footsteps approached. A messenger rushed up the mountain, fell to his knees, and said urgently:

"Urgent report, General! The Grand General has reached the Wilderness and is preparing to attack Sanjiang!"




# Chapter 1065: Overlook

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Heavenly Light drifted through the mountains, where white flowers tumbled like waves. Li Ximing sat peacefully atop the summit, his aura stable. He held a secret letter, lost in silent contemplation.

'So, Fuxun... has actually established a cave in the sea.'

Li Ximing put the letter away, his gaze lowered as he mulled it over.

'Both Ying Hebai and the Xu Water Demon King came back then... But just looking at them, it was hard to tell if they truly understood the mysteries involved. Thankfully, Que'Wan has already left. Otherwise, according to Senior Liu's letter, Fuxun might have returned for a visit. The Wave-Suppressing Mansion is no place for secluded cultivation.'

After returning from the Nine Mounds, Li Ximing had naturally gone straight to Chongzhou. That Cui Changfu was now utterly deferential, constantly at his side. The moment Li Ximing stated his purpose, the Daoist Master immediately plunged into the sea to find Huiyao. Clearly, the Cui clan's entire attitude had been turned upside down.

Li Ximing was no stranger to this place; he had been a dignified Purple Mansion Realm expert back then, too. The only thing that could make the Cui clan so terrified was, of course, the visit from Li Zhouwei.

'Minghuang paid a visit, and that very night, Cui Changfu achieved his divine ability. The Cui clan was clearly terrified. Cui Changfu is actually older than I am, another dignified Purple Mansion Realm expert, yet he actually called himself "junior".'

Huiyao, that minor Demon, had been promoted time and again thanks to his connection to the Li family. He held nothing back, not daring to show the slightest neglect, which made the trip quite smooth. If there was one regret... it was only that Cui Jueyin was already in seclusion, and they had been unable to meet.

The Dragon-kin had not been slow to act. When Li Ximing returned to the lake from Chongzhou two years ago, he had already received Liu Changdie's reply. The letter also mentioned that the Wave-Suppressing Mansion had been protected by the Dragon-kin back then, for which Liu Changdie was eternally grateful.

The letter had given Li Ximing quite a fright. Only then did he understand that when Changxiao had hatched his plot, it was his own aunt who had intervened. But Liu Changdie hadn't fully believed the Xu Water Demon King's words, and neither did Li Ximing. He sneered internally:

'Back then, Aunt clearly said she wouldn't interfere. She wouldn't even see me when I fled to the Lie Sea. Those words must have been false. Perhaps it was for Minghuang's sake, or perhaps someone was making a move behind Liu Changdie's back. It certainly wasn't out of any personal sentiment.'

Now, intelligence from the sea was streaming in. He heard Fuxun had established a small Demon Cave on that island and sent out subordinates to gather news. The word was his injuries still hadn't healed, and he was searching for some Lesser Yang cultivator to heal him.

Liu Changdie was truly a loyal man; he was still writing back and forth to ask about this on Fuxun's behalf. Li Ximing, naturally, played dumb. It wasn't that he was heartless—he truly didn't have the guts to get involved. He only offered Liu Changdie a tactful reminder as he picked up his brush:

'The Demon King is now under the command of the Dragon-kin and cannot act rashly. You two should meet less often. If you absolutely must see him, Senior, please go to his island... It's better to avoid giving people grounds for gossip.'

Liu Changdie had reached the Purple Mansion Realm all on his own; he was a smart man. A hint was all he needed. He would naturally find a way to justify his actions.

He set the letter down. Beside him, Guo Nanwu looked over with a smile. Li Ximing flicked his sleeve, and a white jade bottle appeared on the table. He nodded to Guo Nanwu and chuckled.

"These pills for your Lesser Yang Dao were surprisingly difficult to refine. I suspect it's because the Lesser Yang begets yin, and the furnace possesses the Valley Visage. When yin and the Visage combine, they birth dampness and cold... Fortunately, the difficulty wasn't too high. I managed to get seven pills from one batch."

Guo Nanwu's heart sank at the first half of the sentence, but by the time Li Ximing finished, his face was wreathed in smiles. He praised:

"Senior's Dao-Profundity is astounding, and your alchemy skills are superb! We juniors are endlessly impressed!"

Li Ximing never thought he'd see the day his own Dao-Profundity was being flattered. He hastily swallowed his amusement. Seeing Guo Nanwu about to pay for the pills, he simply waved his hand in refusal.

He had successfully refined several batches of pills in the last two years, but the most important was the Sima Family's batch of Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder. He had secretly held back another two pills and hidden them carefully, intending them for Li Zhouwei.

When he returned from overseas, his cultivation had actually suffered somewhat because of the Yan Dushui incident. But he understood that his past cultivation speed during the Audience with the Celestial Gate had been a fluke, aided by the Talisman Pill and several other spirit pills. His own future cultivation path stretched out indefinitely. He just took a few pills from his own reserves to tide himself over, unwilling to use the precious Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder.

Guo Nanwu was indeed short on funds and accepted with gratitude. Li Ximing raised his cup, his eyes on the pills. He suddenly remembered that the man right in front of him _was_ a Lesser Yang cultivator, and he instantly became vigilant.

'…Everything is connected... Guo Nanwu is very useful right now. I can't let him get dragged in by Fuxun!'

He smiled at him and asked,

"Nanwu, have you been to the Eastern Sea at all in recent years?"

Guo Nanwu gathered his green sleeves, seeming to ponder the meaning behind the words. He hesitated.

"Not often. My family's juniors go more frequently... A lot has happened there, but I've been wary of the Eastern Sea's depths and haven't had a chance to investigate... I asked Daoist Master Kuang Yu about it a few days ago, and I was thinking of going to take a look."

As he spoke, his eyes carefully observed Li Ximing's reaction. Li Ximing immediately misunderstood, suspecting this was a lure from the figures behind Fuxun. He probed:

"Eastern Sea... I don't go there often anymore. The area around Deer Weeds Island is being watched by my enemies. It's dangerous. The world is in turmoil; it's not a good time to act rashly."

Hearing this, Guo Nanwu instead felt he had received several hints. He turned his cup silently, a sudden shock running through him.

'That's right! Why would the Li family kill my relatives for no reason? Several of the Daoist Masters never believed it. The divinations must have been wrong. It seems an enemy plotted this, and Senior Zhaojing knows about it... He just can't say it openly, so he's warning me discreetly: Deer Weeds Island is off-limits.'

'If he spelled it out, I would be dragged into the struggle between the Li family and their enemies... I just need to play dumb.'

He nodded gravely, even feeling a pang of guilt for his earlier suspicions.

"This junior understands!"

This complete failure to communicate had an unexpected effect. Li Ximing was delighted, thinking he had understood the hint immediately.

'So perceptive, so obedient... What a pity he isn't one of my family's juniors... A true pity...'

Guo Nanwu was sharp-witted and understood the bigger picture. Li Ximing had always been pleased with him and felt a growing appreciation for his talent. He listened as Guo Nanwu asked:

"Senior Zhaojing, what's the situation in the Wilderness now?"

Li Ximing gave a bitter smile internally, shaking his head with a sigh.

"It's hard to say... I've heard even Protector-General Liu has arrived in the Wilderness. With such a major mobilization, it's impossible for the north not to know. A conflict between the two sides is imminent. There really won't be many peaceful years left!"

Only because Yang Ruiyi himself had personally seen Li Zhouwei's injuries did the great general still show some leniency toward the Li clan and refrain from issuing a direct summons. But Li Ximing estimated he wouldn't be able to stay out of it. And the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument was still hanging in the inner formation to assist Li Jiangqian, which was a real problem.

But these things couldn't be said aloud. Li Ximing chatted idly about the manpower in the Wilderness when someone hurried up the mountain and reported in a low voice:

"Daoist Master Qinghu has returned from Shu and is in a private meeting with the General... He requests your presence now, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing sighed inwardly and stood up. Guo Nanwu tactfully took his leave, stepping into the Great Void to depart. Li Ximing, however, was secretly vexed.

'He's finally back. There's not much time left; we can't delay... I asked Sima Yuanli for that Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill long ago, but he just brushed me off. Those pills are incredibly rare. He won't part with one unless I "cut off some flesh"!'

His worries didn't end there; he felt a deeper unease.

'Minghuang is in seclusion, but there are still many who want to test him. That Maha Vast Cicada is on the other side of the river, and he's definitely targeting my family. We must be prepared... Both sides are gearing up. In one or two years at most, conflict is inevitable.'

When he entered the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance two years ago, Li Zhouwei could still speak with him at length. A mere two years was definitely not enough time for him to emerge, nor was it much time to truly assail the divine ability realm. He couldn't possibly come out to help now.

'Even though I've achieved the Life Divine Ability, I must be all the more cautious. I have to help Zhouwei endure this period... Only then will we have time to breathe.'

He had considered this long ago. His gaze dropped, and with a shake of his sleeve, a golden scroll was revealed. It was obviously well-read. Amidst its profound runes, several large, colorful characters appeared:

'Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.'

---

The Wilderness.

A dull, illusory radiance shrouded the mountaintop like an impenetrable shadow, concealing all traces beneath heavy black light. Within the great hall, inky blackness surged like a dark sea.

A man sat on the high seat. Though his features were plain, his armor emanated flickers of profound light. He sat quietly for a moment before another man entered from the front of the hall.

Nourished by a countless supply of Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder over the years, the divine ability of this Daoist Master Qinghu—Sima Yuanli—shone brilliantly. He had clearly reached a peak. There was even a faint fluctuation from his Shengyang Acupoint, suggesting a failed attempt to elevate his Immortal's Foundation within the last year or two.

What divine ability expert didn't experience a few failures? Sima Yuanli felt no regret, only relief that the timing was good. It had even given him time to make a trip to Shu. Now, as he stood in the hall, Yang Ruiyi immediately looked up and questioned him:

"How did that man, Qing, reply?"

His tone was blunt. Sima Yuanli hurriedly replied:

"General Qing agreed to move out from Shu and attack the Long region... But he stubbornly refuses to withdraw his troops from near Tongmo. And... he was utterly dismissive of your subordinate's proposal to join forces."

The Song Kingdom had a good geographical position. Several mountain ranges almost completely severed the connection between Shu and Song, leaving only a few passages like the Mushroom Forest Plains and Tongmo Prefecture. Qing Jifang clearly coveted them. Yang Ruiyi's expression darkened. He restrained himself and said:

"If he won't withdraw, so be it... Let the King of Yuyang remain in the kingdom... But how are we to deal with the forces at the Mushroom Forest Plains and Guyan?"

Sima Yuanli was visibly awkward.

"General Qing... General Qing said... he wasn't quite finished with King Wei after their last encounter."

That was far more blunt. Yang Ruiyi actually laughed in anger.

"What? He wants to kill Li Ximing to provoke King Wei? On any other day, fine. But at a time like this? He's doing this just to spite my Song Court!"

Sima Yuanli secretly watched his expression, his voice lowering as his form of address changed.

"I tried to be diplomatic for a long time, but Qing Jifang only offered one condition. He said... our Great Song's 'Martial Inheritance' is too fierce, that we've absorbed all the light of Martial Cultivation. He said there are vacancies for the Holder of the Profound, but the Celestial Grace doesn't fall on Shu. He hopes we... step back... and yield one more position to them."

Yang Ruiyi threw down his vermilion brush, slamming it on the desk.

"Absolutely not!"

Rage smoldered in his eyes.

He snapped, "This was settled long ago! You collect as much light as your ability allows. The current ratio for the Holder of the Profound positions is six for Song and one for Shu. This is what our court earned through its own power. How could we possibly just give it to them!"

"If that Qing Jifang has the ability, he should expand the 'Heavenly Splendor' himself and make the Martial Cultivation Star shine brighter! Naturally, there would be more positions for him then. That would benefit both nations. What logic is there in demanding I cede our share!"

Sima Yuanli quickly bowed his head, awkwardly rephrasing the other party's words more gently:

"Qing Jifang said... the Li clan is close with the Golden Feather. They should have joined Shu along with the Golden Feather, but our Great Song snatched them up first. He says that King Wei should also belong to Shu... In that case, the balance of Martial Cultivation light should be... four for Song and three for Shu."

Yang Ruiyi laughed in exasperation. "Absurd!"

He snapped the wooden slip shut and rapped it on the desk.

"Who does Qing Jifang think he is? Everyone detests him. The Golden Feather would help him? They couldn't be happier that the Li clan came to us! If he had dared to cross the Western Mountains back then, you think Li Zhouwei wouldn't have fought him to the death? And he still dares to speak of 'investiture'!"

Sima Yuanli could only lower his head in silence. Yang Ruiyi also composed his expression, standing with his hands behind his back.

"Pay this no mind," he said in a low voice. "I doubt the Shu Emperor will let him act so recklessly. But it's inevitable that a man or two will come to make trouble, thinking to grab a bit more territory to the east..."

Sima Yuanli glanced up. "In that case, who should we leave at the lake? Should we... ask King Wei to step in?"

Yang Ruiyi shot him a look, but ultimately shook his head.

"We don't need him," he said flatly. "Just manage your own affairs. I will leave Daoist Master Tinglan behind to guard the Mushroom Forest Plains. The two posts can watch each other's backs."

Sima Yuanli's expression changed instantly. He was responsible for the assault on Shanji; without Tinglan, it was like losing an arm. He gritted his teeth. 

"But Shanji..."

Yang Ruiyi didn't answer, a thoughtful look crossing his face.

"I vaguely recall... that junior of your family... Sima Xun, is it? He's at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm by now, isn't he?"

Sima Yuanli's face paled. He looked down, deeply unsettled.

"Yes... The boy has some ability. He was summoned by the Song Emperor... He's the most promising one in the family... He was granted the rank of partial general."

Hearing the words "summoned by the Song Emperor," Yang Ruiyi's original train of thought was disrupted. He frowned, thinking,

'If that's the case, it's not my place to interfere.'

He closed his eyes for a long moment, then suddenly spoke.

"Overlook Peak's Daoist Master Xianyao has been acquainted with your Sima Family for generations. Go to Overlook Peak on my behalf and invite him to the Wilderness for a talk."

Sima Yuanli hesitated.

"His lifespan is nearly at its end..."

Yang Ruiyi narrowed his eyes. 

"That's exactly what we want."

Sima Yuanli hurried away. Only then did Yang Ruiyi put down the wooden slip in his hand and pace quietly in the great hall.

'The struggle between the Dragon-kin and the Compassion Dao in Hetian will eventually end. The Way of Compassion is unwilling to suffer too many losses at sea. This war must be fought. Even if I don't make a move, the north will...'

He seemed vexed.

'I hear the Xiangxiong Kingdom is busy firing up its mountain furnaces to refine pills... They have no time to deal with Shu. Otherwise, they would never let that man Qing get so arrogant. Every great lord is making their own plans... But how can the great tide of the world be something any single person can maneuver!'




# Chapter 1066: Protecting Ting Province

As Li Ximing entered the hall, he was met by a flow of dark light. The man at the head of the room set down his brush and strode down quickly, an eyebrow raised in a smile.

"Brother Ximing, you're here!"

The greeting was surprisingly warm. It was only then that Li Ximing remembered they were technically relatives. Clearly, this meeting wasn't with the Great General, but with his brother's wife's brother.

The Great General's features were unremarkable on their own, but this welcoming smile transformed him. He seemed less like a high commander and more like a common brother-in-law greeting a favored relative, exuding simple kindness.

Despite the other man's familiarity, Li Ximing was hesitant to reciprocate too eagerly. He simply offered a cupped-hand salute and smiled.

"Great General, you're too courteous."

Yang Ruiyi smiled, gesturing for him to sit. He produced a gleaming jade pot and poured tea.

"I've been here for some time, but it's been dreadfully busy. And with you in seclusion refining pills, we've had no chance to meet. I've invited you today to discuss the situation in the north."

"Please, General, speak your mind."

Li Ximing replied readily. Yang Ruiyi, however, seemed to hesitate, choosing his words with care.

"This northern expedition was launched under the banner of vengeance. But after so many years of turmoil between north and south, the Daoist Masters who remain... they all pale at the mere mention of the Buddhists. Their enthusiasm is low."

"King Wei is valiant and a brilliant strategist. He was the only one who could truly shoulder this burden and rally the hearts of the generals. But now, he is in seclusion and has not emerged. This has made the other cultivators even more doubtful, anxious, and hesitant. That is why I specifically asked to see you, hoping to reach him."

There was no chance Li Ximing would let him disturb Li Zhouwei. At the mere suggestion, his eyes reddened. He began to recount the grievous wounds the last great war had inflicted upon his family. Yang Ruiyi listened patiently, his expression unreadable. When Li Ximing finished, he said calmly:

"I understand the Li family's contributions. This time, I have invited you here specifically to protect Ting Province."

Li Ximing faltered, stunned. Yang Ruiyi's expression was grim.

"The Emperor has entrusted the northern front to me," he said, "and I see the situation clearly. Qi Lanyan and his cohorts are still holding back their full strength. Hot on their heels, the Vast Cicada from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm has arrived. And I am almost certain the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple has brought in forces from Mount Dayang as well."

He lowered his voice.

"The Zhao State is immensely powerful. I know this well. To be blunt, our Great Song can't even compare to the Shu lands anymore. Even with the Golden Feather contingent answering our call—though not our summons—a single Changhuai is worth more than all of Great Song."

"This northern expedition... to put it bluntly, it's just a feint to protect Wei and distribute the pressure."

His gaze locked onto Li Ximing.

"The intentions of Vast Cicada, Qi Lanyan, and Gongsun Bei are plain for all to see," he said gravely. "The only reason they haven't acted is internal disagreement. They can't gauge my strength, so they haven't been able to strike a bargain. But once those three decide to march south... I'm sure you know exactly where they will choose to make their stand."

Li Ximing let out a soft sigh.

"Ting Province."

"Precisely!"

Yang Ruiyi's expression darkened.

"A great battle is inevitable. If I make a show of launching an offensive, massing troops on this bank, it might not set the main battlefield, but it will at least pin down their primary forces. But if the court remains idle, sending only a token force to guard the river, the final battle will absolutely erupt in the Ting Province region."

"The Emperor's original decision, at the founding of the state, was to rest and recuperate. He planned to select a Holder of the Profound from three candidates to guard the north. It was I who forcefully petitioned him and set this northern expedition in motion."

His expression was intensely serious. Li Ximing was taken aback, sighing.

"Thank you, General! I had no idea you were thinking so far ahead... to protect my family's safety..."

Yang Ruiyi waved his hand, dismissing the pleasantries.

"I am speaking plainly with you today because I need you to be candid with me. We need to discuss the defenses of Ting Province. I am not here to curry favor with you!"

Yang Ruiyi had laid his cards on the table. Li Ximing, now half-convinced, adopted a solemn expression.

"Zhaojing will hold nothing back."

At this, Yang Ruiyi stood and turned to face him, his brow furrowed.

"If the worst comes to pass, can King Wei intervene?"

Li Ximing's expression was complicated. He sighed.

"To be perfectly honest... I don't believe he will."

If he had given a decisive "no," Yang Ruiyi might not have believed him. This hesitant answer, however, made the general scrutinize him. He paced two steps, his gaze hardening.

"How much longer does he need?"

Li Ximing was silent for a long moment, appearing to calculate with great difficulty.

"Perhaps... six or seven years," he finally answered.

Based on Li Zhouwei's cultivation speed, he should have perfected his immortal foundation by now and be pushing for the Shengyang Acupoint. Six or seven years wasn't an unreasonable estimate; if anything, it was conservative. But Yang Ruiyi frowned.

"We can't wait that long. Five years, at most. He must emerge, or I won't be able to hold the line."

A jolt of fear went through Li Ximing. Yang Ruiyi seemed to realize his tone had been too harsh and sighed.

"Brother Ximing, you are in a difficult position as well."

His expression grew serious again.

"With the backing of the great formation over the lake, how long do you reckon you can hold out against the Vast Cicada?"

Li Ximing asked quietly, "Just how capable is this Vast Cicada?"

Yang Ruiyi paced a few steps.

"He is comparable to Zhelu," he said softly. "He is a first-rank Maha among the Buddhist cultivators. By my calculations, he should be in his fifth reincarnation by now, and he is highly regarded by the Dharma Master. An ordinary cultivator who has just passed the mid-stage would be no match for him."

Li Ximing's heart turned to ice. An ordinary mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was roughly equivalent to a third or fourth-reincarnation Maha. One had to pass the great hurdle of the Purple Mystery to reliably suppress a sixth-reincarnation Maha. An eighth-reincarnation one... that was comparable to someone who had perfected a divine ability.

He had no illusions about his own strength. He just shook his head.

"Backed by the great formation, I can hold off a _typical_ mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for a time. But my main Spiritual Treasure is currently being used to protect the younger generation as they cultivate. To face the Vast Cicada... I am severely lacking."

Yang Ruiyi clasped his hands behind his back.

"The Daoist Masters from the Qusi branch... can they be called upon to help?"

Li Ximing knew he meant Kuang Yu and Guo Nanwu. He shook his head emphatically. At last, Yang Ruiyi sighed.

"I sent Tinglan to the Mushroom Forest Plains to assist you, which should have been sufficient. But that Qing Jifang is still lurking... How about this, I will have Sima Yuanli join you at the lake."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up, but Yang Ruiyi's expression remained grave.

"If all goes according to plan, the Vast Cicada will not remain at the lake for more than four hours. When we launch our assault on the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple, he will be forced to return. I just need you, Zhaojing, to survive his assault for those four hours."

Li Ximing's expression firmed with resolve. He listened as Yang Ruiyi continued in a low voice:

"I have only one condition. When the Vast Cicada retreats, you, Zhaojing, must immediately cross the river with the other two Daoist Masters and seize the lands of Baijiang Creek."

Hearing this, a flicker of apprehension crossed Li Ximing's face. He paused for a long time before replying,

"If the Vast Cicada has already wounded me grievously, and it becomes a matter of life and death, forgive me, but I cannot risk certain doom to press the attack."

Yang Ruiyi stared at him silently. An unknown amount of time passed before he spoke again.

"This concerns your clan's future breathing room. It also concerns our future cooperation. We will only have this one opportunity for a surprise attack. Zhaojing, you must weigh the consequences yourself."

Li Ximing simply offered a cupped-hand salute, signaling that he understood. Yet, deep inside, hesitation and doubt lingered.

'This General Yang seems to be acting entirely for the Li family's benefit... but even Yang Zhuo is lukewarm toward us. Why are we receiving such treatment? Is this northern campaign truly the singular opportunity he claims it is?'

His heart heavy, he quickly took his leave. Yang Ruiyi remained seated in the hall for a long, long time. After an unknown duration, a sliver of dark light emerged from the Great Void, drifting down to land upon his desk.

It was a black jade slip. A line of small, pale-gold characters was inscribed on its surface, radiating a potent, soaring golden qi,

'Daoist Friend Yang, I have arrived at Lake Xian.'

Yang Ruiyi stared at the jade slip for a moment before picking up his brush and writing a simple reply,

'Be patient.'

---

Li Ximing emerged from the main hall. As he expected, Sima Yuanli was still waiting outside. He gave a formal salute and sighed.

"It seems I will need to rely heavily on Qinghu's assistance in the future!"

He proceeded to relay Yang Ruiyi's arrangements. When Sima Yuanli heard the plan, he was inwardly stunned and confused.

'He's... sending me as well? Yang Ruiyi's bias toward the Li family is blatant, far greater even than that of the Song Emperor...'

Outwardly, however, he smiled and said hastily,

"We are merely working together. It is as it should be!"

Li Ximing gritted his teeth, his mind fixed on the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill.

"Might I ask Daoist Friend for a Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill?" he said in a low voice. "I believe... you have coveted this Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella for some time."

Sima Yuanli's eyes lit up. He stroked his beard, sinking into thought.

Li Ximing's Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella was only a mid-to-low grade Spiritual Artifact. Its true value lay in its excellent affinity with the Wu Earth Dao, allowing it to resist a multitude of esoteric arts. That was why Li Zhouwei had left it behind. When Sima Yuanli had given it up, he hadn't been heartbroken, but he had always recognized its unique advantages.

'Li Ximing offering the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella clearly means he wants more than just one Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill. Still, it _is_ a Spiritual Artifact. Only a family like the Li could part with one so readily...'

But for Li Ximing to offer the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, he was already at his wit's end. Sima Yuanli had shown no interest in the other items he possessed. And while he had a good supply of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, he had other, more critical uses for it and couldn't part with it.

Li Zhouwei had seized a great fortune in spiritual resources from the grotto-heaven. But with Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan both ascending to the Purple Mansion Realm, the subsequent years of cultivation expenses, and the supply of Neck Feathers from the Wave-Suppressing Mansion running dry, Li Ximing's coffers were no longer deep. Weighing his options, he couldn't bear to part with his other, more precious spiritual items. In the end, he had to choose the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, which he had already been intending to sell.

After all, his family had enough Spiritual Artifacts for their needs, and the Wu Earth affinity didn't suit his younger generation anyway. Li Zhouwei's situation, however, was urgent. Though it pained him, Li Ximing made the sacrifice.

Sima Yuanli, however, was quite pleased. He considered it carefully for a moment, then made an inviting gesture.

"And what would you like in exchange?"

The Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella had a limited value. Li Ximing didn't dare hope for something like a Whole Pill or a top-tier spiritual item. He just stated his terms:

"At least three Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pills, plus a supplementary portion of spiritual resources."

At this, Sima Yuanli frowned.

"The Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill... I truly don't have many on hand. If that's the case, I would be willing to add more spiritual resources. How about you take one pill for now, Zhaojing, just to use?"

Li Ximing's heart sank as suspicion flared.

'You sly old fox, Sima Yuanli. You're hoarding a rare commodity! You can see how desperately my family needs this pill, so you're holding back, waiting for a chance to extract an even greater price.'

He started to pull his hand back, signaling the deal was off. Sima Yuanli immediately feigned a placating smile and grabbed his arm.

"What is this? Between our two families, there's no need for such ceremony! Look, I also have a portion of Frigid Tarn Gold. I'll add that to the deal for Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing shook his head, still smiling.

"I have no use for Frigid Tarn Gold. However, I _have_ heard that Daoist Friend possesses a measure of 'Hundred-Heart Soul-Union' from a Renewing Wood. I require that item to nourish my spiritual flame."

Sima Yuanli grew pensive. He finally understood. The offer of the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella wasn't just about the pills; it was a targeted move to get this specific item from him. As for how Li Ximing had found out he possessed it... he had a good idea.

"Was this information from Senior Dingyang Zi?" he asked, his voice measured.

Li Ximing merely smiled, saying nothing.

Sima Yuanli mused for a long time, as if carefully reassessing the situation, before finally conceding.

"This item truly is of little use to me. There is no harm in letting you have it."

Li Ximing knew this man was all surface-level courtesy, but fundamentally stingy. He returned the smile, speaking cheerfully.

"It is a wonderful thing that our families are on such good terms. But we are on the eve of a great battle, and I need to use that item _first_. You can also give me one pill now, so I can experience its wonders. Once the Vast Cicada has retreated, I will hand the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella over to you."

His expression turned solemn.

"After all, the Great General specifically mentioned that you and I must cooperate fully on this matter. It is only right..."

'So that's it! I was wondering why he'd be willing to part with a Spiritual Artifact. He was waiting to spring this trap!'

Sima Yuanli looked pained, clearly reluctant. But with the "greater good" invoked, and not wanting to offend Li Zhouwei, he forced a look of magnanimity. With a grand gesture, he took out the items, stuffed them into Li Ximing's hands, and beamed.

"Daoist Friend, why stand on ceremony! Take them, take them all! As for the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, just consider it a loan from me for now!"

The man escorted him all the way back. Li Ximing offered some empty words of thanks, and as soon as he was alone, his smile vanished along with the items he'd tucked into his sleeve. He let out a long breath and descended silently toward the great formation.

Once he reached a secluded, uninhabited area, he immediately sensed the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. He ascended to that grotto-heaven, a place rich with Spiritual Qi where yin and yang were in perfect balance. He cautiously approached the courtyard, only to find that the one Li Zhouwei used was now sealed shut, preventing him from seeing anything within.

With no one to discuss Yang Ruiyi's words with, Li Ximing hesitated. Finally, he gently placed the jade bottle he was carrying at the courtyard entrance.

'I don't know if Zhouwei has begun to elevate his divine ability yet. I'll just leave this pill here. If he has, wonderful. If not, he can use it when he sees it.'

'It's just... five years is so little time.'

He agonized over it, then took a jade box from his robes. Inside was the Qi of Condescending Radiance from the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light. He also took out a brush and paper and wrote a note explaining the situation.

'I don't know what state he's in, but it's always better to be over-prepared. Just in case...'

Li Ximing finished his preparations and left the courtyard. He passed the High Firmament Pavilion and approached the profound-white immortal pavilion that served as the entrance. The door, etched with bright Profound Spiritual Patterns, was slightly ajar, allowing him to vaguely glimpse the scene within.

Incredibly, a blurry figure was sitting cross-legged inside!

But Li Ximing wasn't surprised in the slightest. Instead, a flicker of anticipation rose within him. He strode hurriedly into the pavilion and pushed the door open. On the central meditation cushion sat a man in white-gold Daoist robes.

His features were stern, his bearing exceptional, and a spot of dazzling Heavenly Light shone between his brows. Beside him sat a pill furnace, with blazing True Fire leaping inside. Billows of smoke and fiery qi gushed out, staining his robes with the fragrant aroma of alchemy.

It was another Li Ximing!

This 'Li Ximing', though motionless, had a faint aura of a divine ability flowing from his lips. His complexion was slightly more ruddy than the real Li Ximing's, and his features seemed stiffer, more wooden. A careful look revealed the clear differences.

Li Ximing paced before his other self, finally drawing the golden Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body from his sleeve. He held it open in his hands, a look of delight spreading across his face.

"Truly worthy of the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. The progress is this fast!"




# Chapter 1067: The Alternate Body

Li Ximing gave the golden scroll in his hand a slight shake, and the lines of colorful, bold characters within began to glow with a brilliant light.

This scroll was profoundly mysterious, an artifact from ancient times. Even a cultivator like Liu Changdie, a Vault Metal cultivator with a exception dao lineage, had struggled to decipher it. The scroll itself felt soft and pliant to the touch, similar in form to the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll.

The Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was primarily a technique for preserving one's life, avoiding calamities, and furthering cultivation. The first step was to master the creation of a Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

This body was forged from various treasures. The specific materials required depended on the cultivator's own divine abilities, demanding adaptability and a deep Dao-Profundity. The methods were generally divided into three tiers.

'The superior practitioner forges a body from primordial gold to pursue the Dao in a state of selfless oblivion. The middling practitioner cultivates a spirit within a prepared vessel to evade disaster and ward off evil. The inferior practitioner merely molds a clay effigy to shield a limb or preserve the body!'

The highest tier involved using an ancient spiritual object to create a duplicate body for cultivation. A lesser method was to create a proxy to act on one's behalf in the mortal world, thereby avoiding calamities. Both of these methods held infinite, wondrous power, capable of being used not only for reincarnation but even as a true out-of-body avatar.

But the method the scroll's author disdained most was using this art simply to block physical attacks.

Without a doubt, that was exactly what Li Ximing intended to do.

'The requirements for these spell arts are far too high,' he thought. 'Or perhaps ancient cultivators simply had an overabundance of resources! I don't possess materials of that quality… The only thing I can use is the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. It’s a rare item today, but in the eyes of the ancients, it was nothing special…'

The scroll referred to it as Veiled Dusk Mulberry, a type of Renewing Wood that had since devolved into a substance of Exiled Qi. After comparing the descriptions, Li Ximing confirmed it was the very same Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood in his possession—though his was just barely at the introductory grade.

Li Ximing felt no regret, only joy. Even if this made him an "inferior practitioner" in the eyes of the ancients, the prerequisite was still a Life Divine Ability. Without his World's Radiance, he couldn't even attempt this lowest tier. In today's world, this "inferior" method was a top-tier technique! Back then, even the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was considered a heterodox path of the lowest order.

Besides, with his current understanding, he could grasp the true meaning behind the middle-tier method of "evading disaster." The proxy body couldn't fool other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. It was likely used to walk the mortal world while the true self remained in the Great Void, observing from a distance. This had two benefits: it minimized entanglement with wordly affairs and helped mitigate the karmic consequences of any killing one committed, offering a greater chance of leniency when the Thunder Palace came to pass judgment.

With the Thunder Palace long since fallen, this middle-tier method was useless to Li Ximing. Only one thought occupied his mind:

'To shield a limb or preserve the body!'

He didn't have much else, but he had an abundance of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. The moment he returned from the sea, he had taken out a head-sized piece and begun cultivating the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

Li Ximing had spent the better part of the last two years on this project. The body needed to be nourished with various spiritual items and elixirs. He had accumulated a decent surplus from his years of alchemy, so he took out a few cultivation-enhancing pills from his sleeve and placed the alternate body within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance to mature.

Li Zhouwei's warning from years ago was still fresh in his mind. He placed his alchemy furnace in the same space, allowing the alchemical flames to permeate the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body to prevent any abnormalities from showing.

'After two years, it has finally reached the initial threshold. It’s time to test it...'

The more he looked at it, the more satisfied he felt. He reached into his sleeve and retrieved a box. Opening it revealed a single, thumb-sized white flower petal, shrouded in a hazy gray light.

It was the Hundred-Heart Soul-Union!

He made a light incision on the chest of the 'Li Ximing' before him, revealing a dark, beating heart within. He placed the Hundred-Heart Soul-Union in his palm, blew gently, and watched it transform into a gust of white wind that swirled into the opening.

The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body required a great deal. Even this most rudimentary version had cost Li Ximing considerable effort. Only now, with the Hundred-Heart Soul-Union integrated into the body, was it finally ready for use!

He formed a hand seal, forcing a drop of essence blood from his fingertip. He channeled the Light of the Six Harmonies into it and tapped the forehead of the seated 'Li Ximing'. The various illusory colors instantly converged and vanished. The body shrank into an exquisite, palm-sized sculpture that landed in his hand. A sweep of his spiritual sense brought a look of delight to his face.

'With the Hundred-Heart Soul-Union integrated, it’s already effective. When activated, it will transform into a clay-like shell enveloping my true body, absorbing a certain amount of damage… Its only weaknesses are fire and metal, especially Merging Fire and Geng Metal. Merging Fire's ability to damage one's essence and life force is no joke. Plus, since I used Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, it won't offer any resistance against Merging Fire—in fact, the fire might even destroy the alternate body.'

'I've heard that Vast Cicada uses a Heavenly Light pagoda and a spear of Li Fire. This should be able to withstand them. For now, I must continue to nourish it and link it with my Life Divine Ability. If the connection is strong enough, its effects will be even greater.'

The artifact's full potential depended on its master's nourishment and Dao-Profundity. When used for defense, its connection to the master's true body was paramount, requiring the involvement of a Life Divine Ability. But Li Ximing already had a plan for this:

'My World's Radiance has a specialized effect that will save me a great deal of effort.'

With a flicker, he descended from the Great Void and stepped into the grand hall situated on the lake. The golden plaque above the entrance gleamed with three large words:

Crimson Radiance Hall.

After the Bright Yang heirs went their separate ways and Li Jiangzong emerged from his seclusion, both the title and the authority of Family Head of Moongaze Lake fell into his hands. He had chosen to reside in this side hall, the Crimson Radiance Hall, as a sign of deference to the main Bright Yang lineage.

Li Jiangzong had matured considerably. After his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, his presence had grown even more imposing. Seated in the hall, he exuded an air of authority. At this moment, however, the usually respectful scion of the main lineage was seething with rage, his hands clasped behind his back as he paced, his eyes filled with disgust and hatred.

A man with graying hair, Li Zhoufang, stood to the side, looking helpless. Nearby stood a grim-faced Li Zhouda. Kneeling on the steps below was a young man, his face fixed on the floor, refusing to look up.

In a mere instant, a ray of Heavenly Light shone down, and Li Ximing's figure materialized on the main seat. The Daoist Master rested a hand on the armrest, raised an eyebrow, and asked calmly,

"What is all this?"

In an instant, the expressions of everyone present changed. They fell to their knees from where they stood and cried out in unison,


"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing lowered his gaze slightly. Li Jiangzong, his head pressed tightly to the floor, finally looked up. He now wore a beard, which gave him a steady and composed appearance. 

"Reporting to the Daoist Master... I was failing in my duty to discipline my son... I was reprimanding a junior and did not mean to disturb your immortal presence..."

"Ah, so it's Suiqing."

Li Ximing smiled. Li Zhoufang, who was kneeling at the bottom, was already drenched in a cold sweat. He risked shuffling forward a couple of steps and said respectfully,

"We dare not disturb your divine affairs, Daoist Master. This junior will take the boy to Qingdu at once!"

Li Jiangzong's heart sank. This was bad. Did they really think Li Ximing, who spent all his days in seclusion, wouldn't know who Li Suiqing was? Sure enough, Li Ximing's smile faded slightly as he turned his gaze to Li Zhouda. The man, kneeling before the dais, immediately spoke up.

"While patrolling the western shore, this subordinate received a report from the Jade Court. Young Master Suiqing's family servant, Yan Kuai, has a nephew who grew excessively close with Tian Pan, the supervisor of the White Rainbow Jade Mine on the western shore. He secretly sent various peak cultivators to purchase the jade with gold and deliver it to him, thereby monopolizing the entire output..."

"With the world in chaos and supplies scarce, any cultivator on the western shore who needs White Rainbow Jade must buy it from Yan Kuai at an exorbitant price. He has been profiting immensely from this..."

Li Ximing asked casually, "And what does the law dictate?"

Li Zhouda bowed.

"Young Master Suiqing, for colluding with a supervisor and manipulating prices, shall have his illicit gains confiscated, receive three hundred lashes from a thunder whip, and be confined to the mountain for ten years. Tian Pan will be stripped of his post and taken in for questioning. Yan Kuai and his accomplices will be executed."

But the young man on the floor gritted his teeth.

"I had the ability to buy it and the means to sell it! On what grounds do you accuse me of manipulating prices!"

A flash of alarm crossed Li Jiangzong's eyes. His face darkened as he gritted his teeth and spun around to snarl at him,

"What ability? You relied on the clan's power!"

Li Suiqing's cultivation was weak; three hundred lashes with a thunder whip was a death sentence. Clearly, though Li Jiangzong was verbally calling for his son's head, he couldn't bear to see him truly harmed, or he wouldn't have brought him to this hall for questioning.

But Li Suiqing just sneered. The boy's face showed not a trace of fear. A cruel smile cracked his lips.

"And the only reason you're standing here today—is that due to your own ability?"

The words struck like a thunderclap, an offense to countless people. Yet Li Jiangzong felt no anger at being slighted, only a bone-chilling terror that drenched him in a cold sweat. His world was crumbling.

'You... you... you ungrateful fool! You still refuse to yield? You still won't back down!'

Then, he heard a soft laugh from the main seat. The Daoist Master's smile had completely vanished, replaced by a cold amusement. He glanced at the boy with interest and said,

"Go to Qingdu and receive your punishment."

It was like an illusion. As those quiet words fell, the figure on the main seat suddenly became impossibly distant, floating ethereally at the edge of the sky. Or perhaps it was everyone else in the hall who had plunged into an abyss, falling farther and farther away from him.

In that instant, Li Suiqing's expression changed completely. The defiance in his dark eyes melted away like ice in a spring breeze. The arrogant, vicious malice vanished without a trace. He became like a docile lamb, kneeling on the floor in a state of bewilderment.

'Yes…'

He carefully shifted his knees, rose to his feet, and said respectfully, "This junior was ignorant and disturbed you, my lord."

He bowed low at the waist, facing the main seat, and began to walk backward out of the hall. At the entrance, he kowtowed three times respectfully. Only then did he turn to a nearby guard with a calm, gentle voice, much to the guard's utter astonishment.

"Please escort me."

A dead silence fell over the hall. The color drained from Li Jiangzong's face. Terror and anguish surged through him, making his nose burn and his brow freeze. He knelt there, stunned, and looked dazedly at his father.

Li Zhoufang’s forehead was pressed to the ground, and he was weeping silently.

As if waking from a nightmare, Li Jiangzong scrambled on his knees toward the main seat. His lips were white, his eyes bloodshot. He cried out, his voice trembling,

"Daoist Master... please, Daoist Master, spare him... No matter how insolent he is, he is my son... I am willing to imprison him for a lifetime... Daoist Master... I beg you... Daoist Master! I am willing to die in his place!"

Of course, Li Jiangzong wasn't worried about three hundred lashes. With his power and Li Suiqing's status as a direct descendant of the main lineage, no one would dare kill him unless the order was explicit execution. He might be crippled, but he would survive. But that single glance from Li Ximing, devoid from any leniency, was effectively a death sentence for Li Suiqing's very being.

At his words, the Light of the Six Harmonies flickering at the Daoist Master's fingertips seemed to react, pulsing with a silent warning, as if ready to leap out and devour someone at any moment. The Daoist Master slowly raised his head, his gaze sweeping over his juniors before finally locking onto Li Jiangzong's eyes.

The man who held power over the Li family's mortal affairs was covered in a cold sweat, yet he dared not break eye contact. Fortunately, the dreaded outcome did not occur. Daoist Master Zhaojing lowered his gaze, concealing the look in his eyes, and shook his head. "You misunderstand. It will resolve itself in three days."

Li Jiangzong shuffled back a step, kowtowing in confusion as he wept.

"Jiangzong thanks the Daoist Master! Jiangzong... Jiangzong has offended... Jiangzong is willing to accept any punishment!"

His words echoed in the hall, prompting a belated Li Zhouda to shut his mouth and kneel as well, unsure of what to say.

Li Ximing showed little amusement. He seemed almost bored by his junior's plea for punishment. He closed his eyes and said flatly,

"Bring me the items I requested. Then all of you, leave."

Li Jiangzong rose with a bow, turned, and took a step to a separate table. He lifted a tray of clothes, knelt respectfully to present it at the Daoist Master's side, and then hastily retreated, pulling the two large doors of the hall shut behind him.

The hall fell instantly silent. Only the gentle flicker of a spiritual lamp cast shifting shadows across Li Ximing's face. The Daoist Master didn't touch the jade tray. He sat motionless, his gaze fixed on the closed doors. After a long while, his eyes slowly shifted, hesitantly landing on the formless Light of the Six Harmonies dancing on his fingertips.

'World's Radiance…'

---

Outside the hall.

The guards had long since been dismissed. Li Jiangzong pressed his hands firmly against the hall doors, confirming that the protective arrays had activated before stepping back and kowtowing three more times.

Li Zhoufang stood silently behind his eldest son, his eyes closed, not knowing what to say. He reached out to take his hand and found it ice-cold, his knuckles white from clenching.

The sky had darkened. Father and son, without a word, supported each other down the steps of the main hall, watched by a wistful Li Zhouda. They walked for a time through the dim corridors and quickly entered a side hall.

Li Jiangzong's steps were rigid.

He noticed that only a single spiritual lamp was lit in the side hall. It stood perfectly in the center, its light not intense but enough to banish all shadows. Every corner, high and low, was clearly visible; even the patterns on the inner wall of an open teapot were sharp and distinct, making his eyes ache.

His father, Li Zhoufang, quickly closed the door. He shut his eyes, and tears streamed down his face.

"It's all my fault..." he lamented. "I never should have brought him here!"

Li Jiangzong seemed not to hear him. He stood frozen for several moments, his eyes vacant. Then, he grabbed his father's hand, squeezing it so tightly that Li Zhoufang winced in pain.

The eldest son took a long time to compose himself. He finally asked in a hesitant, low voice,

"Father, you know me best. You know me better than anyone. When you look at me... when you look at me..."

His pupils dilated, and his voice trembled.

"Do I still seem like Li Jiangzong?"

"Am I still Li Jiangzong?"

Li Jiangzong 'Pheasant Li March' [Early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm]




# Chapter 1068: All Prepared

Nurturing the spirit and cultivating truth was a crucible that consumed the days and nights.

Radiant light surged within the pavilion. Li Ximing rubbed the bridge of his nose and stood, letting out a long breath. He felt a wave of dizziness and closed his eyes, resting for just a breath or two. Only then did the vertigo subside, and he felt a measure of relief.

On a meditation cushion to the side sat another man, one who looked identical to Li Ximing in every way. His robes fluttered slightly in the ambient Spiritual Qi. His features were even more refined and handsome, and the complete lack of expression lent him an air of divinity.

This was, of course, the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

The body was no longer as stiff and lifeless as it had been in the beginning. Its skin looked warm and supple. The only difference between its face and Li Ximing's was that the alternate body's complexion was a fraction more ruddy—a distinction so subtle it was invisible to the naked eye.

Their attire, however, was slightly different. A jade pendant hung from the alternate body's waist, inscribed with three words:

'Li Gufeng.'

Li Ximing had made arrangements long ago for this creation. He had established a mountain-guardian position on his Gardenia Scenery Mountain, registered the name Li Gufeng, and had a family jade pendant and set of robes custom-made for him.

The entire purpose of a Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was to serve as an external incarnation, one capable of confounding heavenly secrets and forcing miscalculations. Normally, a person's identity could be discerned through Daoist arts. But now, with the robes draped over the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body and the identity pendant hung from its waist, Li Ximing activated the Light of the Six Harmonies.

This was the wondrous aspect of the World's Radiance. 'Li Gufeng' was now his subordinate, naturally suffused with radiant Heavenly Light and linked by divine ability. This drastically reduced the time and difficulty of nurturing it with his Life Divine Ability! The refinement process advanced by leaps and bounds.

Even though he had taken this shortcut, the all-out effort to nurture it had nearly exhausted his mind and spirit. Seeing the alternate body sitting with its eyes closed, as if deep in meditative cultivation, Li Ximing felt his heart skip a beat.

'It's just too realistic... No one will be able to tell the difference, even with a divine ability.'

At this moment, the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was finally complete.

Li Ximing was in a hurry to become a lowly cultivator, and this creation's primary function was refined for that very purpose. As long as he cut off a piece of his finger before a great battle, used an art to have 'Li Gufeng' consume it, and then linked them with his Life Divine Ability, they would share a life-mandate connection. This technique was called Sealing the Life-Mandate.

After Sealing the Life-Mandate, for a short period, twenty to forty percent of most injuries he sustained would be transferred to the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body. When facing curses, malevolent talismans, or wicked arts that interfered with the spiritual sense—such as Changxiao's treasured vase technique—it could transfer as much as sixty percent!

'In other words... if I suffer a fatal blow on the lake... it will only mean the destruction of this Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, giving me a chance to escape...'

'If I could master that Vast Profound Art for elevating Pure Qi, I might even be able to abandon my original body entirely and use the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body to flee...'

And every time he performed Sealing the Life-Mandate, whether the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was ultimately used or not, the bond between it and his main body would deepen. After hundreds or thousands of uses, supplemented by his Dao-Profundity, he might even be able to share damage without needing the ritual seal at all.

The uses for such a marvelous art didn't end there. Ancient Daoists could use these alternate bodies for all manner of deceptive ploys. While Li Ximing lacked that level of skill, he had gleaned a few insights.

'The scroll mentioned that during Sealing the Life-Mandate, one can place a spiritual item in its mouth—anything that doesn't conflict, though jade is best. This allows the consumption of the spiritual item to reduce the damage the alternate body takes.'

This was a wonderful surprise for Li Ximing!

He silently went to his cabinet and retrieved a portion of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance.

The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body would inevitably be revealed one day, so he hadn't dared use Supreme Yin Moon Radiance in its actual refinement. But as a consumable, it was perfect... He was short on many things, but he had plenty of this!

He brought two fingers to his lips, drew the moon-white treasure from its vial, and condensed it into a pill the size of a fingertip. He then closed his eyes slightly. On the cushion, the meditating 'Li Gufeng' abruptly opened its eyes.

Its sockets were empty, containing nothing, yet an unseen presence seemed to be observing the surroundings. It was quite unnerving. The body slowly parted its lips, revealing teeth as white as jade, and accepted the pill into its mouth. Its eyelids immediately drooped shut, resuming the appearance of deep meditation.

Li Ximing opened his eyes, thoroughly pleased.

"This way, it can be drawn upon at any time."

He raised his hand slightly. 'Li Gufeng' leaped up, and with a shimmer, transformed into a palm-sized wooden figurine that drifted gently into his sleeve.

He shook his sleeve, pinched his fingers to make a calculation, and realized six months had passed. The jade pendant representing Yang Ruiyi was flickering erratically. Clearly, the great event was imminent.

He descended from his elevated chamber, appearing on the mountainside. As expected, he was informed that Sima Yuanli had been waiting on the island for some time, so he invited him in.

Unlike the confident Li Ximing, this man appeared anxious and fraught with worry. He stopped hurriedly before the desk and bowed.

"Greetings, Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing returned the gesture, only to notice an elegant beauty following behind him. She wore plain white robes and held a casket. Wisps of cold clouds floated about her, circling like silver sparrows. It was Fairy Qiuhu, Ning Wan.

Yang Ruiyi hadn't ordered Ning Wan to come to the island to set up defenses. Li Ximing paused for a moment, then offered a greeting. Ning Wan smiled and nodded at him, setting down the jade casket she held.

"Greetings, Zhaojing," she said softly. "Congratulations on achieving your divine ability. I've brought something for you."

She lifted the lid, revealing a radiant red jade pearl inside. It was crystalline and translucent, covered by only a thin layer of crystal. Trapped within was a small, exquisite beast, its body curled and back arched, filling the pearl completely.

"This is a Prosperous Dragon Pearl. It's a special protective talisman from the cultivators of Great Liang. Inside is an Unfettered Xuan-Ox. It is extremely potent."

Ning Wan used a divine ability to reseal the box, her expression grave.

"The old Daoist Master Diyan of Mount Qusi asked me to deliver it... He heard this junior's concerns, about the great battle on the lake and how King Wei has not emerged from seclusion... He specifically had me bring this as a token of his support."

The woman seemed to hesitant, pausing before adding,

"This item is precious, one of the old Daoist Master's most treasured possessions. At a critical moment, it can save your life."

Li Ximing had heard his name before and knew Mount Qusi was interested in currying favor. But this gesture of concern was so substantial that he felt he couldn't possibly accept it. He was moved, and asked,

"Please thank the old gentleman for me... but how can I accept such a valuable treasure?"

Ning Wan shook her head.

"The old Daoist Master asked me to relay a message to you... He said... Thank you, Zhaojing, for protecting Nanwu from his enemies and preventing the Guo family from getting involved..."

Li Ximing froze, frowning.

"The matter in the Eastern Sea?"

Ning Wan seemed to sense the sensitivity of the topic and quietly cut it short.

"That is something I do not know, nor should I."

Li Ximing immediately fell silent, thinking to himself,

'I understand. The old Daoist Master is arranging his affairs, but he doesn't want to stir up trouble, so he's been dragging it out. I genuinely need this item right now. I'll have to lay my cards on the table and speak with him after this is over.'

Ning Wan, however, showed no change in expression. First Suiguan, then Emperor Song—this woman seemed accustomed to surviving in the cracks between great powers. She gave a curtsey and quickly excused herself.

Sima Yuanli, meanwhile, was full of envy.

"Ximing, you truly have good fortune!"

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal response. After his exclamation, Sima Yuanli's expression turned serious.

"I have received orders from the Great General. In three days, the assembled cultivators will attack the Zhao. All cultivators have been given their orders, and they have even requested a Daoist Master from Overlook Peak to take action!"

"Vast Cicada hails from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and has always coveted the south. Once the battle begins, he certainly won't reinforce Profound Governance. Instead, he'll lead his men south. You and I just need to lie in wait for him."

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully, but Sima Yuanli was lost in his own worries.

'Could this be even more serious than I imagined? Even Li Ximing has to seek external help like this, so what about me? I might very well be killed.'

He solemnly set down his cup, studied the other man's expression, and said,

"Zhaojing... on this lake, you and I prosper together and fall together. Since you now have such a powerful protective talisman, why not entrust the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella to me in advance? Once the fighting starts, I will stake my life on protecting the lake!"

With Sima Yuanli having put it so bluntly, Li Ximing had little room to maneuver. He pondered for a long moment before finally nodding slowly with a sigh.

"Then I shall rely on you, Daoist Friend."

He retrieved the Spiritual Artifact from his sleeve and, under Sima Yuanli's eager gaze, transferred ownership to him. The green-robed man nodded, immediately turning the spiritual umbrella over and over to study it.

Li Ximing rose silently and gazed toward the north.

'Yang Ruiyi gave me five years. How exactly did he calculate that timeframe? This battle will be different. Times have changed. Even if he is a member of the Yang family, I doubt he can afford to return with nothing to show for it.'

...

Baijiang Creek.

In just a few short years, the area had become covered in temples. Inside a magnificent, golden-tiled hall, radiant light flowed like clear water. Rows of monks knelt below a high seat, upon which sat a monk with a fair, clean-shaven face and a touch of gold lacquer at his brow. He was as serene as a statue.

Perched on a roof beam, however, sat a young man. His features were otherworldly, but his eyes shone with a brilliant divine light as he gazed into the distance. Countless complex scenes reflected in his pupils, fleeting past like flowing water.

After an unknown amount of time, the monk on the main seat finally spoke, his voice melodious.

"Jiexing, what do you see?"

The young man lowered his gaze, retracting his divine ability. He leaped down, offered a deep bow, and said,

"Cousin, I didn't see anyone coming or going. There was only a Lesser Yang cultivator who passed through the Great Void. He shouldn't be involved in this."

The expression of the monk he called 'cousin' flickered.

"You're exactly as you were when we were children. I have entered the Buddhist Path. I am Vast Cicada now, not Li Jieyi. It is improper to call me cousin."

Tao Jiexing blinked his shining eyes and quickly apologized.

"I've been cultivating with my master in the mountains. I haven't visited the mortal realm often. Please don't be offended, cousin..."

Vast Cicada stared, then sighed and dropped the subject.

"Truly incredible. Your divine ability is concentrated entirely in your eyes; no wonder people call it an Eye Divine Ability. You have only just cultivated it, yet it's already this powerful. If Old Master Tao were to use it himself, I cannot imagine how formidable it would be."

"The person you saw must have been Guo Nanwu. He should be leaving as well... What else did you see?"

Tao Jiexing spoke bluntly.

"The distant lands seem to be blocked by something; I can't see clearly. But the people on the riverbank are living well, much more comfortably than the people in the north. Master says 'an army must have a just cause, to relieve the people's suffering and punish the wicked.' This war should not be fought."

The young man truly seemed to be a mountain recluse, his words direct and his expression earnest. Vast Cicada's face tightened as he listened.

"Whether it should be fought is not for us to decide," he said in a low voice. "You just follow me."

Tao Jiexing could only reply, "Yes!"

The monk sat on his high seat, lost in thought. His own Li clan was just across the river, yet his expression held no joy, only a heavy inscrutability. He looked at Tao Jiexing.

"Jiexing... tell me... are there truly people in this world who can know the future and calculate heavenly secrets?"

Tao Jiexing was taken aback.

"What's so difficult about that? I know a bit about calculation arts. I can try a divination, it's no trouble."

Vast Cicada gave him a flat look.

"Calculate the fate of this river. Calculate the outcome of this war between north and south."

"Absolutely impossible!"

Tao Jiexing flicked his sleeve, offering no polite mitigation.

"Cousin, you cultivate the Buddhist path now, not calculation arts; you focus on refining artifacts. You don't understand this Dao. But this is something one shouldn't even consider. This place is overflowing with Purple Mansion Realm experts and Mahas. Forget calculation—even the ambient qi is in constant, violent flux. Furthermore, there are quite a few Purple Mansion Realm masters who have achieved the Life Divine Ability. In divination, such people register as voids... Trying to calculate the changes here is like asking an illiterate child to read the Daoist Classics. Even if you got a result, you couldn't trust it."

The more Vast Cicada listened, the deeper his frown became.

"Is that true? Not even if Duanmu Kui came?"

Tao Jiexing didn't hesitate.

"Cousin, you're overthinking it. This has nothing to do with Dao-Profundity. 'The cleverest housewife can't cook without rice.' Even if Lord Xue himself came, he couldn't do it! To say nothing of the Martial Cultivation Star hanging overhead, with all the various Fruition Attainments shifting and intersecting. Begging your pardon, but even those great figures would have trouble getting a clear reading!"

Vast Cicada said no more, his brow furrowed in thought.

'Strange... From what I can tell of Qi Lanyan's intentions, he clearly knew a great battle was coming. Otherwise, he wouldn't have mobilized so frequently, and he wouldn't have sent Tao Jiexing down... He was able to promise Old Master Tao that he would only borrow him for two months. How did he know such a specific timeframe?'

Yang Ruiyi hadn't just arrived at the river; he'd been here for over a year. The timing was impossible to predict. Vast Cicada was silent for a long time, rising to pace as suspicion grew in his heart.

'Has the Profound Governance Pavilion become too powerful? The great figures are all distracted by the Bright Yang affair, but have they considered that Profound Governance's influence is ten times stronger than it was? It's become the very pivot of the Great Zhao. The mortal world they promised us... is it still ours to take?'

But just then, a Merciful One tore through the Great Void and descended, kneeling before him and speaking urgently:

"Reporting to the Maha! Yang Ruiyi is crossing the river! Liu Bai is his general, and those two Bright Yang scions are with him... His subordinates, Ning Wan, Wenqing, and the others, have already surrounded Shanji. The Profound Governance Pavilion orders... orders My Lord to proceed directly southeast and intercept Yang Ruiyi!"

'As I expected!'

Vast Cicada shot to his feet, his eyes flashing. He no longer cared about Profound Governance. Billowing purple flames instantly erupted around him. He grasped a long spear that appeared from thin air and barked,

"Let's go!"

In an instant, the Great Void thundered open, and an enormous golden avatar materialized. Tao Jiexing hurried forward, watching his monk cousin step into the void. He froze, confused.

"Cousin, where are you going...?"

Vast Cicada's gaze was dark, but laced with a fervent heat.

"South! To attack Wei!"

The young man was baffled, but the Merciful One beside him looked deeply uneasy.

"My Lord... I fear Profound Governance will hold you accountable..."

"Accountable?"

Vast Cicada forced a cold laugh from his throat, turning his head to snarl,

"You think that Qi Lanyan doesn't know I'll go south? You think he doesn't _want_ me to go south? That bastard transferred my subordinates away long ago and stationed me right here, just a river's breadth away. He's setting me up to take the fall!"

"Whether he gave the order or not, I would have gone south for him anyway. So why not issue a different order, telling me to block Yang Ruiyi? That way, if something goes wrong, whatever scheme Yang Ruiyi pulls... if it blows up into a disaster, he can pin every last bit of it on me!"




# Chapter 1069: Precious Tusk

The lake's surface rippled. Li Ximing's gaze hardened slightly as he stared at the colorful clouds to the north. Figures, unevenly arrayed, stood upon those clouds. The purple flames that should have belonged to the Bright Yang path were tinged with pink, hanging from the cloud bank like a vast, cascading waterfall.

'Vast Cicada...'

Li Zhouwei's old armor had been left at Gardenia Scenery Mountain for reforging and repair, and he had entrusted Li Ximing with it. Li Ximing had gone to retrieve it, but unfortunately, with Li Zhouwei in seclusion, the armor refused to recognize him. Thankfully, a thorough search of the clan's vault had turned up the Demonbane Cleaver Mace and the Descending Radiance Equal Edge.

Both of these would be useful. Only the Radiant Sun King's Halberd and the Pure Yang Bracelets were items Li Zhouwei carried at all times, never letting them leave his person. They were nowhere to be found.

He stood with his hands tucked into his sleeves, appearing as steady as Mount Tai, waiting patiently. In truth, his sleeve trembled faintly. The little finger of his left hand detached at the knuckle and tumbled silently into the mouth of a small wooden carving.

Sealing the Life-Mandate!

In that exact instant, something swelled within the clouds above. Nested within the colorful layers, a temple as massive as a mountain materialized. The ancient bells of a monastery tolled. The halls were majestic and imposing, filled with seated monks in golden robes, each in a different posture. The scene was strangely reminiscent of the golden-armored, golden-robed figures from an Audience with the Celestial Gate. A golden plaque above the temple entrance displayed three large characters:

Precious Tusk Temple.

Before the temple, a lotus platform was in full, furious bloom. A young monk stood upon it. He had a smooth forehead, a sharp chin, and dark pupils. He wore simple, light-brown monastic robes, draped with a kashaya embroidered in gold. His long spear, however, stood beside him, radiating the roiling light of Li Fire.

His gaze was flat, fixed directly on Li Ximing.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing," he said. "To hear of you is not as good as seeing you in person."

When Changxiao had acted back then, he had merely toyed with him, chasing him all the way to the Eastern Sea like a cat with a mouse. That was more of a test; it didn't truly count. Excluding Changxiao, the Vast Cicada before him now was perhaps the most terrifying opponent Li Ximing had ever faced. He was of the Wei-Li bloodline, one who had cultivated the Buddhist path after the immortal path—an existence far superior to Helian Wujiang. This was a terrifying prospect, especially since Li Ximing had still possessed the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass during his battle with Helian Wujiang.

To say he wasn't nervous would be an absolute lie. Li Ximing immediately opened his hand. A patch of turquoise-yellow light pulsed in his palm, and a jade ruler leaped out—it was Sichuan.

The turquoise-yellow patterns of mountains and rivers undulated on its surface. As it fell into Vast Cicada's sight, the young monk pressed his palms together, seeming to recognize its extraordinary origin at a glance.

"A fine treasure," he murmured. "The Li Clan is truly worthy of being the Wei-Li inheritors... It seems this humble monk has not come to the wrong place."

He wasted no time. With the simple gesture of pressing his hands together, the lingering sound of a bell echoed from the sky. The temple in the clouds expanded instantly. The ground, formed of colorful mist, swelled and spread rapidly. Li Ximing suddenly found himself on a boundless platform before the temple. The scenery of the lake below vanished, and the only thing reflected in his pupils was a searing, crimson light descending from the heavens.

'So fast!'

Along with it, a slightly youthful, boyish voice echoed, seeming to linger by his ear.

"My apologies!"

That remark seemed to be directed at Sima Yuanli, who was off to the side. Li Ximing had no time to worry about that. He formed a hand seal at his chest, and his eyes suddenly blazed with light. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light erupted, surging up to resist the crimson light. His other hand vanished into his sleeve, conjuring flames.

Li Ximing had cultivated Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light for many years. While it couldn't compare to the myriad divine blessings Li Zhouwei possessed, he had at least achieved Entering the Hall. Yet, under the opponent's crimson light, his technique melted away like ice under a hot sun, disintegrating layer by layer. It barely managed to slow the crimson light's descent.

Li Ximing sensed grave danger. He realized the man on the Golden Lotus Seat had already risen, spear in hand, and vanished! His resolve was instant. He immediately activated his spiritual sense!

"BOOM!"

Dark thunderclouds suddenly appeared within the dense, colorful mist. The Demonbane Cleaver Mace materialized, and a waterfall of silver lightning crashed down, suppressing the crimson light with lightning speed.

Li Ximing immediately threw back his cuff, revealing an item. It was a deep, azure-green color, and it grew in the air as it flew, positioning itself in front of him. It was the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron!

The roiling Li Fire coiling around the spear was dazzling, but the cauldron's gaping maw sucked it all in. The golden spear tip flicked out, striking the cauldron's body perfectly.

"CLANG!"

A deafening chime echoed. The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron was flung high into the air, its mystical connection nearly severed. Li Ximing's face flushed slightly, and a clear assessment formed in his mind:

'What a terrifying spear...'

This Vast Cicada was nothing like Helian Wujiang, who had focused purely on Daoist arts. This monk's divine abilities, dharma power, and spear techniques were one. The interweaving radiance and Li Fire were an extreme threat!

But the monk merely glanced at him. In the instant the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron was knocked off-balance, he activated a profound art. He spat out a golden light, sharp as a blade, that temporarily locked the profound cauldron in place. With a thrust of his spear, he had already broken through the opening.

Li Ximing was not one to sit and wait for death. In that fraction of a second, the intangible Light of the Six Harmonies was already dancing on his fingertips. The light flickered and leaped, landing on the spear tip as he commanded:

"Emperor, suppress the wicked; Emperor, command the chariot's turn."

This invocation utilized his Life Divine Ability. The eight words emerged as a single sound, propelled by the divine ability to shake the Great Void. This was precisely the disaster-averting, difficulty-resolving power of the Light of the Six Harmonies!

In an instant, the violet-pink Li Fire on the spear balled up, transforming into a round-bellied, adorable bird. It zipped about playfully. The brilliant golden radiance flaked off, scattering into lotus flowers and glazed glass that tumbled from the sky. Even the spear's sharp tip blurred.

'It's the World's Radiance!'

Vast Cicada had not expected him to have mastered a Life Divine Ability so easily. Caught unprepared, he miscalculated. His expression shifted slightly. The hand he had held behind his back finally emerged, patting the air in front of him as if brushing something away.

But at the same moment, his advancing spear was struck by *something* heavy, knocking it an inch off course. Li Ximing flicked his sleeve, evaded the blow with ease, and, instead of retreating, advanced. His lips parted, and he spat a stream of fire!

Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire!

A torrent of Merging Fire, so bright white it seared the eyes, erupted. A faint, gray, intangible companion flame rippled outward like water, mixed with two other flames—one golden-red, one crimson. The combination radiated waves of terrifying power.

Li Ximing had borrowed the power of the Valley Wind Guide-Fire for this attack, and the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire itself had a dreadful reputation. Even Vast Cicada felt his heart pound in terror. A layer of fine, white scales bristled across his face, and he immediately opened his mouth.

Between those jade-white teeth, there was no tongue. Connecting his mouth to his throat was a long, thin, old cicada. It was entirely pale white. Its two scaled wings were pale white at the base, with pure white veins. Its pair of bright red compound eyes stared greedily at the outside world, only to realize a gush of Merging Fire was flooding in. It flapped its wings in alarm.

The movement of its wings blew out a gust of faint red, hazy wind. The red-eyed white cicada detached from his oral cavity and fluttered away, leaving his body standing frozen in place. Above his shining, bald head, a colorful cloud suddenly parted, showering him in golden light.

"BOOM!"

The body took the full brunt of the flames. Bathed in the hazy golden light, it didn't retreat a single step. Its iron-hard skin and muscles melted away, revealing a pale-golden skeleton beneath. Li Ximing sensed something was wrong and shifted his gaze, his eyes sharp with vigilance.

The distant red-eyed cicada trembled. The body dissolved like water, leaving the clinging flames with nothing to burn, rising as futile black smoke. In the distance, the red-eyed cicada transformed back into Vast Cicada. The fierce-looking young man wiped his face, his smooth white skin reappearing. His expression was one of genuine admiration.

'Worthy of the Wei descendant!'

The opponent's escape technique was truly profound, completely neutralizing the fire that had not yet burned to his bones. But how could Li Ximing idly watch during this rapid exchange? Seizing the moment of his opponent's miscalculation, he pressed his hands together at his chest. The Audience with the Celestial Gate, one no smaller than the temple in the sky, descended, pressing down firmly on the young monk's head!

Vast Cicada, however, showed no fear. He laughed loudly and shook his head.

"Daoist Friend Li, this venerable one also cultivated Bright Yang in a past life! Beneath the Audience with the Celestial Gate, the Valley Water and Dui-metal are easy to evade, but the True Purple is hard to escape!"

His confidence was not baseless! Before converting to the Buddhist path, Vast Cicada was known as Li Jieyi. He had been an immortal cultivator at the Purple Mansion Realm Mid-stage with three Bright Yang divine abilities. He had cultivated to the absolute peak of that path, only turning to the Buddhist path after hitting the immortal bottleneck!

The monk raised his palm. His left hand pressed under his right, forming a lotus mudra. His divine abilities converged as he decreed:

'Borrowed Valley Water Grandeur Art!'

In an instant, the light of Valley Water and a brilliant radiance flashed. The cumbersome Audience with the Celestial Gate had already closed, but shining beneath it was the lotus platform that Vast Cicada had seemingly left uselessly nearby!

Vast Cicada did not originally cultivate Valley Water, but this art was of a high grade, and he was extremely familiar with this particular divine ability. The lotus was an Enlightened Artifact, painstakingly refined with numerous spiritual items of the Valley Water element using Buddhist techniques. It allowed him to walk out unharmed!

The situation reversed in a heartbeat. Li Ximing was already at a disadvantage, and his divine ability had missed. The young monk's eyes had already turned golden as he sensed his Buddhist Land. The temple's main doors swung open. Li Ximing was no longer standing *before* the temple; he had Entered the Hall—he was *inside* it.

From all four sides, five massive golden-bodied figures appeared. They all had the visages of demons and evil spirits—dark, sinister, and hateful. They brandished spears, halberds, staves, pikes, and lances, and as one, they lunged to attack.

And Vast Cicada sat serenely on a high platform, palms together, chanting sutras.

Li Ximing had no choice but to raise his jade ruler, blocking the incoming halberd. A cloud of dust exploded. He was still in disbelief—his Life Divine Ability investigation revealed that this place *was* real, not some illusion! His Demonbane Cleaver Mace was hovering in the dark clouds *outside* this temple, its lightning bolts striking relentlessly at a profound drum the monk had manifested earlier.

This was his first battle against such a bizarre Buddhist practitioner. A chill ran through him.

'Vast Cicada's reputation is well-earned... If I get trapped too deep in here, escape will be difficult!'

Therefore, as the five weapons struck simultaneously, he braced himself, his face paling. He spat out another mouthful of fire, twisting his head to send it surging in all directions like a wave.

These five golden bodies were not particularly strong, and the power of the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire was terrifying. The bright white flame clung to them like a maggot feeding on a corpse, burning the golden bodies, the temple beams, and the jade seats. It spread like countless crawling demons, growing ever more ferocious.

'A pity it's Merging Fire! If it were anything else, I'd have a ninety percent certainty of trapping him right now!'

Merging Fire damaged one's nature and life-mandate. No matter where it was, it carried a sickening, malignant quality that gave one a headache. No matter how perfect Vast Cicada's temple was, it couldn't escape this fact. He absolutely could not let the fire run rampant. He paused his chanting, shook his sleeve, and a small, exquisite pagoda dropped out.

The item grew in the wind. The sixteen runes on its lowest level flashed in unison. Li Ximing, having gained a moment's breath, activated the Light of the Six Harmonies to avert the disaster. Seeing the opponent's aggressive move to suppress him, he decreed:

"The Four Seas lose hope; peacefully bear this weight."

The Light of the Six Harmonies shifted from intangible to tangible, blowing forward and transforming into a heavy, foggy golden gauze that layered itself onto the pagoda. But the monk above just smiled.

"My Xiangru Pagoda is mighty and firm. Today, it treads the profound peril, the perfect time to bear a heavy load."

A platinum-white light shone from the descending pagoda. The rolling golden mist, far from slowing it, actually made the pagoda *faster*. Li Ximing was both shocked and horrified. How could he not recognize the divine art at play? He cursed inwardly:

'It's the Bright Yang Light of the Perilous Tread!'

The pagoda plummeted. Li Ximing finally understood the desperate plight the other Daoist Masters faced when confronting Li Zhouwei. In that split second, he had no time to worry about hidden cards. He could only grit his teeth and resist, raising his own Audience with the Celestial Gate.

Platinum-golden heavenly light shone down. The brilliant Celestial Gate rose from the ground. But the five golden bodies reached out in unison, each grasping a chain, and pulled the pagoda taut, preventing the Celestial Gate from expanding further.

For a moment, the radiance of clashing Bright Yang arts flashed continuously. Dense purple fire washed over everything. The pagoda's light flickered. Vast Cicada pressed his palms together and praised:

"The pagoda contains infinite flowing light, capable of slaying lives. But Daoist Friend Zhaojing has good fortune. A place has been specially reserved for you here. To enter my Precious Tusk Temple means you are a great personage."

Though his words sounded like an invitation, his expression held little hope. The speed of his hand seals accelerated, and his eyelid twitched.

Beneath the pagoda, countless streams of bright white light were already seeping out. The Daoist Master inside was also exuding a hazy white glow through the golden pagoda walls. This was causing Vast Cicada's dharma power to drain at an alarming rate. A decisive look entered his eyes.

'I cannot drag this out... Li Ximing himself isn't the problem, but that Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire is more disgusting than anything. If it burns for too long, it will definitely destroy my pagoda!'

Having fought to this point, Vast Cicada felt he had the situation in hand. His only fear was the fire. The light in his eyes grew brighter.

"Receive this heretic into my triple-chambered room!"

As he spoke, the very bricks underfoot began to move. The massive screen behind Vast Cicada split to the sides, revealing a deeper inner chamber. There was no colossal Dharma Body or ornate carvings, only a simple golden statue.

The flames under the pagoda seemed agitated, burning even more fiercely. Vast Cicada suddenly looked up, hearing a long, drawn-out chant.

"Moo..."

The shifting ground shuddered to a halt. The golden pagoda boomed. The five golden bodies began to stagger. Doubt flashed across Vast Cicada's face, followed by shock.

'Manifestations Earth? A Daoist Master of the Manifestations Earth Dao? What?'

In the instant he lost his focus, the five chains shattered and clattered to the floor. A brownish-red radiance forcibly lifted the pagoda, revealing the Daoist Master beneath.

Li Ximing's body was covered in eye-sized holes. His own eyes had melted into pools of crimson fluid. Blinding radiance streamed through the cavities, a terrifying sight. He seemed oblivious to his state, sitting cross-legged within the pagoda, his hands cupped as if holding a lotus.

A golden, illusory radiance, thumb-sized and covered in dense, swirling runes, danced in his palms. It was brilliant, ascendant, and surrounded by three points of crimson light, like attendant stars.

Great Parting's Golden Radiance.

Vast Cicada was truly a high-level cultivator who had switched from immortal to Buddhist. He calmed himself in an instant, pressed his palms together again, and focused his power on the pagoda's tip. The illusory light he had been preparing to execute Li Ximing descended ahead of schedule!

But Li Ximing looked up even faster. A bright, colorful light emerged from his empty eye sockets. His lips parted, and with the aid of the Light of the Six Harmonies, he compressed his entire incantation into a single sound:

"Disaster overwhelms the heavens; I shall execute your evil!"

The heavenly light at his brow instantly turned dark. Hundreds, thousands of black-tailed golden streaks of light poured out, drowning the scenery above—Emperor Qi's Light!

Using the Long Yue Variable Gold he had obtained from Guo Nanwu, he had mastered this art!

"BOOM!"

The dark light, guided by the pull of the Life Divine Ability, completely submerged the descending white light. It only held for an instant, but that was all the time he needed!

"DONG!"

The rune-like Great Parting's Golden Radiance erupted into a torrent of pure gold. The Great Void boomed. The roiling Li-Light tore through the temple like a hurricane, ripped through the colorful clouds, and dyed the entire sky crimson!

The entire Precious Tusk Temple, like a tattered scroll painting, was torn in half by this radiance, scattering into motes of crystalline light. The lake, reflecting the red sky, reappeared below.

'Precious Tusk Temple is broken!'

Li Ximing knew this was far from over. He spat out a mouthful of blood and turned. His empty eyes locked onto Sima Yuanli, who was manipulating Valley Water on the lake below. A heavy roar echoed across the sky:

"Sima Yuanli! The Spiritual Treasure!"

His blood-choked shout echoed. Sima Yuanli, startled, seemed not to have expected Vast Cicada to be this powerful. He hurriedly untied a pale white, golden-glowing scroll from his waist and, while fending off the attackers around him, threw the Spiritual Treasure over.

'It doesn't matter if I fail King Wei... he's not one to hold a grudge. But if I get Li Ximing killed... King Wei will definitely make me pay with my life!'

# Chapter 1070: The Buddhist Head

Sima Yuanli had learned his lesson. He immediately threw the Spiritual Treasure in his hands, but Li Ximing didn't pause for an instant. Enduring the intense vertigo that came from overtaxing his divine ability and dharma power, his hands had already been forming a seal at his chest for some time, summoning something from far away!

_Omm!_

The torrential rain of Li Fire had not yet faded from the sky when the grand array, already shrouded in purple-gold light, began to rumble. Thirty-two beams of spiritual light rocketed upward, illuminating the heavens once more.

This was the Light of Purple Visage, drawn from the Purple Mansion Grand Array—the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array!

The majestic temple in the sky was in the process of disintegrating. A White Cicada darted through the cascading Glazed shards. Dazzling brilliance linked heaven and earth as a chaotic storm of multicolored Li Fire rained down. Caught between the red and purple flames, the figure of the young monk emerged.

Vast Cicada's eyes were sealed shut. His golden kasaya was crawling with flickering, golden Li Fire that caused the profound runes on its surface to pulse erratically. He was as still as a stone statue, utterly motionless.

The only exception was the three-finger-wide hole torn open in his chest. A faint, flickering Li Fire was visible within. Wrecked purple wisps erupted from the wound, revealing internal organs that looked like shattered Glazed crystal.

The Great Parting's White Brilliance was, after all, one of the highest-grade spell arts. Li Ximing had amplified it to an entirely new level using the Valley Wind Guide-Fire, and had focused his entire will on condensing it within the pagoda. The resulting blast had completely surpassed Vast Cicada's expectations. It hadn't just wounded his Dharma body—it had punched clean through his heart.

Even worse, the Wondrous Dharma of the Radiant Cicada Molt, the art to which he'd entrusted his very life-mandate, was designed to shed his outer shell. If cast successfully, any injury short of his bones and sinews would vanish instantly. But the penetrating "Malice of the Golden Brilliance" left behind by the attack was now coursing through his entire frame. Even transforming into a White Cicada to escape its effects was useless!

Because of this, the thirty-two purple pillars of light resonating across the sky converged, bathing the monk's face in violet light. Vast Cicada remained immobilized. The Metal Malice from the Great Parting's White Brilliance had temporarily paralyzed his Dharma body. Furthermore, the Light of the Six Harmonies infused within the attack had a powerful binding effect. The two forces worked in concert, leaving him unable to so much as open his eyelids.

_BOOM!_

The thirty-two pillars merged, coalescing into a dense, purple-gold radiance: the Broad Valley Purple Visage Light of the grand array!

At this moment of crisis, the pale golden Profound Window above Vast Cicada's head opened automatically, projecting a protective force. The monk's figure was like an ant swallowed by the onrushing, purple-gold flood.

Li Ximing coughed, but his expression held no joy. Instead, a flicker of regret passed through his mind.

'Times have changed,' he thought. 'When the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition modified this array for me, they sacrificed its offensive power. The Broad Valley Purple Visage Light is still useful against cultivators in the early Purple Mansion Realm, but against this monster's Dharma body... it's just too weak!'

With a single thought, he shot off without hesitation, racing toward a specific point in the sky.

Sure enough, while the attack had also caused the world to dim, its power was nothing compared to the Great Parting's White Brilliance that had shattered the Dharma Temple. The Broad Valley Purple Visage Light was all thunder and no rain. A painful expression crossed the monk's face, but he stood firm within the purple light as his body emitted a series of sharp crackles.

In that instant, the monk slowly forced his eyes open, his pupils swimming with disbelief.

'Luckily, Li Ximing has no other decent spell arts left...'

His Dharma body was unstable. With some difficulty, he raised a hand to cover the wound on his chest. The corresponding exit wound on his back was already healing, and the tear in his kasaya shrank to the size of a pinprick.

But in a battle between Purple Mansion Realm experts, who would give him time to heal? A long scroll unfurled in the sky. The Huai River Map snapped open in the wind, unleashing a surge of heavy golden light. A vast and mighty fortress materialized from the light and descended with overwhelming power!

_BOOM!_

A terrifying shockwave radiated through the air. Beneath the descending fortress, countless treacherous peaks erupted. All manner of Bright Yang phenomena manifested—rivers ceased to flow, golden statues crumbled, armies scattered, and colossal palaces collapsed. The bells and drums of heaven and earth rang out in an unending chorus. Vast Cicada's Dao-Profundity was truly terrifying. In the instant the fortress fell, he had already managed to temporarily suppress the Golden Brilliance ravaging his body. Freeing himself from the injury's paralysis, he raised an eyebrow and shouted:

"Engage!"

The Profound Window above his head flared with brilliant light, managing to block the Spiritual Treasure for a fraction of a second. But the Huai River Map was no ordinary artifact; it couldn't be stopped so easily. It instantly locked onto his aura while curtains of white light cascaded down on either side, sealing off all avenues of escape.

'The Huai River Map... I should have expected it!'

Trapped within the Spiritual Treasure's domain, Vast Cicada's gaze turned grim. He glanced toward his pagoda, but the artifact he had so meticulously refined was still pinned fast by the Manifestations Earth, completely immobile. The monk's expression changed as he slid his thumb from the tip of his middle finger down to the finger's base.

Just moments ago, Li Ximing had used the array's suppression to break free. He hadn't been retreating at all—he had been repositioning. Now, he thrust out his sleeve, and a large, immaculate white hand suddenly expanded. The Audience with the Celestial Gate, which he had previously used to empower himself, now descended, locking the Valley Water lotus within its grasp!

He had already used a Valley Water art to slip away from the Audience with the Celestial Gate once before. This man was anticipating him using the Borrowed Valley Water Grandeur Art to pull the same "golden cicada" escape ruse again!

'So he's not just some Alchemist who only knows cultivation!'

Vast Cicada felt a flash of both anger and admiration, but no panic. Since escape was impossible, he faced the boundless golden light pouring from the Spiritual Treasure. Enduring the searing pain in his chest, he decisively swung his sleeve and, committing completely, began to chant:

"Land of the Precious Tusk's golden edge, holy Dharma empower this vessel!"

The Profound Window above him contracted instantly, flying back into the spot between his brows. His aura surged, but now, nothing stood between him and the descending Huai River Map!

_DONG!_

The resonant sound lingered in the air. Vast Cicada staggered as if struck by a heavy blow. The nearly-healed wound on his back burst open again, returning to its full three-finger width. Two streams of white blood trickled from his nostrils, and his wide-open eyes were completely golden.

He was now trapped within a landscape of imposing mountain passes and winding rivers. The mighty fortress stretched to the horizon, towering and implacable. Atop its walls stood countless figures in golden armor, all leveling bows and spears, their eyes glaring with rage.

'I'm inside the Huai River Map!'

He looked up and saw Li Ximing, deathly pale, sitting atop the Audience with the Celestial Gate and desperately circulating his dharma power to recover. But his divine ability moved without delay. The moment he saw Vast Cicada trapped, Li Ximing abandoned the Valley Water lotus and prepared to descend upon the Spiritual Treasure himself, intending to sever the monk's connection to the Great Void.

Vast Cicada had already yielded three moves just to recover from his initial miscalculation. He could not afford to yield again!

His expression turned somber, his pupils reflecting the endless golden light of the Huai River Map. He swallowed a mouthful of blood laced with Li Fire as numerous phantoms began to manifest behind him. His voice emerged, low and ethereal:

"Precious Tusk as my vessel, a body to receive a reverent heart. Victorious Name, Dharma-form, let all who hear give praise. Let all brilliance manifest as one within me."

As he spoke, the shadows behind him took form. The image on the left sat in the full lotus position, a nimbus glowing behind its head. The image on the right bore three flowers upon its crown, its fleshy topknot coiled like a lotus. Vast Cicada himself strained, ripping the corners of his mouth wide open, back toward his ears. The entire upper half of his face peeled backward, revealing two rows of white teeth. The White Cicada within leaped forth, its fangs bared, and shrieked:

"Father! Would you kill your own son?!"

The cry was like a thunderclap shattering the heavens. It blasted the Huai River Map, causing the dimension to rattle and its light to dim as if in shame. Had it been an ordinary Spiritual Artifact, especially with its master Sima Yuanli otherwise occupied, it would have shattered. But the Huai River Map was different, and with Li Ximing's support, it teetered on the brink but miraculously held together.

This, however, was agony for Li Ximing. His face was ashen, his head spinning. He heard an earth-shattering explosion and dimly perceived countless golden beams erupting from the ground, lifting all Profound Mystery with them.

When the blinding gold and white light faded, Vast Cicada was gone. In his place, a colossal golden head was slowly rising.

The face soared into the clouds. Its nose was a mountain ridge, its dark nostrils exhaling iridescent mists. Its lips were pressed together in agony, its wrinkles as deep as gullies. Its eyes were not eyes at all, but two magnificent palaces. Countless monks bustled in and out, as if living within two Glazed orbs, all kneeling in pious worship.

Beneath the head was only a bloody, severed neck. There was no torso, as if it had been bitten clean off by some colossal, sharp-toothed beast. The true gilded form of this Maha Vast Cicada... was just a head!

A jolt of horror shot through Li Ximing.

"He's been fighting me with a mere incarnation all this time! This... this is his true gilded form!"

In truth, Vast Cicada's gilded form wasn't abnormally large. But unlike other Maha experts, his form _was only a head_. The sheer terror and scale of it thus far surpassed any other. When those two cavernous, palace-like eyes gazed down, the entire island fell deathly silent, plunged into absolute despair.

But Vast Cicada didn't hesitate for a second. With his true form revealed, the Huai River Map's suppression was at its absolute weakest. It was the perfect moment to strike!

"Hahahaha!"

A thunderous laugh rolled across the sky. The mouth gaped open to its fullest extent, a black hole that swallowed all color. Its teeth, white and sharp as blades, snapped down directly at Li Ximing.

Li Ximing's golden pupils saw it clearly: inside the head's cavernous mouth was the red-eyed White Cicada!

This White Cicada was no longer the delicate, almost cute creature from before. It was as large as a mountain, its many limbs hanging ominously in the darkness. Its compound eyes were comprised of thousands upon thousands of human eyes, all staring fixedly at him. Its mandibles clicked open and shut, drool dripping in anticipation.

A deep chill shot straight into Li Ximing's mind, and he cursed internally:

'What in the hell _is_ this Vast Cicada?!'

He knew he couldn't release the Huai River Map or move the Audience with the Celestial Gate. If his opponent reconnected with the Great Void, he would gain limitless support from the Buddhist Land. Bracing himself against the pouncing gilded form, Li Ximing clapped his hands together.

In that instant, all the Li Fire light converged. The Bright Yang Heavenly Light focused, transforming into puffs of vermilion Li Fire that scattered like smoke.

Tread on Flames!

An explosive _CRUNCH_ echoed through the sky. Vast Cicada's eyes blazed, erupting with two surging beams of white light that blasted Li Ximing from the air. The massive lips parted fiercely once more, but the mouth was now empty—the White Cicada was gone. Only a deafening shriek remained:

"AWOOOO—"

The sound shook the heavens and the earth. It made no distinction between friend and foe. Sima Yuanli, Tao Jiexing, and even the two Merciful One experts in the siege all faltered, their minds going blank for an instant.

But Li Ximing's eyes remained bright, completely unaffected. He vaulted into the air, his heart pounding with urgency. In the distance, the golden head suddenly shrank. The pagoda finally tore itself free from the Manifestations Earth that had bound it for so long. And from behind him, the terrifying White Cicada lunged, its sharp mandibles aiming to shear him in two at the waist!

Time was running out. Vast Cicada could no longer afford a protracted fight. He was willing to damage his own Dharma body to take Li Ximing down _now_!

In this desperate, split-second crisis, Li Ximing felt no panic. The Light of the Six Harmonies vanished into his sleeve. The light of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body flared as he pushed its connection and induction to their absolute limits!

But the intense pain he expected never came. Li Ximing dimly saw a curtain of purple light descend, and he found himself enveloped in a swirling purple mist.

A faint, autumn-yellow color appeared at the edge of his vision, and a woman's soft, gentle voice whispered in his ear,

"How dare you!"

Li Ximing recognized the voice instantly. He turned and, sure enough, saw a delicate, unadorned face. Her eyes, which had once seemed soft, were now steely and strong, glaring fiercely at Vast Cicada. Seeing Daoist Master Zhaojing, she broke into a grin.

"Good. You're here."

...

The sky was dim, the world leached of color.

The rumble of chariot wheels echoed across the horizon. Dark, heavy clouds plunged the entire Jiangbei region into darkness. A Daoist Master wearing robes of white feathers and dark, profound patterns stood with an icy expression, the jade gourd in his hand pulsing restlessly. His heart was heavy.

After receiving Jinlian's message, Changyun had not broken his word. He set out immediately, his escape arts carrying him at incredible speed. But his mind wasn't on Minghui's plight at all.

'Strange... Yang Ruiyi is making such a massive play.'

This Daoist Master Changyun was a man of significant standing and had his own insights into the conflict between the north and south. He knew Yang Ruiyi would inevitably strike north, but he also understood the vast disparity between the two sides.

'The Great Song has its Holder of the Profound experts, it's true. But the nation's strength hasn't recovered. Those few Holders are only at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even if they've gained some mystical power through Tianwu, they can't even match a standard Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. So what if you have five or six of them? You are their only truly decisive power...'

'It's not that the Great Song can't fight. But they absolutely cannot be fighting with the goal of seizing territory. Their strategy should be to strike at the North's forces, weaken them, and buy themselves more time to recover...'

'But given his current movements, Yang Ruiyi is spreading his forces thin, pushing them toward the Shanji region while he himself advances deep into enemy territory. Alone. I have no idea what game he's playing.' Changyun felt a headache coming on.

'If that's his plan, then Moongaze Lake is left without any major figures to defend it. Aren't they doomed?'

He was deep in thought when his expression suddenly changed. He raised his hand slightly and felt an invisible barrier obstructing his path. He acted instantly, drawing a small sword from his sleeve. He slapped a talisman onto the blade and shouted:

"Geng-Dui Phase-Shift, let the way be opened!"

Perhaps the barrier was only designed to keep people in, not out, or perhaps the small sword was simply extraordinary. It sliced a fissure into the pitch-black, gloomy light with surprising ease, making Daoist Master Changyun's eye twitch.

'This is bad... Don't tell me it's an ambush!'

But a piercing shriek suddenly split the air. The world before him shattered like Glazed glass, and a hand—once elegant and pale, now mangled and hacked down to the bone—leaped out and flew frantically toward him!

The palm of this large hand sprouted two eyes and a mouth, as if it had been carelessly grafted on from a corpse. It was now emitting a desolate, desperate roar:

"Save me! Save me! Daoist Master, save me!"




# Chapter 1071: Casting Out Dissidents

The hand fled frantically through the air, pursued by two layers of hazy grey light. Changyun needed only a single glance to understand the situation.

His origins were lofty, and he had cultivated his eyes with special spiritual items. Combined with an exceptionally high-grade technique, he could see through transformations even a Great Daoist Master might cast. He was not fooled.

He recognized Minghui instantly. With a flick of his sleeve, a white umbrella slid free and unfurled in the air.

The moment the umbrella opened, twelve-colored light burst from its ribs and slammed headlong into the seemingly weak grey light. A thunderous crash echoed out. Three autumn leaves, each as large as a man's head, came spiraling down, buffeted by a gentle breeze.

But from these leaves, three winds erupted—one blue-grey, one jet-black, and one grey-white. They swept down from above, making the earth tremble. Clumps of black soil surged into the sky as a massive hurricane rose from the flat ground.

The arcane wind's power was immense. The umbrella immediately issued a strained creak, and Changyun's expression turned grave. He pinched a talisman between two fingers to block the heavy yin mist, then raised his other hand and called out in a low voice:

“Minghui!”

Minghui had indeed lost his dharma-body, reduced to a single arm. A pair of eyes and a mouth had been carved into the palm, and the terror in his expression was still visible. He cried out in a desperate voice:

“Daoist Master, save my disciple-brother!”

But Changyun's expression turned suspicious. “Who is attacking?”

Minghui, still shaken, cried,

“You ask me? Who can I ask? The Untraceable Presence is upon them! If it's not Yang Ruiyi, who else could it be!”

Changyun recognized the tone was genuine and his heart eased. After another careful inspection, he gripped the white umbrella, formed an incantation with two fingers, and touched them to his brow.

Using his divine ability and spell arts, he gazed into the distance. He found the area had become a hazy grey expanse, like a ghostly region of the Underworld. Countless skeletal ghosts climbed over one another, their tangled bodies forming a sky-piercing mountain. Above, thousands upon thousands of kites, owls, dark crows, and vicious raptors wheeled in the gloom. Only a pale white temple stood at the mountain's peak, looking as if it might collapse at any moment.

Changyun's vigilance intensified. He shifted his gaze abruptly and, just as he suspected, saw a Bronze Xuanming Chariot standing at the highest point. Long bronze steps snaked down from it, flanked by green lanterns burning with pale blue flames.

‘Yang Ruiyi...’

Changyun's brows furrowed. He stood firm under the white umbrella, but his sense of wrongness peaked.

He had originally assumed Yang Ruiyi was using the Great Song's full might to strike north, using Moongaze Lake to pin down Vast Cicada. The goal, he thought, was for a lone army to penetrate deep and split the east from the west. And yet, Yang Ruiyi's true self was still here!

He had to understand, both Minghui and he had based their agreement on the assumption that Yang Ruiyi would _lead_ an attack here. Minghui and his disciple-brother would suffer a total defeat, and Changyun would swoop in to save them... They weren't supposed to be stubbornly holding out for reinforcements!

This meant the all-out attacks from Li Ximing, Tinglan, and the others had failed to buy Yang Ruiyi his opening into the north. He hadn't even made it halfway across Jiangbei.

Once the many Daoist Masters from the north gathered, Yang Ruiyi, whose forces were already far inferior, would undoubtedly be forced to return empty-handed. The south might even suffer a grievous blow to its vitality!

‘Could it be? Did Yang Ruiyi's gamble backfire spectacularly...’

He immediately shifted his gaze to the mountain peak, to the brightly shining temple. There were no figures inside, only the bones of monks and scattered golden robes. Atop a mountain of corpses sat a single monk, perfectly upright. His face was pale, but he was stubbornly chanting the Classics.

‘It's Mingxiang.’

Changyun was on good terms with the Lotus Temple and naturally recognized this rising star. Mingxiang hadn't used his full strength in the great battle on the lake, but Changyun estimated his power was second only to Vast Cicada and Zhelu!

But even if Changyun had overestimated him, a doubt now surfaced, and he shuddered in alarm:

‘It must be a trick! That's not Yang Ruiyi inside!’

The Exiled Qi in Yang Ruiyi's possession could be ranked as the Dao Lineage most antithetical to Buddhist cultivators. When that Exiled Qi Spiritual Treasure suppressed an area, it was enough to completely sever any Buddhist cultivator not at the Maha or Liangli level from the Buddhist Land, making it impossible for them to borrow even a shred of power. Mingxiang wasn't Jinlian; it was absolutely impossible for him to hold out this long unscathed!

The pitch-black baleful qi in the sky grew infinitely dense. Changyun spun around, noticing the path he had taken was disappearing bit by bit. Yet, he didn't immediately move to leave. Instead, a thoughtful expression crossed his face.

“Daoist Friend Changyun!”

The astonishment and doubt on Changyun's face vanished. He looked down, pensive, only to see the expression on the hand in his sleeve suddenly freeze. A crimson light flared within its two eerie eyes, shining straight into his!

“You!”

The Daoist Master's figure froze. He hesitated for a split second, but the hand in his other sleeve, pinching a talisman, finally relaxed. Gritting his teeth, he squeezed his eyes shut and activated his divine ability!

“Pfft!”

Even though Changyun was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with an extremely strong Dharma Body, he couldn't withstand such a strike while undefended. His shimmering silver eyes shattered instantly. Two streams of golden blood trickled from their corners. He had lost his eyes!

He cried out in pain and decisively raised his arm, striking the severed hand with his sleeve. Golden light shattered and black energy dispersed amidst screams echoing from all directions. Changyun's chance to escape had vanished. He held nothing back, roaring in fury:

“You dare deceive me with a transformation art!”

The yin qi in the sky pressed down. Six talismans flew out one by one from the tightly shut bronze door, scattering innumerable spirits that converged to suppress Changyun.

The white light from the temple grew dimmer, but with Changyun now sharing the burden, it gained a moment's respite. Mingxiang sat cross-legged before the temple, hands pressed together, his face a mask of piousness.

Minghui's severed limb had been shattered by Changyun's palm, but Mingxiang showed not the slightest grief. He only sneered inwardly:

‘Junior Brother, it seems he's understood!’

As he sneered, a small segment of golden nasal bone was revealed within his robes. It buzzed, using wondrous dharma power to transmit Minghui's thoughts:

‘Changyun is clever. He already knows the one in this territory isn't Yang Ruiyi. But it's not just us who hate Qi Lanyan! Changyun was forcibly summoned here by him; what good feelings could he have? He's even less willing to offend the south. So, he quickly destroyed his own dharma-eyes to withdraw from the front lines. Now he has a perfect excuse for "failing" to recognize Yang Ruiyi!’

Changyun's dharma-eyes were powerful. What fell into his robes just now wasn't a transformation art at all, but a device from Minghui himself. It was secret collusion, all to help Changyun shed responsibility!

‘Right now, my dharma-body is "destroyed" from resisting the south. Master will have a reason to protect us. Once the Exiled Qi seals this place, who will know what really happened? Can they pin this on us?’

His voice grew colder as he laughed viciously.


‘Let Mount Dayang and Qi Lanyan find nothing! Let Yang Ruiyi give them a heavy blow! You lot from Mount Dayang... did you think my disciple-brother and I are made of clay? If we were really just dogs and horses for you to command... then my Way of Joyful Bliss wouldn't be counted among the Seven Aspects!’

...

### Xuanmiao Temple

Distant lights flickered, casting a painful, brilliant red glow. The dharma lamp before the platform wavered, its light cold and eerie. Above, a young man in a long white-gauze cap and a Daoist robe of black clouds and Profound Mystery patterns stared intently at the chessboard.

It was none other than Qi Lanyan, the one stirring up Jiangbei!

The youth playing chess against him wore blue robes and had clever, spirited eyes. A small water-sparrow stood on his shoulder. He looked at Qi Lanyan with a smile.

“Shanji is in chaos, yet Lord Qi remains so calm.”

Qi Lanyan picked up a chess piece.

“Shanji has Gongsun Bei and Murong Yan,” he said softly. “It will be fine for a short while. Yang Ruiyi hasn't shown himself, so you and I cannot act rashly.”

He tapped the table and raised an eyebrow.

“I'm more curious. The Capital immortals Dao faces the Wilderness directly... Daoist Friend, you were invited here. Aren't you afraid?”

Yehui smiled.

“I trust you, my lord.”

Yehui was an inherently selfish person. His only worry was for his sister's few children, whom he had sent overseas long ago. He didn't care at all if everyone else died a thousand or ten thousand times. His words were pure flattery.

Qi Lanyan didn't believe him either. “Jiangbei has roughly three main routes,” he said coolly. “West is Xiaoshi and Tangdao Mountains, behind Baijiang Creek. Middle is Chengshui and Capital immortals. And East is Xuanmiao, behind Shanji...”

“Which route do you think Yang Ruiyi will attack, Daoist Friend?”

Yehui picked up a piece, studied the board, and said quietly,

“Great Song doesn't want to break any specific sect; it wants to control the world's situation. From the land of Yue to controlling the region between the Huai, and then restoring the power of the Chu State... But in the Yue lands, there is a thorn in their eye, a spike in their flesh. If it's not removed, Yang Ruiyi cannot rest or eat in peace.”

He placed his stone.

“Shanji.”

If one had to name the one thing Profound Governance Pavilion had done to most disgust the Yang Clan, it was undoubtedly planting the nail of Shanji in the south. Once Shanji Prefecture is lost, even if Great Song conquers all the lands of Shu, the Song Emperor will still bear the shame of having lost his dynasty's former lands!

“Not so.”

Qi Lanyan nodded and smiled.

“They definitely want to take Shanji, but they lack the strength for a direct assault. It should have been a slow plot. But Yang Ruiyi has one weakness I do not: he has a Song Emperor above him. Once he attacks, he _must_ achieve results.”

Yehui's expression was grim.

“Your Lordship's information is quite thorough.”

He couldn't fathom how Qi Lanyan had confirmed the relationship between Yang Ruiyi and the Song Emperor. He could only assume the information came from the powers backing him.

Qi Lanyan said in a low voice, “Since he can't take Shanji, he can only enter from the center. He'll cut off Capital immortals in the middle and sever the connection between Xuanmiao and the Zhao State. First, this coordinates with the other force attacking Western Shu. Second... it gives the Song Emperor an answer.”

Yehui was extremely sharp.

“So, my lord, you planned this all along, intentionally sacrificing Capital immortals.”

Qi Lanyan smiled. “Not exactly... I still have a use for you.”

He lifted his sleeve, revealing a jade talisman glowing faintly.

“Below Chengyun, beside Capital immortals, there is a Brahma Cloud Cave. Daoist Friends Changyun and Mingxiang have already lost contact, trapped inside. Yang Ruiyi must have arrived. Please, Daoist Friend, call Zong Chang and the others. Go to Shanji first and strike against Liu Bai. Preferably, take Yufu Prefecture!”

Yehui immediately stood.

“My lord is truly brilliant... But that Spiritual Treasure is powerful. If our group goes east, Changyun and Mingxiang alone will have trouble stopping him...”

Qi Lanyan smiled coldly.

“I long ago arranged for Daoist Friend Vast Cicada to hurry nearby. With him there, he should be able to stall Yang Ruiyi. The people from Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain have already gone.”

Yehui repeatedly called him brilliant and cupped his hands in a salute. He turned to leave, though inwardly he was noncommittal.

‘Vast Cicada will go? Bullshit! He would never ignore a juicy prize like Moongaze Lake. That means he must still be at the lake. Qi Lanyan only mentioned him to have grounds to punish him later. As for how the trapped people die, it has nothing to do with him.’

‘Since he could trap Changyun and Mingxiang so silently, it's definitely Yang Ruiyi. But if his whereabouts are known, why is Qi Lanyan still sitting here? Why not seize the chance to strike south?’

Yehui's face was a mask of respect, but inwardly he felt something was extremely off. He couldn't help but turn back.

“Lord Qi...”

Qi Lanyan shook his head and smiled.

“I have my own place to be.”

The youth watched Yehui leave. He stared at the chessboard again. After a while, a man in Daoist robes approached, bowed before the platform, and said respectfully, “Master!”

Qi Lanyan hadn't brought any disciples from Profound Governance Pavilion on this trip, yet this disciple calling him Master was wearing their robes. Even more bizarre... his cultivation was only at the Qi Refining stage!

“Rise.”

Qi Lanyan smiled at him. The man rose after bowing.

“Master, right now...”

Qi Lanyan withdrew his hand from the board and turned to him. “Yang Ruiyi cannot afford to lose any more southern territory. Losing one piece there can't be compensated for even by ten pieces in the north. He won't just ignore Shanji; there must be a backup plan. Yehui and the others will certainly return empty-handed. There's no need to go.”

The man bowed his head. “Master's words are wise...”

He knelt on the ground.

“Master...” he said, his voice cautious, “why not make a trip to Ting Province... to where that Wei spawn is...”

His tone was grave, but his voice trembled slightly, as if he had suggested something deeply disrespectful.

Hearing the words “Ting Province,” Qi Lanyan closed his eyes and exhaled heavily.

“I understand your eagerness, but this is not the time. Li Zhouwei is very safe right now. If I go there alone, am I supposed to join forces with Vast Cicada? I'll just get dragged in myself. Besides, even if you kill everyone on the lake, he might not come out, and we still might not be able to kill him.”

He seemed troubled.

“We failed to eliminate him before his wings were fully fledged, so a forced siege is meaningless now. The goal of slowing his cultivation has been achieved, but the trend of the great north-south situation cannot change...”

The youth stood up, tossing the chess piece in his hand.

“When the great chaos begins,” he said softly, “and the various lords personally enter the field, and we add fuel to the fire from the sidelines... only then will it be possible to complete this. Relying only on us, even borrowing the might from the mountain... is not enough.”

The man below said, “I just fear...”

He hesitated, but the words he left unsaid were terrifying. Qi Lanyan gritted his teeth.

“Besides, you saw for yourself whether it succeeded or not, didn't you!”

The man below fell silent.

Qi Lanyan closed his eyes. “Say no more. I am going to Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain.”



# Chapter 1072: Falling to Earth

The Great Void trembled, the two colors of Azure Crow Qi interweaving.

The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain had been utterly transformed ever since it became favored by the cultivators of Mount Dayang. Countless temples now clung to its slopes. The mountain's most famous peak, the one that jutted toward the sky like a razor-sharp blade, had been carved with innumerable Maha visages. They stared down from on high, gazing mercilessly upon the mortal world.

Countless monks in meditation robes stood on the mountain, palms pressed together in solemn, dignified prayer. Nearby, several enormous, golden figures were gathered, whispering amongst themselves.

"I heard... Yang Ruiyi has fought his way deep into Capital immortals territory..."

"Isn't Lord Vast Cicada there to stop him?"

The one who spoke was a white-skinned Merciful One the size of a house. Its face was ferocious, and its aura was profound. Another Merciful One beside it chuckled.

"You overestimate him, and you underestimate the Exiled Qi. I doubt he can be stopped."

"He might not even be trying to stop him!"

The figures whispered, clearly possessing some understanding of the situation, their voices tinged with lingering fear.

"Who would dare? Five-Eyed is still being boiled in that copper cauldron on Mount Dayang... Their determination this time cannot be underestimated!"

Just as they were muttering, the light in the sky suddenly dimmed. The Merciful One who had spoken looked up in horror, frozen in place.

The two-colored light of Azure Crow Qi roiled wantonly across the sky, tearing rifts into the blackness of the Great Void. A massive bronze imperial carriage drifted through the air, exuding a grim, deathly aura, as if attended by ten thousand ghosts.

This palace was no larger than any of the golden statues, yet its presence drained the color from the world and shook the hearts of all Buddhists. A black curtain was slowly drawn aside, and a man in dark robes descended the steps, gazing silently at the world below.

It was Yang Ruiyi, whose whereabouts had been unknown!

The man stood with his hands clasped, carefully sensing the fluctuations in the Great Void. He made a quick calculation with his fingers, and understanding dawned in his mind.

'The monks of Lotus Temple had followed their own master's treacherous path, refusing to serve Mount Dayang. That Zhang Yun is also a two-faced traitor, but he won't ruin things. It's all in the past.'

He didn't waste a moment. He led something out from the palace hall—a small, stumbling calf. It had no fur; its entire body was crafted from mud, yet it moved like a living creature, its legs trembling as it followed him.

'That Qi Lanyan is a petty, worthless coward, but he stumbled into some Heavenly Element opportunity. He knows how to read and copy the situation. But how could he know Heavenly Element's calculations are imprecise? Even Heavenly Element itself fell into the Exiled Qi. What can those wretches who received Heavenly Element's favor possibly accomplish?'

His brow lowered, his expression turning cold. He stepped out, planting himself firmly above the mountain range.

"Even if they understand, what power or will do they have to change anything!"

He abruptly released his grip on the rope. The mud calf immediately plummeted toward the mountains like a bird with broken wings, kicking up a furious gale as it fell.

The wind was a swirling, grayish-white mass, as if blown from a bottomless abyss. It was as heavy as snow, causing the Great Void itself to heave and rupture, tearing rifts that sent one or two Merciful Ones who had just stepped into it tumbling back out.

'It's over!'

A pale pink barrier of light instantly flared to life over the mountain—the sect's protective grand array!

But to the horror of the assembled cultivators, the small, dark object that fell from the sky met no resistance at all, drifting lazily downward.

The pink barrier was laughably fragile. To say it was like paper was an understatement; it was as if it didn't exist at all.

The way of Buddhist cultivators was to hide within their Buddhist Land to practice. They had neither the need nor the skill to establish defensive arrays. They had some research into formations for connecting to the Buddhist Land, but when it came to establishing a real defensive line, they were utterly clueless. How could they compare to the Daoist Traditions of immortal cultivators, who anchored divine abilities to protect their Purple Mansion Realms!

The group of Merciful Ones looked as if they had seen ghosts. Not one of them dared to intercept the calf. Instead, they scattered, fleeing desperately in all directions. But the Great Void was vast and cold, and a moment later, a single, crisp sound echoed in everyone's ears.

Dong!

A long, resonant moo echoed across the heavens. Where the mud calf landed, a spot of brownish-yellow light appeared, then instantly spread like a storm, enveloping the entire mountain range!

The revered images carved as reliefs into the mountainside rapidly blurred, crumbling into rolling avalanches of dirt. All the buildings transformed into yellowish-brown brick and mud. The Buddhist cultivators—whether they were running, kneeling, or wailing—froze in place. They turned into one mud statue after another, their forms quickly losing definition, before collapsing into piles of fertile soil.

Amidst the chaotic collapse, the white-skinned Merciful One felt the terrifying aura approaching from behind, its mind blank with confusion.

Whatever this falling spiritual creature was, it had locked him in place, unable to move, while simultaneously sealing off the Great Void. Although this power alone couldn't easily kill him, once Yang Ruiyi descended, he was surely dead.

The Merciful One remained frozen, its mind utterly blank.

'How can Yang Ruiyi be here?!'

'What right does he have to be here?!'

It truly couldn't comprehend the Song State's Grand General's actions. The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain was indeed empty and undefended... but so what? Was he just here to vent his anger by killing the two or three Merciful Ones and the gaggle of low-level monks left to guard the mountain?

'All of Song's Daoist Masters are in Shanji. After he kills us, what then? The people from Western Shu are in Long. The Golden Feather Sect is leaning toward Shu, content to watch the tigers fight from a mountaintop. When the various Maha masters and even the Profound Governance cultivators rush back, what will he use to defend this place? By himself? Does he think he can rely on the likes of Li Ximing, who can be single-handedly stalled by Vast Cicada? In the end, won't he just have to retreat with nothing to show for it?'

'Is this really just to vent his anger?!'

RUMBLE!

It had no more time to think. The long-suffering spiritual mountain was trembling, slowly beginning to rise. Parts that were once low-lying swelled upward, forming new hills. The boundless Primordial Magnetism that had always flowed through the range stopped moving. The entire mountain dimmed as the Primordial Magnetism within every inch of the earth veins began to shudder. A torrent of energy surged, and streams of Metal Malice began to drill out from between the cracks in the stone.

The roiling Metal Malice rushed toward the sky, transforming into an ethereal white mist. Yang Ruiyi remained standing before the bronze carriage, his back to the infernal landscape of the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain.

The Grand General of Song did not descend to finish off the Merciful Ones trapped in the light of Manifestations Earth. Instead, he stood quietly upon the palace, placed his hands on the bronze doors, and gave a gentle push.

"Creeaak..."

The ancient doors instantly swung open. The white mist floating in the air surged desperately into the main hall, forming a terrifying vortex. White dew condensed from the Metal Malice quickly trickled down the bronze of the palace. Yang Ruiyi stood silently in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

---

Moongaze Lake.

The sky was dim. A thick purple light lingered between heaven and earth, while indigo and azure flames rose into the air. The colors of Immeasurable Water and Fire swept across the sky, burning the exquisite pagoda above it until it creaked and groaned.

Li Ximing hovered in the air, his face pale. Faintly glowing, pale-gold wounds covered his body. The divine ability within him surged and ebbed like a tide, and a burning light shone from his hands.

He silently tightened his sleeve, coughed, and assessed the situation.

'Thank heavens for the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion...'

Although Tinglan had saved him from peril, the outcome was still deeply regrettable. When Vast Cicada sent out the White Cicada, he had been preparing for two eventualities. While Li Ximing was occupied, Vast Cicada's true body had already taken the opportunity to break through and escape from beneath the Huai River Map.

'If she had arrived just one stick of incense sooner... with the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion and the Huai River Map combined, we could have definitely suppressed Vast Cicada! Now, even Sima Yuanli can't hold on much longer...'

Even with this setback, and with Tinglan joining him, they were still at a disadvantage against this foe, despite possessing the Supreme Minister's Gourd and the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion. That pagoda was no ordinary item. The wounds it inflicted on Li Ximing's Dharma body clung to him like a festering disease. If not for his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body absorbing thirty percent of the damage, Li Ximing's predicament would be even worse.

This forced Li Ximing to wonder:

'How did Vast Cicada become so powerful?!'

Tinglan, however, showed no surprise. She silently raised the greyish-white Supreme Minister's Gourd, using Immeasurable Water and Fire to interfere with the light from the Buddhist Land. Seeing Li Ximing's uneasy expression, she said quickly:

"Zhaojing, be careful. Vast Cicada is the master of the Golden Land. He is not easy to deal with..."

Li Ximing endured the magical injuries wracking his body and shot her a questioning look. Tinglan gritted her teeth.

"He doesn't dare try to capture the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion itself. You be careful not to get captured by his spell arts..."

The two stood beneath the glow of the magical treasures. A gigantic human head hung in the air, its cavernous mouth gaping wide. The menacing White Cicada had already darted out of the mouth and was now clinging to the head's face, casting a massive shadow on the ground below. Its six white, segmented legs twitched, and its compound eyes gleamed.

Light streamed from the purple palace in the zenith. Five multicolored purple clouds of varying shades circled the palace before descending one by one. The White Cicada beat its wings several times, but the Purple Qi sapped its energy and suppressed its divine abilities, preventing it from rising.

This White Cicada was supposed to channel the Celestial Yang, but it was completely suppressed by the purple pavilion. It seemed utterly stifled. Beneath his own cicada wings, Vast Cicada's eyes grew dark and cold.

'The Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion... That's Tinglan, from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land...'

Vast Cicada knew of the pavilion's reputation. Most cultivators from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land were not skilled in combat, but back when this artifact was in Zimu's hands, it had suppressed legions of demons. It was a terrifying weapon!

'This woman isn't fit to be mentioned in the same breath as Zimu, but the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion was refined and sealed by Zimu personally. It's not what it once was. Who knows what hidden trumps it might still contain!'

His mood grew darker, turning to hateful resentment.

'Qing Jifang... all bluster and no backbone. All talk and no action. Mean, ungrateful, shameless, and quick to make empty promises. Touba Lan was right about him. How could he ever work up the nerve to attack the Song Kingdom? He must have let this woman through on purpose!'

Even knowing that Qing Jifang's words were always empty, Vast Cicada couldn't help but feel a sliver of disappointment. He mused silently:

'Is it... worth continuing this fight?'

The White Cicada restlessly twitched its scaled wings, revealing its master's hesitation. The fierce light in Vast Cicada's golden eyes intensified.

'The Precious Tusk Golden Land is with me. If I am absolutely determined to kill Li Ximing, I can do it by sacrificing the Golden Land. I'm even ninety percent certain of success... But the sacrifice would be too great. Not only would I lose the Precious Tusk, but the commotion would be enormous... and it would absolutely offend the Underworld.'

Vast Cicada understood. The South might not actually care about Li Ximing's life or death. But the conflict between North and South was in a fragile equilibrium. The consequence of sacrificing the Precious Tusk to eliminate Li Ximing wouldn't just be the death of an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator—it would be the fall of the entire Ting Province!

What made it even more difficult was the risk that Li Zhouwei might ignore his own injuries, emerge from seclusion early, and save Li Ximing. If that happened, all the sacrifices Vast Cicada made would be for nothing—he would have merely served as a sacrificial blade for others to test the waters. This was the true reason for his hesitation.

'Everyone in the Dharma Realm is just waiting for me to make a mistake. Is this move worth it? I may have seized the initiative, but I cannot sacrifice a Golden Land just to be someone else's pawn.'

His heart grew heavier. Before he could make a decision, he froze. He lifted his sleeve and saw a jade bracelet on his wrist glowing faintly. His heart pounded.

'The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain?'

'How is that possible?!'

A chill shot through Vast Cicada's mind. He was horrified.

'This is bad!'

Vast Cicada was backed by the Great Adoration Dharma Realm—which was to say, Mount Dayang, currently involved in the Jiangbei affair. This was the only reason he could ignore Qi Lanyan's orders and head south on his own initiative.

Testing the Wei-fiend was in Mount Dayang's interest. Even if Yang Ruiyi tore Jiangbei apart and besieged the Profound Governance Pavilion, Mount Dayang would just watch the show, pretend to punish him, and then casually ensure his safety.

But with the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain in trouble, the ones watching the show would be the Profound Governance Pavilion and Qi Lanyan!

'How did he get to the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain?!'

Vast Cicada was from a Dharma Realm; how could he not know what kind of beings sat at the top of Mount Dayang? Those bastards were used to being masters of all. Even if heading south was an unspoken move that aligned with Mount Dayang's interests, if something happened to the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, they would fly into a rage, play dumb, and goddammit, they would still throw him out to take the blame!

The enormous White Cicada immediately beat its wings. Vast Cicada's mountain-sized golden head roared, burning his own cultivation base. Golden blood sprayed from its mouth as multicolored light flared in the sky. Massive temples manifested one after another, smashing down toward the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion and the Audience with the Celestial Gate!

BOOM!

Tinglan's face paled. She flicked a hand seal, and the five beams of purple light from the pavilion converged, forcefully stabilizing the Spiritual Treasure. Li Ximing was in much worse shape. Blood trickled from his mouth, but his focus didn't waver for an instant. He immediately raised his hand and said in a low voice:

"He's trying to leave!"

Tinglan nodded, catching her breath. She turned aside.

"Don't try to stop him..."

In truth, Li Ximing no longer had the power to stop him anyway. The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body in his sleeve was shaking violently; it had reached its limit. There was no real benefit in trying to hold Vast Cicada back, and he might even end up destroying his precious treasure.

He just swallowed the blood in his mouth, watching the multicolored light in the sky fade and vanish. He clenched his jaw, his heart lost in a daze.

'I wonder how much longer Moongaze Lake will remain a place they can come and go as they please...'

He drifted silently down from the pavilion. Sima Yuanli was already walking over, clutching his robes. Without the protection of the Huai River Map, he was struggling. Half his face was consumed by golden fire, revealing charred flesh and stark white bone. On his neck were six neat, round holes, hissing as they smoked.

Li Ximing clasped his hands in salute and took a spirit pill from his sleeve, offering it to him. Sima Yuanli quickly accepted it without a word, pouring water from a green gourd to carefully extinguish the flames on his face.

He managed to stabilize the injuries on his face, then gritted his teeth and said:

"I trust Zhaojing has not forgotten General Yang's instructions!"

Li Ximing was speechless. He stood in place for a brief second, then turned to look at Tinglan. The woman in purple robes was not surprised. She bowed to him, her expression complicated.

"Tinglan has also received orders. I am to accompany you north!"

Li Ximing was struck dumb.

"I can't believe the General is so confident as to leave the western front completely unguarded!"

Sima Yuanli shook his head and replied:

"Zhaojing, rest assured. The Grand General gave his word. The moment we saw Vast Cicada retreat, we were to head north. The master of the great desert is, after all, the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. Western Shu will not dare to invade!"

Sima Yuanli clearly didn't know the full reasoning and hesitated even as he spoke. He urged in a low, anxious voice:

"This place has its own grand array! We cannot delay the opportunity in the north!"

Li Ximing wasn't actually reluctant to go north; he was just uneasy about leaving the lake undefended. But he had already given his promise, and the timing was critical. Furthermore, he had a measure of trust in the Yang family. He gave the command to activate the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. Watching the purple light rumble to life beneath his feet, he made his decision.

"Let's go!"

# Chapter 1073: Manifestation

The Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter was a grim landscape of skeletal remains, littered with broken restriction fields. The temples, built around the gaps in the mausoleum grounds, were in utter disarray. Shaken by the tremors that rocked the heavens and the earth, they had collapsed one after another, leaving a scene of total ruin.

Li Ximing traveled through the Great Void as a streak of light. The wounds on his skin still throbbed with a dull ache. He touched a wisp of the lingering golden light, sensing it carefully.

'It seems to be some kind of Metal Malice blended into Treasure Light and tempered with fire... He was an immortal cultivator, after all. This technique certainly has some power.'

The pagoda had crushed him badly, and the subsequent battles had only worsened his state. These injuries were not light. After long consideration, Li Ximing finally flipped his sleeve and retrieved a pill.

The pill resembled a crystal, solid and smooth, and it flickered with an unsteady white light. It was the Treasured Star Body-Spirit Pill, a relic obtained from the Southern Township Daoist Tradition before the fall of Wanling Heaven!

Li Ximing was usually reluctant to use such a precious pill for these kinds of injuries. Normally, he would just take a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill and enter a short seclusion to recover. But today, not knowing what other troubles lay ahead, he finally steeled himself and swallowed it in one gulp.

The pill was truly extraordinary. It melted the instant it entered his mouth, releasing a clean, refreshing warm current that surged through him. The pain in his dharma physique quickly subsided as the invading golden fire was scattered and expelled.

'I wonder which branch of the Earth Virtue Dao this belongs to. The effect is simply excellent.'

He let out a breath of relief as he sank his spiritual sense into his sleeve, secretly checking on the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

The small statue was now covered in a web of fine, hairline cracks that glowed with a faint golden light, largely matching the injuries on his own dharma physique. But this item was not a divine ability or a true Dharma Body; after enduring so much damage, it had already begun to look dim.

'This thing was extremely effective against many of Vast Cicada's Buddhist cultivators techniques. It provided special resistance, blocking thirty to forty percent of their power, and even mitigated ten to twenty percent of the physical wounds...'

Overall, the injuries Li Ximing had actually sustained were far from severe. They weren't even as bad as the wounds Changxiao had inflicted on him back then—and Changxiao's techniques were far more difficult to heal.

This outcome far exceeded Li Ximing's expectations, and he couldn't help but feel a flicker of joy.

'If not for its exorbitant cost... and its powerlessness against certain special Dao paths, this would be an absolutely fantastic treasure.'

What satisfied him even more was that with the conclusion of his Sealing the Life-Mandate, the connection between this proxy body and his true life-mandate was severed. The top-grade resource held in the statue's mouth was rapidly converting into a rolling, abundant tide of Spiritual Qi, constantly nourishing it!

'The restorative effect of the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance on the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood... is simply terrifying.'

Li Ximing even began to suspect that the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body would be as good as new in less than three days!

'Three days! That's not even enough time for me to cultivate the finger I used for Sealing the Life-Mandate! It'll be over in the blink of an eye!'

For now, he just silently circulated his dharma power and turned to look at Tinglan. He was just about to speak when an earth-shattering explosion roared from the northern horizon. The layers of dark, baleful clouds overhead instantly scattered, and an intense aura of Earth Virtue surged into the heavens!

Both Tinglan and Sima Yuanli's expressions changed. Tinglan showed little surprise, but more a sense of uncertainty. Sima Yuanli, however, was purely astonished. He whispered:

"Manifestations Earth!"

That one phrase instantly put Li Ximing on high alert. Manifestations Earth was the 'She' (Earth) aspect of the twin Sheji Daos—not something to be trifled with. He narrowed his eyes, made a quick calculation, and asked,

"Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain?"

Tinglan nodded slightly and said in a low voice,

"No new orders have come. This must be part of the Lord's plan. We will conquer Xiaoshi first... then go to reinforce!"

The two immediately understood. Sima Yuanli looked somewhat relieved and replied,

"Thank goodness... As we headed north, I was afraid Vast Cicada would see he couldn't return to Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain and set up an ambush for us halfway!"

Li Ximing sighed inwardly. This whole battle had left him deeply unsettled. He gritted his teeth and said,

"I've heard of Mingxiang from the Lotus Temple, and Vija from the former Great Desire Dao... But where did this Vast Cicada get such profound techniques? Just because he's a reincarnated immortal cultivator?"

Tinglan let out a breath and looked at Li Ximing, hesitating.

"Zhaojing misjudged. Because we were on the lake, he wasn't even using his full strength... Now that you've let him return to the north, his divine ability will be even more potent!"

Sima Yuanli sighed heavily. Seeing the unease on Li Ximing's face, he picked up the conversation.

"He is the lord of the Precious Tusk Golden Land and a karmic heir to the Undefeated King of Brightness. He's not someone ordinary Buddhist cultivators can compare to... If Sparrow Carp Fish hadn't gone south and received that great opportunity, he would still be a notch below him!"

Li Ximing had at least heard of the Undefeated King of Brightness. Although records of him in the south were exceedingly rare, he estimated he was also a Dharma Master. He frowned and said,

"The Precious Tusk Golden Land? It seems his is the only one in the world."

But Sima Yuanli shook his head. "Although I don't know much about Buddhist cultivators, I do know that there isn't just one Golden Land. There's an even more famous one, which you might be more familiar with, called the Qin Ling Golden Land. It's been lost for a thousand years. By relying on a lingering connection, it can still support one or two of the Merciful One. Right now, that Merciful One is still researching it, trying to draw water with a bamboo basket—a complete waste of effort."

He seemed somewhat wistful.

"It's no wonder he tries... If one could truly control a Golden Land independently, beholden to no one, it might even be possible to reside above the celestial vault, looking down on all."

Although Sima Yuanli claimed to know little about Buddhist cultivators, given Li Ximing's understanding of him and his frequent communications with the north, he probably knew more details than anyone else present.

Only Tinglan remained silent. The column of Manifestations Earth light erupting in the north seemed to make her very hesitant, even a little absent-minded.

Li Ximing fell silent for a moment, but time didn't permit him to ask more questions. The tremors in the Great Void were growing more distinct. Tinglan had already taken the lead, tearing open the Great Void and suddenly emerging!

The mountain range below was enveloped in a deep golden light. Amidst the rolling hills, a state of panic had broken out among the densely packed temples. Numerous Buddhist cultivators were gathered in groups, whispering anxiously as they stared at the radiance erupting in the distance.

"Who dares invade my Xiaoshi!"

In an instant, white qi streaked through the sky. Streams of light converged, and an enormous, white Golden Body rose up, its expression uncertain and alarmed. Its radiant white brilliance immediately shot into the sky, shaking the Great Void!

Tinglan said nothing. Her face calm, she simply directed the pavilion, which was boiling with purple-gold energy, to descend. Forming a hand seal, she cast her spell, tossing out the small, greyish-white pot in her hand. It immediately rippled with the infamously deadly Immeasurable Water and Fire.

Li Ximing observed for a moment and immediately recognized this Maha.

‘Yanbai!’

The one guarding this place was none other than Yanbai of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm!

This Maha hailed from a Dharma Realm and possessed considerable strength. He had once gone south to attack Lixia and later turned up to provide support on the lake. There was a history of enmity there. Li Ximing immediately formed a hand seal, while Sima Yuanli gave a slight lift of his hand, revealing a scroll in his sleeve. He called out urgently:

"Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain has already been conquered! Daoist Friend Yanbai, if you stubbornly defend this place, you will surely face mortal peril when our reinforcements arrive!"

His words thundered in the Maha's ears. In that same instant, Heavenly Light blazed, Valley Water descended, and purple qi drifted through the air. The Maha was stunned, his heart seizing in terror.

'Three cultivators at the Purple Mansion Realm and two Spiritual Treasures?!'

Whether it was Li Ximing, Tinglan, or Qinghu, he, Yanbai, recognized every single one of them! He also knew of the treasures they wielded and did not underestimate their power in the slightest!

Yanbai wasn't blind; he had seen the anomaly at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain and had long been feeling uneasy. He had only remained to observe because Mount Dayang's orders this time had been exceptionally strict. Who could have known that this single moment of hesitation would get him surrounded?

If it were just Li Ximing and Qinghu, Yanbai might still have a chance to defend. But with Tinglan added to the mix, wielding both the Immeasurable Water and Fire and the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion... he had no intention of throwing his life away for Mount Dayang!

'Where is Vast Cicada?'

A shadow passed through his eyes.

'That guy truly is unreliable! He only caught the Lord's attention because of his legacy, but I've always thought he was disloyal! Who knows where he's run off to now...'

The enemy cultivators were upon him, leaving no time for further thought. The massive Golden Body trembled, radiating countless shafts of golden-white light. Yanbai was no incompetent fool. The Golden Body continued to swell, and four marks, like lotus seeds, appeared on its smooth forehead.

'The Great Light-Riding Art of the Dharma Realm!'

The earth shook and the mountains trembled. A heavy, jade-white light erupted from the four marks, weaving together to birth countless illusions on the ground below. It was as if a Buddhist Land had manifested, standing in direct opposition to the purple pavilion in the sky, not one bit inferior.

Sima Yuanli couldn't tell if Yanbai truly intended to fight to the death or was planning a retreat. He descended on his divine ability, frowning and gritting his teeth.

'If he really digs in, he won't be easy to take down. But Vast Cicada and the others have probably already reached Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain. Won't this ruin the entire plan?'

In just a few breaths, the cascading purple qi had already clashed with the golden-white dharma physique countless times. Li Ximing hung back behind the other two, silently gathering the Emperor Qi's Light. He smiled inwardly.

'How the tables have turned. It's finally our turn to besiege the Buddhist cultivators!'

But just as this mystical illusion had manifested in the sky, a streak of crimson radiance swept across it. It was like a sun falling into the sea, exploding in a golden storm. The white giant was caught completely off guard and let out a long, mournful wail.

"Aooo..."

Only then did they see the sky above thick with flames. The flames, heavy as clouds, condensed into a massive pillar of light that connected heaven and earth, seventy-two blazing patterns coiling around it. A tall, middle-aged man in golden robes descended from the pillar, his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes indifferent.

It was Daoist Master Tianque of the Golden Feather Sect!

This Daoist Master rarely took action personally these days. He stood in the air, wreathed in flame, quietly holding a golden ring. His expression was calm, but it made Yanbai's face below turn ugly. Yanbai stared, stunned, for a long moment before finally speaking.

"Zhao and Shu made an agreement: the Huai region is not to be attacked! Since the Golden Feather Sect follows Shu's command, what right do you have to make this unauthorized move east?"

He spoke with absolute clarity, perhaps feeling that West Shu had already broken their promise. But his words made Li Ximing look up sharply, and Tinglan narrowed her eyes. A strange feeling rose in both their hearts.

'An agreement between Zhao and Shu: the Huai region is not to be attacked...'

Daoist Master Tianque, however, showed no reaction. As a prominent figure of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, he not only looked down on Dharma Realm figures like Yanbai, but his strength was more than enough to kill him. He stood with his hands behind his back and said indifferently,

"Dispel your Dharma Body and accept this one divine ability... or I will send you back to the Buddhist Land."

Yanbai stared at him intently. This Maha was no fool. In an instant, everything became clear, and a few words flashed like lightning through his mind: "Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain!"

The moment the words left his mouth, the enormous profound pillar in the sky plummeted, smashing into the heavy white light. A tremendous sound, like mountains collapsing and the earth splitting apart, echoed through the night sky as rings of explosive flame rippled outward.

"BOOM!"

The once-majestic, enormous white-gold Dharma Body instantly disintegrated. A torrent of shattered light and grit rained down. A streak of white light, like a bird with a broken wing, stumbled northward. Daoist Master Tianque didn't hesitate for a second. His gaze swept over the three of them.

"Tinglan, you guard this mountain. You two, follow me to Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain."

Hearing those words, Li Ximing's heart pounded.

'It really is Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain!'

How could Yang Ruiyi have gotten the Golden Feather Sect's support? The answer had to be at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain! Back then, for the sake of Wanling Heaven, the Golden Feather Sect had been forced to sacrifice their subordinates, the Golden Tang Gate, allowing Tangdao Mountain to become a land of Primordial Magnetism. Now that Wanling Heaven had fallen, how could True Monarch Taiyuan possibly ignore this thorn in his side in the Huai region?

As long as Yang Ruiyi went with the goal of resolving the Primordial Magnetism, the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition would certainly support him with all their strength!

Making Yanbai take that divine ability was just to ensure he couldn't return to attack Xiaoshi or reinforce Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain anytime soon! With just a single exchange, these Daoist Masters and Mahas already understood the stakes.

Most of his doubts were suddenly resolved in that instant. All that remained were a few minor, lingering details. Sima Yuanli met his gaze, clearly having reached the same understanding. He immediately followed after the Daoist Master and said with a smile,

"It seems the Great General has solved the Golden Oneness's troubles!"

With the situation reversed in an instant, Sima Yuanli immediately became solicitous. He certainly wasn't going to call it "Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain" anymore. He reminded them in a low voice,

"With the Great Daoist Master present, the situation at Tangdao Mountain is surely settled. But Qi Lanyan still has many men under his command. We must worry about him ruining the Golden Oneness's important affairs!"

Tianque was polite enough to the two of them. He shook his head slightly and sped forward, saying softly,

"Now that he's seen the Manifestations Earth, Qi Lanyan won't come. He's from the Profound Governance, after all. He has read the Classics and knows what is about to happen in those mountains."

Sima Yuanli seemed lost in thought. Tianque then turned to look at Li Ximing, his body blazing with brilliant flames. He raised an eyebrow and said:

"Change in Metal is _Geng_ (Geng). In Wood, _Geng_ (Renewing). In Water, _Lu_ (Pristine). In Fire, _Hong_ (Blazing). And in Earth, _Xuan_ (Manifestation). This 'Manifestation' means to unblock that which is dark and stagnant, to allow the earth and stone to rise up and transform. It allows the Metal to emerge from the Malice, and the Malice to depart into the Earth. To deconstruct the Primordial Magnetism... there is no greater merit."

"Since Yang Ruiyi has initiated the Manifestations Earth, my daoist tradition naturally has every reason to help. Otherwise, if we wait for all the Buddhists to return, they will interrupt the manifestation. The autumn dew will fall on Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, the Primordial Magnetism will regenerate, and it will become an incurable affliction."

His gaze was distant, and he seemed to show little joy at the prospect of removing this long-standing affliction. Li Ximing understood. A pensive look gradually came over his face, and he remained silent for a long time.

'Qi Lanyan, Yang Ruiyi, even Tianque... every one of them is just taking what they need. This entire north-south conflict was a scheme targeting the Buddhist cultivators of Mount Dayang! And the true objective is to resolve the Primordial Magnetism at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain!'

He glanced at Tianque, a suspicion growing in his heart.

'But... was this really the plan from the very beginning? I'm afraid every one of them had their own agenda. It was Yang Ruiyi who pushed the situation to this point, allowing the other parties to jump in and follow the trend. The final price will be paid entirely by Mount Dayang, whose members are disunited and have no high-level support in Jiangbei or the Huai region!'

# Chapter 1074: 1071 - The Pieces Fall into Place

‘Manifestations Earth.’

Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain was originally named Tangdao Mountain. It was a sharp peak rising from the flattest part of the Huai River region, originally surging with a metal-aspected qi that pointed to the sky like a long saber. Later, it was altered by Primordial Magnetism, and its metal qi dissolved, causing it to lose its edge.

When Li Ximing arrived at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, the place was almost unrecognizable. The hills were smooth, without any sharp edges. A rolling malignant qi clung to the ground like a thin fog, breathing endlessly.

‘It lost its sharp edge but gained in height. This mountain is still majestic, even more so than before. It has the feel of a famous immortal mountain.’

His fingertips brushed together, and he restrained the Light of the Six Harmonies, his heart pounding.

‘So this is the way of Manifestations Earth!’

Malignant qi was a substance normally bound deep within the earth veins. It would never surface unless a mountain collapsed, the earth split, or a spring brought it forth. Back when the Li clan moved Mount Qingdu, they had disturbed the earth veins, unleashing a pillar of malignant qi.

But now, the earth and stone of Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain were disintegrating. Though the mountain was imposing, the flow of malignant qi had riddled it with thousands of holes. Tiny, shifting fissures appeared everywhere. Small bursts of silver-black light leaped from the earth veins, scattering the last vestiges of metal qi.

‘Metal emerges from malice, malice departs from the earth.’

Li Ximing was lost in thought.

‘Manifestations Earth has been silent for many years. The few rumors I’ve heard spoke of it being “Adamantine-indestructible and lightning-proof”… Lightning-proof is to be expected. “Adamantine-indestructible” must refer to its ability to vent and release metal qi. By becoming neither hard nor soft, it cannot be destroyed.’

By this time, Sima Yuanli had already been dispatched to scout the area, leaving only Li Ximing and Tianque to ride the wind, landing softly on the great bronze hall atop the peak.

He waited a moment, then quietly tucked his hands into his sleeves. Thunder roared in the sky, and amidst the heavy darkness, a set of bronze steps appeared. Yang Ruiyi was descending. He cupped his fist in greeting.

“Daoist Friend Zhang, you’ve arrived just in time!”

Tianque, who had been indifferent when speaking of the Yang clan earlier, now wore a smile. He spoke with enthusiasm,

“Many thanks, my lord! You have truly resolved a great difficulty weighing on my Dao-heart!”

His words were warm, but having heard his earlier comments, Li Ximing sensed the truth. He knew Tianque was not happy; the warmth was only on the surface.

Yang Ruiyi nodded slightly, a hint of a smile in his eyes.

“I must trouble Daoist Friend Zhang to guard the mountain.”

Tianque didn't hesitate. He raised an eyebrow and said,

“Rest assured, General. In the attack on Zhao, Shu and Song are of one mind. Tianhuo is already outside with Danyin and Duanyan. My uncle, Daoist Master Chunshuo, is also standing watch in the Great Void, holding the Pearl of Cardiac Rhythm.”

His expression was calm and natural, displaying the invisible foundation and pride of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. He continued casually, “With my Golden Oneness and the Highest Azure Daoist tradition making a move together, there isn't a single Daoist Tradition in the world that would dare claim they could take Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain in an instant!”

The Golden Feather Sect was backed by True Monarch Taiyuan. Golden Oneness and Highest Azure were intertwined, their true, hidden depths unfathomable! Those with high talent were taken into their grotto-heavens, while those with strong character were sent out to control various regions. Tianque's pride was not baseless; it was no exaggeration at all.

Yang Ruiyi smiled. He made no effort to hide the conversation from Li Ximing as he sat down in the hall.

“It’s strange that such a major event wasn't enough to disturb Senior Yi Ge. And I don’t see Senior Tiandong—calculating the time, even if he reincarnated… he should have reached the Purple Mansion Realm by now.”

Tianque fell silent for a moment before replying in a low voice, 

“Disciple-brother… he fell many years ago.”

Yang Ruiyi paused, clearly skeptical.

‘Tiandong cultivated Earth Virtue and had exceptional talent. He wouldn't just die for no reason. He certainly wouldn't have been breaking through within the Golden Oneness grotto-heaven when he “fell years ago.”’

There wasn't much more for the two to say. Tianque cut straight to the point, his expression grave.

“When will the metal qi at the summit be completely purged? Do you require our assistance?”

Yang Ruiyi answered calmly,

“There is no need to trouble you. It will be resolved in three days.”

Tianque's expression softened. He said no more, simply cupped his fist.

“Many thanks, my lord.”

He then stepped into the Great Void and departed without another word, leaving Yang Ruiyi standing in the hall with a heavy heart. Li Ximing saw that their conversation had not gone well and sighed internally.

‘The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition is ultimately under Luoxia's jurisdiction; they can’t get close to the Underworld… Even if Yang Ruiyi schemed to force Tianque into this, he still has to put on a pleasant face out of necessity…’

‘Three days… Tianque is also under pressure from Mount Changhuai. Yang Ruiyi doesn't have much time to maneuver, either.’

“Congratulations, my lord, on conquering Tangdao!”

Yang Ruiyi turned to look at him, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.

“Zhaojing cultivated a wondrous art of rebirth!”

Li Ximing froze. He had concealed himself with Sealing the Life-Mandate, yet Yang Ruiyi had seen through him with a single glance. He returned the bow and forced a smile.

“It is merely a trick to preserve a limb. Before your noble clan, it is truly a laughingstock!”

The Yang clan had ties to the Underworld. When it came to rebirth, perhaps only Overseas Penglai could offer an opinion. The rest of Jiangnan wasn't even qualified to carry their shoes. For Yang Ruiyi to immediately identify it as a "wondrous art of rebirth" made Li Ximing sweat.

Yang Ruiyi shook his head quietly.

“My family has an advantage due to our proximity, and we possess one or two related arts. But we also know that few such arts still circulate in the world. To be able to preserve a limb is already extremely difficult. As for true rebirth, it is impossible for anyone who has not seized heavenly fate and walked the path of golden fortune.”

He seemed somewhat emotional as he continued,

“In the entire Yue State… the only one I can think of who has the ability to be reborn safely and enjoy another five hundred years of life is King Wei.”

Li Ximing avoided the probe, sighing instead.

“If there were a Great Dao Practitioner who could reincarnate with every era, avoiding heavenly fate and eluding calamities, what kind of figure would they be today?”

Yang Ruiyi showed no particular reaction, just gave a wry laugh.

“Forget about it before the Celestial Shift. And even after the Celestial Shift… it is exceedingly difficult. The path of rebirth is severely constrained by Exiled Qi, and with no Merging Owl or Upper Shaman appearing in the world… even if the Underworld doesn't interfere, a single rebirth is as hard as ascending to heaven. Even if one succeeds… there are endless troubles. A second time is unthinkable, let alone trying to attain the Dao.”

His gaze swept over Li Ximing, as if searching for something. Having read the "Marvelous Method of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body," Li Ximing understood a great deal about rebirth and knew Yang Ruiyi was reminding him (as Li Zhouwei) of the dangers. He dodged the topic again.

“It seems I was thinking too simply!”

Yang Ruiyi smiled, his expression turning serious.

“I must trouble Zhaojing… The calamity on the lake has passed, but the north still needs your help. I wish to send a Daoist Master to lead troops and suppress Caishan, coordinating with Tangdao and Xiaoshi. After thinking it over, Zhaojing is the only one for the task!”

Li Ximing knew things were far from over; there was no chance he was being sent home. He replied with concern,

“I will obey your command… It’s just… my lord, you must be cautious here at Tangdao Mountain!”

Li Ximing would not be at Moongaze Lake. He naturally hoped Yang Ruiyi could hold Tangdao Mountain securely. If this place fell, Caishan would be in grave danger, and the situation at the lake would become even more troublesome.

Yang Ruiyi nodded slightly, understanding the stakes. He smiled.

“Caishan has already been taken by Daoist Master Chengqian, a disciple of Daoist Master Xianyao from Overlook Peak. Ximing need not be hasty, lest you rush into a trap. Be careful on the road. Whether you meet up with him or encounter trouble, you must report to me first.”

“Your clan’s two young masters are both extraordinarily gifted. I have already petitioned the Emperor to have the General guard the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, while Zhishi and I watch over the Wilderness. This will ensure the lake remains secure.”

He added a warning,

“Your clan's young masters are greatly coveted by the Buddhist cultivators. It is not suitable for them to be at checkpoints like Xiaoshi, Caishan, or Bianyan. I will be in the Wilderness, and as long as Tangdao Mountain and the Wilderness do not fall, the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter is extremely safe. They cannot be harmed in one fell swoop.”

‘Yang Ruiyi isn't guarding Tangdao Mountain himself?’

Li Ximing was momentarily stunned. He quickly stammered his thanks. Yang Ruiyi waved his hand, as if knowing what he was about to ask.

“Tangdao Mountain will be guarded by someone.”

Seeing that Yang Ruiyi seemed unconcerned and was more worried about the Buddhist cultivators trying some unexpected tricks, Li Ximing understood. He silently agreed, retreated from the mountain, and left, entering the Great Void and hurrying away. Not long after, a purple cloud drifted over. Tinglan had arrived.

Tinglan had been unharmed in the great battle and was in good condition. She anxiously entered the bronze hall and bowed.

“Greetings, my lord!”

The great hall was as dark as ever. The only difference was that the previously bare, polished round table now held a golden scroll, painted with five-colored water and fire on a purple-blue background with gold patterns.

Beside the scroll, a ritual implement shaped like a broken sword lay on a jade plate. It was carved with coiling serpents of water and fire, had a texture like gold and jade, and emitted a faint glow.

Facing Tinglan, Yang Ruiyi was no longer as polite as he had been with Li Ximing; he was much more casual. Tinglan reported,

“Daoist Master Hongyan of the Western Shu Ni Clan has arrived at Xiaoshi. I was ordered to hand over the territory, ceding Xiaoshi to Western Shu…”

The situation had forced Yang Ruiyi's hand. He had to concede to Shu, giving one of Huai River's most important towns, Xiaoshi, to Qing Jifeng. While it was a pity, it also distributed the pressure and appeased Western Shu… After all, Golden Feather was, at its root, one of theirs.

Yang Ruiyi nodded slightly, his hand moving as he performed a divination art. Tinglan waited quietly for a moment, but finally couldn't hold back.

“Shanji has requested aid three times… If we sit by and watch, I fear the surrounding areas will be endangered!”

Tinglan wasn't just thinking of his Song State. Her own Daoist Master Wenqing was still fighting at Shanji. If anything happened to her, her blessed land's only promising heir would be lost.

Yang Ruiyi turned his head to look at her.

“They have already been allowed to break out. Take this Tablet of Proclaimed Might. Go to Yufu at once, announce the Emperor's decree, and deliver this item.”

Tinglan was startled. She first accepted the order, then asked, “Deliver it to whom… Please instruct me, my lord.”

Yang Ruiyi said, “When you reach Shanji and proclaim the decree, you will know.”

---

Darkness swirled.

A ball of flame bloomed in the Great Void. Daoist Master Tianque rode the spiritual fire, descending. He saw a Daoist priest standing in the Great Void, wearing a tall crown and white robes, his hands forming a seal, seemingly cut off from the world in meditation. His features were remarkably similar to the Zhang Yun of years past.

“Uncle!”

In the distance, a brilliant golden cloud churned, rumbling with faint thunder. Chunshuo turned his head, but his gaze remained fixed on that golden cloud. His expression was calm.

“What was Lord Yang’s reply?”

Tianque cupped his fist.

“Three days.”

This news clearly brought a measure of relief to Chunshuo’s face. He said in a low voice,

“The Underworld is still proud, unwilling to make things too ugly… Duanyan and I had discussed it and thought it would be at least thirty days. Now… it makes us look petty.”

“With this matter resolved… Tianyi can also focus on seeking the Dao.”

The Tianyi he spoke of was none other than the one known in Jiangnan as Daoist Master Qiushui!

Daoist Master Chunshuo cultivated within his grotto-heaven year-round, never involving himself in worldly affairs, focusing only on his Daoist cultivation. His temperament was naturally more magnanimous. Tianque, on the other hand, was not such a generous person. He just shook his head.

“I think it’s appropriate. It is not the time for contact. Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain is a good move, but even if the excuse is sufficient, we still have to give the Qing family an explanation.”

His expression flickered, and he lowered his head.

“I saw the World's Radiance that Li Ximing achieved.”

Daoist Master Chunshuo immediately turned his head, his focus absolute. Tianque continued,

“It is indeed the one Tinglan had!”

Chunshuo’s expression was unreadable.

“Tinglan? That Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart? So what?”

Tianque nodded, stepped forward, and replied in a similarly low voice,

“Uncle, you have been cultivating in the sect for many years. This is how it is… During the Wei era, the Cui Clan was full of talents, many with outstanding divine abilities. But they lacked one key divine ability—this World's Radiance—that only royalty could cultivate to achieve perfection. So, the Wei Emperor bestowed upon them the Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart, which could ‘supplement deficiencies and observe the hearts of subjects’…”

“But the Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart must be personally bestowed by the Emperor, or cultivated by one of imperial status, for the 'ordination' to be correct. If a commoner steals the scripture, they lack the proper status and cannot cultivate the divine ability. There are also many drawbacks.”

“And the Cui Clan modified it… Cui Niexiang took the ‘Sutra of the Imperial Command for Mortal Awakening’ from Li Guangheng’s mansion and gave it to Li Li. He used this forbidden secret art to perfect the Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart. Although the World's Radiance could then be cultivated, the ‘ordination calamity’ remained, accompanying it always…”

Daoist Master Chunshuo narrowed his eyes. He took a golden seal from his sleeve, tossed it into the air, and sent it to suppress the rolling golden light, stabilizing the situation. Only then did he turn back.

“So this Li Ximing is a Wei descendant. It’s normal for him to succeed.”

Tianque shook his head, hesitating.

“Uncle, you don't understand. This ordination doesn't just require imperial blood; it requires an extremely high status. Back then, when the Liang prince Touba Jun was attuning to the Supreme Yang, it was the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch who ‘dotted’ this World's Radiance for him. Although he failed, it proves that even if one is not a prince, one must be ‘dotted’ by a major figure…”

“But Li Ximing cannot be a prince. According to Tianyi’s deductions, in the entire Li clan, only Li Zhouwei and those few with golden eyes are close enough to royalty to cultivate this art without issue…”

Daoist Master Chunshuo raised an eyebrow, already understanding his meaning. 

“You think someone ‘dotted’ him?”

Tianque said, “I suspect… someone wants to protect Li Ximing from the Bright Yang calamity.”

Daoist Master Chunshuo was silent for a moment, then shook his head.

“I doubt it. If you said Li Zhouluo, I might believe it. What’s so special about Li Ximing? I heard his fire control art is excellent, but what does that amount to?”

Tianque sighed.

“This junior feels this is a bad sign… If the Underworld is already making these moves to repay favors to the Li Clan, it means the Bright Yang losses are far more severe than we imagined. The event may be extremely sudden… it won't be delayed for long.”

Daoist Master Chunshuo pressed his palms together.

“No need to overthink. The True Monarch has long had a plan… Back then, when that boy Zhang Yun requested to assign Duanyan to the Li family, it was the Golden Order that stopped it. Only today do we understand the True Monarch’s intentions. We are but minor cultivators. How can we know the Mandate of Heaven? How can we know the True Monarch's plan?”

Tianque was silent. He had once thought the same as Daoist Master Chunshuo, but after spending so much time in the outside world, his perspective had slowly changed. He shook his head inwardly.

‘Uncle truly has the Highest Azure mindset…’

Tianhuo’s words echoed in his ears. That 'child' was much younger than him, but his words chilled the bone:

‘The True Monarch is certainly immortal. But if we wait for him to arrange everything, what are we here for?’

---

Dark clouds obscured the sun. The world was dim.

In a ghostly domain of the Underworld, countless skeletons and wraiths were piled into mountains. A faint golden light flickered like a weak candle in the gloom.

Daoist Master Changyun stood in the darkness. The thousands of owls, demons, and black crows that had been circling overhead had all fallen to the ground, feet in the air, feathers disheveled. The whistling ghostly wind had stopped. There was only silence.

Large and small holes tore through the pitch-black sky, like a burnt sack, letting in streams of Heavenly Light. Enormous golden-bodied figures stood silently outside the ghost domain.

In the distance, the light of Manifestations Earth shot into the sky, its autumn clouds as white as snow, causing the assembled Merciful One(s) to bow their heads, not daring to speak.

The bronze Underworld palanquin that had been floating in the sky had long since crashed, sinking into the ruins. Bronze ancient lamps lay toppled. On the steps, covered in dents, stood a young monk. His body was of normal size, and he held a bronze alms bowl.

All the golden-bodied figures in the world fell silent, waiting for the young monk to turn his head. His gaze was grim and terrifying as it fixed on the kneeling, battered Mingxiang.

“Great Monk Mingxiang… the one who besieged you for so long… was just a ghost from that bronze palanquin?”

Mingxiang looked heavily injured. His voice was grave. ]

“My lord… Yang Ruiyi appeared, destroyed my junior brother’s dharma body… then grievously wounded me and forced me into a desperate situation! If not for Daoist Master Changyun’s rescue, this lowly one would already be dead! Seeing his plan succeed, he used a ghost to pilot the palanquin and escape in secret… Hidden by Exiled Qi, forget a minor cultivator like me, even my Master would not have seen through it!”

Jiang Toushou had long known that Lotus Temple had its own schemes. He had intended to use Yang Ruiyi’s hand to eliminate them, so how could he admit that? Anger rose in his heart, but he saw Mingxiang’s eyes streaming with tears.

“Under the influence of Exiled Qi, one’s life can be lost at any moment. How could Mingxiang dare to have selfish thoughts! If not for the Treasured Artifact Master bestowed upon me before leaving, my junior brother would be dead! I could only do my best to defend myself, how could I spare attention for anything else!”

He raised his head, trying to redirect the blame.

“Mingxiang was also a victim. Who is it that wishes to destroy our Buddhist cultivators’ Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain? My lord, please see the truth!”

Jiang Toushou had met Mingxiang several times on Mount Dayang. To put it bluntly, he was the only sensible one from Lotus Temple. He was somewhat credible. For a moment, Jiang Toushou couldn't tell how much was truth and how much was a lie. He turned to Daoist Master Changyun, his voice chilling.

“Good… very good. Then Daoist Master Changyun… you are proficient in the Immortal Dao, your divine abilities are sharp. You didn't notice anything either?”

Daoist Master Changyun was, strictly speaking, a member of the Profound Governance Pavilion. He had long since assessed the situation. He crossed his arms and sneered, suddenly opening his eyes. His empty sockets stared at Jiang Toushou as he said flatly:

“I am blind. Is Jiang Toushou blind, too?”

His words were a double entendre. The young monk’s face darkened, but he understood. He laughed from sheer anger.

“Qi Lanyan… what a fine scheme!”

Daoist Master Changyun shrugged, happy to let Qi Lanyan take the blame. He stepped grandly into the Great Void, leaving a mocking, cold voice behind.

“I will be sure to pass on the message!”

The young monk’s eyes grew darker. After a while, a Merciful One hurried up, trembling.

“My lord… Lord Vast Cicada has brought his people back. They have crossed Baijiang Creek and are at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain… The fighting has already begun.”

Jiang Toushou closed his eyes and exhaled heavily, sneering.

“He doesn't dare come see me!”

The Merciful One hesitated, conflicted. He took a step forward.

“Shall we proceed…”

Jiang Toushou suddenly lashed out, slapping the Merciful One to the ground.

“Go where!” he spat. “The Golden Feather Sect is already there! What is there to go to!”

He cursed for a while, then retracted his hand. The face of Tian Langzhi, the Maha Liangli of the Great Desire Dao, suddenly appeared in his mind. His vexation grew, and his expression turned colder.

‘Tian Langzhi’s sudden withdrawal from Long was not without reason… Qi Lanyan isn't the only one scheming against me. The Seven Aspects are almost certainly watching from the sidelines, waiting for my Mount Dayang to suffer…’

The monk stood in place for a long time before finally saying coldly,

“Go to Mount Bianyan.”

---

Shanji.

Wind and clouds gathered at the zenith, water and fire churning. The plains below were a dull, hazy gray. The light of the great array shone like a glass barrier, but it offered no sense of security. A man stood on the mountain, head bowed, motionless.

He was tall, with gaunt cheeks. Though his head was low, his expression was grim. He stood alone, holding a jade pot, as if he had just come to refill the tea. This was the Sect Master of Profound Peak, Kong Xiaxiang.

Beside him, Kong Tingyun sat leaning against a jade table that glowed with white light. She gazed silently at the shifting clouds, not saying a word.

A pale white jade pendant lay on the table, flashing bright, then dark, then bright again.

Even as the battle raged in the southern sky, like a flood dragon tumbling through the clouds, and even as the jade pendant called out again and again, her expression did not change.

But Kong Xiaxiang’s jaw was clenched. He had hesitated for a long time. His voice was low.

“Daoist Master… the sky…”

Kong Tingyun remained silent.

Her gaze was not on the sky. It passed through the dense woods, fixed on the stone steps of the mountain path. Kong Tingyun’s gaze grew colder, her expression more detached.

A young man in blue robes was climbing the mountain. His eyes were bright, his expression leisurely, as if he were on a pleasant stroll. He walked with his hands behind his back, a smile on his face.

When this face entered Kong Xiaxiang’s vision, he froze. The middle-aged man began to tremble uncontrollably. The jade pot in his hand sloshed. A torrent of uncontrollable fear and hatred shot from his eyes.

Bai Ziyu, Daoist Master Yehui.

The Daoist Master strolled forward as if walking through his own courtyard. He glanced at Kong Tingyun, then his gaze naturally fell on Kong Xiaxiang’s face. He suddenly smiled.

Kong Xiaxiang felt a moment of dislocation. Faced with the chief culprit behind Profound Peak’s collapse, the Daoist Master who had slaughtered the most Kong family disciples, the hatred in his heart was irrepressible. But reason told him to hide his expression. He could only force his brow into a twisted submission. How could he possibly fool Yehui?

Seeing him bow his head, Yehui’s face took on a mocking cast.

“Daoist friend, you seem quite at ease. The world is tearing itself apart outside, yet you sit here in peace.”

Yehui was Profound Peak’s greatest enemy; Kong Tingyun naturally had no kind words for him.

But Yehui just smiled.

“Daoist Friend Kong, by order of the Profound Governance Pavilion, I invite you to join me in resolving this crisis and retaking Yufu.”

Kong Tingyun swept him with a cold glance.

“Daoist friend, you may go and 'resolve' it yourself.”

Kong Tingyun was no fool. Gongsun Bei, Helian Wujiang, and Murong Yan were all fighting out there. Why would they need her? The south now saw her as a thorn in their side. If she went out rashly and there was an ambush, it would be aimed at her. Yehui, asking her to "join the battle" under the guise of an order, was clearly trying to test or harm her.

Thus, she remained unmoved, sitting quietly on the mountain. Yehui nodded with amusement. He certainly understood that the hatred between their two families could never be resolved. He tucked his hands in his sleeves and left, thinking calmly:

‘In the end, only one of us can live. I’ll just wait and see how you beg for your life when the north-south conflict ends and Profound Governance discards you like a worn-out shoe!’

He leaped up and stepped into the Great Void. Moments later, water and fire roiled. Jade True light appeared, and flickering Purple Qi rose. Gongsun Bei, wielding a crimson axe, was locked in a fierce battle with the current Protector-General of the Tranquil Sea, Liu Bai, stirring up massive waves of energy.

Of all the kings, only King Wei was under the lightest control, his domain practically a state within a state. He had instead become a land unto himself. The other kings were all constrained and closely watched. The position of Protector-General was comparable to that of a Great General. This Liu Bai, formerly Daoist Master Zhusheng and now the Protector-General of the Tranquil Sea, held a high position in the Song Court. Dressed in armor, he was greatly favored by the Martial Cultivation Star and was a completely different man!

He stood high in the sky, a great banner fluttering behind him, parting water and fire. The rolling radiance of Martial Cultivation pouring down from the heavens converted into wondrous True Qi, amplifying his dharma body and forcing Gongsun Bei onto the defensive.

Liu Bai cultivated the Jade True Dao, which was extremely compatible with True Qi. He was also a three-divine ability cultivator who walked the Way of the Sword. With the amplification of wondrous True Qi, his power was shocking! He not only suppressed Gongsun Bei but even had time to harass Helian Wujiang. If not for him, the minor cultivators from the south would never have been able to trap the Buddhist cultivators in Shanji.

Nearby, Murong Yan was locked in a difficult fight with Ning Wan. This Valley Water cultivator was stronger than Ning Wan, but she was a genius of formations, with an array of white-sparrow-like flags circling her, not to mention that terrifyingly cold blade. Though she was outmatched, her formations shifted endlessly, tying him down.

Every time Murong Yan tried to break through, Ning Wan would immediately grip Great Snow's Severing Edge, forcing him to behave. Realizing the situation, he simply began to drag out the fight.

Even though Gongsun Bei was exceptionally powerful, he couldn't help but curse inwardly,

‘If the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform hadn't been reclaimed, would I be letting them act so brazenly!’

Gongsun Bei was strong, but he was "poor." He couldn't compare to Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition descendants like Tinglan and Ning Wan. Liu Bai, meanwhile, had an exceptionally wondrous jade ring, and he was pummeling Gongsun Bei so badly he couldn't find an opening.

Even so, the south’s position was becoming more and more awkward. The most precarious front was that of Helian Wujiang and Helian Wumeng. The newly advanced Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, Lingu Lanying and Daoist Master Wenqing, were being held off by the battle-hardened Helian Wumeng alone. Daoist Master Xianyao, who had rushed over from the sea, was being pushed back step by step by Helian Wujiang, his face pale and his situation dire. If not for Liu Bai's occasional support, the line would have already collapsed!

But even barely holding on, the situation was no longer a siege of Shanji. The battle had already pushed them back a hundred li, all the way into Yufu Prefecture!

It was at this exact moment that a heavy white light appeared, and a sparse purple rain began to fall. The young man arrived, holding the light, a smile on his face. His voice thundered through the Great Void:

“Eastern Feather Mountain!”

An enormous white mountain materialized, rumbling as it emerged from the Great Void. Ning Wan looked up sharply, her heart instantly turning to ice.

‘Yehui is here…’

The current stalemate was already a desperate effort. How could they withstand the sudden attack of this mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?

‘What’s more… Qi Lanyan hasn't shown himself. If Yehui is here, can Qi Lanyan be far behind?’

She took a single step back, but Murong Yan before her suddenly attacked. The skin-bag he had worn for so long suddenly shed, and the light of Valley Water surged, sweeping away the binding cold qi and rushing straight for her face.

Clearly, Murong Yan had been watching the situation, but seeing Yehui make a move, he assumed Profound Governance reinforcements had arrived and immediately moved to tie her down, hoping for a greater victory.

Ning Wan’s expression turned grim. She decisively placed a hand on her longsword and drew!

A sword of profound white, etched with the sigil of the Supreme Yin rising. Short hilt, long blade, a vision of Heaven and Earth in harmony. Great Snow's Severing Edge erupted, a sword like a star pointed straight at the sky!

*Clang!*

Great Snow's Severing Edge was not a pure Spiritual Sword, but a sword for casting spells and incantations. An avalanche of frigid snow blasted forward. Murong Yan’s expression changed dramatically. All his divine abilities instantly retracted, and a dark gray light covered his body.

‘Sunless Deceit!’

But as all his divine abilities contracted, falling away like a painted skin, the longsword had already shot into the sky. It transformed into a pillar of pure white light that pierced the heavens, slamming into the oncoming flying mountain.

*Boom!*

Pale white streams of qi rolled down like boulders. The light of frozen snow, condensed to its absolute limit, had turned a morbid, dark white. The massive flying mountain was instantly split in two, blasted into dust and smoke in a single move!

The terrifying cold light of the snow even made Gongsun Bei and Liu Bai look over, their eyes filled with shock.

‘Great Snow's Severing Edge… it truly lives up to its name…’

But as Ning Wan, her face pale, paused in the air, the space behind the shattered mountain was empty. Yehui’s figure had dissipated like the wind. He reappeared silently behind the purple-robed woman who was struggling to parry Helian Wumeng’s weapon.

Daoist Master Wenqing’s expression changed instantly. Yehui’s hand was already cupped, glowing with a hazy yellow light.

Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release!

The misty light struck first. Daoist Master Wenqing’s face went white. She coughed up blood, terror in her eyes. Her body felt as if it were on fire, pierced by needles, and a binding power immobilized her.

Yehui was already pushing his palm forward. A torrent of crystalline sand appeared, clouding the air. He formed a seal at his chest, the power of the Western Heaven Plateau gathering in his pushing palm. A wondrous art flared, and six sigils appeared in his hand:

Art of the Six Yehui Vast Poisons!

Yehui’s reputation was not great, but he had also inherited the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. The arts he wielded were no weaker than Changxiao’s. The collapse of the Capital Guard had held him back for years, but over time, he had devised ways to compensate.

The Art of the Six Yehui Vast Poisons had been refined by him for many years. It was vicious and cruel, a powerful art designed to destroy a person's Dao-Profundity and dharma body!

He laughed, “Eat this! It will void ten years of your cultivation!”

His words, driven by his divine ability, exploded like thunder, causing Daoist Master Wenqing’s eyes to dim. Yet, even as he spoke words of triumph, there was no trace of victory in Yehui’s eyes. He slowed his attack slightly, his gaze shifting.

At this critical moment, a speck of golden light shot out, blocking Yehui’s palm!

*Clang!*

A violent sound exploded in the air. Yehui’s figure shattered like foam and reformed five steps away. He held two fingers up and looked forward.

The golden spear was held fast in a man's hand.

This man was eight feet tall, with white hair and beard, a thick waist, and broad shoulders. He wore pleated robes, golden boots, and a sparrow-tail crown. A golden-red saber was strapped to his back. He held the spear in one hand, his face scarred, his eyes grim.

He stood on a cloud of white, coiling mist. It was strange, not like a normal, soft, round dharma cloud, but shaped like a crescent moon, moving like a serpent. Rolling golden malice and autumn dew hung from his robes, radiating a bone-chilling cold.

His face was blank, his eyes like those of a demon, shooting out a sinister red light.

‘Double Destruction!’

A stark white light of profound unity suddenly spread, sweeping away all surrounding divine abilities. The Art of the Six Yehui Vast Poisons melted away like ice in spring, utterly neutralized.

Every divine ability across the battlefield dimmed, their power slashed!

Gongsun Bei, who was channeling Dawn Qi, narrowed his eyes. Liu Bai looked up abruptly, his gaze sharp. Every spiritual sense converged on the old man.

Ning Wan snapped her sword back into its sheath, her beautiful eyes closing as her face paled. Her lips moved.

‘Situ Huo…’

Yehui’s gaze sharpened. He forced a wild laugh from his throat, his eyes blinking rapidly.

“So it's you, old bastard! It's really you, old bastard!”

This was the long-missing Situ Huo!

The Golden Tang Gate Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, a descendant of Situ Tang, the Daoist Master who had been forced to flee overseas… he had finally reappeared! He was from the era just after the Three Yuans. After all this time, he could truly be called an "old bastard"!

His words echoed through the night like rolling thunder.

Situ Huo’s hair was white, his eyelids heavy. He turned his gaze on Yehui, the look still as sharp and venomous as a viper. His voice was hoarse and muffled. 

“The young are truly fearsome.”

But as he spoke, the sky darkened. Torrents of white qi streamed from his robes like waterfalls. Three shadows darted through the folds of his clothes. His pupils turned a dull autumn yellow, staring straight at Yehui.

‘Engraved Stone.’

This Body Divine Ability was known as both Engraved Stone and Golden Beast Plume. They pointed to different Daoist Traditions, but they were the same art, from the same source.

The old man hadn't moved, but Yehui threw up his sleeve, catching *something*. His body sank, and he retreated several steps. As a *crackling* sound was heard, another "Situ Huo" had already appeared behind him, his hand grasping the long saber on his back!

*Boom!*

An earth-shattering explosion rocked the night sky. Situ Huo’s old eyes narrowed. He was already engulfed in an endless, brilliant light. At the same time, the "Situ Huo" decoy vanished like the wind.

Also shaking was the ambient Purple Qi in the sky. A golden scroll unfurled in the wind, and the aspects of water and fire appeared. Tinglan materialized, her expression complex, holding the immortal scroll. She gritted her teeth.

“Situ Huo, hear the decree!”

Those eyes snapped up, a cold light flashing within them.

“This subject is present.”

His appearance was so unexpected it had momentarily stunned all the Purple Mansion Realm experts. But now, all the clouds in the sky had stopped moving, and a single star suddenly blazed.

‘Martial Cultivation's radiance!’

Far away, Helian Wujiang looked up, his heart pounding.

“We can't stay!”

If they had any hesitation about retreating when Situ Huo first appeared, the arrival of Tinglan and the immortal decree settled it. How far behind could Yang Ruiyi be?

Situ Huo stepped onto the water and fire and took the golden scroll from Tinglan. The arm-length Tablet of Proclaimed Might, shaped like a broken sword, fell into his hand.

The weapon seemed to grant him a profound power. Layers of energy settled onto Situ Huo, making him exhale deeply. His eyes brightened, and his aura surged, making everyone look on in alarm. He gripped the hilt of the saber on his back.

The fighting in the sky had stopped. Gongsun Bei also stared gravely at the old man, his spiritual sense trembling in the Great Void.

‘Time to go.’

Was Situ Huo strong? In his day, he was far inferior to the geniuses of that era. The Supreme Yang was at its peak at that time. As the closest blood descendant of the hated Situ Tang, he had retreated in the face of the great tide, abandoning the entire Golden Tang Gate and two other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to flee overseas.

At that time, he was just an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Any random Daoist Master from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition could have crushed him. But now was different. Three hundred years of wandering, surviving the pursuit of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition and numerous other enemies—including more than five mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm experts—and he was still alive, having outlasted them all. How could this Situ Huo be an ordinary man?

What made Gongsun Bei even more wary was Situ Huo plus the long saber on his back—Blood-Omen Tower!

It was one of the five items retrieved from Situ Tang's corpse, the personal weapon of the Golden Tang Daoist Master, Situ Tang!

If Situ Huo had relied on the golden boots on his feet—"Monarch's Lost Sheep"—to roam the world and escape from high-level cultivators, preserving his life, then Blood-Omen Tower was the great fang he had honed for three hundred years.

The only weapon present that could be said to reliably suppress Blood-Omen Tower was Ning Wan’s Great Snow's Severing Edge. But her Way of the Sword cultivation was lacking; she could use its scabbard's power, but not its blade!

*Screee!*

A terrifyingly sharp, piercing shriek filled the air as Situ Huo drew the blade a single inch from its sheath.

The reputation of the Golden Tang Daoist Master, Situ Tang, was terrifying. Some called him an arrogant madman, some said he was blind, some said he failed to accumulate virtue for his descendants. But from his birth to his death, no one ever dared say he lacked skill!

His divine abilities were vast. He had defied the Golden Feather Sect's Immortal Order, treated a visitor from Mount Changhuai with contempt, and killed a Supreme Yang expert over a petty grudge. He was one of a kind. If he hadn't offended the Dragon-kin, who had been forced to intervene and severely wound him, there's no telling what he might have become.

When Situ Huo appeared, the first thing that shocked everyone was not Situ Huo himself, but the memory of Situ Tang's madness!

*Boom!*

The heavens trembled. Yehui’s figure was long gone. Helian Wujiang had also vanished. A stream of lights fled into the Great Void. But the long saber slowly slid back into its sheath. The piercing red light never fully brightened; it just dimmed.

Situ Huo’s hand on the hilt seemed like an illusion. He still stood with heavy-lidded eyes, holding the Tablet of Proclaimed Might in both hands, unmoving. His cold gaze drifted lazily over everyone, and then, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, it landed on the woman in white.

The expression on his old face instantly came alive. His gaze locked onto her face. He smiled, and all his wrinkles smoothed out, making him look ten years younger.

‘Ning Tiaoxiao…’



# Chapter 1075: The Four Seasons

Though his gaze was veiled, how could Ning Wan fail to notice it?

The feud between the Ning Clan and the Situ family was far from simple. The enmity between Ning Tiaoxiao and Situ Tang ran as deep as the Eastern Sea, utterly irreconcilable. His conflict with Situ Huo himself was just as deep-seated. No wonder her face had gone pale!

Situ Tang had plundered and seized whatever he wanted, showing no regard for his descendants and leaving them with a mountain of hatred. Situ Huo was smart; hiding himself away in the vast sea was far better than Situ Nu's fate, who had been caught between two sects, had his Dharma Body shattered by Chi Wei, and was nearly beaten to death in a single breath.

But just as Situ Huo had finally endured long enough to see his day, Daoist Master Yuansu, on his deathbed, had decided to take his frustrations out on him!

That battle had cost him an arm and left him in a wretched state. A man like Situ Huo—how could he possibly not hold a grudge?

Her gaze was tranquil, but her heart was ice-cold. She remained silent.

The animosity between her clan's Daoist Master Yuansu, Ning Tiaoxiao, and the Situ family was ancient and unavoidable. Although Ning Wan had been in seclusion when Ning Tiaoxiao fell, she still understood the situation clearly.

'Back then, with the great northern war looming, my Lord knew his time was short. He made a special trip to hunt down Situ Huo... Unfortunately, that final attempt... also ended in failure.'

Ning Tiaoxiao had been famous in his lifetime, especially for that sharp tongue of his. His abilities were considerable; relying on his spell arts, Dao-Profundity, and the 'Spring's Echo'—which was both a Body Divine Ability and a Life Divine Ability—he had forced countless villains to bow their heads. Compared to the exiled Situ Huo, he was heaven and he was earth. But Ning Wan knew in her heart that in her Lord's later years... he was willing, but the strength was fading.

'The gap between divine abilities cannot be ignored. Sometimes, suppressing even one divine ability can decide a battle. It was my Lord's exceptional talent that allowed him to compensate with his own Dao-Profundity... But eventually, as other Daoist Masters enhanced their own divine abilities, that gap was destined to close, and he would even be surpassed.'

For that final battle, Ning Tiaoxiao had surely made ample preparations. But he hadn't anticipated that Situ Huo would successfully condense his third divine ability. Even though Ning Tiaoxiao still beat him down like a helpless child, the opportunity to take his life was lost.

That feeling—of being slowly caught and even surpassed by mediocre talents far less gifted than oneself, sometimes even by the descendants of one's enemies—must have been unbearable. Whenever Ning Wan thought of it, a chill crept into her heart.

'I heard that in his later years, my Lord's temperament grew increasingly paranoid. He must have known this great threat to his heart could not be eliminated... If the Ning Clan couldn't secure the backing of the Chi family, we would likely face total annihilation...'

Ning Tiaoxiao had no children. In all honesty, Ning Wan felt her elder had already done more than enough. Now, seeing Situ Huo, she didn't feel this was some poison left behind by her predecessor. Instead, she met his gaze with an icy stare of her own, returning it with sharp intensity.

'A homeless cur...'

Situ Huo's eyes met hers for an instant. He wasn't surprised; there was even a flicker of understanding. He slowly withdrew his gaze, his heart as calm as still water.

'It's not surprising. It's only fitting that Ning Tiaoxiao would have such a descendant.'

Even so, he paid the woman no real mind. His attention returned to the Tablet of Proclaimed Might in his hand. Staring at the short, blade-like token, a blazing fire of desire ignited in the depths of Situ Huo's eyes as he scrutinized it.

He studied it, lost in his own world. But the crisis had clearly been resolved. On the Great Song's side, everyone was injured, yet not a sound was made. They all wore different expressions, exchanging glances.

Only Lingu Lanying, whose spirit embryo had been stolen, was unreconciled. She took a step forward, looked at Situ Huo, then at Tinglan, who stood with her head bowed in silence. She could only shake her head, her brow furrowed, and watch helplessly as the cultivators departed.

Just then, Situ Huo returned the celestial edict, and his old hand suddenly gripped the jade blade.

He cultivated 'Engraved Stone', a Dharma Body divine ability that was highly ranked even in the Purple Mansion Realm. The Tablet of Proclaimed Might was not meant for cutting, yet it easily sliced open his palm. It flickered brightly, and thick blood, like molten gold, dripped from the blade, transforming into roiling water and fire as it fell through the air.

'Good...'

The treasure flared and dimmed three times in the air, showing signs of trying to break free, but it was suppressed by the celestial edict. It finally settled upon him, subdued. The old man turned around and said flatly:

"This old man is Situ Huo... I have been humbly appointed as the General Who Pacifies the Huai, and concurrently as the Military Commissioner of Golden Tang. Everyone... I look forward to your guidance in the days to come."

The night sky was still silent. A crystal-clear jade sword slid back into its sheath, stirring up a cloud of dense white mist. The white-robed Daoist Master, dressed dashingly and holding his sword, let out a sneer.

"Looks like this old dog doesn't have to be a stray anymore!"

It was none other than Daoist Master Zhusheng, the one who had fought fiercely against Gongsun Bei and saved the overall situation. Utterly fearless, he scoffed, flicked his sleeves, and departed, leaving only his cold words to echo in the air.

His words plunged the crowd into silence once more. Situ Huo, however, smiled, looking rather pleased with himself, as if pondering something. He took a step forward, swept his gaze over the assembly, and said softly:

"It seems Daoist Friend Liu still clings to old grudges. Not very magnanimous of him."

Tinglan was left speechless and cursed inwardly:

'Magnanimous? How could anyone be magnanimous? Situ Tang wiped out an entire remnant clan of Chu-Liu... The bodies of Chu-Liu descendants who died at his hands could form a mountain! The Blood-Omen Tower is probably filled with their baleful-blood qi!'

This didn't stop Situ Huo's old eyes from roaming, finally landing on Ning Wan's face.

"So, a descendant of Daoist Friend Yuansu... How rare... how rare..."

Ning Wan's expression had mostly recovered, but it remained cold and sharp. She clutched her sword and said nothing.

Situ Huo suddenly laughed.

"Daoist Master Yuansu gave me much 'guidance' in his life. Now that he is gone, all that remains is..."

He put on an expression of not knowing her name and looked around. Only Xianyao took a step forward and was about to raise his sleeve, but Lingu Lanying had already spoken, her voice soft:

"This is Fairy Qiuhu, Ning Wan."

Situ Huo's eyes flickered slightly. He smiled.

"Ah, so it is Ning Wan!"

Beside them, Tinglan's expression was just as sour. This Daoist Master from the Golden Tang Gate had truly terrible relations. In all of Jiangnan... especially among the cultivators represented by the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, there were likely few who felt any goodwill toward the Golden Tang Gate. How could she possibly be in a good-natured mood?

'The chaos in the Golden Tang bloodline was the result of deals between Azure Pond and Golden Feather. At its root, the relationships between Situ Tang's descendants are toxic, filled with sinister and vicious individuals. Situ Huo is a prime example of this, only with an added layer of caution... This is trouble...'

But right at that moment, an old Daoist Master emerged from the group. He wore robes of glazed grass-cloth and had a smile on his face. He bowed with clasped fists, eager to change the subject, and laughed.

"Congratulations, Daoist Friend!"

This was Daoist Master Xianyao from Overlook Peak. The two seemed to have some history. Situ Huo returned the courtesy in a slow, deliberate manner and turned to the crowd.

"Everyone, please guard Yufu. I am heading to Tangdao Mountain to report."

Ning Wan looked up, somewhat dazed. Tinglan, her expression complex, stepped forward with her, rushing to separate the two and explaining in a low voice:

"Lord Yang has already... conquered Tang Blade Mountain! I will go report at once."

She mounted a purple cloud and vanished into the Great Void. After flying a short distance, she turned her head back, unable to ignore the situation completely. She said softly:

"The North is powerful now. Senior, you and Wan'er both serve the Great Song. The old feuds mostly stemmed from Situ Tang. I ask that Senior please let them go... It will not do to disrupt the Emperor's affairs."

Situ Huo's smile vanished. He said quietly:

"Thank you for the reminder, Daoist Master. Ning Tiaoxiao was indeed capable. I even admired him somewhat. Resentment... is not quite the word."

The old man's gaze was calm, and his tone was serious. He was old; his admiration for Ning Tiaoxiao outweighed his resentment. But that didn't mean he wouldn't avenge the humiliation of being hunted.

'He tried to kill me not necessarily because he hated me, but because I am a descendant of Situ Tang. That remains true. If I get the chance, I will eliminate Ning Wan for the same reason: because she is a descendant of Ning Tiaoxiao.'

He rested his hand on the Tablet of Proclaimed Might at his waist, but his mind was already elsewhere.

'The key right now is the Purple Mystery... I have been stagnant for far, far too many years... The light of cultivation is my only chance!'

...

In the distance, illusory colors shimmered faintly. A cold autumn wind drifted by. The steps were bathed in the fading sunlight. Inside the great hall, the bright silver cauldron still stood. Though it was only just the beginning of autumn, the clear water within it had already frozen solid, a sheet of glittering silver.

The hall felt vast and empty. A Daoist Master in white robes sat at the head seat, holding a vermilion brush. He heard footsteps approaching from outside the hall, and a woman ascended the steps.

She was tall, with a refined and beautiful face. A three-petaled white flower was painted between her brows, giving her an ethereal, otherworldly air. She had a high-bridged nose, wore a white dress, and carried a longsword on her back. Her movements revealed a fiery, impetuous nature. She bowed at the steps and said in a low voice:

"Martial Uncle!"

Above, Wei Xuanyin looked up, a trace of surprise in his expression. Before he could speak, the woman before him was already frowning and blurting out:

"Martial Uncle Wei, is it true? We really can't take back Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain!"

Wei Xuanyin pondered for a moment, then set aside the Daoist book in his hand. 

"At least, not right now."

The woman paced a few steps in agitation.

"Earlier, we thought Shu was strong and Song was weak. With King Wei also in seclusion, we assumed the Great Song couldn't stir up any trouble anytime soon, so we moved our people to the Long region. We never expected that while we held that front, we'd end up losing more than half of Jiangbei!"

Wei Xuanyin sighed silently.

"Was Mount Bianyan secured?"

The woman paused, her slight confusion making her features even more vivid. 

She replied, "Fortunately, it was secured. The 'Exiled Qi' has already dispersed. Martial Uncle, you are in charge of the Zhaoyao Four Seasons Cauldron. How could you not know?"

Wei Xuanyin shook his head, staring quietly at the bright silver cauldron. The ice within was unbreakable, reflecting a faint silver light. The master of the Profound Governance Pavilion said,

"The 'Book of Zhaoyao' states: 'Spring resides in the Horn, thus there is growth. Summer resides in the Blaze, thus the cold is released. Autumn resides in the Harvest, thus there is storing. Winter resides in the Mansion, thus there is preservation. Together they mark the year, divided into four seasons, to be cultivated for balance and consumed for spiritual nourishment.'"

"The Zhaoyao Four Seasons Cauldron is indeed a supreme treasure for divination and detection. But the Harmonising Metal, which represents autumn, has entered its embrace-lock to store the Vault Metal. Around the autumn equinox, the cauldron's power is greatly diminished. It is not what it was. I can no longer see clearly."

Wei Xuanyin tapped the table in frustration.

"I told all of you to study it properly. In the end, none of you have learned the true essence. You should have seen this coming."

"How could I possibly compare to Martial Uncle!"

The woman replied, abashed. She thought it over, then asked in sudden alarm:

"Does this mean... they planned this?!"

Wei Xuanyin smiled.

"The Great Song has the Exiled Qi. Why would they need to scheme like this?"

He placated the woman, but his gaze was deep and thoughtful. He stroked the cover of the book.

'The Great Song doesn't need to, but other Daoist Traditions might... On the surface, Jiangbei's interests are aligned... but there are plenty of people colluding between north and south for private gain. Being able to avoid my detection would naturally be best for them.'

He fell silent, but the Daoist Master before him spoke again.

"When I came in just now, I saw Li Jieyi waiting outside... It's strange. Mount Dayang hasn't even rushed to punish him this time, yet he's the one rushing to find you, Martial Uncle!"

"He's afraid."

Wei Xuanyin sighed, but he didn't elaborate on the monk's situation. He frowned.

"Baiyue, I told you to go south and find Lanyan. Why have you returned?"

At the mention of this, Yin Baiyue looked aggrieved. She gritted her teeth.

"What choice did I have? Disciple-brother Qi has been like a different person these past few years since he left the mountain! I went to Xuanmiao Temple to find him, and he insisted I return. He said nothing could touch him, that he would bear responsibility for everything himself... But if something _does_ happen, who in the Profound Governance Pavilion will be able to escape the consequences!"

Wei Xuanyin was silent. He lowered his gaze.

"That child is too impatient. No matter what anyone says, he just won't listen."

Wei Xuanyin was older and had watched these "children" grow up. It was a habit to still call them that. But as soon as Yin Baiyue heard it, she sensed something was wrong. She looked up sharply, her expression changing.

"Martial Uncle, are you..."

Wei Xuanyin composed himself slightly.

"Then you will stand guard in the Long region. There's no need to go east."

Yin Baiyue clasped her hands, suppressing the doubt in her heart. She said, troubled:

"That Situ Huo... The northern families contacted him several times, but in the end, he actually defected to the south... It's truly unexpected."

Wei Xuanyin smiled.

"He's a clever man, or he would have been torn to pieces long ago. What he wants is to seek higher Dao-Profundity, but he's unwilling to abandon his self. He would never casually join the Buddhist cultivators, so how could he possibly come north?"

"His battles in his early years likely cost him a significant portion of his lifespan. Time is now running short, and there are very few things that can help him cross the threshold of the Purple Mystery. It's only natural he would pledge himself to Martial Cultivation."

Yin Baiyue asked, puzzled:

"I heard Disciple-brother say the same... He didn't seem surprised. But... but... Geng-Dui is the private reserve of the Golden Oneness of Highest Azure. Why didn't he join Shu? Why join Song instead?"

Wei Xuanyin nodded.

"That's why I say he is clever... He isn't desperate to ascend to a throne. All he wants is to reap enough benefits in this chaotic world to push his cultivation to its peak. Reincarnation is a slim chance, but if he were to seek the Buddhist path after achieving such power, wouldn't it be a natural progression? He might even be subject to fewer constraints."

His expression was gentle.

"You should all learn from this... Since your minds are muddled and you lack the will to truly seek the Dao, you shouldn't be fantasizing about that final step, about reaching some Lesser Attainment. Do you think a Lesser Attainment is so much easier to achieve?"

"The difficulty of seeking some Lesser Attainments exceeds even that of Fruition Attainment!"

Yin Baiyue hesitated for a moment before replying,

"This disciple is enlightened..."

Wei Xuanyin knew she hadn't truly taken it to heart. He could only sigh inwardly, blaming himself for not setting a better example. He didn't press her further, just waved his hand.

"Hurry to the Long region. And send Li Jieyi in."

Yin Baiyue had no choice but to bow and retreat. A long while later, a monk ascended the steps. He wore light brown monastic robes, and his face was etched with bitterness. He walked to the front of the hall and gave a deep bow.

Wei Xuanyin did not look up. He lifted his vermilion brush and tapped it lightly on the scroll.

"I told you not to go south. And now you've returned, carrying the blame for another's crime."

# Chapter 1076: The Unblemished Robe

The one who had come alone to the Profound Governance Pavilion was, of course, Vast Cicada. He stood in the great hall, sleeves tucked, looking both awkward and resigned.

"Lord Wei Xuanyin was offering sincere guidance... but I completely missed the point!"

When Vast Cicada had first left the Profound Governance Pavilion, Wei Xuanyin, knowing he was bound for the south, had offered a few extra warnings out of respect for the Tao family's kindness. But how could this monk possibly have listened? He had sneered inwardly, convinced that Wei Xuanyin was merely trying to stop him so he could seize the Bright Yang's destiny for himself. Now, returning in disgrace, he finally understood that Wei Xuanyin's words had been entirely true.

Hearing his words, the white-robed man flicked his sleeves and rose from the main seat, sighing.

"In the confrontation between North and South, the game hinges on hidden and open pieces. My North plays the white stones, crushing others with overt power. The South plays black, seizing victory through cunning and surprise. Li Ximing is an open piece; Yang Ruiyi will inevitably do all he can to protect him. To kill him, you must rely on the unexpected. And right now, your only unexpected move is the Precious Tusk Golden Land."

His gaze grew sharp.

"But are you truly willing to part with it? If the Precious Tusk Golden Land manifests on the lake and is suppressed, the Dharma Realm will have every justification to step in. They will undoubtedly reclaim the Golden Land. Can you afford such a gamble?"

Vast Cicada sighed endlessly.

"You see it clearly, my lord. It was only my own petty heart that refused to listen to counsel. The destiny tied to slaying Bright Yang is wonderful, true, but if I lose the Golden Land... it's hard to say who will be slaying whom in the future."

He was here to beg, after all. He lowered his stance, thoroughly debasing himself before finally revealing his true purpose.

"Fortunately... I now have a much clearer picture of Li Ximing's capabilities. My chances of success are greater now."

He bowed awkwardly.

"It's just... is it possible for me to continue serving you, my lord, and remain in Jiangbei?"

The monk understood the situation perfectly. The Great Adoration Dharma Realm wanted him to stay in Jiangbei. However, Mount Dayang had suffered disastrous losses this time. Many on the mountain were already watching the Dharma Realm with suspicion, and someone needed to take the fall. If Qi Lanyan continued to press the matter, and Jiang Toushou filed a formal complaint and shifted the blame, Vast Cicada would inevitably be unable to stay.

The only person who could possibly appease Qi Lanyan... was the master of this Profound Governance Pavilion.

But Wei Xuanyin's expression was calm. He shook his head.

"At the assembly of the various Daos, Fellow Daoist Yao already decreed that Martial-Nephew Qi would have full authority over Jiangbei's affairs, while I would focus on containing the Shu region. Why do you come asking me?"

Vast Cicada, his words blocked, grew even more awkward. He paced anxiously for two steps. Wei Xuanyin sighed.

"Return to Jiangbei. This is a matter you must discuss with Martial-Nephew Qi in person. Go and see him—be bold about it."

Vast Cicada had been thoroughly and miserably outplayed by Qi Lanyan; how could he dare to face him? He was about to beg for mercy, but one look at Wei Xuanyin's expression made him swallow his words, his mind sinking into contemplative silence.

Wei Xuanyin remained silent.

'That martial-nephew of mine is iron-willed on holding Jiangbei. How could he possibly let go of a powerful asset like Vast Cicada?'

'Lanyan has far too few people under his command. His repeated schemes were all designed to make Vast Cicada lose prestige and support on Mount Dayang, leaving him with no more room for error. Only then would the monk be forced to obey his every command... He never intended to drive him away. He's probably even planning to sell the Dharma Realm a favor, bypassing Mount Dayang to ally with them directly!'

Wei Xuanyin had practically raised the man; how could he not see through such a simple ploy?

'To Lanyan, it doesn't matter who hinders Bright Yang, as long as they are substantial enough to reduce the chance of King Wei succeeding in his quest—or even to kill Li Ximing outright. The Buddhist cultivators certainly share this goal, but they are only half-allies. They want the karmic destiny of Bright Yang to fall to their own Dao, not to any other, leading to mutual interference... He is trying to consolidate his power.'

As Wei Xuanyin mused, Vast Cicada's expression slowly cleared. He began to understand where his true path out of this predicament lay, and joy bloomed in his heart.

'No wonder! No wonder Jiang Toushou already sent a message to Mount Dayang, yet Qi Lanyan made no move! I assumed Wei Xuanyin had suppressed the news. So this was the real reason!'

Overjoyed, Vast Cicada bowed and offered his thanks repeatedly before departing in a hurry. His figure quickly vanished over the edge of the Profound Governance Pavilion's vast stairs. Wei Xuanyin watched him go, then rose from the main seat. He lifted his left hand, turning it palm-up to reveal a surface as smooth and white as jade.

A pinpoint of flickering, unstable color leaped from his palm. As it did, Wei Xuanyin's entire form began to change. His shoulders narrowed, his long hair billowed out, and his eyes grew rounder, gradually taking on a dark, grayish luster.

He tilted his head, listening intently for a long time. His gaze flickered, bright and dark. Only when the moon had climbed high in the sky did he finally retrieve a small jade bottle from his sleeve.

The bottle was about a finger tall, sealed with a white jade stopper. With a slight shake, it instantly shattered, releasing a surging, transformative wisp of purple-and-white qi that coiled around his fingertips.

But Wei Xuanyin remained silent, his brows knitted tightly as he stared at the wisp of qi.

'This is the fourth portion... and the last one Fellow Daoist Yao left behind. I cannot afford to fail again.'

This wisp of qi looked insignificant, but its value was beyond words. It was the Flawless Deficient Yin, the material required to cultivate the final divine ability of the Veiled Yin Dao: the Life Divine Ability known as the Unblemished Robe!

In the current era, the lineage for cultivating Flawless Deficient Yin was severed. To obtain this qi, one had to acquire the "Yin-Leap Qi" from the Supreme Yin Dao and convert it through a complex series of transformations.

But the Supreme Yin Dao had been hidden for many years. Every portion of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance was precious, and the Yin-Leap Qi was just as rare. Although a fair amount had been passed down in the Immortal Mansions of the South, the supply was finite. If he failed again... Wei Xuanyin's path to the Dao could be stalled for a dozen, or even several dozen, years.

This terrifying prospect made Wei Xuanyin stare at the qi in his palm, his expression fraught with uncertainty.

The Unblemished Robe was the most difficult divine ability of the Veiled Yin path to achieve. It was once also called the "Robe of Concealed Flaws." If cultivated through the orthodox Daoist Tradition, it could "cover all omissions, smooth all errors, achieve a flawless state, and perfect the yin body." It perfectly corresponded with the concept of consummation, which was why it was meant to be the final ability one cultivated.

Of course, in Zong Chang's Dao Lineage, it was called the "Strange Minister's Boon." It was a crude substitute, really, and didn't even require the Flawless Deficient Yin. Its core concept had already fallen completely into the demonic path, so it was naturally not so difficult to achieve.

'But no matter how difficult it is, it shouldn't have caused me to fail three times!'

Wei Xuanyin was a genius rarely seen in the world. His Dao-Profundity was extremely high. While he couldn't compare to the ancestor, Wei Guanyan, who founded the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, his cultivation had long since surpassed that of his late master, Tao Ping. And even Tao Ping had only failed twice when cultivating the Unblemished Robe!

'Could it be that the Dao itself has changed with the passage of time? But in all these years, Bright Yang has not been restored, and no one else has successfully cultivated the Veiled Yin path...'

This mystery spread like a shadow in his heart. In the end, Wei Xuanyin pulled his hand back. The shattered jade bottle reformed in his palm as if time were flowing backward, resealing the wisp of qi. He placed the bottle on the table, remaining utterly silent.

'...If any remains from the old Immortal Mansions, it is possible the various houses of the Supreme Yang might still possess some...'

---

Clouds drifted through the mountains. The distant tremors quickly faded, and a flurry of white snow drifted down from the treetops, piling up beside the jade benches. Li Ximing stood alone on the summit, pacing thoughtfully.

'The people from Mount Dayang have retreated to Bianyan...'

He paced the summit in disbelief, unfurling the golden scroll in his hand. A few lines of large characters were written across it. Li Ximing read them over and over, his heart filled with emotion.

'Conferred as the General Who Pacifies the Huai, and concurrently as the Military Commissioner of Golden Tang...'

This was no small reward. The title of Military Commissioner of Golden Tang was already on par with Liu Bai's command over the Protectorate of the Tranquil Sea. Adding the rank of General Who Pacifies the Huai on top of that effectively made him the head of the military, granting him control over the entire situation in the North.

With the Buddhist cultivators in retreat and the dust settling, Yang Ruiyi would soon return to the Wilderness to keep a watch on Shanji. Tangdao Mountain would then be handed over to Situ Huo. The entire region, from Caishan to the White River, would fall under Situ Huo's command.

'Cheng Qian, myself, and even Tinglan... we will all be under his command now.'

He gave a bitter smile.

"So, it was Situ Huo all along!"

A man standing nearby shook his head slightly.

"Thinking about it now, it really couldn't have been anyone else..."

The man was not tall and had a reserved expression. His face was fair as jade, marked with a vermilion dot between his brows. The spiritual-light around him was profound and unpredictable, giving him an air of someone truly detached from the mortal world.

This man's surname was Lian, given name Wo. He was Daoist Master Cheng Qian of Overlook Peak, a cultivator of the Whole Pill Dao. Though not old, he was the favored disciple of Daoist Master Xianyao, a Purple Mansion Realm rogue cultivator.

Daoist Master Xianyao cultivated on Overlook Peak and was said to be very old. Li Ximing had heard of his Dao lineage before but had never seen any of its followers in the world. Only after asking did he learn that Daoist Master Xianyao was a rogue cultivator.

'Daoist Master Xianyao never established a sect. He simply raised his immortal mountain high into the clouds, concealed it with a grand formation, and thus isolated himself from the myriad of lesser cultivators. There are no formal disciples on the mountain, only a few pupils and his kin, which is why he is known as a rogue cultivator.'

Although both were called rogue cultivators, Daoist Master Xianyao was far more thorough in his isolation than Daoist Master Changxi. When people cursed Daoist Master Changxi and called him a rogue cultivator, it was mostly an insult; he had, in fact, established a formal Dao lineage, but it was one so insignificant that no one paid it any mind.

Seeing that Cheng Qian was easy to talk to, Li Ximing had asked about his past. He had achieved his Dao around the time the Great Ning Palace fell, making him older than Li Ximing.

Despite this, he remained extremely humble toward Li Ximing. He had originally called him 'Senior' at every turn, and only after Li Ximing's gentle insistence did he switch to 'Fellow Daoist,' though he remained just as polite.

Li Ximing had been at Caishan, which was just at the foot of the peak, for some time now and had gotten to know him.

'This man may be sheltered, but he is exceptionally intelligent. You'd never guess he spent his entire life before the Purple Mansion Realm cultivating on a mountain. After all, one would need a great deal of wisdom to reach the Purple Mansion Realm almost entirely as a rogue cultivator.'

Now, hearing his comment, Li Ximing turned to ask,

"Why do you say that?"

Cheng Qian smiled humbly.

"My old ancestor has some friendship with him and has met him a few times. His spiritual boots are incredibly formidable. They were found by Situ Tang in the First-Layer Mountain. If you're just talking about spiritual boots, probably none in all of Jiangnan can compare. Having held on for this long, he was bound to throw himself into the North-South war; it was only a question of with whom he would ultimately side with."

Li Ximing nodded. He shook his sleeve, and the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body emerged, already perfectly restored. It was whole and complete, pulsing with a faint, deep light, looking even more vivid than it had originally.

'The Supreme Yin Moon Radiance is truly incredible. My Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body has already returned to its peak, far faster than my own body is healing...'

The injuries he'd sustained this time were nearly as severe as those from his duel with Helian Wujiang. However, with the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body absorbing much of the damage, his situation was far better. After the battle on the lake ended and Vast Cicada's group retreated, Li Ximing had immediately consumed a Treasured Star Body-Spirit Pill to prevent any further complications. The ancient pill's effects were excellent, but full recovery was not a matter of a few short days.

'Vast Cicada...'

That monk's power had far exceeded Li Ximing's imagination. Aside from his status as a Bright Yang descendant, the most important factor was the four words Tinglan and the others kept repeating: Precious Tusk Golden Land.

Li Ximing only half-understood what it was, but he had a strong feeling it was related to the Precious Tusk Temple that had trapped him during the fight. It was almost certainly that wondrous art that could pull a person into its multiple layers.

'The first layer was the plaza before the temple. The second was the great hall with the five golden statues. There was an even deeper inner chamber beyond that, but the Xuan-Ox interrupted before I was pulled in...'

The reason Li Ximing had instantly taken out the Prosperous Dragon Pearl was because he had sensed an profound crisis... Tinglan had mentioned this monk was even more powerful in the North. It was entirely possible he had already been restricted while fighting on the lake!

'Vast Cicada will be a terrible threat in the future. I must find out more about this Precious Tusk Golden Land. I heard it was a relic left by the Undefeated King of Brightness... If it could be used to aid the Bright Yang cause, it would be an incredible boon.'

He had specifically asked the Daoist Master beside him, but unfortunately, Cheng Qian knew nothing about it, having never even heard the name. Li Ximimg could only drop the subject. But now that his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was restored, his mind was already calculating his next move.

'The Northern cultivators have retreated and lack the ability to launch another attack in the short term. This might be my chance to get away... perhaps to go overseas...'

He still had another item in his sleeve: a fist-sized, crystal-clear glazed pearl. It was the Prosperous Dragon Pearl given to him by the old Daoist Master of Mount Qusi, which had once sealed the Unfettered Xuan-Ox.

This Prosperous Dragon Pearl had been an immense help in the great battle; its importance could not be overstated. Li Ximing felt strongly that he should make a trip to Mount Qusi to return the item to its owner and express his gratitude.

'Since he rushed to send the Prosperous Dragon Pearl to the lake, he must have known about the power of the Precious Tusk Golden Land and sent it specifically to help me... He almost certainly knows the details!'

On the other hand, Li Ximing knew that no pie falls from the sky. The more eager Mount Qusi seemed to help, the more questions he had.

'It's good that the Mount Qusi lineage is friendly, but I can't let this debt of gratitude grow too large. I must clearly understand their motives before I can decide how to proceed.'

Of course, this was only one of his reasons for wanting to leave. Just as important was the appearance of this new Military Commissioner of Golden Tang, Situ Huo!

'Yang Ruiyi has always treated me well. If I were to personally ask him for leave to step away, he would almost certainly agree. But once Yang Ruiyi returns to the Wilderness and Situ Huo takes command of Tangdao Mountain, things will be completely different!'

Li Ximing was keenly aware that his relationship with the Golden Tang Gate was far from good; in truth, there was significant enmity between them. It was only because Situ Tang had a greater talent for making enemies—having offended just about everyone—that the grudge between them seemed comparatively minor.

Even so, Li Ximing had no desire to be ordered around by him. It was best to get out while he could, before the official transfer of power, to avoid a mountain of trouble later.

And so, under the pretext of entering seclusion to heal, he went into his cave-dwelling. He immediately drew up a golden scroll, stating with great sincerity that his own strength was meager and he wished to borrow the power of Mount Qusi to help defend the Great Song. He sent this scroll into the Great Void, then immediately calmed his mind and focused on his recovery.

'Even if I am not permitted to leave, I must recover my strength as quickly as possible to face whatever troubles may come...'




# Chapter 1077: A Change of Post

The night was grim, the dark waves churning below. A silver light shot through the air, only to halt mid-flight and pause for a moment.

The light resolved into a middle-aged man dressed in elegant, expensive-looking fur robes. Three points of silver light dotted his brow. His hands formed a technique-seal as he casually glanced around.

Liu Changdie had been living more comfortably these days. The Xu Water Demon King, sent by the Dragon-kin, had explained their various plans. Although he still didn't dare set foot on the mainland, he could at least move about the Eastern Sea under the Dragon-kin's protection, enjoying a measure of freedom.

But this wasn't what weighed on Liu Changdie's mind. His hesitation stemmed from Fuxun.

After Li Ximing's warning, Liu Changdie no longer dared to seek out Fuxun casually. In all this time, today was the only visit he had made.

Fuxun's position was, after all, arranged. With no one to restrain him, he lived freely enough, and the Demon beasts under his command were gradually making a name for themselves in the sea. But the wounds on Fuxun's body had taken a strange turn.

Superficially, the injuries had healed, but the insidious damage lingered deep in his marrow, a plague clinging to his bones that he couldn't shake. Fuxun was in misery, constantly begging him to find a cultivator from the Lesser Yang Daoist Tradition to help heal him, which left Liu Changdie speechless.

'In my current situation, I can't even leave the Eastern Sea. Where am I supposed to find him a Lesser Yang cultivator? And I can't trouble Ximing with this...'

He could only set the worry aside for now. He drifted down toward the island, lost in thought, and soon spotted the great isle in the distance.

This island was truly strange. From afar, it appeared flat and vast, with no great peaks piercing the sky. Instead, low hills rolled on endlessly, the terrain sinking lower toward the center, all of it shrouded in a pale gray spiritual mist.

This was, in fact, the world-renowned World's Navel.

He didn't proceed, however. He changed direction and headed for the immortal mountain beneath his feet.

Liu Changdie actually knew a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the Eastern Sea. He had once roamed the World's Navel and formed some connections with the Daoist Tradition there. After achieving the Purple Mansion Realm, he had returned to renew those ties.

He had come again today, first, for some personal matters, and second... because of the Xu Water Demon King's earlier guidance:

'In the eyes of the Profound Maiden, the Qunyi Archipelago cannot simply watch as one favored by the Heaven–Governing falls...'

Those were the Xu Water Demon King's exact words!

Liu Changdie's Dao-Profundity wasn't high among those in the Purple Mansion Realm, but his knowledge was first-rate. How could he not know of the 'Heaven–Governing'?

'The Heaven–Governing is the Encompassing Profoundity. It offers pills to heaven and earth, evolves divine abilitys, calculates the profound order, and observes all eight directions...'

Liu Changdie knew this "favor" must be related to his rebirth. He had survived to this day only on account of the Valley Water Matriarch... which meant he had no choice but to come and build this connection.

He rode his cloud down, soon stopping at the profound mountain on the island's edge. He had a disciple announce him, and immediately, a swath of grayish color emerged, resolving into a person.

The man appeared frail, treading lightly on a cloud. His face was paper-white, but his lips were a vibrant, moist red. His pitch-black eyes stared at him.

"Daoist Friend Liu!"

Liu Changdie replied, "Senior Cang Tiaozi, it has been a long time!"

The Daoist Master gave a light nod and led him inside, asking a few concerned questions about his recent situation. Liu Changdie, however, couldn't detect any special treatment. Once they were seated at the table, Cang Tiaozi stated flatly:

"Daoist Friend Liu, have you come to discuss a matter of importance?"

Liu Changdie knew that this 'Cang Tiaozi' before him was merely a skin-bag cast off by a Valley Water divine ability. That it could walk and talk was already incredible; he couldn't expect it to make specific expressions. He began by inquiring about the recent happenings in the Eastern Sea.

'This is a difficult subject to broach. I'll test him first, then ask about the Valley Water Matriarch.'

Liu Changdie was just trying to start a conversation, but he seemed to have landed right on Cang Tiaozi's worries. The man shook his head.

"It seems you've heard as well... Many Demon beasts have fallen in the depths of the Vermillion Sea. A great Water Mansion Demon King, who had been in seclusion for years, reappeared. Who knows how many rounds they fought, but many Demon lairs were shattered. Those Purple Mansion Realm Demon beasts' divine abilitys were no match for him, so they had to lie low and flee to other seas..."

"This would normally just be a curiosity, but the depths of the Vermillion Sea are unusual. The corpse of the 'Eighth Prince' is suppressed there, making it an extremely sensitive location. That's why this affair has blown up and drawn so much attention."

The name Vermillion Sea (Zhu Lu) didn't just refer to the water's color. The _'Zhu Lu'_ was actually a homophone for 'Execution', referencing the fall of that Eighth Prince. Liu Changdie naturally knew this. But the two places were extremely far apart; it shouldn't have concerned this Daoist Master so much. Upon asking, he saw a pained look cross Cang Tiaozi's face.

"I was refining a Pristine Water treasure there. Now I can't get it back. I have no idea who took it. Someone else gets to profit for nothing."

Liu Changdie never left the Eastern Sea, not even its borders, so he had no interest in this. He smiled.

"Daoist Friend, you are an expert in the Valley Water Dao, with a lineage from the Valley Water Matriarch. You research Pristine Water as well?"

Cang Tiaozi's gaze flickered slightly.

He smiled, "The Valley Water has an affinity for all waters. It's perfectly natural."

Liu Changdie sensed the other's guardedness. He had asked about the Valley Water Matriarch several times, but the man just smiled and brushed him off. He had no choice but to get to the point.

"I sent a man some days ago. Is there any news on the Guanyuan Profound Light?"

At this, the Daoist Master shook his head repeatedly.

"The Gathering Wood Dao is obscure these days. That thing is incredibly hard to find. Of all the items you asked about... there is news on only one. It's a Whole Pill spiritual item."

Joy sparked in Liu Changdie.

"Truly?!"

The reason Liu Changdie had asked this Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the World's Navel was because this place was ancient and held many spiritual items. Furthermore, the Valley Water's healing abilities were second to none. Cang Tiaozi often received favors from others, making it highly likely he would have such things!

When he sent his man, he had not only asked about the spiritual items _he_ lacked and the Vault Metal Dao, but as a precaution, he had also inquired about Whole Pill Dao items—this, naturally, was for Li Que'wan.

Li Ximing had asked him about a spiritual item for Li Que'wan before. Liu Changdie didn't have one himself, but he had sighed in astonishment at the request:

'That's the Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue! It ranks in the top three of all Whole Pill spiritual items. It might be the only one in all of Wanling Heaven!'

Naturally, he was overjoyed.

'The items I needed for myself are too rare. I've been searching for years without success, so it's normal he doesn't have them. But getting news about a Whole Pill item is just as worthy of celebration!'

Hearing this, Cang Tiaozi smiled.

"Why would I lie? The Golden Feather Sect has snatched up most of the Whole Pill spiritual items. You can't find them in normal places anymore. However, there is a Dao Lineage in the Western Sea that also cultivates the Whole Pill path."

"They used to have a Great Daoist Master of the Whole Pill Dao, but she perished abruptly some years ago. Her disciples fell on hard times and have now sought me out, looking to trade it for Valley Water healing."

Liu Changdie understood immediately, though he felt a pang of disappointment.

"I see... I had considered the Western Sea, but certain things happened, making it inconvenient to contact anyone there... To think it would lead back to the Western Sea after all. What is the item?"

Cang Tiaozi opened his palm, revealing a speck of crimson sand that tumbled and leaped restlessly.

"The Vermillion Temple Golden Sand!"

Liu Changdie wasn't surprised. A flicker of recognition crossed his face as he sighed,

"Just as I thought! It's from the Xinggong Terrace, isn't it?"

Cang Tiaozi shook his head.

"It's enough that you know. No need to say more."

The Xinggong Terrace Liu Changdie mentioned had once been a great sect in the Western Sea. It had seen a glorious era; its Great Daoist Master, Miaoqi, had advanced step by step, crossing into the Purple Mystery in her later years to become one of the world's foremost figures.

Unfortunately, turmoil rocked the Western Sea. Great Daoist Master Miaoqi fell suddenly. Another Dao Lineage, the West Mansion Grotto Sect, rose to prominence and, in a great battle, shattered the Xinggong Terrace's spine, sending it into an irreversible decline... This Vermillion Temple Golden Sand was one of the most potent spiritual items held by the Daoist Masters of the Xinggong Terrace!

Liu Changdie had roamed the world, leaving tracks even in the Western Sea, and had known figures from the Xinggong Terrace. He thus felt a certain melancholy. Cang Tiaozi, far more detached, smiled.

"This item lies between the paths of Plainness and Metal. It excels at transforming into a boundless rain of Cinnabar treasure. If you refine it into a dharma artifact or a technique, the benefits will be beyond imagination. It's even better than spiritual water or fire!"

Spiritual water and fire already held value far beyond ordinary items. By using them as a comparison, Cang Tiaozi was stressing the item's worth. Liu Changdie quickly took a jade box from his sleeve and showed its contents to the Daoist Master, but Cang Tiaozi just shook his head.

"I am only interested in the One-Qi White Globe Stone!"

This put Liu Changdie in a bind. The One-Qi White Globe Stone he possessed was meant to be traded for the Guanyuan Profound Light. How could he use it now?

'But if I don't use the One-Qi White Globe Stone, he's barely interested in my other items. I'd have to add much, much more to make the trade...'

He hesitated, opening his mouth and closing it, unable to speak. Even if he treated the Li family as his own, this was an extremely precious item, the culmination of his savings. He couldn't make such a decision in an instant. After a moment, he said,

"Please, Senior, hold onto this item for me. I must go and raise the funds... or ask around. I will find items of equivalent value to exchange for it."

Cang Tiaozi naturally agreed and saw him out of the mountain. Liu Changdie grabbed his hand, pleading repeatedly,

"This junior knows Whole Pill spiritual items are scarce, and many Dao Lineages are searching for them... but this item is of the utmost importance to me. Please, hold it for me. I will return to trade for it soon!"

---

In the mountains, summer leaves fell, and autumn's gold returned. Inside a deep cave-mansion, two jade boxes sat on a stone table, gleaming under a ray of Bright Yang light. The Daoist Master seated within slowly exhaled and opened his eyes.

He stood and shook out his sleeves. His injuries were more than halfway healed, and his aura showed no visible fluctuations. This was clearly not what Li Ximing had expected. He pinched his fingers to calculate and was slightly stunned.

'More than a year has passed since I sent my message to Yang Ruiyi...'

Li Ximing was a little disappointed, guessing that Situ Huo had already taken control of Jiangbei and that his own escape was now a problem. But he had been prepared for this, so he didn't show his dismay.

'I'll have to find another chance...'

The jade stone in his sleeve buzzed incessantly. Li Ximing quickly strode out of the cave-mansion. Sure enough, Daoist Master Cheng Qian was standing outside, pacing back and forth. He smiled upon seeing him. His first words were,

"Congratulations, Daoist Friend!"

Li Ximing paused.

"What is there to congratulate?"

Daoist Master Cheng Qian gestured for him to come out, bowing his head with a smile as he explained,

"News has come from the mountain. It’s about a change in our garrison posting!"

He unfurled the golden scroll in his hand and passed it to Li Ximing. A few dozen words were written clearly on it. The gist was... Daoist Master Xianyao and Sima Yuanli were to come to Caishan. Li Ximing and Daoist Master Cheng Qian were to depart immediately for Jinghai to quell a Demon uprising.

Cheng Qian explained:

"Much of the Shaman Kingdom to the south has already been destroyed, and the region is in chaos. With Daoist Master Zhusheng having come north, those Demon Kings are no longer suppressed. They've been shamelessly testing our borders... That's why we've been ordered to go!"

If this had been a year ago, Li Ximing would have smiled, knowing Yang Ruiyi had done him this favor. But a full year had passed, leaving him somewhat baffled. He suppressed his doubts, bowed, returned the scroll, and stepped out. As expected, Xianyao and Sima Yuanli were waiting.

The two groups didn't say much. They bade each other farewell, mounted the wind, and plunged into the murky Great Void, speeding south.

Once clear of the mountain, Daoist Master Cheng Qian seemed to relax considerably. Li Ximing also breathed a sigh of relief. Finding a moment, he frowned.

"A reassignment for no apparent reason... Has the situation changed this past year?"

Daoist Master Cheng Qian said,

"You were in secluded cultivation healing your wounds, so I dared not disturb you... But while things have been quiet, Caishan only faced one or two probes from a Merciful One—seemed like they wanted to find out who was stationed here. Tangdao Mountain, however, has seen major events."

Li Ximing shot him a questioning look. Daoist Master Cheng Qian continued:

"Just after you entered seclusion, news came. Military Commissioner Situ blocked the northern army and arrived at Tangdao Mountain. But then he was suddenly ordered south to the Song Court for an audience with the Emperor. He's been there for months... so the General... had to remain in the north."

His words set Li Ximing to thinking. He understood at once.

'Yang Ruiyi couldn't return to the Wilderness... He's been stuck guarding Tangdao Mountain...'

"What was General Yang's reaction?"

Daoist Master Cheng Qian said,

"I heard of no reaction. But rumors are spreading privately that the north is planning another major move. They are determined to retake the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain... That must be why General Yang was ordered to remain."

Before Li Ximing could speak, Cheng Qian continued with a faint smile:

"Normally, being summoned back is just a formality, a ritual of paying respects. But Military Commissioner Situ just... _didn't_ come back. He stayed at the Imperial Court for a long time, petitioning the Song Court to gather the surviving blood descendants of the Situ family and allow him to re-establish his clan."

Li Ximing narrowed his eyes, realizing Situ Huo's intention.

"And how did the Monarch answer him?"

Daoist Master Cheng Qian appeared very polite, his own stance unreadable.

"The Situ family has long had no direct line. However, after a careful search, it was discovered that when Tangdao Mountain collapsed, the Purple Smoke Blessed Land took in a group of a Situ branch family. They are still in Yufu and have already been granted to Senior Situ."

He sighed with emotion.

"The whole affair took a year. Senior Situ only arrived back at Tangdao Mountain a month ago. Our reassignment must have been ordered by Lord Yang just before he left."

Li Ximing heard this, made some quick calculations in his mind, and remained silent for a long time.

'The true Situ direct descendants are still in the hands of the Buddhist cultivators. Situ Huo has become a hot commodity in the south, which means the karmic value of those descendants has skyrocketed...'

As he was pondering, he saw Cheng Qian turn to him with a serious expression. 

"My thanks, Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing paused, turning to look at him.

'So he knows he's benefiting from my connection... no longer having to guard Caishan. With everyone injured, whoever guards the northernmost point is the most likely to meet disaster... He's sharp.'

He chuckled and shook his head, not answering directly. Instead, he smiled.

"When we reach the Southern Sea, I have some personal matters to attend to. I may have to trouble you, Daoist Friend Cheng Qian."

The young man gave him a thoughtful look and quickly replied, "Lian understands! Please, Daoist Master, do not worry!"

His injuries were much better, and he was free from Caishan. Li Ximing's mood improved greatly. He took a talisman from his sleeve and sensed it with his Life Divine Ability.

"Qusi... still further south."

# Chapter 1078: Diyan

The Southern Sea was vast and its waves turbulent. Beyond the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, which was encircled by islands, and past the strait between Songzhou and Danrong Wuluo, lay another sea, eight hundred miles wide.

Peaks jutted from this sea, with a few small islands dotting its northern reaches, very close to Danrong Wuluo. Guo Nanwu's clan was established here. His family line was thin, so he had recruited many rogue cultivators. The grand formation they were building was just taking shape, and the area bustled with activity.

Li Ximing did not see him there. Past this island, the mountains pressed closer together, narrowing the waters into a river-like channel. Even at its widest, it was merely a series of small, interconnected lakes, stretching barely a dozen miles across. This region was called the Southern Anchorage Sea, though it resembled a continent more than a sea.

Mount Qusi was located in this Southern Anchorage Sea.

Li Ximing had made inquiries before arriving. This place once had much more water, and the sea level hadn't been so low. It used to resemble the Crimson Reef Island to the north. But after the water level dropped twice, it looked even more like a landmass. Consequently, many cultivators who traveled here now referred to it as the Southern Anchorage Continent.

This was his first time here, and his first time crossing the long, narrow Danrong Wuluo. He looked around with a sense of novelty, noticing the lush, green mountains were home to many immortal cultivators and Daoist practitioners. Most resided in immortal palaces and halls. Fairies of stunning beauty were often seen flying among the peaks. In a Southern Sea teeming with Buddhists and demons, this place was truly a paradise apart from the world.

At its very center, Mount Qusi coiled like a magnificent beast, its strange, rugged stones piercing the white clouds that wreathed it. Immortal pavilions dotted its slopes. The Daoists entering and leaving all wore dark purple robes, their attire and adornments identical to those from the north.

'Mount Qusi follows a Great Dao of upholding righteousness, balancing yin and yang, and harmonizing water and fire. Many of its disciples cultivate the male and female principles, yin and yang... It truly has the atmosphere of an immortal sanctuary.'

He paused among the mountains and politely made his inquiry. Immediately, a white wind swept out from the peaks, solidifying before him into a man in long robes. His features were proper, and he smiled warmly.

"Senior, you've found your way here!"

"So, it's Nanwu..."

Li Ximing nodded to Guo Nanwu, only to realize another person had emerged with him. This man was far more handsome, dressed in an azure Daoist robe with profound patterns, a vermilion mark on his brow, and the Black Cloud Silver Sparrow Bottle hanging from his waist. He looked dashing and carefree, smiling as he spoke.

"It's been a long time!"

It was Daoist Master Xuanyi.

Both men belonged to the Mount Qusi faction, so their presence here was not surprising. After Li Ximing greeted them, Guo Nanwu smiled.

"Senior, please follow me inside!"

Guo Nanwu had spent years running errands for the Li Clan, and Li Ximing had never treated him unfairly, refining every pill he requested without complaint. Compared to Daoist Master Xuanyi's polite courtesy, Guo Nanwu's demeanor showed a clear measure of gratitude and warmth. He immediately led Li Ximing inside, descending into a magnificent palace.

On a jade table, black and white stones were scattered in a complex pattern, and steam curled from cups of tea. A game was clearly at a critical juncture. Two beautiful women came forward, collected the game board, and departed. Daoist Master Xuanyi turned to give instructions.

"Nanwu, hurry and call your sister Xinyu back!"

Understanding dawned on Guo Nanwu, and he left with a smile. Li Ximing, however, gleaned a great deal of information from that single sentence. He sat down, lost in thought.

'The relationship between these families is even closer than I imagined... Guo Nanwu almost acts like a junior disciple of the sect... And Daoist Master Xuanyi, despite belonging to the Mount Jingyi Dao lineage, clearly holds significant influence here.'

The two sat. Daoist Master Xuanyi seemed somewhat melancholic. He poured the tea and said,

"Kuang Yu is currently in Tongmo Prefecture, Yu Province. It will take her some time to return. I must ask Daoist friend to wait."

Li Ximing was puzzled.

"Tongmo?"

Daoist Master Xuanyi sighed.

"You may not know, Daoist friend... The other day... a torrential rainstorm inundated Yu Province. The flash of water was so intense, the phenomenon so vast it covered several regions, reaching a point where a Purple Mansion Realm expert was needed to suppress the celestial phenomenon. We later heard news that someone from the Chen Clan perished while failing to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. His name was... Chen Xuanyu."

Li Ximing's heart clenched. He closed his eyes, as if recalling something.

"Chen Xuanyu?"

He remembered that swordsman. They had fought side-by-side to kill Wang Fu. Though they had only met once, he had left an excellent impression. Chen Xuanyu was, without question, the leader of his generation in the Chen Clan, their most outstanding junior in a century. His status in the Chen Clan was identical to Li Zhouwei's former status in the Li Clan—the undisputed pillar of the next generation!

Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin, had mentioned him before. While not effusive with praise, it was clear he held Chen Xuanyu in high regard. For him to die so suddenly was a devastating blow. Li Ximing frowned, perplexed.

"He had been in seclusion for a long time. Logically, he should have already passed the most dangerous period. How could he fall at this juncture..."

Daoist Master Xuanyi's expression dimmed. He shook his head.

"It seems Daoist friend went into seclusion immediately after your great battle... While you were on the lake fending off Vast Cicada, the Shu State to the west was not idle. An army marched from the Huayan Three Prefectures to attack Yu Province."

"The one leading the army was Daoist Master Shen Sou of the Miao Province Sun Clan, the head of the Nine Surnames of Wu State. He was assisted by Daoist Master Shangguan Mi of the Shangguan Clan. Daoist Master Shen Sou and the Chen Clan have been at odds for a long time, nursing old grievances. He seized the opportunity of leading a great army to use the 'Unfathomable Water and Fire' to destabilize the Great Void over Tongmo..."

Li Ximing understood the gist of it. Chen Xuanyu had greatly admired his younger brother, Li Xijun, and had even invited him for a visit. He hadn't expected his brother to die suddenly. Chen Xuanyu had even come to pay his respects, which left Li Ximing with a very favorable impression of the swordsman. A pang of regret struck him as he listened to Daoist Master Xuanyi continue.

"The 'Unfathomable Water and Fire' is also a True Qi treasure, but its effect on the Great Void is even greater than the 'Immeasurable Water and Fire'... It forced the venerable Daoist Master Chen to expend his own vital energy to repel the man. After Daoist Master Shen Sou withdrew, there were no further disturbances. They thought the crisis had passed, and he was secretly relieved. But they never expected that a year later... that junior ultimately couldn't hold on."

"He actually managed to hold on for an entire extra year..."

Li Ximing fell silent. After a long moment, he said,

"His fate was just not strong enough. It's the same as Senior Cheng Gao."

Daoist Master Xuanyi didn't elaborate. As was his custom, he untied the jade bottle from his waist, tossed it lightly, and released Bai Yinzi to serve them tea. Li Ximing knew this was partially a gesture to prove his innocence. He asked a few perfunctory questions, listening as Bai Yinzi smiled and said:

"This humble one now keeps busy inside the bottle for the Daoist Master, mostly gathering and absorbing qi, divining fates, and refining spiritual light. My life-mandate is secure, which is already a wonderful outcome."

Li Ximing replied casually, then cut straight to the point.

"Is the Venerable Daoist Master in the mountains? I've come this time specifically to pay my respects and express my gratitude."

Daoist Master Xuanyi was not surprised.

"The elder spends all his years cultivating in the mountains and never goes out. He's locked within the Profound Chamber, and it's difficult for even us to see him... We need Kuang Yu to request an audience."

"After all, Xinyu is his blood descendant, and some matters are their clan's internal affairs. I have already left the Southern Anchorage Sea with my Master to establish my own Dao Lineage, so it's not proper for me to disturb him rashly."

Seeing Li Ximing nod and sip his tea, he added with a candid smile, 

"Furthermore, the Venerable Daoist Master's presence is... extremely heavy. I... don't really dare to bother him."

Hearing this, Li Ximing suspected this Venerable Daoist Master Diyan was likely not in good condition. He replied calmly. Before he could say more, Daoist Master Xuanyi, as if he had been hesitating for a long time, asked:

"Zhaojing... after Tingyun achieved the Dao, has she... has she sought you out?"

Li Ximing paused, sensing something.

He sighed, "Of course not... From what I can see, she is no longer in control of her own actions."

Daoist Master Xuanyi looked anxious.

"My disciple... Kong Gumo... she hasn't asked about him even once. After she emerged from seclusion, she heard that Gumo remained completely silent during the entire Profound Peak crisis. He even turned away the messengers sent to ask for aid. She was furious. She had him struck from the clan register, declaring that the disciples of the Kong Clan should never see him again!"

Years ago, when Daoist Master Changxi fell, one of the contingency plans he'd laid was to have Kong Gumo enter the Mount Jingyi sect. Daoist Master Xuanyi, coveting the Yuezhou Island and being at odds with Yehui, had specially accepted him.

'Now it's become a problem!'

Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then asked,

"How did Kong Gumo reply?"

Daoist Master Xuanyi shook his head. "He just laughed, tossed the letter aside, and went back to his cultivation."

Li Ximing met his gaze and raised an eyebrow.

"This is also a bond of friendship. No matter what happens to the Kong Clan in the end, it shouldn't affect your disciple. I hope, for the sake of your master-disciple relationship and the Kong Clan, you will continue to protect him."

Li Ximing knew, of course, that Kong Tingyun wasn't the type to make such a drastic move. This so-called severing of ties and removal from the ancestral hall was merely a ploy to shield the junior from the fallout. He still cherished the old friendship between Kong Tingyun and his own elders, so he offered these words of counsel.

Daoist Master Xuanyi understood his position and no longer tried to hide his feelings. He let out a deep sigh.

"How could I not see it? ... When Senior Kong came to me back then, she had only one request: whether the mainland was drowning in blood or the Kong Clan emerged unscathed, I was to ignore it and teach Kong Gumo to sever all ties. At the time, she even tempted me, saying that if I protected Gumo, he might be able to fight for the Kong Clan inheritance in the future, just to spite Yehui... But Gumo has cultivated on my mountain for many years. It's impossible to say there's no emotional bond."

A shadow of worry gathered on his brow.

"I originally intended to protect him and let him sever those ties. But I never expected... I went into seclusion for just a few short years, and when I came out, he was already in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, cultivating the 'Converging Water' art!"

Li Ximing's mind suddenly cleared, and he grew vigilant. He hesitated.

"Daoist friend, you mean..."

Daoist Master Xuanyi paused, then said with some difficulty,

"Based on my understanding of his aptitude, as the most talented disciple of his generation in the Kong Clan, his willpower is strong. He has a hope of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, but it's not a large one. And I don't have the spiritual item for the 'Converging Water' art to give him... But I'm thinking about Kong Tingyun... She may not want Gumo to seek a divine ability..."

"And even if he _does_ seek this divine ability and fails to break through, what will Kong Tingyun think of me? I'll never be able to clear my name. How would she know I didn't secretly interfere?"

Li Ximing held his breath, understanding his dilemma. Daoist Master Xuanyi hesitated, then whispered,

"I was rather hoping you could meet with her on my behalf..."

He finally lowered his head, sipping his tea in silence, his mind heavy. But the matter of Chen Xuanyu had reminded Li Ximing of Li Xijun. The two discussed some Daoist theories, and the atmosphere grew somber.

Fortunately, time passed quickly while they discussed the Dao. A gray-white cloud was seen descending rapidly among the peaks. A woman riding the wind landed before the palace and hurried inside. The deep worry that had been on her face vanished, replaced by a smile. The blue-purple light in her eyes flickered.

"Ximing, you're here!"

Li Ximing quickly stood up and smiled.

"You've mentioned it several times... If I didn't come soon... I was afraid you'd start to blame me."

Kuang Yu beamed at the sight of him, crossing her arms.

"So, you're blaming me for being petty."

Kuang Yu had the liveliest personality, and her words were playful. Her retort left him momentarily speechless, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Daoist Master Xuanyi, meanwhile, stood with his hands behind his back, looked between the two, and shook his head with a smile as he walked out. Guo Nanwu had just stepped back over the threshold, looking confused, only to be grabbed by the shoulder and led back out by him. Only Daoist Master Xuanyi's laughing voice drifted back:

"Please, take your time! I'll go with Nanwu to check on the grand formation!"

As soon as the two were gone, Kuang Yu naturally led him deeper inside. The smile vanished from her face, and the worry she'd had before returning resurfaced. She spoke in a low voice.

"I just returned from the Chen Clan... I'm sure you've heard. But I also saw Sister Tinglan... She..."

Li Ximing frowned.

"Tinglan?"

Kuang Yu pressed her lips together.

"Daoist Master Chen Yin is devastated. I heard he coughed up blood the moment the celestial phenomenon appeared. Sister Tinglan and I happened to be nearby, so we went together. But... the Venerable Daoist Master Chen claimed his injuries had not recovered and refused to see her."

This silenced Li Ximing. A troubling thought surfaced in his mind.

'Tinglan is guarding the Mushroom Forest Plains...'

Mount Dali was the natural barrier between the Shu and Song states. The Mushroom Forest Plains, located behind Mount Dali, could reinforce Tongmo to the south or Moongaze to the north. Yang Ruiyi had stationed Tinglan there precisely to support either side at a moment's notice... And the first place Tinglan had raced to support was Moongaze Lake...

'Which means Chen Yin was left with no assistance.'

A bitter taste filled Li Ximing's mouth, but he didn't know how to respond to her. He could only walk forward in silence, heading deeper into the mountain. They soon arrived at a high platform where clouds and wind converged. Sixteen long staircases ascended it from each of the four cardinal directions, and the opposing forces of water and fire, yin and yang, bloomed with a hazy, multicolored light.

Kuang Yu bowed, produced a talisman, and floated it toward the high platform as a formal request. A moment later, a woman descended from the platform. She was beautiful, draped in a misty red gauze that hinted at the snow-white skin beneath. She whispered,

"Daoist Master Zhaojing, please follow me."

Kuang Yu smiled and nodded at her, then stepped aside. Li Ximing already sensed something was wrong. He discreetly sized up the woman before him and braced himself, following her forward.

The sixteen steps passed in an instant. At the top of the platform, a middle-aged man was sitting cross-legged. He was quite handsome, and his eyes were tightly closed, as if in silent cultivation. He was likely a capable junior.

The main hall beyond was deep and dark, lit by thirty-two tall bronze lamps. Each lamp was tall and branched, with two or three smaller lamps perched on each branch, swaying like small birds. He took another step forward and looked up.

A young man was standing on the high seat!

He was tall and powerfully built, handsome and unrestrained. He wore no opulent robes, only a simple, thin white robe, open at the front to reveal his strong chest and abdomen. A long, wide sash was tied at his waist, its ends trailing on the floor like a coiling golden snake.

He was fully focused on adjusting the wick of a bronze lamp, his profile to the hall entrance. The flickering light cast his nasal bridge in sharp, high relief. His eyes were the color of dark gold, as if forged from bronze.

Li Ximing was stunned.

'Diyan... This Great Daoist Master is no simple character.'

After all, both Guo Nanwu and Daoist Master Xuanyi had spoken of him as a "Venerable Daoist Master," making him sound benevolent and near the end of his lifespan. Li Ximing had been expecting an old man like Lingdu. This sudden disparity was jarring. The young man turned his head. In the dark hall, his bronze eyes seemed demonic. He smiled.

"And who might you be, standing there in the hall? Come in and speak."

"Junior Zhaojing of Ting Province, greets Senior Diyan!"

Li Ximing stepped inside, his heart thumping. He felt a vague sense of discomfort.

This place felt like being trapped within sweltering earth veins. The flickering bronze lamps were like springs of terrestrial fire, forcefully spewing dawn light thick with Molten Fire. The light was almost tangible, brushing against his cheeks with the metallic clang of striking iron.

This Great Daoist Master... cultivated 'Dawn Qi'. Dawn Qi and Bright Yang were incompatible, so the aura naturally made him extremely uncomfortable.

Li Ximing froze for that brief instant, his heart pounding. Diyan, however, stepped down from the dark red radiance. His eyes, like burnished bronze, fixed on him.

"The title of 'Senior'... I dare not accept it. My surname is Yin, and my given name is Huan. If Your Highness must address me, it would be better to use my name."

Li Ximing then understood that his first "殿下" (dianxia) was indeed meant as "Your Highness." Before he could say more, the Great Daoist Master had already turned and led him into the depths of the hall. He sat on the steps below the main throne and gestured.

There wasn't a single jade table or chair in the entire magnificent hall. Li Ximing had no choice but to sit with him. Daoist Master Diyan smiled.

"It has been many years since I've seen an Imperial Descendant. How have we become so estranged?"

Li Ximing looked up, startled. Daoist Master Diyan was staring straight at him, his level voice cutting through the dense Dawn Qi light.

"The former Immortal Emperor Gong Xu slew Tu Shuyang, taking his scaled armor and his two _bo_. He left a descendant, enfeoffing him in the land of Li. Thus, he was named Boli. His heir rendered great service in pacifying the Long region to the west, so King Zhou granted him domain over Guanlong, to rule the Six Surnames, becoming Wei."

The intense dawn light crashed down. Diyan continued in a haunting voice, 

"The Six Surnames warred against the other states, accumulating merit. My Yin Clan was one of the Six Surnames. My ancestor, Yin Ni, was granted the title of King Zhaoming and cultivated the Dawn Qi Dao."

Most of Li Ximing's confusion was instantly resolved. He remained silent for a long time.

'So what?'

'The Wei State has been destroyed for years. The Long Wei, the Donghuo... which of them wasn't stronger than the solitary Li Zhouwei? Those who were loyal have already shown their loyalty! Even the Cui Clan, which was once granted the position of two True Monarchs, hesitated and watched from the sidelines. If Li Zhouwei hadn't personally paid them a visit, they would still be observing... What of the other so-called Six Surnames?'

'As a Great Daoist Master, he couldn't possibly be unaware of the conspiracies between the north and south. He must know of Mount Luoxia's plans. If he truly holds any loyalty, it should be to the Wei Emperor. Why would it fall to me?'

In his current situation, encountering an old acquaintance of the Wei State only made Li Ximing more wary. He remained respectful on the surface.

"So we are old friends from our ancestors' time. Junior is endlessly grateful that the Great Daoist Master still remembers these old ties."

Diyan seemed unsurprised. He stared at him quietly and smiled.

"It seems the Cui Clan talks a big game, but ultimately amounts to nothing... That's normal, too. Yangya is a reclusive coward. He would never dare to get close to you. It seems he has thoroughly disappointed Your Highness."

Li Ximing couldn't discern his intentions and didn't dare to be careless. He stood up and said in a low voice,

"Senior misunderstands!"

He spoke solemnly.

"The Bright Yang lineage has suffered many setbacks, rising and falling three times. The Cui Clan has been loyal and filial, aiding us with all their strength all three times, exhausting their foundation to the point of bare survival..."

"Even so, when I went to pay my respects, the Cui Clan was still generous, taking out their cultivation arts for me. They have already done everything they possibly could! Later, when Daoist Master Yangya recalled his clan disciples... he had no other choice."

Li Ximing intentionally said a little extra, trying to test the Great Daoist Master's reaction. As expected, the man's face, which had been as placid as an old well, shifted the moment he finished speaking. His brow twitched.

Diyan's eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of emotion—anger like a raging current beneath ice—surfacing for just an instant. His tone turned cold.

"Cui Yushan has some nerve."

His words were light, but they caused the bronze lamps throughout the hall to flicker, and a terrifying aura began to emerge. Li Ximing broke out in a cold sweat, a dreadful guess flashing through his mind.

'I heard this Daoist Master passed the stage of Purple Mystery long, long ago. Could it be...'

Diyan was already on his feet, standing with his hands behind his back, looking at him again. His voice was calm but powerful.

"Longhu, the North and South, Wuzhe—none of them can be trusted. Even the current Yang Clan is only capable of cowardly compromises, trying to turn major problems into minor ones and minor ones into nothing. When the critical moment arrives, they won't hesitate for a second to betray King Wei."

Evidently, this Great Daoist Master was no fool. Li Ximing had only prodded slightly, but he had easily detected the test. Diyan said softly,

"Your Highness need not be suspicious. The Six Surnames have fallen. There is no outstanding talent among them. Even the Cui Clan, descendants of a True Monarch, has been reduced to this state. To put it bluntly, in this day and age, the only person King Wei and you can trust is me."

His gaze was intense as he emphasized,

"Only me."

Li Ximing raised his head. He moved his lips, finally asking the question that had been buried in his heart for years.

"Back then, Hengzhu..."

Diyan said softly, "That's right. I was the one who sent Kuang Yu for the Radiant Sky Stone. Without her persuasion, it would never have fallen into Your Highness's hands—even if Tu Longjian had intervened, the Radiant Sky Stone that reached you would not have been the real one."

Li Ximing snapped his eyes shut.

He had harbored this suspicion for more than a day. It was true that Tu Longjian had helped him obtain the Radiant Sky Stone, but now, as a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of many years, he understood the true value of a Purple Mansion spiritual item... How could the Hengzhu Dao, even as a righteous path, simply allow two Purple Mansion spiritual items to fall into the hands of a mere Foundation Establishment Realm clan...

Li Ximing finally met his gaze. After a long time, he asked, "Senior, what is your current cultivation level?"

Diyan's gaze was like iron, like radiance. He stared straight at Li Ximing, his voice quiet and steady. 

"When King Zhaoming received his title, the 'Dawn Qi' Dao was perfected. 'Plea to Supplant the Night' is its vestment, the dawn light honoring the Bright Yang's brilliance. 'Blazing Return' is its mandate, the subject's heart revering the Emperor's majesty. I cultivate 'Stifling Bitterness' for self-reflection, and 'Pavilion of Bestowed Blessings' for edicts..."

As he spoke, one ray of dawn light after another lit up above his head. One held the might of the rising sun, killing frost and stilling water. Another held the mystery of supplanting the night, quietly submerging the Celestial Yang. Rolling colors converged at his side, filling the entire hall, igniting all thirty-six bronze lamps at once, turning everything an unbearable, brilliant white!

Even though the power wasn't directed at him, the might of these four divine abilities was still terrifying. Li Ximing, standing within it, felt a sharp, stinging sense of crisis wash over his face. But the man before him wasn't finished.

Something suddenly leaped from that brilliant white light. Golden-white stone bricks materialized one after another, fitting together perfectly. A towering city gate rose, covered in profound patterns. All the light contracted inward, revealing a shimmering, hazy radiance within, directly facing a blazing sun. To the right was 'Radiance Forged into Glory', and to the left, 'Brightness Culminating in Splendor'!

Radiant Origin Pass!

"With the 'Radiant Origin Pass' as the northern gate of the Celestial Dynasty!"

"Thus, my divine abilities are perfected!"

The Diyan before him had perfected his divine abilities, possessing all five arts!

In that instant, all the Dawn Qi light softened, becoming as clouds and mist, as support and aid, all of it converging within that Origin Pass. The stinging sensation on Li Ximing's face vanished completely, replaced by a sense of affinity, like that of Li Fire.

Even the wild, untamable man himself seemed to soften. His bronze eyes stared at Li Ximing, a smile playing on his lips.

Li Ximing's eyes were filled with profound shock. He stood up, speaking in disbelief.

"Senior... you intend to use four Dawn Qi arts and one Bright Yang art... to attain the Dao?!"




# Chapter 1079: The Quest for Gold

Li Ximing knew precious little about the Quest for Gold. However, he had been at the Purple Mansion Realm for many years, and Jiangnan was the world's focal point for those seeking such attainment. He'd gleaned some knowledge. Seeing Daoist Master Diyan's current state, how could he not be horrified?

'The legends say one must possess all five methods to even attempt the Quest for Gold. But... four parts Dawn Qi and one part Bright Yang... how is that not five methods?'

A name immediately surfaced in his mind:

'Daoist Master Yuanxiu!'

'It's not that divine abilities of the Purple Mansion Realm path can't be compatible, it's just astoundingly difficult. The Shengyang Acupoint is already overflowing with power. Just cultivating the divine abilities of one's native Dao is as hard as ascending to the heavens—how could one possibly accommodate a foreign, unrelated divine ability?'

'Of course, some Dao Lineages are more closely related than others. With my own divine ability now complete, it isn't impossible for me to cultivate a Li Fire art. But doing so would mean severing my original Dao Lineage...'

Li Ximing had once considered this a dead end. Only later, when speaking with Sima Yuanli about the foregone Daoist Master Yuanxiu, did he learn the truth. Yuanxiu had tried attaining the Dao using four parts 'Upright Wood' and one part 'Gathering Wood'!'

Sima Yuanli, looking utterly forlorn at the time, had told him,

'Regarding my lord's affairs, I consulted a senior. This senior once personally visited the site of my lord's passing. He let out a sigh, saying, "Heavy Wood Weighs Down the Branch." He said my lord "Held to the orthodox while pursuing the divergent, seeking balance yet achieving imbalance." He said my lord used the Intercalary.'

Only then did he understand. Daoist Master Yuanxiu's path to the Dao lay in the 'Intercalary'—specifically, the 'Gathering Wood' occupying the Intercalary Position.

'In the eyes of a Great Daoist Master, cultivating another Dao as the final step isn't a dead end. It's a method of the Intercalary Position, something outside the standard Fruition Attainment. This Daoist Master Diyan... surely he isn't seeking the Intercalary of Bright Yang!'

His expression was fraught with shock.

'In the current climate, with Luoxia actively suppressing Bright Yang and eager for Li Qianyuan's demise... what kind of figure would one who holds the Bright Yang Intercalary Position be!'

But as Li Ximing reeled internally, the Great Daoist Master before him grew even more silent. He looked exceptionally sinister in the faint, flickering lamplight, the dark golden glow reflecting in his pupils. He seemed to be hesitating, weighing what to reveal.

Li Ximing’s shock gradually subsided, replaced by a dawning, belated suspicion. A cold doubt settled in his heart.

'How... how is that possible? How could he possibly contain two conflicting Dao Lineages?'

He paused, then finally broke the silence.

"Is it the Bright Yang Intercalary Position?"

Daoist Master Diyan scrutinized him for a moment, then chuckled.

"Your Highness, since you are aware of the 'Dawn Qi' calamity, you must also know that 'Dawn Qi' and 'Bright Yang' are incompatible. In the past, seeking 'Bright Yang' through 'Dawn Qi' might have been possible. But now? It's a fool's errand, like climbing a tree to catch a fish. Is it not just courting death?"

That sentence struck the very heart of Li Ximing's confusion, nearly causing him to blurt out all his questions.

'Exactly! Seeking 'Bright Yang' with 'Dawn Qi' is courting death, that's undeniable. In my opinion, adding a 'Radiant Origin Pass' divine ability on top of 'Dawn Qi' arts... that's not just dead, that's deader than dead!'

Li Ximing fell silent for a long moment before asking,

"That is true. Bright Yang and Dawn Qi are as incompatible as fire and water. So how, Great Daoist Master, did you manage to establish the 'Radiant Origin Pass' amidst a foundation of roiling Dawn Qi?"

Daoist Master Diyan clasped his hands behind his back.

"Your Highness is correct. By all rights, it canno be done. Were it anyone else, they wouldn't have even been able to stabilize my first few divine abilities. However... I borrowed the legacy of an ancestor."

Daoist Master Diyan turned his body slightly. As he moved, all the white, illusory light within the hall seemed to dim and refract, as if scores of tangible, jeweled swords had suddenly angled their blades, casting their reflections sideways.

"My ancestor, Yin Ni, was originally a disciple from Guanlong. He studied the Dao in a monastery, but after ten years, he still hadn't even achieved Qi Condensation. In frustration, he joined the army. He performed one great deed after another, and within an Immortal Manor, he obtained a predecessor's Thirty-Six Books of Profound Radiance, which he used to form his divine ability. He cultivated all the way to the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm. By the time he was enfeoffed as King Zhaoming, he was rampaging unopposed across Mobei. He then rewrote the Thirty-Six Books of Profound Radiance, combining it with a method for seeking the Golden Attainment bestowed by the Imperial Monarch, to create the Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor."

"After my ancestor completed this scroll, he immediately sought the True Gold Attainment. He used the north's greatest fortress, the Spirit's Descent Pass, as his furnace. He used his entire body, his divine abilities, his dharma power, his soul, and his True Spirit as the ingredients to seek that one supreme elixir. He refined it for nine days, and the Imperial Monarch himself personally acted to uplift him and help him achieve the Dao!"

His expression turned melancholic, and he let out a heavy sigh.

"Unfortunately, to achieve the Dao, my ancestor borrowed too much from external Profound Mystery. His spirit was strangled and locked. After nine days of striving, he failed to attain... and perished."

Li Ximing listened, his expression growing solemn.

"Borrowed too much from external Profound Mystery? Spirit-strangulation?"

Daoist Master Diyan closed his eyes briefly, his voice low and somber.

"The so-called external Profound Mystery... the Buddhist Land is one source. The Celestial Dynasty is another. It means to use one's own body to borrow the Profound Mystery of another, instead of cultivating one's own original nature and life-mandate. This is what borrowing heavily from external Profound Mystery means, and so many in the world do it! Even setting aside the Buddhist Land and the Celestial Dynasty, the likes of Dongfang Heyun, the 'Heaven's Horn' of Sword Mountain, the streams of the Western Sea... they all borrow external Profound Mystery. They can borrow a path, but they can never attain the Dao."

Li Ximing had long been aware that cultivators in the Wei state relied on official positions to gain their divine abilities. Daoist Master Diyan had also just mentioned that Yin Ni studied in a monastery for ten years without any success, so he must have also relied heavily on the Celestial Dynasty's system. There was only one point Li Ximing still didn't grasp. He hesitated, 

"But... the Dharma Masters..."

Daoist Master Diyan said dismissively,

"In this day and age, what Dharma Master is still capable of truly achieving the Dao!"

"The Merciful One and Maha in the Buddhist Land—do you think they cultivated their positions themselves? Most of them just wait for a seat to become vacant, then find an opportunity to climb into it. The nature of a Dharma Master has changed. In the earliest days, they were beings of great virtue and power, whose wisdom encompassed heaven and earth. Later, it became about nine reincarnations, transferring one's nature to inherit the role, becoming a Dharma Master after attaining the Dao. But the ones who came after... they just hem and haw, wait for nine lifetimes, and inherit someone else's seat. They are nothing but an empty shell, a Dharma Master in name only."

His expression tightened, as if wary of saying too much.

"In short, borrowing heavily from external Profound Mystery is gravely detrimental to achieving the Dao. Back then, the six founding kings—Xuanji, King Zhaoming, Baiyang, Yongqin, Shouyi, and Luanfu—all perished in succession, unable to achieve the Dao."

"Later, the Wei state was destroyed, and my ancestors were lost in sea. But this Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor and King Zhaoming's Daoist Canon survived and were passed down. They were rich in Spiritual Qi and resources. It was passed through three generations of our royal line before I finally exhausted its reserves."

He smiled.

"The reason you don't see anyone else here cultivating 'Dawn Qi' is because this path is transmitted through a single lineage. Only a royal heir can cultivate it. My own aptitude is not poor. I perceived the Purple Mystery at one hundred and thirty-six years of age. By the time I broke through to become a Great Daoist Master, I still had three hundred years of life remaining."

Li Ximing was staggered by this revelation.

He thought of Jiang Boqing, who had cultivated the 'Upper Shaman' path, a complex Dao involving the Shaman-Register and myriad shamanic arts. Even with those aids, Jiang Boqing had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at thirty and the Purple Mansion Realm at sixty. Reaching Foundation Establishment by thirty wasn't unheard of for a peerless genius—Li Zhouwei had even done it in his early twenties—but the leap from Foundation Establishment to Purple Mansion had still taken Jiang Boqing thirty years.

Yet Daoist Master Diyan had no Talisman Qi to assist him. Even if he reached the Purple Mansion Realm by sixty, he would have had to perfectly refine one divine ability after another and pass the Purple Mystery with ease to master four divine abilities before he was two hundred... In the present day, perhaps only Li Zhouwei, who was practically carried by destiny with the entire world's support, had any hope of surpassing Daoist Master Diyan's speed!

Daoist Master Diyan noted the shock in Li Ximing’s eyes and smiled faintly.

"After passing the Purple Mystery, I spent thirty years cultivating the Dao and refining my divine abilities, cementing my position as a Great Daoist Master. Then, I spent another twenty years contemplating my choice for the final divine ability. The final art recorded in the Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor is, in fact, Bright Yang."

He began to pace, his voice softening.

"If I had continued on the path of Dawn Qi, I would have naturally achieved an aura of complete, perfected divine abilities. However, the Dawn Qi Dao I bear is a Great Dao that was modified by the Celestial Dynasty. It is already fundamentally different from the one that exists today. If I were to add a cheap imitation to the original, I might complete the divine ability, but the Quest for Gold would be hopeless."

A trace of doubt appeared on Li Ximing's face.

"And the Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor can lead to the Dao?" he whispered. "Your ancestor failed because he borrowed external Profound Mystery, but you are different. You cultivate your own nature. Is your hope of success great?"

But Daoist Master Diyan shook his head, laughing.

"Your Highness is mistaken. There is no 'great hope'. It is still, fundamentally, courting death."

Daoist Master Diyan's smile grew even colder.

"Seeking the Bright Yang Intercalary is an impossible feat. Not only can it not be achieved, the moment I take that step, my death will be imminent!"

Li Ximing stared at him, stunned. But Daoist Master Diyan merely smiled and resumed his pacing, his voice turning eerie.

"Your Highness was correct about one thing: the Imperial Monarch has not truly perished. At least, not yet. The Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor he personally left behind, and the Radiant Golden Convergence Method within it, are still effective before the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment. But you must have also considered... Bright Yang itself may not have changed, but Dawn Qi has! The old Dao can still be cultivated, but it is no longer compatible with Bright Yang!"

"The moment the 'Radiant Origin Pass' was formed, the four 'Dawn Qi' divine abilities within my body were instantly subverted. Their colors retracted, the azure and white merging into a chaotic unity. As time passes, a gloom will fester in the darkness, and my Shengyang Acupoint will begin to corrode and shatter!"

The doubt in Li Ximing's heart was instantly verified, and understanding dawned,

'This! This is what makes sense! This is the logical outcome. Even if my Dao-Profundity is lacking, I know how demanding it is to cultivate even one compatible divine ability, let alone one from a Dao that now clashes with the world's order! With Bright Yang completed, it's a miracle he can survive for even half a year without perishing!'

Just as he thought this, Daoist Master Diyan's gaze settled on the bronze lamp beside him. He gently adjusted the wick.

"By using this Thirty-Second Generation Night-Profound Bronze Treasure Lamp to create this chamber, I can merge Molten Fire and dawn light. This allows me to resonate with the Three Yangs and borrow the subtle master-servant dynamic remaining in the other two, which is the only way to suppress the four parts Dawn Qi and one part Bright Yang within me."

Li Ximing scanned the vast, paulownia-wood hall again, raising an eyebrow. 

"So, Great Daoist Master, you were prepared for this all along."

"I was not the one who made these preparations."

Daoist Master Diyan turned his head, his gaze lowered and his expression serene.

"When Bright Yang fell, my ancestor Yin Quan had already passed the Purple Mystery. Things were manageable at first, and he could still wander the overseas territories. But as the Emperor of Qi's actions grew more ruthless, he began to show the first signs of his divine abilities disintegrating. He used a Three Yangs formation to suppress the decay while researching it meticulously."

"Before his death, he left behind the formation diagrams. My grandfather and father then spent their lives perfecting and constructing it, combining it with the many secret arts from the Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor. Only then did today's Hall of the Three Yangs Suppressing Dawn and this Thirty-Second Generation Night-Profound Bronze Treasure Lamp come into being."

Li Ximing listened, remaining silent for a long time. He realized Mount Qusi hadn't been planning this for a mere day or two, but for centuries, perhaps even a millennium. He finally spoke, his voice heavy.

"Great Daoist Master... where, then, do you need the King of Wei?"

Daoist Master Diyan’s eyes snapped open, his expression utterly grave.

"I need the King of Wei to succeed. I am the only person who truly cares about his success."

As his emotions surged, ring-like, flame-like patterns appeared in his pupils, overlaid with fractured black lines.

"When I said I am the only one the King of Wei can trust, it was not an empty boast. Everyone else wants to destabilize Bright Yang, or perhaps stall Luoxia. But none of them care if the King of Wei actually succeeds. In fact, for most of them, it would be better if he failed!"

"The Dragon-kin, I'm sure, make grand promises. But they are just playing the odds, placing a small bet in hopes of a large return. Even if it fails, the Dragon-kin will only lose a bit of initiative and a minor opportunity!"

"Only I."

His tone was hard as iron, his gaze glacial.

"Only when the King of Wei succeeds, only when Bright Yang rises again and suppresses Dawn Qi, will my divine abilities naturally transform from this heretical side path into a brilliant, orthodox one. Only then can I walk out of this place with my head held high, descend the sixteen profound steps, and truly seek the Golden Attainment—to risk everything in a final bid for truth!"

"Otherwise, I am nothing but dry bones in a tomb, sitting here waiting to die!"

Li Ximing met his gaze directly. The last vestiges of suspicion surfaced in his mind. But seeing Daoist Master Diyan's raw, sincere emotion, which seemed impossible to fake, he finally spoke again, his voice low.

"Great Daoist Master, your talent is extraordinary. You are one of the foremost figures in the entire mainland. Even if you had just cultivated 'Dawn Qi' normally, how could your future be any less bright!"

His eyes bored into Daoist Master Diyan, a note of sorrow in his voice.

"This current King of Wei... how does he compare to Li Xunquan? To Li Xuan? To Donghuo? Li Xunquan raised a righteous army and nearly destroyed the Great Qi! Cui Mu of Donghuo once posed as a True Monarch and intimidated all the northern cultivators. Even Li Xuan—he had the entire land of Long and Wei, where he was supreme and bowed to no one!"

"Today, the Northern Buddhists run rampant. The Great Song dynasty shines brilliantly, seizing Bright Yang's authority. Luoxia shepherds the world, preparing to cast down the Imperial Monarch. If the King of Wei fails even once, all of Mount Qusi's generations of effort will be for nothing! Daoist Master, why must you take such a gamble? Why place your hope of attaining the Dao in someone else's hands? Wouldn't it be better to just cultivate Dawn Qi? Wouldn't it be better to reincarnate and start anew?"

His tone was sharp, stabbing directly at Daoist Master Diyan.

"A Great Daoist Master capable of mastering all five methods... why would you spin a cocoon to trap yourself?"

Daoist Master Diyan let out a short, sharp laugh. Without a moment's hesitation, his voice low and steady, he answered,

"Because of the method. The method for the Golden Attainment."

Li Ximing had braced himself for any number of arguments, but he never expected this answer. He stared, speechless.

"The method?"

"The most important thing is the method to seek the Golden Attainment."

Daoist Master Diyan's bronze-colored eyes blinked. His expression was solemn, so grave it was almost sacred. His lips barely moved, his voice a low hum.

"The Imperial Monarch specifically bestowed the Radiant Golden Convergence Method. That is what created the Great Dao of using four parts Dawn Qi to uplift the 'Radiant Origin Pass' to immortality. It is the method for the Golden Attainment. It is the secret of True Gold. It is a celestial scripture of the Great Dao. Only with the Radiant Golden Convergence Method did seeking the Bright Yang Intercalary become even remotely possible!"

As Daoist Master Diyan's emotions fluctuated, the candlelight throughout the great hall wavered violently. The almost-tangible Dawn Qi and Molten Fire surged like a flood, straining against their restraints. This, in turn, triggered the radiance of the Three Yangs to flare in the vaulted ceiling, pressing down to suppress the chaotic energies.

Daoist Master Diyan paid it no mind. He took a step forward, staring straight at Li Ximing.

"Do you think the Hall of the Three Yangs Suppressing Dawn and the Thirty-Second Generation Night-Profound Bronze Treasure Lamp were so easily constructed? Without the Radiant Golden Convergence Method, Mount Qusi could have spent another thousand years and never built this grand formation. Without the Radiant Golden Convergence Method, I would suffer from divine ability disintegration even while sitting in this very hall!"

"But as long as this method exists... even if I were to take a grand elixir of the Three Yangs' union right now to suppress my powers, step outside this hall, and attempt the Quest for Gold while risking the utter disintegration of my Shengyang Acupoint... my chances of success would still be greater than if I had tried to seek the Fruition Attainment using five complete Dawn Qi divine abilities!"

His expression was dark. The violent fluctuations of divine ability rolling off him turned the entire hall into a living purgatory. After an unknown time, Daoist Master Diyan parted his lips, his expression heavy.

"I have no choice. And neither do you, Your Highness. Nor does the King of Wei."




# Chapter 1080: The Three Candidates

Diyan’s expression was calm as he silently watched Li Ximing.

With the Great Daoist Master's words laid out so plainly, Li Ximing finally took them to heart. With his own level of Dao-Profundity, he could not pick a single flaw in Diyan’s logic; in fact, the entire argument was flawlessly cohesive.

'He is fully focused on pursuing the leap. If Zhouwei succeeds, he will be standing in the ranks of the righteous Dao, perfectly integrated. If he fails, he will have sought the Dao through peril.'

Li Ximing paused for a moment of thought, then spoke,

"Since that is the case, Senior must have important matters to instruct me on, having invited me here multiple times."

"I dare not speak of 'instruction.'"

The currents of red and golden wind surging within the great hall instantly subsided. Diyan stepped forward and answered,

"Mount Qusi, situated overseas, has managed to survive until now primarily because it has little to do with the extermination of Bright Yang. The fact that the great ones in the heavens would tacitly allow me this meeting with you is also due to my ability to fan the flames of the Bright Yang affair..."

"Ultimately, it’s a good thing for them. I have only one matter to convey to the Emperor's Heir, that at present, Emperor Wei and I are walking the same path."

"This matter would be better discussed with Emperor Wei himself, but his White Qilin nature makes it unsuitable for him to enter this Hall of the Three Yangs Suppressing Dawn. I don't know when a meeting will be possible, so I need Your Highness to relay this."

Diyan's eyes moved slightly as he replied,

"If Emperor Wei is willing to trust me, I have three people for him to keep an eye on."

Li Ximing's expression turned solemn, but he dared not immediately agree. He simply replied,

"I will relay your message exactly as it was given."

Diyan raised an eyebrow. "First," he answered, "is the one favored by Western Lesser Yang, the emperor of the Xiangxiong Kingdom, and the master of the White Victory Dao who wields the Wind-Horse Profound Banner—Yin Lie. I was acquainted with him and we shared a friendship that lasted over a century."

"Although his White Victory Dao is a demonic path, it aspires to the Lesser Yang. When necessary, he will be an asset to Emperor Wei."

Diyan’s voice became much quieter.

"Western Lesser Yang and Luoxia are at odds, harboring astonishing enmity. Though they currently offer false submission, if there is a chance to obstruct Luoxia's grand affairs, Western Lesser Yang will not refuse."

Li Ximing’s expression darkened, a hint of surprise in his eyes. He hesitated for a moment and then said,

"My clan nearly clashed with the White Victory Dao—even now, though we haven't met, a friend of mine was injured by their people."

Diyan's look sharpened, and he gravely stepped forward, his voice turning somber.

"It's best to discard what can be discarded. Western Lesser Yang is keeping a low profile now; their past rampant activities are gone. They only act when absolutely necessary. Provoking them is deadly."

The strange sight of Fuxun's body instantly flashed through Li Ximing's mind, making him feel a fresh wave of fear. He remained silent. Diyan anxiously paced twice, eventually shaking his head and continuing,

---

"The second candidate is a figure from Great Shu, surnamed Shangguan, given name Mi. He is a junior acquaintance of my closest friend. Should a great war erupt between Shu and Song, if he falls into Emperor Wei's hands, please spare his life and have him serve Emperor Wei."

Li Ximing immediately looked up and solemnly stated,

"With the Great Daoist Master's sentiment... Ting Province will certainly..."

But before he could finish, Diyan interrupted with a wave of his hand.

"It is not just for my sake. The Shangguan family’s ancestors originated in Guanlong, one of the Six Clans. They were granted the title Luanfu and were loyal subjects of Wei, cultivating the Li Fire Dao. Leaving aside his own brilliant talent and profound Dao-Profundity at a young age, simply as a former official, Emperor Wei will gain great benefit if he can secure him."

Only then did Li Ximing understand, and he pressed the question.

"But when two nations are at war, with Martial Cultivation supreme, how can a single Daoist Master defect to the other side? Moreover, even if he is subdued in battle, his whole clan remains in his home country..."

"That is not difficult," Diyan said. "The Shangguan clan is in the Huayan Three Prefectures, west of Tongmo. Should the two nations eventually go to war and conquer that area, their entire clan can naturally be safeguarded. As for your mention of Martial Cultivation being supreme..."

A trace of a sarcastic smile touched Diyan’s lips.

"Martial Cultivation being supreme is correct, but who is the one with the True Qi? That is hard to say. Before that one with the True Qi achieves the Dao, the power of these two emperors is far less terrifying than you imagine."

Li Ximing tucked the warning into his memory, wisely choosing not to engage in such a vast topic. Diyan paused, then said somberly,

"There is one last person. He is my own junior, a direct descendant of the Yin family, named Yin Juexi. You met him just now."

Li Ximing immediately realized his meaning.

"Is that the one cultivating in front of the palace?"

Diyan nodded, speaking softly.

"Exactly. He has been cultivating for many years and is currently seeking a divine ability. Though I don't know the exact day he will emerge from seclusion, the time should be drawing near. He can serve as an attendant to Emperor Wei."

Li Ximing listened with a mix of complexity and emotion.

"He is far too great to be an attendant!"

Diyan turned to the side. "There is nothing Emperor Wei cannot live up to."

Li Ximing saw him fall silent, seemingly filled with melancholy and sorrow for a moment. He sighed and asked,

"Since Mount Qusi..."

Diyan shook his head. "It is I, not Mount Qusi."

Li Ximing stopped short. Diyan looked at the candle flame on the bronze lamp and spoke in a steady voice.

"When my ancestor, Yin Quan, was about to pass away, he left behind a few blood descendants with meager cultivation but carrying powerful Spiritual Treasures. Worrying about their fate, he traveled all the way to this Southern Sea and found a close friend, Patriarch Qujie. He entrusted his entire life-mandate, along with his bloodline, to him."

"Patriarch Qujie was a righteous Ancient Cultivator. He did not covet the many spiritual artifacts and treasures in the slightest, instead taking the descendants as disciples and instructing them carefully... It was only then that my family slowly continued its line and inherited this Mount Qusi."

Li Ximing understood immediately. As expected, Diyan's expression grew serious.

"The Yin family is the Yin family, and Qusi is Qusi. Mount Qusi holds not only the heart’s blood of three generations of my family but also the inheritance and grace of the ancestors of its Daoist Tradition. It cannot be lightly cast aside... A person like Kuang Yu, who is a recognized successor on Mount Qusi's register, has a different status entirely."

The matter was not difficult to grasp. Li Ximing repeatedly offered his apologies for his misassumption.

'No wonder... the cultivators of Qusi have always maintained a certain distance, only inviting me here to see Diyan. Ultimately, the affair concerning Bright Yang is a private matter for the Great Daoist Master. Not only is it completely unrelated to the Daoist Tradition itself, but it is also highly likely to bring danger...'

'The disciples of Mount Qusi show no resentment and are quite supportive, likely due to the Great Daoist Master's extremely high prestige...'

All his doubts connected and were instantly resolved. Li Ximing immediately understood why Mount Jingyi traveled thousands of miles to separate from the Southern Sea to the Eastern Sea, and why Xuanyi, despite being from a schism in the Daoist Tradition, was as close to Mount Qusi as a disciple-brother, acting the part of a senior.

'The schism of Mount Jingyi was most likely driven by the fear that the Bright Yang affair would spiral out of control and ultimately destroy Mount Qusi... so they took this step as a retreat route.'

He felt enlightened. Yet, Diyan seemed to read his mind. He paced once and replied,

"You need not overthink this. Mount Qusi drawing closer to Emperor Wei is not without its benefits. Southern Anchorage Sea was known in ancient times as Southern Anchorage Water Township, a place with many treasures, abundant in Water Virtue, and towering immortal peaks. It cannot be guarded by those few factions alone; my deterrent power from this divine ability is all that keeps them away."

"Liaoluo has been in the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm for many years. If he can rely on Ting Province to gain a few decades of respite, allowing him to take that final step, Mount Qusi will have a future to rely on... Even if he fails, it will still save us decades of fighting and bloodshed."

This had been the reason Mount Qusi had approached Li Ximing several times, and now it sounded like killing two birds with one stone. However, Li Ximing sensed something was off and nervously probed,

"Great Daoist Master, you don't have to call me 'Your Highness.' I truly cannot bear to be addressed so by a Daoist Master who has perfected his divine ability; I fear it will cost me my life-mandate... But regarding the matters of Qusi, Ting Province will do its utmost to assist. May I ask who 'those few' refer to?"

Diyan spoke softly.

"Great Konghai Temple, Southern Songzhou Luoshe, and the Innocent Guilt Gate..."

Li Ximing waited for him to list them, then expressed his worry,

"Do these people know about the Great Daoist Master's current state?"

Diyan was slightly startled, then burst into laughter.

"You overestimate the difficulty of my situation!"

When the Daoist Master wore a cold expression, he appeared quite formidable, but his smile was gentle, instantly making him look years younger. A faint hint of Kuang Yu's sunny cheerfulness was visible in his expression.

"A Spiritual Treasure composed of three Yangs, called the Primal Displaying Dawn-Contained Vessel, sits on this dome. Taking this item allows me to venture out, but I must return in time to replenish the three Yangs. It is not impossible to fight, it only risks aggravating the conflict between my divine abilities."

He laughed.

"Besides, there won't be a chance to fight... With my divine ability perfected, if I stand in the Great Void, what minor figure would dare utter a peep!"

Li Ximing managed an embarrassed smile, a weight lifted from his heart. He even felt a vague sense of hope.

"If the Great Daoist Master were to make a move... even Wei Xuanyin would likely not dare to cross your path!"

"Wei Xuanyin?"

Diyan smiled wider.

"Xuanlou and I have exchanged blows no less than a hundred times, with victories on both sides. However, his Unblemished Robe was difficult to cultivate, which allowed me to complete my final path earlier. It has been a long, long time since we last met."

Li Ximing hadn't expected Diyan to be connected to Wei Xuanyin. He was briefly stunned, then felt it was perfectly reasonable—after all, the White Victory Dao master was his friend, so one more Wei Xuanyin wasn't surprising.

However, from Li Ximing's perspective, Wei Xuanyin was ultimately an enemy, so he refrained from saying more. He quickly took out the crystal-clear bead from his sleeve and said,

"The battle in Ting Province was entirely thanks to this talisman from the Great Daoist Master; it saved my life! Now that I've completely used it up, I only have this empty bead to return to you..."

"That Xuan-Ox was incredibly powerful."

Diyan casually put away the transparent bead and nodded.

"That is a treasure passed down by Qusi, an amusing little trifle."

Li Ximing thanked him repeatedly. Diyan appeared somewhat weary. He took out a palm-sized, paper-thin copper stone, smooth as a mirror and covered in complex runes, and handed it to Li Ximing.

"This item can sense my presence. Keep it well. If Emperor Wei has any instructions in the future, simply send someone to Mount Qusi."

Li Ximing understood his intent. He had not yet recovered from his deep contemplation, and his heart was heavy with complex emotions. He silently accepted the item, thanked Diyan, and descended the steps.

The interplay of water, fire, Yin, and Yang still illuminated the place, but Li Ximing's mood was vastly different.

'Qusi...'

He silently pondered as he went down the mystical steps, finding Kuang Yu still waiting below.

"Fellow Daoist Ximing!"

She approached, her tone slightly tentative. Seeing nothing amiss with Li Ximing, she knew the conversation in the hall had gone relatively well and secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Li Ximing, still immersed in thought, cupped his hands and said,

"Please advise me more in the future!"

'Huh?'

Kuang Yu was first taken aback, then hurriedly returned the salute, her expression somewhat strange. Li Ximing didn't notice, only then truly waking up as if from a dream.

"I nearly forgot the matter of the Golden Land!"

One of the original purposes of his visit to Qusi was to inquire about the Golden Land, to prepare for his future dealings with Vast Cicada. But Diyan's revelation had been too shocking, scattering his thoughts and causing him to lose his bearings. He had completely forgotten about Vast Cicada. Now, he immediately composed himself and asked,

"In the Ting Province, Vast Cicada's methods are extremely ingenious, often relying on the Golden Land. What kind of treasure is this?"

Kuang Yu looked away, deep in thought.

"Are you aware of the Great Konghai Temple nearby?" she asked.

"Naturally, I am aware."

The matter of Great Konghai Temple had been mentioned by Jiao Zhongzi of Southern Songzhou Luoshe. At the time, the Buddhist Land of Great Konghai Temple was unstable, so the temple master, Jinghai, specifically sent Baoqing into the cycle of birth and death to stabilize the Buddhist Land before reincarnating. Because of this grievance, Li Ximing had kept it in mind. He did not expect Kuang Yu to say,

"Has Zhaojing ever wondered?" Kuang Yu asked. "A Buddhist Land is usually governed by a Dharma Master, with a Maha presiding over the disciples and grand-disciples below them. Yet, there are a few Mahas and Merciful Ones, like the one at this Great Konghai Temple, who seem to have no Dharma Master above their head."

"Ancient cultivators said: 'Seeking marvelous success in serenity creates the Golden Land; the Dharma Master is proven in the Sandalwood Grove.' The Golden Land is the core, the spiritual foundation of the boundless Dharma Realm and Buddhist Land. This Great Konghai Temple is the Konghai Golden Land itself!"

"You must understand that even if a Maha achieves the Liangli stage and is nominally the master of a Seven Aspects branch, everyone knows who holds the true power. The Dharma Masters are the true owners of the Buddhist Land. But these Merciful Ones and Mahas who are proven in their own Golden Land are masters unto themselves."

"It's a Buddhist Land?" Li Ximing spoke without thinking, shocked. "That Vast Cicada has such a Great Karmic Affinity! Doesn't that mean he has the potential to become a Dharma Master?"

Kuang Yu's expression was similarly emotional and serious. "Zhaojing, listen closely. This Golden Land is a supreme treasure of the ancient Buddhist Daoist Tradition. As many paths as the ancient Buddhist cultivators laid down, that's how many such Golden Lands exist now, whether hidden or manifest. They are the foundations that can support a true Buddhist Land, and the appearance or disappearance of any single Golden Land is enough to alarm the Dharma Masters in the Sandalwood Grove!"

"Legend has it that the earliest Seven Aspects Buddhist Lands were only individual Golden Lands at first. It was the figures within them who proved themselves as Dharma Masters, expanded their Dharma Realms, and gradually absorbed other Golden Lands to reach their current vast and stable state."

She continued, "Jinghai originally secured the Konghai Golden Land. Relying on his hard cultivation and accumulated life-mandate, he advanced all the way from Merciful One to Maha, elevating the Konghai Golden Land into a power base. Though I hear he faced many limitations, Zhaojing, it is not wrong to consider it a small, self-governing Buddhist Land!"

"He also became one of the best among the Mahas due to his Great Karmic Affinity, successfully establishing his own lineage."

The woman's blue-purple eyes blinked.

"But Vast Cicada is different."

"The Konghai Golden Land was originally traceless, allowing Jinghai to quietly become a Maha and achieve autonomy. Vast Cicada's Golden Land, however, originates from the Undefeated King of Brightness, and was under the scrutiny of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm long ago. He was propped up by others!"

"The Great Adoration Dharma Realm's true goal in supporting Vast Cicada was to annex the Precious Tusk Golden Land—or at least to bring the Precious Tusk Golden Land under their total control, making it the eighth Golden Land of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm! His future path is murky. While Vast Cicada's chance to become a Dharma Master is technically higher than other Mahas, it's actually very faint, far less promising than the highly sought-after Jinghai of the Konghai Golden Land!"

Li Ximing breathed a slight sigh of relief. After hearing the second half of her statement, he looked up in shock and asked,

"The Great Adoration Dharma Realm has Seven Daos?!"

Kuang Yu raised an eyebrow, her tone solemn. "Among the Seven Aspects, it is the only one that dares to call itself a Dharma Realm for this very reason!"

Li Ximing [Purple Mansion Realm - Early Stage]

Diyan [Purple Mansion Realm - Peak Stage]




# Chapter 1081: Children

After seeing Li Ximing off, Kuang Yu rode the wind back to Mount Qusi. Xuanyi and the others were long gone, leaving the pavilion in silence.

Kuang Yu headed deeper into the mountain on her own, only to find a woman in red robes blocking her path. The woman bowed respectfully.

"Miss, the Master wishes to see you."

Surprised, Kuang Yu paused and nodded slightly. She followed the path to the front of the Hall of the Three Yangs Suppressing Dawn. Billowing clouds of Dawn Qi swirled across the golden platform. As she ascended the steps, she saw the main throne area was brightly lit, contrasting sharply with her master, who sat shrouded in deep, dark red.

She walked forward, ascended the platform, and bowed deeply.

"Master!"

Diyan's expression was no longer as grave as before; a hint of liveliness had returned to his features. He sat casually on the throne, holding a wine goblet.

"What did he say?" he asked in a low voice.

Kuang Yu replied, "He spoke of the Precious Tusk Golden Land."

Diyan took a sip of wine.

"I am insistent on pursuing the Dao. Do you resent me for it?"

Kuang Yu bowed her head.

"I wouldn't dare... This junior only wishes to support the Master's pursuit. I am merely worried about Mount Qusi, and... I worry..."

Her expression was complicated.

"If we get involved too deeply, if we anger this power or that, will the fallout not strike Mount Qusi?"

Diyan took another sip.

"There's no need to worry. Patriarch Qujie is, after all, a disciple of Motongse Palace. The beings 'up there' see these things... differently."

Kuang Yu looked up, confused. Diyan continued,

"The subtlety of this affair lies here: In the eyes of King Wei, we are helping him. But in the eyes of Luoxia, are we not also helping them? Even the Dragon-kin will see it as us lending a hand!"

"Though that great personage hasn't appeared in ages, this action aligns perfectly with his stance and interests. Whether he directly ordered it or not, the other great powers will assume it was his move. Why would they vent their anger on us?"

Kuang Yu was silent for a moment before asking,

"So this was your calculation all along, Master."

Diyan merely looked at her with a faint, unreadable smile and sipped his wine.

'My calculation? That's not necessarily so!'

Kuang Yu stood up to leave. Diyan hesitated for a moment, then finally took a jade talisman from his sleeve. It was about three fingers wide, black as its base, and inscribed with patterns of gold and red.

Kuang Yu took the talisman from his hand and examined it. Her expression immediately grew wary. She looked up at her master as Diyan spoke in a level tone,

"Years ago, I had you practice Cultivation Transcendence. My thinking was that a chaotic era of displacement was coming. The path of 'Cultivation Transcendence' is not only skilled at self-preservation, but it allows one to ride the tides of the era, offering a chance to achieve great Dao-Profundity."

"Now that you are deeply involved in the Bright Yang's machinations, your Cultivation Transcendence Dao can borrow a measure of its power."

Kuang Yu's face paled slightly.

"This junior has never considered the Quest for Gold!"

Diyan shook his head.

"I am not asking you to undertake the Quest for Gold, merely to borrow its power to cultivate your divine abilities. Your path requires 'transgression,' and I fear you'll hardly find an act more transgressive than killing the Emperor."

Kuang Yu looked lost.

"This junior is confused... Master, you already have my younger cousin cultivating Cultivation Transcendence. Isn't he a more suitable candidate? I am the inheritor of Mount Qusi's legacy..."

Diyan paused, his cup halfway to his lips, a flicker of pain in his eyes. He sighed after a long moment.

"This... this was supposed to be your father's task. His age was perfect... If he had lived, his cultivation would also be at the perfect stage. He would have assisted King Wei in this great transgression, and regardless of success or failure, he would have had a chance to contend for an Auxiliary Position... If he were here, I would never, ever let you touch this."

He shut his eyes tightly.

"Hateful... to be killed by... Can Lufu!"

At the mention of her father, Kuang Yu's expression flickered and fell. Diyan continued in a somber voice,

"He is gone. No one dares to bear the karma of this Bright Yang transgression alone. That leaves only you... and your cousin, to share the burden. With your combined aptitude, you might have hope of passing the Purple Mystery. If one of you manages to claim the greater share, you might even... touch upon reincarnation."

"This is why I instructed you to get close to Li Ximing, not to King Wei. The King is Juexi's domain. Juexi serves him openly as a courtier; you forge a bond in the shadows. By leveraging Juexi, you can take on a greater share of the karmic ties. Without him, it would be very difficult for you to claim any significant part."

Kuang Yu nodded thoughtfully. Diyan continued, his voice heavy with meaning, 

"This is also why I absolutely had to speak with him today, why he had to meet Juexi, and why he had to agree on King Wei's behalf first. Juexi's talent is high, but breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm is still fraught with peril. By letting him be 'stained' by the status of this Bright Yang transgression, he will have a much greater certainty of achieving his divine ability!"

Comprehension dawned on Kuang Yu's face, and she sighed deeply.

"Master, your planning has been truly painstaking..."

"And... there is the matter of avenging your father, but it is still too soon..." Diyan shook his head, cutting her off. He gently closed her fingers over the jade talisman she had been holding uncertainly.

"I can only arrange this much for you. How you walk your future path... whether you do this or not... is entirely up to you."

Perhaps it was merely the deep red light of the hall, but Kuang Yu's face seemed flushed. She bowed silently and retreated, leaving Diyan alone on the throne.

All expression vanished from his face. His gaze, following her retreating figure, held a profound loneliness. This Great Daoist Master, his divine abilities perfected, seemed like a caged bird, trapped within the small confines of the hall. He narrowed his eyes, watching silently as Kuang Yu disappeared.

---

'Diyan...'

Li Ximing streaked across the sky, flying over the Southern Sea, his mind still heavy with thought.

He knew a great deal now; Li Zhouwei consulted with him on nearly everything he knew. But as the major powers emerged one by one, testing the waters again and again... Li Ximing was struck by a powerful sense of absurdity.

'This entire Bright Yang affair... it's become a gamble!'

'It's a gamble with the 'shaking of the Bright Yang' as the minimum payout, the 'fate of the White Qilin' as the bonus, and the 'ascension of a new Bright Yang Monarch' as the grand prize. The great powers are all placing their bets, and people like Changxiao, Diyan, and even Yuandao are continuously raising the stakes, not hesitating to wager their fortunes and their very lives.'

'They keep betting more and more. It's as if the entire world is being pushed forward... with no chance to turn back.'

His expression was calm as he flew westward. After an unknown amount of time, the myriad pavilions of the coastline finally emerged on the horizon.

The Protectorate of the Tranquil Sea had originally been Daoist Master Zhusheng's territory. It contained the Shahuan Kingdom, whose people were mostly of Jiaozhi descent. The kingdom had since been dissolved and its lands divided into prefectures, all administered by Great Song officials.

When Li Ximing returned on his beam of light, the mountain was surprisingly bustling. A group of cultivators was kneeling in the main hall, not daring to move. Cheng Qian, dressed in white, sat on the main seat with a severe expression, terrifying the cultivators into holding their breath.

As Li Ximing's Heavenly Light appeared, Cheng Qian's expression finally softened.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

He moved to welcome Li Ximing while waving his sleeve at the others.

"Go and investigate again!"

The cultivators scattered as if granted amnesty. Seeing Cheng Qian's grave expression, Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"What's happened?"

Cheng Qian flicked his sleeve and sighed. "After I arrived, I visited several of the Shaman Kingdoms and began to deal with the demonic disturbance. But the more I investigate, the less simple it seems. Behind the turmoil in the Shaman Kingdoms... there must be a Demon King."

Li Ximing's eyes narrowed.

"Which Demon King?"

Cheng Qian sighed.

"More than one!"

He looked troubled as he explained, "The Shaman Kingdoms are wedged between two powers. One is the territory of the Bifeng Mountain Lord, bordered by the Black Lacquer Ridge. The other is the territory of another mountain lord, named Mountain Lord Yuandun, bordered by Favorable Ridge Peak. He has shown goodwill to Jinghai in the past."

"This Bifeng Mountain Lord is infamous. I presume you know of him, Daoist Friend? His name is Can Lufu..."

Although Cheng Qian was intelligent, he was an overseas cultivator and unfamiliar with the affairs of Jiangnan. He had no idea what the Li Clan's past entailed, or what enemies they had made. He spoke quite naturally.

Li Ximing's expression remained neutral, but his heart turned to ice.

'Still running free... Enjoy your freedom for a few more decades. It won't last.'

Before his breakthrough, Li Ximing and the entire Li Clan were nothing but dust in Can Lufu's eyes. Even after he broke through, the clan was still negligible. But things were different now. If the Li Clan went all out and called in their allies, they could certainly cause the Demon King significant trouble, though it was still far from enough to kill him.

Cheng Qian continued, "This Can Lufu is a notoriously old demon, with profound methods and high Dao-Profundity. Mountain Lord Yuandun on the other side is only at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm. He's only managed to contend with Can Lufu by banding together with several other nearby Demon Kings."

"Your clan's general has been seizing Can Lufu's territory. Now... the old demon is using this as an excuse, 'cutting from the north to patch the east,' so to speak. The two sides are fighting fiercely, allowing him to plunder the populace and, conveniently, suppress Mountain Lord Yuandun at the same time."

Having achieved the Purple Mansion Realm not long ago and spending most of his time in the Eastern Sea, this situation was a natural headache for Cheng Qian. Li Ximing exhaled slowly, considering.

"Have any Purple Mansion Realm experts made a move?"

Cheng Qian's expression darkened.

"That's precisely the problem. The Bifeng Mountain Lord has dispatched two Purple Mansion Realm Demon Kings, and they've been stirring up trouble repeatedly. There are tremors in the earth veins, calls for aid... Once the fighting escalates, we will likely have to assist Mountain Lord Yuandun."

Li Ximing mused, "I seem to recall... Daoist Master Zhusheng had a friend among the demon-kin here... someone called Daoist Master Xian Chan."

"He serves under Mountain Lord Yuandun!"

Li Ximing already loathed Can Lufu, so he was instantly inclined to take sides. However, his desire for true vengeance was greater, and he was wary of alerting his enemy prematurely. Furthermore, if he was to act, he preferred to do so under the banner of the Song Court.

"We should support Mountain Lord Yuandun," he said. "It's a matter of balancing the Southern Borderlands. But we can no longer act independently as we once did. We must report this to the Emperor first. Even if no troops are dispatched, having one or two Spiritual Artifacts allocated to us would be for the best."

Cheng Qian immediately saw the logic.

"Senior, your foresight is thorough!"

Li Ximing simply picked up a brush, infusing his divine ability into the scroll as he carefully worded his report to Yang Zhuo. All the while, he was coldly calculating.

'This has more than one purpose. The matter of the Azure Talisman is still unresolved. If I can get a clear grasp of the situation here, find an opening, and eliminate one of the Demon Kings allied with Can Lufu, I can secure a strand of Talisman Qi for Jiangqian!'

At this thought, he felt quite satisfied and even felt a bit more favorable toward Yang Ruiyi.

'No matter how I influence the situation in the Southern Borderlands, as long as I act under the identity of the Great Song, there won't be any major trouble. Compared to the north, this place is far more comfortable. I don't have to face the northern Buddhist cultivators, and I might even be able to earn some spiritual resources and favors...'

Simin Prefecture.

Simin had been the foundation of the Azure Pond, but its immortal halls and pavilions were all located on the mountain. The prefecture below, prosperous and grand, was ultimately a mortal domain. However, after the Great Song was founded, it was established as the Imperial Capital. Gathering the heroes of the former Yue State, they instituted new systems and erected grand palaces, transforming the city into a scene of splendor.

Hidden amidst the dense layers of city buildings, the main gates of a vast but low-key residence were tightly shut. The inner chambers were just as quiet. A group of servants stood pressed against the walls, not daring to look up. The only sound was the light, clear ringing of a small bell.

A woman in white sat sideways by the bed, her pale, slender fingers gently turning a small bell, causing it to jingle softly. On the bed, a baby boy, no more than a year old, watched with rapt attention, his pair of golden eyes locked onto the bell.

A baby girl, even smaller and more delicate, lay sleeping with her back to them, snuggled against her mother.

While the woman entertained the boy, a powerfully built man beside them was trying on a set of black robes. A ceremonial sash of purple and gold was tied at his waist, giving him an imposing air.

Li Jiangxia held up a bronze mirror, gazing at his own golden eyes within it. He suddenly recalled something and asked,

"Has Daoist Master Zhaojing gone to the Southern Borderlands?"

The woman immediately set the bell down.

"Yes," she said softly.

Li Jiangxia raised a hand and shook his head.

"If he hasn't returned to the lake, he is likely unaware of Yuzhi and Suichu being born. Send someone to Jinghai to inform him."

The woman agreed softly, but she seemed hesitant, as if wanting to say something difficult. Li Jiangxia waved the nearby servants away. She then spoke, "This lowly one was blessed with great fortune to bear children for the General... But I have heard that Ting Province has... naming conventions based on generation. I fear that 'Yuzhi' and 'Suichu' do not follow the rules."

Her expression was anxious.

"I am not afraid of gossip, but I worry the two children... will not be favored by King Wei."

Li Jiangxia laughed and shook his head as he pulled on his spiritual boots. 

"You needn't worry about that. My own name, 'Xia,' is not part of the convention either. My father, the King, gave it to me."

He turned his head, a thoughtful look on his face.

"I understand his intentions now, so I'm not concerned with such rules. I am not like Li Jianglong, who had to shamelessly beg for his son's name. This is fine. As for you... you bore me twins. Who would dare to give you trouble?"

Although Li Jiangxia had many concubines, he had remained without an heir for many years. When he finally arrived at the Song Court and went to war wielding the Holder of the Profound, he had given up on the idea, focusing entirely on his cultivation.

The Song Emperor valued him highly, bestowing upon him not only spiritual resources and treasures, but also six women to serve him. All of them cultivated the Veiled Yin. The intent was not for him to bear children, but purely to allow him to engage in dual cultivation, harmonize his yin and yang, and advance his cultivation base.

But perhaps it was because he had left Moongaze Lake—dominated by the Bright Yang and the suppression of his father and brothers—that his own fate had flourished. Or perhaps the Dao of Veiled Yin was truly effective. In any case, one of the six women, a woman from the Mushroom Forest Plains named Zou Xie, had unexpectedly become pregnant.

Li Jiangxia was overjoyed, but an even greater surprise followed: Zou Xie bore him twins—a son and a daughter!

'Could it be that my fate has truly unfurled?'

He was elated. Now a father, he doted on his two children, and he brought Zou Xie with him everywhere. Now, returning to the Imperial Capital to report on his duties, he had brought the mother and children back with him.

He lovingly stroked his two children's heads and said softly, "The Emperor has summoned me. I must make a trip to the palace."




# Chapter 1082: The Sequence

The palace stretched deep, its walls concealing many secrets.

Brilliant light filled the hall. Kudzu flowers, scattered by the courtyard wind, piled up against the steps. A young man stood quietly at the palace gate, dressed in an imperial robe of deep purple-blue, intricately patterned with white-gold thread.

Behind him, a eunuch stood stiffly, carefully holding a golden birdcage. Amidst the swirling spiritual light, a small sparrow could be seen hopping restlessly within.

The bird was no bigger than a man's palm. It had two long, blue-white tail feathers, pitch-black claws, and crimson eyes. Its long, purple-blue beak was cocked to the side as it peered at the outside world with boundless curiosity.

The young man on the left, his golden eyes glinting, was Li Jiangliang. He glanced at the sparrow, then lowered his gaze, saying nothing.

This sparrow was a Spirit Beast of the True Qi Dao known as a "Tanzhen." It was said to be able to command water and fire and balance yin and yang. They had been extinct for many years. When Yang Zhuo ascended the throne, the Yang family scoured the world for treasures to present as tribute, and this bird was prized above all else!

Yang Zhuo himself was quite fond of the creature, always keeping it by his side to dote on.

In the courtyard before the palace, two cultivators were dueling with swords. The elder appeared to be in his early twenties, while the other was much younger, perhaps just past ten. Neither used their cultivation, relying purely on their swordsmanship. Yet, their supreme control over their blades was evident as they clashed with a sharp, ringing clang, light and shadow flowing around them.

Emperor Song, Yang Zhuo, watched with his arms crossed, a look of keen interest on his face. He turned his head slightly.

"Jiangliang... the Lingu family presented a treasured blade. While it's no Spiritual Artifact or Spiritual Treasure, it _is_ an antique from the previous dynasty, and of the True Qi Dao. Which of the princes do you think it suits?"

Li Jiangliang simply bowed his hands.

"The First Prince is refreshing and unconventional, with a refined appearance, and excels at discussing the profound. For him, to hold the sword is to hold oneself. The Second Prince is a peerless talent, bright as the full moon, with a clear and noble bearing. For him, to hold the sword is to hold its edge... It truly only depends on Your Majesty's expectations."

Yang Zhuo shook his head, smiling. He didn't look at Li Jiangliang, only at the duel.

"I saw the limits of their talent long ago. When it comes to heirs, I am inferior to King Wei."

Yang Zhuo had once roamed and cultivated in Simin. He had fathered many children, far more than most Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, but they were all scattered among the common folk. These two princes had only been found and brought back after he became emperor. The First Prince was named Hui, and the Second Prince was Jiong. Both were accomplished for their young age.

The First Prince, Yang Hui, was the eldest at twenty-eight and had recently reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. The Second Prince, Yang Jiong, was more talented. At just past twenty, he was already a cultivator at the ninth level of Qi Refining.

In the depths of the palace, there was also a third son, only three years old, who had been born after the ascension. Li Jiangliang had seen him. The child had been born treading on water and fire, a crimson dot between his brows. He was clearly extraordinary. Li Jiangliang understood what Yang Zhuo meant—these first two princes had simply been born too early.

Li Jiangliang considered this for a moment and bowed.

"Your Majesty..."

Yang Zhuo waved his hand, cutting him off.

"But if I truly must compare the two before me, I prefer the younger one. At least he shows some edge."

Li Jiangliang glanced at Yang Jiong, whose sword was flashing faster and faster. He was about to speak when a long, drawn-out announcement echoed from the palace hall, shattering his words.

"His Excellency, the County Governor of White River and General of the Southern Conquest, Li Jiangxia, requests an audience!"

Li Jiangliang froze, his expression flickering. Yang Zhuo, however, turned with a broad smile and clapped him affectionately on the shoulder.

"Your brother is here."

A general in black armor strode swiftly into the courtyard. He was powerfully built, with an imposing aura and the same blazing golden eyes. It was, indeed, Li Jiangxia.

After the general bowed at the foot of the steps, Yang Zhuo smilingly helped him up. "Congratulations!"

Li Jiangxia knew the emperor was referring to the recent birth of his son and daughter. He hurriedly bowed in thanks.

Yang Zhuo waved his hand again. A eunuch immediately stepped forward bearing a jade tray. 

"Today, as it happens, I have another joy to add to yours."

The jade tray was brought before Li Jiangxia. In its center rested a blue-gold token, inscribed with four characters: "Purple-Gold Profound Mystery."

Yang Zhuo declared, "I decree that General Li shall receive the Purple-Gold Profound Mystery and enter the Feng Wu Hall to command the troops. From this day, you are relieved of your temporary commissions abroad."

Li Jiangxia had always been highly valued. He had been temporarily granted a divine ability to lead the campaign in the south, then later to attack Shanji and contend with the Merciful One, earning considerable merit. Yang Zhuo was now using this as a justifiable reason to station him permanently in the Purple and Gold Palace!

While Li Jiangxia's capabilities were outstanding, this was, in large part, Yang Zhuo's favoritism. If Li Jianglong had been the one temporarily wielding the Profound Mystery back then, his achievements might not have been any less. Ultimately, it was just a convenient excuse to promote someone he favored.

However, receiving the Purple-Gold Profound Mystery was not the same as being a true Holder of the Profound. He had merely been promoted from a temporary wielder to a temporary receiver. The real benefit was that he no longer needed to be commanding troops on the frontier to receive the blessing of the divine ability. Like Li Jiangliang, it would now be with him at all times—a massive boon for his cultivation! The only thing separating him from a true Holder of the Profound was the title itself.

Li Jiangxia valued nothing more than the cultivation of his divine ability. How could he not be ecstatic? He bowed deeply.

"I will surely pacify all troubles for my Emperor and bring peace to our Song nation!"

Yang Zhuo gave a faint smile and bade him rise.

"A message came from Jinghai this morning," he said softly. "Daoist Master Zhaojing asked about the situation in the Southern Borderlands. Jiangliang and I have discussed it, and we plan to support the Demon beasts there to maintain the balance."

"Why don't you take the 'Profound Water Stone of the Far Ridges' and make a trip? While you're at it, you can reorganize those Shaman Kingdoms you conquered."

"As for White River..."

Yang Zhuo's voice was light.

"Do you have anyone to recommend?"

Both brothers' hearts clenched.

White River was no ordinary post. It was situated between Tangdao Mountain and Moongaze Lake. It was obvious they couldn't just send a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to guard it. Whoever was sent would first receive a divine ability from the Purple and Gold Palace! This was a tremendous opportunity.

Li Jiangliang sank into deep thought.

'How many Holders of the Profound does the Great Song currently have?'

'The most prominent are the two Military Commissioners at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm, Situ Huo and Liu Bai. They hold divine abilities and possess the power to truly stabilize a region. They certainly can't be moved.'

'The rest are my brother, Li Jiangxia, and myself... That's already four! Jiangxia might not grasp the gravity of this, but I've been by the Emperor's side and know many secrets. There are only two or three positions left in the Purple and Gold Palace!'

The best candidate in Li Jiangliang's mind was his own second brother, but the topic was far too sensitive. He lowered his eyes.

"The Sima Family has a promising talent named Sima Xunhui. He is already at the late-Foundation Establishment Realm, skilled in planning, and a first-rate talent..."

"Sima Xunhui."

Yang Zhuo chuckled softly.

"He has no merits and no faults. How could I justify such an appointment? The Great General strongly recommended your second brother, Li Jianglong, yet I don't hear you mentioning him!"

Li Jiangliang flushed with embarrassment.

"I was only trying to avoid suspicion!"

Yang Zhuo shook his head, still smiling, and clasped his hands behind his back.

"Isn't Sima Xunhui also a son-in-law of Ting Province? Ning Wan recommended someone named Li Yuanqin, who I hear is also from a direct bloodline in Ting Province. Tinglan was even more amusing, pointing to a junior of your own Li family. If we were truly avoiding suspicion, where would it end? Don't overthink it. You are dismissed."

Mortified, Li Jiangliang gave his assent and retreated alongside his brother, leaving the emperor standing alone, hands clasped behind his back. The bird in the cage chirped, its song clear and melodious.

Yang Zhuo took a step. A gust of wind blew kudzu petals onto his boot. He looked at the flowers piled on the steps and remarked,

"How vigorously they grow!"

---

Once the two brothers were out of the main hall, Li Jiangxia's handsome face was wreathed in smiles.

"The Feng Wu Hall... it suits me well."

The high officials of the Great Song were split into three branches: the martial branch, Feng Wu; the civil branch, Fengzhen; and, presiding over them all, the Purple and Gold Palace. However, the Song Emperor did not strictly separate civil and military, and concurrent appointments were common.

Li Jiangliang, however, seemed lost in thought. He snapped back to himself and offered a congratulations.

"This is perfect. I'll go back with you, brother, and meet those two wonderful children!"

"Of course!"

---

Moongaze Lake.

The mountain forest trembled. A hollow rumbling echoed from a cave, mixed with the sharp rustle of wind.

Fine sand in front of the cave-dwelling danced and leapt with the wind. The stone door vibrated violently as dazzling silver light poured from its seams, flowing like a river down the mountainside.

_BOOM!_

The stone door, which had not moved in years, suddenly burst open. A surging wave of silver light blasted outward, causing the sky to darken and thunder to roll. The clouds scattered, revealing flashing stars, and the surrounding trees toppled as the ground was bathed in starlight!

A young man emerged from the cave-dwelling. His features were cold and stern, his bearing extraordinary. His eyes glittered with an intense silver light, giving him a somewhat cruel appearance. Yet, a trace of joy between his brows, like a spring wind melting ice, softened much of that coldness.

It was Li Suining!

"Immortal Foundation, achieved!"

He had spent a year in secluded meditation on the mountain, adjusting his breath and condensing his True Essence to achieve the Immortal Foundation of the Great Void Revolution Art. He had calculated the sequence, prepared to shift the times, and claimed his divine duty: the Divine Sequence!

But his face held more than just joy; it held the profound peace of having survived a great calamity. A film of cold sweat even glistened on his brow.

The difficulty of this path had far exceeded his imagination!

It wasn't as if he, Li Suining, had never cultivated or established a foundation before. The Sacred Scroll of the Star Court he practiced in his past life was also a fifth-grade art. But the difficulty of this seemingly less-noble art was far, far greater!

This was because the Great Void Revolution Art had condensed an extra "Void Core" in his sea of qi. The art mentioned that this core could be dissolved during Foundation Establishment to aid the process. A true genius, however, would turn this core from illusory to real, vastly increasing their power after reaching the new realm.

Having been reborn, and with resources far exceeding his previous life, Li Suining had already endured decades to reach Foundation Establishment. How could he possibly settle for second best? He had gritted his teeth and forced his way through. But the process had tormented him. If not for his past life's experience and the Essence Gathering Pills, he might very well have perished.

'I finally, finally made it through!'

'The Divine Sequence. Its primary marvel is "calculating the sequence," which is precisely a calculation art!'

'It's not that our family lacks calculation arts. The ability of Daoist Master Li Que'wan, the Whole Pill, to transform calculations rivals even Qiushui's.'

'But unlike the calculation arts of the Whole Pill or the Shaman Dao, the marvel of the Divine Sequence relies heavily on celestial phenomena.'

'Unfortunately, in the current era, the stars are in disarray and the heavens are abnormal. The power of this marvel is greatly weakened, making calculations extremely troublesome.'

'Only a few minor marvels for controlling lightning remain. The one unique aspect is self-preservation: "If the life-mandate is defied, the Divine Sequence will know."'

'The Untraceable Presence can block calculation arts, shielding one from divination. The Divine Sequence has a similar effect. Divine abilities like Serene Listen will find it very difficult to hear my inner thoughts, and I will sense their attempt...'

'...However, the Daoist Master on the other end will likewise sense that their divine ability has failed and realize something is amiss.'

'But, according to the scroll, the Divine Sequence cannot hide from Life Divine Ability-class powers, like Bright Yang or Sheji.'

As for "shifting the times," Li Suining found this far more useful. When cultivating the Divine Sequence, the more cultivators one's actions influenced, and the vaster their divine abilities, the more "radiance" would be added to his Divine Sequence.

'The Divine Sequence only gains the marvel of _actively_ shifting the times at the Purple Mansion Realm. But for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, a "hidden dragon in the abyss," this added radiance is not to be underestimated... This radiance can be used for calculations!'

The final marvel, the 'concurrent divine duty,' was something Li Suining understood poorly. It mentioned 'attaching to a Grotto-Heaven or Blessed Land' and 'entrusting one's life-mandate...'

The art also mentioned that the Divine Sequence was closely related to the Radiant Qi Dao. It had once been complementary to the Spirit-Crown Tassel of the Radiant Qi Dao.

It said that cultivators of the Heaven-Governing Dao could use the Spirit-Crown Tassel to supplement this Divine Sequence... It all left Li Suining in a half-comprehending daze.

'The Radiant Qi Dao is said to be controlled by Buddhist cultivators. Who knows... maybe my Divine Sequence is also prime material for converting to Buddhism!'

He gave a sarcastic laugh.

It seemed the Heaven-Governing Dao had truly lost its luster over the long years. Not only were its main functions incomplete, but it also lacked all the minor, practical applications like using Li Fire to consume wood-elemental medicine or using Pit Water to control water and repel Demon beasts.

The only thing worth mentioning was the "Qi Core" that he had used all his strength to preserve within his Dantian.

This Qi Core had already condensed during his Qi Refining days. As he broke through to Foundation Establishment, it had transformed from illusory to real, and was now named the 'Heaven-Governing Thunder Mansion.'

According to the Great Void Revolution Art, the Heaven-Governing Thunder Mansion could store qi and accumulate lightning. More importantly, it served as a 'False Mansion' used to attach to a Grotto-Heaven or Blessed Land for cultivation.

He studied it for a while, a deep puzzle forming in his mind.

'The Heaven-Governing Thunder Mansion is the core of the Great Void Revolution Art. So why, when it comes to the critical details, does the immortal art say nothing at all? It took me a tremendous effort to accommodate this Qi Core during my breakthrough. Was it really just to store an extra ten or twenty percent of True Essence and lightning? What a joke!'

An extra ten or twenty percent of True Essence and a place to store lightning was certainly not weak. But Li Suining was a direct descendant of the Moongaze Immortal Clan. How could he care about such trivial scraps? To put it bluntly, if he asked Li Jiangzong to refine a dharma artifact for him, it could also store that much True Essence and lightning, and probably do it better!

He reviewed the art again and again, his suspicion growing.

'How strange. Is the Great Void Revolution Art truly a _complete_ immortal art? Why is the description of the immortal foundation so obscure? It feels as though... the key principles have been concealed.'

What he had obtained from Liu Changdie back then was indeed titled the Great Void Revolution Art. But what had ended up in his hands was, in fact, the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment chapters of the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence! Of course it was profound and abstruse. The numerous secret arts had all been redacted and sealed away—all of them in the hands of Li Ximing!

Although Li Suining had felt the art was cohesive and complete back then, now that he had successfully cultivated its foundation, he could finally sense that something was wrong.

He could only assume it was a limitation of the art itself. He sighed, overcome with emotion.

"The Heaven-Governing Dao... so renowned in antiquity! If I could one day complete its Dao Lineage, what infinite power and boundless marvels would it hold!"

Li Suining sighed inwardly. He finally stepped out of his seclusion and reached the entrance. An old man was waiting for him, dressed in plain clothes and holding a lamp. He was sitting on the steps, sighing and tracing the patterns on the stone with his hand.

"Old Du!"

The old servant assigned to him immediately leapt to his feet, his vision blurring with tears. He stammered, "The Heavens be praised!"

Tears streamed down his face.

"I... I thought so much time had passed... that something had happened to Young Master... This is wonderful. This is truly wonderful..."

Since Du Dou had been assigned to Li Suining, his status had risen like a boat on a high tide. Not only did no one dare show him disrespect, but his own cultivation resources had multiplied several times over, and even his children and grandchildren had benefited... These tears were not just for Li Suining's success; they were also filled with his own profound relief.

"The art had a few bottlenecks, so it took some time," Li Suining said, comforting him with a smile.

"Come! Let's go report the good news to the Old Master!"

But Du Dou suddenly stopped him, wiping the tears from his face.

"Young Master, wait!" he urged, his voice tense.

"Hm?"

Li Suining's brow furrowed as he saw Du Dou's nervous expression.

"Young Master Ning, you don't know! The war between the north and south has grown fierce! A while ago, a great monk came, called... called Vast Cicada! He fought until the sky and earth turned dark. It took several Daoist Masters just to hold him off... and he still came and went as he pleased!"

Li Suining frowned.

"Vast Cicada!"

The old man nodded frantically.

"The Daoist Master has already been transferred to the south! The lake is undefended right now... The other masters gave strict orders. All direct descendants are to remain in the mountains cultivating. No one is allowed to leave... Even Lord Jiangchun has entered the inner formation!"

Li Suining's expression changed. He clasped his hands behind his back, turned, and paced a few steps before the cave. He stopped at the edge of the steps, his voice sharp.

"Is that true?!"

# Chapter 1083: Crescent Moon

"Of course!"

The old man before him agreed readily. His words made Li Suining's expression darken. He began to pace back and forth in front of his immortal cave, his mind heavy with a single thought: 'Li Jieyi.'

Li Suining knew of Vast Cicada; he even knew his secular name was Li Jieyi. And any mention of Li Jieyi inevitably led to the Undefeated King of Brightness.

The Undefeated King of Brightness had been a major figure in the Great Liang, presiding over a small Buddhist Land. Although this Buddhist King was often associated with the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, he was never truly one of the Seven Aspects. He held a certain affinity for the ancient Buddhist cultivators and served as a crucial pillar of support for the Touba family.

When the Touba family claimed the imperial throne, he was the seventh-generation Maha. He achieved the rank of Dharma Master just before the fall of the Liang. Combined with his legendary small Buddhist Land, his power was nothing short of terrifying. Yet, his demise also came with the Liang's end.

'The last Liang Emperor drowned, but that was essentially the fall of their Emperor Wu... The Undefeated King of Brightness perished along with him. Could it be... they touched upon the Bright Yang Dao?'

The Undefeated King of Brightness was said to have fathered five "demon-sons," all monstrous fiends whom the Buddhist King personally slew and purified. This Li Jieyi was the descendant of the fifth of those sons. His ancestors had hidden within a great family during the fall of the Liang and managed to survive.

Li Suining knew these details so clearly because, in the future, Li Jieyi's reputation would become immense.

'Logically, he shouldn't have come south yet. He was supposed to appear as an opponent for King Wei during the northern campaign... until he appeared. The Great Peacock from the Way of Great Desire, the one known as "Yayoi's Rebirth"!'

Li Suining grew silent. Recalling it now still left him with an indescribable feeling. The Way of Great Desire, which had been consumed by internal strife for a millennium, suddenly erupted in a terrifying civil war. The chaos shocked the world, reaching a point where all restraints were abandoned and multiple Dharma Master-level figures openly revealed themselves!

The Way of Great Desire instantly rose to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Compassion Dao, contending for the supreme position among the Seven Aspects.

While this turmoil didn't directly involve the Li family, it completely shattered the existing power balance within the Seven Aspects.

The Maha Sparrow Carp Fish of the Way of Great Desire emerged from seclusion, his cultivation perfected. He brought three Buddhist Scions—born from the power of "Yayoi's Rebirth"—south with him, shaking all of Jiangbei. The event so alarmed the Compassion Dao, which had originally been content to watch, that they were forced to move south as well. This was the prelude to the great terror that became the Changhe Rebellion.

'And the part most relevant to the Li family... was one of those three Buddhist Scions: the Maha Antelope Trample, bearer of the Left Seat of Fear, whose secular name was Li Chengpan!'

Sparrow Carp Fish brought Antelope Trample south to confront Li Jieyi directly, intending to seize his small Buddhist Land. This move indirectly forced the Great Adoration Dharma Realm to throw its full support behind Li Jieyi, which was what ultimately elevated the man to his position as the Maha Vast Cicada.

'And now... he's come south this early!'

Li Suining mulled this over, but on the whole, he wasn't overly panicked. He had a theory:

'The change isn't because of Guest Retainer Ding. It's because of Daoist Master Zhaojing. He wasn't trapped in the Western Sea; he made a clean retreat. The situation changed from King Wei guarding the lake to the Daoist Master guarding it. Now, the northern cultivators who want his life won't just probe cautiously as they did in my past life. They'll launch aggressive, all-out assaults!'

'But with the Great Song providing cover, things won't get too out of hand. He wasn't stalled in the Western Sea, and the World's Radiance is already achieved! This is... a full decade earlier than it should be.'

Escaping the Western Sea had certainly drawn more enemies, but as long as Li Ximing was safe, it was all worth it. When he heard that Li Ximing had reached the Southern Borderlands unharmed, his heart finally settled.

'Overall, the major pieces haven't changed... This acceleration might not even be a bad thing!'

He had just calmed down when a new doubt surfaced.

'But this sealing of the mountain...'

This was not good. Li Suining had weathered countless storms in his past life, but he had never heard of such a drastic measure, one that amounted to confinement.

'Could it be... it happened in my past life, but wasn't as conspicuous, so I simply never heard about it?'

He silently entered his immortal cave and paced twice before his meditation cushion.

'In my past life, Uncle Jiangchun did keep a low profile... but I could still go and see him. This... this feels different. It's as if _I'm_ the one no one is allowed to see...'

A chill crept into Li Suining's heart. He stood frozen for a long moment before his brow furrowed. 'Could it be... something went wrong? Does the Daoist Master suspect me?'

He immediately took a silk cloth from his sleeve, dipped a brush in ink, and after a moment's thought, penned a long, flowing letter of greeting.

In the letter, Li Suining mentioned his own breakthrough and then casually inquired about the mountain being sealed. This wasn't a difficult gambit. He might appear to be a reclusive Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, but with the experience of his past life and his keen understanding of the current political climate, he could easily discern the truth, no matter what excuse he was given.

He called the old man back in.

"Old Du, do you happen to know where my youngest uncle is?"

Although Li Jiangchun was a genius rarely seen in a generation, he was always extremely low-key and cautious. The old servant, Du Dou, replied,

"I only heard he is in the inner formation, sir. I do not know his exact location within it."

Li Suining instructed, "Take this letter. Place it in a storage bag and do not remove it. Go directly to the inner formation and have someone deliver it to him."

Du Dou nodded quickly and hurried out, leaving Li Suining to pace anxiously. He let out a silent sigh. 'I hope I'm just overthinking this.'

Du Dou took the letter and hurried down the mountain. He crossed the lake, reached the main island, and stopped a respectable distance from the entrance to the inner formation. He bowed deeply.

"Lord Chen, I request your assistance in delivering a letter for my master."

The cultivator guarding the formation entrance had a stern expression. His hair was completely white, and he sat cross-legged with his hands in a meditative seal, like an old monk lost in trance. Despite his advanced age, his back was ramrod straight. A longsword was strapped to his back. This was the elder, Chen Donghe.

Chen Donghe was a veteran of several generations and a son-in-law to the branch lineage, giving him terrifyingly high seniority. He should have been enjoying a peaceful retirement, but ever since Li Qiuyang's passing, the old man had grown restless and insisted on taking up duties. Li Jiangzong dared not slight him, and after much deliberation, had assigned him to guard this formation entrance.

His voice was a low rumble.

"You're from Suining?"

"Yes, Elder!"

Chen Donghe took the letter and meticulously inspected it, even using a wisp of the formation's power to scan it for threats. He then turned his gaze to Du Dou, noting his plain mourning clothes.

"So, the news of Li Jiman's passing has already reached you."

Du Dou, hearing this sudden statement, answered cautiously, "Reporting to the Elder, yes. The master has passed."

The "master" he referred to was Li Jiman. His cultivation had been low, but he was the Lord of Eastern Mountain Yue. He was, in fact, one of Li Xuanxuan's maternal grandsons, a political piece once used to stabilize the Eastern Yue region.

He possessed half Li-family blood and had enjoyed a full measure of mortal wealth and glory. He sat on his throne for nearly a century, so long that his own sons and grandsons were plotting rebellion, before he finally stepped down to pursue cultivation. Now, having failed in his attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had finally perished.

Because he was from the main branch, Li Jiangzong had arranged a funeral of high standard. The Dili family of the Northern Yue region even hung white mourning banners in distant solidarity.

Chen Donghe stroked his white beard, his aged face twitching.

"He should have tried sooner," he said, his voice raspy. "He waited far too long."

He tucked the letter into his sleeve, hesitated for a moment, and then turned and stepped into the great formation.

Chen Donghe had been guarding this post for some time, but he had rarely entered the formation himself. Those qualified to go inside came and went as they pleased, and they all politely greeted him. He made a point to memorize their faces, thinking proudly, 'All of them... the chosen geniuses of my family.'

Stepping inside now, his vision was filled with a zenith of swirling purple mist and brilliant golden formation-lines underfoot. The sheer power made him flinch. He walked between tall, dark-golden pavilions, passed through three successive array gates, and finally arrived before a pool.

The pool was roughly ninety feet long. Its water was tranquil and clear, appearing no deeper than his knees. Nine bright lamps stood at its edge, casting a pale white light that seemed profoundly distant in the surrounding gloom, inspiring a sense of awe.

He looked up and saw a vast waterfall of pale purple mist pouring from the zenith. As it fell, it didn't splash but landed like soft cotton, piling up on the pool's surface. The circular jade platform in the center was empty.

But there _was_ a gleam of sword light.

The light drifted and bobbed, flashing in and out of sight. One moment it was a full moon, the next a waning crescent. One moment it was obscured as if by dark clouds, the next it was a field of pure radiance. Then, three streams of light, like flickering fish, merged into one within the cold lunar glow.

_Clang!_

The purple mist-fall was instantly severed. The top and bottom portions continued to flow, but a section in the middle had simply vanished. A crisp sword-hum echoed out, so sharp it made the old man dizzy.

"What is that!"

Chen Donghe stared, realizing the Li family was rising so fast that he, an elder, could no longer comprehend their methods. Suddenly, a soft voice called out nearby.

"Elder Chen!"

Chen Donghe spun around. A young man stood behind him, a pleasant smile on his face. He wore a white-feathered robe, green boots, and carried a cyan-bladed sword. The sight stunned the old man.

Chen Donghe was utterly terrified. A shivering cold pierced his very bones. He was suddenly lost, swept away in a turbulent river... He was squatting by dark, damp earth, a rough arrowhead clutched in his hand, the cold wind of early spring biting at him... The young sword immortal had only glanced at him, and his mind had been lost to the memory.

"Elder Chen?"

Li Jiangchun quickly steadied him and asked again. The voice pulled Chen Donghe back from the metaphorical river. He was drenched in a cold sweat, stammering,

"This junior... came to deliver a letter."

Li Jiangchun looked at him, surprised. He raised a hand and gently brushed it past the elder's face. The touch was like a spring breeze and a soft rain, instantly washing away the heart-pounding fear.

"Senior," he said warmly, "you should ask for some medicine to calm your heart-qi."

Chen Donghe nodded, still dazed. Li Jiangchun added reassuringly, "It is a common ailment of old age. Please don't worry."

The elder finally planted his feet firmly, gave the young man a deep bow, and handed over the letter. He retreated in a flurry, taking several steps back before glancing over his shoulder one last time. His heart ached.

'No wonder Li Xuanxuan favored him so much!'

Li Jiangchun watched him go, puzzled. He held the offered box, stepped forward into the drifting purple mist, and let out a long, heavy breath.

Only when his breath was fully exhaled did the purple waterfall resume its flow, crashing down with a roar and transforming into a dense, swirling purple cloud that billowed around him, making his feathered robes rustle.

From within the mist, three motes of agile moonlight emerged, circling him like living things. The lights were tapered at the front and round at the back, like bright feathers rippling with cyan-white light. In unison, they flipped and transformed into three bright, spiritual sparrows, alighting on his shoulders.

This was his Sword Origin—Crescent Moon.

In terms of Way of the Sword inheritance and Daoist Tradition dharma power, Li Jiangchun was the descendant most similar to the ancestor known as Moon Pavilion. His own dharma power was, however, ultimately different. It was Lesser Yin, not Supreme Yin, and thus possessed a more reserved, not-quite-full quality. For this reason, he had named it Crescent Moon.

Li Jiangchun had possessed his Sword Origin for some time now. In the intervening years, he had not only refined it and mastered the Autumn Moon's Accord, but most importantly, he had advanced his Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record—a technique for which he had painstakingly laid a foundation before Foundation Establishment—to the point where he could actively cast its arts!

Just using the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record was no simple feat. A cultivation art this profound and revered was typically something one only began to study upon reaching the Purple Mansion Realm.

'Once the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record is active, its two core components, "Treading the Water Mansion" and the "Long-March Pheasant Flame," operate automatically. They complement each other, generating wondrous effects and cultivating on my behalf. That's not even mentioning their myriad divine uses in combat!'

He had cultivated this art early for good reason. First, his primary cultivation method was an ancient one, leaving him at a severe disadvantage in terms of secret arts; he _needed_ the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record to compensate for his Dao-Profundity. Second, he was aiming to comprehend Sword Intent. He would likely be remaining in the Foundation Establishment Realm for a long time. The sooner he mastered this art, the more time he would save in the long run.

Even more incredible was the very pool at his feet.

It had been refined from the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew and was infused with Supreme Yin Moon Radiance. This meant that his Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record was perpetually benefiting from a pool of spiritual resources equivalent to the Lesser Yin of a Purple Mansion Realm expert!

Even with Li Jiangchun's considerable worldliness, he couldn't help but marvel at his circumstances.

'Even a Golden Core-level power could offer little more than this. That Qiushui and Qing Jifang... they probably have this exact level of treatment. Being here is like constantly cultivating in a Mystic Realm. For years, I've focused only on my spell arts and haven't actively cultivated at all, yet I've already reached the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm.'

If he wished, he could take a Talisman Pill right now and instantly break through to the late-Foundation Establishment Realm.

He knew this was all possible due to the Immortal Artifact and the Nine Mounds Daoist Tradition—a lineage already approaching the level of a Golden Core power. The luxury was extreme, and Li Jiangchun felt a tremor of anxiety.

'My only fear is that I will fail to meet the family's expectations.'

He silently lifted his sleeve and opened the box. As he read the letter, a look of delight crossed his face.

'Good news! He's already broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Such speed...'

But as he read on, his expression turned strange.

The matter concerning Li Suining had been a direct order from the Daoist Master. At the time, with the trouble on the island, Li Ximing had left in a hurry. But later, the old patriarch Li Xuanxuan had also come to him, clearly nervous. The truth was, Li Jiangchun trusted Li Suining a great deal.

But trust was one thing, orders were another. He took out a brush and, after a moment's thought, smiled and began to write his reply.

His own letter was also filled with confusion. He claimed he, too, was confined to the inner formation, unable to leave, and that his suffering was terrible—he didn't even have a single attendant. He finished by tactfully asking: "Since you, Suining, still have people at your disposal, I must ask you to gather any news and inform me!"

He put away the brush. One of the sword-sparrows on his shoulder immediately snatched up the reply and darted out of the formation. Li Jiangchun took up his sword again and moved through his forms. He practiced for a while before stopping abruptly, as if struck by a sudden insight.

'That's it. I never leave this place. No wonder my Sword Origin is progressing so slowly! My ancestor either slew powerful experts, pacified the Southern Sea, or slaughtered countless Demons. I'm just here, trying to build a chariot behind closed doors. I'm lucky to have made any progress at all!'

He instantly sheathed his sword, letting it rest in the heavy purple mist. He then took out the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record to cultivate.

'The Way of the Sword... it needs to see blood.'




# Chapter 1084: The Invitation

Jinghai.

Dust plumed on the official road. A long, unbroken column of troops snaked like a river, their beginning and end lost in the distance. The man at their head flicked his whip absently, his mind clearly elsewhere.

'Sending me to the Southern Borderlands... What kind of assignment is this, really?'

Li Jiangxia's gaze drifted, skimming the distant mountain scenery. All the confidence he'd shown in the palace was gone, replaced by a heavy mood.

'The Southern Borderlands...'

It wasn't that Li Jiangxia was unwilling to go to such a remote place. And Li Ximing wasn't a harsh person; he might even have words of praise for him. But his thoughts were on other matters.

'Now that I am a Holder of the Profound, I don't need to be leading troops. The best thing would be to find a quiet place to properly forge my immortal foundations and elevate my divine ability...'

Jiangbei might look like it was descending into chaos, but the great war between north and south had just ended. No new major conflicts would erupt anytime soon. The White River region, nestled between Tangdao Mountain and Moongaze Lake, was actually one of the few places one could cultivate in peace.

The Southern Borderlands, on the other hand, while not a threat to his life-mandate, was plagued by constant skirmishes. How could he find any time to cultivate there?

His mood had thus been sour for the entire journey. He rode his prized steed in silence, eyes narrowed slightly.

'I wonder which secret art Li Jiangqian has reached. The family's Li Fire cultivation method is formidable; he must be on the second or third art by now. The honor of being the first to break through to the divine ability realm should fall to him!'

Li Jiangxia actually hoped Li Jiangqian would succeed. A smile touched his thoughts.

'That elder brother of mine is the most decisive and strategic. The path he finds will surely be extraordinary. As his younger brother, I'll get to see his methods and skills firsthand. It will be a good reference.'

As he was pondering, he suddenly looked up, sensing something. In the distant mountain peaks, lightning flashed and thunder roared. Snow billowed as divine abilities clashed, shaking the Great Void itself. His mind went still.

'They've already started!'

His expression turned solemn. He sank his spiritual sense into his sea of Qi, connecting it upward to his Shengyang Acupoint.

High in the sky, the dense clouds suddenly dispersed. The Martial Cultivation Star blazed with sudden, brilliant white light. A wisp of water and fire surged from his dantian, transforming into the miracle of True Qi!

He rose, treading on water and fire, and saw the distant wilderness trembling. A mountain-sized, black-backed great Demon was crouched among the peaks. It commanded a dark, jade-green light. It had four limbs and a tail, a lean, canine body, and a round, flat head that looked unsettlingly human. Its face was covered in a thin layer of white fur, and its eyes were pitch-black, its mouth filled with sharp fangs.

The Demon's face was ferocious. With its hands raised, it was physically holding up an immense Celestial Gate hovering in mid-air. A man in pale-gold Daoist robes stood atop the Celestial Gate, hands clasped behind his back, his expression ice-cold.

It was Li Ximing!

Li Jiangxia channeled his water and fire and laughed loudly.

"Ancestor! I'm here to help!"

The Daoist Master raised his eyebrows, looking at him with considerable surprise. He saw the young man press his palms together at his chest, join two fingers, and raise them to the level of his brow. Li Jiangxia intoned:

"Light of Serene Pacification!"

Instantly, the stars in the sky flared. Water and fire intertwined and fell abruptly, transforming into a fiery rain like sweet dew. It scattered down, covering a hundred-mile radius. A single beam of light shot out from within it, striking the Demon's body squarely.

The Demon let out an earth-shattering roar. Li Ximing considered this for a moment, thinking to himself:

'What a powerful Profound Light!'

'With my current insight, while this light is a far cry from the Great Parting's White Brilliance, it's already not inferior to my own Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!'

'Even more remarkable is the natural ease with which he manipulates water, fire, and True Qi within that light... It's completely unlike what a Bright Yang cultivator should be capable of.'

He lowered his head and sighed inwardly.

'It truly is different. Seeing him use this Dharma Art so easily, his potential is probably far higher than the supposed upper limit of a Merciful One... No wonder Situ Huo was so eager to cozy up to him!'

He smiled faintly, pulled him up onto the Celestial Gate, and said,

"Jiangxia, you're here? Are you coming to..."

"I am under orders to guard the Southern Borderlands for you, Daoist Master!"

Even though Li Jiangxia had expected it, seeing for himself that Li Ximing's attitude toward him was good, the young man secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He felt a bit more at ease and, while forming hand seals to cast an art, he asked,

"Which Demon King is this?"

"It's Great King Black-Back, one of the Bifeng Mountain Lord's subordinates."

Li Ximing replied casually, applying pressure with his arts, but in no apparent hurry.

"He cultivates 'Gathering Wood.' He only became a Demon King by leveraging the martyrdom of Yuanxiu. He's a black-backed demon dog with a trace of noble blood. I had to suppress him for a full incense stick's time before he'd show his true form."

In truth, Li Ximing's combat strength was quite high. With his spirit fire, he could probably even fight on autopilot. But when you added the terrifying Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire, it was enough to make anyone take notice. And of all things, this Demon just had to cultivate Gathering Wood!

Merging Fire burning Gathering Wood... it was like a wildfire in a dense forest. It wouldn't stop until everything was burned to cinders!

'If I really got serious... one blast of the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire, and nine times out of ten, he'd be screaming for his ancestors!'

But he didn't need to dwell on it. Right now, Can Lufu was surely watching from the Great Void. For Li Ximing, just knowing his advantage was a victory in itself. He naturally wouldn't alert the enemy; he would just treat this as Emperor Song's mission and drag it out, going through the motions.

He turned his head and smiled.

"I was just dragging my feet here, putting on a lazy show. Now that you've shown up, you're going to scare that old snake into pulling his piece back!"

Li Jiangxia raised an eyebrow and grinned. Sure enough, thunder rolled from the south as dark clouds swept in. Another Demon King was rushing over as a reinforcement. Li Ximing immediately retracted his divine ability, letting the dog Demon go.

This Demon, however, was used to lording over the Southern Borderlands. Being suppressed by a single divine ability was already humiliating. Seeing the two of them ignore him as if he were nothing, he was so angry he started to laugh. He didn't hold back, sneering coldly,

"You're cultivating a dead-end path that'll get your ancestors killed, and you still dare to point fingers at Lord Bifeng? What are you?!"

This remark made Li Ximing, who had been about to pack it in, pause. He gave the Demon a strange look. Li Jiangxia, however, just raised an eyebrow and sneered.

"What a loyal 'Gathering Wood' hound, daring to bark at the gate of Bright Yang and Li Fire. Just wait until King Wei perfects his divine ability and comes to Can Lufu's mountain to capture you. We'll see then if Can Lufu dares to step out and repay that loyalty of yours!"

This retort struck Great King Black-Back silent. How could he not know Can Lufu's way of doing things?

That mountain lord had escaped from the Dragon-kin, but he still lived under the shadow of those centuries. He was cautious to an extreme, seeing the Dragon-kin's intent to kill him in everything. If Li Zhouwei one day truly perfected his divine ability and came to the Southern Borderlands, how would Can Lufu possibly dare to show his face?

He retreated in a hurry, but Li Ximing was frowning.

'Among the Demon Kings under Can Lufu and those friendly to him, this newly broken-through Great King Black-Back is the easiest to eliminate. I just hope I didn't scare him off for good.'

So, he pulled back and started to head back with Li Jiangxia, his mind turning over other thoughts. He smiled and said,

"You wielded that True Qi divine ability today with such natural ease!"

Li Jiangxia knew what he was asking. He bowed slightly and replied,

"With the blessing of Tianwu, when I cultivate True Qi arts, it is as if I were a true cultivator. With the bestowed Qi, I naturally grasp all sorts of Dharma Arts. It is related to my mental state and Dao-Profundity, not this junior's own ability!"

Li Jiangxia held nothing back, explaining all the wondrous aspects one by one. Li Ximing finally asked the most crucial question.

"Buddhist cultivators draw upon the light of the Buddhist Land. If they are cut off from the Great Void, they become like rootless water, greatly weakened. This Tianwu True Qi... does it have a similar flaw?"

Li Jiangxia shook his head slightly.

"The light of Tianwu is bestowed by the Martial Cultivation Star. It has nothing to do with the Great Void. Unless one trespasses into the domain of a True Monarch or enters a land where Martial Cultivation does not shine, it will not be diminished..."

Li Ximing paced a step.

"Impressive..."

A Holder of the Profound, by raising their Shengyang Acupoint, gains the power of a divine ability, but not a specific, concrete one. They still require all the other powers of the Great Void, like water and fire. Back then, Li Jiangliang compared them to a Merciful One. Their strength is similar, but their essence is fundamentally different.

A Merciful One's cultivation involves verifying their position in the 'non-retrograde' land of the Buddhist Land—in immortal cultivator terms, their Shengyang Acupoint is _in_ the Buddhist Land. Thus, no matter how they die, unless the Great Void itself is severed, they always have a path of retreat. But a Holder of the Profound's Shengyang Manor never leaves their mortal shell. Instead, it is sensed by the Martial Cultivation Star, and the divine miracle descends from the heavens, surging within their Shengyang Acupoint.

If a Merciful One is a tenant farmer of the Buddhist Land, a Holder of the Profound is, to put it nicely, a favored guest retainer. To put it bluntly, they are a private soldier. They are not someone's personal property. While this grants them more freedom, death is true death. The divine miracle is immediately reclaimed by the star in the heavens, ready to be bestowed upon the next person appointed by Emperor Song, with almost no loss.

Everything has its pros and cons. Because of this, Li Jiangxia could even return the Profound Light and continue cultivating his own divine ability!

But while he praised it aloud, his heart was noncommittal. He sighed inwardly and mused,

'What Daoist Master Diyan mentioned, 'holding multiple external Profound Mysteries,' must be this path... It seems to be for those with no hope of achieving the Dao.'

The two had only been talking for a moment when a cultivator in white robes drifted down from the mountains. His eyes were bright and shining, full of spiritual energy. It was Cheng Qian!

But this Daoist Master Cheng Qian was not alone. Another Daoist Master appeared beside him, riding a cloud. He wore a robe patterned with waves and crescent moons, a light silver satin jade belt at his waist. His features were exceptionally handsome. He bowed slightly and smiled.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing... I have long heard of your great name!"

Li Ximing's spiritual sense swept over him and detected an aura of 'Supreme Yin.' His heart leaped.

'A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Supreme Yin Dao!'

This was the first time he had ever met a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Supreme Yin Dao!

His family had risen from obscurity relying on an Immortal Artifact that gushed Supreme Yin Moon Radiance day and night—an artifact that was very likely a supreme Dharma Treasure of the Supreme Yin Dao. He already felt a natural affinity for cultivators this Dao, and he found the man before him pleasing to the eye. He hesitated for a moment, then returned the bow politely.

"This Daoist Master is...?"

The young man raised a hand, his smile exceptionally warm.

"I am Che Hong, of the Chunyi Dao Gate!"

The suspicions in Li Ximing's heart were instantly confirmed. He bowed again.

"So it is a Daoist friend from the Chunyi Dao Gate!"

Although it was their first meeting, the atmosphere was harmonious. Li Jiangxia was perceptive and quickly bowed.

"Please, Daoist Masters, discuss your important matters. This junior was ordered to garrison the Shaman Kingdom, and my army is still on the road. I won't delay you."

He excused himself from the group. Cheng Qian, however, wore an odd expression and asked,

"Was that one of your family's Holders of the Profound? He must be King Wei's son... the one with the golden eyes."

This question made Che Hong turn his head in surprise. Li Ximing didn't want to elaborate and brushed it off with a few words. Che Hong listened for a moment, caught on, and smiled.

"I suppose I have some affinity with your noble clan! Years ago, I was on the coast with Qi Qiuxin, standing guard against the Purple-Gold demonic cultivators, when I unexpectedly met a member of your clan—she was... wielding thunder..."

Li Ximing had heard Qi Qiuxin mention this once. He understood immediately and smiled.

"That was my aunt, from the Qing generation, named Hong! ...She now serves at the Thunder Pool!"

Che Hong was visibly stunned. He froze for several breaths before saying, shocked,

"She... She is the Thunder Maiden of the Profound Pool... To think we have such a connection! My name is Xi Chang... The Thunder Maiden might remember me..."

Li Ximing just smiled. Che Hong, however, looked extremely chagrined and let out a long sigh.

"I have been disrespectful!"

Li Ximing shook his head, not acknowledging the apology, and simply asked:

"Daoist Master, your visit this time...?"

Che Hong finally snapped out of it. He rose, retrieved a white, osmanthus-patterned scroll from his sleeve, and held it with both hands, his expression solemn.

"By the grace of the Marsh's first light, our Dao is pure and one. We, the descendants, dare not be complacent. Our Daoist Tradition's Great Daoist Master, of the Yuan generation, named Yuanshang, now seeks completion. We respectfully invite fellow Daoists of the Immortal Mansion to observe the Profound Mystery, for the benefit of posterity..."

The two men in the mountains both froze. Cheng Qian immediately took a step back, avoiding a direct line, and said in a shaken voice,

"A Great Daoist Master is seeking the Dao!"

'Yuan... shang?'

Li Ximing had never heard this name, but just from his Daoist title, he knew this was an elder Daoist Master of a senior generation. He shot up from his seat, stunned.

"This...!"

Che Hong said gravely,

"Please."

Li Ximing composed his shocked expression, bowed very solemnly, and accepted the white, osmanthus-patterned scroll. He unfastened it and saw it was filled with flowing script. The invitation at the end was addressed to: Daoist Master Zhaojing and Daoist Master Minghuang of the Jingzhou Moongaze Marsh Family.

According to the rules of the Immortal Mansion, his family did indeed count as a vassal family. It was just that this status was no longer respectable, and no one had mentioned it for years. Reading it filled him with emotion. He rolled up the scroll and asked:

"The Great Daoist Master cultivates...?"

"Supreme Yin!"

Li Ximing was not unaware of the traditions of the Jiangnan Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Whenever a Great Daoist Master undertook the Quest for Gold, numerous cultivators would gather. It was just that after his own breakthrough, the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition had begun to decline. In all these years, the only one to properly attempt the Quest for Gold was Yuanxiu.

But Daoist Master Yuanxiu had used a strange secret art and couldn't suppress his Dharma body as he neared his breakthrough. It happened too suddenly, and no invitations were sent. Yuanshang was now the first in a long time!

He felt a sense of hope, even anticipation. He said with great sincerity,

"I wish the senior predecessor success in his Quest for Gold and ascension to become an Immortal of Heaven and Earth!"

Che Hong pressed his lips together and nodded.

"According to the old rules, you may bring one or two juniors to observe the ceremony. Originally... this was also to help the juniors form some connections..."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up at this. He instantly had candidates in mind.

'For the Supreme Yin Dao, Jiangchun is the most suitable! And maybe Que'Wan, who is about to enter seclusion... it would be a huge benefit for both of them! It's just a pity about Zhouwei... he's the one who needs it most...'

He nodded repeatedly, then glanced at Cheng Qian, noticing the Daoist Master's face was full of envy. As an overseas cultivator, he naturally had no right to attend.

Li Ximing's only concern was,

"It's just... I'm under orders to guard this mountain. It wouldn't be right to abandon my post..."

Che Hong smiled slightly and replied:

"The Yang Clan is aware of this. They should have already dispatched a cultivator to take over your watch."

Li Ximing understood immediately.

'No wonder... Two Daoist Masters were already more than enough. Why add Li Jiangxia into the mix!'

He was suddenly delighted and replied:

"I will go get my juniors and head to Chunyi immediately!"

Che Hong smiled.

"Please go quickly and return soon. Daoist Master Chen Yin has already arrived at Chunyi. He has asked for you three times, and is urgently pressing me to bring you over!"

Li Ximing quickly agreed, his mind bright with a new idea.

'That Great Pill of Supreme Yin of mine has been sitting in the clan treasury for so many years. I'll take it with me. I might just be able to sell it to the Chunyi Dao Gate for a good price. The timing is perfect!'

# Chapter 1085: The Disguise

The spiritual island of the Chunyi Dao Gate, known as Chunyi Island, was located in the Fenkuai Sea Region. Nestled among its mountains was the famous Seajade Peak. An old man in red robes paced the mountainside, his hands clasped behind his back. He waited for some time before a middle-aged sword cultivator finally descended from the heavens.

"Brother Ji'an!"

Hearing this, the old man quickly returned the courtesy and replied,

"Lingjiao…"

The sword cultivator nodded slightly in acknowledgment. His bearing was elegant, his refined features suggesting an exceptional pedigree. This was Daoist Master Fuxuan, a sword cultivator from the Chunyi Dao Gate who practiced the arts of the Supreme Yin.

The old man before him was none other than Daoist Master Ji'an, the one who had relinquished Mount Pai'er in the Northern Sea's Cang Prefecture. The two appeared to be old acquaintances, and the sword cultivator spoke with matching warmth.

"Old brother, your time cultivating on Dushan Island—how has it been?"

Daoist Master Ji'an stroked his beard and nodded.

"It's a valuable place, to be sure. Unfortunately, it has been used for far too long. Subsequent generations were unrestrained, drawing out too much of the baleful energies of metal, lightning, and fire. It's quite depleted now. Besides… its origins are a mystery."

A shadow crossed Fuxuan's features, and he shook his head.

"That island lies on the edge of the coastal waters, east of Chunyi. It wasn't large, initially. An ancestor granted it to a junior to seek a breakthrough and establish his family. But he later made some errors and was expelled from the sect. He took his clansmen and left, and the island was handed over to the Qu Clan."

"Who would have thought that the Qu Clan's new Daoist Master, having just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, would die a violent, premature death? The Qu Clan had no choice but to become our vassals. After a hundred years, they finally produced a young master with great promise, only for him to perish in the recent turmoil. They've fallen on harder and harder times... which is why they now wish to invite you, my friend, to establish your own gate on Dushan Island. The earth veins there have been rising and expanding in recent years. It was once a fire island, but it has since gained energies of metal, stone, and lightning. And it's very close to Chunyi..."

Daoist Master Ji'an paced a few steps, hands clasped behind him. He understood perfectly. Accepting this island meant, in all likelihood, tying himself to the Chunyi Dao Gate's chariot. He remained silent in contemplation before finally speaking.

"I hope to be able to glimpse the 'Great Parting Scripture'!"

"I understand!"

Fuxuan started to lead him down the peak, but he suddenly felt the jade talisman in his sleeve grow warm. A sense of unease struck him. He quickly reassured his guest.

"Leave this matter to me. I will be sure to make inquiries with Ting Province!"

He then excused himself and hurried away, flying swiftly over the sea. Following the guidance of the jade talisman and a trail of azure blossoms drifting on the waves, he landed on a desolate reef cluster.

Sure enough, a man in azure robes stood there waiting, his hands behind his back and a smile on his face.

"Daoist Friend Xi… long time no see!"

Fuxuan looked utterly exasperated. He stepped forward and sighed.

"Chi Buzi… what kind of mischief are you up to this time?"

Xi Lingjiao and Chi Buzi were acquaintances, of a sort. They had shared some grievances in their youth, but the Chunyi Dao Gate's rules were strict. Even though a matter concerning an ancestral inheritance had forged a slight bond between them, Xi Lingjiao knew he shouldn't associate closely with this man.

"You fiend… You already knew my Venerable Daoist Master was attempting his breakthrough. You could have just ridden the winds, hidden in a cloud bank, watched from afar, and left when you had the chance. Why must you show yourself and stir up trouble?"

Chi Buzi's smile faltered.

"What kind of reasoning is that? How could I, Chi Buzi, be the sort of person to sneak around, uninvited?"

Fuxuan gave him a peculiar look, staring fixedly.

"Haha." Chi Buzi laughed twice, then his expression turned serious. "I'm not here to cause trouble for you. I want to meet Li Ximing of Ting Province. I can never seem to find the right opportunity on a normal day."

Fuxuan immediately misunderstood, his face hardening.

"Today is the day of my Honored Master's breakthrough! You had better think very carefully about what you're doing!"

"Lingjiao, you misunderstand!" Chi Buzi shook his head, letting out a laugh. 

"Do I look like someone who would seek revenge for those few relatives of mine? Even if Chi Wei himself returned from the dead, I'd run him through without hesitation if he blocked my Dao path. I simply have important business to discuss with Li Ximing."

"His clan holds some... misunderstandings about me. I'm afraid he'll turn and flee the moment he sees me, which would just cause unnecessary complications."

The sword cultivator pressed his lips together.

"That's probably a mess of your own making."

Chi Buzi was thick-skinned. His expression unchanged, he simply smiled and stepped closer.

"Isn't that why I've come to ask you, brother? Just let me onto the island. Find a place for me... so I can meet him."

Fuxuan was no pedant; in fact, he was known as one of the most open-minded Daoist Masters in the Chunyi Dao Gate. Still, the request gave him a headache. 

"It's not that I mean to slight you, but this is a public event. My Honored Master is personally presiding. If he takes issue with your presence, this will not end cleanly!"

But Chi Buzi just sneered.

"You needn't worry. Just go and report it. Your master's heart is like a clear mirror; he won't make things difficult for you. Besides, the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is here, and even people from the Changhuai Daoist tradition and Cultivation Transcendence have come. How could Azure Pond not be represented?"

Fuxuan knew he had to report it. Shaking his head in resignation, he led Chi Buzi back toward the peak. Chi Buzi waited on a nearby islet, standing with his hands behind his back, gazing into the far west.

He, Chi Buzi, had traveled far and wide recently, searching all the way from the Northern Sea to the Southern Sea, investigating several Ancient Daoist Traditions.

'It's difficult to ask about the great one directly, but inquiring about the Fox-kin isn't hard at all.'

He had gathered a significant amount of information. Standing with his hands clasped behind him, his mind was already turning.

'This Fox clan... they truly are inextricably linked to the Immortal Mansion. I heard that the old ancestor of the Fox clan—that old Demon who perfected its divine ability countless years ago—was personally enlightened by an Immortal Mansion cultivator!'

'This so-called Immortal Mansion cultivator... could it be the one with the Daoist title Xuan'an?'

'But the more sensitive information... concerns that *other* Immortal Mansion cultivator, Li Jiangqun. If that's the case, why would Xuan'an completely ignore Li Jiangqun?'

Chi Buzi knew a fair bit about that affair, and his suspicion deepened.

'By that logic, the source of Li Chejing's Supreme Yin Moon Radiance must be compromised. It almost certainly came from the master of the Fox-kin... who must be Xuan'an, the power behind the Li Clan.'

'And since all of Xuan'an's schemes are hidden beneath the cover of the Dragon-kin, it's almost certain the two sides are secretly in league.'

Every word Dingjiao had spoken back then was precious to him, worth savoring and dissecting. The most important, of course, was the mention of Moongaze Lake.

'"Guidance upon Moongaze Lake..." "...went to Moongaze Lake and then roamed free beyond the seas..."'

Those were Dingjiao's exact words! And yet... Chi Buzi's own memory of his time on the lake was a complete blank. If he wanted to recover that missing piece, he would have to involve the Li Clan.

'More importantly, I must convey the Dragon-kin's stance—or at least, my arrangements with the Dragon-kin—back to that 'Lord'. He surely knows already, but I must make a full show of my loyalty. Better still if I can reach a tacit understanding with the Li family in the process.'

He stood with his hands clasped, his expression distant and shadowed.

'I just fear Li Ximing won't believe me.'

The azure-robed man waited a while longer. When the sword cultivator finally returned to fetch him, Fuxuan's expression was indeed strange, a look of complete surprise on his face.

"This way, please!"

Chi Buzi immediately stepped onto his Verdant Cloud and flew toward the island, grinning. When they reached the summit of Seajade Peak, he glanced into the Great Void and saw it shimmering with multicolored light.

"I haven't seen a spectacle this lively in many years."

Fuxuan led him onto the peak but clearly had no desire to speak with him, pretending not to hear the comment. As they entered the main grove, he warned him one last time.

"Do not cause a disturbance!"

Mist and clouds coiled through the mountain grove. A Daoist Master in white-gold robes stood within a pavilion, discussing important matters with a frown.

Li Ximing had brought Li Que'wan and Li Jiangchun along, intending to let them mingle with the juniors from the various Dao lineages. He had just seen them settled in the grove when he was pulled aside by Chen Yin upon reaching the summit.

Though it had only been a few years, Daoist Master Yushui was completely transformed. The sword cultivator, once gentle and possessing a strength that defied his age, was now white-haired and ravaged by grief. A cold light filled his eyes as he stood silently in the pavilion, his grim aura making one shudder.

The death of Chen Xuanyu had clearly dealt him a staggering blow, one so great it even took Li Ximing aback. He could only steady the older man.

"Venerable Master… my condolences."

Seeing Li Ximing, Chen Yin managed to force a slight smile.

"Congratulations on achieving the Life Divine Ability, Zhaojing. You must forgive my current state."

Li Ximing could only sigh in silence. Chen Yin didn't hesitate, his voice devoid of emotion.

"I hear the Song Emperor is selecting candidates to become a Holder of the Profound in the north. Are you aware of this, Zhaojing?"

Li Ximing had heard rumors, so he nodded. The old man cut straight to the chase.

"My clan has a junior named Wenyao. He is also a good friend of Jiangliang. The Li Clan has considerable influence in the Song Court. This position... I hope you can secure it for my family. Name any compensation you require, Ximing. Just ask."

Li Ximing understood. The old man made no effort to be subtle, raising the azure blade in his hand.

"You know that I sold my family's fortune in exchange for this spiritual sword, Ximing, but do not worry that I have nothing left to offer. Xuanyu was a peerless talent, a genius of our family's Way of the Sword not seen in three centuries. This spiritual blade was meant for him. Now that he has been murdered... our lineage is broken. Only Wenyao remains as a sliver of hope. I... I have little use for this anymore."

Li Ximing's heart grew heavy at his words.

"Senior, there is no need for this. In my clan, only Jianglong has any prospects for such a thing, but he currently serves under the Great General. You should be petitioning the correct channels."

Chen Yin was a sharp man and understood the hint. He nodded grimly.

"Many thanks for the guidance."

He sheathed his azure blade and walked away, his retreating figure the very picture of desolation. Li Ximing mulled over the man's rare 'commodity' for a moment. Just then, he saw Fuxuan approaching and smiled.

"Greetings, Senior Fuxuan!"

Fuxuan returned a polite smile.

"I have someone to introduce to you, Ximing."

In that instant, the Great Void trembled and an azure light flared. Li Ximing looked up—and froze.

A man in azure robes was strolling through the grove. He had long, flowing hair, azure robes, and startling green eyes. A small, exquisite bronze tripod hung from his waist, and he toyed with a string of black jade beads. He looked every bit the transcendent, otherworldly cultivator.

But Li Ximing's pupils constricted in an instant.

"Bu... zi!"

His first instinct was to bolt. He was already half a step into his escape, but fearing an ambush in the Great Void, he forced himself to stop. His Immortal Mirror activated instantly as he snapped,

"Senior, what is the meaning of this?!"

Fuxuan flushed with embarrassment at the outburst, inwardly cursing Chi Buzi's name. But the deed was done. He could only step forward and hurriedly try to smooth things over.

"Zhaojing, please! This fi... Daoist Friend Buzi has come in goodwill!"

Li Ximing's Immortal Mirror swept the area, already mapping an escape route through the Great Void. He instantly confirmed that Chi Buzi wasn't, in fact, here to kill him. He let out a silent breath of relief, but as his gaze focused on the man, his heart leaped into his throat.

Within the vision of the Immortal Mirror, the man was shrouded in a faint, illusory, multicolored light!

He spoke coldly, simultaneously retracting his Spirit Probe and schooling his features to hide his shock.

"What is there for me to discuss with... *him*?"

Fuxuan's embarrassment intensified. He was already cursing Chi Buzi internally. 'This fiend... usually he can talk the heavens down, a veritable silver-tongued devil. Now he doesn't dare squeak!'

But Chi Buzi was fully focused, carefully observing Li Ximing's expression. Only then did he offer a bow and smile.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, you needn't worry. If I cared a whit about Azure Pond, I would have become their pawn long ago. Do you think you could have avoided me so easily if I had?"

"But I have much to discuss with Ting Province. I have already crossed the threshold of the Purple Mystery and now seek only perfection. There is great potential for cooperation with King Wei. Even if you won't consider it for your own sake, Zhaojing, you should at least consider it for King Wei!"

He stood with his hands clasped, supremely confident, staring fixedly at Li Ximing. He watched as the man in the white-gold robes replied with a grim face and a cold voice,

"You know exactly what 'good deeds' you've done!"

Li Ximing appeared utterly resistant, his expression brimming with hatred. And yet, his mind flashed back to the past—to how miserable Chi Buzi had been on the lake, to the exact words he had spoken. He knew it all. What made him pause wasn't the strange light around the man, and it certainly wasn't the talk of King Wei. It was the memory of Chi Buzi from that day, the clear abnormality of his spiritual soul.

'This Chi Buzi... he is the only Purple Mansion Realm cultivator without talismanic protection to have ever looked directly at an Immortal Artifact!'

Chi Buzi was sharp. He heard the probe in Li Ximing's words loud and clear. He stepped forward, his voice turning cold.

"I know exactly what I've done. What are you going to do about it?"

His face was a natural mask, concealing a cold, unscrupulous heart. Though he was bluffing, he delivered the words with such crisp, arrogant certainty that it gave one pause.

Li Ximing fell silent, regarding him with cold eyes.

'Venerable Daoist Master Yuanshang is about to break through. There's no telling how many powerful entities are watching. This is no place for such a conversation!'

But Chi Buzi had already closed the distance. His eyes narrowed, and he spoke in a low, level voice.

"Have you already forgotten whose world this is? Have you forgotten how Li Jiangqun perished on that lake?"

Li Ximing watched him take a seat, perfectly at ease, and replied, "Then perhaps the Great Daoist Master can enlighten me."

Chi Buzi's gaze was distant.

"Back then, Li Jiangqun became a Form and Shadow... one formed from the great Supreme Yin Six Wheels. He possessed a Moon-Glaze body and walked the lands of Jiangnan. Though his spiritual sense was limited, he could steal treasures from Chi Wei, but they were captured back by him with a simple divination. He was a supreme-tier Profound Body!"

He spoke of Chi Wei as if discussing a complete stranger, his tone flat and without a ripple.

"Chi Wei mentioned that, more terrifyingly, the Profound Body was imbued with all manner of hidden arts. This type of divine ability required the Profound Body to experience the mortal world, cultivating the true path step-by-step. Li Jiangqun had secretly embedded a Karma-Drawing Heavenly Light Talisman within it. The moment that vessel shattered, it would instantly summon the Supreme Yin Profound Light to annihilate both spirit and form."

Hearing this, Li Ximing's heart trembled as if the sky were falling.

'Supreme Yin Profound Light!'

'Is it a coincidence, or is it the very same thing? The exact same name... Supreme Yin Profound Light!'

A secret the Li Clan had guarded for a hundred years had just been uttered as if it were nothing. Li Ximing was shaken to his core. Chi Buzi continued quietly,

"With such a profound technique at play, the other Purple Mansion Realm masters didn't dare touch that karma. They certainly wouldn't allow him to perfect that divine ability and become a true Profound Body of the Purple Mansion Realm. He was indeed at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm with five divine abilities, true. But few knew his Form and Shadow was from an ancient Daoist tradition, one that required tempering in the mortal world, like a new avatar, to break through. It wasn't perfected at the time, so he wasn't truly complete. When the time came for the siege, countless Foundation Establishment Realm disciples from every sect threw themselves into the fray, wave after wave, until that Moon-Glaze body was utterly ground into dust."

Chi Buzi's voice was low and detached.

"If even Li Jiangqun ended up like that, it's clear that 'Lord' of yours can barely protect himself. He's struggling just to hold on to Mount Dali. What makes you think he can intervene in the affairs of the Bright Yang Dao?"

'Lord?'

The word made Li Ximing flinch. But he smiled.

"King Wei wishes to achieve his Dao. His only path lies with the True Dragons!"

As soon as this was said, Fuxuan, who had been listening intently, finally understood. He had personally witnessed the exchange between Wei Xuanyin and Chi Buzi. Hearing this, it all clicked into place.

'This fiend... he's finally thrown in his lot with the Dragon-kin. He's preparing for the Converging Water!'





# Chapter 1086: Comings and Goings

Chi Buzi watched him, his expression serene.

'I considered countless ways to phrase this on my way here,' Chi Buzi thought.

'But it doesn't matter. This mountain is undoubtedly crawling with the eyes and ears of those great figures. I cannot reveal too much. If I say anything that even touches upon the plans of the patron backing the Li Clan, I'll be inviting a fatal disaster!'

'My lack of memory about the lake incident reveals two things.'

'First, this powerful being is likely confined to that lake. He must have made an immense sacrifice during the fall of the Immortal Mansion, so great that He cannot even show His face. Why else would He need to be so secretive? Second, He don't want to expose our connection... or perhaps, His "compromise" was a calculated move, designed to use me to acquire even greater benefits.'

'Since the power behind the Fox-kin is an Immortal Mansion cultivator, what other reason could He have for using me? It's clearly for the restoration of the Water Mansion!'

'The station of the Water Mansion is far from ordinary. In the eyes of a cultivator like me, Chi Buzi, with my deep Dao-Profundity and ancient lineage, it is exceptionally special. The Water Mansion has lost its vastness... that phrase is no empty talk!'

'In ancient times, there was a great upheaval. Dongfang Rijiu, the leader of the Hornless Dragon lineage, secretly lent his aid to the master of the orthodox 'Pit Water' position. Together, they slew the Profound Giant Turtle and borrowed the very essence of the Water Mansion's vastness...'

'The master of Pit Water seized that vastness, but then failed in his breakthrough to the Dao Embryo realm and perished. Ever since, that essence of vastness has been locked within the Pit Water Fruition Attainment, unable to be released.'

'The consequence of this 'Orthodox Position Seizing the Abyss' is that the true Pit Water position became nearly impossible to attain. Subsequent Water Mansion cultivators could not claim its full inheritance. Instead, they mostly achieved Leap positions, subservient to the Three Yins. The Dao became twisted and perilous, its masters ephemeral. But it is not a dead end! It is a path I can successfully claim!'

Thus, the purpose of the Fox-kin placing him into the hands of the Dragon-kin became clear,

'Judging by what Dingjiao implied, it's highly likely this Lord Xuan'an is no longer willing to guard the Immortal Mansion and has decided to seek His own fortune. That's why He placed a wager on me, hoping to cultivate an allied True Monarch. But even though the Water Mansion has lost its vastness and is a shadow of its former self, there are still countless people who would prevent the Immortal Mansion's remnants from rising from the ashes. He must have concealed this scheme beneath the Dragon-kin's plot to eliminate the Pristine Water Feathered Serpent. That explains the whole arrangement!'

Having clarified this, his, Chi Buzi's, objectives narrowed down to two crucial points.

'First, for my own survival, I must find a way—in full public view—to officially align myself with the Dragon-kin.'

'In the current situation, before I attain the Dao, there's no guarantee someone won't try to harm me. Only Du Qing and the Dragon-kin have a vested interest in protecting me. Since that great figure exposed my weakness to the Dragon-kin, it was a signal for me to seek refuge with them. This is my lifeline, and it's also a cover for that great figure... After all, Du Qing's influence is limited to the mainland. To operate overseas, I must rely on the Dragon-kin!'

'Who Li Zhouwei actually supports is irrelevant. What matters is using his words to drape this dragon's hide over me, Chi Buzi!'

'Second, and only then, can I show my loyalty to that great figure.'

He, Chi Buzi, had to make his allegiance crystal clear. Only then might he obtain the most important thing of all:

The Quest for Gold method!

An Immortal Mansion-grade Water Mansion Quest for Gold method!

'But to pledge my loyalty here would destroy Xuan'an's scheme and be the end of my own life. I will not underestimate the perception of these great figures. When I finally face Xuan'an, I only need to indicate that I've successfully allied with the Dragon-kin. Anything more, even one extra word... would be exposing His entire plan!'

It was this complex web of considerations that led Chi Buzi to adopt the Dragon-kin's stance.

As for mentioning Li Jiangqun, that was to confirm whether Li Ximing truly knew who stood behind him.

'A great figure?'

But when Li Ximing heard this, his mind became perfectly clear, and a name surfaced in his thoughts.

'Is it Lord Zhengao? Or... which great figure could it be?'

'I haven't forgotten where the token for the High Firmament Pavilion in my possession came from! It was left behind by Li Jiangqun all those years ago, and my clan even used his immortal merits... But behind that Immortal Mirror isn't just one great figure. It's the entirety of the Heavens!'

'In terms of Dao-Profundity, spiritual lineage, and even our true political backing, you could say my clan has inherited Li Jiangqun's mantle!'

'For Chi Buzi to mention Li Jiangqun specifically... it's hard to say it isn't a hint!'

He fell silent for a moment, his brow furrowing slightly, and then replied,

"The great lineages have already made contact several times. It's surprising they'd trouble the Daoist Master to come and read another decree."

Chi Buzi needed only that one glance to understand.

'Assuming Li Ximing isn't trying to be clever or deliberately deceive me, he has likely grasped something. He isn't completely ignorant of who is behind me. He might even be a participant.'

He lowered his gaze slightly and said casually,

"There are differences between the ancestral branches."

Li Ximing stared at him intently. Chi Buzi had already stepped forward, speaking softly,

"I have served under the Dragon King for many years, avoiding calamity and seeking but a single opportunity to pursue the Dao. But I have not ignored worldly affairs completely. If King Wei hadn't met with the Dragon Prince long ago, how could I have sat by and done nothing for all these years? And how else would your esteemed clan have survived peacefully to this day?"

Li Ximing frowned and looked up, inwardly alarmed.

'An opportunity to pursue the Dao... No wonder. He threw in his lot with the Dragons!'

Chi Buzi simply stared at him, his eyes narrowed slightly, as he listened to Li Ximing's cold laugh.

"No wonder you don't dare return to the mainland. I wonder how many people there would tolerate your presence, 'Daoist friend'!"

He had probed four times in a row. With just this one sentence, Chi Buzi had finally distinguished truth from falsehood. His mind cleared, and everything became obvious,

'Li Ximing might know a few scraps, but he absolutely does not know the real key. The true master of the Li Clan, the one who actually serves that great figure, must be Li Zhouwei. This Alchemist has only heard fragments and rumors!'

'It's simple. Li Ximing almost certainly assumes I am seeking the Pristine Water! He also must not know about the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. Otherwise, why would he even mention me returning to the mainland?!'

'The Dragon-kin and the Pristine Water are at odds, so it's perfectly logical for them to support me. Li Ximing's judgment is sound. But the illogical part of this whole affair is that the Pristine Water also supports my Quest for Gold!'

'In that case... if I want to safely connect with that great figure, the only suitable target is Li Zhouwei!'

As his thoughts reached this point, he sensed Fuxuan behind him, his face twisting in discomfort. He had opened his mouth several times and was now visibly agitated.

'No matter. I've already managed to probe a few things. Since he's useless... talking to him any further will only arouse unnecessary suspicion.'

The two of them were probing each other covertly, much to Fuxuan's misery.

'These two... these two! They're really treating my Chunyi Dao Gate like it's just any old place!'

'Even they know that my family's Great Daoist Master Yuanshang is on the verge of a breakthrough, and that a host of great figures from the Great Void and Beyond the Heavens will be watching. How could I, Fuxuan, not know?! Every word they say makes my heart pound and my head split!'

'If I let you two keep talking, are you going to drag the Pristine Water and the Dragon Monarch into it? Do you know how many great figures are staring at this tiny little place right now? If a Heavenly Glow descends on my mountain because of this, how is my Master supposed to complete his breakthrough?!'

His expression was awful. He shot Chi Buzi a venomous glare and was just about to speak when he saw a man in white robes hurrying up the mountain path. The man wore a robe patterned with waves and crescent moons. It was Daoist Master Che Hong. He bowed to the two of them and said,

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing... The Great Daoist Master requests your presence!"

Li Ximing's face turned solemn, though he sighed inwardly. He turned to Chi Buzi, his eyes narrowing slightly, and replied,

"Daoist Master, serving under the Dragon-kin now... you've certainly found yourself a fine master. We shall see how this plays out!"

Chi Buzi just roared with laughter. Under Fuxuan's murderous gaze, his form shifted, transforming into a splash of clear Pristine Water, and vanished into the depths of the Great Void.

Li Ximing flicked his sleeve and followed Che Hong deeper into the mountain. His heart grew heavy once more, and he remained silent for a long time.

'Chi Buzi... is he even the same person anymore?'

'The man before me was definitely not the half-human, half-ghost Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from all those years ago. But after that encounter, Chi Buzi couldn't have remained completely unchanged... It's possible he's been possessed by that Immortal Official, merely wearing his original appearance as a disguise!'

'What shook me even more was what I saw through the Immortal Mirror's sight: a vibrant light emanating from his body! The light was a hazy gray, yet it was incredibly dense, pulsing with a vigorous might!'

'He is the second person I've seen with a shimmering radiance under the Immortal Mirror's sight...'

'The first was Li Suining, who is still under house arrest back home. And I saw it clearly: although the colors of their radiances were different, the form was identical. They shared the same root, the same source!'

'What does this mean?!'

Li Ximing was instantly silenced by the thought.

'If Chi Buzi has likely been possessed, becoming a hidden agent of that Immortal Official from the Immortal Mirror, or perhaps of the Heavens themselves... then is it possible that Li Suining, back home, is also a pawn of the Heavens? Or that the opportunity he gained was a boon granted by the Heavens?'

The uncertainty lingered in his mind, leaving him distracted and shaken. He didn't snap out of it until Che Hong, leading him, stopped before a stone gate. He heard the white-robed Daoist Master say,

"Daoist friend, please!"

He looked up and saw, hanging in the depths of the cave abode, a mirror shimmering with silver light!

The mirror was no more than eight inches across. Its frame was snow-white, its surface as clear as moonlight, and it was adorned with patterns of auspicious clouds supporting the moon. The frame itself was carved with coiling Hornless Dragons. Merely hanging there, it emanated an aura of terrifying power.

'A Spiritual Treasure!'

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow slightly, marveling at the treasure's power, but he also felt a twinge of something else.

'It really is a spiritual mirror.'

Che Hong bowed deeply. A cascade of silvery light sprinkled down, and layers upon layers of osmanthus blossoms piled up like snow. The two of them passed deep into it, as if entering an entirely new world.

Before them stood a simple table and a single chair. An old man stood beside the round table.

He was not tall, with snow-white hair and a full, rounded forehead. His eyes were ancient and filled with vicissitude. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back. When the two approached, he turned his head slightly and spoke,

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

This was none other than Daoist Master Yuanshang!

Che Hong had already bowed and stepped aside. Li Ximing hurriedly returned the courtesy, saying:

"This junior is unworthy!"

As he bowed, he raised his eyes to look. The Great Daoist Master was also looking at him.

This Great Daoist Master's divine ability was clearly perfected, yet his appearance held no trace of profound mystery. His gaze was exceptionally gentle, tinged with a look of gratified joy. His pair of gray-black eyes gazed over, allowing Li Ximing to relax somewhat.

Yuanshang lowered his head and said,

"That is not quite accurate... You and I... we should be considered family."

Li Ximing was slightly taken aback. He saw Daoist Master Yuanshang smile.

"When the Great Ning State was founded, the Xi Clan and the Ning-Li Clan were joined by marriage. My grandmother's surname was also Li."

Li Ximing had actually anticipated something like this, but he still hesitated, saying,

"These days, the world knows my family as part of the Wei-Li Bright Yang bloodline..."

Daoist Master Yuanshang waved his hand, motioning for him to sit. "The Wei-Li are not necessarily the Ning-Li, but the Ning-Li are definitely Wei-Li. Back then, among the Bright Yang Wei-Li, a branch cultivated in the Immortal Mansion. Among them was a great figure who, while traveling, came to study under the Wandering Immortal Wu Che. His surname was Li, and his respected name was Hengqing. He was a great figure who had perfected the Supreme Yin and ascended to the pinnacle."

Li Ximing's breath caught in his chest. He hesitated, stunned.

"To think... such a noble origin!"

He had imagined many possible origins, but he had never once thought that an ancestor of the Ning-Li Clan was actually a True Monarch!

"How could we have... fallen to such a state!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang shook his head and sighed.

"Later, it seems this True Monarch perished in his pursuit of the Dao, but he left behind his bloodline. They received a mandate from the Wei and were enfiefed in Jiangbei, becoming the Jiangbei Li Clan. Over the years, they produced numerous geniuses, including many who perfected their divine ability!"

"And Daoist Master Donghua was the most outstanding among them!"

Yuanshang turned, a profound depth entering his gaze.

"Yuansu... Yuansu knew all along! He used the name of the Bright Yang Li Clan merely to protect you!"

Yuanshang was younger. In the era when he cultivated, the Chunyi Dao Gate was still very weak and not even recognized by the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. But even so, he had met Yuanxiu and Yuansu. How could he not be moved?

Hearing this, Li Ximing rose to his feet.

"So that's how it was..."

The old man's expression dimmed. He turned to look at Li Ximing, his lips moving.

"That matter, all those years ago... it wasn't that we didn't know. In fact, Fuxuan went to inquire! But... by that time, we could no longer persuade Chi Wei... and we couldn't risk a major conflict..."

Li Ximing understood he was speaking of his ancestors. But having seen so much indifference in the world, he actually felt Daoist Master Yuanshang was being too hard on himself. He raised his brow.

"How can this be blamed on you, Senior!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang took a step forward and said simply, "This blame falls on me."

His eyes were filled with sorrow, even a deep-seated shame. His lips trembled as he spoke.

"Back then, the last Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Ning-Li Immortal Clan... Great Daoist Master Guanyu... entered seclusion in my sect. He entrusted the last of the Ning-Li legacy to us. He not only filled in the many missing and altered cultivation methods in our lineage, but he also used his vast resources to help our sect survive its darkest hour... This debt of gratitude... I should never have forgotten it!"

"But at that time, I was still focused on refining my divine ability... and Fuxuan... he did not dare to offend that fiend!"

The old man took a step back and bowed deeply.

"This is truly my sin."

Li Ximing was stunned by this barrage of revelations, unsure how to react. Honestly, whether it was the Ning-Li or the Wei-Li, it was all too remote. The Li Clan was already collapsing under the weight of the Wei-Li legacy; how could they possibly bear the karmic burden of the Ning-Li as well?

He stepped back from his seat and stood, lowering his gaze.

"Senior, you overstate things!"

But Che Hong, who had been watching from the side, felt his heart ache. He moved to support the old man.

"Great Daoist Master... didn't you also take out all the scriptures from our sect for him to study? Didn't you gift him secret methods and that precious Mystic Pill from our treasury? Even if there is a debt, how great can it be!"

Hearing this, Yuanshang's expression grew even darker. He was silent for a long moment, his eyes filled with a long-accumulated gloom. He whipped his head around, hissing through clenched teeth,

"Ignorant child... You are an ignorant child!"

The old man's expression flickered, and it was unclear who he was cursing. But Che Hong, having been rebuked so harshly, looked terrified. His hands trembled, and he didn't dare to support him, crying out in alarm,

"My lord... compose yourself... my lord!"

# Chapter 1087: Taking the Pill

Their old ancestor, Daoist Master Yuanshang, had long since exhausted his natural lifespan. He had relied on the protection of a Spiritual Treasure for many years, nourishing his life-mandate with secret arts and spiritual resources. The Underworld had also been lenient with him, allowing him to cling to a thread of life until this very day…

Daoist Master Che Hong understood the profound mysteries of the situation better than anyone. They had been pushed into this corner step by step over the years, and today’s Quest for Gold was a desperate, last-ditch effort with no path of retreat.

'The Great Daoist Master spent three years adjusting his aura to its absolute peak, calming his heart and mind. If he misses this chance, he won't have another three years to seek the Dao!'

As Daoist Master Che Hong pleaded bitterly, Yuanshang's expression suddenly grew calm. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his voice distant.

"I know full well how sordid the affair with Ning-Li was. It's truly laughable. The last time the entire Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition worked together, the last time we were of one mind… was to conspire to seize a treasure from Li Jiangqun."

"It's no surprise that the Supreme Yang has lost its brilliance today!"

Li Ximing opened his mouth to speak but fell silent. Yuanshang stood lost in thought within the grotto-heaven, his voice a low murmur.

"Success was because of him, and so was failure. The Xuyu's and Tiaoxiao's Dao lineages were both destroyed, Yuanxiu went his own way, Yuanwu's ambitious Profound Pill was ruined, and Jinzhou was murdered. If not for that figure in the north intervening to protect him, there would be no True Monarch Shangyuan today…"

He paced with an unsteady gait.

"Chi Wei reaped the greatest benefits and seemed quite pleased with himself, but that wasn't the whole truth. Stripping him of over a hundred years of his lifespan while he was young and arrogant was not a futile effort. In the end, he understood it too—he could not seek the Gold."

"After thinking it over and over, I realized only one person truly escaped unscathed back then… Qiushui."

The old man’s face showed a deep weariness.

"She… because of True Monarch Taiyuan…"

At this, he seemed overwhelmed, coughing twice before letting out a cold, sharp laugh.

"But… but I don’t believe it… She was so close to Ning Tiaoxiao back then, so genuine. Such false sentiment could never have deceived him… She must have been in pain!"

His coughing grew violent, and he bent over, unable to straighten his back. Che Hong stepped forward, his heart aching as he supported the old man, only to see him smile again.

"I thought at the time that my Chunyi Dao Gate had simply abided by the rules and not participated. Now I see we were being saved for another purpose!"

As he spoke these words, the entire illusory realm began to tremble. The laurel trees standing in the courtyard shook wildly, their snow-white blossoms scattering like a blizzard, piling up and tumbling across the ground.

_RUMBLE!_

Amidst the tremors of the Great Void, Che Hong’s choked voice called out once more.

"Ancestor!"

Li Ximing also sensed that something was terribly wrong. The Great Void was shaking with the violence of a collapsing mountain. Wisps of Supreme Yin spiritual energy shot past him, and a dreadful realization struck him.

'This Great Daoist Master… is about to lose control of his cultivation!'

He immediately stepped forward and urged, "Senior!"

His single word was more effective than all of Che Hong’s pleas. Daoist Master Yuanshang whipped his head around, his eyes locking onto him.

The old man's face was covered in a dense, intricate web of fine white lines. The markings were curved like crescent moons, linked end to end, tracing a path from his eyelids down to his jaw before disappearing beneath the collar of his feathered robes. Every single line pulsed with a brilliant lunar light.

His pupils had turned a stark greyish-white, and every inch of his skin trembled. An intangible radiance, mingled with a liquid sheen, flowed from the creases of his wrinkles with a soft hiss. The fissure on his brow had deepened to the bone, as if a third eye were about to open.

A suffocating and immense pressure washed over them, unlike any power Li Ximing had ever felt. It was an aura of absolute authority, of dominion over life and death.

'This is a qualitative shift… His divine ability is about to merge with his life-mandate!'

Li Ximing had never expected this moment to arrive so suddenly. His scalp prickled. With lightning speed, he retrieved a prepared jade box from his sleeve, shattered it with a burst of his divine ability, and presented the large pill within.

"I came upon this pill in my travels, senior," he said in a low voice. "I do not know if it will be of any benefit to you!"

Those greyish-white eyes lowered, focusing on the pill nestled in his hands.

Instantly, the swirling, multicolored light filling the illusory realm froze. The dense Supreme Yin energy began to recede. Che Hong’s gaze paused, and then his eyes erupted with overwhelming joy.

"Sir! Sir, please wait!"

'This is…'

The pill was a milky white, inscribed with silver patterns of the serene Moon Laurel that shimmered with threads of silvery light. The sight made Che Hong’s pupils widen in shock.

Though he was no expert in alchemy, he understood the Supreme Yin!

'This is a great pill formed from the highest grade of Supreme Yin spiritual treasure! Its essence might even be comparable to the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch that Chi Buzi once possessed…'

He didn't hesitate for a moment, shouting urgently, "Zhaojing, this pill is the very solution my Dao needs! Please part with it, and you will be handsomely rewarded!"

Li Ximing had created this pill by a stroke of fortune years ago. It could extend one's life-mandate, aid in secluded cultivation breakthroughs, and even generate a stream of cold moon spiritual qi in the mouth to nourish the physical body. For Yuanshang, who was on the verge of his Quest for Gold, it was perfect.

But the illusory realm remained silent. Yuanshang's body trembled violently, his face contorting. His eyes had turned a pure, solid white, and two crystalline tears could be seen trickling from their corners, striking the ground with a crisp sound.

_Clink._

"Retribution…"

The old man took a step, his gaze fixed on the pill, tears streaming down his face. His voice was a twisted, sharp roar.

"It truly is retribution…"

Li Ximing stood frozen. The old man had already lurched forward, snatched the pill into his hand, and let two tracks of pure white tears course down his cheeks.

"Hahahahaha!"

He let out a wild, mournful laugh, his voice cracking with intensity.

"I'll take it! I'll take it, then!"

His cry sent ripples of invisible light through the air. The jade table and chairs, the silvery, shimmering illusion—everything dissolved like snow on hot coals. All the phantom colors vanished, revealing the gleaming silver walls of the cave-mansion.

The formation patterns lining the cave lit up under the surging tide of his divine ability and dharma power, then exploded into a shower of light before collapsing completely, plunging the world into darkness.

In the profound blackness, a single point of radiance appeared.

_BOOM!_

Seajade Peak, the highest mountain of the Chunyi Dao Gate, began to shake violently. Rocks, palaces, and everything upon it were bathed in a dreamlike moonlight.

Heavy, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and with them came a cold, piercing laugh that echoed across the heavens.

"My apologies for keeping you all waiting!"

It was unclear to whom he spoke. The divine abilities arrayed in the Great Void remained silent and still. Only the boundless dark clouds roiled across the sky, completely obscuring the bright moon in the endless night.

"Daoist Friend Xi, you are too polite!"

The response was sharp and thin, laced with a heavy gloom that settled into the night, causing Yuanshang to turn his head slightly.

The old man’s humble demeanor was gone, replaced by a cold, severe expression as he broke into a smile.

"I'm afraid you couldn't wait!"

_BOOM!_

A low rumble of thunder finally sounded from within the roiling clouds. Snow began to fall as the two sharp voices laughed again, their presence gradually fading until they vanished completely.

Yuanshang raised his head, his luminous white eyes piercing through the Great Void, seeing every figure with perfect clarity. Tears still streamed down his cheeks as he took a step forward. With a movement of his throat, he finally swallowed the pill and began to murmur an incantation.

'Supreme Yin pill-scape, prostrate before the sky's warming purity; grand radiance dawns, illuminating the nine radiances of the earth; witness the descent of the high true, refine the void's three energies, ascend the crimson clouds, and drift through the five phases…'

The dark clouds in the sky suddenly thinned, revealing a bright, clear moon. It waxed and waned in an unfixed, hazy dance, and the countless stars around it twinkled, casting down their brilliant light in unison.

The Waxing and Waning Moon!

In an instant, every divine ability in the Great Void focused its attention, unmoving. A single thought arose in everyone's mind:

'He has begun his Quest for Gold!'

Beneath his feet, vast palaces materialized layer by layer, followed by moon-white bridges and long hills of pale jade. They flashed past, revealing a jade gate the color of the moon, above which hung three large characters:

Morning Jade Palace.

A stir went through the heavens. The two faint figures began to whisper to each other.

"That's not the right path."

"No, this is The Waxing and Waning Moon. If he had cultivated the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, it should be Attaining the Grand Prime!"

The moonlight was enchanting, and the fine snow drifted on the wind. The faint sound of rustling could be heard, along with the deep, resonant croak of a toad as the phantom colors swirled back.

Startled Magpie's Domain!

In the sky, Yuanshang took another step, and magpie feathers mingled with the falling snow. Li Ximing was already standing in the Great Void, shielding his two juniors, watching the scene unfold with a distant look.

He was distracted, barely even in the mood to respond when Daoist Master Tianhuo appeared at his side. He merely gave a slight nod, his heart heavy.

'Retribution… what kind of retribution?'

_DONG!_

The world filled with a blinding radiance. Daoist Master Yuanshang stood with his hands behind his back as his Dharma Body began to crumble like an avalanche. Streaks and slivers of silver-white light broke away, coalescing in the sky to form a tiny, bright moon.

Conferring the Profound Pearl.

This moon was nothing like the magnificent White Jade Plate True Monarch Shangyuan had once manifested, which had filled the entire sky. This one was no larger than a thumb, a pure white bead like an alchemical pill. He held it in both hands as if cradling a Dao-fruit woven from infinite light, dazzling to behold.

As this divine ability emerged, Li Ximing blinked slowly, remaining silent.

But from a dark place, within the grey mists, the sharp, thin voice in the sky laughed.

"Wrong… all wrong… these are all inferior…"

"Where would he get Supreme Yin Moon Radiance to cultivate a superior grade!"

But as the divine abilities converged and the moonlight brightened, a towering sheet of talismanic light suddenly erupted, stretching across the sky like a profound curtain of heaven and earth. It descended, illuminating the eight directions with its magnificent, flashing light.

The Woven Jade Radiance Chapter!

This divine ability was endlessly mysterious, its dense and intricate runes concealed within the radiance, seeming to hold the very truths of the Great Dao. The sight made everyone turn to stare, mesmerized and horrified.

"What a divine ability! This must be the fundamental art of the Chunyi Dao Gate!"

Even the two sharp voices on the sides paused, their gazes fixed for a long moment.

"The Woven Jade Radiance Chapter… now this is a genuine ability!"

The two spoke without restraint, causing Li Ximing to narrow his eyes and watch intently, silent for a long time. A sudden sense of familiarity rose within him…

'It has some of the same profound feeling as the patterns of the High Firmament Pavilion…'

He stared blankly, listening to Daoist Master Tianhuo's praise from beside him.

"A genuine ability? This is far more. This is a Great Dao bestowed personally by the Azure Profoundity Daoist Tradition. Of the many immortal-grade fundamental arts of the ancient Immortal Dao, the Moon-Ascension art was the predecessor to The Woven Jade Radiance Chapter…"

"Back then, the Three Yin, Cold Qi, and Water Mansion paths all had figures who achieved the Dao with this fundamental art… It's no wonder he chose to cultivate this path!"

He was of noble birth, and out of respect for the True Monarch, few dared to make things difficult for him. The two figures from the Underworld turned their heads and praised him.

"The young lord has excellent insight!"

_DONG!_

As heaven and earth trembled, all the phantom colors had condensed into a single point.

An Unbearable Chill!

The entire sky was instantly enveloped in a multicolored haze. Vague shapes of laurel trees could be seen, seeming both as distant as the horizon and as close as one's own eyes. The white pill formed by Conferring the Profound Pearl truly resembled a pill of the Great Dao, appearing exceptionally bright against the backdrop of all the other colors. Sweet dew began to manifest in the sky, all of it converging toward that single point.

There was no fire or water, no void or reality, no purity or turbidity—only an endless process of condensation and elevation, a constant resonance with the Great Void as if answering a call.

Li Ximing's expression slowly changed, his gaze sweeping rapidly across the faces of the crowd.

The envoys from the Underworld, who had been so loudly critical, were now silent. Daoist Master Tianhuo, who had been all smiles, now had his head bowed, looking extremely constrained. Qing Zhuo, the cultivator from Mount Changhuai who stood apart from the crowd, had his eyes shut tight, not uttering a word.

These figures with celestial backgrounds were each more silent than the last, their silence bordering on tension.

In contrast, the many rogue cultivators without backing, along with invited clan cultivators like Chen Yin and Lingu Lanying, were whispering amongst themselves, mostly looking confused and frowning deeply.

'What… what's happening?'

Everything in the sky froze for an instant. A crisp sound seemed to ring out, and Li Ximing clearly felt Daoist Master Tianhuo beside him let out a sigh of immense relief.

It was followed by a deeply suppressed, agonizing sob—coming from Daoist Master Yuanshang himself.

The sounds from his mouth grew more trembling and faint, soon lost in the chattering of his teeth. Yuanshang began to laugh.

"Hahahahaha!"

The old man's laughter grew more and more frantic. He snatched the shimmering Dao-fruit pill, now condensed to its absolute limit, and shrieked with a laugh.

"I'll take it! I'll take it, then!"

_CLANG!_

Tier upon tier of ghostly pavilions had already materialized within the black clouds, yet they could not block the intense, cold light that shone forth. Even under the suppression of a Dharma Treasure, the old man continued to let out peal after peal of crazed laughter. His eyes traversed the sky, pierced the Great Void, and locked directly onto Li Ximing.

'He's become a demonic being!'

A jolt of horror shot through Li Ximing. He sealed the six senses of his two juniors and fled without hesitation.

"Master!"

Fuxuan's desolate cry echoed through the night sky, but before it could fade, the terrifying sounds of a battle already resounded over the entire island.

_BOOM!_

A waterfall of laurel blossoms rained down, blanketing a thousand miles of the sea, dying the entire surface a pure white. Countless cultivators were submerged in the floral downpour, staring up in a daze.

'A divine ability has fallen!'

# Chapter 1088: A Dream

The colors of the sky had bled into a muddy slurry. The white of the Supreme Yin and the frost of the Cold Qi were churned into layers of somber gray, like a shattered porcelain salt cellar, bright flecks and dull chips scattered in a chaotic mess.

The battle had already raged for two hours.

Perhaps the pill had been exceptionally effective, or perhaps Daoist Master Yuanshang's foundation was simply that deep. In any case, the demonic creature was incredibly powerful. It had repeatedly tried to tear free, smashing its head into Seajade Peak on Chunyi Island. It struck the mountain with such force that the peak split in two, triggering massive landslides and sending tsunamis crashing into the shores.

But in the end, it was subdued.

Heavy black shadows gathered in the sky, coalescing into a great, oppressive hall that pressed down upon a single point of white light. Within the light stood an old man, his hair unbound, a look of utter confusion on his face. Heavy, pitch-black chains were wrapped around his body, weighing his very form down.

The demonic creatures that Duanmu Kui and Si Boxiu had become, while capable of speech, were arrogant and wild. They felt no fear of death, no complex emotions. Even when an agent of the Underworld appeared, they had cackled and attacked, right up until the moment they were seized and dragged down to the Underworld.

This creature, however, merely stood silently within the great hall. It dragged its heavy chains, stumbling like a frail, sick old man, its head darting left and right. Its mind seemed trapped in a storm of overlapping phantoms.

"My lords?"

He suddenly lurched three steps to the left and looked up at the sky, but his vision met only crushing blackness. He stumbled back to the right, glancing around frantically, and cried out, "My lords! I am innocent!"

He seemed to have lost his sanity, growing rapidly agitated. He dragged the heavy chains back and forth, slamming into the walls of the hall, shaking the entire structure with deafening rumbles. His heart-rending roars filled the air.

"My lords!"

"Come out! Why won't you see me! Come out!"

"Five hundred years! It's been five hundred years... I'm no different! I'm just another Guanyu, aren't I? Why? Why do you humiliate me this way!"

His words... they were identical to Daoist Master Yuanshang's!

"My lords!"

His voice was so desolate, so terrifying, that it echoed through the hall and rattled the great doors. The prison couldn't seem to contain the light of the Supreme Yin radiating from him. His cries seeped through the cracks of the doors, thundering before the steps.

"I have achieved the Dao! Why won't you see me? I have achieved the Dao!"

But no matter how he roared and struggled, the heavy chains held him fast. With every inch they tightened, a sickening, teeth-grinding crunch echoed from his body.

The demonic creature collapsed to its knees, face tilted to the sky, as if to shout a name. But the name dissolved the instant it left his lips, dissipating into plumes of gray-white qi. He suddenly bowed his head and began to vomit violently.

_Retch._

He spat out a snow-white magpie. The bird had red feet, black eyes, and feathers like a sliver of the moon. It hopped twice, as if relishing its freedom, and vanished.

Next came white jade, bright as the moon. Then profound books covered in runes, followed by spirit lotuses of deep blue and white. One by one, fragments of bright white palace halls were expelled from his mouth. But within the impossibly vast, dark hall, these visions were no bigger than a fist. They rumbled as they fell, shattering into pools of white light on the floor.

When he finally vomited a vision of a swaying osmanthus village onto the ground, the eye-catching Mystic Pill at last came tumbling out, clattering onto the floor. The creature raised its head one last time.

"My lords! Chunyi is innocent!"

His wail was swallowed by the rolling black qi, fading into nothing.

_BOOM!_

As the Mystic Pill hit the ground, the great, heavy doors of the hall slammed shut. The hall vanished from the sky without a trace. The oppressive clouds retreated, the moonlight dimmed, and the stars grew faint. All the colors of the world seemed to scatter like smoke, as if the entire ordeal had been nothing but a dream.

The top half of the peak, shorn clean off, had already sunk into the sea, leaving only a jagged stump on the island. The earth veins and the fire vein, which should have erupted in a frenzy, were nowhere to be seen. The baleful qi within the mountain had frozen solid, transforming into a pure black, metallic stone.

Only then did the lone sword cultivator standing in the ruins become visible, his gaze fixed quietly on the night sky.

The bustling crowd of Daoist Masters, who had come from all corners of the land, had vanished like a flock of swallows returning to the sky. Not a trace remained. The mountain and the Great Void were utterly empty, save for the low, icy wind. Daoist Master Fuxuan, Xi Lingjiao, stood frozen in place like a statue.

Faint, hurried footsteps broke the silence. A young man walked forward, his face streaked with tears. He bowed low.

"The Great Daoist Master... has undergone Feather Transformation!"

_RUMBLE!_

It was as if his words had startled the very mechanisms of the world. A muffled thunderclap rolled across the sky, and fine snow began to fall. Xi Lingjiao turned his head to look at him.

"Che Hong... Master took a pill."

The young man just covered his face and wept.

"Martial Uncle! He did! It was one of Daoist Master Zhaojing's—a mystic elixir!"

Xi Lingjiao stumbled, taking an unsteady step. He squeezed his eyes shut as tears streamed from the corners.

"So, it's true."

_RUMBLE!_

The winter thunder grew louder, and the blizzard intensified. Goose-feather snow began to blanket every inch of the ruined courtyards and pavilions. Cultivators of the Chunyi Dao Gate emerged, walking silently over the snow. They exchanged no words, merely lowering their heads to begin clearing the rubble.

Xi Lingjiao stood motionless in the wind. Soon, he saw a beam of Heavenly Light approaching. The Daoist Master in the white-gold robe was the first to return. His expression was complicated as he cupped his hands from afar.

"Daoist friend, my condolences."

Xi Lingjiao regarded him quietly before speaking.

"Many thanks, Zhaojing. If not for this pill, Master's final wish to achieve the Dao... could not have been fulfilled."

Li Ximing looked as if he wanted to speak, but he held his tongue, his expression heavy. Others might have fled, catching only glimpses with their arts or hearing fragments from afar. But he, Li Ximing, possessed the Immortal Mirror. He had seen everything. The scene inside that spectral hall had made his blood run cold.

His expression deeply conflicted, he said,

"The Great Daoist Master's... Dao-Profundity was truly superb. Even when... afflicted by that Golden Malignance, he seemed exactly as he was in life..."

Xi Lingjiao's footsteps faltered. He turned his head, as if trying to discern whether Li Ximing was genuinely ignorant or mocking him. After a long moment, he said,

"That was the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic, the root method of our Dao. It is also the source of the Woven Jade Radiance Chapter's arts. By using this Dao to seek Gold, one can advance to become a True Immortal who has attained the Supreme Yin Dao. As a fallback... there is a one-in-ten-thousand chance of becoming a Supreme Yin Woven Jade Vassal."

He closed his eyes briefly.

"The Golden Malignance it became possessed his memories, but it was not him. If you must have a comparison, Zhaojing... it is in the same category as an emissary of the Underworld, only far higher in status."

Li Ximing was stunned.

'In that case... why would the Underworld capture him?'

Xi Lingjiao seemed to read his mind. His heart was filled with desolation, and his voice turned to ice.

"The Underworld is a supreme Immortal Department. The fact that they acted means Master failed even in his retreat. He truly failed, becoming a true demonic creature. That is why he was taken."

He spoke the words evenly, but the hand behind his back was clenched stiff. Beside him, Che Hong turned even paler, biting his lip in silence. A chill ran down Li Ximing's spine, and he found himself unable to reply. An oppressive silence fell, broken only by the soft shushing of the snow.

Xi Lingjiao shifted his stance. The sword cultivator seemed to wrestle with himself for several moments, his expression conflicted.

"Zhaojing, you are from the Ning Li... Have you heard any rumors? Do you have any idea... what my Master meant by 'retribution' as he died?"

How could Li Ximing possibly know? He was still struggling with his own thoughts. He shook his head firmly.

"The Great Daoist Master's intentions were profound. It is difficult for us to fathom..."

Fuxuan lowered his gaze.

"Che Hong told me of your request, Zhaojing. We agreed to an exchange, and we will not break our word. Che Hong!"

The young man immediately stepped forward and gestured for Li Ximing to follow, leaving Fuxuan standing alone in the snow, utterly silent.

Li Ximing bowed to him, his own heart feeling frozen. The Immortal Artifact in his possession was from the Immortal Mansion, a fact he dared not reveal. The Chunyi Dao Gate were staunch supporters of the Immortal Mansion, yet they had suffered such a grievance. A profound chill settled in Li Ximing's heart.

'It seems,' he thought, 'they truly believe Daoist Master Yuanshang died in the process of becoming some Supreme Yin Vassal...'

_Vmmm..._

The hum of a great formation activating snapped Li Ximing from his thoughts. He looked up to find he was already inside the Chunyi Dao Gate's inner sanctum. The ground was paved with white bricks, and groves of Moon Laurel trees grew everywhere. Before them stood a small, pure white pavilion.

Che Hong visibly composed himself, though his voice remained hoarse.

"Seajade Peak has collapsed, so we have few places to host an honored guest. Please, enter the pavilion and take a seat."

Li Ximing quickly bowed and nodded.

The pavilion was spartan, with few decorations, containing only a couple of jade tables. After the two Daoist Masters were seated, Che Hong asked,

"Daoist Master... is there a particular item you urgently require?"

Li Ximing pondered for a moment before asking, "Do you have any spirit items suitable for a Whole Pill?"

Li Ximing had received word from Liu Changdie some time ago. Liu Changdie had been making inquiries for him at the World's Navel and found a Whole Pill spirit item called Vermillion Temple Golden Sand.

Unfortunately, the owner, Cang Tiaozi, was driving a hard bargain. He refused to trade it for anything other than Liu Changdie's One-Qi White Globe Stone, so the deal had stalled. Li Ximing had even asked for a list of other items Cang Tiaozi might accept, but they were all things he had never even heard of. The chances seemed slim.

Hearing this, Che Hong raised an eyebrow and shook his head.

"Back then..."

As soon as Che Hong spoke those two words, Li Ximing knew what was coming. It had been traded to Daoist Master Qiushui. And sure enough, that was the case. The Golden Feather Sect's wealth and influence were terrifying, and Daoist Master Yuanshang had been on good terms with Qiushui. Of course he would agree to a trade.

However, Li Que'wan had given him good news when she arrived for the ceremony. Her cultivation speed with the secret art was horrifyingly fast. She had already completed the Rainbow Throne technique, and the final 'Plain Pill' stage wouldn't take much longer. Her seclusion was imminent!

That meant his most urgent task... was still acquiring the spirit item for Li Que'wan!

After a moment's thought, he retrieved Liu Changdie's letter from his sleeve. He copied the list of items Cang Tiaozi wanted and handed it to Che Hong.

"I require one of the items on this list, to trade with another Daoist Master..."

Che Hong took the list, and his brow furrowed slightly.

"This is for Senior Cang Tiaozi, is it not?"

Li Ximing was surprised, but then he considered that the number of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the world was, after all, finite. It was reasonable for them to know each other. He cupped his hands and nodded.

Che Hong clasped his hands.

"This will be simple. Senior Cang Tiaozi is a good friend of my Martial Uncle. Furthermore, the Great Daoist Master once saved his life. Leave it to me. If all goes well, I can complete the exchange for you within a few days."

Cang Tiaozi wasn't holding the Vermillion Temple Golden Sand for any particular purpose; he was just hoarding a rare commodity to trade for something he truly wanted. Li Ximing was overjoyed.

"Excellent!"

Che Hong was clearly still shrouded in the grief of his master's passing. He offered no smile and wasted no time on pleasantries. After a brief, clipped exchange, he hesitated and then said,

"Zhaojing, you are also an expert in the Dao of Alchemy, so I will be direct. The spirit items used for that Mystic Pill were of an extremely high grade, worth more than the Vermillion Temple Golden Sand. However, those items were not used for just one pill... Time was short, and I did not examine it closely, so I cannot be sure of its remaining medicinal strength. But I will not wrong you. We will consider it an exchange for our island's specialty, the 'Nightshade Spirit Grass.' I will have it delivered to the lake!"

Li Ximing naturally had no objection. He bowed, and taking care not to intrude further, he exited the inner formation and departed. As he flew up from Chunyi Island, he could still see Fuxuan below, standing silently, watching the heavy snow fall.

Xi Lingjiao stood motionless in the snow, clutching his sword. He took a small box from his sleeve and caught a handful of the thick, falling snow, his gaze lost in the distance. The snow piled up on the ruins of the broken mountain. After an eternity, the sword cultivator finally murmured,

"Master... you kept this from me... how bitter a secret..."

---

The world was dim, lost in a gloomy twilight.

A grotto-heaven of pale blue and white appeared, adorned everywhere with delicate, pale osmanthus blossoms. Jade tables and desks were arranged neatly. In the center lay a large, clear pool, its surface rippling with a rolling white radiance.

Inside the grotto-heaven, a middle-aged man knelt respectfully. He held up a jade box and said,

"Master ordered me to present the 'White-Hair Moon-Sprout Mystic Pill' and the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity, to repay the Great Daoist Master's kindness!"

His voice echoed. From the depths of the grotto, a man with his hands clasped behind his back turned around. His skin was fair, his features handsome, and on his brow rested a silver osmanthus mark. He wore a magnificent robe and carried an air of grace, the very picture of an immortal. He casually helped the kneeling man up, shaking his head.

"What is the meaning of this? I have told you before... I have no designs on the Supreme Yin."

The middle-aged man persisted.

"Senior, you saved us from dire straits... and you are also on the quest for Gold. Master recalled that our Dao possesses a Mystic Pill and a spirit item left by the Ancestor, which could be of great benefit to you! With the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity paired with the 'White-Hair Moon-Sprout Mystic Pill,' you can surely emulate the Dao lineage of our predecessor and achieve the Dao!"

_Vmmm..._

The entire scene rippled and dissolved, reforming as an image within a mirror held in a pair of pale hands. With a light brush of those hands, the memories scattered, reflecting the peerless scenery of the immortal pavilions surrounding them.

This was the world within the Immortal Mirror.

Lu Jiangxian stood up, his expression distant.

'The Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity... The Chunyi Dao Gate's ancestor, Jiequn, never used it.'

'And the three strands of Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair that Yuanshang mentioned... the one that was used was not consumed by Jiequn, but by... the Great Daoist Master from the Ning Li who aided the Chunyi Dao Gate all those years ago: Great Daoist Master Guanyu!'

This affair had to be traced back to Daoist Master Yuanshang's own master, Yanyi.

Yanyi had been a minor cultivator in the Chunyi Dao Gate with mediocre talent. But he had an unexpected fortuitous encounter. In a divine Immortal Palace realm, a deity appeared in his dreams and gifted him a casket. Inside were three items:

'The Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity, the Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair, and the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness.'

What exactly the deity said, Yuanshang never knew. Even this backstory was something he had pieced together from his master's fragmented dying words.

Yanyi took the three items and consumed the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness. From that day, he rose through the ranks, quickly becoming the leader of the failing Chunyi Dao Gate. He then integrated the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity into the sect's Dao lineage, claiming it was a lost art passed down by the Ancestor.

It was then that master and disciple met Great Daoist Master Guanyu of the Ning Li.

This Great Daoist Master had already cultivated four divine abilities and was preparing to cultivate Lesser Yin as his final one, to seek an Intercalary Position. But Yanyi's heart was stirred. He tempted Guanyu with the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity. In the end, he used one of the strands of Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair to refine a 'White-Hair Moon-Sprout Mystic Pill,' convincing Guanyu to change his path and seek the Supreme Yin instead.

In the end, Great Daoist Master Guanyu was utterly defeated and perished. Yanyi, for some unknown reason, found himself stuck at the Purple Mystery stage, unable to advance. He finally died in a battle while gambling for a new opportunity.

'In his youth, Yuanshang had assumed his master Yanyi wanted to seek the Supreme Yin himself and had simply used Guanyu to test the waters. But as he slowly uncovered the truth of the past, Yuanshang realized something was wrong.'

'The entire scheme had been set for Great Daoist Master Guanyu from the very beginning. His master Yanyi had mediocre talent; the "lords" above had never even considered him capable of achieving the Dao! Even the deity from the dream... had simply instructed him to pass off the opportunity as Jiequn's lost legacy and present it to Guanyu!'

Yuanshang's suspicion didn't come from any great insight gained by interacting with disciples of powerful factions. It came almost entirely from his master's dying words:

"The deity bestowed the Dao, but I cannot achieve it. The remaining merit now falls to you. If the day comes when you attain the Dao... you will be taught by the deity personally... You must attain the Dao! You _must_ attain the Dao!"

'If Yanyi had any "merit" to speak of... it could only have been his role in convincing Guanyu to pursue the Supreme Yin.'

This history remained a secret locked deep in Yuanshang's heart. His master had other disciples, and the lie about the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity was already deeply entrenched. In the end, he remained silent and upheld his master's deception. It was, after all, still a legitimate method for seeking the Dao.

But as the affair with Li Jiangqun sent ripples through Jiangnan, Yuanshang received some unexpected information. Doubt began to creep into his heart.

'Is the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity truly a path to achieve the Dao? Or... could it merely be a tool used by some great power to probe the Supreme Yin's Fruition Attainment?'

It was precisely because of this that when Chi Buzi delivered the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch, he was already deeply suspicious. All that remained was a final shred of uncertainty. He pretended to refuse the branch... and then Li Ximing arrived, offering a Supreme Yin Mystic Pill. This final act shattered his last doubts.

'It was all an arrangement! A deliberate plan just to probe the Supreme Yin! Alas... they had turned him into a weapon to be used against his own side!'

To make matters worse, Li Ximing was from the Ning Li, just as his master had offered the 'White-Hair Moon-Sprout Mystic Pill' to Guanyu... And... his own disciple, Fuxuan, was already in the mid-Purple Mansion Realm, just as he himself had been!

At that moment, Yuanshang, though ignorant of who was pulling the strings, saw the entire scheme clearly. Yet he dared not speak. How could the entire Chunyi Dao Gate suffer for his personal will? Did the one seeking the Supreme Yin _have_ to be from their sect? Fuxuan's temperament was outwardly gentle but inwardly unyielding; he was fierce. If a single word slipped, who knew what disaster it would unleash?

'In the end, all that awaits is suppression... "Personally taught by the deity"... it was all just an idle fantasy, a petty scheme!'

Lu Jiangxian's gaze was complex, his hands clasped behind his back, his heart heavy.

But was his own situation not also part of a calculation? Both of those "moon radiances" had come from his own hand.

'When Li Ximing obtained the Moon Orchid back then, it was indeed a spirit item that possessed a high "position" but lacked substance. I intended for it to complement the Pure Qi pill within him, adding a Supreme Yin grand pill to his foundation while minimizing my own exposure. But with that complement, his life-mandate became whole. By leveraging my own "position," the result was naturally comparable to a Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch!'

In other words, by consuming this pill, Yuanshang had already fulfilled the requirements of the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity. He had successfully queried the Supreme Yin!

And not only had he queried it, Lu Jiangxian himself had felt it!

'What Dingjiao told Chi Buzi was also a half-truth. It's not that the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch allows one to deduce the reality of the Supreme Yin after achieving the Dao.'

'This kind of query must be performed five times to calculate the location of the Donghua Heaven that is anchored to the Supreme Yin's position. Counting Guanyu and now Yuanshang... Fuxuan would only be the third!'

He had pondered this for a long time, and clarity was setting in.

Lu Jiangxian had also seen the full extent of Yuanshang's "achievement." With a flick of his wrist, a jade slip appeared in his hand. On it, colorful, runic characters shifted and changed:

Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic!

This was the root method of the Chunyi Dao Gate. The reason Lu Jiangxian knew all these details was precisely because of this text.

Lu Jiangxian had watched Yuanshang's breakthrough from the sidelines. The moment Yuanshang circulated the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic, Lu Jiangxian had felt a sudden connection. The path of "advancing" to become a Supreme Yin True Monarch was vague, but the path of "retreating" to become a Supreme Yin Woven Jade Vassal... it was pointing directly at him.

Had he been willing, he could have revealed his true form on the spot and inducted the man.

Lu Jiangxian had been profoundly shocked. Upon closer inspection, he had even detected the distinct 'flavor' of a sacrifice. The offering, in this case, was Yuanshang's own life-mandate.

The Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic was, in essence, a Moon-Ascension art. It was also a complete, ancient immortal cultivation method that Lu Jiangxian had obtained. By following this text, a cultivator could not only forge divine abilities but also use their very life-mandate to seek Gold.

However, the "gold" one sought was not to attain a formal position. Instead, it was to sense the Great Void and entrust one's Metallic Essence to the aspect of the Supreme Yin. In doing so, one would attain a 'side-door' Dao, much like an Adjudicator of the Underworld. This path had its own unique title: Woven Jade Immortal!

The idea of the Chunyi Dao Gate cultivators was to merge their own cultivation methods with the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic. While their path resembled the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, this classic gave them an option. At the final moment of sensing their life-mandate, they could take a gamble and switch paths to become a Woven Jade Immortal. Because of this, the Chunyi Dao Gate cultivators secretly referred to their path as the 'Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao,' though they never spoke of it publicly.

'The idea is actually brilliant. Perhaps the ancestor Jiequn studied the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic and left this path for his descendants. The modifications are quite elegant... it's just that the difficulty is astronomically high.'

It was because of this intimate connection between the two paths that Yuanshang, supported by the grand pill, was able to complete every step of the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic. His life's work was infused into his True Spirit. When he perished and his True Spirit emerged, it was instantly illuminated by the Name Ascending Stone and drawn into the Immortal Mirror.

'His life-mandate twisted into a demonic creature and was taken by the Underworld, but his True Spirit... it arrived here!'

And that was why the entire truth behind the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity, the complete, unabridged text of the _Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic_, and even the full history of the Chunyi Dao Gate and Great Daoist Master Guanyu... all of it had fallen into Lu Jiangxian's hands.

Lu Jiangxian slowly raised his hand. In his palm rested a tiny speck of brilliant light.

"The True Spirit and the life's work of a Great Daoist Master of the Supreme Yin, one who had completed all five methods and attained Metallic Essence... At last, I no longer have to rely on Dangjiang to put on a front. And certain... hypotheses... now have a foundation!"




# Chapter 1089: Five Virtues and Five Manifestations

The undulating ranges of Mount Dayang were draped in azure and gold. Azure was the lush, vibrant forest, a tapestry of myriad forms. Gold was the brilliant, boundless splendor of the grand halls, their light shining like suns. Colossal statues stood sentinel between the peaks, completing the magnificent vista.

"The Zhao State... its court is in chaos, its mechanisms of control, both internal and external, have failed. The ruler is no ruler, the ministers no ministers. The territory is shattered. They cannot pacify the Yan-Liao region, nor can they stabilize Monan or reclaim the Long-Liang region. The various kings rule their own lands. Even Jiangbei, so recently reclaimed... is nothing but a bargaining chip for the Immortals and Buddhists."

"Consider the northern dynasties of generations past. The Zhou pioneered with kings, established the Hua states, and revitalized the Xia descendants. The Wei established an imperial line, pacified the east and west, and founded an celestial dynasty. The Liang expanded the borders, absorbing Mobei and Monan, their armies reaching the Northern Sea. It is truly difficult to say which was superior. But if one had to choose the most useless... today's Zhao State is undoubtedly the first."

"Yet here, in the heartland of Zhao, the ancient capital, there exists a paradise. That paradise is my Great Adoration Dharma Realm!"

The black-robed monk in the grand hall pressed his palms together, his expression serene. He plucked a flower and took his seat. Below, the assembled monks whispered amongst themselves in admiration. The monk merely kept his palms pressed, raising an eyebrow with a faint smile.

"That which the Immortals cannot govern, cannot manage, and cannot remedy... that is where we Buddhists shall be!"

The Buddhist cultivators all assumed expressions of deep, pained contemplation. One, however, rose from his seat and stepped forward. He had a kind and merciful face and was draped in a verdant green meditation robe. His expression was solemn as he asked:

"This junior cultivator has a doubt, one that has been buried in my heart for many years. Day after day, I cannot resolve it... I dare not resolve it. Seeing you, Great Virtue, come to preach the Dao today, my heart is filled with admiration. I must be so bold as to ask!"

The black-robed monk above nodded. The green-robed monk continued:

"I venture to ask the Great Virtue! Today, there are heretics who slander us, striking at the very root of the Buddhist Dao. They claim our foundation lies in 'gathering,' 'essence,' and 'position.' They call 'gathering' a 'collection,' 'essence' a 'splendor,' and 'position' a 'body.' By this logic, they claim that Buddhism is, in truth, just another form of Immortal cultivation! How... how should this be answered?"

The moment he spoke, the mountain forests trembled. Tigers and leopards roared. The sound of shattering fire-prisons and striking staves echoed from all around. The cultivators erupted in chaos, terrified by his blasphemous words. Yet the monk in the high seat merely clapped his hands and sighed.

"To stare at the position and invent a meaning... it is absurd to the extreme. What Immortal cultivators 'gain,' we 'lose.' The two are mutual expressions, an inside and an outside. Only an ignorant fool would try to conflate Immortals and Buddhists."

He rose to his feet, speaking with perfect ease.

"In ages past, during the great Dao debate at the Kongtong Sea, the Immortals spoke of Five Virtues and Five Manifestations. The Five Virtues are the horizontal, the Five Manifestations are the vertical. When horizontal and vertical interweave, they become the warp and weft of Heaven and Earth. That is the Great Dao."

His words were empowered by potent techniques, ensuring all could hear. They struck the courtyard like thunder and fire, seeming to stir the very fabric of the world. A relentless torrent of hail began to hammer the hall from outside, drawing the stunned Buddhist cultivators to watch.

"Heavenly Awakening further stated, The Five Virtues are solid; the Five Manifestations are empty. The height of the Virtues cannot surpass the Manifestations. One must follow, obey, and accept them. Thus, the Five Manifestations are the root of the Virtues, and the Virtues are the expression of the Manifestations. The pinnacle of the Virtues is 'solidity' and 'existence.' The pinnacle of the Manifestations is 'void' and 'emptiness.' Our cultivation lies in the Five Manifestations."

"This is the inner and outer!"

As he finished, the sound of thudding jade pearls filled the air. A white deer galloped past. Snow began to fall in the four corners of the realm, and beneath the snow, golden jade and precious pearls emerged, a scene of infinite prosperity. The monk spoke again,

"Thus, all perceptions and all forms are ultimately empty. It is only that the common man cultivating Buddhism cannot use emptiness to achieve Empty Attestation. So, the heterodox paths teach them to rely on 'offerings'—using form to make offerings to feeling, perception, impulse, and consciousness. This is using one emptiness to sustain four, one nothingness to sustain four, all in the seeking that all things are empty. All save a single point of truth, attested in the Chandana Forest... and this Chandana Forest is, itself, also empty!"

This declaration was like iron boulders, smashing into the stone floor and gouging deep dents, scattering everywhere. His direct claim that the Chandana Forest was empty caused blood to trickle from the ears and noses of the monks. The green-robed monk was thrown back nine steps before collapsing headfirst to the ground!

"Boom!"

Thick, dark clouds instantly materialized above the golden hall. A beam of auspicious light searched frantically, but it was blocked by the hall and could not descend. Disappointed, it quickly turned and scattered like the wind.

The green-robed Buddhist cultivator silently climbed to his feet, his heart pounding with terror.

'What... what manner of being is this!'

It was a long while before the scattered monks managed to stumble upright, each still feeling as if they bore the weight of iron, unable to move. Then, a long sigh cut through the silence.

"Martial Grand-Uncle Kongshu... is truly... his wisdom encompasses heaven and man! And he is so generous, so selfless!"

The one who sighed was none other than the Great Adoration Dharma Realm's own Maha Fachang.

This man had once been in Jiangbei, where he had single-handedly maintained a fragile peace for many years. Later, as the conflict between north and south intensified, he was driven back to the Dharma Realm. Cultivating here, his status was clearly profound.

Yet even for someone of his lofty origins, hearing such a discourse on the Dao filled him with a solemn awe. His mind felt infinitely liberated, yet simultaneously shrouded, as if by a single leaf, leaving him speechless.

He stepped down from his platform. The worries that had been piled high on his brow were forgotten, his mind consumed by contemplation. He looked up to see the black-robed monk raise an eyebrow, smiling.

"Fachang, what is this?"

The simple question shattered his mental barrier, pulling him back to the present. His anxieties rushed back in. Maha Fachang lowered his gaze.

"Reporting to Martial Grand-Uncle... it is news from the Way of Great Desire. That Maha Liangli Tian Langzhi... he wishes to recall Yaosa Chengmi!"

The black-robed monk pressed his palms together, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"That is only as it should be... is it not?"

Fachang remained silent.

The matter was not complicated. Years ago, Jiang Toushou had been ordered south to the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain to join forces with Maha Liangli Tian Langzhi of the Great Desire. The two had supposedly reached a consensus: the Way of Great Desire would release Yaosa Chengmi to participate in the affair concerning Wrath.

But this was hardly a favorable outcome for the Way of Great Desire. Mount Dayang was deeply invested in reviving Wrath and had orchestrated the entire affair. The figure they propped up was one of their own. If Yaosa Chengmi attained the Dao, he would undoubtedly seek to escape their control and align himself with Mount Dayang. How could he possibly remain subservient to the Great Desire?

Tian Langzhi had feigned agreement, only to ambush Jiang Toushou at the critical moment. The betrayal cost Jiang Toushou the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain and caused Mount Dayang's prestige to plummet...

Burning with rage, how could Jiang Toushou and the others possibly allow Yaosa Chengmi to return now?

'It's bound to be another internal struggle... The Way of Great Desire is growing stronger by the day. That great personage is facing increasing pressure from that peacock... He's already been forced to cede so much of the Way of Great Desire's power...'

A sorrowful look crossed Fachang's face. The black-robed monk did not press the issue.

"You returned quickly, Fachang. Did you witness the breakthrough of that cultivator from the ancient Woven Jade Dao?"

Fachang moved respectfully to his side, palms pressed.

"Reporting to Martial Grand-Uncle, I did."

"And how was it?"

Kongshu's question drew a sigh of deep emotion from Fachang.

"Formidable. Utterly formidable... Even the [Exiled Immortal's Resentful Abode] took some time to supress him. In my opinion, if he were given just a little more time to recover, he might not have lost to Guanyu or Li Yuanwei..."

Kongshu merely shook his head.

"I have never personally witnessed the events of ancient times, but from your words, this current affair is causing just as great a stir."

"Naturally!" Fachang's expression was complex. "After I watched his breakthrough, I journeyed straight back to the Dharma Realm. I spent three years discussing the Dao with Great Tushou before departing to return here. I only just received new information. It is said that just before his death, he consumed a pill... a very powerful pill."

"For some reason, the Exiled Immortal's Resentful Abode did not sever his connection to the world. It seemed to be using him for some purpose. As a result, every word he spoke was leaked—he directly proclaimed that the Chunyi Dao Gate was innocent... Who knows what that is about?"

Kongshu's gaze flickered, as if he understood something.

'The path of Immortal cultivation... the Supreme is without emotion. Master once mentioned... he said the Chunyi Dao Gate was merely a tool for probing. It was likely for the sake of the Supreme Yin. That pill... its delivery was ingenious. If he refused to take it, one of his descendants would. And it might not even be a descendant of the Chunyi Dao Gate.'

Seeing him lower his gaze in silence, Fachang waved his sleeve, dismissing the many disciples from the hall.

"Was there something unusual?"

The black-robed monk narrowed his eyes slightly. He was remarkably handsome, but not with the delicate, statue-like beauty common among Buddhist cultivators. His was a heavy, profound elegance, like that of a worldly and romantic elder. The narrowing of his eyes only made him seem more imposing.

"I discussed the Dharma with Master for thirty years. We once spoke of the Woven Jade Dao."

The 'Master' he spoke of was no ordinary figure! It was the current Realm Lord of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, a being at the Dharma Master level! Hearing this, Fachang stood bolt upright in shock and bowed.

"This junior cultivator respectfully listens to your teachings!"

Kongshu's lips were crimson, his teeth like pearls, and his eyes bright. "It is the True Method of the Wall-Below Woven Jade! Tracing its roots, it can be tracked to a great cultivator of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition—True Monarch Yuanxia."

"When the Three Profound Great Daos first appeared in the world, various Immortal Lords accepted disciples. Three of those disciples attested their Daos in the Three Yins. The first was True Monarch Yuanxia of Encompassing Profoundity. The second was True Monarch Guanhu of Comprehending Profoundity. The third, also of Comprehending Profoundity, was True Monarch Shoulou."

His voice was deep.

"True Monarch Shoulou attested in the auxillary of Veiled Yin. True Monarch Guanhu attested in the auxillary of Lesser Yin. The former's disciple, Loutai Min, and the latter's disciple, Xu Che, became the ancestors of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao. That is the origin of Lord Wei's Dharma lineage!"

"This Lord Xu Che... his innate talent is unmatched today, but back then, it was considered the lowest of the low. True Monarch Guanhu cherished him and sought an alternative Dharma Art. Finally, from the hands of True Monarch Yuanxia... he obtained this very True Method of the Wall-Below Woven Jade! He had him switch to cultivating as a Lesser Yin Woven Jade Immortal. This has been passed down as a celebrated tale ever since."

"The lineage held by the Chunyi Dao Gate, which resembles the True Method of the Wall-Below Woven Jade, was passed down from the Green Pine Temple. It must have been obtained from Lord Yingze."

Fachang's brows shot up. He was exceptionally bright. Hearing the mention of Wei Xuanyin and the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, he instantly understood. He lowered his gaze, his expression serious.

"So, this method is common to all three Yin Daoist Traditions. As expected of a method passed down from a True Monarch of the Three Profound Dao. Truly extraordinary!"

He offered this praise before voicing his doubt.

"Martial Grand-Uncle... are you saying that Wei Xuanyin... also possesses the True Method of the Wall-Below Woven Jade!"

Kongshu's expression grew taut.

"He must..."

Fachang pressed his palms together and sighed.

"But he cultivated Veiled Yin. I heard he intends to hurl himself against it... There is no one above to guide him. How can he..."

Before he could finish, the sky filled with golden qi. Gray fire descended like rain, forming into the shapes of birds and sparrows, all converging on the mountaintop. The phenomenon forcibly cut off his words, causing both monks to raise their heads in unison.

They watched as a rain of fiery ashes, all shaped like birds, filled the sky—a magnificent, imposing sight!

A figure walked out from within the swirling gray fire. He was tall, with exceptionally narrow eyes and pale red pupils. A sash of green silk was tied at his waist. In the center of his brow, a golden lotus mark glowed brightly. The mere act of him standing there caused the illusory, colorful light of the entire mountain range to tremble and freeze.

Fachang was horrified.

"Sparrow Carp Fish!"

This was, astonishingly, Sparrow Carp Fish, who had claimed the guest position of True Qi!

"He emerged from seclusion so soon!"

Back then, Sparrow Carp Fish had gone south. Relying on years of meticulous scheming, he had successfully entered the guest position of True Qi, becoming the vessel for the reincarnation of True Qi known as 'curbing indulgence with righteous nature.' Not only had he achieved his seventh reincarnation, but his already considerable fate had soared to terrifying new heights.

Buddhist cultivators had flooded south like a river of carp, too numerous to count, all hoping to claim a piece of the great tide and elevate themselves to a supreme position. Most, however, had been crushed and broken. To this day, the only one to have gained anything—and the one who had gained the most... was him.

Now, his bearing was that of a supreme cultivator. His face was white as jade, the lotus mark on his brow a clear sign of an extremely high-level Dharma body. The sound of Dharma conchs echoed around him, as if he could command all present to bow in worship at any moment. His arrival caused all the surrounding peaks to turn their gazes and break into hushed whispers.

How could Fachang fail to see what this meant?

'I fear even the Undefeated King of Brightness of old... was no more than this! As long as the Way of Great Desire's Buddhist Land has a seat for him, it is almost certain he will become a new Dharma Master!'

'In the current Buddhist Land, who below the rank of Dharma Master dares to challenge him?'

Even with Fachang's exceptional composure, he couldn't hide his shock. All of Mount Dayang erupted, the air filled with the sound of bowing.

"Greetings, Lord!"

Sparrow Carp Fish's gaze swept impassively over Mount Dayang, his expression flat. Only when his eyes met Kongshu's did he nod slightly in acknowledgment.

He descended from the sky step by step, landing in the main hall. With a casual wave of his hand, he plucked a figure from the mountain below. It was, surprisingly, the green-robed disciple who had asked the question earlier, his features now appearing fresh and refined. It was Yaosa Chengmi.

As he acted, all the Buddhists on Mount Dayang lowered their heads. Not one dared to speak.

The youth with the golden lotus on his brow stood with his hands clasped behind him, his aura lofty and aloof. His gaze was cold as he spoke.

"My Way of Great Desire has issued summons for its disciple time and time again. I wonder... who has been obstructing this?"

He glanced around. He saw that Kongshu, the only one who might have intervened, was staring at him with a strange intensity, but remained silent. Sparrow Carp Fish sneered, understanding perfectly.

'That Lord has advanced another step. This group of Mount Dayang masters would never dare cause trouble over a minor Merciful One... And this Kongshu is a Dao-maniac. Why would he ever involve himself in such matters?'

With a flick of his sleeve, he stepped into the Great Void. Behind him, Yaosa Chengmi appeared perfectly respectful, bowing.

"Lord, you have liberated me from the sea of suffering!"

Sparrow Carp Fish looked back, his expression playful.

"Liberated? Not necessarily. I'm taking you back this time to be delivered into our Lord's stomach!"

Yaosa Chengmi was a figure who had emerged from the affair of Luoxia herding the Bright Yang. His fate was extraordinary, and many had coveted him for a long time. Yet, hearing these words, his expression did not change. He smiled.

"This junior cultivator respectfully accepts!"

Sparrow Carp Fish smiled, his eyes narrowed. He raised a hand, as if performing a divination. Only when golden lotuses began to bloom brilliantly beneath his feet did he continue,

"My Lord has a joyous occasion today. It has been calculated that he shall become pregnant with three sons. I must trouble you to take a trip into our Lord's stomach. You will wait there for six years, and then you shall be born from the Merging Fire!"

...

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Colors swirled through coiling clouds and mist. The courtyard was bathed in clean, bright light, a jade well gleaming in its center. A jade box sat before the door, holding three or five letters, new and old, jumbled together. They looked as if they had not been touched in a very long time.

The spiritual energy of the realm flowed freely. A violently fluctuating aura poured from the doorway, only to be swiftly pacified by the balanced yin-and-yang presence of the world. The blood-red light that streamed through the door dissolved into patches of sunset-colored radiance, neutralized and dispersed.

The door itself trembled faintly. From within, one could hear the indistinct sounds of battle cries and marching armies, echoing and overlapping.

"Creak."

As the courtyard door was gently pushed open, all sound and light ceased. The moon-lamp flickered. The stone bricks were immaculate. On the couch, a green-black gauze curtain swayed in the breeze. It was a tranquil, cool night in the small courtyard.

The hand on the door gave a firm push, and the man stepped out. His golden pupils reflected a hellscape of broken blades and shattered halberds, mountains of corpses and seas of baleful energy. An endless Celestial Yang set upon a blood-red desert, and in the heart of that blood, a single point of radiance.

"Crimson Severing Arrowhead!"

He exhaled slowly, the vision in his eyes retracting.

"...Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm... achieved today!"

——

Li Zhouwei [Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm]




# Chapter 1090: The Yin-Sanctum of the Great Fissure

The young man took a single step within the balanced energies of his pocket-realm. He turned, his gaze falling upon a box resting on the threshold of his courtyard. From it, he retrieved a letter and began to read it carefully.

As he finished, his expression tightened slightly, betraying a flicker of surprise. He flattened one hand, folded the letter with the other, and tapped it gently against his palm.

"Vast Cicada... the Precious Tusk Golden Land... the heritage of the Undefeated King of Brightness..."

Back then, he had been merely at the Embyronic Breathing stage, his power just beginning to manifest, when Kongheng had seen him. The first thing that monk had called him was the Undefeated King of Brightness. A monk like Kongheng, who held the great Dao in his heart, rarely spoke with such certainty.

This fact made the young man raise an eyebrow, his golden eyes flashing.

'Destiny? Or a plot? The Undefeated King of Brightness was backed by the Great Liang... and also the Touba family... Yet they've barely lifted a finger in the struggle between north and south...'

He set the letter aside, picked up the several that had arrived before it, and read them one by one before placing them in his storage bag. Finally, he retrieved a jade bottle.

'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill. Three of them.'

Li Ximing had urgently requested these pills from Sima Yuanli, but he had underestimated Li Zhouwei's cultivation speed. By the time they were delivered, Li Zhouwei had already begun the process of elevating his divine ability.

In Li Zhouwei's estimation, the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' wasn't exceptionally difficult. The Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light suited him as if it were tailor-made—especially now that his Dao-Profundity had advanced. While this divine ability had its challenges and couldn't compare to the 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread', which had perfectly matched his breakthrough into the Perilous Tread realm, its completion was still a natural progression.

'And these Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pills... every one used is one gone forever. Granduncle will certainly need one for his next divine ability, and I will require one to break through to Purple Mystery. The last one will find its purpose soon enough.'

Having refined this divine ability, much of the overly tyrannical and fierce baleful qi that clung to his features dispersed, transforming into a majesty as calm and deep as a lake. He pinched his fingers to make a quick calculation, his bearing possessing an even greater grace.

'It took me six or seven years to elevate this divine ability... Jiangqian should be in seclusion by now. As for Que'Wan... the 'Whole Pill' secret method is difficult. She should still need more time.'

His gaze hardened slightly. He followed the jade steps up to the pavilion and, within the cloud-wreathed structure, found a specific cabinet and gently opened it.

Inside lay a small box, half-filled with a swirling, azure-white qi contained in five small bottles.

This was something Li Ximing had found when he first ascended to this pocket-realm. It was Spiritual Qi left behind by the original owner—very likely a remnant of Li Jiangqun from all those years ago!

After he emerged from seclusion this time, he absolutely had to pay a visit to the fox-kin!

'Granduncle took one bottle out back then, but after long deliberation, he couldn't find a single person he dared to ask about it. He ended up hurriedly sending it back. Now, after what happened with the Chunyi Dao Gate, he's even more afraid to speak... If I'm to get answers, the fox-kin are my only option.'

He took one of the bottles, strode forward, and stepped out of the pocket-realm. His figure materialized in the vast, faintly glowing great hall. He scanned his surroundings, finding that nothing had changed. Everything was as it had been.

He was in no hurry to leave the hall, however.

'I am already at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm. With my various Spiritual Treasures, cultivation methods, spell arts, and even the White Qilin fate... those enemies I once struggled to face are now nothing special. Even Helian Wujiang and Shilou Yingge combined are no longer necessarily my match!'

'The only ones who can truly suppress me now are figures like Wei Xuanyin or Sparrow Carp Fish...'

His reappearance would be enough to cause a massive shift in the current situation. Every day he remained hidden was another day of initiative gained. He could not afford to be exposed, and he was unwilling to let anyone on the lake even know he was out!

He simply took a jade pendant from his sleeve, sensed it for a moment, and then activated it.

Almost in the same instant, a streak of golden light shot through the air and materialized in the hall, revealing a figure whose white-gold Daoist robes shimmered. Who else could it be but Li Ximing?

Li Ximing had been refining pills in the mountains. The moment the jade pendant hidden in his sleeve, which he constantly monitored, lit up, his heart filled with a boundless, apprehensive joy. He pretended he needed to retrieve some medicinal supplies, took a single step into the inner formation, and saw the golden-eyed, white-robed young man standing in the dim hall. A wide smile split his face.

"Minghuang... you've succeeded?"

Li Zhouwei smiled. His eyes swept over Li Ximing, and he seemed to notice something. He took the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill from his storage bag and said with a grin:

"We saved a pill!"

"Excellent! Mid-Purple Mansion Realm!"

Li Ximing exclaimed in praise, then took a neatly folded, ink-black robe from his sleeve.

"The Primal Summit recovered on its own some time ago. I've been keeping it safe for you!"

The moment the armor saw Li Zhouwei, it leaped up like a young swallow returning to its nest. With a soft _shing_, it draped over his body, transforming into a robe. Its base color was as dark as ink, emblazoned with the golden, fang-baring visage of a qilin. The edges of the sleeves were trimmed in gold, granting him an air of supreme nobility.

Li Ximing voiced another word of praise, but he could no longer hold back his anticipation.

"Well?" he asked urgently. "How is it?"

Li Zhouwei, of course, knew what he was asking. He laughed, raised his sleeve, and gave it a light sweep.

In that instant, the world transformed. A thick, gritty wind slammed into their faces. The dim lamp stands, the flickering candles, and even the distant, gleaming profound tower—all of it faded, plunging them into utter darkness.

In a disorienting flash, they found themselves in a crimson desert scourged by rolling whirlwinds. The land was desolate and vast, filled with the hissing of sand. Countless broken weapons and sundered armor lay half-buried, exuding a thick, boundless, and gloomy baleful qi. It was a scene of complete devastation.

Li Ximing spun around. The great hall's doors were gone. Behind him stretched the same endless desert. In the pitch-black sky hung a lone, golden-yellow orb—a dying sun that loomed like a colossal beast.

Li Ximing sucked in a sharp, cold breath, his brow furrowed in profound shock. He turned back.

"This is the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'!"

"Correct! The Great Fissure Broken-Blade Marvelous Art divine ability—'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'!"

Li Zhouwei smiled. Between his brows, the stark sign of a solar eclipse appeared, utterly black and devoid of light. He replied:

"Using the Emperor Qi's Light here provides twice the result for half the effort. All Yang Cusp 'inverse position' arts are not only enhanced, but their dharma power consumption is also drastically reduced!"

"Even better, this divine ability flickers in and out of existence, making it incredibly difficult to block with Spiritual Artifacts or Spiritual Treasures. When used against an enemy, it excels at catching them completely off guard!"

His tone carried the undercurrent of meticulous calculation, revealing that he had already formed numerous plans.

"The dying sun here, the broken armor, the blood-soaked desert, and even the Sun-Surging stars in the sky—all of it is mine to command. Not only that, but I can pair them with all kinds of profound, ancient spell arts to create even more wondrous effects!"

Li Ximing pondered this for a moment and murmured:

"It's... a sanctum for nurturing balefulness!"

"It's more than that!"

Li Zhouwei stood bathed in the light of the dying sun, looking down at the endless, cold baleful qi clinging to the desert floor. He raised his brows.

"The Imperial Codex states: 'An Emperor who slaughters his people destroys his own walls. An Emperor who herds dissenters raises his own executioners.'"

He continued:

"This desert holds an even greater marvel. Unless an opponent can shatter this divine ability in a single blow, any harm they sustain here—be it to person or possession—will be 'recorded.' While it has no immediate effect, when they leave this desert, that portion of harm can be left behind, severed from them."

"Conversely, any healing or recovery they attempt here will be 'stolen.' When they depart, that stolen portion of vitality can be obliterated within the desert."

Li Ximing's brows shot up, then knitted together.

"This is..." he said, stunned. "Could this be like the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal... to think such a divine ability exists! It's so domineering. Who could possibly resist it?"

"Not quite."

Li Zhouwei shook his head with a smile.

"This isn't a Dao of imprisonment; it can't truly trap anyone. Its strength lies in its wondrous, flickering nature. In combat, it drags an opponent down, as if hurling the setting sun at them. It's an art, not a domain. It relies on constant, unpredictable change, appearing different to every observer... Its true profundity is difficult to put into words."

"Granduncle, you hadn't entered Wanling Grotto-Heaven, but Zong Chang once possessed a Yin-Exhaustion art that was somewhat similar..."

"As for comparing divine abilities... within a Dao Lineage, each of the five Daos has its own function. It's pointless to compare them one-to-one. If you insist... the 'Valley Water' Dao has the 'Spring of Rebirth', also known as the Undying Spring. As a standalone divine ability, what can possibly compare to that? And that's not even considering the cycles of generation and restriction."

Li Zhouwei's expression grew more complex as he continued:

"A Dao Lineage always has its marvels. If it seems weak, it's the person who is weak. If it's strong, it's the person who is strong. Even a lineage as pathetic as the Capital Guard still managed to produce someone like Yehui."

Li Ximing crouched down, scooping up a handful of the fine sand. The surface layer was comfortably warm, but just beneath, it was heavy and dark, thoroughly soaked with blood, like silt. He sighed.

"It's truly real..."

He stared at it, his spiritual sense already flaring out, connecting with his Immortal Artifact.

In his Spirit Probe vision, everything before him, though manifested by a divine ability, was not an illusion. It was only far in the-distance, beyond the bounds of the "hall," that the scenery became unreal, dissolving into the expanding edge of the ability. He could vaguely sense that it was possible to pass through that edge and land back in the formation.

This realization made Li Ximing think of something.

"The Precious Tusk Temple?!"

His intuition screamed at him: one of the foundations of Vast Cicada's bizarre and inescapable Precious Tusk Temple was very likely this 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'!

The suggestion, however, did not seem to surprise Li Zhouwei. He simply offered his own deduction.

"Granduncle's guess is sound. The two likely share a common origin. The difference is that the Precious Tusk Temple lost the ability to appear and disappear at will, while the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' lacks the Temple's function of drawing people in deeper... It's highly probable that Vast Cicada used some profound art to link it to the Precious Tusk Golden Land, using the Great Fissure Broken-Blade Marvelous Art divine ability as nothing more than a springboard!"

Li Ximing nodded with a sigh, finally understanding.

"I felt a sense of crisis that day. It must have been in response to this."

He let the blood-soaked sand fall from his grasp, dusted off his hands, and turned his gaze back to the domain, his brow furrowed.

"What I truly don't understand... is why this divine ability... feels as gloomy as a demonic art!"

Li Ximing was, after all, a Bright Yang cultivator. He was a Daoist Master who had achieved his own divine ability; in the current age, he was a great cultivator. He knew exactly what the aura of a Bright Yang divine ability should feel like.

He remained baffled.

"It feels nothing like Bright Yang!"

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"I knew you would ask this."

He lifted his head. His ink-black robe stirred, though there was no wind. The golden light around him intensified as the massive sun within the domain began to set. The western sky fell as the eastern rose, and finally, points of starlight emerged on the far-eastern horizon.

Li Zhouwei's dark hair whipped about in the gale. He raised a hand.

"Granduncle, look!"

Li Ximing fixed his gaze on the eastern horizon. Four stars twinkled there, arranged in an open-boxed '匚' shape, slanted northward, narrower at the opening and wider at the base. The pattern was incredibly familiar, and Li Ximing watched it with a thoughtful expression.

Li Zhouwei said,

"Those are the Sun-Surging Governing Stars!"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing instantly.

"The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!"

That artifact belonged to the Great Xiukui Monastery. It had been lent to him twice before, symbolizing Ning State's adherence to the Wei orthodox calendar... When he used the compass's power, those exact four stars would appear on its surface!

Li Zhouwei spoke again, his tone solemn.

"You have undoubtedly heard of High Radiance and Yang Cusp... but do you know their origin? High Radiance is the first of these four stars. Yang Cusp is the last. This is the principle behind the 'forward grasp' and 'reverse grasp'!"

"These four stars, in their rotation and transformation, each represent one of the five Bright Yang divine abilities!"

Li Ximing fell silent for a moment. "...That's one short," he said.

"Exactly!"

Li Zhouwei's eyes shone with brilliance.

"I once cultivated the Supreme Radiance Profound Dharma Body divine ability, which is now my 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread'. From that art, I learned a phrase: 'Through the descent of six-nines, one reaches the realm of regret. Only then comes the heart that shatters the arrowhead, the will that clarifies all.' And another: 'A Treasured Artifact with a fissure (wèn) attains completeness.'"

"I didn't understand the principle back then. But now that my Dao-Profundity has advanced and I have mastered the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' from the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light, I finally grasp the mystery! The one divine ability not counted among those stars... is the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'!"

He explained:

"The five Bright Yang methods undergo the 'descent of six-nines.' This refers to the transformation of peak yang into yin, and extreme yin back into yang. First, it forces the Emperor to tread peril. When his task is complete, a single regret remains. That regret _is_ the 'heart that shatters the arrowhead'!"

"Thus, 'a Treasured Artifact with a fissure attains completeness.' A 'wèn'—a fissure—is when an object is broken but not yet separated. The 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' is precisely that fissure in the 'artifact' of Bright Yang. It is the yin-sanctum within Bright Yang itself!"

"Only with this yin-sanctum can an Emperor turn peak yang back to yin and find a path to rebirth. Only with this yin-sanctum can a Crown Prince defy imperial power and walk the path of the Yang Cusp. And only with this yin-sanctum can Bright Yang itself take a step back, preserving itself in the face of the true First Manifestation—the Supreme Yang. That is the meaning of 'Severing' (duàn) in its name!"

"In all the heavens, the only power that dares to encompass all five Daos, that _can_ encompass all five, is the Supreme Yang! The Dao of Bright Yang is defined by four brightnesses that form the stars, and this one, single yin!"

His eyes were as bright as gold, shining like a fifth star in the firmament. He spoke softly:

"This is one of the great secrets of the Bright Yang Dao. I doubt more than a handful of people even in ancient times ever knew it. It was only when I achieved this divine ability, when the Dao-Profundity my Talisman Qi had accumulated over many years fed back into me and I communed with the White Qilin fate, that I was able to sense it."

"And precisely because 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' is the yin-sanctum of the Bright Yang Dao, it isn't limited to Bright Yang cultivators. It can also be cultivated by those of the Lesser Yang, Baleful Qi, and even Hengzhu Daos as a supplement!"

Li Ximing was so profoundly shaken by this revelation that he was unable to speak for a long time. The gales within the domain intensified, roused by Li Zhouwei's words. Just as a new phenomenon was about to manifest, all color and sound suddenly retracted, and the entire scene scattered and vanished like a fleeting dream.

The crouching-beast sun, the endless blood-red desert—all of it dissipated. The dim, somber great hall reappeared around them. Li Ximing stood motionlessly in the hall, lost in thought for a long time.

Li Zhouwei watched him quietly.

He could, of course, see that Li Ximing had barely made any progress on his 'World's Radiance'. That Life Divine Ability was notoriously difficult to begin with, and Li Ximing seemed to have hit a wall, his progress stalling. The ratio of effort to reward had become terribly skewed. For the sake of the clan, his time was far more profitably spent refining pills.

But while Li Ximing thought of the clan, Li Zhouwei was thinking of him.

'If Granduncle can master 'World's Radiance' and wants to protect himself in these chaotic times, his next divine ability will surely be 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread'... He could rely on these three divine abilities to reach the mid-Purple Mansion Realm!'

''Imperial Observation of the Origin' is too difficult, and 'Eternal Brightness Steps' is too inferior. The true barrier blocking him from reaching Purple Mystery is likely the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'.'

He watched Li Ximing's pensive, silent form, and his gaze filled with a flicker of hope.

'Granduncle...'

'The Old Master always said... Granduncle is a man of great fortune. If that's true... if he can survive after I am gone... then his only hope of ever passing Purple Mystery lies in the words I have spoken today...'

# Chapter 1091: Counter-Calculation

Li Ximing slowly emerged from his meditative state. The golden-eyed youth was already sitting in his seat, one hand raised, the other resting on his opposite wrist, lightly turning the Pure Yang Bracelets. Seeing Li Ximing finally awaken, he relaxed his hand, and his gold-patterned black robes fell, completely concealing his wrist.

Li Ximing felt as if he were waking from a dream. There was a film of cold sweat on the back of his neck, yet his mind felt incredibly clear and refreshed.

"I understand..." he said, his voice brimming with discovery. "So that was the key! So that's how it is! That's how it is!"

"I obtained Cui E's Radiant Qilin Refining Art and the six Bright Yang pill arts. I studied them one by one... but the Fading Sun Armor-Break Pill, the one that follows the path of evasion, always felt awkward and clumsy. It turns out its true application is here..."

His eyes were bright, his mind overflowing with new thoughts. He muttered to himself, pacing anxiously around the hall for two steps before continuing.

"And the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body... If an aspect of yin is placed upon it, it could greatly reduce the risks faced during reincarnation and the recreation of a new body!"

Li Zhouwei listened to it all, then smiled.

"The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body? When I saw you arrive, Grand-Uncle, your body had a heavy shadow, and your life-mandate was incomplete. So you were using an external object to preserve your life-mandate!"

Li Ximing gave a bitter smile.

"Your eyes are sharp. Just before I returned to the lake, I was beaten into a pathetic state by Helian Wumeng. His divine ability has grown, and he swallowed some unknown iron pill. Even my Merging Fire couldn't burn him!"

He very naturally took a small figurine, carved from mulberry wood, from his sleeve and handed it to Li Zhouwei, letting the youth inspect it closely.

"This is rather interesting."

Li Zhouwei studied it for a moment, then couldn't help but offer a warning.

"Grand-Uncle, you must be extremely careful. Whatever you do, never let Merging Fire burn this. This kind of thing damages one's essence and harms the life-mandate. Worse, it is bound to wood, which means the harm will be magnified exponentially. It will truly be fatal."

He then changed the subject.

"You were in meditation for nine days, Grand-Uncle. Aunt Minggong came by once but was blocked outside the hall by your divine ability."

Li Ximing finally understood. He flicked his sleeve and sighed.

"I know what it's about... It's just Yang Ruiyi looking for me again. He's in a hurry to use you!"

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei asked, intrigued.

"You've been in secluded cultivation for these past few years," Li Ximing said, "but the north's movements have become increasingly urgent. The chaos in Jiangbei back then was a great humiliation for Mount Dayang, and it also made Western Shu red-eyed with envy..."

"As time has passed, not only have the figures from the Profound Governance Pavilion thrown all their forces into the fight, but the stakes Mount Dayang has on the table have also grown heavier and heavier... What's more troublesome is that Qing Jifang still isn't satisfied after taking Xiaoshi. He's deployed men to the Great Western Plateau, forcing Profound Governance to pull its forces out of the Long region one by one, which now threatens Tangdao Mountain!"

Li Ximing's brows were tightly furrowed, clearly under immense pressure himself.

"There's one more point, and it's an extremely fatal one. The current Liangli of the Great Desire Dao is Tian Langzhi. His strength is terrifying, far beyond that of Vast Cicada."

"That beast was pursued by True Monarch Shangyuan with a sword until he had no path left. Not only was his Dharma body destroyed, he nearly lost his life-mandate. He was forced to swear an oath under the mediation of a great figure from the north that he would never advance south. But now, the Great Song has pushed deep into Jiangbei, even crossing the mountains and approaching the Central Plains. We don't know the exact wording of the oath, but it's highly likely he's now free to act."

"Because of this, Situ Huo dares not leave the mountain even more. He can only defend it day after day. The situation has deteriorated to the point where the northerners have bypassed the mountain and struck at the river, right across from the Wilderness. Although the White River hasn't been lost, Jiangxia was badly wounded."

The eastern part of Jiangbei, which included areas like Chengshui Marsh, had never been fully reclaimed in the first place, so it wasn't surprising that a retreat would easily push them back to the river. After hearing all this, Li Zhouwei looked doubtful.

"If the northern line is so tight, how did you have time to come back, Grand-Uncle?"

Li Ximing sighed.

"I didn't... Not only that, but the south specifically requested mediators. Jiangxia and Cheng Qian were both transferred to the north. Jianglong and Yang Ruizao were also temporarily pulled to Holder of the Profound to help watch the riverbank. Almost eighty percent of the Great Song's entire military strength is pressed against both sides of that river."

"The border I guard isn't considered the front line, but it was still breached several times by Helian Wumeng and his men. My Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body is perfectly suited to absorbing his spell arts, which is why I look mostly fine... I just... injured my Dharma body a little..."

"The reason I was able to return... is because General Yang personally summoned me to come and ask you to emerge from seclusion!"

Although in the eyes of the public, Li Zhouwei was still at the second divine ability level, the current him, armed to the teeth, was in no way inferior to an ordinary mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. He was also an extremely important target for the enemy, making him exceptionally useful.

Li Zhouwei pondered this for a long time before asking,

"This Situ Huo... what kind of person is he?"

Li Ximing hesitated for a breath before answering.

"Yang Ruiyi values him highly. He selected and promoted several people from the remnants Situ Huo found. The old bastard is a cunning and despicable sort. Yang Ruiyi having him defend Tangdao was the right call... It's just... Ning Wan is having a hard time. Yang Ruiyi had no choice but to send her to Tongmo to guard the west."

Hearing Li Ximing call him cunning and despicable, Li Zhouwei was somewhat surprised.

"For you to have such a high evaluation of him, Grand-Uncle... If he's a smart man, then he certainly won't make things difficult for you right now..."

Li Ximing nodded. Li Zhouwei relaxed his hands.

"I still need to make a trip to Mount Dali," he said. "As for my emergence, Grand-Uncle, you can use that to handle Yang Ruiyi. We don't need to be wary of him for now. After all, we saw from the last battle for the mountain that he is a man of deep strategy who loves surprise attacks. If we want to get rid of those monks, we will definitely need him."

"As for the two children... Que'Wan's spiritual item..."

When Li Zhouwei mentioned Li Que'wan, a proud smile spread across Li Ximing's face.

"Que'Wan mastered the secret arts long ago! I've already used a great pill to trade with the Chunyi Dao Gate for the other Whole Pill spiritual items she needed. I sent her into seclusion! It's been..."

He pinched his fingers, calculating.

"It's been about two years now!"

"That speed... is almost catching up to me!"

A look of surprise crossed Li Zhouwei's face. He nodded in satisfaction and retreated from the room. Li Ximing watched his junior quietly conceal his aura and depart, and he couldn't help but laugh secretly in his heart.

'This is going to be a good show!'

...

The Wilderness, Jiangjuan Prefecture.

The surging river glittered. Before long, a streak of brilliant light shot over from the north, appearing colorful and extremely dazzling.

The figure, dressed in black robes, had a somewhat honest face. He rode on fire and rain, passed through the clouds, and stopped before the main hall. He walked inside, bowed deeply, and called out,

"Your subordinate greets the Great General."

Yang Ruiyi, who had been standing at the head of the hall with his hands behind his back, immediately strode down.

"What did you find?"

The man replied, "I scouted all the way north. Helian Wujiang has already arrived at Helian Wumeng's camp. Shilou Fangjing has also left the Qi Lands. But... Qi Lanyan, his whereabouts are unknown..."

"Further past the mountains, there are vast expanses of banners. At times, demonic flames rage; at others, the light of the Lesser Yang manifests. There are also the clouds of Converging Water, churning endlessly. The rumors of the Touba family moving south are likely true!"

He hesitated for a moment before continuing, "There were abnormal movements in the Great Void in that area. I was afraid of being discovered, so I didn't dare get too close. But from a distance, I could see a string of heavy, sinking light. Your subordinate suspects... I suspect it's some kind of treasure."

Hearing this, Yang Ruiyi's expression immediately darkened, but he still nodded at the man, his tone polite.

"Thank you for your hard work, clan cousin!"

This man was none other than Li Chenghuai's maternal uncle, Yang Ruizao!

Yang Ruizao bowed and shook his head, voicing his doubt.

"I sense... the Touba family has some unusual methods."

Yang Ruiyi was silent for a moment before speaking in a low, heavy voice.

"Back then, Touba Changming surrendered to Wei and was granted the royal surname Yuan, officially becoming Yuan Changming. He received one of the Twelve Profound Talismans, and the Wei Emperor assigned him a Daoist Traditionthe Daoist Tradition of Demon Monarch Lu Xi of Azure Profoundity. However, the Azure Profoundity Daoist Tradition has always been astonishingly difficult to obtain. Yuan Changming only got his hands on some scraps before he died, and it wasn't passed down. He only left behind that one obscure Great Honored Book of Xuanxi, which the Touba family has always claimed was lost with the fall of Liang."

"This Monarch was one of the four ancestors of the Demon Dao, the master of one of the Four Demon Legacies... You should understand what this means. Among the four ancestors, Demon Monarch Chang Su taught the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch, and Demon Monarch Lu Xi enlightened the demon head Ting Shi. Both of them were figures who played with souls and the Great Void to the absolute extreme."

"This means that the Daoist Tradition and inheritance of two of the Four Demon Ancestors are in the Touba family's hands. This is how they were able to become the agents of the orthodox Demon Dao, and how they ensured that Shengle Heaven has not wavered, surviving to this day."

His expression was grim.

"When Father and the others jointly shrouded fate to plot against Tuoba Chongyuan, it wasn't to kill him in his cradle. There was another calculation. It was to use the Dragon-kin as a blade to test the Touba family's methods. In the end, we timed it just right to let Touba Lan come over, and he truly did just flick his sleeve and collect that remnant soul."

Yang Ruizao had also lived through that turmoil and had even lent a talisman to save Li Xizhi. The memory came back to him instantly.

Yang Ruiyi continued, "We were suspicious back then. We feared that after the fall of Liang, they no longer dared to cultivate the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch's Daoist Tradition and had instead secretly begun studying the Great Honored Book of Xuanxi they'd kept hidden... Otherwise, how could a complete novice like Touba Lan have been capable of collecting a remnant soul?"

"The scene you saw in the Great Void must be the power manifesting from the Xuanxi Demon Legacy. For them to display it so openly... Profound Governance must have compromised. They are using the Touba family to check Exiled Qi!"

Yang Ruizao found this hard to believe.

"Demon Monarch Lu Xi... even if he was one of the Four Demons, he has been dead for many years. How can he possibly stand against the supreme Exiled Qi!"

Evidently, Yang Ruizao was used to the omnipotence of the Underworld. To accept that the legacy left by a Demon Monarch dead for countless years could counterbalance Exiled Qi... how could he not be horrified!

'My own Lord is a figure of what stature! What is a Demon Ancestor? Even he would have to bow his head upon seeing Him!'

Yang Ruiyi, however, turned, his hands clasped behind his back.

"Now you're being shallow!" he said in a low tone. "Demon Monarch Lu Xi was a personal disciple of the Azure Profoundity Master! Do you know what kind of figure that is? Even the Great Sage True Hornless Dragon, who constantly thought and proclaimed himself a member of Azure Profoundity... would have to curry favor and call this Demon Monarch disciple-brother!"

Yang Ruizao had never cultivated in the Underworld and knew very little of these matters. He was rooted to the spot in shock. Yang Ruiyi had clearly been suppressing this for days and was now venting.

"And it's not just Demon Monarch Lu Xi. Wuguan goes without saying, but the other two Demon Ancestors could also come and go freely in the face of Exiled Qi. Those were the ancient Demon Lords! In the age when Immortal Lords stood side-by-side, who dared to call themselves a demon head? At the very least, they had to achieve 'Heaven and Earth cannot control, karma cannot bind.' How many people back then dared to make such a claim?"

Yang Ruizao wiped away his cold sweat and repeatedly agreed. Yang Ruiyi stopped himself in time, gave him a long look, and turned to ask,

"Is there still no news from Ting Province?"

He had expected to hear more of Li Ximing's excuses. He didn't expect a commotion from the men outside. One man stepped forward, bowed, and reported,

"General! Daoist Master Zhaojing has arrived in Ting! This lowly one did not dare to disturb important military matters!"

"Quickly, have him come up!"

A flicker of hope ignited in Yang Ruiyi's eyes. He gestured for his clan cousin, who cultivated in Jiangnan, to retreat, while simultaneously schooling his anxious expression. He sat in the main seat, and sure enough, he saw Li Ximing stride in quickly.

Yang Ruiyi smiled.

"Brother Ximing!"

Li Ximing, however, looked haggard, his eyes filled with sorrow. He looked like a man utterly lost. He stared at Yang Ruiyi for a long moment before replying,

"Great General..."

How could Yang Ruiyi not see his expression? His heart sank, and true anxiety began to set in.

'I sent him that Horn Wood spiritual resource. It should have been enough for his injuries... How can this be? Is Li Zhouwei's injury even worse than I thought! So bad that it's made him this distraught?... Or... after I took such a risk to protect Ting Province, is Li Ximing still playing games with me at a time like this!'

His face hardened.

"Brother Ximing, this is..."

Li Ximing looked left and right, then sighed without speaking. Yang Ruiyi immediately waved his sleeve, and the doors and windows of the great hall slammed shut. A thick, spiritual light suffused with Exiled Qi began to circulate, sealing off the chamber and even isolating it from the Great Void.

Who would have thought that the moment the doors closed, Li Ximing's back straightened, his sighs ceased, and his weary eyes filled with brilliant light. His entire demeanor changed in an instant. He faced Yang Ruiyi squarely and gave a formal bow.

"Congratulations, my lord!"

Yang Ruiyi was genuinely stunned for a second. Joy surged through his heart, but before he could even process it, he found himself looking at the man before him in a new light. His expression was peculiar.

'I still underestimated him. He truly is a Li family scion... so proper, so honest-looking... he can actually act!'

He wasn't angry. Instead, he looked almost amused.

"Ximing, what is this?"

Li Ximing smiled.

"I heard the General mention that there is a Daoist Master on the other side... one with extremely sharp eyes. Since I've left the front lines and have been running between the lake and the Wilderness for days, how could he not know?"

How could Yang Ruiyi not understand? Li Ximing was helping him plot against the northerners!

These past days, more and more northern cultivators had been gathering, slowly forming an encirclement around Tangdao Mountain. Situ Huo was sending him a new message every three days. The pressure on him was terrifying. Receiving good news was already a joy, but seeing Li Ximing's actions made him want to clap and cheer.

The man immediately shot to his feet, laughing.

"Good!"

He praised him, then immediately fell into thought, his voice deepening.

"Then we can't wait... Now that King Wei has recovered his strength, we will immediately form a surprise force and lift the siege on Tangdao Mountain!"

But Li Ximing just looked at him with a smile, and shook his head slightly.

Yang Ruiyi paused. He watched Li Ximing extend his hand and hold up three fingers.

"It's good news!"

The black-robed man stared blankly at him, then understood instantly. His heart seized.

"What?!"

'This... this is what kind of speed?! Is this just a blessing of fate? Don't tell me he's Li Xunquan reincarnated!'

But the intense shock flashed through his mind for only an instant. Yang Ruiyi immediately realized this was a perfect, heaven-sent opportunity. He felt completely refreshed. He paced twice on the high platform, his mood entirely different. His eyes were burning.

"Good... good... I understand."

# Chapter 1092 Probing

The cave residence was pitch black.

On a green jade table sat a round jade disk, roughly the size of a human head. Emerald light flickered across its surface as intricate, thread-like patterns emerged one by one. A young man held a jade knife, his focus absolute as he meticulously carved.

Formation disks were a fusion of artifact refinement and formation arts. This was precisely why they were so rare and precious, especially at higher grades. To master even one of these Daos was a remarkable achievement; finding an individual proficient in both was exceedingly difficult.

Even though Li Suining was a man living a second life, he had never considered attempting it. Carving this jade disk now was merely a special training exercise.

'It's now... the tenth month of Martial Cultivation Year Nine.'

'I wonder how Suikuan and the others are doing...'

As the spiritual qi flowed through the cavern, the white-robed man anxiously set down the jade knife and let out a long breath. He stood and paced a few steps before stopping at the doorway. He hesitated for a moment, but did not step outside.

Li Suining had been here for more than three years, a situation that amounted to house arrest. He was growing unbearably restless.

"Little Uncle said he was also under house arrest... forbidden from leaving. But in the spring of Martial Cultivation Year Ten, the Touba family invades Huai, Western Shu sends out its feelers, and he joins the battle, revealing his Sword Intent... Does that mean they're waiting until the enemy is at the gates before they let him out?"

"If that's the case, why bother with this house arrest at all!"

Li Suining truly could not understand. With the Martial Cultivation Star shining, and with those at the divine ability level holding back, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was more than capable of contributing on the battlefield without being easily killed. Why all this secrecy!

Most importantly, if he was stuck here, how could he alter the course of events? The 'Touba invasion of Huai' was one thing, but what about the 'Battle of Baihai' in Martial Cultivation Year Eighteen? Or even further out, the Changhe Rebellion that would claim his Little Uncle's life? If he was still powerless to act, what room to maneuver did he have!

His heart tightened with anxiety as he secretly calculated.

'That great battle injured his Lordship. I wonder if he's recovered. When the Touba family invades this time, will King Wei... also fight Touba Lan?'

As he was lost in thought, he noticed the door to his cave residence tremble slightly. The surrounding silence was absolute, and his heart leaped into his throat.

A low hum...

Brilliant Heavenly Light suddenly spilled in. A man in ink-black robes had appeared. Though his golden eyes held no malice, their gaze pierced Li Suining like a blade, making his heart tremble. In the next instant, he was filled with overwhelming joy!

'King Wei is out of seclusion!'

He prostrated without hesitation, his voice full of respect.

"This junior pays his respects to King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes focused on him.

"You're a sensible one."

Although Li Zhouwei was the King Wei, most clansmen within Ting Province still referred to him as Daoist Master. It was typically the Daoist Masters from surrounding territories, those who had taken over Yang Song's position, who addressed him as King Wei. Li Suining's choice of address was, therefore, proper.

He studied the young man for a long moment, then paced forward until he stood before him. He glanced at a letter on the table.

"It seems Jiangchun is quite fond of you."

Li Suining, already on edge, suddenly understood the precarity of his situation. A cold sweat broke out on his back. He scrambled to reply,

"Little Uncle... cares for all us juniors... not just me."

The Daoist Master nodded, his eyes fixed quietly on him.

"The clan was already monitoring the Weizeng affair. You played your part well. Zhoufang escaped a calamity by chance when he was young, and now, by another 'chance,' he saves Guest Retainer Ding. Now all eyes are on him."

'Daoist Master... has he realized something?'

The words were spoken flatly, but they plunged Li Suining into an icy abyss. His heart sank. He remained kneeling for a moment before answering,

"This junior... doesn't understand. I lost my father when I was young. I only have a few elders to rely on."

"It matters not."

This King Wei of Great Song was merely probing; he already had his own conclusions. He gave Li Suining a look that held a trace of a smile. The only sound in the cave was the hollow echo of his boots on the stone floor. Li Suining kept his head bowed, silent.

Ever since Li Ximing had returned from the Chunyi Dao Gate and seen Chi Buzi, he had been speculating about the illusory colors he had witnessed in the Immortal Mirror's vision. The Li clan had seen countless geniuses; Li Zhouwei had even met the famed Xueyang of Mount Luoxia!

But not even that Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia had drawn the slightest favor from the Immortal Mirror. And the fact that Chi Buzi had been possessed was something Li Xuanxuan had witnessed with his own eyes. It could not be wrong.

'Today's Chi Buzi is likely just someone else wearing that skin-bag. It's highly probable that what triggered the Immortal Mirror was the possession technique itself—one from the heavens!'

And Li Suining's unparalleled talent in the Dao of formations, combined with his extraordinary mind, served as the perfect proof!

'How could anyone be born with such knowledge... It must be possession!'

But even knowing that the person inside Li Suining's body was likely one of "their own" from the heavens, Li Zhouwei would say nothing to expose him. He wouldn't even hint that they were on the same side.

He even had to help Li Suining maintain his cover.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes rested on Li Suining. He gave a slight wave of his hand, cutting off the words the young man was about to speak.

'Whichever Lord is backing you... you've clearly gone to great lengths. You can't reveal the plan, so don't bother saying it.'

A bitter taste filled Li Suining's mouth. His own thoughts were the complete opposite.

'I can't hide it from these powerful divine ability experts!'

What he, Li Suining, needed most was the trust of Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing. In this day and age, without the backing and resources that came from the trust of a Purple Mansion Realm expert, what influence could he possibly have on the world? King Wei's current attitude left him completely uncertain.

But then, Li Zhouwei took a step toward him and smiled.

"Whatever you need, just report it directly to me. I'll take care of it. There's no need to go through Zhoufang and the others. Their words... are often useless."

'What?'

Li Suining was completely floored. He froze, stammering,

"This..."

Li Zhouwei helped him to his feet. The King Wei's golden eyes glinted with a probing light.

"However... before that... I need to take you on a trip to Mount Dali."

"Are you willing?"

Though his mind was clouded with doubt, Li Suining bowed deeply.

"This junior will obey your Lordship's every command!"

This was a move Li Zhouwei had planned long ago.

'The Fox-kin... their stance is still ambiguous. Li Suining is the perfect test!'

Li Ximing's hint about Chi Buzi had suggested a figure from the heavens. But Li Zhouwei, who had been part of the Dragon-Fox Pact, couldn't help but feel it referred to the powerful being behind the Fox-kin.

The Fox-kin had protected the Li clan for generations, acting on an entrustment from some ancient immortal. This itself was likely an arrangement from the heavens. Li Suining's anomaly was, without a doubt, the perfect touchstone.

The golden-eyed young man was perfectly calm, his thoughts clear.

'This is a two-way verification. There is a great power behind the Fox-kin. If Li Suining isn't one of their agents, the Fox-kin will almost certainly sense something is off.'

'And if Li Suining _is_ an agent from the heavens, he can be used to probe the Fox-kin's attitude. From the information about Chi Buzi, it's possible the Fox-kin have their own connection to the heavens!'

He summoned a beam of light, murmuring inwardly.

'By observing the reactions on both sides, I can learn so much.'

'If... this all works out, Li Suining... will be immensely useful!'

...

The sky was a leaden gray, weighed down by heavy, dark clouds.

Beyond the great plain that formed the Jiangbei heartland, along the banks of Baijiang Creek, stood an imposing mountain. Its thick earth was a sallow-yellow, and its massive boulders were menacing. Palaces and halls were scattered across the barren slopes, but not a single tree was in sight.

Tangdao Mountain had once been a treacherous peak. It had been corrupted by a cache of Primordial Magnetism, destabilizing its earth-qi. Then, a convulsion of Manifestations Earth had transformed the Primordial Magnetism, hollowing out the mountain's core. Situ Huo had immediately seized the location and unleashed a torrent of Metal Malice. Like a terminally ill man taking a final, desperate dose of medicine, the mountain had finally died, becoming a desolate, barren waste.

Viewed from the northern plains, the mountain was a study in shadows, its colors heavy and dark.

A man stood against the skyline. He appeared to be in his thirties or forties, with a high-bridged nose and deep-set eyes. His gaze was gloomy as he stared at the mountain, silent.

It was Helian Wujiang.

Before long, a young man in snowy-white-feathered robes descended from mid-air. He carried a long-hafted blade that shimmered with light. He was handsome, save for a small scar on one cheek, and his expression carried a shadow of gloom.

Helian Wujiang looked at his junior.

"The Touba have arrived?"

Helian Wumeng replied in a low voice, "Word has come... The Touba family is camped at Luoxia, led by Touba Lan himself. The Li and Ni families from Western Shu, who were lingering near Liang Province, have also pulled back. Now they're just hovering outside the Western Mountains."

"With their support gone, Murong Yan immediately conquered that position. I hear... Murong Yan has successfully cultivated the 'Spring of Rebirth'... He's already at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm."

Hearing this, Helian Wujiang shook his head.

"Don't waste your anger on Touba Lan. He may be of my generation, but he has the entire Touba family at his back. If he wants to stir up trouble, let him. For now, we endure."

Helian Wumeng raised a cold eyebrow.

"If it weren't for his name, what would he be? Uncle, you and he reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at the same time. He used every priceless resource imaginable and still lost to you. He's a dishonorable man, and he still resents that loss to this day!"

Helian Wujiang had been born during the Helian family's darkest hour. He had not only reached the Purple Mansion Realm at a young age, but his pace had been no slower than that of Golden Core scions like Touba Lan, who cultivated in grotto-heavens. He had been a top-tier genius. It was only after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm that the gap between them slowly widened, but he seemed utterly unbothered, his expression placid.

"I hear King Dai has already mastered all five methods, and the Young Lord is also at the Purple Mansion Realm. Don't provoke him. You've only just integrated the Iron Edict Elixir; you haven't mastered the other two treasures. You should be biding your time."

The young man shook his head.

"Situ Huo is holding the mountain, and Great General Yang can reinforce him at any moment. Jiangjuan has no big movements. However... there is news from the north bank of Ting Province."

Helian Wujiang raised an eyebrow as his junior continued with a cold laugh.

"Sima Yuanli went over with Great General Yang's orders. It seems his talks with Li Ximing didn't go well. He went twice in three days and came back disappointed both times. He couldn't give the general an answer... and was left cooling his heels outside the main hall for quite a while."

Helian Wujiang was a natural schemer; how could he miss the meaning behind this? He shook his head.

"They're desperate to get Li Zhouwei out of seclusion. It seems Li Ximing's stance is firm. They were forced to send Sima Yuanli to persuade him, but Sima Yuanli doesn't want to offend either side, and he doesn't have the backbone for the task. How could he possibly persuade him?"

"But if they sent someone with backbone," Helian Wumeng interjected, "they'd just offend the Li family..."

Helian Wujiang shook his head again.

"You're overestimating the Li clan. Without Li Zhouwei, the Li clan is no better than the Lingu family. Don't you see those two Li family princes... that Jiangxia and Li Jianglong? They're being forcibly transferred to the north right now. And for what? Isn't it just to force Li Zhouwei out of seclusion?"

"Those two are guarding Baijiang Creek, and the danger is mounting. Last time, Jiangxia was heavily injured. What will happen next time? You must not underestimate Great General Yang."

Helian Wumeng was pensive. He looked up at the sky, at the mass of rolling black clouds to the south. A streak of light shot through the darkness and landed in his palm.

The fierce general of the Helian family read the message, his eyes widening slightly.

"News from the Touba!"

Helian Wujiang turned his head instantly.

"Touba Lan and his men laid siege for several days," Helian Wumeng reported.

"They used their treasures to surround the mountain and have confirmed a fluctuation of Exiled Qi within Tangdao Mountain! Yang Ruiyi... has almost certainly arrived to reinforce the north and is now trapped inside!"

This new information made Helian Wujiang's eyes narrow.

One had to understand that with the arrival of the Touba family, the allied armies of Zhao State were now strong enough to suppress Great Song. With Western Shu on the sidelines, eager to stir up trouble, any escalation would mean that Great Song would be at a severe disadvantage on the main battlefield.

The only reason for the long delay was Yang Ruiyi.

"That man relies on his Exiled Qi Spiritual Treasure to come and go like a ghost. If he ambushes and suppresses someone, he could kill them without a sound, reversing the entire situation. That's why everyone has been hesitating..."

But as Western Shu's forces had slowly pulled back, Helian Wumeng knew that Profound Governance had long been planning a major southern invasion.

"Now that the Touba family's occult barrier is in place... if they can confirm that a large contingent of divine ability experts is pinning down Yang Ruiyi and Situ Huo at Tangdao Mountain, the other flank can launch a direct invasion. The only one left to fight is Liu Bai. This isn't just an advantage; it's a heaven-sent opportunity!"

Helian Wujiang's expression darkened.

"Touba Lan wants to... press the attack on Tangdao Mountain and force Yang Ruiyi's hand."

Helian Wumeng just laughed, his voice light.

"I think it's more than that. He's just riding the wave. So what if he has a conspiracy? The current strength of Zhao State... is more than enough to fight him head-on. In fact, we're waiting for a major conflict!"

His gaze was filled with disdain.

"Li Zhouwei hasn't shown his face in years. That group of Lords must be getting anxious. Qi Lanyan is fanning the flames, and he'll certainly never let Li Zhouwei heal his internal injuries completely. As for casualties? Who cares?"

He dismissed the glowing message in his hand and lowered his gaze.

"I haven't seen him in years, either. This order is perfect. I'm going to cross the river and see what he's capable of now!"

Helian Wujiang's eyes hardened.

"It's time you went. But be careful. Your divine ability may be on par with his, but a single Iron Edict Elixir isn't enough to guarantee your escape from him."

The younger man took a deep, excited breath, his hand drifting up to the scar on his-face.

"Don't worry... Clan Uncle. If I can face a trial of life and death under his halberd, it will force me to improve. Besides... in truth, he and I... we're the same."

His handsome face twisted with a dark, sinister energy.

"I will avenge my ancestors, and I will turn the world upside down to do it. Having an opponent like him is the perfect chance to refine the Iron Edict Elixir in the crucible of battle. If I can't even survive against Li Zhouwei, then your nephew will only die a more pathetic death later on..."

"And to be blunt, they can't stand to see me wield the Helian family's three king-artifacts. They'll try to kill me sooner or later. To die under his halberd... not only might it win a sliver of pity from those Lords, it would be a satisfying end."

Li Suining "Divine Sequence" [Early Foundation Establishment Realm]

Li Zhouwei [Mid Purple Mansion Realm]




# Chapter 1093: Grand Divination

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing... what was his reply?"

Heavy snow fell on the shore. In the Great Void, a figure of multicolored light stood. The Daoist Master's face was like jade, a vermilion dot on his brow. He held a small, crimson cauldron, his bearing extraordinary, yet his face was clouded with worry.

At Cheng Qian's question, the dejected Sima Yuanli was at a loss for words. He could only say,

"This time... I couldn't even see him. A junior of his came to turn me away, claiming he's in closed-door cultivation refining pills and at a critical juncture. He can't be disturbed."

Cheng Qian's expression changed. He shook his head.

"How can he play so hard!"

Li Ximing's excuse was laughably false, a complete slap in the face to the Yang family. Sima Yuanli's expression was bitter.

"What else can be done? Logically, even if his injuries haven't healed, he should have at least come out to meet us, even if wounded. For him to be this unyielding..."

"How will the Great General handle this?"

Although Cheng Qian hadn't interacted much with Li Ximing, he seemed to have a favorable impression of the Li family and didn't want to see major casualties. A shadow crossed his features.

He watched as Sima Yuanli gritted his teeth.

"The Great General said... to pay him no mind."

'Li Zhouwei is the high and mighty King Wei,' Sima Yuanli thought, 'He doesn't even have to set foot in the Great Song court. I won't say how much higher his status is than Yang Ruiyi's, but they're peers at minimum. Li Ximing is, strictly speaking, King Wei's subordinate. For the moment, Yang Ruiyi truly can't touch him...'

But the meaning was clear. If the Li family wouldn't contribute to the border defense, the Yang family wouldn't send men to guard the lake. They were telling Li Ximing to guard it himself.

This was a scenario Sima Yuanli had desperately wanted to avoid.

Everyone knew that with Situ Huo entering Song, Ning Wan was in a difficult position. But the truth was, he, Sima Yuanli... was in no better a situation!

'Of the old Azure Pond Three Yuans, only Yuanwu was on good terms with the Situ family. The others couldn't stand the sight of them! Yuansu and Situ Huo were practically mortal enemies. My own master was only slightly better—he merely refrained from taking revenge before he died!'

Sima Yuanli was, in his heart, deeply opposed to Situ Huo's presence in Song. The man before him, Cheng Qian, might be polite, but Sima Yuanli knew full well that his master, Daoist Master Xianyao, was the one who had spent years building bridges for Situ Huo. When the Kong Clan and the Situ family had their falling out, it was Xianyao who had profited the most!

'And now Xianyao plays the peacemaker, but he's clearly on Situ Huo's side!'

In the entire court, only Liu Bai could truly challenge Situ Huo. But as fate would have it, Ning Wan had plotted against Liu Bai, forcibly dragging him onto the Great Song's war chariot. While that Jade True sword cultivator didn't seem to hold a grudge, he had clearly adopted an attitude of cutting off all ties...

Faced with Situ Huo, Sima Yuanli had no choice but to help Ning Wan. This had immediately shattered the Great Song's internal unity. The faction led by Situ Huo held immense power and influence. It was a complete mess.

'The Holder of the Profound has its count. Although that time hasn't come, that day will... If Li Ximing and Yang Ruiyi have a falling out... I won't even be able to borrow King Wei's influence...'

His worried gaze fell on Cheng Qian, making the Daoist Master frown slightly. Sima Yuanli noticed and looked up, probing,

"I was wondering... Cheng Qian... do you have any solution..."

"Me?" Cheng Qian let out a laugh. "Daoist Friend Qinghu, you must be truly desperate to be grasping at any straw, but surely not to the point of coming to me."

The youth showed no sign of worry.

"However... I don't think there's any need for such anxiety. For now, Lord Yang is guarding the west, Protector-General Liu is leading the Holders of Profound to assault the Capital immortals territory, and we are to support Senior Tinglan. We just need to follow orders."

Sima Yuanli, however, knew just how risky Yang Ruiyi's operation was. He cursed internally.

'You cultivate the "Whole Pill," so of course you're not afraid! That half-immortal, half-demon, half-shaman Dao lineage is bizarre to its very core. The moment you sense trouble, you'll run faster than anyone!'

But cursing was all he could do. A moment later, Sima Yuanli was struck by an even deeper unease.

'Lord Yang is being ruthless this time. I wonder what he promised Chen Yin to make him lead the charge. That old man is already fighting like he has a death wish. I dread to think what his end will be.'

He, Sima Yuanli, could understand Chen Yin's state of mind, and it put him on high alert.

'Though I am at my peak and have no immediate worries, and I have an outstanding descendant in Xun... the world is unpredictable. I must use this unprecedented 500-year shift in True Qi to send him to the Purple Mansion Realm as soon as possible.'

...

Mount Dali.

The mountain ranges rose and fell, blanketed in flying snow. A streak of Heavenly Light descended gracefully, landing lightly amidst the forest.

Li Zhouwei touched down among the peaks and noticed small demons bustling about. The once-empty cave residences were gradually filling with life, and the number of demon beasts had clearly increased.

'Mount Dali... it's become much more prosperous!'

Thanks to the shifting power dynamics in Jiangnan and the decline of the Azure Pond Sect, fewer cultivators now ventured into Mount Dali, allowing the demon beasts to be spared. Furthermore, the Li family's unification of Moongaze Lake had transformed the relationship between the rogue cultivators and clan cultivators of Ting Province and Mount Dali. What was once a hunting ground had slowly become a place of trade, breathing new life into the entire mountain range.

The moment Li Zhouwei landed, demon beasts from several nearby peaks took to the air to see. Upon recognizing him, their faces paled in alarm, and they all cried out, "Great King!"

A middle-aged man stumbled through the air toward him.

"Lu Ken greets the Great King!"

This deer demon had been one of Bai Rong the fox's attendants back in the day. Now, he had managed to become a minor king himself, but he was still flustered at the sight of Li Zhouwei. He led him inside, and once again, they arrived at the great pool on the main peak's summit.

White mist billowed and clouds of qi swirled. From within, a beautiful man emerged. He was tall and slender, his features soft, handsome, and bewitching. He stopped before the steps and offered his congratulations.

"Congratulations, Great King!"

It was none other than the Tingfu Demon King, Qingyu Qian!

Li Suining, who had accompanied him, had long since calmed his heart. Now, he gazed at his surroundings, marveling.

'So this is... a treasured land of the fox-kind!'

The Demon King was, after all, a fox. He was exquisitely beautiful, his bright eyes fixed on Li Suining with a peculiar expression. Li Zhouwei returned the courtesy,

"The joy is mutual."

Qingyu Qian was congratulating Li Zhouwei on reaching the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. In turn, Li Zhouwei's golden eyes swept over him, seeing just as clearly. The Demon King made no effort to hide it—he had impressively already stepped past the threshold of Purple Mystery.

Demon beasts had long lifespans but cultivated slowly. This was, without a doubt, a massive breakthrough, one that might have taken him one or even two hundred years to achieve. It should have been an occasion for great celebration, yet the Demon King before him showed little joy. As he invited Li Zhouwei inside, he replied,

"I have no joy to speak of. The Dao path of this life has reached its end."

He waved his sleeve, clearing the white fog, and invited Li Zhouwei to sit. Li Suining naturally stood respectfully to the side. Only then did Li Zhouwei allow a trace of doubt to show.

"Is it because the 'Heaven-Governing' Dao lineage is incomplete?"

Qingyu Qian let out a self-deprecating laugh and shook his head.

"I've always been dull-witted, simply not the material for Dao cultivation. And now, the 'Heaven-Governing' path has its spiritual inspiration imprisoned and its Rank Designation obscured by exile. It's impossible to achieve anything astonishing. All that's left for me is to waste away my remaining days."

He spoke to Li Zhouwei, but his gaze remained fixed on Li Suining, a warm smile playing on his lips. He poured a clear wine, setting out three jade cups and filling each. He then made an inviting gesture toward Li Suining as well.

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. Li Suining respectfully accepted the cup with thanks. He had no idea what kind of immortal brew it was. He cautiously lifted it to sniff, preparing to just barely touch it with his upper lip.

Who could have known? The instant he inhaled, the immortal brew acted like a living thing. It transformed into a stream of cool qi that shot up his nasal cavity and straight into his Shengyang Acupoint. His face flushed crimson. He staggered back a step and, with a thud, collapsed to the ground, unconscious.

Only then did Li Zhouwei set down his own cup.

"Well?"

Qingyu Qian simply smiled.

"Favored by the Book of Elements... his nobility is beyond words!"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow.

"Book of Elements?"

The fox demon stood, his expression turning reverent.

"The Heaven-Governing Rank Designation—the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book!"

This demon was truly a great fox demon. The smile vanished from his face, and his handsome, charming features instantly became cold and severe, revealing an air of unspeakable dignity.

"The Orthodox Origin Yin-Yang, the Three Profound Great Daoist tradition. The Azure Profoundity is lofty and solitary, ethereal and detached from the world. The Comprehending Profoundity flourishes, its palaces filled with disciples, always dabbling in worldly affairs. But Encompassing Profoundity... it had three Monarchs and five immortals. Its immortal might was vast and boundless."

"Heaven-Governing originated in Encompassing Profoundity. Before the masters of the Three Profoundities spread their teachings to the world, they first accepted disciples. The master of Encompassing Profoundity had a disciple, surname Chunyu, name Zhao. He 'verified' the Dao of 'Heaven-Governing' and was titled Qingyi, noble enough to be an Immortal Lord."

He paused slightly.

"That Immortal Lord Huan Xuan, the one who established the Northern Palace Divine Thunder, was his disciple-brother. He only verified his Dao and left later because he was guarding the Dao lineage. That, and the fact that the Thunder Palace is more famous, is why he is so well-known. As for that Master Canyan, the patriarch revered by the Seven Aspects? He was merely one of Immortal Lord Qingyi's in-name disciples."

He seemed both resigned and helpless as he was forced to add,

"The Buddhist cultivators call him The Buddhists' Celestial Participant of the Dams. If you really want to compare, his achievements were no less than an Immortal Lord's... And he had a disciple who was even more famous: Celestial Enlightenment Su Xikong, the foundational pillar of the modern Buddhist Dao."

He closed his mouth, saying no more. Li Zhouwei was somewhat shaken.

"I knew Encompassing Profoundity was formidable, but I never imagined... formidable to this extent!"

"It was more than just formidable!" Qingyu Qian shook his head and sighed. "In its glory days, Encompassing Profoundity's might shook the eight directions and looked down upon the nine provinces. Even the invincible Chunhuo Great Sage—that Yuwu bird—had to send his second son over to seek the Dao. You need only look at the power of Merging Fire and Converging Water today to know how rampant that Great Sage was back then."

Li Zhouwei nodded, then asked,

"If that's the case, shouldn't 'Heaven-Governing,' being even more powerful, have governed over all things?"

Qingyu Qian paused, stunned, then shook his head.

"It's not like that. There is attaining the Dao, verifying the Dao, and seeking the Dao. In ancient times, these terms were clearly distinct. A Great Sage is born and nurtured by heaven and earth, a symbol of a Fruition Attainment. When one flourishes, all flourish; when one is harmed, all are harmed. This is different from an Immortal Lord, whose karma resides freely within himself. The ancient Immortal Lords respected heaven and earth and did not wish to use their personal actions to influence the rise and fall of Fruition Attainments—they disliked it and would not do it. A Great Sage, however, cannot help but have an influence."

Li Zhouwei's own Dao-Profundity was not shallow; he understood at once and nodded.

Qingyu Qian continued,

"This thing, a Rank Designation, can be seen as a special kind of Dharma Treasure. It typically manifests with a True Monarch and dissipates when the True Monarch perishes. It was the Great Dao of True Immortals first comprehended by Encompassing Profoundity. What Immortal Lord Qingyi held was not actually the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. It was the My Dao's Heaven-Governing Celestial Gate."

"Immortal Lord Qingyi's cultivation reached its zenith. Unable to advance, he prepared to shed his body to seek the Dao. But he worried for his Dao lineage. He was granted an audience with the master of the Three Profound Daos and obtained a method to separate his Rank Designation. Fearing that the My Dao's Heaven-Governing Celestial Gate was too powerful to be left without a master's control, lest it harm the world, he created the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. For a very long time, as 'Heaven-Governing' faded in and out of existence, this artifact was suppressed among the Dharma Treasures of the Encompassing Profoundity Immortal Court, used to calculate the affairs of the world..."

"Later, when the Thunder Palace cast its lightning, it relied on this artifact to calculate karma, ensuring the descending thunder had its count."

Qingyu Qian looked melancholic as he shook his head.

"And this artifact... was finally suppressed within Wanling Heaven!"

The golden-eyed youth before him nodded slightly, having already guessed the gist of it. A doubt rose in his heart.

'The timing doesn't add up... could it have been a possession partway through?'

As if on cue, Qingyu Qian gave a cold laugh.

"I heard that all the immortals gathered at that time, working together to transfer the artifact completely to the Underworld to prevent it from throwing the world into chaos. But several strands of fated opportunity escaped and fell upon the world. This junior of yours... just happened to obtain one of them!"

He appeared relaxed, but his eyes were locked onto the golden-eyed youth's changing expression. Li Zhouwei, having pondered this for a long time, replied,

"Senior is truly learned, versed in all matters ancient and modern."

"The Thunder Palace fell, the Great Zhou rose, and only after the Zhou came the Wei. Your human-recorded history only goes back to the Great Wei. Naturally, you are not sensitive to these matters."

He chuckled, but saw Li Zhouwei ask,

"I wonder, what kind of fated opportunity?"

Qingyu Qian mused for a moment.

"To know the future before it is divined; to perceive before all others!"

Li Zhouwei's expression tightened.

'So that's how it is!'

He was silent for a long time, his mind racing.

'That silver light... could it have been the Immortal Mirror sending a warning about the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book? If it's a supreme treasure of that origin, the legacy of a mighty Immortal Lord, it's not unthinkable that it would attract the attention of an Immortal Artifact... Is it possible that Chi Buzi also received one of these opportunities?'

He had come here to probe for answers and had received one that seemed to explain everything perfectly, with no loose ends.

Li Zhouwei pondered a moment longer, then followed this line of thought.

"If that's the case... does Senior know who else in the world might have received such an opportunity?"

Qingyu Qian burst out laughing.

"I never take a single step from this mountain, so I shouldn't know the talents of the world. But it just so happens that one such person did come here once. He threw the entirety of Jiangnan into chaos and had all the Purple Mansion Realm experts jumping in frustration!"

Li Zhouwei's eyebrows shot up, a look of dawning realization on his face.

The Demon King smiled.

"Precisely! Your family's good friend—surnamed Liu, named Changdie! He once had such an opportunity, a chance favor from the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. He was just like these people are now!"

Li Zhouwei shot to his feet, a sudden, stunning realization hitting him.

'So that's it! It all makes sense! This Senior Liu helped my family so many times for no apparent reason, building a connection... this must be why!'

But he held his tongue, for another, even more profound realization was dawning in his heart.

'Wait. If every word he's said is true, then the illusory, multicolored light seen in the Immortal Mirror's vision cannot be the favor of the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book—otherwise, my own ancestor would have noticed it!'

Even if his ancestor hadn't carefully inspected Liu Changdie, Liu Changdie had been on the very same island as Fuxun. Since Li Ximing detected Fuxun back then, it's impossible he would have missed Liu Changdie!

'There must be a celestial gambit at play on Suining. This so-called favor from the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book is just a superficial misdirection to hide the truth!'

He raised his head, his gaze sharp, meeting Qingyu Qian's stare. The Demon King gazed at him for a long time, as if he, too, was trying to make a judgment.

"He... should be King Wei's fated opportunity," Qingyu Qian said softly.




# Chapter 1094: Origin Heart

Li Zhouwei did not know the full implications of the "opportunity" the man spoke of. He pondered for a moment, then focused on the crucial point and asked,

"This favor from the Heavenly Element... what form does it take? What level must one's divine ability reach, what kind of mysteries must one possess, to see these 'favors' clearly? I only fear that this junior might be harmed by others!"

It was an extremely sharp question. Qingyu Qian fell silent, mulling it over for a long while.

Ostensibly, Li Zhouwei was asking about the manifestation of the Heavenly Element. But how could the mysteries of Rank Designation be fathomed by a cultivator below the True Monarch realm? Li Zhouwei was asking a question to which he already knew the answer. His first objective was to make Qingyu Qian personally deny any possibility that he had used some Heaven–Governing Daoist treasure to sense Li Suining. He wanted the fox-kin to admit that there was, indeed, a powerful figure backing him.

As such, the words that reached the fox Demon's ears carried a different meaning entirely.

'This matter with Li Suining and Liu Changdie being favored by the Heavenly Element... was it your backer who told you?'

And the deeper, potential meaning was even more pointed.

'If so, has this great person of yours been staring intently at my Li clan for the past hundred years? You, Qingyu Qian, possess the Celestial-Awakening Ear—what role, exactly, are you playing in all this?'

Qingyu Qian knew how deeply his Celestial-Awakening Ear was feared. Even in the ancient era, brimming with experts, this one divine ability was regarded as a terrifying and insidious Daoist art. The user themselves might not fear it, but whose family, whose juniors, didn't need to pass on secret arts or whispered inheritances? A single moment of carelessness, and one's weaknesses, flaws, or perhaps a vital technique, could fall straight into an enemy's ears.

The oppressive nature of the world was even greater now. To the Li clan, the Celestial-Awakening Ear was a dreadful threat. Simply using 'secluded cultivation' as an excuse years ago had not been enough to satisfy the White Qilin. If the fox-kin truly wanted to cooperate with the Li clan, this issue had to be resolved.

He paused, then said in an explanatory tone,

"Those favored by the Heavenly Element possess a natural ability to conceal themselves. It isn't simply that they are difficult to calculate. They are 'unclear,' existing 'outside of calculation.' It doesn't matter how high your divine ability is; you cannot even detect an anomaly."

"As for Liu Changdie, I don't know which faction handled his case. But the situation at the time was tense. The great figures had one consensus, that is, as long as the Jade True situation was unresolved, Anhuai and Wanling could not be breached. Yet, none of them trusted each other. No one was at ease placing him in another's hands, but they couldn't eliminate him either... After all, no one knew the true situation within Wanling Heaven, and keeping him alive was useful. Thus, they pushed him into the Vault Metal."

"The Vault Metal is a place to 'suspend and hide, not to be used.' In the eyes of those great figures, it was equivalent to locking him away in a treasure vault."

As he spoke of this, his expression was not calm. It was less complex than it was filled with a trace of hatred. His tone remained flat.

"But even this solution had a problem."

Qingyu Qian said softly,

"Now, the Book of Elements has fallen into the Exiled Qi. Obscured and entangled, it can no longer influence the present world. But that wasn't the case back then. The Book of Elements was still in Wanling. How much power did it have? What was its situation? No one knew. The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book could use one piece to move a hundred pieces across the world. The most critical task was to sever Liu Changdie's connection to it!"

"What those great figures wanted was the key. They wanted the Encompassing Profoundity treasures he unlocked while roaming the world. They had no intention of truly letting the Book of Elements place its pawns everywhere."

"Therefore, they needed something powerful enough to contend with the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book, something that could completely sever Liu Changdie from it without transferring the karmic consequences onto themselves."

"And so, Liu Changdie was brought to Moongaze Lake. The treasure there was the only suitable one. It was suitable to a point of absolute perfection."

Li Zhouwei's eyebrows twitched, his eyes narrowing. An answer surfaced in his mind, but it was shrouded in doubt. He listened as Qingyu Qian continued,

"The only thing that can contend with the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book is another treasure—the Azure Insight Origin Mirror from Mount Dali!"

Li Zhouwei's breath caught. His mind raced as he asked,

"An Immortal Artifact?"

"An Immortal Artifact."

Qingyu Qian closed his eyes slightly, a chill entering his voice.

"This item causes diviners to miscalculate and observers to fail in their observation. It is indescribably precious. Even the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book could not calculate its existence, let alone through the barrier of a grotto-heaven... so it couldn't have been a deliberate plot to bring him to the lake. Nothing was more suitable. Liu Changdie made one trip to the lake, and from then on, his divinatory light vanished, and his chaotic fate was severed. Though he retained his ability to know the future, he had already fallen to a lower path. Not only was his connection to the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book broken, but even the lingering favor upon him disappeared."

"After being observed by so many great powers, his fate had become too 'heavy.' Without the favor to obscure him, he looked like a monster to those with powerful divine abilities. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators couldn't even divine what kind of being he was. It was only from this point on that he became someone whose abnormality could be easily detected by the Purple Mansion Realm. He moved to Jiangnan, and that's when he stumbled into the grand game of Golden Feather and Azure Pond. Xiao Chuting, Chi Buzi, and Zhang Qiushui were likely the first in the Purple Mansion Realm to know."

"After all, in the eyes of the Purple Mansion Realm, being 'incalculable' is, itself, the biggest problem."

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei instantly.

"That's it... That's why our divine abilities can't see the strangeness in Suining, but Liu Changdie was infamous among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators back then!"

Qingyu Qian nodded in acknowledgment, offering a slight apology.

"The timing was wrong that day, so I did not explain in detail to the Great King. In truth, with the Azure Insight Origin Mirror at the Northern Foothills of Mount Dali, I am ignorant of almost everything that happens in the southern half of Moongaze Lake. Besides you, no one in this world knows what truly goes on there!"

"The immortal might of the Azure Insight Origin Mirror is so profound that even the Martial Cultivation Star cannot pass, and the Profound Light does not descend. If any of those Holders of the Profound from the Great Song were to come to Moongaze Lake and stray even slightly south, their cultivation would be immediately beaten down and stripped away!"

His words carried a hint of emotion. Li Zhouwei set down his jade cup.

"So that was the real reason..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, puzzled. He asked again,

"The Azure Insight Origin Mirror belongs to you, senior. How can you not see through it?"

Qingyu Qian was silent for a breath before replying:

"That is a relic left by the Immortal Mansion. Even my lord is forbidden from touching it. We are merely guarded and trapped on this lake by its protection. How could a minor Demon like me ever hope to?"

That one sentence clarified everything.

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze and sipped his wine.

'The 'great person' behind Qingyu Qian is likely someone from the Immortal Mansion, but not a figure at the very top. Perhaps their status is insufficient, or their cultivation isn't high enough. Their control over this Immortal Artifact is limited. They might even be in an compromised state, which is why they are 'trapped' on the lake.'

'The 'great person' Chi Buzi is so obsessed with is probably this one... but which Dao lineage are they from? Heaven–Governing? The Three Yin? Water Mansion?'

He remembered that when Chi Buzi traveled to the Eastern Sea years ago, he had met Li Qinghong. Mistaking her for one of the fox-kin, he had passed on a message, and in it, he had mentioned three names.

'She Immortals, Water Mansion, Yingze... The last two are understandable, but why is there a Sheji Immortal?'

He fell silent, his mind racing, but he finally felt a sense of calm. The thick, ever-present fog of danger that had loomed over him at last receded.

'The words of that Yang entity were not false. It truly does not know the specific situation on the lake. That's why it doesn't know my family actually has four lines of immortal cultivation!'

His heart settled. He remained quiet for a long time, though he didn't fully believe Qingyu Qian's claim of complete ignorance.

'The great powers cannot probe, and the Purple Mansion Realm cannot calculate. But cultivators below Golden Core can still see with their own eyes! Other factions might be afraid of provoking the fox-kin's backer and wouldn't dare send people brazenly. But Qingyu Qian himself cannot be as ignorant as he claims. He must have known something was different at the base of the mountain. That's why he sent Bai Rong out!'

'What could it have been...'

His mind grew clear. His own Immortal Mirror was constantly scanning. Since Qingyu Qian knew a 'great person's' arrangement was down there, he likely wouldn't have come personally. Something abnormal must have alarmed him...

Li Zhouwei thought it through, gradually connecting the pieces.

'The Supreme Yin Profound Light? The wolf Demon from the clan history... or something even earlier?'

As Li Zhouwei sank into thought, Qingyu Qian was observing him. The fox Demon king anxiously fiddled with the jade cup in front of him and continued,

"As for this Li... Suining. His matter is also different. Now that Wanling Heaven has fallen into the Exiled Qi, the Heaven–Governing Rank Designation has shifted. The 'favor' fell directly onto the lake. My lord has some Dao-Profundity in the Heaven–Governing Dao and saw certain omens, which is how we came to understand."

"This junior understands!" Li Zhouwei stood up, clasped his hands in a salute, and said, "Many thanks, Senior!"

Qingyu Qian shook his head with a wry smile.

"I wouldn't dare call myself senior. I simply owed the Great King an explanation."

His expression turned serious.

"The year it was confirmed that the Great King intended to walk the Bright Yang path, the mountain began to consider its options. Then, seeing you bring an invitation from the Dragon-kin, we knew your inclinations lay with the dragons. It just so happened that Dongfang You died. We used 'building relations' as a pretext to send Bai Rong over. Our true intention was to join you in the Bright Yang endeavor!"

"At that time, it was the Dragon Monarch's birth anniversary."

Qingyu Qian's expression was grave.

"The birth anniversary of the Dragon Monarch Beijia. It wasn't just about borrowing his position. It was his birth anniversary, but it was also the birth anniversary of the other eight Dragon Monarchs. More importantly, it was the day the Great Sage fell. The seas were in chaos. Only then did such an opportunity arise."

"The Dragon-kin are faithless and treacherous. Although they agreed, how they would ultimately arrange things was never certain... But at least they produced the Pure Yang Bracelets, which showed their attitude."

'So that's how it was...'

Now that Li Zhouwei understood Qingyu Qian's position, a bit more trust was established. He began to scheme.

'Chi Buzi was possessed so silently. If he wants to ally with my family, he must do so under the guise of allying with the fox-kin. He is at the Chunyi Dao Gate, and his repeated probing has already put him at odds with the Dragon-kin. I must help him.'

He looked up.

"Does the Demon King know... of Chi Buzi?"

Qingyu Qian tensed, immediately adopting a solemn, attentive posture.

"How could I not..."

Li Zhouwei said intently,

"I believe he has intentions of turning to your great person."

Qingyu Qian was momentarily stunned but had little time to think. He seemed to commit the words to memory, nodding heavily.

"I understand!"

Li Zhouwei sensed the underlying meaning and silently lowered his gaze. Qingyu Qian, however, stood up and said softly:

"Suining cultivates... the Divine Sequence?"

Li Zhouwei nodded. He saw a flash of regret on Qingyu Qian's face, who muttered,

"If only it were two hundred years earlier... if only... things would have been much simpler!"

His expression was bitter.

"My fox-kin know of this art. It is from the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence, a treasure of Wanling Heaven. For it to appear now means it has truly emerged into the world. It must have fallen into the Great King's hands at just the right time. That is well... at least it was not lost."

Li Zhouwei's expression didn't change, but his mind stirred. He asked,

"Was it written by a cultivator from Wanling Heaven, or is it an inheritance from ancient cultivators?"

Qingyu Qian smiled.

"A cultivation art like this is naturally not something a Wanling Heaven cultivator could write. It originates from the ancient Encompassing Profoundity Taiyuan Court's 'Heaven-Governing Sequence Classic.' It was likely completed around the time of the Wei dynasty. It is an extremely profound art!"

Li Zhouwei's mind worked fast, seizing the opening. This item didn't come from Wanling Heaven at all; it came from the High Firmament Pavilion! If he could clarify these two points, it would be immensely helpful in determining when the Immortal Mirror was damaged.

His immediate line of inquiry had been blocked, but he wasn't disappointed. 

"Does senior have any insights?"

Qingyu Qian replied, "This art originates from the Taiyuan Court's method of grotto-heaven ascension. However, this is not the original, but rather a technique derived by a later person who observed that ascension method..."

The Demon King smiled, and the white mist around him swirled.

"I see you brought him here today because you wish to trade with me for a method of Great Void construction!"

The 'method of Great Void construction' he spoke of was precisely a method for creating a grotto-heaven mystic realm!

The fox Demon smiled, but his eyes held a complex mix of emotions.

"Trading the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence for it is a perfect exchange. It will complete a missing part of my mountain's Dao lineage!"

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly.

He was not unaware of this matter. Li Ximing had even visited the High Firmament Pavilion to investigate. The price for these grotto-heaven creation methods... the required immortal merits were astonishingly high!

The most expensive one was called 'Liangzhi's Secret Essentials of Heaven and Earth,' and it cost a staggering 1,716,800 immortal merits! You could slaughter the entire Seven Aspects of the Great Zhao seventy or eighty times over and still not have enough to trade for it!

Even the cheapest one, the 'Void-Chamber Refining Art,' required over 1,100 immortal merits, more than five times the cost of the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence. You'd have to wipe out all the Buddhists and devils in Jiangbei to afford it.

Because of this, Li Zhouwei understood the value of a Great Void creation method. He was somewhat stunned to hear the offer and paused before replying:

"That is far too precious."

Qingyu Qian shook his head and sighed.

"Not at all... I only fear the Great King will look down on the method I possess! I did not wish to offer it in shame, but this particular art was passed down by my lord personally and has ties to the Heaven–Governing Dao. That is the only reason I mention it..."

His gaze lowered as he sighed inwardly.

'Is this an exchange... or a repayment? It's hard to tell anymore.'

Li Zhouwei, however, lowered his gaze, his thoughts running deeper.

'This is actually an excellent thing. These Great Void construction methods were all accounted for in ancient times. In the eyes of those great figures, they are clearly mapped to specific Daoist traditions, unlike these latter-day Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivation arts, which are as numerous as the stars...'

'Furthermore, a grotto-heaven must be 'hung' up. It needs to be opened, closed, and communicate with the present world. It would be best to register it under the fox-kin's name. That would add a layer of security...'

Thus, Li Zhouwei did not stand on ceremony.

"My family is in great need of this. We accept our lord's generous gift with thanks!"

Qingyu Qian let out a soft laugh and stood up, smiling.

"I will have someone deliver it at once!"

# Chapter 1095: Avidya (Ignorance)

"Your Highness... We cannot attack the Wei capital."

"My lord... my lord, Grand-uncle Zhouda... he was killed by Wang Quwan... The Western Mountains were breached by Ni Zan... Fifth Grand-uncle has also exhausted his essence and died... That black ape still wants to harm us... My lord... what are we to do..."

Li Suining's mind was heavy and groggy. He awoke from his daze covered in a cold sweat. The room around him was pitch black, the light of a jade lamp flickering fitfully. On the jade table before him, a round tray sat perfectly in place, a jade knife resting beside it. Everything was peaceful and harmonious.

He actually felt a wave of relief.

Everything he had just experienced felt like a nightmare. He had merely dozed off at the table; nothing unusual had happened at all.

But as his dazed gaze shifted, he spotted a man in ink-black robes seated at the other side of the table. The man was majestic and imposing, his bearing utterly transcendent.

His pair of golden pupils were lowered, focused on a profound scroll in his hands. His expression seemed complex.

'King Wei!'

All at once, his memories rushed back. He knew he had been drunk from a single cup of wine until this very moment, and that the Daoist Master had already reached a decision. Overcome with panic, Li Suining leaped from the main seat and dropped to the ground with a thud, his voice full of reverence.

"This junior... pays his respects to Your Majesty..."

"Rise."

Li Zhouwei's voice was surprisingly calm, almost gentle. Li Suining looked up, meeting those golden eyes, and was struck by a powerful, dizzying sense of familiarity.

'In my past life, the last time King Wei rode out for battle... he called us in one by one to give his last instructions. When it was my turn, he spoke to me with this exact same gaze. He said...'

'He said, Suining, if Zhouming falls, you are to inherit the orthodoxy. As for your own successor... you will decide.'

A sudden peace settled over Li Suining's heart. He kowtowed twice, listening as Li Zhouwei spoke.

"You have suffered."

That single sentence brought tears streaming down his face. He looked up, his voice thick.

"Your Highness... I!"

He had barely begun to speak when a divine ability sealed his mouth, leaving him tongue-tied. Li Zhouwei watched him softly, patting his shoulder.

"Do not overthink things. I know you've had a fortunate encounter. From this day on, you may leave this mountain, but you are forbidden from leaving Moongaze Lake. When I have made my preparations, I will arrange a path for you. For any matter that requires a decision, I will meet you in secret."

He paused, a flicker of hesitation in his eyes.

"As for... Grand-uncle..."

Li Zhouwei considered his words.

"There is no need to tell him anything. He is not like me. He... cannot bear it."

In an instant, Li Suining understood. The King's first concern was identical to his own upon his rebirth. This King Wei... he had been making preparations to protect Daoist Master Zhaojing long, long ago.

'I'm afraid it's not just me. The other major powers nearby must also understand... They're desperate for the Li clan to grow stronger, just so King Wei won't be left all alone. Even if it only makes him hesitate for a moment... or concede a single step... they would see it as a victory.'

Li Suining nodded, whimpering. He looked up at Li Zhouwei, whose golden eyes burned bright. The King's lips parted, as if to ask a question, but in the end, he said nothing on that matter.

"I must make a trip north."

Li Suining quickly wiped his tears away.

"Your Highness! If my knowledge is correct, this trip should be free of great disaster. However, the Touba family possesses a monstrous demonic dao that brings ruin to the soul. I implore you and the other lord to be careful!"

"The soul?"

Li Zhouwei seemed entirely unafraid. He just chuckled, shook his head, and stepped forward. Treading on the Heavenly Light, he passed through the Great Void and vanished into the deep, infinite darkness.

The moment he was swallowed by the all-consuming shadows, the smile vanished from his face. The gentleness in his eyes evaporated, replaced by a savage, beast-like viciousness. A cold sneer, sharp as ice, touched his lips.

'Wang Quwan? A 'good' Wang Quwan, indeed.'

...

The world was heavy and dim, shrouded in mist and swirling clouds.

The grayish-white Profound Banner of the White Ye Immortal Sect snapped and fluttered in the wind. Faintly visible on its surface, the character for "Zhao" seemed to have shrunk, appearing ghostly and indistinct. Beneath the banner, a youth in blue robes sat on the steps, a jade pot in hand and a smile on his face.

Helian Wumeng stood encased in shining silver heavy armor, wreathed in a brilliant profound light. He resembled a crouching behemoth, his face obscured. His voice was like the clang of metal on stone.

"Senior Bai, what is the situation?"

In the distance, the Wilderness lay submerged in darkness. This place, once the "Hongxue Treasure Shore" of the Hongxue Sect, had been plundered and fought over relentlessly since that sect's annihilation. It was now a land scarred and broken. Yehui's gaze retracted, falling back to the scroll in his hand.

It was a letter from Qi Lanyan, stating that negotiations on the Great Western Plateau were complete.

Yehui gave an unreadable smile.

"The White Victory Dao Lord's demonic body has already left the mountains. His demon body is heading south from the Ruwu Strategic Pass to strike Qize from the flank. The Western Shu... they cannot move, and they do not wish to."

Helian Wumeng's expression was peculiar.

"I have long heard of his reputation. This will be a good chance to see what's so special about him, that Lord Wei would call him a confidant and allow the White Victory Dao to rise so abruptly. Everyone thinks the Western Shu are just putting on a show, but if we're not careful, we could truly suffer for it."

Yehui rolled up the scroll and rose to his feet. He watched Helian Wujiang stroll out of the Great Void and laughed.

"You two again, uncle and nephew. Your task is to stop the southern reinforcements, so they send you to wade into wherever the fighting is thickest. It can't be a pleasant feeling, can it?"

From the perspective of their southern advance, the entire riverbank had only three entry points. The easiest was Moongaze Lake. The one with the largest concentration of divine abilities was Profound Peak. And the most dangerous... was the Wilderness.

After all, everyone was guessing that Yang Ruiyi was on the mountain. But the man was infuriatingly elusive. What if they were wrong? If he was still lying in wait in the Wilderness, the vanguard would be in mortal peril.

It was precisely this fear of Yang Ruiyi's schemes that had Tangdao Mountain completely surrounded. Qi Lanyan's main force was still focused on advancing south from Profound Peak, terrified that Yang Ruiyi was pulling a feint. What if he made a desperate gamble, sacrificing Tangdao Mountain to secure Profound Peak? Profound Peak was their key to suppressing the Great Song. Even if all of Jiangbei were lost, Profound Peak could not fall.

Helian Wujiang seemed to know Yehui well enough not to take offense. He just mused,

"We appreciate Daoist Friend's concern. My Dao relies on cultivating Baleful Qi, which gives us considerable resistance to both 'True Qi' and 'Exiled Qi'. Our deployment here is only natural."

Helian Wumeng remained silent, his grip on his weapon simply tightening.
Yehui stood with his hands clasped behind his back.

"My Capital Guard Dao specializes in Spirit-Summoning and mountain governance. In ancient times, no cultivator would establish a Dao lineage without first consulting the Capital Guard. Years ago, when I visited the Profound Governance group, Lord Wei mentioned Moongaze Lake. I told him that the lake sits between north and south; it is a 'Living Attribute'. If its master can hold it, it will be a great boon for their ascension. If not, outside evil will bleed in, causing internal chaos. It would inevitably become another Golden Tang Gate."

He turned his gaze to the Helian duo.

"And your family's home in Hetao... in my opinion, it's in an even more wretched position than Moongaze Lake. You have a local Dharma Realm to your front and the Touba at your back. You're flanked by ambition and elbowed by the 'Profound Chen'. In my Capital Guard Dao, we call such a place a 'Death Attribute'. A person of virtue would not occupy that mountain, nor build a foundation in such a land."

Helian Wujiang remained perfectly calm, his expression natural, even thoughtful. He skillfully changed the subject.

"Oh? Then it seems Daoist Friend was quite meticulous in establishing your own Dao lineage in Baiye Creek."

Yehui knew this was a barb, mocking how his own Dao lineage was now exposed to the south's blade. He gave a dry laugh.

"Of course. I occupy land from which I can advance or retreat. In all of the northern and southern Sanjiang, only two such places exist. One is Chengyun. The other... is my Baiye."

Helian Wujiang stared at him, his voice flat.

"Daoist Friend, you use the lives of your entire Dao lineage as capital for your own path to attaining the Dao. Naturally, the world is vast, and you can place your pieces anywhere. But my clan is in Mobei. My ancestral foundation is there. I have no cause to simply abandon it."

Yehui's eyebrow twitched, his tone a mix of mockery and warning.

"Unwilling to part with that meager foundation? You'd rather they be used as chess pieces, generation after generation? Is that what you find so comforting? On this point, you and your nephew are far less insightful than Li Zhouwei. The ability to use one's Dao lineage as capital is not just a sacrificeit's a privilege. One that most people could only dream of!"

Helian Wumeng, unfamiliar with Yehui, bristled at the words. His hand on his weapon clenched and unclenched. Fortunately, a brilliant white light finally flared in the south, making his eyes light up.

"The south is breaking!"

He slammed his weapon into the ground and shot into the air, transforming into a heaven-and-earth-spanning gale of baleful wind that surged forward.

"Boom!"

In an instant, countless baleful peaks rose like a vast, dark ink-wash painting unrolling across the land of Baiye. A swirling, pitch-black Baleful Qi descended, sweeping over everything.

From the south, an enormous, multicolored light streaked across the sky to meet it. It rippled like a dazzling waterfall, kicking up a furious wind that slammed against the incoming divine ability.

"Boom!"

The multicolored light floated upward as an earthy, Wu-colored light descended. An old man materialized in the center, dressed in glazed kudzu robes. His gaze was serene, and he held a small jade mountain. His voice boomed like thunder,

"Foreign savages, how dare you act so presumptuously!"

It was Daoist Master Xianyao.

As his voice echoed, a gleaming, multicolored light shot from him.

"Subjugating Crest!"

It was an Wu Earth divine ability.

The brilliant light solidified, descending as a mountain of immortal radiance. Helian Wumeng looked up, his expression shifting. Hidden beneath his heavy helm, his eyes now glowed with an eerie, grayish-silver light.

"Clang!"

Subjugating Crest was no simple technique. It was designed to suppress the Immortal Dao. While it posed little threat to Buddhist cultivators or demon cultivators, anyone hit by it, even those of a higher cultivation, would be slammed into the ground.

Although Helian Wumeng cultivated a demonic dao, it wasn't a pure one. It wasn't an inheritance from the four demon ancestors, but was rooted in the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao. This meant he was still subject to the technique's restraints. Fortunately, he cultivated a Diverse Mansion, and his Baleful Qi was far less affected. He summoned a Spiritual Treasure and was only slammed to the ground, immobilized. The profound light erupting from his body flared like a bonfire, showing no sign of retreat. He parted his lips, his voice savage and venomous.

"You old waste, your path to the Dao is severed! A beggar from the Eastern Sea... You dare to stand here and bark?"

Daoist Master Xianyao's expression didn't change at the "severed Dao path" insult, but the moment "old beggar" left the man's lips, the elder's face darkened.

"Such insolence! My Lian clan descends from the great families of Guanzhong! When I first ascended with my divine ability and was crowned king, your Helian clan were still slaves to others..."

Before he could finish, a wisp of white qi drifted down and intercepted him. Yehui appeared, treading on a current of purple water. He sighed.

"Senior... my apologies."

With his sigh, a crushing weight of white qi streamed from his lips, coalescing into a massive, gleaming white mountain. Its appearance caused the Great Void to solidify, and all divine abilities in the area became sluggish, as if trapped in a mire.

Daoist Master Xianyao's lips pressed shut. He brought his hands together, held them to his mouth, and... also spat out a stream of white qi.

The instant his qi emerged, a second mountain rumbled into existence from the Great Void. The two peaks collided. White qi billowed like an avalanche, a spectacular, world-ending waterfall of power.

It was also Eastern Feather Mountain!

This Daoist Master Xianyao... he had actually cultivated a Capital Guard art to complete his Dao lineage!

At this sight, both Helian uncle and nephew stared, stunned. A strange look even crossed Helian Wujiang's face.

'What a crafty old fox, Xianyao. Did someone guide him... or was this truly just a wild gamble?'

Only Yehui was unsurprised.

Daoist Master Xianyao's situation was really no better than Changxi's. He had relied on Subjugating Crest to attain the Dao, true, but he had no other Dao lineage to speak of. After finally acquiring that copy of Immortal Without Flaw from Cheng Yan, he had hit a wall and could advance no further.

But the old man was decisive. Estimating he lacked the years to cross into the Purple Mystery realm, he had begun planning early, seeking a substitute path to ensure his survival. In the end, he had come to Yehui... and had taken Eastern Feather Mountain.

The two had a history, but Yehui showed no hesitation now that they were enemies. His form vanished. He reappeared behind the old man, weaving through the cascading waterfall of white qi, his brows suddenly raised.

A scorching light flared in his eyes. A mysterious radiance shot out, slamming into the back of the old man's head.

He was the one who had given him Eastern Feather Mountain; he naturally knew the critical flaw in his cultivation!

Daoist Master Xianyao's face fell. With a sharp gesture, he summoned his personal Spiritual Artifact. The jade mountain in his hand instantly magnified.

"Hanging Pass Mountain!"

The two enormous mountains of divine ability collided. Helian Wujiang's figure drifted over like a willow seed on the wind. But as he approached, a heavy, gray halo flashed. An old man rode a current of Water Mansion qi, a glacial-blue blade aimed straight at his face.

'Chen Yin of Yushui...'

Helian Wujiang's heart sank.

It wasn't that he was terrified of the man, but the news of Chen Yin being tricked by the Western Shu had spread far and wide. The little old man was now desperately reliant on the Song court. If Helian Wujiang were Yang Ruiyi, he would absolutely use this 'fine steel' at the most critical moment.

Chen Yin's presence here meant the Song's resolve was strong.

Helian Wujiang, ever-cautious, didn't dare relax. He slapped his waist. A whip, a saber, and a sword leaped out, kicking up a boundless, baleful wind.

Though Helian Wujiang had been overshadowed by Li Zhouwei in the Grotto-Heaven, he was a true powerhouse against someone like Chen Yin. His whip lashed out, binding Chen Yin's sword. His short saber darted like a phantom, while his longsword hovered in his palm, ever vigilant.

With both mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm masters engaged, Helian Wumeng stood alone amidst the roiling Baleful Qi, a cold smile playing on his lips.

Facing him were three streaks of multicolored light, each wreathed in water and fire.

The man on the left was powerfully built, his gaze like that of a dragon. He wore blue-purple martial armor, a resplendent golden sword at his waist, his face a little pale. The one in the center wore blue and white robes, his features fine and handsome, his glabella marked with a blue-purple and purple-gold sigil. The one on the right, in white and purple robes and a black cloud-patterned cloak, seemed at ease, holding a profound sword at the ready, his eyes wary.

Helian Wumeng's grayish-silver eyes reflected those three pairs of golden pupils. He burst into wild laughter, a sound so powerful it shook the entire sea of Baleful Qi.

"Interesting, this Song court!" the young man boomed. "They actually delivered all three of their 'qilin sons' right into my hands!"

His voice and his figure dissolved into the baleful sea.

"Let's see just what this Holder of the Profound rank is made of!"

Li Jiangliang's brow flashed. He snapped his profound sword up just as the demonic man materialized before him. A long-handled pole-blade, half-saber, half-spear, blazed with black light as it chopped down on his sword.

"Boom!"

The water and fire cloaking Li Jiangliang exploded. He was knocked back three steps in mid-air, his expression darkening.

"He's strong!"

Helian Wumeng was built like a tiger but moved like a viper. He spun in the air, and his pole-blade, which had vanished, suddenly leaped up from below, thrusting viciously at Li Jiangliang's throat.

Li Jiangliang felt his skin crawl, a deathly chill flooding his mind. The purple sigil on his brow flared, and his body shattered with a bang, trying to dissolve into roiling water and fire.

But Helian Wumeng was a hardened veteran. His eyes had already turned blood-red. A dense beam of baleful light shot from them, aimed straight at Li Jiangliang's face. Simultaneously, a strange pulse of energy rippled from him, causing Li Jiangliang's water-and-fire transformation to stutter, slowing him by a fatal instant.

"Boom!"

Fortunately, Li Jiangxia arrived. The water and fire in his hands flowed and solidified into a spear. It pulsed in the midst of the Baleful Qi, neutralizing the attack as it thrust toward Helian Wumeng's throat.

Helian Wumeng ignored it, even sparing a moment to glance back, his eyes full of contempt.

'Plenty of weapon skill... but not enough divine ability. He hasn't even healed from his last fight, and he dares to challenge me?'

The spear plunged forward unopposed, but it felt like stabbing a cloud of Baleful Qi. It passed straight through his throat, leaving no wound, striking only an illusion.

Thousand-Hundred Body!

Li Jiangliang grunted, retreating as a blast of water and fire.

Helian Wumeng's ape-like arm snapped back, his pole-blade reversing to slash down at Li Jiangxia. The Spiritual Artifact hadn't even arrived, but the Baleful Qi struck first, crashing down like a mountain peak.

From within his baleful eyes, a blur of golden light shot out, pinning Li Jiangxia in place. Unable to dodge, he took the full force of the blow. He was sent flying like an arrow, slamming into the ground with a sickening thud.

'Light of Great Peace and Pacification!'

But that brief delay was all Li Jianglong needed. The radiance he had drawn down from the stars finally struck Helian Wumeng's back.

Though the three were only at the Holder of the Profound rank, the light they channeled through their Martial Cultivation was anything but simple. Helian Wumeng was frozen in place. An instant later, a thick, multi-hued aura of water and fire exploded from his body. This caused Li Jianglong to turn deathly pale, as if bound by the attack. He, too, was frozen, unable to move, his aura fading at an alarming rate.

On the ground, Li Jiangxia shot back up as a streak of white light. A golden seal hovered over his head, and he appeared to be completely unharmed. With a flick of his wrist, a golden chain materialized, snaking out and binding the demon.

"Fourth Brother!" he shouted.

The three brothers knew they would be charging north into battle. How could they have come unprepared? They had not only requisitioned Spiritual Artifacts from the Song Emperor but had also specially chosen spell arts to cultivate, all for this very moment.

Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia were famously at odds, but in a life-or-death battle, they coordinated faster than anyone. There wasn't a trace of suspicion between them; their synergy was so perfect it stunned Li Jiangliang, leaving him momentarily flustered.

He had no time to be surprised. He shut his eyes, and the sigil on his brow darkened, pulsing with power. A speck of light leaped forth.

It was a brilliant gold and a vibrant purple. At times it flickered like fire, at others it flowed like water. It lit up the battlefield, the gold as profound as sacred classics, the purple like the chant of a thousand cultivators under a rain of immortal light. It seemed slow, but it was impossibly fast, landing squarely on Helian Wumeng.

This was the true trump card they had requested for their mission: Lightless Water and Fire!

"Boom!"

A blinding immortal radiance tore into the sky. The entire baleful sea heaved, and plumes of black smoke choked the air. The caster, Li Jianglong, was thrown back three steps. The thread-thin beam of white light that bound the combatants snapped. He began to cough, vomiting blood, unable to even stand.

The golden chain shattered. A terrifying beam of white light swept across the sky, blasting Li Jianglong so hard he spat up more blood and nearly fell from the sky. Li Jiangliang used the light to teleport again. Li Jiangxia, at the center of the storm, was unaffected by the blast, but eighteen azure-glass pearls had suddenly appeared above his head, locking him in place.

Azureglass Stars of the Western General!

Helian Wumeng had clearly risked himself to lure them into this trap. He just hadn't counted on them possessing such a powerful treasure.

But the man's willpower was iron, his control over his divine abilities unshakable. Even as the spiritual fire consumed him, he used his Spiritual Artifact with the stability of a mountain. He had not only trapped Li Jiangxia, but from within the raging flames, a human figure was already stepping out.

Helian Wumeng's left arm and most of the left side of his body were engulfed in the Lightless Water and Fire. Spiritual flames licked out from within his body; his true form was clearly injured. Yet, he showed little reaction, standing in mid-air with an expression of pure surprise.

"The Great Void..."

In his senses, his connection to the Great Void, which had been ever-present, was severed completely.

The Lightless Water and Fire had also affected the Great Void. It wasn't like the Immeasurable Water and Fire, which cut it off entirely. Instead, it had singled him out, Helian Wumeng, and caused the Great Void to reject him.

This meant that until he extinguished the spiritual fire, he would lose access to all the profound mysteries of the Great Void. His three opponents, however, could still enter and exit it at will, effortlessly dodging his attacks. If the tide turned, he might not even be able to escape.

This should have been a disastrous turn of events. But the profound-armored warrior wasn't alarmed. Instead, his interest was piqued.

"Good!" he roared.

With his shout, the endless baleful sea surged anew. Mountain peaks rose from the darkness. His grim voice echoed across the land.

"Now, you will see what I am truly capable of!"

'...This...'

The white light from the sky faded. Li Jiangliang, who had been knocked tumbling ten steps away, was wreathed in baleful light, his face as white as paper. Reflected in his pupils was the demonic pole-blade, carrying with it an overwhelming tide of Baleful Qi... and a pair of demonic eyes.

The man had predicted his exact landing spot.

A spike of pure terror lanced through Li Jiangliang, and he broke out in a cold sweat.

Though he rarely left the palace, he wasn't inexperienced. He had fought the Merciful One and even crossed blades with Kong Tingyun. But the pressure from this man... it wasn't even in the same league.

'No wonder. Father, in all his nobility, broke through from the Eastern Sea and fought this man on the northern bank, but failed to capture him. He truly is a demon.'

'This... this is a true genius of the northern Daoist Traditions.'

# Chapter 1096: Azure Cliff

The pole-scythe, dripping with demonic qi, pierced through the air. In that split second, Li Jiangliang’s thoughts raced. He leveled a profound sword with one hand while pressing two fingers of his other hand against the flat of the blade, lifting it upward. Darkness surged behind him as the Great Void materialized.

"Boom!"

A wave of deep black Baleful Qi instantly billowed outward. The profound sword was of high quality, but it bent into a sharp arc under the force of the scythe. The impact sent a shock through their mental connection, and Li Jiangliang’s face paled. He used the momentum to take a single step back, falling into the Great Void.

But at that exact moment, the pole-scythe shot forward, its short hilt twisting and hooking down, instantly locking onto the profound sword.

"Clang!"

Li Jiangliang’s figure vanished, but the profound sword remained, trapped within the Baleful Qi. Helian Wumeng showed no sign of triumph, merely narrowing his eyes.

"Oh?"

Amidst the roiling Baleful Qi, the trapped sword suddenly resonated with the light in the heavens, dissolved into mist, and vanished without a trace.

Helian Wumeng’s figure disappeared at the same time.

Down below, under the light of the Azureglass Stars of the Western General, Li Jiangxia’s expression turned grim. He formed a hand seal, and the golden seal above his head erupted in blinding light. In the next instant, a mountain of Baleful Qi smashed down, accompanied by the roar of a thousand blade-lights.

"Boom!"

The white light from the sky cascaded down again. Helian Wumeng didn't even turn his head, but a new face suddenly appeared on the back of his skull. Its pupils were blood-red, its expression a savage grin. A crimson demonic light flashed from its eyes, erupting in the distance as a terrifying storm of Baleful Qi that blasted Li Jianglong out of the air as he tried to provide support.

The Azureglass Stars of the Western General unleashed myriad rays of light, descending with the storm of Baleful Qi blades, instantly drowning the faint golden glow from the seal.

The golden seal in Li Jiangxia’s hand was no simple item. It was a treasure from the Song Imperial Court known as the Vanquishing True Golden Seal, capable of resonating with the stars to neutralize hostile powers. With this treasure, an ordinary early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would never be able to defeat him so quickly.

But the power of the Supreme Yin, channeled through the Azureglass Stars of the Western General, was incredibly profound. It seemed to be relentlessly converting the ambient True Qi into a foreign, corrosive light, pressing deeper and deeper. Meanwhile, the Baleful Qi continued to pour down. After little more than a dozen breaths, the golden light began to flicker violently.

Li Jiangxia’s expression darkened.

'To counter me so effectively and so quickly… This man’s Dao-Profundity is definitely not to be underestimated!'

Despite being burned by the Lightless Water and Fire, Helian Wumeng showed no sign of weakness. Two more arms sprouted from beneath his armpits. One formed a hand seal, the other held a small bell. Coordinated with the blood-red face on the back of his head, he was now suppressing the other two cultivators all by himself.

Unfortunately, neither Li Jiangliang nor Li Jianglong possessed a Vanquishing True Golden Seal. The moment they were locked down by the Azureglass Stars of the Western General, their lives would be in immediate danger. They didn't even dare to leave the safety of the Great Void for long.

The three of them were Holders of the Profound. They should have been able to suppress an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Given that their ambush with the Lightless Water and Fire had succeeded, they should have been able to stall even a mid-stage expert. Instead, Helian Wumeng was single-handedly suppressing all three of them.

Li Jiangxia was not the only one in peril. The crisis was escalating so rapidly that even Xianyao turned his gaze, his face heavy with apprehension.

'The Helian family’s legacy…'

But there was one person present whose expression was fouler than anyone's.

It was Helian Wujiang.

The man’s face was cold and dark. He was steadily gaining the upper hand against Chen Yin, but his attention was almost entirely fixed on the Purple Mansion Realm junior from his own clan. He shot a worried glance at Helian Wumeng as his mind raced.

'Holders of the Profound… they really are something else. The Merciful One can't compare. One is a new Holder, and the other two are just temporarily borrowing its power, and with just a few treasures, they can actually hold Wumeng back!'

Helian Wujiang knew better than anyone what state Helian Wumeng was in.

The Iron Edict Elixir had been refined by their own ancestor, Helian Fan. From the time the Helian family first followed the Qi Emperor to the present day, with the Tiefu Kingdom now a vassal of the Zhao, Helian Fan was, without a doubt, the greatest prodigy their family had ever produced.

This prodigy had cultivated the Whole Pill, obtained an ancient Daoist tradition, and excelled at artifact refinement. He became renowned throughout the world for his demonic Baleful Treasured Artifacts, even going so far as to establish his own kingdom. The Iron Edict Elixir was the crystallization of his life’s work. Helian Wumeng had consumed it. And although the Ying-Copper Armor of Great Xia he wore was far from being fully refined—he was barely wearing the outer shell—his power was already terrifying. Even Helian Wujiang himself wasn't confident he could win a certain victory against him.

But what worried him even more was the other spiritual item in play.

'Lightless Water and Fire!'

A golden and vibrant purple halo had appeared, and Helian Wujiang had been the first to spot it.

His Helian family cultivated Baleful Qi, but they also had a deep understanding of True Qi. This particular path involved the mastery of water and fire. At its absolute peak, there was only one power, born from the Martial Truth Qi Malignance Essence. It was called the Tianwu True-Nature Divine Flame. Its might was in no way inferior to the five waters and five fires birthed from the Great Void itself.

This was an existence of an extremely high order.

In primordial times, the Heavenly Dao, through moral resonance, had given birth to five primordial waters and five primordial fires. Each one possessed a unique marvel on par with an immortal object. The Yuwu bird had obtained just one of them, and the mere mention of it made immortals pale. For True Qi to possess such a capability was astoundingly powerful.

The water and fire of True Qi existed in the realm between yin and yang. Where yin and yang are not manifest, water and fire are harmed. Thus, beneath the level of a True Monarch or a Golden Core's elemental fire, the path was vast and empty. There existed only six fires: Impermanence, Lightless, Measureless, Ungraspable, Boundless, and Limitless.

Each of these six fires was an incredibly dangerous spiritual item. In the hands of a Great Daoist Master of True Qi, any one of them could shake the heavens and the earth.

'These three Holders of the Profound may not be top-tier experts, but they _are_ Holders. They can resonate with the Martial Cultivation Star. Even if they can only draw on fifty or sixty percent of its power... if Yang Ruiyi shows up, Wumeng will be in mortal danger!'

Helian Wujiang had relied on his own skill to preserve the Tiefu Kingdom's sovereignty among the tribes of Monan. He was no fool, and he trusted his intuition completely.

'We didn't come here just to stand guard. If we don't lure the people from the Wilderness out... force their hand... how will we ever grasp the true situation? Who knows who else is lying in wait inside the Great Void... We can't wait any longer!'

Throwing all caution to the wind, he thrust his Dharma sword forward, gritted his teeth, and roared,

"Murong Yan!"

Helian Wumeng was treading on a mountain of Baleful Qi, watching as Li Jiangxia was about to collapse under his assault. Suddenly, an intense premonition of danger seized him. His head snapped up, his expression changing.

The fabric of the Great Void rippled and tore open. A glistening white sword descended.

The sword was three chi and seven cun long, with six faces, each intricately carved with beast-mask cloud patterns. It flowed with an incomparably condensed Jade True radiance and a dazzling True Qi, and it was held in the hand of a sword cultivator.

Daoist Master Zhusheng—Liu Bai!

Liu Bai was an immensely famous sword cultivator from an extraordinary Dao lineage. Empowered by his mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivation in both Jade True and True Qi, the moment his sword appeared, the air filled with boundless killing intent.

Helian Wumeng, caught completely off guard, had a sudden, horrifying realization.

'That Lightless Water and Fire… it was blocking my perception of the Great Void! This was their real objective!'

But there was no time to think. The sword was already upon him.

"Clang!"

The dense Jade True light slammed into the divine, profound armor, releasing a world-shaking hum. The sword light was fluid and unrestrained, not striking directly but flowing like water, probing and entering from every angle. It passed through Helian Wumeng’s body, erupting in countless sparks of baleful light.

At that same instant, a deep grey radiance appeared. Murong Yan’s massive form emerged, a power radiating from him that turned the world grey and white. But a beam of white light arrived even faster, spinning through the air before stopping in front of him and transforming into a small, exquisite purple pavilion that seemed to span the horizon.

A woman with a calm, dignified bearing stood upon it, her hands forming a seal.

It was Tinglan.

The appearance of her and Liu Bai stunned the remaining combatants. Even Murong Yan froze for a second.

'Tinglan? Liu Bai? Then… who’s guarding Profound Peak? Does Yang Ruiyi think Gongsun Bei and Qi Lanyan are dead?!'

A shriek that threatened to pierce their eardrums ripped across the sky. Helian Wujiang’s eyes looked ready to split from rage as his Dharma sword shot forward at terrifying speed.

'Wumeng!'

The sword cultivator, however, did not pause for a fraction of a second. Liu Bai's robes billowed as his longsword merged with the flow of his power, flashing with six distinct lusters, resonating with his divine ability, and answering the call of the world.

'Green Jade Cliff!'

In that moment, Liu Bai and Helian Wumeng seemed to vanish from the world, falling into a separate dimension. A pale, azure-white light pooled beneath them, lifting them into the boundless white clouds of the heavens. Countless streams of sword light instantly merged into one and slashed down.

The Pacifying Baleful Uniting Jade Sword Art!

To be immobilized by a divine ability and struck at point-blank range by a Jade True sword cultivator comparable to a Great Daoist Master... how could one possibly survive?

"Voom!"

The armor on Helian Wumeng’s body let out a sharp, mournful cry. Battered by the Jade True marvel, it was instantly blasted from his body. Helian Wumeng, dressed in black with gray-silver eyes, was left completely exposed to the blade.

Before Helian Wujiang’s bloodshot eyes, Helian Wumeng’s limbs were shorn from his body, dissolving into thick Baleful Qi in the roiling Jade True sword light. The white blade, not yet finished, consolidated and stabbed straight at his glabella.

Though Helian Wumeng was suppressed by the Azure Jade Cliff, his Baleful Qi divine abilities instinctively activated to protect him. His power converged, but it shattered continuously under the white blade, letting out a piercing wail.

Just then, Helian Wumeng finally broke free from the technique's influence. As his eyes opened, they instantly exploded into a mist of blood under the sword light. Dark blood streamed down his face. The flesh between his brows split apart, and a single pill shot out.

The pill was the size of a fingertip, pure silver-white, like condensed mercury. Dazzling red sand and shimmering silver light flickered within its intricate patterns, shifting endlessly.

The Helian family’s secret treasure: the Iron Edict Elixir!

The roiling Jade True light seemed to hit a wall, scattering in all directions. An extremely condensed, multicolored light of the Whole Pill erupted from the elixir, pouring down and enveloping Helian Wumeng. Before their very eyes, the man’s body dissolved into a wisp of Valley Water and scattered like smoke.

He had actually escaped the Azure Jade Cliff.

This sudden turn of events was completely beyond Liu Bai's expectations. He forcefully altered his sword technique, redirecting it toward the dissipating Valley Water. But Helian Wujiang’s Dharma sword arrived just in time, blocking his path.

"Boom!"

A clap of thunder shook the heavens. Murong Yan had no time for words. His eyes swept the night sky, and just as he'd feared, that bastard Yehui was nowhere to be seen. He cursed inwardly and roared,

"Go!"

Faster than his shout, a torrent of blood-red Baleful Qi and a beam of pure white Jade True dharma power shot across the sky, one in front, one behind, in hot pursuit.

---

Amidst the flashing streams of light, Li Jiangliang reappeared, his brow furrowed with anxiety. He then heard Li Jianglong’s calm voice in his ear.

"He's fine."

Sure enough, a moment later, the man within the dense Baleful Qi—Li Jiangxia—coughed up some blood. He emerged, riding the residual waves of water and fire. He looked at his two brothers and grinned.

"Let's go!"

The three brothers exchanged a look. Without a single word, they rode the wind up to Tinglan’s Purple Qi pavilion. Below them, their army was already crossing the river, a relentless tide surging over the land.

Li Jiangliang, not even pausing to catch his breath, stepped forward and looked at Tinglan.

"Senior! What now...?"

Tinglan nodded to them, her expression slightly odd.

"We bypass the White Ye Immortal Sect, defend Baixiang while attacking Bianyan, and relieve the Tangdao."

...

_Drip_

Deep shadows flickered in the hall. A man in Daoist robes hurried up the steps. Seeing the main hall door ajar, he quickly bowed.

"Reporting!"

He could faintly hear the voices of the Daoist Masters inside.

"Jiexing... is it true the Old Sir doesn't have the Flawless Deficient Yin?"

"Well... this..."

"Your family has a long and noble legacy. An ancestor of yours once cultivated at the Unmoving Temple... I have always held your family in high esteem. If you would be willing to trade it to me... you can name any condition you wish!"

Although two Purple Mansion Realm experts were in discussion, the situation was urgent. The Daoist-robed man couldn't worry about etiquette. He dropped to his knees with a thud, his voice full of joy.

"Master! Great news! The Song forces have crossed the river from the Wilderness, just as predicted! They’ve bypassed Baiku, Baiye, and Panglu Ridge... they're heading straight for Chengshui Marsh!"

His voice rang out in the quiet courtyard. The door swung fully open, revealing a small table in the inner courtyard. Two figures, both appearing as youths, were seated at it, a game board between them.

The one on the left was Qi Lanyan.

The Daoist from Profound Governance, the man pulling the strings in Jiangbei, smiled faintly.

"Daoist Friend Tao, this is my new disciple, Fan Kang."

His opponent was none other than the young Daoist Master from the Tao family, the one with the uncanny eyes, Tao Jiexing, who had been brought here by Li Jieyi. Qi Lanyan had clearly invited him for a reason.

Hearing Qi Lanyan's words, Tao Jiexing looked immensely relieved. He nodded quickly.

"Since they've crossed the river, I... I'll go at once!"

Qi Lanyan looked slightly disappointed but could only let him leave. He sighed, listening as his disciple gave an energetic report on the events in the west. He nodded.

"It was Liu Bai, as expected. It seems Yang Ruiyi is personally leading the assault on Shanji, so they're rushing to reinforce Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain."

He raised his teacup, glancing with one eyebrow arched at Fan Kang, who was still kneeling.

"They crossed. So what? Let them go a little deeper. What's the rush?"

The Daoist-robed man sighed, his heart heavy.

"That time... the siege on the lake against Wei... against _him_. Disciple saw firsthand how difficult it is to change the world's destiny. How can I not be anxious, Master...?"

Qi Lanyan set down his cup. 

"Yehui's methods are superb," he said coolly. "Leave this to him. Has there been any disturbance at all along the Capital immortals Dao?"

"As for Li Zhouwei."

Qi Lanyan paused.

"Everything is proceeding for the better. The only difference in the world's situation is that Li Zhouwei's injuries are far more severe. Although that allowed Li Ximing to cultivate the World's Radiance... that man is a nobody. He's just coasting on Li Zhouwei's reputation and managed to get that Merging Fire. Send someone with a spiritual water treasure to collect his flame. Any early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator can handle him."

"This time, Yang Ruiyi cannot allow Li Zhouwei to stay on the sidelines. He will definitely follow Liu Bai and the others, just like last time. If we play this right, we can delay him for another five or six years without altering the grand scheme."

Fan Kang was silent for a long time, his mind clearly elsewhere. His voice was choked with emotion when he finally spoke.

"Disciple... Disciple just doesn't understand..."

"Back then, during the siege on the lake, Master said it was a trivial matter and not to report it to Lord Wei. As a result, we couldn't dispatch Murong Yan or Gao Fangjing. And now... now... Master still doesn't plan to consult Lord Wei!"

The Daoist-robed man began to weep.

"Disciple is thinking only of you and him... Why... Why is Lord Wei completely unconcerned with any of this?"

Qi Lanyan had listened to the first part in silence. But that last sentence made his expression change dramatically. His eyes turned ice-cold.

"What does a whelp like you know!" he snapped. "Lord Wei is seeking the Dao and on the Quest for Gold! How could he possibly concern himself with such sordid affairs? If something went wrong, who would bear the responsibility?"

"Besides... Besides!"

Qi Lanyan seemed to deflate, his expression darkening as a murderous intent flickered in his heart.

'Xu Che fears the Celestial Gate; slacking, he fails to become a Woven Jade Immortal. Zitong seeks to spread the Dao; arrogant, he dies before the throne... A person on the Quest for Gold can never trust another’s word on whether they will achieve the Dao... If I let you spread this, killing you a hundred, even a thousand times over wouldn't be enough!'

'What Heavenly Element... what Great Divination... they are all false prophecies! My death would be nothing. But Martial Uncle... he is such a genius, with such ambition and such virtue! If he cannot ascend to that position... what path is left for any cultivator in this world?'

# Chapter 1097: The Crimson Desert

Tao Jiexing rode the wind from Xuanmiao Temple, his heart heavy with an indescribable burden.

'From the look of him, Lord Wei has failed to cultivate it.'

Though Tao Jiexing was new to the world, he had achieved the Dao at a young age and was exceptionally clever. He had been lured out by Qi Lanyan on borrowed time two months ago and still hadn't been able to return. He already had his suspicions, and that single sentence confirmed them, leaving him somewhat dazed.

'Failure to cultivate... failure to cultivate _is_ success.'

The Tao family had deep ties to Profound Governance and was, in ancient times, a great clan that practiced the Three Yin. When his great-grandfather had cultivated the Dao and achieved the Unblemished Robe, it was a glorious affair that drew cultivators from half of Zhao State to offer congratulations.

And yet, when the old man returned to the family in private... he was lost and despondent, weeping without end.

'The old man said... the Veiled Yin was purged by the Lesser Yang, condemned as demonic disciples. Now those same powers hang high in the sky, ordering Profound Governance to enter the mortal world and wear the purple robe on their behalf. How can the Unblemished Robe possibly be achieved under such circumstances? To _fail_ is to walk the true path. His "success" in cultivating the Unblemished Robe meant he had merely hidden the purple robe beneath a white one, turning it into a Robe of Concealed Flaws.'

Tao Jiexing understood. For Wei Xuanyin to _fail_ to cultivate it now... was actually a terrifying and extremely dangerous situation.

'This Lord Wei... he sits at the pinnacle of the Profound Governance Pavilion. With Profound Governance intervening so completely in the Immortal Dao, manipulating the state of the entire world, achieving the Robe of Concealed Flaws should be an inevitability. Yet he remains aloof from it... Setting aside what kind of Dao-Profundity this requires... Lord Yao couldn't possibly be ignorant of the mechanisms at play. To appoint him to Profound Governance nonetheless... the meaning is painfully clear.'

'His ambition will likely prove a great trouble for the mountain.'

From Tao Jiexing's perspective, Mount Luoxia was actually quite tolerant. Otherwise, Wei Xuanyin would never have been allowed to reach his current cultivation as a Great Daoist Master. But what the mountain _truly_ thought... who would dare to guess?

Lost in his thoughts, Tao Jiexing found he had already arrived at a hazy, gray mountain forest. Peaks and valleys undulated in the night, and rows of gray-white banners snapped in the wind. This was the White Ye Immortal Sect.

This was Yehui's mountain gate. It was an inconspicuous player in the conflict between North and South, but it was nonetheless protected by a Purple Mansion Realm grand array. Tao Jiexing gave the dark forest a deep look before riding the wind down.

In stark contrast to the pitch-black desolation outside, the array's interior blazed with limitless radiance. The ground was golden, and the layers of palaces were nearly devoid of cultivators in Daoist robes. Instead, they were packed with a dense swarm of monks.

High in the main hall, two Mahas sat cross-legged, having shrunk to the size of ordinary men. Their golden bodies shone brilliantly, filling the hall with the sound of Sanskrit chants. Only one man, dressed in a feathered robe, sat off to the side, his eyes closed in silence.

The tiny White Ye Immortal Sect was practically bursting with Buddhist cultivators!

Not only were the Mahas Vast Cicada and Maha Nuzi presiding, but below them, Nu Yan, Xuwang, Luejin, and others of the Golden Lotus Seat were arrayed. Master Monks and lesser disciples stood in sequence, and off to the side, silent and stern, was the Touba family's own Daoist Master, Touba Ci.

This was the strategy Yehui had presented to Qi Lanyan.

The White Ye Immortal Sect lay just across the Wilderness. Its territory was vast, and to the northwest lay Baixiang Valley, a perfect springboard for attacking Mount Bianyan and relieving the pressure on Tangdao Mountain. This was, in fact, the very same strategy Great Song was employing.

However, Qi Lanyan had calculated that the Great Song cultivators would be too desperate to send reinforcements to attack the White Ye Immortal Sect's mountain gate directly before first repelling the Northern forces. They would surely bypass it and head for Baixiang. During the last several engagements, he had secretly used the Touba family's demonic arts to smuggle Buddhist cultivators into the sect's mountain gate. Bit by bit, he had amassed a significant force, having long since hidden Vast Cicada and the others here.

The seemingly isolated, helpless, and tottering Capital immortals Dao mountain gate, apparently abandoned by its Daoist Masters, was in fact hiding a surprise army!

With this arrangement, if Liu Bai and his contingent stopped to assault the White Ye Immortal Sect, they would be bogged down in a protracted siege, allowing the North to encircle them. But now, with Liu Bai and the others racing north to provide aid, this hidden army could pour out at any moment, sever their line of retreat, and seize a massive advantage.

Helian Wujiang, Helian Wumeng, and the others were all just bait. The only person who knew the full extent of the plan was Yehui himself.

This band of monks had been waiting here for a long time and were growing restless. Seeing Tao Jiexing, they were overjoyed. Vast Cicada, who sat at the very head, immediately leaped down and grinned.

"Cousin... is it done?"

To avoid detection by the South, they hadn't even linked the grand arrays, instead using the Purple Mansion Realm array to sever all connection to the Great Void. They were completely in the dark. Tao Jiexing quickly clasped his hands in respect and replied,

"It is—they've gone north!"

In an instant, delight spread across their faces. The man in white robes sitting to the side opened his eyes, a hint of a smile in his gaze.

"In that case, why not strike south immediately!"

His meaning was obvious: take this chance to cross the Wilderness and strike directly into the heartland of Great Song.

But this casual suggestion, clearly a jest, made everyone's expression flicker. Not a single one dared to respond. Touba Ci, standing to the side with his hands clasped behind his back, laughed inwardly.

'This entire group is here to scavenge for destiny, not to throw their lives away. Who would follow you into the Great Song heartland? Profound Governance gave no such order, and deeply offending the Underworld... is that a death wish?'

'What's more, there's still no definitive news on Yang Ruiyi. If we really ignore Liu Bai and dive deep into the South, Situ Huo, Liu Bai, and the others could just abandon the mountain, race back to reinforce, and coordinate with Yang Ruiyi. Then _we_ would be the ones cut off and surrounded.'

'If we're striking south, Moongaze Lake is a more realistic target... but Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei are joined there. We couldn't take it quickly. The end result would be the same.'

No one answered him. Only Vast Cicada gave an awkward laugh.

"In that case, Daoist friend, please feel free to head south yourself. We still need to go north and catch them completely unprepared."

Liu Bai's group was already struggling to attack Mount Bianyan. How could they possibly withstand a pincer attack from the rear? Why take a massive risk by invading deep into enemy territory when there was such a soft target ripe for the taking?

At this, the man in white robes immediately fell silent. Tao Jiexing simply said,

"Time is short. Everyone, let's move!"

Instantly, countless golden lights erupted as they stepped into the Great Void and surged north. The sky churned with chaotic colors. Vast Cicada laughed.

"Daoist friend Touba and I will go first! The rest of you wait here and intercept their routing forces!"

...

Baixiang Valley.

Baixiang Valley had once been a precious land of exquisite beauty, the ancestral home of the great Su clan of Ning State. Its low hills were covered in maple trees. But now, the earth quaked and the mountains shook, and the ground was scarred with crisscrossing trenches.

A colossal golden body blotted out the sky, its countless eyes gazing down upon the mortal world. The heavens above were a swirl of mixed hues, with thousands of pink, illusory bands of light streaking across the firmament, layer upon layer, casting a gaudy, multicolored sheen over everything.

The one guarding this place was none other than a Liangli of the Way of Emptiness—Zhelu.

This Maha was a six-life reincarnator, and his power was immense.

And the sword cultivator standing opposite him, treading upon a field of pure white light, was Liu Bai.

This Daoist Master's divine ability blazed, filling heaven and earth. His feet were planted on the Azure Jade Cliff, an art that evaded calamity, and the longsword in his hand pointed directly at the Maha, showing no sign of weakness. Wherever his blade pointed, thousands of the Maha's eyes would squeeze shut in turn, streaming tears.

And behind this Daoist Master Zhusheng, a round jade ring hung suspended in the air. It was as large as a desk but as thin as a cicada's wing, divided into an inner and outer circle. A smoky, rouge-soaked light rippled across its surface. Empowered by his divine ability and dharma power, it spun like the dharma wheel of a true immortal, its divine might boundless.

The Supreme Goodness Profound Jade he had received in trade from Li Zhouwei all those years ago had now been refined by this Daoist Master into an exceptionally formidable treasure!

Under the dual empowerment of the jade wheel and his True Qi, he gave no ground, and even seemed to be overpowering Zhelu.

While his sword qi swept the field and stirred the heavens, Helian Wujiang and Murong Yan were still locked in combat with Chen Yin and Xianyao. In another part of the battlefield, Tinglan was in a much more difficult position.

Her opponents were Gao Fangjing, whose raging fires and fierce Spiritual Artifacts were deadly, and Changyun of Chengyun Gate, a master of metallic arts and profound Dao techniques. Gao Fangjing was the lesser threat; Changyun, despite his rogue cultivator origins, had already reached the mid-Purple Mansion Realm. His divine abilities were tyrannical.

Tinglan wove between them, relying on her Immeasurable Water and Fire and the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion, but the wounds on her body were accumulating. A deep sense of exhaustion was setting in.

'The North has too many people! Baixiang and Mount Bianyan... this was clearly a trap!'

Her heart grew heavy. Her gaze swept the battlefield, only to find that the most relaxed fighters were, paradoxically, the Li family's three Holders of the Profound, who were entangled at low altitude with several Merciful Ones.

There was a simple reason for this: when dealing with Buddhist cultivators, especially the Merciful Ones who served the Mahas, the Lightless Water and Fire was simply too effective.

This True Qi, manifested as a shimmering golden-purple flame and water, was even more terrifying than her own Immeasurable Water and Fire. Her art burned the surrounding Great Void; their art directly _severed_ the Merciful Ones from the Great Void itself.

For a Merciful One, this wasn't as simple as being unable to traverse. The guiding light from the Buddhist Land vanished instantly. All Buddhist arts linked to the Buddhist Land failed. Even though the Maha Liangli was right there, even though the Buddhist Land had never felt closer, they couldn't join hands, form an array, or draw upon its multicolored light. It was impossible. Unless Zhelu became so desperate that he ordered the Way of Emptiness's Buddhist Land to manifest and connect with the mortal world, these Merciful Ones couldn't hope for even a shred of its aid.

To make matters worse, Li Jiangliang and his brothers were no easy opponents. Their command of the light of Martial Cultivation grew more proficient by the moment, descending upon their foes one by one without the slightest hindrance. They were beginning to make it look effortless.

This undoubtedly relieved a great deal of pressure on Tinglan, easing her worries about being flanked. She raised her brow and once again forced the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion to suppress Changyun's golden saber. Her face paled, and before she could even dissolve the tremors rattling her body, her expression changed abruptly.

The True Fire that Gao Fangjing had sent hurtling toward her burned brightly, but from within it, a speck of yellow light suddenly flared!

Intertwining streams of Profound Yellow Qi burst forth, manifesting a bright, sharp halberd. Before it even reached her, a suffocating pressure washed over her face. This attack was prepared in advance, brimming with stored divine ability. It was aimed to kill.

'The Touba family!'

At that moment, both of Tinglan's Spiritual Artifacts and her Immeasurable Water and Fire were occupied, suppressed externally. Her own divine abilities were busy parrying, leaving her guard wide open. Seeing this, Changyun's eyelid twitched. He knew this was bad.

But just then, a brilliant radiance burst from Tinglan's glabella. A mirror leaped out!

The mirror was a shimmering, palm-sized disc of silver. It looked exceptionally fragile, yet it met the halberd with ferocious tenacity. In an instant, the silver light shattered, exploding outward to pierce heaven and earth!

"BOOM!"

A world-shaking crack of thunder echoed. The entire sky changed color as silver light cascaded down like a waterfall, unleashing thousands of streams of divine lightning.

"CLANG!"

This heaven-spanning tempest of lightning was terrifyingly potent. It cleansed the air, shattered evil arts, and dispersed all concealment, revealing the hidden figures suspended in the sky, one by one.

Tinglan's pupils dilated.

She saw Touba Ci materialize in front of her. Her heart sank. Her reaction was immediate; she knew what this meant. Her head snapped up, her gaze flying toward the three Li brothers in the foothills.

A speck of white had just leaped from the Great Void.

The thing was all claws and snapping jaws, its wings a blur. Tinglan knew it instantly—her heart seized with terror.

'Vast Cicada?!'

'That monk... he's after the sons of Bright Yang!'

"Hahahahaha!"

Almost simultaneously, the world exploded with a deafening roar. An immense golden form erupted from the ground between the three brothers. A face that towered into the clouds reappeared—its nose a mountain peak, its eyes like palace halls. Its giant mouth gaped open, and its tongue had transformed into a White Cicada, writhing and clawing as if in a savage sneer.

Vast Cicada had revealed his Golden Body without a moment's hesitation.

His Golden Body was so vast it cast a colossal shadow over the land, not only freezing the three brothers in their tracks but also sending the nearby Merciful Ones tumbling to the ground in terror.

"Vast Cicada?!"

Li Jiangliang felt a chill run down his spine. The delicate balance the three of them had struggled to maintain against the Merciful Ones was instantly shattered. The force of the roar shoved all three back nine steps. They paused for a fraction of a second, their faces completely engulfed in the immense shadow.

Gleaming white fangs parted. The mountain-sized White Cicada leaped forth. The thousands of human eyes embedded in its compound gaze fixed on him as it drew its limbs from the endless darkness and lunged, its arms spread wide in a crushing embrace.

A dignified Maha of five reincarnations had been lurking all this time, only to strike with his full, merciless power, and he was the target.

Li Jiangliang was enveloped by the shadow of that giant maw. He felt as if he were trapped in a blazing fire. His expression changed as his hands flew together, forming seals to sense Martial Cultivation and attempt an escape. But he found the White Cicada's crimson eyes boring into him, pinning him in place with a divine ability.

"DONG!"

A sonorous, melodic bell chimed in his ears.

"Fourth Brother!"

Li Jiangxia's roar shook the heavens. But everything before Li Jiangliang seemed to freeze. A golden light, no bigger than his palm, was born from the darkness. It swelled to the size of a mountain, like a tiger leaping from its long dormancy in the jungle, and it hacked squarely into the White Cicada's face.

"BOOM!"

The dazzling golden light banished all darkness. The world filled with the sound of cracking and shattering. The incessant chanting and the chiming bell that had filled his ears vanished, replaced by a profound silence.

"AOWOO!!"

An earth-shaking scream of agony echoed through the heavens. The scenery around him dissolved, flowing backward like a chaotic, disorderly river.

Li Jiangliang found his vision fading. Endless, howling winds swept past him. He was in a crimson desert, under a vast and empty sky, and the sounds of slaughter rose from all directions.

He felt the world spin. A golden-yellow sun was rising _backward_ from the west, ascending at a terrifying speed. A dark-golden halberd was embedded in a pale-white cicada husk, and a pair of invisible eyes opened, spanning the heavens and the earth.

Before this brilliant, colossal sun, which loomed like a great beast slumbering in the desert, he—Li Jiangliang—and his two elder brothers lowered their heads as one. It was as if their spines had been ripped out. Before that endless, qilin-like golden light, they were but three black specks, three ants, kneeling in the desert's howling gale.

Four stars flickered in the sky. The dark-golden halberd flew back to its owner's hand. Light and shadow played across his elder brother Li Jianglong's face. His eyes were squeezed shut, and with a voice filled with a bizarre mix of terror and joy, he choked out a single word.

"Father."




# Chapter 1098: A Change in the Arrowhead

'Crimson Severing Arrowhead.'

Thunder rolled across the heavens and the earth. A blood-red radiance unfurled like a magnificent scroll painting, rippling outward from Vast Cicada. It revealed a vision of a blood-stained desert, of scattered armor and chaotic banners. The air, filled with the ceaseless din of roars and battle cries, forced every spectator to turn, their gazes frozen.

Above the Baixiang Valley, where divine abilities clashed and intertwined, a vast new domain had manifested. It hung in mid-air like a Grotto-heaven, or perhaps a Desert Sky-Platform floating upon the clouds. Torrents of yellow sand, awash in the same blood-red light, poured from its edges, eclipsing all other colors in the sky. All that remained for the land below was a thick, bottomless darkness.

And upon that desert, a man with golden eyes and black robes stood, his expression glacial as he slowly drew a long halberd.

A name echoed in everyone's mind simultaneously:

'Li Zhouwei…'

'Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm!'

Above Baixiang Valley, the thousands of eyes belonging to the Maha floated, observing in secret. The Jade True sword cultivator glanced over. Disbelief flooded Tinglan’s pale face, followed by a sudden flush of color.

'Crimson Severing Arrowhead… He wasn't healing… He was breaking through…'

But while the other Daoist Masters saw the divine ability as a distant Desert Sky-Platform, Vast Cicada, who was trapped within it, felt as though he had been plunged into a boundless Grotto-heaven. The figures of the other cultivators had vanished from the sky, replaced by an oppressive darkness so thick he couldn't see his hand in front of his face, and a colossal setting sun that consumed the horizon.

The sun prostrated itself upon the desert. Its immense head rapidly dispersed under the light, and countless streams of splendor cascaded down like a waterfall, revealing the human form of the monk.

'Crimson Severing Arrowhead.'

Vast Cicada was, of course, familiar with this divine ability—Li Jieyi had also been a Bright Yang cultivator at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm. But... this was the divine ability he had sought and failed to obtain. Only after throwing his lot in with the Buddhists and gaining mastery over the Precious Tusk Golden Land had he finally grasped a fraction of its power.

A complex emotion flickered in Vast Cicada's eyes, but he suppressed it in an instant.

'The Radiant Sun King's Halberd… For such a clumsy weapon to fall from the sky and still strike me… White Cicada is wounded, and my connection to Precious Tusk is unstable…'

The monk's forehead was smooth, his features handsome. His golden-patterned kasaya snapped in the wind, revealing the brown robes fluttering beneath. A trickle of golden blood seeped from the corner of his lips, but he paid it no mind, his gaze locked on the figure suspended within the desert domain.

'Li Zhouwei.'

Li Zhouwei's Radiant Sun King's Halberd hadn't struck Vast Cicada's true body. It had struck something far more vital: his foundation, White Cicada. The blow had shaken his very connection to Precious Tusk. The monk, however, dared not show any sign of distress in front of his enemy. He suppressed the injury. The golden blood lingered at his lips for a moment before vanishing.

"So, you are Li Zhouwei!"

His only answer was the brilliant flash of a golden halberd-edge illuminating the world.

Vast Cicada solemnly raised his head. With a grasping motion of one hand, a glittering spear of Li Fire materialized in his palm. His eyes brightened, and as he raised the spear, a tide of killing intent surged forth.

'I, Li Jieyi... am not like Mingxiang, a Daoist monk who only knows spell arts!'

The Li Fire spear, coalescing from crimson flames, shot forward to parry. This was the same treasured spear that had once nearly shattered the divine ability of the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron. Yet, in the blood-red radiance of this domain, its own light seemed to dim. The aura of Grand Ascension erupted from Li Zhouwei, and the force alone caused the monk's form to sink, forcing him back a step.

In that instant, a second beam of light leaped from the halberd, scything horizontally toward his neck.

Vast Cicada's gaze hardened. He opened his crimson lips and, with a metallic clang, bit down on the attacking light. His pearly white teeth flashed as he commanded:

"Go!"

A violent gale, laced with sand and blood, spat from his mouth. It was a stark, crimson torrent that blasted the pale golden afterimage, transforming it into a coiling, venomous serpent that lunged for Li Zhouwei's face.

But at that precise moment, the Li Fire spear in Vast Cicada's hand suddenly felt lighter. The blood-red light vanished from his vision, replaced by a single, deep-red point.

An ordinary cultivator might not have understood, but Vast Cicada, with his foundation in Bright Yang, knew exactly what this was.

'The Light of Karmic Dissolution and Pure Yin!'

This light appeared only when the Bright Yang position shifted, or when an Emperor or Crown Prince engaged in self-reflection. Within a divine ability, it flared at the moment Crimson Severing Arrowhead dissipated, allowing one to shift the primary position, execute a 'Sovereign's Misdirection,' and disrupt the enemy's mind.

'This light… It should only appear when Crimson Severing Arrowhead has been cultivated to true perfection! He must be supremely favored by Bright Yang, born to wield this!'

Just as he thought, the crimson serpent struck empty air. The scenery of Baixiang Valley reappeared. Li Zhouwei's figure had materialized _behind_ him. One hand gripped the halberd’s end, the other pressed against its shaft as he drove the weapon forward in a devastating mid-air thrust.

Fortunately, Vast Cicada was prepared. His face rotated grotesquely to the back of his head. His two mouths gaped wide, revealing the form of White Cicada once more.

"Roar—"

A colossal roar shook the heavens. The Li Zhouwei in front of him instantly disintegrated into countless wisps of yin qi, scattering like smoke.

It was an illusion, a phantom created by the divine ability.

'Sovereign's Misdirection…'

In the end, Li Jieyi had never managed to master Crimson Severing Arrowhead. Even with his immortal foundation and expertise in this path, he had miscalculated. He had missed this one crucial technique.

Li Zhouwei himself had used the dissipation of his divine ability to teleport to its very edge. The Grand Ascension swept across the sky, aimed directly at Touba Ci's back.

The reason was simple: Tinglan, besieged by three opponents, had only managed to parry a few blows and was already in dire straits.

In a flash, Touba Ci's expression changed. The light of Profound Yellow Qi at his brow flared as he spun, halberd in hand. Simultaneously, a massive seal descended from above, slamming down toward the Grand Ascension.

Touba Ci was of the Touba family, a nephew of the current King of Dai, and a proud man by nature. But he had clashed with Li Zhouwei in Wanling Heaven; he knew what this King Wei was capable of. Now, seeing his opponent's divine ability so greatly enhanced, he didn't dare show the slightest negligence. He instantly abandoned his assault on Tinglan to face this new threat with his full power.

Li Zhouwei had broken Tinglan's siege, but Vast Cicada had been left behind. The monk's reaction was lightning-fast. Instead of moving to reinforce his ally, he immediately shifted his gaze, searching for Jiangxia and the others.

Li Zhouwei could escape, but how could Jiangxia's group? Without Li Zhouwei's protection, it would take Vast Cicada only ten breaths to re-establish his sense of Precious Tusk and claim one of them.

But as he looked up, he was greeted by a brilliant Celestial Gate descending from the sky, flanked by soaring, colorful phoenixes and arrays of golden-armored guards. Seated upon the gate was a man in resplendent white-gold Daoist robes.

How could Vast Cicada not recognize him?

'Li Ximing!'

'He's not at Moongaze Lake… No… He was waiting for us to head north. He received word and crossed the river to follow. This was Yang Ruiyi's plan all along!'

This realization made Vast Cicada laugh, his heart a turmoil of shock and manic delight.

"Instead of cowering at the lake, you actually dare to follow me this deep? There are no restraints on my power here!"

He grit his teeth. As he raised his head, a blinding radiance erupted from his brow. His mouth gaped, and the half-broken form of White Cicada within beat its wings, threatening to burst forth on the wind. The very sky darkened as the spiritual qi churned.

But the Daoist Master on the Celestial Gate remained perfectly composed. He merely turned to the side as another figure stepped forth from the Great Void.

This man's features were unremarkable. He wore the simple purple-and-black robes of the Holder of the Profound, and motes of water and fire flickered at his side. But what drew every eye was the hand he held out flat.

Resting in his palm was a small, three-legged cauldron.

It looked as if it were carved from black jade, its surface impossibly smooth. It had two high, ornamental ears and was covered in dense, intricate patterns from which dark golden lines seemed to flow. A roiling black light shone from within its boiling contents.

The former state-founding ritual vessel of Yang-Yue, the supreme treasure of the modern Yang-Song: the Guzhou Cauldron.

The appearance of this treasured cauldron made Vast Cicada's expression fall. He not only aborted the Dharma Art he was casting but took a full step back, his gaze turning cold as ice as he stared at the black-robed man holding the cauldron.

A single Guzhou Cauldron had made him hesitate.

'That cauldron was birthed from Exiled Qi; it severs all spiritual connection. My Precious Tusk is already unstable from blocking that halberd strike. How can I risk exposing it to Exiled Qi now?'

If, back at the lake, Vast Cicada had been weighing the value of sacrificing Precious Tusk for a karmic opportunity, the presence of the Guzhou Cauldron eliminated all consideration.

The cauldron's appearance didn't just startle Vast Cicada. Far in the distance, the Maha's myriad eyes quivered, their collective gaze sweeping over to lock onto the newcomer.

'To be entrusted with carrying the cauldron, he must be an imperial descendant of the Yang clan… Ruizao. It must be him.'

'But that's not right!'f

As the Liangli of the Way of Emptiness, Zhelu's thoughts ran far deeper.

'Back when Yang Ruiyi plotted against Jiang Toushou, someone held Mingxiang back inside the nether carriage, allowing that pack of fools to fall into the trap. The Maha later guessed it was Ruizao… that he had secretly become Holder of the Profound and taken part…'

But if that was true, what was this? If Tinglan had left, Yang Ruiyi must be guarding Shanji. If Ruizao was here, then who was causing the Exiled Qi disturbance at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain?

_Boom!_

As Zhelu pondered, the vortex of Jade True light before him intensified, jolting him back to reality. The desert domain in the distance had retracted. The black-robed man stepped out of the void, and a deafening hum filled the sky.

Vast Cicada was pinned by Li Ximing and the Guzhou Cauldron. Tinglan had already regained her footing.

Li Zhouwei's expression was placid. His golden eyes stared intently at Touba Ci. The light at his brow flared, then swiftly transformed into the sigil of a solar eclipse. With it rose an oppressive, suffocating darkness that saturated the sky.

The divine ability Crimson Severing Arrowhead expanded at a terrifying speed, enveloping not only Touba Ci, but also Tinglan in her purple qi pavilion, Fangjing wreathed in True Fire, and Changyun, who manipulated golden qi. All four were now trapped within the desert domain.

The profound darkness reflected in the Daoist Masters' eyes. Touba Ci’s expression tensed, a burning battle-lust igniting in his gaze. Changyun simply smiled. Only Fangjing stood frozen, silent and tense.

The young genius from the Bolie region tightened his grip on his horse-lance and took a deep, shuddering breath.

Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, had taken the full blast of Touba's Profound Yellow Qi. He flicked his halberd, deflecting the treasure seal that descended from the sky. The webbing of his thumb trembled, slick with blood, but his face was a mask of pure exhilaration. His eyes shone, and giving his opponents no time to recover, the sigil on his brow solidified.

'Emperor Qi's Light.'

The eclipse mark became a vortex of absolute darkness, reflecting no light at all. Instead, the colossal setting sun at the desert's edge began to tremble. Then, it shattered, exploding into an overwhelming storm of black-gold radiance.

The desert was deep, the blood-light silent. A rain of black-gold fire filled the sky.

_Boom!_

Even with their profound backgrounds, the three Daoist Masters were forced to retreat, each summoning a Spiritual Artifact to defend themselves. Amidst the endless storm of black-gold light, a single white gleam flashed. The pale golden barrier in front of Touba Ci shattered. His pupils dilated. He thrust his halberd up, parrying an object in the gloom.

A sharp, golden halberd blade.

It stopped one inch from his eye.

Only then did the mournful wail of the jade-pearl Spiritual Artifact he had used to block the storm finally reach his ears. His hand on the Grand Ascension was steady as a rock, but he had been forced back a step.

Touba Ci, with his high-bridged nose and deep-set eyes, was a handsome man. As a dignified imperial scion of Great Liang and a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert, he would not swallow such an insult. Surging Profound Yellow Qi climbed his robes. An amber-colored light flowed from his eyes as his features seemed to sharpen. He let out an ecstatic breath and murmured:

"I have come to see 'Bright Yang'!"

Profound Qi divine ability: Vicarious Hindrance.

In an instant, a dark, bestial cloud of white mist rose from within the rolling Profound Yellow Qi. A white pearl leaped from his brow, erupting in a blinding white light that descended in waves, like a shower of blades.

It was the light of Veiled Yin.

The radiance fell like fluttering feathers, striking the blood-red illusion of the domain, causing its light to warp and waver. Li Zhouwei was undeterred. He lunged, taking another step forward, and commanded:

"Strike!"

As the word fell, the terrifying sunset reappeared on the horizon. It pulsed. The shower of Veiled Yin light had almost reached him when the command struck it. The light exploded into a swarm of ethereal insects and snakes, which dissolved into a cloud of white smoke under the glare of Bright Yang.

Crimson Severing Arrowhead, as the yin-aspect of Bright Yang, possessed properties antithetical to its source. It granted Li Zhouwei unpredictable movement and shored up his weaknesses, but it also gave him a potent weapon against Veiled Yin.

It was Yang Cusp Inversion.

Li Zhouwei had once used Emperor Qi's Light—a technique of Yang Cusp Inversion—against Zong Chang with tremendous success. Crimson Severing Arrowhead was a critical component of this inversion. With it, his Bright Yang power was not just a match for Veiled Yin; it held the superior position, capable of shattering yin-aligned evils.

'If Zong Chang herself were here, she would hesitate to challenge me with Veiled Yin. Only Wei Xuanyin could use a Veiled Yin divine ability to crack my Crimson Severing Arrowhead. But you, Touba Ci... how much could you possibly understand? I just wonder where that Veiled Yin power came from… It doesn't feel like a Spiritual Artifact.'

His halberd continued its unobstructed path. Touba Ci frowned. With a flick of his sleeve, just as Zong Chang had done, he "fell" into the darkness and reappeared in a different location, his gaze snapping upward.

The treasure seal was already descending.

This seal, modeled after a Dharma Treasure, was the signature technique of the Touba clan. It was something to be feared. Though clumsy, its power was immense. Even Li Zhouwei had to dodge, conceding the move.

But as he fell back, Touba Ci seized the opening. His eyes, now completely overflowing with an amber-brown light, gleamed. He laughed.

"Great Pass Azure-Soul Dharma Body!"

The world trembled. Under the light of the setting sun, a colossal figure rose from the desert floor.

It was as large as a mountain, with a human torso, a sharp, curved golden horn, and earlobes so long they rested on its shoulders. Its face was a mask of majesty. Its eyes were round as jewels, filled with concentric black-and-white rings that scanned its surroundings.

Six grey-copper arms extended from the demon's back, each ending in green-tinted claws. The six hands merged into one and, like Mount Tai itself, slammed down.

_Boom!_

The darkness in the domain flickered. The desert winds howled. The six-layered hands froze in mid-air, and the copper-green demon actually staggered.

An endless torrent of dark flames surged upward.

Another figure, just as large as a mountain, with six arms that blotted out the sky, had risen. But this one's face was as majestic and terrible as a Flood Dragon's, with a sharp jaw and rows of fine, serrated teeth. A dark-golden Bright Yang light dripped from its maw, drifting in the light of the blood-red sun.

Before their very eyes, from the east, from _within_ those six-layered hands, a new demon had clawed its way into existence.

The Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body.
