# Chapter 899: Purple Jade

A brilliant light flashed.

Inside the pavilion, pure qi drifted through an ethereal glow, as if sun and moon shone at once. A man in white-gold Daoist robes exhaled a plume of white mist. As his eyes slowly opened, the pure qi in the room stirred.

"What an incredible place to cultivate."

The Spiritual Qi in this pavilion was the richest he had ever encountered. He had seen the Pristine Water spiritual pool at Azure Pond, but even that paled in comparison to this place.

But as he cultivated, a sense of shock grew within him. The most crucial aspect wasn't the sheer density of the Spiritual Qi, but the fact that the spiritual balance of yin and yang here was perfectly stable and utterly unshakeable.

This concept might seem common, and it wasn't rare for cultivators—the grotto-heaven at Green Pine Temple had once boasted a similar balance. But the equilibrium in this pavilion was different. It was as unyielding as iron, absolutely immoveable!

It was common knowledge that cultivators and the local spiritual balance influenced one another. A place might start with perfect equilibrium, but as soon as someone performed a Dharma Art, cultivated, or refined artifacts and pills, it would inevitably disrupt the local yin and yang, causing fluctuations...

Yet here, whether Li Ximing unleashed his Purple Mansion Realm's True Fire or his Divine Ability, Heavenly Light, the surrounding yin and yang qi remained utterly still. Even when he sat to cultivate, drawing in Spiritual Qi at the terrifying speed of his Purple Mansion Realm, he couldn't alter a single inch of the space around him. The Spiritual Qi maintained its absolute, perfect equilibrium.

Li Ximing even suspected that if he were to die here and dissipate into Bright Yang Heavenly Light, the area wouldn't show a wisp of Bright Yang qi. It wouldn't even produce a single colorful cloud.

As an alchemist, Li Ximing immediately grasped the terrifying potential of this characteristic:

"This location... for refining certain medicinal pills... or even certain Spiritual Artifacts... it's beyond perfect. It's terrifyingly convenient."

He made a mental note and rose to his feet, feeling utterly refreshed and overflowing with power. His previous injuries were fully healed, and his cultivation had clearly advanced.

A quick calculation surprised him. He had been in seclusion for over a year. This meant the Northern Buddhists had been quiet during that time, and Tinglan and Ning Wan hadn't run into any serious trouble.

Li Ximing had spent seventy percent of that year mastering Tread on Flames.

'I've grasped the basics of Tread on Flames and can finally use it in combat. And the Radiant Celestial Wave Art... cultivation was surprisingly fast. It only took a short while to get the hang of it. I don't expect it to be as powerful as a true Divine Ability, but at least the core concept is sound.'

Li Ximing didn't expect this Dharma Art to rival the likes of Changxiao or be comparable to a Divine Ability, but if it could just stall an opponent or block an attack, that would be a huge boon.

He had awakened from his cultivation now because the jade talisman at his waist was pulsing with warmth—a clear sign that family matters required his attention.

He stepped out of the pocket dimension, materializing within the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda amid a storm of crackling lightning. The potent bolts felt like a warm bath washing over him. With another step, he passed through the pagoda and arrived atop Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

He took his seat and extended his spiritual sense. He immediately perceived a stranger—another Daoist Master—in the small pavilion outside the mountain's wards. Li Jiangqian was there as well, having clearly finished his own seclusion, and was waiting patiently and politely at the visitor's side.

He called out in a clear voice, "Fellow Daoist, please enter!"

The mountain's grand formation opened. A gust of gray wind descended from the sky, carrying a grim, chilling aura. It coalesced before him, taking the form of a robed Daoist Master.

The man's robes were unusual, and a treasured saber hung at his waist. His eyes were dark, his aura unstable, and it seemed to ripple with the light of a Divine Ability, as if he were actively suppressing some transformation. He looked like a dangerous figure. But, having entered another's territory, he showed the proper courtesy, offering a formal salute.

"This humble Daoist, Dingyang Zi of Qize, greets you, Fellow Daoist."

Li Ximing had already guessed this was the expert Kui Qi had found. He sized him up, estimating he hadn't yet reached the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, though it was impossible to tell how many Divine Abilities he possessed. He smiled and replied, "Please!"

He then sent someone to fetch the texts on shamanic arts while he personally gave the Daoist Master a tour of Gardenia Scenery Mountain, pointing out the lingering traces of the old Mount Wu.

But Mount Wu had been thoroughly looted. After so many years, and with Li Ximing's own power now settled over the mountain, there was little of the old aura left to find. Dingyang Zi clearly wasn't satisfied with what he saw. However, Li Ximing wasn't demanding anything and treated him with great respect, giving him plenty of "face." The Daoist Master's expression softened considerably, and he spoke in a low, more amiable tone:

"A pity. Duanmu Kui was formidable, but he was clearly unwilling to pass down his true arts. This Mount Wu is rather underwhelming."

Soon, someone carried over a chest of jade slips and placed it at Dingyang Zi's feet. The Daoist Master sat upright and accepted a summary catalog from Li Ximing. As he scanned the descriptions of the shamanic arts, his brow furrowed and relaxed intermittently. It was clear he found the collection to be rather ordinary.

Li Ximing knew perfectly well what he was offering. If there had been any truly potent shamanic arts left on Mount Wu, his family would have claimed it long ago. What remained was mostly low-grade material, useful perhaps for a few novel ideas, but nothing more. He silently sipped his tea.

Dingyang Zi set the catalog slip down. He said nothing further, but he seemed preoccupied. He abruptly picked up his jade cup, drained it in one gulp, and said, "I'd like to see the dharma artifact now."

Li Ximing handed him the jade box. The moment the cultivator opened it, his eyes lit up. "A fine treasure!" he exclaimed.

An item from the Southern Songzhou Luoshe was clearly high-quality. He lifted it, scrutinizing every detail for a long time. A look of genuine reluctance surfaced on his face. "Fellow Daoist," he said in a low voice, "if you'd be willing, I would very much like to trade you for this..."

There was no way Li Ximing would let him trade for it. He politely declined in a few words. Dingyang Zi knew it was a long shot and dropped the subject readily. "The Tiger's Frontier Upper Sect already spoke to me about this matter," he said, all business. "I have already made my decision, so I won't waste time with pleasantries."

He said gravely, "I cannot say how long it will take to refine this artifact. It could be a short time, or it could be many years. My own operation is small, not a large enterprise like yours on the lake, and I lack the abundant resources of Moongaze. Therefore, as I work on it, Moongaze will naturally be responsible for providing all necessary resources and materials."

"That is only natural."

When Li Ximing heard him mention the "Tiger's Frontier Upper Sect," he sighed inwardly but simply acknowledged the point. Dingyang Zi continued, "My Qize's Daoist tradition is shackled by the Changhuai Upper Sect. We lack many methods, and our access to medicinal pills is even worse. I am not skilled in alchemy, which brings me to another point."

"I have been refining for many years. I hope that you, Fellow Daoist, can send one Essence Gathering Pills to Qize each year. Furthermore, when the spirit embryo is successfully forged, I will require six Purple Mansion Realm-level pills: 'Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder'. I have brought the pill formula and the main ingredients with me."

"Oh?" Li Ximing smiled faintly. With his alchemy skills, Essence Gathering Pills were no problem at all. As for this "Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder," he could examine the formula first. He calmly accepted the materials and took a closer look.

'A spirit pill for cleansing the senses, purifying the mind, and advancing one's cultivation. It would be extremely difficult for an ordinary alchemist, and its purpose is very specific... After all, if I couldn't guarantee all six pills and ended up wasting his main ingredients, I would certainly make an enemy.'

The difficulty was less than that of the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill, which Li Ximing already had a surplus of. Why wouldn't he agree? He gave the formula a final scan, happily accepted the task, and smiled. "Done!"

His crisp, unhesitating "Done!" made Dingyang Zi regard him with newfound respect. The visiting Daoist Master placed the jade box with the formula and ingredients on the table, then collected the dharma artifact and the chest of shamanic arts. He offered a salute, "I have another Spiritual Artifact currently being refined in my furnace. It is at a critical stage. Although I have attendants watching it, I cannot be away from Qize for long. But rest assured, Fellow Daoist. I will start a second furnace and oversee them both. I will certainly handle your matter perfectly."

"I cannot stay any longer. If fate permits, we shall speak more in the future!"

Li Ximing now understood the reason for his curt, direct manner. His unpleasant expression upon arriving must have been from worrying about the Spiritual Artifact back in his furnace. Li Ximing quickly escorted him out, sighing to himself.

'Kui Qi has some serious influence. The Tiger's Frontier Upper Sect... they brought this man all the way to the lake with just a word. If they had a truly urgent matter and made him a promise, Dingyang Zi would have been hard-pressed to refuse. If it weren't for that critical Spiritual Artifact in his furnace, Kui Qi would have probably roped him into fighting the Buddhist cultivators!'

...

Moongaze Lake.

Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed. Heavy, dark clouds massed over the lake, turning the water's reflection to ink. A few commoners in small boats paddled frantically, fleeing across the surface. After a moment, a cultivator emerged to greet them.

Apricot-colored flames flickered into existence, dancing and coalescing in mid-air. A man in crimson robes descended upon the fire, his gaze fixed on a distant mountain peak.

His expression was uneasy as he watched the strange atmospheric disturbance. As he waited, a deafening crack of thunder split the sky, and a brilliant flash of lightning shot forward, revealing a burly man. "Hahahahaha!"

The man was massive and hairy, with an incredibly robust physique. He wore a suit of jade armor, and two fist-sized bronze bells hung from his waist. Beaming with triumph, he roared, "Family Head!"

Li Jiangqian clasped his hands, breathing a sigh of relief. With a guest still on the mountain, the sudden, ominous shift in the sky had made him fear that the Purple Mansion Realm masters had come to blows. Realizing it was one of his own clansmen having a breakthrough, he quickly smiled. "Congratulations, Clan Uncle!"

The man before him was, of course, Li Zhouda, the one who had inherited Li Chenghui's legacy. After struggling for so many years, he had finally succeeded. Having achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, he was bursting with pride. He waved his hand, searching for words, but after a long pause, he just boomed, "What a feeling!"

Li Jiangqian chuckled and guided him down. "Your breakthrough comes at a perfect time, Clan Uncle. Congratulations!"

Li Zhouda had taken a long time to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm; the family's medicinal pills had clearly played a significant role. Without those resources, his chances would have been slim. In fact, so much time had passed that rumors had begun to circulate that he had perished during the attempt.

Li Zhouda, having just emerged, knew nothing of these rumors. He was in high spirits, laughing as he replied, "It's truly a blessing from the ancestors! I feared I was too incompetent to continue the lineage. This is a joyous occasion! I'm going to hold a grand banquet when I return. All the family branches must come and honor me with their presence!"

He was not a reserved man, and his face beamed with pride. As other family cultivators gathered around to offer their own congratulations, Li Jiangqian smiled and stepped to the side, his gaze sweeping over the crowd as if counting them.

Li Jiangqian himself had been out of seclusion for over six months. He had broken through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm and consolidated his cultivation. In truth, with the Talisman Pill he possessed, reaching the late-stage was well within his grasp. However, with so many eyes watching, such rapid advancement would seem suspicious, so he had held off on consuming it.

During his time out of seclusion, he had taken the rare opportunity to set aside family duties and focus on his Dharma Art. The Great Parting Scripture was an outstanding Daoist tradition, and it was clear from his vibrant aura that he had made significant progress.

As the crowd celebrated, the heavy, dark clouds from the breakthrough began to recede. The eastern sky, however, grew hazy, tinged with a faint purple glow. A streak of Heavenly Light shot over from the lake, materializing into a figure before them. The crowd immediately bowed. "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

"Not bad." The figure was Li Ximing, just returned from escorting his guest. He nodded to Li Zhouda in approval, but his gaze was fixed on the distant horizon, his expression a mixture of doubt and gravity. 'Such an expanse of purple haze.'

Such celestial phenomena were never simple. The eastern clouds were a deep, abundant purple, stacked like tiles across the sky. When the Morning Glow struck them, they lit up in shades of violet and gold—a spectacular and auspicious sight.

He couldn't dwell on it. "See to his arrangements," he instructed the group. "I'm going to take a look."

He dissolved into a streak of light and shot eastward. In what felt like only a few steps, he arrived over the bustling Yufu Prefecture. Cultivators were rising and falling through the air, whispering amongst themselves. A Divine Ability flashed in the sky, and a man in brownish-gray robes emerged. "Senior Houfu!"

Daoist Master Houfu was already there, nodding in admiration. When he saw Li Ximing, he descended on his cloud to greet him, gesturing him over. "A joyous event!" he praised. "A wondrous breakthrough has been achieved."

That single phrase, "a wondrous breakthrough," clarified everything. Li Ximing, who had been nursing a hopeful suspicion, was instantly overjoyed. He clapped his hands. "Good! Excellent! The Purple Smoke Blessed Land truly lives up to its name—its fortune runs deep!"

Just then, a cloud of purple qi swirled and rose from the blessed land, revealing a woman robed in swirling purple mist. A longsword of pure purple jade was strapped to her back. Her features were lovely. She bowed gracefully in mid-air and smiled. "Ziyu greets all Fellow Daoists!"

In front of her stood Tinglan, dressed in autumn-yellow robes, her face alight with even greater joy. "This is Kan Ziyu, Daoist title Wenqing," she announced. "Today, she has successfully achieved her Divine Ability."

The assembled cultivators all voiced their congratulations. Kan Ziyu, her face flushed with happiness, followed Tinglan's lead, returning the salutes one by one. The blessed land was filled with a festive atmosphere, shimmering with auspicious light.

'Kan Ziyu...' Li Ximing mused. 'If I calculate it properly, she's from the same generation as my grand-uncle, Li Xuanfeng. I should be considered the same generation as Qian Lizi. But Jiangnan cultivators don't fuss over such lineage unless they're from the same sect. Here, precedence is determined by when one achieves a Divine Ability, and the accomplished becomes the senior.' Thus, Daoist Master Wenqing still saluted him with the respect due to a senior.

Daoist Master Tinglan scanned the group and smiled. "Ziyu must now consolidate her cultivation and stabilize her new Divine Ability. We thank all of you, Fellow Daoists, for your well-wishes."

Li Ximing was visibly pleased, thinking to himself, 'This is a true blessing. Help when it's needed most.'

'Thinking about it, Kan Ziyu's generation had many geniuses. Apart from the few in seclusion at Azure Pond Sect, Xiukui also has Lin Chensheng, who cultivates the Upper Shaman path. I wonder if he's managed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm yet.'

As he was pondering this, he realized that Houfu was supposed to be stationed at the Great Western Plateau. He couldn't help but ask, "Senior, your duties in the west..."

Houfu smiled at him. "The Supreme Yang Dao's rotation to guard that place is an old rule," he replied. "But I'd been there so long I grew weary of it. I discussed it with Sword Gate several times, and they agreed to take over the post from my Xiukui. Sword Gate will handle the remaining years of the term. I also asked Daoist Master Ni of Wu State to assist. We simply have to repay the favor next time."

Li Ximing smiled. "That's a clever solution."

Sword Gate was known to be rigid, constrained by that Sword Scripture of theirs. Although they had two Daoist Masters, Li Ximing had never once seen Daoist Master Cheng attend a gathering of the Supreme Yang Dao. This spoke volumes about his attitude—he clearly preferred to avoid worldly conflict. The only one in Sword Gate truly intent on changing the situation was Lingmei.

Given the sect's stance, Lingmei faced great resistance to acting openly. This rotation swap was, without a doubt, his way of helping them indirectly. Li Ximing nodded to himself in approval.

'And they've also brought this Daoist Master Ni into the fold. It's clear... while I was in seclusion, the Daoist Masters of the Supreme Yang Dao haven't been idle for a moment. They are constantly gathering strength.'

Just as he was thinking this, Tinglan approached, riding a cloud of purple qi. Kan Ziyu's breakthrough had clearly been a surprise to her. Even with her usual composure, she couldn't quite contain her delight. "Zhaojing is out of seclusion," she smiled.

Li Ximing smiled and nodded. She gestured for him to accompany her toward Tangdao Mountain. "Ning Wan has gone to the Shahuan Kingdom and was planning to visit the Southern Sea as well, so she isn't here at the moment..."

Her expression turned serious. "After all, we have connections with both the Shahuan Kingdom and the Southern Songzhou Luoshe. She's gone to call in those favors, to see if there's any chance of securing their aid..."

Li Ximing nodded his understanding. Tangdao Mountain was already before them. It was shrouded in an iridescent, dark light that constantly shifted and folded, resolving into myriad shapes. A powerful, ancient aura washed over them.

Tinglan and Ning Wan hadn't constructed a full Purple Mansion Realm grand formation, as the Li family had done at their home. Such an undertaking was incredibly complex, and this wasn't a permanent sect headquarters, so there was no need. Instead, they were using a Purple Mansion Realm-grade formation-disk Spiritual Artifact for protection, leveraging their own cultivation in the Dao of formations to amplify its power. The resulting display was still formidable.

But when Li Ximing saw the artifact, he sighed to himself. 'That is definitely a Spiritual Artifact from the Great Xiukui Monastery's Daoist tradition. It seems Kui Qi was right—their trip to the Northern Sea was a failure.'



# Chapter 900: Strategic Calculations

The Daoist tradition of the Northern Sea had refused to lend their artifact, so Li Ximing saw no point in courting rejection by pressing the issue. He didn't even ask where Kui Qi was. Instead, he mentioned Dingyang Zi, and the group proceeded up the mountain.

"That Dingyang Zi, whom Senior Kui Qi invited, already came to the lake. We've concluded our discussions. He sent over a pill recipe, the 'Serpentwater Suspension Powder,' and asked me to refine it."

The main hall on Tangdao Mountain had long since been repaired. Tinglan, who looked to be fully recovered from her injuries, led the group inside. As she listened to Li Ximing speak of Dingyang Zi, Houfu shook his head.

"He's... lacking in tact. If he caused any offense, please forgive him, Zhaojing."

Li Ximing understood the situation. He noticed Tinglan anxiously watching his expression, as if worried he and Dingyang Zi had clashed.

Tinglan quickly explained, "That man may have ties to the Supreme Yang, but he hasn't got an easy temperament. He's been disappointed in Changhuai for a long time, which makes him abrasive. But the moment Senior Kui Qi sent a letter, he agreed immediately. It shows his heart is still on our side. Please just overlook his gruffness."

They spoke as if it were a serious issue, but based on Li Ximing's own interaction with Dingyang Zi, the man had his diplomatic moments. He hadn't been particularly rude or foul-mouthed.

"Dingyang Zi is a straightforward man," Li Ximing said. "He's capable and decisive—a whirlwind of activity. He sorted out the entire matter in no time."

Upon entering the great hall, they saw a jade table set at the head, with seats arrayed on either side. There was no music, dancing, or fine wine; it was a simple, functional hall. The man seated at the head regarded them with a relatively relaxed expression and nodded a greeting.

"Senior Kui Qi!"

Kan Ziyu's breakthrough was clearly a potent balm; even Kui Qi's complexion looked significantly better. After everyone was seated, Kui Qi took the initiative to offer his congratulations.

"Congratulations, Daoist Friend."

Tinglan smiled and returned the courtesy. Li Ximing watched her, then turned to Kui Qi who said calmly, "I went to the Northern Sea as planned. The array disc for the Xie Clan's 'Magnetic-Control Swarm-Light Array' was borrowed by the Touba Clan thirty years ago. It is... unobtainable."

A hush fell over the hall. The Touba Clan wasn't exactly intimate with the Buddhist cultivators, but being neighbors in the north, they had frequent dealings. The Supreme Yang Dao, on the other hand, had no relationship with the Touba Clan to speak of. There was naturally no chance they would agree to lend the array.

Kui Qi paused for a moment, absorbing the news, before continuing, "After I returned from the Northern Sea, I immediately detoured to the Peacock Sea. This time, it was a formal, official visit, so it was handled with more ceremony. At least I've returned to hear this excellent news about Ziyu."

Li Ximing had been to the Peacock Sea himself, so he knew Kui Qi was referring to the Great Daoist Master Yuandao of the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition, who maintained close ties with the Supreme Yang Dao. Just then, Tinglan began her report.

"These past days, numerous Merciful Ones and Master Monks have arrived outside the mountain. We haven't spotted any Mahas, but there's no shortage of small-timers, and plenty who come forward to provoke us."

"The disciples at the Foundation Establishment Realm have been skirmishing daily. Casualties are unavoidable, but thankfully, they remain within acceptable limits. None of the main clans have suffered major losses among their core disciples. The enemy's Merciful Ones have made three moves, always in groups of three or four, striking at our formation. They retreat after a single probe. It's clear they're testing our defenses and gauging our numbers."

"However, based on the 'golden bodies' we've sighted, we can confirm that Taixi and Nuzi, at the very least, have been driven here like hounds. We haven't seen signs of other Daoist traditions, but we *have* detected traces of the 'Belly Buddhist Land'. I fear it's the Way of Compassion."

The Way of Compassion was the hegemon of the Yan State and the most active branch of the Northern Buddhists. Their presence here was decidedly bad news, causing Li Ximing to frown. The others, however, showed no surprise, as if this was entirely expected.

'The Way of Compassion also led the charge in the last great conflict between North and South...'

Tinglan's expression turned serious as she looked at Li Ximing. "There's no sense in just waiting for them to break down our doors. Now that Zhaojing is out of seclusion and Senior Kui Qi has returned, it's time we led a contingent of our own to test their mettle."

The two-year deadline was fast approaching. By unspoken agreement, no one mentioned the sword immortal, Daoist Master Lou Xing.

Though time ticked by, the sword immortal's deterrent presence had not fully faded. But once Daoist Master Lou Xing ascended Luoxia and passed away, the North would learn of it instantly. The moment that happened, the deterrence would vanish. It was crucial, therefore, to probe the enemy's strength before that time came.

Purple Smoke had gained Kan Ziyu, which was another trump card, but the northern Buddhist cultivators were not blind. In fact, their skills in divination surpassed most immortal cultivators. They would surely know of it by now. It was even possible that the moment conflict erupted, the North would strike pre-emptively, before Tangdao Mountain could even mobilize.

'Honestly, it would be best if Daoist Master Lou Xing could just cling to a thread of life, playing the part of a walking corpse, to keep the news of his death from leaking,' Li Ximing thought. 'But the old man's life has run its course. His dying wish was fulfilled; slaying that Maha was his final contribution. How could they ask him to endure more just for the sake of Xiukui...'

Kui Qi's expression grew somber. "We have long been preparing for this..."

He had only spoken half a sentence when a figure in white robes passed through the formation and entered the hall. The man wore the robes of a Daoist and carried a sword on his back. He was exceptionally handsome, and his aura was immense. It was none other than the Jade True sword cultivator from the Southern Borderlands, Daoist Master Zhusheng!

He arrived before them, offered a salute, and smiled. "Greetings, fellow Daoists!"

Li Ximing returned the salute and nodded silently, a sudden realization dawning on him.

'So that's what this is about. The Supreme Yang Dao contingent already had this planned, just waiting for the right moment to strike. But Kui Qi is a proud man; he would never accept help for free. He must have moved up the timeline for the spirit embryo matter, specifically inviting Dingyang Zi, forcing the man to drop the Spiritual Artifacts he was refining, and making him agree to my request as a condition.'

'The original plan was likely to wait another three to five days. Ning Wan would have returned from the south, all the reinforcements would have gathered, and then they would have formally summoned me to the mountain. But Kan Ziyu's sudden breakthrough changed things. Everyone was already gathered, so they just invited me over on the spot. That must be why Ning Wan isn't here.'

A chill ran through him. 'They even brought in Daoist Master Zhusheng from the distant Southern Borderlands? If they were willing to swallow their pride, couldn't they also have called upon the much-closer Chunyi Dao Gate? Chen Yin of the Yuyang Chen Clan would be even easier to summon. Southern Songzhou Luoshe is less certain... but if Ning Wan put her Daoist tradition's interests aside for a moment, would Daoist Master Luo really refuse to come?'

'Kui Qi is a man of daring. Having committed to holding Tangdao Mountain, he's bringing his full strength to bear. He has no intention of sheathing his sword until he has made the Buddhist cultivators *feel* this loss!'

Just then, the Jade True cultivator, Daoist Master Zhusheng, asked, "I wonder, where is Daoist Master Zhu Gong at present?"

At this, Tinglan answered with a trace of embarrassment, "It's hard to say. I've inquired several times but found no trace of her. I fear she may have already entered seclusion."

This wasn't particularly surprising. Li Ximing mused inwardly that it was highly unlikely Daoist Master Zhu Gong was unaware of the situation in Jiangnan. She was probably using this crisis as an opportunity to extricate herself. After all, her sect was located near Purple Smoke, and with the Capital immortals Dao on the front lines, the smartest move was to harden her heart and stay away.

'Even if she were here, they probably wouldn't announce it,' he thought. 'If the Chunyi Dao Gate was present, Zhu Gong's Eastern Sea origins would be an indelible stain. It would be one thing if she were at full strength, but injured? She wouldn't dare make her presence known...'

Li Ximing now understood Ning Wan's purpose for her trip to the Southern Sea. He watched as Kui Qi rose to his feet, hands clasped behind his back.

"Tangdao Mountain itself is a barrier. To the north lies the Luoxia Plain, backed by the fertile lands of Baijiang Creek. It is the strategic key to the north and south. It connects to Xiaoshi in the west and Chengyun in the east. We hold the terrain advantage, reinforced by our great formation, giving us the high ground. The Buddhist cultivators' forces are scattered across the north and difficult to concentrate. The mountain's geography alone, facing north and split into three main ridges, will be a formidable obstacle for them."

"For now, the Lotus Temple is not intervening. The Buddhist cultivators' nearest major sect is at Qinling Mountain, which is a great distance away. Therefore, they have established forward temples in three areas: the Xiaoshi region, the Luoxia region, and the Caishan region, corresponding to our west, north, and east flanks."

Kui Qi stated gravely, "All three locations must be pinned down. The Caishan area borders Chengyun; I would like Zhaojing to handle that front. Xiaoshi Mountain will be Tinglan's responsibility. The rest of us will punch directly through the north and draw first blood."

Kui Qi's plan was straightforward. At the Purple Mansion Realm, distance is a trivial obstacle. Unless pinned down by another expert of the same level, traversing the Great Void to any of those locations would take almost no time at all.

Li Ximing, with his Audience with the Celestial Gate, and Tinglan, wielding the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion, were the perfect candidates for this task. One would hold the west, the other the east, pinning down the Buddhist cultivators' forces. This would allow Kui Qi and the main assault team to strike deep and destroy the Northern Buddhists' staging ground.

Li Ximing mulled it over and agreed. "If you have orders, Daoist Friend, just summon me with a jade talisman. I acquired some artifact from the Buddhist cultivators some time ago. This might be a good opportunity to visit Chengyun."

Kui Qi laughed. "Of course! I was just about to mention it. You should coordinate with Chengyun. Given Caishan's location, if the situation turns sour, we'll need to rely on them to provide you with support."

"As for that 'Radiant Glaze Kasaya' you have, it's an extraordinary artifact. The Lotus Temple has already inquired about it; they even sent people to me. Their agents are also in the Chengyun Gate area. You can certainly exchange it for something valuable."

Li Ximing recalled how Nu Yan had used that kasaya to capture Bai Yinzi. It had emerged from that great battle completely unscathed. He had known then that it was a remarkable treasure and had been planning to trade it eventually. He just hadn't expected the Lotus Temple to seek him out first.

Li Ximing was already overdue for a trip to Chengyun Gate, both to deal with the matter concerning Wang Quwan and Wang Xiaoxiao and to trade the kasaya. He smiled and bid farewell to the others, preparing to depart on his ray of light, but Kui Qi stopped him. "A moment," he said softly.

"In five days, the Purple Smoke Gate will be celebrating Daoist Master Wenqing's breakthrough to the divine ability stage. They are hosting a grand banquet in the Purple Smoke Blessed Land and have invited cultivators from all across Jiangnan. All the Daoist Masters will be there. We would ask Zhaojing to please leave behind a wisp of your divine ability for us to... borrow."

'No wonder Zhusheng arrived first!' Li Ximing realized.

Li Ximing was stunned for only a fraction of a second before he understood. He smiled. "Excellent!"

He brought two fingers together, and a brilliant mote of Heavenly Light sparked at their tip. Kui Qi carefully gathered it into his sleeve and bowed. "A mere divine ability transformation, an ensouled wax figure sitting in the clouds. My apologies for the deception!"

A core Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery and Zhusheng of the Jade True path, combining their skills to create an illusion... forget a monk trying to divine it from thousands of miles away; even if they saw it face-to-face, they'd be fooled and turn tail.

"Not at all!"

Li Ximing departed in a ray of light. Zhusheng simply bowed to Kui Qi and said, "I dislike this Primordial Magnetism. I will wait outside the mountain."

And so, only the three core members of the Supreme Yang Dao remained in the hall. Kui Qi let out a long breath, rubbing the space between his eyebrows. "What news from Xuanmiao Temple?"

Tinglan replied, "Sumian is dead set on not getting involved. The word from his sect is that he took the ancestral portrait from the main hall, traversed the void, and left without saying another word."

Houfu made a quick calculation with his fingers. "It should still be enough," he said reassuringly. "We don't need him."

"We have no choice now but to force a decisive battle in the north!"

Kui Qi's brow furrowed deeply. "The Northern Buddhists and our Immortal Dao are not the same. Their advancement is based on vacant positions. If there are none, they just wait. They don't require the same constant, daily cultivation we do. They can afford a war of attrition, harassing us every few days. Can we?"

"We have divine abilities to master, spell arts to cultivate, spirit pills to nurture, and Spiritual Artifacts to refine! Not to mention guiding our juniors. We don't have this kind of time! If we let them drag us into endless skirmishes in this mountain range, when will we ever advance our own cultivation?"

"Furthermore, the North can attack at will, but we can't guarantee we can assemble this many allies every time. Today one person is in seclusion, tomorrow another is in the middle of a critical refinement and cannot be disturbed. Our numbers will depend on luck, and every time we call, we incur more debts!"

"Ziyu's breakthrough is the perfect cover. The Way of Compassion excels at divination; they will certainly try to scry the situation. But everyone has left a trace of their aura and a transformation art behind in the Blessed Land, all mixed together. Unless Pu Yu or Qiushui comes personally, they won't be able to get a clear reading. It's more than enough to confuse them."

He closed his eyes and let out a heavy sigh. "If we are to fight, it must be one, decisive, vicious battle. Once our allies scatter and return to their own affairs, we will be left to defend this mountain alone..."

At this, Kui Qi flicked his sleeves and stood up. Houfu added, "We can only face what comes. The worst-case scenario is that we lose Jiangbei."

...

Li Ximing traveled as a ray of light, traversing the Great Void for a time before he spotted the so-called Caishan. It was a low, squat hill, yet it was covered so densely with temples that they looked poised to crush the mountain flat beneath their weight. A dazzling Treasure Light radiated from them.

Several iridescent beams of light descended faintly from the sky, likely a few Merciful Ones channeling the power of the Buddhist Land as part of their cultivation. Li Ximing gave it a cursory glance; there were at least three of them. As for whether a Maha was present, that was impossible to tell.

'Five days will pass in the blink of an eye. I'd best use the time to trade for some intelligence. It could give us the upper hand in the chaos to come.'

Li Ximing wasn't worried about the Lotus Temple refusing to talk. The Buddhist cultivators were, after all, a deeply fractured group. The faction led by the Great Adoration Dharma Realm was particularly radical, with some members openly calling the Way of Compassion fiends. The Lotus Temple might not be virtuous, but an opportunity to gain something valuable *while simultaneously* undermining the Way of Compassion? That was a godsend they wouldn't dare pass up.

Sure enough, as Li Ximing made a show of visiting Chengyun, deliberately avoiding Caishan, he hadn't even descended to Chengshui Marsh when he saw a monk streak across the sky on a ray of golden light. The monk spotted him, his expression a mixture of shock and delight. "Daoist Friend! Daoist Friend!"

Li Ximing glanced over. The monk wore a white kasaya embroidered with pink and gold lotus flowers. With his rosy lips and white teeth, he looked more like a handsome youth. It was none other than Merciful One Minghui, whom he had met in Chengyun's territory years ago.

With the constant friction between north and south, the Lotus Temple's neutrality was a boon. Li Ximing offered him no special courtesy, merely giving a flat, formal salute. "Merciful One. A fine robe."

"Not at all, not at all!" The monk beamed, looking overjoyed. "I've been lingering in the area for some time. I wanted to head south, but I feared... causing offense. Haha, the robe in *your* hands, Daoist Friend, now *that* is a fine kasaya!"

The Lotus Temple was, after all, one of the seven great powers of the Northern Buddhists. Li Ximing cut straight to the point. "The 'Radiant Glaze Kasaya' is indeed in my possession. I hear the Lotus Temple has a need for it?"

"Indeed! Indeed!" Minghui gestured for him to follow. The two descended discreetly. Li Ximing retracted his aura, and the monk, with a simple shimmer, transformed into a black-haired, long-bearded Daoist. They walked together across the Chengshui Marsh as the monk chuckled.

"It truly must be fate. I've had my eye on that 'Radiant Glaze Kasaya' for some time, but then it was taken by Nu Yan to hunt someone down. To think it would fall into your hands, Daoist Friend, without even having a chance to display its power..."

Li Ximing watched this casual, seemingly effortless transformation. There was a profound subtlety to it, and he felt a quiet sense of apprehension.

'I've fought my share of Merciful Ones. Most only know one or two Dharma Arts, and none with this level of fluid mastery. He's also skilled in divination, as I recall... This Minghui must be a top-tier figure in the Way of Joyful Bliss, perhaps even a Merciful One personally taught by Jinlian.'

He kept his expression neutral. "Then it all depends on whether you can afford the price, Daoist Friend."

At this, Minghui waved his hands dismissively and gestured forward, yet he seemed hesitant. He kept glancing toward the distant gates of Chengyun, clearly implying something.

After all, their two factions had no friendly relations, nor any real foundation of trust. Without a neutral Daoist Master to mediate, reaching an agreement would be difficult. Li Ximing understood.

"This isn't the place to discuss such matters in broad daylight. Please, Daoist Friend, accompany me to the Chengyun Gate. We can both meet with Daoist Master Changyun, and everything can be discussed properly."

"Yes, yes, precisely."

Minghui quickly fell in step with him. They proceeded toward the Chengyun Gate, soon arriving at its mountain, Mount Yebai. There in the marsh, they were met by a Chengyun disciple.

The disciple possessed a clear, refined aura. With a resolute face, a sword at his waist, and a dignified bearing, he was the very model of an orthodox sect disciple. He recognized Minghui at a glance, bowed deeply, and said, "My lords, please wait in the pavilion. This disciple will immediately inform my Daoist Master!"



# Chapter 901: Spell Arts and Intent

Now that Minghui had arrived in this territory, he acted more like the host than the guest. He waved his hand dismissively and smiled. "There's no need for him. Let him attend to his affairs. We are merely borrowing his space!"

The disciple dared not say more and retreated at Minghui's gesture. Minghui then looked down, retrieving a tea set from a case beneath the jade table. He manipulated water and fire to begin brewing, smiling as he worked.

"I've really troubled you, Daoist friend. Being dragged into labor day after day by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... you haven't even had time for peaceful cultivation. It makes one long for the carefree days of roaming the world."

"This Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is truly tyrannical. Any cultivator who reaches the Purple Mansion Realm, if they have the slightest connection to them... they try to rope in every last one. Whether it was Chen Yin or Kuang Yu back in the day, after so many years, only Xiao Chuting has managed to get away completely unscathed. Even Tu Longjian... he had to carve off a piece of his own flesh to satisfy them before he could break free."

Li Ximing hadn't expected the monk's words to be so pointed, cursing the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition right from the start. It made Li Ximing study him for a moment. He waited until his cup was filled before speaking softly.

"I received their protection in the past. It is merely a mutual defense pact."

"Protection..."

Minghui smiled without replying, refraining from saying anything harsher. He mused internally:

'This person is a player in the grand game, but it's hard to tell which side he's on. Since he's part of the Bright Yang Wei-Li clan, he's definitely at odds with Luoxia. But does that automatically mean he's on good terms with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition?'

He took a sip of tea, a trace of apprehension in his heart. Just then, a Daoist Master hurried in from outside the hall, dressed in white soft armor with a light collar and a robe patterned with black and white feathers. Li Ximing turned and clasped his hands in greeting. Daoist Master Changyun returned the courtesy and took a seat in the hall.

"Zhaojing, it has been a long time."

Only then did he turn his gaze to Minghui. Seeing his attire, he couldn't help but frown.

"You've grown quite fond of this particular 'skin-bag' in recent years. Anyone who didn't know better would see you and mistake you for some genuine Daoist Master!"

Minghui, who had long ago transformed himself into a Daoist, currently looked the very picture of an ethereal immortal. He chuckled, "I learned the Wondrous Art of Divine Transformation from my master. I must practice it, after all."

As the two chatted, Li Ximing observed that Daoist Master Changyun seemed rushed. His Divine Ability was flickering, and he appeared somewhat listless. Although his dharma body showed no external injuries and his expression was composed, the instability in his Divine Ability was impossible to conceal.

'This Daoist Master Changyun is also injured... It seems he hasn't had an easy time of it lately, either.'

Of the many Daoist traditions in Jiangbei, Chengyun Gate was the northernmost. Logically, it shouldn't be under much pressure. After all, it was common knowledge that Daoist Master Changyun was on good terms with the Lotus Temple. The neighboring Xiu Yue Mountain Gate had already sealed itself off, and the Jingbo Gao family had no intention of pushing south. As long as Tangdao Mountain didn't fall, practically no one could threaten him.

Yet, his condition clearly wasn't good. Perhaps he had fallen prey to a scheme by the Buddhist cultivators during the scramble for the Wang family members. He was simply being polite in front of Li Ximing. Minghui, sitting between them, seemed unsurprised by this and simply said:

"Sigh... you should have someone look at that."

Daoist Master Changyun himself didn't seem worried. He waved his hand and sighed, "Zhaojing, you've had your own share of troubles recently. The moment the north makes a move, it's we who border Jiangbei who suffer. Chengyun Gate contains my life's work; I cannot simply relocate it. Otherwise, I would have followed Yehui's example and left already."

"I heard from Minghui," Li Ximing said, "that you still want the kasaya. You've asked me only to act as a witness."

Li Ximing was no Sumian; he possessed no healing Divine Abilities. His only way to help was to refine pills, and that required the other party to describe their injuries first. The matter wasn't pressing, so he paused briefly before raising the issue he had long been contemplating.

"This kasaya is only gathering dust in my hands. The north is vast; if I can exchange it for some spiritual resources, that would be ideal."

Minghui placed his palms together and smiled.

"But of course. My master is advanced in years and has met many figures of the Immortal Dao. He has also studied the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao extensively and is recognized as one of the foremost experts in spell arts among the Seven Phases. If you have any needs in this regard, Daoist friend, you have only to ask."

The last things Li Ximing lacked were cultivation methods and spell arts, so why would he ask about that? The issue was, while the Radiant Glaze Kasaya was good, it couldn't possibly compare to the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions that Zhelu and the others possessed. It was unlikely he could trade it for a complete set of high-tier spiritual materials. Still, holding onto a sliver of hope, Li Ximing asked tentatively.

"If you had a Purple Mansion Realm-grade spiritual fire... that would, of course, be best."

As soon as he said this, Daoist Master Changyun shook his head slightly. Minghui, who had observed his reaction, hesitated for a moment before replying.

"Purple Mansion Realm-grade spiritual fire is exceedingly rare, and it is a treasure highly coveted by us Buddhist cultivators. They are often collected by our brethren and consecrated within the Buddhist Land, to be refined into spell arts or Treasured Artifacts. Even if a few remain in the outside world, they are all in the hands of Maha. They are not easily obtained."

Daoist Master Changyun paused, then added, "In truth, whether it's spiritual materials or spiritual fire, anything that falls into the hands of a Merciful One must be turned over to their superiors. Private ownership is impossible. Only if the spiritual resources are of lesser value can one occasionally keep some scraps."

'Tsk...'

Li Ximing nodded, preparing to change the subject. But just then, Minghui swirled the tea in his cup and said in a low voice, "It's not entirely impossible... I do know a few channels. It's just... a single Radiant Glaze Kasaya won't be enough."

Hearing this, Li Ximing immediately brightened and nodded. "That is no obstacle. I only ask that you seek out the lead, Daoist friend. If an opportunity for an exchange arises, my Moongaze Lake will certainly not be stingy."

Minghui replied, "If you had a treasure on the level of the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl, I am confident I could make the trade for you. If you had something approaching the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions, I would even have to compensate you with additional items..."

"Good!"

Although Li Ximing felt a surge of hope, he didn't fully trust the monk. He refrained from taking out the Radiant Glaze Kasaya, settling the matter with a verbal agreement for now. This left Minghui looking somewhat regretful.

Daoist Master Changyun had been watching from the side for a long while, seemingly gathering his thoughts. Finally, he spoke, "Regarding the matter of Wang Quwan... Zhaojing, you were not present at the time. A large group was fighting over him, and fortunately, he fell into my hands and was not captured by the north. I only fear I have wronged you in this, Zhaojing."

"How could that be considered a wrong!"

Li Ximing's expression was naturally magnanimous and carefree. "Everyone assumed I would go to the Wang family," he laughed. "I feared a northern plot, so I did the opposite and went to Bai Yinzi's place instead. There is no offense to speak of. I merely congratulate you, Daoist friend, on your double fortune."

Daoist Master Changyun smiled, but the smile didn't reach his eyes. He seemed to be pondering something deeply. He merely clasped his hands and said:

"I have long known you to be broad-minded, Daoist friend. When I find the time, I will certainly pay a visit to your lake. As you have no doubt seen, I am still injured. I should have spoken to you about medicinal pills."

With the conversation having turned to this, it was no longer appropriate for Minghui to remain, even given his good relationship with Changyun. The monk performed a simple bow, gave Li Ximing a smile, and excused himself from the hall.

Daoist Master Changyun saw him out of the pavilion before returning to the table. His expression grew much more solemn. "I am injured," he said in a low voice, "but because of my Daoist tradition's particularities, I do not have many pill formulas on hand. I was hoping Daoist friend could use your discretion and refine some pills for me—something to mend damage, provide reinforcement, and heal my Divine Ability."

Li Ximing nodded slightly. This wasn't a difficult task; he could simply use the Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill as a base. It couldn't even be considered a transaction, but rather a personal favor. The man's implication was clear: his own Divine Ability was likely unsuited for alchemy, which was why he was seeking help.

He adopted a more formal tone. "It is no trouble. Mutual aid is how it should be. I have some free time in the coming days, and I can refine a batch specifically for your needs. May I ask... what is your Daoist tradition?"

Daoist Master Changyun replied in a low voice, "Geng Metal."

Li Ximing smiled and nodded. This inwardly settled Daoist Master Changyun's heart.

'Minghui provided a good pretext. While the sect will certainly provide me with pills, receiving them too often might look suspicious to certain people. Having Li Ximing here helps explain things... even if I take some high-quality medicine and recover unusually quickly, it won't raise alarms.'

...

Qinling Temple.

Qinling Temple was located very close to the border between north and south. It currently fell under no Buddhist Land's jurisdiction, calling itself only the Qinling Daoist tradition. It relied on the protection of the 'Wrath' and a minor 'Multicolored light' inheritance, having cleverly produced a Merciful One. In its heyday, it had the air of a minor Buddhist Land.

Now it had fallen into decline. The temple was small and desolate. Although its current head, the Merciful One Liaokong, had rebuilt one corner, the majority of the grounds were ruins from ages past—empty of people, filled only with the clamor of birds.

*Clack...*

A man was pacing in the courtyard. He was dressed in simple robes of black and dark grey, wore a Daoist crown, and had a small gourd and six short swords tied at his waist. He had a long face and phoenix eyes, possessing a natural grace and bearing that would make any onlooker sigh in admiration.

His movements, however, were entirely mortal. He gently righted a chipped stone table in the courtyard, pulled up a stone stool, and brushed the dust from their surfaces. Only then did he retrieve a stone flask and two small cups from his sleeve.

The flask's exterior was rustic, its spiritual light concealed. The moment he set it on the table, the faint sound of rushing water emerged from it.

The night was deep. In the distance, the mountain range lay dormant under the heavy moonlight, shrouded in dark mist. The middle-aged man waited. Soon, he heard footsteps, accompanied by the soft crunch of sand and grit on the broken stone steps.

A tall, lean sword cultivator entered from outside. His robes were black and white, his hair and beard immaculate. He, too, wore a gourd at his waist, one that looked identical to the other man's.

It was the Great Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery—Lou Xing.

Autumn was at its deepest, and leaves drifted on the wind. The sword cultivator sat at the table without a word. The middle-aged man also remained silent, quietly lifting the flask to pour the wine.

"It has been many years. Your Way of the Sword, Daoist friend, has grown even more profound."

Lou Xing did not answer. Beneath his strong, sharp brow, his eyes gleamed. "Seeing your current state, Daoist Friend Xue," he said lightly, "you have clearly repaired your life-mandate. This is not your first life, is it."

The man before him was indeed the Great Daoist Master of Mount Luoxia, Xueyang. His Divine Ability was perfected, yet he gave off the air of still water running deep, revealing nothing. Hearing Lou Xing's words, Xueyang drained his cup. His phoenix eyes narrowed slightly as he rose to his feet.

"That is correct. Over two hundred years ago, my Five Methods reached great completion. I repaired my life-mandate and focused on mastering wondrous arts. I already had a chance to contend for the Rainbow Glow Auxiliary Position..."

"But after I paid my respects to my master, he tested me. He determined my Dao foundation was ultimately too shallow, and I was not worthy of the position. He had me wash away my Divine Ability and reincarnate. It took many years to be found again. I re-cultivated the Five Methods, and, the path being familiar, I easily reached my current standing."

Lou Xing listened quietly, his eyes fixed on him. "The Upper Sect," he said flatly, "is still considerate of its own. I vaguely recall when I was the Xiukui's Choosen One, my master made some jests. He spoke eloquently, but it's a pity I was too dull to grasp it all. I only remember the last few lines."

Xueyang did not respond, merely pouring more wine into his own cup with a calm expression. Lou Xing, however, stood up. A smile touched his face as he drained his cup, and his words became even more direct.

"He said that the old books wrote: 'The treasured visage anoints the fertile earth in vain, while the Geng-origin dares to steal the golden merit.' This was already cause for endless sighs. But I see now that this is wrong. Future generations should write: 'The Dark Channel forbids the Azure Ram's crossing, and forces the Monarch to worship the martial.'"

Hearing this, Xueyang set down his cup. He took a step forward and shook his head. "That is quite unnecessary!"

The atmosphere between them grew suddenly tense. The Great Daoist Master of Mount Luoxia's brow furrowed deeply as he stared at Daoist Master Lou Xing. The sword cultivator opposite him gave not an inch, meeting his gaze directly. "Unnecessary?" Lou Xing's voice was cold.

"The people of this world, from north to south, are treated as meat on a chopping block! They flatter and fawn, prostrating themselves upon the ground. The true dragons and phoenixes have gone into hiding. All the 'Phases' obey your commands, not daring to defy! One as mighty as the Wei Emperor was left to die like livestock in a field! One as noble as the Liang King was drowned in the Jianghuai! As for Qi and Zhao, they have become mere concubines for others' sport! Is that not enough?!"

"The proud immortal scions of Tianwu, annihilated in an instant! The magnificent dignity of Zhongxia, handed over to barbarians! Hetian and Yinzhou are distant, so one mountain Sea-Pacifying Center and the Northern Sea's Azurecliff Expanse are besieged by the Five Gates..."

"Is there any place left in this world that you people *cannot* touch?!"

Lou Xing's expression was grim as he stared at the Great Daoist Master, his voice low and guttural, as if grinding the words between his teeth.

"Is it still not enough? How much more must you take before it is?!"

"You..."

Xueyang watched him, seemingly unmoved by his outburst. His hand rested on the jade cup as he spoke softly.

"Jiangnan's spine was broken with Li Jiangqun's generation. Once you, Lou Xing, are also gone, will there be a single person left in Jiangnan worthy of being called a successor of the Supreme Yang? You think Luoxia is merciless, but sometimes... it is you people who are too attached. The world changes according to the will of its people. As for the shifting of Fruition Attainment, it is the nature of the Immortal Dao to strive and prove oneself. What sense is there in assigning blame?"

"Do not speak of Li Jiangqun!"

Lou Xing flung his sleeves and turned his back on Xueyang. "Though he and I walked different paths," he said in a cold voice, "he was a true gentleman. Now, I finally understand. You left Zimu, and I wonder—was it because he truly stands apart from the mortal world, or was it merely to make yourselves appear merciful?"

Xueyang finally sighed. The six short swords at his waist vibrated slightly.

"To remain unstained by the mortal world *is* the Immortal Dao."

Daoist Master Lou Xing's black and white robes billowed without wind, and the gourd at his waist began to hum. A sword materialized from the void, his hand slowly grasping its hilt.

The blade was a pure, silver-white, reflecting no external light, as if brand new. It was two-point-nine-three *chi* long. As the sword immortal gripped the short hilt, the only color on the weapon was a single, striking vermilion dot, set precisely on the spine of the blade.

A violent wind howled, sending sand and stones flying. The autumn gale shrieked. The six short swords at Xueyang's waist vanished. In their place, six majestic columns of colored light erupted into the sky. They converged behind him, each three *chi* long, their bases aligned and their points facing outward, forming a floating screen of blades.

The Great Daoist Master of Mount Luoxia's tone finally carried a trace of complexity.

"We shared wine and laughter in years past. I never thought you would be the one to die by my hand."

The sword immortal before him seemed to hear nothing. He unfastened his gourd and placed it gently on the stone table. It landed with a crisp, clear *clink*, as pleasant as the sound of jade beads striking one another.

Before the sound had faded, the six pillars of colored light behind Xueyang rocketed into the heavens. They tore through the howling autumn wind, punching straight through the clouds and vanishing into the desolate, sunless night. They left six vibrant contrails in their wake, which slithered and danced across the sky.

They moved like six-plumed dragons in the night sky, churning the clouds into a roiling sea. A great peal of thunder boomed. In an instant, the six massive constructs had gathered their full might and began to plummet from the heavens.

Xueyang hovered in the night air, a halo of multi-colored light radiating from behind his head. His eyes shone like stars, as profound as a deity's. His lips parted, and a deep, majestic, vibrating tone echoed across the world.

"I will not underestimate you!"

Lou Xing stood on the ground and looked up. Dark clouds roiled overhead as the six colored blades converged on his position. He watched the colors grow larger in his pupils, his hand never leaving the hilt of his sword.

*Clang!*

A sheet of white light surged up from the ground and rippled outward. The flagstones, the remnants of old formations, the broken walls—all of it disintegrated instantly, dissolving into an endless grey wind. The Great Void itself resonated in response, emitting a piercing, metallic shriek.




# Chapter 902: Wujiang

The vast waters of the Chengshui Marsh stretched endlessly, lined with forests of towering cedar. The surface was a mirror of tranquil azure, a stark contrast to the scenery of a typical lake. Li Ximing moved forward, treading upon the Heavenly Light, yet he remained utterly silent, his own form indistinct.

After flying for more than ten li, he was surprised to see more and more cultivators. All of them had their heads bowed, scouring the area for something. In the distance, he spotted a small grotto in the water, near which stood several pavilions, guarded by another group of cultivators. One sweep of Li Ximing's spiritual sense was enough to detect the powerful and unusual water veins flowing far beneath.

His elder, Li Qinghong, had mentioned this place. She had said it was a rare channel where earth veins and water veins merged, running uninterrupted all the way to the Eastern Sea and connecting to the maritime border of the Chunyi Dao Gate. Based on the current scene, it was clear the Chengyun Gate had taken control of it.

What gave him pause, however, was not the location's significance. It was a purple-red fragment of a dharma artifact, smooth and sharp-edged, that the cultivators below were fiercely fighting to possess. Li Ximing's eyes narrowed. With a light flick of his sleeve...

...a fierce wind howled. The Heavenly Light blazed down, blinding the cultivators below. In that instant, the fragment shot upward, landing in Li Ximing's hand as he hovered high above the clouds.

It looked familiar. On closer inspection, he realized it must have come from a large, purple-red cauldron. Judging by the intricate patterns and the fineness of the shard, the original item must have shattered into hundreds, if not thousands, of pieces, scattered far and wide...

'That's right, it was from Yu Yuwei. A bronze cauldron, marked by the Touba, which fell into my hands. I gave it to Li Quantao... No wonder hundreds of cultivators are gathered here searching. It's a fragment of a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, after all. Even a small piece is worth a significant amount.'

Yu Yuwei had been killed by the Chunyi Dao Gate. The cauldron ended up with Qiuxin, who eventually presented it to Li Ximing. The Yu family was in complete disarray, posing no threat, and the artifact ultimately benefited Li Quantao. Because it had passed through his own hands, the memory was still fresh. This was, without a doubt, that same cauldron.

This cauldron was a Yu family heirloom, made from high-quality materials. Back then, it had taken a direct hit from an ancient Touba dharma artifact and escaped with only a single mark. To shatter it this completely... the power required must have been far beyond the Foundation Establishment Realm.

His brow furrowed. A sense of unease settled over him.

'Was Li Quantao truly recalled so urgently? He returned to the sect, yet he hasn't sent a single letter...'

The tasks arranged by Ning Wan and Tinglan had subtly pointed toward the Hongxue Gate. Back then, Jiangbei was in chaos. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition could barely fend for itself, let alone send aid. It wouldn't have been surprising if Li Quantao had fallen in battle; there would be no reason to hide it. But the official story was a recall, and now he's vanished. That is... suspicious.

'If he isn't in seclusion recovering from grave injuries, then Azure Pond must have truly stumbled upon some great opportunity. Ning Wan is preoccupied with the north and has no energy for these games. This whole situation... I can't tell who's truly benefiting from it!'

If Li Quantao truly did find an opportunity, Ning Wan would likely be reasonable and not take any drastic measures. But from Li Quantao's perspective... a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator can't be everywhere at once. Wouldn't it be better to keep the spoils for himself? Li Ximing shook his head with a wry smile. He casually tossed the fragment back down and ascended on his light.

He had only been flying for a short while when the jade talisman at his waist began to pulse with warmth—a sign that an ally was near. Li Ximing paused, slightly surprised. He released the Divine Ability that was sealing it. The water below rippled as a figure approached, riding the wind.

The man's face was ordinary enough, but his black robes were covered in a dense, unsettling pattern of eyeball-like objects. This gruesome attire lent his otherwise normal features a sinister, heretical air. Li Ximing recognized the garment instantly. He took a cautious step back and spoke:

"Daoist Luo!"

This was indeed Daoist Master Luo, the native Daoist Master from the shamanic kingdoms of the Southern Borderlands who had fought alongside him in the rescue mission!

The Daoist Master smiled and moved to greet him.

"Daoist Zhaojing! It has been a long time!"

He was originally one of the Eastern Yue people, and his real name was likely as uncouth as Jiao Zhongzi or Fu Daomu. His name just happened to start with the character 'Luo,' so to curry favor with the Supreme Yang cultivators, he claimed it as his surname. His face was a mask of smiles as he continued:

"I received word from Daoist Ning. I've just come from the Tangdao Mountains, riding the wind to assist you!"

The pieces clicked into place for Li Ximing.

'Kui Qi has to travel with the Chunyi Dao Gate. Setting aside their shared Supreme Yang origins, they are, at least, proper, orthodox cultivators. They couldn't possibly bring this man along. The Chunyi Dao Gate would probably draw their swords on sight...

'Tinglan likely has her own reinforcements, so he'd be unwelcome there too. My task is here at Caishan, and we *have* met before, so they decided to push him onto me...

'They should have told me about this, but we were interrupted by Zhusheng. It wouldn't have been appropriate to discuss such... arrangements... in front of him. So they had to drop it.'

Kui Qi might be from Xiukui, and he carried himself with a certain reserved pride, but his mind was clearly sharp. This was a time to rally all available strength, and he had made his arrangements well.

Despite the signal from the jade talisman, Li Ximing remained wary of the man. He asked:

"That alone isn't proof."

Daoist Master Luo laughed, completely unfazed.

"I already asked Lord Kui Qi about this. He gave me this jade talisman, predicting you wouldn't trust me!"

He made an inviting gesture and smiled. A wisp of purple qi descended from the Great Void, coalescing into a purple-robed female immortal. Her face was lovely, with bright eyes and a delicate oval shape—he knew at once it was a projection of Tinglan.

"My thanks for your trouble, Daoist."

She gently proffered a stone box. Maintaining the projection this far had clearly been a strain; she nodded once and dissipated. Li Ximing watched her go. Tinglan's face had been smiling, but he had seen the worry hidden in her eyes.

The stone box was heavy in his hand. He didn't need to guess; even through the stone, Li Ximing could feel the familiar, comforting power of Bright Yang.

'The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!'

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass was one of Xiukui's greatest treasures. Anyone who cultivated the path of Bright Yang would recognize it instantly. Li Ximing immersed his spiritual sense into the box and confirmed it: there lay the golden-white compass.

He discreetly slipped it into his sleeve, his mind already weighing the implications.

'Strange... Kan Ziyu's breakthrough must have been too sudden for her to retrieve it in time. Still, getting it now... it's not too late!'

Li Ximing secured the item, feeling a measure of relief.

'This Daoist Master Luo is, at worst, an expert with two Divine Abilities. Even if he's prone to holding back, he's still a significant asset. This provides some peace of mind...'

He joined Daoist Master Luo in the Great Void, where they found a place to rest. While making idle conversation, Li Ximing discreetly activated his arts to observe Caishan from a distance.

His high vantage point swept across the mountain range, revealing everything. There were only four Golden Bodies present and no one else. Nothing to fear.

However, after the last major defeat, the weaker Buddhist cultivators from the Way of Emptiness had either perished or been forced to restart their cultivation. Of the four present, two were at least at the Developing Wisdom level and wielded Treasured Artifacts. One of the four, however, looked different. He appeared to be an ordinary man, lacking the massive Golden Body of his companions, yet the other three treated him with profound respect.

Even so, two of them were clearly mediocre. For both Li Ximing and Daoist Master Luo to act together seemed like overkill.

'Against this pitiful lineup, sending Luo alone would have been sufficient. He might not have been able to defeat all four, but he could have easily stalled them!'

'With both of us here, forget stalling—even killing a few of them will be easy!'

He relaxed immediately and exchanged a few pleasantries with Luo. Unexpectedly, the man's demeanor shifted, and he clasped his hands formally.

"I must sincerely implore Daoist Zhaojing to give his all this time. It would be best if we can eliminate them... The truth is... I absolutely cannot miss this opportunity!"

This was not the kind of thing he expected Luo to say. Li Ximing was momentarily stunned. Before he could respond, the demonic cultivator had seized the initiative, his expression grave, his tone almost pleading.

"I didn't have the qualifications to enter that True Qi Anhuai Heaven. I have sought a certain cultivation art for many years, and only found a lead through Daoist Ning. After I helped last time, I finally received concrete news—the art is of even higher quality than I had hoped. If I miss this... I may never even get the chance to touch the threshold of the Purple Mystery in this lifetime!"

He had already cultivated two Divine Abilities. This art was likely the key he needed to touch the threshold of the Purple Mystery, and he needed to secure it soon to have enough time for the subsequent cultivation. The opportunity was clearly precious. Li Ximing, however, was in no rush. He simply asked:

"What path do you cultivate, Daoist?"

Daoist Master Luo replied hastily:

"It is an obscure Daoist tradition... called 'Gathering Wood.' It has little reputation nowadays. You must think it laughable."

"'Gathering Wood'..."

It was indeed a rare path. Most Wood-aspect cultivators were in the north. As Li Ximing mused on this, the demonic cultivator, eager to curry favor, quickly added with a smile:

"The 'Ji' character means 'to gather'—it depicts birds (隹) on a tree (木). It signifies cultivators assembling, like a flock of birds coming to roost. It was once a very broad Daoist tradition with many followers, though it has fallen into obscurity. Fortunately, it is quite harmonious with the Three Yang paths. There should be ample opportunity for cooperation in the future!"

He wasn't wrong, but Li Ximing had no intention of getting too close to him. He said little more. Several days passed in a flash. When the jade talismans at their waists lit up in unison, they nodded to each other and exited the Great Void.

The sky was gloomy. Dark clouds massed in the north, and the sea of clouds above roiled like a violent ocean, as if some colossal beast were swimming within. Li Ximing's brows twitched, an inexplicable sense of unease creeping into his heart.

'This is not a good omen... Has something happened in the north...?'

But the arrow was already nocked; he had to act. Li Ximing stepped forward, channeling his Divine Ability as he roared:

"Strike!"

Radiant Heavenly Light instantly descended. Colorful clouds above Caishan roiled and vanished. The Buddhist cultivators lacked conventional spiritual arrays; their formations always used the Merciful Ones themselves as nexuses to channel the light of the Buddhist Land. They excelled at surrounding and overwhelming their foes.

Thus, before any Divine Ability even manifested, the sprawling complex of temples—layered high and low across the mountain like thick moss—began to tremble. Sand and stone poured from their structures. Amidst a rolling cloud of gray dust, they collapsed.

A brilliant white Celestial Gate descended from the heavens. Unfortunately, the four Merciful Ones were not grouped together. The blazing Divine Ability slammed down, instantly suppressing two of the rising Golden Bodies. The remaining two stared in shock. One cried out in terror:

"'Audience with the Celestial Gate'!"

The other, the one who looked like a mortal, showed no fear, only rage. He cursed:

"You jackal! How dare you!"

But they had no time to react. Billowing, dark green smoke erupted from the mountain, appearing even thicker under the brilliant light. Daoist Master Luo, draped in his thousand-eyed demonic robe, stepped out of the air. He held a bladed dharma artifact and grinned with malevolence.

"Shavelings!"

He raised his hand and tossed out a flask. It flashed with light, and a pale white water splashed out, instantly dispersing the smoke and calming the spiritual winds. As the light faded, black qi surged forth, entangling the two Golden Bodies.

He fought with the typical abandon of a demonic cultivator, black qi rolling everywhere, which made even Li Ximing's expression darken. The demon, however, showed no restraint. The flask's power seemed weak and clearly wouldn't hold for long. After briefly binding the two, he thrust one hand downward in a lifting motion.

Immediately, two beams of jade-green light emerged from the mist. One was clear and light as wind, floating dozens of feet high; the other was heavy and turbid as earth, slithering along the ground. Daoist Master Luo stomped his foot, shaking the very mountain, and laughed.

"Rise!"

The ground-level beam of light drilled into the earth. In an instant, tendrils of green light surged up from the sand, sprouting and flourishing, transforming the entire area into a sparkling, jade-green sea.

The Merciful Ones' Golden Bodies wavered, emitting a discordant clamor, a sign that their concentration was broken. Their expressions turned grim; they were clearly trapped for the moment.

Neither of them was a stranger to fighting the Merciful Ones. These Buddhist cultivators had simplistic methods and were vulnerable to specialized arts. Suppress them from the start, and they rarely recovered. But seeing Daoist Master Luo's true power, Li Ximing cursed inwardly:

'What kind of art *is* that? Last time we fought... he was clearly holding back. Massively. The moment his own profit is on the line, he finally gets serious...'

He cursed, but his actions were swift. His own skillset might be limited, but it was devastatingly effective against Buddhist cultivators, striking them where it hurt most. He spat a stream of fire and channeled his Divine Ability.

But Li Ximing observed them closely. The Buddhist cultivators below were flustered, yes, but not truly panicked. There was an unsettling calm about them as they used their Golden Bodies to resist. The hatred and malice in their eyes and curses were far stronger than their fear.

The unease in his heart grew. He hesitated for a fraction of a second before drawing Reveal River and merging his form with the flames.

The cultivator Li Ximing was suppressing was mediocre, so he had no trouble. But just as Daoist Master Luo's art trapped the other two, the mortal-looking leader's expression changed, and he sucked in a sharp breath.

His 'treasure belly,' which he cradled with one hand, suddenly expanded as if being inflated. In an instant, it was the size of a house, and he broke free from the jade sea. It swelled twice more, and a brilliant light bulged from the center of the jade-white stomach. From within that light, two naked Arhats leaped out.

The Arhats were majestic and powerful, with clearly defined muscles. One held a staff, the other a sword. They wore necklaces of black beads and rode on brilliant light as they lunged at Daoist Master Luo.

"The Way of Compassion!"

Daoist Master Luo's expression turned foul. He flicked his sleeves, and rolling, blue-black qi surged up, flowing back into his robes as he shouted:

"Go!"

The two streams of blue-black qi shot out like chains, binding the Arhats. But the Treasure Light flared, and the qi sizzled and burned. Worse, as the Arhats broke free, the Buddhist cultivator's large belly deflated, though it remained the size of a man. He rose on the wind, gently rubbing the jade-white surface. The skin bulged, and a face—two eyes and a mouth—opened upon it!

The two eyes glowed with a purple light and simultaneously shot out a blinding, majestic radiance—a power to vanquish demons—that seared straight toward the demonic cultivator.

But Daoist Master Luo was no pushover. He shook his robes, and all thousand eyes upon it released their own dazzling golden glare, scattering the purple radiance. The demonic cultivator's expression was grim as he snarled:

"The Way of Compassion again! This old master's spirit robe was refined specifically to counter your kind!"

But the advantage was short-lived. In the time it took to exchange those two blows, the Developing Wisdom-level Merciful One on the ground had broken free, neutralizing the white water, and was rising on the wind.

"Fiend!"

Daoist Master Luo, possessing two Divine Abilities, was not afraid. On the contrary, he was inwardly gleeful:

'I can just stall these two. Can they wound me? Kill me? I doubt it. But over on Li Ximing's side... how long can *you* lot possibly stall *him*?'

The two monks' decision was undoubtedly correct. Li Ximing's Divine Abilities might not have been overwhelmingly superior, but his power to sever their connection to the Buddhist Land was far more decisive. The demonic cultivator battled the Buddhist cultivators, and the fight escalated. Golden light rippled, blue-gray qi scattered, and his demonic robes billowed. The sky grew darker. He was just getting warmed up, not yet sated, when the sound of shattering glass echoed.

*BOOM!*

A pink light burst forth within the Bright Yang radiance, and a rain of flower petals drifted down. The sky darkened rapidly. From within the raging True Fire, Li Ximing drew his axe, having already struck a killing blow against one of his opponents.

Without Immeasurable Water and Fire, dealing with two opponents was not as easy as it had been during the Tangdao victory. Li Ximing focused on killing one first. As the monk perished, an endless pink light erupted, causing the Audience with the Celestial Gate to shudder.

The other monk was ready. He thrust his four arms upward, using the shockwave of his companion's demise to heave against the Celestial Gate, shaking it. The Golden Body's face was twisted in a ferocious snarl, its lips barely moving:

'Fiend, prepare to die!'

Buddhist cultivators could indeed reincarnate, but the loss of a Dharma Body was always a grievous blow. The more fearlessly this one acted, the more uneasy Li Ximing became. But he couldn't let him escape. Li Ximing formed a hand seal. Instantly, four ribbons of bright white light appeared, wrapping tightly around the Golden Body and binding it.

'Radiant Celestial Wave Art!'

The Heavenly Light at his brow flared as he locked on with Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.

But before the brilliant Heavenly Light could be unleashed, a profound chill seized his heart, like a blade pressed to his back. Without hesitation, he aborted Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. His form vanished, and he reappeared, sitting cross-legged atop the Celestial Gate itself.

*Om...*

As the white-gold-robed figure settled down from the void, a wave of Heavenly Light rippled outward. It swept through the layered clouds, bringing a pulse of brilliance to the gloomy sky, and seemed to touch something unseen, eliciting a subtle hum.

This defensive move cost him the perfect moment to strike, almost allowing the monk to escape. Fortunately, his opponent was not strong. Reveal River faltered, and the Radiant Celestial Wave Art snapped, but it was enough to keep him imprisoned. Li Ximing pushed his Divine Ability to its limit, barely managing to pin the man beneath the gate, immobilizing him.

But Li Ximing, sitting cross-legged, paid no attention to the trapped monk. He took a deep breath, shifted his Divine Abilities, and recalled his True Fire. He faced the sky, staring silently at the dark clouds, his pupils wide.

Amidst the gloomy clouds stood a man.

He was remarkably handsome, appearing to be in his thirties or forties, with the high-bridged nose and deep-set eyes characteristic of the Mobei northern deserts. His expression was stern and cold as he stood with his hands clasped behind his back.

The man wore black and silver armor, an outer robe fluttering in the wind. Three weapons hung at his waist, perfectly aligned: a long sword, a short blade, and a dharma whip, all glowing faintly.

Faint traces of a movement Divine Ability's light, not yet fully dissipated, shimmered behind him... He had clearly just arrived.

What truly silenced Li Ximing was the man's cultivation base:

'Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm! He's a Daoist cultivator!'

Meeting Li Ximing's gaze, the middle-aged man remained unhurried, apparently unconcerned about the Merciful One trapped beneath the Celestial Gate. He stared intently at Li Ximing, and his deep, heavy voice echoed:

"Helian Wujiang of the Tiefu Kingdom. Greetings, Daoist."

His voice thundered through the night sky, echoing endlessly. The sound caused Daoist Master Luo to pale in fright, while the two Merciful Ones became ecstatic. Down in the ruins, the Master Monks cheered and began to prostrate themselves in worship.

'The Helian family!'

A chill shot through Li Ximing's heart. The name flashed in his mind, followed by a dreadful realization:

'Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm! This is no newly ascended expert. This must be the pillar who has supported the Helian family for decades. And they've sent him here!'

'What does this mean!'

He had long known the Helian of Tiefu were not insignificant, just cursed with a poor location. They had once produced a genius, Helian Fan, but he had been besieged and killed. For the last century, they had failed to produce another notable talent and had been struggling. Only in recent years, when a new junior broke through, had they finally gotten some breathing room.

Even a cultivator as far away as Jiangnan knew of the Helian family's plight, surrounded as they were by predators. It was clear how difficult their lives had been. If sending out Helian Wumeng was a sign they were finally stable and looking to expand their influence south... the appearance of Helian Wujiang changed the nature of the situation entirely.

'For two Helian Purple Mansion Realm experts to come south without worrying about their rear... someone must have mediated the situation in the northern deserts! What does this mean? Was the mediator the Lord of Compassion?'

The Helian family was based in Hetao, where they had their own kingdom, Tiefu. They directly bordered Zhao State, near Longxi, and had always been a vassal to Zhao State. The Murong of the Way of Compassion, however, were in the far-off Yan State. One was in the west, the other in the east; they were worlds apart!

It wasn't that the Way of Compassion lacked the power to mediate, but this was far outside their sphere of influence. Why go to such trouble? Furthermore, based on his timing, the man had *just* arrived. How could it be such a perfect coincidence?

'Kui Qi's plan must have succeeded in part. Otherwise, this man wouldn't be *just* arriving; he would have been lying in ambush all along. And these Buddhist cultivators wouldn't have been caught off guard; they would have feigned surprise while secretly preparing a formation...'

If tiny Caishan warranted a Helian Wujiang, then who was leading the forces on the boundless Luoxia Plain? And what about Xiaoshi Mountain, the side gate guarding the end of the Tangdao Mountain Range?

'Is this still just a simple southern advance by the Buddhist cultivators?'

The thought sent a chill through his entire body. But the current situation allowed no time for deliberation. The man before him had already placed a hand on his waist. He bowed his head slightly, though his deep-set eyes never left Li Ximing.

"By order of the State Preceptor, I came south to garrison Caishan. I traveled day and night, fearing I would fail my orders. I did not expect to encounter an Imperial Scion. My apologies."

Helian Wujiang spoke of apologies, but his face remained an emotionless mask. His pale hand brushed past the sword and the blade, finally grasping the long Spiritual Artifact whip. With a soft click, he unfastened it.

*BOOM!*

Dazzling lightning flashed, and a torrential downpour began to fall. A chill shot down Li Ximing's spine. As his opponent raised his hand, he could faintly see heavy, dark shadows flickering through the rain, sometimes near, sometimes far.

The light from his brow shot out, but it was caught by those venomous shadows, circled once, and shattered into scattered golden flecks. Li Ximing's eyes blazed. Layer after layer of light from the Sun's Resonant Parting Art materialized before him, forming shimmering barriers in the rain.

*BANG!*

The blue-yellow radiance of Reveal River rippled through the air, descending like a wave. A deafening explosion followed. The light of the Sun's Resonant Parting Art detonated in a spray of white-hot sparks, instantly evaporating all rain within a wide radius.

*BOOM!*

Thunder rumbled again, a clash of light and shadow. Li Ximing heard his opponent's sharp, clear voice drift through the rain:

"Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. A technique of the Cui family."



# Chapter 903: The Cloud and Smoke Finally Rise

‘Do I block him or not…’

Facing this Daoist Master from the north in the midst of the downpour, Li Ximing hesitated for an instant.

Helian Wujiang's appearance here proved that the northern forces were already mobilizing southward. However, Kui Qi's strength was not to be underestimated. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had more hidden cards than his own side. Under a full-scale assault, the north might not be able to hold…

‘I have to at least stall him. There's no reason to retreat without even crossing blades…’

He didn't spare the attention to check on Daoist Master Luo. The whistling blue-grey aura within his spiritual sense was proof enough—self-interest moved all hearts. With him standing against Helian Wujiang, this demon cultivator from the Southern Borderlands had no intention of leaving.

But even though Daoist Master Luo hadn't fled, he was already looking over his shoulder, his eyes fixed on Li Ximing, ready to escape at any moment. If the cultivation art weren't so crucial, and if he didn't have some faith in the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, he probably would have bolted long ago.

Helian Wujiang stood upon the clouds, a long whip coiling like a serpent in his hand. Before Li Ximing could react further, the cultivator gathered his energy. He formed a two-finger seal between his eyes, assuming a stance of focused, distant gazing.

Seizing that brief opening, Li Ximing reacted instantly. The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger transformed into a barrier of colored light, shielding his front. On his other side, a celestial gate shimmered, and without hesitation, he soared into the heavens.

In this life-or-death crisis, killing the Merciful One was no longer realistic. If he turned back towards the pass, his Divine Ability, Audience with the Celestial Gate, which required his full concentration, would be exposed to the enemy's blade. Even if the gate itself was tough without its suppression effect, allowing a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with three Divine Abilities to attack it freely… Li Ximing would be coughing up blood and fleeing. He couldn't hold out. It was better to protect himself!

The Merciful One he had just released transformed into a streak of Treasure Light and fled. It had barely reappeared in the air when a bone dagger materialized from the Great Void, shooting straight for its brow.

Li Ximing couldn't spare it a thought. His opponent, Helian Wujiang, already had a mass of black lightning gathering between his fingers. Baleful Qi surged in his eyes as he aimed his fingers forward.

‘Hai-Attribute Baleful Celestial Thunder!’

At once, dark clouds gathered. The lightning between heaven and earth answered the call of his fingertips, turning an inky black as it descended from the sky with a cascade of thunderous roars.

This Celestial Thunder was saturated with Baleful Qi. It was a translucent, obsidian black, and its speed was astonishing.

The first thing in its path was the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. The bright jade bead spun slightly, and the engraved pattern of a tiger looking back instantly released the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen!

"Boom!"

Celestial Thunder was one of the three great thunders. His opponent had also cultivated Baleful Qi, making this an incredibly powerful Dharma Art. But the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen was of the Earth Virtue. First, it could suppress rampant lightning, and second, it could draw out Baleful Qi. It actually began to glow with unprecedented brilliance.

The Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen had been in Li Ximing's hands for many years, but this was the first time it had shone so brightly. If Daoist Master Changxi himself were here, relying on this Spiritual Artifact, he might have actually been able to block the Celestial Thunder!

Even in Li Ximing's hands, the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen still managed to stall the Celestial Thunder for a single instant before it was blasted to ashes by the flashing baleful lightning.

For a Purple Mansion Realm expert, an instant was enough to do far too much. It was enough time for him to raise the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, to channel a Spiritual Artifact, or even to step into the Great Void.

But Li Ximing suppressed the urge to raise the compass. He ascended to the Radiant Pass and lifted his Divine Ability. The distinct, white-jade gatehouses shimmered, and the searing Heavenly Light in its center tore through the rainy night.

Instead of defending, he counter-attacked. The majestic celestial gate surged forward, intending to suppress his opponent's Dharma Body.

Li Ximing had already recognized how formidable that whip was. The Spiritual Artifacts in his possession were too cumbersome to counter it. His only chance was to attack as defense, forcing his opponent to fight under the pressure of his Divine Ability!

‘But this Helian Wujiang hasn't even drawn his sword... He's not using his full strength…’

The thought flashed through his mind as the Reveal River manifested. Blue-green and yellow patterns of mountains and rivers rippled outward, layer upon layer. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd in his other hand flew back, hovering above him and erupting in brilliant light.

Radiance!

A faint bell toll echoed as a pale white luster rippled out, coating Li Ximing in a pure white film. This was the buffing effect of Radiance.

But the white luster didn't stop there. It spread rapidly, drifting lightly onto Daoist Master Luo, dyeing his Dharma Body with the same pale, brilliant white.

The effect of Radiance: buffing allies!

Daoist Master Luo was briefly stunned. Puffs of black smoke began to rise from his collar. The Bright Yang Dao was bright and righteous; although it complemented his own Divine Abilities, it was not at all friendly to the heretical dharma robe he wore.

But he showed no worry or alarm. Instead, his face lit up with joy. He hooked his little finger into his collar, gave it a tug, and stripped off the Thousand-Eye Demon Robe. With a flick of his forearm, he tossed it. The robe flew out, spinning, and transformed into a cloth-like dharma artifact. Golden light flashed from its thousand eyes, captivating the soul.

He swayed his body slightly, basking in the Radiance buff, and rejoiced inwardly:
‘This old master never misjudges! Even a broken house has its foundations. How much more an Imperial Scion? I knew he'd have plenty of good things! Looks like I'll be counting on him.’

Having received the buff, Daoist Master Luo's attacks became even more vicious. But the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen was already broken. The incoming Celestial Thunder locked on, colliding with the surging Divine Ability and purple flames on Li Ximing's Dharma Body with a deafening screech.

"Rumble!"

"Good!"

Helian Wujiang saw that Li Ximing, far from fleeing, was attacking, bringing Audience with the Celestial Gate down to suppress him. He stopped the Dharma Art in his hand, and the subsequent lightning dissipated. He switched to pressing his hand to his sword, channeling a Divine Ability. The two-finger seal at his nose moved down, stopping in front of his lips as he blew out a cloud of Baleful Qi.

This Baleful Qi was a sickly grey-yellow. It drifted and danced in the air, pulsing with shockwave-like halos as Helian Wujiang exhaled. Celestial Thunder still rolled across Li Ximing's body, but he didn't pause. He turned to the side, formed his own seal, and spat fire.

Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire!

His family's Intercalary Sun Art once mentioned: 'Water and fire flourish, thus they can be commanded. Wood and stone are firm, thus they can be crafted.' Spiritual Water and Spiritual Fire had an innate nature that allowed them to be commanded by cultivators, making them exceptionally precious. Helian Wujiang's Baleful Qi was a baleful spiritual substance refined into his art, and it was likewise at the Purple Mansion Realm level.

Now, True Fire and Baleful Qi, both at the Purple Mansion Realm level, collided. They erupted in all kinds of flames, burning away the spiritual qi and dimming the light of Divine Abilities. They even transformed into specks of violet-black fire-flowers, turning the entire mountain into a sea of flame.

This was the first time since Li Ximing obtained his True Fire that he had encountered a commandable spiritual substance of the same level. Helian Wujiang exhaled the Baleful Qi with ease, as if it were enhanced by a Divine Ability. Mixed with Multicolored light, it twisted into various wondrous shapes in the air, vast in quantity, and instantly suppressed the True Fire.

But Li Ximing raised the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. Empowered by the wondrous Flame-Spitting ability, the True Fire blazed bright and fierce. Its inherent quality was high, and even though it was at a disadvantage, it still managed to hold back the Baleful Qi.

‘But it's enough!’

This brief moment of obstruction was all he needed. Audience with the Celestial Gate was already pressing down above Helian Wujiang's head.

Helian Wujiang merely smiled. He tugged at the long robe on his back, channeled his Baleful Qi, and tapped the ground lightly. Endless black shadows surged up behind him, covering the land. They transformed into over a hundred strange peaks of Baleful Qi, manifesting and rushing toward the sky.

‘Incessant Calamity!’

The brightly shining celestial gate landed on the strange, dark peaks. The two corners of the gate sank into the baleful mist, dispersing the black qi in clouds of smoke and flame. It barely managed to hold its ground.

If Li Ximing's Audience with the Celestial Gate hadn't reached the perfection stage, the gate would have been forced upward. As he formed a hand seal, a realization struck him.

‘His Divine Ability is powerful and versatile, but Bright Yang carries the intent to break calamities and dispel evil. I have a slight advantage in suppressing it. His Daoist cultivation is simply higher than mine!’

But how could Helian Wujiang let him seize the initiative? His free hand had been gathering power on the longsword at his waist for some time. His eyes flashed. He reverse-gripped the sword and drew it in an instant. Rolling black Baleful Qi rose with the blade.

‘Empty Calamity Grasping Light Baleful Art!’

He struck, and as expected, he used the method of the sword technique. He inverted the blade's edge, using the Dharma swords to channel the Baleful Qi of heaven and earth. In that moment, the 'Incessant Calamity' shifted from static to dynamic, its peaks transforming into a sea. The worldly Baleful Qi howled, surging toward Audience with the Celestial Gate along with the sword's light.

This wave of baleful light surged to the heavens. It not only extinguished all the flames burning on Caishan but even dimmed Daoist Master Luo's azure sea below, allowing a Merciful One to escape. The situation had changed.

‘He's getting serious!’

Li Ximing felt a sudden dread. His Audience with the Celestial Gate was bound by the Baleful Qi, and it was too late to dissolve it like water. With a shake of his sleeve, the brilliant Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass appeared, already prepared!

Yet he didn't activate the compass immediately. Instead, his figure flickered like light, descending from atop his Divine Ability trailing sparks. He thrust out his palm, still pressing the attack directly on Helian Wujiang.

His family had been known as a clan of sword cultivators in his early years. His elder clan brother, Li Xizhi, was an expert of profound cultivation who understood the method of the sword technique. No matter how powerful, a sword technique was still a Dharma Art, not a detached sword qi. It required hand seals and incantations to cast!

Helian Wujiang's eyes calmly watched the approaching palm, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face.

The armor on his chest parted, revealing a blood-red chest cavity. Black blood roiled within. His vibrant, endlessly beating heart suddenly flipped over, revealing a stark black-and-white eye on its reverse side.

His cultivation art was orthodox; only at this moment did he reveal the slightest trace of a demon cultivator. This eye in his heart was icy cold, brimming with a chilling might. It shimmered with intermittent golden light.

"Freeze!"

Li Ximing merely glanced at it and felt as if he'd been struck by lightning. A chill ran through his body. Layers of golden light fell upon his Dharma Body, binding him with their glow. He was completely immobilized.

‘It was a trap!’

The look on Helian Wujiang's face turned frigid. He instantly released the longsword that was surging skyward, letting the measureless Baleful Qi disperse. His 'Incessant Calamity' Divine Ability stopped its assault. He was now focused entirely on Li Ximing, his eyes locked onto him.

In that instant, a smile actually spread across the man's handsome face. His lips split open, tearing all the way to his earlobes. He transformed, revealing a shockingly vast, bloody maw. Even the connecting flesh stretched into a thin membrane. With the speed of a thunderclap, he lunged forward, casting a deep shadow.

He intended to swallow Li Ximing whole!

‘He showed weakness every step of the way, all to lure me in close!’

The moment the eye fixed on him, Li Ximing's mind cleared, and he broke free from the mental shock. But the golden light binding his body was not so easily dispelled! He could only desperately channel his Divine Abilities with all his might!

Fortunately, he had recovered quickly. The golden light had only held him for a split second. A bright light shone in his eyes, and he managed to move.

Tread on Flames.

"Boom!"

A chain of Li Fire explosions erupted all over his body. All his Bright Yang Heavenly Light converged, transforming into gusts of vermilion Li Fire that scattered like smoke.

This Li Fire movement technique was not weak. Facing such a crisis, Li Ximing squeezed out every last drop of potential from his body. In an instant, he transformed his body into Li Fire. But his opponent was simply too close… He saw the bloody maw retract, and a burst of Heavenly Light exploded!

The Li Fire scattered and reconverged, revealing Li Ximing's figure. He was still moving forward!

The entire upper half of the Daoist Master's face was gone. A line of fine, dense teeth marks ran across the bridge of his nose, as if he had been bitten by some Demon beast.

Both of his ears were also half-gone, streaming golden blood. The wound was angled, higher at the front and lower at the back. If one looked down from above, they could even see his constantly working throat.

But he was *still* moving forward.

The only part of his head that remained intact was his mouth and teeth, which were still chanting an incantation. A round treasure fell from his hand—a compass, inscribed with runes of the eight directions, pulsing like a breath, dazzling and golden.

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!

The intricate runes on the compass swirled, layer upon layer, turning pure white. A speck of golden light flew out, locking onto the longsword in Helian Wujiang's hand. Immediately, the world dimmed, as if the radiant Heavenly Light itself was being channeled, casting down a sheet of golden-white brilliance.

The killing light of Bright Yang!

Li Ximing was face-to-face with Helian Wujiang. But Helian Wujiang was also completely exposed before the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, far closer than Chiluo had ever been!

Above, the Audience with the Celestial Gate, now out of his control, was sinking into the heavy black qi, suppressing the 'Incessant Calamity'. The Radiant Celestial Wave Art rose from both sides, entangling Helian Wujiang's Dharma Body.

Even more fatally, a bright light flickered inside Helian Wujiang's abdomen. A cluster of Bright Yang radiance was pulsing, resonating with the attack from outside. He had no time to suppress it. The killing light of Bright Yang was already descending.

"Vmm…"

A blast of light erupted in the sky. Baleful Qi rained down. Daoist Master Luo, shining with golden light, was struggling to hold off three Merciful Ones by himself. He looked harried, but he couldn't help but look up, his heart trembling with a mix of shock and envy.

‘It really is the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass... What a treasure…’

‘Stalling for this long should be enough. But even with the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, Li Ximing can, at best, heavily injure Helian Wujiang. The Helian family has an orthodox demon cultivator Daoist tradition. How could he be easy to deal with?’

Daoist Master Luo himself practiced demonic techniques. Although he was called a demon cultivator in Jiangnan, he was, frankly, still following the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. He was both terrified and greedy of Helian Wujiang's Daoist tradition, and he understood its power all too well.

‘He has his compass to get away. I'm all on my own. I'd better make plans to bolt!’

His expression changed, and his attacks became even more sinister, as if he were about to risk his life. This made the three Merciful Ones wary. Just then, he saw the Bright Yang light in the sky dissipate, and Baleful Qi once again filled the heavens. The northern cultivator had finally regained his footing.

Helian Wujiang had long arms and a narrow waist, with an exceptionally handsome face. His entire body was wreathed in black qi that coiled around his armor. A horizontal slit, over an inch long, had opened on his chest, revealing the cold pupil within. The rest of the Baleful Qi billowed around him as he moved.

‘A Body Divine Ability!’

The surging, baleful Divine Ability merged with Multicolored light, flickering across his body. However, a fist-sized hole was visible in his abdomen, glowing with a brilliant white light from within. The surrounding flesh, mixed with Baleful Qi, was writhing and slowly closing the wound.

Helian Wujiang's face had returned to normal, back to its original handsome appearance. He looked slightly astonished, even stunned for a moment.

‘What terrifying willpower. He truly is an Imperial Scion... a man who broke through to this realm in just over a decade!’

His Divine Ability was a deadly one. Once an enemy was swallowed, his 'Incessant Calamity' outside could immediately sink into his stomach, allowing him to use all sorts of methods to deal with the foe. Still, he wasn't discouraged.

‘There are still ways to fight... Good, he's an Imperial Scion. I won't lose face for the Helian family. But if I can't take his life, it will be hard to answer to the State Perceptor…’

Not far away, the man in the white-gold Daoist robe stood in the air. The flesh on his face was also regenerating. His lips, wreathed in flame, opened and closed slightly, giving him the solemn, statuesque appearance of an idol.

His heart was calm and cold, completely free of panic. The wound looked terrifying, but he had merely lost a part of his body. To a Purple Mansion Realm expert, whose body had no fatal weaknesses, it was a trivial injury!

‘This is the true power of a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator going all out. Not like Yehui, who dragged his feet and refused to truly fight!’

His lips breathed fire as he held the golden compass in a reverse grip. It released a profound halo. Four bright stars flickered around him, and Heavenly Light poured down, confronting the Baleful Qi on the other side.

Helian Wujiang, his Dharma Body merged as one with the Baleful Qi, had Bright Yang light continuously jetting from the hole in his stomach. He held his sword in one hand and his whip in the other. His eyes burned with fighting spirit as he laughed, "Again!"

It was unknown what demonic art he cultivated, but his Body Divine Ability was bizarre. It roiled like a cloud, constantly interacting with the Baleful Qi. The so-called wound was also being suppressed with extreme speed. The Baleful Qi rising from him merged with his 'Incessant Calamity', gradually obscuring the entire sky, leaving only his pale red pupils visible.

"My Helian family established our nation many years ago, yet we can only call ourselves a royal family. Today, I have come on orders. I apologize for the offense, but I wish to witness the might of an Imperial Scion!"

His voice rolled through the air, but there was no reply. All that remained was the bright celestial gate standing tall within the Baleful Qi, its intricate patterns shining, casting its light down like the only beacon in a sea of baleful energy.

***

… Xiaoshi Mountain.

A grey wind howled, and the rain fell in torrents.

Xiaoshi Mountain was separated from the Buddhist cultivators' position by a single path. It was the closest point, the one they defended most strongly, and the first place where fighting had broken out. The area was now a complete wreck.

A purple haze drifted over the mountain. A profound pavilion, a Spiritual Treasure of the Purple Qi Dao, hovered in the air, pulsing with a brilliance that was especially stark in the rain. Layers of light screens shone down from it, dancing like sheer veils.

"Tinglan!"

The woman standing on the pavilion was, of course, Daoist Master Tinglan. She was currently focused on channeling her Divine Ability. The voice from the sky was like a clap of thunder. Treasure Light flared, not to be outdone, forming a five-pointed formation in the sky that trapped the purple light within.

But this formation didn't just bind her; it was more complex. The five of them were drawing upon the radiance of the Buddhist Land together. The power of their buff had reached its peak, and they were even faintly resonating with each other, elevating their combined power to a new level.

The one leading this formation was a large, fat monk with a kasaya draped over his shoulder and a smile on his face. It was none other than the Way of Emptiness's most rapidly promoted Merciful One in recent years—Xuwang.

If one said the Way of Emptiness had profited immensely from the last conflict between north and south, then aside from a few Mahas, Xuwang was arguably the biggest beneficiary. He had led the charge that wiped out all of Mount Bianyan and achieved the status of Merciful One on the spot. Maha Taixi had lost Li Xuanfeng's destiny, and his actual gains were less than Xuwang's.

As a result, his status in the Buddhist Land had skyrocketed. Though he was a newly ascended Merciful One, he now wielded a Treasured Artifact. He laughed heartily, "Day after day, you used that Immeasurable Water and Fire to harm our brothers. I suppose it's not so convenient for you now!"

As his voice fell, five beams of light flared as one, converging on a Merciful One to the side who was riding a crimson tiger. This one remained silent, merely raising a treasured pagoda. It gathered the strength of all five and smashed down abruptly.

"Rumble!"

A cloud of golden Treasure Light erupted, pouring down relentlessly onto the purple pavilion, pulsing with blinding light. The Merciful Ones of the Way of Emptiness clearly despised her. After all, they had fought for so many years and in so many battles. If they couldn't win, they could always retreat to the Buddhist Land. They had never encountered anything as hateful as the Immeasurable Water and Fire and the Supreme Minister's Gourd!

Tinglan, however, remained calm. The Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion was a Spiritual Treasure passed down from the Purple Smoke blessed land, renowned for its defensive capabilities. It was anchored by five different types of Purple Qi, all at the Purple Mansion Realm level, locked within it. Back then, when she and Ning Wan—one defending, one attacking—had worked together, not even Maha Zhelu could break through. Although these five had a formation, they couldn't outlast her in a battle of attrition.

Just as the group was coordinating their formation, clouds suddenly roiled in the northern sky. A pinkish light surged to the heavens, Treasure Light soared, and lapis lazuli-like light rained down.

‘A Merciful One has fallen!’

She looked in that direction. It was where Kui Qi and the others were. Right now, dark clouds were roiling, and the rain was torrential. Tinglan's face seemed to relax, but her heart did not. She immediately raised her head to look.

Xuwang, however, showed little surprise. He just watched her coldly.

To fight his way up from the ranks of Master Monks and become a Merciful One on the spot, Xuwang had never been a simple character. Merciful Ones of his type held a very special status in the Buddhist Land.

The positions in the Buddhist Land had always been limited. The temples had no shortage of monks or Master Monks. Forget monks; there were plenty of Master Monks who believed in the next life. Droves of them would obediently grow old, die, and nourish the Buddhist Land without the slightest chance of promotion.

When a new Maha finally appeared in the Buddhist Land, a few Merciful One positions would be allocated. But the new Maha would bring their own entourage, spend ten or twenty years shuffling people around, and award the positions to them. How could there be any spots left for others?

But people like him, who had gained great fortune in the north-south conflict and expanded the Buddhist Land, naturally obtained a position. His background and his methods were different. From the very beginning, he had been one of Maha Zhelu's most trusted confidants. That was why he had been stationed here.

The moment he saw Tinglan, he knew that for her to be here, fighting against many to stall for time, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition must be advancing north.

Xuwang had just heard word from the Buddhist Land. This matter was no longer just the concern of the Way of Emptiness, nor was it just the concern of the Buddhist cultivators. The figurehead Emperor of Zhao State had personally emerged from his deep palace to summon the State Perceptor and discuss the affairs of Jiangbei.

The Zhao Emperor was nothing but a puppet. Ever since the matter of handing over the Metallic Essence, he had been completely worthless. His only remaining value was his title as the co-ruler of the northern Zhao State. He was like a seal. If the Seven Ministers wanted to do something together, they would take him out, stamp him on it, and make a gesture.

If the Seven Ministers couldn't reach a consensus, who could possibly get him to appear at court? The entire Zhao State court was in an uproar. The State Perceptor of Zhao State had already achieved the rank of Great Daoist Master. It was unknown if he would personally come south!

‘Kui Qi is indeed bold... but so what…’

Xuwang had to admit he admired Kui Qi. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had many hidden cards, and the north was a mess without a leader. Kui Qi had been decisive enough. At least, as of now, there was still no word of reinforcements at Xiaoshi Mountain, the point furthest from the north.

It was hard to say what the final outcome would be, but Xuwang's heart was already burning with ambition.

‘One north-south conflict paved my way to becoming a Merciful One. If I can achieve another great merit of expanding the Buddhist Land... then Maha will be within my grasp!’




# Chapter 904: Wei Xuanyin

Luoxia Plain.

The sky was grim and overcast. Sword light ebbed and flowed. A man in black robes stood quietly in the gloomy wind, a bronze sword in his hand.

Brilliant light still streamed from the bronze sword, as if it had just sundered the Dharma Body of some Merciful One. Its radiance was blinding. Swirling dust and pulverized light drifted before him, and the sound of cracking earth and stone rose from all directions.

He held his ground, dark winds swirling around him. Not far away, Daoist Master Zhusheng stood with his sword held horizontally, suppressing a whistling, unceasing crimson-purple light.

Kui Qi's expression was calm, his gaze frigid. On the other side, Ning Wan was even more silent.

The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had already wagered all its forces in this great battle.

Besides herself, Ning Wan, there was Tinglan of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land; Kui Qi and Houfu of Xiukui; Yushui of the Chen Clan; Zhaojing of the Li Clan; Zhusheng of Shahuan; Daoist Master Luo of the Southern Borderlands; Che Hong of the Chunyi Dao Gate; Hengxing's friend, Kuang Yu; and even Lingmei of the Sword Gate!

Even Zhu Gong, who had traveled far overseas, had rushed back and was waiting silently at Xiaoshi Mountain to assist Tinglan.

'If there's a next time, we'll never be able to gather a force greater than this!'

When everyone had first charged into this place, their momentum had been unstoppable, and they had heavily wounded Zhelu. But the Luoxia region was right under the nose of the Zhao State; it was naturally the first place to receive reinforcements. In a flash, the enemy had arrived.

They had expected enemies. Neither Kui Qi nor Ning Wan had ever thought they could just take advantage of the north and leave. But the sheer number of foes arriving one after another was far beyond their expectations...

The most conspicuous was the enormous Golden Dharma Body before them, towering into the clouds, its radiance blinding. It had taken four Purple Mansion cultivators working together just to suppress it, causing the entire plain to flash with divine abilities, bathing the land in brilliance and churning dust.

Cultivators of the Way of Compassion usually manifested with large bellies, but this Golden Dharma Body was different. It was hunched over, stooping low. Despite its infinite magnificence, it looked like a crooked old man, bent at the waist. Attached to its arms was a vast, towering golden mountain. This mountain was covered in lotus blossoms and gold, filled with high monks chanting sutras and disciples seeking knowledge. They sat cross-legged or hovered in the air. The mountain itself was massive, and the people on it were as small as ants, numbering in the untold millions. It was as if the body carried an entire Buddhist Kingdom on its back—a truly magnificent sight.

This Buddhist Kingdom connected heaven and earth, linking directly to the infinite Buddhist Land. Tens of thousands of streams of light descended from the sky, empowering the monks on the mountain. This power then transferred to the Maha's Dharma Body that carried it, seeming to condense into solid reality.

The Seventh-Generation Maha of the Way of Compassion—Beigu.

His waist was bent extremely low. The face looking down at the earth was filled with guilt and unease. But the Golden Dharma Body had another face on the back of its head, growing from the *fengfu* acupoint and nearly reaching its neck. This face wore an expression of compassion and pity, gazing quietly and with a slight smile at the golden mountain on its own back.

With Murong Xia having achieved the ninth reincarnation, linked with the Dharma Master, and no longer leaving the Buddhist Land, this man, Beigu, was now the most revered Maha of the Way of Compassion. He was also the fastest-cultivating Maha in history. Even the renowned Maha Jinlian, famous for his innate talent, was far inferior to him in terms of promotion speed.

His path was even stranger. He seemed to be nurturing a Buddhist Land of his own, one that was tightly bound to the Way of Compassion. The radiance of this Buddhist Land was incredibly strong, impossible to sever, and possessed immense power.

He alone held off the combined assault. Even after reinforcements arrived to break the siege, four cultivators—Ning Wan, Che Hong, Houfu, and Yushui—had to remain just to keep him contained. His Dharma Body wavered and he spat golden blood, yet the two faces on his head, bowed so low it nearly touched the ground, remained unchanged: one compassionate and pitying, the other guilty and uneasy. He was not moved in the slightest.

"What a formidable Buddhist Kingdom."

Houfu watched the Maha, his expression grim. A wondrous object in his hand flew up, connecting to a brown spirit-pouch in the air. A thick ray of Supreme Yang light streamed down, pouring onto the enemy's protective Treasure Light.

In his hand was Xiukui's Spiritual Treasure, the Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch. As both a Spiritual Treasure and an artifact of the Supreme Yang Dao, it excelled at exorcising evil and vanquishing demons. Even Buddhist cultivators who were struck by its light would feel as if burning coals had been dropped on them, making it impossible to resist.

But as Maha Beigu bathed in this Supreme Yang light, he only seemed slightly restrained. His dharma power did not recede, nor did his divine abilities dissolve as they usually would... It showed no sign of exorcising evil at all.

This was an extremely awkward situation. Even Che Hong, standing to the side, frowned secretly.

On another side, Buddhist chanting echoed in the air. Daoist Master Lingmei of the Sword Gate, holding the Great Snow's Severing Edge, wore a glacial expression. Facing him were three Mahas: the sixth-generation Zhelu, the third-generation Taixi, and the first-generation Nuzi.

The sixth-generation Maha Zhelu, his body covered in eyes, was undoubtedly the most miserable of the northern faction. He was riddled with holes, and more than seventy percent of his eyes had been stabbed to pieces. If he hadn't joined forces with Taixi and Nuzi, with Merciful Ones supporting them in formation, he likely would have already fallen to Lingmei's assault.

Leaving aside that battlefield of whistling sword-qi, Daoist Master Kui Qi, grasping one of his Dharma swords, was also under immense pressure. The man facing him was cloaked in a Profound Yellow Qi, his expression fierce. It was the Touba Clan's Daoist Master, Touba Ci. He wore a tall cap, a wide sash, and shimmering feathered robes. His cultivation was also at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, and the Spiritual Artifact in his hands was a great halberd, which he wielded with exquisite and imposing skill.

The Touba Clan had fared the best among all the imperial lineages, even managing to preserve their Grotto-heaven. As descendants of a Golden Core ancestor, their Daoist tradition was naturally not much weaker than Xiukui's. With two Merciful Ones supporting him from the side, Touba Ci even held a slight advantage.

Meanwhile, Daoist Master Zhusheng wielded his Jade True sword. Beside him stood a pale-faced female cultivator in light blue robes—Hengxing's friend, Daoist Master Kuang Yu. The two of them were jointly battling a demonic cultivator wreathed in roiling white qi, whose Daoist tradition was impossible to identify...

Ning Wan swept her gaze across the battlefield, taking it all in.

'The Helian Clan's cultivators aren't here... The enemy clearly has a comfortable grasp on the situation. We still don't know where Helian Wumeng is. It's even possible Helian Wujiang has come as well...'

Caishan's forces shouldn't have been able to stop Li Ximing, but there was still no word. Someone must have intervened to reinforce them. The fact that no new enemies had arrived from the east was already a testament to Li Ximing's best efforts.

Ning Wan wasn't completely ignorant about the situation in the north, but she couldn't compare to Kui Qi in terms of detailed intelligence. Ever since Kui Qi had specifically sent Tinglan to give Li Ximing a Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, and then redeployed Daoist Master Luo, who was supposed to be at Xiaoshi Mountain, Ning Wan had a premonition. The pressure on Li Ximing's side would be immense. She just hadn't dared to say it... At this point, who *wasn't* under pressure?

Things had come to this, and she still didn't know what Kui Qi was thinking. She didn't know what other cards the north had to play, nor how such precise intelligence had been personally delivered from the north into Kui Qi's hands. Which northerner had secretly leaked the information? Regardless, there was no longer any path of retreat.

'Waiting in the formation is just sitting here to die. These Purple Mansion cultivators won't stay on guard with us forever. The only way is to fight with all our strength!'

But that was far easier said than done.

The golden body, prostrated on the ground and carrying its golden mountain, remained motionless, enduring the siege of four cultivators. The mouth on its downturned face opened and closed, releasing a calm, majestic, thunder-like voice:

"Benefactors! You have achieved great divine abilities but lack the root of wisdom, making it difficult for you to enter the Buddhist Land. My Dao does not wish to create needless killing karma. I hope you will retreat quickly, surrender the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, and return what belongs to our Buddhist Land!"

The voice spread, carrying a pure and peaceful light that dispersed the divine abilities converging on it. Daoist Master Che Hong of the Chunyi Dao Gate had an ugly expression. The Supreme Yin radiance in his hand dimmed as his face filled with hatred.

The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain was, of course, Tangdao Mountain. To lose it was to lose Jiangbei. These terms were utterly unacceptable. Beside them, Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin, didn't even bother to reply; he simply struck the golden body with his sword.

*BOOM!*

The clash of dharma power in the air sounded like rolling thunder, one crash drowning out the last. Kui Qi's expression was grave. A Spiritual Artifact at his waist flew up to defend against the opponent's attack. Finally, a white light flashed in the sky, blanketing the area in endless white fog, and a crimson rain began to fall.

*Splash, splash, splash!*

The crimson rain fell like a waterfall, quickly overwhelming the natural rain clouds. It pelted the earth, and the agitated raindrops transformed into silky threads that leaped up, clinging to the robes of every Daoist Master.

Kui Qi started, then his face lit up with joy. The expression of the Touba Clan Daoist Master, however, instantly turned foul.

'The Spiritual Treasure Heavenly Balance Mystic-Governing Cloud...'

Sure enough, just as the thought crossed his mind, the crimson rain had already coated the sleeves of every allied Daoist Master with a protective radiance. Two figures, a man and a woman, descended from the clouds. The woman held a parasol, an expression of resignation on her face. The man trod on fire, his eyes wide with rage.

'The Hengzhu Dao is here!'

It was Hengxing and Hengli!

The Hengzhu Dao had claimed they would not interfere, but in the end, they couldn't bear to stay away. Hengxing had a sharp tongue, but a soft heart. Faced with such a crisis, she had first asked her friend Kuang Yu to come. Still uneasy, she and Hengli had been waiting in the Great Void all along.

The range of the Heavenly Balance Mystic-Governing Cloud was vast. As a Spiritual Treasure of the Hengzhu Dao, its invocation arts empowered them, and the morale of the southern cultivators surged.

How could Hengli possibly restrain himself now? He was a man with thick brows and large eyes, dressed in a narrow-sleeved robe with a wide lapel, its hem embroidered with 'Li-light' runes. He flicked his sleeves, and dense swarms of crimson talismans erupted. Stretching out his hands, he seized two long sabers from the Great Void. His eyes immediately locked onto Zhelu's group of three as he laughed.

"You three bastards, your grandpa is here to beat you to death!"

The trio's faces changed instantly. Zhelu was already injured, and it was taking all three of them just to hold off Lingmei. The longer they fought, the more sword wounds they accumulated, and their situation grew more precarious. Hengli was famously belligerent; how could they possibly withstand him?

Normally, given their personalities, they would have turned to flee the moment the Hengzhu Dao appeared. But they couldn't just escape. They could only exchange a silent glance, resolutely gather the light in their hands, and brace themselves to defend their ground, waiting for death. Their misery was palpable.

On the other side, Hengxing simply raised an eyebrow, saying nothing. The spirit parasol in her hand danced, bringing a swath of red light down in front of Kui Qi, neutralizing the Profound Yellow Qi. With a gentle twirl, the parasol's surface instead released a multicolored radiance.

The black-robed man beside her awkwardly tried to thank her, but Hengxing turned her head away, ignoring him and showing him only her profile. Her attacks never paused as she said coldly:

"The Touba Clan has stayed in the Yan State so long, they've started acting as lapdogs for the Murong."

But Touba Ci, the richly-dressed cultivator cloaked in the Profound Yellow Qi, just smiled and shook his head. Even though the two Merciful Ones beside him had paled at Hengli's arrival and abandoned him to provide reinforcements elsewhere, he remained perfectly composed. He swung his great halberd, shattering the incoming 'Li-light', and fought on for several exchanges, a cold sneer on his face.

"Ah, the Hengzhu Dao. I thought after all these years, you'd at least be second only to Mount Changhuai. I never expected you'd still be holed up in your little corner... No wonder you decline day by day!"

Hengxing, however, was in no mood to indulge him. The Hengzhu Dao was currently the most well-preserved faction within the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. She gave her sleeve a gentle shake, and a gleaming, red-glazed, cloud-patterned treasure box flew out. Its lid shifted, leaking a two-toned light of gold and red.

This light blocked the Profound Yellow Qicolor and swept away the dust storm from the halberd. The box's surface was painted with a red-patterned sword on a black background, which seemed ready to leap forth. Tens of thousands of sword-lights erupted, forcing the Touba Clan man to hastily bring his halberd back to block. For a moment, the Profound Yellow Qi scattered, overwhelmed by the brilliant invocation art.

The northern side was already at a disadvantage. With the Hengzhu Dao joining the fray, the scales of battle tipped completely. The field fell into chaos. Kui Qi, finally breaking free, had just let out a breath of relief. He was about to draw his sword and turn, when a sudden chill washed over him.

The crimson clouds of the Heavenly Balance Mystic-Governing Cloud were slowly dimming. A faint, pale light emerged from the Great Void, descended rapidly, and came to a rest quietly before him.

It was a man.

He wore white robes under a silver cloak made of distinct, bird-like feathers. His hair was jet-black, his willow-leaf brows were long and thin, and his phoenix-eyes were captivating. His features were delicate, almost feminine, and his hair was bound with a simple wooden hairpin.

He held a silver-white incense burner in his left hand, his right hand clasped behind his back. A white jade pearl hung from his waist. He stood upon a dark, white mist that roiled like a beast. Despite his soft appearance, he had a transcendent, immortal bearing that inspired reverence.

But his aura soared to the heavens, causing dark clouds to roil and suppressing the Heavenly Balance Mystic-Governing Cloud. The boundless pressure bore down, and Kui Qi's expression turned even colder.

'A Great Daoist Master... A Great Daoist Master of the Veiled Yin!'

This figure's appearance silenced the entire plain. The various Mahas and Merciful Ones secretly breathed sighs of relief. Even Touba Ci found a moment to raise an eyebrow and bow his head slightly to the Great Daoist Master in a show of respect.

'The State Preceptor of Great Zhao, Wei Xuanyin!'

This was Wei Xuanyin, a Great Daoist Master who had mastered four divine abilities and hailed from the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao. As the State Preceptor of Great Zhao, he was the nation's number one immortal cultivator, supported by the entire state. His Daoist tradition was profound, his abilities exquisite, and his Spiritual Artifacts numerous. He was no ordinary expert!

The moment Wei Xuanyin appeared, the cultivators who had been invigorated by the Hengzhu Dao's arrival felt a surge of anxiety. The only exception was Hengli. Wreathed in flames and wielding his Spiritual Artifact, he paid the newcomer no mind, simply continuing his charge to hack at the miserable Zhelu. This was clearly wonderful news for the northern side, but the Maha didn't even have time to laugh or sneer; he just fled as if he'd seen a ghost.

Kui Qi stared coldly at the Great Daoist Master, only to see the delicate-featured man smile pleasantly and say:

"You saw wrong! That wasn't me above the temple. I asked the White Victory Dao early on, and we just pinched out a clone together."

His tone was friendly, as if discussing some Daoist principle, but only he and Kui Qi understood the true meaning of his words. The Great Daoist Master looked down at him for an instant, and the radiance of the Veiled Yin flared from the mouth of the censer in his hand.

*Vmmm...*

Kui Qi merely raised his bronze sword. His other hand produced five black talismans, which he tapped against five acupoints on his body. He pursed his lips and spat out a cloud of black qi.

The black qi swirled and took shape in the air, transforming into a massive, one-legged ghoul. It had a ferocious face, was draped in white bones, and its eyes glowed with a spectral light. Kui Qi did not call to Hengli or the others for help. Instead, he raised his sword and moved, his gaze sharp as a blade!

He, Kui Qi, had never come here to occupy Luoxia. He had only seized this fleeting opportunity to muster his strength and inflict a heavy blow on the Buddhist cultivators. Now, a full fourteen Purple Mansion cultivators had come from Jiangnan. To put it bluntly, not even Wrath or Jingzhan had ever received such treatment back in the day! Even if it cost him his life, as long as he could tie down Wei Xuanyin, Hengli, Lingmei, and the others could definitely shatter the northern cultivators and Buddhists!

As the current leader of the Great Xiukui Monastery and a three-ability cultivator of the Merging Owl, he knew his strengths. When it came to pure destructive power and extinguishing True Spirits, he was far inferior to Lingmei. For artifact refinement, invocation arts, and smiting evil, he was no match for Hengli. Even in defending a region and seeking the Dao, Tinglan had her own unique profundities that surpassed his...

But when it came to versatile incantations, entanglement, and delay tactics, only he, Kui Qi, dared to stand before the State Preceptor of Great Zhao, Wei Xuanyin!

*BOOM!*

A muffled thunderclap echoed from the clouds. The black-robed man's robes billowed as the bronze sword in his hand flashed with an incomparably dazzling light. The one-legged, one-eyed ghoul dissolved into overlapping layers of black qi, coiling around his body.

Wei Xuanyin watched him with a gentle expression, his pupils devoid of any particular emotion. He merely nodded. The silver-white censer in his hand shifted, tilting toward the northeast. Instantly, countless dark-white waterfalls descended, kicking up a terrifying storm that pressed down on Kui Qi.

The man's feathered silver cloak fluttered in the storm, and the white jade pearl at his waist began to sway. He looked down from on high and said quietly:

"Fellow Daoist, you underestimate my Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao."




# Chapter 905: One's Act Ends, Another's Begins

The dark clouds roiled. The battle had raged for a long time, and the clash of Divine Abilities battered the world, leaving the sky a mottled mess.

The Heavenly Balance Mystic-Governing Cloud was, by nature, a Spiritual Treasure capable of blanketing a region and staining the world crimson. But it was thwarted by the Great Daoist Master's Divine Ability, unable to cover the entire battlefield. Instead, the power of Veiled Yin surged upward, a rolling torrent of dim white vapor that broke through the crimson expanse in several places. This, combined with the golden radiance of the Buddhist Land, painted the heavens in a chaotic tapestry—a patch of gold in the east, a swathe of red in the west, all mixed with dark clouds and white mist.

The appearance of Veiled Yin's energy summoned furious gales and wrathful clouds that agitated the world. Its color was a dim, shadowy white, and from its darkest depths, streams of azure qi emerged. This qi transformed into layer upon layer of clouds, gathering beneath the Great Daoist Master's feet and echoing the censer in his hand, pouring forth like a relentless deluge.

Meanwhile, a white pearl hung suspended in the air, floating before Wei Xuanyin's brow. Faint cracks seemed to cover its surface, erupting with a blinding white light that seized the senses. This light formed blades and swords, stabbing down toward the Daoist Master below, who was wreathed in roiling black qi.

Kui Qi stood amidst the clouds, his hands forming spell arts. His black hair whipped wildly in the gale. Dark, blackish-red blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, rolling down onto his robes. As the drops hit the fabric, they transformed into a few ethereal feathers, only to be instantly torn to shreds by the wind.

He had already been fighting this opponent for some time. Their Divine Abilities had clashed, shifting and transforming dozens of times. He had brushed against death on several occasions, but had finally traded injury for an opportunity, securing a brief moment of stalemate.

One after another, pitch-black doppelgangers emerged from his body, taking up positions in every direction. Some held copper swords, others black chains. They were blasted into clouds of black qi by the unending barrage of white light, yet more and more dark figures continued to appear.

Kui Qi's lips were pale. His true form flickered constantly between the various doppelgangers, but he felt not an ounce of relief. His entire focus was fixed on his opponent's sleeve.

The Great Daoist Master operated his Divine Ability with an air of casual indifference, but a dangerous aura, like that of a venomous snake, emanated from that sleeve. It would periodically lock onto his real body from among the clones. If not for the profundity of his Daoist arts, which allowed him to resonate with his Divine Ability and weave between the doppelgangers, causing the lock to fail, that hidden *thing* would have struck long ago, like a viper lunging from its den.

The situation was far from optimistic. The white pearl hanging in the air was unleashing an ever-increasing torrent of white light, and the incantation seals his opponent was forming were nearing completion...

'I'm gathering the Nether-Merging Veiled Light in my own hands... but the technique he's preparing is likely even more powerful!'

Wei Xuanyin slowly lowered the two fingers he held before his lips. His strangely delicate eyes stared fixedly forward. He finally reined in his Divine Ability, and with a pinch of his fingers, drew forth a single point of light.

*Dong...*

Simultaneously, the bright white pearl in the sky began to spin, releasing an intensely blinding radiance. From it, thousands of snow-white beams erupted, descending like a dense downpour, instantly sweeping all of Kui Qi's dark doppelgangers from the sky.

Kui Qi's true form was forced into the open, flickering precariously within the rain of light.

His real body was clearly in a terrible state. His black hair was splayed like fine, distinct feathers. The black clouds coiling around him resembled a flock of owls in flight. From within his two sleeves, great ravens cried out, a sound like weeping and wailing, as they scrambled to pour forth. These creatures, with their large beaks and dark plumage, bristled with a ghostly, yin-heavy aura. They seemed to have long treated his robes as their roost, and their bloodcurdling cries were nothing short of demonic.

And that single point of light... It drifted gently amidst the snow-white storm. Its light was dim, cloaked in azure and silver, and as light as a goose feather. Yet, it closed the distance in an instant, arriving right before him.

There was no escape!

Kui Qi finally stopped his spell arts. He drew his copper sword with one hand, pressing two fingers of the other flat against the blade. His pupils dilated as he grit his teeth.

'Nether-Merging Veiled Light!'

Within the dense white light, a single point of absolute blackness appeared, like a duckweed floating in a storm—bobbing, swaying, and unstable. But his opponent's cultivation depth was too high, his casting speed far superior. How could such a hastily prepared counter hope to succeed?

*Clang!*

In the glare of the white light, the copper sword's own radiance rapidly faded, revealing its base metal. The next instant, that point of light pressed down on the blade. The force sent Kui Qi and his sword sinking. The Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword bent visibly, and the two fingers pressed against it dissolved rapidly, dissipating into trails of black qi.

Kui Qi's expression remained unchanged. He activated his Body Divine Ability as five talismans plastered to his body exploded simultaneously, erupting in black smoke. He took one step back, his form dissolving into black qi.

As he retreated, another 'Kui Qi' was left behind in his original position. It channeled all its dharma power to block the descending point of light.

*Boom!*

A dense column of black qi rocketed into the sky. The real Kui Qi, now reappeared, spat out a mouthful of blood. His Dharma Body was covered in fractures. He snapped his head around, only to see the pinkish light from the plains below almost flooding the heavens. Even Touba Ci was vomiting blood, his arm severed, his body surging with Profound Yellow Qi.

But he had only just escaped. Where was Wei Xuanyin's figure in the sky?

The man in white was long gone, leaving only that bright white orb to radiate sharp, white light from among the clouds. Wei Xuanyin was the Grand Preceptor of Zhao State, not just because of his four Veiled Yin Divine Abilities, but because he was a master of the art of calculation, allowing him to appear here so unexpectedly!

The moment Kui Qi shattered the five talismans to escape, the Life Divine Ability that had been locked onto him, 'Owl Chases the Leopard Cat', finally dissipated. The white-robed Great Daoist Master's Divine Ability flared, and he instantly appeared at Kui Qi's side, his sleeve wide open.

*Rumble!*

But it was the Great Void that rumbled first. Wei Xuanyin's sleeve trembled slightly, as if a long hook had snagged his wrist, yanking it upward. A flash of white light vanished, and the patch of sky his sleeve had been aimed at turned a vast, dim white, becoming an empty void of spiritual energy filled with the howling wind of annihilation.

Kui Qi had narrowly escaped catastrophe, but his arm had been grazed by the Light of Veiled Yin. The aftershock alone was enough to disintegrate his flesh, leaving only stark white bone. Countless finger-sized white jade shrews were crawling over the bone, gnawing at it frantically.

"Oh?"

Wei Xuanyin looked up, a hint of confusion on his face. Suddenly, two narrow mountain ranges pressed in on him from either side. The clouds dispersed, and a stream flowed beneath his feet, as if he were standing on a small boat. He was being drawn into a narrow pass where overlapping cliffs blocked out all light.

His fine eyebrows shot up in surprise.

"Holding the Ridge!"

Sure enough, an old man stood in the distant clouds, holding a white jade fishing rod. With a slight lift of the rod, he had locked onto Wei Xuanyin's sleeve from afar, snaring his Divine Art.

It was Xiao Chuting!

"So, you're interfering as well..."

Wei Xuanyin seemed to know him well. He even raised an eyebrow, a flicker of pleasure in his eyes. His Divine Ability carried his voice across the distance to Xiao Chuting's cloud.

"How interesting," he said.

"You've repaired the Pit Water... Fellow Daoist Xiao, you had best be sure which household's gate you're standing before!"

The old man in the sky gave a helpless little shake of his head, but Wei Xuanyin didn't believe the expression for a second. His eyes narrowed, studying Xiao Chuting, as if pondering something...

'They have sown discord for years. The Chunyi Dao Gate and Mount Jingyi share a blood feud; Xuanyi cannot come, nor would he dare... And with Crimson Reef Island making moves, the Chunyi Dao Gate is also immobilized...'

'I recall there are a few Purple Mansion Realm rogue cultivators in Jiangbei, but they wouldn't dare take a side in this. Yuandao has spent years distancing itself; it won't give the Peacocks leverage at a time like this...'

'And we still have *him*... All the pieces are on the board... Now, we just watch the situation unfold!'

Wei Xuanyin made no move. Their eyes met for only a second, but the long fishing line stretching through the Great Void snapped taut, humming as if on the verge of breaking. Xiao Chuting gazed at him calmly and replied via a divine message, his voice soft:

"The Xiao clan once received aid from the Xiukui. Though I was in seclusion in the Northern Sea, I had no choice but to emerge to repay this favor. Forgive my offense!"

*Whoosh!*

The drifting yin clouds instantly blotted out the surrounding sky. Kui Qi had already teleported away. Pitch-black Divine Ability and dharma power covered his body, suppressing the Veiled Yin wound on his forearm. He felt a wave of weakness and aching pain wash over him.

But just as he escaped, all traces of relief vanished. He came to an abrupt, stiff halt in mid-air.

Not far from him stood a Daoist clad in pale-yellow feathered robes, which were embroidered with circular patterns. A Dharma sword was strapped to his back, looking exceptionally bright against the gloomy sky.

He had willow-leaf eyes and a rather scholarly air. One hand was held out before him, holding a lantern with a twelve-sided glass body and a copper base, which cast a soft, pale-yellow light.

Black-red blood trickled from Kui Qi's mouth. The Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery's brief shock passed, leaving only ice in his eyes.

'Changxiao!'

This was the Great Daoist Master who had been missing for years—Changxiao, who had fought against the Hengzhu Daoist tradition for so long!

Wei Xuanyin and Xiao Chuting stared at each other through the clouds, not a shred of surprise in either of their eyes. Only the Luoxia Plain below fell utterly silent. Even the several Mahas were stunned.

"Daoist Master Changxiao?!"

The silence lasted but a moment before a soft, floating sound echoed from the Great Void.

*"Twang!"*

It was the sound of a string snapping—seemingly from the edge of the horizon, yet also right beside one's ear. The white jade fishing rod in Xiao Chuting's hand sprang up, releasing a faint white glow. Down below, the white-robed Great Daoist Master smiled brilliantly as his bulging, tightly bound sleeve finally burst open!

In that fleeting instant, all the Divine Abilities and dharma power on the battlefield erupted. An infinite, dim white light poured from Wei Xuanyin's sleeve, connecting heaven above and the mountains below. The perilous peaks that had locked onto the 'small boat' stopped contracting, forced to dissipate by the sky-rending white light.

"Changxiao!"

The most hateful and enraged person at this moment was undoubtedly Hengli. The Daoist Master's eyes swept up, his pupils reflecting the lantern-bearing figure in the sky. His first instinct was to abandon the golden-blooded Maha in his grasp and step into the Great Void to fight Changxiao!

But the Great Daoist Master in the pale-yellow robes remained expressionless. The lantern in his hand exploded with dazzling brilliance. Behind his head, a white, mirror-like jade disc, etched with osmanthus patterns, emerged from its hidden state, shimmering into glorious view.

He had hidden for so long. How could he possibly miss?

This attack was worlds apart from the one he had used when pursuing Li Ximing, testing the attitudes of Luoxia and the Dragon-kin. In an instant, the world lost its color and thunder cracked. The iridescent light from the twelve-sided glass lantern shone on Kui Qi's face, reflecting a glittering golden light in his dark pupils.

The Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword was raised again, straining to block the golden light. The sound of grinding metal filled the air as black qi scattered, dissolving into a sky-full of gray rain.

As thunder roared, Ning Wan's cold voice suddenly echoed through the sky,

"Yan Jianxiao! How dare you disregard the grace of the lands that nurtured your Dao!"

The voice reverberated. Daoist Master Changxiao finally turned his head, just slightly, as if his own birth name now sounded unfamiliar. A small smile touched his lips.

'Isn't this precisely to repay the Chi clan's favor?'

...

Xiaoshi Mountain.

Dust and smoke churned. The Purple Qi that had lingered for so long finally dispersed, revealing a landscape of ruins. A golden light streaked by. A massive golden body lay toppled on the ground, humming weakly as plumes of blue-green flames flickered across its surface, looking utterly spent.

Xuwang retracted the golden body, reverting to his form as a portly, large-eared monk. He rode a magical breeze down to the ground, where his fellow disciples were still shouting:

"Give us a hand! We don't have a Treasured Artifact protecting us like you do. This woman's fire is truly vicious!"

Xuwang casually tossed the wooden fish in his hand downward. It pulsed with white light, aiding his disciples in extinguishing the flames on their bodies. He then turned his head, smiling at the Daoist Master standing nearby.

"Fellow Daoist Helian! Many thanks for your assistance. If it weren't for you, there's no telling how long it would have taken to drive that woman away!"

The man before him held a long-handled *zhao* blade, a weapon that was neither spear nor halberd. His face was handsome, his feathered robes snow-white, and eighteen glass prayer beads hung at his waist. He cut a truly imposing figure—it was Helian Wumeng.

But the expression of this Helian clan Daoist Master, this great general of the Tiefu Kingdom, was flat, even tinged with disgust. His handsome eyes were cold as he said frostily,

"Don't try to cozy up to me. No matter what, Tinglan is from one of the Three Profound Daoist traditions, a true orthodox line. What do you all count as? If not for the Grand Preceptor's orders, I wouldn't care if every last one of you died!"

The Helian clan had once been on good terms with the Way of Emtiness, but they had fallen out long ago due to certain events. Their current relationship was far from good—in fact, until today, they had been enemies. Naturally, he had no pleasantries to offer. They were merely acting under the same orders.

As orthodox demonic cultivators of the Heavenly Embryo Dao, the Helian clan considered themselves superior. Their foundation in the Great Void was a Diverse Mansion, and they measured themselves against the likes of the Supreme Yang Dao of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao. They viewed the blood-drinking cultivators of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao as a laughable, divergent path. With such pride in their hearts, how could he possibly look upon this monk as an equal?

The monk wasn't angered by the rebuke. He just chuckled.

"Fellow Daoist Helian has quite the personality!"

Helian Wumeng was well-known in both the northern and southern deserts. As the *qilin* son of the Helian clan, he was held in high regard by Helian Wujiang. His cultivation and Divine Abilities were far stronger than the other Helian clan Purple Mansion Realm cultivator currently stationed in Hetao, and also higher than Xuwang's. The monk, of course, wouldn't dare take offense. He sidled closer and whispered,

"I wonder what orders the General received? Is it to attack the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain with us?"

Although the Tangdao Mountain Range had a grand array, a single, hastily constructed Purple Mansion Realm formation couldn't possibly cover the entire range. There were many smaller formations, making it a juicy prize. The five Merciful Ones needed someone to stand guard here. Xuwang had a stronger background, so he was naturally entitled to a piece of the pie, but he was cautious by nature and hoped to rope in a reliable fighter like Helian Wumeng.

Helian Wumeng gave him a cold, sarcastic smile.

"Stupid monk. The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain will be in our grasp sooner or later. It's just a temporary stronghold, what good could be in there? A formation core, at best? Do you think that would ever fall into our hands? My lord has already set out from Caishan. One from the west, one from the east, we will advance south together, bypass the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, and converge at the Three Rivers region! The *real* prizes are the undefended Purple Mansion Realm factions along the river!"

Xuwang nodded repeatedly, smiling without a word. It wasn't really a matter of right or wrong. His goal was to defeat enemies in the conflict between north and south, between the Immortals and the Buddhists, and to expand the Buddhist Land. This was naturally different from a demonic cultivator's pursuit of resources. He only smiled and said,

"I'll just remind you of one thing, Fellow Daoist: don't forget that Tinglan and the others have only retreated..."

Helian Wumeng scoffed.

"Will Tinglan flee all the way to the Purple Smoke Blessed Land, or will she go to the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain to provide support? Do you think I'm stupid enough to attack the Purple Smoke Blessed Land? Take your band of trash and get lost!"

With that, he rode the wind, rising up and over the mountain. He left Xuwang standing there, his smile fading, his expression turning cold.

'A bunch of Northern Barbarians... If the Qi Emperor hadn't thrown them a few scraps, they'd still be herding horses in some forgotten corner. How dare they act so arrogant in front of my Seven Phases...'

It was common for the northern Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to look down on the Merciful Ones. These Daoist Masters often felt that only those at the Maha level were their equals. Direct disdain, like Helian Wumeng's, was not rare. Xuwang could only curse inwardly. He turned and asked,

"What are you all dawdling for? The quick get the prize, the slow get nothing! If we can intercept a retreating Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, that would be a huge gain!"

His status was clearly higher, and his question carried the weight of a command. Two of the remaining four immediately rose into the air and followed behind him.

"Please instruct us, Senior Brother!"



# Chapter 906: The Flying Mountain Descends

Caishan.

A sinister, evil energy pervaded the air. A mist of Azure Crow Qi roiled through the mountain forest, surging and receding like a restless tide.

A vast, dark shroud covered the sky, from which a thousand golden eyes flickered, casting down fine, swift beams of golden light. Below, the two Merciful Ones stood with dimmed auras, their faces etched with fury.

Daoist Master Luo gripped his short blade, his expression grave.

There had originally been four Merciful Ones here: one of the Way of Compassion and three of the Way of Emptiness. He and his ally had arrived early and eliminated one, leaving three.

One of the Way of Emptiness was no real threat, merely an annoyance. Another, however, served under the seat of Developing Wisdom and was quite resourceful. But the most lethal was the one from the Way of Compassion, the Merciful One who commanded Arhats. The three of them, united, were enough to suppress him.

Fortunately, his opponents were unfamiliar with the dao of Gathering Wood. The fight had dragged on long enough for him to strike down the weakest of them—who had fled to parts unknown. The remaining two were far less of a threat. Still, he too was growing weary. If not for the Thousand-Eye Nurturing Light Robe in his hands, which was specifically crafted to counter the Way of Compassion's methods of housing souls and commanding Arhats, he would be in far greater trouble...

He, Daoist Master Luo, was far from his limit, and farther still from defeat. Though he struggled to vanquish his enemies, the Merciful Ones' transformations were limited, making it even harder for them to capture him. The fiends merely cycled their Divine Abilities, occasionally sending beams of Azure Crow Qi soaring into the sky. Their spiritual senses remained active, still locked onto Li Ximing and the other person in the heavens. There was no doubt about it: Li Ximing, facing Helian Wujiang, was in even greater peril than he was.

***

Li Ximing’s true form manifested amidst the baleful aura. Golden-red flames coiled around him like coiling drakes, forcing back the roiling, congealed baleful qi.

Before him hovered the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, radiating a brilliant light that enveloped his Dharma body. To his side, a greenish-yellow spiritual ruler floated, emitting ripples of mountains and rivers. It not only repelled the surrounding sea of baleful aura time and again but also measured the illusions within it, reducing them to wisps of black smoke.

But his condition was far from good.

The battle hadn't been long, but he now lacked the Divine Ability or dharma power to restore the half of his head that had been bitten off. He retained that terrifying visage, his body covered in wounds from the baleful aura, which clung to him like persistent black smoke.

After clashing with Helian Wujiang for some time, he had begun to understand his opponent's strengths. Aside from that venomous, single eye on his chest, his Body Divine Ability was also exceptionally strange.

Li Ximing's Audience with the Celestial Gate could empower his Dharma body, but only to a limited extent. Helian Wujiang's Dharma body was significantly stronger. While not the most formidable in the Purple Mansion Realm, it was composed of countless layers of baleful aura.

This baleful aura gathered and dispersed without form. Spell arts below the Purple Mansion Realm could no longer harm him. Even Divine Abilities and spell arts *at* the Purple Mansion Realm level were slightly weakened upon impact. Most troublesome of all, this Body Divine Ability resonated with the 'Rakshasa Sea'—the baleful sea that now filled the sky—allowing him to recover continuously. He was incredibly difficult to deal with.

To make matters worse, his opponent's long whip was extremely agile. Li Ximing's Spiritual Artifacts and Divine Abilities were, on the whole, rather cumbersome. In just a few dozen exchanges, his opponent had already forced him to use the miraculous power of the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass twice—reversing the Bright Yang, shaking the stars, and escaping certain doom.

Each time he reversed the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, four bright stars would appear. Now that he had used it twice, two of those stars had dimmed. Although its power was undiminished—perhaps even more profound—his connection to the Spiritual Artifact limited him to only four such uses in total.

'I don't know how Kui Qi is faring. This Helian Wujiang is formidable. If this drags on... I'm going to be sacrificed here!'

It wasn't that his loyalty to the Supreme Yang was so profound, but Moongaze Lake was right by the river. He had no time for further hesitation. His spiritual sense locked tightly onto the sword-wielding figure within the black qi, not daring to relax for an instant.

As expected, Helian Wujiang gave him no quarter. A glint of golden light pierced through the roiling black qi once more, like a silver vase shattering. A chill shot up from his Shengyang Acupoint as an intense premonition of crisis washed over him.

"Om!"

He couldn't see his opponent's Spiritual Artifact or Dharma Art, but he preemptively activated Tread on Flames. The instant the flames ignited around him, he snapped his head up, focusing all his Divine Abilities and dharma power into a single point, his spiritual sense screaming at its absolute limit.

There was nothing.

"Omm..."

But the first thing to shatter was the greenish-yellow ripple of mountains and rivers. The vast range of the Shichuan and the measuring profundity of the Monarch's Balance worked in perfect concert. Li Ximing finally, faintly, perceived the direction of the attack. Tread on Flames flared, and he twisted his Divine Ability.

The Radiant Sun King's Halberd was incredibly cumbersome and, in that split second, impossible to swing in front of him. But as Li Ximing used Tread on Flames to step through the fire, he moved to place himself directly behind the Spiritual Artifact!

'The Radiant Sun King's Halberd can't move in time, but I can move to let it block for me!'

BOOM!

The gleaming Radiant Sun King's Halberd in the sky looked as if it had been struck by a heavy, iridescent blow. It was flung high, followed by a deafening crash and an explosion of Bright Yang radiance.

Li Ximing abruptly spat out a mouthful of blood and tumbled out of the flames from his Tread on Flames. A network of fine, hairline cracks appeared on his chest, like a swarm of tiny ants. Yet, a relieved smile touched the corner of his mouth.

Only then did he see it clearly. The iridescent object was pitch-black, blade-shaped, and no larger than a man's palm. It was exceptionally sharp—it was the short blade from Helian Wujiang's waist.

The blade's light was insidious. As the dust settled, the roiling sea of baleful aura finally began to part, revealing the gash the blade energy had torn through it.

The measuring power of the Shichuan had certainly played a huge role, but it was the Radiant Sun King's Halberd blocking the blow that had been key to saving his Dharma body from being severed. That short blade was terrifying. Whether it was the Shichuan or the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, anything put in its path would have been damaged. The Shichuan, being a spirit embryo, might even have been shattered... and that spirit embryo was crucial to maintaining the current stalemate. How could Li Ximing allow it to be so easily destroyed?

Blood wet his lips, but he had no time to rest. A Celestial Gate rose from beneath him, its Heavenly Light brilliant, suppressing the Dharma swords that lunged from the baleful qi. The attack forced the owner of those five pale fingers to shudder and reveal his form. He stood before Li Ximing, clad in black and silver armor, robes fluttering, gaze icy.

Helian Wujiang had arrived.

The Celestial Gate stood among the clouds, trembling slightly as it was engulfed by the rolling baleful aura. Its once-gleaming white bricks were now dull. Dragon banners and phoenix chariots plunged into the miasma; treasured canopies and streamers fell silent, flapping weakly against the baleful tide. It seemed the gate was failing to suppress the sword.

The bright Heavenly Light was momentarily blocked. The space between Helian Wujiang's heart and lungs suddenly split open, and that eye rotated once more. Golden light flared, freezing Li Ximing in place as that terrifying maw appeared again.

"Puchi!"

Li Ximing dissolved into fire and fled with his Divine Ability. The man snapped his head around, only to see a gleaming compass appear once more, its chaotic stars shaking and trapping him on the spot.

The man in the platinum Daoist robe materialized a short distance away, panting slightly as he immediately swallowed a pill.

The timing just now had been perfect, but Li Ximing hadn't had the chance to unleash the destructive light of the Bright Yang.

Half his head was still missing, and one arm had been lost to the enemy's binding-and-devouring attack moments before. His lips were still moving, chanting an incantation, as he used his Divine Ability to steady himself within the roiling baleful aura. He was a miserable sight.

On the other side, Helian Wujiang, draped in his black and silver armor, stared at him silently. The eye on his chest blinked slowly. He held a longsword in one hand and a Dharma whip in the other, his outer robe billowing in the wind.

The wound in his abdomen was healing amidst the baleful qi, seemingly no longer a major issue. However, streams of Bright Yang radiance flowed within it, constantly being suppressed by the baleful aura. Clearly, it wasn't just the chaotic stars holding him; Helian Wujiang was also focusing on mitigating the pressure in his stomach.

Meanwhile, a bright white gash had appeared on Helian Wujiang's shoulder, but it was already regenerating within the baleful qi. The longsword in his hand shimmered, clearly brewing another spell art.

'That demonic art is truly terrifying...'

Li Ximing showed no sign of despair, merely exhaling with suppressed frustration.

That eye was one of the most tyrannical Dharma Arts Li Ximing had ever encountered. It froze, then devoured. It was impossible to evade. The first time he'd seen it, he had been caught off guard, and as the fight intensified, dodging it had only become more difficult.

Yet Helian Wujiang seemed to be expending very little energy. The only sign of strain was the increasingly vibrant Bright Yang radiance in his gut. If he hadn't paused to suppress it, Li Ximing wouldn't have known he was burdened at all.

"Bang!"

As his longsword glowed and his whip recoiled, the light of the chaotic, shaking stars began to fade. That face, with its high brows and deep-set eyes, looked over once more.

Li Ximing's hand decisively pressed down on the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass again, once more in a reverse grip.

'He's preparing to flee...'

Helian Wujiang's expression darkened. The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass was an excellent item. The last retreat had already brought Li Ximing to the edge of the baleful sea. If he used it again, escape would be easy. All his effort would have been for nothing.

'A pity...'

Just then, a streak of Azure Crow Qi shot up from below, carrying a sinister demonic light, and latched onto Helian Wujiang's silver boot, causing the man to frown.

It was Daoist Master Luo, finding a moment to provide support.

Unlike the grave, cold focus he afforded Li Ximing, Helian Wujiang looked almost insulted. His brow furrowed deeply. His Dharma swords, which he had been about to sheathe, flashed out again, bursting with brilliance.

"A rat from a heretical sect... How dare you!"

But that wasn't all that rushed him. A black cloth covered in a thousand eyes followed—it was the Thousand-Eye Nurturing Light Robe, Daoist Master Luo's most famous possession, which he had spent a lifetime nurturing.

Helian Wujiang was dismissive, but his expression turned serious at the sight. He spat a breath of baleful qi onto his sword, which immediately flared with light, blocking the incoming sheet of golden beams.

But the moment his attention was divided, the Audience with the Celestial Gate rose from the other side, parting the baleful sea. A beam of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light shot across the sky!

'He's not fleeing? He's attacking instead...'

Helian Wujiang snapped his head back, raising one hand. He gathered the rolling baleful qi, forging it into a baleful ray to block the white light, letting the scorching Hidden Light burn against his defenses.

'In your current state, what threat could you possibly pose?!'

Li Ximing slowly raised his head. With his Dharma body so injured, the Heavenly Light couldn't emerge from his brow; it could only be released from his palm. Though only half a head remained, he tilted his face slightly. His hand, at last, seemed to grip the spiritual compass, as if preparing to escape.

But as his dharma power flowed into it, he silently, soundlessly chanted in his heart:

'Still not showing yourself? You've been lurking for so long, do you really have the patience to wait? Do you want to earn this favor from me or not? Because I'm leaving!'

"Splash..."

At that exact moment, rain began to fall again, this time with a faint purple tint. Helian Wujiang's pupils shrank. His eyes struggled to look up, and only then did he realize.

A pair of treasures had appeared from within the clouds.

One was a round, flat jade medallion, carved with square lightning patterns, like a palm-sized talisman. The other was a black, white-patterned object, similar to the Shichuan spiritual ruler but slightly smaller, and it gleamed brightly.

The flat, bright jade medallion had been gathering power for a long time. It unleashed a torrent of silver-white lightning, crackling with danger. The black, white-patterned talisman pulsed like a living thing, breathing out a torrent of crimson flames that arrived in an instant!

Helian Wujiang broke out in a cold sweat. The eye on his chest blinked once and actually flipped over, revealing its pitch-black reverse side.

Faced with lightning and fire, his first instinct was to protect the eye!

BOOM!

The silver-white lightning and crimson flames instantly drowned him, streaming down his gleaming black-and-silver armor and erupting in clouds of black smoke. The pervasive baleful qi shot into the sky as the 'Rakshasa Sea' boiled violently. Even his longsword was struck by the blast, and its torrent of baleful energy and lightning was forced to stop.

"Awoooo—"

This lightning-flame was clearly potent and had been stored for some time. It made the man in the sky tremble violently and let out a blood-curdling shriek, causing everyone on the battlefield to pause.

But it was far from over. Daoist Master Luo, having made his move, quickly turned to block the pursuing Merciful Ones. Above Helian Wujiang, however, the rain clouds dispersed, revealing a towering white, flying mountain peak that pierced the heavens!

The Great Void immediately began to heave, as if suppressed by an immense weight. A layer of hazy white light crept onto Helian Wujiang's armor, seeming to lock him in place.

Helian Wujiang's pupils instantly turned blood-red. Wisps of baleful aura streamed from the corners of his eyes, flowing down his cheeks. The Incessant Calamity shifted, and countless peaks of black qi surged forth to collide with the flying white mountain in the sky.

"Clang..."

Caught off guard, he spat out a mouthful of black blood. The wounds on his face, deep enough to show bone, slowly began to close. His deep-set eyes stared fixedly at the sky.

"Who!"

But the lightning and fire in the sky only grew more ferocious, revealing a young man.

He rode a scaled, avian beast and wore a deep blue, intricately patterned robe. His face was youthful, his chin slightly pointed, giving him a handsome appearance. He cradled a sword, his long hair unbound and scattering in the wind.

The young man's eyes were bright. He smiled and announced:

"White Ye Immortal Sect, Yehui."

As soon as he spoke, a dense rain of purple, iridescent fish fell from the sky. Each was the size of a calf, with scales of varying shades, and each wore a white, skeletal human head. They blotted out the sky, transforming into a torrent of purple water.

Sorrowful Southern Water

Eastern Feather Mountain is a flying mountain, a spirit-monster of the earth and rivers, given wings to become a suspended peak. Sorrowful Southern Water is a river of the netherworld, a demon-ghost of the streams, wearing human heads to become an irretrievable current. Now, as it descended, it beat down the baleful aura, shattering it into motes of cold, dark energy that fell to the earth.

Just who was Yehui? He was the heir to the orthodox Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition, from the same lineage as Changxiao. Helian Wujiang, caught off guard, found his Divine Abilities greatly diminished and was in imminent danger. The lightning and fire still refused to cease, crashing down upon him.

"Hahahahahaha!"

With Yehui's appearance, Daoist Master Luo's true colors were revealed. He looked like a petty villain who had just gotten his way. Though his rash attack had earned him a beating from the two monks, scattering his dark energy, his face was filled with a gleeful, vindicated smile. He nodded to Yehui from afar.

Clearly, Daoist Master Luo's intervention had not come from nowhere. He obviously had a close relationship with Yehui and had been tipped off long in advance. That was why he had disregarded his own safety to pin Helian Wujiang down!

"Yehui! Have you thought this through?!"

The situation had reversed in an instant. The large-bellied monk on the other side roared in fury, grinding his teeth.

"You come from a clean background and could have stayed out of this! But you chose to stand with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Don't blame us for being merciless!"

The young man in the sky looked amicable enough. He merely smiled at the words, but his eyes were filled with an icy, boiling rage.

"Bald donkeys... You bring three or four Merciful Ones to my very doorstep, abduct my disciples, attack my mountain gate, and demand my juniors surrender. And now you ask me if I want to 'stay out of it'?"

"I'll 'stay out' of your mother's bald head."



# Chapter 907: Shattered Jade

Thunder and crimson fire rained from the heavens. Helian Wujiang knew Yehui's appearance spelled the end of any possible truce. He didn't waste words questioning him as the monk had. Instead, black qi streamed from his eyes as he channeled his divine ability, resisting the deluge of purple water.

Yehui hailed from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. Helian Wujiang was already exhausted from a long battle and had now lost the initiative. He was instantly plunged into dire straits. The deep-black 'Rakshasa Sea' that had blanketed the sky was suppressed by the purple water, dissolving into frigid mist and tumbling away, gradually revealing the bright sky above.

Li Ximing used an ability to hover in the air, seizing a momentary respite. The medicinal pill he had taken began to work. His dharma power, which had been sluggish and constrained by the baleful qi, started to flow smoothly once more, circulating through his Dharma Body.

The great battle was already past its peak when Helian Wujiang appeared. Just as that Spiritual Blade cut its way toward him, Daoist Master Luo's voice finally echoed in his ear, announcing the arrival of reinforcements.

Li Ximing didn't quite trust him. He used his 'Shadowsight' ability to investigate and only then discovered the reinforcement was Yehui.

'If Yehui showed up, I wouldn't know if he was here to help me or kill me. To Helian Wujiang, Yehui is just a nuisance. But to me, in my current state, he's lethal. Yehui isn't Helian Wujiang. Several of his Capital Guard abilities can influence the Great Void—escaping from him is a challenge of an entirely different magnitude.'

'By all rights, I should have fled already. The only reassuring fact was that this Daoist Master had been waiting silently in the Great Void near Helian Wujiang, not lurking near me.'

Now, the two were locked in combat. Li Ximing assisted with his own abilities and spell arts while simultaneously consuming pills to regulate his breathing. He soon regained a stable footing among the clouds, his heart a tangle of complex emotions.

'So, the day has actually come... where I'm fighting on the same side as Yehui.'

Helian Wujiang's situation became desperate.

Yehui's 'Sorrowful Southern Water' and 'Eastern Feather Mountain' abilities created a lockdown. His Capital Guard techniques, designed to exorcise ghosts and animate spirits, proved strangely effective against the baleful qi. The 'Sorrowful Southern Water' in particular completely neutralized the 'Sea of Rakshasa'. The skies were swept clean of baleful qi, leaving only a howling, frigid wind that felt like the precursor to a blizzard.

With his 'Sea of Rakshasa' broken, the divine power of Helian Wujiang's Dharma Body was greatly diminished. The lightning in the sky, however, continued to strike relentlessly. Worse, Li Ximing was harassing him from the sidelines. Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light and the Radiant Celestial Wave Art kept him pinned. A strike of Heavenly Light from one side, a wave of Radiance from the other, and Shichuan dispelling any illusion he tried to form—it was an impossible situation.

After several more exchanges, Helian Wujiang was set on retreating. He commanded his black qi to weave through the lightning, neutralizing Yehui's Dharma Arts, until at last, his fingers closed around the short blade at his waist!

"Omm..."

Yehui just laughed.

He had been observing from the sidelines for a long time and was intimately familiar with Helian Wujiang's techniques. How could he forget this one? With a light flick of his finger, the thunder and fire in the sky converged, and from within their depths, a hazy, yellow brilliance emerged.

Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release!

This Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release had been brewing for who knows how long, hidden within the clouds. It was a technique from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. Once the profound light locked on, it was impossible to shake, near or far. When used against a Spiritual Artifact, it had the divine effect of severing the item's connection to its wielder's ability and revealing its true form.

It now shot from Yehui's fingertip, seeming both far and near as it circled. The short blade's intended target—Yehui—seemed to split like a mirror image, and the attack was diverted, striking the profound light instead.

The Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release, like a shadow beneath the moon, then split from its end into three hazy afterimages. A soft sound echoed:

"Bang!"

One of the three hazy afterimages vanished. The purple water was rent apart by the churning blade-qi. Helian Wujiang's expression was grim. The pitch-black short blade reappeared before him, the power on the Spiritual Artifact still surging. Though undamaged, it had clearly failed to find its mark.

Yehui didn't wait, striding forward on the lightning.

Helian Wujiang's reaction was instantaneous. Black smoke billowed from his feet as his escape arts activated, ready to spirit him away.

But the young man before him simply smiled and raised a palm.

'Western Heaven Plateau!'

The Great Void warped. Snow began to fall over a sudden, impossibly steep landscape. An endless gale, carrying flurries of snow, materialized from nothing beside him.

The wind, a pale azure, closed in and locked Helian Wujiang in place. Yehui's long hair whipped about in the gale. The two remaining Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release streams shot from a distance and merged into the back of his head. A fiery, electric light ignited in his pupils. His voice boomed like thunder:

"Hah!"

The shout itself was unremarkable, but empowered by the Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release, it struck Helian Wujiang's spirit. His body shuddered, his eyes glazed over with confusion, and his defenses shattered. Yehui, already before him, formed his palm into a blade and chopped down.

The blow instantly tore him open, sending baleful qi spilling out. But Helian Wujiang was no easy foe. His mouth gaped open, swelling to the size of a man. The bloody maw inhaled Yehui's attack and spat out a white talisman.

The talisman unfurled to a length of over ten feet, dissolving the incoming light as it draped itself over him. Though Helian Wujiang coughed up blood, his baleful qi scattering, wounded by the spell arts and unable to gather his power, he still managed to summon a gust of wind that blew him back several yards.

Having gained a moment's distance, Helian Wujiang didn't hesitate. He activated 'Incessant Calamity,' and his body dissolved into roiling clouds of baleful qi, scattering in every direction.

Yehui smiled coldly. The talismans in the sky began to activate, but a sound like a landslide and a tsunami roared from the distant horizon. Thunder cracked as a sheet of white qi rose, sweeping the crimson light from the sky.

His expression shifted. The ability in his hands halted. A sudden, deep wariness made him hesitate, and a name surfaced in his mind:

"Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao... Wei Xuanyin!"

In that brief instant of hesitation, as Helian Wujiang's form scattered into black qi, two golden, scaled insects burst free from the dispersing mist.

The creatures had twelve feet, two wings, and four-segmented bodies covered in fine scales. They trailed multicolored light and a furious wind, rising like dragons shedding their chains. Emitting a brilliant golden glow, they shot forward like meteors.

"Excellent!"

Li Ximing was overjoyed. He stepped forward, allowing one of the wind-riding insects to land on his disfigured face. The creature seemed to roll over in delight before coiling inside his nasal cavity. White bone emerged, flesh and sinew knitted together, and his brilliant golden eyes manifested once more.

The other scaled insect writhed, spat blood, and died. Its corpse attached itself to his severed limb. It transformed into long bone, its own flesh transmuting into muscle and skin. The arm that had been bitten off reappeared, fully restored.

These two scaled insects were, in fact, his own severed body parts, transformed!

The severed parts had been suppressed by Helian Wujiang's power, not yet refined. Now that he was forced to disperse into baleful qi and flee for his life, the body parts obediently returned to their master.

Now, Li Ximing was bathed in radiant Heavenly Light. Though a faint line remained on the bridge of his nose, it was barely visible without close inspection. At least his Dharma Body no longer looked so wretched.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

The baleful qi receded, and the purple water dissipated. Yehui made no move to pursue. He turned back and smiled.

"Long time no see."

Helian Wujiang's retreat was inevitable. Yehui had waited long on the sidelines; appearing just to force him back would have been enough. But he had gone further, using his spell arts to break his opponent's technique and free the trapped body parts. This was a clear show of goodwill. Despite his unease, Li Ximing inclined his head.

"My thanks, Daoist Friend..."

But before he could finish, a soft *clack* sounded at his waist.

"Clack!"

The jade talisman at his waist flashed faintly, a web of cracks spreading across its surface. With a flicker of black light, it instantly exploded into fine powder that drifted down his robes.

'This is bad...'

Li Ximing's heart sank, and a chill crept over him.

'That talisman was from Kui Qi of the Great Xiukui Monastery. I had one, and Daoist Master Luo had one. We could sense each other through them, and they were our signal to act... For it to shatter now... it's a signal to drop everything and return to the defenses at Tangdao Mountain immediately.'

'I'm afraid something has happened to Kui Qi...'

'Ever since Helian Wujiang appeared, I knew this would be trouble. My only comfort was that Kui Qi had sent the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. That suggested he had, at least, anticipated Helian Wujiang's arrival...'

'But the shattering talisman confirms my fears.' He raised his head, gazing north.

The sky was dim, flickering erratically. The crimson glow on the horizon was receding at an incredible speed, but there were no other signs of disturbance.

'It's likely being concealed by some treasure. The fact that I can't see a massive flare of light... is definitely not a good sign.'

With Helian Wujiang gone, the two monks had no choice but to retreat into the Great Void. Daoist Master Luo made no attempt to delay them or team up with Yehui for a killing blow; he had clearly been startled by his own talisman shattering. He turned, saw Yehui standing with his hands clasped behind his back, and said, his face wrought with anxiety:

"Let's go, let's go! We have to leave now!"

Neither of them was inclined to linger. Li Ximing was injured and didn't want to stay. They immediately prepared to enter the Great Void, only to see Yehui's expression darken.

"Leave? And where are you two Daoist Friends going?"

The question was grim, but it had to be faced. They had no idea how the main forces of the Supreme Yang Dao were faring. Should they return to their own sects, or proceed to Tangdao Mountain?

Though none of the three spoke, the gravity of the situation needed no words.

If the Supreme Yang Dao had been victorious and was retreating from Luoxia, their first priority would have been to relieve their allies. One or two Daoist Masters should have arrived by now to deal with those Merciful Ones, or at the very least, to provide support and cover a safe retreat.

But there wasn't a single shadow. There was only the shattered talisman—a highest-level alert demanding all forces converge on Tangdao Mountain. It all pointed to one conclusion: the Supreme Yang Dao hadn't fought to a draw. They had likely suffered a minor defeat, or perhaps... a complete rout.

'Kui Qi's plan was unexpected, but it seems the enemy countered it. If Helian Wujiang could appear here, how few people could be at Luoxia? How few at Xiaoshi Mountain?'

'If Yehui hadn't been here, Caishan would have ended in a minor defeat as well. And Yehui doesn't have a warning talisman. His presence wasn't pre-arranged with the Supreme Yang Dao. If it had been, he should have gone to Luoxia. Caishan isn't the decisive battleground!'

'He must have rushed back from overseas to protect his sect... He probably has his own agenda, but even so, the other two battlefields won't be lucky enough to have a Yehui show up to help!'

'Going to Tangdao Mountain... I can't say if it's safe. I have the Immortal Mirror; I could detect an ambush if the Northern forces had won and were lying in wait. But regardless, there would certainly be one or two battles to fight, and my current condition is terrible.'

'Even though I recovered two parts of my Dharma Body, which greatly reduces the time and effort for repair, those parts are saturated with unstable baleful qi. I don't have time to refine it. For the short term, it's no different from not having them back at all...'

'If I go over in this state, I'm not even confident I could win against a Merciful One.'

Li Ximing looked up at Daoist Master Luo, only to see his grim expression.

"That's hard to say," Daoist Master Luo said. "While I urgently need that cultivation method from Fairy Ning, the Supreme Yang Dao has many cultivators. It would be better if Hengzhu wasn't there, but with the Chunyi Dao Gate present, they'll inevitably look down on me. It's not convenient for me to just waltz into Tangdao..."

"I will follow along in the Great Void. I'll just trouble you, Daoist Friend, to mention me to the others. If a major battle breaks out, I can appear and provide support!"

Daoist Master Luo was a fiend from the Southern Borderlands and inherently cunning. With these words, he pushed the entire burden onto Li Ximing. Li Ximing's mind raced.

'A defeat at Luoxia means they've scattered. It's questionable if the allied Daoist Masters will even go to Tangdao Mountain...'

'If I were the Northern Buddhists, where would I go now? Tangdao Mountain?'

'It has to be Xiaoshi Mountain!'

'The great array at Tangdao Mountain can't cover the entire Tangdao Mountain Range. The outer ridges are protected only by smaller, ordinary formations. Right in front is Xiaoshi Mountain, where Tinglan is. As long as the cultivators there hold, it's fine. But if it falls, the Northern forces can punch straight through to Baijiang Creek! Why would those Buddhist cultivators and demonic cultivators bother trying to crack the hardest nut?'

'If Baijiang Creek is lost, all the families on the shore will be in jeopardy. Their retreat will be cut off, and I'll be forced to return to the northern bank myself!'

His expression turned grim. He cupped his hands.

"Pardon me, everyone. I must go to Xiaoshi Mountain first. If Daoist Friend Tinglan has retreated... the Northern forces might already be pushing into Baijiang Creek. The fire is at my own doorstep!"

Without waiting for a reply, Li Ximing transformed into a streak of light and sped away. Daoist Master Luo started to speak, then stopped, watching him go with a puzzled expression.

"Zhaojing is in that condition. Even if someone really is attacking Moongaze Lake, what can he do? Isn't he just throwing his life away? If you ask me, he should be finding a corner to heal. Both places are dangerous; why walk right into a trap?"

He then glanced at Yehui, only to find the young man's expression was just as sour.

'...Baijiang Creek is at the Li Clan's doorstep, but isn't it at the Capital immortals Dao's as well?'

Daoist Master Luo had a sudden realization and immediately said:

"Brother, are you going too?"

But Yehui narrowed his eyes and shook his head. He was not Li Ximing. Frankly, aside from the Guan Gongxiao siblings, he didn't care about anyone else. He certainly didn't care about the casualties among the common folk or cultivators in his territory. He just waved his hand.

"Why worry so much? My mountain gate has a Purple Mansion great array; it won't be broken so easily. The worst that can happen is the population and resources get plundered. Those two siblings are still at Tangdao Mountain. I'll go with you. At the very least, I need to get them out."

The fiend sighed, summoned an Azure Crow Qi wind, and rode his ability south toward Tangdao Mountain with Daoist Master Luo. "You've been away all these years. Did you find anything good?" he asked.

Yehui's relationship with him was surprisingly close. He waved his hand.

"Nothing much. I fought with Changxiao over a treasure from the Encompassing Profoundity and spent a few years recovering. Now that I'm back, I suspect he's going to defect to the Northern side."

Daoist Master Luo mulled this over and replied:

"I have a feeling this time is different. Wei Xuanyin is not an easy man to plot against. He will definitely come this time. If the Way of Compassion still gives their full support, people are going to die."

Yehui's expression was neutral. Daoist Master Luo chuckled.

"It just has nothing to do with me... Who cares? As long as I get the cultivation method, it's fine. If the situation drags out into a stalemate, and the fight lasts a long time, maybe I can pick up a few more things... That would be wonderful."

"Look, the Northern side plays the villain and carves flesh from them. We play the hero... and don't we also carve flesh from them? Someone always has to be fed. Look at that Zhaojing. His Daoist tradition is orthodox, and look how much he's already devoured. Our interests align, and the Supreme Yang is just more generous."

"It's rare for a demonic cultivator like me to get a few scraps of oil, and now you're running over to share in the profits!"

Daoist Master Luo pointed at him with a laugh. Yehui, standing with his hands behind his back, wasn't annoyed. He just chuckled.

"You fiend!"

Daoist Master Luo sneered and replied:

"Fiend? I may be a fiend, but at least I don't plot against my own apprentices and children. Even when I harvest blood qi, I take it from wicked tyrants and landlords in remote valleys—people who have nothing to do with me. If I'm a fiend, what does that make the likes of Sumian and Qulei? You might as well just call them animals."

That word, 'animals,' made Yehui lower his head slightly. His lips moved, and with his gaze downcast, he murmured:

"The quest for survival, for strength, for freedom... it's not something that can be judged by conscience or morality."

"Heh!"

Daoist Master Luo spat. For all these years, he had been branded a fiend by the people of Jiangnan and those further north. Though he never said it, he was clearly unhappy about it. With a sarcastic look, he retorted:

"Then you tell me, besides conscience itself, what *is* judged by conscience? As for how 'radiant' the Supreme Yang Dao is, I think Li Jiangqun knows best! The opera they're performing today is the same one they performed on the lake five hundred years ago!"

...

Baijiang Creek.

The lush vegetation swayed in the gale, bent low to the ground. Not a single person was in sight. There was only a relentless, sun-blotting wind churning the clouds...

A sound like rolling thunder echoed from the horizon, punctuated by the continuous shattering of formations. Streaks of golden light tore through the sky, kicking up flurries of leaves. A lone figure, cloaked in a frigid wind, flew just above the ground.

It was a one-armed man. He was covered in filth, his face streaked with blood. Though handsome, his desperate flight and injuries made him look wretched. Blood kept welling up in his mouth, but he dared not spit, lest it freeze and reveal his trail. He had no choice but to swallow it back down.

'Xiaoshi Mountain is finished... Outside the main array at Tangdao Mountain, it's a sea of blood... Master Monks everywhere, but not a single Daoist Master in sight...'

Deep, residual terror filled his eyes.

Fei Qing'yi hadn't been assigned to the Tangdao Mountain garrison for long. The first batch of Li family cultivators had followed Li Jiangxia into Baijiang Creek. After consolidating, they left a few units behind and led the Capital immortals Dao forces to Tangdao Mountain.

It wasn't until the Buddhist cultivators became more active that the Li family sent a second wave of reinforcements, led by Fei Qing'yi himself. The Lord Wen assigning personnel heard his name and placed him on the relatively quiet southern flank...

But he never expected Xiaoshi Mountain to be conquered, attacked by three Merciful Ones. Not only did no Daoist Master emerge from the main array, but the garrison was also in dire straits. Fortunately, the formation Fei Qing'yi was guarding was remote, so he still received news. He had no intention of dying for the Supreme Yang Dao. Seeing the formations, large and small, fall one after another, he immediately abandoned his post, left his cultivators behind, and fled.

He hadn't expected to be pursued by several Master Monks, whose numbers only grew along the way, forming an imposing force. He didn't dare fight back, simply fleeing despite his injuries. He ran all the way to the border of Baijiang Creek before the group of Master Monks, apparently wary of something, finally dispersed.

He dragged himself here, at the end of his rope. He checked his surroundings—it was Manghuazi Mountain, still a good distance from the lake. Suddenly, a heaven-shaking gale erupted around him. Black clouds blotted out the sun, as if he had entered a demon realm.

This terrified him so much his limbs went weak. He turned to run, but had barely gone any distance when a beam of demonic light descended, smashing into the frigid wind at his feet with a *boom*. The impact scattered his protective qi and made him spray a mouthful of blood. The demonic light leaped and coiled, wrapping around his torso. His vision went black.

He heard only the rush of wind, and then his vision returned:

*Thump!*

He had been thrown impossibly high and had tumbled onto a cloud, landing on dark, swirling baleful qi. He knew he was done for. He scrambled to his feet but didn't dare look up. He caught a glimpse of a line of cultivators standing on either side and immediately kowtowed.

"Greetings, my lord! Greetings, my lord!"

"Oh?"

The person at the head of the group sounded like a young man. Then, he heard someone to his left say with a tremble:

"R-reporting, my lord... This subordinate was negligent... I let an Immortal cultivator slip through..."

"Hahahaha!"

A hearty laugh came from the head of the group, his tone casual.

"What does it matter? My men are all scattered across several prefectures, plundering everywhere. Who has time to watch our backs?"

Fei Qing'yi was sweating profusely. He saw a pair of silver-white boots stop in front of him, and a voice spoke from above:

"Even if your defenses were tight, you couldn't have stopped this man. Xuwang sent him down personally. He's from Moongaze Lake, and we have a use for him right now. If he renders meritorious service, Xuwang will want him back! If he fell into your hands and was killed for nothing, who would Xuwang complain to?"

Fei Qing'yi felt a chill all over, frozen in place. He was in the Foundation Establishment Realm, after all, and had heard plenty about the affairs of the north and south. How could he not understand the meaning behind those words? He didn't know how to respond, but he suddenly felt his throat tighten as he was lifted into the air by a powerful force.

The Purple Mansion Daoist Master before him wore armor under a feathered cloak. He was handsome, but his eyes were cold. One hand gripped a long-handled saber-glaive, while the other held Fei Qing'yi up before him.

"Don't play dead. Li Ximing is still at Caishan; he can't get here right now. Even if he escaped with his life, he's just hiding in some corner. And even if he did come, he'd be on the verge of death from his wounds."

"I can't break that Purple Mansion array in a short time, but I can't just let this juicy piece of meat sit right in front of me!"

He saw the man before him give a bright smile and said softly:

"I know your Fei Clan is on the northern bank. You don't need to worry. If this fails, you'll die, of course. But the northern bank? I can take it with a snap of my fingers. Your Fei family will be allowed to leave this place and go to Monan. If you succeed, the Northern Buddhists will certainly give you a good position."

Fei Qing'yi, trapped in his grasp, felt his will to survive erupt. He suddenly became calm, stared directly into the man's eyes, and replied:

"I only hope that my lord keeps his word."

"Hahahaha!"

The silver-armored man laughed and set him down, planting his saber-glaive in the ground. He began to applaud.

"You don't need to worry about that. I am Helian Wumeng of the Tiefu Kingdom's royal family. I have no reason to go back on my word!"



# Chapter 908: Scheming on the North Bank

"The people of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition are finished this time, and the riverbank is about to suffer for it. It's your good fortune, being able to reap some benefits by coming over to the north."

After saying this, Helian Wumeng laughed. "The Li Clan is a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan, after all. If I planted a divine ability in you, I'm afraid it would be discovered as soon as you crossed the river and reached the lake. Fortunately, Xuwang already used his own marvels to fix your fate and has even reserved a place for you in the Buddhist Land. You have no escape."

"If this succeeds, you'll gain a long-lived position as a Buddhist cultivator. If it fails... you'll die without a complete corpse, your very soul scattered to the winds."

Fei Qing'yi understood little about the ways of Buddhist cultivators, but the words sent a chill down his spine. He felt in his heart that the Li Clan had treated him well, but no matter how well, what could be more important than his life? With death staring him in the face, his heart turned to ice. Worse, the position of a Buddhist cultivator was dangled as bait. Hearing the Daoist Master's words, his indecision faded. He kowtowed.

"Please, Milord, instruct me..."

Helian Wumeng settled into his seat among the clouds and gave a casual command.

"When you return, you'll claim your orders and bring my people with you. They will be disguised as Southern cultivators, claiming to have fled a defeat in the north. Once you enter the grand formation and meet the Li family, just seize a few key figures. The matter will be settled."

Fei Qing'yi froze. The Li family's protocols for granting an audience were incredibly strict. It was nothing like this northern barbarian imagined. Following this plan would be throwing his life away. He immediately dropped to his knees, frantically protesting, "Milord, you misunderstand! Moongaze Lake is bound by endless rules. It's impossible to get an audience with the Li family's core members!"

Helian Wumeng wasn't surprised in the least. He regarded him with a knowing, playful smile and nodded. "Oh? Then why don't you propose a plan?"

As Fei Qing'yi met that gaze, the realization struck him.

'He's testing me!'

All his minor schemes vanished. He knelt, his limbs ice-cold. The fear in his heart solidified, paradoxically giving rise to a hysterical calm. He spoke respectfully, "The Li family's core members are extraordinary. They carry many profound treasures and are difficult to deceive. Li Jiangqian is known for his sharp mind, and Li Que'wan is even more skilled in divination... This humble one dares to ask... does Milord want to capture people, or seize items?"

Helian Wumeng's smile faded. "Either. But people are better."

Fei Qing'yi kowtowed. "In this humble one's insignificant opinion, I should use these injuries... go to the lake and report that the... the Tangdao Mountain Range has been breached in several places and urgently requires reinforcements."

Helian Wumeng shot him a glance. He had brought his people south for a reason. He'd had the Buddhist cultivators attack the Tangdao Mountain Range to pin down the injured Tinglan as she returned to the formation. He had immediately unleashed demonic cultivators to plunder Xiaoshi Mountain in the rear, cutting communications and maintaining the illusion, all while infiltrating Baijiang Creek ahead of time. He had his own comprehensive plan; how could he not understand the stakes? He merely said, "You think he'll send his core members? I doubt he'll send anyone at all."

Fei Qing'yi shook his head. "They certainly won't. Why would they need to? Milord is right here by the river. Just dispatch a few men to stir up trouble, acting as demonic cultivators. The lake fancies itself the righteous path. As long as they're sure a Purple Mansion Realm expert won't cross the river, how can they possibly sit back and ignore it?"

"I'll tell you exactly what to say!"

Helian Wumeng laughed heartily and paced in front of him. After muttering a few more instructions, he kicked the young man in the shoulder, sending the white-robed youth tumbling. "It's always easy for a divine ability to scheme against a mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... But are you really this terrified of dying?"

Fei Qing'yi just said, "Milord jests. Who isn't afraid of dying? This humble one can die, of course, but I cannot die like this! And I cannot die *now*!"

He kowtowed again and again. With a wave of his hand, Helian Wumeng dismissed Fei Qing'yi from the cloud. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, smiling broadly. A subordinate beside him quickly asked, "Milord, our relations with the Buddhist cultivators have always been poor... How can we let Xuwang get off so easily?"

"Haha!" Helian Wumeng shook his head, his gaze fixed on the distant formation over the lake. "Of course I won't. The man truly was just handed over by the Buddhist cultivators. His fate might be spoken for, but as for a 'position' or 'dying without a corpse'? Nonsense! It was just enough to scare him. I can't even figure out the Buddhist cultivators' tricks, so how could someone surnamed Fei? It's just a shame I don't possess a Life Divine Ability. Otherwise, none of this trouble would be necessary!"

"We must use this southern push to harvest as much blood qi as possible, but we have to be quick. After all, once those few Daoist Masters are routed and return, we'll be deep in enemy territory, isolated and unaided. That will be a real problem."

The subordinate nodded repeatedly in admiration, then added a reminder, "Aside from that, Milord, you wish to capture those core members to exchange for treasures... but... if that Daoist Master Zhaojing truly escaped, it won't take him long to arrive at his Purple Mansion Realm speed. If we dally too long, we might not have time..."

"Heh..." Helian Wumeng shook his head, amused. "Li Jiangqian? Li Que'wan? If they can't draw out Li Ximing, what value do they have?"

"As long as he comes, he'll be forced to save them. And even if he doesn't, if he tries to charge straight into the formation, he won't be able to avoid being wounded by my baleful energy divine ability. He'll be the easiest one to track..."

He gave a sinister laugh. "What did you think we came here to snatch?"

"If his timing is right, I'll just kill him along with them. That would be ideal. But if he doesn't dare to show, I'll abduct those guest elders and core members anyway. Once they're in my hands, exchanging them for the Li family's Purple Mansion Realm resources, spirit embryos, and Spiritual Artifacts... well, how hard could that be?"

***

Purple pillars pierced the sky, interspersed with pavilions and terraces shrouded in morning mist. Austere, noble patterns flowed with power inside the grand formation. Qu Bushi ascended the steps, crossed the threshold of the main hall, and bowed deeply toward the palace's interior.

The head of the hall was dim. The left window was shut tight, admitting no light, and only a few dharma lamps flickered. The main seat was empty. To the side sat a man in golden robes, holding a jade slip in one hand, which he used to lightly tap his other.

A woman sat opposite him. The side door to her right was slightly ajar, and a sliver of bright light fell across her robes. Qu Bushi, having paid his respects in the inner hall, looked toward the two core members of the Moongaze Immortal Clan who were now making the decisions. "Reporting to the Family Head," he said respectfully, "there is no news from the north. We hear the Xiaoshi Mountain region is in chaos, that the northern cultivators have invaded... It is said... many have died. We just haven't seen any life jades shatter."

"Life jades aren't always accurate for matters involving the Purple Mansion Realm."

The man was, of course, Li Jianglong. It had been some time since he had taken over the lake's affairs from his elder brother. He pressed down on the jade slip, his expression clouded with doubt. "There is a major Purple Mansion Realm battle at Xiaoshi Mountain. It's inevitable that demonic cultivators have slipped through. The Baijiang Creek area is likely full of them. With communications cut, if we still try to defend Baijiang Creek, I'm afraid we'll be overrun."

On the other side, Li Que'wan whispered, "But... it's only been a single day!"

Li Jianglong understood her meaning.

The day Kan Ziyu broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Li Ximing had emerged from seclusion and left. Li Que'wan had also quickly ended her own seclusion to travel to Purple Smoke and offer congratulations. Shortly after, a letter arrived from a cultivator at the Purple Smoke Blessed Land, stating that Daoist Master Zhaojing was resting there and would personally attend the grand banquet in three days to celebrate the new Daoist Master of the Purple Smoke Gate.

But in a flash, the world had trembled. The northern clouds flared bright and then extinguished. The ground shook violently from the direction of Xiaoshi Mountain, like a landslide or a tsunami, a terrifying sight.

By her calculations, the Purple Smoke Gate's banquet was less than a day away. It was even possible the guests from the various houses hadn't yet been seated!

This was why Li Jianglong's expression was so grim. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, fearing a joint plot by several Maha, had kept everything strictly confidential. From the perspective of the Li family and all of Jiangnan's cultivators, the north had seized the perfect opportunity to invade, striking just as Jiangnan's Daoist traditions gathered to celebrate.

Musing on this, he couldn't help but ask, "What word from my elder brother?"

Ever since the trouble started and contact was lost, Li Jiangqian had pulled his people back from Baijiang Creek to guard the north bank. At the question, Qu Bushi quickly replied, "This news came directly from him, milord. He killed several demonic cultivators today who rashly tried to cross south. Their cultivation levels weren't considered high."

As he pondered, Li Que'wan spoke. "If the Northern Buddhists invaded, they couldn't have breached the Tangdao Mountain Range instantly. It wouldn't take long for our Purple Mansion Realm experts to get there. Perhaps we just lost the initiative. The situation at Xiaoshi Mountain is unstable, and with no news, it's said to be surrounded by demonic cultivators. We shouldn't rashly cross the river to investigate."

"I know that." Li Jianglong's gaze swept over the empty main seat, his thoughts unreadable. He raised an eyebrow. "Daoist Master..."

But before he could finish, a clamor of footsteps arose from below. Cui Jueyin entered, his expression heavy. "Fei Qing'yi has fled back from the north! He's here asking for reinforcements!"

Li Jianglong's expression changed. He strode forward two paces, frowning. "Did he come straight into the formation?"

"He did not. He is waiting respectfully outside."

Cui Jueyin's answer seemed to put Li Jianglong slightly at ease. He turned to the woman beside him. Li Que'wan had one hand resting lightly, the other idly turning a small jade tablet. Her eyes were closed. After a long moment, she opened them.

"Let him in."

Li Jianglong assumed she had just performed a calculation with her shamanic arts and nodded quickly. He watched as the white-robed youth, his arm missing, staggered in from outside the hall. Fei Qing'yi collapsed to his knees and cried, "The mountains are in crisis! I beg the family to dispatch reinforcements!"

He then gave a brief account, from the chaos in the north to his escape from the formation. He deliberately omitted any mention of the Merciful Ones, saying only that the enemy was fierce and help was desperately needed. "If those positions fall, the enemy will have a clear path south. The river itself will be the next line of defense! Fortunately, Milord himself said that the northern Purple Mansion experts would not cross the river, and their main force is at the Tangdao Mountain Range. We just need to fend off the rogue cultivators and demonic cultivators coming south!"

The man was visibly agitated, his limbs trembling. Li Jianglong listened intently, his eyes sweeping over him. "Only you?"

"Reporting to Milord..." Fei Qing'yi began to stammer. But after only a few words, Li Jianglong, who was not easily fooled, sensed something was wrong. He shot to his feet, his expression turning stormy. "What is it you're hiding!"

The outburst sent Fei Qing'yi sprawling, his forehead pressed so tightly to the floor that only the back of his head was visible. "This subordinate... this subordinate lied!" he cried. "The situation was critical. There were many of the family's Qi Refining cultivators in the formation... Even though I had some strength to spare... I didn't have time... I... I only saved myself..."

This wasn't such a grievous crime. Li Jianglong helped him up, noticing the man was so overcome with emotion he could barely open his eyes. "Protector Fei has endured much."

Fei Qing'yi's voice was hoarse. "This subordinate means... with Purple Mansion experts fighting at Xiaoshi Mountain and Baijiang Creek, it's incredibly dangerous. Even though the north is asking for aid, we shouldn't necessarily go. We could be killed by the aftershocks of their battle halfway there. We should focus all efforts on defending the north bank, to prevent the demonic cultivators from harming the common folk!"

"As I fled, I saw many demonic cultivators heading south. The situation is urgent! I wish to atone for my failure and prove my heart for protecting the clan!"

'As long as the Purple Mansion experts don't cross the river, defending the north bank won't be that difficult.'

He had first proposed the impossible (a full rescue), then offered this compromise, which made his report seem more credible. Li Jianglong was moved. "I will make the arrangements... Have Protector An Siwei and Guest Elder Sun brought here!"

Fei Qing'yi kept his head bowed, saying nothing, tears streaming down his face.

But then Li Jianglong's tone shifted. "The north bank must be defended," he said gravely, "but the north cannot be ignored. Maintaining the formation and providing dharma power requires our Qi Refining and Embyronic Breathing cultivators. You are right, Baijiang Creek is full of demonic cultivators. It's one thing for a few of you to provide support, but moving a large group is too conspicuous. I will send Guest Elder Cui with some of our people to the Tangdao Mountain Range, but they will go with the people from Purple Smoke. That way, they can look out for each other."

"This subordinate obeys!" As if Fei Qing'yi cared about any of that.

Fei Qing'yi had been relieved not to see Li Jiangqian, but Li Que'wan and Li Jianglong were proving frustratingly thorough. In the end, they agreed to send people to the north bank, but only two guest elders who were probably weaker than him in a real fight!

Still, he hadn't truly expected to lure out the Li family's core members. He raised no objection and began to count silently in his head. Just as the two guest elders stepped forward, a heaven-shaking explosion ripped through the air.

"BOOM!"

Everyone looked up. Several beams of black light shot up from the north, accompanied by mournful wails. Fei Qing'yi immediately became frantic, dropping to his knees before the pair. "The north bank! My Fei clansmen are still on the north bank! I beg you both, Milords, please save them!"

Before either of them could respond, a golden light flared over the lake. The 'Eternal Brightness Steps' shone brilliantly, blocking the surging black qi. Cui Jueyin had already made his move. Streams of light rose from all over the lake as other cultivators rushed to the scene.

Fei Qing'yi seemed beside himself, immediately riding the wind out of the hall, taking An Siwei and the other guest elder with him. Li Jianglong frowned, anger rising in his face. He turned, only to see Li Que'wan's expression was frozen.

The woman shook her head, just slightly. "Let's watch for a moment," she whispered.

Although Fei Qing'yi's words were earnest, and Li Que'wan had even used the Immortal Mirror to investigate, she had found no trace of any divine ability or dharma power on him. Nor had the mirror found anything amiss on the lake, save for a few furtive demonic cultivators lurking on the periphery. Yet, every time she listened to him, she felt a profound sense of unease.

In anyone else, such unease might be mere suspicion. But Li Que'wan cultivated the 'Houshenshu', giving her a natural instinct for avoiding death and prolonging life. While that instinct wasn't identical to this feeling of anxiety... she couldn't ignore the slightest possibility. This could very well be a fatal matter.

'Even if it's not some elaborate conspiracy, it's highly possible this group of demonic cultivators is extremely powerful. Rushing out would lead to casualties. In that case, we should also observe for a moment... We can't just charge in blind.'

Li Jianglong immediately agreed, his eyes narrowing in thought. He looked at his elder sister. "We can't trust his word alone. Let's wait for our brother. He's on the north bank; he knows the situation there best. If he makes an appearance, we can decide then."

After all, knowing Li Jiangqian's cautious nature, he would have already investigated the riverbank thoroughly. If new enemies had arrived, or if there was something wrong with these demonic cultivators, he would be the first to know.

A chaotic battle had already erupted in the sky above the north bank. Though many of the Li family's cultivators had gone to the mountains, plenty of Foundation Establishment Realm experts remained. Cui Jueyin took the lead, a bright light flashing from his hand. His spell arts ignited first, transforming into blazing streams of righteous fire that scattered through the air like glowing talismans.

"BOOM!"

The righteous fire, capable of expelling demons and cleansing evil, instantly blasted the black light apart. The White Ape leaped into the sky just as a torrent of black water surged upward from the other sideit was Chen Yang.

There were four demonic cultivators in the sky, all seemingly powerful. The moment they saw Cui Jueyin, their expressions turned serious. Two immediately moved to intercept him, while another, riding a cloud of black qi, descended toward the ground. He took a gourd from his robes, leaving the last cultivator to handle the man and the ape.

As he descended, he raised the gourd high and unleashed a hurricane. It swept over the ground like a giant hand from the heavens, instantly refining all living beings into blood essence and sucking them into the gourd. In a moment, the ground was soaked in blood, and screams echoed across the sky.

"You!" Fei Qing'yi looked genuinely frantic. He immediately drew his dharma artifact and rushed forward to stop him. "You dare?!"

His voice was raw, his eyes bloodshot, causing An Siwei and the others to sigh inwardly as they rushed to assist him. The demonic cultivator opposite him obviously knew what he was playing at and sneered. "Hehe! And who are you? ...Daoist Friend Zhao!"

At his call, another plume of black qi rose, solidifying into a young man in imposing black armor, holding a sword. His cultivation was clearly profound. With a flick of his blade, he forced all three of them back.

The demonic cultivator with the gourd held his dharma artifact high, laughing maniacally. "Jiangnan is so rich! Let's finish this quick! Plunder what we can and go!"

His gourd seemed to be a dharma artifact specializing in harvesting blood qi. While it didn't look particularly profound, it absorbed the essence at an astonishing speed. It pulsed with red light that swept through the town, tearing the roofs from houses. When the light fell on mortals, it sucked their very bones and marrow dry before flying back to the gourd.

A few Qi Refining cultivators rushed to the scene but dared not approach, only managing to hurl a few Dharma Arts from a distance to block the red light. The demonic cultivator became enraged, drew his own sword, and cursed, "These ants dare to block my path!"

Below, the screams shook the heavens. The black-armored youth was incredibly strong, holding his own against all three opponents. He only occasionally revealed a flaw, as if the grade of his sword technique was too low, preventing him from bringing his full power to bear.

Fei Qing'yi, of course, knew the man was only pretending, but the gourd below had already consumed many of his Fei clansmen. His eyes turned red with genuine, bitter sorrow.

'What can I do? I can barely protect my own life... Forget it. My closest relatives are all in the mountains. Let him do as he pleases!'

The moment this demonic cultivator surnamed Zhao appeared, Cui Jueyin's expression changed, a flicker of doubt in his eyes.

'Such profound cultivation... such powerful spell arts... Even if his dharma artifact and armor look ordinary, is he really one of the rogue cultivators?'

But the battle was already joined; he couldn't just call a halt. Pinned down by his opponent, he had no choice but to send a covert mental message to the others: 'These men don't seem like rogue cultivators... Be careful!'

Fei Qing'yi's expression was a mask of grief and fury. He sent a message back to the group: 'Milord already said the Purple Mansion experts wouldn't cross the river! So what if they aren't rogue cultivators? We must kill them and protect the people of the north bank!'



# Chapter 909: The Radiant Fiend

Black qi diffused as white light rippled.

Fei Qing'yi rode the wind, sword in hand, pausing among the clouds. The black-robed youth before him paid him little mind. His gaze merely brushed past, landing instead on Cui Jueyin. With a flick of his sword, he casually handled all three of his opponents as if they were a joke.

This was nothing new. From the lake to Tangdao Mountain, whether it was cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate or the Great Xiukui Monastery, they all looked down on him. Even rogue cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm received more respect. Despite being a guest elder of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, he was still treated like a plaything.

But today was different. The opponent’s sword strikes were all aimed at An Siwei, pressing the old man relentlessly. It seemed the youth was ignoring him, but in truth, he was secretly holding back.

But the gourd below was raised high. How long could the lake hold out?
As expected, with no one to control the demonic cultivator below, even those at the Qi Refining level had to brace themselves and advance. The first to block the red light were, naturally, his Fei family's Qi Refining cultivators. They were swept by a sleeve and instantly reduced to white bones.

The demonic cultivator laughed wildly and immediately turned. But just then, an old man rode the wind toward him, roaring, "How dare you act so atrociously!"

The demonic cultivator glanced over and saw a grey-robed old man at the Qi Refining realm, holding a sword. He instantly laughed and cursed, "And what qualifications do you have!"

At that moment, the crowd froze. In the sky, Chen Yang's expression changed drastically. "My lord, no!"

This man was none other than Chen Donghe!

Chen Yang, ignoring the demonic cultivator's weapons, swept out a wave of sword light, trying to intercept the fiend on the ground. Other cultivators immediately flew up from both sides. An Zheyan soared into the air to block him, but before the red light in the sky could even flash, a figure had already arrived, riding on flames.

This man wore a smile and held a golden hammer, treading on raging, apricot-colored flames. Who else could it be but Li Jiangqian?

The golden hammer, having built up power for some time, smashed down toward the demonic cultivator, wreathed in roaring flames. Before the dharma artifact even arrived, a wave of heat washed over him, making his expression change.
‘What potent Li Fire!’

He tried to draw a blade from his sleeve, but the man before him merely cleared his throat and spat a stream of apricot-yellow flame directly at his face.

The *Great Parting Scripture* was powerful in combat, and its flames were especially ferocious. The demonic cultivator had no choice but to form hand seals for his spell arts to resist the Li Fire. With a chaotic clang, black smoke exploded in the sky. The gourd, its black mist scorched by the Li Fire, tumbled from the air like a bird with a broken wing.

But his spell arts were cast in haste. He hadn't expected the flames to be so fierce. He barely managed to neutralize half of the attack; the rest splattered across his body, searing him until his face turned pale.

Li Jiangqian rarely took action, let alone now that he had broken through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. His appearance, wreathed in fire, brightened everyone's eyes, and the tense atmosphere eased. Fei Qing'yi even called out, "The Family Head is mighty!"

Li Jiangqian swung his golden hammer forward again, glancing back at him with a smile. Though it was a smile, his eyes were ice-cold, even holding a trace of mockery.

'Family Head... This must be a direct descendant of the Li family, no doubt!'

The demonic cultivator, though his face was twisted in pain from the burns, was inwardly ecstatic.

They exchanged several dozen blows. The two in the sky could no longer contain Cui Jueyin, and Li Jiangqian was fighting with increasing ferocity. Layers of apricot flame stacked onto the demonic cultivator, burning him until he howled in agony. A vicious thought formed in his mind.

'Good... very good... Even at this stage, they're only willing to send one out... Such caution!'

But before he could finish his internal curse, he saw the youth lightly shake his sleeve. A painted screen flew out, instantly sweeping away all the black qi in the air. Then, a golden blade shot out from within it, speeding toward his face.

He recoiled in sudden terror, slapping a talisman and circulating his immortal foundation. With a sharp clang, he blocked the golden blade. He was the weakest of the group, sent down as bait to harvest mortals; how could he withstand a suddenly appearing ancient dharma artifact? With all his black qi suppressed by the screen, he was powerless to defend himself as a massive hammer swung right at his face!

“Boom!”

A black cloud exploded in the sky. His entire chest caved in, burning with raging Li Fire. Terrified for his life, he instantly crushed a jade pendant in his sleeve.

Everyone on the field was stunned. Fei Qing'yi, however, could wait no longer. His expression was anxious, his heart cold.

'What are they still waiting for... It looks like the others definitely aren't coming out...'

But in that moment of distraction, he felt a sudden heat on the back of his neck. He whipped his head around in fright, only to find the golden-hammer-wielding young man had appeared behind him at some unknown time, watching him with a cold smirk.

Fei Qing'yi's heart plummeted, as if plunged into icy snow. He stammered, "Fam... Family Head..."

Li Jiangqian was unhurried. He barely moved. Those eyes that Fei Qing'yi never dared to meet stared at him, brimming with sarcasm. "Lord Fei, who exactly are you waiting for?"

That single, icy, sarcastic question plunged his heart into the deepest frost. As his mind went numb, names began to surface.

'That Daoist Master lied to me? Is Li Ximing back... or is there another Purple Mansion Realm expert on the lake?'

...

Baijiang Creek.

Helian Wumeng, clad in armor and holding a long-handled saber-glaive, watched the south like a spectator at a play. His armor glinted silver-white in the darkness. He seemed utterly at ease, clicking his tongue in appreciation from time to time.

Only when the apricot-colored Li Fire erupted did he chuckle and step forward. "The rigid ones are always so easy to deal with," he laughed. "Kill a few people, and they can't sit still!"

But he had only taken two steps before his eyes narrowed, and he stopped.

Ahead of him, the black qi receded from the clouds, revealing a man standing silently.

He was tall, dressed in golden armor that shimmered with platinum light, crafted from fine, dense scales. His expression was calm. Most peculiar were his eyes, which glowed with a complex, dark-gold color in the gloom.

Billowing white qi roared from beneath his feet, spreading out like a luminous white ocean. It rapidly transformed into various shapes—a chirping White Cicada here, a pouncing scaled beast there—dissolving all the black smoke and baleful qi in the sky.

Now that he had revealed himself, he simply stood there. The darkness in the sky rapidly dissipated, receding north like an ebbing tide. It shrank until it was a small patch of black sky behind Helian Wumeng, facing the brightness of the south.

The smile on Helian Wumeng's face slowly froze.

'Bright Yang... but not Li Ximing... The Li clan still has another trump card...'

His gaze turned cold, but he showed no anger, merely sneering, "I wonder which fellow Daoist I have the pleasure of meeting."

The golden-eyed, armored man looked up slightly. The clouds in the sky swirled, forming a scaled beast of white qi and mist. It descended, holding a long weapon in its mouth, circled him once, and delivered it into his hand.

It was a long halberd with a crescent-moon-shaped blade at its center. It was enveloped in a dense spiritual aura, emanating bright rays of light from within the roiling white qi. The rays seemed on the verge of solidifying, piercing the clouds, visible one moment and hidden the next.

He inverted the halberd, pointing it directly at Helian Wumeng. The cold edge gleamed. His voice was deep and resonant,

"Moongaze Lake. Minghuang."

Helian Wumeng was a direct descendant of the Tiefu Kingdom, a prodigy who had carved his way out of the mountains of corpses and seas of blood in the northern desert. He showed no hesitation. Instead, a feverish excitement lit his eyes. He glanced at Minghuang with a grin. "I've been fighting in the northern desert for so many years, but this is the first time I've met someone like you!"

He raised his saber-glaive. The plates of his armor flared with light, and the eighteen glazed beads at his waist lit up one by one. A fierce wind howled past, whipping up his black hair and revealing a necklace of white bone at his throat. He spoke in a cold voice, "Tiefu Kingdom. Helian Wumeng."

Before his voice had faded, the sky brightened. A halberd was already streaking through the air toward him, growing rapidly in his vision. It reflected a brilliant white light, the cold edge rushing to meet him, causing his pupils to contract.

“Clang!”

The multicolored light from the clash of divine abilities mixed with fiery sparks, sending vast ripples through the air. He held his saber-glaive in a direct block, intercepting the attack. The Grand Ascension Halberd, snow-white and marked with a scale-like pattern, stopped just an inch from his face.

“Good!”

A look of pleasant surprise flashed in Helian Wumeng's eyes. Billowing baleful qi surged up his body, empowering him with a dark, fiendish light. But in that brief instant, the dharma artifact blocked by his saber-glaive vanished. The attack changed from a sweep to a chop, descending from the sky with a torrent of white light!

“Boom!”

White mist exploded skyward. Helian Wumeng straightened his saber-glaive, planting it on the ground, and exhaled with a smile. Across from him, the scales on the golden-eyed youth's armor shimmered under the sun's light, his halberd angled toward the ground. Helian Wumeng's eyes narrowed, and his figure blurred, vanishing from the spot.

“Clang!”

The youth, however, was already holding his halberd in both hands, perfectly level. With a sharp clang, he blocked the descending saber-glaive—a weapon that was neither spear nor saber. The dark clouds in the sky were instantly scattered by the divine multicolored light that shot upward. A rapid series of ever-fiercer collisions followed. They fought for dozens of rounds. Helian Wumeng's entire body felt scorching hot, but he found it exhilarating. The demonic light from his saber-glaive gathered, growing more majestic, until it lunged like a great dragon bursting from the sea, trailing black light as it pierced forward.

Li Zhouwei immediately retracted his halberd, inverted its shaft, and sidestepped. The scales on his armor bristled under the pressure of the baleful light, emitting a piercing hum.

“Ding!”

The halberd jabbed. Its crescent-moon blade hooked the saber-glaive, tapping it lightly like a dragonfly touching water. His main body dodged, but the divine abilities collided. The force that traveled back to Helian Wumeng's hands was like a collapsing mountain, forcing him to laugh and release his grip on the deflected Spiritual Artifact.

A column of white mist shot into the sky as the Spiritual Artifact vanished. The northern barbarian's arrogant laughter echoed out. "Hahaha, good! Southerners only know the sword; they're unskilled with everything else. It's rare to meet an opponent who fights so openly, a true match for me! Let's fight!"

Billowing baleful qi erupted from his armor. Two vertical lines slowly appeared on the man's cheeks, splitting open to reveal two more eyes, both blood-red. In an instant, he transformed into a war general from the depths of hell. He reached into the void, grasped his returning saber-glaive, and lunged forward as a streak of fiendish light.

On the other side, Li Zhouwei rose on a golden light. His divine ability quickly re-covered the dharma artifact in his hand. He glanced at it. The small, crescent-moon blade on the weapon was humming as if it had been struck by lightning, clearly having sustained minor damage.

The [Grand Ascension] was, after all, only an ancient dharma artifact. Even if he protected it with his divine ability at every turn, how could it compare to the other's Spiritual Artifact?!

“Whoosh...”

A fierce wind battered his face. His opponent was already upon him, riding the wind, bringing with him a sea of baleful qi. Li Zhouwei's eyes narrowed. The space between his brows suddenly blazed, unleashing a pillar of light that pierced the baleful sea, causing the clouds to freeze and the black qi to scatter.
[Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light]!

Li Ximing had only begun to refine [Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light] after reaching the Divine Ability realm, but Li Zhouwei had already been cultivating it for over twenty years! At the same time, his Juque Palace erupted with light, and a speck of gold leaped forth.

A Purple Mansion Realm Supreme Yang spiritual object—[Concealed Plunder Gold]!

The dense golden light pierced the clouds. Helian Wumeng's face was cold, the fiendish light on his body so thick it seemed about to drip like water. He pointed his saber-glaive forward, meeting the radiance head-on!

“Boom!”

A torrent of white light surged into the heavens, illuminating the sky. The evening dusk was nearly transformed into the light of dawn. The saber-glaive froze for an instant in the golden light, shuddering left and right as if faltering. Just then, the halberd shot out from the Great Void.

“Clang!”

The crescent blade, radiating a dazzling white light, hooked solidly onto the polearm's shaft. The clash sent sparks flying with a piercing screech, exerting an immense force.

'Such nerve! He wants to steal my weapon!'

Helian Wumeng had ancestral knowledge and had heard of Li Ximing's divine abilities. How could he not know that the Bright Yang lineage's powers excelled at suppression? How could he let go? But before he could react, the golden-eyed man let go first, striking at his face with a divine ability-infused Heavenly Light.

His opponent had climbed out of a sea of blood, but Li Zhouwei had fought for countless years, standing guard at Secret Diffusion for a decade. How could he lack combat experience? His dharma artifact was inferior, so he would naturally trade his own weakness for his enemy's strength!

Helian Wumeng sneered internally. The two eyes on his cheeks rolled, transforming into two clusters of red light that enveloped his body, causing the incoming divine ability to sink as if into a swamp. He immediately tried to retract his saber-glaive.

'Trade for my strength? I won't even give your weapon back!'

A flicker of admiration passed through Helian Wumeng's eyes. Raging black flames suddenly erupted from Li Zhouwei. Four new, slender arms—two gold, two white—burst from his dharma body, each grasping an object!

The upper left held a pure white ivory fan, rolling with the fierce flames of [Profound Qi]. The lower left held a small flag painted with soaring birds, unleashing five types of boiling Li Fire. The upper right held a mountain of white jade, upon which immortal cranes danced. The lower right held a halberd of surging black flame, its power astonishing.

All four items shone with brilliant light, striking down at Helian Wumeng in unison!
[Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts]!

But that was not all. Behind the man in the platinum-scaled armor, a brilliant celestial gate rose through the clouds, ascending into the boundless heavens. Dragons and phoenixes circled it. Its two white pillars were already aimed, ready to suppress him at any moment!

Helian Wumeng's gaze, however, remained fixed on the surging black flames. The exhilaration from the intense battle froze. His pupils constricted.

'[Profound Qi]? Great Liang? The Touba family?!'

This hesitation lasted only an instant. Without a trace of doubt, he still refused to release the Spiritual Artifact in his grasp. He raised his saber-glaive slightly, blocking his chest with its pommel. A magnificent baleful qi erupted from his chest as if the gates of hell itself had been thrown open, spewing forth an endless torrent of demonic and fiendish qi.
'[Thousand-Hundred Body]!'

# Chapter 910: Scars

He activated his divine ability, his form instantly dissolving into a churning cloud of black maleficence. He twisted and danced within the roiling Baleful Qi and its dark light, rising to meet the cascade of brilliant attacks descending upon him.

Five types of Li Fire mingled with the abyssal flames erupting from the White Yin Fan. They scattered and drifted down, colliding with the roiling Baleful Qi. A violent flare of red and black light erupted. As the two fires separated, a great mountain of white jade, descending from the heavens, was revealed.

*Clang!*

Helian Wumeng gently raised the butt of his long-handled glaive to his chest, stopping the white jade mountain in its tracks. A moment later, a second hand shot out from the Baleful Qi, clamping down on a pitch-black halberd that had thrust coldly out from the flames.

*Boom!*

A shower of sparks exploded at the contact. His five fingers splayed wide, locking onto the halberd’s shaft with a death grip. Where hand met weapon, thick black smoke billowed amidst the sparks, accompanied by a grating, teeth-cringing screech.

Li Zhouwei's Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts was undeniably potent, but the weapon in his hand was, unfortunately, a mere dharma artifact—an ancient one, but a dharma artifact nonetheless. Against a Purple Mansion Realm master, it was hopelessly outmatched. His five Li Fire types mixed with the abyssal flame could at least singe his opponent's body. However, the famed "Jade Smoke Mountain," which the Yu family had once used to dominate the lake region, was so weak it could be deflected by the mere flick of the man's Spiritual Artifact. Without the enhancement from the divine ability, Li Zhouwei's attacks wouldn't even graze his foe's shadow.

Only the halberd formed of surging black flames, which had pierced the Baleful Qi, forced Helian Wumeng to catch it bare-handed. The acrid black smoke pouring from his seared palm proved it was the only Dharma Art capable of inflicting any real damage.

High above, the Audience with the Celestial Gate had arrived!

Helian Wumeng had been waiting for this. He had allowed his smoke-like form to absorb so many attacks precisely to free his hands for this very moment. He brought one hand before his chest, two fingers held vertically. Instantly, the eighteen azureglass beads at his waist vanished.

*Vmmm!*

The azureglass beads resonated, unleashing a blinding, boundless light of the Supreme Yin. They formed a massive white jade disk in the sky that firmly caught the descending Audience with the Celestial Gate divine ability. The collision of Supreme Yin and Bright Yang was like a boiling cauldron, erupting in violent waves of light.

These eighteen beads were the "Azureglass Stars of the Western General," one of Helian Wumeng's most treasured trump cards. He had held it in reserve exactly for this!

It wasn't that he feared this divine ability, but the location was all wrong. Had they been at sea or in the northern lands, he would have eagerly tested its might. But while the thrill of the fight excited him, he hadn't lost his mind. Deep in enemy territory, how could he allow himself to be suppressed by such a powerful ability?

But just as he deployed his treasure, the battlefield shifted. The four arms that had sprouted from his opponent's back were merely a distraction. The golden-eyed youth's true body had already retracted his hand, seizing his halberd, the 'Grand Ascension', as his eyes blazed with golden light. His other hand plunged straight into the cloud of Baleful Qi—and, impossibly, closed around Helian Wumeng's throat!

'What?'

Helian Wumeng cultivated the Baleful Qi Body Divine Ability. He could disperse and reform at will. Unless his opponent possessed a Life Divine Ability, it should be impossible to locate his true body within the Baleful Qi. He should have to be forced out with spell arts, not plucked from the miasma like this!

Yet here he was, grasped by the throat. No time for shock. He frantically poured his divine ability into his eyes, heedless of the cost. The light of the eighteen azureglass beads in the sky dimmed as his pupils flooded with crimson. Surging demonic qi erupted, threatening to blast his opponent away with a wave of demonic light.

The youth’s golden eyes burned. The Celestial Gate above vanished, and a new light flared from between his brows.

*RUMBLE!*

The blood-red demonic light and the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light clashed, becoming tangible pillars of energy. In that instant, crimson light flooded the sky, spreading from Helian Wumeng. Though the two beams were of similar size, his opponent's spell arts were more profound, and the dharma power he channeled was utterly reckless. The golden-eyed youth's attack was actually a fraction stronger!

But then, a faint golden thread emerged from within Li Zhouwei's Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light—the power of the Supreme Yang, supplied by the Concealed Plunder Gold!

This pure thread of Supreme Yang power flowed against the demonic tide. It seemed to extract something vital, causing the crimson beam to become an empty illusion, a castle in the air, and suddenly decay.

Simultaneously, the golden-eyed youth lunged forward. His face magnified in Helian Wumeng's vision. A thunderous *crack*! The instant the demonic light broke, a fist connected with the silver-black-armored man’s head, exploding in a dark cloud.

"Ngh...!"

Two streams of bloody tears instantly tracked down Helian Wumeng's cheeks. The Baleful Qi filling the sky seemed to pop and crackle. His form vanished in a red flash, the crimson aura in the sky disappearing with him. He reappeared dozens of yards away, trailing black smoke as he came to a halt.

Li Zhouwei casually flicked his hand. The demonic blood on his knuckles instantly vaporized into a storm of Baleful Qi that drifted away. Clearly, Helian Wumeng's escape technique had come at a price.

The northern barbarian's eyes were clenched shut, his face a mask of agony as bloody tears streamed from the corners. He raised a hand, formed two fingers like a blade, and jabbed them viciously into the flesh just beneath his own eyes.

Two round holes appeared on Helian Wumeng's cheeks. The flesh rippled, and from beneath his still-closed eyelids, two new, blood-red eyes emerged. A dazzling crimson light burst from them once more, freezing the white beam that was streaking toward him!

The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light drew most of its power from the Supreme Yang energy released by the Concealed Plunder Gold, but that energy was not infinite. Having just invaded its target's eyes, the white light weakened. The red light overpowered it, and the menacing demonic beam struck the golden-eyed youth’s forehead.

*BOOM!*

Helian Wumeng showed no sign of relief. His expression remained utterly calm as he simultaneously flicked his glaive upward, parrying a halberd that had struck like a cold, venomous snake. *Clang!*

Even in his haste, his block was firm. But his opponent hadn't even tried to defend against the demonic light. Instead, he twisted the halberd. Its smaller, crescent blade, glowing with multicolored light, danced across Helian Wumeng's face. It sliced open a terrifying wound that nearly sheared off the side of his cheek, momentarily revealing the white gleam of teeth.

Helian Wumeng’s expression remained glacial.

Thousand-Hundred Body!

His Body Divine Ability flared. The gruesome wound, which had just split his face open, shrank rapidly, knitting back together. It didn't even bother to purge the destructive Bright Yang power or the black flame lingering in the cut. Instead, with supreme skill, it constrained and condensed them into a single, fine, golden-white scar.

He still hadn't had time to deal with the Supreme Yang light in his eyes. With a quick dodge, he dissolved back into Baleful Qi, reforming a short distance away, looking slightly disheveled.

It was all to evade the Audience with the Celestial Gate, which had reappeared and locked onto his position.

On the other side, Li Zhouwei staggered. The demonic light on his forehead exploded, momentarily revealing a sinister speck of bone flashing with multicolored light. But a gush of golden-white blood instantly neutralized the demonic qi. New flesh knitted over the wound, and in a heartbeat, his skin was smooth and unbroken.

The demonic light had bought Helian Wumeng another precious moment. The "Azureglass Stars of the Western General" flared to life, seizing the opportunity to bear down on the young man.

How could Li Zhouwei not see the danger? The Great Void trembled and the Bright Yang surged. The Audience with theCelestial Gate abandoned its target, rising from below to meet the azureglass beads. A massive plume of white smoke billowed from their collision.

*Hisss...*

Now separated by a great distance, both men finally paused.

*Vmmm...*

Li Zhouwei leveled his halberd. The 'Grand Ascension' hummed, letting out a mournful keen. Even sheathed in surging black flames to prevent direct contact with the enemy's Spiritual Artifact, the dharma artifact was clearly reaching its limit.

Helian Wumeng's bloody tears had yet to stop. He coughed, and two jets of golden light shot from his clenched eyelids. He finally opened them, revealing only empty, scorched-black sockets. But then, the two gruesome eyes on his cheeks crawled upward, sliding into the empty orbits. His handsome features were restored, and from a distance, he looked completely unharmed.

The thrilling, high-paced battle paused. Both men appeared strangely unaffected, save for the faint, fine scar on Helian Wumeng’s face, from which the golden-white light was rapidly fading.

The very sky seemed to have been split by them into north and south. On one side, Baleful Qi rolled in boundless darkness; on the other, bright light gleamed and colorful clouds drifted. For a moment, neither spoke.

The fight hadn't ended. A hazy golden light was sweeping in from the northwest. One by one, massive golden figures materialized behind Helian Wumeng. Their gazes were a mixture of greed and apprehension. They stood with hands clasped and heads bowed, utterly silent.

Four of the Merciful Ones had arrived.

Li Zhouwei stood with his back to the great river, his brilliant Heavenly Light holding its ground against the demonic Buddhists. Neither side made a move.

Then, one Merciful One laughed loudly. He glanced at Li Zhouwei, clasped his hands, and said in a low voice, "The north is victorious, but the vanguard has not yet been broken. This place is not safe. We were ordered to rendezvous with you, Daoist Friend, and escort you back to Xiaoshi Mountain..."

Helian Wumeng didn't even turn his head. His face was full of surprise, and he still looked eager for more. He stared at Li Zhouwei until a deep, resonant voice echoed from the sky:

"A fine dharma body."

It was Li Zhouwei who had spoken. Helian Wumeng continued to stare at him in surprise. He pointed his glaive downward, planting it in the clouds, and raised a finger to his face. He gently brushed the fine, golden-white scar. The color transferred entirely to his fingertip, which he held up to examine closely.

"Good!"

A look of genuine delight surfaced in his eyes.

"This one battle with Minghuang is worth more than three years of my bitter cultivation!"

Even as enemies, the northern barbarian's grand bearing was undiminished. Though the color had faded from the wound and the divine ability within it was neutralized, the mark itself remained, adding a touch of savagery to his features.

"I will remember this halberd strike."

The two factions faced each other across the sky, their spiritual senses locked, monitoring every movement. After a few breaths, two figures flew in frantically from the south.

They were, of course, the demonic cultivators who had crossed the river. The exchange between Li Zhouwei and Helian Wumeng had been blindingly fast. Their group had fled in terror, and only these two had made it. The youth in black robes was flickering with dark light, clearly protected by a Purple Mansion Realm talisman that both defended and intimidated. Without it, their escape would not have been so easy.

The other survivor was covered in burning Li Fire and bright light. His entire lower body was gone, and his remaining torso was smoldering, trailing black smoke. It was clear that in just that short time, of all the cultivators who had crossed the river, only these two remained.

Over the river, Li Zhouwei gave them a cool glance. Helian Wumeng merely tightened his grip on his glaive, a knowing smile in his eyes.

Since the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had been defeated, they were likely in full retreat. Their foundation was deep, so no one would press them to annihilation. But Helian Wumeng's group was too deep in enemy territory, and the northern powers were not unified. They feared being encircled, which is why they had to withdraw. And they had to take these survivors with them.

If fighting resumed, Helian Wumeng was more than capable of tying down Li Zhouwei. It was hard to say what the other Merciful Ones might do in the meantime.

But Li Zhouwei merely swept his gaze over them, tightened his grip on his halberd, and said coldly, "You can go. But leave what's in your stomachs."

At his words, the four Merciful Ones looked ready for action. But Helian Wumeng had no intention of lingering. He laughed, looking like he was thoroughly enjoying the spectacle. "Spit it out!"

The face of the demonic cultivator beside the black-robed youth fell. With a sickening retch, he vomited a mass of flesh onto the ground. It was immediately bound by the Heavenly Light and lifted into the air, forming a sphere. Only then did the two survivors fly, trembling, across the river.

They scrambled to hide beneath Helian Wumeng's cloud. They shot a panicked glance at Li Zhouwei before looking back at their own Daoist Master. Their eyes seemed to be burned by the sight of the new scar, and they quickly lowered their heads, daring not to look again.

A Purple Mansion Realm dharma body should not be able to hold a scar. He had clearly seared the wound into his memory, deliberately preserving it. As the demonic cultivators fled back, he grabbed the two survivors, and his Baleful Qi form dissolved into black smoke, leaving only his voice to echo in the dark:

"Too many spell arts today. How dull! I look forward to... a rematch, Daoist Friend, once you've found a more suitable weapon!"

After such a battle, Helian Wumeng could naturally tell that Li Zhouwei had been holding back. If his weapon hadn't been so inferior, he wouldn't have been forced to close the distance and resort to different Dharma Arts. And without that thread of Supreme Yang in the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, the exchange would not have ended so quickly.

The Heavenly Light shone brightly as the darkness receded. The Buddhist cultivators retreated with their leader. Li Zhouwei stood upon his cloud, quietly watching them go.

'Helian Wumeng... Tiefu Kingdom...'

He lowered his dharma artifact, looking with a pained expression at the 'Grand Ascension'. The crescent-moon blade was already slightly bent and warped, shedding faint golden motes of light.

'Materials for an ancient dharma artifact are so hard to find. At least it didn't break completely.'

He tore his eyes from his dharma artifact and glanced with a complex expression at the white vapor on the horizon. Finally, his gaze fell upon the ball of flesh the demonic cultivator had expelled.

"Get out," he said coldly.

A head emerged from the gory mass, attached only to a torso. He had no limbs. His features were handsome, but his face was smeared with blood and deathly pale. His breathing was a faint thread, his lips trembled, and he looked to be on death's door. It was Fei Qing'yi!

During the battle on the lake, with their reinforcements gone, the demonic cultivators had decided to retreat. They used a Purple Mansion Realm talisman to cover their escape, then tricked Fei Qing'yi, telling him not to resist. One of them had then swallowed him whole, clearly intending to carry him across the river. Whether to be used as a cultivation supplement or for some other purpose, he was to be handed over to Helian Wumeng for disposal.

Having been inside the cultivator's stomach, most of his dharma power and vital blood had been drained away. Now that he was spat out, Fei Qing'yi's ravaged body was sustained only by the stubborn vitality of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He looked as if he might dissolve at any second. His pupils were wide and unfocused. He shivered, staring at Li Zhouwei as his head slumped forward.

His consciousness was fading, but he knew exactly who Li Zhouwei was. He had even seen this man from a distance before.

'It's only been a few years...'

Li Zhouwei smiled down at him. He blew lightly. A white wind swept up, pulling arms and legs from the gory mass and planting them back onto Fei Qing'yi's torso like sprouts. A surge of Bright Yang power made his limbs whole once more.

Color returned to Fei Qing'yi's face. But before he could even orient himself in the air, the gleaming white halberd was already high, reflecting the sky's clouds and golden light. It whistled through the air and punched straight through his chest.

*Squelch!*

The halberd lifted him high. Fei Qing'yi hung from it like a dead fish, staring at the sky. In his upside-down view of the world, all he could see was that pair of cold, dark-golden eyes. The world spun. The pain was agonizing. A single, icy thought remained in his mind:

'It would have been cleaner to just die!'



# Chapter 911: Meeting Again

The sky was dim. Figures hurried across Cold Cloud Peak. Cultivators in white armor carried weapons, led by a black-robed youth. His expression was dark, seemingly furious, yet the hand resting on his sword hilt was almost light, tapping gently.

'I've finally waited for this day...'

The Fei Clan had been on the Northern Shore for so many years, always in a state of semi-independence. Chen Yang had advised the peak more than once, with only one goal: to abolish every last bit of the Fei Clan's autonomy.

'My Chen Clan has served with merit for five generations! We haven't even secured a position as landlords, our descendants toiling in service. What are you, Fei Clan? A bunch of pathetic cowards who surrendered midway, and you think you're worthy of holding land and raising people?'

As for Fei Qing'yi's desperate gamble, Chen Yang felt no animosity. On the contrary, his previous impression of him as a meek and honest person changed. He found himself admiring him a little, shaking his head in secret:

'Even a cornered rabbit will bite. His timing was just unlucky. Otherwise, he might have actually succeeded. A pity, a real pity. In the end, he was devoured by demonic cultivators. If it had been me... I wouldn't have been so clumsy as to charge in like this...'

The Fei family had always been cautious, enduring until now. Li Ximing and the Great Xiukui Monastery had already agreed to relocate the Fei clansmen. Both sides had even begun the handover. Once they reached the Great Xiukui Monastery, where governance was laxer and they had backing from above, their lives as landed gentry would naturally be much better.

But the Fei family had fallen on the eve of this new dawn.

Right now, the mountainside was filled with the sound of weeping and endless wailing. To Chen Yang, it was like celestial music. His hand caressed the hilt of his sword. He watched the woman being dragged before him like a dead dog, and a few chuckles escaped his throat.

"You're in for a world of pain now."

The Fei family members on the ground cried out about the injustice, but no one paid them any mind. Cold Cloud Peak had always been famous for its snowy vistas. The white snow glimmered with a dim, yellow light in the dusk. Chen Yang turned and strode away without a shred of pity. Outside the courtyard, the two pots of plum blossoms were still swaying in the wind and snow.

A crimson-robed youth stood in the snow, a woman in a feathered cloak at his side. The youth's gaze was fixed on the plum blossoms. Chen Yang bowed deeply and said respectfully:

"Young Master! All members of the Fei family have been detained and are awaiting your judgment!"

He finished his report, but when Li Jiangqian didn't respond, he added obsequiously:

"These plum blossoms are growing well. Should we move them to the island..."

"No need. They still have some vitality growing here. If we move them, they certainly won't survive."

Li Jiangqian retracted his gaze and said softly, "This courtyard was once an ancestor's residence. Preserve every single part of it... I won't permit even the slightest damage. As for the Fei family members..."

He trailed off. Chen Yang paused, confused, and raised an eyebrow. He then realized the entire courtyard was brightening. The once-dim snow was now illuminated by a brilliant Radiance, shining brightly as it melted into thin slush.

"Drip!"

Only then did he notice a drop of red land in front of him. It looked like dark red blood.

The blood had just hit the ground when it instantly vaporized into a cloud of cold mist. Everyone nearby looked up at the sky in unison, only to be met by blinding waves of light.

The gloomy clouds in the sky scattered, replaced by a convergence of colorful clouds. A figure stood above the lake. The setting sun dipped toward the horizon, draping him in a brilliant crimson light that made it impossible to look at him directly. All that could be seen was a silhouette, rendered dark by the intense light surrounding it.

A familiar, long-handled halberd was held horizontally in the air. A man in white robes was draped conspicuously over it like a corpse. A stream of red blood trickled down his white clothes, turning into snowflakes as it fell.

"Father!"

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

In an instant, everyone in the courtyard dropped to their knees. Chen Yang's mind felt as if it had been struck by lightning. His thoughts went completely blank, leaving only a single idea:

'It's not Daoist Master Zhaojing? He... he succeeded! The Li Clan has a second Purple Mansion Realm expert?!'

The thought was fleeting. In the next instant, he understood who the man in white was:

'Fei Qing'yi! He's been captured and brought back!'

"Thud..."

The halberd was inverted. The white-robed man tumbled from the sky, landing on the ground with a heavy thud. He let out a groan, dragged his body over, and began to kowtow. Not a single person in the courtyard dared to make a sound, leaving only the dull *thud, thud, thud* of his forehead hitting the ground.

Li Jiangqian was not surprised at all; he had clearly already met with Li Zhouwei. He flicked his sleeves, turned in a new direction, and bowed deeply.

"Congratulations, my-lord, on achieving your Divine Ability!"

At once, the crowd bowed again in congratulations. But the Daoist Master in the sky was already gone, leaving only a faint command:

"Handle this, then come and see me on the island."

The brilliant light receded, and the world returned to the dim, dark-red hues of the setting sun. Before the crowd could even recover from their stunned silence, Chen Yang lunged forward, shouting:

"Fei Qing'yi fell to the demonic path! The Fei family colluded with the Northern Buddhists, intending to bring a wolf into our house and endanger Jiangnan! Their crimes are monstrous! The Daoist Master is wise and powerful, turning the tide against this disaster! But Fei Qing'yi still caused countless deaths and injuries on the Northern Shore! We demand he be paraded through the streets for three days, then executed by a thousand cuts and his head put on display..."

Li Jiangqian waited until he had finished his loud proclamation, ensuring every cultivator and Fei family member on the ground had heard clearly. A clamor immediately rose from all around. Only then did Li Jiangqian wave his hand and say:

"That's letting him off too lightly. First, gather our men and watch everyone closely."

The crowd reported and retreated, huddling together and whispering amongst themselves. Li Jiangqian frowned and said in a low voice:

"The Fei family caused disastrous casualties among the common people of the Northern Shore. We can't be lenient. But Fei Qingya is still at the Great Xiukui Monastery. What are your thoughts on how to handle her?"

Li Que'wan understood his meaning. The joy in her eyes slowly faded, replaced by a glint of coldness. She replied in a low voice:

"I don't see it being difficult. Fei Qingya holds little affection for the Fei Clan. We just need to write her a letter. She's like a character from a storybook; her sense of right and wrong is more self-righteous than anyone's. The Great Xiukui Monastery will be happy to see this outcome... This is a critical time. We cannot be lenient. Exterminating the entire clan might be too much, but for Fei Qing'yi's branch, even annihilating three generations of his family wouldn't be enough to atone for his crimes. Aside from Fei Qingyi, who is beyond our reach... I see no need to leave any others alive."

Li Jiangqian nodded, though he seemed somewhat unsatisfied. The Fei family was large. Although many mortals with the Fei surname had died in the recent battle, uprooting them completely would still result in tens of thousands of deaths. He mused, "Fei Qing'yi still holds a position at Tangdao Mountain, nominally under the command of the Great Xiukui Monastery. In my opinion, it would be best to round up his three generations and let the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition handle them. As for the rest... we'll deal with them based on the situation."

Fei Qingyi, after all, is part of the Si Clan now. She had gone over to the enemy and was in no position to interfere. Even if this woman couldn't bear it, she had no right to speak. It's not that she didn't warn the Fei family, but with things as they are, what could be done?

The two of them settled the matter, gave their orders, and quickly departed. The sounds of mournful crying faded into the distance. At last, Cold Cloud Peak was empty, leaving only the white snow drifting in the night, falling silently on the sealed roof of the nearby hall.

The high pavilion stood peacefully in the wind. The white paint on its doors was slightly faded. The sound of falling snow was a soft whisper. The two wintersweet trees bloomed quietly in the snow, as if nothing had ever changed.

...

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Li Zhouwei descended on a beam of light. The climate here was utterly different from the icy desolation of Cold Cloud Peak. Radiance blazed, gardenias bloomed in abundance, and a wave of heat rolled through the air.

The man in the white-gold Daoist robe was pacing anxiously by a table. When he saw Li Zhouwei enter, his eyes smiled, and he looked relieved, though anxiety still lingered. Li Zhouwei cupped his hands in greeting.

"This junior greets you, my-lord!"

Li Ximing picked up the pot from the table, his expression, weary from his injuries, softening. Although he had managed to retrieve his ruined body from Helian Wujiang in time, the baleful aura was still wreaking havoc within his dharma body. The injuries left from fighting a Daoist Master with Three Divine Abilities were clearly not light.

'This trip to Tangdao Mountain, I have to get some medicine from them... I really staked my life this time.'

Returning from the north had given him a considerable fright. He had sensed Helian Wumeng stopped at Baijiang Creek from a great distance. If Helian Wumeng had decided to head south and slaughter, it would have been truly risky for Li Ximing to intervene. But when Li Zhouwei appeared, he breathed a sigh of relief. He had been observing silently from the Great Void and had returned a step earlier.

Now, he asked:

"When did you get back?"

Li Zhouwei relaxed his hand, and Grand Ascension vanished. He bowed deeply, walked to the table, and accepted the tea Li Ximing had poured, saying respectfully, "In truth, I had ample time. It's just that the phenomenon was concealed by the Dragon-kin, and the stone talisman I left for you, my-lord, was rendered ineffective, so no one knew. After breaking through, I made a trip to the Dragon Palace. By the time I returned, several days had passed. I saw Xiaoshi Mountain collapse and the situation escalating, endangering the lakeshore, so I stationed myself on the Northern Shore. I hope you, my-lord, can forgive me for not rushing to Caishan's aid..."

"That's hardly a transgression."

Li Ximing laughed and set down the jade pot in his hand. His expression turned serious. "I knew you would succeed! I just never imagined it would be this fast. It seems that having fate on your side truly brings benefits that ordinary people can only envy."

On any other day, Li Ximing would have been overjoyed, wanting nothing more than to host a grand banquet and celebrate for three days. But the situation was too uncertain, and his injuries were not light. This cast a shadow over his joy. After just a moment, the cloud of worry returned to his heart. He sighed, his happy expression fading, and said in a low voice, "I can't clean up this mess. I can only go with the flow. We've already grown too close to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. It seems this conflict between north and south is completely different from those in the past. Kui Qi has treated me well; there's no easy way to back out now."

"I rushed back this time to save someone and happened to meet with you. I was originally heading to Tangdao Mountain..."

Li Zhouwei shook his head and was about to say more, but Li Ximing continued, "You don't need to come with me. Right now, everyone is on edge. You can play the 'bad cop' and just guard our home. If we both appear too friendly, there will be some obligations we can't refuse."

Li Zhouwei naturally understood this point. His expression was just a bit complicated as he replied, "My trip to the Dragon Palace took up this exact window of time. Their words were full of hints. The long and short of it is, they don't want me getting involved in the great battle at Luoxia. It seems all parties have already reached a consensus on the outcome of this war."

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat when he heard this. "What else did the Dragon-kin say?"

Li Zhouwei first shook his head silently, then answered, "Dingjiao is in seclusion. He only left something for me in the underwater Dragon Palace, instructing me to take it without fail... I was met by another White Dragon. We only spoke a few words."

He raised his hand and took a jade box from his sleeve. As soon as the lid opened, an item was revealed: two small, glittering rings.

"Spiritual Treasure! The Pure Yang Bracelets!"

Li Zhouwei had dared to confront Helian Wumeng and four of the Merciful Ones on the river; naturally, he had an ace up his sleeve. Li Ximing had used the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass before, so how could he not know how powerful these treasures were? His eyes lit up, and he said in pleasant surprise,

"A Spiritual Treasure? As a gift?"

Li Zhouwei looked slightly awkward. "Yes... I couldn't refuse. I was worried it was because of trouble back home that they specifically gave me the Pure Yang Bracelets. So I brought them back."

These two Spiritual Treasures didn't look remarkable. At first glance, they were just a pair of gold rings, perfectly sized for wearing. But looking closer, one could see them faintly shimmering with a white-gold luster that faded in and out of view.

Li Ximing examined them closely, but in the end, he closed the box and pushed it back into Li Zhouwei's hands. He instructed, "With these in your possession, you'll have more protection. I'll also feel more at ease leaving you to guard the lake. I still need to make that trip."

As he spoke, he took out a jade slip and a token from his sleeve, saying in a low voice, "In the years you've been in seclusion, the clan's great formations have been repaired. This token will grant you access to both the inner and outer formations."

"This jade slip contains my experiences from practicing 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' these past few years. Take it and read it. Destroy it after you're done..."

He rummaged through his storage pouch and immediately dumped out a pile of itemsmedicinal pills, cultivation techniques, Spiritual Qi, dharma artifactspushing them all into Li Zhouwei's hands. It felt incredibly ominous, making Li Zhouwei's eyelids twitch.

After leaving the items, he summoned a beam of light and flew into the Great Void, disappearing from sight. Li Zhouwei was left holding the items. He stared at the jade box on the table and quietly sipped his tea, his expression gradually darkening.

'We're all just pawns... Who isn't a pawn? Of those who refuse to be pawns, who refuse to bow and scrape like dogs, how many haven't been carved up, bled dry, and had their very marrow sucked out? Even the Purple Mansion Realm is full of constraints! The only way out is to harden your heart, abandon everything, and flee overseas. Then you might preserve a few hundred years of freedom... In this world, as long as you have the slightest ambition to climb, you can never escape being someone's dog!'

'As for me... I probably don't even have the right to leave their sight!'

A sarcastic smile touched his lips. He lowered his head, picked up the jade slip, and extended his spiritual sense into it. He read it carefully. As expected, it was mostly a treatise on the Bright Yang Dao. But as he read to the very end, he found an incantation.

Li Zhouwei only gave it a single glance, but his heart shook. With a calm and indifferent expression, he crushed the jade slip in his hand. His eyes flashed with a bright light. He looked up and said coldly,

"Who's there?!"

The Great Void rumbled, and two figures drilled their way out onto Gardenia Scenery Mountain!

One of them was short, with horns on his forehead, an ugly face, and eyes on the sides of his head. He clutched a brush as long as a pestle. The moment he emerged, he bowed.

"Emissary from the Underworld Bureau of the Netherworld... Wang Long, greets you, fellow Daoist! Congratulations on achieving your Divine Ability! From this day on, your fate is your own, and you are beyond the cycle of life and death!"

The other person, holding a large book, had also been here before. It was Zhang Gui!

Both of them were beaming with joy, their gazes fervent as they looked at him. Li Zhouwei had heard Li Ximing mention these two before. He inwardly shook his head.

'This time, they don't dare wish me success in avoiding the great calamity, attaining Fruition Attainment, and reaching Truehood...'

Wang Long, however, didn't know what he was thinking and said with a smile, "Apologies for intruding, fellow Daoist... We've been to this place before... We just didn't expect to be back so soon! Fellow Daoist truly has the talent of a celestial... Throughout history, not many have been able to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm in under ten years. Now, we've finally seen it! The last time we... the last time..."

The time it takes to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm always involves a bit of luck. Wang Long was just saying it to be auspicious. The nearby Zhang Gui slowly picked up where he left off, "The last one was Jiang Boqing, another figure of extremely high cultivation."

"Yes, yes!"

Zhang Gui studied his expression and said gleefully, "Even the great one praised this person, saying his 'talent exceeds the rules, his fate is worthy of Mount Shi.' He was especially appreciated. If he hadn't made a move, how could that fellow Jiang have had any room to maneuver? He would have long since been..."

It was as if he had no filter on his mouth. He stopped abruptly, then smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist is surely a renowned figure, one destined to master the Five Dharmas!"

Li Zhouwei heard the hidden meaning. His eyes gleamed, and his hand, resting on the jade cup, rubbed it slightly. He secretly filed the information away and said with a smile, "After I broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, I rushed home in a hurry and completely forgot that you two fellow Daoists would be coming to register my name... I've made you wait for so long. My apologies!"

# Chapter 912: Illuminating Sun and Moon

"Not at all! Not at all!"

The two men glanced at each other and quickly bowed. Wang Long was the first to speak.

"Fellow Daoist, what words are these? When you were born... the clouds swirled, vast as a carriage canopy, the ground was covered in White Cicadas, and a qilin carried a child. We all received our orders."

"Judge Yang dispatched us to the corresponding location in the Underworld. One of us blew the conch, the other fanned the winds. Then we ascended from the World's Navel and struck the Morning Mist Bell for three quarters. It was all done according to ancient customs to congratulate you. We have long anticipated this day; a little waiting is nothing."

Li Zhouwei naturally knew his birth had never been a secret. Perhaps some Purple Mansion Realm cultivator on a distant coast or deep in the north was unaware, but the players at the zenith were playing chess, their hands enclosing the four seas. How could they not see the board? They knew everything, clear as day. He took the opportunity to ask:

"You have truly gone to too much trouble. The world is so vast; in this age, countless people are born with such auspicious signs. You praise me too highly."

"You are mistaken," Wang Long replied, shaking his head.

"Fellow Daoist, yours is not just any destiny. Your status is exalted, a descendant of a Golden Core. To have such a noble origin to match this destiny makes it even more so. There are other talents in this world who also possess destiny. But once they break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, their Life Divine Ability is cultivated to its end. What they were born with, others have also managed to cultivate. Even if it retains some uniqueness, it's hard to say it's truly superior to other Divine Abilities."

"From what I've heard of the world's affairs, setting aside reincarnated beings and those with innate talent for the Way of the Sword, and speaking only of destiny and bloodline... apart from that one from the Touba family, anyone else who could compare to Your Excellency has only just been born."

"Moreover..."

He hesitated slightly, as if debating whether to continue. After a second look, he finally said:

"I see you understand your own status. You can, under the gaze of all, determine the fate of those with great destinies and powerful Divine Abilities. Who, then, could say *your* destiny is not great? Is that not, in itself, a Divine Ability? Naturally, it will give rise to all sorts of wonders. And now, such a domineering Fruition Attainment as Bright Yang no longer favors just one person. An exception like you, Fellow Daoist... isn't that worthy of being called a destiny of the highest order?"

Li Zhouwei's affairs were a game played in the heavens. Whatever the Dragon-kin knew, the Underworld knew just as much. The two envoys before him maintained a respectful attitude. Zhang Gui spoke up in his gruff voice:

"Fellow Daoist, your destiny is aligned with Bright Yang, and your blood flows from the Wei Emperor. In ancient times, you would have been called nothing less than a Dao Body."

He was not a man of many words and fell silent. His partner immediately picked up the thread.

"In the old Wei kingdom, the Dao Bodies all had different, very long names. That Martial Emperor was called the [Divine Light Emperor Body, Hailed by the Ten Directions]... Ha ha... Well, he was the emperor of a celestial dynasty, after all. They always cared for such things."

Li Zhouwei fell into thought. The two Underworld envoys seemed pressed for time. Wang Long nodded, immediately getting to the point and clasping his hands.

"Although we are long familiar with your great name, the formalities must be observed..."

He straightened his posture, his voice taking on a formal, imposing tone.
"What is your name?"

Li Zhouwei inclined his head.

"Li Zhouwei, disciple of the Li clan. The 'Zhou' for 'revolution,' the 'Wei' for 'eminence.'"

As his voice fell, ink materialized on the large brush in Wang Long's hand. Beside him, Zhang Gui asked, "Are you still going to look?"

The man's pinkish lips pursed as he began flipping through the thick tome in his hands. But Wang Long hurried him.

"What is there to look for? Just write it down!"

Clearly, it wasn't just Li Ximing; Li Zhouwei's name was also unlikely to be found in their records. Wang Long had served in the Underworld's mortal affairs for so many years; how could he not understand this? He scoffed internally.

'It's no wonder he's been an envoy longer than me. How can someone so unobservant ever hope to be promoted? Li Ximing's name was already missing—who knows whose handiwork that was. Li Zhouwei is obviously even more important, a pivotal piece in this grand upheaval of the world. It would be stranger if his name *was* in there!'

The two bustled for a moment and finished writing. Seeing this, Li Zhouwei reached into the storage bag at his waist, produced a jade box, and offered it. But Wang Long just laughed.

"We couldn't possibly! We couldn't!"

He would accept ordinary gifts, but not from this man. He pushed the jade box back, his smile still tinged with awkwardness.

"We have no need for your things, Fellow Daoist! If not for the rules, *we* should be the ones giving *you* gifts. We cannot speak on the affairs of the great figures... but in the future, when you have the chance to strike for the Golden Core realm, if it doesn't interfere with important matters... perhaps you could choose your territory... and we would be honored if you considered leaning toward our humble jurisdiction..."

'So that's it,' Li Zhouwei understood. 'They're after the Metallic Essence.'

He gave a slight nod. Wang Long waved his hands again, earnestly deflecting any sense of demand.

"You mustn't delay the business of those above! If it's inconvenient, it's no matter. We will surely have many chances to meet in the future. But... just to be allowed to witness your Divine Ability, to see Your Excellency's great achievement... that would be the best!"

At the mention of this, even the slow-witted Zhang Gui showed an eager, fawning smile. He set his large book down and said respectfully:

"This matter is highly negotiable... We just fear we are being too forward."

"We have some business to attend to in the north, so we won't impose any longer."

The two exchanged a few more pleasantries, then dissolved into two gusts of yin wind and vanished.

'It seems the Underworld's methods... are just as formidable.'

'Yang Tianya achieved his Divine Ability even before Houfu. To this day, no one knows his cultivation level. He remains hidden in the shadows... The north and south are torn apart by war, yet the entire Yang family appears completely harmless. He hasn't made a single move.'

Compared to that northern power's faint, domineering presence and their top-down, shadowy control over the entire world's situation, the Underworld's methods were more subtle, seeping in like water. If the Li family hadn't been informed about Yang Tianya early on, they would still believe the Yangs were just a group of washed-up royals trapped on their mountain.

'But thinking about it, the key link between the Yang and Li families is the marriage with Li Xizhi. Could this be seen as the Yangs placing a bet on the Li family long ago? What about other places? What other arrangements has Yang Tianya made?'

'And as a mixed-blood of the Yang and Li families... what role is Zhouluo's branch playing... under the governance of Azure Pond...'

Li Zhouwei waited a while longer, then shook his head, pushing the thoughts from his mind. Confirming the two were truly gone, his form instantly dissolved into light. There was no time to pay visits. He stepped across the Great Void and descended toward the lake.

He flew into the grand formation, weaving between the towering profound pillars, and landed in the main hall of the inner array. There, he saw a pagoda standing alone in the dimly lit hall.

It was the *Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda*.

He took a single step and appeared at the pagoda's apex. He sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and recited the incantation inwardly:

'Li Zhouwei, disciple of the Li clan, ascending to walk the path of Divine Ability, perfecting all virtue... I pray to ascend to the heavenly mandate, to be inscribed upon the Profound Register... to open the Profound Brightness, and continue my Daoist works!'

*Dong!*

A slight sensation of weightlessness washed over him. He felt the white pellet in his Shengyang Mansion tremble as his form seemed to shrink infinitely. A world of ethereal mist and clouds suddenly appeared before him, and an intense coolness spread from the back of his head.

His vision brightened. He was in a pavilion.

Gray stone and white jade, bathed in clear, bright lamplight. Li Zhouwei raised his head slightly. Reflected in his pupils was the scene outside the window: the sun and moon sharing the sky. A wave of rich Spiritual Qi rushed to meet him, shaking him to the core.

'What dense spiritual inspiration... What a perfectly balanced spiritual atmosphere!'

'This is... the World Within the Mirror!'

Only now did Li Ximing's meaningful expression from before make sense. Joy surged in his heart, followed by dawning comprehension.

"No wonder His Excellency could engage in constant battles while still cultivating his Divine Abilities at such a divine speed... With this world in hand, what fear is there of slow cultivation!"

Li Zhouwei scanned the room, deeply satisfied, and let out a quiet sigh of relief.

'All those hazardous items back home... I can move them all in here...'

He looked up. On a desk sat a small jade vial. In the center of the pavilion hung a painting of a white sparrow in soaring flight. Li Zhouwei didn't even need to use his spiritual sense; a single glance with his golden eyes told him it was a cultivation art.

He strode forward, his golden eyes flashing, and took the vial in his hand.

The jade vial had a long neck and a pure white body. The moment Li Zhouwei held it, he saw layers of hazy, azure mist swirling within, pulsing up and down. He froze.

"A Purple Mansion's Azure Talisman?"

The instant he saw it, the Talisman Seed in his Shengyang Mansion flared violently, like the rising sun shattering the morning clouds. It ascended through the power of his Bright Yang Divine Ability, transforming into a streak of pure white light.

The azure mist, which had been sealed tightly within the bottle, seemed to receive a summons. It began to leap out, strand by strand, wisp by wisp, until it became a torrent bursting its banks. It erupted forth, creating myriad visions. The white light from his glabella met it, and all of it poured into his Shengyang Mansion!

Li Zhouwei was both shocked and overjoyed. He immediately sat cross-legged. A profound coolness filled his Shengyang Mansion. The *Audience with the Celestial Gate* within him, as if drinking sweet nectar, instantly stirred and activated.

His cultivation surged!

The bright white celestial gate within his Shengyang Mansion manifested. One by one, the white patterns covering it glowed with pristine light, rapidly growing in complexity. The seventy-two ridges on its eaves all lit up, stretching and extending further.

The azure mist surged within his Shengyang Mansion, becoming a powerful center of attraction. The radiance of the sun and moon in this world, mixed with this spiritual inspiration, poured madly into his body. Yet, this world's spiritual inspiration was perfectly balanced; it did not fluctuate by a single fraction. No matter how much he absorbed, the ambient inspiration never depleted, implying a vast, limitless supply for his taking.

As the spiritual inspiration gathered, it mixed with the azure mist, transforming into Divine Ability dharma power, which all flowed into the celestial gate. In just a quarter of an hour, *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was perfected!

An Azure Talisman was the essence of an entire Purple Mansion Realm. Even after polishing his Divine Ability to perfection, there was still a good portion of the Azure Talisman remaining.

The azure mist in his Shengyang Mansion had not stopped; it continued to surge toward the Divine Ability. But *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was full. The excess mist had nowhere to go. It could only accumulate, drifting aimlessly within the white light.

At that moment, the true form of the Talisman Seed emerged from the base of the Shengyang Mansion. The azure mist, as if summoned again, transformed into a sheet of azure light. It all converged beneath the pellet, coalescing into a long, narrow, azure talisman. It appeared somewhat dim and unsubstantial as it floated, finally coming to rest *above* the perfected *Audience with the Celestial Gate*.

Li Zhouwei's spiritual sense brushed against it. He knew instantly that with a single thought, this object could dissolve back into azure mist and dharma power, ready to elevate his cultivation once more!

'As soon as I cultivate the next Divine Ability, I can use the rest of this azure mist...'

The flash of joy was fleeting; he had no extra energy to focus on it.

His glabella shone like a star, emitting pulses of golden light. He sat like an old monk deep in meditation. His mind fell into darkness, and soon, a light grew within it. Strokes of white-gold light appeared, the two colors weaving and changing.

*Illuminating Sun and Moon*.

This Talisman Qi could sweep away demonic obstacles, secure his lineage, and establish peace. It unleashed the might of Bright Yang, gathering his destiny and binding his life-mandate to his Shengyang Mansion. In the midst of life-and-death battles, whenever he shattered a Divine Ability or defeated demonic and Buddhist foes, he would feel his life-mandate resonate. It would connect with the sun, moon, and world, causing the dharma power of his Shengyang Mansion to manifest and grant him a measure of Dao-Profundity!

'Dao-Profundity? Raising Dao-Profundity... *that* can be raised too?!'

This was completely different from Li Xizhi's *Rainbow Pierce Skyway*!

'Li Xizhi's *Rainbow Pierce Skyway* is driven by status and nobility, which causes his spell arts to grow stronger over time. While it also aids the growth of his Dao-Profundity, it doesn't *directly* increase it...'

The concept of Dao-Profundity was ancient and mysterious. It primarily represented one's personal comprehension of Divine Abilities, their Daoist tradition, and their legacies. Disciples from major sects with long cultivation histories often had higher Dao-Profundity, making them more formidable in combat.

Dao-Profundity was strongly correlated with the subtlety of one's spell arts; they enhanced one another. However, Dao-Profundity often had bottlenecks. Learning new spell arts could raise it initially, but unless one could continuously acquire more and more exquisite spell arts and spend time mastering them, it wouldn't necessarily keep rising. On the other hand, an increase in Dao-Profundity was beneficial for cultivating spell arts, channeling Divine Abilities, and even one's overall cultivation speed.

'This means that after a single bloody battle, if I defeat a sufficiently powerful enemy, my gain in Dao-Profundity might surpass years of someone else's research. And the benefits aren't limited to combat. Once my Dao-Profundity accumulates to a certain point, both *Audience with the Celestial Gate* and the *Pure Yang Bracelets* will undoubtedly bloom with a different kind of brilliance in my hands! I will gain a deeper understanding of controlling generative power, harmonizing Bright Yang, and transforming my Divine Abilities.'

'It will even be a tremendous help in striking for Fruition Attainment and achieving a Golden Core!'

And the second ability, "binding his life-mandate to his Mansion," was also immensely useful.

Li Zhouwei carried a great destiny and was known as a descendant of the Wei Emperor's bloodline. His dharma body was already superior to others. Ever since he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, he had held a dim, intuitive understanding...

'Even though I haven't cultivated a Body Divine Ability, the current strength of my dharma body is already far greater than Li Ximing's was when he had just perfected *Audience with the Celestial Gate*. My 'white blood' can suppress evil influences, especially demonic dao dharma power. It's difficult for it to linger on my body, making it much faster to expel. But just as a more precise and complex art is harder to cultivate, if my dharma body is damaged, the difficulty of repairing it is also far greater than it is for Li Ximing.'

This Talisman Qi's ability to "gather destiny" and "bind his life-mandate to his Mansion" made his destiny more stable, harder to injure, refine, or consume. His Divine Abilities and dharma power would become more concentrated within his Shengyang Mansion. This meant he would be *less* reliant on his physical dharma body and would have more freedom in controlling it. He could mitigate damage through various transformations—even his healing speed would be a fraction faster. It effectively patched up this significant weakness.

'Looking at it this way... it's less like the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao and more like that Heavenly Embryo Dao from the north...'

This was, without a doubt, a massive enhancement to his combat prowess. Li Zhouwei had never studied the Heavenly Embryo Dao, but the *Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts* he possessed did indeed bear traces of Great Liang.

There was also the phrase "secure his lineage and establish peace, unleash the might of Bright Yang." This pointed directly to the Bright Yang essence of ruler-and-subject, father-and-son—a relationship of mutual aid and mutual contention. Its mysteries, however, were not directly related to combat or cultivation. At most, his own cultivation progress might provide a vague boost to his descendants, but the effect was not significant, and there were no other details.

The last ability, "sweep away demonic obstacles," was the Talisman Qi's most minor effect. It simply pushed the demon-breaking and evil-dispelling properties of Bright Yang to a higher level. Reflected in his Divine Ability, it meant his dharma body's resistance to the demonic dao would be stronger. While a decent boost, it seemed almost negligible compared to the profound abilities that preceded it.

As the Talisman Qi settled within him, Li Zhouwei's features became more majestic. Golden light pulsed gently from his glabella. His Shengyang Mansion felt cool and clear. An unknown amount of time passed before he slowly opened his eyes.

For a moment, light flared in the empty room. His golden pupils slowly faded from a brilliant white-gold back to their usual dark gold. His hand moved lightly to his waist, and he retrieved a jade slip.

*Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*!



# Chapter 913, Today, It Is No More

Tangdao Mountain Range.

The array formation in the sky flickered. Dissipating flames littered the ground as waterfalls of white energy streamed across the distant horizon. A Master Monk in kasaya robes wielded a great hammer, smashing it against the grand array.

A deafening *boom!* echoed like thunder. Cultivators on both sides with weaker cultivations immediately cried out in pain, shaken by the force. In an instant, True Fire surged, dissolving the brilliant, light-like dharma power. The woman holding a bright lamp descended upon the flames, her face somewhat pale.

Li Minggong looked up, her gaze piercing the clouds. She could just make out a colossal golden body, flickering in and out of view like a dreadful, terrifying golden colossus suspended in the air. Its mere presence struck fear into the hearts of all who saw it.

These spell arts from the Merciful One were being intercepted, one by one, by another array on a distant mountain peak. The enemy had already advanced deep into their territory but seemed wary of something and did not descend personally, which granted the defenders a precious moment to breathe.

Li Minggong did not know the status of the war in the north, but the endless stream of Buddhist cultivators pouring in from the direction of Xiaoshi Mountain was certainly no good omen. She glanced around. Morale within the array was dangerously low. The disciples from the major sects were holding up, but the members of the various local families were visibly scattered. Though they said nothing, their disorganized state spoke volumes.

She had been sent here as reinforcement. Most of these people were not from her own faction; only a portion were from territories governed by Azure Pond. Still, they knew her status was significant. They cowered before her, yet she could feel their silent, simmering dissatisfaction.

'The Jiangnan cultivators... they don't really care if Jiangbei is lost. They were driven here by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and have no will to fight. Besides, the north and south have fought for so many years... their vitality was drained long ago.'

These matters were not for her to decide. Just then, two black-robed cultivators approached on the wind and spoke in low voices,

"Fellow Daoist, please prepare. If this array cannot be held, we will cover your retreat into the mountains."

As a leading figure of a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan, the Great Xiukui Monastery naturally couldn't let Li Minggong fall into peril. They had sent men to wait for her early on.

The moment these two appeared, the attention of the already-scattered cultivators focused on them instantly. No one was a fool. If Li Minggong and her protectors left, wouldn't they be leaving the rest of them to die?

Li Minggong gave a slight shake of her head, her gaze lowered. The cultivators below seemed to freeze. Occasionally, one or two would steal a glance at her, only to lower their heads as if struck by lightning.

'Go back thirty or fifty years,' Li Minggong thought grimly, 'and my ancestors were just like them. That cold glance... I wonder which family *they* were looking at back then.'

She raised a hand, dissolving another blast of brilliant light from the sky, and said aloud,

"The pressure here isn't overwhelming. The Merciful One has reached this point but isn't attacking personally. If we can get more people... we can still hold."

While outwardly reassuring the crowd, Li Minggong secretly transmitted a message to the two men,

'How are things on the mountain? Have the masters returned?'

The two exchanged a glance and replied using the same secret technique,

'We do not know. We only heard from a fellow disciple near Lord Quan... that his expression was not good.'

Li Minggong sighed. As she did, another ray of golden light descended, striking the array and causing it to tremble. High up on the mountain, an old rogue cultivator at the Embyronic Breathing stage ran out of dharma power and tumbled from his post. Li Minggong deftly caught him, supporting him with her True Fire.

Once stable, the old man scrambled to offer his thanks from within the flames. He was clutching a broken golden dharma artifact in his left hand, and he wiped his right hand—which was missing its index finger—on his chest before calling out,
"Thank you, my lady..."

Li Minggong had been defending this post for some time, but this was the first "thank you" she had heard. She silently shook her head. The old rogue cultivator seized the chance to weep,

"After so many battles, this lowly one's disciples are all dead. If not for my lady's rescue, falling from this mountain... I could have died from the fall. But... how long will this torment last?"

At these words, everyone below pricked up their ears. Li Minggong could only reply,

"Tangdao is the gateway to Jiangnan... When it ends depends on the north."

The old man immediately burst into tears.

"My disciples often praised... said that since Azure Pond's governance was taken over, the prefectures are much better off. The tributes are low, no need to go to Yi Mountain City, and the old corruption is gone... But now, it seems the tribute was *too* light, leaving the Daoist Masters hard-pressed. Back then, we went north to plunder... In past years... even if every household had to send one person to the Southern Borderlands, it never reached the point of our Daoist tradition being nearly severed..."

A dead silence fell over the crowd. The current situation wasn't the fault of any single family. Even if the Chi family were still in charge of Azure Pond, things would be no better. But the relief the people had experienced was real. How could Li Minggong possibly explain? She merely placed a hand on the arm of one of the black-robed men, whose expression had darkened, and shook her head.

"These times cannot be compared to the past..."

She was about to say more when a figure sped towards them, stopping abruptly before her. His expression was stern as he spoke in a deep voice,

"This one is Lin Ya. Daoist Master Zhaojing summons you, Fellow Daoist. Please return to the mountain at once. Leave this place to me!"

A flash of joy appeared on Li MinggSng's face. She nodded and departed on her flames. She quickly passed several checkpoints and arrived at the main array, only to find everyone there rushing about, their faces grim and silent. Passing through a hall, she saw Li Ximing seated at the head.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

She couldn't gauge Li Ximing's condition, but she knew her own Daoist Master was not a severe or inflexible man. He was always kind to his juniors. Yet now, his face was devoid of any smile. He only asked in a heavy tone,

"What are the losses?"

Li Minggong immediately lowered her voice,

"According to the news I've received... Jiangxia is reportedly safe, but the direction of Xiaoshi Mountain was attacked. Two of the breached arrays were ours. One was held by An Xuanxin of the An family, the other by Fei Qing'yi... I heard both arrays are destroyed. I don't know if Fei Qing'yi survived or... or managed to save any disciples... Chenghao and Chengpan... were both at that location... Thankfully, their jade life-talismans are still intact..."

In truth, with a group of Merciful Ones at the Purple Mansion Realm gathered there, the talismans were purely for psychological comfort. Li Ximing's expression remained calm. He said,

"Fei Qing'yi succumbed to demonic arts and was captured by Zhouwei. No need to consider him."

The meaning behind this sentence was staggering. Li Minggong was stunned for a moment, then a look of shocked joy crossed her face.

"Minghuang... he..."

Li Ximing simply waved his hand, his expression complicated.

"Wait for me outside the hall."

Li Minggong immediately withdrew. Only then did Li Ximing's gaze turn dark and uncertain.

There was one reason, when he had first arrived here, he couldn't find a single person from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. The inner array of the Black Wave Piercing Sea Spirit Array at the Tangdao Mountain Range was sealed!

This was unthinkable!

It was a terrible, terrible sign. What kind of situation would require such a drastic measure? Li Ximing's first reaction had been to summon Li Minggong... After all, with the situation in the north unknown, anything could happen next.
'How did it come to this...'

He had only been sitting for a few moments when a crisp sound echoed from outside the hall. A man carrying a sword strode in. His face was pale, but it couldn't hide the dashing aura of a swordsman.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

This was none other than Daoist Master Zhusheng from the Shahuan Kingdom, who cultivated the 'Jade True'. He gestured for Li Ximing to enter the inner array with him. His expression was complex. He scanned Li Ximing up and down, saw that he was in no better state, and said in a low voice,

"In the battle at Luoxia, Hengzhu also acted. That Grand Preceptor of Zhao State, Wei Xuanyin, also came south... Fortunately, Daoist Friend Xiao intervened. But then Changxiao arrived... After a long fight, Wei Xuanyin is just too powerful... Kui Qi..."

He fell silent for a moment, then continued using a secret transmission,
'We retreated from the north, fighting all the way. From Luoxia to Tangdao, it took less than half a tea-time. He spat up blood three times... That blood... was entirely white. It transformed into shrews. It was... very bad.'

'Kui Qi?'

Li Ximing's heart turned to ice. Before he could ask more, they had already arrived before a great hall shrouded in black light. As they passed through the faint black barrier, they were met with a scene of rolling black smoke pouring down the steps like a waterfall. Crows circled overhead, perched on the eaves, and let out sharp, agonizing shrieks.

When Li Ximing appeared, flocks of black crows swarmed down at him, cawing and weeping tears like rain. The moment the tears approached him, they were evaporated by the Bright Yang radiance of his body, unable to touch him.

At the entrance to the dark hall, Tinglan was standing guard, her eyes filled with tears. She bowed slightly to the two of them and raised her sleeve.

In an instant, a torrent of purple qi erupted, shooting straight into the sky. It tore through the hall, shattering bricks and stone, and instantly ripped the roof from the building, leaving behind a field of debris. The crows scattered in terror.

"What is this!"

Li Ximing froze. He saw Tinglan shake her head, her voice hoarse,

"You are an imperial scion. Bright Yang in a guest or weak position entering this house is trapped by yin energy. It greatly benefits the Veiled Yin... You shouldn't have come. But now... it doesn't matter. Just destroying the roof removes the 'trapped' intent. It will make him more comfortable."

"How did it come to this!"

Li Ximing had expected the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition might suffer casualties, but he had never imagined it would be Kui Qi who died. His heart grew heavy. He watched Tinglan shake her head again, her voice laced with hatred,

"Things changed. Who could have known? That talisman shouldn't have had this effect. The enemy already saw our trump cards, adjusted their divine abilities, and modified their spell arts... To say something offensive..."

Li Ximing's heart sank, sensing what was coming, but thankfully, she stopped herself. He said nothing and followed her inside, bracing himself. Immediately, he heard the sound of faint, rasping coughs and a harsh, ragged breathing.

"Huu..."

The breathing was like a desperate gasp, yet it also sounded like a wounded crow or hawk, trying to laugh through its injury.

With the hall torn open, a fierce wind swept through, sending dark shapes swirling. The floor was entirely covered, large and small, in black feathers, rising past their ankles. He approached the main seat and saw a black-robed man collapsed on the steps. A talisman was plastered to his chest. His half-closed eyes were a pale gray as he stared at the sky, coughing incessantly.

It was Kui Qi.

Daoist Master Houfu stood nearby, his eyes tightly closed, as silent as a ghost. Li Ximing glanced at him once, not daring to look longer, and said in a low voice,

"I cultivate Bright Yang, after all. Perhaps I can help."

The man on the steps gave no reaction, lost in his coughing. Tinglan sat quietly on the steps below him and said,

"We already thought of that. Veiled Yin and Bright Yang can only suppress one another. Wei Xuanyin is a Great Daoist Master. Your help would only make it worse."

As they spoke, Kui Qi slowly turned his head. This man, usually so proud and self-possessed, now had his cheek pressed against the cold stone steps, stripped of all dignity. He rasped,

"Li Ximing..."

"Senior..."

Kui Qi was silent for a moment, then asked, gasping,

"Your family... and... and..."

He reached this point and suddenly began to struggle, his mouth gaping open, his eyes wide and staring. Li Ximing suddenly saw, from between his teeth, a scarlet, fleshy tip slowly emerging.

The thing vanished as quickly as it appeared, forcefully swallowed back down by Kui Qi. He managed a strained smile.

"Daoist friend, you held back Helian Wujiang, suffering heavy losses. We are extremely grateful. But the treasure disk is symbolic and cannot be given lightly. That bit of essence... I had Houfu retrieve it for..."

Li Ximing cut in,

"Senior, please rest and recuperate..."

Kui Qi shook his head. He didn't pursue the matter, but instead said in a heavy voice,

"Zhu Gong has many faults... and a dark past... but she did her all at Xiaoshi Mountain. If the Kong Clan is ever restored... their sect's matter... I hope Daoist friend can lend a hand."

Li Ximing knew exactly what he meant.

The Kong Clan was fallen, but Kong Tingyun was still missing, in seclusion somewhere. And she was a very close friend of the Li family—a good friend of Li Yuanjiao back in the day.

Zhu Gong's whereabouts were unknown, but after two major battles, she was certainly grievously wounded. Even if she was alive, she wouldn't have much strength left. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's reward would be substantial, and perhaps she could recover quickly. But if Kong Tingyun were to reappear one day, given her friendship with the Li Clan, it would likely cause turmoil.

In truth, Zhu Gong had a bad reputation and a spotted history. If she had taken the reward and fled back to the Eastern Sea, no one would blame her. Yet here was Kui Qi, on his deathbed, still trying to preserve that last shred of dignity for the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, trying to keep even the worst-case scenario under control...

'But even if Kong Tingyun really breaks through, she'd only be in the early Purple Mansion Realm. How could she be so foolish as to challenge Zhu Gong, who is backed by the entire Supreme Yang Daoist tradition? Why does he even need to ask this?'

Li Ximing sighed inwardly, but replied aloud,

"Kong Tingyun is not an aggressive person... Senior worries too much..."

Kui Qi opened his mouth again,

"...In the future... the Li Clan will face the north directly..."

He had only spoken this one sentence when that scarlet tip stubbornly emerged from between his lips again. The fleshy tip looked smooth and sticky, covered in faint white veins, and it was pulsing. The black-robed man struggled to swallow it back down, pounding his chest, but finally, he turned his body to the side and vomited toward the ground.

"Ommph..."

He sprayed a mouthful of blood onto the floor.

Amidst the massive spray of scarlet and black blood, a large, oval object landed on the ground. It bounced twice with a sickening elasticity before rolling to a stop at Tinglan's feet. Only then did Li Ximing see it clearly.

It was his heart.

The heart was still contracting, beating powerfully. White meridians pulsed across its surface. From a thick, severed blood vessel, a small, furry white snout poked out, then, as if startled, darted back inside.

Perhaps because of the array formation, or the talisman's influence, the blood on the ground slowly turned white but did not transform into any strange phenomenon. Kui Qi immediately snatched the heart up, his hand dripping with blood. He gripped it with four fingers, his index finger hanging limp.

The dying man stirred, but didn't ask any more questions. He just exhaled quietly,

"Tangdao... must not be held. Then... retreat."

Li Ximing had waited this long, and finally, he had received the order. He watched as the blood-soaked hand went limp, slowly relaxing its grip. The heart slipped from his fingers, fell to the ground, and rolled over. It transformed into a pregnant white shrew, clutching its large belly. It struggled, letting out tiny, squeaking cries.

"Zhi... zhi zhi..."

Kui Qi looked up at the sky. In the distance, layers of black fog were rising, one after another. The noon sky instantly turned dark. Tinglan and Li Ximing both looked up, their expressions complex as they stared at the north.

As the black fog surged into the heavens, rainbow-colored, roaming dragons danced within it. As if their mission was complete, they let out roars that were both joyful and sorrowful, before plummeting back to the earth.

"Clang... clang... clang..."

At the same time, the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword at Kui Qi's waist began to tremble madly, letting out one mournful wail after another. A fierce wind tore through the mountain. A single tear suddenly slipped from the corner of the black-robed man's eye, and he cried out in grief,

"Master!"

As the black fog rose on the horizon, an infinite black light erupted from the back of his head—a storm of black-cloud owls. A great crow cawed, a heart-shattering, soul-piercing cry. Sad and sharp, Xiukui flew everywhere as yin-spirits flickered in and out of existence.

Amidst the roiling black light, the man began to vomit blood, and then his organs, liver, spleen, lungs, stomach, all fled his body one by one. The talisman could no longer suppress his body. It leaped from his chest and transformed into a large-eyed Xiukui, its gaze bright as it stared at the sky.

The Xiukui looked at the sky for only a second before swiftly turning its head back. It let out a gurgling sound, as if in excitement, or perhaps terror. Then, with lightning speed, its beak shot out and plucked Kui Qi's eye from its socket, swallowing it whole.

In that instant, the dying man on the ground raised his head. His one remaining eye bulged, shot through with blood, filled with defiance and fury. His mouth opened, but no sound came out. Instead, the shriek-like wail erupted from the Xiukui's beak, treacherous and evil, soaring into the sky,

"Supreme Yang Radiance, today, it is no more!"

The Xiukui beat its wings and circled in the air. The sound he had made with the last shred of his life-mandate was trapped within the small inner array, echoing over and over, never to be released,

"Supreme Yang Radiance, today, it is no more! It is no more!"

# Chapter 914: The Greater Good

A screech-owl wailed in the sky. Houfu, who had been standing aside like a phantom, shed tears. He took a step back from the roiling black light and pulled a white talisman from his sleeve.

The talisman’s markings were profound, radiating a brilliant light that pushed back against the darkness. The screech-owl circling ever higher in the sky seemed to receive some summons. It struggled, descending with great reluctance, drawing all the black light with it. It transformed back into a talisman and flew into the white one.

Then, the great crows shrieked. They plummeted from the sky, smashing into the ruined pillars and the throne. Blood splattered everywhere as they crashed to their deaths, one by one. In less than fifteen minutes, the ground was littered with bird corpses. Their wings were stiff, their eyes wide open—a scene of utter devastation.

The black fog on the horizon also seemed to be suppressed by something. It did not spread; instead, it steadily weakened and vanished.

A Daoist Master with three spiritual penetrations and a Great Daoist Master sword immortal with four... both had fallen at the same instant. What an overpowering, dominant display of force.

Bursts of light flashed across the sky as the black aura finally receded. The grand array's light dimmed. A woman materialized in the wind, descending nearby. She furled her dharma umbrella, remaining silent.

It was Hengxing.

Li Ximing stood amidst the field of bird corpses. Tinglan had stepped aside. They watched Houfu walk slowly to the front of the steps. The brown-robed man tucked the talisman back into his sleeve, his expression already calm. He plopped down on the spot where Kui Qi's body had been.

He raised an eyebrow and said quietly, “I am following my Martial Uncle's last command. We are retreating to Jiangnan.”

Beside them, Hengxing's expression was incredibly complex. Her gaze was lowered, concealing the emotions in her eyes. Her vermilion lips pressed together. Several breaths passed before Li Ximing noticed two streams of tears rolling down her fair face. She seemed to be sobbing.

“That stubborn fool! Did he—did Lin Jianqi—not know how dangerous this was? He had finally reached the Purple Mansion Realm…”

The cultivators had all sensed something unusual about this conflict between north and south, but none could have imagined the North would be this ruthless. Hengxing's words were more of an outburst. It made Houfu lower his head. He replied, “Everyone makes their own choices. If you take a risk, you bear the consequences. Thank you both for considering the greater good…”

Hearing this, Hengxing was overcome with grief and anguish. She gritted her teeth.

“Year after year, you sealed your Daoist tradition, allowing the demonic and the Buddhists to run rampant. Who knows how many people died then! But now he decides to act noble? Why not prioritize the 'greater good' now? Why not harvest the blood qi of a few thousand mortals? Use some Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items? With the power of your Great Xiukui Monastery, how could you not save him?”

“‘Prioritize the greater good’... why not prioritize it now? If your Great Xiukui Monastery had prioritized the 'greater good' from the start and become the next Azure Pond, if you had used the Heavenly Embryo Dao, you would have been able to resist the North's demonic forces and Buddhists!

“Even if it meant harming countless cultivators and commoners, wouldn't that have been better than letting those devils and Buddhist cultivators sweep across all of Jiangbei? Even now, if the greater good is what matters, shouldn't you have saved Lin Jianqi first? It's just condoning murder! Have you not done that enough?”

Finishing her tirade, she turned to Tinglan and wept. “At worst, you’d have another Chi Wei, and at least *he* could have managed the situation. But no, you couldn't walk the righteous path to the end, and you kept up your ambiguous ties with the North. This conflict... this conflict... in past years, wasn't it just a sordid deal between you few northern families and the Buddhist cultivators? Back then, when you sat by and watched the Murong family advance south, did you ever think of today? Bargaining with tigers! And now that disaster has struck…”

At this, she finally choked on her words, falling silent. Tinglan wept silently. Houfu raised his head, his eyes listless.

“What is the greater good?”

“My Xiukui name was never famous. We were once just a branch office of Tiger's Frontier. The world fell into chaos. Then, True Monarch Taiyue came from the sea, took over the branch, and established a Daoist tradition, naming it the 'Kui Cultivating Sect' (Xiu Kui). He brought peace to the land.”

“The True Monarch passed down his Daoist tradition to two disciples. One was named Lin, our Great Xiukui Monastery's ancestor, Ancestor Honglan. He was given mastery of the Celestial Xiukui. The other was named Nian, ancestor of the current Nian family, Daoist Master Dongtai. He was given mastery of The Unsurpassed.”

Daoist Master Tinglan said nothing, listening to him continue.

“Later, the True Monarch pursued the Dao and traveled with Daoist Master Dongtai and several others to Jiangbei, where they established the Yue Cultivating Sect (Xiu Yue). Ancestor Honglan stayed to preside over the Kui Cultivating Sect. When the ancestor fell, his final will was to establish a monastery. He decreed the 'Xiu' in our name, which meant 'to cultivate', be replaced with the 'Xiu' of 'Xiukui', and added the word 'Great'. Thus, the Great Xiukui Monastery was founded.”

The man's expression was bleak. “By lineage, Yue Cultivating and Xiukui are from the same master. By apprenticeship, Yue Cultivating is our Upper Sect. This land of Jiangbei, this Sanxi, even the Xiuyue Mountain Gate... Lord Lou Xing, Martial Uncle Kui Qi... they all went there to train.”

Li Ximing felt a mix of sorrow and shock.

'Yue Cultivating Sect never made a move...'

The man before him continued in a low voice, “The Immortal Mansion once decreed that immortals and mortals be separate. All sects were to hide in the mountains, forbidden from ruling, and all were to honor the Green Pine. None were to act under the name of the Supreme Yin. *That* was the greater good back then.

“Later, the Immortal Mansion sealed itself and vanished. In all of Jiangbei and Jiangnan, only four sects truly upheld that rule.”

“Yue Cultivating, Sword Gate, Xiukui, and Hengzhu.”

Tinglan remained silent as Houfu spoke softly. “Beneath my Great Xiukui Monastery, the mountains are filled with countless temples. This is our foundation. Before Martial Uncle Kui Qi, we rarely intervened. Even when Li Jiangqun called himself the heir of Supreme Yin, Lord Lou Xing merely went to Yue Cultivating Sect to study; he didn't join his banner.

“When it comes to non-interference, my Great Xiukui Monastery's rules are no less strict than Sword Gate's. We just live deep in the mountains, untouched by the common moral code, without your spiritual pines or sword manuals. But when the time came to change, it was just as difficult for us.

“Coming to today, I'll be blunt: aside from your Hengzhu affairs, my Great Xiukui Monastery has wronged no one. Martial Uncle Kui Qi's fall today was *also* for the Supreme Yang Dao Daoist tradition! He, too, prioritized the greater good! Otherwise, we could have just hidden in Tiger's Frontier. What would Jiangbei's fate have to do with us?”

Houfu slowly closed his eyes. “The Azure Pond affair was just the Chi family. They are already annihilated…”

Hengxing wiped her tears and shook her head.

“Do you think I don't understand?”

“This isn't the time for argument. I just have a few questions. Everyone in the world sees the 'greater good,' but how many truly act for it? The golden Daoist tradition in the northern mountains—their words are so righteous. Isn't everything they do for *their* greater good?

“This so-called 'greater good,' it's vital, yes, but most of the time it's just a tool the righteous path uses to temporarily lower its own standards. It just forces some people to compromise and endure. Sometimes, it's even used to justify abandoning morality entirely. How many evil deeds began with 'considering the greater good'? How much slaughter has been committed in its name?”

She spoke with furious tears. “Lin Jianqi was willing to die for it. But how many people in this world can be Lin Jianqi?”

With that, Hengxing turned away. A few tears scattered, transforming into a crimson wind. It plucked a black feather from the ground, passed through the array, and drifted away, dissipating into a red mist.

Houfu stood silently on the steps, watching her depart. After a long time, he sighed and asked, “How is Ning Wan?”

Tinglan lowered her gaze. “She returned to Azure Pond. No word yet.”

A deep weariness surfaced in the brown-robed man's eyes. Cultivators from the Great Xiukui Monastery were known for their pride, and Houfu especially so. This ordeal had left him exhausted. He looked at Li Ximing and said in a low voice, “We’ve made a fool of ourselves in front of Zhaojing. You may take your people back when you see fit. We still need to... clean up. I will come discuss matters with you again later.”

Although the conclusion had been drawn long ago, Li Ximing still felt a sense of gloom.

'We couldn't even hold the Sanxi region. From now on, the Buddhist cultivators will be right across the river...'

The retreat of the Supreme Yang Dao Daoist tradition from Jiangbei was terrible news for Li Ximing. Once the Buddhist cultivators and demonic cultivators entered Baijiang Creek, who knew how much trouble would follow?

“Alright…”

He agreed. Houfu fumbled in his sleeve and took out a jade box. He lifted the lid, revealing its contents: a palm-sized, ink-black stone cylinder, its concave parts flashing with brilliant color.

“Please take this, fellow Daoist. We feel terrible about your injuries... I don't have the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill with me, but I will arrange for one to be sent to you.”

Li Ximing refused a few times and did not accept it. He quickly took his leave. Houfu shook his head silently.

“Have someone deliver it to Moongaze Lake. Although the lake itself was unharmed, they were badly frightened. We can't let them have second thoughts.”

Helian Wumeng had been intercepted by Li Zhouwei, after all. If not for that, the lake would have seen a massacre. The incident seemed small, but its implications were not. It was a troublesome matter to resolve.

Tinglan watched him go. “He’s been short one Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill for a long time. The Bright Yang spiritual essence is good, but we have a finite supply. You need to be careful with it…”

Houfu looked helpless. "I know. But times are different. Now that Jiangbei is lost, we will face difficulties everywhere. We didn't even get Secret Diffusion's item. We can't be sure we'll get anything next time. We must be frugal and plan for the long term.

“But Li Ximing is different. Martial Uncle had him stay in the array and gave specific instructions. His intentions were obvious. He specifically mentioned the spiritual essence, so we must give it…

“Others see it the same way. Li Ximing is close to us and gave his all to bog down Helian Wumeng. If he doesn't get a good reward for that, no one else will be tempted to work for us either. And besides, there is still Li Zhouwei!”

Houfu rubbed his temples. Now that it was his turn to be in charge, he was starting to understand Kui Qi's old frustrations. “As for the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill you mentioned, since it's what he needs, we'll keep it on hand. It will give us more flexibility next time.”

“Mm.”

Tinglan acknowledged. “Now that we’ve returned to Jiangnan, things will probably be easier... Xiao Chuting's intervention this time was unexpected... I wonder what the future holds…”

“We must thank him for this, but we cannot rely on him in the future.” Houfu's expression held a trace of regret. “He cultivated Pit Water long ago and forcibly carved a path for himself. Although Pit Water has no master, that path is incredibly difficult. He was only able to return because Mount Xianyou's plans are not yet complete.”

Li Ximing left the main hall and exited the inner array. He saw the sword cultivator from the Jade True Dao sitting by a green stone, drinking alone.

Daoist Master Zhusheng asked, “How is fellow Daoist Kui Qi?”

Seeing Li Ximing's mournful expression, he knew the news was not good. He patted his sleeves, stood up, and observed a few moments of silence. He shook his head, clasped his hands behind his back, and said, “I saw fellow Daoist Hengxing rush out without even stopping. I knew things must be bad.”

Li Ximing exchanged a few pleasantries. Zhusheng said, “I heard from Tinglan that you have the Aged Courtly Path Sutra. When there's a chance, I'd like to take a look. I'm mainly interested in the Courtly Red Dust Qi. My own Daoist tradition mentions it, so it would be best if I could see it.”

A portion of Courtly Red Dust Qi had already been pledged. Who knew how many years it would be before he got more. But it was worth mentioning. Zhusheng could see he was distracted and bid him farewell. Li Ximing left from the side exit, his heart heavy with worry.

He returned to the great hall. Li Minggong was still waiting. She reported, “Word has come about the Fei family. The Family Head's intention is... to ask the Tangdao Mountain Range.”

How could Li Ximing not know Li Jiangqian's meaning? But Li Minggong hadn't experienced the family's recent turmoil; she only knew that Fei Qing'yi had rebelled and felt she had to ask. Li Ximing's expression, however, was icy. He waved his hand.

“Go directly to Wen Wu. Tell him to take care of it.”

On this matter, Li Ximing felt a deeper, lingering fear than Li Zhouwei and the others. Li Minggong's expression turned grim. She hurried off, leaving Li Ximing sitting alone in the hall.

The Daoist Master poured himself a cup of tea. His gaze drifted to the dark waves roiling in the distant night sky. The evening sun was completely obscured, unable to bleed even a hint of red through.

He sat in quiet contemplation. A long time passed before he rested his hand on the table and lifted his cup.

'Yehui... what will he choose...'

…

Xiaoshi Mountain.

The sunset was like blood. Wreckage littered the ground. A colossal golden visage stood in the clouds, radiating layers of light. On the ground, monks scurried about and Master Monks rode the wind, a grim, murderous aura hanging over them.

The Buddhist cultivators were not like those of the Immortal Dao; they didn't set up as many arrays. Several Merciful Ones had conquered Xiaoshi Mountain and were immediately moving on to the Tangdao Mountain Range. They had no time to secure the area. The three Buddhist cultivators who had gone north had not yet returned, but they were encamped near the main peak of Tangdao. This place was left relatively empty.

It wasn't until a Merciful One flying past picked up Helian Wumeng and brought him back to garrison here that the sporadic resistance finally died out.

The man, who wore eighteen glass prayer beads at his waist, held a long-handled scythe-like blade. He approached, riding a cloud of baleful qi. His expression was calm, but seeing the ant-like swarm of monks and Master Monks on the ground, a trace of disgust rose in his eyes.

'Like weeds. They spring up wherever they go...'

Just then, a nun flew over, treading on a lotus throne. She wore a joyful expression and smiled.

“Greetings, General Helian! I am Nu Xiao, serving under the Great Desire…”

Helian Wumeng glanced at her. The Buddhist cultivators had, at least, just sent someone to support him. And while this woman's cultivation was lacking, her status was clearly not low, implying she had backing. He suppressed some of his coldness and said casually, “So, it is Merciful One Nu Xiao.”

He seemed to recall something and gave a cold sneer. “I imagine you are perfectly aware of what I saw on the riverbank. Are you here eagerly sniffing for news?”

After all, the great war that had made the Helian family's fortune was the Qi Emperor's crusade against the Wei crown prince. As a Purple Mansion Realm expert of the Helian family, Helian Wumeng certainly knew of the entanglements between these Buddhist cultivators and the Wei and Li families.

Unexpectedly, his question made Merciful One Nu Xiao look rather disappointed.

“The General is correct... but that man's destiny is too great. He is not someone a minor figure like me can touch. Perhaps one day, in a great siege, I might be able to snatch a bite or two from the sidelines. That would be fortunate enough…”

'Who do you think you are? That Audience with the Celestial Gate is already adept at killing Merciful Ones. Once his wings are fully fledged, you’d be brave just to show your face in front of him!'

Helian Wumeng was proud and held himself in high regard. In all his years of fighting, only that man had earned the right to be called his lifelong nemesis after a single battle. He naturally looked down on these Buddhist cultivators. He sneered, his disdain obvious.

The nun before him, however, simply beamed, not minding his cold reception in the slightest.

“I’ve come into possession of a treasure. Seeing the General's return, I came specifically to ask if you would honor me with a look!”



# Chapter 915: Clan Brother

The setting sun was like blood.

The blood on the ground slowly congealed. In the twilight, the residual light of a great array flickered. A man stood against the wind, draped in black robes, his hair a grizzled white. He was covered in blood. Though his thin beard gave him a serious, proper appearance, his face was a mask of utter ruthlessness, savage and
fierce.

His grey-black eyes reflected the blood-red sunset. Before him, the golden alms bowl magnified once more. The man had no choice but to raise his Dharma sword and meet it with a heavy blow.

"Clang!"

The black-robed man felt his arms go heavy. His head swam, and blood trickled from his nose. A medley of acrid, sweet, and bitter tastes rose in his throat. He couldn't stop a cough, spattering his robes with a fresh spray of blood.

"Sir!"

A voice echoed by his ear. The black-robed man forced himself to turn his head. Not far away, he saw his younger clan brother kneeling, vomiting blood.

His vision blurred, the scene pulsing near and far. The golden light in the sky intensified, growing so bright that Li Chenghao could no longer keep his eyes open.

At this moment, Li Chenghao knew all hope of survival was gone. He looked down at the blood on his robes, took a step back, and drove his Dharma sword into the earth, using it to prop himself up.

The man's robes, heavy with gore, no longer billowed in the wind. They clung to him, sticky and cold. He leaned heavily on the sword, a thought drifting through his haze:

‘How far have the Buddhist cultivators broken through… Is Li Minggong still safe…’

Of the family's direct line, Li Minggong was the one Tinglan had specifically instructed Wen Wu to place in the rear. Li Chenghao, a mere Qi Refining cultivator with poor talent, would naturally never have registered on Tinglan's radar.

Even so, Wen Wu had considered his placement, stationing him in the distant south, far from Luoxia, traveling with Fei Qing'yi. But it was a cruel twist of fate. Xiaoshi Mountain had been breached, exposing their position. The Purple Smoke Gate disciples stationed there had been annihilated. Fei Qing'yi had fled. Countless were dead or wounded, leaving only these few.

Through his stupor, Li Chenghao noticed the Buddhist cultivator opposite him hadn't seized the opportunity to attack. Instead, the man looked... vexed. This annoyance sent a jolt of alarm through Li Chenghao.

As a leader of the Yuandu branch and the paternal uncle of Li Zhoufang, Li Chenghao's status was not low. He simply didn't have an ingratiating personality. If one had to be precise, he could call Li Ximing 'Seventh Uncle'. After Li Ximing’s own son, Li Chengzhi, had died, Li Chenghao was, in fact, the closest male relative in that branch of the Chengming lineage. He had received no shortage of favors from them growing up.

A deep chill flooded his heart, snapping him to a dreadful clarity.

‘The Buddhist cultivators have endless methods. This will surely implicate my family… I must die quickly!’

He drew his sword. But the golden bowl flashed like lightning, smashing violently against the Dharma sword in his hand.

Sparks flew. Li Chenghao spat a mouthful of blood, nearly collapsing. He tried to circulate his dharma power, but the heavy golden light from the sky suppressed it, scattering it before it could even gather.

Li Chenghao’s hesitation was all it took. The Buddhist cultivator facing his clan brother attacked. Li Chengpan, who was beside him, was in even worse shape. He raised his spear horizontally, but the cultivator's staff struck it dead center. With a thud, Li Chengpan knelt, blood gushing from his mouth.

The blow didn't kill Li Chengpan, but it shocked Li Chenghao awake. A terrible thought struck him:

‘Chengpan's talent is a bit higher than mine, but he's cowardly and hesitant. He's not even as resolute as Zhouluo...’

Years ago, when Li Zhouluo was managing the clan, Li Chengpan had been wrongly accused. Li Chenghao would have stood up for any clan member, but Li Chengpan had been so moved that he had followed him ever since, respecting him as an elder brother. After all these years, how could Li Chenghao not know his measure?

‘He's grateful, yes,’ Li Chenghao thought, ‘but can gratitude overcome the fear of death? Will he... turn?’

He forced his body, which felt as if it were shattering inch by inch, to move. He lunged forward. But the golden bowl tore through the air again. It smashed against his Dharma sword. With a sharp, metallic crack, the weather-beaten dharma artifact finally broke.

"Clink..."

The sound of the blade hitting the ground was painfully clear. Li Chenghao was left holding a hilt with half a broken blade. He staggered back, retreating to Li Chengpan’s side. He dimly saw the younger man's blood-streaked profile as the youth choked out:

"Sir!"

Li Chenghao hesitated for just one fatal second. A golden light flashed before his eyes. The world spun. A colossal pain exploded in the back of his head, as if all his strength had been ripped away. He fell heavily to the ground.

Light streamed across the sky as a baleful aura roiled. Two figures, one black and one gold, descended. A devil-lord, clad in silver-black armor, trod upon the churning miasma. The Merciful One, shimmering with brilliant light, sat upon a pink-green lotus throne.

The world changed color. The rolling golden light blocked out the blood-red setting sun. Master Monks materialized in the air on both sides, their gazes fixed on the scene.

Li Chenghao swallowed the blood in his mouth and struggled to his feet. He heard the Merciful One in the sky laugh.

"We caught a Ning family member earlier, but only one. It seems our fates were shallow. Xuwang took him. Now, finding these two... this is an unexpected delight!"

Li Chenghao’s heart sank. In the distance, the other captured cultivators were already kneeling, many looking profoundly relieved. Nearby, Li Chengpan had dropped his spear, kneeling blankly.

The sky-borne Nu Xiao laughed. "By thr great karmic affinity, allowing you to see the Way of Radiance and Great Desire! You are being turned from evil to righteousness. Why do you not bow and give thanks!"

"Dong..."

As her words fell, a deep, lingering bell tone sounded from afar. Cries of begging and gratitude rose from all around. Li Chengpan, weeping rivers of tears, slowly lowered his head, though he said nothing.

The Merciful One nodded, a look of gratification on his face.

The Buddhist cultivators had converted many; how could they not see the signs? True, sudden submission was rare. Most people were simply indecisive. A lowered head, a moment of silence, a flicker of hesitation... these were ambiguous acts, but the rest would always follow naturally.

Li Chengpan’s hands trembled. He could no longer find the strength to rise.

Suddenly, his collar tightened. An intense, icy sensation flooded him, as if something had struck the back of his head. Golden light flared. He heard a voice, ragged with a grief so profound it was like the cuckoo weeping blood:

"Get up!"

His grey-white hair wild, Li Chenghao’s dharma power was completely bound, leaving him as weak as a mortal. The broken sword he had tried to stab into the back of Li Chengpan’s head had been blocked by the golden light, the impact merely knocking the younger man forward. The old man could bear no more. The hilt fell from his hand with a clatter. He collapsed, roaring:

"Li Chengpan! Get up!"

His expression was as hard as stone, as resolute as the day on Mount Qingdu when he had shielded Li Chengpan from the clan. But now, it was overlaid with an icy chill, a bone-deep hatred, a heart-tearing anguish. Dark red blood trickled from his trembling lips.

"Li Chengpan!"

Li Chengpan, too, was just as he had been years ago. Kneeling. Silent. Weeping. Only his hands shook.

Tears blurred the young man's vision. The whispering clan elders from that day, seated in their great chairs, dissipated like smoke. They were replaced by the stern, standing figures of Buddhist devils—just as high, just as mighty, pressing down on him until he couldn't utter a single word. He didn't even dare to look back at the old man roaring behind him.

In the sky, Nu Xiao cackled, deeply satisfied. Her pupils reflected the shimmering golden light as the legion of Master Monks began to chant sutras. Auspicious clouds gathered, and a droning hum filled the air as some great ritual began.

"First lose, then gain; only then is desire released. First gain, then lose; only then is the heart understood…"

As the chant rose, the distant bell was joined by the dense, rhythmic sound of wooden fish, drawing nearer. Li Chengpan's heart suddenly grew calm. The sound dulled his grief and filled the bottomless pit of his fear. It seeped into his very marrow, never to be removed.

He pressed his palms together and quietly bowed his head. The wind swept back his dark hair. There, in the radiant golden light, he found a sanctuary for his guilt.

Behind him, the old man thrashed on the ground like a dying fish. The distant wooden fish, rather than calming his fury, only inflamed it, making him more savage. It made his eyes spit a fiery, crimson venom that trickled from the corners of his eyes.

‘Your father died young, Li Chengpan! I was the one who supported you! You were like *my son*! And today, you surrender to the Buddhists! You were framed, and no one dared to speak. I was the one who, risking being dragged down by Li Xixuan, protected you before all the elders! And today, you surrender to the Buddhists! You betray all my care, betray all my support! You animal! I curse my own soft-heartedness! You have left me with no honor in life, and you deny me peace in death!’

Amidst the thudding wooden fish, Li Chenghao’s body began to twist. His blood-flecked beard lengthened. His body seemed to writhe, as if countless rats were moving under his skin. One moment he sprouted hooves, the next, scales; then, a forked tongue. He became a crouching, venomous creature, hopping erratically on the ground.

The chanting from the sky grew heavier. Someone shouted:

"Li Chengpan! The time has come to subdue this venomous creature, to sweep away your past and sever your mortal ties!"

Li Chengpan turned. Inside the old man’s empty robes, there was only a hateful, mindless creature. He grabbed the creature by its head and ran his other hand down its skin-bag, tearing away the extra, twisted limbs. Green blood pooled on the ground. With tears streaming down his face, he cried:

"Clan Brother!"

The cry was heart-wrenching, piercing the air like a suona. Li Chengpan's eyes, usually so cowardly and anxious, were suddenly clear. His back straightened. The venomous creature, as if struck by lightning, instantly lost its evil nature. Its demonic heart was pacified. It hung limply on him, dazed. Its scales began to glow with a golden light.

Li Chengpan pressed his palms together and bowed again. "Today, I have seen the true and bright Dharma and swept away the vexations of the six roots. I vow to follow you, my lord, and cultivate the true fruit."

The Merciful One laughed, overjoyed. "Wrong! Wrong! I never expected such profound fate. You are truly meant for my Great Desire. We must take you, fellow Daoist, to the Buddhist Land at once! We must see the great lord and ask if there is a place reserved for you!"

The sky filled with laughter.

"Wonderful! Wonderful!"

"He has seen the truth! He has broken through!"

But amid the joyous golden light, only Helian Wumeng’s face was dark. His hand tightened on his long-handled glaive, causing the Spiritual Artifact to hum. A grim light entered his eyes, and he looked utterly repulsed.

‘He is an Imperial descendant, after all…’

Although he himself had planned on capturing Li family members to trade for spiritual treasures, there were lines to be drawn. You either killed them, or you traded them back. Their ancestor had been one of the world's foremost figures. How could you torment them like this? His gaze turned icy.

"Nu Xiao!" he snapped. "Did you invite me here just to watch this?"

Nu Xiao faltered, forcing a smile. "I thought this might help you vent your anger, fellow Daoist…"

Helian Wumeng had indeed suffered a setback on the north shore, but he prided himself on being a man of stature. This... this was beneath him. He laughed, a cold, furious sound.

"Ridiculous!"

"Sir, please wait!" Nu Xiao hurried to stop him, her smile obsequious. "Lord Wujiang is currently at my Maha's side, discussing the Dharma. Why don't you join them?"

At this, Helian Wumeng frowned, wondering what she was scheming. "Oh?"

Nu Xiao smiled. "Don't be fooled because their array looks strong, as if it will take ages to crack. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is about to retreat! Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain will soon be ours!"

***

On the north shore, the clouds hung low and heavy. Streaks of light flew back from the north, cutting brilliant trails through the air before landing nearby.

"Clan Brother!"

A man in black robes stood waiting in the wind. He exuded a golden aura, his features dignified, one hand lightly tapping the hilt of his sword. Beside him, a woman in gorgeous robes, possessing a clear, refined beauty, smiled as she looked over with him.

The man he called 'Clan Brother' looked sincere and honest, and was clearly much older. He was being supported by a tall youth, a contrast that only made his own steady temperament seem heavier. His face, however, was pale. He looked back at the greeters and sighed.

"Zhouluo is back..."

"I was in the Azure Pond region and heard news of demon cultivators on the north shore, so I hurried over," said Li Zhouluo, the man in black. "I didn't expect the family to have already resolved it. And with such a joyous event! Congratulations on your triumphant return, Clan Brother..."

Li Zhouluo had been waiting nearby on the lake. When the family sent out a distress signal, his wife, Pang Yunqing, had just come out of seclusion. He brought her along, partly to lend the family aid, and partly to see everyone.

The joy on his face was genuine, without a trace of jealousy. With Li Zhouwei breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, their family was now an Immortal Clan with two such masters. This was a tremendous blessing for him and his descendants. How could he not be happy, especially when it was his own clan brother who had advanced?

But while his heart was full of joy, the man before him showed no sign of happiness. Hearing the congratulations, Li Zhoufang forced a smile. His face was filled with desperate hope as he asked:

"Have you seen Uncle on your way back? I’ve asked several times, but I haven't received any answer... Perhaps I should ask the Daoist Master..."

The 'Uncle' he meant was, of course, Li Chenghao. The 'Daoist Master' was not Li Ximing, who had yet to show himself, but Li Zhouwei, who was cultivating in the lake.

Ever since the incident on Mount Qingdu, Li Zhouluo, though always smiling, had held a poor opinion of Li Chenghao. Still, for such a major issue to be raised, he was taken aback.

"Uncle didn't return with you? I... I don't know where the Daoist Master is. It wouldn't be right to disturb him..."

He didn't know the specific arrangements—that Li Chenghao had been with Fei Qing'yi, from whom all contact had been lost. His first instinct was simply to avoid bothering Li Zhouwei. Listening from the side, Chen Yang broke into a cold sweat. He quickly stepped forward and said in a low, comforting voice:

"Even if there's no news, the Daoist Master has surely made arrangements..."

Li Zhoufang had been simmering with anxiety for too long and finally lost control. He covered his face and wept. "You only say nice things! I've asked, but I'm not allowed to see the Daoist Master! My uncle is lost somewhere out there—how could he still be alive! Besides his sister, Uncle has no other siblings who care! The elders are all on the lake. If we juniors don't keep asking, who in this whole mountain will even remember him!"

At these words, Li Zhouluo fell silent, lowering his head and hiding his hands in his sleeves. Beside him, Pang Yunqing, dressed in her green robes, immediately raised an eyebrow at him. The atmosphere became utterly still.

Fortunately, a streak of purple lightning split the sky. With a roll of dull thunder, a burly man descended, landing on the path. It was Li Zhouda.

He had received Li Chenghui’s legacy and had been brushed by the recent battle. But not only was he unharmed, he had distinguished himself with great merit. He was in high spirits as he cupped his hands.

"Brothers! The Purple Smoke cultivators have escorted us this far. The northern cultivators are watching us like tigers. Please, return to the lake at once, before something terrible happens..."

# Chapter 916: The Viewing Pavilion Faction

At Zhouda's words, the group voiced their agreement. Zhouluo, however, flung back his black robes, his hand dropping to his sword hilt. He strode forward, quickening his pace by several steps, and was soon the first to arrive back at the lake. Beside him, Pang Yunqing turned to console him.

"People often misspeak... It probably wasn't aimed at anyone in particular."

In his distress, Zhoufang had said that besides Li Minggong, no brother cared for Li Chenghao. It was a veiled barb, clearly pointing at Li Chenghuai for leaving to cultivate, ignoring his family's affairs. How could Zhouluo not understand the implication?

It wasn't that Zhouluo had forgotten the grudges of the past; he simply chose not to speak of them. But for Zhoufang to bring it up now... Zhouluo held his tongue, seeing how overwhelmed by grief the other man was, but he was inwardly furious.
'His decision to venture out was approved by the family elders! It was settled. I knew the others felt it was unfair, and some were jealous, but I never thought even Big Brother would be so blind!'

'What did he mean by that? Is he saying my father didn't go to the Tangdao Mountain Range, that he doesn't care if Li Chenghao lives or dies? Father is in seclusion, breaking through to a new realm! When something like this happens so suddenly, what chance does he have to get involved?'

Pang Yunqing hailed from the long-esteemed Bamboo Creek Pang Clan. As a genius from the direct line of such an ancient family, her perspective was broad. She merely soothed him, "In this day and age, even the bonds between parents and children are weak. Once you're removed by three generations, how many can truly be called 'brothers'? What he said was improper. Don't take it to heart."

"Hah! It's not that simple... The Li Clan and the Pang Clan are different..."

Zhouluo just shook his head. After a moment's hesitation, he replied, "Actually, thinking about it now, only Fifth Brother is truly... likable. His aptitude made reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm a huge struggle. Nothing can happen to him..."

The two continued toward the mountain. Pang Yunqing shook her head with a smile.

"Very different, indeed. I'd only ever heard he was a henpecked wastrel. From your lips, he sounds 'likable'."

They soon landed at the foot of a mountain covered in gardenias. The two politely asked for someone to announce them. After passing respectfully through the woods, they were met by a brilliant golden radiance. A figure was seated on the main throne above.

The man was draped in scaled armor and wore black boots, leaning back slightly in his chair. His golden eyes were profound. A long halberd with a curved shaft rested across his knees, one hand stroking its length. His palm held a bright, shining light, as if he were nurturing the dharma artifact.

To his side stood Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan, whispering about something.

Zhouluo immediately bowed low, his voice respectful.

"Zhouluo pays his respects to the Daoist Master!"

Even Li Xizhi had to bow and address Li Ximing as 'Daoist Master'. What's more, Zhouluo and Zhouwei were merely clan brothers who hadn't been close since childhood. Naturally, he no longer dared to call him 'Big Brother'.

Zhouluo was brave enough to risk a glance upward, but Pang Yunqing at his side didn't dare lift her head at all. She simply bowed with him, waiting until the man on the throne relaxed his brow and spoke.

"Fourth Brother has returned. There's no need for such ceremony."

"We heard the Daoist Master has achieved his divine ability. I brought Yunqing to pay our respects to you, brother."

Zhouluo quickly replied. Zhouwei nodded, listening to the commotion below as the crowd surged forward. The first among them was Zhoufang, his face streaked with tears. He knelt on the mountainside and offered congratulations.

"Congratulations, Daoist Master! Felicitations, Daoist Master!"

Zhouwei relaxed his grip, and the halberd in his hands vanished. Seeing Zhoufang's state, he helped him up and spoke softly.

"Uncle Chenghao's children both perished in service to the clan, and now he too has fallen in battle. The matter of his lineage... the first branch will handle it internally. The clan will provide compensation. Fei Qing'yi deserted his post, causing Uncle's death. He colluded with the Demonic Buddhists and has already been sent to the Supreme Yang for judgment. The others involved have been sent to Tiger's Frontier... There will be news soon."

After these words, Zhoufang could only remain kneeling, weeping as he gave his thanks.

"My gratitude to the Daoist Master... The Fei Clan deserves death! And we have a blood feud with the Buddhists of Xiaoshi Mountain..."

At the mention of the northern Buddhists, a cold light flashed in Zhouwei's eyes. He said only, "That is a matter of course."

Zhoufang immediately kowtowed, weeping, then clasped his hands and departed to handle the funeral affairs. Zhouwei silently scanned the crowd. He saw expressions of unease and sorrow on all sides; no one dared to speak. Whether it was Chen Yang or An Xuanxin, everyone had their heads bowed in silence. Cui Jueyin, as usual, showed no expression. The other guest elders and protectors all looked worried.

Only Zhouda was grinding his teeth, seething with a rage so palpable it seemed to crackle. Sparks of Profound Thunder flashed in his eyes as he cursed under his breath, "Damned bald-heads!"

Zhouwei turned and sat back down, listening as Zhouluo spoke in a low voice.

"Daoist Master, your achievement would traditionally be marked with a banquet. But now..."

"There's no need."

It wasn't just that the cultivators of Jiangnan were in no mood for feasting; Zhouwei himself had no inclination for it. If he were the *first* to reach the Purple Mansion Realm, a banquet would be unavoidable. But the Li Clan was already an Immortal Clan of the Purple Mansion Realm; there was no need for excessive fanfare. Zhouwei's voice was grave.

"The north has fallen. The riverbank must be fortified. You are all to deploy personnel and keep a close watch on the north. As for the matter of Cold Cloud Peak..."

He paused, and Li Jiangqian immediately picked up.

"It has been arranged. The Manor Peak will be re-established, and we will dispatch personnel there as appropriate."

At this declaration, Zhouwei's gaze slowly lifted, sweeping across the faces of the An and Chen clan members. He raised a hand.

"You are dismissed."

The crowd dispersed in an orderly fashion, becoming a bustling stream of lights beyond the mountain. Li Jiangqian's expression turned cold. Li Que'wan murmured:

"The fall of the Tangdao Mountain Range was a huge blow, and Fei Qing'yi set a terrible precedent. It's inevitable they... feel uneasy. After all, if the Buddhist cultivators reach Sanxi, what's to stop another Fei Qing'yi from emerging?"

The Li Clan hadn't established a new Manor Peak in many years. In the past, such news would have been met with cheers. A new position meant a new piece of the pie to be claimed. This was precisely why the various families had been so eager to kick the Fei Clan while it was down, fanning the flames of their downfall.

But now the Fei Clan was gone, the Tangdao Mountain Range had fallen, and Baijiang Creek was in the hands of the Buddhist cultivators. The north bank had suddenly become a hot potato. While a full-scale invasion from the north was unlikely, skirmishes and friction were unavoidable. Hearing this, the gathered families and clan branches instantly deflated.

Li Jiangqian's expression was icy. "Exactly. They were the ones who coveted the northern posts so much they wanted to grind the Fei Clan to dust. And now, they're the ones too timid and hesitant to make a move. First, they're afraid of losing their lives in battle. Second... they're probably worried that they, or their descendants, will end up just like Fei Qing'yi."

"These vassal families have deep roots and many relatives, so they share that unease. As for the guest elders... many have no children, perhaps just a wife and a concubine here by the lake, a few relatives and assets. They have far less to worry about..."

"And this is the result of us *severely* punishing the Fei Clan. If we had only executed the ringleaders that day, they would all be celebrating right now, thinking they'd still have an escape route if they went north!"

Even Li Que'wan could see the situation clearly, let alone someone like Li Jiangqian, who always assumed the worst and had zero trust in his subordinates.
How could Zhouwei not know? His golden eyes were filled with gravity. He slowly turned a jade cup on the table.
"The An and Chen clans are not the Fei Clan. Even if the situation rots, even if someone defects to the north, we cannot touch them. The other families... they are insignificant. No need to worry."

Seeing him state the matter so bluntly, both Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan fell silent.

The Chen and An clans had been pillars of the family for generations, deeply intertwined with the four main branches. The Li Clan rarely married outsiders; most unions were within the lake's families. Of the old vassal families, only the Chen Clan, and later the An Clan, had endured, becoming inseparable. This was partly due to their own elders remaining alive, but the most important factor was their consistent production of geniuses and spiritually-gifted children, binding them firmly to the Li bloodline.

To put it bluntly, even if Chen Yang himself was converted by the Buddhist cultivators, what could the lake's leadership really do? His mother was Li Xicheng's sister, and Li Jianglong had to call him 'Uncle'! Li Jiangqian's own mother was an An. What could he say except remain silent?

As for Li Que'wan, faced with such a sensitive topic, she was even more inclined to protect herself. There were already whispers around the lake questioning her humble origins. On a normal day of secluded cultivation, it didn't matter, but saying even one word now would surely stir up gossip.

Zhouwei watched them in their silence, took a sip of tea, and said calmly, "As long as you understand, I don't need to say more. The Fei Clan could be punished severely. The remaining families can only be placated. The situation is not yet clear. We will wait and see the north's next move."

"You may go."

The two acknowledged and withdrew. Zhouwei rose, his expression darkening slightly. He took a single step into the Great Void and reappeared at the lake's edge, gazing into the distance.

He saw a waterfall of brilliant light on the horizon as dark energies dissipated. Streaks of golden light shot through the air. A sheet of Heavenly Light pressed in from the distance, passed through the array, and landed on the mountain. It brought with it a purple shadow, which resolved into a man in deep blue Daoist robes, carrying a long, glowing sword. He approached with a smile.

It was, unexpectedly, Li Ximing and Yehui, arriving together.

When Yehui saw Zhouwei, his eyes held a trace of shock. He clasped his hands.

"I have long heard of your great name!"

This was a meeting no one could have predicted. But with Buddhist cultivators on the shores of Baijiang Creek, even mortal enemies would instantly become sworn brothers. This was to say nothing of the ambiguous relationship between their two factions over the years, and the fact that Yehui had just done them a favor.

Zhouwei replied amicably, "Greetings, Senior Yehui."

Years ago, when Zhouwei had sent Guan Gongxiao fleeing, Yehui had been stony-faced. Now, showing no embarrassment whatsoever, he looked at Zhouwei with delight, offering rounds of congratulations. He sat down nearby and smiled. "You are a first-rate talent... I knew it long ago. Now that you've reached the Purple Mansion Realm, you are a powerful ally to us!"

Zhouwei offered a polite reply, then turned an questioning gaze to Li Ximing. Li Ximing immediately shook his head, his expression grim. "The decision has been made to abandon the Tangdao Mountain Range. It was only ever established with array disks; it can't even create a true restricted zone. And since they don't dare disturb the earth veins, it's unlikely to cause them much trouble."

Yehui sat to the side. When Li Ximing finished, he spoke in a somber tone. "We must discuss the current situation. I have connections in the north and have received some news. Let's talk."

"First: although the northern forces have not yet taken the Tangdao Mountain Range, the Grand Preceptor of Zhao State—Wei Xuanyin, the current master of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao—has been urgently recalled to the north to report to the Zhao Emperor. For his merit, he has been ennobled as King Han."

He paused, his eyes filled with deep meaning, before explaining. "This Wei Xuanyin represents the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao and cultivates the 'Veiled Yin'. He once shone brilliantly during the Great Liang dynasty and was inextricably linked with the 'Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect' of the Lesser Yang Dao. Together, they were known as the Viewing Pavilion faction. I've heard that the Demon Monarch of legend... came from that very Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect!"

Li Ximing's brow furrowed slightly, his pupils dilating. Hearing that name, a chill went down his spine.

'Viewing the Pavilion? *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*?!'

All Daoist traditions have an origin. The moment 'Viewing Pavilion' was mentioned, how could Li Ximing not recognize it! He had obtained the *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire* from Daoist Master Changxi, and it had benefited him immensely. This was the Daoist tradition of the Profound Peak Gate! Kui Qi himself had once confirmed it was a Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition!

This meant the Viewing Pavilion faction had to be of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition. And with a single thought, it connected all the way back to the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch of the Great Liang! Was the world-famous 'Sundering of the Lesser Yang' merely a conflict between Immortals and Demons? How much of it was driven by a brutal clash between Daoist traditions? The Immortal Yingze of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had sent down an Immortal decree, delivering it openly to the Liang Emperor, True Monarch Touba Xuantan. Then, he had captured the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch, Kuaili—the leader of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition's Viewing Pavilion faction—and split him into three before all the world's cultivators, so that all under heaven would remember!
At that time, what had been the attitude of Mount Luoxia?

The event had shaken the world. To this day, after countless Daoist traditions had been extinguished and countless secret arts silenced, the names of the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch Kuaili and the mainland's Supreme Yang Daoist tradition remained renowned, the latter proudly suppressing the western highlands year after year.

And now, Wei Xuanyin, the master of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition's Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, had struck, shattering the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in its moment of crisis... What was this if not the wheel of time turning, vengeance for an ancient grievance! And how urgent must the recall have been, to prevent him from finishing this cycle of revenge.

Li Ximing raised his eyebrows and looked at Zhouwei. The golden-eyed young man's expression was calm, but as their gazes met, a silent understanding passed between them.

Yehui, however, seemed unaffected, as if his previous words had been a mere aside. He continued gravely, "The one replacing him is a Buddhist General, Maha Fachang of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. He has reincarnated five times and has been ordered to take control of the Jiangbei region."

At this, Li Ximing was silent for a moment. Zhouwei spoke softly, "Defeating the southern Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is a major victory. The Buddhist cultivators would definitely want to claim it for themselves. Recalling Wei Xuanyin is no surprise. But... the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the Way of Compassion have always been at odds. How can they work together?"

"Their usual tactics," Yehui scoffed. "When have any of the Buddhist factions ever gotten along? Don't be fooled just because the Way of Emptiness acts subserviently before the Way of Great Desire. Given the chance, Zhelu would love to murder every last follower of the Way of Great Desire!"

He took a sip of tea. "Senior Lou Xing struck down Vija of the Way of Great Desire. We don't know if Vija perished, but Zhelu must have been overjoyed. Especially since that manifested Maha from the Sea of Desire, Liangli, cannot come south. Without supervision, Zhelu immediately became active, his ill intentions toward the Way of Great Desire growing... Don't think that just because Senior Lou Xing is a sword immortal, his mind is simple. His mind is crystal clear. That one sword strike hit them exactly where it hurts! Otherwise, why would the Way of Compassion so easily step in to mediate, forcing Wei Xuanyin to take action?"

Although Yehui himself walked a line between righteous and deviant, he clearly held great admiration for a grand sword immortal like Lou Xing, making no effort to hide the praise in his tone. He now let out a sneer but didn't elaborate, continuing, "We cultivators in Jiangbei have received news from the north. King Bolie of Qi, Gao Fu, will soon travel to Chengshui Marsh to visit Changyun. As for what they will discuss... that is harder to say."

Li Ximing sipped his tea. "Not the Lotus Temple? But the Gao family, from even further north..."

"The Lotus Temple?" Yehui sneered. "When all the Daoist traditions pushed north together, the Lotus Temple was quiet as a quail. They're lucky they aren't being punished, let alone having the ambition to push south. Maha Jinlian has been 'invited' to the Great Yang Mountain Dharma Assembly and has no chance of returning. Believe it or not, Fachang's position was originally meant for the Lotus Temple. Otherwise, why would the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, which has never had *any* involvement in southern affairs, suddenly have a Maha drop from the sky?"

"From what my friends in the north say, those high-level figures who stand on the pillars of heaven and earth have reached a rare consensus. Jiangbei *must* fall into northern hands, whether in name or in actual control. In this process, who drags their feet, who plays tricks, and who gives their all—everything is being clearly recorded. This is no longer a stage for everyone to act on their own!"



# Chapter 917: The Unfathomable Vacancy

His words, a blunt declaration from the heart, settled like a chill over the mountain, casting everyone into silence.

Li Zhouwei stared at him, his focus sharpening. His voice dropped to a low murmur.

"Senior, your sources are truly formidable."

As his words echoed through the mountains, Yehui lowered his head to sip his tea. Li Ximing, who had been silently clenching his cup, spoke up.

"Now that the various factions have made their moves, the North's true intentions are clear. If the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had known this from the start, they wouldn't have suffered such a catastrophic defeat..."

When he finished, Li Zhouwei stared intently at the Daoist Master. Yehui, however, let his lips part in a silent, mocking smile.

"Known from the start? Among the southern cultivators, some knew, some were ignorant, some were clinging to blind luck, and others had their suspicions. But in the end, they *all* went to the Tangdao Mountain Range. I won't mince words—to say that *any* of the southern Daoist traditions were completely in the dark? That is an impossibility!"

A smile bloomed on his face, as bright and warm as the afternoon sun. "Fellow Daoists," he reminded them, "the 'Hengzhu' is one of the most prominent positions in this world!"

Yehui was astonishingly audacious. His words were chilling. He dared to speak what few would dare to hear, all but stating outright that a True Monarch behind the Hengzhu Dao had watched the entire affair unfold, subtly manipulating events from the shadows.

The Six Scions of Chongming studied at Green Pine Temple, inheriting the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. From that single lineage came six True Monarchs. They established their Daoist tradition under the aegis of the closely-allied Moonlight Origin Mansion. Three of those Monarchs remain active to this day, leaving traces of their presence in the world. Taixu and Taiyu have fallen. The only one left—the most unremarkable of them all—is this True Monarch Taizhu.

The Li family had gathered substantial intelligence over the years and had maintained relations with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition for just as long. They had at least some understanding of every True Monarch. Yet, this True Monarch Taizhu alone had remained utterly silent, seemingly never intervening in any affair.

But as Yehui spoke, a tremor ran through Li Ximing. The words of Hengxing echoed in his ears: 'Lin Jianqi was willing to die for this. How many people in this world could do what Lin Jianqi did!'

'If the Hengzhu Dao might have foreseen this, then did Kui Qi also know? That Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery... what was his true reason for making a stand before the Tangdao Mountain Range!'

Li Ximing sighed internally. As if in sync, Yehui paused and let out a soft sigh of his own.

"If Changxiao truly dares to make a move, it won't just be a conflict with the Hengzhu dao. He'll be facing the entire Supreme Yang Daoist tradition of Jiangnan. His cultivation is profound, and the South may not be able to touch him for now... but there will be no end to the peripheral skirmishes."

"Baijiang Creek is as good as lost. I made this trip specifically to see you, fellow daoists, to say this: We will undoubtedly be in contact. I hope our two families can let bygones be bygones and offer each other mutual support."

"That is only natural!"

Li Ximing's expression was grave. He felt the need to parse the previous statement to prevent any misunderstanding and quickly replied:

"Whether a Fruition Attainment is prominent or obscure isn't for a single Daoist to decide. The Hengzhu Dao is powerful, true, but the world's Hengzhu spiritual items are exceedingly rare. It's not a simple matter, and not something one can inquire about lightly."

Yehui glanced at a fallen gardenia blossom on the table. "Naturally. I was merely speaking casually. After all, the might of a True Monarch is vast. How could a junior cultivator like me possibly define it with a single sentence? But your words remind me of a phrase I read when I first received my Daoist tradition."

"It said: [A prominent position is never lost; a vacant position is unfathomable. Lower cultivators toil diligently; their proof lies in the remainder]."

"If a Metallic Essence Fruition Attainment is manifest throughout the world, flourishing greatly, then there is assuredly a noble personage occupying that seat. If a Fruition Attainment grows dim and obscure, its Spiritual Qi severed, one cannot simply assume that the great being has fallen... because if they *wish* it, that Fruition Attainment *will* grow dim, and its Spiritual Qi *will* be severed."

"Lesser cultivators can only know which True Monarch *wants* to be known. They can only focus on their own cultivation... But for people like us? Without a Daoist tradition built over countless years, without the heart-to-heart transmission from master to disciple, without detailed records, without different branches of practice to compare... how could we ever compare the power of a Fruition Attainment across centuries and millennia? How could we possibly know which Fruition Attainment is *truly* manifest, which is flourishing in the world?"

Yehui let out a short grunt, his expression turning playful. A burst of sarcastic laughter erupted from him as he stood up and stepped into the Great Void, departing. Only his chilled words were left to echo across the mountain:

"What it means is... creatures like us, who can't even be considered 'lesser cultivators,' shouldn't even *dream* of seeking attainment!"

He dissolved into a stream of purple light and vanished, leaving Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei seated at the table. Their expressions were heavy, and for a long moment, neither spoke.

At length, Li Zhouwei sipped his tea. "It seems this Yehui... not only has the ambition to become a True Monarch, but also harbors deep resentment over his Daoist tradition's lack of standing..."

He was different from them. The Li family were known as imperial scions, and their Bright Yang Dao was renowned. Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing knew exactly who occupied the Fruition Attainment above them and what their circumstances were. Even if they couldn't predict the future, they had a fundamental understanding of their place.

Yehui's Daoist tradition, however, stemmed from a Grotto-Heaven of the Encompassing Profoundity. While his cultivation techniques were exquisite and his Spiritual Artifacts were impressive, he lacked a powerful background. He was ignorant of the high-stakes game being played over the Capital Guard. Even with opportunities that would make most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators green with envy, he still felt lost and anxious about his own path to attainment.

At this, Li Zhouwei began to understand Yehui's motives more clearly.

"If not for that ambition, why would he be struggling to hold his territory in Jiangbei? He's poured his heart and soul into the Capital immortals Dao's mountain gate, and it's immensely valuable, but the risks are mounting daily. Why not just lead the Capital immortals Dao far away from the eye of this storm?"

"It's simply his desire to ascend... He occupied Jiangbei early, hoping to carve out a foothold in the great game between North and South. Whether he contacts the South or the North, his goal is the same: to acquire more information about the grand scheme of things, and about his own path forward..."

Li Ximing had been listening, but he had, of course, already discerned this.

"Judging by his words, he's already cultivated extensive connections in the North... He has been scheming for a long time!"

"It's understandable. To put it bluntly, there isn't a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in the world who doesn't dream of the Purple Mansion Realm, and not a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who doesn't gaze up at the Fruition Attainment. The ladder to immortality is more tempting than any divine nectar; it's more alluring than anything."

Li Ximing sighed, and Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze.

The two said no more, a silent understanding passing between them. They stepped into the Great Void, drifting across the lake's surface to materialize within the inner array. The grand hall was dim, dominated by the precious pagoda standing in its center.

"You've been, then..."

Li Ximing asked in a low, uncertain voice. He studied him for a moment, his gaze hesitant. "The Azure Talisman...?"

"I have." A rare smile touched Li Zhouwei's lips. "I received the Talisman of Illuminating Sun and Moon!"

He gave a brief explanation of his Talisman Qi. Li Ximing stroked his beard, nodding in constant admiration. He let out a few hearty laughs and shook his head.

"It seems I won't have to risk my life so desperately in the future!"

At this, Li Zhouwei's expression turned serious. He bowed deeply. "You have endured much hardship these past few years, Elder."

Li Ximing waved him off, cutting him short with a smile. He immediately asked his most pressing question: "Your cultivation level...?"

Li Zhouwei smiled. "The talisman dissolved into an azure mist and elevated my cultivation base. My 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' divine ability, within the Shengyang Acupoint, reached perfection in an instant!"

Li Ximing stared at him, stunned. His expression was a bizarre mix of delight and awkwardness. "Does that mean... we are now at the same cultivation level?"

"Not so."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. The Daoist Master in the gold and white robes had a flash of realization, then clapped his hands in frustration. "You're right... My injuries are still severe. I can hardly be considered at your level."

Li Zhouwei looked slightly awkward. After a brief pause, he explained, "I wasn't referring to your dharma-body... It's just that after the Azure Talisman elevated my divine ability, there was power left over. It coalesced into a mass of pure cultivation, sealed within my Shengyang Acupoint. As soon as I begin cultivating my next divine ability, I can draw upon it at will..."

"Oh!" Li Ximing turned and sat, mulling this over for a moment before letting out a laugh. "It is an Azure Talisman, after all!"

But his head snapped back up, his eyes wide with alarm. "If it can elevate your cultivation, couldn't it instantly perfect all five of your divine abilities?! Have you already cultivated 'World's Radiance'? Have you truly thought this through?"

Li Ximing had heard Tinglan's explanation: World's Radiance was best used as the *final* divine ability. He himself had no hope of reaching that stage, but Li Zhouwei was another matter. At his question, the younger man shook his head with a smile.

"Naturally, I remember the advice..." Li Zhouwei replied, his tone turning serious. "I cultivated 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread,' but I left the azure mist in my Shengyang Acupoint untouched. This is precisely what I needed to discuss with you."

"First, by relying on the Talisman Qi, my 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' reached perfection instantly. Honing a divine ability is a subtle process, and one's Dao-Profundity is personal. It's hard to measure and not a major issue... But if I continue to draw on that power, I will undoubtedly condense my second divine ability almost immediately. That would be a different matter entirely. The moment I fought someone, it would be exposed for all to see."

His expression was grim. "I may be blessed by fate, but not to the terrifying extent of mastering a second divine ability in a few mere days. If anyone witnessed that, they would likely suspect *I* was the reincarnation of Emperor Wei! All factions are already watching me closely. If something so far beyond their comprehension were to happen, it would surely bring disaster down upon us."

Li Ximing nodded gravely as Li Zhouwei continued.

"Therefore, it is best for me to cultivate normally during this time. Once I have forged the second divine ability on my own, I can *then* use the Talisman Qi to bring it to rapid perfection. This is the wisest course, both to protect myself and to maximize the benefit of the Azure Talisman."

"Good. It is best you manage this yourself."

Li Ximing stroked his beard. "Since you've brought up the various factions' plans... this matter with Emperor Wei. Our family is becoming deeply entangled. What are your thoughts?"

Li Zhouwei seemed to have already pondered this. His gaze darkened as he replied softly, "The games played at that level... neither I nor our family are qualified to intervene. In the end, whether I follow the Dragon-kin's arrangement to reincarnate and cultivate again, or whether I am forced into a corner with no choice but to attempt a breakthrough... nothing is set in stone. As I see it, we have only one path: increase our strength and bide our time."

Li Ximing nodded in silent agreement. After a long pause, he retrieved an ink-black jade from his sleeve. "You are still using a mere dharma artifact; it simply won't do. The Viewing Pavilion Platform has been ready for some time. Take these spiritual materials and use them. It's high time you had a proper weapon."

Li Zhouwei had clearly considered this. "My dharma artifact was damaged in the fight with Helian Wumeng," he mused. "I've wanted to repair it for some time, but our 'lake' has always been lacking in the field of artifact refinement. We lack top-tier talent. I can only nourish it slowly myself. While Jiangzong of the clan has studied for many years and achieved some minor success, he is incapable of refining anything to the level of a spirit embryo. We will have to find an expert."

"That shouldn't be difficult. There's still no trace of Ning Wan, which makes borrowing Chu Minglian... inconvenient. However, whether it's Purple Smoke or Xiukui, borrowing an expert from them should be simple enough now."

Li Ximing chuckled, then suddenly recalled something. He produced a small jade vial containing pulsing wisps of pale, azure-white energy. He showed it to Li Zhouwei. "Look at this. It also came from that place."

There were five such vials in total. A few more remained in that hidden realm, but Li Zhouwei had been too focused on his cultivation to examine them. Now, he took one and assessed it.

"It looks like some kind of Spiritual Qi... related to the Supreme Yin. If we really want to identify it, I fear only the Chunyi Dao Gate would know."

Li Ximing shook his head, a headache coming on. "That's what I'm afraid of. I also refined a powerful pill of the Supreme Yin Dao! It would be an incredible treasure for the Chunyi Dao Gate. But whether we ask about this Spiritual Qi or mention the spirit pill... the Supreme Yin has vanished from the world. Once they realize how precious these items are, how do we explain them falling into our hands for no reason? It will only breed suspicion."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "Didn't we also receive word of a grotto-mansion from that realm? We can't rush this. Once you have recovered from your injuries, Elder, and the situation in the North stabilizes, you should make a trip. Find a good pretext, and take care of this."

Li Ximing understood. This was a sensitive time. It wasn't appropriate for Li Zhouwei to travel, and he certainly couldn't just vanish overseas to "discover" a grotto-mansion in a specific, remote strait. It fell to Li Ximing to make the journey quietly and retrieve the items.

"Alright!"

Li Ximing nodded discreetly and pulled a cauldron from his sleeve. It was a beautiful ivory and gold—the Treasure Elephant Cauldron. He smiled.

"I still owe Dingyang Zi that batch of Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder. This is the perfect time to refine it!"

The spiritual energies within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance were far richer, making it a better place for alchemy. Unfortunately, the Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder was a pill of Pit Water and suspended karma; its nature conflicted with the realm's aura of balance. He immediately took out the main ingredient for the powder.

Dingyang Zi had provided the materials. Opening the jade box revealed a palm-sized, blackish-blue scale that shimmered with a faint light: the primary ingredient, a Cangzhou Serpent Scale. All the supplementary herbs were also prepared. He could begin refinement immediately.

A single glance confirmed the spiritual materials were of exceptional quality, which set Li Ximing's mind to work.

'Dingyang Zi wants six pills from this cauldron. I can certainly manage that. But the extras... they'll also be Pit Water pills, which are practically useless to my family. Their application is too narrow, too specific to one Daoist tradition. Unless you have a very particular need, their value is low...'

After struggling for so many years, he valued every Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource. He examined the scale closely. Not only was its quality superb, but it also looked as if it had been harvested very recently.

'A scale isn't like other materials. This might not mean Dingyang Zi has a *stable* supply, but it very likely means he has more than just this single piece.' Li Ximing's mind raced, and a plan began to form.

'If this refinement is successful, I should pursue a long-term arrangement with him. If he needs this pill refined regularly, I can set aside the extra pills from each batch. Once I've saved up six... that's the equivalent of a full Cangzhou Serpent Scale for myself! *That* is no longer useless. That is a genuine, high-grade spiritual resource I can trade with other cultivators!'

Fired up by the thought, he didn't hesitate for a second. He immediately began the refinement. Flames surged as the True Fire roared to life, casting shifting, brilliant light throughout the dim hall.

Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, excused himself from the hall. His expression was heavy.

'It is time,' he thought, 'to visit the Demon Cave...'

# Chapter 918: Xuandan Supreme Yin

The Eastern Sea, Chunyi Dao Gate.

A streak of white light sped in from over the sea, scattering a gentle, diffuse glow of Supreme Yin. The young Daoist Master within it was the very picture of elegance, his white robes patterned with waves and crescent moons, giving him an otherworldly, dashing air.

Yet his expression was grim, his face tight with suppressed emotion. He bore no obvious wounds, but the light of his divine ability was dim, a clear sign he had just withdrawn from a major battle.

This was none other than Daoist Master Che Hong, who had gone to reinforce the Tangdao Mountain Range.

Daoist Master Che Hong was the latest of the Chunyi Dao Gate's generation to ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm. His success marked a new pinnacle for the sect, its first time boasting four Purple Mansion Realm masters in nearly three hundred years. He was a first-rate genius, sharp and perceptive; how could he possibly fail to grasp the current situation?

His Chunyi Dao Gate claimed to possess the Supreme Yin legacy, yet it also called itself part of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. The six lineages of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in Jiangnan had never truly acknowledged this claim. For many years, they had actively marginalized the Chunyi Dao Gate. This was true even though Ancestor Chunyi, Jiequn, had clearly originated from the Green Pine Temple. Back then, whenever anyone asked, the people of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition would either fall silent or dismiss it as a mere rumor.

After all, Ancestor Jiequn's Daoist name didn't align with their conventions, and he had never reached the level of a True Monarch. The cultivators of the Chunyi Dao Gate were generally modest and rarely argued the point publicly, but it was impossible not to harbor some resentment.

In recent years, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's stance had gradually softened. As the Chunyi Dao Gate reached the peak of its power, and when he, Che Hong, had ascended to the Purple Smoke Blessed Land, Tinglan herself had called him a fellow disciple. This had been an immense vindication. Outwardly, Che Hong had claimed it didn't matter, all while pouring his full effort into assisting them. Though his face was grim from the battle, he couldn't help but feel a savage satisfaction.

'Look at how you treated our gate back then. And look at how we repay you now. *This* is the magnanimity of the true Supreme Yang lineage! Every time you utter the words "fellow disciple," you are slapping your own faces—the same faces that once refused to acknowledge us, the same faces that belittled our elders!'

But the satisfaction was fleeting. The battle was over, and the fall of Kui Qi weighed heavily on Che Hong's heart, leaving him at a loss for words. Worse, while *he* had given his all in the battle at Tangdao Mountain, the Chunyi Dao Gate as a whole had not. They had merely contributed what was required to fulfill their obligation to the righteous path.

'If the Old Daoist Master doesn't act, the situation at Tangdao Mountain is hopeless. But he is old, relying on a few secret Supreme Yin methods just to preserve his life... How could we ask him to go, asking our Chunyi Dao Gate to ignore the threats from Crimson reef and Jingyi...?'

His thoughts were heavy as he flew, soon reaching the edge of the mountain. He saw a Daoist Master riding the wind toward him, apparently having waited for some time. A hopeful look crossed the man's face, and he flew up with a smile.

"Brother Xi Chang!"

"Ah, Senior Ji An! What a rare visitor."

One called him "brother," the other "senior," revealing the difference in their status and age. Che Hong gave a slight bow, and the two headed into the mountain together. They settled at a table to catch up. After about half a quarter-hour, Ji An shook his head.

"This time... I've come from the Northern Sea specifically to ask about finding a new place to settle!"

Che Hong's expression changed. "What brought this on?"

"Why such desperation? Senior, your conduct has always been righteous, and you are well-known among those in the Purple Mansion Realm. How could those Five Gates dare to move against you?"

Ji An silently shook his head. The Daoist Master looked quite old but put on no airs. "It's not entirely their doing."

"The Five Gates of Gongdu have an upright foundation. I don't provoke them, and they have no reason to bother with me. Brother, you may not know, but this is about something else entirely."

"In Cangzhou, the Pit Water is now unbound, flooding all four territories. My cultivation is in Li Fire; it's completely unsuitable. I thought I could endure it day by day, but it only gets worse. A few days ago, even the [Six Manifestations Li Fire] on my Bei'er Mountain nearly had its Spiritual Qi extinguished. If not for the formation's spiritual flame, Bei'er Mountain would have reverted to a Pit Water domain!"

A cold light flashed in Che Hong's eyes. He lowered his brows. "Then, Senior's intention is?"

Ji An said, "When I was young, I knew an elder who cultivated Pit Water. I've given the mountain to his descendants and am preparing to move here, to the Eastern Sea."

Che Hong understood. Ji An, however, continued with sudden enthusiasm.

"I was passing through the Hetian Sea just as the Great Yang Mountain Dharma Assembly was ending. I ran into a friend who told me some good news he'd heard in a report from the Way of Great Desire. Traces of the 'Great Parting Scripture' have been found in the Moongaze Marsh! It's connected to a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan."

"Mm..."

Che Hong replied nonchalantly, taking a sip of tea.

"I know. It's not just the 'Great Parting Scripture.' There's also 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' and even a Whole Pill Daoist tradition. I hear none of them are of low quality."

"What?!"

Ji An leaned forward, his voice urgent.

"I heard it was an Immortal Clan that produced two Purple Mansion Realm masters in a single century! And based on the timing, they must have been cultivating these arts *before* their breakthroughs. Every one of those items is an incredible rarity. This... this... they must have found a hidden Daoist treasury!"

Che Hong remained calm, pouring more tea.

"'Bright Yang' and 'Li Fire'... You're not the first person to take notice. How do you think they acquired those things? That family has a genius blessed by the fate of Bright Yang... a Bright Yang Mandate!"

As he said this, a faint smile touched his lips.

"As for this 'friend' of yours... how many Buddhist cultivators can you really trust? Be careful, Senior."

Ji An nodded as if in sudden understanding, but the hand resting on his cup remained perfectly relaxed. He was clearly unsurprised, and had likely come specifically to probe for this information. Che Hong knew this as well and shook his head.

"You cultivate Li Fire, so it makes sense that you'd want to get close and build a relationship. There could be benefits... but there are also risks."

Before he could finish, a jade pendant at his waist flashed. Che Hong's expression shifted. "Excuse me." He transformed into a ray of Supreme Yin light and ascended, passing through a great, snow-swirling formation. He landed by a jade pool where the moonlight cast a silvery-white sheen on the rippling water. Two people were seated by the pool, with a third standing in attendance.

The man in the host's seat, dressed in moon-white Daoist robes, was his own elder, Daoist Master Fuxuan. The person in the guest's seat, clad in green robes, had azure eyes and a tranquil, self-possessed air. His cultivation was clearly profound. Che Hong's eyes lit up.

'The one named Chi is here!'

The man before him was none other than the Great Daoist Master from the Azure Pond, Chi Buzi!

Standing respectfully to the side was the elderly man, Xi, who had accompanied him on the mission. His face was pale and he looked exhausted, but his expression held both joy and relief.

Ever since Chi Buzi had taken the Chunyi Dao Gate's people to the Eastern Sea, Daoist Master Fuxuan had not gone a single day without worrying. He had mentioned it to Che Hong several times. Seeing Chi Buzi return so soon, Che Hong was overjoyed and his tone became respectful.

"So it is the Great Daoist Master."

No one mentioned the events at Tangdao Mountain. Chi Buzi, for his part, seemed completely unbothered. He sat there beaming and shook his head.

"Since my Daoist friend is here, I won't waste words. Please retrieve those two treasures of mine."

The Chunyi Dao Gate had no intention of coveting his Spiritual Artifacts. They were quickly retrieved and placed on a tray held by Che Hong, who stood to the side. Chi Buzi gave them a cursory glance and nodded silently.

Both Purple Mansion Realm masters kept their eyes locked on him. It was obvious: unless Chi Buzi produced something worthwhile, the Chunyi Dao Gate would not be returning his items so easily.

Chi Buzi, however, said leisurely, "I should have been back much sooner, but... just as I was leaving, the place was discovered by a Merciful One!"

At these words, both men tensed. Daoist Master Fuxuan frowned immediately, suspecting an excuse. Che Hong glanced at the elderly attendant, who wore a look of profound, shared experience. Only then did Chi Buzi smile.

"I won't say more for now. I'll let my Daoist friend see for himself!"

He gave his sleeve a gentle shake, and a stone box appeared in his hand.

This box was carved from [Baizhi Greenstone], a spiritual material rarely seen since ancient times. It was a container used specifically for storing extremely high-quality Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items!

Fuxuan nodded slightly at the sight, but Che Hong lowered his gaze, a seed of disappointment already growing in his heart.

If there was one thing the Chunyi Dao Gate craved above all else, it was undoubtedly the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance.

The Chunyi Dao Gate's current prosperity was inextricably linked to the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance. This Spiritual Qi had long since vanished from the world and could only be found in ancient ruins or hidden caches. Little of it had ever fallen into the hands of the Chunyi Dao Gate, and in recent years, as various Mystic Realms closed, the amount circulating among Purple Mansion Realm masters had dwindled, becoming ever more precious.

Unfortunately, the very completeness of the Chunyi Dao Gate's Daoist tradition meant it required an immense amount of [Supreme Yin Moon Radiance]. A single Great Daoist Master needed at least four portions. While the sect had inferior techniques that could, with difficulty, form a divine ability, the result was inevitably a step below.

Within their Daoist tradition, only the Old Daoist Master Yuanshang had cultivated using the legacy's remaining Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, and even he had used only a single portion. Fuxuan, standing before him, had also used one portion he had acquired by chance, but it was only enough to form his second divine ability. The others had not been so fortunate.

By the time it came to Che Hong and his grandfather, Daoist Master Guanghou, there was no more of this Spiritual Qi left in the Daoist tradition. After long deliberation, they had Daoist Master Guanghou cultivate 'Water Mansion'. Che Hong not only used the inferior cultivation method but had never even *seen* [Supreme Yin Moon Radiance]. To speak of using it for mere Qi Refining was the height of luxury; it seemed more fitting to use it for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm.

While the box was of high quality, if the item inside were Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, it would surely be stored in a jade vial, not a stone box.

But just as he was lost in his disappointment, Chi Buzi placed a hand on the jade box and gently released a wisp of its aura.

*Clang!*

Daoist Master Che Hong felt a frigid aura erupt skyward. The white-robed Daoist Master in front of him shot to his feet, his breathing suddenly ragged. With a soft *thud*, one of Fuxuan's hands slammed down on the jade table, landing just a finger's width from the box.

He snapped his head up, his expression one of utmost gravity. His eyes, fixed on Chi Buzi, swam with a wild, bewildered ecstasy, as if he might lunge forward at any second.

"Daoist Friend Buzi..."

His voice was raw, his eyes bloodshot.

"May I... take a closer look?"

Fuxuan had practiced the sword for many years, and his hands were impeccably maintained, appearing long and fine in the swirling, snowy light. Yet these same hands—which had slain countless demons and Buddhist cultivators without a tremor—were now visibly trembling on the tabletop, fighting the urge to snatch the jade box.

The green-eyed man sitting opposite him showed no surprise. He remained perfectly at ease, not even twitching a finger, and simply smiled.

"Calm yourself, Daoist friend."

It all happened in a flash. Only now did Che Hong stare blankly at the box. The aura had been so faint, so fleeting, that clearly only the man before him had been able to sense it.

*Clang!*

Fuxuan let out a long breath. His other hand, which had drifted to the Spiritual Sword at his waist, slowly relaxed. He unfastened the sword and set it quietly to the side, though his eyes never left the jade box. "A matter of great importance. I lost my composure."

Even though Chi Buzi made no move to stop him, and the great treasure was within arm's reach—a treasure he could easily use as leverage to keep the two Spiritual Artifacts—Fuxuan merely settled back into his seat. He simply couldn't bear to close his eyes.

And Chi Buzi, who appeared to have everything under control, was actually reeling in shock.

'[Moon Laurel Golden Branch]... so it's *this* powerful a spiritual object!'

After all, in that grotto-heaven, they used them by the basketful. They weren't even guarded. A random servant girl would gather a basket and deliver them to the various palaces. Chi Buzi found it difficult to reconcile that sight with Fuxuan's intense reaction. He could only stroke his beard and smile.

"It seems my Daoist friend recognizes this item. To be frank, in that entire grotto-heaven, this was the only thing truly worthy of being called a great treasure!"

Fuxuan sighed deeply, his gaze filled with an inconsolable melancholy.

"Even if that grotto-heaven wasn't left by the Ancestor, it must have belonged to a high-level cultivator of the ancient Supreme Yin Dao. This item... this item has been extinct for ages. 'Great treasure' doesn't even begin to describe it!"

"Oh...?"

Chi Buzi's expression turned inquisitive. He flicked a finger, manifesting a divine ability. The lid of the stone box slowly turned transparent, revealing a single Moon Laurel branch lying within. It was dotted with small white flowers and glowed with a hazy halo. The cut end of the branch had fine, spiraling golden threads, and it radiated a bone-deep chill.

Fuxuan's entire being was focused on the item. He was perfectly accommodating, his eyes filled with deep yearning as he whispered:

"This is the [Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch]. It is unequivocally an artifact of ancient times... rarer even than Supreme Yin Moon Radiance."

As this concerned his Daoist tradition, he dared not say more. Chi Buzi nodded quietly, muttering the name to himself several times, inwardly stunned. He did not, however, push the jade box across the table. Fuxuan understood immediately and turned his head.

"Chang'er."

He had actually used Che Hong's intimate name, revealing his desperation. Che Hong didn't dare hesitate, holding out the two Spiritual Artifacts toward Chi Buzi.

Seeing the man shake his head, Fuxuan was not surprised. "This is...?"

Chi Buzi said softly, "This is what I mentioned earlier. A Merciful One saw it."

Fuxuan's expression darkened instantly. This was a major complication, and murderous intent flashed in his eyes. Fortunately, Chi Buzi continued.

"Luckily, that thing's cultivation wasn't high. I've already... secretly killed it."

"Good!"

For a Great Daoist Master like Chi Buzi, "killed" certainly didn't mean something as simple as sending him back to the Buddhist Land. Fuxuan let out a visible sigh of relief. "As expected of you, Daoist friend. Your methods are reassuring."

The two clearly had a personal relationship, perhaps having known each other in their youth. Chi Buzi's expression grew serious.

"The only problem is, the other party belonged to the Way of Compassion. I cannot afford to get entangled with them right now."

He felt at his waist and produced a small golden casket. Something inside rattled, perhaps fragments of a Treasured Artifact. Fuxuan took it without hesitation.

"This item will subtly lead the Way of Compassion to divine that it was my Chunyi Dao Gate who did the killing. The blame will not fall on you, Daoist friend."

Chi Buzi nodded with a smile.

Both men understood. Chi Buzi wasn't concerned about this minor grudge. This was a way to subtly shift the discovery of the grotto-heaven onto the Chunyi Dao Gate. If anything was discovered later, and conflict arose, Chi Buzi would not be left unable to defend himself.

But Chi Buzi's plans went further; he had his own agenda.

'I need to make an offering, but I can't be too obvious. Who goes around killing Merciful Ones repeatedly for no reason? I've already killed so many. If there isn't some clear benefit, it's bound to arouse suspicion!'

From his perspective, this was just a convenient, justifiable opportunity to kill another Merciful One. He had specifically used this window of time not only to resolve his cultivation method issue but also to seize the chance to make another offering!

He still didn't relent, his hand resting firmly on the jade box. His eyes were grave as he finally revealed his true purpose, his voice firm and resolute.

"I wish to cultivate a different Dao, to find a new path for my reincarnation. For this, I need the Chunyi Dao Gate... to introduce me to Daoist Master Pu Yu of Penglai!"



# Chapter 919, The Method of Seeking the Dao

Fuxuan fell silent at these words, a troubled expression on his face. He lifted his cup, only to realize he hadn't even poured any tea in his haste. Daoist Master Che Hong, standing to the side, stepped in to smooth things over.

"I wonder where the Great Daoist Master heard this news? Penglai has been sealed for many years, and we've had no word from them. We haven't seen any trace of Daoist Master Pu Yu, and our Chunyi Dao Gate has little contact with Penglai..."

Chi Buzi shook his head. He wouldn't have asked unless he was certain. "Since Senior Yuanshang is still present," he said softly, "there must be a way."

Hearing this, Fuxuan finally broke his silence. "I don't know how you received this information, fellow Daoist, but the matter of rebuilding one's cultivation is of grave importance. Back then, even when Senior Yuanwu personally went to seek help from Penglai, Daoist Master Pu Yu still refused to act. What chance do you have? It's best not to hold out too much hope."

He paused, his gaze hardening as he looked at the green-eyed man before him. "Furthermore, achieving a divine ability involves registering one's name in the Underworld and being subject to changes in the Nine Nethers. Even extending the life of someone who died violently requires an immense price. Without a specialized Daoist tradition, who could possibly accomplish it? Currently, the paths of the 'Upper Shaman' and the 'Merging Owl' have not returned to their positions, and souls cannot manifest. I don't need to elaborate on how difficult this matter is..."

Chi Buzi just smiled and shook his head. "Fellow Daoist, you are mistaken. Who can know the future? Who knows if those two paths will return?"

He raised an eyebrow, a relaxed expression crossing his features.

"Before Liang fell and Zhao rose, before Cultivation Transcendence returned, who cared about formation disks? What was the speed of traversing the Great Void then, and what is it now? Before the Shangqing Reformation, before Golden Oneness proved the Dao, who could have imagined that Geng-Dui would shift once, let alone a second time? What about fifty or a hundred years from now?"

Chi Buzi's ambition was enormous! He was determined to become a True Monarch, to erase his name from all records, and to have the world follow the path _he_ blazed. Only then would this life be complete! As he mentioned the examples of Cultivation Transcendence and Taiyuan proving the Dao, he struggled to suppress the wild, surging ambition stirring within him!

'In a hundred years, there must be a celestial phenomenon! A borrowed manor, an intercalated feminine, and an escape from the Pristine Pool!'

He smiled. "I cultivate Pristine Water, not Metal Virtue. I am myself, and Yuanwu is Yuanwu. Fellow Daoist, just grant me a meeting. Whether I succeed or fail, or what I ask, I will not involve you."

Fuxuan gave him a deep look, inwardly disagreeing. He silently shook his head,

'Whether those two paths return isn't for anyone to say. After all these years, don't you think the Underworld wants them to return? It's just that the time isn't right, and the candidate isn't right!'

Outwardly, however, he nodded slowly.

"Very well. I will have news within three months. If I fail, consider my Daoist tradition to owe you a favor."

Hearing this, Chi Buzi readily released his leverage. Che Hong immediately stepped forward, presenting the miniature cauldron and the strand of jet-black beads. These two treasures, long separated from their master, pulsed with light, seeming extremely agitated.

Chi Buzi took his Rain-Watching Treasure Cauldron and Motang beads from Che Hong. Fuxuan, meanwhile, was overcome with emotion as he picked up the jade box, his hands trembling slightly.

"Good... good..."

Chi Buzi simply watched him with a smile.

"I will wait nearby. I shall return in three months."

With that, he gave a light flick of his sleeve, transformed into a streak of light, passed through the formation, and vanished into the Great Void.

The moment Chi Buzi left, Fuxuan lost his composure. He shot up from his seat, clutching the jade box tightly to his chest, and strode into his cave-abode. "Guard the entrance!" he ordered in a low voice. "And get a clear account!"

Che Hong immediately took a serious stance at the entrance, beginning to ask detailed questions about the situation within the secret realm Chi Buzi had been in. Fuxuan hurried deep into the cave, soon reaching its innermost chamber, where he found a mirror shimmering with silver light.

It was the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror!

The silver light scattered onto the ground, unexpectedly forming a calm, ripple-free, moon-white illusion. It was a space of pure silver, barely ten paces across—smaller than the courtyard of a wealthy family—containing only a single table and chair.

An old man stood by the table, staring quietly at the chessboard upon it. Hearing the commotion, he looked up, revealing silver-white eyes, and nodded.

"Lingjiao, you've come."

Daoist Master Fuxuan immediately bowed.

The world knew him as Fuxuan, a man of exceptional talent who had revitalized the Chunyi Dao Gate. But very, very few knew that this Daoist Master, who presided over the Chunyi Dao Gate, was not born with the surname Xi. After he entered the sect, it was Daoist Master Yuanshang who had personally bestowed upon him the name Xi Lingjiao.

Only in front of this old man did Fuxuan need no pretense. His face lit up with joy as he hurriedly placed the jade box on the table and bowed.

"Congratulations, Master!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang's expression turned serious. With a light flick of his finger, he popped open the lid of the jade box, revealing a noble, mysterious spiritual object within. He froze.

The old man's eyes reddened, and his voice grew hoarse.

"A Xuandan Supreme Yin spiritual object!"

"Born from the waters of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, grown in the lands of the Supreme Yin... the disaster-averting, calamity-dispelling Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch! Where did this come from?"

With tears in his eyes, Daoist Master Fuxuan nodded silently. He watched as the old man seemed to deflate, all strength leaving him as he sank into his chair. Daoist Master Fuxuan choked back a sob.

"We found it. It was obtained by that Chi Buzi!"

Hearing this, Daoist Master Yuanshang lowered his gaze and let out a desolate sigh.

"What does it matter if it's found? What year is it now? This body of mine... what use is it, other than barely surviving beneath the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror?"

He slowly raised a hand and rested it on the box, his expression growing distant. With a twitch of his finger, the box snapped shut, hiding the scattered white blossoms and golden laurel branch from view. The old man's emotions gradually settled, his calm demeanor returning.

Daoist Master Fuxuan pleaded in a low voice,

"Master... please, at least try!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang silently shook his head.

"This 'Reflecting Profound Radiance' is sixteen paces from one end to the other, and I cannot take a single step outside it. I have been languishing here for fifty-six years. I no longer have any desire to break through to the True Monarch realm."

"This item... can only be left for you."

Fuxuan frowned immediately, but Daoist Master Yuanshang's expression was grave. He began to speak,

"The Patriarch left a decree. He stated that the Supreme Yin is sealed and its spiritual objects are cut off. For us descendants, he left behind the 'Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity' to help attain the True Monarch realm. The 'Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair' that the Patriarch used back then failed... but in truth, two remain."

"What!"

Fuxuan was stunned, the word escaping him before he could stop it.

He knew of the "Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity."

The Supreme Yin was a Fruition Attainment of the highest, noblest order. Since it had vanished from the world, seeking to attain it was fraught with difficulty; almost no one even tried anymore. But the foundation of the Chunyi Dao Gate's confidence lay in this secret art from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition!

This was an exceptionally profound secret art. It was designed to create a sliver of hope in seeking an Auxiliary Position. By using a spiritual object of extremely high status—one connected to an Auxiliary Position—as a buff, one could charge the True Monarch realm and resonate with the secret art, hoping for a better outcome.

And the Chunyi Dao Gate's Patriarch, Jiequn, had a fortuitous encounter back then, obtaining one of those 'Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair' items, which he used for his breakthrough!

At this revelation, Fuxuan was naturally bewildered, dense confusion flooding his mind.

"Then, Master, why did you...!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang said bleakly,

"You have not read the secret art, so you do not know. According to its calculations, although the path of the Supreme Yin is hidden, one Auxiliary Position was destined to re-emerge from obscurity, able to accommodate a future cultivator. Your Grandmaster once discussed this with me. It's possible some Immortal, with their heaven-shaking divine ability, left a contingency in place, using a bit of Profound Light or a Dharma Treasure to anchor this specific Auxiliary Position..."

Fuxuan listened, finding it all plausible. But then he saw a look of bitter resentment flash across the old man's face.

"But back then, no matter how the Patriarch calculated, he could not determine _which_ Auxiliary Position it was! It's obvious! Some True Monarch must have used their own divine ability to blind all senses, making it undetectable by gods or ghosts!"

"We can only test it!"

He shook his head in anguish.

"Why did the Patriarch fail? In my view, it's because the Auxiliary Position corresponding to the 'Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair' was a dead end!"

"We stand too low to see clearly. We are like mayflies gazing at the sun and moon, thinking we see an opportunity for enlightenment. But looking down from the perspective of those mighty figures, this 'opportunity' might be a critical point on the great chessboard, one that cannot be revealed to others!"

Understanding dawned on Fuxuan. His expression grew somber as he grasped the truth,

"So the remaining two... Master, you kept them hidden on the mountain, never using them! And now, this Xuandan Supreme Yin spiritual object is the one we can _truly_ test!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang sighed.

"Exactly..."

He placed his hand over the jade box on the table.

"It seems our Chunyi Daoist tradition is destined to flourish. You are a genius seen once in a century, and more remarkably, you have walked step-by-step to this day despite the persecution of various houses, becoming capable of sheltering our descendants. Later, Guanghou appeared, and I was grateful to have a mainstay. I never expected Che Hong to be even more remarkable. With the two of you... it need not be wasted on me."

Daoist Master Fuxuan sighed in silence. Yuanshang, in contrast, was overcome with joy. His focus returned to the jade box, and he cradled it, his heart full.

"The quality of this Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch is superb! It likely dates back to the Wei era. I heard that the Lady of the World's Navel obtained a branch before she achieved the Dao, refining it into a talisman to avert disaster and reduce karma. Although we cannot use it for that, it shows just how precious this item is!"

"Indeed."

Fuxuan only said quietly,

"I've sent Che Hong to make detailed inquiries, to find out which house that cave-abode belonged to..."

As he spoke, Daoist Master Yuanshang's movements paused minutely. His expression, however, remained soft and natural as he said in a nearly inaudible voice,

"There's no need to ask."

Daoist Master Fuxuan raised an eyebrow slightly, then immediately lowered his head.

"Yes."

The cave-abode fell silent for a moment. Daoist Master Yuanshang shook his head.

"We must still follow through on our promise to Chi Buzi. I will write a letter and ask Pu Yu his intentions. Back then, Yuansu and Zimu knew him best, but he... he doesn't get attached. No one would dare claim to be his close friend. Whether he comes depends as much on my face as it does on Chi Buzi's."

Fuxuan bowed and quickly retreated, leaving the old Daoist Master sitting alone in the silver light. He stared at the jade box, his expression dark and brooding, silent for a long, long time.

'Who sent this? The one from Pristine Water? Likely not... That one's thoughts run deep, and he ignores worldly affairs. Besides Suiguan, who could possibly represent him?!'

...

The Eastern Sea.

Chi Buzi sped onward, traveling day and night. He journeyed out from the Eastern Sea, but this time, instead of heading beyond the Peacock Sea, he followed the path along the World's Navel, descending in a remote, desolate region.

Once deep underground, he found an area devoid of spiritual energy, carved out a simple cave-abode, and sat down cross-legged to review his plans.

'Yuanshang is indeed still alive... Chi Wei was right. That "Reflecting Profound Radiance" can stabilize the six senses, gather essence, avoid detection, and hide from tribulations. That old man must be the longest-lived of them all. Even if he can't leave that spot, he must have at least ten years left...'

His gaze was calm as he calculated inwardly.

'Does the Underworld know? The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror is masterless, and it's not Jiequn using it; how could they be fooled? I suspect they think he can succeed in seeking gold and have already negotiated with him. The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror can't protect him for much longer anyway, so they might as well grant him this one favor.'

As for the Penglai matter, Chi Buzi hadn't brought it up on a whim. He didn't just want to see Pu Yu; he also wanted to visit Penglai's Quhai Sect!

'According to my plan, if I have to give up the Pristine Water path, I must prepare for the next life. Seeing Pu Yu is essential, whether it succeeds or not... it's a good thing. If I can enter the Penglai grotto-heaven, that would be even better!'

There was a simple reason, Penglai was an extremely special place.

'Penglai is an Immortal Lord Daoist tradition, the heritage of Immortal Lord Chufu. It is an immortal legacy, inviolable and sacrosanct. I've also heard that this Immortal Lord Chufu possessed great merit, and all other paths respect him deeply. His status is entirely different...'

And the Penglai grotto-heaven was one of the few places in the current world confirmed to be suppressed by an Immortal Artifact!

Chi Buzi wasn't certain, but he was eighty or ninety percent sure—if he could just visit the Penglai grotto-heaven once, the karmic threads of destiny entangled around him would become a hundred times more complex, undergoing a qualitative leap.

'Even if I don't remember any of it afterward, it will still make the profound mysteries surrounding me harder to divine... It will reduce the risk. Even a little help is good.'

Chi Buzi had planned for the worst-case scenario from the very beginning. It was entirely possible that the injured Pristine Water would ignore him completely and simply flee to the Pristine Speech Heaven. But for him, Chi Buzi, he only had one life. He could not be too paranoid.

Beyond this, a greater worry was brewing in his heart.

'As the deadline approaches, Immortal Merit is hard to come by. The day I can successfully exchange for what I need... feels further and further away...'

Chi Buzi had spent all his previous Immortal Merit to receive guidance from the Daoist tradition. To be honest, the value of that guidance was worlds apart from the meager effort of a few fights and a bit of scheming; he had never regretted it. But the ultimate constraint was time.

What's more, as he killed Demons and, on several occasions, the Merciful One, the risk of this affair kept rising, making his heart clench,

'It would be best if I can exchange for the cultivation method this time... If I can't, the future will be too dangerous... But even if I get the cultivation method, that method for seeking gold is a hundred, a thousand times more valuable. How difficult will _that_ be to obtain?'

He could only close his eyes and pray silently.

"This junior cultivator, Chi Buzi, respectfully beseeches the Supreme Yin..."

As streaks of white light flashed before his eyes, the feeling of weightlessness returned. Chi Buzi took an ethereal step, and his vision cleared. He was back in the courtyard.

Even though he had experienced this more than once, Chi Buzi still felt a sense of incomprehensible awe. The higher his cultivation, the more he understood just how terrifying this power was, which could snatch him from thousands of miles away.

The four white jade lamp pedestals reappeared before him. The courtyard was unchangingly bright and pure, seemingly as eternal as the grotto-heaven itself. Chi Buzi paused, realizing the courtyard was empty.

'That lazy donkey is slacking off again!'

Chi Buzi was much more familiar with things now. He knew that aside from the first time—when the donkey was new to the job and waited in advance—it had almost never been on time since. He stepped out of the central round pool and waited quietly to the side.

Only a moment passed before the courtyard gate creaked open. A young immortal official with pale turquoise eyes pushed his way in, bustling with excitement.

"Ayo! Great Daoist Master Chi has arrived!"




# Chapter 920: The Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul

Cold snow fell thick and fast. A man in white robes leaned against a jade platform, a circular screen of light flickering before him. It revealed a vision that pierced heaven and earth from within the Great Void. Myriad marvels manifested within, all perfectly reflected by the screen, leaving nothing hidden.

Streams of golden radiance descended from the sky, coiling around his body. They continuously converged and merged, forming layer upon layer of brilliant light.

Lu Jiangxian gently extended his hand. A single point of incomparably brilliant gold emerged from his palm, shifting and changing unpredictably.

'The Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence!'

The Immortal Mirror's power had already reached a bottleneck. Even with Li Zhouwei achieving his divine ability, the feedback and subsequent enhancement were not significant. It merely made the world within the mirror feel more spacious, flickering with profound light. The most dramatic reaction, however, came from the Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence right in front of him!

This Bright Yang Metallic Essence glittered, pulsing with inexhaustible energy. As if triggered by something, it surged and climbed, but it was suppressed by the world within the mirror. Unable to break free, it could only release its radiance in futility.

'More than ninety percent of this Bright Yang Metallic Essence was left behind by Li Qianyuan...'

Lu Jiangxian was no longer the same person he was when he first obtained this item. His expression was heavy; he understood the implications of this Metallic Essence.

'If the Metallic Essence in the Sun Seeker Ring belonged to Li Qianyuan, then it is absolutely, one hundred percent, one of Emperor Wei's contingency plans!'

The fact that this item had fallen into his hands, and that the current Li family was even considered part of Emperor Wei's bloodline, all pointed to an extraordinary relationship between the two. The thought left Lu Jiangxian silent.

After an unknown amount of time, he finally focused his mind and peered into the mirror.

The unfathomable Great Void was a stretch of profound darkness. As he concentrated his gaze, the Great Void itself faded, and the dim, lightless scene gave way to an immense yellow radiance that connected heaven and earth, shining brilliantly.

In the distance sat an immense Dharma Body.

The body towered into the clouds, entirely earth-yellow in color. Its lower half was sunk deep into the ground, growing directly from the earth veins. Behind it, rings of multicolored light radiated outward like halos, each as large as a mountain, forming a barrier that nearly sealed off the world. Boundless radiance rippled across its form, swirling around its sides like rolling wind and smoke.

Its eyes were obscured within the dense layers of fog, their expression unreadable. Its pupils were perfect, pitch-black orbs, so dim they held not a single trace of light. Yet, from these same pupils, nine streams of multicolored light manifested and scattered, covering the land below.

This Dharma Body sat quietly cross-legged, its form impossibly vast, positioned directly upon the Luoxia Plain. The entire thousand-li fertile plain seemed to wrap around its smooth belly. Its body was hunched slightly forward, its hands placed in front of it on either side. In one hand was Caishan, and in the other was Xiaoshi Mountain.

And Tangdao Mountain, the very place all the cultivators were defending, rested squarely in its lap!

This Dharma Body was both terrifying and bizarre. It looked like a greedy child hugging half a watermelon, staring at it intently, unwilling to let go.

From start to finish, whether it was Kui Qi, Li Ximing, Tinglan, Che Hong, or Helian Wujiang—all of these cultivators from both north and south were fighting their battles right under its nose, right within its grasp!

Lu Jiangxian watched with extreme caution, careful not to reveal his presence in the Great Void. He calculated silently:

'It looks like a True Monarch of Earth Virtue, but not one who has reached Fruition Attainment... It must be some Wu Earth Auxiliary Position.'

'The Luoxia Wu Light path has positions for both Heavenly Glow and Wu Earth. Needless to say, this True Monarch must have descended from Mount Luoxia, coming to Luoxia specifically!'

'What is he doing here...'

'With a True Monarch standing guard, no matter how intense this war becomes, the spiritual energies and earth veins of the various lands will certainly be safe. But surely a True Monarch wouldn't need to come here personally just for that?'

'I wonder who he's waiting for. What an impenetrable defense.'

He heavily averted his gaze, letting it fall upon the table before him.

On the white jade platform lay a short sword. It was entirely silver-white, with a hilt one inch long. It rested flat, close at hand. The cold snow drifting down from the sky landed on the blade, only to slide off an instant later.

For a long time, Lu Jiangxian had been unable to interact with the outside world, forced to rely on spiritual items of the Supreme Yin lineage to make any exchange... But now, following the enrichment of the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, he could finally create things beyond the scope of Supreme Yin spiritual items!

This Sorcery Blade before him was the masterpiece of all his shamanic arts and Dao-Profundity!

'Chi Buzi... I must try to save this chess piece. But whether I succeed or fail, I cannot expose myself... This sword is the key!'

...

Inside the Supreme Yin Manor.

The moment Chi Buzi heard his smug tone, he poured a bucket of cold water on him, sighing:

"Easy for you to be smug! We've heard no news from above, yet the deadline approaches day by day. This time we managed to send up one of the Buddhists, but where are we going to find the next one?"

In the past, such a reprimand and a healthy dose of anxiety would have instantly ruined Dangjiang's mood, sending him into a spiral of frowning, overthinking, and muttering. But this time was completely different. The man just sneered and replied:

"Who the hell do you think I am? You do the labor, I do the thinking. We're not even on the same level! I already took care of everything!"

"Oh?"

Chi Buzi felt a flash of pleasant surprise, but immediately suspected he was bluffing. He asked, intrigued:

"And what exactly does that mean?"

Dangjiang laughed. "Hurry up and come with me! Immortal Attendant Shaohui instructed me long ago... As soon as you succeeded and came to the upper realm, I was to bring you to see her!"

"Excellent!"

Chi Buzi was overjoyed. He might be bluffing about other things, but a meeting with their superior was not something you could fake. Filled with delight, he followed him out and once again saw the two attendant women at the hall's entrance.

The one holding the pipa was still holding her pipa, but the attendant who had carried a bamboo basket now held a jade tray. On it were wisps and tufts of something like white cotton, each about the length of a finger, glowing faintly.

Having learned his lesson from the 'Golden Branch of the Moon Laurel,' Chi Buzi's eyes burned with fervor. His stare made the hairs on Dangjiang's neck stand on end, who quickly tugged his sleeve and whispered:

"You still haven't finished paying off the last one!"

Chi Buzi silently shook his head. As he followed him out, he whispered back secretly:

"It's only right that I haven't! What do you think that thing was? Up here, they keep it simple and call it the 'Golden Branch of the Moon Laurel.' But to those bastards at the Chunyi Dao Gate, it's known as the 'Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch'!"

The moment he heard the name from the Chunyi Dao Gate, he knew it was an extraordinary treasure. Many spiritual items are recorded in the ancient texts of various Daos, but only those who specialize in that path can recognize which item corresponds to which name. He narrowed his eyes slightly and cautioned:

"That name sounds vaguely familiar to me. Do you know of it?"

Dangjiang shook his head. "I'm a relic from ages ago. How the hell would I know!"

Seeing he wouldn't say, Chi Buzi grew more suspicious. "I never thought about it before. This time, when I go out, I absolutely must investigate this clearly."

The two walked through the corridor together. Chi Buzi's powers of observation were incredibly sharp; he immediately noticed that there seemed to be fewer people around. He whispered, "What's going on?"

Only when reminded did Dangjiang realize it himself. He was alarmed, but shook his head silently. The pavilion to their side was already upon them, leaving no time for more questions. Chi Buzi could only brace himself and push the door open.

The pavilion was much messier than before, with numerous attendants bustling about. The two made their way to the highest floor and saw the Immortal Attendant in tea-white robes sitting at a desk, intently focused on a scroll in front of her.

"Your subordinates pay their respects, Immortal Attendant!"

The two paid their respects from the side. Shaohui immediately looked up and forced a smile.

"Ah, it's you... Rest assured, I've called you here this time with good news."

Chi Buzi hurriedly expressed his thanks, listening as the Immortal Attendant above spoke to him with rare politeness:

"You found a hidden place last time, do you recall? Why don't you tell me about it?"

How could Chi Buzi possibly forget something that concerned his own life-or-death arrangements? He immediately replied with utmost respect:

"Reporting to Your Excellency, the place is within an immortal formation, situated beneath the 'Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance.' A certain highness once said personally that not even a True Monarch can perceive it or enter it. It is an excellent refuge!"

"Oh..."

Shaohui said softly, "You are quite clever. The Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance is the supreme and wondrous light of the Supreme Yang. That location is of considerable importance, and the jade tablet there is even more critical. An authority in the manor specifically sought me out to record a great merit in your name!"

The moment Chi Buzi heard this, he knew why he had been summoned. Dangjiang's bragging was just hot air, but Chi Buzi already knew his character and didn't care in the slightest. Overjoyed, he replied:

"Thank you, Your Excellency! This was all due to Your Excellency's guidance. How could it be considered my merit..."

Shaohui, however, was not in the mood for pleasantries and didn't take his bait, merely shaking her head.

"You are correct, it is a place that not even a True Monarch can perceive. Since such a location exists, I will not go back on the promise I made you. I have already procured what you need."

She retrieved a small box from her sleeve. Lifting it gently, she placed it on the desk. An attendant immediately came forward, picked up the box, and carried it down to him.

Chi Buzi's mind reeled from her words. A look of deep, ecstatic gratitude spread across his face as he thanked her profusely. Only when the box was in his hands did Shaohui speak again.

"There are two items inside."

"First, the 'Morning Rain Clear Cloud Art.'"

As soon as she said this, half of Chi Buzi's anxieties were settled. He listened as the female cultivator continued:

"For this, I requested an Immortal General to modify the 'Dao-Seeking Clear Cloud Art' belonging to 'Morning Cold Rain,' which was in the repository. We incorporated some of the essence of Pristine Water and changed it into the current 'Morning Rain Clear Cloud Art.' In your lower realm's terms, it's considered an ancient method and not particularly powerful, but I specifically sought approval from the authorities. It is usable."

Chi Buzi sighed. "To revise a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation art is something only a great cultivator with vast divine abilities can accomplish, let alone one that travels such a narrow and difficult path. That it could be successfully created is already miraculous. This lowly cultivator is filled with boundless admiration. How could I dare speak of it being 'powerful' or 'not powerful'..."

Shaohui smiled. "You're right about that. The main thing is that this touch of Pristine Water essence looks very promising in the eyes of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Conversely, in the eyes of a True Monarch... they will just think you are walking the dead-end path of seeking the Purple Mansion Realm through Pristine Water."

Chi Buzi nodded quickly. Though his heart was pounding with anticipation, he continued to hold the box respectfully, not moving a muscle until she had finished speaking. Shaohui continued:

"The second item is the 'World-Borrowing, Mind-Detaining Sorcery.'"

"Please elaborate, Your Excellency!"

Chi Buzi quickly bowed his head, watching as Shaohui gave a quiet order. "Bring the item here."

An attendant came forward holding a jade tray. In the center lay a short sword, no longer than a palm. It was entirely silver-white with a one-inch hilt. It had no dazzling radiance; its light was restrained, flowing subtly over the blade.

"This is the 'Profound Blade of the Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul.'"

Chi Buzi's fervent gaze swept over it, but he couldn't detect the slightest aura from the treasure. Though light flowed across its surface, it looked ordinary. Only the occasional flash of silver light hinted that this item was anything but simple.

"This item is the perfect match for the 'World-Borrowing, Mind-Detaining Sorcery.' All the wondrous effects you desire, this art can achieve!"

Shaohui's tone was calm, but her words were unbelievable:

"I understand your plan. The 'World-Borrowing, Mind-Detaining Sorcery' is a profound and wondrous soul technique. It can wash away memories and store them elsewhere. And the 'Profound Blade of the Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul' is a marvelous treasure that can store those severed memories within itself! Including your memories from the heavens."

Chi Buzi's eyes narrowed slightly. He understood. He met the woman's gaze, then immediately bowed deeply, his voice low.

"Your Excellency is brilliant..."

'The 'Profound Blade of the Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul'... Good... very good... And the immortal formation. Now, everything is ready!'

Who was Chi Buzi? In that instant, he had already sorted through the entire sequence of events and devised a foolproof plan:

'I will hide the 'Profound Blade of the Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul' within that immortal formation. I just need to leave a single breadcrumb, a small clue. I'll arrange it so that, just before I make my final decision, I meet with someone who cannot possibly be divined. They will give me a hint, prompting me to visit the formation, and I will retrieve my memories!'

And if he asked someone for a hint, that interaction also wouldn't remain in his memory. Even if Pristine Water itself inspected his soul, he would find no clues. As a Great Daoist Master of the Purple Mansion Realm, there were far too many people he could, and would, interact with.

Putting others aside, he wouldn't even need to 'accidentally' visit Penglai. If he just met with Pu Yu, he was confident he could leave some verbal cue for his future self, and then calmly forget it.

His mind raced. In a corner of the pavilion, unseen by all, the man in white sat, watching him quietly.

'For a clever man, you don't need to say much. Just giving him the tools is enough...'

The body of this sword was formed from a Supreme Yin spiritual item and a Lesser Yin divine ability. He had imbued it with all manner of shamanic arts to grant it the wondrous power to evade inspection and divination, as well as the divine ability to cleanse a soul... And that peacock soul of the Merciful One, which he had acquired long ago, had also been placed inside.

All of this was merely a vessel. The most crucial component was the Talisman Seed carried by that peacock soul!

This was the origin of the sword's power to evade inspection and divination. It was less a short sword and more the reincarnation of that Demon beast. It used the divine abilities on the sword as its body, possessed a soul, and was bound by a Talisman Seed! Naturally, it was impossible to inspect and impossible to divine!

'This way, with a single thought, this sword will instantly vanish without a trace, carried by the Talisman Seed back into the Immortal Mirror... leaving nothing behind!'

The so-called memory storage operated on the same principle. Lu Jiangxian had no 'metal and stone' on hand to refine a proper artifact, and he absolutely could not leave any traces. These heavenly matters could not be recorded on any jade slip, nor could Chi Buzi split his own soul. Instead, he could entrust his memories to the soul within the sword, thereby gaining the ability to 'carry' them. If there was even the slightest chance of exposure, Lu Jiangxian could make it all vanish with a single thought!

And that soul, bound by the Talisman Seed, was conveniently undetectable and undivinable!



# Chapter 921: The Situation Gradually Settles

Chi Buzi accepted the Profound Blade of the Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul, his expression serene and deferential. A thousand speculations flashed through his mind, but he knelt obediently and said respectfully,

"I will certainly not fail Your Excellency's expectations!"

Shaohui said softly,

"There are no expectations. This is merely a reward for your merits, a path to survival."

"This subordinate understands!"

Chi Buzi replied submissively. He saw Dangjiang, who was standing to the side, raise his head and ask cautiously,

"I noticed the residence is... much quieter. May I ask why...?"

Shaohui's vermilion lips parted with a faint sigh.

"There has been a change in the celestial phenomena. The Wu Earth has brightened, and a great event has occurred in the lower realm. We have been ordered to observe the signs, to guard against any True Monarchs or even higher-level beings from taking action. Thus, many of our fellow Daoists are not in residence."

As soon as she spoke, Chi Buzi's lowered eyes narrowed slightly, his heart chilled.

'Wu Earth... Luoxia... It seems a True Monarch has personally intervened in the conflict between north and south... I wonder which one from Luoxia it could be...'

Chi Buzi was based overseas, but he had missed none of the news from the mainland. He had numerous channels for gathering information, and a cold dread crept into his heart.

'I knew the north-south conflict was a bottomless pit—anyone who got involved would meet a bad end. But I never imagined a True Monarch would appear in person... No wonder!'

'Even when Lou Xing staked his life-mandate to beg Xueyang to remain in Qinling, drawing the attention of countless paths and cultivators to observe the law and probe the truth of Luoxia's Xueyang... even that barely caused a ripple in the face of this great tide. I never thought the north-south conflict would escalate to this degree!'

His heart was ice.

'Who is this True Monarch from Luoxia waiting for... The Taizhu? The one from the heavens above? Lady Valley Water... or perhaps one of the two remaining from the Lesser Yang?'

The thought had barely crossed his mind when he heard Shaohui speak softly from her high seat.

"However, there is no need to be overly anxious. We observed closely. In the end, no conflict broke out. Otherwise, things would not be as they are now."

Chi Buzi quickly seized the opening, speaking respectfully,

"Exactly! During the conflict over the Jade True path to enlightenment in the Northern Sea, the celestial phenomena were chaotic, and no one in the world could see clearly. Only a few of us with higher cultivation bases, who had also achieved a Life Divine Ability, had some inkling. Word gradually spread. Now, several great cultivators are discussing it, calling it the 'True Unification Transformation,' and everyone is awaiting the final outcome..."

Though he said this to fish for information, he wasn't wrong. The result of that great battle would determine the future of the Jade True path. Although more and more people were cultivating the Jade True, the various clans were all waiting for a clear result before deciding whether to send their true core disciples onto this Daoist tradition. There were even those of the Jade True tradition, like Zhusheng, who probably inspected their white jade with Pristine Water and golden stone every day, terrified of receiving bad news.

Lu Jiangxian, however, had no ability to peer into the heavens beyond. He wouldn't even spare a glance at Luoxia, where the Wu Earth Golden Core resided, let alone study the outcome of a battle between True Monarchs. Naturally, there was no relevant news from the heavens. In response to his query, Shaohui merely shook her head and smiled.

"Unless something world-shattering occurs, even if there is a result, it won't be seen for several years."

Her answer was perfectly watertight, forcing Chi Buzi to lower his head. He had hoped to glean the heavens' stance from her words. Having failed, he immediately fell silent.

This had been a long-standing doubt of his. Although the heavens were undoubtedly ruled by the Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang, this place didn't resemble an Immortal Mansion at all. When Chi Buzi had mentioned Du Qing, the Zhengao—clearly a high-ranking figure—had referred to him as 'that True Monarch who cultivates Pristine Water'.

'Yet, the Immortal Lord established his residence here. This place must have an origin far older than the Immortal Mansion. Perhaps even the Immortal Lord is just one member of the heavens!'

He knew this place was governed by various bureaus. The woman before him cultivated the Lesser Yin, but in Dangjiang's words, she was merely an immortal maiden of the Lesser Yin bureau...

'This, too, is a bureau, which means there might be at least one other True Monarch of the Lesser Yin's position in the heavens!'

The path of the Lesser Yin had been hidden for many years. According to Chi Buzi's memory, aside from the Daoist tradition in Western Jizhong where the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao's mountain gate was located, it was rarely heard of elsewhere...

Chi Buzi didn't have time to dwell on it. He quickly bowed and said,

"Time is short, and I must not delay the heavens' affairs... However, caution must come first. I wish to entrust my belongings to Immortal Officer Dangjiang for safekeeping and retrieve them once I am within the formation!"

His reasoning was sound. After all, he was going to Penglai. Who knew what strange techniques that grotto-heaven possessed? It was best to avoid risks if possible. Although Shaohui knew nothing of Penglai, she understood his caution and nodded lightly.

"Very well."

"Thank you..."

Before he could finish, Shaohui waved him away. Chi Buzi rose, and Dangjiang immediately moved to follow, but Shaohui stopped him, keeping him in the courtyard.

Dangjiang said nothing, but with Chi Buzi's matter resolved, he was clearly in a good mood. He sidled up with a smile.

"Your Excellency..."

Shaohui shook her head silently and asked,

"Chi Buzi is returning this time, and his future is uncertain. But he has rendered a service, and you will benefit from it. I have already reported to Immortal General Zhengao that you are well-versed in matters of high sacrifice and have a good understanding of the lower realm..."

Dangjiang perked up instantly, nodding repeatedly. Zhengao had mentioned a reward a few days ago.

"It is all thanks to Your Excellency's guidance! This lowly one is endlessly grateful..."

Shaohui smiled.

"If you're going to say that, shouldn't you first repay me for that basket of golden Moon Laurel branches?"

Dangjiang was just being polite. The very thought of the branches made his heart bleed. He stammered, his face mournful,

"This... How can this be calculated... To this day, this subordinate only has two or three hundred merits to his name..."

Shaohui shook her head with a smile.

"I won't tease you. You are to be promoted to an immortal officer in charge of sacrificial rites, in another realm... The official edict has not yet arrived, but if you wait, you should have some good days ahead."

Dangjiang was overjoyed. He kowtowed in satisfaction, then immediately began asking about the details with curiosity and delight. He was such a chatterbox that the woman quickly grew annoyed and found an excuse to send him away.

Lu Jiangxian had been standing in the hall from beginning to end, watching quietly.
This arrangement for Dangjiang wasn't just a response to his frequent complaints; it was also part of his own plans.

'When Li Ximing seized Tangdao Mountain, he killed a Merciful One named Huakong. Although his body was destroyed by Li Ximing and returned to the Buddhist Land, he was slain by a Talisman Seed. That wisp of True Spirit was naturally recorded on the Name Ascending Stone.'

In other words, with a single thought, Lu Jiangxian could instantly summon Hua Kong into the mirror!

He wasn't the only one. Li Ximing had also killed one on Caishan, but that was right under a True Monarch's nose, with them staring intently. That Merciful One was also utterly worthless, so Lu Jiangxian hadn't made a move.

Giving Dangjiang this position was also in preparation for this matter.

'In the future, the north and south will have direct contact. The Buddhist cultivators are not united, which is a perfect opportunity to profit from the chaos, cultivate a few of my own people, and ease the pressure on the Li family...'

'As for the Merciful Ones, the more I can secretly record, the better. But I can't just go around killing them at will. It's not a major issue right now. The personnel I choose to summon into the mirror must be elites, not just numerous. Even if they aren't Maha, they should at least be at the Minghui or Five-Eyed level—Merciful Ones with high status and power!'

...

Moongaze Lake.

Purple-gold profound pillars stood upon the island, wreathed in mist and carved with arcane patterns. Cultivators moved among them, their presence imposing. In the very center, the inner array glowed with a hazy purple light, its pale yellow floor tiles reflecting the leaping flames.

A Daoist Master in white-gold robes clapped his hands together, his face alight with joy. He slapped the alchemy furnace heavily. A deep gray radiance surged up and coiled around the furnace. The elephant-head spout opened wide, spitting out a plume of gray-black gas.

The smoke dissipated. Within the cavern-dwelling, the sound of a trickling stream could be heard. Li Ximing opened a jade box, and seven medicinal pills fell out one by one, landing softly on the delicate white cushion inside.
'Hooo...'

Seeing the seven pills, Li Ximing let out a breath of relief.

He had long known that 'Pit Water' and 'Bright Yang' were not very compatible and had been reminded several times. But only when he actually began refining the pills did he truly feel the discord between them.

'Fortunately, my skills are superb, and I used True Fire instead of the Bright Yang Purple Flame. Only then could I maintain control of the situation...'

He had previously anticipated a yield of eight or nine pills. Even with the conflict between the Daoist traditions, he had still managed to produce seven. This was more than enough to meet the other party's request for six.
He looked into the box. Each pill was etched with the rugged patterns of mountains and rivers. A light, ethereal aroma wafted out, carrying the faint sound of water. He quickly closed the lid to prevent the spiritual atmosphere from affecting the pills.

Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder cleared the mind, sharpened the senses, and advanced one's Daoist cultivation. In Li Ximing's opinion, wasting a Purple Mansion Realm-level Cangzhou Serpent Scale for such minor effects was simply not worth it. However, the other party's Daoist tradition must have another, more wondrous use for it. They had simply ordered Li Minggong to come and lead a team to Qize.

With that, he teleported, landing on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. At the foot of the mountain, the purple flame spiritual vein chimed. His spiritual sense swept out. Li Zhouwei's Grand Ascension was bobbing in the purple flames, shimmering with light, while cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate worked to repair it nearby.

"Where has Minghuang gone?"

He asked casually. Immediately, Ding Weizeng descended onto the mountain and said respectfully,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, Daoist Master Minghuang has entered Mount Dali."

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He acknowledged with a grunt and asked,

"How are the river banks?"

Ding Weizeng replied with utmost respect,

"The opposite bank has been occupied by the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple. In the span of three nights, countless commoners have surged south, covering the entire Baijiang Creek region. They are spreading their teachings far and wide, erecting innumerable temples."

Li Ximing shook his head.

"They always know how to be disgusting."

With the migration of hundreds of thousands of Buddhist followers, the fate of Baijiang Creek was sealed. Even if they reclaimed the land one day, unless they resorted to a full-scale massacre, it would take fifty to a hundred years to eradicate the Buddhist influence.

'They just have to go around in circles, hiding behind the banner of this Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple. I don't know which sect they belong to, or what Daoist tradition they covet...'

The opposite bank had made no further moves. It seemed they had no intention of pushing south for now, which was a good thing. As he mused, Ding Weizeng spoke again.

"There is one more matter to report. A Demon beast has arrived from the Southern Borderlands... He was escorted by people from Azure Pond and calls himself Yan Hu."

"Ah, so it's him."

Yan Hu was one of his own subordinates. Li Ximing beckoned.

"Have him come up."

A man with a broad face and black hair, wrapped in a dark robe, ascended from below. Seeing Li Ximing, he called out,

"This subordinate greets Your Excellency! It has been long. This subordinate has missed you terribly..."

Li Ximing couldn't be bothered with pleasantries. He just wanted to hear good news. He waved his hand.

"What have you found?"

Yan Hu quickly bowed.

"Reporting to Your Excellency! Thanks to your reputation and borrowing your divine ability, this subordinate passed through the great mountains of the Piaoren Kingdom and searched the demon kingdoms west of Piaoren, beneath the Great Western Plateau. After many inquiries, I found a Demon King in the Xipo Kingdom who hopes to gain some benefits from the Daoist Master."

"That Demon King cultivates 'Auspicious Qi' and calls himself the Great Suopo King. He possesses two types of Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources and one portion of Purple Mansion spiritual water, but he requires medicinal pills... He wishes to ask Your Excellency to refine them for him."

Li Ximing frowned. From the sound of it, the other party clearly didn't trust a mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, not even revealing the names of the resources. He felt a pang of disappointment. Yan Hu watched his expression and added in a low voice,

"He said this pill is extremely difficult to refine, with only one pill per furnace. But when he heard the Daoist Master is a 'Bright Yang' cultivator and would be beneficial for this pill, he eagerly sent me to ask."

Li Ximing was completely ignorant of that region and had never seen the pill formula, so he couldn't know its difficulty. He frowned.

"Only this one?"

At this, Yan Hu lowered his voice.

"In the lands east of the Piaoren Kingdom, there is an old Demon King, the Bifeng Mountain Lord. He is extremely powerful, named Can Lufu, and is also skilled in alchemy. He has been widely befriending fellow Daoists in recent years, and many Demon beasts from the Southern Borderlands seek him out... so he isn't desperate for alchemy services."

Hearing this name, Li Ximing tossed the cup in his hand aside as if it were bad luck. His gaze turned icy, but he said nothing.

"But past the Piaoren Kingdom is the area below the Great Western Plateau. The Great Western Plateau's 'White Victory Palace' has a Purple Mansion Realm protector, a demonic cultivator who is one of the Bright Ones. He is exceptionally skilled at alchemy and acts fairly, so most of the Demon Kings there seek him out. Only the Great Suopo King is on bad terms with him... which is why..."

Li Ximing could only shake his head. He was still injured. How could he travel thousands of miles into the depths of the Southern Borderlands? Besides, he didn't know the extent of the enmity with the 'White Victory Palace' or if it was related to the pill... He had no desire to offend someone for no reason.

"Reply to him that I have important matters and it is inconvenient to travel. If he insists on the refinement... he can either come here, or he can wait a few years. You should bypass this Demon King for now and continue asking deeper in the region."

"Yes!"

Yan Hu answered respectfully and continued,

"Regarding the spiritual fire Your Excellency instructed me to find, I also gathered information. There are two confirmed locations. One is with the master of the Piaoren Kingdom, who is an immortal cultivator. The other is with a Demon King by the Southern Sea. Both of them treasure their spiritual fires... and have no intention of trading them."

Li Ximing shook his head and asked,

"What are their cultivation levels?"

This question startled Yan Hu. He dropped to his knees.

"This lowly one does not know... I do not know!"

His mind raced, and he quickly added,

"Also... I also heard that the high-ranking figures of Southern Songzhou Luoshe and the Great Konghai Temple all possess spiritual fires! In the past, a great fire-attribute Demon failed their breakthrough and perished near the Piaoren Kingdom. Several clusters of spiritual fire escaped. Someone must have secretly kept them!"

The one in Southern Songzhou Luoshe was undoubtedly Jiao Zhongzi. The one at the Great Konghai Temple was certainly in the hands of that old Maha. Both would be extremely difficult to obtain. Li Ximing nodded, having a clearer picture now. He said in a low voice,

"Investigate further!"

The Demon beast scurried off. Li Ximing felt a headache coming on.

'Not everyone is as generous as the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, where one person offers to give you this and another offers to give you that. Everyone else hoards their treasures... It seems I have no choice but to make that trip.'

He immediately set his itinerary.

'First, I'll go to the Qunyi region and open that unknown cavern-dwelling to see what treasures it holds. Then, I'll head to the Piaoren Kingdom area to look into the spiritual fire.'

He took a step, returning to the array. He closed his eyes and his consciousness soared into the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. An incredibly dense wave of Spiritual Qi washed over him. He retrieved a pill from his sleeve. It was snow-white and inscribed with the pattern of a Qilin.

"The situation is changing. It seems I can't afford to be frugal. I'll take this Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, which excels at healing the physical body, and repair this lingering injury. I must hurry and set out!"

# Chapter 922: Qingyu Qian

Mount Dali.

Leaves drifted across a thousand peaks, carried on the mournful autumn wind. The treacherous mountains of Mount Dali rose high, its sixteen Demon Caves overflowing with a dazzling, radiant Spiritual Qi. Several Demon beasts patrolled the skies, riding the wind. All were clad in armor, their movements precise and orderly.

The golden-eyed man paused on the mountainside, his gaze piercing. The White Ape Demon beast behind him stepped forward at once, frowning slightly. Below them, a throng of demons dropped to the ground, kowtowing and crying out "Great King!" One Demon beast broke from the crowd and crawled forward, prostrating itself. It knocked its head on the ground before the man's boots and called out:

"We were unaware of which sacred territory Your Lordship hails from. We have already dispatched a messenger to summon the Demon King from the cave. Please, milord, grant us your name so that we may announce you properly!"

Li Zhouwei glanced at the surrounding Demon beasts. "A neighbor from the lake," he replied.

Before his voice faded, two streaks of light shot toward them, transforming mid-air into two middle-aged men. Li Zhouwei focused his gaze and recognized them: one was a deer spirit, the other a bear. Both possessed the cultivation of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The two Demon beasts landed and immediately performed a deep kowtow, pressing their entire bodies to the earth. Li Zhouwei gave a slight lift of his hand, and an invisible divine ability raised the deer demon to his feet. "There is no need for such ceremony," Li Zhouwei said softly.

"We traveled to the Northern Foothills, but we found the cave manor deserted and the Elder absent. We took the liberty of coming directly to the main peak. I hope you will not take offense."

This was Lu Ken, one of Bai Rong's subordinates, whom Li Zhouwei had met before. He was the one helped to his feet, yet he remained timid, barely daring to speak. The bear demon beside him, lacking this connection, remained prostrate on the ground.

Lu Ken quickly protested, "One must always kneel before a great lord! Furthermore, your Lordship's life-mandate is complete and you have reclaimed your divine ability. If I do not show proper respect at this moment, I fear it will damage my own meager fortune."

Li Zhouwei had no choice but to retract his power and allow him to complete the bow. Only then did Lu Ken rise, speaking with deep humility.

"It is not that I was unwilling to remain on the mountain to serve you, milord. But... the White Qilin bloodline has achieved its divine ability. The Northern Foothills... we dare not have a demon general who is not named Li, nor a master who does not bear scales. This lowly demon fears incurring Wei Huang's heavenly wrath, and so I did not dare to remain."

He was visibly terrified, and the bear demon beside him trembled like a leaf, still unable to rise. Li Zhouwei nodded. "Take me to the master of Mount Dali."

The deer demon immediately bowed low and led the way. As they walked, Li Zhouwei admired the winding, treacherous mountain paths and asked, "Since those with scales fall under the dominion of the White Qilin and the Shuyang, what Dao governs your deer clan?"

Lu Ken answered respectfully, "My kind follows the Dao of 'Purple Qi'."

'So, the Purple Qi... Elder Bai Rong *does* tread upon Purple Smoke. It all fits.'

With this understanding, he flew a short distance further and arrived at the summit of Mount Dali's main peak. He saw a pool of churning white water, wreathed in steam. A host of demons presented auspicious tributes, and the ground was carpeted with spirit fruits and herbs.

Lu Ken dared not proceed. The White Ape also stopped silently. Li Zhouwei continued on alone, walking several dozen paces through the ethereal, misty paradise until he saw a jade platform. A man was seated upon it.

The man's skin was flawless, like polished jade, and his features were soft and handsome, bordering on bewitching. He had a slender build and a graceful bearing, with a constant smile playing at the corners of his eyes. His entire expression was one of joy. He descended from the platform, beaming.

"Wherever the Qilin treads, life flourishes. Your arrival is truly Mount Dali's greatest blessing!"

"It is merely a quirk of fate. You praise me too highly, milord."

Li Zhouwei returned the courtesy, a golden light swirling in his eyes. 'A Demon King with three divine abilities... and none I recognize.'

Mount Dali held a stable position in Jiangnan. Though they had become more reclusive in recent years, no one dared to provoke them. They clearly possessed a deep foundation. This man alone was a noble scion of considerable cultivation.

The man smiled warmly and gestured for him to sit at a table. "I am the Demon King of Mount Dali," he said. "My family name is Qingyu, my given name is Qian, and my Daoist title is Tingfu. I have long heard of the great Minghuang!"

This was unexpected. The fox clans of Mount Dali almost universally used 'Bai' as their proper surname. Yet, this Demon King Tingfu was not named Bai, but Qingyu Qian.

"Greetings, Elder." Li Zhouwei immediately rose from his seat and bowed.

"Mount Dali has provided assistance for many years. The Li family would not be where it is today without your aid. I am deeply grateful. Thank you, Elder!"

Demon King Tingfu chuckled and shook his head. As a fox spirit in human form, his smile was captivating. He lifted a jade pot from the table and poured wine for Li Zhouwei. "That debt is not mine to claim."

Li Zhouwei completed his bow before returning to his seat. Demon King Tingfu raised his cup and offered a few words of congratulations. "Bai Rong, that child," he began.

"I was the one who elevated him from the common forest spirits. He is a junior I hold in high regard. Unfortunately, he is currently in seclusion deep in the mountains, nurturing his divine ability, so he cannot come out to greet you. It is a pity."

Li Zhouwei smiled. "When Elder Bai Rong emerges successful, I will certainly return to offer my congratulations."

After a few more pleasantries, Qingyu Qian's eyes curved in a smile as he finally got to the point. "I heard what happened with the Dragon-kin. A member of your clan was transformed into lightning, yes? That must be a gambit by Dragon Monarch Beijia, a piece placed on the board concerning the Bright Yang matter long ago. It's impossible that Luoxia is unaware... What I wish to know is, what is your view on this, Minghuang?"

Seeing him be so direct, Li Zhouwei replied, "In your opinion, Elder, is there any chance of escape?"

The fox and the dragon had made their pact in his presence. Li Zhouwei had to frame his question accordingly. Hearing it, Qingyu Qian replied softly, "Difficult."

Before Li Zhouwei could respond, Qingyu Qian continued in a pleasant tone, "While I have no love for Luoxia, the Dragon-kin are not easy allies either. Frankly, Luoxia may not even covet the Bright Yang. They simply do not wish for the Shuyangthe pivot standing above the Bright Yang Fruition Attainmentto be Li Qianyuan. If you were to acquiesce to their wishes, you could still achieve the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment and become one of the great powers of this world."

His words were surprisingly moderate, favoring neither side. Li Zhouwei was clearly confused and remained silent for a moment before asking in a low voice, "Why do they hate him so much?"

After Li Zhouwei posed the question, Qingyu Qian sighed.

"Li Qianyuan is no ordinary man. There are few Fruition Attainments left in this world that represent sole mastery. He is but one step away from becoming a Dao Embryo. If he takes that step, he will be the first person in all of history to unite the roles of Celestial Emperor and true Immortal in one body."

"He has an irreconcilable conflict with Luoxia, and indeed, with more than half of all major Daoist traditions. This conflict isn't just about Dao paths, Daoist traditions, or divine abilities. It is rooted in old grudges, fundamental philosophies, and the very nature of cultivation."

Qingyu Qian's expression was grave. Li Zhouwei frowned. "But I have heard... in primordial times, there was a Human Emperor who established a great dynasty..."

Qingyu Qian took a sip of wine and shook his head. "That was a dynasty, yes, but not a *Celestial Dynasty*. A Celestial Dynasty, by definition, rules all under heaven. There is but one authorityimperial authority. One fatherthe sovereign. How can that compare to the Zhou, which merely presided over its enfeoffed lords? To be blunt, the Great Zhou was nothing more than a powerful central state among many."

Li Zhouwei fell silent. The fox demon before him continued in a low voice:

"Do you understand now? We have the benefit of hindsight; history is a clear mirror for us. But how many understood at the time? Touba Xuantan also proclaimed a Celestial Dynasty. He had a deep foundation and the support of the Viewing Pavilion faction. And what was the fate of his Great Liang?"

"Look at Emperor Zhao, Fu Qiyan. He established the Great Zhao Dynasty. He ascended Mount Dayang, gazed out over the endless yellow sands, and said only: 'Dechang is dead, the Xiao-Wu are not pacified, the south remains a treacherous unknown. My great work is unfinished.' Did he give any thought to what would become of his descendants?"

"The Wei Emperor died suddenly in the sky; the Liang Emperor drowned in a river. Fu Qiyan was halfway through his conquest of Yan when he spoke those words and collapsed in Yincheng Prefecture. It is said even the trees and stones wept. The 'Body of Kui' Fruition Attainment of the Ancient Merging was lost forever from that day. Think! In ancient times, what was the Dharma Body of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? And what is it today?"

This barrage of questions left Li Zhouwei speechless. Qingyu Qian's tone softened. "No imperial house has ever had both a good beginning and a good end. All the Dragon-kin hope to do is postpone his final fall; they have no illusions of his return. The people from Luoxia will seek you out eventually. You must be careful."

"Thank you for your guidance, milord."

Qingyu Qian's expression was somber, the smile gone from his eyes. Clearly, despite the pact between dragon and fox, Mount Dali held a deeply pessimistic view of the future. Li Zhouwei offered his thanks again, and they shifted the conversation to lighter topics, dispersing the heavy atmosphere that had settled within the white mist.

Having only just achieved his divine ability, Li Zhouwei still had many questions about the 'Children of Fate'. It was not a topic one could broach in ordinary company, as few truly understood it. His purpose in coming today was not just to pay respects, but also to seek answers.

"I have now reached the Purple Mansion Realm and awakened a divine ability," he began. "I can feel that my physical body is far stronger, and my eyes can perceive many things I could not before. But beyond that, the other benefitsand drawbacksare still unclear to me."

"Elder Bai Rong once mentioned that upon reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, my state would be essentially no different from that of a Demon beast. I was hoping you could elaborate on this."

At this, Qingyu Qian nodded in understanding, then smiled. "You have certainly come to the right person. When it comes to the Life Divine Ability, I dare say Mount Dali's legacy is among the most complete."

His expression turned serious. "A Fruition Attainment is a 'position,' but it is also a 'power' that constantly influences the world. This is why the two words are so often linked."

"Within the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, the Life Divine Ability is perhaps the most special. What does it cultivate? According to my Daoist tradition, it cultivates one's *connection* to a Fruition Attainment. The wonders of this divine ability are realized through the influence that its corresponding Fruition Attainment exerts upon the world. This is why cultivating a Life Divine Ability places such extreme emphasis on one's Dao-Profundity."

He took a sip of wine. "Some Daoist traditions possess more than one Life Divine Ability. This simply means their chosen Fruition Attainment is 'higher' and places more emphasis on this connection. In the past, cultivators had to comprehend this path on their own. Imagine the difficulty! The genius of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao lies in its simplicity. It lowers the requirements for innate talent and Dao-Profundity."

"Unfortunately, the world has never been fair. Some have good luck, others good birth. By the same token, there exists a class of people whowhether through reincarnation, bloodline, circumstance, or even for no discernible reason at allreceive the favor of a Fruition Attainment. They gain access to all its corresponding wonders. These are the people we call 'Children of Fate'."

"Such people often possess heaven-defying luck and are destined for great things. It is as if they are born with a piece of that connection, even if they are unaware of it. The moment they reach the Purple Mansion Realm, they find their Life Divine Ability manifests naturally, as easily as water flowing downhill."

His eyes curved, a smile ever-present in them. "This is true for you as well. Had you cultivated the 'World's Radiance', it would have manifested just as naturally. However, you also have a key difference from them."

"To explain this, we must discuss transformation. In the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, once a cultivator awakens their Body Divine Ability, more than eighty percent of them gain the power to change their shape. As long as the Shengyang Acupoint is intact, transforming into a bird or a fish is trivial. Most of these are just symbolic of a given Daoist tradition. Unless one studies a dedicated art of transformation, it's merely a change in appearance. It's not as useful as the human form, which is suited to myriad paths... After all, even we Demon beasts... seek to attain a human form."

"But Li Qianyuan has already ascended to his Fruition Attainment. How can he still be called human? It would not be an exaggeration to call him the Shuyang itself. As his descendant, the moment you received that favor, the Fruition Attainmentand the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment is one that *prizes* the bond between father and sonwould recognize you as the scion of the Shuyang. This is not transformation. It is what you *are*."

He narrowed his eyes slightly. "As for why you are a Qilin and not a Cicada, that is also obvious. You are the first to cause the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment to shift its gaze. You are, by default, the 'eldest son'the White Qilin. When you have perfected all five divine abilities, your status as the White Qilin will be sealed."

"If I am not mistaken, both the Dragon-kin and Luoxia have foreseen this. Luoxia, in particular, watches the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment intently. The instant you awakened your divine ability, they knew a White Qilin had descended upon the world."

Understanding dawned in Li Zhouwei's heart. "If, one day, another person gains its favor," Qingyu Qian added, "that one will likely be the Cicada."

Li Zhouwei nodded slowly, then raised an eyebrow. "But... this father-son connection... is Luoxia truly not afraid that the Wei Emperor left some contingency? That *he* intentionally allowed this to happen?"

"Hahahahaha!" The fox demon laughed aloud, but his tone shifted abruptly, becoming low and cold.

"Of course not. The Bright Yang is not just the seat of the sovereign father. It is also the seat of 'son slays father,' 'father kills son,' 'father steals son's love,' and 'son seizes father's power.' Only when all five aspects are united is it the *true* Bright Yang!"

"The Bright Yang abhors inversion. When the son is strong and the father is weak, how could the son *not* seize the throne?"

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze, a profound chill seeping into his heart.

The mist over the pool swirled violently. After a heavy silence, Li Zhouwei replied, "Your knowledge is vast and your Dao-Profundity is deep, milord, far beyond the reach of ordinary men. This junior is filled with admiration and gratitude."

Qingyu Qian quickly regained his composure, smiling and shaking his head. "It is mainly because my Daoist tradition is complete. But speaking of true Dao-Profundity, I could never compare to the master from Purple Smoke. *He* is the one whose Dao-Profundity is truly profound, a scholar who bridges heaven and humanity."

Li Zhouwei knew at once he spoke of Daoist Master Zimu, the peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition who had vanished. "A pity that master's whereabouts are unknown," Li Zhouwei sighed.

Qingyu Qian did not elaborate, reining in the topic. He only smiled. "His cultivation speed was terrifying. At the time, his talent was proclaimed the greatest in the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. He had more than enough talent to walk the Ancient Immortal Dao!"

He quickly changed the subject. "The truth is, my divine ability is somewhat... peculiar. While sitting here, I can hear voices from the lands below. I have spent most of the last century in seclusion, so I actually know little about your clan. Most of what I know, I learned from my junior."

The Li family had long known that this Demon King could hear all things. It was impossible to know if he had overheard their conversations back when they were mere mortals, or in the Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining stages. It was an extremely sensitive matter, and a natural source of suspicion.

For him to admit it so openly now clearly meant he wished to clear the air. Li Zhouwei wasn't sure how to respond. "Your divine ability is profound, milord... Is it the 'Celestial-Awakening Ear'?"

Demon King Tingfu smiled. "The Li family of Wei truly has a deep foundation. Your guess is correct. It is a path unknown to ordinary people. Even in its golden age, there were never more than two or three Daoist traditions in the world that cultivated it."

At this, Li Zhouwei smiled. "Then it must be a method from the Ancient Merging?"

It wasn't a difficult guess. The arts of Mount Wu were known to resonate with shamanic arts, yet they were not based on concrete elements like earth, water, wind, fire, lightning, or Spiritual Qi. It was almost certainly a path from the Ancient Merging.

Qingyu Qian poured him more wine, smiling but saying nothing. After a moment, he spoke softly.

"Having cultivated this divine ability, it is... impolitic to visit other's homes. After all, even if people are speaking at a great distance, they have their secrets and taboos. For this reason, I have rarely left this mountain for many years, save to witness the descendants of old friends break through to the Purple Mansion Realm or to observe a cultivator attempt to form their Golden Core."

"I am currently attempting to cross the immortal threshold. The opportunity has arrived, and my breakthrough draws near, so I travel even less. If I am fortunate enough to one day become a Great Demon King, then leaving the mountain would be an even greater offense to others!"

"However, Mount Dali possesses a complete Daoist tradition, and I have some small insight. If you have any questions you seek answers to, Minghuang, you are always welcome to ask."

Li Zhouwei readily agreed, thinking to himself, 'Compared to the Chunyi Dao Gate, Mount Dali seems far more reliable. When the time comes for the cave manor to appear, I will have a perfect excuse to return and ask.'



# Chapter 923: Settling All Affairs

Li Zhouwei sat on Mount Dali for some time, making significant gains before he bid farewell to Qingyu Qian. He descended the mountain with the White Ape, departing amidst the respectful murmurs of the Demon beasts lining the path.

'The Dragon-Fox Pact certainly exists, but the foxes are clearly leaning toward neutrality,' he mused. 'Even if pressured to align with the Dragon-kin, they just want to live in seclusion on Mount Dali and avoid the world's affairs as much as possible…'

'This isn't just a gap in strength; it's a geographical limitation. The Dragon-kin, even in their decline, still possess an entire sea. Mount Dali, however, is only by a lake. They dare not get too involved in Bright Yang matters…'

He turned his head slightly toward the White Ape and asked in a low voice, "Did you manage to find out anything?"

The White Ape immediately bowed, his voice aged. "I heard the Demon beasts in the caves say… there is another great king in the mountains, even more formidable than the Demon King Tingfu. He is said to have fur as white as snow and a noble bloodline, but he has not shown himself in recent years. As for anything more… it is difficult to say if it is true or false."

'Even more formidable…'

Li Zhouwei immediately understood the implications.

'Qingyu Qian is already preparing to cross the immortal threshold. That means this hidden Demon King must be at the Four Divine Abilities level, at least. Add to that the fox clan's old ancestor, who may have received guidance from an immortal… their strength is truly considerable…'

'And Elder Bai Rong reached the stage of nurturing a divine ability just one hundred years after his Foundation Establishment. That's nothing for a human, but for a Demon beast, whose cultivation speed is inferior, he is an incredible genius… He has likely benefited immensely from the Dragon-Fox Pact.'

Although he had not met Bai Rong this time, he had gathered a great deal of information and gained a clearer understanding of the greater situation. He traveled as a beam of light, reflecting inwardly.

'In the end, everyone has their own interests. I must listen to all sides if I am to find an opening in this predicament…'

He returned to the lake, still lost in thought. He rode the light, tore open a path through the Great Void, and landed on Qingdu Peak. The small courtyard was somewhat desolate. He saw an old man by the door who had set out two wooden racks, apparently sunning a suit of armor.

Li Zhouwei had actually seen Li Xuanxuan once upon his initial return, but they'd had no time to talk before he had to hurry off to the mountain. Now, bearing news of Bai Rong, he landed in the courtyard.

"Daoist Master, you've come."

Li Xuanxuan's spirits seemed low, but he still managed a smile. "Although everyone said you would reach the Purple Mansion Realm, your breakthrough still made people worry. Seeing you standing right here truly sets my heart at ease."

The wrinkles on his face bunched together. Despite all kinds of restorative medicines, the old man's vitality had not been strong in recent years. Coupled with his constant worrying, he looked even more aged.

"It is all thanks to the old master's great fortune and protection," Li Zhouwei replied with utmost respect. He glanced at the armor in the courtyard and realized it was perfectly ordinary—mortal armor.

Li Xuanxuan smiled. "It's the armor from my youth, from the campaign against the Eastern Yue. I like to sun it when I have time. Even though the clan's bureaus use dharma power to maintain it, keeping it spotless, it just… lacks a certain something."

Li Zhouwei offered a word of praise. Li Xuanxuan sighed and sat down, shaking his head in sorrow. "A pity about Chenghao. Zhoufang hasn't been able to leave his house these days, completely overcome with grief. He has always been so diligent… I have never seen him like this."

Li Zhouwei was momentarily speechless. Li Chenghao had not been popular in the family, his cultivation was low, and all his children were dead. In the entire clan, only Li Zhoufang was still grieving for him so intensely.

Li Zhouwei could only reply, "This debt will be repaid, sooner or later. For now, we should arrange Jiangzong's affairs as soon as possible. That should provide some comfort to Big Brother."

Li Xuanxuan fell silent, then said in a hoarse voice, "You are a Daoist Master now. Your brothers and elders are all afraid of you. Not only do they not dare to speak with you, but they whisper behind his back that Zhoufang doesn't know what's good for him. Many of those people were promoted by him or received protection through his efforts. It's as if his decades of hard work meant nothing. It is good that you have this sentiment."

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flickered. "This junior understands."

He took a step forward, picked up the brush pen from the table, and smoothed a sheet of paper with his other hand. With a light touch, the brush moved like a dragon, swiftly writing a single vertical line of eight characters:

*'Great desire is emptiness; this enmity must be avenged.'*

As he finished writing, the paper immediately became soft and fine, like silk, glowing with a snow-white luster and a faint golden light. Li Zhouwei turned his head and said softly, "The family has delayed giving an order because they fear someone has surrendered to the Buddhists. They are afraid of praising him too highly, only to have it cause an uproar later. But since the old master has spoken, it is also wrong to simply ignore it. When I return to Gardenia Scenery Mountain, I will send this calligraphy to my uncle's grave."

Li Xuanxuan nodded and sighed. Li Zhouwei chatted for a few more moments, relaying the news about Bai Rong and inquiring about the old man's health. He did not leave from the courtyard but instead stepped into the Great Void, reappearing on Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

At this moment, Gardenia Scenery Mountain was covered in gardenias. The jade tables, usually empty, were now piled high with a dazzling array of dharma artifacts and cultivation arts. Beside them stood several large chests, filled with countless treasure medicines.

The Heavenly Light on the mountain was inherently bright; illuminated by all these treasures, the entire peak was truly glowing.

Li Zhouwei scanned the scene, knowing instantly that these were congratulatory gifts from various sects and cultivators. Anything that made it to Gardenia Scenery Mountain was no ordinary item. Most were from powers on the level of the Three Sects and Seven Gates, or from Purple Mansion rogue cultivators. The lesser gifts had, of course, been sent to the clan treasury.

'So lively! I wonder how many of them forced me out of the lake, and how many only stopped when they saw me enter the sea!'

He had not held a banquet and had used "secluded cultivation" as an excuse to refuse all Purple Mansion visitors. But this display wasn't because of some Jiangnan custom; it was because *everyone*—related and unrelated, from Jiangnan and Jiangbei—had come to offer congratulations. Judging by the sight before him, even after filtering out all the worthless items, the remaining gifts were far more substantial than those Li Ximing had received when he achieved his Dao.

The world was fickle, and human relationships were thinner than paper. When Li Ximing reached Foundation Establishment, he was a nobody, so when he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, people were still watching coldly, waiting for a show. Now, they were all shamelessly fawning over him. Even a few of the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions that prided themselves on their righteousness could not escape the custom, and their gifts were heavier than before.

He reached out, picked up the bound gift register, and read through it carefully.

'Everyone from all of Jiangbei and the Yue State, with the exception of the Changxiao Gate and the sealed Snow Wings Gate, has sent their respects. Even the devastated Sacred Writ Gate sent someone…'

'Outside the Yue State, there is Shahuan, Slaughter Jun, Jingyi… even Dingyang Zi from Qize sent a gift. There's even an unrelated Ni family from the Wu State…'

He read the list from top to bottom, from west to east; countless small clans had come to congratulate him. From north to south, innumerable small sects had sent their best wishes. Looking at the list, it seemed as though not a single person wished him ill.

'Never mind the enemies. Of the more amicable parties, only Chunyi, Southern Songzhou Luoshe, and a few others made no move. As for the gifts, only Slaughter Jun, the Xiao Family, and other close allies sent what was expected, without any particular extravagance…'

He raised his sleeve and, without ceremony, swept this first great haul into it. These items might not be of great value to a Purple Mansion cultivator, but they were more than enough to be used as rewards or to bestow upon subordinates.

As for the few chests of treasure medicines, they were not of much use to him, so he left them there for Li Ximing to use in alchemy.

He then placed the eight-character calligraphy into a jade box and dispatched someone to deliver it. He also asked after Li Ximing, learning that he had already taken a pill and entered seclusion.

Li Zhouwei thus remained on the mountain for several days, studying the Radiant Celestial Wave Art and the Arranged-Mansions Celestial Yang Escape Art. Light and darkness alternated, and time flowed by. Soon, Chen Yang came up to report, kneeling on the stone steps of the mountain.

Neither Li Zhouwei nor Li Ximing had any specific arrangements for such things, but as they were in high positions and their divine abilities were respected, their subordinates dared not be anything but thorough. When Li Ximing was on the mountain, Ding Weizeng would report. Now that Li Zhouwei was present, Chen Yang came.

The black-robed man knelt respectfully. "Reporting to the Daoist Master. The artisan from the Purple Smoke Gate has returned. The dharma artifact is repaired."

"Present it."

Li Zhouwei set down the jade slip in his hand. Two men worked together to carry the Grand Ascension up the steps. Its circular arc gleamed, bright and pure, instantly filling the mountain with a radiant, curved light.

The golden-eyed young man simply raised his hand. The Grand Ascension immediately flew up from its stand and landed obediently in his palm. The Daoist Master weighed it. "Not bad."

The damage to the Grand Ascension had not been severe; the blade had merely been slightly skewed. After being nourished by his divine ability for a time, repairing it had not required much effort. But with his simple approval, the artifact refiner could return and report his mission a success. He bowed deeply.

Li Zhouwei asked casually, "What of the Viewing Pavilion Platform? Have the people arrived?"

Chen Yang was perceptive and knew exactly what he was asking. "Daoist Master Qiuhu has already appeared at Azure Pond Mountain. After receiving the Daoist Master's letter, Chu Minglian arrived at the lake last night. He is currently awaiting your orders."

Li Zhouwei waved his hand, dismissing the Purple Smoke cultivator, who kept his head bowed low. "How are Daoist Master Qiuhu's injuries?"

When this topic was raised, Chen Yang immediately prostrated himself, lowering his voice. "It is said there are no unusual signs… however… the Azure Pond Sect has promoted Ning Wan's confidant, Lin Wuning, to be the Peak Master of Yuanxing Peak. The position of Peak Master of Qi-Plucking Peak was given to Lord Yuanqin. The personnel from the Eastern Sea have all returned… The previous Peak Master of Yuanxing Peak was a Ning family junior who made a complete mess of things. He was dismissed."

Li Zhouwei silently shook his head. "The Si family has few descendants, and Si Yuanli may not even come out of seclusion. Elder Qiuhu wants to cultivate a few Ning family members, but Elder Yuansu has no heirs. With Hejing and Heyuan dead, and a large batch of people purged, the spine of that faction has been broken… If Zhao Tinggui had lived to this day, there might have been a chance, but the situation is difficult to salvage now."

However, the Ning family's affairs were not his to manage. Ning Wan still had a long life ahead of her. As long as her divine ability did not fall, she would have plenty of time to promote her people. Hearing the good news about Ning Wan's health, Li Zhouwei tapped his cup, deep in thought.

'This one spirit embryo… it's not enough.'

The Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire was extremely useful. It allowed a Foundation Establishment cultivator to assist a Purple Mansion cultivator in the refining process. With the spiritual materials on hand, Li Zhouwei didn't even need to expend much energy. An occasional tap with his divine ability would be enough to forge a spirit embryo aligned with his own power.

But there were two problems. First, the spiritual materials were limited. Once this batch was used up, he would have to use his own divine ability to refine more, a process that would take over a decade and seriously delay his cultivation. Second, a spirit embryo was not like a Spiritual Artifact; it required constant nourishment from his divine ability. One was manageable, but any more than that would also impede his cultivation.

Li Zhouwei currently had two great treasures he had carried up from the Foundation Establishment Realm: the Grand Ascension and the Yuan'e. One was a weapon, the other a suit of armor. Both were suitable for nurturing a spirit embryo.

'The Grand Ascension definitely comes first. But the Yuan'e armor is no longer of much use to me as it is. It also needs to be refined. A spirit embryo consumes divine ability… it would be best if I could upgrade it to a Spiritual Artifact.'

He dismissed Chen Yang. Stepping through the Great Void, he arrived at the Viewing Pavilion Platform. With a gentle toss, he set the dharma artifact upon the high platform, his mind churning.

"Should I go and ask Hengzhu… or Golden Feather… And how could I possibly afford the price?"

A moment later, the burly, red-clothed old man had arrived on the platform. Facing Li Zhouwei, Chu Minglian was clearly not as relaxed as he was with Li Ximing. He bowed, nervous and subservient.

Li Zhouwei activated his divine ability. The platform was instantly bathed in golden light, enveloping the dharma artifact. He glanced to the side and noticed a young man standing properly beside Chu Minglian, who now looked rather excited. The young man bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

This young man was, of course, Li Jiangzong. Li Jiangqian had already arranged for him to study under this refining master, saving Li Zhouwei the trouble of giving the order. He now looked somewhat ashamed as he bowed again. "The Daoist Master's single letter cured my father's heart-sickness. This junior is endlessly grateful!"

Li Jiangzong found it difficult to understand his father's obsessive loyalty to their grand-uncle, Li Chenghao. As his own cultivation had risen, he had gradually entered the family's center of power. He was on a path of steady advancement and being entrusted with important duties; he was naturally mindful of the family's many kindnesses to him. His father's recent behavior had been an extreme headache, a thorn in his back. Yet, it was impossible to say his father was *wrong*, so he could only go along with Li Zhoufang's dramatics.

Fortunately, Li Zhouwei's eight-character calligraphy had been delivered to the gravesite. Li Zhoufang had spat out a large mouthful of blood and had finally begun to recover. Li Jiangzong's daily, agonizing headache was at last resolved, and his admiration for his Daoist Master uncle had grown even deeper.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him, appearing satisfied. He asked a few questions about his cultivation and said softly, "Apply yourself diligently. Reach Foundation Establishment soon."

He had just finished speaking when Ding Weizeng approached and whispered, 

"Reporting to the Daoist Master. A direct disciple from the Great Xiukui Monastery has been waiting at the lake for a long time. He refuses to leave, insisting he must see one of the lake's Purple Mansion cultivators."

Li Zhouwei frowned. "He *must* see a Daoist Master?"

Ding Weizeng nodded. Li Zhouwei could only sigh. "Then let him come up."

After all, the Great Xiukui Monastery had just sacrificed one of its Purple Mansion cultivators. Li Zhouwei still felt a measure of respect for them. As soon as he agreed, a black-robed man riding a gray wind approached from the distance, led by the lake patroller, Qu Bushi. He landed before them and bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Daoist Master Minghuang! This junior cultivator, Lin Ya of the Great Xiukui Monastery, has come on my master's orders to pay respects and offer congratulations!"

Li Zhouwei had not held a banquet, but he had already collected the gifts on the mountain. He frowned. "Daoist Master Zhaojing is healing, and I am in seclusion stabilizing my cultivation. We have not been active on the lake. We have made your esteemed monastery wait!"

"Not at all! We wouldn't dare!" Lin Ya hurriedly demurred, not daring to waste the Daoist Master's time with pleasantries. He immediately took a glittering golden box from his sleeve and said in a low voice, "My master heard that Daoist Master Zhaojing was injured and was extremely concerned. He specially ordered me to deliver two spirit pills, as a sign of the friendship and concern between our two clans."

He gently used his dharma power to open the lid. Inside lay two brilliant white pills etched with fine patterns. They were Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills!

The Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill had come from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. Its greatest effects were to advance cultivation and, crucially, to repair the dharma body. It was clearly a pill commonly used by the Purple Mansion cultivators of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, and the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions had acquired the most. Their clan had obtained three; the last one had been consumed by Li Ximing and was gone.

Li Zhouwei himself had used this very pill to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. He was extremely familiar with it. The pill's ability to heal the dharma body was incredibly enviable, and what's more, it was inherently of the Bright Yang Dao.

He began to voice a polite refusal, but the disciple from the Great Xiukui Monastery immediately adopted a look of terror, emphatically expressing the monastery's sincere goodwill. Only then did Qu Bushi step forward to receive the pills.

Having presented the gift, Lin Ya secretly let out a sigh of relief. He continued respectfully, "My master also bid me to inform the lake that the Gao family's Daoist Master has already left Chengyun Marsh. The Chengyun Gate has already submitted to the Huai River Dao and has sent its name to the Profound Governance Pavilion, acknowledging itself as a sect of the Zhao State."

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, though upon careful consideration, it was not particularly surprising.

Lin Ya continued, "It is said that King Bolie has now gone to the Capital immortals Dao and is meeting with Daoist Master Yehui within the sect."

The rest did not need to be said. With the Chengyun Gate setting a precedent, they were presumably also discussing the matter of allegiance. Li Zhouwei nodded. "I am aware. Thank you to your esteemed monastery for the reminder."

He watched Lin Ya ride the wind and depart, then tucked the box into his sleeve, his mind working.

'Yehui's judgment wasn't wrong; in fact, it was extremely precise. The Gao family coordinating with the Buddhist cultivators' push south was just a "good cop, bad cop" routine…'

'As for the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill… the Great Xiukui Monastery has explicitly stated that the pill recipe is in the hands of the Golden Feather Sect. They themselves are still using the Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill. While that pill has the advantage of being convenient and cheap, it cannot hold a candle to this one when it comes to healing the dharma body… It would be best if I could trade for the recipe from Golden Feather.'

He mulled this over, then glanced at Qu Bushi and said softly, "Is there any movement on the north shore?"

Qu Bushi replied quickly, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, there is no major movement from the north. However, every few days, a few Master Monks come south to harass us, attempting to bypass the lake for reconnaissance. They have clashed with the garrisoned cultivators on the north shore several times, but there have been no major casualties."

Li Zhouwei was not in a particular hurry to cultivate; his main priority was to master the few new Dharma Arts he possessed. Therefore, he had no special requirements for his cultivation location. He nodded.

"I will go to the north shore and stand guard."

But in his heart, he held a more hidden concern.

'If someone from Mount Luoxia wishes to see me, it would be best if they did not enter our great array. They shouldn't even get close to Pingya Island or the south shore… It would save a lot of trouble.'

…

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

The pavilion was brightly lit, with stone lamps casting circles of cool, clear light. Li Ximing sat within, slowly opening his eyes and exhaling a long breath of white mist.

The Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill was a spirit pill for healing the dharma body. Furthermore, his severed body parts had already been retrieved thanks to Yehui's favor, making the restoration process a hundred times simpler.

Added to that was the dense Spiritual Qi within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. In merely half a year, his dharma body was essentially healed. He stood up, feeling a sense of comfort and fluidity throughout his body. The stiffness and discordance that had plagued him were finally gone.

With a turn of his thoughts, he departed that space and reappeared within the lightning-wreathed Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda. He emerged to find a woman in a red dress sitting cross-legged outside the main hall, quietly waiting while cultivating.

It was Li Minggong, returned from Qize.

Hearing the stirring of his arrival, the woman immediately opened her eyes and said respectfully, "Junior has returned from Qize and has an important matter to report!"

Li Ximing, his dharma body fully repaired, was in an excellent mood. He smiled and nodded, raising a hand. A sheet of bright light gently lifted her to her feet. With a single step, he was back on the mountain.

Gardenia Scenery Mountain still had its familiar appearance of white flowers and jade tables. However, one glance was enough to see a brilliant light glowing from the distant Viewing Pavilion Platform, where the flames of creation burned bright. It was clear the process of forging the spirit embryo had begun. Li Ximing arrived leisurely, only to find several chests of treasure medicines at his feet.

"What is this…"

Li Minggong hurriedly explained, "These are the congratulatory spiritual items for Daoist Master Minghuang! The Daoist Master gave instructions to leave them for you, my lord, to use for alchemy."

Li Ximing clasped his hands behind his back and looked closely at the contents. He immediately sensed something was amiss and cursed, "A bunch of snobs! What? *Now* they know how to send proper gifts?"

Li Minggong was inherently intelligent and naturally understood his meaning. She had, after all, handled the congratulatory gifts when Li Ximing himself achieved his divine ability. Though those gifts had also been packed in chests, the quality of the treasure medicines had been nowhere near what lay before her now. She immediately lowered her gaze, saying nothing.

Fortunately, Li Ximing's flash of irritation passed. He motioned for her to sit and asked, "How did it go?"

Li Minggong quickly replied, "The Daoist Master was overjoyed and praised you endlessly, calling your alchemy skills truly divine… He immediately had his people retrieve the items and personally wrote a letter of thanks for me to bring back and present to you."

"Oh?" Li Ximing was not surprised. He watched her take out two jade boxes and a letter. With a flick of his finger, the letter flew into his hand. He began to read it carefully:

"…Fellow Daoist's skill in the Dao of alchemy… is truly the rarest I have seen in my life… a peerless talent… The quality of this pill is something I have never before witnessed! To use Bright Yang fire to refine a Pit Water pill… only a true grandmaster could accomplish such a feat…"

The letter went on, filled with page after page of flowery praise. The more he read, the stranger he felt. He couldn't help but laugh out loud, teasing the red-dressed woman beside him, "How boring! This must have been ghostwritten! That old stick-in-the-mud Dingyang Zi is far too stern and humorless. How could he possibly say such things!"

"He must have just pointed to a smooth-talking disciple and ordered him to write it!"

How could Li Minggong possibly dare to laugh at a joke between Daoist Masters? She shrank in on herself like a quail, eyes fixed on her own nose, silently praying for mercy. But as Li Ximing joked and scanned the letter, he suddenly froze.

It turned out the old fellow had included another request at the very end, swearing that there would be a generous reward, and had even attached the spiritual materials with the letter, begging for more treasure pills…

"So he's gotten a taste and has *this* in mind!"

He lightly tapped his finger. The jade boxes beside him flew open. One contained supplementary herbs, which he ignored. The other revealed glistening black scales. They were Cangzhou Serpent Scales! Three whole scales!

"That Dingyang Zi! He must have connections in Cangzhou!"

Li Ximing was startled, but then he laughed heartily. The last time had been a favor to help refine a spirit embryo. This time, he could openly demand payment. He immediately pulled out a brush and paper. As he wrote, he instructed Li Minggong, "You go and tell that Dingyang Zi that Bright Yang and Pit Water inherently clash. That last batch I sent him was a gesture of gratitude for him refining my spirit embryo. I was feeling generous and didn't want to disappoint his request, so I used a unique secret method and even threw in a considerable amount of my *own* Pit Water spiritual items to refine six pills! How can he expect that every time? He wants six pills again? That's not happening!"

Li Minggong nodded quickly, understanding that he was negotiating.

Li Ximing shook his head and continued, "You just go and give him this reply: for these three Cangzhou Serpent Scales, I will give him twelve pills, minimum. If he wants me to dip into my own family's stash of materials, I can give him fifteen, tops. He can decide for himself how he wants to repay me."

"Yes!"

Li Minggong accepted the letter he had written, bowed respectfully, and immediately flew off on her True Fire. Li Ximing, his mood steadily improving, summoned Ding Weizeng.

"Where is Minghuang?"

Ding Weizeng bowed quickly. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, he is currently standing guard on the north shore."

Li Ximing-nodded. He rose into the air on a beam of light. Closing his eyes, the vision he had seen in the grotto-heaven reappeared before his mind's eye: an endless expanse where sea and sky merged into one, a long chain of reefs, and a boundless stretch of azure blue.

'The Strait of Ten Thousand Isles!'



# Chapter 924: Profound Lake Primal Essence

The Strait of Ten Thousand Isles.

The Strait of Ten Thousand Isles was a maze of reefs lashed by tumultuous waves. Past the fragmented shoals, a chain of larger islands stretched into the distance. Cultivators occasionally descended to rest on them before continuing their journeys.

Li Ximing met Li Zhouwei on the northern shore to handle several matters. Afterward, he swiftly stepped through the Great Void. He feigned a search for a Spirit Fire, meandering through the Eastern Sea for some time to ensure he wasn't being followed. Only then, certain he was unobserved, did he follow the map to this location.

Before him lay a pair of islands, one large and one small. The smaller one resembled a deer's head, the larger its body, though the latter was misshapen, covered in jagged, imposing rocks that looked like a rugged helm.

The smaller island was called Deer Weeds (Lulai), the larger Long Helm (Changzhou). By the standards of the Strait, their area wasn't insignificant, but their remote location and faint spiritual activity left them obscure. The Li family, however, was familiar with them. The clan's history mentioned that Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong had once visited this place.

Yet, as Li Ximing peered from within the Great Void, he felt a flicker of surprise.

‘This place actually has quite a few signs of human activity.’

He turned his gaze. The island was dotted with numerous temples where monks bustled about. Although their cultivation levels were low, the place had an air of vitality. They called themselves the Earth Shelter Palace. Unfortunately, the spiritual activity was sparse, and only a single cultivator at the Embyronic Breathing stage presided over them.

This group was clearly isolated. They used the lofty title of 'Palace' yet were led by a mere Embyronic Breathing cultivator. Li Ximing descended, his gaze sweeping over them. He found that the entire Earth Shelter Palace possessed only three cultivation manuals, which, stacked together, were thinner than a quilt. As for their quality, they were so poor they wouldn't even suffice to prop up a wobbly table leg.

Stranger still, the Earth Shelter Palace worshipped a nondescript monk. They were clearly practicing some kind of 'Purple-Gold' technique, yet they claimed it was Buddhist Dharma and referred to their Embyronic Breathing leader as a 'Dharma Protector'.

Li Ximing had no desire to reveal his presence. He gave the area a cursory glance, retrieved one of their record books, and flipped through a few pages. The reason for the oddity quickly became clear.

‘My aunt and great-uncle visited this place long ago. Great-Uncle even killed a Master Monk named E'wu. The local mortals worshipped that monk, and the tradition was passed down, twisting into its current form.’

‘Originally, it was mostly earth-nurtured children, who raised mortals to cultivate alongside them. But after several uprisings, they were almost all wiped out. The spiritual objects became fewer and fewer, and the place was gradually taken over by mortal cultivators.’

It didn't look like Buddhist cultivators had set up a foothold here; it was just a coincidence. He silently breathed a sigh of relief, stepped into the Great Void, and traversed the earth veins, heading ever deeper.

He descended deep underground. Soon, the water veins and earth veins began to intertwine. Li Ximing suddenly felt a disturbance within the Great Void. He probed ahead and behind, but something felt wrong in both directions. Realization dawned.

‘There must be an anomaly in the spiritual activity here. I can't maintain my footing in the Great Void!’

So, after a quick estimation, he stepped out of the Great Void, materializing within the earth veins. Heavenly Light flashed around him, and the black stone immediately disintegrated, melting to create a small cavern just large enough for him to stand in.

This place directly faced the earth veins, and for a moment, roiling Baleful Qi washed over him. Li Ximing focused his gaze. He was surrounded by black stone on all sides. He immediately formed a hand seal, transformed into a bright light, and followed the earth veins downward. Soon, the space suddenly opened up, revealing a vast, dark, and lightless cavern.

The cavern was immense. From its ceiling hung countless pitch-black stalactites, sharp as fangs. The floor was a vast, dark lake, its surface broken by the slender tips of innumerable stalagmites rising from the unknown depths.

The cavern was saturated with an incredibly dense Baleful Qi, so thick that not a trace of other spiritual activity remained in the air. The Baleful Earth within this cave formed a complete, self-contained cycle, punctuated only by the occasional echo of dripping water.

‘No wonder the Great Void couldn't perceive this place.’

This lake of Baleful Qi surrounded a central stone platform. A deep blue halo of light enveloped the platform, where the doors to a cave-dwelling stood tightly sealed, appearing profound and mysterious in the gloomy air.

Li Ximing restrained his divine ability, lowered his gaze to look closely, and his eyes immediately lit up with joy:

‘This lake is Dark-Seal Baleful Liquid... it's a secondary spiritual item formed when a Baleful Earth Coldspring encounters the qi of Pit Water and is diluted... That means the source of a Baleful Earth Coldspring must be at the bottom of this lake...’

A Baleful Earth Coldspring was a spiritual water of the Foundation Establishment Realm. But a spring's source wasn't like other items. As long as the source here wasn't destroyed, it would continuously produce Baleful Earth Coldspring. Even if it took a long time to produce one portion, this was still an excellent find!

He didn't rush to dive into the lake. Instead, he stepped out over the water and reached out, lightly touching the deep blue radiance. A hazy black aura immediately surged forth, clearly the fluctuation of a defensive array.

‘A Purple Mansion Realm spirit array!’

This spirit array was not like the Li family's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array over their lake. It wasn't built to be a massive sect-guarding array; it was small, exquisite, and full of ancient charm.

‘It's really still here...’

He felt a flash of joy. He extended a finger, gently hooked a wisp of the deep blue radiance, and studied it in his hand, nodding to himself:

‘A spirit array of the Water Mansion Dao. How strange. It's often said that Water Mansion is water of black and white, yet this one has a deep blue glow. There must be something unusual about it.’

Breaching this array would be no easy task. But Li Ximing wasn't flustered. He closed his eyes, held one hand before his Shengyang Acupoint, and his figure vanished. An instant later, he reappeared, a jade box already in his hand.

From the jade box, he took out a small pearl, the size of a fingernail, and held it steadily in front of him.

The small pearl suddenly melted. Streaks of stark white light leaped from it, resonating with the radiance of the great array. The array's colors immediately began to fade, and it trembled slightly.

This small pearl had a special purpose. It was condensed from a wisp of aura. Lu Jiangxian's divine sense had long ago penetrated this array, and relying on the domineering power of that divine sense, had carved a trace of this same aura onto the array disc!

Now that it was brought out, the array's radiance faded as if it recognized its master, allowing Li Ximing to drift calmly into its center. Seeing this, he became even more certain:

‘This cave-dwelling was indeed left behind by a celestial figure!’

As he set foot before the doors, he saw a plaque above, bearing three words:

Wave-Suppressing Mansion.

The tightly sealed stone doors boomed and swung wide open. Inside was a white mist, rich with spiritual activity and incomparably pure Spiritual Qi, but it was all locked in by a translucent curtain of light at the entrance, unable to surge out.

With the array undone, the cave-dwelling was practically undefended. Li Ximing stepped inside. His eyes fell upon a spacious, round hall. At the far end, on a raised platform, sat a high table. Behind it, a massive mural covered the wall, painted with exceptionally strange patterns.

The circular mural dominated the chamber, its patterns sprawling across the wall and up to the apex of the ceiling. It depicted a magnificent, esoteric scene: a giant turtle and a soft-shelled turtle entwined, a grand tapestry of interwoven black and white.

The intense colors of the mural converged, focusing the hall's entire ambiance onto the main seat. Above, the remaining wisps of black and white swirled at the ceiling's peak, casting down a shimmering radiance that shattered into countless specks of light on the floor.

Three tables were set on both the left and right sides, arranged in descending order. All the tables and wine vessels were crafted from a deep blue material inlaid with gold patterns, creating a powerful sense of depth. They gleamed with a faint, cold light, radiating an air of profound luxury.

Li Ximing suppressed his faint shock. A single glance told him the tables were made of Deep Mansion Blue-Gold. Nowadays, this kind of spiritual material was used to forge daggers and blades. For the cave's owner to use it for furniture spoke volumes of their wealth.

The center of the hall had been excavated into a circular pool, lined with exquisite jade. A spiritual liquid, flashing with white light, rippled within it, constantly releasing wisps of white mist that replenished the Spiritual Qi in the cave.

Li Ximing stepped forward and swept his gaze over it:

‘In the pool is Wall-Sinking Water, another spiritual item of the Water Mansion Dao. High-level cultivators usually use it for quenching during artifact refinement... The owner of this cave was likely no simple character. Could they have been an artifact refiner...’

‘But... I've only heard of the Secret Enclosure Daoist tradition's method of using Water Mansion for pill refinement. Back then, Li Encheng gained great renown from it. I never considered using Water Mansion for artifact refinement...’

The central table was raised higher than the others. Li Ximing, pushing aside his thoughts, landed lightly before it, his gaze sweeping across its surface.

A jade box was placed neatly on the table. Li Ximing merely glanced at it, and the moment his fingers touched it, he knew what it contained.

A Purple Mansion Realm spiritual water! A Purple Mansion spiritual water of the Water Mansion Dao!

Only a cave-dwelling of this caliber could possibly contain such a thing!

Li Ximing exhaled excitedly. He carefully lifted the jade box, first enveloping it with his divine ability before slowly opening the lid. Inside was a deep navy blue, revealing a miniature lake.

The lake's colors were varied, deep and shallow. Lotus flowers bloomed, and reeds swayed. Even more incredibly, rice-sized white egrets soared back and forth over the lake's surface, pure white and with feathers so distinct they looked alive.

As his gaze fell upon it, the reflection of a rising sun appeared on the lake's surface. Then, all the visions shattered at once, reverting to a clear, azure ripple of water—the spiritual water's true form.

Li Ximing recognized it at a glance:

cave Egret Origin Water!

The Li family lived on a lake. Although they had no Water Mansion legacy, Moongaze Lake was once one of the world's most renowned great marshes. There were countless records and legends about it, making Water Mansion items, paradoxically, easy for them to recognize!

The most detailed record of cave Egret Origin Water was in the *Two Hundred Years of Linghai Prefecture*, a book gifted by the Xiao family. cave Egret Origin Water was also called Profound Lake Primal Essence. The Snow Wings Gate once had a major upheaval over this item, so the book's entry, aside from a description, read:

‘A species of Profound Giant Turtle, commands Lake Demons. Firstborn white, red at ten years, azure at one hundred. Every three hundred years, it produces one, spitting forth Profound Lake Primal Essence. It can stabilize a lake, allowing one to observe transformations. If consumed on the new moon, it greatly benefits Lesser Yin Baleful Qi and grants an eye upon the cheek.’

Although the *Two Hundred Years of Linghai Prefecture* was a Xiao family legacy text, it wasn't a specialized bestiary of spiritual items. It only mentioned these few lines, but it was enough for the Li family to remember this item well.

‘cave Egret Origin Water... There are few profound Water Mansion Daoist traditions left in the world, making this thing even more precious. Not to mention... this is likely something that certain Daoist traditions covet desperately.’

He was thrilled. He silently stored the item in his sleeve, his heart filled with emotion:

‘It's only by this kind of chance that I could obtain an item of this grade! All those cultivators out in the world, don't they all hide their techniques and treasures behind powerful arrays? It's hard enough to kill them, let alone dream of taking their possessions!’

One had to know, this cave was sealed tightly by a Purple Mansion Realm array. While it wasn't vast and sprawling like a sect-guarding array, its quality was extremely high—small but formidable. If he had been alone, he might not have been able to break it at all!

Even if he had forced the array open, the treasure-land and the items in the cave might not have survived. Without that pearl given by the 'heavens', he would probably be staring helplessly at this array right now.

He suppressed his excitement, dissolved into light, and his spiritual sense swept out. He quickly checked the various entrances leading off the main hall, only to find them all tightly sealed. He immediately began to scan the area.

‘Where is the array disc?!’

The cave was so tidy, with no sign of disarray. It was highly likely the owner hadn't died unexpectedly outside, but had left in an organized manner. To be blunt, in such cave-dwellings, the most valuable item nine times out of ten was the array disc itself.

He had already obtained the extremely rare cave Egret Origin Water. Although a Purple Mansion Realm array was less rare than the Origin Water, its value was only a step below. Even if he wanted to explore further, he first had to refine the array disc and place his, Li Ximing's, mark on it. Otherwise, he'd be blocked at every turn!

But he looked around the entire hall. The white mist drifted through the empty space, but there was no sign of an array console. Li Ximing had no choice but to close his eyes slightly and call upon the Immortal Mirror.

He had barely closed his eyes for an instant before it hit him. He strode forward, returning to the high table. He didn't linger, but passed it, immediately looking at the massive mural behind it. He gently reached out his hand.

The back of the Profound Giant Turtle was stark white, covered in extremely complex patterns. As his divine ability slowly made contact with the turtle's shell, the mist-like white surface began to glow, revealing a deep blue, circular disc covered in profound patterns.

It was the array disc for the cave's great array, embedded right into the wall!

‘How cautious... what a method! It seems the original owner didn't even trust those who could enter the array. They specifically nested it, embedding the array disc within the array's own protective concealment...’

Li Ximing was thoughtful. He placed one hand on the array disc and circulated his divine ability. Flakes of Heavenly Light poured into it, dyeing it a faint gold. After about a quarter of an hour, the radiance in the cave flickered. The Purple Mansion Realm array had changed masters!

‘It's mine!’

Now that he controlled the array disc, the array's name and its wondrous functions gradually surfaced in his mind:

Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array!

This was also a Purple Mansion Realm spirit array, but its functions and power were completely different from his family's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. This array had three wondrous functions: Trial of the Pit, Spirit-Storing, and Profound Mansion.

The Trial of the Pit function was extremely odd. The array had an aperture deep underground related to Pit Water, from which a certain qi of Pit Water could endlessly surge. From what Li Ximing could see, this was almost certainly the source of the transformation that created the Baleful Earth Coldspring outside.

The Spirit-Storing function was the purpose of the central pool. Over time, it would continuously condense Wall-Sinking Water. Once the pool was full, which took a hundred years, it would condense into a single portion of White Feather Spirit Resource.

The final function, Profound Mansion, would normally gather the surrounding earth veins, water veins, and spirit veins, twisting them into a single strand to form the 'Base of the Profound Mansion', enhancing the area's spiritual activity. When an intruder attacked, it could transfer all damage taken by the array onto this Base.

In other words, of these three wondrous functions, none were for active offense. Even the final defensive function seemed perfunctory, like an afterthought. This shocked Li Ximing:

‘The purpose of this cave's functions is too obvious. Every single one was built according to the owner's will, for a specific goal. If the owner could truly just point and demand a function, and the array master could create it, then that array master was absolutely no ordinary practitioner!’

‘Condensing a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource... just hearing about such a thing is enough to make one burn with desire... It's beyond the comprehension of people today!’

It was also because the functions were so specialized. Even someone like him, who didn't understand arrays, could see that Trial of the Pit and Spirit-Storing were both built upon the final Profound Mansion function. All the transformations relied on the interaction between the local earth veins, water veins, and spirit veins. If the location changed, the first two functions would likely fail.

Comparing it again to his family's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array, Li Ximing gained an even deeper understanding. He stared quietly at the array disc, his heart filled with emotion:

‘The family's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array is a Purple Mansion Realm array *for the Li clan*. This one is a Purple Mansion Realm array *for a Purple Mansion Realm individual*. They serve different purposes. How could they possibly be the same?’

Li Ximing Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Purple Mansion Alchemist



# Chapter 925: Feathers from Beneath the Neck

Li Ximing immediately rose and landed on the central white pool. Filled with anticipation, he reached out his hand, his spiritual sense connecting with the great array.

"Rise!"

The surface of the white pool rippled instantly. Faintly, the two characters for "Feather Transformation" lit up at the bottom. Six streams of light surged forth, tumbling over each other to land in his palm, where they solidified into six long, pure-white feathers.

Each feather was six inches long and perfectly white. Though they were feathers, they felt like a single, seamless piece, as if cast from silver. Their edges were extraordinarily sharp. Under the faint, ambient glow of the cave mansion's dharma power, the surface of the feathers revealed a pattern of fine, dense scales, shimmering like a rippling current.

A Water Mansion-type Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource: Neck Feathers!

Li Ximing quickly retrieved a jade box and carefully placed the six Neck Feathers inside. He then drew up a small amount of Wall-Sinking Water and gently added it to the box to nourish the spiritual resource.

Strangely, once removed from the pool, the Wall-Sinking Water turned perfectly clear and transparent. It made the six feathers in the box gleam even more brilliantly, the water shifting as if alive.

With the six Neck Feathers in hand, Li Ximing felt even more content. Although he did not cultivate the Water Mansion path, Neck Feathers were Purple Mansion Realm resources nonetheless, and six was by no means a small number.

He lowered his gaze and began to calculate.

'Six white feathers represent six hundred years. The Wall-Sinking Water in the pool is at seventy percent, so that's seventy years. A total of six hundred and seventy years... Six hundred and seventy years ago, the Yuan family fled south to Jiangnan, and the Azure Pond Sect had only just been founded... To think there was a Water Mansion cultivator of such profound skill back then!'

He crossed the pool and once again communicated with the array. A crisp, chiming sound, like crystal, echoed from all around. On the smooth walls of the great hall, six ornate doors materialized, each facing a different direction.

These were the other side halls.

Li Ximing stepped into the first one. It was a long corridor that opened into its own separate space. His spiritual sense swept the area, counting sixteen small chambers apparently used for storing spirit items. Every chamber was empty and spotless. The first one showed faint traces of bottles and jars, but the remaining rooms were sealed, untouched by even a speck of dust. He couldn't tell if they had never been used or had simply been cleared out long ago.

Li Ximing entered the first chamber and sorted through it. In the end, he only found two small boxes of White Partridge Origin Spring. This was a Foundation Establishment Realm-level Water Mansion fluid, adept at nourishing other items. Back then, Tinglan's Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness had been preserved using this very substance. The boxes were empty now, clear proof that whatever they had held was long gone.

'The master of this Wave-Suppressing Mansion seems to have had no disciples or descendants,' he thought. 'He'd rather build sixteen storage rooms and use only one, without leaving a single cultivation abode for his juniors...'

'But now that it's fallen into my family's hands, we can make some modifications when our people arrive. We can convert these sixteen spirit storehouses into proper cultivation abodes for the younger generation to use.'

He stepped out and moved to the adjacent hall. A wave of intense heat washed over him. This was a forging workshop, built from black stone and bricks. A large artifact furnace stood in the center, surrounded by various spirit tools hanging from the walls. A stream of pure black Water Mansion fluid trickled down, following glowing patterns etched into the floor.

To the side was another small pool, clearly intended for quenching. The Wall-Sinking Water within it was strikingly different from the pool in the main hall; it was crystal clear, with a faint azure tint.

'It really is a Water Mansion artifact forging method. This black liquid must be Wushe Spirit Water. Out in the world, people use this to practice Dharma Arts or store it in spirit bottles and dharma artifacts for combat...'

Li Ximing knew little about artifact forging, so he gave the room a cursory glance. Finally, his eyes landed on a long, ink-black saber submerged in the quenching pool.

He only needed that single glance to understand.

"An ancient dharma artifact. Most likely, it's a degenerated spirit embryo."

He stored it away and mentally ran through the list of Water Mansion cultivators in Jiangnan's Purple Mansion Realm. An idea quickly formed.

'Senior Chen Yin cultivates the Water Mansion path. Although his Daoist tradition is no longer passed down, there really aren't any other Water Mansion experts at the Purple Mansion Realm. I must go and see him!'

He quickly moved to the next hall, which was the personal rear chamber of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion's master.

Compared to the opulence of the main hall, this place felt spartan. Though spacious, it was no larger than a courtyard. Most of it was paved with simple, ancient bluestone bricks. The furnishings were ordinary; there was no bed, making it feel more like a study. On the desk, a simple ink brush rested on a single sheet of paper.

Li Ximing's gaze swept over the elegant, flowing script.

"Deep winter conceals weakness; flourishing lakes gather form. This is the nature of Water Mansion. With Cold Qi and Valley Water both present, how can the Water Mansion path not be proven? My only regret is that the *Yu* seized the *Yuan*, the Profound Giant Turtle lost its vastness, and from that day, our natures could never merge!"

The characters were pure black, emitting not the slightest trace of light. Yet the white paper—made of some unknown material—seemed like polished white jade, its curled edges suffused with a soft halo.

The desk was otherwise empty, save for this brush and paper. Directly in front of them lay a jade slip. It was not sealed or locked, but it contained only a Qi Refining method. Li Ximing probed it with his spiritual sense and recognized it immediately.

*River and Stream One Qi Art*—which grants the Immortal Foundation 'Vast Ocean'!

Li Ximing stared at the handwriting. He silently took out a jade box, lifted the paper, which felt more like a jade tablet, and placed it inside. He gazed at it for a long time.

'How can the Water Mansion path not be proven? My only regret is that the *Yu* seized the *Yuan*, the Profound Giant Turtle lost its vastness, and from that day, our natures could never merge!'

'Vast Ocean' was the foundation achieved by the Li family's first Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Ancestor Li Tongya. It wasn't just Li Ximing; every cultivator in the Li family knew the description by heart:

'The Pit Water's 'Vast Ocean', anciently called the 'Jing Dragon King'... This must be the 'vastness' he was talking about!'

'*Yu*... so one of the aspects of Pit Water was originally *Yu*. The records state: "In the streams and ridges of Jiangnan, there is a water-shooting, inch-long insect. It attacks a person's shadow with its qi, killing them without remedy." That... does seem to fit...'

Pit Water was always known as the water of difficult streams and gullies. Li Ximing was accustomed to this and had never questioned it. But looking at it now, something felt wrong.

'Why change the name? How could Pit Water ever be known for its 'vastness'? A change must have occurred. Water Mansion is known as the path of lakes and marshes. Now, the lakes and marshes are withered, which aligns perfectly with 'lost its vastness'...'

'I've just never heard of any clear suppression or conflict between Pit and Mansion. I've only heard that Pit and Converging Water can be reconciled using Harmonising Metal. But there is no known method to harmonize Pit Water and Water Mansion.'

He felt a creeping chill. Though his Dao-Profundity wasn't exceptionally high, he understood the implications.

'Pit Water stole the 'vastness' from Water Mansion. The 'Vast Ocean'... Given the domineering and solitary nature of the Dragon-kin, how could they possibly tolerate another Daoist tradition claiming the title 'Vast Ocean'? If Senior Xiao ever tries to certify his Pit Water path, the Dragon-kin are almost certain to become a problem!'

His gaze flickered, finally settling on the jade slip before him.

'*River and Stream One Qi Art*... Even if it's not connected to the Lingyu Gate, it *is* connected to the Ning State's Chen Clan. And as it happens, Chen Yin cultivates the Water Mansion path. Although the two Chen clans are not one and the same, the pieces still line up!'

The implications left him silent. The Xiao family and the Chen Clan had an ambiguous history, their ancestors sharing many connections. It seemed everything was rooted in the distant past. He dimly foresaw the immense hardships awaiting Xiao Chuting on his path. Wordlessly, he exited the hall and moved on.

Of the three remaining halls, one was completely empty. There was nothing but a circular, altar-like decoration on the floor, painted with water patterns, which was also empty. Li Ximing pondered this and formed a hypothesis.

"A spirit tree was once planted here. The master of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion must have taken it with him when he left..."

Another hall was a scripture pavilion. Though beautifully decorated, its master had clearly neglected it. Not only was the space small, but the shelves were bare. It didn't look as though they had been emptied, but rather as if nothing had ever been placed on them at all.

Having found nothing in these two, Li Ximing finally arrived at the profound gate standing opposite the forging workshop. He pushed it open, his heart brimming with hope.

It was, indeed, the alchemy hall!

The space was vast, adorned with Water Mansion patterns. In the center stood a towering, pagoda-like alchemy furnace of blue and gold. At its six corners, statues of roaring Profound Giant Turtles, each three or four times the size of a man, faced the furnace, their mouths emitting a faint glow.

The moment he stepped inside, the hall lit up. Lamps ignited with the undulating light of a lake, their reflections intertwining, bathing the entire hall in shimmering, watery light.

"What a furnace!"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He strode forward and placed a hand on the furnace, sensing it carefully.

'It's just as I thought: a Water Mansion alchemy method...'

The central furnace was named Vast Lake. It wasn't a single dharma artifact, but rather a construct of several components, each forged as a separate dharma artifact, then assembled into this massive furnace. It was linked to the formations, creating a complex alchemy array system embedded into the hall itself.

The six roaring Profound Giant Turtle statues were also part of the system. If Li Ximing guessed correctly, the moment the furnace was activated, the six statues would spew Water Mansion fluid, channeling it to the central furnace to aid in the refinement process.

'If the mansion's original master used a Water Mansion technique to refine pills, this furnace is likely on par with the Purple Mansion Realm level. For ordinary fire refinement, it would be far inferior, but it's still leagues beyond the Treasure Elephant Cauldron.'

He circled the Vast Lake alchemy array, treasuring the sight. He was stunned.
'Did this mansion belong to more than one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? Unless one was simply born with the knowledge, how could a single person achieve such mastery in both alchemy *and* artifact forging!'

He walked down from the furnace platform, deeply satisfied. He fought back the strong urge to fire it up for a test run.

"Although this furnace is for Water Mansion use, it probably won't harmonize well with my Pit Water. It'll be hard to fleece Dingyang Zi a second time with this... but it will certainly be useful in the future."

Loaded with gains, he pushed open the door of the alchemy hall and returned to the main chamber. The Spiritual Qi here wasn't as rich as in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, but it was still an extravagant luxury for the clan's younger generations.

He smiled as he arrived before the rippling Feather Transformation Pool and pondered for a moment.

'The Spirit-Storing marvel is wondrous. It can condense Wall-Sinking Water, filling the pool over a hundred years, and then transform it into the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource, Neck Feathers.'

His expression grew thoughtful. He vanished from the spot, reappearing in the artifact hall. Moments later, he returned, holding the water from the quenching pool, now condensed into a sphere of Wall-Sinking Water in his palm.

Li Ximing flicked his finger. The sphere of Wall-Sinking Water immediately sank, pouring entirely into the Feather Transformation Pool!

'Must I really wait for it to condense on its own? Can't I just collect Wall-Sinking Water and pour it in myself?!'

It worked. As the water level rose, the pool's contents began to dilute. The clear, transparent Wall-Sinking Water turned a milky white the moment it entered the pool. The mansion's array roared to life, the Base of the Profound Mansion began to condense its power, and its profound marvels permeated the water.

Based on the array's feedback, Li Ximing estimated that this new batch of Neck Feathers would finish condensing in just one year!

His joy was written all over his face. He stared at the pool with unconcealed excitement.

"So *this* is how it's meant to be used! Otherwise, who could possibly wait a hundred years? How many centuries does a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator even have!"

"This is a true money-tree! It's equivalent to a Purple Mansion Realm spirit tree, endlessly producing spiritual resources. Even a Purple Mansion Realm spirit tree isn't guaranteed to produce one resource every single year! *This* is the true power of this marvel. This is its real purpose!"

"It can't create them from nothing, of course. It still requires a significant amount of Wall-Sinking Water. Over time, the price will inevitably rise. The key is to find a massive, stable source... But what an incredible boon, to convert a low-tier spirit item into a Purple Mansion Realm resource! This so-called Wall-Sinking Water... I used to think it was just a waste of space in my storage bag!"

He admired his work for a while longer, then studied the entire mansion one last time, inside and out. Finally, he brought himself to leave. The stone door sealed behind him. He stood for a moment, staring at the words Wave-Suppressing Mansion as he gathered his thoughts.

'The connection to the Ning State Chen Clan is unavoidable. But regardless, my family *must* station troops on Long Helm Island.'

After all, this Purple Mansion Realm array was bound to the land; it was impossible to move. He feared that even all the array masters of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition working together could not guarantee the array's marvels would still function if relocated. The only option was to send people here.

"Besides, there's that baleful lake outside. It isolates Spiritual Qi, acting as a natural barrier against Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

He transformed into a streak of light, not forgetting the spring eye of the Baleful Earth Coldspring within the lake. He plunged into the water and, just as before, saw thick black ice forming at the bottom. The Pit Water qi, manifested by the Trial of the Pit marvel, blew like a rolling gray wind across the ice, continuously transforming the Baleful Earth Coldspring into Dark-Seal Baleful Liquid.

But it was only on this second look that he realized a shocking truth: the so-called Base of the Profound Mansion for the Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array *was* the Baleful Earth Coldspring spring eye! The water veins, earth veins, and spirit veins were all merged into one. The Baleful Earth Coldspring and the baleful lake were, in fact, *products* of this Base!

'He didn't build the array here because of a natural baleful lake. He used the array's profound marvels to *create* this lake over the centuries! This Spiritual Qi-void barrier was part of his plan from the very beginning!'

'What's more, the three veins are merged as one. If anyone tried to shatter this array by force, the entire mansion would collapse. Forget the Grotto Egret Profound Water, even the main halls wouldn't survive! This level of array artistry is simply divine!'

Li Ximing observed the Base of the Profound Mansion in utter disbelief, sighing with emotion.

'This is the handiwork of a celestial figure! Never mind anyone else, even if Daoist Master Zipei—the one with the highest Dao-Profundity in all of Jiangnan—came to set this array, she probably couldn't achieve such a masterful, harmonious, and natural integration!'

He scanned the area a few more times. His spiritual sense estimated there were three or four portions of Baleful Earth Coldspring under the black ice, but no other treasures to speak of. He transformed into light and traveled through the earth veins, emerging on the surface moments later.

Outside, the night wind was strong, and the sea was a sheet of black. Pinpricks of light dotted the island. His mood was excellent. He soared into the sky and began the journey back.

His official excuse for leaving had been to travel to the Southern Borderlands in search of a spirit fire. He couldn't just return to the lake so quickly. He still had ample time. He entered the Great Void, looped around to the southwest, and flew toward the Southern Borderlands.

# Chapter 926: The Valiant King

The river waters howled as a furious storm gathered on the banks. Monks from the north, like a dense swarm of black dots, swarmed the grounds surrounding a dark, foreboding temple.

A young man clad in crimson armor rode a stream of fire toward them. He paused briefly outside the grand defense array before ascending quickly to Cold Cloud Peak. In the gloom of the storm, the plum blossoms looked withered and weak. A tall Daoist Master stood before the courtyard, his gaze heavy and profound.

"Father."

Li Jiangqian bowed, his voice respectful. His golden eyes were grave. The moment his words faded, another pair of golden eyes turned from the shadows. Li Jiangqian met that gaze for an instant, and then both looked away. Only then did he hear his father’s voice.

"How goes it?"

Li Jiangqian completed his salute and replied, "Reporting to Father, Jiangxia has gathered his forces and converged with the people from Muquan and Purple Smoke. They have made camp in the Wilderness. Daoist Master Tinglan came personally."

"Good."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

The two shores were now locked in a standoff. Master Monks and their lesser brethren frequently crossed south to conduct raids and harassment. Li Jianglong was assigned to guard the northern bank, Jiangxia had gone to the Wilderness, and Li Jiangqian was stationed on the lake. Each had their duty.

After reporting, however, Li Jiangqian paused. He spoke again, this time with marked hesitation.

"We... we received word from Fourth Brother. He is in the Simin Prefecture... and is on his way back."

Li Zhouwei had five sons known to the world. Three had already succeeded in the Foundation Establishment Realm and held positions of importance. This fourth son, Li Jiangliang, was also a man of outstanding talent, gifted since birth. He had been personally tutored by Cui Jueyin from a young age and was now at the point where he, too, could break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Yet, he was fond of traveling and rarely spent time at home.

Li Zhouwei had been in seclusion for many years, only returning after his breakthrough to the Daoist Master realm. It was only because of this that the boy was finally, and perhaps reluctantly, making his way back to the lake. Li Zhouwei rarely interfered in his children's choices and had simply let him be. But seeing Li Jiangqian’s strange expression, he said flatly:

"Speak."

Li Jiangqian lifted the hem of his robes and knelt.

"We hear," he said in a low voice, "that Fourth Brother is bringing a woman back with him. Her surname is Yang... It is our failure that we did not learn of this sooner. We only understood when he sent a personal letter. Father, please forgive our negligence!"

Li Zhouwei’s brow finally furrowed slightly. He turned his head. "Which Yang?"

Li Jiangqian kept his head low. "Reporting to Father... she is of the imperial lineage."

Li Zhouwei’s eyes narrowed. "Then you can hardly be blamed," he said softly.

The Yang clan was not just of imperial descent; they were one of the few families with clear, confirmed ties to the Underworld. The existence of Yang Tianya was still a secret to the outside world! It was possible it was mutual affection, but Li Zhouwei found it hard to believe this was some simple, accidental romance. He could only compose his expression and nod.

"Imperial lineage is fine. It is, naturally, a good match."

Beside them, Li Jianglong kept his eyes downcast, while Li Jiangqian remained in a silent bow. It was clear that both of them were deeply uncomfortable.

Li Chenghuai had left home to pursue his cultivation. On the surface, this was to receive his father's protection and seek a grander path on the Dao. But from another angle, was it not also a move by the Li family to weaken the Yang family's influence? Yang Xiao'er had been exceptionally good to Li Xizhi, yet Li Xizhi had never wanted the Yang's influence to touch Moongaze Lake. Many of his arrangements, it seemed, were designed to kill multiple birds with one stone.

Allowing Li Chenghuai to leave the lake was, yes, part of his desire to seek the Dao, but it was hard to believe this other consideration wasn't also a factor. Zhouluo was already half-subordinated to Azure Pond's command. It wasn't until Li Jiangchun's birth that things had relaxed, and the idea of letting a child stay and serve on the lake had returned.

But now, this... this move of acting first and reporting later naturally made the Li family's leadership sensitive. The Underworld's status was simply too lofty—it was the primary reason The Unsurpassed in the north had not yet crossed the river. The Li and Yang families had always been close, making it difficult to protest.

"After all," Li Zhouwei said softly, "the north is aggressive. The Yang family also means well. A marriage connection like this only serves to show the closeness between our two families."

At this, both Li Jiangqian and Li Jianglong managed a smile and voiced their agreement. Li Zhouwei put away the jade slip in his hand, sinking into his own thoughts.

'Both the Radiant Celestial Wave Art and the Arranged-Mansions Celestial Yang Escape Art are spell arts that strongly complement Audience with the Celestial Gate. They both feel like clever shortcuts, so their future potential for development is limited. But at least the cultivation speed isn't slow. I've mastered the entry-level for both.'

Cultivating these two spell arts had felt surprisingly natural, as if water flowing into a pre-carved channel. Perhaps it was due to the many secret methods he had cultivated in his past, granting him a much deeper understanding of the Bright Yang. He quietly stored the knowledge away.

'Pondering in a vacuum is extremely time-consuming. Since I've already reached the entry-level, I'll naturally have opportunities in combat to help me comprehend them further. That will be enough.'

As he was musing, Li Que'wan approached, holding a jade box. She bowed nearby, offering it with both hands. "Reporting to the Daoist Master," she said respectfully, "the three types of Spiritual Qi have been collected."

Li Zhouwei looked slightly surprised, raising an eyebrow. "So fast."

For his future cultivation, Li Zhouwei had once again prioritized movement techniques. The Li Fire art, Tread on Flames, was certainly powerful, but it wasn't his first choice.

He was, after all, different from Li Ximing. Li Ximing had received the empowerment of Valley Wind Guide-Fire, giving him extremely strong control over all types of flames—a level of mastery few cultivators in the world could match. Cultivating Tread on Flames was naturally far easier for him. Li Zhouwei, however, had received the empowerment of Illuminating Sun and Moon. What he needed to elevate in the future was his Dao-Profundity in the Bright Yang. The more Bright Yang methods he cultivated, the greater the benefit when his Dao-Profundity eventually increased. If he chose a Li Fire Movement technique, he would find it very difficult to reap that benefit.

Thus, he had meticulously searched the High Firmament Pavilion within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. He had searched for a Bright Yang Movement technique for a long time but had been mostly dissatisfied. But that search *had* led him to something else: a fifth-grade Pure Qi spell art, the Profound Vastness Art!

This art cultivated Pure Qi. When the cultivator was unharmed, it would be nurtured within the Great Void. When injured, it would use the Pure Qi to heal. If one's physical body perished, one could even use the Shengyang Acupoint to escape with the aid of the Pure Qi. Li Zhouwei had been overjoyed.

He wasn't interested in its miraculous life-saving properties. Rather, he coveted its ability to use Pure Qi for healing.

His Dharma body was outstanding, but this also meant it was far more difficult to heal when injured. Although Illuminating Sun and Moon tied his life-mandate and cultivation to a single Mansion, allowing his body to avoid many otherwise fatal injuries, being wounded was still a massive inconvenience. It was completely different from Li Ximing, who could simply take a pill and recover fully in less than half a year of seclusion.

The Profound Vastness Art, which cultivated Pure Qi, was a rare and wondrous healing method that did not conflict with other Daoist traditions. He had decisively postponed his search for a movement technique and first acquired the Profound Vastness Art to cultivate.

Pure Qi arts rarely had harsh requirements, and this one was no exception. It came with several Qi-gathering incantations, requiring one portion each of the Lesser Clear Spirit Qi, the Lesser Celestial-Yang Pure Qi, and the Profound Promise Pure Qi. These were the exact three types of Spiritual Qi Li Que'wan was delivering.

These three Pure Qis were not difficult to gather, but only the Lesser Clear Spirit Qi was widely known. The others were unheard of. To gather them from scratch would normally take years. Hearing his unasked question, Li Que'wan quickly explained:

"The other two are very similar to the Lesser Clear Spirit Qi; they share the same source, and the gathering methods were provided. This junior used the transformative properties of my immortal foundation and spent a few extra portions of Lesser Clear Spirit Qi to exchange for them, allowing me to obtain them early."

Not having to wait was, of course, excellent. Li Zhouwei nodded in satisfaction. He was about to say more when he suddenly looked up, his expression turning sharp with alarm. He had sensed something. In an instant, his form dissolved into light and vanished.

The others on the peak exchanged a glance and looked up at the sky together.

"Someone is crossing the river!"

Li Zhouwei took a single step, reappearing in the Great Void. Billowing bright light, accompanied by streams of white Qi, flowed from his body, coalescing into the form of a Qilin-like beast that circled around him. His weapon was not in his hand; he simply stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his voice booming like thunder.

"Which fellow Daoist has come to visit!"

Flames erupted in the Great Void. True Fire blazed like a waterfall, like a raging river, spreading through the void and transforming it into a domain of fire. A middle-aged man appeared within.

He wore complex robes—a snow-white upper garment and a bright red lower robe, with a heavy black cloak draped over his shoulders. His build was majestic, his nose high-bridged, and he possessed a fine beard and thick, dark brows. He was, by any measure, heroically handsome.

In his imposing eyes, True Fire roiled and flowed. As he gazed over from afar, the very Great Void seemed to scorch, as if all creation had been plunged into a furnace.

The blazing True Fire reflected in the void. Li Zhouwei's voice was deep, tinged with a fraction of doubt.

"So, it is the Valiant King!"

This person was indeed a King-Marquis of the Gao family. A mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who commanded three True Fire divine abilities. The very same man who was currently traveling south, persuading the various families to surrender: the Valiant King, Gao Fu!

His reputation was enormous, his strength formidable. He was a famed King-Marquis of the north, who long ago had earned acclaim for "Slaying Demons by the Lake" and "Bringing Order to the Qi Lands." Back during the North-South conflict, when there was a great disparity in power, he had been invited to stand guard. Even Daoist Master Qiushui and Daoist Master Yuanxiu had to show him deference. Li Zhouwei needed only to see the True Fire and the famously handsome, thick-bearded face to know who it was.

'The Valiant King has crossed the river...'

The Gao family's role in the recent conflicts had not been overtly hostile, but for him to cross the river now... it was a deeply suspicious act. Li Zhouwei could only give a slight nod, his voice ringing out.

"I was unaware of the Valiant King's arrival. Forgive me for not welcoming you sooner."

But the King-Marquis, wreathed in True Fire, remained utterly motionless within the flames. He was like a statue, a divine idol. His eyes, filled with blazing fire, simply stared at Li Zhouwei, and his gaze seemed almost... lost.

A full, long breath passed. Then, this King-Marquis, famed for his majestic bearing and fine beard, finally moved his lips. His expression was one of extreme complexity. His voice, though resonant and magnetic, carried a rough, hoarse edge.

"This humble King... greets... greets... Young Master."

He did not use "Daoist Master." He did not ask for a Daoist title. He did not use "Lord of the Lake" or "Master of the Li Clan." Instead, after several pained hesitations, he used the term "Young Master."

Li Zhouwei was taken aback, uncertain how to respond.

He was not ignorant of the Gao family's origins. Their original surname had been Lou; "Gao" was a name bestowed upon them by the Wei Emperor, the fount of their family's rise. The Gao family had always revered the Wei orthodox line. In those days, the Qi lands were directly north of the Ning State, and the two had existed in mutual support.

Even during the chaotic twilight of the Liang dynasty, right before the King of Yan, Murong Dechang, had fallen, the Gao family still flew the banner of "Respecting Wei." It was for this very reason that the current Gao family was often mocked by the other great families who had "passed the gate." There were even calls within their own clan to revert their surname to Lou.

When Li Xuanfeng was at the Great Ning Palace, he had heard some people refer to the Gao family as "Lou's dogs and horses." Li Zhouwei had never imagined that the current Valiant King would still harbor this small, lingering sentiment toward him.

He could only reply, "May I ask what business brings the great King here?"

The man's deep-set eyes, burning with True Fire, seemed impossibly profound. Gao Fu had regained much of his composure. He spoke softly.

"I have not come this time for public matters. It is merely... a small, personal wish. I have come to ask a question."

"Please speak."

Li Zhouwei grew wary, but he watched as the man sighed.

"This King had an aunt, surname Gao, given name Xijiang. She was very kind to me when I was young. But she wished to roam the world, and she often wandered. Years ago, she was in Jiangbei, and later, she came south to Jiangnan. Now... her lifespan is at its end. I have come to take her back. Either for her to return to her roots, or to bring her remains and funerary robes back to be buried in Yingqiu."

He paused. "It is a pity that once she crossed into Jiangnan, we lost all trace of her. She also uses a Daoist title when traveling. Therefore, I came specifically to ask the Lord of the Lake, hoping you might help this King find her."

Li Zhouwei found the entire story strange. "I see," he said, looking up. "May I know the elder's Daoist title? I will search for you, great King."

Gao Fu's eyes, still reflecting the inferno, finally met his gaze directly. His voice was calm.

"Her Daoist title... is Jianghuzi."

The name struck Li Zhouwei like a bolt of lightning. He froze, his expression shifting several times as he stared at the King-Marquis.

Li Ximing might not recognize that name, but Li Zhouwei remembered *exactly* who she was. Years ago, when the Secret Diffusion sects were at war with Moongaze Lake, their aggression had been relentless, right up until Li Ximing broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm. When the cultivators from Floating Cloud Cave retreated, they had left behind their old, weak, and sick, who were subsequently captured. Jianghuzi had been one of them.

At the time, Li Ximing had noted she was from the Zhao State and thought it odd. But seeing that she cultivated Pure Qi, he had simply allowed her to live and cultivate in the lake's Wilderness.

Meeting Gao Fu's intensely meaningful gaze, Li Zhouwei had a sudden, dawning realization.

'There are still Wei loyalists in the Gao family. This old cultivator came south... she came to see the Wei-Li bloodline. She probably didn't dare to openly side with Moongaze Lake, so she did the opposite, taking up residence in the Floating Cloud Cave to observe the situation...'

But doubts remained. Li Zhouwei put on a mask of surprise. "So, Elder Jianghuzi is an elder of the Gao family! To think she never said a word all these years. My family has truly been rude... It's just, I have been in seclusion for my breakthrough these past few years and have only just returned. I am not aware of the current situation of the few rogue cultivators in the Wilderness. I will make inquiries for the Valiant King at once!"

A faint smile touched Gao Fu's eyes. He nodded lightly. His low voice, carried by his divine ability, quietly drifted into Li Zhouwei's ears.

"At her advanced age," he said hauntingly, "she approaches all things as if she is already facing death. How could she dare?"

The implication was obvious—perhaps *too* obvious, something that could only be said in a private transmission between two such powerful cultivators. Li Zhouwei was momentarily speechless. He could only shake his head.

"Please wait a moment, great King."

He silently turned and dispatched someone to fetch the old woman, his mind racing.

'Jianghuzi has been in the Wilderness all these years. Do the other families know? They probably don't...'

'Gao Fu came all this way himself. Was it truly just to retrieve an elder? He appeared in the Great Void right next to the lake. Did Daoist Master Tinglan sense him?'

But no matter how he analyzed it, the man before him had already dispersed his protective divine ability, appearing far more approachable. Yet his eyes, fixed on Li Zhouwei, remained just as grave.

Li Zhouwei replayed the man's words in his mind and suddenly felt a profound chill.

'Jianghuzi joining the Floating Cloud Cave was likely her own choice. But... whose idea was it to leave her behind, to let her fall into my family's hands? Jianghuzi's Qi and blood were failing; she was old and sick. If she had been killed by our people back then, how would Gao Fu be acting right now? Would he still have come here, speaking so politely?'

His golden eyes flickered, his heart sinking.

'This Valiant King... he has probably already figured it out. Someone wants discord between the Gao and the Li. And he is simply helpless to stop it... And my family? At such a sensitive time, for the Gao family to appear, asking for an ancestor's remains... the Supreme Yang Dao tradition probably isn't smiling about this, either.'



# Chapter 927: Restored Honor

'Jianghuzi's original intentions were likely good. Otherwise, she wouldn't have stubbornly kept silent for so many years. Gao Fu must also genuinely feel a sense of old gratitude. If not, as a man of his stature, a king, there would be no need for him to silently show goodwill to me, a descendant of Wei-Li, at such a sensitive time. There must be some helplessness involved, but someone in the north definitely exploited the situation...'

Li Zhouwei waited quietly, his heart gradually settling.

'But neither Tinglan nor Houfu are fools. A hundred years ago, perhaps, but now? The death of Kui Qi forced them to drop their high-and-mighty airs. If they think they can use the same old tricks to deal with them... it won't be so easy!'

Sure enough, after a short wait, the Great Void rippled. A waterfall of purple light streamed down, revealing a woman in purple robes. Her features were lovely, with fine brows and elegant eyes. She gave a slight bow and said softly:

"Greetings, King Bolie."

Her attitude was very respectful. The king before her nodded slightly and replied:

"So, it is Shuxiu. Congratulations on achieving your divine ability! After you left the lands of Qi, several of the old masters of the formation dao there still miss you. When they received news of you some years ago, they were overjoyed. They even sent word straight to my royal palace."

Li Zhouwei suddenly understood.

'This Daoist Master Tinglan was originally from Qi State! She was the apprentice Daoist Master Zipei went to recruit! And now, it seems she knew this King Bolie from long ago... Listening to his tone, unlike the other cultivators of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, she, Tinglan, might even share a bond of Monarch and subject with Gao Fu!'

Then, Daoist Master Tinglan blinked gently and said in a low voice:

"Your Majesty is too gracious. Shuxiu is deeply grateful. That is why today, hearing that the King's chariot was crossing the river, I came specially to welcome you. If I have offended... please forgive me."

With a light gesture, she guided them. The three of them broke through the Great Void and landed on a mountain cliff by the river.

This spot directly faced a sandy beach and the surging river waters. A pavilion stood tall on the cliff's edge, guarded by two attendants. As they landed inside the pavilion, Li Zhouwei secretly let out a sigh of relief.

He had to admit, Tinglan's arrival was timely. Only she could have invited Gao Fu to land. Otherwise, the two of them would have had to continue their awkward standoff in the Great Void, and worse, they would have had to consider the feelings of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition.

The woman skillfully defused the situation, taking a seat in the pavilion and beginning to brew tea. She spoke softly,

"King Bolie has traveled all the way south. Have the matters been settled?"

Gao Fu had a powerful build. Seated in the pavilion, he possessed a truly imposing aura. He stroked his beard and said:

"It went... adequately. The Huai River Dao was established by Emperor Zhaowu of Zhao back in the day. For all these years, it has existed mostly in name, comprising just one or two prefectures. After the violent death of the Duke of Xu, the capital had long intended to conquer it, but it has been delayed for so many years..."

"Now, the three sects—Chengyun, Capital immortals, and Xuanmiao—have all pledged allegiance to Zhao Shuo and have been reformed into the Huai River Daoist tradition. Fortunately, the matter was resolved easily, without many casualties."

In truth, Gao Fu's journey south was a policy of appeasement toward the three immortal sects. It was also the result of internal disunity among the Buddhist cultivators, with various factions working to restrain each other. This was already the best possible outcome amid misfortune. Tinglan held no great resentment toward Gao Fu, only asking in a low voice:

"I wonder, for the three sects of Jiangbei, how was the Profound Governance Pavilion recorded?"

The two seemed to have no north-south divide between them at all. Gao Fu sipped his tea naturally.

"Daoist Master Changyun of Chengyun Gate cultivates 'Geng Metal.' His Daoist tradition has now been verified; it originates from an ancient lineage and is subordinate to Encompassing Profoundity."

"Daoist Master Yehui of the Capital immortals Dao cultivates 'Capital Guard.' His origins are even clearer—unquestionably of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition."

"As for Daoist Master Sumian of Xuanmiao Temple..."

Gao Fu's expression turned solemn. He paused slightly before answering:

"I am acquainted with this Daoist Master Sumian. It is now said throughout the mountains that he took Qiuxin and went overseas, seeking a place for secluded cultivation to help Qiuxin break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. He even took that Grandmaster statue with him, leaving behind only a handwritten letter."

He spoke with a trace of amusement,

"If the Buddhists come, he joins the Buddhists. If Qi comes, he joins Qi. When the Dao sects are extinguished one day, he will move to Gehu Peak."

Li Zhouwei frowned inwardly.

'Sumian really has some skill, to have predicted so long ago that Gao Fu would be the one to come south and clean things up...'

The so-called 'If Qi comes, he joins Qi' referred to King Bolie, who was the King of Qi. It was just that there had once been an Emperor of Qi who met a bad end. The Gao family shared no Daoist tradition or bloodline with him, so they naturally couldn't use the 'Qi' title, opting for 'Bolie' instead...

And the so-called Gehu Peak was the very spirit mountain formed from the death of Changxi!

After all, Xuanmiao Temple belonged to the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition and held no strong bias between the north and south. They had even befriended many northern cultivators. With their Purple Mansion Realm expert away, no matter what trouble Xuanmiao Temple got into, the consequences wouldn't be too tragic. The final path of retreat Sumian had left for them was that very mountain.

Li Zhouwei merely frowned, while Tinglan offered her thanks. Just then, a group of people quickly ascended the cliff. Chen Yang came forward, holding a metal box, and said respectfully:

"Greetings, Daoist Masters!"

Unsure of King Bolie's attitude, the Li family subordinates naturally wouldn't send a direct descendant. They only allowed Chen Yang to approach, presenting the box respectfully.

"Jianghuzi passed away some days ago. Before her death, she exhausted her cultivation, creating seven talismans. She died from the complete depletion of her cultivation essence and blood. The phenomenon was not significant. Everything she left is now in this box."

Li Zhouwei took it from his hand first. In that brief moment of contact, his spiritual sense swept over it lightly before he passed it to Gao Fu. The King Bolie accepted the golden box and opened it gently. Inside lay seven golden talismans and a small letter.

'Golden Armor Mystic Art Talisman.'

Li Zhouwei already knew what was inside, so he wasn't surprised. Although the Golden Armor Mystic Art Talisman was a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman, it wasn't particularly remarkable. It could only condense a suit of dharma power armor to defend against an enemy's Dharma Arts.

Gao Fu's pupils, however, dilated. He stared in silence, choked with emotion. He put the talismans away, his formidable eyes immediately shutting tight, and he kept them closed for a long time. Finally, he looked at the last letter. It contained only eight words:

"Jiangnan is at peace. I was fortunate to meet a good end."

She hadn't mentioned a single thing about the Gao family, yet she emphasized that her end was 'good.' King Bolie closed his eyes, accepted the letter, and gave a slight bow:

"Many thanks, Young Master!"

After saying this one word of thanks, he spoke no more. He tore through the Great Void and disappeared.

Li Zhouwei bowed in farewell. Beside him, Tinglan flicked a finger, and a purple barrier of light instantly enveloped the pavilion. She said softly,

"Fellow Daoist Minghuang is truly extraordinary!"

"Greetings, Senior."

Li Zhouwei's eyes shone as he replied:

"Thank you, Senior, for resolving the situation!"

Hearing this, a chill rose in Tinglan's eyes. She closed them and let out a heavy sigh.

"If I hadn't come, this would have been troublesome..."

She seemed somewhat vexed, saying in a low voice:

"I had no idea that Senior Gao Xijiang was in your esteemed clan's territory! Thankfully, your clan handled it well. Otherwise, I don't know how this could have been explained!"

Li Zhouwei's eyes darkened. He asked:

"Does the Gao family have a divine ability expert with the surname Shilou?"

The question was deeply meaningful, striking right at the heart of the matter.

Li Zhouwei didn't understand the internal workings of the Gao family, but the will of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was law. This King Bolie clearly felt gratitude for the old Wei-Li, yet there was still opposing sentiment within the Gao family. There was only one possibility—the opposing voice was also at the Purple Mansion Realm.

'Within the Gao family, there is at least one Purple Mansion Realm expert who wishes to restore the Shilou name and sever all ties with the Wei State. They probably used Jianghuzi's status as an elder to demand he cross the river... This also happened to align with the North's need to sow discord. With pressure from both sides, King Bolie was forced to make this trip south...'

'If Gao Fu hadn't come personally, someone from the Gao family with the restored surname 'Shilou' would have come instead. The scene would have become extremely ugly. That is why he *had* to come himself!'

Tinglan stared at him for a moment before replying:

"Precisely. Shilou Wei and Shilou Yingge are both influential figures in the Gao family... For many years, the Gao family has been conflicted over the matter of their allegiance to Wei..."

Hailing from the lands of Qi, she naturally understood this matter well; otherwise, she wouldn't have rushed over. Her eyes now held a cold light as she said in a low voice:

"Senior Xijiang held great prestige. Her only remaining wish was simply to see a descendant of Wei..."

"If that senior had died at your hands, or suffered any harsh treatment, the northern powers would have immediately sent a Shilou Purple Mansion Realm expert charging south to raise hell and seize the opportunity to sever the relationship between Gao and Li with one stroke!"

"But they waited and waited. Jianghuzi remained safe and sound at your home. She even held on long enough to distinguish right from wrong and leave a final statement. They had to settle for the next best thing: forcing Gao Fu to come himself. On one hand, it sowed discord. On the other... this pawn was instead turned against King Bolie himself!"

She had only said half, but Li Zhouwei understood. His eyes narrowed.

"The northern factions just finished scheming together against the Buddhist cultivators and reaping the rewards. Now, retaliation comes immediately, forcing King Bolie to cross the river, yet no one steps up to support him. The severity of the plotting and backstabbing in the north is plain to see!"

Given the awkward position of Wei-Li, King Bolie—a king of the Zhao State with a different surname—was already under considerable suspicion. Yet, he still treated the Wei-Li with courtesy... This King Bolie, Gao Fu, was a man of thick righteousness and gratitude. He couldn't even bring himself to call him 'Fellow Daoist'...

'And this King Bolie, and Jianghuzi... they bore my family no malice. Jiang Huzi's original intention was probably just to see my family for herself...'

Tinglan nodded gently, her voice soft.

"As it stands, word will inevitably spread through the Huai River Dao that the Gao clan still harbors feelings for Wei-Li. For King Bolie, this is truly not a good thing."

Li Zhouwei clasped his hands behind his back, gazing at the surging river below the mountain. He remained silent for a long time before speaking softly,

"King Bolie has great bearing. He persuaded the three immortal sects and holds no malice toward the south. Naturally, there is a crowd of people who want to force him out! They cannot tolerate his presence for even a moment."

Daoist Master Tinglan sipped her tea in the pavilion, finally setting the matter aside. She asked:

"Why is Zhaojing not here?"

Li Zhouwei understood her meaning. If they had known the situation beforehand, it naturally would have been better for Li Ximing to come and greet Gao Fu. But first, they hadn't known Gao Fu was coming south, nor the significance of his trip, so they couldn't have prepared. And second... Li Ximing wasn't here. He replied:

"My elder wishes to find a spiritual fire. He has already gone overseas and will not be able to return for some time."

"Spiritual fire..."

When Li Zhouwei said this, Tinglan looked slightly puzzled.

"Is he searching for you...? There's no need to be so hasty..."

Li Zhouwei saw her concerned expression and had an idea. He replied:

"Not at all. There is an ancestral secret art that requires Li Fire to be performed. We have been unable to obtain it for a long time, so he went out to search for some clues."

Only then did Tinglan understand. She pondered, "The Li Fire... in the Yue State, it is confirmed that only Hengzhu possesses a portion. As for the Wu State, the Qing family also had some back then. But every one of them is arrogant and haughty. A spiritual fire is not like other things; it is not easily bartered for."

She spoke of Li Fire, but in reality, as long as his family obtained *any* spiritual fire, they could likely use the Intercalary Sun Art to trade for Li Fire. But Li Zhouwei understood the value of the Intercalary Sun Art and wouldn't reveal it easily, so he just shook his head, feigning disappointment.

Tinglan, however, took it to heart. She said seriously:

"I previously mentioned the Southern Borderlands to him; he could go take a look. I will also make some inquiries on his behalf. As soon as I have news, I will let him know."

Li Zhouwei was a little surprised and nodded. He was just about to take his leave when Tinglan said softly:

"These past few days... Zhu Gong's injuries have been constantly worsening. Compounding old wounds with new is already troublesome, but a few days ago, her Dharma Body began to show signs of collapse. She won't be healed anytime soon."

"Back in the Eastern Sea, Hengxing was already very displeased with her and absolutely refuses to pay her any mind. We asked Houfu to look at her some time ago, but it was difficult to treat. I came this time hoping to find Zhaojing."

Li Zhouwei frowned inwardly. He wasn't familiar with this Zhu Gong, nor would he make decisions for Li Ximing, and he certainly didn't want to get involved. He replied:

"My elder won't be gone for too long. When he returns, I will be sure to inform him."

Tinglan nodded silently and quickly departed from the pavilion, leaving Li Zhouwei standing in the mountain wind. Below his feet, the river surged past jagged rocks, white waves churning. Not until the sun had set did he let out a heavy breath.

"Who in any family is truly free!"

...

Southern Borderlands.

Mountain ranges rose and fell, dense jungles stretched out, birds soared, and packs of Demons roared. One after another, range upon range, Demon mountains pressed against Demon mountains, and Demon kingdoms bordered Demon kingdoms.

Li Ximing crossed thousands of miles, traveling first from the Vermillion Sea to the Southern Sea, then from the Southern Sea to Shahuan. He bypassed the Piaoren Kingdom and flew all the way to the myriad Demon ranges bordering the Great Western Plateau.

The journey was filled with the stench of slaughter and blood. Near the borders, there were still a few kingdoms ruled by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. But in the depths, it was truly the dominion of Demons. They governed their kingdoms with iron fists. The native peoples were scrawny and emaciated, treated like cattle or sheep, scurrying with their heads bowed. The Demon beasts, in contrast, were fat and imposing, riding in tall carriages that sped past.

There were many native peoples here, but none who spoke the language of the central lands. They all used their own native tongues and had customs similar to the Demons. They didn't know how to use cups or chopsticks, eating only with their hands. Most practiced some form of Buddhist arts, though they couldn't even be considered monks.

Li Ximing took one look and understood.

'In the end, Buddhist arts are useful. They allow people to await death in peace, praying for the next life. Even the Demon kingdoms enjoy using them.'

From this, it was clear these native peoples were not living well. The common folk in the north, who only wished for death, at least had land to farm. But the people here were numb, begging for the scraps of Demon beasts to survive. They were worse off than those in the north!

Demon beasts were not skilled in formations, so there were few restrictions in these areas. Li Ximing shuttled through the Great Void and soon arrived at the so-called Xipo Kingdom.

This kingdom was opulent and magnificent, built around a high mountain. Unlike the pavilions and courtyards of Jiangnan, this place was filled with tall pagodas and bell towers. Gemmed trees swayed in the wind, shrouded in five-colored mists. A thousand varieties of strange flowers bloomed everywhere. There were hardly any human figures to be seen; instead, all sorts of Demon beasts, dressed in clothes, moved about in a bustling spectacle.

But a thousand miles beyond this mountain, one would witness a living hell. Smoke and fire were everywhere as tribes of Demon beasts slaughtered each other, all to offer up blood sacrifices to the central city-state.

'Here, it is Demons enslaving other Demons. There are no traces of humanity. This is a true Demon kingdom...'

Li Ximing descended on a beam of light. From within the magnificent pagoda, a pair of Demon generals immediately rode the wind to greet him. After just one glance, one Demon bowed to him, gesturing for him to wait, while the other immediately turned and shouted into the pitch-black doorway of the pagoda.

Great bells chimed from within the pagoda. Two rows of Demon generals rushed out. Clouds gathered in the sky, and auspicious mists descended. A loud cry echoed from the depths of the pagoda, shouting in some unknown language.

"Awoooo..."

At this, Auspicious Qi surged, and a blinding golden light flared. A man flew out from the pagoda. His pupils were a mix of white and red, and his face was both wickedly handsome and demonic. He wore armor of white bone and robes of blood-red silk, his ominous might palpable and terrifying. A pair of golden wings grew from his back, and he stood upon surging golden clouds, staring fixedly at Li Ximing.

This Demon's aura was immense, brimming with auspicious light. He held a glittering long saber in his hand. His cultivation was at the early Purple Mansion Realm, but with a divine ability flowing in his eyes and auspicious clouds beneath his feet, he gave Li Ximing an extremely dangerous feeling.

This Demon was none other than the Great Suopo King of the Xipo Kingdom!

'A figure who could fight his way to the top in the depths of the Southern Borderlands and establish his own Demon kingdom... none of them are weak. This is completely different from the Eastern Sea and Southern Sea, where the Dragon-kin rule. This one is not only of noble blood, but he is likely terrifying in combat!'

Li Ximing sized up his Dharma Body, then bowed slightly.

"This humble one is Zhaojing, from Moongaze Lake."

The Demon beast was stunned for a moment, then realization dawned. He opened his mouth, and surprisingly, spoke in perfect, formal court language—and with a Jiangnan accent, no less:

"So, it is a Fellow Daoist! Please!"

Li Ximing was inwardly astonished. The Demon, however, seemed to understand Jiangnan etiquette quite well. He did not invite Li Ximing into the pagoda, but instead pointed to a small, iridescent pavilion over a pond.

"I was unaware of the Daoist Master's celestial arrival. I have truly been rude!"

With a spin, he transformed into a white-robed scholar. Yet, he still had that wickedly handsome face and red-and-white pupils. He looked less like a scholar and more like a demonic advisor intent on bringing ruin to a kingdom.

He invited Li Ximing to sit and smiled.

"I am Fuxun, Lord of the Xipo Kingdom... That tiger demon claimed he had a Daoist Master backing him, and it turns out it was true. Today, I get to see you in person! My divine ability must be shining, bringing me such good fortune. But I must also thank the Daoist Master for being willing to make the trip to my humble wilderness!"

The other party cultivated Auspicious Qi, so it wasn't wrong to say it was due to his divine ability. Li Ximing hadn't expected this Fuxun to be so eloquent. His Jiangnan accent even sounded quite familiar. He replied:

"Your Majesty speaks Jiangnan's dialect so well. It is truly familiar to hear!"

Fuxun shook his head and smiled.

"I have a good friend who hails from Jiangnan. He settled here some time ago to manage some affairs for me and, along the way, taught me some of the Jiangnan dialect."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing's interest was immediately piqued, but Fuxun cut him off with a smile.

"Since Fellow Daoist is here, shall we get down to business?"

Between the two of them, there was naturally only business to discuss. Li Ximing didn't stand on ceremony either. He said seriously:

"Please, Fellow Daoist, show me the outline for the alchemy. I must examine it closely to ensure this pill can be refined. Only then will we have a reason to continue this discussion..."

"Good!"

The scholar-like Demon laughed and retrieved a wooden slip from his sleeve. Before Li Ximing even touched it, he felt a jolt of surprise and asked, astonished:

"Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood?"

The slip in the Demon's hand was indeed made from Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood and looked ancient. Hearing the question, the old Demon wasn't surprised. He just held the slip in his hand and smiled.

"I've heard that the Yue State is the territory of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. I wonder, where does Fellow Daoist rank in the Dao of Alchemy?"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

Truthfully, among all the alchemists in Jiangnan today, perhaps only Xiao Chuting and Hengxing were his equals. Everyone else was either a step below him or had long since been left in his dust. He took a modest position and said humbly:

"I wouldn't presume to be the best, but I am ranked third."

Fuxun's eyes lit up. He felt Li Ximing was being modest.

"Please!"

Li Ximing's spiritual sense moved. As expected, the latter half of the wooden slip was locked. He read the accessible part carefully, his brow furrowing in silence.

Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill!

The refinement method for this pill was unlike anything he had ever seen. It was extremely ancient, a method for creating a Mystic Pill. It didn't pursue the creation of as many pills as possible in one batch, but rather sought to condense all the medicinal power into a single point, taking the meaning of 'profound unity.' If it succeeded, it would form one pill. If it failed, there would be nothing left at all.

The current Dao of Alchemy had already reached a pinnacle. An expert Alchemist like Li Ximing could produce six or more pills in a single furnace. Even a poor attempt would yield one or two. There was no precedent for a refinement leaving *nothing* behind.

And the main ingredients for this pill were even more peculiar. It required the heart of a Purple Mansion Realm-level Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat, paired with a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item of the 'Auspicious Qi' variety called Non-Falling Golden Cloud... The difficulty was astronomical, even higher than Tinglan's Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill back in the day!

Li Ximing stared, wanting to speak but stopping himself. His first reaction was:

'This Demon! What an astonishingly deep foundation!'

Fuxun saw his expression and grew anxious. He clearly understood just how demanding his request was. Li Ximing shook his head.

"Fellow Daoist, this pill is truly... awkward!"

One had to know, the Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat was already extinct. Even in ancient times, it was a noble of the Purple Mansion Realm, just one tier below the Dragon-kin. It was on the same level as the Surging Li Wuping Fire-Yang Luan Wu Pian that Li Zhouwei had seen. This was equivalent to digging out Wu Pian's heart and then refining it with the Non-Falling Golden Cloud, a substance that feared not the Water Mansion and could discern good from evil!

In other words, if this refinement failed, it wouldn't just be a waste of spiritual resources—it would be the literal destruction of two *extraordinary* Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items. Forget Fuxun, a Demon from the savage lands; even Li Ximing himself would spit blood and fly into a rage if someone wasted two such items!

Questioned like this, Fuxun looked embarrassed. But he couldn't afford the loss either and absolutely did not dare to offer any guarantees. He could only sigh in silence.

'No wonder no one has been willing to refine this for the Demon after all this time!'

Li Ximing cursed inwardly. He made a quick calculation, hesitating slightly.

'It's not... impossible. If I could borrow Xiukui's spiritual furnace... it might just work... But the probability is only seventy or eighty percent...'

But in the end, the matter was too troublesome. He had to see the payment first. He replied:

"This Daoist Master made a special trip to the Southern Borderlands because I require a Purple Mansion Realm-level spiritual fire."

He understood how precious spiritual fire was, so he immediately added:

"Even a clue to its whereabouts would be good."

As soon as he said this, Fuxun's red-and-white pupils stared at him. He rested one hand on the table and tapped the armrest with the other, seeming to judge his sincerity. He quickly replied:

"I won't hide it from you, Fellow Daoist. To the west of my Xipo Kingdom, there is a place called Baijia Kingdom. The ruler of Baijia Kingdom is a Vermilion Bird. She has a fire in her possession called White Xi Karma Fire. If Fellow Daoist is interested, you can kill that bird and take her flame!"

This statement made Li Ximing shake his head. He wasn't some naive fool. How could he get entangled in the struggles between these Demon kingdoms for Fuxun? He only said:

"I currently have no intention of killing a Demon King or disrupting the balance of power. I am only looking to trade."

"That will be difficult!"

Fuxun sighed heavily. But then he looked at Li Ximing's face, unwilling to let this opportunity slip by. He grit his teeth and said:

"Fellow Daoist, give me a straight answer! If you make the attempt, what are your chances of success!"



# Chapter 928, Yuanbian

Li Ximing secretly sized him up. He sat upright, unmoving, and said softly,

"This pill is exceptionally wondrous, so you must understand how high the difficulty is. I have some friends in Jiangnan who possess a Purple Mansion Realm spirit furnace. If I call in a personal favor and borrow it, the chance of successfully refining the pill is at least seventy percent."

The Demon King let out a 'haha' and stood up from his seat, his face beaming with joy. He announced in a clear voice,

"If Daoist Friend can guarantee seventy percent, then this deal is definitely worth making!"

Seeing his eagerness, Li Ximing felt the Demon King was ready to go all-in on this gamble. But this wasn't a one-man affair. If the refinement failed, he would needlessly provoke a noble scion. Li Ximing feared the trouble. After careful consideration, he still tried to persuade him,

"Daoist Friend should be more cautious… After all, this is an incredibly precious spiritual object. If anything goes wrong, the pain will be immense!"

Fuxun, however, turned his red-and-white-streaked eyes upon him. His lips moved as he spoke in a low voice,

"I don't mind telling you, Daoist Friend, that this king has some small influence in this region. Near the Xipo Kingdom, there is a Demon Cave. The cave master is my dearest friend, his Daoist title is Qingyan, and he cultivates the Azure Manifestation path!"

"Oh?!"

Li Ximing's interest was immediately piqued. Azure Manifestation was a Daoist tradition that seemed both infinitely distant and yet right before his eyes. His own neighbors, the Yuan family, cultivated Azure Manifestation, which was once considered a marvel in Jiangnan. Yet, they had been unable to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm for ages, causing their illustrious Daoist tradition to lose its luster.

He had never expected to encounter a cultivator of Azure Manifestation in this remote Demon Kingdom. Li Ximing smiled and nodded, already understanding his meaning. He asked,

"Is it... an Invocation Art?"

The Great Suopo King nodded proudly, lifting his chin. "Daoist Friend is truly from the Immortal Dao of Jiangnan, so knowledgeable and experienced! Hardly anyone in the entire Southern Borderlands has even heard of the Azure Manifestation path!"

Li Ximing pondered this for a moment, then offered a reminder,

"Although traces of Invocation Arts still exist in Jiangnan, I have rarely heard of them being used to assist in pill refinement. We should still test it beforehand."

"But of course!"

Fuxun said solemnly,

"Of the so-called Three Shamans and Two Invokers, the two invokers are Hengzhu and Azure Manifestation. My brother is also of noble descent, and his Dao-Profundity is not shallow. Besides… Daoist Friend, don't forget about me!"

He smiled faintly, and his red-and-white eyes blinked, making him appear even more demonic,

"This king cultivates Auspicious Qi, which includes a divine ability to sense fortune and calamity, and to bestow good luck. With the three of us working together, if this pill still fails to form, I'm afraid there are no other methods left that could succeed!"

'That's true enough…'

The other party possessed an Auspicious Qi divine ability. Since their conversation was proceeding so smoothly, it meant the divine ability sensed no abnormalities; the venture itself was inherently beneficial. Li Ximing relaxed slightly. Looking at Fuxun, he said softly,

"Since that is the case, I will need to borrow that spirit furnace. As for your Spirit Fire…"

At this, Fuxun's energy returned. He stroked his chin, thinking hard. After a long while, he answered,

"Honestly, the most convenient way is to steal one. On the Western Heaven Plateau, in that White Victory Palace, there's a cultivator of 'Lesser Yang' who knows how to refine some pills. He definitely has a Spirit Fire, and it's quite strong. It's called the Palace-Aspect Fire of the High Formulae."

Li Ximing simply refused politely,

"There is no need to consider a Lesser Yang fire. The Spirit Fire I wish to obtain must at least be from among the Fire-virtue, and it cannot be a 'Merging Fire'!"

If it was absolutely necessary, he wouldn't shy from a fight. But the other party was clearly nursing plans to drag him into a conflict against the White Victory Palace. Li Ximing would never agree to that. He firmed his tone to pressure him.

Seeing that he had narrowed the scope, Fuxun racked his brain and finally found a target. He lowered his voice,

"If you travel south from here, near the northern part of the Southern Sea, there is a great nation of the Southern Borderlands. Its capital is on a large southern island. It's called the Vermilion Luo Kingdom. The king died long ago, his body transforming into a Spirit Fire that was carved up by various families. He left behind a new king who only just broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm. I suspect he still has a Spirit Fire."

Li Ximing saw his predatory intent at a glance and understood that this fellow was quite cunning. He frowned.

"Daoist Friend, either you go and get the Spirit Fire first, or we go and trade for it. You are not to use my name to intimidate or coerce him, which would only create an enemy."

"Naturally, naturally."

Fuxun cupped his hands, his tone almost fawning,

"After all, Daoist Friend still needs to refine the pill… How could this king possibly cause trouble in this matter…"

"What this king means is, that new king is in dire straits right now. If Daoist Friend provides some pills, and I promise him some conditions, like my protection for a number of years…"

The Demon beast gave a low, sinister chuckle,

"He's already in a difficult position and can't afford to offend me. With a bit of coercion and enticement, there's a high probability he'll agree!"

"Fine."

Li Ximing didn't care if the promise would be honored. As long as he provided his pills and was extricated from the affair, that was enough. He reminded him,

"If you go to negotiate with him, I must be present."

Fuxun agreed, then observed him silently for a moment before replying,

"It's just that he cultivates 'Li Fire'. Can Daoist Friend refine pills for that?"

"That is not a problem."

Although Li Ximing didn't have a pill recipe for 'Li Fire' pills, his own alchemy skills were profound, and he possessed the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art. He wasn't worried about failing to satisfy a Demon King from this impoverished backwater.

He said softly,

"Daoist Friend, go and ask him. If he doesn't have any pills he urgently needs refined, just have him tell me what he requires, and I will refine them for him. The number of pills I produce will not disappoint him."

At this point, he paused slightly and smiled.

"As for the resources for this refinement… that is something Daoist Friend will need to consider."

In truth, Li Ximing had 'Li Fire' Purple Mansion Realm resources on hand—the Surging Li Treasure Leaf that Ning Wan had gifted him back at Moongaze Lake. It was perfectly suitable for this pill.

But having reached his current cultivation, Li Ximing had long since mastered the art of taking the initiative. He was naturally going to make Fuxun provide the resources.

The Great Suopo King deliberated for a moment, looking somewhat helpless. He shook his head.

"I'm not afraid of you laughing at me, Daoist Friend. Some years ago, to trade for the Non-Falling Golden Cloud, I completely exhausted all the spiritual resources I had accumulated over the years… Otherwise, I wouldn't always be thinking of fighting and stealing…"

"But it is only right that I provide this… We shall see what he demands."

Seeing that he was being rather sincere, Li Ximing nodded in agreement. He was already getting impatient. "When will we go to see this Demon King?"

"There's no rush."

Fuxun chuckled and said in a low voice,

"I mentioned a friend from Jiangnan earlier, with the Daoist title Yuanbian. He was in seclusion, cultivating at sea, and only came out last year. I've invited him to come and make an appearance, to put on a show of force and intimidate that Vermilion Luo King."

Li Ximing nodded. He decided to just wait in the courtyard and discuss the Dao with him. It turned out this Great Suopo King truly had some Dao-Profundity. His 'Auspicious Qi' was also exceedingly rare in the world, and Li Ximing actually gained considerable insight from their talk.

The Demon King's temperament was not as savage as he had imagined; he was even quite witty and straightforward. As they spoke more, Li Ximing could still sense his extreme focus on this pill. Fuxun fiddled with his teacup, appearing very anxious. Li Ximing had no choice but to say,

"The spiritual object is indeed precious, and this pill recipe is too extreme. Have you considered trying a different method?"

Fuxun just shook his head, saying slowly,

"The Non-Falling Golden Cloud is no ordinary thing. It is recorded in my Daoist tradition that a certain True Monarch used this item before he achieved the Dao. At that time, he was only at the Purple Mansion Realm. He used three clouds and one stone, with Supreme Yin as the base, to finally forge a single talisman… And those 'three clouds and one stone' included the Non-Falling Golden Cloud and the Supreme Concealed Origin."

Li Ximing calculated this in his mind and couldn't help but laugh.
"Just at the Purple Mansion Realm… he used four top-tier Purple Mansion spiritual objects to refine one talisman?"

"Far more than that!"

Fuxun laughed heartily, his expression filled with reverence. "I heard that the material used for the Supreme Yin base was far, far superior to even the Non-Falling Golden Cloud and the Supreme Concealed Origin!"

"Otherwise, how could he have become a True Monarch?"

He shook his head silently, then continued,

"This pill is intended to imitate the forging of that talisman, taking the True Monarch's act as its precedent. Back then, the True Monarch refined a talisman; today, what we refine is a pill. As for the Azure Manifestation enhancement, even if you had a 100% chance of success, I would still invite him… After all, we must honor the tale…"

From a purely alchemical perspective, Li Ximing saw it as just a refinement. But the act of emulating a sage's precedent was never just for comfort; it definitely had a tangible, practical use. Even today, cultivators in Jiangnan had all sorts of strange rituals, some so inexplicable they would break a weapon before opening an array…

Barely two days passed when a clamor arose from outside. Someone called out,

"Is Senior Fuxun present? Yuanbian has come to pay a visit!"

The voice made Li Ximing look up. He frowned strangely, an inexplicable doubt rising in his heart.

'That is definitely a Jiangnan accent… It even has a familiar, hometown feel…'

When Fuxun heard the voice, he knew the reinforcements he had waited so long for had arrived. He was overjoyed and rushed out of the tower, calling,

"Brother, you've come!"

The door opened, and a Daoist Master flew in. He appeared middle-aged. While his features weren't particularly handsome, he was dressed in a white fur robe, a precious pearl hanging from his waist, giving him a refined and scholarly air. On his fair brow were three vertical and horizontal marks, the two on the sides short and the one in the middle long, all glowing with a brilliant silver color.

His eyes were bright and spirited. He smiled as he entered the tower, still speaking humbly,

"Senior is too kind! You are my elder by many years, I truly dare not call you brother. Just calling me by my Daoist title is fine!"

After saying this, the Daoist Master in the white fur robe finally noticed there was another person in the tower. He stiffened, his gaze shifting over in a daze. His pupils suddenly dilated, as if he had seen something utterly shocking.

The Daoist Master in the white-gold Daoist robes had already risen from his seat and walked to the front of the tower. Their eyes met.

Compared to the other's sheer disbelief, Li Ximing's expression was one of bewildered uncertainty. He seemed unable to confirm it, his gaze sweeping over the man's face again and again. The atmosphere instantly froze like stone.

Fuxun's smile was still plastered on his face, but in that same instant, his mind screamed in alarm, warning bells blaring,

'Oh no! These two are enemies!'

The thought had barely risen in his mind when faint fangs began to emerge from beneath his fair-faced scholar's visage. Only one thought remained in Fuxun's mind,

'What a pity! It will be impossible to find an Alchemist this good again!'

But in just a flash, the middle-aged man in the long white fur robe beside him was already red-eyed, weeping with joy,

"Ximing!"

That single cry made Fuxun's rampaging fangs quickly retract. He turned his head away, slightly embarrassed. Li Ximing's eyes were filled with utter disbelief. 

Only when the middle-aged man walked right up to him did he stammer,

"Can it be… Senior Changdie…"

This person was Liu Changdie!

Li Ximing couldn't be more familiar with that name. This man was not only acquainted with several of his own family's elders, but he had also built arrays for his family long ago. Before the Li family had risen to prominence, almost every one of their arrays had been constructed by this Array Dao Master… 

The Five Waters Imperial Heaven Grand Array still in use on Mount Qingdu was his handiwork!

He had heard that this man and his uncle, Li Yuanjiao, were inseparable friends. Back then, Liu Changdie had wept so hard at his uncle's grave that he'd cried more fiercely than most of the relatives…

But unfortunately, Li Ximing had been cultivating at the Xiao family in his early years and had never met him. The last time this man had come to build an array for Mount Qingdu, Li Ximing had been in seclusion, breaking through…

Therefore, among all the brothers, only Li Ximing had never met him. Liu Changdie had deeply regretted this at the time and had even asked Li Xijun about him… He never charged a single coin for his array work, due to a debt of gratitude. Thus, when Li Ximing came out of seclusion, Li Xuanxuan had specifically shown him a portrait of Liu Changdie, so he would remember the man…

'He actually reached the Purple Mansion Realm, in silence, here in the Southern Borderlands! As a rogue cultivator… How incredible!'

Although he knew this man had some peculiarities, the world was full of people with secrets. How many of them ever reached the Purple Mansion Realm! Liu Changdie had actually managed to do it in this desolate and remote place?!

He understood the deep friendship between his family and Liu Changdie. He was both shocked and overjoyed. Who could have known that the emotions of the man before him were far more complex than his own…

Li Ximing had never met Liu Changdie, but Liu Changdie had met *him*! In a past life, Li Ximing's concubine had been Liu Changdie's daughter! Seeing his face now, how could he not be lost in a daze! A sob caught in his throat, and in a voice choked with a mixture of grief and joy, he cried,

"Seventh Young Master!"

The moment the man in the white fur robe spoke, Li Ximing felt as if a lifetime had passed,

'How many years has it been since someone called me Seventh Young Master? Who would still dare to call me Seventh Young Master?'

With just this one sentence, he was almost certain that the man before him was Liu Changdie. He was momentarily at a loss, and could only sigh,

"Congratulations, Senior! This is truly, truly unexpected…"

Liu Changdie stared at him deeply.

'I have memories of my past life, giving me an advantage at every turn. But even so, I suffered countless hardships and was only lucky enough to find a spiritual object in the Southern Borderlands to break through. Without a great deal of luck, I might not have succeeded even now!'

'But he had to drag an entire family with him, cultivating in that perilous land of Jiangnan, where killing intent lurks everywhere. And he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm at an even younger age than me… The hardships he must have endured are unimaginable…'

He let out a long sigh. After a long moment, he finally said,

"If Brother Jiao knew this in the underworld, he could finally rest in peace!"

This sentence caused Li Ximing's recently calmed emotions to stir once more. He let out a soft breath as he listened to the man before him, who asked excitedly,

"Is Lord Xuanxuan in good health? How is Miss Yuexiang? Is Third Young Master doing well at Azure Pond? Has Xicheng reached the Foundation Establishment Realm? And Xijun must be at the point of impacting the Purple Mansion Realm by now…"

Li Ximing listened quietly until he finished, then said softly,

"The old master is well. Third Brother has gone to the Eastern Sea to cultivate. Sister Yuexiang, Eldest Brother, Eighth Brother… they… are no longer with us."

"Oh!"

Liu Changdie turned his head away, sitting down as if he couldn't breathe. Li Ximing forced a smile and replied,

"Let's talk about the business at hand first!"

Both men were already masters of the Purple Mansion Realm, and there was an outsider—a Demon beast—watching them. They adjusted their emotions within a single breath. Fuxun looked left, then right, and was suddenly overjoyed,

"You two knew each other all along! This makes things much easier!"

Li Ximing Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Purple Mansion Alchemist



# Chapter 929, Red Pheasant Surging Li

The Great Suopo King's eyes were smiling, his joy plain to see. He was a Demon King who had lived for many years, and he could easily tell that the relationship between the two men before him was at the level of a deep, hereditary friendship.

He was inwardly ecstatic,

'My divine ability truly cannot be wrong! How could they be enemies! I saw from the start that Brother Liu was a man of deep fortune. I slowly guided him, forming a good bond. I never thought it would pay off so quickly!'

'I probably didn't even need to use my divine ability on that tiger demon to learn that his master would be helpful to me. If I had just waited a year or two, Brother Liu would have brought Li Ximing to me anyway, and the pill would have been refined all the same!'

He laughed inwardly, marveling at his own divine ability,

'Now we can skip all those small suspicions, all that time spent building trust! With Brother Liu here to make the introductions, how could I possibly fear any tricks?'

And so he laughed aloud, immediately ordering the demons to prepare a grand feast. He eagerly brought out wine, filling both their cups, his expression full of heroic spirit,

"How many old friends get to meet again at the Purple Mansion Realm? The past is like flowing water. Let us celebrate and drink to this!"

His words were fitting for the occasion. Li Ximing and Liu Changdie drank together. Li Ximing offered a polite smile, but Liu Changdie was still lost in nostalgic sighs. He turned his head and said seriously,

"Senior Fuxun has shown me immense kindness and is a true, close friend. Ximing, you need not have any doubts."

His words laid everything bare. Li Ximing nodded silently, indicating he understood. The Demon King signaled for music to be played and smiled,

"Now, Daoist Friend doesn't have to worry about me going back on my word, and I don't have to worry about Daoist Friend exaggerating his abilities. With Daoist Friend Yuanbian here, how could there be any deceit between us?"

This was true. Li Ximing nodded. Liu Changdie's trustworthiness was beyond compare. He then watched as the Demon King recounted their previous plan in great detail. He grabbed Liu Changdie's hand, saying awkwardly,

"We are all on the same side, so I won't use empty words. Right now, my pockets are empty. I'm lacking the 'Li Fire' resources and was hoping you could help make up for it."

Liu Changdie nodded and smiled.

"Good!"

He pressed his storage bag, pondering for a moment. With a light flick of his hand, he revealed a stone box and opened it.

Resting on the azure-green stone was a red lotus flower, no bigger than a palm. It was a budding blossom, looking plump and full. An soaring aura of Li Fire, like a small bird, circled the red lotus.

Liu Changdie said softly,

"This is a Red Petrel Heart-Linking Flower. It grows in the Feather-Shedding Land, beneath the nest of a Surging Peace bird. I acquired it during my travels when I was at the Foundation Establishment Realm. It has been with me for many years. It is perfect to repay Senior's kindness."

"Thank you, brother!"

Fuxun was overjoyed. He very carefully took the stone box and passed it to Li Ximing. Liu Changdie, however, frowned with some concern and reminded them,

"If we only use one portion of Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources, no matter how high Ximing's skill is, the resulting pills will still have that as their origin. Giving that to the King of Vermilion Luo… seems a bit like bullying."

This was true. Even if Li Ximing produced six or seven pills from one furnace, at most it would be the equivalent of refining two portions of spiritual resources. To trade that for a Spirit Fire, even with Fuxun's promise of protection, the difference in value was simply too great…

Li Ximing wasn't afraid of any consequences, but he was wary that the other party might actually have some backbone and just abandon the Vermilion Luo Kingdom and flee. The three of them wouldn't dare do anything to her ancestral homeland, and that would mean trouble for his own Moongaze Lake.

Seeing the two of them in a bind, Li Ximing smiled, for Liu Changdie's sake. He also took a stone box from his sleeve, revealing the Surging Li Treasure Leaf. He said softly,

"A Li Fire Purple Mansion Realm resource, the Surging Li Treasure Leaf, from a spirit flower in the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven."

As soon as he said this, Liu Changdie looked secretly troubled and hesitant, but Fuxun was ecstatic,

"Daoist Friend is truly a straightforward man!"

Liu Changdie could only transmit his voice silently using his dharma power,

"I will be sure to repay you for this, Ximing!"

Having settled their plan, the three did not rest for a moment. They tore open the Great Void and ascended from that place. Fuxun led the way, explaining,

"This Demon beast actually has some skill. Her name is Huo Yang, and she is a pheasant bird cultivating Li Fire. Her divine ability is in her beak. She's not much in a regular fight, but she learned a move from her ancestors—when she suddenly spits that mouthful of fire, even I have to retreat… But once that one mouthful of fire is spent, she's not much of a character!"

He appeared majestic and full of confidence. Then his tone shifted, filled with reverence,

"But her ancestor was formidable. He sired True Fire in his sons and Li Fire in his daughters. Back when her ancestor was alive, even my grandfather had to pay him respects. The Vermilion Luo Kingdom once ruled over half of Poluoduo. That Vermilion Bird from the Baijia Kingdom, how arrogant is she? But I heard she used to shamelessly call him 'uncle'… If he had successfully broken through, Poluoduo might have seen the rebuilding of the ancient Pheasant-Sparrow Kingdom!"

Li Ximing stroked his beard. Liu Changdie smiled and explained,

"This land beneath our feet, we in Jiangnan call it the Southern Borderlands. But the Southern Borderlands are vast. The territory north of the Piaoren Kingdom and below the Great Western Plateau is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, almost splitting the northern Southern Sea in two. We call this place Poluoduo."

Li Ximing nodded. Fuxun continued,

"Back then, he tried to attest True Fire. Even the master of the Tree of One Heart came to watch. But alas, he failed at the final step, his body perished, and his Dao vanished. Once the demon was gone, the "tea grew cold." His flames were carved up, and the Vermilion Luo Kingdom has shrunk almost entirely to its island."

In the time it took to exchange a few sentences, they had already arrived at the Vermilion Luo Kingdom. The land was teeming with birds, and red oxen were draped in cloth. Fires burned everywhere, and the jungle was tall and crimson. Fuxun tore through the Great Void all the way, leading the two of them to a massive, crimson palace. He called out,

"Daoist Friend Huo Yang! Come out, quickly!"

As expected of a family that was once magnificent, this palace was far more splendid than his own pagoda. More importantly, Li Ximing sensed carefully and could actually feel the aura of a Purple Mansion Realm grand array over the palace. He nodded to himself,

'Ordinary Demon beasts naturally wouldn't have access to arrays. But with a great demon king in her ancestry, it wouldn't be a problem to invite a few Immortal Formations Masters to build one.'

He was fine, but the moment Liu Changdie saw the palace, his eyes lit up, and he couldn't walk another step. He stroked his chin, tilted his head, and studied it intently.

After a short while, a figure leaped out from the crimson expanse. It was a young woman with red hair and a white dress. Her pupils were crimson-black, and flame-like runes dotted her cheeks. Her collar was covered in dense True Fire patterns, and her two sleeves flowed like wings. She was actually quite beautiful. A crimson whip was coiled around her waist. Seeing such a large contingent, she stopped cautiously before the array, adopted a submissive posture, and said softly,
"So, it is Senior Fuxun… Has something happened?"

Fuxun laughed.

"What could happen… I heard from a few friends that that stupid bird is always coming to find trouble with you… I've brought you a business deal, and it will also solve your little problem."

"Oh?"

Fuxun and the Vermilion Bird from Baijia Kingdom had never gotten along. His words naturally carried a high degree of credibility. The woman smiled back. She couldn't afford to offend him now, so she replied meekly,

"Then, please."

She came out from the array and guided the three to a side hall to sit. Immediately, several young women came to serve wine.

These Demon beasts didn't bother with pleasantries. Fuxun cut straight to the chase, smiling,

"Let's not waste words. This is Daoist Friend Zhaojing from Jiangnan. He is a top-tier Alchemist, so renowned that he's unmatched in the mainland, and even the Supreme Yang Dao must give way to him!"

Li Ximing was just lifting his cup. Fuxun's words nearly made him jump. But he couldn't expose the bluff. He silently gritted his teeth, stood up, and bowed. Upon hearing this, the woman's vermilion lips parted slightly in great surprise. She said repeatedly,

"I have been truly negligent!"

To the Demon beasts of the Southern Borderlands, alchemy was a rare commodity, let alone skill that was "unmatched in Jiangnan." Huo Yang clearly showed a desire to get closer, smiling,

"If I could receive a Daoist Master's help in refining pills, it would be my greatest fortune."

Before her words even faded, Fuxun jumped in with a smile,

"That's exactly the idea… Daoist Friend Zhaojing is in urgent need of a Spirit Fire and wants to trade for it. The pills are negotiable… We can resolve your cultivation obstacles."

Huo Yang's smile faltered for a second. Understanding their purpose, she kept her smile in place and said in a low voice,

"When my father was alive, we truly had many resources. After he died, my elder brother wounded me and fled with all the resources… Senior knows this…"

Fuxun's expression didn't change. He smiled.

"You definitely have a Spirit Fire. The Heavenly Pheasant Mystic-Attachment Array is right here. Even if he stole the array foundation, wouldn't there still be a Spirit Fire left? I cultivate the Good Merit Register, so… I won't say more."

The atmosphere immediately became awkward. Li Ximing was inwardly astonished, thinking,

'What a bizarre divine ability! It must be a Life Divine Ability! It doesn't manipulate people's minds, but instead proceeds righteously in the direction of cultivating one's destiny. I wonder what marvels it holds!'

Liu Changdie, at his side, was not surprised, but Huo Yang's expression was stiff. Li Ximing, who had been observing her as a Li Fire cultivator, immediately spoke up,

"Senior's words are too serious. We are only here for a trade, with no other intentions. If Daoist Friend is willing, I will surely present you with superior spirit pills. The quantity and quality will not disappoint you."

Fuxun turned to sip his wine, saying faintly,

"I will handle the matter with that Vermilion Bird. In addition, I will owe you a favor."

Huo Yang's eyes visibly brightened. A lively smile returned to her face.

"I am grateful for the consideration you have all shown me. Although the resources in the palace were stolen, and the Spirit Fire my father transformed into was divided, I still have one portion saved."

"It's just the pills…"

Li Ximing smiled faintly, replying briskly,

"I can refine them right now!"

In the end, every one of them wouldn't act without seeing a benefit. Once the offer was good enough, her memory became clear, and she suddenly remembered she had a Spirit Fire. Huo Yang was now clearly interested in forming a bond, smiling,

"When my father was alive, he had a Palace of Slumbering Li. The True Fire vein within it is one of the marvels of this world. Please, you three!"

Demon beasts acted with less trouble and fuss than the people of Jiangnan. Once the deal was struck in a few sentences, they immediately entered the palace array, crossed seventy-two golden steps, and arrived at a grand hall that looked like it was made of crystal.

Li Ximing raised his eyebrows slightly. The place was utterly magnificent, with feathers scattered everywhere. The throne in the center was as large as a small mountain, and every surface was painted with True Fire and gold patterns. The very center of the hall was a perfect hexagon, where the golden light of the array circulated above, each reflecting the other.

But having seen the wonders of the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, this place, while magnificent, lacked a certain profoundness. The only thing that attracted him was the large script on the pillars at either side. The brushstrokes were like dragons, emitting a crimson-red light. They were written casually, yet were perfectly natural, making it impossible to look away.

'True Fire snaps the pillar, yet bids Li to act. Four methods query nature, why speak of perfection!'

Li Ximing scanned it once, silently memorizing it, then turned to the grand array. He smiled.

"I wonder about the feathers in this hall…"

The woman looked a little wistful. "My father placed them here. They are what he shed before his breakthrough…"

Li Ximing nodded inwardly and asked,

"I wonder if I might borrow a few."

Huo Yang smiled.

"Use as many as you like. My kind has enormous bodies. When we shed our feathers, countless spiritual feathers fall… It's just that after seven days, they lose most of their spiritual nature."

Li Ximing didn't much care. He turned to inspect the fire vein.

The Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art he used was a method of refining pills by uniting an 'intent'. Although these feathers weren't precious, they were shed by a Purple Mansion Realm great demon before his breakthrough, so their "rank" was not low.

'This fire vein is indeed pure True Fire, exceptionally refined… Truly a rarity in this world. I wonder how many generations of demons it took. Gardenia Scenery Mountain cannot compare, and it is hard to find its equal even in Jiangnan…'

His mind was made up,

"Using the True Fire vein, supplemented by the True Fire flame, they will be the 'parents'. The Li Fire will be the pill, which is the 'middle daughter'. The pill Dao is set."

This Daoist principle was easy to find, but the balance was extremely difficult to grasp. He immediately took Huo Yang's feathers and a drop of her essence blood, told the three to stand guard outside, and only then took out the Treasure Elephant Cauldron. He used the 'father-daughter' intent to correspond to the 'flower-leaf' sign of the Surging Li Treasure Leaf and the Red Petrel Heart-Linking Flower, and ignited the cauldron to refine the pills.

For a time, the triple-phased fire raged, and the color of the sky changed. The two demons and one human chatted outside. After a full half-month, a faint golden mist began to drift from the hall, refreshing the heart and spirit. Birds chirped, and the serving girls walking by couldn't help but slow their steps to inhale a few more breaths, making Huo Yang turn her head silently, her heart full of distracted anticipation.

She did indeed have the Spirit Fire, but her ancestors' legacy had long since been emptied by her brother. After using up the few treasures she had, she didn't know how long it had been since she'd had a single high-quality spirit pill…

Another half-month passed. Finally, the man in the white-gold Daoist robes flew out of the great hall, smiling,

"Daoist Friends!"

Huo Yang shot up from her seat. She saw him present a jade box. On the bottom of the gold-silk-lined box sat eight spirit pills.

Each pill was in the shape of a bird, encircled with glowing, iridescent feather patterns. Every tiny wisp of down was distinct, and they emitted a faint glow. If one listened closely, one could hear the faint chirping of birds.

At this moment, all three were stunned. Fuxun and Huo Yang were each happy for their own reasons. Even Liu Changdie stroked his beard and sighed to himself,

'I knew in my past life that his pill art was astonishing, but I never thought that after breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, he would rise to another level. Eight pills in one furnace… Calling him number one in Jiangnan might be too much, but he can certainly leave others in the dust!'

Li Ximing smiled,

"This pill is named, Embracing-Feather Uniting-Heart Pill. It is a Li Fire pill, but it was born of True Fire, making it perfectly suited for your Dao path, Daoist Friend. It can stimulate your bloodline, grow your divine marvels, and unite your dao. It is custom-made for you. If others were to take it, the effect would be far inferior!"

Huo Yang was overjoyed. She inspected the pills carefully. The quality and quantity clearly exceeded her expectations, not to mention the unique ingenuity that made them so compatible with her. Just by smelling them, she knew they would be of great help to her divine ability and could shorten her years of cultivation.

Looking at it this way, this trade was even more beneficial. She said joyfully,
"Daoist Friend's pill art… even the legendary Yanque of old… would have to compete to determine who is superior!"

She very preciously put the box away, raised her two sleeves, which looked as if they were draped in feathers, and lifted them gently.

"Go!"

A stream of apricot-red fire immediately flew from her sleeve. It transformed in mid-air into a palm-sized, apricot-red Spirit Sparrow. Its eyes were black and bright, extremely nimble. It landed on her fingertip, lifting its beak to look at them.

Although she knew she had to part with it, a Spirit Fire was incredibly precious. She stroked the Spirit Sparrow's head with great reluctance, her voice low,
"Purple Mansion Realm Li Fire, Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame. It dissolves malice, harmonises qi, surges to peace and stirs the profound. It is a flame of magnificent and proper bearing, able to break through disaster and difficulty, and refine all metals. Its primary uses are nourishing the spirit and moving the heart."

"This fire has been with me for eighty-one years… Today… I gift it to you, Daoist Friend!"

Liu Changdie Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Purple Mansion Array Master

Fu○xun Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm

Li Ximing Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Purple Mansion Alchemist

Huo Yang Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm



# Chapter 930: The Harmonising and Vault Lock

Li Ximing's spirits soared, a sense of quiet relief washing over him. He smiled reservedly, nodding, and sighed inwardly:

‘This is exactly the kind of Li Fire I needed! It couldn't be more convenient.’

Though he possessed the Intercalary Sun Art, which allowed him to convert most spiritual flames, he had used it only a few times back in the Foundation Establishment Realm. The last time, when he converted his family's Long-March Pheasant Flame, the cost was immense, leaving him with a deep-seated ache in his wallet.

At the Purple Mansion Realm, the cost of such a conversion would be astronomical. If it required precious Purple Mansion-level resources to assist, the trouble would be even greater, making the whole affair less than ideal.

Moreover, there were only a finite number of spiritual flames in the world. Using the Intercalary Sun Art too often would inevitably draw unwanted attention. The fact that Huo Yang, a cultivator of Li Fire, could simply offer a suitable flame was a double blessing!

He stared at the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame, unable to tear his eyes away. Spiritual flames were treasures coveted by all, and the Demon beast and Liu Changdie next to him immediately cast envious glances.

The pill had yet to be refined, so the Li Fire should have been in Fuxun's care. However, due to Liu Changdie's presence, Fuxun didn't step forward to receive the flame. He hesitated in place, making no move, clearly showing respect and intending to let Li Ximing take it directly.

Huo Yang glanced at the two and held the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame suspended in her palm, speaking in a measured tone.

"The Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame is not known for its destructive power among Li Fires. It cannot compare to first-rate flames like the Incinerating Li Fire of the Fold or the Heavenly Apricot Rain, but it surpasses others like the Fatal Intercalary Flame and the Violent Proclamation Karma Flame. Purely in terms of power, it is a mid-tier flame."

"However, its true marvel lies in its ability to break through baleful influences and disrupt balanced spiritual energy. It rejects nothing, merging and refining all kinds of chaotic Li Fire Qi and Baleful Earth, burning them into nothingness."

"But its greatest fame comes from the spiritual essence of the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame itself."

When it came to understanding True Fires and Li Fires, no one present could compare to Huo Yang. Both Li Ximing and Fuxun listened intently as the woman continued.

"Among all Li Fires, the Red Pheasant is the most spiritual—that is, this Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame. It can be commanded and even questioned. You can send it to perform tasks or fight enemies. This spiritual essence is innately formed and cannot be increased or decreased. It is extremely potent…"

"No matter how powerful a secret art is used to extinguish its spiritual essence, it will slowly recover. Yet, everything has its pros and cons. The inability to increase or decrease is not an empty phrase. Not a single extra shred of spiritual essence can be added. Even if it gains some fortune and its essence grows, it will slowly weaken back to its original state. Since ancient times, many have cultivated spiritual flames to become spiritual practitioners, but never the Red Pheasant. This is precisely why."

Li Ximing pondered this, nodding with great interest. The nearby Liu Changdie also seemed to gain some insight. After explaining the benefits, Huo Yang looked slightly awkward, continuing,

"The Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame is a Li Fire, and it has the usual temperament of one. It is not suited for pill-refining or artifact-crafting. Although you have already reached the Purple Mansion Realm and your alchemy is astonishing, it is not impossible to use the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame to refine a pill... it simply offers no benefit."

This was why she felt awkward. In the eyes of others, an Alchemist seeking a flame would naturally want one that aids in pill-refining. Taking out a genuine Li Fire like this, with its specific temperament, seemed like a waste.

But Li Ximing needed a Li Fire for his own purposes, so he listened intently. Huo Yang continued:

"As for its use in spell arts, it fears no earth virtue save for the Sheji. It can oppose the water virtue and incinerate metal and stone. But those are matters of Daoist tradition and need not be discussed."

The tiny apricot-colored bird perched on Huo Yang's fingertip surveyed the surroundings, its gaze soon settling on Li Ximing, where it remained. Li Ximing suspected that the Valley Wind Guide-Fire was working its magic, and not wanting to reveal any strangeness, he simply said with a joyful expression:

"I am truly grateful for your generosity, fellow Daoist!"

As soon as he spoke, the little apricot-colored bird floated up and landed in his palm. It felt only lukewarm, and he could even feel the soft, trembling feathers of the bird.

‘Finally! The Great Parting's White Brilliance has been gathering dust for so many years; now I can finally cultivate it!’

Without a second thought, Li Ximing moved his mind.

*Valley Wind Guide-Fire!*

Huo Yang had already erased her brand on the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame. It offered no real resistance, and in an instant, Li Ximing refined it, truly making it his spiritual flame.

He flipped his hand, and the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame disappeared, reappearing within his Dharma Body. It broke through the raging purple flames and settled within the Juque Palace.

The Juque Palace had originally been the domain of the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire. The two spiritual flames, both at the Purple Mansion level, should have clashed, but they didn't even manage to produce a single spark. The wondrous Talisman Qi immediately went to work, and the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire instantly subdued itself, obediently dividing its territory in half for the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame.

And so, the Juque Palace was now half apricot-red and half a true red tinged with gold, with a clear boundary separating them.

The other three Purple Mansion cultivators did not notice this fluctuation. They didn't even think he had refined the flame, only that he had used some unique method to store it. Huo Yang smiled, seizing the moment to turn to Fuxun and say:

"I leave the future of our Zhuluo Kingdom in your hands, senior."

With Li Ximing having already obtained the spiritual flame, Fuxun would have feared he would turn and run if it weren't for the reassurance of Liu Changdie. At the moment, he had no mind to say more. He nodded silently, indicating he had accepted the task, and said no more.

Huo Yang, seeing his distracted state, did not delay. She escorted them all the way out of the great array. Before they departed, she looked at Li Ximing with a hint of anticipation.

"I hear that a messenger of yours is coming to Poluoduo. If you have the opportunity, you can leave a message for me in the Zhuluo Kingdom. If I acquire some good spiritual resources in the future, I hope you will grace me with your presence and refine a pill for me."

"Of course… of course."

Other pills might be difficult, but a Li Fire pill would be more than enough for Li Ximing. Since it was something he would benefit from, he naturally wouldn't refuse. He patted his chest and agreed, after which the group set off back to the Xipo Kingdom.

"Congratulations, Ximing!"

When they arrived at the Great Void, Liu Changdie immediately offered his congratulations. Li Ximing was also overjoyed to have the spiritual flame in his possession, so much so that he was a little absent-minded. For one, he wanted to test the power and marvel of the Li Fire. For another, he wanted to begin cultivating the Great Parting's White Brilliance.

But he still remembered Fuxun's matter and did not appear too smug. He shook his head and said in a low voice:

"Not yet. It will only be worth celebrating after fellow Daoist Fuxun's pill has been refined!"

At these words, Fuxun's smile became noticeably more genuine. He led them back on their way, and Li Ximing said:

"I'll have to borrow a Purple Mansion Spiritual Cauldron, which means a trip back to Jiangnan. Senior Changdie…"

"Just call me fellow Daoist!"

When talk turned to returning to Jiangnan, Liu Changdie's expression clearly soured. He fell silent, and it took him a while to reply.

"I'm not afraid of you knowing, Ximing… As a rogue cultivator, my ability to reach the Purple Mansion Realm naturally came from a great fortune. Back in my youth, I was reckless and didn't know the immensity of the world. I stumbled and struggled, coming all the way from Jiangnan, believing that everything was going smoothly. In reality, I was walking on a tightrope over a pool of hellfire. Pitifully, the ignorant fear nothing, and I was completely unaware of the danger!"

After he spoke, both Li Ximing and Fuxun were silent. The fortune was self-evident. It was impossible for a rogue cultivator to reach the Purple Mansion Realm without one. The likes of Yehui and Changxiao had only achieved the Purple Mansion Realm after gaining a fortune within a grotto heaven!

Liu Changdie clasped his hands behind his back and said quietly:

"Later, after I had seen a few things and left Jiangnan for the Southern Sea, I finally achieved a divine ability. When I looked back, I realized the dangers of my path… I thought I had done everything perfectly, but which of those high and mighty divine ability users was truly unaware? All the way along, the various Purple Mansion cultivators and Supreme Yang Daoist tradition who silently watched from the sidelines, and even the seniors on the lake… they all knew!"

"These Purple Mansion cultivators chose to ignore me simply because the karma on me was too great, and they didn't dare to get involved."

His expression was desolate as he said softly:

"Now that I know the truth, I am even more afraid to go back. What is the mainland? A place where divine ability users walk everywhere and True Monarchs manifest their presence. The spiritual essence has changed three times in a century, and the North and South are like a chessboard… it is the center of the world's winds and clouds. The more unique a person is, the more they dare not venture into its depths!"

His words were not without reason, and Li Ximing fell silent.

‘Who is it not the same for? If my family did not have the bloodline of the Bright Yang, what reason would we have had to rise so quickly on the lake? We would have long been wiped out by the divine ability users of the North and South. But precisely because of the Bright Yang bloodline, the suspicions of all the world's divine ability users have been assuaged, but it has also confined my family to this single square on the board, unable to move!’

He suddenly thought of Yehui. Li Ximing paused for a moment and asked:

"While the North and South are the center of the world's storms, they are also the location of its greatest fortunes. Now that you have achieved a divine ability, with a lifespan of five hundred years and a profound fortune, do you not have the ambition to ascend to the top?"

Liu Changdie remained silent for a long time, then said with a note of melancholy:

"You see my divine ability, but can you recognize its dao?"

This had long been a question for Li Ximing. Most dao, once seen, are hard to hide. A slight display of power would be noticed by others. But Liu Changdie's aura had been contained from beginning to end, his divine ability never revealed. It was impossible to tell what it was!

Seeing Li Ximing shake his head, Liu Changdie raised his hand and revealed his palm. A single silver orb of light was dancing within it, constantly switching and leaping between square and circular forms, radiating a profound and mystical aura.

Li Ximing looked at it closely, then said, "I have never heard of it, nor seen it… it seems to be of the Metal Virtue…"

"Correct!"

Liu Changdie's expression was complex. He said in a low voice:

"The cultivation manual I practice is the *Manual of the Daoist Profound Succession*, which I obtained from the ruined grotto-mansion of a fallen senior cultivator. It is a rank six manual, with a spiritual qi known as Profound-Lock Daoist Metal Qi. It was born from the Profound-Daoist Vault Metal being illuminated by the Supreme Yang. This is a thing that has been severed not just in the present age, but since the Middle Ages!"

"At the time, how could I have ever seen such a powerful thing? I eagerly took up the manual, deeming it a great treasure. I finally cultivated this Dao, and its power was so restrained that its uniqueness was not apparent. Ordinary people only thought my Immortal Foundation was good…"

"Back then, I was young and did not recognize my own Dao. I only knew that its rank was high and that it was precious. I dared not reveal it to others. I took on a different name for my Immortal Foundation and spent a great deal of money to buy several related Dharma Artifacts, using them to cast spells to pretend to be of another Dao…"

"I was cautious for many years, all the way until I broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm…"

He said wistfully:

"Ximing, do you know of the two metals outside the Three Metals?"

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat.

The world had the Three Metals of Geng-Dui-Xiao (Wandering). This was something everyone knew. But the other two metals were not something the Li family knew much about, yet they were not completely ignorant. Back when Li Zhouwei went to the Thunder Pool to visit Li Qinghong, he had mentioned this matter.

Li Qinghong's identity was special, and she could no longer easily meet with Li family members. But Li Zhouwei had later recounted to him:

‘The Harmonising Metal that the Wang clan's Daoist Master took away that year was one of the two metals. These two Daos have long been severed, difficult to cultivate and impossible to prove. For a thousand years, the number of Purple Mansion cultivators of these two Daos could be counted on one hand. They were all geniuses who mistakenly entered this crooked path, and all perished during the early stages of the Purple Mansion Realm!’

Li Ximing said in a daze:

"You cultivate the Harmonising Metal?!"

The words Harmonising Metal coming from Li Ximing's mouth were clearly unexpected for Liu Changdie. He was slightly stunned, then shook his head with a sigh.

"You have a good eye, Ximing. It seems you know quite a bit… Although I don't cultivate the Harmonising Metal, it is one of the two metals—it is the Vault Metal."

"The Vault Metal…"

Li Ximing's heart was filled with an indescribable mixture of emotions. The nearby Fuxun sighed softly, evidently having known this for a long time. He turned away and said nothing. After a moment of silence, Li Ximing asked:

"Could it be that the inheritance you received from the ancestor… was only this one divine ability?"

Liu Changdie nodded, saying wistfully:

"Exactly. It's much more than just that… In the world today, even the Foundation Establishment Realm manuals for the Harmonising and Vault Metals are harder to find than the Purple Mansion manuals of ordinary Daoist traditions!"

Li Ximing frowned, asking:

"How could it be like this…"

Liu Changdie sighed.

"Because the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was born long after the two metals, the Harmonising and Vault, could no longer be cultivated! Why would the various Daoist traditions study a Dao that is fundamentally uncultivable? Only a few people who refused to give up would try to change it. How could everything be preserved through the passage of time?"

At this point, he could no longer remain calm. Gritting his teeth, he said:

"Thinking back now, how could a remnant from before the Middle Ages have such a simple array? How could a mere junior like me have obtained it? This was a scheme! Someone's scheme! A truly magnificent scheme!"

Li Ximing froze for a moment, and then everything became clear in his mind.

‘He obtained some kind of fortune, perhaps like Ling Yanzi that year, it connected him to some terrifyingly powerful being. As a result, they couldn't calculate his fate or harm him directly, for fear of some unknown consequences…’

‘So they created a so-called ancestral remains, leaving behind some treasures that were extremely valuable to a Qi Refining cultivator, along with a Vault Metal manual. Then they used it as a public test!’

Indeed, even a good-natured person like Liu Changdie could not help but speak in a cold voice now.

"This cultivation manual leads to a severed Dao. Not only do the elite cultivators not know about it, but even ordinary Purple Mansion cultivators are ignorant. They would even think it's precious. How could a mere Qi Refining junior refuse it?!"

"And to make sure I would fall for it, they even took out such a high-rank manual. What's more, the spiritual qi, the Profound-Lock Daoist Metal Qi, is something that the Profound-Daoist Vault Metal can continuously give birth to when illuminated by the Supreme Yang. For those who have it, it is a continuous source. For those who don't, it's as precious as the heavens…"

He stopped abruptly at this point.

They were both young Purple Mansion cultivators. Even Li Ximing, who had no great ambition, held the thought of passing the Purple Mystery trial. How could they accept that they would only ever have one divine ability in this life? The hatred in their hearts was hard to articulate. Only Fuxun, unable to watch any longer, sighed and said:

"There is always a way out. Even if no one for a thousand years has been able to cultivate it, perhaps the key lies with you… Don't be so pessimistic…"

While they spoke, the group had already returned to the Xipo Kingdom and sat in the previous pavilion. The night had already fallen. The brilliant five-hued light shone brightly all around. Fuxun poured wine for Liu Changdie, who drank it in a single gulp, and said in a low voice:

"You don't understand. The fall of a thousand-year genius is not without reason… I cultivate the *Manual of the Daoist Profound Succession*, and I have also occasionally gained some minor fortunes. Now that I have my Purple Mansion divine ability, I can sense the Harmonising and Vault Metals, and only now do I understand a few things."

"The two Daos of Harmonising and Vault already had occupants. Two True Monarchs left long ago, venturing beyond the heavens. But not everyone has the magnanimity of Tianwu, who allows later generations to ascend. These two wished to preserve their Fruition Attainment, so that if something were to change outside the heavens, they could, by some miracle, reincarnate and return. So the two True Monarchs worked together to cast a divine art, connecting their Fruition Attainments…"

He said in a low voice:

"There are three Metal Virtues: Geng, Wandering, and Dui. Of the remaining two Daos, Harmonising Metal is the metal that collects, and Vault Metal is the metal that is collected. The two True Monarchs merged their Fruition Attainments, taking one as the other's Dao fruit, and they actually stored the Vault Metal's Fruition Attainment like an object within the Harmonising Metal's Fruition Attainment!"

"And with that, the collected metal was collected, and the collecting metal was completed. The lock was linked, forming **[The Harmonising and Vault Lock]**. Who can prove it? Who can prove it? It's harder than ascending to the heavens!"

"To put it bluntly, after the Harmonising and Vault Lock, it is a far more brilliant scheme than merely a severed Dao. Not even conversion is possible anymore. The one who seeks to prove this Dao must not only prove their status, but must also, with their own power, separate the mutual lock between the two Dao fruits that not even True Monarchs could separate for thousands of years."

He laughed mockingly.

"How hard is that? I don't need to tell you."

Liu Changdie truly had a great fortune. Now, he regarded both Li Ximing and Fuxun as his closest companions, so he spilled all these secrets in one go. Both Li Ximing and Fuxun were too shocked to speak for a time.

It was not until Liu Changdie had drunk several cups of wine and the jug was empty that Fuxun finally sighed.

"I heard others say that the world has three metals, and it has always been so. I never thought the true secret lay here!"

With this burden off his chest, Liu Changdie slowly relaxed, laughing at himself.

"I am no longer willing to return to Jiangnan… but the Vault Metal divine ability still holds many wonders. I can always help Ximing. What I cultivated is the Vault-Beam Silver. Putting aside other things, opening up some array or secret vault, or nurturing some Golden Essence resources… those are no problem."

"I have no family left. Even if I did… they would have long since passed away. I've roamed the world for a century, all alone, with a severed path. I have nothing but a lot of trouble, and I am not easy to command. But when it comes to doing something wondrous, you can always come to me."

Li Ximing could only console him in a low voice, sighing inwardly for him. He knew that Liu Changdie would never return to Jiangnan now. He also abandoned the thought of asking him to take a look at the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. Instead, he simply said,

"The two of you wait a moment. I'll go back to Jiangnan for a bit."

Fuxun was naturally full of anticipation. He escorted Li Ximing out of the Xipo Kingdom and then returned with the wind, seeing Liu Changdie still drinking in the pavilion. He could not help but sigh,

"It's rare to see you willing to say so much!"

Liu Changdie just shook his head silently. Now that Li Ximing was gone, he could finally let his emotions show. His eyes were filled with loss and unease.

"In this life, I've achieved a divine ability, and I'll enjoy five hundred years… but I can't return to my hometown, and all my family and friends are gone. If you, Ximing, had not become a Purple Mansion cultivator, I would have certainly stayed at this Sea's Cape, dealing with demon beasts until I died of old age…"

He only said half of what was on his mind. What he was truly thinking about was his hundred years of a fulfilling life in a previous life, with a wife and children. After a long while, he said,

"This divine ability… is quite a price to pay!"

Fuxun refilled his cup. Instead of being sad, he laughed.

"Isn't it so? For a divine ability, I can dig out my father's heart from his corpse to refine into a pill. Not only to refine pills, but to eat the rest of his body completely. What of all else?"

"The fact that you can have this thought today is likely because your Dao has been severed. If it weren't for this, how could you even make a comparison? The Dao, divine ability, Fruition Attainment… they are all precious things. Precious enough that nothing else can compare!"



# Chapter 931, Great Parting's Radiance

The Great Void was turbulent, and Li Ximing journeyed back. While traveling, he idly absorbed spiritual qi and cultivated. He soon arrived at Tiger's Frontier Mountain, discovering the entire peak to be a stark white. One, from a recent frost, and two, from the white cloth hung everywhere in mourning for the fallen Daoist Masters. Although the mourning period was over, the white cloth had not yet been taken down.

"It's a truly sorrowful event…"

The Great Xiukui Monastery had lost two Purple Mansion cultivators, one a Great Daoist Master who had passed the Purple Mystery and cultivated to become a Sword Immortal with four divine abilities, and the other a Daoist Master from the Lin clan, in the prime of his life, with three divine abilities, who was seen as a future leader of the Daoist tradition… and both in a single day! The loss was as great as the distance between heaven and earth, a truly tragic event.

Even after Li Ximing's arrival, the mountain still felt listless. When they heard his news, the current genius of the Great Xiukui Monastery, Lin Ya, a descendant of Houfu, hurried down the mountain to greet him. He bowed respectfully and said,

"Sorry to have kept you waiting, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing nodded with a hint of emotion. He casually glanced around the mountain and smiled.

"When the Fei clan moved to the county, did anyone plead on their behalf?"

At this, Lin Ya bowed and replied,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, they all failed at the monastery. They were implicated because of Fei Qing'yi, and Fei Qingya have not been kind to them. A few days ago, a female cultivator came from the sea, claiming to be from the Fei clan, Fei Qingyi, an Azure Pond cultivator. She kept asking for a way in, and even knelt before the gate of our Great Xiukui Monastery, claiming her kinsman was foolish and the clan members innocent, hoping our Daoist tradition would be lenient in its punishment."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing was not surprised. Whether or not the woman was sincere, the Fei clan had suffered a great calamity, and for her to come and plead on their behalf was only natural. If she had sat idly by, those who used her in the Azure Pond would have to be wary of her.

However, she had always been clear-headed in her dealings. She knew it would be inappropriate and offensive to plead on the lake, so she chose to plead at the Great Xiukui Monastery.

Li Ximing gave a light response, and Lin Ya continued,

"At the time, the sect had just lost a Daoist Master. Everyone was deeply grieved and angry, and had no good feelings towards traitors. We made her kneel for three days. It was Fei Qingya who came down from the mountain and took her into her cave dwelling."

His tone was very flat when he spoke of Fei Qingya, without the slightest familiarity one would have when speaking of a sect genius. He was too cold. Clearly, with her personality, Fei Qingya was not very well-liked at the Great Xiukui Monastery.

Lin Ya even frowned slightly and said in a low voice,

"Later, when she came out of the cave dwelling again, Fei Qingya had a look of great respect and was already calling her 'older sister'."

"She's clever!"

Li Ximing shook his head with a laugh. He hadn't thought of that at the time, but now that he considered it, it was a good strategy.

‘Fei Qingyi grew up in the shadow of her ancestor being slain as a formation core, and she was raised in the treacherous mud of the Azure Pond's Yuanwu Peak. After all these years, she was able to land a good branch, even one belonging to her family's enemies. Her mind and methods are naturally not what the simple Fei Qingya's can compare to… it wouldn't be hard for her to manipulate Fei Qingya with a few words! ’

‘Her purpose for coming here was not simply to plead. First, she had to satisfy appearances. Second… how could she not try to climb this high branch?’

The Fei clan's juniors did not have a good opinion of Fei Qingyi. Fei Qingya had lived there for many years and obviously knew she had an aloof older cousin who flew to a high branch without a second thought. Otherwise, why would she have let her kneel at the mountain gate for three days? Although this sister of hers was more sensible than Fei Qingfei, she was still naive. She only had to hear a few words… and she was immediately calling her "older sister".

This was the Great Xiukui Monastery's problem. Looking at Lin Ya's expression, he must have felt it deeply. Li Ximing did not want to mention it further. He asked about Daoist Master Houfu's whereabouts, and Lin Ya replied,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, Senior Cheng Gao of the Sword Gate failed to achieve a divine ability and perished yesterday… Our family has some familial ties to him, so the Daoist Master went to the Sword Gate. He just returned this morning and is at the peak of Tiger's Frontier Mountain."

Li Ximing was first stunned, then he sighed softly.

This Senior Cheng Gao was not very old. He had once been close to Li Yuanjiao and was a leading figure of the last generation of the Sword Gate. His chances of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm were not small, but many people fail to achieve a divine ability, and it's often inexplicable.

"What a pity! How is the Sword Gate?"

He gave a response, and as they walked to the peak, Lin Ya hesitated, then answered,

"I heard that the Sword Gate is in great chaos right now."

Li Ximing was taken aback, but Houfu had already come out of the courtyard to greet him. Lin Ya immediately retreated without saying anything more.

Houfu's expression was not good, but he was still polite to Li Ximing. After they exchanged a few pleasantries, Houfu somberly put down his cup without waiting for Li Ximing to bring up the topic.

"I imagine Zhaojing has heard… Cheng Gao has perished."

Li Ximing frowned. "He failed to achieve a divine ability?"

Houfu's tone turned a little cold. "Only half."

"His cultivation manual was special, and he had a better chance of breaking through on the Western Heaven Plateau, so he cultivated in a secret grotto-mansion nearby."

"Three months ago, the conflict between the White Victory Dao and the Great And Illustrious Peace Temple gradually came to an end. The entire Great Western Plateau basically fell into the hands of the White Victory Dao, leaving only Luosuo, where the Great And Illustrious Peace Temple was located. Those unorthodox sects began to fight there, and they battled all the way to Shu, collapsing nine mountain ranges."

Li Ximing clearly saw Houfu's eyes turn ruthless. This new leader of the Great Xiukui Monastery was clearly not as dignified as his predecessor but was instead a little more vicious. His tone, however, was calm,

"The Great And Illustrious Peace Temple's Merciful Ones and that domesticated Demon beast both perished there. At the same time, the earth shook, and the earth veins, spiritual veins, and spiritual essence all changed… especially the earth veins. Even many nearby arrays failed. Cheng Gao happened to be cultivating in that area. His divine ability failed to cross, and his life and soul were extinguished."

Upon hearing this, Li Ximing understood and felt a chill. He probed,

"It probably wasn't an accident…"

Houfu scoffed. Li Ximing frowned and said,

"I remember… a Ni clan's Purple Mansion cultivator and a Sword Gate Daoist Master were guarding Shu… why didn't they step in and protect him?"

Houfu shook his head.

"They already tried to protect him… A fight on the scale of the White Victory Dao and the Great And Illustrious Peace Temple would cause concern for a feint. Daoist Master Hongyan of the Ni clan was guarding Long, and it was not convenient for him to go to a secret place anyway, and Daoist Master Cheng's job was to stabilize the earth veins… everyone can see through that. It's an attempt to hide the truth."

Li Ximing was speechless. He found the reasoning sound. After all, when two parties are fighting, if an outsider comes to stabilize the earth veins, wouldn't that be a clear sign of a hidden motive? He replied,

"It's indeed a difficult situation. If he didn't go, he could only watch it happen. If he did, it would be a self-incrimination. Neither of those two factions are good people… this was an open conspiracy."

Houfu rubbed his brow and nodded silently. He replied,

"Cheng Gao was not an ordinary person… he was the only member of the Cheng clan to have married outside, and he was a disciple of Senior Lingmei. Compared to Daoist Master Jiuwen's ambiguous attitude, he was the only important direct descendant of the Cheng clan who explicitly supported joining the world and not giving up on Shu."

Li Ximing frowned, musing to himself,

‘The Sword Gate must have many trump cards, but from the Cheng clan's perspective, entering the world might not be a good choice. With Senior Tiantou on the mountain, if they were to give up Shu, who could do anything to the Sword Gate? By refusing to let go, they only create more weaknesses…’

Houfu did not think much of this. The Sword Gate's troubles were far more complex than this. Another genius of the Sword Gate, Gu Pang, was in seclusion with Cheng Gao, but he had entered seclusion much earlier, so he was likely not affected by these things. But who knows if it would happen again? These were things he could not tell an outsider like Li Ximing. He could only sigh to himself and say with a mournful voice,

"There are even more troubles… The Great And Illustrious Peace Temple has been utterly defeated, and the North has shown no sign of reinforcements. The entire Western Heaven Plateau has been unified by the White Victory Dao, and even the Great Illumination Palace has fallen back into their hands."

"I heard from Daoist Master Hongyan that the White Victory Dao has re-established the Esoteric Sect. They worship the mountain gods and lake gods, raise the wind-horse prayer flags, five-colored prayer flags, and have re-established the Xiangxiong Kingdom."

Houfu's expression was complex.

"The Xiangxiong Kingdom was the kingdom of that personage. The meaning is very clear now."

Clearly, the personage he was referring to was Xiyan, a third of the Lesser Yang.

A True Monarch could be called by any name when they were nowhere to be found, but now that he had likely manifested, who would dare to call him a 'demon'? As a cultivator of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, Houfu could only refer to him as 'that personage'. It was likely that all those in the world who knew the truth now respectfully referred to him as 'True Monarch'.

‘The White Victory Dao is flourishing. Fuxun is probably worried, so this pill is even more urgent now…’

Li Ximing's thoughts passed quickly. Houfu said wistfully,

"Xiyan is his Dao name. That person's title is Western Eternal Loyalty White Victory Yan True Monarch. He is also the Western Lesser Yang and Right Lesser Yang in the Daoist images. Zhaojing, in the future, if you hear any news or see any related items, pay close attention."

This made Li Ximing's heart pound. After thanking him, he finally found an opportunity to speak in a soft voice.

"I have also come today for a matter…"

"Oh?"

Houfu took a sip of tea and asked with slight surprise. Li Ximing laughed and replied,

"A few days ago, I was entrusted by a friend to refine an extremely profound spiritual pill. The difficulty is the greatest I have ever faced. I am still a little worried. When I refined a pill for fellow Daoist Tinglan back then, I saw your esteemed tradition's treasure."

"The Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron?"

Houfu was enlightened. He smiled and said with a serious expression,

"Are you refining the pill here at Tiger's Frontier?"

Li Ximing had considered this long ago. According to his original judgment, Fuxun would never allow him to take these two extremely valuable spiritual artifacts away and into another Immortal Daoist tradition. He should have asked to borrow the Purple Mansion Spiritual Cauldron instead, but now with Liu Changdie, the trust between the two sides had greatly increased. It was no problem to bring the items here. He smiled and replied,

"Exactly."

"I see!"

Houfu was also wary of this. As long as the treasure didn't leave the mountain gate, he didn't have to worry about it. He could let Li Ximing use it. It was, after all, a favor. He smiled and said,

"What's difficult about that? The Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron is in Kuidu Palace. Whenever you decide you need to use it, just come to the mountain gate, give us a heads-up, and you can go right in!"

He said it very casually. Li Ximing's heart relaxed, knowing that the other party was being polite. He smiled and said,

"Thank you, Senior! According to the rules, you should receive a pill after this is done, but this pill is special and only one will be produced. So I will simply owe you a favor. Whenever you need a pill refined, you only need to ask me!"

After the Tangdao Mountain Range incident, the relationship between Hengzhu and the other Supreme Yang Daoist traditions had slightly eased. However, the Purple Mansion cultivators of the Hengzhu Dao had not yet shown themselves. How Hengxing would view this remained a problem. Houfu had naturally heard that Li Ximing's alchemy was extraordinary, and his heart moved. He agreed with a smile.

Li Ximing had a good impression of him. Since he agreed so readily, Li Ximing paused and still reminded him,

"Fei Qingya was taken back by Senior Kui Qi. How is she now? I saw she had a gentle and receptive personality, and she should be cultivated well."

Houfu smiled helplessly and replied,

"Thank you, Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing understood and lowered his head with a laugh. Houfu was not in a leisurely mood right now, so he soon left Tiger's Frontier and stepped into the Great Void. As he flew away, he took a quick look around.

Although there was still snow falling on the entire peak, it was no longer the neat and cultivated scene from his Foundation Establishment days. The tea bushes all over the mountain had not been pruned and had grown into a chaotic tangle.

‘With two Daoist Masters gone, the Great Xiukui Monastery has also become much more low-key…’

He flew all the way back, and not long after, he stepped out onto Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

The weather was getting cold, but Gardenia Scenery Mountain was as warm as spring. The gardenia flowers all over the mountain never wilted. The tables were clean, clearly having been recently tidied. Li Ximing landed silently and immediately sent someone to find Li Zhouwei.

He did not waste any time. He took out a jade slip from his sleeve.

*The Great Parting's White Brilliance*!

A rank six spell art was the highest-level technique a Purple Mansion cultivator could obtain! Even though Li Ximing had been in the Purple Mansion Realm for many years and the Li clan had two Purple Mansion cultivators, if he had to rely on his own collection, the only useful manual he had was the rank four *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light*.

He read it with a slight trepidation, pondering for a long time, and gradually came to understand its principles.

The first step of cultivating this art was to deduce, based on the incantations and secrets in the manual, the location of nine profound acupoints within the sea of qi. He had to constantly nurture them and find the one among them called the Radiant Gate casting acupoint, and place the Li Fire within it.

The so-called profound acupoints were not real acupoints but were rather notional positions created through calculation. This step required extremely high Dao-Profundity. An ordinary person, not to mention a Purple Mansion spiritual flame, would take years just to complete the first step of cultivation, and even more to nurture this profound acupoint so that it would slowly take form, eventually becoming nine real acupoints.

Of course, for a Purple Mansion cultivator's initiation, there was no nurturing. The Great Parting's White Brilliance simply said a few words, Divinely easy to calculate, once calculated it can be self-activated.

‘With a divine ability, what is there to fear? I'll just dig one out of my Dharma Body myself.’

It was even easier for Li Ximing. There was no need to calculate. He took the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame, circulated it through his sea of qi, and asked the little apricot-colored bird which spot was most comfortable. With a few quick deductions, he found a spot that matched the scriptures.

And so, with a thought, he immediately drew out the nine profound acupoints in his sea of qi. The Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame settled into Radiant Gate, and he felt his sea of qi tremble slightly. A divine ability roared forth, rushing in from the other eight acupoints and converging in the Radiant Gate, manifesting a streak of brilliant red.

This light was a single point of Red Radiance. It signified that he had officially begun cultivating this art. As his Dao-Profundity in the art deepened, the radiance would become more concentrated. Ten points could be refined into one sliver of Golden Radiance, which signified minor attainment. Ten slivers could then be refined into a streak of White Brilliance, signifying major attainment!

No matter what kind of light, it could be summoned from the sea of qi to injure enemies. Paired with Li Fire, it could summon all kinds of Great Parting's Radiance, which had a variety of magical effects. The more profound the Li Fire and the more skilled the fire control, the more powerful this light would be!

There was no need to refine it to a state of major attainment. As long as it reached a certain level, the Great Parting's Radiance could assist him in refining his dharma power, suppressing his sea of qi, and it could leave the sea of qi to travel through his four limbs and hundred bones, interfering with the divine abilities and dharma power that entered his Dharma Body, protecting his life-mandate!



# Chapter 932: The Halberd

Li Ximing's Dao-Profundity in the Li Fire was nothing remarkable, but his skill in controlling flame was no jest. Though he had only just begun his training, he closed his eyes and sensed the intricate details, swiftly grasping the mysteries of this spell art.

'This Great Parting's Radiance... it isn't an accumulation of dharma power or a divine ability. It's more like a faint reflection of the Li Fire within my Purple Mansion Realm. It’s like using a bronze mirror to catch the light of a flame; you can gather that glow. But no matter how ornate or vast the mirror becomes, or even if you craft many mirrors, the moment the flame itself dies, the light scatters. Everything turns to nothing.'

'Therefore, the true starting point for cultivating the Great Parting's Radiance is the Li Fire of the Purple Mansion Realm. It *must* be the Li Fire, and nothing else!'

'And because its origin is the flame itself, it doesn't matter how short my time cultivating this spell art has been or how weak the "mirror" is. As long as I have begun the cultivation, it will reflect at least a flicker of candlelight.'

Thus, the moment the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame settled into the Radiance Gate acupoint, his Sea of Qi produced the first spark of the Great Parting's Radiance without any need for prolonged cultivation. To be precise, it was the Great Parting's Red Radiance.

He opened his eyes, pleased. He brought two fingers together and twisted his wrist inward. A point of red light, no larger than his little finger, flickered to life at his fingertips. It was hazy, with a feeling of dense weight.

'The power is... acceptable.'

When this wisp of Great Parting's Red Radiance flew out, its power was actually less than his Radiant Celestial Wave Art. But Li Ximing hadn't forgotten how long he had trained the Radiant Celestial Wave Art, versus how long he had trained this new radiance. To have this much power immediately after reading the manual... even if it was borrowing the strength of his Li Fire, it proved how marvelous this spell art truly was.

He lost himself in the text, reading past the introductory sections and skimming all the way to the very end. After he finished the entire sixth-rank spell art, he finally understood the purpose of the nine Profound Acupoints.

The immortal cultivator who created the Great Parting's Red Radiance had originally used eight acupoints to absorb spiritual energy and the one "Radiance Gate" acupoint to erupt with light. But it seemed that after he had mastered the spell art and his divine ability and Dao-Profundity had reached an extremely high realm, he discovered the path continued further.

'After the Great Parting's White Brilliance is mastered, the eight acupoints lose their purpose of absorbing energy. Instead, one can continue to collect other Spiritual Fires. By using an extremely high Dao-Profundity, these Spiritual Fires can be simultaneously stored within the body, housed within those eight acupoints, allowing one to seek an even higher breakthrough.'

'At that point, one must collect five different Li Fires and four types of True Fire... Furthermore, among the five Li Fires, one *must* be the one called the Incinerating Li Fire of the Fold... How extravagant!'

Li Ximing had heard of the Incinerating Li Fire of the Fold. Huo Yang had mentioned it, and Li Ximing himself had heard the rumors. It was an extremely rare and powerful flame with a peculiar trait: if its owner perished, the fire would instantly shatter into eighty-one motes of Long-March Pheasant Flame.

Li Ximing sighed and opened his eyes. The sun was already dipping toward the west; clearly, several hours had passed.

The mountaintop, however, remained bright. A woman in red robes stood quietly to one side, waiting respectfully.

"Greetings, Daoist Master..."

The response from the lake had been swift. Li Minggong was already on the mountain. Seeing Li Ximing's contemplative expression, she immediately swallowed the words she had been about to speak.

Li Ximing pondered for another moment before giving a casual wave, gesturing for her to sit nearby. His spiritual sense stirred.

'Valley Wind Guide-Fire!'

The Juque Palace trembled instantly. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire erupted, surging up through his Dharma Body before coming to rest in his Sea of Qi.

'On this point... I don't need to rely on Dao-Profundity. Could there be any difficulty?'

Ordinarily, Li Ximing wouldn't have been able to do a thing. He couldn't even modify a fourth-rank Dharma Art if it was placed right in front of him, to say nothing of his meager Li Fire Dao-Profundity, which was barely enough to even attempt cultivating the Great Parting's White Brilliance.

But with Valley Wind Guide-Fire, his theoretical control over fire was terrifyingly precise. He forcibly bent the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire to his will, making it lower its head in grievance and squeeze itself into one of the Profound Acupoints.

The original spark of Great Parting's Red Radiance immediately extinguished. Li Ximing used his divine ability to calculate for a moment, his eyes gleaming. He dragged the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire back out and began testing the eight Profound Acupoints, one by one.

He wasn't adjusting the Profound Acupoints with his Dao-Profundity; he was forcing the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire to submit and *conform* to the acupoints. Soon, his eyes lit up, and he extended his hand once more.

"Hum..."

Two points of red radiance now hovered at his fingertips.

The second one, however, was faint and illusory, like a candle flickering in the wind, threatening to go out at any second.

"Haha."

Li Ximing chuckled and waved his hand, dismissing the Dharma Art. He understood.

By relying on Valley Wind Guide-Fire, he could temporarily create an *extra* wisp of Great Parting's Red Radiance. This second wisp wasn't a product of his own cultivation and couldn't be improved, but it was a temporary, additional source of power.

At first glance, this trick seemed useless. Unlike the main Radiance Gate acupoint, using the other eight required the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire to obediently retract inside his body and *stay* in the acupoint, unable to be used against an enemy. The power of a single wisp of Great Parting's Red Radiance was nothing compared to the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire itself. It seemed like a pointless trade.

'But that's just for *one* wisp of Great Parting's Red Radiance. What if I had nine? The leap from a single wisp of Red Radiance to a single wisp of Great Parting's Golden Radiance is a massive hurdle in this spell art, incredibly difficult to cross. But if I cultivate all nine wisps of red, I can temporarily retract my True Fire during a fight and unleash the golden light all the same.'

Satisfied, he dismissed the spell art and turned to Li Minggong with a smile.

"Well?"

He was, of course, asking for news about Dingyang Zi of Qize. He had already laid out his plans.

'Since I'm going to borrow his Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron anyway, why not kill two birds with one stone? I'll refine those pills for him. I'll gain my share of Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources, *and* I can use that high-grade cauldron to squeeze out an extra pill or two. It's the perfect opportunity to get all my own refining done as well!'

Besides, who is Dingyang Zi? When he left Gardenia Scenery Mountain that day, he'd said he still had a Spiritual Artifact refining in his cauldron. A full Spiritual Artifact, not just a spirit embryo! This man was a rare and skilled Artifact Refiner. He needed a favor from Li Ximing, but Li Ximing saw him as an equally valuable prize. That was why he had revealed his own skills early on, to build a good relationship.

Li Minggong understood his question and replied respectfully, "When this junior arrived at Qize, Daoist Master Dingyang Zi's 'Sun-Worshipping Mountain' daoist tradition treated me with utmost courtesy. I was granted a personal audience with the Purple Mansion Realm master himself. After hearing the Daoist Master's intentions, the Mountain Lord personally visited, bringing me straight to the lake. Unfortunately, the Daoist Master was not present, so he had to return with regret, but he left a message for me."

With a Spiritual Artifact in his cauldron, Dingyang Zi naturally couldn't be away for long. The fact that he came at all showed how important this was to him. She continued, "He is in absolute awe of the Daoist Master's alchemy skills. He is willing to continue refining the Upper Shaman spirit embryos for you. If the Daoist Master no longer requires them, he has a Spiritual Artifact refining matter he would like to entrust to you."

This was precisely what Li Ximing was most eager to hear. He nodded slightly, and Li Minggong continued.

"Unfortunately, he still has that Spiritual Artifact in refinement and his schedule is full. He also... considered whether our family has sufficient spiritual resources for a new refining project. He was very frank. He said that if the Daoist Master can refine those three cauldrons of pills for him, and if the yield is fifteen pills or more, he will personally design a Spiritual Artifact for our lake and provide the complete blueprints. The actual refining and expenses can be discussed afterward."

"He even said that if our family has other connections in artifact refining, we are free to take his blueprints to someone else. He guarantees the difficulty of refinement will be greatly reduced."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. "How confident!" he laughed.

Li Minggong lowered her head silently. Li Ximing continued, "There's no need for discussion. Go back and tell him we accept. Since we're asking him, why would we go find someone else? I'll not only refine the pills, but I'll also go to Tiger's Frontier and borrow their spiritual cauldron to do it, just to show how seriously I take this."

His laughter faded, and his expression turned serious.

"Before you leave for Qize, have Que'Wan look into the Wall-Sinking Water. We need to procure a large quantity. Let her determine how much we can acquire and handle the arrangements within the inner array."

Li Minggong quickly assented. Just then, a streak of Heavenly Light shot in from off the mountain. It materialized into a man with sharp eyebrows, golden eyes, and platinum armor. He clasped his hands in greeting.

"Seventh Uncle-Grandfather has returned."

"Ah."

Li Zhouwei took a seat, seemingly in good spirits. He smiled. "There was a disturbance in the Wilderness this morning, so I made a trip. I wasn't able to come see Uncle-Grandfather immediately... Please forgive me."

"Nonsense."

Li Ximing waved it off with a smile. The two men rose in tacit understanding and made their way toward Pingya Island. As they descended toward the inner array, Li Zhouwei recounted the situation with the Valiant King. Li Ximing's smile faded, replaced by a quiet sigh.

"That is... troublesome. On the other hand, I have some good news for you."

They sat, and Li Ximing poured tea. He then retrieved a jade box from his sleeve and handed it over. Li Zhouwei examined it and his eyes widened in surprise.

"Grotto Egret Origin Water!"

Li Ximing chuckled and recounted the events of his journey. Li Zhouwei was visibly shaken. After a long moment of contemplation, he said quietly, "Uncle-Grandfather, you are truly one whose life-mandate is bound to immortal destiny. You cannot be compared to ordinary men."

Li Ximing laughed and shook his head, dismissing the praise. "The 'immortal destiny' belongs to our ancestors. The 'life-mandate' was borrowed from you. The benefits I'm reaping now are just nourishment from the Supreme Yang's decline. What's there to brag about?"

Li Zhouwei sipped his tea. "I see no difference."

Li Ximing waved off the topic, so Li Zhouwei changed it. "Daoist Master Tinglan stopped by. She said Daoist Master Zhu Gong is very gravely injured and hopes you might pay a visit... to see if your pills can help."

Li Ximing shook his head. "Sumian would be better for this. They're grasping at straws coming to me. After I've handled my affairs, I'll pay a visit, just to show respect."

He turned back to the main topic. "Idle talk is useless. I've earned a favor from Dingyang Zi, an opportunity to have a Spiritual Artifact refined. Since you've moved the Grand Ascension to the Viewing Pavilion Platform, send the Yuan E to Qize. Have him take a look at it."

Li Zhouwei's eyebrows shot up, a flicker of pleasure in his eyes. Before he could refuse, Li Ximing pressed on. "Ancient items are rare, and ancient armor is even rarer. There's no need to covet them; we can refine our own. Furthermore, now that I have the Li Fire, this should go to you."

As he spoke, he reached out. The Heavenly Light between his brows flared, and a spiritual halberd flew forth. It was about three feet long, its double-bladed head curved like a crescent moon. It was the Radiant Sun King's Halberd!

The moment the Spiritual Artifact appeared, even as Li Ximing held it, it seemed to strain, eager to fly into Li Zhouwei's grasp. Li Ximing sighed.

"This item... is of most use in your hands."

This time, Li Zhouwei truly did not dare accept. He shot to his feet, his voice stern. "Elder, you worked for years and paid an immense price to obtain this treasure. How could I dare to seize it!"

"What I spent was the family's resources!"

Li Ximing shook his head and simply relaxed his grip. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd's Improper Bestowal ability activated instantly. The weapon transferred its allegiance on its own, flying directly into Li Zhouwei's hands.

"This!"

Li Ximing cut him off, feigning anger. "I am idle and roam freely outside. You are guarding the North Shore. If you don't have a powerful Spiritual Artifact to hold the line, a proper weapon in hand, how can that stand? They might not be able to do anything to you, but if you get tied down, the family members on the riverbank will be in grave danger."

He pressed the weapon on him, leaving no room for argument. Before another moment passed, a knock came from the hall door. It was Li Que'wan. Li Ximing immediately shifted the conversation, bidding her enter. "What is the situation with Jiangnan's Wall-Sinking Water?"

Li Zhouwei had never been a man of many words. Seeing the matter settled, he could only offer a deep bow of thanks before securing the King's Halberd to his waist.

Li Que'wan was now in charge of the family's spiritual resources, so she was the best person to ask. She bowed gracefully. "Daoist Master, if you require a large amount, we cannot let others know, or they will raise the price on us. This matter must be handled by our own people, purchasing small amounts from various marketplaces. Unfortunately, Water Mansion resources are not abundant to begin with, and Wall-Sinking Water is mostly used for artifact refining. This junior estimates... we can only acquire a few dozen portions immediately. Over a year... we should be able to get at least ten or twenty small jars, but it will put a strain on the family."

Li Ximing made a quick calculation. A year would be more than enough. He relaxed. Li Zhouwei knew he was planning for the Neck Feathers and added, "The Method of Transformation... you'll need to use your immortal foundation to examine it and test it."

"This junior understands."

Li Que'wan understood they were making long-term plans and quickly took her leave. Li Ximing hesitated for a moment before speaking in a low voice. "I want to establish a department in the Deer Weeds island region. It suddenly made me think of Liu Changdie... He said his divine ability could nurture Golden Essence and resources. If he truly has the heart for it now, we could ask him to look at the Feather Transformation Pool in the cave and see if he has any ideas."

Liu Changdie had a long-standing friendship with their family and was trustworthy. Unfortunately, he also carried a great deal of trouble, and Li Ximing worried about attracting unwanted attention. He looked conflicted. Deciding to table that thought, he first asked about the Water Mansion Dao, turning back to Li Zhouwei.

"Is the Luminous Heart Origin Qi available?"

Li Ximing had other plans for this trip back, one of which was to retrieve the clan's Luminous Heart Origin Qi.

Despite his constant travels, he had not neglected his cultivation. He used short breaks to study spell arts and longer ones to practice Qi Refining. He had already completed the six cycles with ease and was now preparing to use the Luminous Heart Origin Qi to cultivate his second divine ability.

'In recent years, there was endless trouble and constant fighting. But now, Jiangbei is stable. With Minghuang standing guard on the shore, it seems there won't be any major conflicts. I can finally cultivate in peace.'

He took the item from Li Zhouwei and tucked it into his sleeve, sighing with emotion. "I truly envy the Purple Smoke Gate's Traversal Token. These days, I wish I could be in multiple places at once, or even better, cultivate and practice spell arts at the same time."

But a sigh was just a sigh. He didn't delay. After finalizing plans with Li Zhouwei, he departed on a beam of light.

Li Zhouwei saw him out of the hall and then returned, alone.

Ever since returning from Mount Dali, his heart had not known a moment of peace. Li Ximing's words echoed in his mind.

*'He gave me the King's Halberd to protect the family members on the riverbank.'*

'Protection for a time... but what if I fail to satisfy Luoxia and am forced into reincarnation? What fate will await our family members then?'

The inner array was always dim, and now it was utterly silent. The vast hall echoed with the sound of his solitary footsteps. He walked to the highest point and sat upon the main seat. He untied the three-foot-long King's Halberd from his waist and held it, studying it intently.

The King's Halberd. A symbol of Bright Yang's authority.

The face of the halberd blade was a deep, heavy bronze, yet it shimmered with a silver light. The pattern of a qilin beast undulated across its surface, its head facing downward in a condescending gaze. At the top, signifying the front and legitimacy, was the sigil of High Radiance.

He turned the halberd over. On the reverse side, beneath the sigil of the Yang Cusp, was the same qilin beast. This time, however, its head was tilted upward, its ambitious eyes staring directly at him.

*Clack...*

The sharp, powerful sound of hurried footsteps echoed from outside the hall. His second son stopped at the entrance and announced respectfully, "Father, Daoist Master Tianhuo of the Golden Feather Sect has arrived."

The golden-eyed man did not respond. He remained on his high seat, silently staring at the sigil on the halberd's blade.

The announcement echoed and faded into the cavernous hall. At last, the man they called the White Qilin, the prodigy of the Li Clan, moved. His fingers and wrist tensed, and the King's Halberd in his hand began to tilt, its cutting edge drawing ever closer to his face.

As he turned the weapon, the angle of the light caused the qilin beast engravings to sink into shadow, while the Yang Cusp sigil at the top blazed brighter. The long, sharp edge caught the light, reflecting his cold, golden eyes.

"See him onto the island."



# Chapter 933: The Pawn

Purple-gold light swirled through the rising mists. A light breeze whispered through the high pavilion where a man in gold-flame robes stood, his hands resting on the railing. His magnificent robes fluttered as he gazed calmly at the towering, purple-gold pillars veiled in the ethereal clouds.

'The scenery on this island isn't bad... but the formation is mediocre. It's laid out according to the traditions of the Supreme Yang Dao. There are a few novel touches, but on the whole, it's far too rigid.'

The Daoist Master's gaze swept over the island, and a curious look entered his eyes.

'This tiny Moongaze Lake... it actually supports so many low-level cultivators. Its resources must be abundant. But unlike the Wei-Li immortal officials, who integrate with the populace, these cultivators are split up and managed by various immortal mountains. Even if the low-level cultivators are productive and don't require a huge investment... what's the point of raising them?'

'Even if the Buddhist cultivators invade from the south and bodies are needed to hold the line, only the lives of those in the Foundation Establishment Realm truly count. Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining cultivators... they're just useless fodder.'

The Daoist Master waited for a while. The man behind him remained perfectly still, head bowed. When a figure materialized nearby, the Daoist Master turned with a smile. Upon seeing it was Li Zhouwei, he felt a flash of disappointment, though his expression didn't change. He bowed.

"Daoist Friend Minghuang, I have long heard of your reputation!"

"Greetings, Senior Tianhuo."

Li Zhouwei replied, observing the Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect. He was strikingly handsome and carried himself with an elegant air, yet his casual, almost flippant demeanor matched the rumors perfectly.

'I've heard this Daoist Master Tianhuo was the late-born son of a great figure in the Golden Feather Sect and was thoroughly spoiled. He's known to be playful and informal... and even had a reputation as a wastrel in his youth.'

The youth following him was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator of the Jing Dragon King lineage. He appeared completely docile. This must be Su Yan. Capital immortals Dao had claimed his demonic arts were terrifying and that he was wild and untamable, but right now, there wasn't a trace of arrogance about him. He looked like any other well-behaved junior.

The fact that Tianhuo had reached the Purple Mansion Realm naturally disproved the worst of the rumors, but his troublesome personality seemed to be just as reported. He smiled as Li Zhouwei approached.

"When I came here years ago, I met Chen Taoping in the marketplace. He was just looking for a cultivation art to break through. He even asked if Golden Feather wanted Moongaze Lake. In his hands, this island was a wreck, so I refused. I never expected to see it again, shrouded in purple-gold light, with clouds wreathing a resting qilin. It is truly a blessed land. It just shows your esteemed clan's profound foundation."

"It is nothing, far inferior to Golden Feather."

Li Zhouwei gave a polite, formulaic reply and invited him to sit. Tianhuo smiled and entered, his gaze sweeping imperceptibly over the Spiritual Artifact at Li Zhouwei's waist. He noted the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, and his eyes shifted away, his smile never faltering.

Once tea was served, Tianhuo smiled. "I just came from the sect. I was originally coming to find *the* Daoist Master, as Zhaojing and I had some old arrangements... but I heard some news on the way."

"I am listening."

Li Zhouwei replied. Tianhuo said, "I hear the north has newly established the Huai River Dao. The Profound Governance Pavilion has been ordered to promote a dao lineage to serve as the Huai River Dao's orthodox governance. Daoist Friend Yehui has the highest cultivation, so he rushed to the capital overnight... There's still no word!"

Tianhuo's smile was unreadable. "His Capital Guard dao is at odds with the Buddhist cultivators, and he's standing in this position. It's no wonder he's in a hurry to see Wei Xuanyin. And Wei Xuanyin needs people in Jiangbei, so it's normal for them to hit it off."

Yehui had already come to discuss this. The man was only standing in the eye of the storm to seek his own Dao; he had no firm loyalties. Li Zhouwei wasn't surprised. He only asked, "Since Senior has news from the north, do you know what has become of the Valiant King?"

Daoist Master Tianhuo lowered his head to sip his tea. "No news on that. I only heard the capital plans to invite him back. As for whether they'll send someone from the Gao down... it's hard to say."

Currently, two figures were in charge of the lands north of the river: Fachang, the Buddhist cultivator from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, and the Valiant King. One was at odds with his superiors, and the other had no desire to stir up trouble. As a result, both sides remained quiet, which was a clear sign that the northern powers had no intention of crossing the river.

But if the Valiant King left, the peace on the riverbank would likely be shattered.

Seeing Li Zhouwei pause, Tianhuo smiled. "However, I *do* have a piece of good news for you."

He retrieved a jade box from his sleeve, set it on the table, and said in a more serious tone, "The Great River and Grand Mound Scripture has been unlocked. I am here to fulfill our promise to your clan."

Tianhuo had taken Su Yan back to his sect and borrowed the scripture precisely to use him to unlock the lineage. Now, he had finally succeeded. Tianhuo picked up the jade box, opened the lid, and took out a pure white jade slip. He smiled.

"Please."

"As expected of the descendants of the Golden Feather True Monarch. Your Immortal Dao inheritance is profound, to have unlocked this scripture... My family must thank you, Daoist Master."

Though Li Zhouwei's words were polite, he didn't immediately accept the slip. He studied it closely and smiled. "Daoist Master, you said that day that you were borrowing the jade slip and would return it after it was unlocked. But this one... appears to be a copy. What of the original Great River and Grand Mound Scripture?"

The only reason the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture had fallen into the Li family's hands was that the Golden Feather Sect had used their ancestor, Li Tongya, as a pawn, much like they were now using Su Yan. They had even taken a Spiritual Artifact from him, leaving behind the conspicuous Duruo Spear to draw the Miao Family's ire.

Back then, Li Tongya was just a minor cultivator and in no position to demand fairness. Since it hadn't led to disaster, the family hadn't pressed the issue. But the Golden Feather Sect had miscalculated, and the scripture now belonged to the Li Clan. It was clearly no simple item, and Li Zhouwei would not let it be taken from him so ambiguously.

As expected, Tianhuo looked slightly embarrassed. "Ah... once the jade slip was unlocked, it immediately transformed into a mote of Pit Water light and merged into Su Yan's Shengyang Acupoint. Su Yan is now an inner disciple of my Golden Feather Sect, and a talented alchemist. We can't very well... dismantle his Shengyang Acupoint."

He motioned, and Su Yan immediately stepped forward to bow. A golden glint flashed in Li Zhouwei's eyes. He could indeed see a speck of Pit Water light within the man's Shengyang Acupoint. It appeared to be some kind of inheritance, or perhaps a symbol of status.

'So the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture really did contain the inheritance of the ancient Chen Clan's immortal sect... Perhaps it's even the token of the Sect Master.'

This wasn't surprising. Otherwise, Chen Taoping wouldn't have spent his entire life searching for it, nor would the Golden Feather Sect have obsessed over it for four hundred years. Both men understood this perfectly without needing to say a word.

If the Li family cultivated the Pit Water Dao, this would be a painful loss. Fortunately, ever since they learned that Xiao Chuting was aiming to master the Pit Water Dao, the Li family's core lineage had steered clear of it.

It wasn't just the Li family. While common Pit Water cultivation arts were everywhere, profound lineages were rare. Cangzhou was far away in the Northern Sea, and the path was blocked by the terrifying Xiao Chuting. No one with any sense in Jiangnan dared to walk that path. But that didn't mean Li Zhouwei couldn't use this as leverage. He simply smiled.

"It seems the Daoist Master *does* have good news for me, then."

His accommodating attitude made Tianhuo visibly relax. "Thank you for your understanding, Daoist Master! I am indeed here to make amends."

Tianhuo continued, "That mote of Pit Water light settled, but it didn't do anything strange. I asked the elders in my sect, and they said it's related to the Great Ning Palace... Hah! What dynasty is that from? If Anhuai Heaven hadn't appeared, our two families could have used this to cooperate. But Anhuai Heaven has already come and gone, and the Great Ning Palace was destroyed long ago. What use is it now!"

Li Zhouwei considered this, then asked, "I heard the spiritual ingredient for the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill comes from a spiritual flower, described as: 'Yearly it blooms and withers, its fallen petals become armored insects'... It was originally obtained from the Eastern Fire. My family is interested in trading for it."

A treasure that "yearly blooms and withers" would produce at least one portion of a precious spiritual ingredient every year, making its value incomparable. He set a high bar by asking to trade. Tianhuo shook his head with a smile.

"Although Golden Feather obtained that flower, it is outside my cousin Qiushui's cave-dwelling. It belongs to her. Taking a few ingredients normally is fine, but she is currently undergoing Mercury Transformation to preserve her nature and cannot be disturbed. Even if I could, I couldn't bring myself to ask her. However, I *did* bring the Radiant Qilin Refining Art for the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill. It is my gift to you today."

Li Zhouwei had expected he might offer the art. He frowned slightly. "Senior, please explain."

Tianhuo's expression became serious. "This art has a long history. It was originally consumed in the Wei Imperial court and official residences, and it was protected by many secret arts. Several lineages have tried to unlock it, but failed. My Golden Feather Sect, however, has some ancestral inheritance that allowed us to open it."

"But after the fall of the Wei, the nature of Bright Yang itself changed, and the art became unusable. This copy, however, was modified by a Daoist Master of the Cui Clan, making it viable once more!"

"So it is a unique copy."

Li Zhouwei said quietly, "But without that spiritual ingredient, the pill art is useless to my family."

Tianhuo laughed. "As I said, the ingredients produced are all stored at Golden Feather. You need only come and trade for them."

He then reached into the jade box and withdrew a golden scroll, his expression solemn.

"Since we took an ancient art from your esteemed clan, we shall return an ancient art. This is the *original* text of the Radiant Qilin Refining Art from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. It is called the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll!"

The scroll was adorned with patterns at its four corners and felt as soft and fine as woven gold. His gesture was so considerate, and his excuse so plausible, that Li Zhouwei could hardly refuse. He accepted it with thanks, placed it back in the jade box, and said, "My thanks, Senior."

Tianhuo smiled. "I won't impose any longer. We are expecting important guests at the sect to discuss several urgent matters. I must return to greet them. It wouldn't be right to stay here."

Li Zhouwei's expression remained neutral. He raised his head slightly, his left hand gently closing the lid of the jade box. He left it on the table and asked, "It seems the trouble is in Jiangbei."

Tianhuo's smile held steady. "I think it's more than just Jiangbei."

Li Zhouwei's expression remained unchanged.

'What kind of guests would require multiple Golden Feather Purple Mansion masters to welcome them? What would require Tianhuo to rush back from his travels to be there on time?'

Li Zhouwei's breakthrough had been sudden. The lake had been peaceful since, and the north had shown no reaction. But this visit from Daoist Master Tianhuo had revealed the slightest hint of a gathering storm.

'It's not just Jiangbei. It's Jiangnan, too.'

He escorted Tianhuo off the lake. The Golden Feather Daoist Master's smile finally faded, and he grew silent. Just as he was about to depart, he spoke suddenly.

"Minghuang broke through in the Eastern Sea, yet you were willing to return... I presume you have no plans to leave again."

Li Zhouwei met his gaze evenly and smiled. "I only returned just in time to save our family members from Helian Wumeng."

Tianhuo gave him one last, deep look, then scattered like smoke and vanished.

...

Poluoduo.

When Li Ximing arrived on the wind, the Xipo Kingdom was still a vibrant, peaceful, and auspicious place. He had only just landed in the pavilion when the Demon King leaped up to greet him, overjoyed.

"Daoist Friend, you're here so quickly! Daoist Friend Qingyan hasn't returned yet!"

Even with Liu Changdie's guarantee, the fact that Li Ximing had already taken the Li Fire was a source of anxiety. Now, Fuxun rushed over, wreathed in joyous relief. Li Ximing kept it brief, stating he was there for the spiritual items as arranged.

"When will this other Daoist Friend be back?"

"I've already asked... He's in the Fenkuai region, searching for a spiritual item on an island. He's... well, he gets along well with humans and has a bit of a reputation. He can assist you. My own status is... sensitive. It wouldn't be good for me to enter Tiger's Frontier."

Fuxun looked awkward and glanced at Liu Changdie, clearly hoping he would offer to go to Tiger's Frontier as well. Liu Changdie, however, was perfectly relaxed. "Then let's set off," he smiled. "There's been a lot of trouble lately, and I need to go to Fenkuai anyway. That Vermilion Bird is stirring up trouble again. Since you've made a promise to Huo Yang, Daoist Friend Fuxun, you shouldn't leave the Xipo Kingdom. We two will go, make good time, and wait for Daoist Friend Qingyan in Fenkuai."

Fuxun had no choice but to retrieve the two spiritual items. He placed them in two glittering golden caskets, which he handed to Li Ximing along with a communication talisman. He also produced a storage bag, clearly filled with supplementary ingredients, and gave it all over, looking thoroughly dejected.

Li Ximing stifled a laugh and reached out to take them, but his arm immediately tensed with effort. He was surprised.

"Oh?"

Of the two golden caskets, one was as light as air, but the other was as heavy as a mountain. He had to channel his dharma power and divine ability, his fingers gripping tightly, just to lift the caskets with feigned ease and store them in his sleeve.

"We are relying on you, Daoist Friend!"

The two bid farewell to the Demon King and departed the Xipo Kingdom, riding the winds through the Great Void. Liu Changdie's mood had long since stabilized, and he began to ask curiously about Li Ximing's descendants.

Li Ximing, however, took the opportunity to smile and ask, "Senior, I heard you say before that your divine ability can nurture spiritual resources... I was wondering, does the 'Water Mansion' Dao conflict with your arts?"

Liu Changdie nodded. "Before the Harmonising-Vault Union, Vault Metal is a receptive metal. Aside from a few Water and Fire virtues it clashes with, it is compatible with most. As for various waters, besides Yin-Conjunction Clear Water, most waters benefit greatly from 'Vault Metal'."

"After the Harmonising-Vault Union, many of these traits become less distinct. The clashes aren't as violent, but the beneficial synergies aren't as strong, either... Still, it has its own unique marvels."

Li Ximing calculated that Water Mansion would also benefit, which set his mind at ease. Liu Changdie chuckled. "Is there some treasure you'd like me to see?"

Li Ximing smiled but said nothing. Liu Changdie understood that without a privacy formation, it was not the place to talk. The two continued their journey, parting ways at Linhai. Li Ximing sped directly to Tiger's Frontier. When he landed and inquired, he found that Houfu was indeed absent, but had left instructions: if Li Ximing arrived, he was to be given direct access to Kuidu Palace for his alchemy.

Kuidu Palace was located behind the main summit hall. It was not a tall structure, just a small, three-story pavilion. A Xiukui disciple led him inside, where a five-legged spiritual cauldron sat squarely in the center of the main hall.

Faint purple light pulsed from beneath it, suggesting it was currently nurturing a Spiritual Artifact. The Xiukui disciple bowed, withdrew, and sealed the hall doors. Li Ximing then turned his hand, retrieving a jade box from his storage bag.

Inside, three pitch-black scales shimmered faintly, emanating a dense, misty aura of Pit Water. It was the Cangzhou Serpent Scale.

'First, I'll fire up the cauldron and settle Dingyang Zi's fifteen pills. It will serve to warm up the cauldron and hopefully bring good fortune. After that, I'll wait for the others to arrive, and then I'll begin refining the great pill!'



# Chapter 934: An Audience with Suiguan

Azure Pond Peak.

The night was deep, shrouded in a gathering of clouds and mist. A cold wind rustled through the air, making the green shadows of the pines and cypresses dance upon the stone steps. A man in ochre robes moved swiftly up the path, all the way to the summit where an immortal fairy in white stood, a sword cradled in her arms.

"Greetings, Master!"

Though the man’s cultivation was high, his foundation seemed somewhat unstable, as if he had only recently broken through. He gathered his robes and bowed. Ning Wan turned her face slightly, her voice low.

"Wuning, you've come."

This man was none other than Lin Wuning, who now held a high and ascendant position within the Azure Pond Sect.

Lin Wuning's origins were distinguished—both his parents were Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and he was the son of a peak lord—but in the Azure Pond of years past, this was hardly the top echelon. His parents had been rogue cultivators, not even ranking in the top ten below the four great families. He himself was not considered a remarkable talent and had merely practiced on Moonview Peak.

But who could have predicted the storms that would fell the forest? In the span of a few years, waves of Azure Pond Sect cultivators had perished. One after another, they fell, and the great families either died out or went into seclusion. Lin Wuning, riding on the coattails of Ning Wan's rise and possessing a clean background, found that it was his turn—a man of middling status—to preside over a grand immortal sect.

Lin Wuning bowed again before rising to stand by her side. Ning Wan’s gaze was fixed on the shifting sea of clouds below, dyed by the night and transformed by the wind. A fierce gale swept toward them, yet it could do no more than gently stir the strands of her hair.

She remembered the night Chi Wei had broken through. It had begun at dusk and ended at dawn, a night of similarly cold, clear moonlight. The only difference was that Chi Zhiyun had been the one standing beside him.

She waited a long while before finally asking, "Is there any news?"

Lin Wuning replied in a low voice, "We've investigated thoroughly. The man is called Yang Zhuo, a figure who appeared out of nowhere. He has always operated as a vigilante in the Simin region and is said to be extremely powerful. This time, he couldn't stand seeing the formation's guardians bullying the common people, so he killed the man and left."

Ning Wan was silent for a long time. "Another one named Yang," she finally said.

She slapped the Spiritual Swords in her hand, a hint of irritation in the gesture, then asked, "What lineage of Dao does he cultivate?"

Lin Wuning bowed his head slightly. "It is suspected to be one of the twelve Qis—a lineage like Purple Qi, True Qi, or Pure Qi."

Ning Wan let out a breath. "The matter with the Purple Smoke Gate in the Eastern Sea... things have changed again. The earth veins have trembled for the second time. The Changxiao Gate has sealed its mountain, yet there has been no word from the Hengzhu Immortal Dao. Something is definitely amiss... Send someone to Purple Smoke Gate and inquire about providing assistance."

"Yes..."

Lin Wuning looked up again, his voice soft. "A message has arrived from Crimson Reef Island. They hope Master can make a trip... Daoist Master Tianwan... wishes to have a word with you."

Tianwan's divine ability was not insignificant; she was a Great Daoist Master of the Cold Qi lineage and also Ning Wan's senior. For her to make such a request showed great respect. Yet the Qiuhu fairy appeared troubled, her voice tinged with reluctance.

"Just reply to her that I was injured in the north and have not yet recovered. Tell her that once I am healed, I will personally visit the island to pay my respects."

The Ning family held no great grudge against Crimson Reef Island. In fact, the only faction in the Azure Pond with a blood feud against them, Yuanwu Peak, was now a mere shadow of its former self, lacking not only a Purple Mansion Realm expert but even having its Dao lineage severed. Still, unsolicited kindness was either a trap or a ploy. Ning Wan’s guard was raised.

‘It’s either about Li Quantao’s affair, or it’s another scheme to force open the Snow Wings Mountain Gate. Either way, it’s trouble... In these turbulent times, it’s best to delay for as long as possible.’

She fell silent for a long moment. A figure ascended from the base of the mountain, clad in a black robe and holding a jade box with both hands. He approached her with an ethereal grace, knelt on the ground, and said respectfully,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, the item has been retrieved."

As he looked up, the cold moonlight illuminated the sharp, fierce lines of his eyes, tinged with a hint of gloom. It was Li Yuanqin, who had vanished from the public eye for a long time. He now held the jade box aloft with both hands.

"Following the clues and searching for persons of interest, I traced the trail to the last Chi Family Head, Chi Xunxiao," he reported respectfully. "By finding a letter left by one of his trusted confidants from that time, I was finally able to recover the item."

"Based on the clues I've gathered and the fragments of information from the letter, I have gradually come to understand the matter..."

Ning Wan trusted Li Yuanqin's methods and nodded for him to continue.

"This person was known for his intelligence from a young age. Back then, the Azure Pond was in turmoil, and everyone was awaiting Si Yuanli's return. Yet he quietly infiltrated the main hall. Using a secret seal from his father, Chi Zhiyan, and a hidden passage beneath the hall, he was the first to enter the secret chamber."

"It was he who took the Clarity Moon-Viewing Incantation, the Supreme Yin Breathing and Qi Refining Art, and the Glazed Heart-Mind Sutra... After leaving the chamber, he descended the mountain, sealed the items in a hidden jade box, and buried it right there in the mountainside before returning to his own courtyard."

At this, Lin Wuning silently closed his eyes. The face of that young sect master from years ago appeared in his mind, and he lowered his head further, saying nothing.

Ning Wan's expression was somber. "I know of him. It seems Chi Zhiyan must have secretly told him about it. But for a child to be so decisive... truly extraordinary!"

Li Yuanqin spoke softly, "He made his arrangements early on. Unfortunately, he was constantly monitored afterward and never dared to touch the box. Chi Fubo never imagined a mere child could pull off such a feat. He simply assumed the items in the secret chamber weren't valuable enough and that Chi Zhiyun must have hidden the real treasures elsewhere, so he never suspected the boy..."

He paused here, a note of incredulity in his voice. "It is said that while he feared his uncle would usurp his position, he was even more terrified that the jade box would be lost. Fearing that handing it over would mean his own death, he secretly instructed a loyal agent left by his father: if the day came that his uncle killed him, the agent was to dig up the box and present it to his uncle, ensuring the legacy remained in Chi family hands."

"Oh?"

Ning Wan frowned. Li Yuanqin continued, "Later, during the upheaval at Crimson Reef Island, when the news reached the sect, the main hall was surrounded, the peaks were sealed, and all flight and techniques were forbidden. Qin Xian, holding a long halberd, hesitated three times before entering the hall. Seeing him, the boy shouted, 'Is it you, uncle, who has come to harm me?' His cry made the doors and windows rattle and extinguished all the candles. Qin Xian pierced his chest with the halberd, killing him on the spot."

The Si family would certainly have involved the Ning family in such an act. Lin Wuning had been present at the time and knew this clearly. He couldn't help but shut his eyes again.

Li Yuanqin went on, "Thinking back now, he must have truly believed Chi Fubo was there to kill him, and his shout was a secret signal to his confidant... But perhaps that one sentence left the agent bewildered. In the end, the box was passed to the remaining Chi family members. Only after all these years did a clue finally surface, allowing us to obtain it."

Ning Wan stared quietly at the jade box before her, a trace of confusion in her eyes.

"He was just a twelve-year-old child at the time... With such a mind, and at the second level of Qi Refining... If the Chi clan had not been extinguished with these two generations, their brilliance today would likely be unprecedented."

She seemed to want to say more, but her beautiful eyes filled with a new unease and regret. She recalled the time Ning Heyuan had arrogantly challenged Li Qinghong at the Li estate, and how she had reprimanded him. She never expected that Ning Heyuan would fall, and that everything would unfold in a manner far more tragic than she had imagined.

Her expression grew distant as she thought back on the events of the past few years, sighing with lament.

"Countless are the geniuses under heaven, yet their rise is so often followed by their fall!"

Neither man spoke. Lin Wuning, having received his orders, quickly departed. Ning Wan took the jade box and examined it closely. Inside lay three small, light-green jade slips, none bigger than a fist, and a piece of white jade two fingers wide. With a sweep of her spiritual sense, she immediately immersed herself in them.

‘The Clarity Moon-Viewing Incantation and the Glazed Heart-Mind Sutra...’

These were both top-tier techniques, but they were regrettably restricted; only those of the Dao of the Three Yins could cultivate them. Not to mention the vast quantities of rare treasures and the exceptional talent required. Ning Wan sighed with regret but put them away with pleasure. Finally, her gaze fell upon the jade stone.

‘The legendary Supreme Yin Breathing and Qi Refining Art.’

The name was not unfamiliar to her. Daoist Master Yuansu had known a great deal and had passed much of it down. This art was said to be the ultimate Qi Refining method for the Supreme Yin lineage. Cultivating it all the way to Foundation Establishment would result in the 'Form and Shadow' attainment.

‘Legend has it that this art is even more profound than the 'Form in Transition' of Cultivation Transcendence. Once the divine ability is achieved, the main body can remain in seclusion within its cave mansion while instantly forming a Divided Aspect Body to walk the world. Unlike the illusory body of 'Form in Transition', which has a fixed cultivation level and independent spiritual sense, Li Jiangqun's Divided Aspect Body was a Moon-Glaze body that cultivated from the very beginning... Though there are limitations on its spiritual sense and cultivation speed, it is exceptionally formidable!’

Ning Wan gazed at the Supreme Yin Breathing and Qi Refining Art in her hand with boundless envy, sighing inwardly.

"What a pity that no one can use this. Not only is it impossible for anyone less than a master of great divine abilities to read or copy it, but even obtaining it doesn't mean one can cultivate it. It is said to require a foundation of the Six Wheels of the Supreme Yin, which can only be achieved by consuming both Supreme Yin Moon Radiance and the Clear Yin Womb Herb while practicing a special technique... Who knows what kind of immense fortune one would need to succeed..."

Ning Wan stood in the wind for a while longer, completely at a loss as to what to do with the jade stone. She placed it back in the box and finally turned her slightly puzzled gaze to the last jade slip.

‘Art of Awakening Glaze.’

She slowly closed her eyes and read it carefully. Then, with a turn of her hand, she made her way into her cave mansion. The aura of Pristine Water washed over her, but she bypassed this area, heading deeper into the cavern, following the direction faced by the main seat at the highest point of the Azure Pond. In a corner, she found a deep pond.

Though it was a deep pond, the water was exceptionally clear. It was situated directly beneath a stone wall. From this spot, looking back, one could see the Pristine Merging Owl Pool, the six azure jade thrones upon its bank, and their six reflections in the water. The tall main throne, in particular, seemed to look down directly upon this deep pool.

Ning Wan stared intently for a moment, then gently formed a hand seal.

Patterns on the stone wall of the cave immediately lit up, like silver-white vines growing upon the stone. They spread out, casting a cascade of silver light that made the clear pond shine even brighter.

After about fifteen minutes, a reflection slowly emerged from the once-dark water. It was a brilliant silver-white tree with delicate branches and leaves that spread continuously. The clear, gentle moonlight it emitted shone upon the woman’s face.

Hanging from the silvery branches was a lustrous white pearl of light, like a tiny moon.

Ning Wan extended a slender hand, palm up, as if holding something, though she made no visible movement. The reflection in the pool gradually dimmed. A speck of silver light materialized from thin air and suddenly landed in her hand, held aloft and hovering by her Cold Qi divine ability.

‘The Moon-Glazing Glass Tree! The Purple Mansion Realm spiritual root has borne fruit!’

Her expression was complicated as she stared at the fruit in her palm—an object so priceless that even Purple Mansion Realm experts would fight for it. For a moment, she was at a loss for words.

From her perspective, a fruit like this would be of immense help in perfecting her current divine ability. Even if she saved it, it could provide crucial assistance when she was ready to conceive her next divine ability. The Chi family’s frequent emergence of Purple Mansion Realm experts and their ease in attaining divine abilities over the years was not without reason! The Moon-Glazing Glass Tree was one of them! Chi Zhiyun, who had entered seclusion to break through back then, had also consumed this fruit. If not for the two youths who had forced open his doors and killed him, he would likely have been on the verge of attaining a new divine ability.

The Azure Pond’s reputation as a demonic sect wasn't built in a day. At least since Chi Rui's generation, their methods had been far from righteous. The Three Yuans were all ruthless, and in their early years, they were known for their tyrannical acts. Taught by their example, Ning Wan was no stickler for rules, and her own methods were not necessarily gentle. She would not hesitate to use something if it benefited her.

But the Moon-Glazing Glass Tree was said to have been grown from the flesh and blood of Li Jiangqun's dharma body. Li Jiangqun was a sworn friend of her own predecessor, Daoist Master Yuansu, and Yuansu had stood firmly on Li Jiangqun's side back then.

As Yuansu's sole successor, Ning Wan knew even more.

‘I heard from the clan elders that in his youth, the Master’s actions were even more extreme than those of Yuanwu or Yuanxiu. Yuanxiu was actually the most righteous of the three. It was only after spending a long time with Li Jiangqun that his temperament and conduct gradually improved...’

Faced with such a spiritual treasure, how could Ning Wan accept it so easily? She could only take out the jade box from her sleeve, carefully store the fruit inside, and sigh inwardly. She turned her head, her gaze lowered.

But it was that turn, that lowering of her eyes, that sent a chill rushing up from her heart to her brows, nearly making her leap up in shock.

From this position, looking back, one could see the highest, most imposing main throne.

And on that throne, which had always been empty, always cold, a man in green robes was now sitting.

The man was lounging against the seat, his slender frame giving him an air of laziness. His face had a demonic handsomeness to it, especially the long, narrow corners of his eyes, reminiscent of a snake or a flood dragon. His long, bluish-black hair was held in place by a hairpin that resembled green jade, revealing the elegant and smooth line of his profile.

He wore the green robes of an Azure Pond Sect Purple Mansion Realm expert, and the golden tassel symbolizing his status hung from his waist, swaying in the breeze. An amused expression played on his face as he smiled, his lips pursed. His pupils were a mesmerizing shade of bluish-purple, and his gaze was casually fixed on the lingering silver light on the wall directly below him.

‘When did he get in?! How long has he been here! Why did I not sense him at all! My spiritual sense swept this area—why was there nothing!’

Ning Wan's mind went blank for a second. Then, a name slowly, painstakingly surfaced.

Suiguan

It felt like an instant, and yet it felt like an eternity. With lips drained of all color, Ning Wan finally managed to speak, her voice trembling, pale, and powerless with terror.

"Greetings, Senior Suiguan."

Having said this, she finally lowered her head and bowed deeply. Her eyes downcast, her gaze fell lightly upon the Pristine Merging Owl Pool before her. The surface of the green pool remained placid, reflecting the Pristine Water patterns glowing with an azure-crow hue on the immortal throne above—which was completely empty.

‘The Pristine Merging Owl Pool cannot reflect him.’

Her voice was like a kite with a broken string, swaying powerlessly in the air. The man on the throne above continued to stare at the wall. After a few beats of silence, he casually shifted his gaze to her, his voice condescending.

"Oh? So Si Boxiu is dead too."

# Chapter 935: The Dawn Guest

His voice, ethereal and deep, echoed across the Pristine Merging Owl Pool. The surging aura of Pristine Water rose and fell with his tone, transforming in the air into streaks of shuttling Azure Crow Qi.

‘How... how has he returned! Is the Outer World conflict over?!’

Ning Wan kept her head bowed, her mind still reeling, utterly blank. She was silent, at a loss as to how to face the terrifying figure before her. The air was frighteningly quiet.

*Pat.*

At this critical moment, the sound of footsteps gradually approached from outside the cave mansion. The two cultivators guarding the entrance readily parted way. The footsteps grew more urgent, and Lin Wuning, in his brown-black robes, arrived at the entrance to the pool area.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, another letter has arrived from Daoist Master Tianwan."

Ning Wan felt a chill shoot to her brow, cursing silently. But the handsome face of the man on the throne broke into a smile of great interest, his eyes filled with mirth.

"Come in," he replied.

Though it was clearly not Ning Wan's voice, Lin Wuning responded with a natural and respectful "yes," lifted his robes, and stepped over the threshold.

He acted as if the prostrated Ning Wan was invisible. At his closest, he passed within an inch of her white robes, yet seemed to see nothing at all. He walked straight to the main throne, bowed, and respectfully presented the letter with both hands.

"Daoist Master, please see!"

Suiguan did not take the letter, but a single glance was enough to read its contents. His face erupted in unrestrained mockery, his expression suddenly animated.

"Hahahaha..."

"What a joke! Daring to ask for the position of Cold Qi!"

His laughter echoed through the cave. Lin Wuning's expression froze, as if he had been turned to stone the moment the laughter began, fixed in place.

The peak Purple Mansion Realm Great Daoist Master laughed for a while, then patted his seat.

"The Three Yangs command the Dawn; theirs is the bond of Monarch and minister. The Three Yins give birth to Cold; theirs is the title of Adjutant Envoy. Dawn Qi was only able to stage that little drama of a minister slaying his monarch because it rode the east wind of the collective will after the Bright Yang Monarch fell. Only then could its symbolism be altered, allowing it to gain some prestige and produce a Shi Chang. What are you, Tianwan? A cultivator of the fifth Dao, yet you still wish to cultivate Cold Qi? You dare make a claim on Cold Qi itself!"

He withdrew his gaze, having quickly lost interest. Ning Wan, meanwhile, bowed her head in thought. Seizing the opportunity while Suiguan had mentioned Si Boxiu, she said respectfully, "Senior Yuanxiu failed in his attempt at Fruition Attainment and perished in the Southern Sea."

Suiguan sat quietly upon the mount, one hand resting on the jade-like throne, his fair fingers tracing its patterns. A smile touched his bluish-purple eyes.

"What audacity. To dare leverage Du Qing's path to enlightenment. In the seven hundred years of the Azure Pond, he is the first."

‘What?’

Hearing him speak Pristine Water's true name so casually, Ning Wan felt her courage fail. Rooted to the spot, she felt the overwhelmingly oppressive aura of his divine ability and dared not raise her eyes or utter a word.

But Suiguan seemed amused.

"Of the so-called Three Yuans back then, the one named Tang had the worst talent. He was already fifteen, yet only at the second level of Qi Refining. But he had the most courage and the most ruthless heart. Looking back now, that's not quite right. Chi Rui was mistaken. This Si Boxiu was the most ruthless of them all."

"Seeking Gathering Wood... A fine idea... A profound Dao-Profundity!"

The Dao-Profundity, cunning, and courage Si Boxiu had displayed in his attempt to attain the Dao were worthy of praise even from Suiguan, far surpassing Chi Wei. It made him narrow his eyes.

"A pity that the shamans have vanished and the Wood Virtue is in decline. The position of Gathering Wood hangs vacant. Otherwise, had he truly attained the Dao through this, it would have been quite an interesting event!"

Ning Wan knew there had to be a reason for Yuanxiu's actions before his death, but her own Dao-Profundity was not high enough to see it clearly. It now seemed he had tried to leverage Du Qing's status—an act akin to provoking a tiger. She dared not interject. She saw Suiguan sit up straight, the smile gradually fading from his face.

"Unfortunately, the Chi family was still of use."

The entire aura of the Pristine Merging Owl Pool instantly congealed, as if plunged into the depths of winter. Despair crept into Ning Wan's heart.

‘The Si family and the Lingu family joined forces, fanned the flames by various other families, and the Li family dug the grave that buried the Chi family. And now I am the one who must face the consequences!’

She gently raised her head and said respectfully, "The Chi family was annihilated in an act of revenge by several families... By the time this junior emerged from seclusion, their entire clan was already wiped out..."

The man above her smiled faintly, and his face took on a demonically handsome quality. He rose from the main throne and clasped his hands behind his back. The entire Pristine Merging Owl Pool seemed to thaw, filled with the warmth of a spring breeze.

"No matter. As long as they can be made to serve. It will just mean a few more deaths."

"However, there is a Chi Buzi who has now fled to the Eastern Sea. Not only to the Eastern Sea, but to Penglai. He has courage too, attempting to cultivate Water Mansion."

Suiguan's gaze was profound as he continued, "Your Azure Pond Sect is full of ambitious and astute individuals... I've observed Golden Feather, and it produces many who are masters of diplomacy, unpredictable, and skilled in subterfuge. It's all due to the influence of Zhang Yuanyu's status. It seems you are all a product of your environment as well, influenced by Du Qing's legacy!"

Ning Wan kept her eyes lowered, sighing inwardly.

The man, however, descended step by step from the high throne, drawing closer. "The vastness of Water Mansion has been lost, and the Auxiliary Position no longer responds. But the Intercalary Position is still worth a try. He is a clever one, of course. Whether it's available or not, to at least attempt its cultivation is timely in this age. It's just that the Dragon-kin are unlikely to allow it."

As he spoke of the Dragon-kin, a deep coldness flashed in his eyes, though a smile played on his lips.

"The hearts of those wretched hornless dragons are smaller than the eye of a needle. The Northern Sea Dragon King's heart is a bit larger than his brothers', but not by much. He has difficult days ahead of him..."

Hearing him speak so casually of Zhang Yuanyu, Du Qing, Shi Chang, and the Dragon King, Ning Wan was already terrified. The names alone felt blasphemous to her ears. When the topic finally shifted back to Chi Buzi, she hastily said, "This man is devoted to the Dao. After Chi Wei's death, he vanished without a trace..."

"Mm," Suiguan grunted faintly. "He is cleverer than Chi Wei."

With that, the man with bluish-purple eyes said no more. He slowly closed his eyes, and the aura of Pristine Water above the Pristine Merging Owl Pool grew calm. The only sound was the dripping of a spring within the cave. Ning Wan waited for a long while before finally hearing the man speak again, his tone flat.

"Accompany me to the Pristine Speech Heaven."

The heart that had been caught in Ning Wan's throat finally plummeted. Despair filled her. Even Yuansu himself would not have had the power to refuse, let alone her. After a moment's hesitation, she could only force out a single, powerless word.

"Yes..."

As she spoke, the rolling aura of Pristine Water began to permeate the pool. A fine, drizzling rain started to fall within the cave, gradually obscuring the two figures until they vanished without a trace. The space became empty and silent, leaving only Lin Wuning kneeling by the pool's edge.

*Drip!*

As the rain dissipated, the pool's surface returned to its tranquil state, clear once more like a mirror. It reflected Ning Wan's white robes and her beautiful face, her head slightly bowed, rendered with exceptional clarity in the pure water.

Ning Wan's reflection was still in the Pristine Merging Owl Pool.

And on the reflected main throne, Suiguan's reflection had also appeared. His bluish-purple eyes were downcast, gazing silently at Ning Wan.

Soon, he rose gracefully. The reflected Ning Wan also stood, a hint of unease in her movements, and followed closely behind him until they disappeared beyond the edge of what the Pristine Merging Owl Pool could reflect.

...

Moongaze Lake.

The late autumn frost had descended. The trees along the shore were rimmed with white, and the road was coated in ice. The wheels of a carriage crunched as they passed over it. The crack of a whip mingled with the hushed whispers of passersby.

"The turmoil in the north has been going on for some time. It's only getting worse lately."

"Isn't that the truth... So many have died... Didn't a Daoist Master fall just the other day?"

The snippets of conversation drifted through the carriage window. The young man inside lifted the curtain and turned with a smile.

"It's not often Fourth Uncle emerges from seclusion. It just so happens the Dawn Guest Tower has a new play. I thought this would be a nice way to reconnect, and also... I've always heard the scenery along this lake is magnificent. A chance for you to enjoy it."

Beside him, Li Zhouluo smiled. "So that's why you were so keen on a carriage ride... As for the play... since Zhouming went into seclusion, there are fewer people trying to curry his favor, and fewer still who would spend a fortune for his amusement. A new play is a rare treat."

The young man was, of course, Li Jiangzong. He was much more diplomatic than his father and didn't share his deep attachment to their grand-uncle, Li Chenghao. This outing was clearly an attempt to smooth things over—Li Zhouluo was not only a Foundation Establishment cultivator but also came from a prominent line. Offending him was unwise.

Li Zhouluo understood this as well. On that day, he had instinctively sided with Li Zhoufang, telling him not to rashly disturb the Daoist Master. But after a day or two back at the lake, he had begun to regret it. Setting aside the clan elders, Li Zhoufang himself had always treated him well.

Now, with the intent to apologize, he was being very accommodating. The two made their way to Lijing Prefecture, a place filled with ancient residences.

Many of the families that had originated here were now high and mighty cultivators. Every house in this ancestral land was a monument, and they still returned every year for ancestral worship. Though it looked old and worn, it was the most distinguished area by the lake, more so than even the dense forests.

After winding through the blue-bricked houses, they stopped before a large tavern. The proprietor was already waiting outside, his eyes bright as he led them in, as deferential as a servant.

"Honored sirs... this way, please!"

Many onlookers turned to stare. Those who recognized the two couldn't help but feel a jolt of shock and quickly lowered their heads.

Li Zhouluo paid them no mind. Unlike Li Zhouming, he only came out for leisure once in a great while, and with his status as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, no one dared to say a word. They were led to the highest floor, where a stage was set in the center. The sound of singing, melodious and captivating, drifted down from it.

The proprietor had naturally reserved the best seats. The two sat at a central table, and Li Jiangzong eagerly poured him wine, offering many pleasantries before lowering his voice.

"My father was simply overcome with grief that day. His words were improper. I hope Fourth Uncle can understand..."

"It was I who was reckless!" Li Zhouluo said with a hint of sadness. He took a sip of wine and spoke at length, reminiscing about the camaraderie of their youth. The noise around them grew louder as the audience cheered. He glanced up at the stage and heard the actor sing:

"In chaotic times, millions upon millions were slain... Of my whole clan, only I remain, a fate so cruel, by heaven's decree~ a fate so cruel, for all to see..."

Li Zhouluo frowned. "What is this about..."

Li Jiangzong felt a bit awkward. He was always busy with clan affairs and had no time for plays, having only heard a summary to use as a conversation starter. He quickly smiled. "This is 'Lament for the Fleeting River.' It's about a young master whose entire family is murdered. Destitute, he kneels in a chaotic forest, ready to end his life, but his brother, who had become an immortal, finds him and raises him to the heavens... It's about brotherly devotion..."

Unsure, he added with another smile, "This play was commissioned by Uncle Zhouming. He found it in a neighboring prefecture and had it performed. He used to watch it privately, and I heard he even brought the Old Master to see it... It's only recently been shown to the public."

Li Xuanxuan had never been interested in such things, but after Li Ximing mentioned it, he had gone once or twice. In recent years, as his health failed and he could no longer draw talismans, he had found these performances novel.

"Ah!"

Li Zhouluo fell silent and nodded, turning to watch. But he had never had a taste for such things, and his gaze soon wandered. To his surprise, it landed on a middle-aged man standing by the side of the stage.

The man was dressed in common clothes, with a long, narrow face and phoenix eyes that, contrary to expectation, gave him an air of dignity and grace. He wore a Daoist crown on his head. Standing amidst the bustling crowd, he seemed to possess a clear, otherworldly presence. Though no cultivation could be detected from him, he had a unique bearing that made those around him instinctively give him a wide berth.

Tied to his waist with a purple cord were two small, quaint gourds, each no bigger than a fist. On the other side hung six small, decorative daggers, arranged in a neat row.

"A single clan ruled the prefecture... how many storms have now passed? North and south, heads rolled like gourds... the common folk suffer and are cast~ an injustice that will forever last!"

The crowd roared with applause and discussion. The man also nodded and smiled, his eyes filled with admiration.

‘What a remarkable individual.’

Li Zhouluo watched him for a few moments, nodding to himself. Cultivators often stood out, but temperament and bearing were innate. Unless one had altered their appearance, some things were hard to change. He doubted that even many of the cultivators he had met could compare to this man.

"Fourth Uncle!"

Li Jiangzong's voice brought him back. Li Zhouluo chuckled. "This is our ancestral land, after all. It's no surprise to find such a graceful person here."

Li Jiangzong looked toward the stage thoughtfully. They both took a sip of wine. An old man had now appeared on stage, dressed in tattered robes, singing:

"In years past, this forest was a realm of ghosts... where even great demons hid their boasts... a ghostly wind would sweep men high..."

Li Zhouluo shook his head. The imagination of these low-level cultivators was certainly wild, but from his higher cultivation perspective, it all felt too much like ancient tales of ghosts and immortals. He had little interest. He was about to speak when he heard a soft sound. A man was now standing beside their table.

Their table had the best view in the house, reserved long in advance by Li Jiangzong. For someone to suddenly appear uninvited displeased him. He was about to look up and speak when Li Zhouluo turned his head, his pupils instantly dilating as if in shock.

The man by the table wore armor with fine, scale-like plates. He was tall, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist. His face, framed by strong brows, was not handsome in a conventional sense, but it possessed an intimidating aura that made it difficult to look at him directly. His mere presence exerted a palpable pressure on the two of them.

‘A Daoist Master?!’

It was Li Zhouwei.

Li Jiangzong had only seen him a few times, but how could he not recognize his own clan's Daoist Master? His entire body tensed. A cold shock shot from his spine to his head, leaving him gaping, unable to speak.

Yet everyone around them seemed completely oblivious, their attention fixed on the stage. Li Zhouwei's expression was calm, his hands clasped behind his back. His brilliant golden eyes were also focused on the front.

Li Zhouluo's mind went blank. For a moment, he wanted to leap from his seat and bow, but he couldn't move. He could only feign composure. After a long, hesitant pause, he managed to speak, his voice filled with dread.

"Greetings... Daoist Master!"

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. His golden eyes remained fixed on the middle-aged man below the stage. The man seemed utterly unaware, his expression turning sorrowful as the actor on stage wept with envy.

"Tossed about, with no path to take, how can a ghost compare to an immortal's make? But he who became an immortal! The four islands revolve, mountains and rivers bright~ all at his command. The five ghost envoys command wind and thunder~ all by his order..."

As the drawn-out notes of the song soared through the air, a change flickered in Li Zhouwei's eyes. He tilted his head slightly and said softly, "Move further away. Protector Ding is waiting for you outside."

# Chapter 936: Lament for the Fleeting River

'How can a ghost compare to an immortal's make?'

The actor's melody still hung in the air. Li Zhouwei stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his index finger resting on the opposite wrist. He tapped silently, seemingly matching the rhythm of the pipa playing below.

Below, the middle-aged man’s phoenix eyes narrowed, a hint of a smile touching his lips. He remained silent, but brought his hands from behind his back. One hand moved to untie a small gourd at his waist.

The gourd was small and charming, its contents a mystery—wine, perhaps, or some other brew. The man took a sip, then rested his other hand on his hip, his forefinger casually hooked over the hilt of the central blade among the six small swords at his belt.

His relaxed, almost careless posture was that of a minor official from a neighboring town, the sort who might tend his own small vegetable garden. As if, having finished his duties and tilled his fields, he had simply wandered over to enjoy the music.

But Li Zhouwei did not relax in the slightest.

In his golden pupils, however, the man before him pulsed with five terrifying streams of multicolored light. They were like a dragon lying dormant in the abyss, concealed within the deep darkness of the Great Void. They resided within his flawless dharma body, perfectly integrated and harmonised.

'A Great Daoist Master... A Great Daoist Master from the "Rainbow Glow" Dao! A grand cultivator who has achieved perfected divine abilities!'

When Jiangnan cultivators celebrated a new divine ability, they often spoke of "Achieving the Five Methods." The more ancient and esteemed cultivators would speak of the "Five Methods Perfected, Averting the Great Calamity." This referred to the very first step toward Fruition Attainment—the state of perfected divine abilities that this man had reached!

This was, without a doubt, the highest level of cultivation in the present age beneath that of a True Monarch. The number of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who had reached this state and could still walk the world could be counted on one hand. Even within the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, only the "Two Purples" of the legendary "Three Yuans, Two Purples" had ever achieved it. Today, the only one known to be alive at this stage was the elusive Zimu, whose movements were shrouded in legend... Outside that tradition, there was Jiang Boqing, but he was a figure from an age long past.

As for the others, whether it was Chi Wei from earlier times or Si Boxiu more recently, they had all only managed to complete their five great divine abilities at the very end of their lives. And as for what supplements or substitutes they used to get there, and what effect it had? Only they themselves knew if they could truly boast of perfection.

A peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had perfected their divine abilities while still possessing a long life, one who had the leisure to stroll through the mortal world... the Li family had never encountered such a person in all their years. This was the first. The last person known to walk the world so freely with such power was now the Jade True Six-Nine Void True Monarch, one of the "Three Shamans and Two Rites," a being who sat upon a divine altar!

And that "Rainbow Glow" affinity... which sect could it be, other than... Mount Luoxia!

'Ghosts... Is he hinting at the Underworld? ...Forget what the Underworld feels about Li Qianyuan, why would they ever back me? They're just hoping a few more cultivators break through to True Monarch so they can harvest the Metallic Essence left behind!'

He had been cultivating on the north shore when he suddenly felt a pull from the unseen world, as if destiny itself were guiding him. At the same time, an unrelenting chill radiated from his Shengyang Acupoint, giving him the feeling that his life was hanging by a thread. He had no choice but to ride the winds and silently follow that pull...

He already knew someone was coming. Tianhuo of the Golden Feather Sect had even sent a veiled warning, telling him a "distinguished guest" was heading south and asking if he truly needed to remain here... But seeing him now... what a truly formidable figure!

'Is he here for me, or just passing through on his way south to watch?'

'What does he mean by acting so unhurried? How long have I been at the Purple Mansion Realm! At the speed of a divine ability, I'd have had enough time to fly to the Sea's Cape and back several times over! If Mount Luoxia truly wanted to keep me on the mainland, to force me to break through right under their nose, why are they dragging their feet like this?'

'It's like they were hoping I'd leave, but reluctantly. Now that they see I'm not leaving, he 'conveniently' drops by. But what would have happened if I had *actually* fled overseas?!'

His expression darkened, his golden eyes fixed intently on the man below. His thoughts churned, rising and falling like an uncertain tide.

'They casually dispatch a Great Daoist Master with perfected divine abilities... Just how many Daoist Masters, how many True Monarchs, does Mount Luoxia command?'

The Dawn Guest Tower was filled with noise, but his thoughts remained ice-cold and clear. Beside him, however, Li Zhouluo was covered in a cold sweat.

Li Zhouwei had suddenly appeared in this tower, using a divine ability for no apparent reason, and had then secretly arranged for the two of them to be led away. Something was definitely wrong.

For a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to act so personally... could it be that another master of divine abilities was hidden here?

He had no choice but to put down his chopsticks. He exchanged a look with Li Jiangzong and they quietly stood up. The proprietor of the Dawn Guest Tower, who should have been waiting on them, was nowhere to be seen. Li Zhouluo let out a silent breath of relief. Feigning some errand, the two of them slipped away down the nearby stairs.

Their table was in the very center of the tavern, the most conspicuous spot where every movement would normally be watched. But right now, the actor's tragic wail was at its peak, and no one seemed to notice the two empty seats.

Li Zhouwei raised his head slightly, listening to the actor on stage plead with the heavens, begging for the return of his kinsmen. The actor sang:

"Bones overflow, blood freezes in spring.
A river of red tears flows; I am a lonely ghost...
Oh, father and brothers! Where have the old days gone?
My spirit is all that remains, cold...
A body like deadwood, rootless, adrift,
Tattered rags offer no warmth...
Whose wretched child is this..."

The middle-aged man listened and sighed silently. Two more actors in splendid costumes appeared on stage. They wore white silks around their waists, symbolizing that they were riding the clouds. A voice sang out in recitative:

"Invited to the immortal peaks, seated on the golden dais,
Watching the glows of dusk, half-hidden from heaven's light.
Snow-white candles, robes of vibrant spirit,
Are all affairs in the mortal world settled?
I lament I am not a floating cloud.
My retainers ride qilin-hoofed steeds from the mountains,
From dark windows, the lower world looks up in awe...
Oh, my descendant! How did you become a ghost!"

As Li Zhouwei listened, the hand that had been tapping on his wrist stilled. He said nothing, but the people around him began to clamor. Every other word was about immortals and ghosts. Someone even sighed:

"If you don't seek immortality, what's the point of even living!"

As they spoke, the old man playing the Demon ghost returned to the stage, hissing menacingly as he tempted the protagonist:

"Raise the jasper palace, pave the jade tower,
Let your light reflect the blood on the ghostly wind's brow.
The three great halls, the moonlit rain,
Control your nature, and you too can become a golden rainbow.
If there were truly a path to immortality,
Why would they ever let *you* have it?
I fear it is all... a flute playing chaos on the wind,
The deceptive scent of a drooling dragon."

This was always the most thrilling part of the play. The audience craned their necks, eyes glued to the stage. They were terrified the protagonist would be swayed by the demon ghost, but also afraid the immortals would give up in disappointment and leave him to his fate.

The actor immediately broke into a tearful plea. The two sides went back and forth, one singing as the other finished. The music's pitch climbed higher, pushing the atmosphere to its absolute peak. Everyone in the audience stopped, cups and chopsticks frozen in mid-air. They stared at the stage, silent and motionless.

Li Zhouwei’s expression grew complicated. As he shifted his gaze back to the middle-aged man, he found the man was no longer focused on the play. He had turned his head slightly, revealing a dignified and righteous profile.

And those phoenix eyes... they crossed the distance between them, locking onto him with a quiet, steady gaze.

Within his brown pupils, strands of multicolored light erupted, swirling like a vast, turbulent vortex of Heavenly Glow. In that instant, the distance between them seemed to stretch to the ends of the earth, yet also felt as close as breathing.

'Sword...'

From those pupils, Li Zhouwei felt a piercing sharpness that made his own eyes ache. It was a power that was clearly contained, yet it felt as if it could soar to the heavens at any moment. This sharp aura was hidden within the Heavenly Glow, like a coiled dragon floating just beneath the surface, revealing only a single scale, a single claw.

The Li family had risen to prominence as a clan of sword immortals. They not only possessed a Sword Codex that anchored the clan's destiny, but also had many ancestors who were masters of the Way of the Sword. Li Zhouwei was naturally familiar with it. From this one glance, he sensed something profoundly different.

'It's not Sword Intent... It's another path, different from Sword Intent. It is still the sword... but it is a sword of Dao-Profundity, a sword of spell arts, a sword of divine ability.'

Li Zhouwei knew that Li Xizhi possessed a sword technique called the Five-Colour Sinking Expanse Sword Art. It was immensely famous, and it, too, was related to Heavenly Glow!

'Perhaps this is that very kind of sword technique, cultivated to an unfathomably high realm. The Way of the Sword is hidden within the divine ability itself. Wherever the divine ability passes, the brilliance of the sword technique shines!'

And this aura of Rainbow Glow sword qi sent a profound, life-threatening sense of danger rising from the depths of his heart, forcing him to make an instant assessment:

'This sword is in no way inferior to ordinary Sword Intent, and its power is simply immeasurable... Mount Luoxia... I fear... I fear neither Chi Wei nor Jiang Boqing would be his match. Even Duanmu Kui, who dominated his entire generation... was probably no better than this!'

The vortex of Rainbow Glow sword qi vanished as if it were an illusion, flickering before his eyes for only a fraction of a second before disappearing, revealing the man's brown pupils once more. The Great Daoist Master, perfected in his divine abilities, showed no other unusual signs. He simply continued to gaze calmly at the pair of golden eyes hidden in the upper gallery.

The cheers of the crowd swelled around them like a tidal wave, but the two men seemed separate from the world, cut off from time. They formed their own universe, locking everything into that single, shared gaze.

And yet, one clear, melodic voice from the stage—long, drawn-out, and beautiful—drifted through the air and echoed in his ear:

"The handsome youth of Long Prefecture,
Officials in his line for generations.
He attained the Roc's ocean, held the Phoenix's marsh,
If not for one family ruling the prefecture alone...
How could they be wiped out in ten generations?
Immortals not respected, gods not revered,
No need for ghosts or monsters to act...
Without you, oh!
How could a single disciple of your house still live?"

In that instant, Li Zhouwei’s brow lowered slightly. At his waist, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd gleamed a dull, brownish-gold in the shadows. The cheers in the tower grew louder, roaring like a landslide, like a tsunami.

"He crossed the straits to Penglai,
As the morning light first dawned.
A sword bound by one hundred twenty chains,
The qilin weeps, leaving its home.
But as long as the throne has an owner,
Who is to say who cannot sit on it!
The old father's heart wished to slay the son,
A pity immortals guarded the underworld springs...
If not for the flying glow watching from the heavens,
How many in the prefecture would still survive!"

Li Zhouwei’s pupils widened slightly. He gripped the railing, his expression growing heavier, which only made the gold in his eyes burn brighter. He narrowed his eyes, but still said nothing.

'The old father's heart wished to slay the son...'

The ethereal voice of Qingyu Qian echoed in his mind, along with those chilling words:

'Son slays father, father kills son, father steals son's love, son seizes father's power...'

'The son is strong and the father is weak; how could he not seize his position? ...But Bright Yang detests inversion; how could he not fear his own son!'

A cold glint flashed in Li Zhouwei’s eyes. He seemed to understand many things in that one moment. But the middle-aged man before him slowly averted his gaze, turning to look somewhere else.

His gaze was like a sharp sword, parting the sea and cutting through the waves. It compelled one's attention, forcing them to ignore the surrounding noise and chaos, and follow it to a small table on the far periphery.

The table was barely two feet square, one of the cheapest seats in the Dawn Guest Tower. A youth in a white robe sat there, holding a small cup in one hand and chopsticks in the other. He was studying a small saucer on his table.

On the saucer were two very thick slices of pickled radish. He seemed at a loss as to how to begin, turning them over and over with his chopsticks as if researching their purpose.

As the middle-aged man’s gaze fell on him, the youth gave up and dropped his chopsticks. He looked up, revealing a face of cold, delicate beauty, almost feminine. His black hair fell like a waterfall, his demeanor as still as ice.

He was handsome, with normal hands and feet, but for one thing: he had an extra ear on each cheek. They were long and pointed, following the curve of his jawline back toward his normal ears. This feature instantly transformed his aura, making him appear both aloof and demonic.

Though he sat perfectly still, a faint halo of multicolored light flickered behind his head. It radiated outwards, fading in and out of view, mitigating much of his demonic aura and lending him an air of sanctity instead.

Compared to the other man’s relaxed ease, his expression was cold, even grave.

But the moment he looked up, all sound vanished. The entire Dawn Guest Tower fell utterly silent. The surrounding patrons were frozen in a tableau of myriad expressions—some craning their necks to shout, some shaking their heads and sighing, some whispering, others critiquing loudly. All of them were stopped like statues. A piece of meat, halfway to a mouth, hung in the air. Wine, pouring from a jug, hung like a crystal thread. Even motes of spittle were frozen in mid-flight.

The actors on stage, however, were completely unaware. They performed with growing fervor as cascades of golden flowers and colorful silks, prepared in advance, rained down from above. This signaled the bestowing of immortal blessings and the retreat of the demon ghost. The protagonist had finally achieved immortality, and the surrounding actors all bowed down in reverence.

"He receives the immortal's station, bathed in divine light!
True devotion earns the immortal's reward!
Sunny mists, dragon banners flying,
Grand music soars on the wind and clouds!
For half an incense stick, the bell rings, we kowtow,
This one spark of immortality is the truest of all!"

A faint, amused smile appeared on the Great Daoist Master's face, as if lamenting the other's dramatic display. His interest in the actors was clearly greater, and the disturbance immediately made him turn back.

He glanced at the stage, saw with some regret that the play was ending, and murmured a few words of praise. He re-fastened the gourd to his waist, brushed the dust from his sleeves—and with it, the aura of the mortal world—and gave Li Zhouwei a faint smile.

In the next instant, the spot where he stood was empty. Not a shadow of him remained.

Li Zhouwei immediately snapped his gaze to the corner. That table, too, was empty. Even the wine was gone. Only the two slices of radish remained.

"Bravo!"

A single shout of praise shattered the silence. In that same instant, the tower burst back into motion. The suspended wine splashed into the cup, the airborne meat finally reached its destination, and an endless wave of noise erupted once more.

"Bravo!"

The clinking of copper coins rang out as audience members rushed the stage to offer tips. After some time, the crowd escorted the actors out, and the noise finally began to subside. Then, the entire tower suddenly grew dark.

But on the highest gallery, the man in scaled armor still stood motionless. As darkness enveloped everything, only his golden pupils continued to glitter, emitting a chilling, dreadful light.

The tower became utterly silent, so quiet that not a sound could be heard. A man in black robes crept up the stairs, trembling, and knelt before Li Zhouwei. He spoke in a respectful, fearful voice:

"Daoist Master..."

Li Zhouwei’s expression was unreadable, but his voice was slow and heavy when he spoke.

"What was the name of that play?"

As he spoke, Chen Yang buried his head even lower.

"It was... *Lament for the Fleeting River*."



# Chapter 937: Marvelous Wisdom Whisker

The noonday sunbeams spilled across the polished desk, illuminating a neat row of wooden slips. An old man sat in the courtyard, looking up with a smile.

"Daoist Master, what brings you to my humble place?"

Beside him, Li Zhouwei sipped his tea, his expression somewhat heavy. Only here in Li Xuanxuan's courtyard did he allow a trace of his anxiety to show.

"The new tune from the Dawn Guest Tower," Li Zhouwei began, "have you heard it, Venerable Sir?"

Li Xuanxuan was getting on in years. Whether facing Li Ximing or Li Zhouwei, he preferred to call them "Daoist Master." It wasn't a matter of closeness or distance; it was more for his own peace of mind. Hearing the question, he shook his head.

"Ever since Ming'er went into seclusion, I haven't gone to listen to *Lament for the Fleeting River*. I was afraid it would stir up my worries and make me overthink. However, I heard this new one is very different. The lyrics have been changed, and it has a fresh feel."

Although the old man's spirits were not high, his status ensured he knew a great deal. He sighed.

"I heard the Daoist Master went to the Dawn Guest Tower. You must have had guests..."

Li Zhouwei set down his cup, his gaze low.

"I met some people from the north. They didn't particularly care about me; they were just passing through to check my 'quality,' so to speak. They listened to one song and left."

'It's only natural,' Li Zhouwei thought. 'I am an unexpected variable, an accident. It's best if they just ignore me. If I can be of help, great. If not, no harm done. The only complication is that my name is registered with the Underworld, which makes it difficult to 'take me away,' so they'll just let events run their course.'

Li Xuanxuan picked up his cup, his expression dimming.

"On the contrary, it's the other side that becomes difficult to answer to."

Li Zhouwei understood the old man meant the Dragon-kin. Although the Qilin and the Dragons had an ancient relationship, and the Dragon-kin lived long lives, offering him some small favors, things would change. As his strength continued to grow, the day would come when he could truly challenge for Fruition Attainment. On that day, the schism and suspicion between him and the Dragon-kin would undoubtedly intensify...

'Qingyu Qian also said that the Dragon-kin have no real intention of supporting Li Qianyuan. For thousands of years, the Dragon-kin have been singularly focused on pursuing the Dao of True Dragons. They only hope to delay their own fall and, in the process, drain as much of Luoxia's energy as possible... If they truly wanted to help him escape, they would need to suppress me, prevent my cultivation from advancing too quickly, and find ways for Li Qianyuan to get to me. Whether the Dragon-kin don't dare or simply don't want to, their current actions of repeatedly helping me clearly signal a different agenda.'

'I myself am a consequence of the Fruition Attainment's instability, a clearly visible pawn that Luoxia has placed on the board. Luoxia holds the absolute advantage; they are far too cunning, and the Dragon-kin are caught awkwardly in the middle.'

'As for the four-eared man in white... he's almost certainly a fox.'

Possessing multiple ears was a distinct external trait of the Mount Dali Fox Clan's Daoist tradition. Considering the location and the other party's reaction, the answer wasn't difficult to deduce.

'First... the Dragon-kin... or rather, Dongfang Lieyun's statement, wasn't false, but it was heavily biased. The Fox Clan's words were more neutral... Luoxia's meaning—at least the one on the surface—is that *anyone* can take the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment, as long as it isn't Li Qianyuan...'

'Furthermore, by Luoxia's estimation, if they weren't actively suppressing him, Li Qianyuan's reincarnation might even try to kill me to achieve his own Dao. This not only aligns with the nature of the Bright Yang Dao, but it is also his most probable path to breaking this stalemate.'

His expression gradually turned contemplative.

'If that's the case... when I was forced to leave the lake and go into seclusion in the Eastern Sea, was that the work of a single faction? The timing of the True Monarch's reincarnation lines up perfectly with my time in the Eastern Sea... It was essential that the reincarnation was kept from ever seeing me... This was all arranged long ago.'

But the attitude of that Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia was truly fascinating, sparking Li Zhouwei's speculation:

'He didn't say a single word; he just let the opera play out... It felt like his own personal decision. He was passing through the south and felt that my interests and Luoxia's were, in fact, aligned. While he disdained the idea of ordering me around, he clearly has a bit of a temper. He couldn't stand hearing others spread idle gossip, so he used the 'actor's' mouth to make the stance clear.'

But no matter how much Luoxia disdained the situation, or how much they interfered based on their own path and principles, they had the standing to do so. Li Zhouwei, on the other hand, had no right to voice an opinion, or even the right to choose.

'On the surface, the Dragon-kin are opposed, even willing to provide me with Metallic Essence in the end. But the Underworld in the south has not yet stated its position. And what do all the other True Monarchs in the world think? According to Luoxia, the Underworld is merely interested in collecting Metallic Essence, but who can truly know if they aren't planting seeds everywhere, preparing to draw in their net!'

He watched the visitors depart, understanding his predicament. Mount Luoxia sat securely on its high perch, watching with detached interest. The Dragon-kin and the Underworld both had their own clandestine plans. Even the Buddhists in the north and the various powers on the seas had their own agendas. It wasn't just his personal fate that was adrift.

'I'm afraid it will only be at the very end, when an outcome is reached that satisfies the vast majority of these powers, that the Li family will have any future to speak of...'

He was lost in heavy thought, holding his cup in silence. Li Xuanxuan watched him, a look of understanding on his face. After a long while, he finally spoke.

"The Four Xis were the pillars of our Li family in their time, and Ximing was the most outstanding among them. He conceals his brilliance and blends with the world; he has his own measure of things. You are our family's Qilin of this century. He passed the authority of the family to you. Whatever you decide, that is the will of the entire clan."

Ever since Li Ximing had given him the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, Li Zhouwei had come to a new understanding. A light now shone in his eyes as he spoke softly.

"Minghuang has received the ancestors' trust. I only fear my considerations are not thorough enough. This conflict between north and south may still bring a calamity straight to our door. I must urge the younger generation to hone their divine abilities and advance their cultivation, until those divine abilities are perfected."

...

Kuidu Palace.

The True Fire blazed, its light shifting and changing. Golden flames illuminated the dark purple walls of the cauldron, intensifying the deep hues of its purple top and black base. On its surface, grotesque carvings of crows and owls lit up one by one, spitting black light as their profound mysteries emerged.

The five feet of the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron trembled, glowing in unison. The divine ability and dharma power within began to retract, coalescing into points of flowing light. The light was as warm and gentle as jade. The hand controlling the divine ability swiftly formed a seal, reining in the flames.

At once, the sound of a flowing stream echoed. Wisps of gray-black light shot from the cauldron's mouth, bound by the divine ability. They fell one by one into the waiting palm, forming round spirit pills, each inscribed with the winding, rugged patterns of mountains and rivers.

"The pills are complete!"

Li Ximing exhaled slowly, a look of profound satisfaction on his face.

The art of alchemy was a delicate balance. Pills that were too difficult were troublesome to refine, draining the mind and spirit. Pills that were too simple were just plain boring. The Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder was of medium difficulty, and the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron was exceptionally smooth to operate. How could it not be a satisfying refinement? He opened the jade box to find two full rows of pills lying within.

"A full seventeen pills!"

The Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron truly lived up to its name as a Purple Mansion Realm Spirit Cauldron. Furthermore, its Merging Owl Dao was compatible with Pit Water. This single batch had produced a full eight pills—undoubtedly the most Purple Mansion Realm pills he had ever refined at one time. If not for the mismatch with his own Daoist tradition, he might have achieved an unprecedented ten!

Of course, in alchemy, the pill count was also related to the formula. The Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill, for instance, was classified as a 'medicine' meant for emergencies, so a normal batch yielded only three to five pills; the true skill lay in increasing their potency. The Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder also benefited from its formula:

'As the saying goes: a "Powder" is used to disperse and treat stubborn ailments; five or six pills are made for common use. A "Powder" formula inherently yields one or two more pills than average, but even accounting for that, eight is an extremely impressive result!'

The two batches combined totaled sixteen pills. Adding the one he had left over from before, he now had seventeen. This was more than enough to deliver the fifteen promised to Dingyang Zi. He glanced at the medicine box to the side. Inside, the dark, glittering Cangzhou Serpent Scale lay waiting.

'Cangzhou Serpent Scale, acquired!'

He gazed at the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron, feeling a momentary twinge of regret.

'It's a fantastic tool, it really is. Such a shame it's not mine.'

Li Ximing was not wealthy in spiritual materials. After using the Surging Li Treasure Leaf, he was left with only the Neck Feathers and Shangxiang Silver. Now, adding this new material, he carefully stored it away, thinking:

'I'll send fifteen over and keep one or two for myself. It's still a spirit pill, after all. It could be useful in a pinch.'

He then checked the jade pendant Liu Changdie had given him. It had activated three or five days ago and was still glowing faintly. Clearly, his contact had already been found. He couldn't delay any longer.

Li Ximing rose, his work complete, and walked out of the palace. The halls on either side were silent and empty, but Daoist Master Houfu, dressed in Daoist robes, approached with a smile.

"I saw the clouds of qi stirring and knew you had succeeded, Daoist Master. I never expected to catch the scent of Pit Water as well. Such fine alchemy skills!"

Li Ximing offered a few modest words in reply. "Senior, you praise me too much. I was just warming up the cauldron and testing the pill fire and the energies of this auspicious ground. It truly is a first-class location. I find myself quite envious."

Houfu replied with his own humble deflections, but Li Ximing continued,

"I need to refine a pill for that friend of mine, and I must first go and pick up an assistant. It's a good chance for you to meet him, Senior."

"Please, go ahead."

The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was weak at present, so Houfu was naturally happy to forge more connections. He stroked his beard and nodded. Li Ximing bid him farewell and took to the air, treading the Great Void as he flew toward Splitreed Island, following the connection from the jade talisman.

Soon, he passed over Splitreed Island and stopped above a patch of open sea nearby. He dove straight into the water. A silver pavilion stood upon a reef below. With flying eaves, carved beams, and painted pillars, it was a magnificent sight as fish and shrimp swam freely through its open halls.

A sweep of his divine ability told him this was merely a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, though it possessed a certain magic. It was a temporary traveling palace, built purely for enjoyment and lacking many other functions. He smiled to himself.

'He is a Formations Master, after all, and he spent so much time in the Southern Borderlands. He's certainly well-off.'

He descended into the pavilion. Liu Changdie was sitting cross-legged, his aura fluctuating unstably. It seemed he had just been in a fight or had recently used a powerful divine ability. Seeing Li Ximing arrive, he immediately opened his eyes and smiled.

"Ximing, you're here!"

Li Ximing's smile faded slightly as he raised an eyebrow. "This is..."

Liu Changdie waved his hand to show it was nothing. He stretched out his hand and pointed to the desk, where a dark metal box sat. He smiled.

"You used your Surging Li Treasure Leaf last time, and I said I would compensate you for it. I went and fetched this for you. Please, take a look. The value should be roughly equivalent!"

Li Ximing naturally remembered the conversation and knew Liu Changdie wasn't one for empty words, but he was surprised it had happened so quickly. He tried to refuse once or twice, but Liu Changdie brushed off his protests. Left with no choice, Li Ximing smiled, offered his thanks, and stepped forward to open the box.

The box was no larger than his palm. Inside, heavy, milky-white clouds swirled, looking like a bowl of goat's milk gently rippling. Li Ximing focused his divine ability at his brow and easily pierced through the mist. Floating in the very center was a yellowish-white wooden whisker. It was about an inch long, covered in minute, delicate branches, and no wider than a blade of grass.

There had to be another spiritual formation layered inside the box; even with the lid open, the spiritual mist did not disperse.

"This is a Marvelous Wisdom Whisker," Liu Changdie explained. "It's a resource for the Gathering Wood Dao. It grows on Little Mountain of Vast Jade in the Western Sea. The moment it senses the ground, it burrows and becomes impossible to find... It must be contained using the Foundation Establishment Realm spiritual object, Heart-Locking Cloud, and further secured with formations. Otherwise, it will escape at the slightest lapse in attention. A friend of mine found a few on the mountain long ago and gave me one as a resource. Now, I am passing it to you, Daoist Friend."

He smiled, though a bit awkwardly. "This item can treat the Qi Sea Juque ailment and can also dispel Profound Qi. If catalyzed with a divine ability and planted in the earth, it can sprout trees and attract birds. Its uses are... rather niche. The Gathering Wood Dao is not prominent these days, and what little we know of its uses comes from a line or two in old books. You might actually know more about it."

It was no wonder he felt awkward. The item was in a strange, borderline-useless category. What Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would ever need a spiritual object for their Qi Sea?

But Liu Changdie quickly changed the subject. "The Western Sea is, after all, extremely remote. It's the domain of the ancient master of the Water Mansion. It's impossible to cross without powerful divine abilities, and even if you reach the Abyss of the Water Mansion, it remains incredibly inconvenient. Very few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators bother to journey there. So, while this item may not be priceless, it is exceedingly rare."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly, sighing. "Senior, your generosity is profound!"

In truth, a niche item like the Marvelous Wisdom Whisker couldn't possibly compare to a spiritual material from the ascendant Li Fire Dao. The Surging Li Treasure Leaf had countless uses for him. But sacrifices had to be made to obtain Li Fire, and a single leaf was nothing. It was only due to Liu Changdie's integrity that he even spoke of compensation. How could Li Ximing possibly object?

His own reserves were not plentiful. He sighed in appreciation, thanked him again, and accepted the box.

"Daoist Friend Qingyan has been searching for spiritual materials in this area for several days now," Liu Changdie said. "I'll go call him back..."

He looked quite emotional as he turned back to Li Ximing. "He, too, has a difficult lot in life. The True Monarch of the Azure Manifestation Dao fell in the north long ago, transforming into a mountain. I heard his state at the time of his death was... unusual... and the Dao has not prospered since. Nearly all spiritual materials and spiritual qi for that path can only be found on that mountain. They are rarely seen anywhere else..."

"To make matters worse, Azure Manifestation is peculiar. Many of its spell arts and divine abilities urgently require those specific Azure Manifestation resources. But how could they possibly dare to go to the north? He has been running all over the world for so many years. I heard he managed to find a few things in Jiangnan, but then even Jiangnan dried up, forcing him to wander even more."

'Jiangnan... The only famous Azure Manifestation practitioners in Jiangnan are the Yuan family...'

Li Ximing pondered this silently, and then his heart suddenly jolted.

'It seems that this Demon beast has been treating the treasury of the great Yuan family of the Mushroom Forest Plains as his own personal garden, visiting it good and well a few times!'

'If this Demon beast is operating like this, then the other Azure Manifestation cultivators in the world are probably in a similar, sorry state... Yuan Huyuan said the Yuan family used up all the spiritual materials left by their ancestors... Was it truly *used up*, or did it just *vanish*? We can't know for sure. And what about those ancestors who died in seclusion, or those talented geniuses who died 'prematurely'... how many of them actually ended up in its belly!'

'The Yuan family's decline was no accident... The fact that their line still thrives to this day is only because someone in Jiangnan is protecting the legacy of the Dams-Goat Temple Palace. As long as the Yuan family continues to cultivate the Azure Manifestation Dao, they will live in a state of perpetual despair...'



# Chapter 938: Profound Illumination's Doubts

Just as the two had reached an agreement, the silver door shimmered, and a cyan figure descended from within.

He was a middle-aged man, appearing to be in his mid-thirties. He had a wide face, large eyes, thick brows, and a heavy beard. His double brows seemed carved by a knife, deep and heavy, and his entire face was taut as steel. Beneath his beard, one could vaguely see a tightly clenched jaw.

He carried an axe on his back as large as a door panel. His eyes were like sharp swords, projecting a fierce and unyielding aura. His back was exceptionally broad, and as he entered, it was like a giant bear pushing aside the curtain. The whole pavilion instantly felt cramped.

"Daoist Friend Qingyan!"

The moment Liu Changdie saw him, his expression turned serious and respectful.

"You've arrived at the perfect time!"

With just one glance, Li Ximing could sense the formidable power of this man's divine ability. The Azure Manifestation Dao was exceptional; back in the day, Yuan Chengduan of the Yuan family had been a renowned and powerful figure in Jiangnan, and the last prodigy of the Yuan family worth mentioning.

Not only did this newcomer have an impressive background as a noble scion, but his Azure Manifestation had also formed into a divine ability. Whether in combat or in the subtleties of his powers, he was first-class. This was not someone to be offended. Li Ximing stood up straight.

"Greetings, Daoist Friend. I am Zhaojing of Moongaze Lake."

"You two have been waiting long!"

His voice was like a great bell, deep and resonant. His eyes fixed on Li Ximing for a moment before he replied.

"It has been a long time since I've seen a descendant of Wei."

Li Ximing cupped his hands in response. "The rumors in the four realms are exaggerated. I've made a fool of myself before you, Daoist Friend."

The man sat down at the table, his bulk taking up more than half the space and casting a heavy shadow over the tabletop. He spoke in a deep voice.

"In years past, I was searching for the Supreme Concealed Origin. I passed through Great Tazi, went north to Great Yona, and crossed the Western Sea. I met a Daoist Friend there, whose Daoist name was Yangya, from the Cui clan. He was not as orthodox as you."

Li Ximing had heard of Daoist Master Yangya. He was a Daoist Master from the Cui family who had moved to the Western Sea and had since lost most contact with the main branch. Liu Changdie poured him some tea and smiled.

"I've heard of him too... a handsome man, quite famous in the Western Sea. There are some amusing stories about him..."

At this, Qingyan let out two short laughs, pinching the tiny teacup in his massive hand. Liu Changdie immediately turned back to Li Ximing, grinning.

"He was just minding his own business, built himself a palace, and settled some of his descendants there. But the local tribesmen were ignorant. After seeing him act a few times, they began to prostrate and worship him, calling him the Sun God."

Li Ximing was speechless. Liu Changdie continued playfully, "That was a fatal problem! It scared him half to death, and he fled overnight. But the tribesmen below were clueless; you couldn't teach them. In the end, he had no choice but to accept a few princes from the local kingdoms, have them cultivate in his palace, and then send them back to educate their people. What a fiasco! I heard it caused such a stir that... cultivators from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition even went to question him."

Li Ximing was silent for a moment, his interest piqued. "Who might that have been?"

Liu Changdie hadn't been in the Purple Mansion Realm for long, and most of this gossip was secondhand. He could only look toward Qingyan. The burly man put down his cup with some stiffness, stroked his beard, and said, "It was Yuanwu."

"So it was him!"

Both Liu Changdie and Li Ximing had a moment of realization. Liu Changdie even laughed.

"Yuanwu also has a foul temper. It's no wonder he'd be bored enough to make the trip. He was even worse when he was young. By that time, he was old, so he was probably much easier to deal with."

Li Ximing nodded silently. After these few sentences, they were familiar enough. Liu Changdie got to the point.

"Daoist Friend Fuxun wishes to entrust the refining of this Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill to Zhaojing, and he also requests Daoist Friend Qingyan's assistance."

"He already spoke with me."

But the man's brows furrowed, and an inviolable, majestic aura instantly appeared on his fierce and stubborn face. He pressed his large palm onto the table and said gravely, "I told him already. This method is too extreme, too fierce. It violates the path of steady advancement and nurturing one's fortune. How can it be used so rashly? We noble scions cannot be compared to common demons and ghosts, yet this is the work of demons and ghosts! He cultivates Auspicious Qi, not..."

He was perhaps about to say 'Bright Yang,' but mindful of Li Ximing, he swallowed the rest of his words. His eyes lowered slightly.

"If he takes this pill and succeeds, the outcome will be mediocre at best, and it will still require him to nurture his steady fortune for decades. But if he fails, I fear he will suffer greatly."

Although the man looked ferocious, it was clear he truly regarded Fuxun as a close friend. Li Ximing listened from the side, nodding to himself.

'The Dragon-kin have always considered themselves separate from the demon race, a clan unto themselves. I suppose most of these noble scions think the same way. Their ancestors were all of Fruition Attainment status, so they can't be lumped in with demons, just like the White Qilin or the Luan Sparrow.'

'But why mention Bright Yang...'

Liu Changdie listened silently and then spoke in a low voice.

"Daoist Friend, you may not return to Poluoduo often. The Xiangxiong Kingdom has now been established on the Great Western Plateau, and the Western Lesser Yang's 'Right Eastern Extreme Star' is shining brightly... He has no choice but to advance!"

His expression was complicated. "Besides, his divine ability is upon him. For something like this, where even half a chance in the mortal world aligns with his path, to refine an Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill... and to have it be Zhaojing, a cultivator of Bright Yang, who refines it... is this not the will of heaven aligning perfectly? The moment Senior Fuxun saw Zhaojing... he was rejoicing in his own divine ability."

Hearing this, Qingyan's expression flickered with complexity. "I understand."

Qingyan said no more, slowly nodding. He and Li Ximing went out together. Liu Changdie escorted them to the nearby sea, handed an item to Qingyan, and bade them farewell.

***

When they arrived at the vast Tiger's Frontier Mountain, the Demon King there showed no suspicion. Instead, he was filled with admiration, praising them endlessly. They proceeded to the outskirts of Kuidu Palace, where they saw Houfu approaching, treading on the snow.

Li Ximing made the introductions. Houfu's eyes practically lit up, and he hurried down to greet them, saying politely, "It is truly a descendant of the Qingyi Dixiang! My apologies for the poor reception."

A rare smile touched Qingyan's face. "Tiger's Frontier is a treasured land, a fine immortal sect. The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition's reputation is well-deserved."

The two seemed to hit it off, and Houfu was particularly emotional. But he understood they had important matters to attend to and didn't delay them. Li Ximing observed this, making a quick calculation.

'This is good... The Merging Owl that Xiukui cultivates is also one of the Three Shamans and Two Rites, with many shamanic aspects. A noble scion of the Azure Manifestation Dao is surely a welcome guest here...'

Thus, they entered the palace, arriving before the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron.

Qingyan scanned his surroundings, then took a silver basin from his sleeve. It was the size of a large bowl, shining brightly as if filled with clear water, and emitting a soft light like the moon.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing," he said deeply, "I cultivate the Azure Manifestation divine ability, and I must keep my shamanic arts close. This is 'Eastern Life Flowing Water.' It has been recited over with eighty-one restrictive texts and blessed a thousand times with my divine ability. Keep it in your hand."

"When the time comes for refining, release this water into your Juque Palace and immerse it with your spiritual sense. The water will naturally dissipate along with the alchemy process. I will assist from the side with the 'Amighty Crag'!"

The process wasn't complicated. As for being cautious, Li Ximing had a wisp of True Fire guarding his Juque Palace, and if necessary, the flames from his sea of qi could also pour down. Even if it were Purple Mansion spiritual water, it would be burned away. He wasn't afraid of this Demon beast trying any tricks.

"Rest easy, Daoist Friend. First, wait for me to refine the supplementary ingredients."

He lightly tapped the cauldron's body. The lid flew open, and all kinds of supplementary ingredients flew from his sleeve, pouring into the cauldron like a river. The True Fire ignited instantly.

The Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill was, after all, a spiritual pill made from two great medicines. The difficulty was extremely high. Just refining the preliminary ingredients required smelting over three hundred and seventy types, continuing until only a pale golden medicinal liquid remained in the cauldron. Only then did the two golden caskets appear in his palm.

The lids flew open. The first thing that met his eyes was a box of golden clouds.

The clouds were in wisps, drifting and unfixed. They didn't look particularly strange, but the moment they entered his eyes, Li Ximing felt a tremor in his heart, a sudden, impulsive feeling that a great opportunity was right in front of him.

Looking deeper into the golden clouds, all sorts of illusions flickered within—one moment it was the glittering Radiant Sky Stone, the next it was the brilliant, multicolored Immeasurable Water and Fire.

'What a spiritual item!'

Li Ximing used his divine ability to guide the Non-Falling Golden Cloud into the cauldron. As the flames baked it, the spiritual item immediately became agitated, and the illusions within it grew more numerous and precious. But Li Ximing didn't spare them a second glance. He opened the other golden casket. Inside lay a single, glittering spot of light the size of a chicken's heart. The flow of dharma power above it was remarkably similar to Fuxun's!

With that one look, the final piece of the puzzle clicked into place in Li Ximing's mind. Li Zhouwei had told him about the events on Mount Dali, and his own understanding of Bright Yang was not shallow. In that instant, he understood completely.

'The Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat... that must be Fuxun's species. This heart was dug out from his father! He was so happy when he saw me because the sign of Bright Yang on my body directly corresponded to his act of "son devours father"!'

For a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, symbolism was extremely important, especially for someone like Fuxun with a destiny-influencing Life Divine Ability.

Just as he thought, as the heart was brought out, Qingyan, at his side, lowered his gaze slightly. Li Ximing sighed inwardly and placed the heart, heavy as a mountain, into the cauldron. The Eastern Life Flowing Water in his sea of qi immediately began to vaporize. As if divinely inspired, Li Ximing poured his divine ability into the cauldron and began the refinement.

The Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill was different from all the pills he had refined before. This heart was more stubborn than iron or stone. Even with his divine ability and the scorching True Fire, melting it was one thing, but merging it with the other medicinal liquids was another. Li Ximing's divine ability descended, and his body's dharma power poured into the cauldron, ebbing and flowing like the tide.

***

...

Golden Feather Sect, Purple Mist Cave.

Billowing purple mist drifted, flowing over steps of black jade. At the mountain's peak, the talisman fabled to have sealed six paths of Supreme Yang Sun Essence blazed with light, casting a golden-white glow.

It was said this talisman was a high-level item, far beyond the Purple Mansion Realm. The six paths of Supreme Yang Sun Essence were merely sealed within it, using it for nourishment. The talisman's true form was even more mysterious and unfathomable. As for how profound the sigils drawn on it were, that was something only a Golden Core cultivator could possibly know.

A man with golden sleeves embroidered with spiritual flames of shifting sand sat on the lowest step, letting the purple mist drift through his robes. He gazed into the far distance, appearing somewhat melancholic.

To his side stood a broad-shouldered, sturdy man. His eyebrows were arched high, and his eyes held a trace of latent anger as he stood with his hands behind his back.

"Have you seen anything?"

The seated man looked up, revealing a rather dashing and roguish face. It was Daoist Master Tianhuo.

In front of him sat a thin, white porcelain disk, the size of a washbasin. It was covered with a thin layer of golden sand that flowed like water. At the very center of the disk sat a tiny Daoist temple.

The temple was peculiar. Beyond the main hall, there were nine other structures—side halls, chambers, pavilions, and towers—all with yellow tiles and red beams, surrounded by stone steles. All of it was half-buried in the sand, looking like an immortal temple in a desert.

Daoist Master Tianhuo focused his divine ability for a long while before finally speaking.

"There are no traces for now, nor any special omens... Martial Uncle, you are overthinking it."

The sturdy man at his side was, of course, Daoist Master Tianque, known for his explosive temper, who had long been stationed in the Wu State for the Golden Feather Sect. He frowned and snapped,

"Xueyang comes and goes as he pleases. How long are we supposed to be on edge? A Great Daoist Master at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, with a perfected divine ability, is wandering around Jiangnan. Do you know how many people can't sit still?!"

Daoist Master Tianhuo looked somewhat awkward.

"Xueyang doesn't seem like the type to plot in the shadows. And Yao Guanyi wouldn't pressure our sect. He's more afraid of our True Monarch plotting against *them*... Martial Uncle, you worry too much."

In these ancient, long-standing Golden Core powers, there were often huge age gaps within the same generation. Tianque was clearly much older than Tianhuo and his cultivation was higher, but his generational standing in the clan was similar. Though called Martial Uncle, in the clan, they were practically of the same brotherly generation, both having received the 'Tian' Daoist name.

Tianque sighed. "Overthinking? How can I not? That one from Changhuai has already returned. If I'm not mistaken, Suiguan has also left his grotto-heaven. But the True Monarch's whereabouts are still unknown... At a time of such change, it's hard not to worry."

His expression was uneasy. "This is a time of upheaval. Who knows if it won't happen again? The position of Geng Metal is coveted by many. I only worry someone will take advantage of the vacuum."

Tianhuo shook his head and smiled. "The Harmonising and Vault Lock; the world is nothing but Geng-Dui-Xiao. Although the Wandering Metal True Monarch is formidable and one of the few ancient True Monarchs still in existence... he ultimately refuses to enter the mortal world. He and our True Monarch each take what they need... Who would come and plot for the Geng position?"

Despite his optimism, Tianque clearly didn't agree. Just as he was about to speak, Tianhuo cut him off.

"Besides, the 'Nine Gates Temple' has already been refined into a Spiritual Artifact, and the 'Calendar Heart Sand' is powerful. But if Xueyang truly wants to hide, we won't find him. And if he isn't the type to hide and scheme, what's the point of looking for him? Martial Uncle, instead of worrying about him, you should be considering the matter of the Profound Radiance Qi."

Tianque shook his head. "A portion of the Profound Radiance Qi was taken by Suiguan and ended up in Pristine Water's hands. It was different from the amount that was supposed to be delivered. Xueyang said nothing about it, so it was most likely a tacit understanding between Luoxia and Pristine Water."

But Tianhuo smiled. He finally tore his gaze from the temple in the disk and turned to his Martial Uncle, his expression growing uneasy.

"Martial Uncle, do you remember... over a hundred years ago, there was a disturbance in the Purple Mist Smoke? That fragment flared up, showing signs of escaping?"

Tianque frowned. "Of course I remember... I was right there... Hasn't this already been settled by all parties? It was Liu Changdie! That lucky bastard received a calling from the Great Void. You could say he was blessed by fate."

Tianhuo's expression was grave. "Correct... The True Monarch said it was a calling from the 'Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book' within Wanling Heaven, bestowing fortune upon him. This caused our fragment of the monitoring Immortal Artifact to react. Everything that followed also proved that both items were indeed masterless."

"But, let's think about it differently. If the fragment in our hands could be stimulated, doesn't that mean the damaged main body of the Immortal Artifact in Donghua Heaven *must* have also reacted?"

Tianque fell into deep thought. He looked at the younger man.

"Don't forget, the Profound Radiance Qi extracted from this fragment is the only thing that can resonate with the Immortal Artifact. If it made some connection with the outside world this time... The Mansion Lord of the Moonlight Origin Mansion has a good relationship with that Immortal Yingze, the master of the Supreme Yang position. Both hail from Azure Profoundity. The things in that mansion... do you think those few *wouldn't* want them?"

Tianque fell silent. Although he was also at the Purple Mansion Realm, in terms of status, he was far inferior to Tianhuo. The things he knew were naturally incomparable. He hesitated for a long time before asking, "You mean..."

Tianhuo spoke in a low voice. "Don't be fooled by the commotion around Li Qianyuan. The True Monarchs' minds are still on the Immortal Mansion. Although our lord doesn't say it, the fact that the item was allowed to be taken means he also wants to investigate."

"And now, it's even better. The 'Jade True' has been attained, proving that she was truly willing to abandon her Fruition Attainment and leave, not just playing some illusory game. There was no conspiracy. Another obstacle in the way is now gone..."

His expression was faint, revealing a mix of shock and terror. His tone was stunned and cold.

"But who will lead this? Who *dares* to lead this? There's going to be a huge fight! Luoxia isn't stupid. The Mansion Lord back then was rumored to be the reincarnation of an Immortal Lord..."

"Guess... of those few in the heavens... how many of them are terrified right now!"



# Chapter 939: Disciple-Brother

Heaven-Probing Pavilion.

A commotion stirred within the pavilion. Windchimes hanging by the racks tinkled, mixed with the sounds of a scuffle. First came the clang of swords, then a surge of azure clouds, twisting and colliding with a whistling gale.

In the center of the tower, a man in silver robes and a red cloak sat in meditation. His hands formed a seal over his Dantian as he quietly regulated his breath. Hearing the wind rise, he lifted his handsome, rounded face and asked:

"What is all that noise?"

A voice called from outside the door:

"The disciple-brothers are just sparring for fun outside!"

Quan Yuduan smiled and hopped down from his seat. Pushing the door open, he laughed, "Master went to the Eastern Sea for secluded cultivation, and now they decide to raise a racket! So early in the morning, too. They’re disturbing my cultivation!"

The moment the tower door opened, he saw a cultivator in black robes sitting on the steps of the hall. Hearing the door, the man turned, shook out his robes, and stood. He spoke with a hint of resignation:

"These days, one of them is in the north, the other in the south, and they’re always running off to the Eastern Sea. It's been a long time since they last met... They have to fight to find out if they've made any progress or if their cultivation has regressed."

"True enough!"

Quan Yuduan laughed heartily and walked out of the courtyard, crossing the steps in two strides. "Uncle Wushao, it's rare to see you! How has Zhouluo been these past two years?"

Li Wushao folded his arms, a rare smile touching his lips. "Just cultivating, what else? Yunqing needed a suitable spell technique, and I needed to train my movement techniques, so I came to the Heaven-Probing Pavilion... After all, this place has a vast collection. Your Master has accumulated a mountain of merit, and with his status as an Azure Pond Guest Elder, we might as well take advantage of it."

In the years Li Wushao had followed Li Xizhi, he had reaped enormous benefits. Whether it was spiritual items or the spirit pills casually tossed his way, these were things an ordinary Demon beast might not gather in one or two hundred years. Silently, his foundation had become incredibly robust, and he had reached the Peak Foundation Establishment Realm.

Furthermore, the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance he received long ago, combined with numerous spiritual items, had been converted by the Six Dams Matched Life Method into the marvels of the Azure Manifestation Dao to nourish him. Through multiple refinements, his bloodline had grown increasingly pure. It wasn't obvious in the early years, but now, as his cultivation base neared completion, his formidability was becoming more and more apparent.

He rarely took action, however, having spent all these years silently protecting Li Xizhi's descendants. Although Quan Yuduan could sense his profound dharma power, he didn't know Li Wushao's true strength. He pondered inwardly:

'Uncle Wushao may have humble origins, but looking at him now, I fear even an average disciple of the Azure Pond Sect wouldn't be his match...'

For a Demon beast, this was already an extremely high evaluation. To be able to challenge a disciple from an Immortal Sect without being from a noble bloodline... such Demon beasts were likely few and far between, even in Jiangnan.

Looking into the courtyard, he saw Zhao Junwei, cold steel in hand, locked in a fierce battle with his Little Disciple-Brother, Si Xunhui. Sword light and spell arts intertwined, causing the courtyard to flicker between light and shadow.

Although Quan Yuduan was the Eldest Disciple-Brother, his mental fortitude couldn't compare to Zhao Junwei's, and his background was leagues behind that of Si Xunhui. Witnessing the sword techniques and Dao-Profundity of the two, he felt a wave of shame and lowered his head in silence.

Zhao Junwei's disposition and willpower had earned Li Xizhi's greatest approval, but Si Xunhui's own fortitude was not lacking. He was equally hardworking, and with the backing of his aristocratic clan, it was naturally more than Zhao Junwei could match. After fighting for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Zhao Junwei was defeated. He sighed:

"Little Disciple-Brother, your spell arts... they truly live up to Master's reputation!"

Si Xunhui quickly pulled back, shaking his head. "I can't possibly compare to Master! At my cultivation level... he was already fighting for his life on the river, his talent still unknown to the world... _That_ is the true path of concealing one's strength and protecting one's destiny."

The disciple-brothers sat in the hall, chatting eagerly. Zhao Junwei chose to speak of matters in the Eastern Sea. "I just returned from the Crimson Reef Island area, and I heard something unusual. The people from Crimson Reef Island and Thunder-Hearing Island got into a massive, earth-shaking fight over some treasure. They battled until the Dragon-kin intervened to mediate. Nobody knows who ended up with the prize... but... it seems an important direct-lineage member from Thunder-Hearing Island died in that battle... In any case, all pretenses are gone now."

Neither of those families was any good, so the two listened to the news with simple amusement, thinking it a good thing. Quan Yuduan, however, motioned for them to look at him, his expression serious.

"I have some news of my own."

Both looked over. Quan Yuduan lowered his voice. "Do you still remember the Qingsui Peak Master?"

"Of course!"

Si Xunhui was less familiar with him, but Quan Yuduan and Zhao Junwei could never forget the name Yuan Chengzhao. How could they forget this Martial Uncle who had repeatedly tried to harm their Master? Quan Yuduan sneered.

"We all saw him go silent these past few years, not emerging from his seclusion for days on end. Even when the Yuan Clan fell into chaos, it didn't stir him... But a few days ago, Qin Xian seemed to get wind of something. He sent people to adjust the formation and discovered that the cave-abode hadn't been accessed in years... Even the cultivation resources sent over were untouched."

"Oh?"

Their expressions shifted slightly. Quan Yuduan continued his cold laugh, "Qin Xian was worried something had happened to him, so he ordered the manor door forced open. But they found it completely empty!"

"It seems he sealed his manor in secret and slipped away to roam the world at some unknown time!"

This was significant. With Si Boxiu dead, Yuan Chengzhao naturally had reason to be afraid. Even if Li Xizhi said the matter was settled, how could someone who had offended an Immortal Clan ever feel at ease?

Li Wushao, who had been listening, revealed a sarcastic smile and turned away, thinking to himself:

'With Qin Xian and the others watching, the Si Clan had to save some face. They couldn't just discard him after he'd served his purpose. So, they gave him an early chance to get out. As for his ultimate fate... Si Tongyi doesn't have the nerve for that. He most likely just let him go, to fend for himself!'

Li Wushao turned back, preparing to go select his movement techniques. But just then, the quiet discussion of the disciple-brothers drifted over on the breeze, flowing past him.

"Have you two disciple-brothers heard... at the Pristine Merging Owl Pool... there seems to be some... movement!"

This sentence struck Li Wushao like a bolt. The foot he had been lifting over the threshold froze. After a moment's hesitation, he stepped inside, stopping in front of the rows of shelves.

But he didn't close the door, and the disciple-brothers' voices still floated faintly to his ears:

"Eldest Disciple-Brother, your news is always timely... I live overseas, so I don't know the details... What kind of movement?"

Then came the clear, deliberately hushed voice of the youngest, Si Xunhui:

"I heard from my clan's elders... It seems a Great Daoist Master has returned."

The words hit Li Wushao like a peal of thunder, nearly making him lose his composure.

'A Great Daoist Master?!'

'An elder... which elder does the Si Clan even have left?'

"Daoist Master Suiguan!"

Quan Yuduan's shocked voice echoed Li Wushao's inner thoughts. The name clearly struck fear into all of them. This Daoist Master Suiguan had emerged from a Grotto-Heaven, rumored to possess an inhuman demeanor. Forget the people of today; even the Chi Clan of old had regarded him with both suspicion and fear!

The pavilion fell utterly silent. The three disciple-brothers sat clustered around the table. Zhao Junwei sighed and refilled their cups. Quan Yuduan's expression was complicated. "It's him..."

He turned his head slightly, seeming oppressed. "I only heard... that Daoist Master Qiuhu summoned Lin Wuning and Qin Xian... The two showed no change in expression when they came out... I just heard they are reallocating manpower, shrinking the scale of several markets, and increasing the tributes. I didn't hear anything more... Little Disciple-Brother's information is truly formidable."

It wasn't just the two of them; Si Xunhui's own expression was grim.

The Azure Pond Sect was indeed in a troubled era and badly needed someone at the Purple Mansion Realm. Having a Great Daoist Master for backing was naturally a good thing, but Suiguan was no ordinary person! Not only did he have a deep relationship with True Monarch Lushui, but his appearance was ageless, and his divine ability was perfected.

Forget the current Ning Wan... even if Si Boxiu were resurrected, he would have to bow his head obediently before such a figure. And now, Ning Wan had said nothing, nor given any instructions... The implications were terrifying to consider.

Seeing the other two speechless, Si Xunhui spoke in a low tone, "According to the ancient rules of the Azure Pond Sect, all Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who achieve the Dao must walk through the Pristine Speech Heaven once..."

He hesitated for a long time before finally sighing. "And suspended within this Pristine Speech Heaven is an object called the 'Pristine Terrace Heart-Awakening Sword'. For any Purple Mansion cultivator who enters the Grotto-Heaven, this sword will hang above their Shengyang Acupoint and leave a sword imprint within their Shengyang Acupoint Manor."

"This object is mysterious and unfathomable. It is still debated whether it is the Lord's divine ability or some kind of Dharma Treasure..."

He continued, "However... my ancestors always regarded it as a Dharma Treasure. In today's terms, it would be a Golden Core Dharma Treasure, but in ancient times, it was classified as a 'Rank Designation'. Because it originates from the Pristine Water Dao, it is called a 'Pristine Water Rank Designation'."

His Si Clan was an ancient lineage and knew far more than the other two. He spoke with a solemn expression, capturing their full attention. "As for the function of this imprint, others do not know. It is only said that it can protect the soul and prevent others from performing a soul-search. For all these years, Chi Wei, the Three Yuans... all of them have entered..."

Quan Yuduan was silent for a moment before whispering, "I had only ever heard of the Golden Bridge Lock! I never knew of a Heart-Awakening Sword."

Si Xunhui sighed to himself. After this discussion, he felt he had said too much. Feeling uneasy, he quickly tried to cover his tracks, "How could we have known? That genius in the Pristine Speech Heaven is the subject of much envy, and not without reason."

He stopped abruptly and changed the subject, turning back to Quan Yuduan. "Shrinking the market scale and increasing the tributes... what kind of arrangement is that?"

Quan Yuduan shook his head slightly. "I only know about the area I'm responsible for. According to the arrangements from above, for the next six months, the budget and manpower for maintaining the markets, harvesting spiritual items, and ensuring stability within the prefecture will be cut in half. And it might be reduced further in the future..."

"The sect has suffered heavy losses over the years, and our numbers were already low. Now, looking at the new arrangements, the requirements for recruiting disciples have been raised again... Not only will we fail to fill the quotas for each peak, I'm afraid we'll end up with even fewer people!"

Si Xunhui silently committed this to memory. His gaze shifted naturally past Quan Yuduan to the open doorway of the pavilion, where numerous jade talismans tinkled in the wind. He lowered his head and sipped his tea.

---

... The Northern Shore.

Flurries of lingering snow drifted down, mixing with the moonlight on the steps. The main hall atop Cold Cloud Peak was brightly lit. A man in fine-scaled armor, seated in the main seat, slowly opened his eyes.

Li Zhouwei had been cultivating on the Northern Shore for some time, focusing on the Profound Vastness Art. Normally, this art progressed faster in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. However, the Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia had only just left. Unlike others, his situation was precarious. Coupled with the constant changes in the north, he decided to forgo that small advantage and cultivate here instead.

At this moment, his practice of the art concluded. He parted his lips slightly, and a plume of white qi surged from his breath. It morphed into various shapes in the air before being struck by the cold, dissipating without a trace.

'The Profound Vastness Art is difficult, but not so difficult as to be impossible. Now that I can form this plume of white qi, I have officially crossed the threshold!'

He sent his spiritual sense moving, elevating it to the Great Void. Closing his eyes, he looked inward and saw strands of pure, snow-white qi circling his Shengyang Acupoint Manor, supporting it like a cluster of stars orbiting a moon.

This was the "Vastness Pure Qi" produced by the Profound Vastness Art, which could heal the body. He had only formed one portion so far. At his current Dao-Profundity, he could gather three portions at most, with each one taking about a year to form.

The prerequisite for gathering the "Vastness Pure Qi" was a "flawless" body—that is, one free of injury. It didn't require his constant attention like active cultivation. Once the art was mastered, the qi would accumulate automatically. The speed of this accumulation was related to his Dao-Profundity; Pure Qi was naturally the best, followed by the "Twelve Qis".

Bright Yang wasn't the fastest, but it was sufficient. Li Zhouwei silently estimated that three portions might be useful for an ordinary cultivator, but for him, it was a trivial amount, barely enough to heal a minor wound.

'In any case, it accumulates on its own. I just need to cultivate the art and let it be. The sooner I master it, the more time it has to build up. The deeper my comprehension of this cultivation method, the greater its eventual effect.'

He walked out of the hall and saw a robust, white-haired old man approaching from the side. The man bowed and said in a gruff voice, "This subordinate has returned from the Northern Foothills with a reply. The masters of Mount Dali are in seclusion. Although I met several Demon Generals, the date their lords will emerge is unknown. According to Fellow Daoist Lu, it will likely not be a short wait."

The last time the Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia appeared in Lijing Town, a four-eared man in white had appeared. Li Zhouwei had inferred at the time that this must be the Fox Clan expert from Mount Dali with even greater divine abilities. Although the Northern Foothills had always been Fox Clan territory, and it was only proper for them to investigate the appearance of a Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia, Li Zhouwei felt—connecting this to the earlier words of the Demon King Qingyu Qian—that part of the reason was for his sake. Naturally, he had to go and offer his thanks.

'But having a connection is one thing. The Fox Clan will absolutely not get involved in this matter! If I go to pay a visit right after the Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia leaves, the timing will be far too sensitive!'

Therefore, he had dispatched the White Ape to test the waters, under the guise of visiting a friend. As expected, they had long since entered seclusion and would see no one. He understood their position clearly.

"I understand..."

Li Zhouwei was not surprised. He dismissed the White Ape and, stepping into the Great Void, began to ponder. He withdrew a jade slip from his sleeve.

The Great River and Grand Mound Scripture!

The seal on it was now broken. It was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method from the Vast Ocean Daoist Tradition, a full fifth-grade art. It was surely the ultimate legacy of the Chen Clan of Ning State! It also came with various movement techniques and spell arts, all quite profound. Unfortunately, its elemental affinity did not match his.

'Daoist Master Xiao is widely known to cultivate Pit Water. My family has always had ties with the Xiao Clan. I must give him a copy of this. It's just... it's inconvenient for me to go. My Grand-uncle has interacted with him several times. It's best to strike while the iron is hot and have my Grand-uncle make the trip... He is the best person to deliver it.'

But he had only just stepped into the Great Void when his expression suddenly changed. In the physical world, the very earth began to shake, forcing him to step back onto the lake's surface. His golden pupils snapped toward the southeast.

There, the southeastern sky was filled with roiling qi. Thunder boomed, and the wails of ghosts and howls of wolves echoed through the air. A purple rain began to fall from the heavens as Spiritual Qi surged violently, throwing the surrounding spiritual energies into chaos.

'Someone failed their breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm!'

Li Zhouwei knew with a single glance that this person's foundation had been extremely deep. They had likely reached the final step but unexpectedly failed to cross the threshold, perishing in the attempt.

Amidst the falling rain, a mountainous phenomenon of white, wave-like qi was surging into the sky. It was visible from afar, shattering the thick rain clouds as it stood tall above the cloud layer.

The dawn was just beginning to break, casting a golden-yellow hue upon this mountain of clouds.

'Such a vast expanse of purple rain and white peaks! I'm afraid half of Yue State can see this!'

But before he could even marvel at the sight, a massive, pitch-black object suddenly appeared within the misty purple rain, rising slowly but surely.

Pavilions, towers, and halls were all present on this behemoth. Snow-covered pines and cypresses stood tall, winding paths were visible, and cultivators in feathered robes could be seen circling it. It was a scene of bustling activity.

A cry carried from the distance: "A mountain?! What a massive mountain!"

A majestic mountain peak had actually taken to the sky, riding the momentum of the failed breakthrough.

_RUMBLE!_

Only then did Li Zhouwei understand the source of the earlier earthquake.

'Someone is moving a mountain!'

Looking into the distance, countless cultivators flew up from the ground like ants, staring, dumbfounded, at the unprecedentedly massive peak in the sky.

The white qi in the clouds, however, seemed to have spotted something incredibly enticing. It poured down from the sky, attaching itself to the mountain peak and holding the entire structure aloft!

The wind and rain had now stopped. Specks of dirt could be seen falling from afar. The mountain hovered in the air for a brief moment, then, supported by the white qi, it drifted away, vanishing into the heavy layers of mist.

Li Zhouwei stared at the peak ascending into the heavens, his pupils narrowing. A name slowly surfaced in his mind:

"Mount Xianyou!"

# Chapter 940: Adoration

Jiangbei, Tangdao Mountain.

The rain and snow of early spring pattered down, drifting across the mountain's golden peaks before sliding from the eaves of a pavilion. A man in simple monk's robes sat within, one hand resting on a low table as he gazed out into the storm.

Before long, a youth emerged, walking untouched through the deluge.

The young man wore a tall, white gauze cap and a Daoist robe—white with gold trim, exquisitely embroidered with mystic-patterned black clouds. Two purple silk tassels hung from his waist. He had the handsome features of a youth, yet carried himself with an air of easy magnanimity. Arriving before the pavilion, he smiled brightly.

"Greetings, Abbot Fachang!"

The monk in the pavilion was none other than Maha Fachang, dispatched by the Great Adoration Dharma Realm to stand guard over Jiangbei.

When Fachang saw him, he immediately rose to greet him, a wide smile on his face.

"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qi! Your Great Void movement technique is astonishingly fast. That was no short journey!"

He quickly gathered his inner robes, revealing white, tightly-bound trousers, and hurried down the steps to stand at the youth's side, gesturing him in. The youth, however, just smiled.

"It was just a simple movement art."

The young man entered, completed the requisite courtesies, and took a seat without fanfare. Maha Fachang, in contrast, seemed to defer to him, taking the adjacent seat to pour tea. He spoke with obvious pleasure:

"In the blink of an eye, several years have passed. How has Daoist Master Qi's cultivation on the mountain been?"

This Daoist Master clearly hailed from a significant background, for he accepted the monk's deferential attitude as perfectly natural. He replied,

"I've made some gains... But rather, congratulations are in order for your Great Adoration Dharma Realm. Your disciple-brother welcomed that honored status back to the mountain, secretly conforming to the Daoist Tradition. With his latest progress, I fear even I might soon be no match for him!"

At the mention of this, Maha Fachang's expression turned awkward. Though it was a joyous event, he found it difficult to speak of. He lowered his voice.

"His cultivation has indeed advanced... but in my view... it may not be a good thing. He is, after all, the Emperor of Wei. Bearing such karma is like a child swinging a sledgehammer. If one day he can't hold on and it slips from his grasp... he might very well be destroyed by it!"

The youth sneered, though a flicker of solemn agreement passed through his eyes. He clearly felt the same but knew the matter was too sensitive to discuss openly. He sighed, "There is a reason why a genius like you has stumbled and struggled in your cultivation... Some things cannot be spoken of lightly!"

Both knew not to dwell on the topic. The youth quickly changed the subject.

"I glanced over just now. I saw purple rain and falling feathers. Was there a soaring phenomenon in the south?"

Maha Fachang quickly replied:

"Indeed. But strangely, there was no malignant energy. It wasn't the Bound Earth Moving Technique, nor was it the Capital Guard's mountain god soaring method... My subordinates report... the mountain was Mount Xianyou, Xiao Chuting's clan."

"I know!"

The youth lifted his leg, and the mystic-patterned black clouds on his robe seemed to shimmer with spiritual light. He looked intrigued.

"He went to the Northern Sea, borrowing the power of Pit Water. Daoist Master Ji'an couldn't remain either and gave him Mount Pai'er. But Mount Pai'er is too small. It's fine for immortal seclusion, but not for raising a clan. He needed another mountain!"

Hearing this, Maha Fachang frowned in confusion.

"Jiangnan is an immense distance from the Northern Sea! It would likely take a Great Daoist Master from the Bound Earth Daoist Tradition to move a mountain that far. Xiao Chuting was right not to use Bound Earth; he would have had to use the Capital Guard's soaring technique."

"But that's what I don't understand... He cultivates Pit Water..."

Before he could finish, the youth waved his hand, took a sip of tea, and smiled.

"Bai Ziyu came to the Profound Governance Pavilion. I've met him. He also cultivates the Capital Guard... That Capital immortals Dao territory right next to yours belongs to him. I made a point to ask..."

"This Xiao Chuting has a junior named Xiao Yongling. He cultivates the 'Eastern Feather Mountain' aspect of the Capital Guard dao—it's the conceptual soaring mountain of the Dao-art. The Xiao family poured all their resources into helping him break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. This was all part of the plan."

"Mount Xianyou is a major mountain, after all. Even a single one of its peaks is a considerable mountain in Jiangnan. And it was so far away... He first borrowed a Spiritual Artifact, but it still wasn't enough. He needed another boost. I saw he had formations prepared on the mountain long ago, just waiting for this opportune moment!"

Maha Fachang needed to hear no more. His earlier suspicions were confirmed, and he nodded.

"I understand... If this Xiao Yongling succeeds, the 'Eastern Feather Mountain' soaring phenomenon from his advancement to the Purple Mansion Realm and the refinement of his divine ability would combine, helping to lift the peak... And if he failed, the phenomenon of his failure, of his body returning to the world, could also have been used."

"Exactly. That was his scheme."

The youthful Daoist Master Qi laughed heartily.

"A brilliant move! I saw he was prepared long ago, but I never expected that Xiao Yongling to have such a deep foundation. He fought one battle after another and, against all odds, actually managed to hang on... According to Xiao Chuting's original plan, he probably should have initiated the event during the great battle!"

"In the end, it dragged on until now, and he got drawn in a bit deeper than he wanted. But at last, the dust has settled, and his plan has succeeded."

Maha Fachang shook his head.

"It's only natural he planned this far ahead. Xiao Chuting was a late bloomer. Even though he had fortuitous encounters and secret arts, allowing his divine ability to progress rapidly, how much of his lifespan can possibly be left? The Xiao family has no other outstanding heirs, and even if they did, it's no longer convenient for them to remain in Jiangnan."

Daoist Master Qi chuckled, steering the conversation away. "But this Daoist Master Yehui, Bai Ziyu... he's truly a fascinating man. He has a brilliant and magnanimous mind. My lord spoke with him for a while and came away deeply impressed! It's incredible. First, there was Changxiao, and now him. To think that rogue cultivators can consistently produce talent like this..."

He turned his head, his smile fading slightly.

"How is Jiangbei?"

Maha Fachang pressed his palms together. His simple, unadorned robes stood in stark contrast to the Daoist Master's opulent attire. His eyes held a trace of helplessness as he spoke in a low voice.

"It has been pacified. There are no major conflicts. However, that White Qilin by the river... I have yet to see it. The aura of the Undefeated King of Brightness is still potent in the area. Logically... the Undefeated King of Brightness only attained his wondrous state by being a direct blood descendant of the Emperor of Wei who joined the Buddhists. He should be inferior to the Qilin."

Daoist Master Qi's expression was neutral.

"The Undefeated King of Brightness..."

His tone held a trace of disdain, but it was, after all, a revered ancestor from the monk's own Daoist Tradition. He couldn't say more. He simply bowed his head to sip his tea, offering no further comment.

Maha Fachang did not fail to notice. He, too, silently lowered his gaze and changed the subject.

"It's just... the Yan Kingdom is still applying pressure, demanding we make a move... They've sent people over."

Daoist Master Qi shook his head with a small smile.

"It's Murong Yan and Shilou Yingge."

This news seemed to differ from what the monk had heard. His eyes widened slightly.

"The Valiant King just left, so why is another member of the Gao family here? And that Helian Wujiang is, frankly, just the Tiefu King. Now two royal families are present... What's next? Are they going to call King Chen and King Dai over as well?"

"It's good news, not a mediation... The Gao family has produced a genius, Gao Fangjing. He has already reached the Purple Mansion Realm, so they have the strength to spare someone else to come down."

The monk could only nod at this, though his expression remained joyless. Daoist Master Qi seemed to understand his apprehension and smiled.

"In all these years... it's not as if people haven't crossed the river between north and south. What is there to fear? Cultivators from the south have been crossing the river for years, and no one ever seemed afraid."

"Or is it that only the southern Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is permitted to cross the river, while the various Daos of the north are forbidden from going south? The key isn't who crosses, monk. You're looking at it all wrong!"

He leaned to the side, a grin playing on his lips.

"If they truly didn't want the north to cross, things never would have developed to this point. As long as no one goes too far, a duel of techniques, or even a few large-scale battles, is perfectly fine."

But despite his words, it was clear the northern powers were all nervous. Maha Fachang's expression flickered with a low melancholy. He seemed to be listening intently, yet also seemed as if he were merely waiting for a required promise.

He intoned, "This humble monk understands... Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for coming down from the north to dispel my confusion... Otherwise, with my dull aptitude, who knows how many days it would have taken me to comprehend."

"Dull?"

Daoist Master Qi looked amused.

"I think you're just afraid of creating killing-karma... Sometimes I have to wonder, are Beigu and Yeren the ones from the Liao River... or are you?"

Maha Fachang bowed his head slightly.

"I would not dare compare myself to the high cultivators of the Northern Revered One Dao. But when I accepted this duty, I knew this journey would require me to create immeasurable killing-karma!"

He hailed from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, which was one of the most reputable sects among the northern Buddhists. They believed that this present world was the Buddhist Land, and one need not seek it in a life to come. Whether they were cultivators or believers, they all actively participated in reforming the mortal world, striving to make it resemble the pure lands described in the scriptures.

It was precisely because of this Dao that the Great Adoration Dharma Realm was the subject of much criticism among its peers. Many believed they blasphemed the sacred classics. Holding this position, Maha Fachang naturally endured immense pressure.

But if it were not for this, why would Qi Lanyan of the Viewing Pavilion faction be willing to call him 'Fellow Daoist'? The young man now smiled.

"Monk, since you knew you would create killing-karma, why walk this path? Why needlessly give yourself a mental obstacle?"

Maha Fachang let out a long, quiet sigh.

"This region... it must have a Buddhist cultivator presiding over it. If it were any of the other sects, who knows how cruel their methods would be! They would simply use their heretical arts, absorb all these common people into their Belly Buddhist Land, and refine them into their divine abilities... Only by coming myself can I ensure this place has some measure of peace."

"If I did not come... that is when I would truly have cause for regret."

...

"Mount Xianyou has left Jiangnan."

Amid hurried voices, several cultivators landed on the mountain peak. Li Jiangqian led two people all the way to the summit before entering the main hall alone. He bowed.

"Father... someone from the Xiao family is here."

The man seated above opened his eyes.

It had only been a few hours since Mount Xianyou had soared away, but the entire lake region was in an uproar. It was no small mountain, and its departure had been spectacular. No one knew where it had landed, only that it was certainly outside of Jiangnan, which inevitably sparked all manner of speculation.

Li Zhouwei had known from the moment he heard the news that the Xiao family would send someone. He said simply, "Let them come up."

After a short wait, a man entered the hall. He was tall and thin, with a rather dashing appearance. The Xiao family had kept their mountain sealed for many years, remaining aloof and safe from the various storms. As such, their direct descendants were no longer widely recognized. The man bowed politely in the hall.

"Junior Xiao Congyu pays his respects to Daoist Master Minghuang!"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"There is no need for such courtesy."

Xiao Congyu straightened up and spoke respectfully.

"The matter of the mountain's soaring was of utmost importance, which is why the Daoist Master never revealed it... Even the many clan brothers and elders on the mountain were unaware. Only the Daoist Master and the Family Head knew... Now that the mountain has been uprooted, the Daoist Master is occupied with many tasks. I have come this time to bid farewell."

"My Xiao family has already relocated to Cangzhou in the Northern Sea..."

The celestial phenomenon had not yet faded from the sky, but the man was already at his door. He had clearly set out at the first possible moment. Li Zhouwei looked at the man kneeling in the hall, a trace of pity in his heart.

Xiao Chuting was a man who prioritized self-preservation. In his early years, the spiritual energies of Jiangnan had required his intervention, forcing him to stay. Later, once he found breathing room between the two major sects, he immediately sealed his mountain, gradually abandoning his surrounding interests. His plot to escape Jiangnan was clearly not a plan of one or two years.

This outcome wasn't surprising; if anything, it was overdue. Li Zhouwei simply said:

"Our two families have been on good terms for many years. My great-uncle, in particular, admires the Daoist Master greatly. He has often spoken of his wish to pay his respects, and has mentioned it to me several times, but the Daoist Master's movements were always uncertain, and a meeting never materialized."

Li Zhouwei never wanted to drag others into his own affairs. He only hoped that these allies of the Li family might, in the future, offer some protection to his kin. Thus, his words were focused entirely on Li Ximing.

"When my great-uncle travels to Cangzhou in the Northern Sea to pay his respects... I hope the Daoist Master will be able to see him."

Xiao Congyu immediately kowtowed, his voice filled with respect.

"My Daoist Master mentioned this... He is also deeply concerned for Daoist Master Zhaojing. From this day forward, our sect will be located at Mount Pai'er, in Pit North Prefecture, Cangzhou, Northern Sea. If the Daoist Master has any request, he may visit at any time."

Li Zhouwei nodded and gestured with his hand.

"I must remain here to guard the lake. It will most likely be Daoist Master Zhaojing who visits. The Immortal Clan has moved to a new home; he will certainly go to offer his congratulations and a gift."

The Xiao family member said no more. Seeing Li Zhouwei's dismissive gesture, he quickly took his leave. Li Jiangqian, who had escorted the man out, returned and said in a low voice:

"Father... The Xiao clan was in seclusion for many years and made their preparations long ago. They formed no new marriage alliances... They took all the direct relatives and blood kin they could, and all who could leave, left..."

He lowered his gaze.

"In your son's view, the Xiao family's departure has no real impact on the larger situation... That Daoist Master was never going to involve himself with any faction. Even if he had stayed, when the north caused trouble... he would not have been implicated or offended."

The man in the crimson robe narrowed his eyes slightly.

"He chose to leave now, while there is still a measure of gratitude for the help he just rendered... It was the perfect time."

Li Zhouwei gestured that he understood. "He could only leave," he said softly, "precisely because his departure has no impact on the larger situation."

The golden-eyed man rose from the main seat, descended the steps, and paced to the front of the hall. His expression was serene. In the dimming light of the sky, his golden eyes seemed exceptionally bright.

From this vantage point, he could just see the roiling mists of power across the river. Plumes of brilliant radiance mixed with clouds of multicolored light were rising from the north. Dense swarms of human figures emerged from within those clouds.

Those golden pupils reflected the scene in the sky. Neither the clouds nor the spiritual mists could obstruct his vision, which pierced the veil to reveal every black shadow and golden body moving within.

"Put that aside... Inform the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Someone is crossing the river."

# Chapter 941: Murong

The Great River surged. On the north bank, brilliant radiance shone where rows of monks stood in silence. Within the clouds, golden bodies flickered, their forms and features varied. They appeared and vanished in the sky, staggered according to their cultivation and rank.

At the very zenith, a mass of crimson True Fire gushed endlessly, converging into a long arch bridge. Spiritual fire ascended, climbing the sides of the arch, and coalesced at its apex into a pavilion. This structure, set upon the bridge's tower, had six corners and was wreathed in roiling, crimson flames.

A long-faced man in golden robes sat within the pavilion, leaning against a low table. His hands were clasped, his right loosely holding a pair of jade chopsticks, which he used to poke and turn over the four small dishes on the table.

Kneeling on both sides of the arch bridge were armored soldiers. They were not living beings, but figures sustained purely by blazing fire—like spectral suits of fiery armor suspended in mid-air. Their golden, burning eyes, hidden beneath the helms, gave off a sinister air.

After a short wait, a figure approached from the mountains. He was a mountain of a man, built like a barrel, with a wild, tangled beard covering a face whose cheeks were a dark, purplish-black. He strode in without ceremony and plopped down directly opposite the long-faced man.

He flicked his thick, sausage-like fingers, materializing a pair of silver chopsticks, and immediately began snatching food from the dishes. The long-faced man’s expression soured. He slapped his own chopsticks down with a clack and cursed.

"Such barbarian habits!"

"What?"

The thick-waisted brute shot him a glare.

"Are you not a barbarian? Or am I not a barbarian?"

This retort shut the thin-faced man up. He let out a sharp "Heh," and replied:

"We are masters of the Central Plains now. The Murong family has no shortage of handsome men, so how did it produce an uncouth lout like you, Murong Yan! What a waste of a name. Coming down south here, you're just giving people ammunition to talk... bringing up the Northern Barbarian past."

The burly man sneered.

"Jiangnan is half the mainland. It wasn't necessarily worse than the north back in the day. You Central Plains folk are so quick to call them 'Southern Barbarians,' but did anyone make a peep when True Monarch Shangyuan 'toured the north,' or when Duanmu Kui was acting the tyrant? Even Jiang Boqing dared to toy with a King-Marquis. You talk about decorum?"

Shangyuan was now a True Monarch, so even when arguing, they had to refer to his past actions delicately as a "northern tour." They were far less polite about Duanmu Kui. But bickering was just their way; they were clearly old friends. Murong Yan snagged two more bites of food and said:

"White Qilin is just across the river. Daoist Friend Yingge, if you're too concerned with 'face,' or if you're scared, just let me go test him again."

"It's not that I'm afraid of him."

Shilou Yingge's eyes narrowed slightly. He refused to be baited by the taunt, his tone level.

"Bright Yang is a dao that favors the strong and venerates power—the strong get stronger, the weak get weaker. Even if he hasn't mastered all five Dharmas, if he's even touched upon the Purple Mystery and gained a hint of true mastery, forget me. Even Qi Lanyan would have to be cautious."

"But as he is now... he just broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, his life-mandate is incomplete. In the end, he's just an initial-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with a few tricks. You alone would be more than enough to overwhelm him, let alone the two of us."

Murong Yan roared with laughter, his fleshy cheeks bunching up.

"Your calculations are sound. When I first heard about him, I was dismissive. So what if he's 'blessed by fate'? The Bright Yang dao is in tatters; how much of a blessing could he really have? It's not like having 'fate' on your side means you don't need to train in secret arts or cultivation methods. The Wei Emperor didn't conquer the world relying on fate. Back in the day, few of the Wei crown princes could truly suppress their peers, to say nothing of now."

"It was only when I heard that the prodigy from the Tiefu Kingdom, Helian Wumeng, had fought him recently. Apparently, even when White Qilin was unarmed and without a Spiritual Artifact, Helian Wumeng couldn't easily defeat him. That's when I started to take him seriously."

He, Murong Yan, was also a prodigy of the Murong family. The north was vast, far more populous than the south, a gathering place for royal clans, imperial descendants, and immortal heirs. They intermarried, spreading powerful bloodlines far and wide. To fight his way out of such a crowd and achieve the Purple Mansion Realm made him a first-class figure in his own right.

More importantly, the northern Daoist traditions held the rich legacies left behind by the many fallen celestial dynasties, immortal sects, and immortal gates of old. Whether in spiritual objects or bloodlines, how could they be compared to the disciples the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had scraped together after fleeing south to develop the barbarian lands? If not for the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's origins from Green Pine Temple, which allowed them to acquire a few Dharma Treasures and Spiritual Treasures through ancestral connections, and if the north wasn't so internally divided, this whole conflict wouldn't have dragged on for so many years.

In all the years of conflict between north and south, it had, frankly, only ever been a few Buddhist cultivators acting on their own, heading south when they saw an opportunity. There had rarely been a full-scale Purple Mansion Realm war. They mostly used local rogue cultivators for manpower, yet that alone had been enough to force almost all the Daoist traditions in the Yue State to unite. The disparity in strength was already immense...

'Aside from the Jade True Monarch, Duanmu Kui, and those other inhuman exceptions... the Three Yuans, Two Purples were passable. But as for today... the south has no one worth a second glance!'

Shilou Yingge stopped toying with his chopsticks and poured himself a drink.

"Helian Wumeng is a prodigy, but he is similarly unfledged. The day he steps over the immortal threshold, dons the Ying-Copper Armor of Great Xia, wields the Bulwark of Ten Thousand Cities, and swallows the Iron Edict Elixir refined by Helian Fan, I fear only the young master of the Touba family could compare. At that point, you and I... we will both be his inferiors."

This made Murong Yan's eyes go wide, but the reputation of those Spiritual Treasures was too great. With that said, he couldn't find a retort. He could only narrow his eyes, his fierce look fading as he said coldly:

"His ancestors were magnificent, but his line is now in decline. He just doesn't have any other prodigies of his generation to compete with for spiritual items. If all the treasures of my Murong family were given to one person, who could possibly stand against them?"

"That's a meaningless comparison!"

Shilou Yingge shook his head.

"If you're going to argue like that, why not complain that you were born into the Murong family instead of the hovel of a commoner or a tenant farmer? Besides, your Murong family's current glory is entirely thanks to the grace of Emperor Xuan. You can't compare your situation to his at all!"

His Murong family was one of the greatest beneficiaries among the Northern Barbarian. They had lost to the Fuqi family in the war for the Celestial Dynasty and were in a precarious position, completely lost during the Turmoil of the Three Teachings. Fortunately, the Mandate of Heaven was revived, and Emperor Xuan of Yan, Murong Jie, emerged.

This emperor took command in a time of crisis. He first used military force to suppress the Three Teachings, then issued an edict:

"The Buddhists, who follow the gradual path of cultivation and realization, walk a Great Dao. The Demonic preserve their nature and practice their arts... The Immortal, who cultivate the methods of divine ability to return to the origin, also shall not lose their venerable status."

This edict, known as the Imperial Edict of Central Xuan, redefined the Immortal and Demonic paths not as Daoist traditions, but as advanced spell arts. Only Buddhist cultivators were practicing the "true path of cultivation," and they turned to worship the Way of Compassion.

From then on, the order of the Daoist traditions in the Yan Kingdom was clear. Those with high talent cultivated the Immortal or Demonic paths. When their lifespan was exhausted, if they possessed sufficient divine ability, they could convert to the Way of Compassion. Although this didn't guarantee success every time, the gains were significant, and the accumulated experience grew ever richer.

Once the Buddhist Dao became a viable path for Purple Mansion Realm and Diverse Mansion cultivators, the internal conflicts rapidly eased. After all, no matter how demanding it was, no one minded having one last escape route when all else failed. The Way of Compassion also adopted the doctrine of "a stomach big enough to tolerate all," fostering mutual benefit. From that point, it grew uncontrollably. The Buddhist Land expanded at an astonishing rate, and its path developed unique wonders, distinct from other Buddhist cultivators, seemingly vying for supremacy among the Seven Aspects.

Although this over-expansion led to fierce competition within the Buddhist Land—making it less stable than the other six Aspects, whose positions rarely changed in a century—the Murong family had turned disaster into fortune. They had climbed step by step to the peak and now had deep foundations in all three paths: Demonic, Buddhist, and Immortal. The Demonic and Buddhist paths, in particular, complemented each other perfectly. Murong Yan naturally had the right to be arrogant.

He changed the subject.

"Helian Wumeng was deep in enemy territory; he definitely wouldn't use his full strength. His Tiefu Kingdom ranks last among the King-Marquis clans; he doesn't dare act rashly. As I said, he's unfledged. A draw is normal."

"You, however, have no such worries. It's the perfect time for you to fight him! Your divine abilities are more numerous than his, and you have more Spiritual Artifacts. I hear he doesn't even have a decent weapon. Just be careful... the situation is unclear. We are here to probe. Don't develop any killing intent, and don't pursue too deeply."

He continued in a low, haunting tone:

"Helian Wumeng has already reached Xuanmiao Temple. From there, he is probing that... Zhu Gong. Let's not even mention her injuries; even at full strength, she can't gain any advantage against Helian Wumeng. Yi Shu... Tinglan will definitely go."

At the mention of Daoist Master Tinglan, his gaze grew complicated. After all, she was also from Qi, and they had known each other in their youth. But his expression quickly smoothed over as he replied:

"Even so, I will remain here to support you and prevent the remnants of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition from trying any tricks."

Murong Yan's expression was unchanged. He nodded.

"The armies of the other Dao paths have not yet arrived. We are just testing the waters."

He dissolved into demonic smoke and vanished, leaving Shilou Yingge sitting alone in the pavilion, his expression gradually becoming placid.

'Luoxia is acting completely hands-off. Their attitude is truly ambiguous... Murong Yan claims the Wu Light Daoist tradition simply doesn't want to be drawn in, but... it looks more like disdain.'

'And the north... our interests are a tangled, chaotic mess. Even when a consensus is reached, there's always room to maneuver. The various powers have different attitudes toward Li Qianyuan. Some are aggressive, some conciliatory, one party is even vaguely sympathetic... But delaying the Wei Emperor's fall is something everyone secretly agrees on... If the Wu Light Daoist tradition refuses to get involved, the other families won't stop at just extracting benefits...'

He raised his cup, showing no particular animosity toward the Li family across the river, nor any of the rumored insistence on restoring his Shi-Lou clan. All his actions seemed to be mere political posturing. Only a deep, cold indifference remained in his eyes.

'The Great King doesn't care... but I must. The Gao family's future is in our hands. Even the Cui family is playing it safe now. If we stubbornly cling to this so-called 'ancestral debt of gratitude,' it will surely push my Gao family into the abyss...'

'My family already lost once during the chaos at the end of the Liang... All we have left is a veneer of respectability. If we lose again... the Gao clan will cease to exist!'

...

The Great River.

Sinister demonic qi surged into the air, transforming into gusts of frigid wind. The barrel-chested brute materialized. He paused for just a moment as the demonic qi shifted, becoming plates of gleaming, bright armor that affixed themselves to his body.

But his expression held none of the excitement of an impending battle. The eyes nestled in his fleshy face showed none of their earlier impudence or recklessness. They were as calm as water, filled with meticulous calculation.

'Such a rare, perfect opportunity...'

He stood suspended above the river, billowing demonic qi mixing with a colorless, hazy radiance that swirled around him. It shot into the sky, rapidly staining the northern horizon a pale, ashen gray.

A heaven-shaking roar rose from below, but Murong Yan's gaze was fixed dead ahead.

In almost the same instant, a man clad in golden scale armor, with the Radiant Sun King's Halberd hanging at his waist, appeared on a high cliff overlooking the river. He stared across the distance, his pair of golden pupils stabbing forward like daggers, drawing a distinct smile from Murong Yan.

The demonic smoke on the riverbank billowed higher. Without a word, he slowly raised his hand and drew a long weapon from the Great Void.

The object resembled a sword, but its hilt, shaped like an iron dragon's open mouth, was attached to a solid, rounded iron shaft. The shaft was segmented, like bones joined together, and at four feet, it was a good deal longer than a typical sword.

He waited only a moment before his figure vanished. The rolling demonic smoke on the riverbank swelled in response, surging forward like a tide as his thunderous voice exploded in mid-air:

"Murong Yan of the Yan Kingdom has come to seek instruction!"

Simultaneously, an invisible, misty water gathered rapidly, casting a vast, shimmering curtain of light across the sky that flickered in and out of view.

Divine Ability: Sunless Deceit!

Murong Yan was no benevolent fool. Even though he estimated his opponent was no match for him, and that he himself possessed an extra divine ability, he had no intention of being polite when he wasn't absolutely certain of crushing him. The moment his Spiritual Artifact flew, his powerful divine ability enveloped the area.

The light between heaven and earth dimmed instantly. On both riverbanks, the assembled forces looked up, confused. The sun was clearly high in the sky, a brilliant Supreme Yang, yet its piercing rays could no longer reach the ground. A dull gloom fell over both shores.

This gloom was not true darkness. Though gray and hazy, everything was still visible, but all colors had become dull and lifeless.

Only the pair of golden eyes on the cliff remained bright.

Li Zhouwei, trapped within the divine ability, felt its effects most keenly. The instant his opponent struck with full force, the rushing water vapor told him everything:

'Valley Water... This is a Valley Water divine ability.'

In the heavy gloom, all the divine abilities and dharma power within Li Zhouwei's body grew sluggish. Valley Water was a Dao that manifested in the world, and his opponent was a direct-line Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Murong family. This divine ability was a preemptive strike, designed to seal his power and seize the initiative!

The golden-eyed man was a fraction of a second too slow in summoning his own divine ability. Murong Yan's Spiritual Artifact was already upon him. The bizarre iron weapon, trailing thick demonic smoke, rushed his face. Li Zhouwei only had time to twist his body and take a single step back.

Murong Yan was not surprised. His "Sunless Deceit" was designed to gain the upper hand, and its effects only grew stronger as his opponent fell into his rhythm!

His Spiritual Artifact had not missed, merely been deflected. But Li Zhouwei wasn't the only one who had bought time; Murong Yan's free hand was already forming hand seals for a spell art!

In that same instant, however, Li Zhouwei halted his retreat. He thrust his hand forward, a large palm piercing the roiling demonic wind, fast as lightning, snatching directly for Murong Yan's throat.

'How arrogant! I have a demonic cultivator's body; I'm not afraid to trade injuries with you!'

A light flashed in Murong Yan's eyes. He aborted the Dharma Art and met the attack with his own palm, pushing his divine ability even harder. But the man before him had already raised his other hand, blocking the incoming Spiritual Artifact with his forearm. Brilliant radiance shone from within his sleeve armor, revealing an inconspicuous golden ring on his wrist.

He wasn't using a Spiritual Treasure—he was meeting the attack with the physical body of the Pure Yang Bracelets!

"Clang!"

A dull clang rang out as the weapons collided. A spark of radiance erupted. Provoked, the Spiritual Treasure released a blinding light, and the suffocating gloom was instantly vanquished. The frozen Heavenly Light finally began to flow again.

Li Zhouwei's figure dispersed and reformed, now at point-blank range. The demonic winds buffeting him dissipated on contact with his dharma body. A bright radiance had lit up between his brows.

But Murong Yan didn't pause, nor did he show any surprise. He stared directly into those golden eyes as the demonic wind howled around his face. A hissing sound emerged from his lips, and something alien could be seen stirring within his mouth.

'Edict!'

# Chapter 942: The Valley Water Dao

The moment he opened his mouth, a whistling wind rose from the pitch-black void within. Shadowy forms coiled like serpents, accompanied by the faint _drip, drip, drip_ of water. The ambient light in the sky dimmed once more, eclipsed by the deepening abyss of his maw.

But those golden eyes weren't the only things illuminating the heavens. A brilliant light flared to life between Li Zhouwei's brows!

**[Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light]**

Murong Yan's Spiritual Artifact had struck the Pure Yang Bracelets, its power neutralized. After a fractional delay, Li Zhouwei's divine ability flared in response. His power surged to the point between his brows as he instantly activated Concealed Plunder Gold to augment his attack—the most profound Bright Yang spell art he had mastered since he began his cultivation!

A resplendent golden radiance erupted, forming an inverted, cone-shaped halo of divine ability at his brow. It expanded to the size of a large basin before solidifying into a massive golden pillar of light that blasted downward.

Murong Yan was ready. His eyes shifted to a pure, violet-black. His mouth swelled instantly, tearing open from ear to ear. Refusing nothing, he lunged forward and swallowed the entirety of the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

The violet-black energy swirling within his mouth spun like a deep-sea vortex, constantly interfering with the radiance blasting from his opponent's brow, attempting to twist it, shatter it, and break the casting.

"Boom!"

In an instant, the cultivators stationed on the riverbanks threw up their hands to shield their eyes, their faces awash in blinding light. The sky was split in two, as if by a knife's edge: one half blazed with brilliant radiance, the other was plunged into starless dark, a division that stretched far along the river.

"Omm..."

The intense glare faded as quickly as it came. All eyes on both banks immediately locked onto the incomparably brilliant pillar of light in the sky. The iridescent glow from Li Zhouwei's brow was incredibly stable, pulsing steadily as it resisted the torsional force from his opponent's maw, demonstrating an exceptionally high degree of control over his Dao arts!

Yet Murong Yan neither dodged nor retreated. His cavernous mouth, like a bottomless pit, continued to devour every last ray of the incoming light.

Thick, bright light and fire began to overflow, streaming from the corners of his torn mouth. They trailed behind him like two long, silken waterfalls before breaking apart into a meteor shower of fire that rained down upon the earth.

These two cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm... in their very first exchange, they were already locked in a direct contest of divine abilities and dharma power!

The cultivators on both banks held their breath in unison. Even the man on the distant, flame-arched bridge abruptly rose to his feet, his gaze fixed on the sky.

"Bang! ...Omm..."

A violent, searing sound echoed through the air. Li Zhouwei's entire face was illuminated by the radiance blazing from his brow, yet his golden eyes remained sharp and clear. They grew steadily brighter, his pupils shifting from a dark, antique gold to a brilliant, living gold.

As he poured more of his divine ability into the attack, the pillar of light at his brow expanded, swelling in size and power!

A grating, ear-piercing screech filled the air. Though the fiend in mid-air, wreathed in roiling grey smoke, remained expressionless, his burly form was being forcibly pushed backward, inch by inch, as he struggled to dissipate the surging radiance of the divine ability.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was only a fourth-grade spell art, but with the augmentation from Concealed Plunder Gold, it was already comparable to an average fifth-grade art. Furthermore, Li Zhouwei had cultivated it for many years.

More critically, Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was, at its core, an art of Bright Yang radiance. Its power _increased_ in a direct confrontation. As the stalemate continued, the might of the spell art was still climbing, moment by moment!

Murong Yan's own arts were clearly profound, as he still appeared to have energy in reserve. But how could he simply watch as his opponent's divine ability climbed to new heights? He allowed the force to push him back a yard or so, a controlled retreat to help dissipate the power, while his eyes abruptly blazed with a new light.

But Li Zhouwei had already acted. His arms relaxed, extending straight out to his sides, his fingers splayed. In the center of each palm, a lustrous, silk-like golden light shimmered into existence.

**[Radiant Celestial Wave Art]**!

The silken strands shot out like agile serpents, coiling around Murong Yan's body and binding him fast, dragging him closer. Simultaneously, Li Zhouwei's own divine ability surged to its absolute peak. A faint, ethereal celestial gate even began to manifest behind him as he pushed Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light to its very limit!

Murong Yan's expression finally shifted. A torrent of demonic qi erupted from his body, coalescing into silver, viper-scale armor that covered him in an instant. It was a suit of spiritual clothing!

'A spirit embryo...'

The Radiant Celestial Wave Art was not a high-grade art to begin with. Faced with the wondrous vibrations of a spirit embryo, Li Zhouwei's hastily-formed attack couldn't hold. In an instant, the golden silks shattered into glittering motes of light and dissipated.

'What a pity...'

A flash of regret crossed Li Zhouwei's eyes. The fiend had finally gained a moment's respite. A silver arc of light flared, blocking the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. It vanished as quickly as it appeared, exploding with a deafening thunderclap. In that instant, the Heavenly Light and purple flames surged forward, pushing the dividing line between the two celestial phenomena several feet further, casting the bright radiance all the way out over the great river.

But Murong Yan himself had vanished.

"Whoosh!"

An instant later, a chorus of whistles filled the air. Vaguely, a phantom maw opened somewhere along the riverbank. From it erupted a shower of crimson-red, dazzlingly bright meteors, all tinged with the color of Bright Yang! In a flash, they became a deluge raining down from the heavens.

'What a formidable spell art!'

This rain of light was none other than the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light that Murong Yan had just swallowed. He had somehow converted the spell art, turning it into a sky-filling deluge of radiance and roiling flames that illuminated everything.

On both banks, cultivators and monks alike paled and scrambled for cover. Li Zhouwei, however, remained motionless on the mountainside, letting the shower of fiery light streak past him. He simply raised one hand, palm up. A speck of brilliant gold, mixed with an inky black flame, rose swiftly in his palm. From nothing, it began to coalesce, bit by bit, into a long halberd the color of the Golden Crow.

"Huu..."

Li Zhouwei flexed his long, powerful arm. He spun the newly-formed halberd, its tip pointing diagonally toward the ground, as he fixed his gaze on his opponent, who had reappeared in the distance.

'This is certainly an awkward time.' His primary weapon was currently being refined at the Viewing Pavilion Platform. Even with the addition of a priceless spiritual extract, the refining process was measured in _years_. And even if it weren't being refined, after the damage it sustained in the battle with Helian Wumeng, he wouldn't risk bringing it out just to be wasted.

As for his suit of scale armor, while he had secured a path to obtaining it, the forging itself could be months or even years away.

To make matters worse, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd at his waist was highly specialized. It was not only cumbersome, but its power would actually _decrease_ if an attack missed. It could only be used as a final trump card, not as a standard weapon.

He was, at this moment, effectively empty-handed. Even this temporary weapon had to be condensed into profound unity using a combination of the Sun's Resonant Parting Art, his Bright Yang divine ability, and the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts!

How sharp was Murong Yan's gaze? He perceived Li Zhouwei's predicament at a glance. It wasn't that he didn't want to press his advantage, but he could only exhale deeply, coughing up two small specks of golden light.

'Supreme Yang power... That radiance didn't seem to be of a high grade, yet it packed quite a punch...'

Still, he cultivated Valley Water. When facing Supreme Yang power, he was far less vulnerable than Helian Wumeng was with his Baleful Qi. Murong Yan's own spell arts were of a higher grade, and his Dharma Art hadn't been broken—it was just a minor cough. What truly made him cautious, however, was that faint trace of fiend-breaking power embedded within his opponent's divine ability.

If not for that, Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light would never have affected him so strongly, forcing him to take a full breath to recover—a breath that gave his opponent just enough time to form a new attack!

'He has a strong foundation, after all. It carries a hint of the divine.'

He circulated his dharma power, quickly dissolving the last of the Supreme Yang power within him. As he did, Murong Yan's pupils constricted—the man wasn't retreating or defending. He was charging, halberd leveled straight at him!

"Good!"

The Spiritual Artifact in his hand, the River Wall Rod, snapped upward. Infused with the dense power of Valley Water and glowing with a metallic sheen, it met the oncoming halberd's thrust just in time.

"Screeech..."

Heavenly Light and purple flames erupted at the impact. The black-flamed halberd bent precariously as it clashed with the genuine Spiritual Artifact, but it held. Li Zhouwei's expression was impassive. With a slight twist of his wrist, he deflected the halberd. The tip scraped against the rod, kicking up a shower of violet sparks as it slid past the Spiritual Artifact. The shaft instantly snapped straight, and he redirected the thrust straight at the fiend's face. The divine power in the attack was undiminished—if anything, it was even stronger than before!

This single exchange piqued Murong Yan's interest. That was no ordinary weapon, and it had just clashed with a true Spiritual Artifact. The maneuver _looked_ simple, but to execute it required a high degree of both Dao-Profundity and weapon mastery. His thoughts raced.

'His skill isn't just in Bright Yang spell arts! His weapon mastery is impressive as well!'

Facing the glittering halberd tip, he tilted his head back slightly, exposing a thick, bullish neck as wide as his head. In a flash, his larynx tore open. From the fleshy rift emerged a woman's face, pale and beautiful, framed by unbound hair.

The woman smiled faintly. As the halberd's divine-ability-infused tip arrived, her ruby lips parted to reveal eight sharp teeth. With the speed of a thunderbolt, she bit down hard on the blade.

"Boom!"

Violet fire erupted as black qi billowed. Li Zhouwei's halberd felt as if it had been plunged into deep water or wedged in a crevice of solid steel. It was completely immobilized. The woman's hands, white as jade, emerged from beneath Murong Yan's armpits to grip the halberd's blade tightly.

Murong Yan's barrel-like torso rapidly deflated. His entire coarse skin-bag, like a set of ill-fitting clothes, hung from the woman's frame, revealing her own slender, elegant figure. Her beautiful eyes were a milky white, yet they radiated an icy chill.

"Kk-crack..."

It was, after all, only a weapon condensed from a divine ability. It emitted the sound of catastrophic failure. Li Zhouwei's eyes narrowed. He slammed his elbow down onto the halberd's shaft, putting his full weight behind it. The weapon could no longer bear the strain. The halberd's head _banged_ and exploded, showering the sky in black flames.

But through that cloud of dark fire, Li Zhouwei had already reversed his grip on the now-bare shaft. His thumb locked tight, he thrust forward in a sudden, violent motion—a hammer-strike aimed directly at the woman's brow!

"Splash!"

A spray of Valley Water scattered. The woman, who seemed to possess only the strength for that single bite, had no time to react before the hammer-blow shattered her into pieces. Amidst the exploding spray of Valley Water, the empty skin-bag drifted free, caught by a gust of wind and swept high into the sky.

Yet where she had stood, a large, jade-white hand shot out and seized the broken halberd shaft.

Murong Yan had reappeared. He was visibly leaner now, his bare upper body revealing defined, jade-white musculature. His face, too, had transformed into that of a handsome, sharp-featured, and martial man.

Only his eyes remained that deep, violet-black, radiating a billow of demonic qi.

His hand crushed the remnants of the halberd shaft, a sharp grinding sound coming from his palm. Far below, the fat skin-bag, carried by the wind, flopped down onto the brown rocks by the river like a discarded sack.

"Good... Even without a proper weapon... you are still this ferocious!"

He relaxed his grip slightly. A jade-white powder—the pulverized remnants of the shaft—drifted from his fingers, dissolving back into black flame and Heavenly Light. Murong Yan's eyes were now incredibly sharp and imperious, and a small smile touched his lips.

"Again!"

The shaft in Li Zhouwei's hand was now only three feet long. A scorching battle intent rose in his own eyes, and the flashing Heavenly Light around him was blinding. Diamond-shaped fragments of light appeared from the void, flowing along the shaft. As if time were reversing, the broken weapon reformed, restoring itself to its original state.

The long, rod-like weapon was once again in Murong Yan's grasp. His entire aura shifted. He soared into the air, gripping the rod with both hands and raising it high above his head. Every muscle in his body strained in unison. The Spiritual Artifact—not quite a sword, not quite a staff—suddenly changed. As he dove, it condensed a demonic blade of black qi as large as a house, and he brought it chopping down!

The halberd thrust straight up to meet it, tip against demonic blade. They exploded in mid-air. The halberd bent for a single, fleeting breath before a sharp _snap_ echoed through the sky.

"Twang!"

The condensed halberd could not hold. Starting from the tip, it disintegrated into a cloud of glittering fragments. The shaft in Li Zhouwei's hands exploded along with it, dissolving into motes of light. The River Wall Rod, its path now clear, whistled downward!

"Boom!"

A fog of black flame erupted, and the Heavenly Light in the sky dimmed abruptly. The aura of Sunless Deceit flared, causing all color to drain from the riverbanks below.

When the smoke cleared, Li Zhouwei was revealed, his two hands crossed in front of him. The River Wall Rod was pressed firmly against his open palms. A dense black qi surged from the point of contact, flowing over his hands and down his powerful arms.

Four slender, golden-white arms then burst from Li Zhouwei's back, bracing themselves in front of him to grip the jet-black River Wall Rod. Both men's divine abilities flared wildly as they became locked in a stalemate, frozen in mid-air.

Below, there was only silence. The battle between the two in the sky was fierce, and every spectator held their breath. Far beyond, in the Great Void, hidden gazes met in silent acknowledgment.

Murong Yan, however, seemed unconcerned. His first misjudgment was from not knowing his opponent's full arsenal; he wouldn't be fooled a second time. He had easily evaded the grasp of those extra arms, forcing Li Zhouwei to catch the rod with his palms instead.

But as he stared at those four slender, golden-white arms, his expression became uncertain for the first time, mirroring the reaction Helian Wumeng once had.

"A Profound Qi spell art... Is that the path of the Touba family?"

"Helian Wumeng never mentioned this!"

He was stunned for only a fraction of a second.

The stalemate broke as quickly as it had formed. The River Wall Rod leaped back of its own accord, spinning twice in the air before landing in its master's hand. But Murong Yan had already snapped his head up, his face illuminated by a new, brilliant light. The colorful clouds above were roiling as a behemoth, like a meteor from beyond the heavens, tore through the sky and descended!

_Audience with the Celestial Gate_!

A brilliant radiance flared, banners fluttering in an unseen wind. A corner of the pure-white gate, as massive as a courtyard, blazed with a meteor's tail of fire as it appeared directly above his head.

Li Zhouwei had taken that blow head-on precisely for this moment—to instantly switch from defense to offense!

Amidst the billowing white steam, Murong Yan's violet-black eyes remained calm and cold as he gazed into the distance. The golden-eyed young man had already retracted his palms, shaking off the last of the black qi.

Li Zhouwei was not unscathed. His palms were covered in a radial pattern of glazed, glass-like cracks, with traces of black qi still crawling within them. He paid it no mind, however, and with a simple flick, he dispersed the lingering demonic energy.

The fiend-dispelling wonder of Illuminating Sun and Moon!

His hand drew back, coming to rest on the hilt of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd at his waist. But his expression was far from relaxed. His golden eyes swept the scene, his gaze lingering for a moment on that large rock far below on the riverbank.

'My reach is too short... He's incredibly cautious.'

Just as he thought, Murong Yan, who appeared trapped beneath the celestial gate, showed not a trace of panic. He turned his head slightly, and the aura of Sunless Deceit circulated around him, neutralizing the torrent of Heavenly Light. He let out a short laugh.

"You fulfill the meaning of my valley."

He looked up again, his throat turning a bloody red. The woman's form surged from his larynx once more, and his entire body exploded into a cloud of colorless, hazy flames. The flames evaporated instantly in the searing purple fire of the descending gate, leaving no trace of him behind.

The wind howled. Far below, the skin-bag lying draped over the river rock suddenly inflated as if filling with air. Flesh and blood regenerated from the marrow within. It flipped itself over, straightened its clothes, and vanished.

Simultaneously, all the celestial phenomena—the descending gate, the purple flames—vanished. Li Zhouwei's figure was also gone. Only the sky remained, its colors growing steadily more vivid. Within moments, it was as if nothing had ever happened. Everything on the two riverbanks gradually returned from shadow to light.

"Good."

The man on the distant, flame-arched bridge offered his praise, shaking his head with a sigh. He watched as the figure in the skin-bag strode back and sat down carelessly at the table. Shilou Yingge laughed.

"You underestimated him, didn't you!"

"He has a few tricks. It was a good chance to test his methods while he's without a proper weapon."

Murong Yan had reverted to his original short, stout, and coarse appearance. The fit, martial man with the cold, violet-black eyes seemed to have vanished completely. He casually produced a pair of silver chopsticks and replied, "His eyes are the most formidable part. His dharma-body is at the level of a Body Divine Ability, but those eyes... an ordinary cultivator, even one who had mastered a Life Divine Ability, wouldn't be able to see through my outer form. Yet he spotted that the Valley Visage was on the riverbank. I was hoping to bait out the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, to see what kind of power it has... A pity. He didn't take the bait."

He said no more, and Shilou Yingge tactfully avoided mentioning the four arms that had appeared on Li Zhouwei's back. Seemingly in a good mood, Shilou Yingge laughed heartily.

"He's unarmed and clearly doesn't want to escalate things. A brief clash and mutual retreat is the best outcome. After all, he has trump cards, but you also have your Vast Water Seal Art, which you never used. A true fight would be troublesome for you both."

"Still... once he gets a suitable weapon, I'm not sure you'll be able to take him down so easily."

For once, Murong Yan held his temper in check. He just chuckled and replied, "The Spring of Rebirth is almost finished. I can't afford to be injured right now. A simple probe was for the best."

This gave Shilou Yingge a jolt.

'So fast... He looks completely confident. He's going to succeed this time. To think I'm only five or six years ahead of him on this step... The foundation of the Murong family is so much deeper than my own!'

Murong Yan seemed oblivious to his thoughts, focusing only on his food. After a long moment, he set down his chopsticks and said quietly, "The timing is wrong. If I were perhaps two hundred years older, it would be ideal to wound him, shave off a bit of his destiny, and use it to try for the Buddhist Land. As it stands... unless I can kill him outright, it's not worth the effort. And I have no confidence I can."

"For now... we'll just have to wait for our Lord Qi."

...

On the north bank.

The mountain wind was bitingly cold. The crimson-robed man stared intently at the sky, finally releasing a long, heavy breath. He stood silently beside the small pavilion, his mind reeling.

'So this is the Purple Mansion Realm... Until one reaches this realm... one is nothing but a speck of dust beneath the Heavenly Light and celestial flames!'

He lowered his head. Li Zhouwei had reappeared in the pavilion.

"Father..." Li Jiangqian said hurriedly.

Li Zhouwei shook his head and held up his hand. The glazed cracks remained on his palm, now stretching to his little finger. All the demonic qi had already been expelled, but it took another long moment before the last trace of Valley Water power was finally dissolved.

"A truly formidable individual."

As the last of the invasive energy dissipated, a faint grinding sound, like stone on metal, came from his palm. The skin was already knitting itself back together, smoothing over to its original, unblemished state.

This was the restorative power of Illuminating Sun and Moon, which tied his life-mandate to his single mansion.

Unless his arm or hand were severed and stolen away, he couldn't suffer a truly debilitating injury. For wounds from impacts or shattering forces, as long as the foreign dharma power was dissolved, healing was a simple matter.

This was not a serious injury. Even though the opponent was a demonic cultivator, the damage had been mitigated by his own dharma-body and Illuminating Sun and Moon. With the added boost from the Profound Vastness Art, his recovery would be even faster. He wouldn't even need to actively circulate his divine ability; it would heal on its own in three to five days.

But Li Zhouwei wasn't focused on the injury. He was analyzing his opponent's spell arts and Dao Lineage.

'Valley Water... The divine art, Audience with the Celestial Gate, has always been unfailingly effective. Grand-Uncle built much of his reputation in Jiangnan upon it. Now, I've finally encountered a divine ability that doesn't fear it. Valley Water... it is water in a deep gorge, water that is inherently hidden. The moment you try to suppress it, it's like a fish returning to water...'

'This doesn't just counter Audience with the Celestial Gate. I fear _all_ suppression and sealing-type arts are likely ineffective against Valley Water...'

He had seen something similar once before: Ding Weizeng's Palace-Yang Tiger, which also had the uncanny ability to escape confinement. But that was a specific art from the Hengzhu, not a broad counter to all suppression arts like Valley Water seemed to be.

By the same token, Murong Yan's staff attack must have been a demonic art of transformation. It was primarily demonic spell arts, mixed with just a fraction of his own divine ability and dharma power. Yet even after the demonic qi was stripped away, that tiny fraction of power took him significant effort to dissolve. This proved that when the dharma power of the Valley Water Dao invades a body, it uses the concept of 'Valley Water' to linger indefinitely, inflicting insidious harm.

'As expected of a dao long-established in this world by a True Monarch. Truly formidable. I wonder if he has combined it with the demonic dao. From what I saw, his arts for escaping and preserving his life are also first-rate. And Valley Water is notoriously exceptional at healing. It cannot be called weak! Its only flaw is a lack of offensive power...'

That skin-bag replacement technique of Murong Yan's, that art of concealing one's true form, was incredibly profound. That move alone was enough to reveal the brilliance of both his clan's inheritance and his own personal cultivation.

'This was a significant gain... After all, without having experienced this firsthand, both Grand-Uncle and I would surely have suffered a great loss if we were ever caught off-guard by a Valley Water cultivator.'

While he was lost in thought, Li Jiangqian spoke up from the side.

"Father... the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition showed no reaction..."

Li Zhouwei waved his hand, unconcerned. Whether they were being detained or were simply observing, this was all just the beginning. He shook his head, his voice low.

"The great clans of the north, the scions of King-Marquis lines... none of them are mediocrities. Their Dao arts are profound, their innate talent superb. The cultivators of the south, I fear, are inferior. As for those overseas, the likes of Zhu Gong and Changxi, they merely borrow power from the Great Void to preserve their own lives..."

His hand rested on the table, his voice laced with a grim exhilaration and a sharp killing intent.

"From this day forward, the banks of this great river will see the esteemed King-Marquis of the northern court, the sons of imperial bloodlines, the heroes of the Viewing Pavilion, and the surviving lineages of countless Daos. I wonder how many will come to test themselves against my life? How many families will seek to cross this river and do me harm? The river flows on, day and night, just as it did a hundred years ago!"

Hearing his father's words, Li Jiangqian lowered his head even further, a sinister, venomous light glinting in his golden eyes. Li Zhouwei paused for a moment, then said quietly, "We just have to wait. A change is bound to come."

# Chapter 943: The Wounds That Breed Hatred

Rain fell from the churning clouds over Shanji Prefecture. A woman in purple robes hovered in the air, one hand forming an incantation seal while the other held a pale, greyish-white gourd. As she chanted, torrents of azure and blue flame coiled around her, swirling like a pack of savage Flood Dragons.

On the opposing side, black smoke billowed and converged. A blood-red radiance slashed across the horizon, a crimson longsword piercing the air to strike the surging conflagration. It was instantly repelled by the overwhelming power of the Immeasurable Water and Fire, shattering into plumes of dark mist.

Amidst the demonic smoke stood the Helian family's genius, a four-eyed demonic cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm. A bloody light pulsed from his eyes, and his face was split in a wide, eager grin.

"The Supreme Minister's Gourd truly lives up to its reputation!"

The purple-robed woman within the flames ignored him. Her beautiful eyes shifted, focusing intently on a spot within the mists. A middle-aged man stood there, possessing striking features with a high-bridged nose and deep-set eyes. He was turned slightly to the side, revealing the glowing longsword, short blade, and whip hanging at his waist.

'Helian Wujiang!'

This mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master wasn't renowned for his combat prowess. His cultivation path was completely unlike Helian Wumeng's Heavenly Embryo Dao; he followed the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.

'His Dao-Profundity is far greater than Helian Wumeng's. The Helian family's rise is largely thanks to him. He almost single-handedly pulled the Tiefu Kingdom from the brink, which is the only reason Helian Wumeng is even alive today.'

'This man doesn't focus on spell arts, artifact crafting, or alchemy. He is singularly devoted to increasing his Dao-Profundity.'

Tinglan knew this path well; two of the seniors from her own Purple Smoke Gate were masters of it.

This type of Daoist Master commands a wider range of divine ability transformations and possesses a more comprehensive set of skills. They are often the ones capable of reincarnation, or of developing new variations based on their unique Dao Lineage.

Therefore, while he might not unleash any devastating spell arts himself, he could undoubtedly counter her own. With the ferocious, wide-open brawler Helian Wumeng on the attack, and a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert of profound Dao-Profundity watching coldly from the sidelines... this was an incredibly dangerous situation.

But the middle-aged man in the clouds made no move. His deep-set eyes gazed from afar, fixed on the small, grey-white gourd within the roaring flames. He sighed inwardly with admiration.

'Zimu's Supreme Minister's Gourd... Such an exquisite method!'

As a fellow cultivator who specialized in divine abilities and the study of Dao-Profundity, his gaze lingered for a few extra breaths. He turned his head slightly, watching Helian Wumeng pounce fiercely through the air.

He condensed his divine ability into a thin line, sending a silent message:

"The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition still has power in reserve. Houfu's location is unknown, and there may even be a Great Daoist Master who hasn't yet shown their hand. Do not be reckless. Follow the plan and just tie her down. If she pins you with a Spiritual Artifact and reinforcements arrive, we will be in mortal danger!"

Helian Wumeng looked like he was thoroughly enjoying the fight, all while constantly analyzing his opponent's spell arts. But despite his gleeful expression, he was no fool. He gave a silent acknowledgement.

The sky was growing dim. Helian Wujiang's brow furrowed slightly as a jade pendant in his hand flashed. At that exact moment, a clear beam of light shot across the river, and a voice called out, "Is that Daoist friend Tinglan?"

Helian Wujiang and Helian Wumeng exchanged a look. They immediately turned and stepped into the Great Void.

The two foreign Purple Mansion Realm cultivators paused in the Great Void, not leaving immediately. Helian Wumeng stowed his long-handled blade, looking somewhat sullen. He forced a smile at the man beside him.

"This is dull. It's nothing like the Great Desert. Out there, you kill or you die. If you can't win, you flee, heal up for a few years, and try again. The South... it's just so lukewarm."

"The South is stable. The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is all one family; it's not comparable," Helian Wujiang replied calmly, his voice tinged with melancholy. "We're being prodded into action on this river, but we must not become a weapon in someone else's hands. After our family's lineage was broken, we struggled through hardship to get where we are today. We absolutely cannot afford a setback."

He lowered his voice. "However... it was good that you didn't mention the Profound Qi Art. That belongs to the Touba family. They've always been well-protected, and on top of that, a new genius emerged from their ranks a few years ago. The King of Dai is in his prime, just one step away from mastering the Five Methods, and he's a close friend of Daoist Master Chiguang. This is a critical time. We absolutely cannot afford to offend them."

"Everyone knows there's something wrong with that art, but _who_ says so... that carries a very different meaning. Forget youeven those few Merciful Ones in Jiangbei... has a single one of them dared to speak up?"

"Don't be fooled. Murong Yan may look like a brute, and Shilou Yingge is insufferably arrogant, but neither of them will breathe a single word about it."

"I understand, Uncle." Helian Wumeng pondered for a moment. "Could it have come from Tuoba Chongyuan? When the Second Young Master died suddenly in the South all those years ago, it caused a huge uproar across the Mobei. I heard he was killed by Dongfang Heyun. If Dongfang Heyun killed him, could he have obtained one or two of his spell arts or techniques? And could they have passed to someone else?"

"It's possible." Helian Wujiang's expression was grave as he shook his head. "Although Emperor Wu of Liang admired the laws of Great Wei and held the Wei Emperor in high regard, things have progressed too far. The Touba family can no longer have any involvement with the Li clan."

"Even if, for the sake of argument, they were providing secret aid, there would be no reason to use such an obvious calling card. The machinations at play here are deep. You and I must not get involved."

His eyes were dark, simmering with a profound hatred. "We just need to wait for our chance," he hissed, his voice low. "The powers that besieged our Lord... we will skin them alive and eat their flesh. Only then can we appease our Lord's spirit in heaven!"

Hatred was clear on Helian Wumeng's face, though it lacked the deep-seated venom of his uncle's. Though he was the impulsive one, he now clasped his hands and ground out through his teeth, "We will endure for now... but we will make them pay."

---

Having made their decision, the uncle and nephew duo turned and flew north. Back over Shanji Prefecture, the great flames finally subsided, retreating into the small, grey-white gourd. Daoist Master Tinglan descended on the wind, moving to greet the beam of clear light arriving from the river.

The light resolved into an old man with a full head of white hair, leaning on a wooden staff. He stopped in the prefecture and clasped his hands in greeting. Though Tinglan was clearly weighed down by worry, she forced a smile. "Senior Shanbai! Thank you for coming."

This was Daoist Master Shanbai, a rogue cultivator from the coast. He looked slightly awkward as he replied, "I was waiting on the river for a good while. When I saw someone crossing, I thought I'd lend a hand."

Tinglan silently checked the jade pendant in her sleeve. It was no longer flashing, which meant the situation at Moongaze Lake had also been resolved. She let out a quiet sigh of relief and smiled. "Please, this way."

Daoist Master Shanbai had always been on good terms with both Purple Smoke and Xiukui. However, his territory by the sea was near the Xiuyue Mountain Gate, placing him, strictly speaking, under Xiuyue's jurisdiction. Houfu and the others, aware of this, had never pressed him for help. He, in turn, had tactfully spent all these years in "seclusion" to avoid the issue.

Now, with a lull in the conflict between north and south, the two sides were locked in a stalemate, and the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition had barely enough power to defend the river. Daoist Master Shanbai had finally decided to stop waiting. He'd used "coming out of seclusion" as an excuse to visit... naturally, he was here to assess Zhu Gong's injuries.

The two entered the array. The mountainside was still in disarray, with order only barely maintained. Daoist Master Shanbai was a fastidious man; he frowned immediately at the sight and shook his head. "Zhu Gong's subordinates are Eastern Sea demonic cultivators, after all. They're useless! Look at these new disciples they've recruited. What have they been taught? How can you call this a proper Dao Lineage? Is her heart even in this..."

Tinglan was respectful toward the old Daoist Masterfar more so than she had been with Daoist Master Sumianand her words were candid. She sighed. "She has a free-spirited nature. In her eyes, managing all this is a waste of time she could be spending on her divine abilities. If the Dao Lineage wasn't in danger of failing, and if she didn't need Jiangnan's treasures, she wouldn't bother with any of this."

Shanbai just shook his head. "How does she justify it? The Secret Diffusion affair is over. Does she think she didn't get enough Mihua Spirit Elixir? Does she want to take more from you? Or is she still hoping for the Elucidation of Chongyuan's Supplemental Law? That's a pipe dream."

The Mihua Spirit Elixir was famous. It was an incredibly potent elixir from the Secret Diffusion Daoist Tradition, capable of washing away impurities, shoring up one's foundation, and granting immense benefits to cultivators of Earth Virtue and Metal Virtue. Though Shanbai hadn't known Zhu Gong's motive before, the situation had since become clear.

But at his words, Tinglan was unable to answer. She silently lowered her eyes.

Only Tinglan knew the truth. The South hadn't gained a single extra benefit from the Secret Diffusion affair; what they appeared to get was all they got. They hadn't seen so much as a shadow of the Mihua Spirit Elixir! As for the Elucidation of Chongyuan's Supplemental Law, it was completely missing. Everyone knew it was in the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, so one by one, they all came to suspect the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. It was a silent, bitter grievance. Shanbai was rightZhu Gong truly did covet those things.

She quickly composed her expression and offered a tactful smile. "Senior, you worry too much. Sister Zhu Gong is after the Three-Inch Earthen Core from the Great Xiukui Monastery. As for the Mihua Spirit Elixir... we do not possess any."

Shanbai nodded, stroking his beard. It was impossible to tell if he believed her. The old man simply sighed. "How many come to hate their afflictions, how many families perish seeking the Dao. Are the waves of the Vermillion Sea not yet treacherous enough? Why must you walk through fire?"

Tinglan turned her head slightly. Her usually delicate, smiling face was now completely serious, revealing an iron-clad resolve. "To plant a golden lotus in the flames, why should one spare their own life-mandate?"

The old man stared, stunned for a moment. He suddenly realized that while Tinglan was gentle, she was friends with the radical, reckless, demonic-cultivator-born Zhu Gong. The two of them, it seemed, had something fundamental in common after all.

He sighed and fell silent. They continued to the deepest part of the cave residence. The surroundings grew darker and more desolate, with no attendants to be seen. The disciple leading them was visibly trembling. Tinglan stopped before the chamber door and called out tentatively, "Daoist friend Zhu Gong?"

"Ah... Tinglan."

A voice answered from within, faint and ethereal, echoing in the empty chamber. A gust of warm air rushed out, carrying a few scattered red petals that tumbled to Tinglan's feet.

The petals were a delicate red, but they were riddled with small holes, as if something had gnawed on them, leaving them in a sorry state. Zhu Gong's voice suddenly grew urgent. "Is the old Daoist Master here? Thank you, thank you both, my benefactors!"

Daoist Master Shanbai's expression changed. He looked up, his pupils narrowing. He heard a _shasha_ sound, like the earth itself cracking like porcelain, accompanied by the rustling of countless small things crawling. The old man formed a seal for a divine ability, made a quick calculation, and frowned. "When was she also struck by a Veiled Yin injury?"

The old man sighed. "This is disastrous!"

If Daoist Master Shanbai could see it, Tinglan was not far behind. She froze, a flicker of guilt in her eyes. "I'm afraid... she was hit by a stray beam from Wei Xuanyin's dharma artifact," she whispered. "Veiled Yin lies dormant before erupting. This is... this is difficult to treat."

"Please, old Daoist Master, stabilize her injuries first. I will go find Zhaojing and bring him here."

**Tiger's Frontier Mountain, Kuidu Palace.**

_Clang... Clang..._

The drawn-out ring of metal on metal echoed endlessly through Kuidu Palace. The sound waves overlapped in the vast, sealed hall, sometimes slow and resonant as a temple bell, sometimes fast and sharp as a smith's hammer, ringing without cease.

A purplish-black alchemy cauldron stood in the very center, vibrating unstably. It was as if something was sealed within, and its every violent struggle caused motes of golden light to flare.

'What a spirited creature...' Li Ximing's face was pale. An excessive amount of divine ability and dharma power poured from him into the cauldron, relentlessly intensifying the True Fire in an attempt to forcibly refine the thing inside.

This pill was unlike any he had ever refined. The initial stages had been simple, and Li Ximing had proceeded with practiced ease. But the moment the Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat and the Non-Falling Golden Cloud merged, the situation in the cauldron changed instantly. The pill had come to life.

The raging True Fire had burned beneath the cauldron day and night for four months, yet the thing inside only grew more stubborn. It had long since begun to shudder like a living creature, leaping and thrashing in a frenzy, desperately trying to escape.

'And every single moment of its struggle drains a sea of my divine ability and dharma power... If the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron weren't a Purple Mansion Realm Spiritual Artifact, completely immune to the pill's impacts and requiring no effort to stabilize, this refinement would have failed long ago!'

'The pill scripture didn't mention this at all! The power of these two spiritual items combined is terrifying. Forget the old River-Center Cauldron... even the Treasure Elephant Cauldron wouldn't have been able to withstand this for long!'

He cursed Fuxun internally, guessing the demon king probably hadn't known this would happen either. 'Instead, the scripture just mentioned various _other_ adversities: unstable Spiritual Qi, poor harmonization of ingredients, clashes between the flame and the Spiritual Qi... I went through all of those. Thankfully, I'm experienced, and I had the help of the noble from the Azure Manifestation Dao, so I navigated them smoothly.'

'Add in this insane drain of divine ability and dharma power... It's lucky he found me. Anyone else would have ruined his entire batch of pills by now.'

Fortunately, after nearly four monthsone hundred and eight days of refiningthe creature finally reached its breaking point. After one last wave of convulsions, the two spiritual ingredients ceased their resistance, and the entire cauldron fell silent.

Li Ximing finally relaxed. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire blazed, illuminating the entire hall. But then he heard a low, hoarse, mournful cry.

"Second Uncle... Second Uncle..."

It was the Demon King, Qingyan. His eyes were red, and he was overcome with emotion, tears streaming down his face. His hands were clenched into fists, pressed so tightly against his legs that he was sobbing, unable to speak.

"Fuxun... Fuxun... If he takes this pill and still cannot cultivate, how can he ever face returning to Three Delusions Mountain!"

Li Ximing hadn't expected such a violent reaction. Qingyan must have known this elder as well. He paused in silence for a moment, then the True Fire in his hands blazed even more fiercely.

Golden and red light flashed, burning the Demon King's face bright red in the firelight, his tears drying instantly.

(End of this chapter)




# Chapter 944, Auspicious Success

‘The heart of this Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat isn't just heavy as a mountain; it's harder than most spiritual minerals and iron…’

The half-finished pill had only just settled down, but the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron had no intention of letting it rest. The runes covering its body lit up in unison, casting a soft black light upon the pill.

Bathed in this black radiance, the already-quiet pill became utterly still. Where moments before there had been a faint tremor, it now ceased to move entirely. The stubborn medicinal liquids that had resisted refinement were suddenly swallowed by the pill and assimilated, one by one.

Li Ximing understood.

‘The Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron must have a corresponding divine effect, but alas, I am not its master. I'm only borrowing it. It only reveals a fraction of its power when stimulated.’

Li Ximing intensified the True Fire by another degree, scorching the iron-like pill for another full month. At last, all the shimmering golden medicinal liquid was refined into it. The entire process, from start to finish, had taken nearly half a year.

One had to remember, the flame beneath the cauldron was the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual flame. Furthermore, Li Ximing had been pouring his divine ability and dharma power into it, enhancing its might even further. By all rights, any metal or stone in that cauldron should have been reduced to liquid by now. Yet all this effort was just barely enough to fuse the medicinal liquid into the pill. The sheer expenditure of divine ability and dharma power was the greatest Li Ximing had ever experienced in his history of alchemy.

He nurtured the pill for a quarter-hour. Then, wisps of golden cloud billowed from the cauldron's opening, transforming in mid-air into tiny golden bats. Each was no bigger than a thumb. They fluttered about, seeking places to cling—some hung upside down from the ceiling beams, others from the pillars, and some even crowded the cauldron's small opening, jostling for a place to hang.

Qingyan, standing to the side, had long since returned to his original form. His pupils reflected the tiny, flitting golden bats.

"That is Auspicious Qi," he said. "It signifies 'Continuous Advancement'—a steady, accumulating fortune, not a sudden leap that invites calamity. It likes to cling and hang upside down, gathering near seats of power and Spiritual Treasures... It is a joyous sign. The pill is a success!"

His expression grew distant, and he continued in a low voice,

"Relying on fate to accomplish things is, in itself, an art of hanging upside down and climbing. A pill of Auspicious Qi, though lacking intelligence, is influenced by this principle. It will try to cling, which means it should attach itself to the lid rather than emerging from the opening. It seeks to deceive the Alchemist, to prolong its own existence..."

Li Ximing nodded with a smile and let out a light breath. The restorative power of a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability was truly formidable; in that single breath, his slightly pale complexion turned ruddy once more. He struck the cauldron wall with his palm, causing the lid to fly open.

He used his divine ability to seize the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron's round lid. He glanced inside the cauldron—it was pitch black and completely empty. He then inverted the lid. Sure enough, a plump, round, golden bat the size of a fingernail was hanging upside down from it. Its wings were wrapped tightly around itself, forming a perfect sphere.

Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill!

"What an auspicious pill!"

Li Ximing exclaimed in admiration. The golden bat opened its eyes. They were bright white and perfectly round, completely devoid of pupils, and they swept their gaze around the room.

Fearing any unexpected complications, Li Ximing wasted no time. He produced a jade bottle, collected the Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill, and sealed the stopper tightly. Still feeling uneasy, he formed a hand seal and placed a seal of Bright Yang spell arts upon it.

"Many thanks for your help, Daoist Friend Qingyan!"

Li Ximing beamed, but the Demon King before him merely shook his head.

"Mine was nothing, merely a blessing. It is your pill art and fire control techniques that are truly astonishing. I have never seen their like in all my life!"

Li Ximing offered a few humble words in return. He swept his spiritual sense inward and discovered that a significant amount of Eastern Life Flowing Water still lingered within his Juque Palace, circling the spiritual aperture and emitting a brilliant glow.

The Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill was exceptionally difficult to refine. An ordinary cultivator might struggle with it for three to five years. But Li Ximing possessed True Fire and an extremely high level of fire control. With the Demon King's blessing, he had immediately compressed the timeline to under two years. He hadn't expected the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron to be so effective on top of that, reducing the projected timeline of over a year to less than one.

It seemed Qingyan had prepared the blessing assuming a three-to-five-year refinement. Thus, even though the pill was finished, a large amount of the Eastern Life Flowing Water remained in his Juque Palace.

Li Ximing asked about it with some hesitation. The Demon King realized what had happened.

"Ah, the Eastern Life Flowing Water was not fully consumed!"

"Rest assured, Daoist Friend... this substance has no other effects. A simple pulse of your divine ability will disperse it... However, it is, after all, blessed water. If you plan to refine any other pills in the near future, this water can still provide some benefit, even without my presence."

Li Ximing was delighted.

"Is that true?! How long can it last?"

Qingyan replied with a serious expression,

"It cannot last long. If left undisturbed, it might persist for two months or more. But the moment you refine another pill or use any spell arts within your Juque Palace, it will not last more than a few days. Is your True Fire stored in your Juque Palace? You should move it elsewhere to avoid consuming mental energy to control it."

"Excellent!"

Li Ximing was still visibly pleased. He possessed Talisman Qi, so he wasn't concerned about mental energy expenditure. He smiled.

"Your divine ability is magnificent, Daoist Friend! I am truly impressed."

Having successfully refined this pill, Li Ximing had immediately tasted the benefits. 'If this pill could be aided by Qingyan's blessing, other pills surely can as well. If I need to refine a truly great pill in the future, this Demon King might prove invaluable!'

Thus, he was keen on building a good relationship. He chatted with him for a moment before asking,

"May I ask where your sect is located, Daoist Friend? If I encounter more trouble on the path of alchemy in the future, I may need to ask for your assistance again!"

Qingyan smiled and replied,

"Around the West Sea, among the foreign states. If you come personally, Daoist Friend, just look for the Great Tazi. However, the distance is great. If you wish to send an envoy, just have them find Fuxun and inform him."

"Wonderful!"

Li Ximing agreed cheerfully. The two of them exited the main hall together. Outside, auspicious clouds had gathered in the sky, a tapestry of interconnected golden drifts. In the mountains below, the cold had vanished, the snow had melted, and a hundred flowers were in full bloom. The world teemed with vibrant life.

"A single great pill can truly cause such a phenomenon!"

He had barely stepped out of the hall when Houfu rushed over from the sky. He cupped his hands toward them both, congratulating them.

"Congratulations to you both!"

Li Ximing had just started to reply when the black-robed man hurried before them. Before Houfu could even speak, a ray of purple light shot through the air and materialized as a woman with slender eyebrows.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

"Daoist Friend Tinglan..."

Li Ximing recognized her at once. The purple-robed woman looked extremely anxious.

"Zhu Gong's injuries are worsening... I don't know how much longer she can last... I tracked you here, but I saw you were in the critical stage of refining a vital pill and dared not disturb you... I've been waiting for some time. Please, come with me!"

Houfu nodded repeatedly. The man had been eager to build a connection with Qingyan and immediately saw his opening.

"Zhaojing, you go ahead. I will host Daoist Friend Qingyan... We have much to discuss."

Li Ximing's heart skipped. He glanced back at Qingyan. The Demon King nodded slightly and exhaled, bidding them farewell. Li Ximing stepped into the Great Void and turned to Tinglan, who was beside him.

"How bad are her injuries?"

Ever since the great war between the North and South, Tinglan seldom wore her favored autumn-yellow robes, opting instead for the purple robes of the Purple Smoke Gate. They made her seem much plainer. Her brow was tightly furrowed.

"I shouldn't have involved you in this," she said. "We first sought Daoist Master Shanbai from the north. He has already examined her and given a diagnosis. I have come looking for you several times over the past half-month. Finally, I've caught you..."

"Her dharma body sustained the heaviest damage. The initial wounds never healed, and then she was besieged by several Merciful Ones. Thankfully, we had my Spiritual Treasure to help at Xiaoshi Mountain, so it wasn't a total disaster... After Xiaoshi Mountain fell, I received her distress signal. We pretended to retreat south... but actually went north to rendezvous with Kui Qi..."

"That's when it all went wrong... The situation was chaotic. I was distracted, and she ran into the northern demon cultivator, Zhu Kui. That man is venomous. He saw her dharma body was injured and still used insidious methods against her."

Tinglan paused, then added in a low voice,

"After all, Wenqing is watching over the river..."

Li Ximing frowned. The situation at the time had indeed been chaotic. It wasn't wrong for Tinglan and the others to think of returning to the Tangdao Mountain Range first. His own Heir's breakthrough had prevented that from becoming a major disaster, but he had never felt it was his place to bring it up. Whether Kan Ziyu was actually present, or whether she would have intervened, was another matter entirely.

In two steps, they had arrived at Shanji Prefecture. As they entered the sect gates, Tinglan continued,

"When she returned, her injuries were still manageable. I gave her pills and told her to recuperate. But looking at it now, in that chaos, she must have been secretly struck by Wei Xuanyin's Spiritual Treasure as well. Veiled Yin is inherently difficult to detect, and we didn't realize she'd been hit by his divine ability."

Li Ximing felt a chill run down his spine.

'There were so many Daoist Masters present at the time. Why not target someone from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition? Only killing a direct descendant of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition would count as an effective blow. Why go to the trouble of attacking Zhu Gong, a relative nobody? I fear he was sending a warning... making an example of her!'

Judging by their expressions, the injury was clearly severe. Li Ximing followed Tinglan into a cave residence. As expected, he heard the faint, scurrying sound of rats, much like what had happened with Kui Qi. His expression turned serious.

"The taboo that Senior Kui Qi had... am I permitted to see her?"

"It's fine," Tinglan replied. "Senior Shanbai has it under control. We were just discussing a solution."

They entered together, pushing open a stone door. They saw a white-haired old man off to the side, channeling his divine ability to grind herbs. He held a small, cyan jade mortar that pulsed with a faint glow. He was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

'That must be Daoist Master Shanbai. A rare cultivator of the Horn Wood Dao!'

Li Ximing greeted him. The old man responded with a cheerful chuckle, and Tinglan, her face etched with worry, led Li Ximing further inside.

In the main hall, a jade bed rested on a high platform. Below it, red stones of all sizes were piled up like a small mountain, casting the room in a crimson hue. The cracks between the stones were stuffed with dense red flower petals, creating a sea of flowers that flowed from the bedside all the way down the steps, almost burying the bed itself.

A young woman who looked sixteen or seventeen sat leaning on the jade bed. Her eyes were slightly downcast, her skin tender and white. She was draped only in a thin red gauze, tied tightly at the collar and cascading down over the red flowers. A pair of jade-white legs emerged from the gauze, her delicate feet resting on the petals.

Her cheeks were flushed pink from her injuries, but her eyes were jet black. When she saw them enter, she managed a strained smile.

"Greetings, Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing recognized Zhu Gong. Compared to her former high spirits and boundless arrogance, the woman before him now seemed utterly frail. In the dimly lit cave, her eyes even held a trace of panic.

"Daoist Friend Zhu Gong..."

Li Ximing cupped his hands. Although the young woman's cheeks were flushed crimson and she didn't exude an aura of death, he could still keenly sense the erratic divine ability fluctuations coming from her body.

Tinglan sighed.

"Zhaojing, please take a look?"

Li Ximing murmured an apology and took Zhu Gong's wrist, which was as hot as burning charcoal. He sent a trace of his divine ability into her and felt his blood run cold.

A damp, cold divine ability permeated her body, surging and ebbing, hiding within her meridians and flesh. It resonated faintly with the Great Void and was constantly traversing her many Profound Acupoints. Whenever his divine ability tried to suppress it, it would immediately vanish, only to reappear elsewhere.

'Such a venomous Veiled Yin divine ability…'

Li Ximing's brow furrowed. He had dealt with such lingering injuries before.

"I, too, suffered greatly from Changxiao's Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art," he said in a low voice. "These types of injuries are the most insidious. They either take ten or twenty years to resolve, or they utterly destroy your dharma body."

A flash of hatred crossed the young woman's eyes, but it quickly faded. "What can be done? That Wei Xuanyin is the Grand Preceptor of Zhao State, a Great Daoist Master. He used his Spiritual Treasure to strike me secretly while I was injured and vulnerable. Of course I was fooled... From the looks of it, he clearly wants to destroy my dharma body so I'm forced to flee overseas to heal."

Tinglan remained silent at her words. Li Ximing shook his head awkwardly. Zhu Gong studied him, her eyes flickered.

'I only heard about his affair with Changxi and thought him rigid and easy to plot against. I never imagined that after just a few years, he would be the one to gain the most. He is, after all, a character who achieved the Dao on the mainland. I cannot underestimate him.'

After probing for a moment, Li Ximing became thoughtful.

"I once refined a pill using Valley Water for internal injuries. I'm not sure how effective it will be here. Allow me to consult with the old senior. He can make the diagnosis, and I will find a way to refine the pill."

He appeared completely earnest and dedicated, which brought a flicker of gratitude to Zhu Gong's eyes. She thanked him, and he excused himself.

Tinglan let out a breath of relief and sat down beside her.

"Having him here makes things much easier. A targeted pill makes all the difference, especially one refined by a Bright Yang cultivator... If it truly cannot be cured, Hengxing has better methods. At worst, I will go and beg her!"

Zhu Gong's expression turned troubled.

"She has always looked down on me... That's the way it is overseas. I grew up there. It's kill or be killed. I hate that man-eat-man world. After my master fell, I only broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm with the help of my patron, and I managed to pacify a sea. But suddenly, I'm the one at fault."

Tinglan shook her head, remaining silent on that topic.

"Just focus on healing... Overseas... something has happened again."

Zhu Gong's expression immediately turned serious.

"Overseas? The Xinyu Archipelago?"

Tinglan nodded and sighed.

"Ever since someone intentionally created that phenomenon nearby, I've brought back our key disciples. I've also personally inspected the earth veins. It's no small matter. That thing beneath is growing restless. If this continues, others will inevitably find out."

Zhu Gong's expression shifted rapidly. Finally, she let out a heavy breath, as if in resignation.

"If we truly can't control it, let it go... Something from the Sheji Dao is not for the likes of us to protect. My master warned me when she was alive... if all else fails, we must abandon it."

Tinglan's face darkened.

"How can we let it go? The consequences would be endless! First, you must heal. Once this is over, we will discuss it... Now that Wenqing has broken through, as long as we can extract ourselves from this northern quagmire, we can surely spare one person to go and suppress it."

A complex look flashed in Zhu Gong's eyes. She mumbled something under her breath, but ultimately left it unsaid,

'How can there possibly be time? They have been scheming for so long, meticulously... Their plot against you wasn't hatched in a day! Those caught in the middle truly cannot see clearly...'




# Chapter 945, Wind and Sand

Golden clouds shimmered. Gusts of wind and sand rolled across the lake's surface, painting the sky in a riot of colors. A pillar of purple-gold light towered into the air as the formation activated spontaneously, sealing off the swirling dust at both ends.

Bright streaks of light arrived one by one, stopping in the sky. They gathered at extreme speed above the cave estate by the lake, between the purple-gold pillars, and silently observed one another.

'It's the West Seventh Pillar Cave Estate...'

Only a breath of time passed before a man in black robes strode over on the wind. His expression was rather complicated. The cultivators on both sides bowed in salute, respectfully saying,

"Dharma Protector Chen!"

Chen Yang nodded. He studied the shifting phenomenon in the sky, and a general understanding formed in his mind. But when he noted the location of this cave estate, something felt wrong. He murmured, "Is it the Fifth Young Master?"

The cultivators on both sides bowed their heads in unison. One stepped forward and said quietly, "Reporting to my lord... it is the Young Master's seclusion estate. He chose this lakeside dwelling himself all those years ago."

The "Fifth Young Master" Chen Yang spoke of was, of course, Li Zhouming. He just never imagined that someone of Li Zhouming's esteemed status would choose this grassy lakeside spot instead of a central location on the island... It seemed more like a place for a Guest Elder's seclusion.

He actually didn't care much for this notoriously profligate scion. After a moment of cold observation, he even felt a sense of relief, musing to himself,

'He must have failed his Foundation Establishment Realm... which is just as well. Having a profligate dandy like him around makes things difficult for every family.'

His face was a mask of regret. He waited for a while, but no one emerged. The people on either side also shook their heads silently. No one seemed particularly surprised, and they began to discuss who should go and open the cave estate.

After all, Li Zhouming had neither an admirable temperament nor any real ability. When he threw his weight around, everyone had to yield to him. To make matters worse, the man was stubborn, clinging to one or two dead-set principles. When the island issued an order, it was tacitly understood that there was always 30 or 40 percent leeway. But if this profligate scion happened to catch wind of that leeway, he would invariably raise hell about it.

Thus, Chen Yang sighed outwardly, but when he glanced around, he saw many people who looked visibly relieved. As the current standard-bearer of the Chen Clan, outstanding in both talent and ability, Chen Yang was thinking of more,

'All these years, that Xia Shouyu has been quiet, yet she's kept the Milin and Stray Fragrance under iron-clad control. She has a death grip on the lifeline of Qi-gathering. She and Li Que'wan have conspired to continuously raise the requirements for obtaining Qi, all while secretly promoting those from humble backgrounds and branch lineages...'

Chen Yang couldn't say he was opposed to their actions—it was merely a game of checks and balances. One of them was born overseas, and the other had returned to the lake from a remote branch lineage. Naturally, they disliked the nepotism shown to the direct lines and prominent clans. These days, some of the most precious and unique Spiritual Qi was being diverted to those of humble backgrounds, silently eroding the foundations of those with vested interests. But both of them were figures valued by the two Daoist Masters, so while there were grumbles below, no one dared to speak out.

Although Chen Yang felt little sense of belonging to the Chen Clan—at worst, he could just send a couple of subordinates to handle his own Qi-gathering—he now had two sons and would soon have grandchildren. There were one or two cultivation arts he desperately wanted for his descendants to practice, so he naturally hoped the two women would restrain themselves.

'Xia Shouyu knows how to read the room. She's just currying favor with Li Que'wan. Once Li Zhouming is dead and her backer is gone, she naturally won't dare participate in something that breeds so much resentment... As long as she softens her grip, Li Que'wan has to focus on her own cultivation and duties. This net will loosen considerably.'

A bit of tension left him. His expression still mournful, he said quietly, "The Young Master was always highly regarded... We should at least invite someone from the direct line of a similar generation to..."

Before he could finish, a burly man arrived, riding on thunder. His imposing, even somewhat brutish, face was filled with astonishment. He turned his head and asked, "Dharma Protector Chen! What's happened here!"

This man was none other than Li Zhouda, who had inherited the legacy of Li Chenghui. He had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm some time ago. His personality was explosive, brave, and decisive, making him a perfect fit for his cultivation art. His practice advanced by leaps and bounds. The six silver tokens hanging from his waist swayed, a clear warning to others.

In the end, authority truly shapes a person. In his younger years, he was famous for his recklessness and impulsivity, a flaw that nearly got him excluded from the line of succession. But now, after holding power in the Jade Court for two or three years, that same recklessness looked more like authority.

But as soon as he arrived, a long-robed Qi Refining cultivator on the far right had his expression change instantly. He shot Li Zhouda a dark look, and without saying a single word, silently rode the wind and departed.

Chen Yang saw this and sneered inwardly.

'This Li Zhoutui is just a spineless coward with a nasty temper. He's always saying Li Zhouda holds a grudge and is narrow-minded. It's hard to say who's really the narrow-minded one!'

"The Fifth Young Master... has likely fallen."

Chen Yang explained with great sorrow, causing the burly man's expression to freeze. Just then, Xia Shouyu arrived, riding a plume of fire with Li Xuanxuan. The woman's eyes were downcast as she supported the old man, appearing very quiet.

Li Xuanxuan's face and lips were pale. He stretched out a hand, silent for a long moment, his expression tinged with doubt.

'The life jade at Mount Qingdu shows no reaction...'

In contrast, Li Que'wan, who arrived after them, was relatively calm. Her gaze swept back and forth across the lake, though it was impossible to tell what she was looking for. A young man rode the wind up to her side, his expression stricken with grief.

"Clan Brother... Old Sir..."

"Zhouxun!"

Li Zhouda glanced at him and wiped his eyes. "You and I will go together... Back when you were cultivating on the lake, the Fifth Young Master often gifted you spiritual items."

Li Zhouxun agreed, trembling slightly, his rather handsome face etched with loss. This direct-line scion of the Li family had voluntarily given up his right to Li Chenghui's inheritance back in the day, and as a result, he was on good terms with both Li Zhouda and Li Zhoutui. He had also caught the eye of Li Xuanxuan and the others... It was hard to say if it was a loss or a gain.

Chen Yang dropped his mournful expression and stood guard with a solemn face. Suddenly, he saw a small boat being poled toward the shore. A boatman in a straw rain-cloak was pushing off the bank, singing loudly,

"A white horse gallops on the western ridge, descendants await ascension! The nine Qis unite to form a radiance platform, is this human world not joyful? A Demon's enchanting form cultivates to completion, how many find true destiny!"

Hearing this, Li Zhouda froze. Beside him, Li Zhouxun's expression turned bizarre, and he clamped his mouth shut. The surrounding Qi Refining cultivators all fell silent, exchanging speechless glances. Li Que'wan, however, let out a 'pfft' and covered her mouth, shaking her head.

The boatman's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation was unmistakable, and the Bright Yang Qi surged from him. Who else could it be?

The pale face of the old man in the sky instantly flushed with color. His lips, pressed tightly together, began to tremble. Joy and anger warred in his eyes. He clenched his fists and cursed under his breath,

"Absurd..."

Li Zhouda was stunned for a second, then found himself torn between anger and laughter. Joy ultimately won out in his eyes, and he cursed, "That bastard! Forging an Immortal Foundation with more pomp than a Daoist Master breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm! I don't know who he learned this from!"

The old man was afraid of embarrassing him in front of everyone, but Xia Shouyu, standing nearby, just flicked her white sleeves and descended with a cold smile. She landed in front of the boat and said with a grin, "Fifth Young Master, what magnificent flair!"

This terrified the boatman, who dropped his pole and laughed obsequiously. "Ah, so it is My Lady..."

The moment Xia Shouyu saw his smile, all her anger dissipated. She said, exasperated, "I was wondering who would pick a lakeside cave estate... And which boatman did you steal this boat from?"

"What are you talking about!"

Li Zhouming looked sheepish. He rode the wind up with her and replied, "I paid him well! I was just in such a hurry, afraid I couldn't pull off this grand entrance before you all arrived. I had to toss him on the shore... no idea where he's off to now."

Xia Shouyu couldn't help but laugh. She rolled her eyes, took his arm, and the two ascended into the sky together, welcomed by the chorus of congratulations from the cultivators on both sides,

"Congratulations, my lord, on achieving your Immortal Foundation!"

Li Zhouming, the same man who would burst out laughing at Xia Shouyu's cold snort, now wore an indifferent expression as he listened to the fawning of these cultivators. He gave Li Xuanxuan an apologetic smile, but the old man turned his head away, refusing to look at him.

Li Zhouda was overjoyed. He grabbed his hand and said earnestly, "Such a momentous occasion! We brothers must have a good drink!"

Li Zhouming nodded vigorously. "First, I must pay my respects to the Daoist Master."

After the commotion, the crowd dispersed. Li Zhouming hurried over to placate the old man. Li Xuanxuan didn't make things difficult for him, just shaking his head and telling him to go to the north shore.

"It's just in time for Jiangnian to come out of seclusion. He's preparing to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. You two go together. It will be good to see the Daoist Master."

But Li Zhouming didn't let him go, pressing him with questions about his health and well-being, and listening to recent news from the north. Seeing that he was surrounded by his own people, he said, "I don't like some of the people on this island. They're like fleas in a fur coat. It's still too crowded here. Since the north is pressing so hard, why don't we send more of them over?"

Hearing this, Li Que'wan gave him a surprised look. Xia Shouyu said nothing, lowering her head. Li Xuanxuan just turned and said, "You're overthinking it. Jianglong and Jiangqian have already made arrangements."

Li Zhouming, having just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, seemed to feel little joy. He just said, "I understand your words, my lord. There are many people like Fei Qing'yi. I'm just talking. Right now, Zhouda and Zhouxun are good brothers. I heard they've even gone to the Tangdao Mountain Range. Why must my family always be the ones charging on the front lines? Meanwhile, several of the prominent clans live in comfort."

Li Que'wan heard his words and sighed softly. "Clan Uncle, just watch. The conflict between north and south once broke the backs of the Tian and Xu clans. Who knows whose turn it is now. They are inwardly terrified, too. We are just slowing down their assignments, so as not to make them too nervous."

Only then did Li Zhouming understand. "I see... I'll head over right now."

...

### North Shore

A cold wind gusted through the pavilion. Li Zhouwei stood on the cliff, seemingly gazing into the distance, but the Spiritual Qi inside his body was constantly coalescing, gathering into streams of dharma power from the Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass and pouring into his sea of Qi.

The dharma power in his sea of Qi roiled, transforming into currents of dark gold qi that pooled at the bottom. It rose at an astonishing rate, faintly taking on the appearance of gleaming, scale-like plates.

Li Zhouwei's cultivation was already fast. In the past, he had to practice various spell arts just to slow himself down and hide his progress. After achieving his divine ability, his speed became even more frightening. Now, making no effort to conceal it, his cultivation base soared wildly. In just a few months, the cultivation in his sea of Qi had already reached more than halfway to forming his Immortal Foundation.

'I estimate in half a year, I can condense the Sovereign's Perilous Tread Immortal Foundation.'

Ordinarily, with the north and south on the brink of war at any moment, cultivating now was not a wise choice. But Li Zhouwei still had some Azure Talisman power left. As long as his Immortal Foundation was formed, he could use the side-effect-free Talisman Qi to boost it. The probability of achieving a divine ability was high. It was a gamble worth taking.

Li Jiangqian stood beside the hall. Seeing Li Zhouwei look over, he reported,

"In the last three months, several batches of Buddhist cultivators and demonic cultivators have crossed the river, appearing on the north shore, in the Wilderness, and near Shanji. They have all been driven back. Our family lost a few Qi Refining cultivators, and Guest Elder Miaoshui suffered minor injuries."

Li Zhouwei nodded, listening as he continued.

"There are more and more cultivators from the north. I hear direct-line scions from many Daoist traditions have come. That Murong Yan appeared near the Great Desert, passing by the edge of the Golden Feather Sect. Daoist Master Tianhuo is also said to have appeared, but no fight broke out."

"The Golden Feather Sect has always played both sides. A fight was never going to happen."

Li Zhouwei replied casually. "It's just as likely Daoist Master Tianhuo crossed the river first."

Li Jiangqian bowed his head respectfully. "There is some good news. Uncle Zhouming has broken through... Furthermore... Brother Jiangnian has come out of seclusion, and Brother Liang has already arrived in the mountains, preparing to see Father."

Li Zhouwei showed little surprise. "Let him come up."

Li Jiangqian bowed and descended. A few breaths later, a man in white robes was seen ascending the stone path.

The man had a striking pair of bright, golden eyes. His brow was dashing, brimming with heroic spirit. Tall and well-built, he already had the air of a talented young gentleman. This was Li Jiangliang.

He arrived at the pavilion and bowed. "Greetings, Father!"

Li Zhouwei's expression wasn't cold. He had him sit in the pavilion and said casually, "I heard you found a charming young lady. Why not bring her to the lake for a visit?"

Although Li Jiangliang appeared calm, facing Li Zhouwei made him unavoidably nervous. His eyes couldn't help but drop. "Tianyin ran into trouble midway and was delayed... Her father and brother are in trouble, so she had to go back temporarily."

"Mm."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "The imperial scions, the Yang Clan?"

Li Jiangliang affirmed it, looking slightly awkward. The boy no longer had much of his formerly obedient and well-behaved demeanor; he now seemed vibrant and energetic, yet secretly calculating.

"I didn't know at first... We just met while I was out. We had similar ambitions. Only later did I find out, but I didn't know it was _that_ Yang Clan of imperial descent..."

"She... she is a junior of the Yang Clan, of the direct bloodline. She's already at the Foundation Establishment Realm. It's said she's related to Clan Uncle Zhouluo and wants to pay him a visit..."

Li Zhouwei didn't humor his rambling. He just watched him quietly. "What are your plans for the future?"

Li Jiangliang was already sweating. He said respectfully, "Tianyin hopes I can make a trip to Simin Prefecture. I have also met her older brother; he is a first-class character, a man like Father... Once I get to Simin Prefecture and meet her father, the matter should be settled..."

The Li family had long known the Yang family was hiding a Purple Mansion Realm expert, one who most likely possessed a Life Divine Ability and was controlling the situation. They definitely had a grand scheme, perhaps making secret arrangements. But as Li Zhouwei looked at him now, his own son's words were clear and his assessment of the stakes was sharp. He was afraid this child already had his own plans.

"Your son wishes to travel south for a while. But with the north shore in constant turmoil, I feel terribly guilty for not being able to contribute... I hope to ask the Yang family. We are, after all, defending the river for the south, which would also be a way of contributing to our family."

Li Jiangliang lowered his gaze slightly. "Tianyin mentioned that Clan Uncle Zhouluo also has this good intention. Your son hopes to help make it happen."

Li Zhouwei chuckled at his words, but there was no laughter in his eyes.

This child had just said Li Zhouluo and Yang Tianyin had never met, but in the next breath, he said Li Zhouluo "also has this good intention." He was clearly stating that Li Zhouluo had been in contact with the Yang family; otherwise, how would Yang Tianyin know? With Li Chenghuai out training and Li Xizhi gone to the Eastern Sea, it was only logical for the Yang family to contact Li Zhouluo.

Li Jiangliang lowered his head, saying no more. After a long time, Li Zhouwei finally spoke.

"You mentioned Zhouluo... He is, after all, of Yang family blood. It's fine for him to have contact. But his son, Jiangchun, has also come to the lake. He is the eldest of his line, and his mother is from a great clan under the Chunyi Dao Gate's rule. His background is clean. I was just thinking of bringing him back to be raised on the island from now on."

Li Jiangliang nodded. "Father's arrangements are perfect... Actually, Uncle-Grandmaster Li Chenghuai would have been the most suitable, but unfortunately, his heart is set on the Dao, and he was already assigned a path by the elders... He withdrew himself in time. Turning to Uncle Zhouluo last was indeed a bit of a stretch."

"As for younger brother Jiangchun, I have met him on the lake. He is a very bright child. He will certainly have a great future in the clan."

These two sentences from Li Jiangliang made things even clearer. The smile faded from Li Zhouwei's face. His golden eyes locked onto Li Jiangliang's. He said quietly, "I originally thought Jiangqian was the one with the most ideas, but I never expected you to be the one who dares to act. Have you made up your mind?"

Li Jiangliang left his seat and knelt solidly on the ground. "Your son understands what he is doing. The family has countless talents; what does it matter if one of me is lost? My journey south this time is not only to fulfill my own wishes but also to contribute to the clan. If the situation changes... it also serves as a retreat path."

But Li Zhouwei merely watched him calmly from the pavilion. "Just fulfill your own wishes. I'm afraid that one day, when you come to the clan to demand or ask for something, we will probably have to give it to you."

Li Jiangliang broke out in a cold sweat. He kowtowed repeatedly. "Your son wouldn't dare! I will consider the clan in all matters. This heart is clear and true, absolutely without falsehood!"

"Get up."

Li Zhouwei looked away from him, toward the roiling river to the north. His voice grew softer.

"You children must all seek your own paths. You are clever. But your younger brother, Jiangnian, is a muddle-headed fool. I worry he'll cause trouble, but if I send him away... I worry he won't know how to survive. He's not like the rest of you. Even if you die, you'll at least understand _why_ you died."

"You have studied under Cui Jueyin for many years. Compared to me, your father who is never around, he is the one who has truly cared for you. Go and see him."

Tears instantly welled in Li Jiangliang's eyes. He kowtowed three heavy times. "Thank you, Father!"

The white-robed young man rose, retreated quickly, and vanished into the mountains. A long time passed before another man came up from the mountain path. The same white robe looked almost slovenly on him. He approached the pavilion, trembling with fear, and knelt.

"F... Father."

"Jiangnian."

Jiangnian had spent far more time in seclusion than his brothers, doing almost nothing but cultivating. Yet, he was only at the eighth level of Qi Refining. He knelt on the ground, afraid to move.

Facing this child, Li Zhouwei seemed much gentler. He helped him up. The boy's timid, gray eyes darted up to meet his before quickly dropping again. Jiangnian whispered, "F... Father... Your son is at the eighth level of Qi Refining. I was hoping to... receive a share of resources from the family... to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm..."

The Li family's original intention in having him cultivate the Jade True was to hand control of the Jade Court Guard to him. But his performance had been too pathetic, and that role had now been given to Li Zhouda. Li Zhouwei didn't seem disappointed in him, however. He just said softly, "Go and collect it. Cultivate more life-saving spell arts."

Jiangnian whispered, "Your son understands. I do not have the golden eyes... I am not like my brothers..."

Li Zhouwei seemed to be thinking of something else. He gave him a quiet look and replied, "Whether it is a blessing or a curse, who can say?"

Just then, a golden light descended from the sky, transforming within the pavilion into a man in gold and white Daoist robes. He sat down casually. Li Zhouwei waved for Jiangnian to withdraw, then returned to the pavilion and poured some tea.

"Uncle-Grandmaster, you've returned."

Li Ximing seemed to be in a hurry. He let out a breath and smiled. "I've come back to discuss something with you."

Li Zhouwei's expression was a little strange. "Uncle-Grandmaster is being rather polite."

Li Ximing laughed heartily, reached into his sleeve, and took out a brocade box, placing it gently on the table.

He opened the box, revealing a bright, pearl-like, translucent white stone resting on a bright red lining. Golden patterns were carved into its surface, constantly shifting, and a faint white aura swirled around it.

Li Ximing smiled. "This item is the Six-Phase Spirit Stone from the 'True Qi' Dao. It is a spiritual resource."

Li Zhouwei recognized it now. He looked down at it for a moment, a flash of appreciation in his eyes. "The 'True Qi' Dao? Don't tell me this came from Anhuai Heaven... Did the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition come asking?"

"Correct!"

Li Ximing sighed. "We examined Daoist Master Zhu Gong's injuries. She was ambushed by Wei Xuanyin. To heal her, it would be best to consume a high-level Bright Yang spiritual item. We don't have anything like that on hand. Fortunately, I am an Alchemist and can use a few other items to assist. I was hoping to take some of your blood as a substitute."

"I see."

Li Zhouwei said thoughtfully, "Daoist Master Zhu Gong... It seems they're making an example of her."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly, closing the jade box. "Tinglan brought this item out. She wanted to ask me to ask you... it shows her determination to save her... She had me bring it to you first to request your help. This matter... what do you think?"

Li Zhouwei gazed silently at the box. He took a sip of tea. "Daoist Master Zhu Gong... her refusal to withdraw from Jiangnan must mean she wants something from Tinglan..."

Before he could finish his sentence, both men stiffened. They snapped their heads up at the same time, looking to the northeast. A pillar of brown spiritual qi and roiling sand clouds towered into the sky. A muffled, earthy rumble carried from the distance. The ground trembled, and spiritual energies surged.

In the distance, a mountain range seemed to be moving. A world-shattering roar echoed, startling birds into flight. Yet, they only circled in the air, refusing to leave, even as the wind-blown sand battered them until they were bloody.

The column of dust quickly blotted out the distant horizon. Li Ximing rose into the air on a beam of light and stared for a long time, his expression gradually turning to one of stunned disbelief.

He met the gaze of Li Zhouwei beside him and murmured, " 'Bound Earth'... There is an omen of 'Bound Earth' in Jiangbei!"

Li Ximing seemed to remember something. His expression became complex, and for a moment, he was speechless. He silently tightened his grip on the brocade box in his hand. The light beneath his feet flickered, bright one moment and dim the next.

His Li family had obtained cultivation arts from the Profound Peak Gate. Kong Guxi had even entrusted the entire Kong family's legacy to them. This surging aura was extremely familiar. Li Ximing recognized it almost instantly!

Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra!

Li Zhouwei stood in the light with him, watching the sand and dust settle in the distance. He waited until the sun had set and the phenomenon had completely vanished, leaving only the fluctuating spiritual energies in the air.

The crimson afterglow draped over him. The golden-eyed man turned his head and said in a low voice, "Uncle-Grandmaster... what if she succeeded?"

# Chapter 946: Descendants

Li Ximing stood in the twilight, passing the brocade box from his left hand to his right. He juggled it, finding it surprisingly heavy, yet he had no desire to store it in his sleeve.

He lowered his gaze. "Why in Jiangbei? How could it possibly be in Jiangbei?"

His white-gold Daoist robes fluttered in the dying sun, appearing somewhat dim. He mulled over the words, murmuring, "What if... what if she succeeds?"

The two stared into the distance for a while. Li Zhouwei turned slightly, looking toward Shanji Prefecture. Everything at the Sacred Writ Gate was dark and heavy. Like the Purple Smoke Gate, it was utterly silent. No cultivators were ascending into the sky, and no one was flying west.

The sky darkened rapidly. The two silently descended, returning to the table. A cold wind skimmed across the river. Li Ximing set the brocade box down first, met Li Zhouwei's eyes, and simply sipped his tea.

There had been three breakthrough candidates from the Kong Clan back then. After all this time and all these turns, only Kong Tingyun remained. Everyone had guessed she was in seclusion in the Eastern Sea, some even suspected she was with Xuanyi. There had been no news for so long... but now, it was all clear.

Li Ximing could only let out a breath. "It's in Jiangbei..."

Li Zhouwei, however, stared at the brocade box on the table without a word. His unspoken meaning was clear. The man known as Daoist Master Zhaojing set his cup down, annoyed. "We're already too close."

How long had Li Ximing hoped for Kong Tingyun to break through, to become a Daoist Master and secure the Profound Peak Gate? But the Profound Peak Gate had barely clung to life for all those years before collapsing entirely, feeding the appetites of several families. To be blunt, while the Li Clan had primarily protected the Kong Clan's bloodline, they had also taken a significant share of the spoils. If nothing else, even the formations on the island were from the Kong Clan!

But old friends had withered, and times had changed... Kong Tingyun was no simpleton. How could this ever be explained away?

Seeing Li Zhouwei staring at the box, Li Ximing's earlier joy vanished. The brocade box now felt like a scorching potato... This was an impossible situation.

'The matter with Zhu Gong... at this critical juncture...'

Li Zhouwei glanced at him and poured more tea. "The location is in Jiangbei," he said quietly. "Grand-uncle and I cannot go. Tinglan and Zhu Gong cannot go either... We don't know the specifics. In your judgment, what are her chances?"

Li Ximing shook his head and sighed. "Not low... That old fox Changxi... he's a schemer. To sacrifice Kong Haiying and leave a contingency plan in Jiangbei, he must have had a reason!"

Li Zhouwei said softly, "About Daoist Master Zhu Gong..."

Seeing Li Ximing's bitter expression and his refusal to speak, Li Zhouwei's voice deepened. "We have to save her now!"

Li Ximing's heart clenched. He focused. Li Zhouwei continued, his expression grim.

"If Kong Tingyun succeeds, things will be far from simple. It's true that the Purple Mansion masters sat down together to divide the Profound Peak spoils, but Yehui was the one who played the villain! As long as the truth doesn't get out, the official story—that the Daoist Master was ambushed while protecting the Kong family and fled to the Eastern Sea—is at least passable... We must ask about the great formation. We have to discuss everything with Tinglan. To put it bluntly, compared to Kong Tingyun, we still can't afford to offend the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition."

"Zhu Gong is backed by Tinglan and Houfu. No one is blind. The Profound Peak Dao lineage was carved up by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, plain for all to see. They must have calculated it was her... If this phenomenon hadn't appeared, me refusing to lend blood wouldn't be a big deal. Tinglan would understand. But now, after this, refusing the blood is... sensitive."

"My family has always been on good terms with the Kong Clan, which already makes us suspect. Daoist Master Zhu Gong will likely just assume we've switched sides and would rather see her dead!"

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes, reflected in the tea, seemed haunting. "Honestly, if she died, she died. It might even be for the best. But a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator is too resilient. She won't die. At worst, she'll lose her dharma-body and flee back to the Eastern Sea... hating our family. That thought alone sends a chill down my spine."

Li Ximing sighed heavily. "And now it has come to this!"

Li Zhouwei turned his cup, his expression grave. "I fear that when Kong Tingyun emerges from seclusion, she will find her sect and clan destroyed. Can you imagine her hatred? We can't provoke the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, but she can easily pursue Zhu Gong. If they fight, we will be in an impossible position."

Li Ximing pondered for two breaths. "I agree. We cannot stay out of this. The only thing we can do is try to mediate and delay the conflict between the two sides. That is also what Tinglan and Houfu want to see..."

His expression gradually calmed. "We must protect Kong Guxi and Kong Xiaxiang. The words will only be useful if they come from their mouths."

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly. "I'll leave this to Grand-uncle's judgment."

He flicked his finger, scattering the tea from his cup, leaving it empty. He turned his hand over, revealing fingertips as white as jade, which faintly glowed like pale stone.

With a thought, a slit opened on his fingertip, like a small mouth, revealing a glimpse of bone. After a few moments, a single drop of pale-gold blood mixed with red dripped out.

The instant the blood left his body, it became as round as a pill and as hard as stone. It landed in the jade cup with the crisp sound of colliding porcelain, spun twice, and stopped.

The radiance of the Bright Yang divine ability rose, surging into the cup and dyeing it a brilliant golden-white. All the divine ability and dharma power were sealed within. On closer inspection, it looked rather like a fine treasure.

Li Ximing sighed repeatedly. "Are you... injured?" he asked, concerned.

Li Zhouwei smiled and shook his head, his expression unchanged.

"It's just one drop of blood. I'll take a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill and I'll be fine with a little time. The essence blood I gave the Dragon-kin back then was the real loss. That time, I needed Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items to recover. Now, one or two pills will suffice."

Li Ximing looked truly embarrassed. He pushed the brocade box into Li Zhouwei's hands and took out several more pills for his recovery.

"I never wanted to drag you into this, but given the circumstances, it seems unavoidable..."

"Grand-uncle jests."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. He took out a jade box and pushed it over, along with the brocade box.

"Inside this box is the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll, a gift from Daoist Master Tianhuo. The Golden Feather Sect obtained it from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition also calls it the Radiant Qilin Refining Art. It's useless in my hands. Grand-uncle, please take it."

He had gestured to both items. Li Ximing was stunned for a moment, wanting to object, but Li Zhouwei just smiled, stood up, and brandished his Radiant Sun King's Halberd.

"This humble thing can't compare to a Spiritual Artifact."

Li Ximing chuckled, accepting the gift. He opened the jade box and saw a golden scroll within, its four corners embroidered with patterns like golden threads, densely covered in profound script. The moment he touched it, the texture felt fine and soft. He couldn't look away.

"This," he said, astonished, "is a true treasure!"

Li Zhouwei didn't understand the way of pills, so he didn't know the value of the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll. But Li Ximing, an Alchemist, understood with just a glance.

The author was named Cui E, from an unknown era. He was truly a gifted genius with astonishing skill in the Dao of pills. He also cultivated the Bright Yang Dao lineage and was a master of Mystic Pill techniques.

This scroll was his life's work, recording three pill arts in total: Radiant Qilin, Phoenix's Auspicious Arrival, and Void-Nature Shared-Form.

Both Radiant Qilin and Phoenix's Auspicious Arrival were exceptionally advanced. The first used the authority of Bright Yang's life-giving aspect to assist in pill creation. It detailed six types of Bright Yang pills and three types of Li Fire pills, with uses ranging from healing, cultivation, and maintenance... to even escape.

The second art, Phoenix's Auspicious Arrival, used the Bright Yang "father-son principle" to refine pills. In theory, it was similar to the Embracing-Feather Uniting-Heart Pill that Li Ximing had refined for Huo Yang in the Palace of Slumbering Li in the Zhuluo Kingdom.

However, this divine scroll contained hundreds of thousands of words on the subject. It was far more complex than the method Li Ximing had hastily derived from the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art merely to fool that Poluoduo Demon beast. This scroll was an attempt to refine true spiritual pills worthy of renown.

As for the so-called Void-Nature Shared-Form, it was a step further, but it seemed like a simplified Bright Yang version of the Heavenly Heart Oneness technique. Li Ximing scanned it. If he hadn't already obtained the Heavenly Heart Oneness art, Void-Nature Shared-Form would have been invaluable. As it was, it seemed of little use.

When Cui E wrote this scroll, his lifespan was clearly running out, but he still lamented:

'Within the Three Profoundities, pills belong to Encompassing Profoundity. I have heard that below Wanling, four palaces were established, known as the Four Secret Pill Arts, but they are long lost. If I could but read one in detail, I would have no regrets in this life!'

Evidently, Cui E also knew that predecessors had already researched arts like the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art, and he secretly regretted not having access to them.

'This Senior Cui E was clearly seeking a higher breakthrough in the Dao of pills, but in the end, it's inferior to the Secret Enclosure Sect's Heavenly Heart Oneness.'

'The Four Secret Pill Arts must be the heritage of the Encompassing Profoundity pill art... Jiangnan has Secret Diffusion and Secret Enclosure, the two 'Secrets'. The others must be elsewhere.'

Li Ximing finished reading. He folded the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll. The material was fine and soft, clearly refined with Purple Mansion Realm spiritual materials to keep it pristine for centuries.

"With this scroll, I can refine targeted pills for most of the Bright Yang resources I acquire!"

He put it away, satisfied. Li Zhouwei watched him for a moment, then reminded him, "Grand-uncle, how is your divine ability cultivation?"

Li Ximing paused. "I haven't been troubled by injuries or battles recently, just... busy. I've only just managed to 'ingest qi' for the Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart. It will be several years before I reach the Foundation Establishment Realm... let alone perfect my 'Immortal Foundation'."

Li Zhouwei was puzzled. He hesitated before saying, "Grand-uncle's cultivation speed has always been extremely fast. Could it be that your battle with Helian Wujiang damaged your qi sea? Craftsmanship is important, but you cannot neglect completing your Life Divine Ability to protect your life-mandate."

He took out the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills that the Great Xiukui Monastery had sent over a few days ago. He kept one for himself and passed the rest to Li Ximing. "These Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills are for daily cultivation. It's better to use them than to hoard them."

Li Ximing sighed. "I'm just stretched thin in so many areas. When there's a chance, I try to earn resources, but then I worry about getting into a fight and injuring myself, wasting all my cultivation. So I've been putting it off..."

"As soon as I resolve the matters at hand, I will enter seclusion for several years!"

He smiled and was about to ride off on his light, but Li Zhouwei stopped him and gave a quiet order. "Go and ask my clan-brother to come up!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. A handsome man in red robes flew up the mountain. He bowed to them both and smiled. "Greetings, Grandfather, Elder Brother!"

"Oh?" Li Ximing's delight was now visible. He sipped his tea with a smile. "So it's our Fifth Young Master, making a name for himself."

"Grandfather jests!"

Zhouming had never seen Li Ximing joke like this. He was not just flustered but utterly mortified. He managed a dry response. Li Zhouwei, however, chuckled.

"Fifth Brother broke through, emerged from seclusion, and made quite a name for himself singing on a boat."

Being teased about his minor vanity by two Daoist Masters, Zhouming actually blushed. He offered a few more pleasantries, insisting he was nothing compared to them. Li Ximing was secretly pleased. He smiled, "I still have a few things to settle. Once I've arranged matters, I'll come back and test your progress."

Though happy, he was worried about the Kong family and didn't dare delay. He left quickly. Zhouming looked like he wanted to say more. Seeing him go so soon, he was overcome with a sense of loss, standing woodenly to the side.

'A white horse charges the western ridge, a descendant awaits ascension...'

Li Zhouwei savored the thought for a moment, letting his clan-brother sit. He understood clearly. 'He truly is fortunate. As soon as Uncle Li Chengzhi passed, he immediately entered seclusion and broke through. This secretly aligns with the Bright Yang Dao of the son advancing when the father dies. Furthermore, he has an ancestor and an elder brother who wield divine ability, whose very words decide the livelihood of thousands... This is all adding to his momentum...'

...

Sacred Writ Gate.

The night was thick, the mountain forest pitch-black.

Li Ximing flew straight to Shanji Prefecture and quickly entered the sect gate. He found everything quiet. He landed on the peak. The forest around the cave-dwelling rustled, but it was deathly silent.

Yet, on this dim peak, a middle-aged man was kneeling on the steps below. His figure was almost completely enveloped in the heavy shadows of the trees, appearing as a dark mass. Fortunately, a dharma lamp nearby lit up on its own. Its light, filtering through the gaps in the trees, struck his face, creating a fractured, mottled radiance that made his eyes burn with intensity.

Li Ximing had seen this man a few times. Although he looked different now, he recognized him instantly. He paused his stride, turned slightly, and glanced down.

'Clever.'

That single glance made the middle-aged man look up, but his movement immediately slowed. He didn't dare let his gaze rise above Li Ximing's knees. His voice trembled.

"Xiaxiang greets the Daoist Master!"

This was the youngest Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator of the Kong family—Kong Xiaxiang.

The once-arrogant upward tilt of his eyebrows now drooped, and his eyes looked defeated. The face that was once spirited, quick-tempered, and impulsive had completely lost its color. It was now pale and gaunt, his eyes sunken.

In just over a decade, life in the Sacred Writ Gate had completely worn away his edges. The vitality of his youth was gone, leaving only a sorrowful skin-bag draped over terrified flesh and bone.

As a direct descendant of the Kong family, he had naturally been married off to a main-line descendant of the Sacred Writ Gate. For all these years, with Kong Guxi stationed overseas most of the time, he had been the Kong family's representative. Every stumble and every conflict ultimately landed on his shoulders.

The phenomenon that had just erupted in the north had filled him with shock and suspicion. Kneeling on the steps, he trembled, unable to speak.

Li Ximing looked at him. One glance at his complexion was enough to know that in the years of Zhu Gong's disappearance and seclusion, she hadn't had the energy to manage things. The guest-elders of the Sacred Writ Gate had clearly given him hell.

"How is Kong Guxi?" he asked.

A flush rushed to Kong Xiaxiang's face. He kept his head low. "This... this lowly one does not know."

"Why did you come up here?"

The man pressed his forehead to the ground. In a voice that was equal parts gritted teeth and weeping, he forced out a single, heavy kowtow. "This lowly one... is afraid..."

Li Ximing paused for only a second before continuing into the cave-dwelling. As he stepped into the empty chamber, the dharma lamps on either side flickered to life, illuminating the steps below. The peak remained silent, save for a faint, ghostly voice echoing in the air:

"Then keep kneeling here. Once you've endured it, you won't be afraid anymore."

Li Ximing walked inside and found no trace of Tinglan. The only one in the cave was Daoist Master Shanbai, who was calmly sorting spiritual herbs, appearing completely detached from the situation.

From the empty inner chamber, the sound of Zhu Gong's violent coughing and retching could be heard. Bright red flower petals, carried on a warm wind, gushed from the cave, whistling incessantly.

The old Daoist Master beside him used a divine ability to still the wind. His eyes, beneath white brows, watched Li Ximing quietly. He had clearly sensed the northern phenomenon as well.

"Tinglan went to the Great Xiukui Monastery to discuss important matters," he said in a raspy voice. "I'm sure Daoist Master Zhaojing anticipated this. But she instructed me... when you arrived, I am to cooperate with you fully."

Li Ximing gave a faint smile. The old man said quietly, "The world rises and falls. Such are the tides of fate. Everyone has their own burdens to bear."

Li Ximing shook his head silently. He took the jade cup from his sleeve, placed it on the old man's table, and said, "I must trouble you, Senior... Let us end this as soon as possible."

# Chapter 947: The Profound Light's Lineage

White steam rose from the golden furnace, the True Fire banked low. Three days passed, the flames extinguished, and the scent of a finished pill wafted forth.

With a soft click, Li Ximing closed the jade box in his hand. He stored the pill furnace, nodded to Daoist Master Shanbai who stood before him, and then entered his immortal cave. Carrying the box straight to the bedside, he spoke politely:

"Fellow Daoist Zhu Gong?"

The female Daoist Master, who appeared to be only sixteen or seventeen, was flushed and coughing incessantly. Her expression was hard to read as she accepted the jade box from him and replied:

"Many thanks, Zhaojing!"

She set the box by the bed, but surprisingly, she didn't comment on it further. Instead, she said:

"I see that Kong Xiaxiang is still kneeling outside the cave. He must be terrified, begging for some way to ensure his safety."

A cold light entered her eyes as she continued:

"I know what he fears. In the years I was away, a few scoundrels within the sect couldn't keep their hands clean. There's trouble brewing in the north, and they're afraid, too. They think that if Kong Xiaxiang dies, first, he can't report their misdeeds, and second, if a real crisis hits, it will force the Purple Mansion Realm experts to turn on each other. That way, they won't be handed over to appease someone's anger."

Li Ximing sighed inwardly. Zhu Gong, however, looked deeply vexed. She said quietly:

"This business with the Kong Clan... Back then, out of consideration for the aristocracy and compared to the Eastern Sea's usual methods, my actions were remarkably lenient. The Kong Clan members... I paired them with core disciples from the sect. As for Kong Guxi... I didn't harm him in the slightest. Instead, I had him dispatched overseas for his own protection..."

"But we've never had a situation where a core disciple was scattered, went into seclusion abroad, and then returned as a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. For that... I suppose I have the aristocracy to 'thank'."

Hearing her euphemistic, bitter tone, Li Ximing replied:

"What happened back then... Yehui seized the mountain, and you took it back. That was always intended as a preparation for a day like this..."

Zhu Gong just shook her head silently.

Honestly, she, Zhu Gong, would never normally fear a Daoist Master who had only just reached the Purple Mansion Realm by cultivating the Fool's Mountain Chase. If this had happened even two or three years ago, the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition would have mediated, and this whole affair would have been trivial.

But the current situation was completely different!

Her voice was a little hoarse as she said:

"Fellow Daoist, do you know the Kong Clan's origins?"

Li Ximing nodded. "The Kong Clan was once a great noble family in the Xu State. They suffered during the 'Northern Inspection' calamity, so the entire family moved south and established their gate in Shanji. Daoist Master Changxi claimed his lineage was the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains, which falls under the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition..."

As he spoke, understanding dawned, and his voice trailed off. Zhu Gong's expression was complicated. She whispered:

"A cultivator from the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains and the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition breaks through to the Purple Mansion Realm right in Jiangbei—in the Xu State's old territory, no less. And she has a perfectly justifiable, 'righteous' feud with my Muquan, and by extension, the entire Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, all in the name of 'restoring her lineage'!"

"Qi Lanyan has come down from the north, just itching for an excuse to make a move. If he can't seize this opportunity, he has no right to call himself an heir of the Viewing Pavilion faction."

Li Ximing's pupils widened slightly. He watched as the woman forced herself to sit up, her voice laced with exhaustion.

"It's been three days since the breakthrough... and there hasn't been a single word. We have no standing to go investigating. But Sword Gate certainly went. The fact that they are silent means they've found nothing."

"Sword Gate?"

Li Ximing was taken aback, but Zhu Gong had reached a level of helplessness that actually made her laugh.

"Sword Gate 'borrowed' the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain. Do you recall that, Zhaojing? The Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain is a powerful artifact of the Bound Earth Dao. Changxi must have used some method—perhaps borrowing Sumian's aid—to keep the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain from being moved!"

"What?"

Li Ximing froze, blurting out the word in shock. Zhu Gong secretly observed his reaction, confirming his ignorance before continuing through gritted teeth:

"The Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain is a treasure from beneath a great mountain of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. Setting aside its other mysteries that aided her breakthrough, its most basic function is to stabilize the earth veins, allowing them to shift without collapsing into chaos. If our guess is correct, Kong Tingyun is in seclusion deep within the earth veins of Xuanmiao Temple!"

"He was secretly using the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain to stabilize the earth veins while simultaneously converting his life's cultivation into spiritual energy of their shared lineage, all to covertly fuel her breakthrough!"

Zhu Gong's expression grew increasingly complex.

"As you know, Fellow Daoist... the earth veins elsewhere might be shattered in a fight, but not in Jiangbei. No cultivators dare wage all-out war there... and even if they tried, powerful guardians would be watching."

"This way, Kong Tingyun would be perfectly safe! Since the earth veins would remain intact, the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain could shield her during the cataclysm of his death, and afterward, its lingering effects would be impossible to detect..."

Li Ximing was horrified.

"At the time, Sumian and I were both in the sky! There were countless Purple Mansion Realm experts hidden in the shadows. How could no one have noticed?"

"Koff... koff..."

Zhu Gong couldn't help but cough.

"Sumian cultivates the Treasured Earth divine ability—the Palace of Concealed Storage. The spiritual treasure Kong Tingyun ingested was the Roaming Pass Treasured Earth, which also stems from the Treasured Earth. It was designed to resonate with his divine ability... It was all prepared long in advance. Hidden impossibly deep underground... the two of them plotted together to keep her safe."

A sudden radiance filled Li Ximing's mind as the memories flooded back, clear as day.

'Sumian didn't make a move... because he was exerting his power elsewhere... He was at Gehu Peak!'

At this realization, Li Ximing's eyebrows shot up, his heart pounding.

'In that case, the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain never changed hands. It was only borrowed. Which means Sword Gate absolutely knew!'

'There's another party that knew about this... Sword Gate!'

Indeed, he wasn't the only one to realize this. Zhu Gong's gaze was fraught with complexity.

"Perhaps Changxi never even consulted Sword Gate. He just gambled on their arrogance, betting they'd be too proud to forcibly reclaim the Spiritual Artifact and cause her breakthrough to fail. And now, it seems he was right! Even as the situation deteriorates, even knowing her breakthrough gives the north the perfect excuse to interfere, Sword Gate remains completely indifferent..."

Li Ximing seemed not to hear her, his thoughts turning bleak.

'When they sent someone to my family to demand the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain... on one hand, it was Lingmei using the opportunity to carve off Profound Peak's lakeside territories, expanding his influence within the sect while making his own arrangements outside. But on the other hand... it was probably meant as a warning to me!'

A chill flashed in Zhu Gong's eyes, and her red lips parted.

"Fellow Daoist Zhaojing, take a guess... when Wei Xuanyin personally summoned Yehui back to the capital, was this part of his plan? This chess piece... he's been watching it for a long time. He just didn't expect it to be played so soon!"

"It's true our families have a private agreement. But Yehui knows the full story. If Wei Xuanyin 'explains' the past to Kong Tingyun, blurring the details and twisting the facts just so... how will this end? Will we even get a chance to defend ourselves?"

As her agitation grew, the warm air in the immortal cave stirred, causing the nearby lamplight to dim and flicker as if it might go out. The woman gritted her teeth.

"Once Kong Tingyun is backed by the Profound Governance Pavilion... what reason would she have to listen to our side of the story? Whether she believes his one-sided tale or not is irrelevant! Even if it's a lie... they will make it the truth!"

...

The Great Zhao, Imperial Capital.

The brilliant morning sun rose from the horizon, piercing the clouds to cast down golden rays. The light streamed past countless immortal terraces and pavilions, glittering in the distance.

In the growing light, the shadowed stairs reflected a dull bronze sheen. Eighteen hundred steps spanned the flowing clouds, exuding a solemn and cold majesty.

The sunlight crept upwards, inch by inch, climbing the platform to illuminate the vast terrace with its eight gates. At last, it struck the plaque above the great hall, revealing three stark white words.

Profound Governance Pavilion

The great hall was vast. In its center stood a large, bright silver cauldron. The clear water within was still as a mirror, emitting a faint, elegant glow that reflected the calm eyes of the long-haired man seated on the high dais.

He wore a silver robe that seemed fashioned from countless individual feathers. His eyes were long and narrow, giving him a soft, androgynous beauty. A silver incense burner sat on the desk before him, beside which rested a hairpin he had just removed.

This was none other than the current Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhao, the leader of the Viewing Pavilion faction—Wei Xuanyin.

He sat quietly at the desk, his expression markedly different from the day at Luoxia. It was more formal, more severe. On closer inspection, his features appeared more masculine, lacking the soft beauty he displayed when suppressing the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition.

To the side of the main dais, only ten paces away—shockingly close in the vast hall—sat a pale silver desk. It held no spiritual treasures or fine wine, only a simple bronze tray filled with a mixture of several types of sand, all emitting a faint glow.

Seated at this desk was a woman in teal robes. Her features were fair and her bearing exceptional, but the Bound Earth divine ability around her fluctuated unstably, a clear sign of a recent breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm.

Unfortunately, her elegant eyebrows were slightly knitted, revealing her confusion and unease. But as her host had not spoken, she could only wait patiently.

"Martial Uncle!"

A bright laugh rang out from outside the hall. A young man strode in, dressed in a Daoist robe of white with gold trim, emblazoned with black clouds and profound patterns, and cinched with a purple silk sash. His arrival made Wei Xuanyin raise an eyebrow. He said softly:

"Martial Nephew, you've retrieved it."

Qi Lanyan entered with a smile, turning slightly to reveal the people behind him.

Two junior cultivators in black caps followed, holding a jade tray upon which rested several thick, golden volumes. Qi Lanyan adopted a formal tone.

"I consulted with Junior Sister and have respectfully retrieved the Genealogical Records of the Mystic and Profound Immortals of Zhaoyao Mountain. It required ritual incense and purification, which caused the delay. Please forgive me!"

"Of course."

The teal-robed woman replied hastily. Wei Xuanyin glanced at her with a smile, showing no arrogance. He simply said:

"Please begin."

The woman spoke respectfully.

"The founder of the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains was named Luo Yuan. He was a disciple of Great Daoist Master Lü Bai of Tongxuan Palace. He came from the Shu region and spread his teachings in Luoxia."

"Zhou Zhaozi received the transmission and passed it to Li Bi. Three generations later, Li Bi's line entered Ning, where the Dao was passed to Zhao Yan. Zhao Yan passed it to Kong Xia. The lineage then transitioned from a sect to a clan for ten generations, until the ancestor Daoist Master Changxi, Kong Yanxi, achieved his divine ability."

This woman was none other than Kong Tingyun, who had vanished after the anomalous phenomenon in the north!

Qi Lanyan picked up the genealogical scroll, glanced at it, and said:

"Great Daoist Master Lü Bai did indeed perish while striving for the Auxiliary Position, and he had a disciple named Luo Yuan. While it's not the orthodox line of the Viewing Pavilion faction, it is a genuine lineage."

Kong Tingyun kept her head lowered, remaining silent.

When she emerged from her breakthrough, this Daoist Master Qi had appeared from the earth veins, claiming to be from the same Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition. He insisted she return to the north with him to formally acknowledge her ancestors.

Kong Tingyun could tell at a glance that this Daoist Master's cultivation was profound and his divine abilities were terrifying. A bucket of cold water was instantly dumped on the joy of her breakthrough. Her request to visit her sect was flatly denied—Profound Peak Gate, he told her, had already been carved up and divided.

The news almost made her cough up blood. But the Daoist Master's power was undeniable, leaving no room for argument. Kong Tingyun had no chance to even hesitate before she was half-coerced, half-escorted to this Profound Governance Pavilion.

And here, she was met by an even more terrifying Great Daoist Master!

Kong Tingyun was not unobservant. Setting aside the man's peak-level divine ability, even the various Spiritual Artifacts on his desk were treasures far beyond her reach. This only deepened her suspicion and alarm.

Her ancestor Changxi had spent the first half of his life rushing about, calling in favors and making inquiries, but not a single great family would acknowledge their Comprehending Profoundity origins. No one would admit the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains was an ancient Daoist tradition. Yet now, the moment she broke through, people from the Profound Governance Pavilion were at her door.

'I'm afraid they just want to use me!'

For now, she could only stand silently to the side, not daring to speak, listening as the Great Daoist Master spoke casually:

"A pity there are no portraits or detailed lineage charts. It all remains questionable... However, she is ultimately from the former Xu State and broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm in Jiangbei. She should be registered with the Profound Governance Pavilion on that basis alone, to say nothing of cultivating the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition."

Wei Xuanyin was being strict, setting the terms by this rule. Qi Lanyan nodded and said respectfully:

"According to this junior's understanding, this Daoist Master Changxi was affected by the True Monarch's northern inspection. His clan suffered a great calamity and fell into decline. He was the one who began its revival."

Wei Xuanyin showed a flicker of interest and nodded.

"So, a man of some destiny. What was his cultivation? The Bound Earth transmission is strict; I imagine his cultivation wasn't very high."

Qi Lanyan bowed quickly and replied:

"Martial Uncle is correct. He was in the early Purple Mansion Realm and cultivated the Fool's Mountain Chase. However, he was overeager in his pursuit of the Dao and used some unscrupulous methods in his youth. Unfortunately, this involved Maha and was discovered by the Nian Clan."

"They reported this to 'That One'. 'That One' was already displeased with Changxi's tendency to boastfully claim credit for his minor involvement in the True Monarch's affairs. This new transgression was intolerable. Fortunately, He did not intervene personally, but likely sent someone to issue a private warning. After that, Changxi became timid and never dared to overstep again."

At this, Wei Xuanyin raised his eyebrows slightly. But Kong Tingyun felt her world collapse, her mind going blank.

'What?'

'How... how is that possible?!'

Kong Tingyun knew her ancestor was no saint and had plenty of schemes, but she had always assumed they simply failed, forcing him to submit and resulting in his death as a mere early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. She never imagined this was the true story!

Connected to the Nian Clan of Yue Cultivating Sect... and referred to as 'That One' by these two powerful figures... who else could it be?! She was intelligent and guessed the identity at once, her heart freezing with dread.

'These two brought me thousands of miles... They wouldn't invent such a story just to deceive me. And... there were many suspicious things about the past... Could it be that Ancestor was waiting for Him to fail a breakthrough... Is that why he trained successor after successor, wasting his final years?'

Wei Xuanyin seemed to notice her reaction. He closed the book in his hand and asked with mild interest:

"What is it?"

Qi Lanyan was equally perceptive. He smiled.

"It was Junior Sister who noticed. Logically, 'That One' isn't an overbearing person, and Changxi was old enough to command some respect. But when Changxi met 'That One', he was so terrified he couldn't even lift his head, his respect bordering on obsequious. We investigated later and found he had dealings with Maha of the Way of Great Desire. After 'That One' slew the Maha, that Maha never dared venture south again. Changxi must have received a warning at that time, too."

Kong Tingyun's pupils widened. But Wei Xuanyin simply shook his head with a small laugh and said lightly:

"Enough... The past is the past. Take her down and explain the current situation. At the very least, we should first help her get her clan members back."

He smiled, and a gentle, androgynous beauty instantly animated his entire face.

"And after that... we must take back her sect's mountain gate, hmm?"




# Chapter 948, Sun-Worshipping Mountain

His question broke her silence. Kong Tingyun bowed.

"Thank you for your concern, my lord… But when my Ancestral Master fell, no one was left in the sect to bear the burden. Countless contingencies were laid. This matter of our mountain gate… it may have been promised to another family long ago. It requires careful consideration… I must consult with old friends."

Wei Xuanyin turned his head and smiled. "That is only natural. We will bring your people back first. As for your territory, Martial Nephew Qi will arrange it."

Qi Lanyan nodded with a smile and gestured for Kong Tingyun to follow.

"Daoist friend, please… come to my side pavilion first. I will fetch the records for you to review. Much has happened in Jiangbei these past few years. Once you are caught up, I will accompany you."

Kong Tingyun could only nod in agreement and withdraw quietly. Qi Lanyan turned back and sighed.

"That Daoist Master Changxi… he was always a shrewd schemer, just held in check by that person. To have a change of heart in his later years and manage to produce a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from his remaining resources… I truly miscalculated. If I had known Kong Tingyun would be this useful, I would have met with Changxi long ago."

"You are not to blame."

Wei Xuanyin unrolled a scroll, picked up his brush, and said quietly,

"We can only adapt to the situation. Fortunately, it isn't a major issue. If anyone is at fault, it should be me. I visited Maha Liangli of the Sea of Desire that year to inquire about his injuries and actually heard of this Changxi. Who could have imagined that a washed-up rogue cultivator from a ruined household could have prepared such a contingency?"

"Whether he was guessing blindly or had true foresight, he has ultimately handed us leverage. And this Kong Tingyun is a smart woman. We hold the complete set of divine abilities that match her cultivation, and we control the political tide of the north and south…"

"By following us, she can connect with the Immortal Dao's Viewing Pavilion, reconnect her Dao Lineage, obtain vast resources, and reclaim her mountain gate. Without us, her only choice is to betray her own heritage and destroy her future. She would become an exile, or be forced to bow her head in humiliation to the Supreme Yang, becoming a demonic cultivator who must devour others to survive. She will see the truth clearly."

Clearly, the master of the Profound Governance Pavilion had known about Daoist Master Changxi all along; he had just been playing along with his Martial Nephew. Qi Lanyan lowered his head and said respectfully,

"In truth, we have many pretexts. We don't need her. It's simply that she is the most convenient, and this pretext is the most righteous and justifiable. It's the one most likely to make the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition lose their footing and alienate their allies."

Wei Xuanyin frowned.

"Bai Ziyu… was he involved back then as well?"

Qi Lanyan nodded silently, looking at his Martial Uncle seated above.

"It's good to have another person to deploy. It will keep Jiangbei from having only his voice. As for the history between those two, even if they cooperate, they will never be true allies. It creates a balance, making them easier for you to manage."

Qi Lanyan quickly assented, offered his thanks, and withdrew.

...

Eastern Sea.

A blazing Heavenly Light and a hazy azure light approached from the west. The Demon King Qingyan's gaze was deep and thoughtful, while Li Ximing was silent, a hidden worry clouding his features.

After leaving Zhu Gong, Li Ximing knew the situation had mostly escalated into a problem for the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. As he waited for Zhu Gong to take the pill, he began to plan.

'Regardless, I have no news, and I can't just wait here idly. I must settle the matter of the pill as soon as possible, and then make a trip to Qize.'

He retrieved the Yuan'e Soft Armor from the lake, gathered some more valuable spiritual materials and dharma artifacts, and then went to Tiger's Frontier to retrieve Qingyan.

Before long, a man in white robes rode the wind to meet them, asking with a hint of anxiety, "Daoist friends… how did it go?"

The moment Liu Changdie saw the Demon King Qingyan's expression, he understood. But then he noticed Li Ximing still looked troubled, which confused him. He asked cautiously, only to see Li Ximing force a smile.

"The pill is a success!"

A heavy stone lifted from Liu Changdie's heart. If the refinement had failed, he truly wouldn't have known how to face Fuxun. Not only would his own conscience have bothered him, but it would have created a deep awkwardness between Fuxun and Li Ximing.

As Liu Changdie relaxed, Li Ximing also adjusted his mindset.

'At least that trouble is their trouble to bear. My own crisis is still in the north. I need to focus on my own affairs…'

He offered his congratulations, and then the man and the demon rode the wind, taking flight. After flying for a while, a thought struck Li Ximing. He turned serious and said,

"I have many pressing matters on the mainland. Since the pill is finished, I won't make the extra trip. I must ask you two Daoist friends to deliver it for me."

After all, he had obtained his Li Fire and refined the necessary pill. There was no need to travel thousands of miles to Poluoduo. He took out the jade vial, sealed with a divine ability, and handed it to Liu Changdie, saying gravely,

"Be careful on your journey!"

Liu Changdie had already noticed his expression was off. Although he felt it would be better for Li Ximing to be present to personally receive the thanks for such a favor, he didn't press the issue. He sighed and replied,

"You've worked hard… Don't forget what I mentioned before, about the nurturing spiritual resources."

Li Ximing certainly hadn't forgotten; the Neck Feathers were an excellent item. He seized the opportunity and immediately asked,

"After you go to Poluoduo… will you be busy with other important matters, Senior?"

Liu Changdie stroked his beard and laughed.

"I'm just an idler. What could I possibly be busy with? If you can arrange the time, I'll wait for you at Fenkuai. As it happens, I've just negotiated a formation repair job there, so I'll have plenty of time. Whenever you're free, just find me at the usual place."

Liu Changdie was genuinely kind. Of all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators Li Ximing knew, not one had ever offered to help him and then waited patiently. Li Ximing was deeply moved.

"Thank you, Senior!"

Liu Changdie shook his head with a smile and, together with Qingyan, strode into the Great Void. Li Ximing rode his light, speeding all the way, and soon arrived in Wu State.

This wasn't Li Ximing's first visit to Wu State, but he had never been to its southernmost region, Qize. He saw a vast, dark, and gloomy swamp. The morning sun was rising, its light reflecting in the fragmented wetlands below, creating countless golden shimmers.

He flew for a while and finally spotted Sun-Worshipping Mountain. It was hardly tall; in Jiangnan, it would barely pass for a hill. There were few buildings, scattered sparsely on the barren slope, giving it none of the aura of an immortal abode.

The moment he landed, someone came to greet him and led him to the summit. A wave of heat washed over him as expected. Fierce flames raged, and a great cauldron stood at the peak, glowing with crimson light.

Dingyang Zi came to welcome him with a look of surprise.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing! A rare guest indeed!"

He stretched out his hand, tossed the item he was holding to several attendant cultivators, and led Li Ximing down to a small building on the side.

The building was extremely crude, looking as if it had been scorched by fire a couple of times. It wasn't pleasant to look at, containing only a few tables and chairs. Dingyang Zi poured some tea and asked,

"Daoist friend, is the pill finished?"

In person, the old man's speech was not as fluid or eloquent as it was in his letters; he seemed quite stiff. Li Ximing didn't bother with pleasantries either. He took a jade box from his sleeve and gently pushed it across the table.

Dingyang Zi lifted the lid, examined the contents closely, and finally broke into a smile.

"Daoist friend, your alchemy skills are truly formidable!"

Li Ximing replied with a smile, understanding that this Daoist Master wasn't one for small talk or flattery. He was all business. Li Ximing revealed a suit of gleaming scale armor in his hand, cupped his fist, and said,

"Senior, please take a look at this!"

Dingyang Zi looked quite satisfied. He put away the pill from the box and took the Yuan'e Soft Armor. He first swept it with a divine ability, then infused it with dharma power, causing the scales to stand on end.

He frowned.

"Gloom-Profound Sky Iron, Radiant Core Stone, Wolf Scale Bone, and Bright White Feather. Refined with True Fire."

With just a single glance, he had identified every material used to forge the scale armor. He turned it over twice and said bluntly,

"Aside from the Gloom-Profound Sky Iron, not a single one of these materials is worthy of note. The refinement technique, however, is passable."

Li Ximing wasn't surprised, just inwardly bitter.

When the Li family first acquired this dharma armor, it was treated as an incredible treasure. But from his current perspective, he could see that unless it was an ancient dharma artifact, it was ultimately lacking. Moreover, this item was originally modified from the helmet of a Murong cultivator's Gloom-Profound Armor. The Azure Pond cultivator assigned to reforge it... aside from the Gloom-Profound Sky Iron that was part of the original, why would they have added any other good materials?

He couldn't help but shake his head. "In your opinion, Daoist friend, how can this be improved?"

Dingyang Zi examined it again.

"As it is... it's barely qualified to be refined into a spirit embryo. Other than the Gloom-Profound Sky Iron, the rest of it can't be kept. It would be better to melt it down, extract the Gloom-Profound Sky Iron, and re-forge it completely..."

Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then touched his storage pouch. A pile of glittering items spilled out onto the table. Dingyang Zi swept his sleeve, picking out only a few of them.

Two of them were congratulatory gifts from other families when Li Zhouwei reached the Purple Mansion Realm; the ones he selected were both from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, Radiant Wildscale and Magnificent Raiment Stone-Bone. The other two items were a saber and a spear, both ancient dharma artifacts, the Circlet Spike and the Bright-Flame Saber—dharma artifacts of the Secret Diffusion Dao Lineage, taken from Bai Yinzi.

'Only these items are presentable…'

Dingyang Zi picked up the Bright-Flame Saber and praised it, then turned back.

"If we break these items down, we can gather enough materials. As for the rest, that will depend on your clan. With only these, and without any Purple Mansion-grade materials, it will never touch the level of a Spiritual Artifact. At best, we can customize a high-quality dharma artifact for you to refine into a spirit embryo."

Fortunately, Li Ximing had come precisely to discuss this in advance. He said seriously,

"I'm showing you the style today because I want the new one crafted like this scale armor. I know you haven't finished refining your Spiritual Artifact, so this is still a ways off. If you have any suitable materials on hand, or if you come across anything appropriate while trading with other cultivators... please acquire them for my family. This is a long-term plan!"

Dingyang Zi stroked his beard, nodding thoughtfully.

"I do have a small portion of Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold on hand. It was left over from forging a sword accessory for a sword immortal. It's marginally suitable, but it is extremely valuable… As for Bright Yang spiritual materials or resources… I have none."

"There's no rush." The Li family possessed a Purple Mansion-grade resource, also a type of scale, gifted by the Kong family, but unfortunately, it was of the Pit Water attribute and unusable. Li Ximing took a brocade box from his sleeve, revealing a pearl-like white stone inside. "This is a Six-Phase Spirit Stone of the 'True Qi' path," he said in a low voice. "It is suitable for all True Qi Daos and should be useful as an alternative."

Only then did Dingyang Zi show a hint of consideration. Li Ximing let him look before putting it away and taking out another box. Inside lay three long, metallic-looking white feathers. Li Ximing said seriously,

"These are Neck Feathers. I will leave them with you as a deposit. First, to show my sincerity. Second… if anyone comes to you to forge a treasure, and you see they have suitable spiritual resources, please trade for them on my behalf!"

Li Ximing understood clearly. Just as he, an Alchemist, frequently encountered consumable Purple Mansion-grade resources, Dingyang Zi must encounter far more refinement materials than he ever could. Rather than searching to the ends of the earth, it was better to trade with him! Since he had already agreed to design the armor, Li Ximing decided to swallow his pride and entrust the matter to him.

Dingyang Zi saw his intention and took the jade box. The two exchanged jade talismans, and the old man stroked his beard.

"I understand..."

Li Ximing smiled and said quietly, "If there is anything I can help you with, Daoist friend, please don't hesitate to ask..."

His tone then shifted, becoming serious.

"But the 'Upper Shaman' spirit embryo you promised me back then... is there any news?"

Dingyang Zi shook his head.

"How could it be that fast!"

Li Ximing had used the Viewing Pavilion faction's rapid refinement method, accelerated with a spiritual extract from the Xiukui Dao. Dingyang Zi was from a different Daoist Tradition and certainly wouldn't use such precious extracts for him, so of course it would take much, much longer. As Li Ximing realized this, he felt a pang of regret.

'I faced two major crises in a row and was forced to create the spirit embryo ahead of schedule. It cost me two portions of the Shield of White Sun spiritual extract… If I hadn't been in such a hurry then, I could have used those two portions for this armor instead…'

But before he could dwell on it, a sound came from outside the pavilion. Dingyang Zi excused himself and quickly welcomed someone in. The old man's expression changed instantly, becoming cold and hostile. "He's right here," he snapped. "Ask him yourself!"

Li Ximing looked at the person who entered. With a full head of gray hair and wearing black robes covered in brown circular holes, he was instantly recognizable. Li Ximing smiled. "Daoist Friend Luo! Have you been well?"

"So it's Brother Zhaojing!" The man was none other than the demonic cultivator from the Southern Borderlands, Daoist Master Luo. He looked pleased to see him, then sized him up in astonishment. "It truly is the Dao of Proliferation. Your dharma body... it's already fully healed!"

Daoist Master Luo had probably assumed he wouldn't have been willing to use the pill. Li Ximing had taken it, but he wasn't about to reveal his wealth. He just laughed it off. Sure enough, Daoist Master Luo was indeed after the spirit embryo. "I've passed by this place several times and seen that treasure on the altar… I'm truly envious…"

But Li Ximing suddenly remembered something. He cut him off with a smile, not giving him time to ask any more questions. "Daoist friend, take a look at this!"

He produced an item in his hand. Inside a box, layers of flowing clouds concealed a faint, yellowish-white light. It was the Marvelous Wisdom Whisker gifted by Liu Changdie!

The Marvelous Wisdom Whisker was a spiritual item of the 'Gathering Wood' Dao. And in all of Jiangnan, the only cultivator of a 'Gathering Wood' Dao Lineage that Li Ximing knew was Daoist Master Luo himself.

As expected, when Daoist Master Luo saw the spiritual item, his smiling eyes froze. He stared at it intently for a moment, then said with astonishment,

"Marvelous Wisdom Whisker… Daoist friend, have you been to the Western Sea?"

These Purple Mansion Realm figures all had deep knowledge of their own Dao Lineage's origins. He had hit the nail on the head. Li Ximing was unwilling to mention Liu Changdie, so he just said, "I acquired it by chance. Can you use it, Daoist friend?"

"To say I can't use it... that would be impossible." Daoist Master Luo seemed to be studying its quality. He finally spoke, his voice absent-minded, his eyes never leaving the spiritual resource.

"Put yourself in my shoes, Daoist friend. If you saw a Bright Yang spiritual resource, even if you had no immediate use for it, wouldn't you want to acquire it? It's just a matter of price..."

Li Ximing knew the man was cunning and smiled inwardly. He snapped the jade box shut and sighed.

"I see... I just thought it was a rare chance to run into you, and I happened to have a spiritual resource from your path! But it seems you have no use for it right now!"
