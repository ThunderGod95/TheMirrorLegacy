# Chapter 1099: The King Removes His Cloak

Raging black flames reflected in the sky and on the earth, but the first to hesitate was, unexpectedly, Touba Ci.

The sight of this shared aura, this identical Dao lineage, stunned Touba Ci where he stood. Even if he had heard rumors that Li Zhouwei knew this Profound Essence Art, how could he possibly believe the man possessed his own family's fundamental law?

The Dharma Body before him hadn't been refined with any heavenly materials or earthly treasures, but there was no mistaking its form. His mind went blank, and he was momentarily thrown into disarray.

'Is that... the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body?'

But Touba Ci had no time for doubt. All the illusory black-gold light between heaven and earth converged, focusing on him. His opponent's Dharma Body surged forward, and flames of Profound Qi descended from the sky!

"Boom!"

The two colossal figures slammed into each other like collapsing mountains, igniting an inferno of limitless flames. Touba Ci felt his Dharma form shudder violently, and a dark anger rose in him.

'He's fighting so aggressively! What did the Song Emperor promise him?'

The Profound Qi was the Grand-Beginning Demonic Dao of the twelve Qis. Normally, its light manifested in all sorts of variations to overcome an enemy. But when both sides possessed Profound Qi Dharma Bodies, a direct clash like this would only burn away their respective Dao-Profundity!

He frantically tried to recall his treasured seal, only to find the Dharma Body before him scattering like the wind once more. The blood-red faded, replaced by a deep crimson. The thick darkness overhead reverted to roiling black clouds. What approached him was not his prized seal, but an expanse of brilliant white and a dazzling Heavenly Light:

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

Riding the wave of the Light of Karmic Dissolution and Pure Yin from the dissipating Crimson Severing Arrowhead, this divine ability had already reached the crown of Touba Ci's enormous demonic head!

Although Li Zhouwei had broken through Changxiao Gate and his Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body had greatly improved, there was still a definite gap between him and a great demon cultivator like Touba Ci, who had been nourished by countless treasures in a grotto-heaven since childhood. He naturally wouldn't compete in a head-on collision. The Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body had been nothing but a feint!

"Rumble!"

A cloud of bright white dust exploded across the sky. The violet-cyan radiance was instantly slammed into the ground, setting off a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering blast!

Audience with the Celestial Gate possessed the power to suppress and destroy demons. Amidst the violent tremors, the massive Demon, caught utterly off guard, immediately spat blood. It collapsed to the ground, immobilized, as roiling Profound Yellow Qi streamed from its body, flooding countless hills.

Tinglan couldn't help but shoot a glance sideways, just as a low voice sounded by her ear:

'Aid Zhaojing! Lock down Vast Cicada.'

Without a moment's hesitation, Tinglan reacted. Her hands formed a seal, and the silver mirror at her brow flew out once more. Sensing the celestial secrets, it unleashed a dazzling silver sea of lightning!

This Spiritual Artifact originated from an ancient lightning palace and possessed extraordinary power. Tinglan then waved her sleeve, flinging out two streams of blue-cyan Immeasurable Water and Fire that smashed into the divine abilities of the two Daoist Masters on either side of her. She vanished into the Great Void, stepping far away.

In that same instant, a dark black canopy unfurled across the sky, following just behind the sea of lightning, swallowing up Changyun and Gao Fangjing once again.

The surrounding landscape vanished instantly. A deep desert stretched out under wildly sweeping winds. That brilliant Celestial Gate already stood beneath the setting sun, pinning the cyan-grey Demon so firmly it still couldn't get up. The black-robed youth stood right in the center of the Celestial Gate, bathed in a radiance that pierced the heavens.

"Clang!"

The youth planted the halberd in his hand into the Demon's back, where its fumes of qi roiled. His golden eyes swept across the distance, and he let out a breath, as if he had just resolved a lingering worry.

The breath exhaled, and the youth's figure vanished.

Changyun, clad in a Daoist robe, felt a sudden chill rush into his mind. A thread of fear sprouted in his heart. He took a step back and raised his hand to form a seal, but his eyes already reflected a blinding golden light.

"Dong!"

The spirit bell protecting him was sent flying like a high-velocity arrow. Though his fingers were forming a seal before his chest, the crescent-shaped golden tip of the halberd had already, terrifyingly, appeared right between his fingers and his sternum.

"Puchi..."

Changyun felt an immense force strike him. The Dharma Art in his hands dissipated instantly as his body was flung high into the air. The golden halberd tip protruded from his back, its blade a full foot long.

Only at this moment did his spiritual sense finally register the man before him.

What black robe? Li Zhouwei was finally clad in armor and cloak. The black robe had transformed into a set of ferocious armor, etched with dark-gold profound patterns. On his vambraces, the emblems of pouncing qilin flickered. A light-purple feathered Campaign Cloak, billowing with streams of True Qi, floated around him.

Bright white markings climbed his neck like breathing veins, or perhaps like dense scales, reaching all the way to the corners of his eyes.

Sovereign's Perilous Tread.

'How can he be so fast? Even Sovereign's Perilous Tread... it shouldn't be like this!'

Changyun was no ordinary rogue cultivator. This was simply too hard to believe.

Li Zhouwei, however, was not the least bit surprised. At this very instant, he was stronger than he had ever been. Even the him from two breaths ago could not have dodged this strike.

The boon from the Primal Summit could resonate with the Crimson Severing Arrowhead; the Campaign Cloak of King Wei supplied him with True Qi; and Sovereign's Perilous Tread was empowered by the Crimson Severing Arrowhead's light. But most critically... with Tinglan's departure, the chaotic melee had finally become an organized siege. Sovereign's Perilous Tread at last sensed the White Qilin's fate. Its power surged, and a dark tide churned beneath his Dharma form.

Although he was only at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm, his opponents were far more numerous and powerful than those he had faced in the past. The boost he received from this three-on-one siege had already surpassed the one from fighting Shilou Yingge, reaching a full sixty percent.

And so, this Daoist Master, who acted as a petty king in Watersign Ridge and often ignored official summons, had no time to react at all. He hung as powerlessly from the Grand Ascension as a corpse skewered by cavalry in the thick of battle.

Changyun’s breath caught in his throat. He had time for only one reaction. His divine ability flared!

Golden Beast Plume!

Like an immortal undergoing Feather Transformation, a pair of wings unfurled from the Daoist's back. He fluttered upward, his eyes as bright as snow, his neck as long as a crane's. Transcending the mundane, he shed his Daoist robe, leaving it impaled on the halberd as the magnificent golden-feathered beast soared into the sky.

But Changyun felt no relief, only a creeping horror. Li Zhouwei's golden eyes were fixed on him, glowing in the darkness like two brilliant golden gems. The eclipse sign at the center of his brow was now complete.

The setting sun in the sky fractured again. This time, it didn't dissolve into a sky of black-gold light streams. Instead, it condensed into tangible pillars of black-gold light that rained down from the heavens, slamming into the beast's back and belly.

"Aooo..."

The golden beast let out a heaven-shocking shriek that could pierce metal and shatter stone. A Daoist umbrella materialized above it, but before it could open, a faint golden shadow followed.

The Pure Yang Bracelets.

"Dong!"

The umbrella was knocked staggering, just as expected, but it displayed outstanding quality, managing to halt the Pure Yang Bracelets and force them to return.

'But that's enough!'

The Emperor Qi's Light, condensing all the brilliance of heaven and earth, had already smashed onto the golden beast's back.

Li Zhouwei immediately retracted his gaze, his eyes narrowing slightly. He spun the golden halberd, its smooth surface reflecting another face rapidly closing in from behind:

Gao Fangjing!

The man was already upon him.

Li Zhouwei stood as immovable as a mountain. The roiling True Fire washed over him in an instant, but it only caused a flash of radiance to shimmer across his armor.

Primal Molt.

This divine marvel was born from the Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough within the armor. It was the most orthodox of Yang Cusp Arts. Empowered within the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, its power flared, causing his figure to vanish. He reappeared behind Gao Fangjing, raised an eyebrow, and brought the halberd down in a crushing blow.

'Insignificant tricks!'

"Boom!"

This Daoist Master of the Gao family had only recently broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Taking a direct hit from the Body Divine Ability that sensed fate, his own divine ability immediately collapsed. He was sent plummeting at a speed even faster than his approach, crashing violently to the ground.

"Clang!"

Only then did a waterfall of golden blood rain down from the sky. The golden beast finally let out a mournful cry and smashed heavily into the great desert. One gold, one fire, both hitting the ground at the same time.

"Hmph!"

The golden-eyed man turned his head in defiance and left, returning to his position atop the Celestial Gate. He stomped down.

The fiend, who had just managed to straighten up and push the Celestial Gate off him, immediately collapsed, falling flat on the ground once more with a world-shaking thud.

"Rumble!"

Touba Ci was again left humiliated in the dust.

Li Zhouwei felt the fiend's enraged shaking beneath his foot but didn't spare him a single glance. His gaze was fixed on the distance, his words as cold as ice.

"The Gleaming Gold Feather-Beast. It can fly up, but not down. Once it descends, it falls to earth, where it is often imprisoned and slain by the Baleful Earth."

Li Zhouwei had read about Changyun's Golden Beast Plume. Although it wasn't from Changyun's own Dao lineage, its flaws and weaknesses were identical. As long as this divine ability was knocked out of the sky in one go, its power would be drastically reduced for a long time, perhaps even becoming impossible to summon.

This was one of the reasons Li Zhouwei had targeted Changyun first.

Touba Ci was undoubtedly the strongest of the three. This Liang descendant, a king's nephew, was a ranked expert among mid-Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Although he had been a step behind from the start and repeatedly immobilized, his Great Pass Azure-Soul Dharma Body made him extremely difficult to injure.

As for Gao Fangjing—the man's surname was Gao, after all. Firstly, Li Zhouwei was showing him some face, afraid of actually killing him. Secondly... keeping him around to empower Sovereign's Perilous Tread was far more beneficial to the next phase of his plan. It was much more useful than heavily wounding him and chasing him off early.

That left only Changyun. Not only did the man lack any real fighting spirit, but while his spell arts were formidable, he couldn't withstand close-quarters combat.

'Moreover... both Touba Ci and Changyun are proud and arrogant. How can they not fly into a rage after being humiliated like this?'

As if to confirm his thoughts, an intense golden light, so bright it seemed to want to pierce the heavens, rose from the depths of the desert. Changyun's cold laugh, its sincerity impossible to gauge, echoed across the sky.

"I would very much like to ask the White Qilin for some pointers!"

The golden light flared. The Daoist-robed man was already soaring high, golden blood dripping from his mouth. The golden light at his brow transformed into a massive, sweeping pillar of light that came crashing down.

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Good!"

He stood firm with his halberd, not retreating an inch. A brilliant radiance shot from his own brow, piercing heaven and earth.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

Golden light and Heavenly Light collided in the sky, scattering infinite multicolored halos across the dark canopy. Golden blood gushed from Changyun's mouth, but his expression was one of high spirits.

'The divine ability is strong, but its grade is too low!'

Sure enough, though the golden light stalled for a moment, it was steadily moving forward, its downward momentum growing faster and faster.

At the same time, bright flames erupted. As if infected by the combatants' fighting spirit, the True Fire no longer hesitated. It gushed from the desert depths, shooting upward to blast the golden-eyed man's chest.

As Purple Mansion Realm experts, who among them would not seize a combat opportunity?

The roiling demonic qi of the Dharma Body shattered, revealing Touba Ci's true form. The man propped up the Celestial Gate, his face pale. He coughed two drops of amber blood onto his sleeve. As the sunset's glow cast upon his face, his expression shifted, and a small smile touched his lips.

"Great Baleful Heavenly Radiance Secret Art!"

The Celestial Gate trembled as if a colossal force was rising from the earth, surging upward like ten thousand men joining forces to topple it.

Three pillars of light surged as one, shattering Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, and slammed into the black-armored man.

Li Zhouwei smiled. He grabbed a corner of his Campaign Cloak and held it in front of him.

"Boom!"

The great desert sky-domain finally shattered. The setting sun vanished, and the scenery of Baixiang Valley reappeared. The Crimson Severing Arrowhead was finally broken. The Great Song's King Wei fell from the sky, plummeting toward the earth.

The three men didn't hesitate for a second. They stepped forward together, each sealing off a direction. The Daoist held his profound umbrella, shining with golden light. The prince conjured a red feather, sensing the celestial phenomena. The imperial descendant devoured demonic qi, holding his halberd. Together, they activated their arts to seize the initiative, giving him no possible chance of escape.

But the man merely let the Campaign Cloak he had pulled before him fall open. On his travel-worn face, his golden eyes shone like stars. He smiled.

"Crimson Severing Arrowhead."

As if in answer to his call, the pitch-black canopy immediately enveloped the earth. The setting sun rose once more, and all the scenery fell back into the Yang Cusp. The three men's expressions changed. A flicker of doubt crossed Changyun's face.

'He released it himself!'

The Crimson Severing Arrowhead was formidable, but not to the point where it could be recast the instant it was broken. That left only one possibility: Li Zhouwei had done it on purpose.

Changyun's cautious nature magnified his suspicion. He looked down and realized that Li Zhouwei was not the only one standing beneath the setting sun—there were also five enormous, uniquely shaped golden bodies of Buddhist cultivators.

Five Merciful Ones.

This left Gao Fangjing bewildered. Touba Ci stood frozen on the spot, his battle intent evaporating into pure confusion and astonishment.

"Is he... is he suicidal?"

Li Zhouwei's Crimson Severing Arrowhead wasn't a grotto-heaven. While it was inconvenient for those trapped inside to traverse the Great Void, forcing them to calm down and break a part of the divine ability before escaping, it didn't completely sever the connection...

Five Merciful Ones in formation could easily neutralize most of Li Zhouwei's attacks. In front of all of them, Li Zhouwei was nothing but a fish on the chopping block!

But the golden-eyed man only pulled his halberd from the desert sands. His eyes flashed with an irrepressible, vicious pleasure. He laughed.

"Again!"

His laughter shattered the quiet. The five Merciful Ones snapped out of their daze, their faces twisting with greed. Sabers, swords, spears, and halberds—all descended at once.

"Clang!"

The Grand Ascension Halberd swept across the sky, parrying all five flashing golden artifacts. An endless storm exploded in the desert. Li Zhouwei held the halberd with both hands, his face turning only slightly pale.

The deliberate provocation, the designed fall into the valley, the maneuvering, the show of weakness—it was all for this very moment. In the next instant, his golden eyes turned a pure, endless, piercing white-gold.

Sovereign's Perilous Tread!

The White Qilin's fate-sense had reached ninety percent completion.

The danger of this situation was even greater than the day he faced Gongsun Bei. The connection to the White Qilin's fate surged to its absolute peak, even overflowing, pouring down in a glorious, exhilarating flood.

But what Li Zhouwei had to face in return was an overwhelming deluge of divine abilities from the Immortal, Demon, and Buddhist paths.

Under this torrent of arts, he didn't hesitate. He didn't summon a treasure or use an escape art. Instead, he made an extremely peculiar move.

He unfastened the Campaign Cloak from his body—the one adorned with light-purple feathers.

That was all.

Beneath his feet, the Audience with the Celestial Gate erupted, carrying with it infinite radiance and a sky full of golden armor and robes. The only response to the assembled cultivators was the Celestial Gate, standing tall in the air.

"Rumble!"

The Campaign Cloak, draped over the Celestial Gate, trembled violently under the barrage of divine abilities. It quickly dimmed and fell away. The bright Celestial Gate, which could suppress all things, began to tremble next. It seemed to melt within the terrifying pillars of light—where gold and fire clashed, where immortal and demon energies annihilated each other—but it held its ground, relying on the mutual cancellation of the enemy attacks and the protection of Li Zhouwei's own heavy Spiritual Artifacts and divine abilities.

But it could not last.

"Kacha..."

A crack finally appeared on the Celestial Gate, spreading down through the layers of Heavenly Light.

Li Zhouwei, however, was gone.

In an instant, the world dissolved. The sky of Baixiang Valley reappeared. The Audience with the Celestial Gate remained where it was, but the Great Song's King Wei—in his qilin-patterned black armor, his eyes a solid platinum—materialized at the very edge of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead's desert domain.

He lightly hefted the golden halberd, his arm stretching like an ape's. With a burst of strength from one hand, the Grand Ascension shot forward, whistling through the air like a sky-piercing dragon.

The colors of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead gushed forth again with barely a pause. This overloaded, unceasing opening and closing made the setting sun in the black sky flicker erratically. The divine ability itself was being damaged, but the roiling desert extended at an incredible speed. Not only had he escaped the encirclement, but the colors of this second extension gently enveloped a monk at the domain's other edge.

Vast Cicada.

The sheer breadth of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead was astounding. Even if its offensive power was concentrated at the center, any point within its reach could be used for teleportation. Two uses of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead's movement were more than enough for Li Zhouwei to land right in front of Vast Cicada.

His target—it had always been him.

His intentional provocation while trapped by Touba Ci's group was to ensure that when he dispelled the Crimson Severing Arrowhead to draw in the Merciful Ones, all three would follow him, not turn to attack someone else. Then, using their momentary surprise, when they weren't attacking with full force, he used the Audience with the Celestial Gate to take his place and bear the brunt of the assault.

All of this was to push the White Qilin's fate-sense to its absolute peak—to gain that ninety percent boon! This ninety percent boost was practically a second Body Divine Ability. Even after leaving the battle formation, its power would take time to fade, giving him ample time to strike.

He thought coldly, 'Guzhou Cauldron locks the Great Void. Precious Tusk is exiled. Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion seals the four directions and fixes the present world.'

The monk raised his head in disbelief. Above him, the Guzhou Cauldron had already locked down his divine arts one by one. To his side, the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion had sealed off his every escape route.

All that remained in his vision was the pitch-black sky, the prostrate setting sun, the roiling desert, and the dazzling, whistling halberd hurtling toward him like an enraged dragon. Behind it was a comet-like brilliance and a pair of piercing, platinum-white eyes.

In this moment of absolute crisis, Vast Cicada could only open his lips in a useless gesture.

The White Cicada in his mouth twitched. The gash from the halberd strike was still visible on its body. But no matter how he tried to sense it, he could no longer connect to the treasured land that had always watched over him.

The Exiled Qi was the Lord of Obscurity and Gloom.

If he had connected to Precious Tusk earlier, even if he was now suppressed by the Guzhou Cauldron and Precious Tusk itself was in danger of falling, he would at least have its blessing to protect his life. But the Guzhou Cauldron had appeared early, making no attempt at ambush, for the sole purpose of ensuring that from beginning to end, he could not receive a single drop of blessing from the Precious Tusk Golden Land.

Under such a crisis, Vast Cicada, who had run rampant across the north relying on the Precious Tusk Golden Land, was utterly helpless. He couldn't even rely on Precious Tusk to beg its Dharma Realm master for help.

Even his pagoda... was being suppressed by Li Ximing's Celestial Gate.

"Kacha."

The Grand Ascension had arrived.

The halberd was merely a spirit embryo, but empowered by Li Zhouwei's full strength, the resonance of Sovereign's Perilous Tread, and the White Qilin's fate, its power was already terrifying. Furthermore, Li Zhouwei had just 'escaped'—a perfect trigger for Sovereign's Perilous Tread.

The halberd seemed to have transformed into an indestructible Spiritual Treasure as it met the golden spear.

"Weng..."

The powerful Bright Yang divine ability instantly bent the Li Fire spear to its limit and violently flung it aside. The halberd pierced clean through the monk's chest, taking with it a spray of glazed, glass-like fragments. Vast Cicada's pupils dilated to their widest. His organs shattered. Cracks spiderwebbed across his brow.

A single strike. Suppressed by a top-tier contemporary Spiritual Treasure and a Spiritual Treasure of the Supreme Yang Dao lineage, Vast Cicada was already powerless.

Despair was still brewing in his eyes as the man in profound-patterned black armor, as ferocious as a qilin, descended from the desert sunset. The long halberd in his hand—the Radiant Sun King's Halberd—glowed with a thick light as it fell directly upon his smooth, shaved head.

Li Zhouwei's throwing of the Grand Ascension was not random. Regardless of whether it succeeded, the Grand Ascension's arrival served as a king's declaration of war, an edict to execute a rebel.

This follow-up strike, therefore, was no sneak attack. It was the Bright Yang Dao, openly and righteously declaring his crime before his execution.

Splitting Light!

Blinding splendor converged on Vast Cicada's head. His facial features dissolved into hollow voids, erupting with brilliant Heavenly Light. Jade and agate poured from his lips and teeth. His ten fingers, like icicles in deep winter, broke off one by one, transforming into brown-yellow bamboo tubes, the classics within them rustling audibly.

The monk seemed to be roaring, but not a single sound escaped his mouth. In this bright, infinitely murderous moment of his demise, Vast Cicada's final wisp of thought was not regret, nor resentment, but sudden, piercing comprehension.

'The King removes his cloak; the cicada sheds its husk. The Great Fissure is at the pass, the Yang Cusp is in the thrust. The White Qilin... is demonstrating the Dao for me! The White Qilin is demonstrating the Dao for me!'

He was right. Of all of them, only Vast Cicada, who also cultivated the Bright Yang Dao and possessed profound Dao-Profundity, could see Li Zhouwei's actions most clearly. Only he understood how exquisite it all was. The Campaign Cloak draped on the Audience with the Celestial Gate wasn't just a Spiritual Artifact used to block attacks and protect the gate. It _represented_ the thrust of the Yang Cusp. It _was_ the husk that the White Cicada shed.

This final halberd strike was the most perfect articulation of Li Zhouwei's Dao-Profundity and his connection to his life-mandate.

'So... so this is how the Crimson Severing Arrowhead is cultivated... I understand... Master... I can pass the Purple Mystery... I understand! Master...'

'I don't need to cultivate Buddhism... Master!'

But his last, whimpering thought went unanswered. The overwhelming tide of jade and glaze began to disintegrate. The leaping qilin pattern on the Radiant Sun King's Halberd blazed to an impossible brightness. Heaven and earth fell into absolute silence.

In that instant, even the pink illusory colors weaving through the mountains and the endlessly circulating Jade True light seemed to freeze. Everything stopped. The sky over Baixiang Valley was shrouded in black clouds, heavy with what felt like divine wrath.

The clouds roiled endlessly, an unprecedented, unseen phenomenon. They were like a thick cushion, or perhaps the fluttering hem of a celestial robe, layered and infinitely oppressive.

Yet, from a crack in these impenetrably thick clouds, a sliver of Buddhist light suddenly shot down. As if in anger, as if in warning, it pierced the gloom, passed through the Exiled Qi, and illuminated half of the Great Song King Wei's face.

The four realms trembled.

The man's golden eyes, half in light and half in shadow, gazed at the sky. Behind him, the infinite glaze of the fire prison shattered. A sarcastic smile touched King Wei's lips.

'My lord, a move once played cannot be regretted.'

The King unfastens his cloak; the cicada sheds its husk.

To step from the capital into the domain is to kill.

# Chapter 1100: A Great Fissure Upon the Body

"Boom!"

The earth shuddered. A golden shadow plummeted from the heavens, crashing into the mountain peak with such force that stone fragmented and Li Fire scattered everywhere. The famed Li Fire Golden Spear, a weapon of terrible renown in the north, was embedded in the center of a spiderweb of cracks, its shaft trembling faintly. Its light had dimmed, a pale imitation of the brilliant golden halberd still blazing in the sky.

The man with golden eyes and ink-black armor stood silently in the air. His luxurious Campaign Cloak was gone, and his domineering, bright long-halberd had fallen into the valley below. His lips were a shade paler than usual. With only a single halberd in hand, he was far more terrifying than when he had arrived in full regalia, striking all the cultivators present breathless.

"Boom!"

Thunder continued to rumble through the world. The gloomy clouds seemed to lighten. The dark, illusory sheen of the Guzhou Cauldron flickered across the sky for a moment, then vanished.

A susurrus filled the air as white sand and glazed glass began to fall from the sky. The sand, fine as dust, poured down like a blizzard, blanketing the entirety of Baixiang Valley. Thousands of glass shards tumbled down, some as large as a man's head, others bright as stars, weaving together like rain.

And in this storm of glass, a vast shadow fell over the land.

It was a head, large as a mountain, crowned with a flesh-usnisa shaped like a lotus.

Vast Cicada's Dharma Body was peculiar. It seemed less cultivated by his own power and more borrowed from an external force. In the instant its light collapsed, it didn't immediately disintegrate. Instead, it fell from the sky like a meteorite.

The countless monks, golden halls, and palaces that once stood upon his head—like the shimmering facades of two grotto-heavens—were now dull gray. The palaces had collapsed. His mouth gaped powerlessly, the space between his interlocking, razor-sharp teeth now empty.

The White Cicada that had once crouched in his mouth was gone.

A single line, gleaming gold-to-white, appeared on his usnisa. It ran down through his brow, over the bridge of his nose, across his lower lip, and extended all the way to the raw, severed stump of his neck.

"Boom!"

As the colossal head struck the valley floor, it toppled sideways. The two halves of its face slowly pulled apart, then fell wide with a deafening crash, exposing the jade-like matter of the brain and bone within.

Cleft in two, a Maha had fallen.

'Vast Cicada is dead. One strike.'

The entire Baixiang Valley fell into a deathly silence. Li Jiangliang, standing near the corpse, felt a chill creep through his entire body. He turned to his brothers. Li Jiangxia was frozen in place, speechless. Li Jianglong simply watched, his face a mask of silence.

The same, incredulous thought rose in all three of their minds:

'One halberd...'

Changyun quietly pressed his palms together, a look of understanding on his face. Touba Ci, however, seemed blinded by the scorching golden light, staring in raw disbelief at the corpse's gray-white pupils. Even one as proud as he was struck silent.

'...'

'He died! He died without even connecting to the Precious Tusk!'

'Is... is he even human?'

Who was Vast Cicada? He was the master of the Precious Tusk Golden Land. To put it bluntly, he wasn't just the darling of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm; he was a figure the entire Buddhist cultivators' Daoist Tradition kept its eye on, someone personally watched by the Lord of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm himself...

His death wasn't just the death of a fifth-reincarnation Maha. It meant that the Precious Tusk Golden Land—a prize the Buddhists already had in the cooking pot—had just sprouted wings and flown away, lost from their grasp once more!
His death was comparable to that of a seventh or even eighth-reincarnation Great Maha!

Gao Fangjing felt his head spin. He didn't dare look up, keeping his gaze lowered.

'We were all played... The Emperor of Wei used a single Crimson Severing Arrowhead to toy with the Baiqiang until they crossed the Taoshui four times to their doom. Now that same divine ability is in _his_ hands, and he treats Touba Ci and Changyun as if they're nothing... They even ended up helping him...'

The same question surfaced in everyone's mind.

'Do we still fight?'

But the most terrified, the most incredulous, were the five Merciful Ones. No one even spared a glance at the crack-covered Audience with the Celestial Gate. As the white sand and glass rained down, four of them hesitated, then turned in unison to stare at the fifth.

This was the Merciful One from the Bodhisattva seat—Vast Cicada's own attendant.

The attendant's golden face was ashen. He stood frozen, as if in a nightmare. He couldn't comprehend it... in the span of a single turn, his own Maha... a dignified fifth-reincarnation Maha, had been struck down!

The Precious Tusk was lost, fled... but his own position was still tied to it, still bound within Vast Cicada's 'locus'!

Back when the Wrath manifestation fell and the Buddhist Land was sealed, even the esteemed Dharma Protector of the northern Demon-Subduing Temple, Wrath's direct disciple, was left half-dead, forced to live on with a paralyzed Dharma Body... What hope was there for the already-faltering, insignificant Precious Tusk?

He had only a moment to show his despair before the illusory light of his body vanished. His life-mandate gushed from him like a ruptured dam. In the space of a single breath, he screamed and exploded into a fine mist of blood.

No glass, no golden sand. As if he were nothing but a mortal.

But that one scream caused the silent Baixiang Valley to suddenly shudder. A pure white sword-light shot skyward, only to be met by countless pink pupils exploding in the air. A glittering, precious pearl burst, shattering the azure-white light to pieces. The thousand-eyed golden body standing on the hill vanished abruptly!

That Maha, seeing the tide turn, hadn't made a sound. He abandoned his treasure, paid a steep price in blood, and simply fled.

'What's left to fight? Vast Cicada is dead, and he was the one holding the Precious Tusk!'

Zhelu found the situation so unbelievable it was almost comical.

'The South's plan... they don't move, but when they do, it's terrifying. After that execution, Li Zhouwei is merely a little pale, his divine ability only shaken... What does that even mean? It means the North just lost Vast Cicada—a man whose combat power ranked in the top three here—for absolutely nothing!'

With one side waxing and the other waning, it was enough to overturn the result of a major battle. To say nothing of the other cultivators... what would they think after seeing this? The Guzhou Cauldron was still flashing. Who'll be the next to be exiled by it and die completely?

He, Zhelu, wasn't about to gamble on whether these 'immortal cultivators' had some other way to restrain Li Zhouwei!

The instant Zhelu, the strongest among them, fled, divine abilities of every color exploded in the sky as their casters scattered. Before the roiling dark clouds could envelop the earth, one golden body after another brazenly self-detonated. The northern Daoist Masters fled for their lives amid the earth-shattering blasts of light.

But the enveloping speed of Yang Ruizao's Guzhou Cauldron was terrifying. It spread in a flash. Those far away, or those who had been caught in the Crimson Severing Arrowhead earlier, were better off. But the Merciful Ones who were close, struggling against the three Holders of the Profound, had no time to self-detonate. They didn't even have the _right_ to.

Amidst the brilliant, shattering light, one was struck by the Exiled Qi and perished on the spot. The remaining two stood frozen, speechless... The terrible flames of Lightless Water and Fire still burned on their bodies. There was no road to heaven, no gate to earth.

Under the curtain of white sand, the Great Zhao's forces routed, collapsing like a landslide, scattering like the tide.

Whether it was Chen Yin, who had been facing Helian Wujiang, or Xianyao, who had been struggling under Murong Yan's assault, they had only been managing a desperate delay. Now suddenly liberated, they retreated in disarray, exchanging looks of shock and profound relief.

Chen Yin, his face somber, his hand on his sword; Xianyao, silent and grim; Tinglan, her expression one of pure astonishment; and even Liu Bai, who had arrived with his sword on his back. All of them looked at Li Zhouwei. Any words of praise or shock died in their throats, leaving only silence.

'This was Yang Ruiyi's plan all along...'

'From start to finish, it was an act. An act put on by Yang Ruiyi and Li Ximing... Scheming that involves Dharma Masters isn't like ordinary affairs. They kept all of us in the dark...'

And then, of course, there was Daoist Master Zhaojing—Li Ximing—striding through the air toward them, head high and a broad smile on his face.

'Heh!'

The Daoist Master had already put away his golden pagoda. With a wave of his sleeve, he began meticulously picking through the falling glass, retrieving a white-skinned, gold-edged Profound Drum and a Valley Water glazed lotus throne. He used another divine ability to snag the tattered kasaya, with its gaping hole, from where it lay on the ground.

Now, with a slight crook of his finger, the golden spear on the ground leaped into the air. Like a young swallow returning to its nest, it flew into his grasp. Seven chi and five cun long, its colors were dazzling, wreathed in roaring flame. A truly fine treasure!

Naturally, no one would dream of fighting the Li Clan for these spoils. Li Ximing gathered them with evident satisfaction.

But his good cheer didn't stop him from noticing the cracks on Li Zhouwei's Audience with the Celestial Gate. Forgetting for a moment how satisfying Vast Cicada's death was, he sent a slightly worried, private transmission.

'How bad is the damage?'

Li Zhouwei remained perfectly still, appearing gravely injured and struggling to regulate his breathing. In reality, his body was a raging torrent. Illusions flickered at the edge of his vision, flaring into existence only to be extinguished.

The feedback from Illuminating Sun and Moon!

The feedback from slaying Vast Cicada was immense. If his Dao-Profundity had already surpassed Daoist Masters like Helian Wujiang—who focused primarily on spell arts—when he first emerged from seclusion, he had now taken another enormous step. He had left Helian Wujiang far behind, reaching what could be called the third rank.

The problem was that while Chen Yin had once classified cultivators like Chi Buzi and Changxiao as the 'second rank', Dao-Profundity was difficult to quantify. The more profound it became, the vaster and more difficult the path. The gap between someone like Chi Buzi and Helian Wujiang was terrifyingly large—you could fit two Azure Pond Sects in that gap, and then some.

After this battle, Li Zhouwei had a much deeper appreciation for the benefits of profound Dao-Profundity. It was a subtle, pervasive advantage in both cultivation and combat. He was in no hurry.

'It was only Vast Cicada... There will be other chances. I've now reached the immortal threshold of the Purple Mystery. I have plenty of time to stir up a storm.'

He gave Li Ximing a slight nod.

In truth, his condition was not good. Though his expended dharma power and divine ability were rapidly replenishing as the battle concluded, the damage to his Audience with the Celestial Gate was causing his Shengyang Acupoint to throb with excruciating pain, sending tremors through him again and again.

'Audience with the Celestial Gate is powerful, but it wasn't meant to be used that way. It can't withstand that kind of abuse. Anyone else who took that hit would have their divine ability crippled, needing more than a decade of nurturing to recover. Fortunately, my foundation is solid, my preparations were thorough, and I had the Campaign Cloak... It's manageable.'

The injury was neither light nor severe. It had already recovered partially when the Crimson Severing Arrowhead was withdrawn. Furthermore, his White Qilin fate had been pushed to its peak, and the success of Perilous Tread had granted him immediate feedback, applying an additional ninety percent progress to the repairs...

'I estimate this feedback will stabilize the divine ability within three days, making it usable. In three months, the injury will be minor, and the feedback will be exhausted. After that, I'll nurture it myself and take some pills. I'll be fully recovered within a year.'

'It's just a shame the Pure Qi from the Profound Vastness Art can only repair the Dharma Body, not a divine ability. Otherwise, this would be even faster.'

Seeing his elder nod, clearly relieved, the King Wei, the center of everyone's attention, casually accepted the long-halberd, delivered by a qilin condensed from rolling mist. He reversed the weapon's grip, and his golden eyes traversed the distance, landing on the two Merciful Ones. Cloaked in fire and water, they were as still and terrified as quails.

'All of this... is immortal merit...'

Seeing the gaze of this veritable god of slaughter fall upon them, the two men turned deathly pale. Just as the curved blade began to turn, Yang Ruizao finally stepped out from the crowd. He bowed respectfully.

"Your Majesty, I ask you to stay your hand—they must be captured and presented before the Emperor."

Yang Ruizao's seniority was considerable, but he was still intimidated by Li Zhouwei. He kept his gaze lowered, not daring to look at him directly. Fortunately, the King Wei nodded. He produced an edict from his sleeve and spoke.

"Tinglan, Zhaojing. Return and reinforce at once. Defend Tongmo and the Western Mountains. Be wary of Western Shu making another move."

Li Zhouwei's arrival had achieved the objective of routing the Buddhists, but the South's overall strength was still a step behind. Their position remained dire. The network formed by Xuanmiao and Shanji was like a nail, simultaneously invading Jiangnan and stabbing into the flank of their current positions at Tangdao and Sanjiang. It was an awkward predicament.

'And the Qing Clan is notoriously fickle. They wouldn't hesitate to probe eastward again to weaken the gains made by the Great Song... It's inevitable.'

When it came down to it, in the hearts of men like Li Zhouwei and Chen Yin, the security of their own territories would always come before the Great Song. If a true crisis emerged, they wouldn't hesitate to abandon their current, glorious victory.

To appease these concerns, Yang Ruiyi had already dispatched Wenqing of Purple Smoke. With this arrangement clearly in place, the two accepted the order and immediately departed. Reassured, Li Zhouwei addressed the remaining group:

"Baixiang is taken and the Zhao cultivators have scattered. But Baiye is still a threat at our flank, with Xuanmiao at its back. If they send troops, our rearguard will be thrown into chaos. I ask you all to guard Baixiang Valley. Use the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter as a pocket to menace Baiye and Xuanmiao."

They all agreed. Only then did the King Wei turn to Liu Bai, a smile touching his lips.

"Protector-General, I ask you to coordinate with me. From east and west, let us break the siege of Tangdao together!"

...

Golden light filled the world.

East of Guanlong, north of Luoxia, amidst the sprawling yellow earth and the vast, rolling terrain of the Taihang Mountains, five great peaks rose. Their summits were bare of trees, crowned instead with countless golden temples. This was the Radiance Dharma Realm's Five Peaks Mountain. Its highest point was the Qingliang Terrace.

Atop this Buddhist terrace stood innumerable golden statues. To the side, the western terrace was the Precious Tusk Terrace. It, too, hosted countless temples and even more monks. Many cultivators could be seen flying to and fro, taking up temporary residence there.

At this moment, however, the atmosphere on the Precious Tusk Terrace was bizarre. Monks hurried back and forth, their steps chaotic. Some whispered in hushed tones, others spoke with unconcealed hatred. One Great Virtue even collapsed, vomiting blood, and was hurriedly carried into a temple.

Through the din, an old monk hurried up the steps, his face a mask of terror. He pushed his way into the highest temple. In the center stood a statue, golden-eyed and red-bodied, emanating infinite radiance. A qilin crouched beneath its seat. It stood ninety-nine zhang and nine chi tall, just one chi shorter than the Supreme Statue on the Qingliang Terrace.

To the side stood another statue, that of a handsome monk with clear, fine features, his form a pure, unstained white. It stood fifty-five zhang tall. But now... a single gold-white line snaked down from the statue's smooth crown, disappearing into its collar.

The meaning of this sight was terrifyingly clear.

"My lord!"

The old monk felt his world collapse. He fell to his knees with a thud, weeping uncontrollably, half-mad with terror. After crying for a long moment, he scrambled back to his feet and stumbled out, wailing:

"Quickly, go and get... go and get the Youngest Martial Grand-Uncle!"

But all at once, the chaos in the temple ceased. A pair of simple cloth shoes stepped into the hall. A young monk in black robes helped the old man to his feet. His expression was complex as he gently wiped the tears from the old man's face, then raised his gaze to the fractured statue.

The statue looked as if it might shatter at any second, yet some invisible force held its form together, keeping it whole. The dense network of cracks seemed almost a decoration, settled perfectly and harmoniously upon its body.

Only the kasaya remained unbroken.

The black-robed monk watched for a moment before stepping forward, his hand outstretched. As if summoned, the kasaya on the statue began to dissolve into a brilliant cascade of light, pouring onto the floor like a resplendent waterfall. The young monk's eyes were rimmed with red.

"A Great Fissure upon the body," he said quietly. "Martial-Nephew's wish has been fulfilled. This cannot be called a death filled with regret."

# Chapter 1101: The Precious Tusk Affair

The golden hall echoed with nothing but wave after wave of sobbing. The black-robed monk's words left the other monks bewildered, unable to comprehend. Outside, golden light continued to flare and overlap in the sky, only to cascade downward, one streak after another.

Fachang ascended the steps from the front of the hall.

The Dharma Realm was riddled with factions; some sought the ancient paths, others invested in new arts. This Maha, Fachang, guarded an old heart, trying to protect the Dharma Realm's interests, and as a result, he pleased no one. He was a lone figure even within his own order. As he entered the main hall, his face was slick with cold sweat.

Even if he and Vast Cicada weren't particularly close—the entire Great Adoration Dharma Realm had suffered this loss!

'Vast Cicada was killed by the south!'

The thought sent a chill from his scalp to his toes. He approached Kongshu and bowed low, his voice thick with grief and terror.

"Grand Martial Uncle!"

Kongshu's gaze remained fixed on the residual image, and he said nothing for a long time.

Fachang frantically waved his sleeve, banishing the disorderly crowd of wailing, prostrating monks from the hall. He sealed the doors. In an instant, the candles flared to life, and all aural chaos was shut outside. Only then did Fachang drop to his knees.

"Grand Martial Uncle," he wept, "what are we to do?"

At last, the monk Kongshu turned his head.

"What to do?" he sighed. "The moment Li Jieyi agreed to go south, scheming against another's life-mandate, he should have known this day would come. How can one plot to take another's life and expect to keep one's own?"

Sweat poured from Fachang like rain. Even one as obstinate as him couldn't spare the energy to debate the point. He just lowered his gaze.

"But... even if he died as a consequence of his own karma... Precious Tusk!"

Forget the entire world, forget all Buddhist cultivators—within the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, was there any high-ranking member who didn't know of their Realm Lord's designs on that Golden Land? On a small scale, this was just Vast Cicada losing his life. On a grand scale... a major operation of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm had been sabotaged!

Seeing Kongshu's continued silence, Fachang could only grit his teeth.

"Our life-mandates are fragile and our Dao-Profundity shallow. We cannot perceive the shape of such great matters... much less discern the will of heaven. We only wish to ask Grand Martial Uncle... What is the status of Precious Tusk right now?"

"Contact has been lost. What else could its status be?" Kongshu replied, leaving Fachang speechless.

Losing contact with a Golden Land was nothing new. The most recent case was the Qin Ling Golden Land. That particular Golden Land had an origin even more profound than Precious Tusk's! It had been the seat of power for the great master who had synthesized the demonic and Buddhist paths. And though the Wei Emperor had shattered it with a single decree... the legacy it contained remained terrifyingly rich.

When that Golden Land was in the hands of the Wrath Aspect, it was known as the sharpest of blades, its might unparalleled. But after the Wrath manifestation collapsed overnight, the illustrious Dao Lineage of Qin Ling could only sense a single, pitiful Merciful One position. Neither their own Realm Lord nor the masters of the other aspects could do anything about the hidden Qin Ling Golden Land. To this day, it remained lost.

Fachang understood exactly how catastrophic this loss was.

"This matter..." he choked out, "the Master of Tanshan has never cared for our affairs. But I fear... I fear this will enrage the Realm Lord. Among the five peaks, not only will they lay the blame on Precious Tusk, but the voices demanding a southern campaign will grow ever louder..."

"Now, we won't even be able to suppress the other Daos, and we ourselves will be dragged into the mire... How much more killing karma must be generated!"

Seeing Fachang's utterly desolate expression, Kongshu shook his head.

"It is not quite so dire as that."

He shifted his gaze to the statue of the Undefeated King of Brightness in the center of the hall.

"Back when Great Wei stood," Kongshu said quietly, "the Wei Emperor and the six-surnamed kings of Guanlong often feasted in the Central Long Gardens. They raised White Qilins there. When Wei fell, the Shangguan family broke open the gardens, and the White Qilins scattered. Most, however, were slain by powerful cultivators. One of them made its way to Qingliang Terrace. The abbot at the time named it 'Shengming', hoping it would achieve greatness."

"Later, when the Undefeated King of Brightness achieved his station, this White Qilin was gifted to him as a mount. They ultimately died together. But what few know is that this White Qilin senior fled and died upon Qingliang Terrace—and it left behind many words."

Fachang froze, his eyes widening in horror.

"If that's true... then the truth of Emperor Liang's drowning... Qingliang Terrace..."

Kongshu fell silent for a moment, shooting Fachang a warning glance before continuing.

"This senior passed away in the mountains. His final words were: 'He who succeeds Precious Tusk shall be a King Cicada descendant.' He then dissolved into endless Heavenly Light and Li Fire, leaving behind a single Sarira on the terrace. It was shaped like a White Cicada, and they called it the 'Shengming Precious Tusk Stone'."

"That single sentence... it protected a descendant from that branch of the Undefeated King of Brightness. At the time, this descendant was hiding with the Tao family. To escape the chaos of war, they all changed their surname to Tao, pretending to be members of that family."

"And Vast Cicada... he is a direct descendant of that line. His study of the Immortal Dao... was, in fact, done in secret, under an old Daoist Master from Seeking the Purple Pavilion."

Fachang's disbelief was total. "Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect? The Dao Lineage of the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch?"

The sweat on his face grew heavier. He finally connected the dots.

"...Li Jieyi could have studied at the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect... He was a Tao, after all. I heard back then that he was humiliated by Bai Ziyu, and couldn't bear the insult after just a few words. So that was the reason. To think... a disciple of the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect, the very sect that most despises Buddhist cultivators, was ultimately forced to enter our Buddhist Path..."

Kongshu's expression was complicated.

"His master was merely a person from the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect."

"As his cultivation neared its bottleneck, unable to comprehend the Purple Mystery, his master also perished. It was then that he met our Dao's lord. He bowed to the Shengming Precious Tusk Stone and entered the Buddhist Path to unseal Precious Tusk. But the reality of it was far less glorious..."

The black-robed monk let out a low sigh.

"And he... upon first entering the Buddhist Path, his ambition was already too great. He even entertained the idea of cultivating the demonic path. After all, in the eyes of those Immortal Dao cultivators... the demonic is at least the opposite of the immortal. Anything but falling so low as to join the Buddhist Path."

"To that end, he insisted on refining a flawless, perfect Dharma Body, refusing to settle for anything less. But he feared it would take too long, leaving him without sufficient combat strength in the present. So, he went into the Precious Tusk Golden Land and selected the head of a past worthy to use..."

"It was precisely because of this act, and his divided heart, that the Precious Tusk Golden Land never truly acknowledged him. Aside from his own Maha position, the number of other positions it granted him was pitifully small."

"The lords were, in fact, very dissatisfied with him over this. But, having no one else to use, they merely postured, pretending they might reclaim Precious Tusk and find another... He was held over the fire, which is what forced him to rush south in search of an opportunity."

Fachang let out a visible sigh of relief.

"May the Revered One protect us... May the Revered One protect us... In that case, this might not be such a bad thing. The Shengming Precious Tusk Stone is still in our hands. Though Precious Tusk is out of contact for now, surely it will one day return..."

He looked genuinely relieved. But Kongshu's expression remained heavy.

"You are wrong."

Fachang looked up as the black-robed monk continued, "The Seven Aspects may not have needed Vast Cicada. But his absence is a disaster for the Dharma Realm. The Seven Aspects still have leverage over Bright Yang. With Vast Cicada, our Dharma Realm could have supported him, contended with the Seven Aspects, and maintained our involvement. Now that he has perished—and with no descendants in the Tao family—we have lost that right!"

"We must wait until Compassion and Great Desire make their moves, achieve their victories, and apply pressure through Mount Dayang..."

"Doesn't the Great Desire Dao have a Bright Yang bloodline in their possession? If they prop that person up, and our mountain has no one of Vast Cicada's stature to counter... then for the sake of the greater good, we may be forced to hand over the Shengming Precious Tusk Stone for them all to share. It will go from being the property of our Dharma Realm... to a treasure carved up by all Seven Aspects."

This black-robed monk was truly formidable. Not only was he brilliant, but he was completely unbound by dogma. He had, almost single-handedly, deduced the most likely course of the future.

Fachang was speechless. He knelt in a stupor for a long time before gritting his teeth.

"Vast Cicada... Vast Cicada! So greedy, so wicked! He hadn't a single shred of cultivated virtue in his heart, yet he possessed a desire to swallow the heavens! Now, everything is ruined because of him!"

Kongshu remained noncommittal. He simply helped Fachang to his feet. 

"Regardless, he was a Maha of our Dharma Realm. Find someone to make a trip south. Go to where his body fell. Retrieve a piece of his Dharma Body, so that he may be properly enshrined..."

Fachang nodded mutely.

Kongshu, however, merely smiled.

"You need not despair. The one who truly needs to worry right now... is Qi Lanyan."

"As for Precious Tusk..."

The monk's face was serene, his eyes lost in thought.

"In the end, it will find its way to the one who deserves it."

...

Moongaze Lake.

The sky churned with rolling colors. A thick, oppressive purple blanketed the heavens, warring with the myriad colors from the west and casting down pulsing halos of light.

Moongaze Lake had weathered many disasters, but they were almost always concentrated on the northern and eastern shores. The western shore, after all, was backed by the Western Mountains, and the southern shore by Mount Dali. For ages, both had been free from external threats. They were peaceful, prosperous regions.

The western shore, in particular, was rich with mineral resources. Back in the Azure Pond era, when Daoist He had governed the shore, he had established rules that prevented most conflict. Later, when the Li family retook the west, the Yang family acted as intermediaries, allowing them to secure it without bloodshed. The place had never even suffered the schemes of the southern clans. The appearance of one or two demonic cultivators was the extent of its troubles. It had known peace for hundreds of years.

But today, upon the peaks of the Western Mountains, countless banners snapped in the wind. Amidst the roiling clouds, the glittering golden character for 'Shu' was faintly visible. Enormous flying vessels sliced through the air as legions of cultivators descended on the wind, their gazes cold.

The entire western shore erupted into chaos. War cries tore through the sky as battles broke out everywhere. The deduction made by Yang Ruiyi and the two Li family members had been correct. The soldiers of Shu had arrived.

Li Ximing prized the safety of Moongaze Lake above all else. Vast Cicada's reputation was simply too rotten. He couldn't be certain that the man would head north after emerging from the White Ye Immortal Sect. What if he took the risk and came south, striking at Moongaze Lake? That would shatter the Li family's very foundation.

Thus, as arranged by Yang Ruiyi, Li Ximing had initially remained at Moongaze Lake. Unlike Li Zhouwei, who had already prepared to move north, Li Ximing was still on the river when he personally witnessed the White Ye Immortal Sect's ambush force move north, not south. Only then did he finally depart, arriving at Baixiang one step behind Li Zhouwei.

Left to stand guard in his place was Daoist Master Wenqing of the Purple Smoke Grotto-Heaven, specifically to defend against Western Shu.

At this moment, the Daoist Master held a Purple Qi Dharma Conch, locked in a battle of arts with a white-robed Daoist Master on the Western Mountains. Her opponent, wielding a treasured blade, looked perfectly calm. He was none other than the Great Shu's Military Commissioner of the Desert Pacification Army—Daoist Master Ni Hongyan.

This Daoist Master had once been a staunch supporter of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition and was close to Sword Gate. He also recognized Purple Qi. Now, leading an army against Daoist Master Wenqing, he fought with a casual ease, clearly holding back.

Hongyan, after all, possessed two divine abilities. He had not only received a Dao Lineage from Sword Gate but had also acquired numerous techniques from Changhuai. With both supporting him, his strength was truly formidable. He felt no pressure at all dealing with Wenqing. He was, in fact, intentionally showing mercy.

In the sky, Daoist Master Wenqing knew her opponent was going easy on her. The complex emotions in her heart were indescribable.

'To think it would come to this...'

She, Kan Ziyu, had been a direct disciple of Purple Smoke, a woman of high status. She had even been friends with Cheng Gao and had visited the Ni clan as a guest. This very Daoist Master Hongyan... he had met her back then. He had even entrusted his own direct grandson to her, to cultivate under her tutelage.

'That boy was named Ni Zan. He returned to his clan long ago and should be in the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm by now. If the world were as it was a hundred years ago, Hongyan and I would be the closest of friends.'

'And now... we are here, fighting to the death.'

Her heart was a knot of conflicting feelings. She had no way of knowing that Daoist Master Hongyan, who appeared so calm and collected, was suffering his own internal earthquake of boundless panic.

He, Hongyan, had not achieved the Dao all that long ago. He had attained his divine ability in the same year as Tu Longjian, and only then because of a generous gift from Sword Gate. Without that spiritual item from the old Sword Gate Daoist Master, Hongyan would be nothing but a pile of dust.

Ever since Qing Jifang had stationed him in the great desert, Daoist Master Hongyan had felt something was wrong. And just as he'd feared, now that an army was needed to cross the Western Mountains and attack Moongaze Lake, he was the one they had sent.

Daoist Master Hongyan knew exactly what was happening.

'How many schemes could that bastard Qing Jifang possibly have? He knows I've always been close to the Dao traditions of Yue State, so he sends me to lead the attack and forge a blood feud with the Li clan!'

His heart went cold, and he trembled.

'He's just like his father—pitifully petty. This is revenge. This is his reprisal for what happened that day! He's killing the chicken to warn the monkey!'

Back when Great Song was founded, Li Zhouwei had been ennobled as King Wei. Qing Jifang had brought him and Li Muyan east...

Daoist Master Hongyan had private ties to the Tanshan Li Clan, so he had a decent understanding of Li Muyan. That old fox, in his bid to protect his clan, had come with the express purpose of provoking Ting Province. It was just that Li Zhouwei's divine ability proved too terrifying. He nearly beat Li Muyan to death, forcing him to scream for Qing Jifang. That, in turn, forced the Daoist Master from Mount Changhuai to come out and take the beating himself, causing him to lose immense face.

Li Muyan, satisfied, had returned to his mountain to recuperate. But Daoist Master Hongyan, who had merely sat back and watched the tigers fight, unwilling to commit his full strength, had been marked by Qing Jifang. This, today, was the result.

Qing Jifang knew perfectly well that Hongyan wouldn't go all-out. But the flying vessels behind him and the soldiers at his feet wouldn't be part of his act. Even if the Ni clan wanted to avoid offending Ting Province, a battlefield was no place for diplomacy. A flying sword would cross the distance, and it would be your life or mine. A river of blood was already flowing. The message was unmistakable:

'You don't want to offend the Li clan? Then I'll force your family to be the first to charge!'

What truly made Hongyan's heart sink, however, was the knowledge that these dharma vessels didn't just carry his Ni clan cultivators and the desert garrison. The Shu court had secretly inserted one or two of its own squads...

Hongyan didn't need to think hard to know what they were for. The cultivators on the lake couldn't tell one Shu soldier from another. These agents would simply borrow the Ni clan's name... and commit horrendous slaughter on the western shore, targeting the direct descendants of the Li family.

He could only curse in the darkness of his heart, his thoughts a field of ash.

'After this battle... my Ni clan... will be despised by Ting Province.'

# Chapter 1102: Unsheathed

On the island.

The purple light on the horizon pulsed, a coiling dragon of lightning lurking within the clouds. Rain sluiced down, drowning the courtyard in a cold, desolate silence.

Inside, the candlelight flickered. An old man leaned against his wooden chair, staring into the gloom.

Flashes of divine ability constantly lit up Moongaze Lake, and the sounds of battle were frequent. No one was ever willing to let Li Xuanxuan go out. He could only extinguish the lamp, huddle in the darkness, and wait quietly for news.

He had lived like this for a long time. Li Xuanxuan had long since accepted that he was a useless man. All he could do was wait, his heart pounding, time and time again. He would wait until his lips turned white, wait until the storm passed and the sky cleared. Then, someone would naturally come up the mountain to tell him who had died this time.

Of course, perhaps one day, the person who came up the mountain would no longer bear the surname Li. The younger generation rarely saw such things, but Li Xuanxuan had. He’d seen it back when he was still the young Family Head, and in the years since, it had happened again and again.

_Knock, knock..._

Li Xuanxuan stood up. He pushed the door open with an ice-cold hand and found someone waiting outside.

The man wore a feathered robe, a sword at his waist. His eyes were clear and bright, like the moon itself. He stood in the cold, driving rain and bowed.

"Old Sir!"

Li Xuanxuan's expression changed instantly.

"What are you doing out here!"

"The western bank has been pleading for reinforcements. I am going... but I dared not make the decision myself. I came to ask for your permission, Sir!"

Li Jiangchun hadn't seen the old man in a long time. Peering through the cracked-open door, he was struck by how dark it was inside. The faint light fell on the old man's pale, withered face. It was gaunt and uneven, his cheekbones alarmingly high. It was not a pleasant sight.

A sourness welled up in Li Jiangchun's heart.

'The old man cultivates the Pristine Water art. The life-extending pills and spiritual items the Daoist Master gave him... they mostly nourish his water virtue. The cold energy is too heavy...'

Li Xuanxuan was terrified. He quickly slammed the door shut.

"You are not allowed to go!"

He heard the young man outside the door sigh.

"A sword cultivator who doesn't kill cannot achieve the Dao. I have been stuck at the Sword Origin for long enough. I have Purple Mansion Realm talismans and secret pills on me, plenty of treasures... Who could possibly stop me?"

"Old Sir!"

Li Xuanxuan's expression was as cold and pale as his hands, showing not a flicker of hesitation. He hurriedly pulled a jade token from his sleeve, on which a single, shining character was carved: Xuan.

"The two Daoist Masters are fighting, and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators cannot easily interfere. For someone of my status, a life-and-death battle like this is a rare opportunity... It is the perfect time for seeking the Dao!"

Li Xuanxuan turned a deaf ear. He clutched the jade pendant and rushed to the door, pressing his hand against it. He anxiously tried to summon someone to send the young man away, but he suddenly realized,

'All the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are fighting on the western front. With his current power, who here can possibly restrain him?'

He froze, dazed. Li Jiangchun, seeing no reaction, finally spoke his heart, his voice urgent.

"Sir, you don't understand! Strange phenomena are appearing all over the western bank. In the main hall, the sound of life-tablets shattering is endless! My cultivation has reached this point; how can I just sit here and watch? It will destroy my sword heart!"

"For the Li Clan, I must go!"

Nothing else he'd said had earned a response, but those last words struck Li Xuanxuan like a divine ability. They smashed into his ears, leaving him dizzy, his face flushing crimson.

'For the Li Clan, I must go!'

It felt as if those words weren't spoken in a cold, rain-swept hall, but had echoed from a pitch-black cave manor, or from the banks of a surging river, or from within the roaring flames of a dark furnace.

Li Xuanxuan abruptly shoved the door open.

"You... wait."

Li Jiangchun was just about to ride the wind when the words stopped him. He watched Li Xuanxuan turn, retrieve a jade box with both hands, and bring it to him. The old man's voice was choked with tears.

"Jun'er once said the inheritance was in the sword. It belongs to our ancestors. It was prepared in the hall... it was always meant to be given to you."

"Now that your mind is made up... take it with you!"

Li Jiangchun solemnly accepted the jade box with both hands. He opened it. Resting in the center was a sword, still in its scabbard. The scabbard was wrapped in strips of grayish-white cloth, and a single tassel hung from the hilt.

'Qingchi...'

...

The rain fell in torrents.

In the mountain forest, only the dripping of water could be heard. Faint footsteps echoed as a group of people advanced in silence, shrouded by the shimmering multicolored light of a dharma artifact. They appeared to be walking, but under the artifact's power, they floated just above the ground, moving at an incredible speed.

The cultivator in the lead, his expression somewhat gloomy, spoke.

"Are you certain... this path cuts through the forests?"

A cultivator at the back, his demeanor slightly unsettling, replied in a low voice,

"Sir... this lowly one used to be a merchant traveling between the great desert and Moongaze Lake. I know both areas well. Past the edge of this desert, connecting to the western foot of Mount Dali, there is a hilly region called Nanzhang. It's effectively the outskirts of Moongaze Lake!"

"The western bank is engulfed in war right now, the battle lines are stretched thin. Out here in the desolate wilderness, there definitely won't be any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators on guard!"

The leader, a general from the Shu Court, had a complicated expression. He remained silent for a moment before saying, "I just feel... a chill in this place."

He cultivated the Treasured Earth art, 'High-Rampart Swallow', which gave him a subtle precognitive sense for avoiding harm and finding fortune. He immediately grew vigilant. At his side, a gray-robed cultivator tilted his head and said lightly,

"Nitan, this was Duanmu Kui's former seat of power, after all. It's not surprising it would have some lingering anomalies."

Li Nitan felt a bitter taste in his mouth.

He hadn't wanted to come. His family was trying to avoid getting too close to the Wei-Li alliance. But he had been forced to act as Qing Jifang's sword, and his own Daoist Master had already set an example. What choice did Li Nitan have?

'Still... since I'm stationed here, I had no reason to refuse...'

The torrential rain washed insects and snakes from the forest canopy. A few broken-winged locusts twitched and died in a puddle. Li Nitan fell silent for a moment, observing this omen, and began making calculations with his fingers.

But the divinatory art, usually infallible, simply blurred and dissipated like smoke. The gray-robed cultivator watched him and shook his head.

"Nitan, my peak also cultivates Treasured Earth. While 'High-Rampart Swallow' is the best art within that path for calculations, your Dao-Profundity is simply too low."

He glanced at the ground.

"Locusts are an ill omen of Gathering Wood. They are impossible to eliminate, impossible to kill. This relates to the Gathering Wood divine ability, 'Calamity-Spreading Life'. Seeing this sign on a military expedition is a great omen for conquest. You don't need to worry."

Li Nitan replied respectfully, sighing, "It's a true pity that such a brilliant divine ability was lost."

The gray-robed cultivator shook his head.

"My Changhuai Daoist Master once asked Duanmu Kui about it. He said that the 'Calamity-Spreading Life' path can no longer be cultivated. The Lord of Gathering Wood himself fell to calamity; how could he possibly sustain such an ability? Only if some stunningly talented figure arises to take up that mantle will we ever see even a shadow of 'Calamity-Spreading Life' again."

Just then, a yellow-robed cultivator beside them, who also seemed to be a high-ranking figure from Mount Changhuai, turned and said mildly,

"That's not so certain. 'Gathering Wood' is coveted by many Buddhist cultivators. 'Impossible to eliminate, impossible to kill'... doesn't that describe the current swarm of Buddhists perfectly? My master's opinion is... this matter isn't so simple."

His words brought the conversation to an abrupt halt. They all fell silent.

The group moved extremely fast. After weaving through the forest, they emerged to see a plain stretching before them, stained blood-red in the pouring rain. The Li Clan's forces had already lost most of the western bank.

And their current position was precisely at the undefended rear of the Ting Province army!

The gray-robed cultivator laughed and shouted, "Attack!"

In an instant, they dismissed the concealing dharma artifact and revealed themselves.

A brilliant light flared, but it was immediately met by a crimson streak shooting into the sky. It pulled a torrent of True Fire with it, condensing into a fiery red sparrow that darted forward to block them. The fire dissipated, revealing a woman.

She wore a red dress and held a spiritual sword. Two bright lanterns hovered behind her—one gold tinged with red, the other white with a burning flame. Both rained down True Fire, a truly majestic sight.

The wind and rain on the western bank were a blood-streaked mist. The water stained the hem of her red dress. Li Minggong's expression was grave.

Li Minggong was now considered a pillar of the Li Clan, responsible for guarding the rear. To run into these three... her heart went cold. Her expression turned to ice as she gritted her teeth.

"The three of you... are from Changhuai?"

The other two didn't speak. Li Nitan sighed inwardly and, knowing his place, immediately stepped forward.

"I am Li Nitan. I am only here leading the Tongmo garrison."

But the smile hadn't even faded from the gray-robed cultivator's face when the sound that reached his ears was not one of surprise, but the cold voice of an incantation:

"Great Dao Transforms Gold Dark Array, activate!"

A young man stood poised in the sky, his hands a blur of seals as he commanded a profound power. Instantly, sixteen array flags plummeted from the heavens, embedding themselves in the forest below. The ground shimmered with a golden light, and a storm of lightning descended!

_Boom!_

The gray-robed cultivator showed no fear. He merely raised an eyebrow, glanced at the attack, and said lightly,

"Rise!"

In an instant, a gray-yellow light poured down, smothering the lightning. It gathered like a dense storm cloud, condensing to neutralize every thunderbolt, causing them to dissipate into smoke.

Li Suining cultivated the Divine Sequence. His Heaven–Governing Dao gave him a natural affinity for lightning, and his immortal foundation allowed him to command it. Unfortunately, this Changhuai cultivator was steeped in Earth Virtue, making him a difficult opponent.

The man was also far more experienced. Whether at an advantage or disadvantage, he refused to remain inside the array. He brought two fingers together, and a beam of light like a spiritual sword formed at his fingertips. With a flick of his hand, it shot out, slashing at the shimmering array barrier in the sky.

_Rumble!_

A violent explosion of thunder and Metal Malice rang out. The Mount Changhuai cultivator frowned.

"Oh...?"

He looked surprised. The yellow-robed cultivator at his side, however, was full of praise.

"I never thought... in this chaotic battlefield, we'd find an array genius like this! Truly blessed by the heavens!"

For a moment, True Origin flared and intertwined. Beams of light from various arts rained down. The five of them were instantly locked in battle.

The two Changhuai cultivators—one at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm, the other at the late-stage—were, after all, from a Golden Core Dao Lineage. Even though Li Minggong's cultivation was at the peak of her realm, she was immediately forced onto the defensive, her situation perilous.

But what made her even more anxious... was the battle on the horizon.

In the distance, the crimson light Ding Weizeng commanded flickered in the hazy downpour. The enemy cultivators in the sky clearly feared him, clutching their Dharma swords and warily circling in the thunderclouds, not daring to descend.

Ding Weizeng was a genius who had risen from humble beginnings. When the Li Clan rose to prominence in Ting Province, he had benefited immensely, becoming even stronger than Li Minggong. His protective light was as resplendent as colored glass. Wielding twin rods, he fought with such ferocity that no one dared meet him head-on!

Ting Province had a good number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, but the Holder of the Profound affair had drawn away the two young masters, each taking two or three trusted aides with them. This had suddenly drained Ting Province's core strength, leaving them stretched thin.

While she worried, Li Suining's expression remained cold and hard. His hands guided the array flags, channeling the thunder. His movements were crisp and decisive, every attack aimed to kill. It was a distinctive style.

He had clearly only just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Logically, a cultivator of his age should have all their energy focused on cultivation, not on mastering spell arts. But he used them with seasoned ease, and was somehow managing to tie down Li Nitan, who had a higher cultivation.

Compared to Li Minggong's anxiety, Li Suining was far calmer. He sent wave after wave of thunderclouds crashing down, each strike appearing even sharper amidst the raging storm, forcing his opponents to take notice.

From Li Suining's perspective, even though their side was being forced to retreat step by step... the situation was already much better than it could have been.

In his previous life, they hadn't had an anchor like Ding Weizeng. And they hadn't had his own foreknowledge to provide support. The western bank's forces had been routed all the way back to the lake, not conducting an orderly, step-by-step withdrawal like today.

Even so, he sighed inwardly.

'We probably still can't hold this...'

'Li Nitan... I don't know why he's here. Logically, he should have been with the main attacking force... As I thought, some small details have changed.'

Just then, Li Minggong clearly couldn't hold back any longer. With a shake of her sleeve, a ray of light shot out.

It was a decorative screen. A Profound Mystery wind swirled across its surface, where images of Green Pine swayed. It unleashed a wave of dark-green light, batting aside the incoming attacks.

'Deep Abyss Great Wind?'

The two Changhuai cultivators' faces changed. Their gazes locked onto the shimmering screen, and they stared, dumbfounded.

'That's...'

These two were no fools. How could they not recognize what was painted on the screen? It was the Six Sons of Chongming!

'What?'

The gray-robed cultivator was momentarily stunned, an extremely awkward feeling rising in his chest.

'Am _I_ from the Changhuai Dao Lineage, or are _you_? What is the meaning of this?'

Seeing the faint, shimmering image of his own True Monarch on the screen, his face went pale, uncertain whether from anger or humiliation. After a moment's hesitation, he could only draw his sword.

"How dare you humiliate a Changhuai ritual object!"

His outburst confused Li Minggong. She paused, stunned, before understanding dawned. Without a word, she poured more power into the Chongming Profund Insight Screen, causing its multicolored light to blaze even brighter as it crashed down.

_Boom!_

The Changhuai cultivator was truly powerful. He raised a gray gourd, and a torrent of gray wind surged out, actually managing to push the Chongming Profund Insight Screen back. Li Minggong struggled to hold her ground, her head snapping around anxiously.

In the distance, a mountain peak collapsed with a deafening roar. The multicolored light of a shattered array shot into the sky, as if it had triggered a chain reaction. One after another, the lights of distant mountain arrays broke and fell.

"Puht!"

The sound of Li Suining spitting blood snapped her back to attention. The young man's voice was urgent.

"We have to go!"

"Go?"

The gray-robed cultivator was furious. His eyes flashed as he shouted,

"You think you can leave?"

The gourd swept forward again, moving at incredible speed to suppress the screen. The cultivator had been overcome with greed, intending to seize the artifact and bring it back to Changhuai!

_Clang!_

A crisp, clear sound of metal on metal rang out.

The Changhuai cultivator looked up. A young man in a white robe stood before him, sword in hand. His figure was slender, his features striking. The light from his sword flickered, pulsing with a potent sense of crisis.

Another sword was strapped to his back, tightly bound in cloth, its shape hidden. He spoke softly.

"I'll take these three."




# Chapter 1103: Azure Moon's Homecoming

'You?'

The grey-robed cultivator glanced left and right, suspicion rising in his heart. He saw Li Minggong hesitate for a moment and then actually retreat. The unknown Heaven–Governing cultivator was even more decisive, simply riding the wind away.

The Li Clan was hardly an unknown family these days. The cultivator from Mount Changhuai immediately grew vigilant, sneering inwardly,

'Looks like they have some skill... But this level of contempt? Has my Mount Changhuai been secluded for so long that people think they can walk all over us?'

But the yellow-robed cultivator behind him simply clasped his hands behind his back, his gaze fixed cautiously on the sword light pulsing from the youth's hand. His immortal foundation flared with a warning, and he replied,

"Junior Brother Shancao, we must be careful."

Li Nitan, however, was observing them secretly, his mind racing.

'Who is this now? He looks incredibly young, must be a direct descendant. But I've never heard of any junior from the Li Clan with such mastery of the Way of the Sword. And those two... they aren't surnamed Qing. So arrogant one moment, yet they backed down so easily...'

While the two long-robed cultivators exchanged wary whispers, Li Jiangchun took a step forward. This was his first true life-and-death battle, and he held nothing back. He attacked with brazen, full-force!

Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record.

The Profound Mystery core within him responded instantly. A rolling, illusory radiance gathered, forming a nimbus of light behind his head as large as a prayer cushion, shining brilliantly. An infinite confluence of flames coalesced, draping over him in a multi-colored cloak.

The grey-robed cultivator before him was no slouch. He had already summoned his own dharma artifact—a grey-qi gourd hovered in front, a small, dark sword above it. But this action seemed to serve only as a reminder to the youth. In an instant, a cascade of dharma artifacts flew forth from Li Jiangchun—a white fan, a separation banner, a pearl-adorned sword—each one flaring with light!

Not only were the artifacts numerous, but every single one was a high-quality item, superior to his own. The cultivator, Shancaozi, felt his expression darken. He intoned,

"Let verdant life flourish, let hidden streams flow, when the great wood rots, the earth shall rise!"

Fertile Mire's Rule.

His immortal foundation surged. Colors seemed to precipitate from the air, condensing into a deep, turbid aura of mud. It layered itself thickly, threatening to smother all the surrounding metal, water, and wood qi, absorbing them without end.

This man cultivated Treasured Earth, a natural counter to sharp, aggressive attacks.

But the only thing that rose to meet it was a single, bright sword light, like a crescent moon, vast as a giant sail. In a flash, the light condensed into the shape of a swimming fish and drifted past.

The spell art, built upon the Treasured Earth immortal foundation, was caught completely off guard. First, it was scorched by a deluge of falling True Fire. Then, before the ethereal sword light, it became as dull and rigid as a stone, allowing the "fish" to easily slip past it.

'Sword Origin...'

The grey-robed cultivator's heart sank. The grey gourd he had activated barely managed to block his front, but the Celestial Moon Sword Arc blatantly swatted it aside. Before he could even feel a moment of relief, he felt a sudden, piercing chill on his neck.

All his retreating dharma artifacts were intercepted. Worse, a wave of Profound Qi and baleful energy surged toward him. A talismanic light screen, bright as glazed glass, flared to life, but it was a step too slow. Three large holes had already appeared in his chest. Three bright, agile sword lights, shielded by the Water Mansion profound light of the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record, had at some unknown moment burrowed into his organs and were now wreaking havoc.

"Ah?"

The cultivator's mind went blank. Even Li Jiangchun paused, surprised by the speed of it all. But his final attack, the Autumn Moon's Accord, was already descending.

This sword light fell like the last, drifting autumn rain of heaven and earth. It struck the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Mount Changhuai, who erupted into a shower of blood, earth, and stone.

The scene was one of visceral impact, yet the sword light that fluttered down was as gentle as a spring breeze, carrying no lingering might. It was this discrepancy that left the yellow-robed cultivator frozen in place, his mind reeling with horror and disbelief.

"It... it must be an illusion."

Shancaozi wasn't a top-tier expert, or he wouldn't have been sent on this kind of mission. But he was, nonetheless, a proper cultivator of Mount Changhuai. To be slain in three moves by a nobody?

'He was dispatched as easily as a Qi Refining scrub!'

And he, standing just three feet away, had felt no threat, no killing intent!

'Even... even when Chi Buzi killed our cultivator in the grotto-heaven... even with his cultivation suppressed... it took him twelve full moves!'

Killed in three moves?

It wasn't that such figures didn't exist. Back then, Duanmu Kui, blessed by the 'Earth Wu-Shaman', had killed a Wuzhu Gate cultivator with a single talisman. But such people weren't nameless! And their Mount Changhuai was worlds above the Wuzhu Gate!

It wasn't that this cultivator's mind was weak. On the contrary, his logic was too firm. The Sword Origin, Crescent Moon, had been utterly devoid of killing intent, which made the event before him seem impossible. He could only conclude it was a powerful illusion.

And so, he hesitated for half a step.

It was precisely this half-step of hesitation that sealed his fate. Amidst the rain of earth and stone, a sword light ignited anew, locking onto him. Only then did a suffocating sense of crisis finally engulf his mind.

But the nearby Li Nitan, after a brief moment of terror, had already shot away like an arrow loosed from a bow.

He fled as if he had seen a ghost, pure fear driving him westward. But he didn't get far before three streaks of escaping light—one in front, two behind—sped toward him. The leader wielded a jet-black sword, his face gloomy and his gaze fierce as it landed on Li Nitan.

Chen Yang was already in the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. He had been suppressing his opponents when he suddenly received orders to retreat from the west. Discovering he had lost many of his trusted followers along the way, he was fuming. Seeing someone now trying to cut off his escape, he was both furious and cautious. With a flick of his long sword, he brazenly stabbed forward.

Chen Yang was the undisputed number one genius of the Four Surnames, and his strike was menacing. Li Nitan, seeing the man try to intercept him even while fleeing for his own life, had no choice but to summon a dharma artifact and parry casually.

"Clang!"

Li Nitan was frantic, with no time to get entangled. He blocked the blow and, without a backward glance, continued his desperate flight. This left Chen Yang stunned, a flicker of doubt in his mind.

'What was that? Did he just fly over to take a hit?'

But in that instant, the earth shook and mountains swayed. A great rain fell, and a sword light leaped through the air, flashing in Chen Yang's eyes. The gloomy, suspicious cultivator froze on the spot.

Li Nitan, however, understood that both Mount Changhuai cultivators had fallen. His heart was consumed by terror. He surged his dharma power and roared, his voice shaking the heavens:

"Quickly, save me!"

With the Tanshan Li Clan's Daoist Master injured and gone, Li Nitan was in command. His status in the Shu army was not low; all the Foundation Establishment cultivators recognized him. His shout brought the entire battlefield to a halt. A large contingent of cultivators broke formation and began moving toward him.

In truth, the yellow-robed cultivator's cultivation had been higher, and he had been far more cautious than the first. Even with Li Jiangchun's advantages in dharma artifacts, Dao-Profundity, and spell arts, finishing him would have taken time. Li Jiangchun had only managed to wound him with ten strikes before suppressing him with his artifacts. By then, Li Nitan had fled too far, deep into the enemy ranks. He was beyond pursuit. Out of caution, Li Jiangchun had already decided to let him go.

But that one shout intimidated the entire west bank and threw the Shu army into chaos. This, instead, made Li Jiangchun's eyes light up. He immediately reached back and gripped the hilt of the azure-edged sword on his back.

'If I cut this man down, I'll shatter their will to fight!'

Even if Li Nitan fled a hundred li, he still had a way.

'It's just... my control isn't perfect. Killing him is best... but even a heavy wound would be enough to stun them...'

He grasped the hilt, gathering his power to draw. But as he did, an unexpected feeling of connection, as if to his own flesh and blood, surged through his heart. In an instant, clear qi erupted from his Qihai acupoint. Infinite profound meanings bloomed in his mind. Deep in his sea of consciousness, in an expanse of Limitless, he saw an azure sword.

"Clang!"

The world shifted. Wind and clouds surged. Countless sword hums vibrated through the air, and every sheathed long sword began to tremble. Every cultivator on the battlefield looked up, their expressions of pure, uncomprehending shock.

Li Minggong, who had been worried about Li Jiangchun advancing too deep and was rushing back from the east, stopped dead in her tracks and stared.

She saw the youth in the sky, his eyes an eerie azure-white. A sword mark had materialized between his brows, adding a fearsome killing intent to his once-elegant features. The waning moon had waxed full, its sharpness infinite!

He drew his sword!

Yet, there was no sky-filling sword light, no vast sword qi. All the sword light condensed onto the blade's edge, faintly emerging, transforming into infinite illusions.

Only a single sheet of azure-white light flashed past.

"Clang."

The azure-edged sword was already back in its sheath.

Far in the distance, Li Nitan turned his head with agonizing slowness, his features frozen in a dazed stupor.

'Sword... Intent...'

Li Jiangchun was already incredibly profound on the path of Sword Origin. Now, holding the Qingchi, he had sensed the Way of the Sword inheritance. This attack was not just the fourth form of the Celestial Moon Sword Codex, following Autumn Moon's Accord. It was a strike propelled by Sword Intent!

Azure Moon's Homecoming!

Li Nitan's head flew high, revealing the neat, smooth muscle and bone of his severed neck. His three mansions were simultaneously annihilated, all profound mystery extinguished. His body, not yet registering its own death, drifted forward a short distance before plummeting from the sky.

"Boom!"

A plume of grey clouds and yellow earth blasted into the air.

Like the helpless Chi family prodigy under a single sword strike all those years ago, this direct grandson of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Tanshan Li Clan—was slain on the spot from a hundred li away!

Sword Intent was devastating even in divine ability-level combat, let alone at the Foundation Establishment Realm! Without achieving a divine ability, one simply could not restrain Sword Intent. Moreover, the current Li Jiangchun, from his cultivation method to his full set of dharma artifacts, was at the absolute apex of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

'Sword Intent!'

Chen Yang's pupils dilated to pinpricks. His face was drenched in cold sweat, his cheek stinging with pain. He stood motionless in the sky, listening as the sword immortal's ice-cold voice reverberated through the heavens,

"Those who advance east... die."

"Boom!"

The advancing cultivators stopped. The battlefield fell utterly silent.

In an instant, the Ting Province cultivators were overcome with a mix of joy and shock. The steadily retreating battle line had brazenly halted, locked in a tense stalemate. Li Suining was suddenly overjoyed, a realization dawning on him:

'With General Ding here... dragging it out for that one hour... it truly made a difference!'

He turned his head eagerly, only to find Li Minggong staring blankly, her expression a knot of complexity. She muttered,

"Back then... when the elder defended the river... he looked just like this."

It was the same feat—one person halting an army, one shout stopping the enemy. But the first emotion that welled up in the woman's heart was fear. Panic seized her.

'Where is the Daoist Master... Where is Uncle... I'm afraid someone... will try to harm him!'

...

Great Void.

A shining Celestial Gate stood in the vastness of the Great Void. A man in platinum Daoist robes sat casually beneath it, toying with a wisp of bright white flame between his fingertips. It was dazzling, yet encircled by a faint grey ring.

Not far away, two divine abilities were madly entangled. Bright radiance clashed violently as lightning radiance and Bright Yang Heavenly Light warred against each other, sending out wave after wave of power.

The man in the platinum robes paid it no mind. Deep in his eyes was an irrepressible joy. A golden-white radiance, seemingly a kind of Life Divine Ability, circled behind him, faintly shrouding down from the Great Void to protect the sword immortal in the mortal world.

On the other side of the Great Void, a pale-faced man stood with his hands behind his back, his expression gloomy. He remained silent for a long time.

As the collision between the two divine abilities grew more intense, the man seemed to aggravate his injuries. He coughed, his voice hoarse.

"Daoist friend... we are the same family, after all. Must you be so utterly ruthless?"

"Same family?" Li Ximing sneered, "My junior is following my orders, defeating enemies and killing generals. I know nothing about any 'same family'."

He flung the man's own words from that day with Li Zhouwei back at him, causing the man's face to pale even further. Only then did Li Ximing continue faintly,

"When your Tanshan Li Clan shunned Moongaze like vipers and called us a 'foreign clan', did you think of 'same family'? When you followed Qing Jifang to raise an army and provoke us, did you think of 'same family'? Now that your cultivators have crossed the border and are slaughtering the common people, have you thought of 'same family'?"

"Now your direct descendant is about to die, and you have to step in to save him... _now_ you remember 'same family'."

He gave a cold laugh.

"Lord Li doesn't fuss over bloodlines, and he has many descendants. He probably won't miss this one."

The pale-faced, middle-aged man before him was none other than Li Muyan of the Tanshan Li Clan—Li Nitan's biological grandfather!

He had sought injury and received it, having been badly beaten by Li Zhouwei. He had only just managed to heal when Qing Jifang, who clearly didn't regard him as human, hurriedly dispatched him to the Great Western Plateau. He suffered a crushing defeat, and now he had dragged his injured body all the way to the great desert to hold the line.

Only upon arriving did he discover that his own grandson, the key direct descendant the Tanshan Li Clan relied on to defend the desert, had been sent by the Qing family with two men from Mount Changhuai deep into the Li heartland to do this!

'This is a blatant setup! It's designed to harm someone! Either the Ting Province people get hurt by me, or he gets killed by the Ting Province people!'

It hadn't been long since his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. The seniors in his family were still alive, so no great treasures had been passed down to him. Riddled with injuries, how could he dare to provoke Li Ximing? He could only stand there silently in the Great Void.

The coldness in his heart was palpable.

'That bastard Qing never treats people as people, but I never imagined he could be this cruel... He's too stingy to even spare a token reward, a thin disguise... It's... it's reached this point!'

Li Ximing saw it all clearly and said coldly,

"You know full well how the Tanshan Li Clan came to be... Whether you've cut ties cleanly is hard to say, but you're certainly efficient at betrayal!"

"I also know your esteemed clan faces... difficulties. Allow me to accommodate you!"

His intentions laid bare, Li Muyan was mortified, and even more, terrified. He gave Li Ximing a deep look, and seeming to bite back his anger, he ground out through his teeth,

"This generous gift from your esteemed clan... the Tanshan Li Clan will remember it."

These words actually made Li Ximing stand up and laugh uproariously. His gaze burned like fire and lightning as it fixed on Li Muyan. He flicked his sleeves and cursed with a grin,

"Good for you, Li Muyan! Daring to vent your anger on me? Everyone knows you have Qing Jifang at your back. He uses you like a dog, and you lap it up. You dare cross the border and talk tough to my face? If not for him, what the hell do you think you are!"

He laughed.

"Come... come on over. King Wei will be here any moment. If you fucking dare to repeat those exact words to him, I'll even count you as a man!"

Li Ximing 【Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm】




# Chapter 1104: Breaking the Siege

When Li Muyan heard this, he merely pressed his hand to his sleeve and fell silent, visibly hesitant. But then, a divine ability flared, capped with purple light. It enveloped Li Muyan, pulling him back as a low voice urged,

"Let's go... let's go. It's time to leave!"

The arrival of Hongyan was what finally made Li Muyan move. He realized this Daoist Master from the Ni family was covered in cold sweat, truly desperate to end the confrontation. By speaking first, Hongyan had shouldered half the blame for ordering a retreat. Li Muyan said nothing more, turning to depart with him.

Li Ximing simply maintained his divine ability, holding his ground in a silent standoff.

In the mortal realm, the armies began a near-simultaneous retreat to the west. Western Shu had a great number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and even with their morale broken, their hasty withdrawal was as stable as a mountain.

Hongyan and Li Muyan had just crossed the Western Mountains when a cultivator in blue-gray robes approached them on the wind. He cupped his hands in salute and said,

"I was sent on orders to receive you both!"

This was Daoist Master Guanlan, Qing Zhuo, a new-generation Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Qing family. He had possessed two divine abilities for some time, and his spiritual essence now radiated, his aura full. Clearly, his third divine ability was on the verge of completion. The Qing family had been reluctant to let him see battle. He was, Hongyan noted, far more approachable than Qing Jifang.

Hongyan gave a bitter smile.

"Retreating without orders was my counsel. It was not Li Muyan's decision alone."

Li Muyan remained silent, a desolate look on his face as he secretly clutched the jade talisman in his sleeve.

Qing Zhuo simply waved his hand in a dismissive bow.

"The two of you are overthinking. I was, in fact, sent to ask you to withdraw your forces."

This made Li Muyan raise his eyebrows in surprise. Qing Zhuo sighed.

"King Wei slew Vast Cicada at Baixiang. The Zhao army has suffered a massive defeat!"

Understanding dawned instantly in Li Muyan's mind. Hongyan, however, was stunned.

"I saw the white sands churning in the north and a multicolored light that reached the heavens. I knew someone had taken a heavy loss, but I never imagined it was Li Jieyi—a pity, I heard his Dharma Body was stolen from the Golden Land, so the loss isn't truly disastrous for him."

Qing Zhuo stared at him.

"Vast Cicada is dead."

The emphasis in that statement made both Li Muyan's and Hongyan's expressions change. They fell into a stunned silence. After a long moment, Li Muyan muttered,

"That Exiled Qi is truly formidable."

Qing Zhuo's lips twitched, but he offered no reply. It was the exact same thing Qing Jifang had said.

Within the Qing family, Qing Zhuo was known as a reasonable and generous figure. He understood the situation at Baixiang in detail, but he hadn't dared say much in front of Qing Jifang. He had no such reservations with Li Muyan, however, and replied tactfully,

"The Exiled Qi is formidable, to be sure. But King Wei perceived the true nature of Bright Yang within three moves. His Dao-Profundity has reached a level beyond the mundane, far beyond what ordinary people can comprehend."

His words made Hongyan turn his head, his expression fraught with worry, which quickly curdled into resentment. Li Muyan was still clutching that jade talisman from Qing Jifang. He could have still caused a great deal of trouble. If Hongyan hadn't intervened, they would have forged a much deeper enmity.

'Qing Jifang... so arrogant. His actions are utterly shameless... Even Li Muyan was having second thoughts... We may not have powerful backgrounds, but we are still Purple Mansion Realm masters! We are pieces on the board... If one day, in the middle of a great battle, we were to slack off, or intentionally hold back... could Qing Jifang truly execute us for it?!'

His line of thinking was correct. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was not some nameless soldier. A True Monarch would not personally intervene to punish them. If the Ni family's territory were to be conquered by the Song court, Hongyan would not hesitate for a second to change his allegiance.

The Daoist Master's gaze grew increasingly gloomy.

'I can only hope Qing Zhuo breaks through soon and can bring over some of his own people. I refuse to stay under Qing Jifang for a single day longer!'

---

...The Great Void.

The Shu army had retreated, but Li Ximing did not relax his guard. He silently maintained his divine ability, his spiritual sense already reaching out to the Immortal Mirror. The power of Spirit Probe swept across the Great Void as he pondered.

Li Ximing was, of course, aware that Li Muyan had been clutching something in his sleeve. His claim that Li Zhouwei was about to arrive had been a bluff... If a true fight had broken out, it was uncertain whether Shu or Song would have benefited, but it certainly would not have been either of the Li families.

'Li Muyan's retreat was within my expectations...'

Just as he was mulling this over, the woman in purple robes descended on a cloud. Daoist Master Wenqing, the graceful Ziyu longsword strapped to her back, bowed at his side.

"Many thanks, Senior! And congratulations!"

Her expression was one of clear envy.

"After so many years... the title 'family of Sword Immortals' is finally truly deserved!"

"Daoist Master, you exaggerate!"

Daoist Master Wenqing's beauty was considerable, enhanced further by her divine ability. Even now, slightly disheveled from battle, she was as ethereal as a fairy. Li Ximing smiled and quickly returned her bow.

"Is there any news from the west?"

Daoist Master Wenqing replied, "I heard the Great General had to use several treasures, but he held the line by himself. It was a difficult fight, but with Qinghu and Cheng Qian supporting him, nothing will go wrong!"

She could see Li Ximing was distracted and understood that the west bank of Moongaze Lake had just been ravaged. There was much to be done. With considerable tact, she offered,

"I will stand guard at the Western Mountains!"

"Good!"

Li Ximing didn't stand on ceremony. With a single step, he crossed into the mortal realm. His eyes immediately fell on Li Jiangchun, whose own were shut tight, a sword-shaped mark flickering faintly on his brow. With a wave of his sleeve, the Light of the Six Harmonies veiled them, pulling the young man behind him.

He studied him closely, his gaze fixed on that sword mark. He was silent for a long moment, visibly processing something. A look of sudden, shocking realization filled his eyes.

Yet the Daoist Master said nothing. He simply formed a hand seal, and light gathered at his fingertips, scattering downward like rain.

It was 'World's Radiance'!

The Light of the Six Harmonies from 'World's Radiance' was intrinsically tied to his authority, making it difficult to constrain by normal range. The moment Li Ximing took control of the west bank, his divine ability mirrored his authority, and he unleashed it with full power!

All the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators on the west bank froze. A brilliant radiance surged from within their qi seas, mending their wounds. Those with lighter injuries, like Li Minggong and Nantanchen, saw their complexions immediately improve. Those more severely wounded, like Ding Weizeng and Qu Bushi, instantly regenerated severed limbs, their faces flushing with renewed vitality!

This Bright Yang divine ability was incredibly domineering. Li Ximing stood within the mortal realm, his expression impassive, having already restored nearly every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to combat readiness. Aside from those like Ding Weizeng, whose powerful Dharma Bodies required time to reconstruct, or those like Chen Yang and Nantanchen who cultivated Pit Water—on whom the light had less effect—every other cultivator was brought back from the brink!

As Li Ximing dispersed his divine ability, Li Minggong immediately hurried over, beaming.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing nodded, then noticed the second person to approach. He was a stern-faced, middle-aged man, his entire body covered in mottled patches of tender, new-grown skin. Not a single inch of his hands or feet was unblemished—a testament to the horrific battle he had just endured.

This man was none other than Li Ju, who had come from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm.

He was originally from Lingbei, a man of considerable skill and one of Vast Cicada's former subordinates. After being captured by Ding Weizeng, he had been 'washed' by 'World's Radiance'. He had completely lost his old self, cultivated to the late Foundation Establishment Realm, and become one of the Li's most loyal supporters. After so much time, he had been fundamentally changed to his very core.

It was the ultimate irony. In the entire battle for the west bank, aside from Ding Weizeng, who had held off multiple opponents at once, this man had fought with the most savage ferocity. Since joining them, his cultivation had advanced greatly, he was fully equipped, and he fought with every blessing they could provide. He battled with no regard for his lifespan or his own foundation, stunning the Shu generals who besieged him.

The price for that ferocity was enormous. Initially, Li Ju had burned through more than seventy years of his lifespan and nearly exhausted his immortal foundation. If Li Ximing had acted a single step later, Li Ju would have undoubtedly perished on that riverbank!

Yet even with the Light of the Six Harmonies saving him and the divine ability's timely restoration, he had still permanently lost over thirty years of his lifespan.

Li Ximing observed this with complicated feelings and nodded.

"Good."

Having received that single word, Li Ju needed no other reward. Overwhelmed with honor and joy, he prostrated himself on the ground.

Li Suining, following just behind, watched this exchange with a heart full of emotion.

It was fair to say that the west bank had held on this long thanks to the heroic efforts of Li Ju, Ding Weizeng, and the direct-lineage member, Li Zhouda, who fought with the most desperation... The bank had not fallen instantly as it had in his past life. It was barely breathing, but it held, all thanks to the addition of Ding Weizeng and Li Ju!

Li Ximing turned his head and asked in a low voice,

"What are the casualties?"

Li Minggong stepped forward.

"Per the Lord's command, the Zhuang family from across the Western Mountains was evacuated before the Song attack. Our losses are not catastrophic. The retreat was orderly... no major disasters. However, one Foundation Establishment Realm Guest Retainer was killed. His name was Pu Yu. He wasn't old... the new Family Head of the Pu family, just recently broken through. It's a great pity. The Tian family's Family Head, Tian Ling, who broke through at the same time as him... he was luckier. He escaped with his life."

"Otherwise... many Qi Refining cultivators were lost. That is the most painful part..."

Li Minggong glanced around and lowered her voice pointedly.

"Guest Retainer Ding's eldest son... Ding Yuming. It was his first battle. He also fell."

Ding Weizeng was usually the first to greet him, but his absence now meant he was obviously searching for his son's remains. Li Ximing was silent for a moment before dismissing the others. He took Li Minggong and Li Suining and descended on the wind, just as the burly man was ascending, clutching a jade box.

Inside the box was a mix of crimson blood and stark white bone. He was completely, irrevocably dead. Not even 'Valley Water' could bring him back.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

He had already composed himself and bowed respectfully. Li Ximing helped him up, simply patting him on the shoulder. The man waited a second. Hearing no command, he made a rare request.

"This subordinate must return to inform my wife and daughter."

Li Ximing let him go. Li Minggong said quietly,

"Guest Retainer Ding had one daughter and two sons. His second son rushed his cultivation years ago, failed to break through Qi Refining, and perished. Now his eldest son has also died young. Only his daughter, Ding Yujing, remains. Her talent is exceptional, and she's preparing to face the life-and-death trial for the Foundation Establishment Realm. Fortunately, his eldest son left behind a grandson, preserving the bloodline."

Li Suining remained silent. In his past life, Ding Weizeng had died far too early. Ding Yujing had been forced to manage the funeral, delaying her breakthrough. As a result, she died alongside Ding Yuming on this very day. The Ding family's brief moment of glory had faded, leaving only a widow and a young grandson.

That grandson was named Ding Weili. He had been in Li Zhouda's army and died at the hands of Wang Quwan—another loyal soul.

'Three generations of the Ding family, all loyal to the end. They died repaying a debt of kindness, without a moment's hesitation.'

As Li Suining saw it, the current situation was already infinitely better than his past life. Zhuang Pingye had not died. Most importantly, late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators like Miaoshui, Ding Weizeng, and Li Minggong were all unharmed. This was the best possible outcome.

As he was lost in thought, the Heavenly Light beneath his feet touched down on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Li Ximing first sent Li Jiangchun to his quarters before returning to the summit. There, he saw Li Jiangzong escorting a captive up the path.

The man was gaunt, middle-aged, and trembling. He knelt before the pavilion and kowtowed.

"This lowly one, Lin Yuan, greets the Daoist Master!"

The Shu general stammered, immediately trying to claim connections, saying his ancestor had followed a General Li and Zhuang Cheng to attack Chengshui.

Li Ximing had no patience for it.

"Raise your head!"

The cultivator didn't even dare to pause, letting out a wail as if his soul had fled his body. Li Ximing was in no mood for this. He waved him away.

"Go follow Li Ju."

The others trembled. Li Ximing took the casualty list from Li Jiangzong, reading it as he stood. He began to pace the mountaintop, his heart aching as he silently committed the names to memory.

He closed his eyes, his heart growing heavy.

Li Jiangchun's face remained vivid in his mind, that sword mark seared into his vision. His heart fell silent. He suddenly recalled that day, years ago: the longsword streaking across the sky, the bronze sword shattering, his own brother collapsing into his arms, gasping,

'Ming-ge'er, the Qingchi sword... it must still hold a trump card from the immortal who left it... or a legacy!'

Li Xijun's blood-streaked face flashed in his memory, those bright, ambiguous eyes staring directly into his soul. A cold caution gripped Daoist Master Zhaojing's heart.

'A legacy? A legacy left by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator? One that the Immortal Mirror cannot detect, and even my Purple Mansion Realm Life Divine Ability cannot perceive?'

'Is that right?'

The Daoist Master stood in silence, his expression perfectly calm. He extinguished the avalanche of doubt rising in his mind. His Life Divine Ability retracted, returning to a state of stillness.

'I was too foolish, Jun-ge'er... I didn't even hear the implication in your words...'

'You said "immortal," not "senior." That was it, wasn't it?'

He suddenly sighed, as if lamenting the lives lost on the list in his hand. Without a trace of strangeness, he turned back to the juniors.

"The Western Mountains needs a Purple Mansion Realm grand array."

---

...Tangdao Mountain.

Gray clouds roiled across the sky. Patches of auspicious, multicolored light sat within a deep darkness, where a colossal, terrifying shadow loomed. Countless golden bodies clung to it, resembling a supreme Buddhist Land in its magnificent, terrible scale.

On the other side of that darkness, a brilliant Jade True wheel spun, casting down its own motes of light, like tufts of cotton. These lights shifted and transformed in mid-air, intercepting and dissolving the incoming attacks, one by one, reducing them to a sky full of fragrant ash that drifted silently down.

The sword cultivator stood with his blade drawn, his face a mask of killing intent. Opposite him, the golden-eyed king held his halberd, Heavenly Light flashing around his imposing figure.

A stalemate.

Atop the Buddhist Land, a Maha golden body stood tall, looking down at the monk on the other side.

Jiang Toushou squinted, his expression dark and uncertain.

'Vast Cicada... is actually dead!'

Hearing this news, Jiang Toushou's heart grew heavy.

Both the Way of Great Desire and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm had a small claim to the Bright Yang opportunity, and neither wanted the other to seize it. Vast Cicada's death meant the value of the Way of Great Desire's chess pieces had just multiplied several times over. Tian Langzhi was probably weeping with joy. Jiang Toushou was no supporter of Vast Cicada, but the Way of Great Desire's recently revealed rebellious intentions left him with no reason to celebrate.

'Now Tian Langzhi can rest easy. He no longer has to fear that intervening too slowly will let the Great Adoration Dharma Realm gain an advantage. He'll just continue to sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight... Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain... it... it can't hold out much longer...'

He knew Tian Langzhi only wanted to reap the benefits. If the Baixiang front made gains, or even pushed south to isolate Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, Tian Langzhi would definitely have moved to claim a piece of the pie. But now, with the two sides locked in a stalemate, Tian Langzhi was content to wait!

'That day, he put on an act, strongly advising me to kill Minghui. I saw his high cultivation and thought he was a man of character, so I foolishly believed him. It's obvious now he was preparing for this... hoping I would shatter my relationship with the Lotus Temple... That was his true goal! Fortunately... fortunately, those disciple-brothers did not die...'

Jiang Toushou was struck by the realization, his heart filling with regret. But this was no time to remain in a stalemate. He could only say coldly,

"Tell General Touba and Zhelu... they no longer need to maintain the siege."

After an unknown amount of time, the light of the Buddhist Land was seen receding, bit by bit. The silent horizon grew dark and heavy. Liu Bai recalled his green-edged sword from the sky, shaking his head with a cold sneer.

"A pack of cowards, bullying the weak and fearing the strong!"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his gaze fixed with interest on the brocade-like divine ability in the sky. He retracted his halberd.

"Is that 'Pattern Brocade'? It doesn't resemble 'Jade True' anymore."

The fluid, shifting divine ability in the sky was indeed the Fei family's former 'Pattern Brocade'. The marvel that had once clung to Fei Wangbai like a cloak now bore no resemblance to its original form. Liu Bai nodded and smiled.

"'Pattern Brocade' is the aspect of Jade True favored by Prime Virtue. It possesses the nature of material change. My Dao lineage happens to have a few secret arts that can unleash its Material Transformation ability. I've made a fool of myself in front of King Wei."

Liu Bai's legacy was clearly profound. That sentence alone might hold inspiration for his own juniors. Li Zhouwei casually committed it to memory, nodded, and then looked toward the majestic mountain behind them.

At the mention of Situ Huo, Liu Bai's expression instantly turned cold. 

"Baixiang still requires a garrison. I must trouble King Wei with the matters here. If you have any arrangements, simply send a messenger to Baixiang."




# Chapter 1105: Turning Point

Li Zhouwei retrieved his golden halberd and smiled.

"The Protector-General is certainly carefree, but I, on the other hand, must see him."

He had a good impression of Liu Bai. It was just a pity that a sword cultivator who was meant to be free-spirited had been thrown into such a grand, complex situation. Everyone saw him as the 'Jade True', a beacon of integrity brimming with vigor, but in Li Zhouwei's eyes... he was actually a man of unfulfilled ambitions, burdened by deep frustrations.

Liu Bai immediately sighed. He had a feud with the Situ clan and knew the Li clan's relationship with them wasn't any better. He simply sheathed his sword and shook his head.

"King Wei, your esteemed status surpasses all other generals. You have only just slain Vast Cicada and are at the height of your prestige. You should be the one to guard this mountain..."

He first stated this righteous justification before finally getting to his point.

"I am, after all, a sword cultivator. I prefer to vent my frustrations. If I see him, it will only stir up conflict. This matter... I must trouble King Wei with it."

Li Zhouwei clasped his hands and smiled.

"It's no trouble. I was ordered to enter Tangdao in the first place. But... there's no need for the Protector-General to return to Baixiang. Yang Ruizao is already in Baixiang, commanding the Exiled Qi. He is awaiting orders and ready to move at any time."

Hearing this, Liu Bai seemed to understand something. He realized Li Zhouwei had other plans. He gave him a look and said,

"In that case, I will wait for King Wei outside the mountain."

Li Zhouwei immediately strode into the mountain on a beam of light. He saw a grim landscape of metal and stone. Overhead, there was not a trace of Heavenly Light, only a thick, bottomless, and profound yin mist. An Azure Nether Bronze chariot stood in the sky, radiating a brilliant glow.

A woman hovered in the air, her feet treading on an owl-wind. She lowered her gaze, adopting a very humble posture, and said,

"Greetings, King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei nodded. "Ah, it is the King of Nanjia. There is no need for such ceremony."

This woman was precisely Lingu Lanying. The Lingu family had relied on the good fortune of the old sword immortal from the Great Xiukui Monastery to barely manage to raise her, allowing the Lingu family to be enfeoffed as the King of Nanjia. Yet, seeing Li Zhouwei, she was deeply ashamed.

"I am merely a minor king 'within the jurisdiction.' I dare not accept praise before King Wei. Please, King Wei, omit my title. You may simply call me Yingjia."

Li Zhouwei merely strode up the mountain, smiling.

"'A minor king within the jurisdiction'... Interesting. Whose turn of phrase is that?"

Back then, when Ning Wan had come to Moongaze Lake to grant fiefdoms, she had declared Moongaze Lake autonomous. All matters, high and low, were to be decided by Li Zhouwei. Later, it became known as the 'Land Beyond Martial Cultivation's Reach.' In contrast, these so-called kings like Lingu Lanying... were naturally 'within the jurisdiction.'

His words made Lingu Lanying slightly nervous. She only replied,

"It cannot be attributed to anyone specific... just some folk rumors..."

Li Zhouwei, however, had already arrived before the golden hall. He saw the great doors were wide open. An old man walked out from within, descending the steps. He carried a gold-red blade on his back, held a long-handled spear, and his scarred face was wreathed in smiles.

"Greetings, King Wei! Many thanks to King Wei for lifting the siege!"

Li Zhouwei glanced at him, then surveyed the surroundings.

"General Who Pacifies the Huai, you are truly capable. With so few soldiers and generals, you still managed to hold out for so long."

Situ Huo was clearly a senior, yet he put on no airs at all. He nodded and smiled.

"It was all thanks to this great formation! The Great General personally laid this array, calling it the 'Great Ye Profound Exiled Spirit Formation.' It is truly one of a kind, designed specifically to deal with Buddhist cultivators. Ordinary formations are nothing but useless decorations in front of it!"

His gaze shifted, turning to the faint Underworld chariot in the sky. He changed the subject.

"The second reason... was the Daoist friend in that chariot. But... she should be returning to report by now."

The treasure was submerged in the quiet darkness, and the Exiled Qi had sealed off all information. Li Zhouwei secretly consulted his Immortal Mirror and swept the area. As expected, the chariot was empty.

Situ Huo, however, stared at his golden pupils. Waiting for Li Zhouwei to retract his gaze, he led him forward to take a seat in the main hall. Only then did he speak.

"King Wei, you routed the Zhao army, slew those vile cultivators, and stabilized the war. But the orders from above have not yet arrived, and the surrounding cultivators are watching us like tigers. I wonder... what are King Wei's intentions?"

Li Zhouwei shot him a glance and replied, "I was just about to address that."

Situ Huo raised an eyebrow. He watched Li Zhouwei stand up and retrieve a token from his sleeve. It was black with intricate golden patterns and inscribed with golden characters. Li Zhouwei said:

"I want the General to leave the mountain with me and head south. This place will be handed over to Protector-General Liu to guard."

Situ Huo glanced at the command token and lowered his gaze.

"Oh? And what of Baixiang?"

Li Zhouwei said flatly, "If Baixiang can be held, hold it. If not, give it back to them."

Situ Huo's expression immediately darkened.

"Does King Wei understand what he is saying?" he said coolly. "Baixiang and Xiaoshi are the supporting flanks for Tangdao Mountain. We barely managed to block the north's southward route. If you let it go... the north will have a new passage to bypass Tangdao and advance south..."

He paused, recalling Li Zhouwei's words about heading south. He looked up at him, raising an eyebrow.

"King Wei... you intend to attack the Capital immortals mountain gate?"

Li Zhouwei nodded. "Correct."

This made Situ Huo fall silent.

The three points of Xiaoshi, Tangdao, and Baixiang formed a sprawling, twisted barrier that shielded the plains behind them. Critically, their earth veins and spiritual energy were all strong. With the Purple Mansion Realm formations locking them down in unison, all sensed by Exiled Qi, they could almost completely sever the north's route to attack the Moongaze Lake Wilderness.

But this solid barrier had one weakness: the Baiye region, located at its eastern flank. No matter how strong the defense line was, the passage of Bianyan, Chengyun, and Capital immortals was backed by Xuanmiao and Shanji. If a large number of northern cultivators gathered there, they could thrust straight through and pass unhindered.

Li Zhouwei stared into his eyes.

"We are short on manpower. Baixiang's earth veins are poor, and it lacks a spirit formation like Tangdao's. Not only can we not hold it, but it would also tie up a large number of our forces. Worse, with Baiye at our flank, we'd be exposed on both front and rear. There is nothing stopping Vast Cicada's surprise troops from trying again."

"But if we abandon Baixiang to seize Baiye, relying on the Capital immortals mountain gate, we would gain immense freedom. Although we couldn't keep the enemy out of Jianghuai, we could retreat and use the White River region as a pocket to bleed them dry. Or, we could advance to seize Xuanmiao, cut off Shanji's escape route, and conquer Jiangnan in its entirety."

Situ Huo already understood his meaning. He said nothing for a long time before finally sighing.

"I am well aware that the Great General wishes to reclaim Shanji above all else. But this matter is of vital importance. I cannot make this decision."

Li Zhouwei gave a cold laugh and slammed the command token onto the table.

"Cannot make the decision? Or _unwilling_ to make it!"

Li Zhouwei knew exactly what Situ Huo was thinking. He was simply clinging to the power he held as the General Who Pacifies the Huai and the Military Commissioner of Tangdao!

The greater the power and status one held in the Martial Cultivation's light, the greater the blessing they received. Both were Holders of the Profound, but the difference between the low-titled Li Jianglong and the high minister Li Jiangliang was immense!

'Now that the Zhao troops have retreated, the three-point line of Xiaoshi, Tangdao, and Baixiang is complete. Holding this position requires nearly half of the Great Song's entire strength. As the Military Commissioner of Tangdao, I wield total authority here. My status is naturally supreme, rivaling that of the First Minister!'

'If we abandon Baixiang to take Capital immortals, it's equivalent to splitting the entire Jiangbei defensive line in two. Whether it's Liu Bai or someone else stationed at Capital immortals, I'll suddenly have an equal, and that will greatly dilute the glory of my Martial Cultivation position.'

And that was only if the plan _succeeded_. Situ Huo's heart was filled with even greater suspicion.

'I am the General Who Pacifies the Huai. My fief is Tangdao. He wants to let Liu Bai guard Tangdao Mountain for me? What if something goes wrong with the Capital immortals Dao? What if we fail to take it and suffer a major defeat? If the north counter-attacks, Liu Bai will just abandon this strategic mountain and flee south. All of the Great Song's gains will be lost. And I, as the Military Commissioner, will have lost my own territory. What future would I have left?'

This suspicion was hardly surprising. Li Zhouwei sneered internally.

'They always say the northerners are disunited... as if the south is any different! No one is ever truly working toward the same goal. They were just gasping for air before, forced to temporarily set aside their own interests and squabbles!'

Facing the accusation, Situ Huo lowered his gaze, feigning doubt.

"Why would King Wei say such a thing! I cannot abandon my post without authorization. I must trouble King Wei and Protector-General Liu to make the trip instead."

In Situ Huo's eyes, this was the perfect solution. He, Situ Huo, would not get involved. He would just let Li Zhouwei and Liu Bai go attack the Capital immortals Dao and deal with Qi Lanyan. Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds? Why should he have to go personally and invite all this mutual suspicion?

But the coldness on Li Zhouwei's face faded, replaced by a deepening smile. He didn't bother arguing.

"General Who Pacifies the Huai... you had best think this through."

As the token in his hand began to glow, the Underworld chariot in the sky seemed to tremble faintly. Situ Huo's expression began to change.

Li Zhouwei had, of course, anticipated this. If possible, he wouldn't have wasted a breath on this Daoist Master from the Situ family; he would have just gone with Liu Bai. But the Xuanmiao region was full of cultivators and perilously close to the Capital immortals Dao. In his and Yang Ruiyi's strategy, the Capital immortals Dao was easy to attack but difficult to defend. When the time came, Yang Ruiyi was prepared to abandon all of Jianghuai in exchange for Shanji! And the Great Song's primary concern in that scenario... was guarding against Situ Huo himself.

'If the war situation changes and the order is given to abandon Jianghuai, Liu Bai, guarding Tangdao, will definitely abandon the mountain and retreat south... But what about Situ Huo?'

'That old bastard doesn't have Liu Bai's integrity. He might just hold out until the very last second. Then, when things go wrong and the tides turn, he could 'reluctantly' defect to the Buddhists. By exploiting the chaos, he could still secure an extremely high position!'

This was one of Situ Huo's own schemes all along. The treacherous, two-faced Daoist Master was always waiting for the highest bidder! His ideal path to maximize profit might be to first use True Qi to break through to the Purple Mystery realm and _then_ defect to the Buddhists during a decisive battle. But Yang Ruiyi was no fool. Given the right opportunity, Situ Huo was entirely capable of defecting to the north.

When the Buddhists besieged this mountain earlier, who knew if Situ Huo was already weighing his options? Yang Ruiyi worried day and night in the Wilderness, and more than half of that worry was directed at Situ Huo himself!

And so, as Li Zhouwei's words fell on Situ Huo's ears, accompanied by the trembling of the Underworld chariot high above, understanding dawned on Situ Huo in an instant. He met Li Zhouwei's gaze—a pair of bright golden pupils, stabbing toward him like swords.

'That Yang family member who arrived in the Underworld chariot... she wasn't just guarding the mountain to keep the north guessing. She was also here to intimidate me...'

'And Li Zhouwei, arriving with this token to forcibly transfer me, is the Yang clan's warning!'

The old Daoist Master's gloomy expression flickered for a moment. It was impossible to know what he was truly thinking. His face remained perfectly composed as he smiled, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

"Since King Wei insists, I will naturally obey the order!"

The moment his voice fell, Li Zhouwei's token tumbled from his grasp, dissolving into a cascading waterfall of grey wind. It instantly submerged both their figures in the churning, uncertain currents of Exiled Qi.

A shadow of the Great Void faintly materialized. Situ Huo stood with his hands clasped behind his back, while Li Zhouwei remained silent, his expression tranquil.

'In truth... there was one other candidate to guard Tangdao Mountain.'

Li Zhouwei himself.

Unfortunately, Situ Huo and Liu Bai's relationship was abysmal. Situ Huo was a despicable and sinister man, perfectly willing to grovel and humiliate himself, but Liu Bai found it impossible to get along with him. Yang Ruiyi, fearing this would ruin things, refused to let Li Zhouwei guard the mountain.

And Li Zhouwei was more than happy with that arrangement.

'Breaking mountains and exterminating sects... that suits my Dharma Body perfectly!'

...

Xuanmiao Temple.

The lamps were dim, and Dharma light flickered. A youth with an ethereal brow stood on the mountainside. His eyes, once bright with divine light and natural ease, were now filled with gloom.

Tao Jiexing had returned to Xuanmiao Temple, his expression utterly changed. A faint, lingering despair floated in his eyes. He pushed open the door and entered. The person in the seat of honor was different now, too.

The young man at the head of the hall stood quietly to one side, his face dark with melancholy.

Qi Lanyan had always been proud. His origins in the Profound Governance and the Viewing Pavilion, combined with his fortunate encounter with the Heavenly Element, had pushed his self-satisfaction to its absolute peak. Now, that easy confidence of a master strategist with the world in his grasp was gone. In its place was a deep, disbelieving gloom.

'Vast Cicada has fallen... This is a disaster... Yang Ruiyi...'

The death of Vast Cicada was a world-shattering shock for Qi Lanyan. It wasn't just that a cultivator of Vast Cicada's caliber had been felled in a single blow; what terrified him more was the complete loss of control over the situation and the avalanche of troubles that followed!

Qi Lanyan's heart was a storm of gloom, anger, and urgency. But when he closed his eyes, he found that beneath it all, a faint trace of fear had settled.

This only made him angrier.

The atmosphere in the hall was suffocating. Tao Jiexing, however, could not remain silent. He took a step forward and said through gritted teeth:

"Junior saw that the celestial phenomena in the north were wrong... I suspected my cousin's... Dharma Body had been broken. But... but I performed a divination, and it was obscured by Exiled Qi. I couldn't see clearly. I came specifically to ask Senior..."

Qi Lanyan was speechless for a moment. He could only suppress his surging anger as he replied,

"Your cousin... has fallen."

Tao Jiexing and Li Jieyi had been as close as blood brothers, with a bond that was almost like that of an elder and junior. He had already suspected it, but this sentence confirmed his fears. He immediately bowed his head and began to weep, crying out in grief,

"Cousin... you lost your way! I told you... it was an unjust war! And now it has claimed you! What a tragedy!"

Tao Jiexing had no grasp of social graces. His words were pure gasoline on a fire, causing a Daoist-robed man prostrating nearby to tremble.

'Only he would dare to speak like that... To dare say such things and still have no one reprimand him... It's just too brutal!'

Sure enough, the words sent pulses of rage throbbing in Qi Lanyan's heart. His temples pulsed visibly.

But the Tao family was no ordinary clan. While not on par with his own Martial Uncle, Wei Xuanyin, they were still descendants of a True Monarch. Many of the Tao elders hailed from the Seeking the Purple Pavilion and had extensive connections. He could only force himself to say,

"Jiexing, what is this talk? He was tricked by the Yang clan!"

Tao Jiexing's face was streaked with tears. He looked up, his gaze instantly rebuffing Qi Lanyan's words. The youth gritted his teeth, his usual humility and simplicity shattering to pieces as he sobbed:

"Senior Qi! My cousin wasn't just a Maha of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm! He was a member of my Tao family! He was my cousin! He was Daoist Master Xuanwei's disciple-brother and Daoist Master Shaoxun's disciple! This matter doesn't just concern the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and Mount Dayang!"

Qi Lanyan's expression changed instantly. He hurriedly stepped forward.

"This was the scheming of Li Zhouwei and Yang Ruiyi!"

But the normally timid Tao Jiexing stood up, his brow filled with resolve. He said coldly,

"I will be reporting my cousin's death to my family. Senior Qi... you had better start thinking about how you are going to explain this!"




# Chapter 1106: Convergent Paths

As Qi Lanyan watched Tao Jiexing ride the wind and depart, his expression turned utterly foul. Rage and hatred coiled in his chest with no outlet. Clasping his hands behind his back, he paced three or four steps across the great hall, his silence heavy.

Below, the Daoist-robed man, Fan Kang, waited for some time. He repeatedly glanced up, trying to read his master's shifting expression, and realized he could no longer remain silent. Daring not to mention the matter of Vast Cicada, he could only broach another topic.

"Master... with Baixiang Valley lost... I fear we can no longer keep the enemy out of the Central Plains. The Buddhist cultivators are fickle, but fortunately... the White Ye Immortal Sect is still in our hands."

"It's useless even if we have it!"

The sharp retort stunned Fan Kang into silence. His brow furrowed with worry. He had no choice but to change tactics, saying reluctantly:

"If they move north after taking Baixiang... beyond Baixiang lies the Central Plains, and its defenses are empty... If they became the first cultivators in centuries to breach the North... perhaps that would..."

This only made the youth in the high seat laugh, a sound devoid of humor.

"Yang Ruiyi would never attack Luoxia... not and provoke the northern kings and all the great clans! The Great Song's wings aren't fully grown. Wasn't killing Vast Cicada enough for him? Does he want to send the entire northern court into an uproar? Li Zhouwei is certainly not stupid enough to walk into such a trap!"

He paused, swallowing his next words, and let out a sigh.

"I almost wish he would continue north. It would save us the headache. But I see it... nine times out of ten, he's coming for White Ye."

Fan Kang understood his implication and said quickly:

"We must dispatch men at once..."

Qi Lanyan shot him a cold look.

"And if I send my people to White Ye, what happens when Yang Ruiyi attacks Shanji Prefecture?"

Fan Kang fell silent once more. Qi Lanyan ground his teeth.

"Baixiang Valley was a total rout. With Vast Cicada dead, we've lost a key general, but the situation isn't beyond saving... The real trouble is that our forces there were completely scattered. Not a single one of those Daoist Masters is a fool, and the South's Exiled Qi is terrifying. They're all nursing their wounds; none of them will show their faces anytime soon. Will Touba Ci listen to me? And we can forget about Chengyun. At best, we can only count on Murong Yan and the Helian clan..."

This was the problem that always plagued Qi Lanyan. The various Daoist Masters of the South, despite their different Dao Lineages, were united—at least outwardly—under the pressure of imperial power and True Qi. The cultivators of the North, however, had nearly all come only because they were summoned. If there was no profit in it, who would be willing to die?

These Purple Mansion Realm cultivators ultimately had a say in things; they couldn't be ordered about like servants. Both sides had suffered a defeat, but the Great Zhao's reaction speed was far slower. As it stood, the forces he had on hand were actually at a slight disadvantage against the South.

This put Qi Lanyan in an extremely awkward position. The Exiled Qi and True Qi were potent. Li Zhouwei, Liu Bai... even Situ Huo were all formidable figures. If the North couldn't establish overwhelming dominance against the South, they were likely facing a second rout!

A tremor of fear ran through Qi Lanyan.

'Once they take White Ye as well, the entire western Jiangbei region, the land between the two rivers, will be consolidated. Taking it back then will be immensely more difficult... And the next thing we'll lose is Shanji Prefecture!'

Cold sweat began to bead on his forehead. Fan Kang, who had been playing dumb and subtly guiding the conversation for some time, finally saw his opening. He took a step forward, revealing his true idea.

"In my view... why not strike Baixiang Valley?"

Qi Lanyan, who had opened his mouth to speak, paused. He looked thoughtful.

"Continue."

Fan Kang quickly organized his thoughts, speaking in a low voice.

"Master... Yang Ruiyi's heart is surely still set on Shanji Prefecture. Baixiang Valley is not his primary target. But if he moves to attack the Capital immortals Dao, Baixiang will almost certainly be left undefended. If we negotiate with Jiang Toushou and offer to move west to pin down their forces, he'll almost certainly be tempted. Retaking Baixiang Valley would also restore some of the honor his Mount Dayang has lost..."

"The key point is... those forces won't have to come from our own reserves."

Qi Lanyan nodded. Fan Kang pressed on.

"As for the Capital immortals Dao... in your disciple's opinion, the South is determined to have it. It's indefensible..."

Qi Lanyan's face darkened further. He was about to speak, but Fan Kang cut in.

"But if we take Baixiang Valley, even as we lose the Capital immortals Dao... what does that situation remind you of, Master?"

Qi Lanyan was quiet for a moment. Fan Kang continued:

"The previous life..."

He barely got the words out before the Daoist Master before him silenced him with a fierce glare. Fan Kang immediately corrected himself.

"The Heavenly Element... the vision from the Heavenly Element."

"If nothing had gone awry, that Wei villain should only have had two divine abilities. Originally, Yang Ruiyi was supposed to defend Tangdao Mountain personally, while Vast Cicada's ambush failed. White Ye was to be seized by Li Zhouwei, and Liu Bai and the others would be defending the Shanji Prefecture region..."

"It was precisely because we anticipated the arrangements of the last life that we put so much faith in the Exiled Qi on Tangdao Mountain, thinking we could avoid changing the grand scheme... We never expected to be used, and for the situation to worsen... But, if we proceed as I've suggested..."

Qi Lanyan's eyes lit with understanding.

"If we trade the Capital immortals Dao for Baixiang Valley... the overall situation will be functionally identical to the previous life!"

Fan Kang hurried forward.

"Exactly! As long as we can stabilize Shanji Prefecture, the Great Adoration Dharma Realm cannot sit idly by. They won't watch the Precious Tusk fall into others' hands. Whether they push someone new forward or send reinforcements south, it won't make much difference in the short term."

"What we must do is keep the grand situation unchanged... only then can we maximize the advantage of the Heavenly Element's foresight!"

Qi Lanyan was actually listening. He looked up, his mind working.

"The real changes are that Vast Cicada is dead... and that Li Zhouwei somehow reached the mid-Purple Mansion Realm... The grand scheme must remain the same... That is the only way to maintain our advantage..."

Even as they discussed the tactical shifts, the very words 'Li Zhouwei's mid-Purple Mansion Realm' left a taste of disbelief in his mouth.

"It completely defies all reason!"

To Qi Lanyan, the matter was simply inexplicable. His plan had been more perfect than the Heavenly Element's vision. He had borrowed a Spiritual Treasure and grievously wounded the man. Even if Li Zhouwei healed, his cultivation should have stagnated—so how did he break through instead?

'Don't tell me the more grievous your injuries are, Li Zhouwei, the faster you cultivate!'

This was a disastrous turn of events. Li Zhouwei's Crimson Severing Arrowhead was one of the most detestable of all Bright Yang divine abilities. With that ability mastered, the difficulty of cornering and killing him had just doubled.

'To say nothing of Li Ximing gaining the World's Radiance!'

Though he now saw the best path to mitigate his losses, his heart remained shrouded in gloom. He suddenly snapped:

"I'm asking you—Li Zhouwei... why did he suddenly reach the mid-Purple Mansion Realm!"

Qi Lanyan's mood shifted as fast as turning a page. Fan Kang, still basking in the relief of having convinced him, never expected the sudden, sharp question. He flinched, his entire body trembling, and stammered:

"Disciple... Disciple doesn't know!"

Qi Lanyan's eyes narrowed, a new suspicion dawning.

"You claimed to know everything about his Quest for Gold. You said you even participated in the final battle, only to be cut down by some 'General Chen'... And yet you 'misheard' his cultivation progress?"

Fan Kang was struck dumb, mumbling:

"Disciple truly doesn't know... Disciple..."

Fan Kang mumbled for a long time before a sudden spark of insight lit his mind. He gasped, clapping his hands.

"Disciple understands!"

Qi Lanyan watched him coldly as Fan Kang rushed to explain.

"I understand! The Great Song... and even Moongaze Lake... they must also be favored by the Heavenly Element! Li Ximing never left Ting Province for the Western Sea—it wasn't because my plan disrupted things, it was interference from another 'child' of the Heavenly Element!"

He was struck by the revelation, practically cheering his own conclusion. But Qi Lanyan merely gave him a cool look and sneered.

"Ting Province? Favored by the Heavenly Element? What fantasy are you dreaming up now?"

Rebuffed so sharply, Fan Kang grew even more frantic.

"Master, I..."

Qi Lanyan cut him off.

"There cannot be a Heavenly Element presence in Ting Province! The renowned Azure Insight Origin Mirror hangs over that very lake! How do you think that damnable troublemaker was annihilated back then? They relied on that supreme immortal artifact! The Heavenly Element can manifest in any corner of the world, but it absolutely cannot go to Ting Province!"

"If the direct heirs of the Li family really had knowledge of the future, would they be in their current state? Furthermore, this is hardly a secret to the great figures above. Do you think the myriad eyes in the heavens are blind?"

Fan Kang was speechless. Qi Lanyan, however, smiled.

"And it is especially impossible for it to be Li Zhouwei."

His words hung in the air. Fan Kang, unconvinced, pressed on.

"Then it must be... it must be one of the Great Song's high ministers! Someone who favors the Li clan, and that's why they interfered!"

Qi Lanyan clasped his hands behind his back and turned away.

"You ignorant boy... Do you think the Great Song truly lacks this Heavenly Element? Don't be naive. They are the Underworld, after all! Did you think you were hiding safely under my protection? The great figures in the heavens have known about you for a long time... and the Underworld knows, too! It's simply that none of those lofty figures wish to personally enter the fray and become entangled in the Heavenly Element's karma. So, they all remain silent!"

Fan Kang stared blankly, but Qi Lanyan's own understanding grew clearer by the second. He sneered.

"However, your reminder has made me understand... It's still uncertain if Yang Ruiyi can see the future. But the Underworld clearly wills the world's situation to conform to the Heavenly Element's prophecies. Otherwise, we wouldn't have this opportunity to trade Baixiang Valley for the Capital immortals Dao! You think this is 'convergent paths'? Wrong! It's that _They_ refuse to let it change!"

"The world's situation may not be in _Their_ hands, but it is squarely within _Their_ sight..."

He swallowed the rest of his sentence. His mind was suddenly clear, as if all the scattered pieces had clicked into place. He sneered inwardly.

'If the world's situation changes too drastically, how can those 'children' of the Heavenly Element exploit their foreknowledge? How could they unearth all the legacies of the Encompassing Profoundity? How could the Chuyi Grotto-Heaven be opened? How would the treasures beneath the first mountain continue to emerge? The death of Vast Cicada must have been an accident, one that certainly displeased the powers above!'

'What we alter... must absolutely not be the _current_ grand situation!'

With this realization, Qi Lanyan's mind was sharp and clear. He clapped his hands decisively.

"I understand! Have Gongsun Bei and the others pull back and go to Shanji Prefecture. I will go with the Helian clan to the Capital immortals Dao. We can't let them conquer it too quickly, or we won't have time to reclaim Baixiang Valley... As for that... Spiritual Treasure... I will find an opportunity to borrow it for Gongsun Bei."

His heart was at ease, but Fan Kang remained drenched in cold sweat, stunned speechless. He whispered,

"Then at the Capital immortals Dao... Nuzi and the others..."

Qi Lanyan sneered.

"Is there any need to ask? Even Tao Jiexing has fled. Do you really think those Buddhist cultivators will obediently stay and die for the Capital immortals Dao?"

But at the mention of Tao Jiexing, Qi Lanyan's tone filled with regret.

"It's a pity. The Tao family relationship is a delicate one to manage, and that Spiritual Qi is now unattainable..."

Fan Kang was jolted back to reality by the comment. He stood silent for a moment, feeling that the Qi Lanyan before him was not just paranoid... he was terrifying. His rebirth had given Qi Lanyan an overwhelming advantage, yet this Daoist Master's mind hadn't yielded in the slightest. Instead, he had only grown more stubborn.

'What in the world is he thinking! Is this path he's walking truly a path to survival?'

This thought tormented Fan Kang. He was not a fool. A man who held the future in his hands was bound to have his own calculations. He ventured:

"I understand... Daoist Master, you are thinking whole-heartedly of Sir Wei's interests. But if that is truly the case, you should be leaning on Sir Xue. And if that fails, you should at least be seeking help from the Chunyi Dao Gate..."

He had barely spoken the words when it was as if he had stepped on Qi Lanyan's tail. A flash of fear crossed the Daoist Master's face, instantly replaced by a cold, dark glare.

"The Wu Light and the Sky-Tower of Transformation are parallel Dao-paths. The Unmoving Temple was established long before the Tongxuan Palace... Even True Monarch Xu Xiang must show consideration for his juniors... My Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao may have been built later, but it inherited a true Dao Lineage and possesses its own dignity. Though we are diminished now, we are still under its protection. There is no 'relying' on that side... If you dare mention this again, do not blame me for cleaning the scum from my own house."

The threat snapped Fan Kang back to his senses. He remembered that this was a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, a being who could incinerate him with a single breath. The anxiety in his heart was instantly consumed by terror. He stumbled back a step, his voice trembling.

"Disciple misspoke!"

Qi Lanyan stared at him, his gaze heavy.

"You are merely too impatient. Withdraw and cultivate."

Fan Kang bowed hastily and stumbled away. Qi Lanyan stood alone in the vast hall, his expression cold and severe.

'Tao Jiexing is naive and untested, so easy to read. From his evasiveness, the Tao family must possess the Flawless Deficient Yin. They simply refuse to produce it.'

'Martial Uncle watched Tao Jiexing grow up. Even Vast Cicada had to call Martial Uncle 'senior'. Given the relationship between the Tao family and my Profound Governance, they have no reason to refuse... It seems someone is actively trying to prevent Martial Uncle from seeking the Dao. This situation plays perfectly into their hands!'

He walked to the entrance of the hall. Cool, clear moonlight spilled across the steps. Qi Lanyan felt a complex knot of emotions tighten in his chest.

"Without power, one cannot attain the Dao. Those who have no desire for it find themselves forced to succeed by others. Yet those who truly seek the Dao find their path blocked by a thousand obstacles."

He paced, unable to set his mind at ease. Turning, he went back inside and sat at his desk, an idea forming.

'Just asking the Chunyi Dao Gate isn't enough. Among the Supreme Yang daoist tradition, the Cheng clan is the only one that pretends to be aloof from the world. They have the least backbone. I must find a way to meet with them again.'

The Daoist Master sank deep into thought. Meanwhile, Fan Kang retreated in a daze, his heart overflowing with dread.

'If I continue to follow him... is there any path to survival left for me?'

In his previous life, Fan Kang had been nobody. He'd stumbled upon a great opportunity and nearly fallen into the hands of the Buddhist cultivators. It was Qi Lanyan who had rescued him, taking him—a minor cultivator with no background or foundation—as a disciple. He knew Qi Lanyan had selfish motives, but hadn't he also enjoyed all the benefits of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao? If Qi Lanyan had merely wanted to use him, there was no need to have ever accepted him as a disciple.

But seeing how stubborn his master was, Fan Kang was truly terrified. A thread of confusion wove through his fear.

'With my destiny from the Heavenly Element... if I were to join the Buddhists... wouldn't that also be a great destiny?'

Back then, joining the Buddhists as a mere commoner would have been valuable enough. Now, carrying the status of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao... it was icing on the cake. It was only his conscience that held him back.

'I'll take it one step at a time. If the situation becomes truly impossible... I still have a way out.'

...

The gray clouds hung low, and darkness shrouded the land.

A tall general, hefting a crimson axe, stood suspended in the pitch-black night. After a moment, he glanced at the woman beside him.

"The Exiled Qi and the Upper Shaman are Dao paths skilled in defense, not offense. They specialize in transformation and delay, not in overwhelming force. Yang Ruiyi may have many treasures, but he has not yet passed the Purple Mystery. You may rest easy, Daoist Friend."

His words sent a chill through Kong Tingyun's heart. Gongsun Bei had led Mingxiang and the others south to attack the Great Song. Kong Tingyun had seen long ago that Qi Lanyan had no real intention of achieving victory. This force would have been considerable elsewhere, but to think it could make a dent in the Great Song's heavily fortified Jiangnan was a fool's dream.

'He's just tying down their forces, keeping the Great Song from focusing elsewhere.'

Just as she'd thought. Gongsun Bei had no Spiritual Treasure. Their combined strength was only enough to let them advance and retreat at will within the Exiled Qi. But now, his words clearly signaled that the situation was about to be reversed.

She replied,

"My only concern is for the North."

Gongsun Bei sighed.

"That is beyond our control. We must simply await our orders."

His words were meant as comfort, but they only made Kong Tingyun feel more powerless. Her heart skipped.

'There must have been a great defeat.'

To put it nicely, she, Kong Tingyun, was a puppet. To put it bluntly, she was just a figurehead. But it was precisely this understanding of her own position that gave this intelligent woman an uncommon-sharpness.

Qi Lanyan had always been composed, or at least, he had always maintained the dignity befitting his Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao. He used to at least pretend to be her Daoist friend, discussing matters with her. But now, there was not a single scrap of news. This spoke volumes of the panic—or at least, the paranoia—back at Xuanmiao Temple.

'He's too preoccupied to bother with the pretense anymore.'

This was Kong Tingyun's sorrow. The puppet had been put back in her box. She could only stare silently at the black clouds overhead. Beside her, Gongsun Bei gave her a passing glance.

"Where is the disk for the grand-array?"

Kong Tingyun inclined her head in a polite gesture, sneering inwardly. Her face remained calm.

"Naturally, that is not information I possess."

Nearby, Kong Xiaxiang knelt at the foot of the steps, as still as a statue.

Gongsun Bei gave an awkward laugh, failing to hide the anxiety in his eyes. He stared grimly at the night sky, where a smear of silver-red, like tarnished mercury, was rapidly ascending. As if to break the tension, he frowned and muttered,

"I didn't expect that Cheng Qian to be here... His abilities are quite profound. It's fortunate his cultivation is still low, or he would be a serious problem."

Kong Tingyun said coolly,

"The General cultivates the Dawn Qi, after all. That Dao is known for its unstable main position and its powerful 'intercalary' branches. It is said that 'three parts become the dawn.' When encountering the Whole Pill, which masters transformation, it is natural that he would have many ways to counter you."

Gongsun Bei clearly hadn't expected such an analysis from her.

"You have sharp insight, Daoist Friend!"

Kong Tingyun replied, her voice even.

"I was, after all, acknowledged by the Zhaoyao Mountain lineage. By that measure, I suppose I count as a disciple of Comprehending Profoundity. I have read a Daoist text or two. I cannot compare to the General's vast, battle-won experience."

Though Kong Tingyun was mild and gentle by nature, she was not one to suffer a slight. Her words were like a needle hidden in silk, a subtle warning. Gongsun Bei's talent was high, and he had carved out a great name for himself, but compared to the direct bloodlines of the True Monarchs or the orthodox Dao Lineages of the Three Profoundities, he was nothing. If he were, he wouldn't be in his current position, ordered about by all and sundry.

A thousand years prior, had Kong Tingyun possessed her current Purple Mansion Realm cultivation _and_ her Zhaoyao Mountain lineage, Gongsun Bei would have had to address her as 'Your Excellency'.

He looked as if he wanted to speak, but held his tongue, a new layer of caution in his eyes.

"My apologies... I overstepped."

After a long moment, a streak of light retreated from the fray. It was a monk, clutching a treasure. His face was pale, his body battered, and he descended without a word.

It was Mingxiang.

Gongsun Bei immediately shot into the sky to take his place in the formation. Mingxiang brushed the lingering Exiled Qi from his robes and spat out a mouthful of black blood. His expression, however, was free of worry. He smiled at Kong Tingyun.

"Many thanks for your protection, Daoist Friend."

Kong Tingyun was not a rigid person. Furthermore, since reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, she had come to understand certain... less-known aspects of Daoist Master Changxi. She even knew that Changxi had once been on friendly terms with Tian Langzhi. The Way of Great Desire was infinitely more cruel than the Lotus Temple. She pressed her palms together.

"Great Virtue, you are too kind."

Mingxiang smiled.

"Sect Master, you worry too much."

Kong Tingyun sighed.

"With Exiled Qi filling the heavens, how can I not?"

Mingxiang waved his hand, switching his form of address.

"Patron, be at ease. The grand-array here is not much inferior to the one Yang Ruiyi established on Tangdao Mountain. The South may be able to break it, but not easily."

The monk chuckled.

"Patron, you see these northern cultivators with their profound cultivation, and these Buddhist cultivators acting so arrogantly, but in truth, their situation is far worse than yours. If something truly goes wrong, they die, and that's the end of it. But you? You have the entire Profound Governance, and even greater powers, ensuring your safety."

Kong Tingyun looked at him as he continued.

"What you need to do now is not worry, but to cultivate and break through with all your ability. If you can pass the Purple Mystery, even the masters of Comprehending Profoundity will have to look at you in a new light!"

"Thank you for the reminder, Daoist Friend."

Kong Tingyun was exceptionally bright; it wasn't that she didn't understand this. But of all the cultivators who had come and gone, it was Mingxiang, a monk, who had set aside status to speak such truths to her. She felt a flicker of acknowledgment, followed by a wave of profound bitterness.

'But how much time will I be given? Fifty years? A hundred? Pass the Purple Mystery? My aptitude is dull. It was a monumental struggle just to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. How can I possibly cultivate faster than the likes of Qi Lanyan?'

She lowered her gaze.

'Even with... even with the Art of Rebirth, the chances are slim.'

Kong Tingyun lapsed into silence. An unknown amount of time passed, until suddenly, the gray winds in the sky began to roll back. The spiritual brilliance faded, and all the profound abilities retracted at once, like a great whale inhaling the sea. They vanished back into the dark hall, and the sky fell quiet.

Both she and Mingxiang stared, stunned. Kong Tingyun's hands immediately flew into a series of seals. Just as she began to cast, a deafening, earth-shaking roar of cheers erupted from the foot of the mountain. It came in waves, one louder than the next.

"Great victory at Baixiang Valley!"

The cry seemed to shake the heavens. Kong Tingyun was momentarily speechless. Beside her, however, Mingxiang clapped his hands, his face a mask of pure mockery.

"Oh!"

Then, another cry,

"Vast Cicada has been slain!"

The monk looked even more delighted. His mouth moved, but no sound came out. Kong Tingyun could just barely make out the word he was mouthing.

'Wonderful!'

But she had no time to spare for the feuds between monks. Her gaze was fixed on the southern horizon, which was awash in spectacular color.

Illusory rainbows wheeled across the sky. A deluge of what looked like blood-rain fell, and within the roiling crimson clouds, a great tomb seemed to be sealing itself shut as countless sacrificial objects tumbled from the sky. Kong Tingyun whispered:

"Who has fallen?"

Mingxiang frowned, his fingers blurring as he tried to calculate. But the threads of destiny were a tangled mess. Based on only the roughest deductions, he shook his head.

"No one has fallen... Someone in the Great Song has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

Kong Tingyun focused her gaze, her expression turning grim.

"In Linhai Prefecture."

Mingxiang looked thoughtful.

"That... King of Nanjia, from the Lingu clan?"

"No... The Lingu clan is spent. Lingu Lanying was an accident. How could there be a second? For such a heaven-shaking phenomenon, their Dao Lineage and foundation must be astonishing..."

Kong Tingyun closed her eyes, a look of dread on her face.

"It is the Great Xiukui Monastery."




# Chapter 1107: Kuidu

Tiger's Frontier, Great Xiukui Monastery.

The ancient stone bricks were suffused with an air of antiquity. Daoist flags fluttered over grounds buried in snow. The once-famous Great Xiukui Monastery was now empty. Even the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator who used to sweep the summit like a handyman was gone. Withered yellow leaves lay scattered in the snow, painting a scene of utter desolation.

A Daoist Master in black robes stood silently in the courtyard. At his feet knelt a youth, tears streaming down his face as he stammered out his report, periodically pounding the ground in anguish.

Lin Chensheng felt as if he were in a waking nightmare.

"I'm the only one left?"

What was the Great Xiukui Monastery like before he, Lin Chensheng, entered seclusion?

Internally, it was guarded by a contemporary Sword Immortal, the last Xiukui's Choosen One to have entered Profound Truth Mountain. Externally, it had a heroic middle-stage Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master in his prime, his methods superb. And then there was the brilliant rising star, who had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm at a shockingly young age!

If not a power that shook all of Jiangnan, they were at least the undisputed third pillar of the Yue State's Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. They suppressed Crimson Reef to the east and held the line against Ting Lei to the south. He, Lin Chensheng, was a prodigy of Xiukui. When he slew Guo Hong'er at sea, even Daoist Master Tianwan hadn't dared to say a word!

And now? He had emerged from his breakthrough, shattering his bottleneck, high-spirited, ready to carry on the divine ability of the third generation... only to find a dilapidated courtyard and fields of melting snow.

'The Sword Immortal Choosen One... slain in Qinling. The Monastery Lord... captured by talisman and executed. Both fell on the same day... Only my uncle struggles on, but they... they still refuse to stop... They are determined to eradicate our divine ability!'

Lin Chensheng closed his eyes for a long moment. Wiping the tears from his face, he said,

"Take me... to see Uncle."

Lin Ya scrambled to his feet, his face abnormally pale. He led him into the Kuidu Palace, guiding him past a Spiritual Treasure pill furnace and into a hidden passage. They descended deep into the darkness before arriving at a small, hidden chamber.

The room was barely ten feet across, constructed from dark wood. On a small platform in the center rested a palm-sized wooden sarcophagus. An incense burner sat on the floor, holding three spent incense sticks.

A small, brown-patterned pouch lay discarded in a corner.

Lin Ya did not dare to enter.

"Daoist Master, you only need to light the incense!" he wept. "This junior will wait outside!"

Swallowing his grief, Lin Chensheng used a divine ability to light the incense. He waited, but there was no sound. He raised his head, tears welling anew.

"Uncle... Chensheng has attained the divine ability! Uncle!"

After a long while, a sound came from the wooden sarcophagus. Something seemed to be shifting inside. A voice, faint as a whisper, emerged.

"Good..."

The voice was hoarse and trembling, laced with unbearable agony. Yet Lin Chensheng could faintly recognize his elder's voice. His hands shook, uncertain what to do.

"Uncle..." he murmured.

Houfu's voice suddenly grew stronger.

"Did the Lingu family succeed!"

A dark premonition surfaced in Lin Chensheng's heart.

"Lingu Lanying did not fail us!" he cried.

The man in the sarcophagus cried out, his voice thick with sorrow.

"Chensheng... to stand firm is death; to defect is life. Leave Tiger's Frontier. Go to the Yang clan, quickly! Chensheng! Lingu must listen to you... In this flourishing age of True Qi, Xiukui's many treasures will be of great use. You must seize this chance for yourself!"

"Wonderful! This junior now understands the old Daoist Master's intentions!"

Lin Chensheng couldn't believe those words—'To stand firm is death; to defect is life'—had come from his own uncle. He felt nothing but pain, tears streaming unchecked.

"Uncle, please take care... I still need your guidance. Whatever medicines or pills you need, I will fetch them for you!"

The wooden sarcophagus fell silent.

Lin Chensheng knelt, seized by a panic he couldn't control. He didn't know how long he knelt there. He opened his mouth to ask again, but then he heard Houfu's low voice once more.

"I have suffered the calamity of the Crystalline Wu Earth for twenty-five years. For ten years, the pain was like being flayed by knives, chopped by axes, scorched by fire, and drowned by water. For another ten, it was like sharp blades grinding my bones and shattering thunder. The last five years have been spent stripping my soul and seizing my mind."

"I worried Xiukui could not survive this trial, so I endured it all."

The small sarcophagus vibrated slightly, as if its occupant were restlessly turning over. Amidst the drifting incense smoke, Houfu continued.

"When I was born, snow filled the sky, white strands like immortal ropes, yet the moonlight shone through like water. Father was overjoyed. Following ancient custom, he asked a Sword Immortal to grant me a name. That old senior was at Profound Truth discussing the Dao, and he consulted Daoist Master Shang Miao... Her divination skills were astounding. After long consideration, she replied: 'The Supreme Yang lineage is currently in the generation of _Guang_ (Vast). The Xiukui Daoist Tradition is in the generation of _Hou_ (After). He shall be known as Houfu.'"

"A _fu_... is the spiritual cord for a great sarcophagus. To aid in a funeral, one must hold the cord. Thus, I, Lin Wei, am the spiritual cord for the Supreme Yang sarcophagus. Our Xiukui Monastery often deals in matters of life and death, so we did not see this as inauspicious and accepted the name. Thinking on it today, Daoist Master Shang Miao was truly benevolent. It was a hidden warning."

Lin Chensheng stared blankly at the sarcophagus. The man inside, reduced to a sliver of True Spirit and a trace of divine ability, still possessed the unyielding pride of Houfu of the Great Xiukui Monastery.

"The North sought to use my 'noble integrity' to control Xiukui. They thought that by leaving me an escape route, I would cling to the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition's last shred of dignity. They wanted to impale me on the horns of a dilemma, torn between my integrity and the Daoist Tradition. It would have been better if Lin Wei had just died at Xuanmiao Temple! Died twenty-five years ago!"

"Cultivators of the Great Xiukui Monastery can accept execution, but never humiliation! The Supreme Yang has lost its luster. Today, I die for it!"

Lin Chensheng's mind went blank. Colors swirled before his eyes, and a fine, dense cracking filled his ears. The wooden sarcophagus, as if it had been baked under a harsh sun for ten days, crumbled into fragments with a series of sharp cracks.

The glowing gravel and gray ash within spilled out, but the flow was weak, collapsing into a pile that buried his knees.

_Patak._

Daoist Master Houfu, Lin Wei, had exhausted his last shred of life-mandate. A dignified Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, so honored in life, died without a single heaven-shaking phenomenon, without the lament of his Daoist Tradition.

A pile of ash. That was all.

Lin Chensheng knelt in a daze for an unknown time. Only when he heard Lin Ya's terrified kowtowing from outside did he snap back to reality. He numbly picked up the cloth bag from the corner and, his spirit lost, retreated the way he had come.

Outside the hall, the sky was filled with heavy snow under a bright, clear moon.

He walked back to his original spot, his boots leaving deep prints in the snow and withered leaves. The youth followed him out and knelt before him, kowtowing as if he already knew what had happened.

Lin Chensheng looked back at the great hall, a sense of dread and unfamiliarity creeping over him. As the moon climbed higher, the plaque above the entrance slowly began to glow.

Kuidu Palace.

...

The Capital immortals mountain gate was situated above White Ye. The surrounding lands were dominated by hills, and a turbid river surged past, casting a gray, gloomy pall over the landscape. The mountains were riddled with caves and grottos, carved with all manner of ghouls, monsters, and spirits. The high halls, in contrast, were built of seamless bluestone.

The faint light of divine abilities flickered on the ground. After a moment of silence, the portly figure in the highest seat sneered, seemingly to himself.

"It seems you've received your orders as well... A pack of cowards, frightened out of their wits by Vast Cicada's death. Now they're reduced to ordering us around."

As his voice faded, a figure stepped from the Great Void and replied,

"The Helian family is indebted to the Profound Governance. We will naturally do our utmost."

"Utmost?"

The gray light of Valley Water flared as Murong Yan spoke, his voice indifferent. 

"I cultivate 'Valley Water'; I come and go as I please. Your Helian family cultivates Baleful Qi. Without reinforcements from Xuanmiao, would you dare linger? I doubt Li Zhouwei is the only one who came!"

His words were sharp. Helian Wujiang crossed his arms and replied casually, 

"'Valley Water' certainly has its merits in facing calamities... But I ask you, fellow Daoist, if you were in Vast Cicada's position, what confidence would you have of escaping? Li Zhouwei alone is more than you could handle!"

Helian Wujiang lacked a backer like the Murong family and clearly didn't dare challenge the Profound Governance. He deftly deflected the topic, but Murong Yan merely chuckled.

"I appreciate your concern, fellow Daoist... but I am not stained by Bright Yang's karma. My Valley Water divine ability is growing. If we fight, who _really_ stands to lose? It certainly won't be me!"

Helian Wujiang's heart darkened.

He knew Murong Yan was capable. Valley Water was a prominent Great Dao. If this man had used his full strength, the situation here would never have deteriorated to this point. But that fateful battle at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter had, by a twist of fate, prevented enmity from forming between the Murong family and the Li clan. Instead, it had made Murong Yan aware of the schemes against him from within the Compassion Buddhist Land.

He had changed completely after that. This Daoist Master simply wore that ugly skin-bag, shadowboxing, refusing to commit to a decisive move!

Helian Wujiang shot him a dark look and said in a low voice,

"You had better have an explanation ready, fellow Daoist. Do you truly believe you can stay aloof forever? You walk the riverbank too often; eventually, your shoes will get wet. Your... freedom... is only because the right person has not yet been tempted to act against you."

The threat landed. Murong Yan's face grew visibly darker. The skin-bag he wore was already ugly; this made it grotesque. He had no rebuttal.

'I can avoid it once or twice, but can I avoid it ten or twenty times? As long as those in the Buddhist Land haven't given up, I'll be dragged into this karmic debt sooner or later!'

The two Daoist Masters sparred verbally. Far below them, a man in black robes knelt on the lowest step, his head bowed so low it almost touched the floor, not daring to utter a sound.

A dark shadow fell over Gongsun Bofan's heart.

Ever since Guan Gongxiao and Guan Lingdie had entered seclusion, their own Daoist Master Yehui almost never visited the Capital immortals Dao. The cultivation of the main family's direct line grew weaker with each generation. The Guan family was small to begin with, and its power within the sect had gradually been divided, allowing many Guest Retainers with different surnames to rise.

For Guest Retainers like him, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing. But Gongsun Bofan was no fool. He had long sensed that something was wrong... but what could he do?

'It has truly come to this.'

He didn't recognize either of the Daoist Masters in the hall, but their words terrified him. His mind was reeling when the two above him suddenly fell silent. A calm, flat voice echoed through the hall.

"Activate the formation. Meet the enemy."

Gongsun Bofan knew the order was for him. He scrambled to his feet, fumbling for a token, and shone it at a nearby jade platform.

Above the hall, the sky-blotting black light of the great formation pulsed, then slowly turned transparent. It revealed a horrifying vista: boundless, multicolored blood clouds warring with the Heavenly Light!

A youth stood against the horizon, clad in black-gold Qilin armor. His purple-feathered Campaign Cloak snapped in the wind, magnificent and imposing. A long halberd was planted in the clouds beside him. At his feet stood three Holder of the Profound youths: one in blue-purple armor like a general, one in handsome blue-white robes, and one in a cloud-robe, gripping a profound sword.

Their eyes were all golden.

Gongsun Bofan, a man known for his composure, felt his legs turn to jelly.

'Li Zhouwei... White Qilin...'

The face was familiar, yet foreign. Gongsun Bofan saw only a terrifying majesty, a ferocious aura. The surface-level calm and thoughtfulness he remembered were gone, replaced by something that felt... inevitable.

Scenes from the past flashed before his eyes. He had followed Guan Gongxiao, suffering losses at Li Zhouwei's hands. Decades had passed in a blink—not so long for a cultivator. He himself had progressed rapidly, climbing from the middle stage of Foundation Establishment Realm to its peak, with nowhere left to go...

'And him? He already commands a divine ability, his presence overwhelming all cultivators. He personally slew the fifth-generation Maha, striking terror into the hearts of all who wield such power...'

And Guan Gongxiao? He was still struggling, uncertain if he could even attain a divine ability.

"Clang!"

The two sides confronting each other above White Ye exchanged no words. Li Zhouwei had already drawn his halberd, erupting with power as he plummeted from the sky!

"Boom!"

A brilliant, illusory-white light shot skyward to meet him. It was that Spiritual Artifact, which was neither staff nor sword.

The River-Wall Staff. Murong Yan!

Whether from fear or spite, and even knowing Li Zhouwei's Audience with the Celestial Gate was damaged and unrecovered, Helian Wujiang had chosen to face Situ Huo, leaving Li Zhouwei to Murong Yan.

But the tables had turned long ago. The Li Zhouwei who had just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, alone and unarmed, was gone.

The man Murong Yan faced now was a middle-stage Purple Mansion Realm King Wei of the Great Song.

Even though Murong Yan had been at this stage for longer, and knew his opponent was injured, his expression was grave. He attacked with his full strength.

In an instant, a gale howled and the world went dark. A vast, golden-sun-drenched desert manifested once more, solemn and immense. Murong Yan's expression flickered. A torrent of gray light surged from him, and though it was a much smaller domain, it steadily held the opposing divine ability at bay.

On the other side, Helian Wujiang squared off against Situ Huo. He touched the three Spiritual Artifacts at his waist, only to receive an indifferent glance from the old man. Situ Huo quietly rested a hand on the golden-red saber at his back and sneered.

"Courting death."

His heart was cold with arrogant fury.

'Even if Li Zhouwei just slew Vast Cicada, you have no right to assume he is more dangerous than I.'

Facing Helian Wujiang, Situ Huo's subservient, shameless demeanor vanished, replaced by the cold, bone-deep arrogance he truly possessed. He looked at his opponent with utter contempt.

Helian Wujiang, though not the strongest of his peers and more focused on cultivation than killing arts, was no easy target. He coldly drew his technique-sword. But as he did, a golden ring echoed, and the man before him vanished!

Monarch's Lost Sheep.

The old man reappeared instantly behind Helian Wujiang, his saber drawn in a vicious arc.

Blood-Omen Tower!

A pillar of blood-light tore through the sky!

After centuries, this blood-drenched blade once again gleamed on the mainland. The crimson light flared and vanished in a heartbeat, fast enough to numb the mind. With two items comparable to Spiritual Treasures used in tandem, Helian Wujiang—a dignified middle-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who knew an attack was coming—was still half a beat too slow.

A red line appeared on his throat. In that same instant, his Body Divine Ability flared, his entire form dissolving into a cascading waterfall of black mist, shot through with streaks of blood, scattering in all directions.

Thousand-Hundred Body.

Golden Malice roiled on Situ Huo's body, clinging to him. He watched the baleful mist disperse, a cold smile touching his lips.

"The great divine ability, 'Clamping Hatred's Mouth,' which shook the Middle Ages... you cast aside the trunk to grasp the branches, turning it into this pathetic little self-preservation art. Pathetic!"

Helian Wujiang, wounded by the saber strike, felt his divine ability destabilize. The blood-light within his misty form pulsed. Unable to speak, he projected his voice with his power:

"Try me, old dog!"

His Helian family, though demonic cultivators who practiced with Baleful Qi, were converts, not founders of the path. Their most talented ancestor had focused on the Whole Pill. They couldn't compare to a true demonic Daoist Tradition like the Touba family, who possessed countless powerful arts. He knew 'Thousand-Hundred Body' was inferior.

But he had his reasons for daring to confront Situ Huo.

'Baleful Qi naturally counters Metal Virtue! 'Thousand-Hundred Body' may be inferior, but it's perfect for resisting his metal-qi divine ability!'

Situ Huo watched him coolly. Reversing his grip on the saber, he drew a bowl from his sleeve and collected the ambient metal-qi. But he didn't immediately move against Helian Wujiang. Instead, he paused and cast a sideways glance at Li Zhouwei.

The old fox's eyes narrowed. He understood.

'Qi Lanyan has abandoned Capital immortals. If he truly intended to defend this place, he never would have sent just these two defeated generals.'

The cultivators at the Capital immortals Dao gate wouldn't even protect Yehui, so they were a lost cause. But Shanji absolutely could not be lost. What, then, was the plan? Situ Huo's heart grew colder.

'Yang Ruiyi's warning wasn't just talk. He is determined to divide my power in Jiangbei... Slowing my breakthrough to the Purple Mystery realm... that's how he maintains his balance of power!'

# Chapter 1108: The Silver Drum

Golden flames surged skyward as baleful light erupted. In the rolling sandstorm that flickered in and out of view, even the Great Void seemed to undulate. As the long saber slid back into its sheath, blood-like spatters of light pulsed, captivating the soul.

On the earth below, ranks of soldiers stood in grim silence. Their white-jade armor gleamed, and every man held a handleless silver blade, encircling the entire mountain gate. Three Holders of the Profound stood apart, guiding divine abilities and refining treasures. Tens of thousands of silver streams of light leaped from the soldiers, feeding the dense, roiling silver lightning in the sky as it relentlessly battered the great formation.

This was precisely the Stormshatter Wedges!

Although the Stormshatter Wedges were precious enough to be Spiritual Artifacts, their true marvel lay in their divisibility. They could be split into tens of thousands of small, handleless wedges, usable in groups of three or five. They could even be taken out by sect disciples for training. In a situation like this, they could be armed to tens of thousands of soldiers to break a formation in unison.

The Great Void was dark and soundless. A young man stood within it, wearing a tall crown and a black-and-silver Daoist robe embroidered with profound patterns. A purple-striped silk ribbon at his waist glowed faintly, partially obscuring his figure.

He watched as the baleful qi was beaten into a pained, steady retreat. If not for a divine ability sustaining it, its foundation would have already been damaged. The youth’s expression, however, remained utterly unmoved, as if this was all expected.

'Situ Huo... from the looks of it, that's the Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra. It's the Dao Lineage of True Monarch Xuhua, the one who grasped the transformation of primordial metal into magnetism to enter the Whole Pill realm... It seems Situ Tang really was Golden Feather's handiwork. The Dao Lineage must be in Golden Feather’s hands.'

'In other words... that lord's obsession with the Whole Pill isn't just a few centuries old. He used Situ Tang to unlock the Dao Lineage back then, only to seize it in secret... But the Dragon-kin couldn't tolerate it and personally stepped in to cripple him.'

He watched coldly as Helian Wujiang fled for his life.

'The two great unorthodox Dao lineages of the Whole Pill... to think they would collide like this.'

Qi Lanyan had naturally come to retrieve the pair, but that wasn't his only reason. He truly couldn't restrain himself. He had to see it.

The Crimson Severing Arrowhead.

His gaze turned icy as he stared at the Desert Sky-Platform looming over the sect. The hand resting on his sleeve twitched twice.

'A vast desert, crimson light like blood, bright days and dark nights, a gloom as heavy as yin...'

What did this mean?

'This is a supreme emperor's scripture, on the level of those secretly passed down in the Wei Palace—where did he get it?'

This was no simple trinket. It was absolutely not like the Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass, which could be obtained from the Li Clan's old retainers!

'The remnants of the dynasty must have given it to him...'

It was already suspicious whether Xuan'an even possessed the true Bright Yang transmission. The suppression of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead had been deliberate. For Li Zhouwei to be standing here now, wielding such a divine ability, was deeply unnerving.

Qi Lanyan pondered for a long time before finally, secretly, making up his mind.

"He has the Emperor's Scripture for the Crimson Severing Arrowhead now. Who knows if next time it will be the Great Illumination Imperial Monarch Scripture and the Profound Scripture of Origin Contemplation and Manifestation? This cannot be taken lightly. I must report this to my superiors."

Divine abilities achieved in the Purple Mansion Realm were typically derived from fourth or fifth-grade cultivation methods. What truly determined the vastness of a divine ability was one's Dao-Profundity and skill. But that didn't mean the method itself had no influence. If he had obtained one of those true Wei Palace transmissions, his power would be undeniable!

Fan Kang might be able to see the future, but he clearly couldn't know the specifics of Li Zhouwei's cultivation method. What troubled Qi Lanyan even more... was that Mount Luoxia very likely didn't care about Li Zhouwei's methods or divine abilities at all!

'The more powerful Li Zhouwei's divine ability, the more effective he'll be at overthrowing the Wei Emperor... Whether it's the Underworld or Luoxia, they are both incredibly accommodating of his future. To resolve this suspicion... or even to place some limits on him, I need to find a lord from the mountain who _doesn't_ want his divine abilities to become too vast...'

He fell silent for a moment, a candidate already in mind.

'Once this is over, I should make a trip back to Long territory.'

The silver light beneath his feet grew increasingly fractured. Having watched his fill, Qi Lanyan finally made his move. He retrieved a pair of objects from his sleeve.

One of the items was the size of a fist, silver-white as snow. It was an exquisite little silver drum, carved with abstruse runes. Long golden tassels hung from its sides, and tied to it were three small, round mallets of different colors.

Qi Lanyan selected the silver mallet, solemnly regulated his divine ability, and finally tapped it lightly against the silver drum.

"Dong!"

Though the drum was small, the strike unleashed a terrifying silver storm, faintly tinged with gold. It blasted out from the Great Void, instantly engulfing the entire sky at a frightening speed.

"BOOM!"

The Desert Sky-Platform of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead should have borne the brunt of the attack. But at that exact moment, Li Zhouwei retracted his divine ability, shifting and teleporting away. Instead, Situ Huo's roiling golden wind was left to face it head-on.

The golden wind divine ability was visibly annihilated by the lightning. Situ Huo was immediately blasted from the sky. The old fox was extremely cautious; his expression changed dramatically as he sheathed his saber, activating Monarch's Lost Sheep at full power, trying to flee.

But a golden light mixed within the flowing lightning pinned him in place, rendering him immobile!

It wasn't just Situ Huo. The entire sky seemed to be suppressed by that thin, golden light. Helian Wujiang, who was also struck down and coughing up blood; Murong Yan, whose face instantly paled; and even Li Zhouwei... all of them were frozen in place.

The man in the Great Void showed no surprise. He had already unwound the purple silk ribbon from his waist, wrapping it around one wrist. With a hook and pull of his other hand, Murong Yan and Helian Wujiang vanished from the mortal world.

"Kacha."

The thin golden light instantly shattered. The lightning across the heavens rapidly dispersed. Li Zhouwei withdrew his gaze and turned to look at Situ Huo. The old man's expression was ugly. He said nothing for a long moment before finally spitting out a crackle of lightning, a silver light flashing around his lips.

'Qi Lanyan's treasure.'

With the Immortal Mirror, Li Zhouwei had seen everything clearly. The timing of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead's retraction had seemed accidental, but it was he who had intentionally guided it during the fight...

'That silver lightning specifically targets light and baleful qi. It must be designed for large-scale spell-type divine abilities and some manifested, drifting Body Divine Abilities...'

Besides his own, Situ Huo's rolling golden wind, Helian Wujiang's baleful wind form, and Murong Yan's Valley Water divine ability had all been struck by the lightning. They clearly hadn't fared well.

'As for that golden lightning... a charge from Sovereign's Perilous Tread could break it, but he wouldn't be stupid enough to use that casually. If caught off guard, it could turn the tide of battle. The only fortunate thing is... it doesn't seem to have much direct offensive power. Or perhaps he just hasn't used it yet.'

Qi Lanyan might despise Southern cultivators, but Li Zhouwei was keenly aware of the threat he posed. Finally seeing a glimpse of his profound abilities was an unexpected gain. He shifted his gaze and called out a reminder.

"General Situ, even Monarch's Lost Sheep couldn't escape it?"

Situ Huo's expression was still grim. He shook his head gravely.

"He is an 'upper cultivator' from the North, a product of Profound Governance, and he wields a supreme treasure. How could I possibly resist?"

He said the words, but having his life-saving trump card shattered by a single, casual move had clearly left Situ Huo shaken. The two had no intention of giving chase and stopped where they were.

Below them, the dense silver lightning continued to swarm the formation. Li Zhouwei glanced down. The nearby Li Jiangliang immediately turned and barked an order. A heaven-shaking cry rose from the troops below.

"The Northern cultivator has fled in defeat! Open the formation!"

The sound thundered across the land, shaking the entire region. But the mountain remained utterly silent. Not a single movement. Situ Huo descended on the wind, sneered, and said:

"The White Ye Immortal Sect was tormented by that band of Buddhist cultivators, and then several Purple Mansion Realm experts forced their way in... I'd say..."

Li Zhouwei's eyes narrowed slightly. He spoke with keen interest.

"I'd say not necessarily."

Situ Huo retracted his gaze and chuckled.

"Oh?"

"BOOM!"

Sure enough, the lightning surged with growing intensity. A tremor ran through the mountain, and the great formation's light barrier finally dissolved like water. Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and drew his long halberd. As the Heavenly Light flared, roiling black flames instantly engulfed the sky. From the base of the mountain, a limitless cry for slaughter erupted.

"Kill!"

...

The stone hall at the summit was stained with blood, littered with corpses.

Gongsun Bofan leaned quietly against the stone steps, the true essence and dharma power in his body long since exhausted. His limbs were shattered, his eyes a dull, ashen white. He stared blankly at the ceiling of the greenstone hall, where rolling black flames now climbed the stone, as if igniting something invisible.

The first to fight their way to the Capital immortals Dao summit had, naturally, been the Guest Retainers.

The jade talisman to control the formation had been given to him by Yehui personally. Gongsun Bofan had served under the Daoist Master for a long time. Knowing the situation was lost, he had still fought against many. Though his cultivation was high, two fists couldn't fend off four hands, and he had fallen.

But the group of rebel cultivators needed a scapegoat, so Gongsun Bofan had been left alive. Several unknown Guest Retainers knelt meekly on the path, holding a blood-stained jade tablet. Their faint, unified cries drifted up.

"This humble cultivator pays his respects to the Daoist Master! We congratulate the heavenly soldiers on entering the mountain!"

Gongsun Bofan heard no reply. There was only the faint sound of boots on stone and the vague sensation of a hot wind. Beside the high jade platform, a figure had appeared.

The young man stood with his hands clasped behind him, meticulously observing the formation disk on the jade platform.

Clearly, whether Capital immortals Dao lived or died, who had killed whom, or who had remained loyal to Bai Ziyu, was not worthy of this Daoist Master's slightest attention. The entire Capital immortals Dao, all tied together, was worth less than a single rune on that disk.

'A pity...'

The last wisp of energy Gongsun Bofan was holding onto began to dissipate. His consciousness drifted, but then he vaguely sensed a surge of heat rush into his Shengyang Acupoint. It was like a diver surfacing and taking a sudden, desperate breath. Everything before him snapped into sharp focus.

A pair of golden eyes was reflected in his own.

"Where is the secret vault?"

Only then did Gongsun Bofan realize he was kneeling upright. His limbs felt perfectly normal. Only his shattered armor testified to the brutal battle. The man stared, stunned, as if waking from another life, before bowing his head.

"The Daoist Master did not establish a secret vault. The Dao Lineage is passed down personally; it has its own treasury."

Li Zhouwei wasn't surprised.

Yehui had come to the North-South war as an opportunist; how could he possibly treat the White Ye Immortal Sect as his own sanctuary? Preserving this formation was already his greatest gain.

'A pity... the Song Court will definitely requisition this place. This great formation probably won't fall into my hands...'

But he wouldn't take the man at his word. He stretched out a hand, and nimble black flames danced around his fingertips, as if whispering.

'Attacking the mountain, breaking the gate... nourishing the Dharma Body. But it feels like there was some interference...'

Drawing on his experience at Changxiao Gate, Li Zhouwei knew this couldn't be interference from a mere Purple Mansion Realm formation. His spiritual sense sank, connecting with the Immortal Mirror. In an instant, a complete image of the entire mountain range flooded his mind!

Spirit Probe!

An endless landscape of scenes surged into his mind as every hidden cache was revealed. As expected, the place was picked clean. Of all the spiritual resources stored away, not a single one was noteworthy.

But he searched everywhere, still unwilling to give up. While he appeared to be studying the patterns on the formation disk, he was secretly probing one immortal's cave after another. Finally, he saw the deepest, most extravagant cave—bright with white-gold, a river of purple water flowing through. It was Yehui's personal cultivation abode.

Though lavishly decorated, this place, too, had been emptied of valuables. Only a bottomless purple spring bubbled in the center, gushing with color. Under the Immortal Mirror's unhindered inspection, every detail was visible.

Deep beneath it, drawn by a talisman, was a green jade object!

'Cleverly hidden.'

Yehui hadn't hidden it that deep, just slightly beyond the range of a normal Purple Mansion Realm probe. He didn't know if it was a natural feature or a skill of the Capital Guard lineage, but the cavern containing the object was a fault in the Great Void. It was impossible to get a foothold, which cut off most methods of detection and scrying.

It was being constrained by a talismanic divine ability, but the object was still faintly sensing.

'You audacious bastard, Yehui... you were using the destruction of your own sect to refine a treasure! No wonder!'

The corner of Li Zhouwei's mouth hooked up. He glanced at the kneeling Gongsun Bofan, which made the other Guest Retainers on the side tremble. They scrambled over, fawning.

"My lord! There are one or two minor sect treasuries, hidden around the mountain... The disciples in the sect often take from them..."

Gongsun Bofan was appalled by their stupidity and coldly snapped,

"The petty stores of junior cultivators? What use are they?"

The Guest Retainer instantly fell silent. Li Zhouwei looked up just as Situ Huo stepped into the hall, smiling.

"Congratulations, King Wei..."

Li Zhouwei was somewhat disappointed. Capital immortals Dao was destitute, and now he had to garrison the mountain. The spirit mountain and veins left behind were immovable. It was tasteless to eat, yet a pity to discard. He listened as Situ Huo continued,

"This Capital immortals manpower... King Wei has no use for them, I presume?"

Li Zhouwei understood immediately. Situ Huo's personal strength was exceptional, but he was severely lacking in subordinates. The few Situ clan remnants had low cultivations and were useless for now. The very thing Li Zhouwei cared for least was what Situ Huo urgently needed.

Li Zhouwei said,

"I'll take this one. You can have the rest."

The old man smiled and shook his head, looking slightly disappointed.

"King Wei certainly knows how to pick!"

Li Zhouwei had dealt with Gongsun Bofan before and had a good impression of him. The man was a peak Foundation Establishment Realm saber cultivator. While not some world-beating genius, he was more than adequate. Nurturing a saber cultivator of this level on the lake would cost a significant amount of resources.

Manpower on the lake was already scarce. This was a rogue cultivator who understood reason, possessed a sense of honor, and had a known background. Li Zhouwei gave him a measure of approval. That was why he had specifically saved his life.

Gongsun Bofan had assumed that for opposing the Li family, he would be fated to die a horrible death. He never imagined he would hear such words. He froze for a second, then kowtowed, his voice thick with emotion.

"This one greets Your Majesty!"

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod of acknowledgment but said no more.

"Take me to Yehui's immortal's cave."




# Chapter 1109: The Outer Extreme

The purple water chimed softly.

Inside the great hall, purple light swirled in profound unity, casting myriad colors. Gongsun Bofan stood terrified outside the cave residence, not daring to lift his head. In all these years, he had never even approached the front door, let alone entered Yehui's abode.

The golden-eyed youth, however, paced casually. He swept his gaze around, coming to a stop beside a small purple pond, its surface as smooth as a mirror.

This was Deep Purple Spirit Water, a spiritual resource of the Capital Guard Dao. Low-level cultivators often mistook it for Purple Qi or Water Mansion. While precious, it wasn't particularly rare.

As the Daoist Master watched, the pond water rapidly boiled. Dark springs surged from deep underground, only to be vaporized into sheets of purple spiritual mist. Li Zhouwei stepped forward once more and gave a light stomp.

"Crack!"

It sounded as if something deep within the earth had collapsed. All the purple water instantly vanished, sinking away. A single point of green light leaped up, breaking through the air and riding the wind in an attempt to flee, but it was constrained by the Heavenly Light and forced to fall into the Daoist Master's hand.

The first thing that caught Li Zhouwei's eye was the talisman sealing it. It was a sheet of brilliant purple-gold, its runes flowing like liquid gold. Four large characters had been written upon it with a vermilion brush: "Capital immortals Great Dao."

He casually peeled the talisman off. It was as flexible as paper, draping limply over his hand. The light dissipated, revealing the object's true form.

The item was about the size of a palm, made of a strange, delightfully deep green material. Its edges were irregular yet possessed an unconventional beauty. It felt like a token in his grasp. Five profound runes adorned its surface: one golden dot in the center, with four round, silver-purple dots at its periphery.

The back was flat, inscribed with four golden characters: Sun-Honoring Grand View.

'It's... some kind of storage treasure.'

The item's material was exceptionally special, capable of storing spiritual objects. It seemed some refining method had even been used to transform it into a spirit embryo. If he hadn't torn off the talisman, the karmic ripples and fate stirred by the sect's destruction outside would have continued to empower it.

His spiritual sense swept over it, and he paused, slightly startled. The space within was a field of light green, rippling water. It was crystal clear, with all manner of multicolored light shimmering within. It was clearly some kind of spiritual water, and submerged within it lay a single white jade slip.

Of all things, it was a pool of Wall-Sinking Water.

Li Zhouwei's expression became intriguing. He did not retrieve the slip, but instead cryptically put the green token away. He paced down from the dais and led Gongsun Bofan out of the hall.

The golden-eyed youth, dressed in white and purple robes and wearing a cloak of black cloud-silk, was already waiting outside. Seeing Li Zhouwei emerge, he quickly bowed and reported,

"Father, General Yang requests an audience!"

Li Zhouwei wasn't surprised. He nodded and stepped forward. Father and son stepped into the Great Void, drifting onward. Li Jianglong waited a moment before speaking in a low voice,

"Thank you, Father... for displaying such divine might. Your son and my two younger brothers... we are all endlessly grateful and overjoyed."

The Capital immortals were conquered. Jiangxia had been dispatched to sweep up the remaining forces in the territory, while Jiangliang was taking two Merciful Ones back to the capital. Only he had been ordered to receive Li Zhouwei. The matter he referred to was, of course, Vast Cicada.

He kept his gaze lowered. Li Zhouwei, his expression neutral, neither smiling nor angry, simply nodded.

"The Buddhist cultivators are full of schemes and are plotting against you. You must remain cautious."

Li Jianglong quickly swallowed the words he had been about to say and nodded obediently.

But the White Ye Immortal Sect was very close to the Wilderness. Just as he finished hearing that sentence, Li Jianglong realized they had already descended from the Great Void. He saw a great hall, glittering with an ominous light. The black-robed imperial descendant of the Yang clan was standing at the very entrance, personally waiting to greet them.

"Congratulations, King Wei."

"The same to you, Great General!"

Li Jianglong could only halt his steps once more, watching his father stride into the hall and disappear into the gloomy, bronze-fiend palace.

Yang Ruiyi's complexion was ruddy, and he looked extremely pleased. He warmly led Li Zhouwei forward. The King Wei of Great Song swept his gaze across the room and saw his uncle, Li Ximing, standing to one side with a smile. The tea on the nearby table was half-drunk; they had clearly been talking for some time.

Yang Ruiyi said,

"King Wei, that single strike of your battle-axe echoed from north to south. Its might shook Jianghuai. It was truly... unexpected!"

Li Ximing's eyebrows twitched. He caught the hidden meaning.

'For Yang Ruiyi to use the word "unexpected," it seems the Underworld was also unprepared! So... even the great figures in the heavens can be caught by surprise!'

His mood brightened instantly. He listened to Yang Ruiyi's lavish praise, and Li Zhouwei had only politely demurred twice before Yang Ruiyi smiled and continued,

"King Wei, your great accomplishment has already been reported to the Emperor. The Emperor is greatly pleased! In front of all the court officials, he personally lauded you, calling it an unprecedented achievement since the founding of the dynasty, the foremost merit in slaying an enemy general!"

"In a few days, an order should arrive summoning you to the capital for an imperial audience and to receive a generous bestowal of immortal items!"

At these words, both Daoist Masters of the Li family looked surprised. Li Ximing's expression shifted, revealing a trace of hesitation. The smile on Yang Ruiyi's face also wavered, and he watched Li Zhouwei's expression with hidden concern.

Li Zhouwei, however, smiled.

"The imperial grace is paramount. This king shall return to the lake, remove his armor, and purify himself with incense to prepare for the audience with His Majesty."

Hearing this, Yang Ruiyi seemed to let out a silent breath of relief, even showing a hint of gratitude. His voice softened considerably, and he dispensed with the pleasantries, saying hurriedly,

"Excellent... excellent. I will not disturb you further, King Wei..."

He watched the two Li family members bow and retreat. Yang Ruiyi let out a full breath, walked quickly back to the main seat, and irritably pushed his teacup away.

'The Emperor... what exactly is he thinking...?'

If the Vast Cicada affair was an accident, summoning Li Zhouwei was an accident beyond accidents. From Yang Ruiyi's perspective, at his level, the Yang clan had never intended for the Emperor and the King to meet.

Not because such a meeting was taboo... but because it was completely unnecessary!

'Those two are the greatest variables. One represents Bright Yang, the other True Qi. They are already impossibly difficult to control, and now they're meant to collide?'

'Every action they take is symbolic. If the Song Emperor makes an unexpected move, trying to suppress King Wei, wouldn't he be offending him for no reason? And that's the _good_ outcome. What if... what if by some million-to-one chance, the Emperor is instead outmaneuvered by the King? How humiliating would that be for the Underworld!'

But Yang Zhuo was not Emperor Zhao. When he gave a direct order for a summons, who would dare refuse?

This only deepened his anxiety, leaving him torn between joy and worry.

'And that's not even mentioning the Vast Cicada affair...'

The joy, of course, was that the north would be unable to stir up trouble for some time. He had wanted to break the stalemate, but he had never imagined Li Zhouwei would just cleave the man to death with a single blow!

Li Zhouwei slaying Vast Cicada was a majestic display, allowing the light of Martial Cultivation to shine brightly. The matter was a mixed blessing. The Song Emperor was overjoyed, but what about the Underworld? The powers in the Underworld despised anything that altered the status quo!

'Anyone managing the grand situation despises variables, even beneficial ones. One variable leads to a second. Who knows what will change next? Better to have no change at all!'

Of course, a man like Li Zhouwei was a variable in himself. The higher his cultivation, the more likely he was to upset the balance. But this all felt... premature.

He mused for a while longer before forcing the thoughts down, consoling himself.

'Fortunately, this isn't my problem to manage. At least, from the perspective of Yang Ruiyi, this is unequivocally a good thing.'

'What's more, the Emperor and King must meet eventually. Meeting now, before Li Zhouwei has surpassed the Purple Mystery, is for the best. If they were to wait until both were at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, their divine ability complete... I fear the great lords themselves would have to descend personally to oversee it!'

The thought of that scene sent a shiver down his spine. He sighed deeply. This position truly felt like sitting on the edge of a blade. It was agonizing.

...

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Beams of Bright Yang light descended. Li Ximing straightened his robes and smiled.

"It seems the Underworld miscalculated."

Li Zhouwei took a step, hands clasped behind his back, and sat at the jade table. He poured the teapot full of clear tea and said,

"It's only the beginning."

"Besides..." He took a sip of tea. "I wouldn't call it a miscalculation. The only one who truly lost was the master of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. The Underworld was fanning the flames. Today's events, as well as Sparrow Carp Fish heading south to take a guest position in the lands of True Qi... that could not have happened without permission from a great figure in the Underworld."

Li Ximing fell into thought. Li Zhouwei, however, laughed. His face was naturally stern, and the rare expression swept away his usual ferocity.

"But this is also a good thing. A Dharma Master is still a figure on the level of a True Monarch. Regardless of whether he borrowed power from another faction, his defeat is real."

"This is a good omen." He paused, his expression growing bold. "If a Dharma Master can miscalculate, so can a True Monarch. For centuries, They have done nothing but exchange favors and conspire. What if the position I hold, the Golden Position I seek, is one that cannot be exchanged or conspired for? How would they break that stalemate? The figures high above are not omnipotent. That alone is enough."

Li Zhouwei's smile deepened.

"Uncle, why do you think the Song Emperor is so happy? Because I killed Vast Cicada? No!"

The words were like a sudden awakening. Li Ximing's heart filled with shock and terror.

He murmured, "So that's how it is!"

He pondered for a long time, still struggling to grasp Li Zhouwei's thoughts.

"The Song Emperor... if he just follows the proscribed path, he is guaranteed a position unattainable by anyone else in the world. Why would he do this?"

Li Zhouwei refilled his tea.

"He holds the Tianwu. How could he be willing to remain beneath others? As for the Underworld's schemes... if Granduncle could figure them out so easily, they wouldn't be the ones residing in the Underworld, observing the mortal realm."

Li Ximing nodded, then said hesitantly, "As for... the imperial audience."

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Let him have his way. A momentary whim is harmless. The light and dark know their own. In the century-long struggle, it is not yet known who will become the Imperial Monarch."

His golden eyes were brilliant, the deep gold within them churning. Li Ximing was left speechless for a long moment before he let out a heavy sigh.

"Good!"

With the matter settled, Li Zhouwei hadn't even spoken again before Li Ximing was beaming. He hurriedly pulled a pile of items from his sleeve, first lifting a glittering golden pagoda.

"We've struck it rich!"

"I just made a trip to the Wilderness and specifically asked around. This pagoda of Vast Cicada's was forged from Radiant Sky Stone blended with the Chongming Golden Essence of Li Fire. It looks like a Buddhist cultivator's tool, but its true value is extraordinary!"

He quickly set it down and held up the long spear.

"And this Li Fire spear is just as impressive. The shaft used half a portion of Heavenly Li Crimson Gold, and the spearhead contains a sliver of Tianyang Radiant Copper. It's a minuscule amount, but it's there!"

Li Ximing said solemnly, "Back then, the Li Fire Spear used by the Imperial Monarch's reincarnation was forged from Tianyang Radiant Copper! This material is comparable to the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness."

Li Zhouwei merely watched with a smile.

"His equipment was better than mine."

The smile on Li Ximing's face widened.

"Yang Ruiyi also mentioned that Vast Cicada was a very strange man. The foundations of these items were never fully converted to the Buddhist way. He only built a framework, then used his own Immortal Dao Dao-Profundity to harmonize them with Buddhist cultivator techniques. If we spend some time breaking down the golden pagoda, we can recover eighty to ninety percent of the raw materials!"

"This spear's materials have already achieved profound unity. Smashing it won't help. It will take a good while to re-refine it properly."

Li Zhouwei was taken aback.

"That monk... why go through such convoluted trouble?"

Li Ximing sneered.

"Yang Ruiyi saw through him at a glance. He said the man was still thinking of returning to the demonic path, so of course he prepared an escape route!"

Li Zhouwei grew pensive. The glazed Valley Water lotus throne had shrunk to the size of his palm, and Li Ximing held it up.

"This is also a good item. It was modified from a Valley Water spiritual object. It's a pity the modifications run too deep. It was likely a gift from another Buddhist cultivator. The materials have already reached profound unity. Unless we find a true saint of artifact refinement, it will be nearly impossible to revert it."

Finally, he took out the kasaya and the white-skinned, gold-edged profound drum.

"These two are a slight step down, and you damaged them besides. Still, even among Buddhist cultivators, they'd be considered fine treasures!"

Li Zhouwei glanced over them and smiled.

"This shouldn't be difficult. The old Daoist Master of Mount Qusi is a grandmaster of artifact refinement. I'll have to trouble you, Uncle, to make a trip to Mount Qusi and discuss it. A solution will present itself."

Li Ximing nodded.

"My thoughts exactly. And it's not just the old Daoist Master. Daoist Master Liaoluo is also highly skilled in this path. If we cannot disturb the old master, we can seek him out instead."

Li Zhouwei's smile faded. He took a jade box from his sleeve, placed it on the table, and said,

"Uncle has shared his harvest. Coincidentally, this junior's own gains were not small."

He then recounted his trip to Mount Dali. As he spoke, Li Ximing looked as if he wanted to interrupt several times, and the smile slowly faded from his face.

After a long silence, Li Ximing finally said,

"Senior Liu may have allied with us for his own benefit, but who doesn't? We have generations of friendship and he has offered his help many times, not to mention his current duty guarding the Eastern Sea. None of that can be erased. He showed his true feelings; it did not seem faked."

"This junior understands."

Li Zhouwei gave him a moment before pushing the jade box forward.

"As for this... Qingyu Qian called it Final-Tower Sinking Primal, also known as Outer-Extreme Yin Qi."

"Final-Tower Sinking Primal?"

Li Ximing looked closer as Li Zhouwei continued, his expression complex.

"The Supreme Yin Moon Radiance is the pinnacle of yin. This item... is the yin _beyond_ that pinnacle. It is found in the place where the Supreme Yin falls and goes into seclusion. It is a thing of absolute yin. Because it is a manifestation of sinking, killing, ultimate yin, it cannot be absorbed. To swallow this qi means instant, violent death."

Li Ximing silently mulled over this. Li Zhouwei continued,

"However, if this item encounters both yin and yang qi, it manifests a symbol of the 'yin-extreme seeking change,' and transforms into another path entirely. Its applications in alchemy and artifact refinement are immense. In Qingyu Qian's words: 'Ancient cultivators would flock to it. To obtain even a sliver, one would spend a lifetime devising a formula for it, seeking to have their name passed down to be revered by all posterity!'"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up.

"What do you mean, 'transforms into another path'?"

Li Zhouwei still looked awed as he replied, "Qingyu Qian gave me the most famous example. There was once an ancient True Monarch known as Left Wall. Before attaining the Dao, he studied the Supreme Yin Dao Lineage, but he lacked the requisite divine ability. He retreated to pursue the Veiled Yin instead, but lacked a suitable weapon. As luck would have it, he obtained a portion of Final-Tower Sinking Primal."

"He sought out the era's most renowned grandmaster of artifact refinement, Sikong You. The moment that man saw the Final-Tower Sinking Primal, he knew his chance to be remembered for a hundred generations had come. He martyred himself for his craft and, for the True Monarch, he forged the Second-Aspect Great Bow Star."

"This artifact was said to be neither extreme nor veiled, neither full nor deficient. It existed in the space between Supreme Yin and Veiled Yin, yet could harness the aspects of both. Its unpredictable transformations stunned the world. Daoist Master Left Wall used it to ascend to the Veiled Yin position and achieve the rank of True Monarch!"

Li Ximing listened, gradually sinking into thought. Li Zhouwei sighed.

"It's said the Golden Position this True Monarch attained was exceptionally strange. He clearly ascended to the 'Veiled Yin' position, yet his place in the heavens was not far from the 'Supreme Yin' celestial domain. To repay Sikong You, He hung the Second-Aspect Great Bow Star in the sky as a small, trailing star, a testament for all the world to see."

"Ever since, the Second-Aspect Great Bow Star has been one of the stars worshipped by artisans. They often use it to divine the creation of their life's masterwork. Its importance cannot be overstated."

Li Ximing was silent for a long time, pondering the implications. At last, he said,

"I understand! It's such an incredible treasure! To use it properly... the requirements for one's craft, and even one's Dao-Profundity, must be astronomically high."

His expression was complicated as he eyed the small jade bottle in the box. 'Such a supreme treasure... and there are still four more bottles of it in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance!'

They exchanged a look, both realizing the terrifying implication.

'With just one portion of this, one has a chance to strike for a Golden Position. How much immortal merit would that be worth?!'

'That great figure, the one suspected to be Li Jiangqun... had five full bottles. This is just the half-box that was left. Where did the other half he used go?'

They fell silent, simultaneously pushing the topic from their minds. They didn't even dare place the item in a storage bag, instead stowing it away carefully, preparing to send it back to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Only then did Li Zhouwei take out his second prize from the mountain, a brilliant golden, exceedingly heavy spiritual scroll, the Great Void Primal-Order Profound-Office Construction Method!

The scroll was immensely long, densely packed with golden characters. A single rune, when touched by spiritual sense, would blossom into ten thousand words of profound text. Li Ximing, a dignified master of the Purple Mansion Realm, found it dizzying to behold. He had to augment his senses with his Life Divine Ability just to read it clearly.

Li Zhouwei sighed.

"I've read the general outline. It is precious beyond measure. Accepting that Pure Qi spiritual object from Si Boxiu was the right move. This can solve a great trouble for us, but it only addresses one or two-tenths of the core problem."

Li Ximing solemnly put it away

"I know how precious this is. Just gathering the spiritual resources will take an unknown amount of time. This matter must wait for Que'Wan to emerge from her seclusion so we can discuss it together."

Their family's resources were considerable, but there was still a vast gap between them and the ability to construct a mystic realm in the Great Void. With two juniors on the verge of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, another massive expense was looming. Li Zhouwei didn't press the matter. Instead, he took the green jade token from the Capital immortals Dao from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing with a smile.

"Uncle, look at this. I found it in the Capital immortals Dao. It was hidden deep in the earth veins, being refined by the chaotic fortune stirred up by the sect's destruction."

They were in a secure location. Li Ximing flipped his hand, retrieving the jade slip from within the token. One glance at it made him start in surprise.

"Cloud Capital Dao-Entry Secret Manual? This is..."

Li Zhouwei shook his head, smiling.

"Read it carefully, Uncle."

Li Ximing spent some time reading it through. He was silent for a long while.

"It seems to be... a secret method for entering a grotto-heaven... but it's only half of it. It also relies on some 'profound token.' It's far too complex. This half-fragment is useless to us."

This made Li Zhouwei laugh.

"Yehui... he actually enjoys these little tricks. It seems he understands the current situation quite well... and has many of his own plans."

Li Ximing fell silent again, studying the token.

"What... what does this mean?"

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Yehui's Dao-Profundity is high and his scheming is deep. Why would he risk leaving something behind in the mountain? And why would this item just so happen to be discoverable by my Dharma Body? I was suspicious from the start. But when I saw that pool of Wall-Sinking Water inside, I understood. This man... he left this for me, specifically. What was the 'catch'? The Wall-Sinking Water itself. It's a hint, and a demonstration of his foresight."

"He knew I would conquer the Capital immortals Sect! And he knew our family is desperately in need of Wall-Sinking Water!"

Li Ximing was quiet for a beat.

"This half of the Cloud Capital Dao-Entry Secret Manual... is his gesture of sincerity?"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"Uncle, do you remember how he first rose to prominence?"

Li Ximing's eyes widened in realization.

"Encompassing Profoundity Mountain—Chuyi Heaven! This token in my hand... this is the 'profound token'?"

But his expression quickly clouded with doubt again.

"But... for Yehui to offer such a temptation... he must want something in return. What could our family possibly have that he would value so highly?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head, smiling.

"Our family has nothing he covets. But the grand alignment of North and South... that offers plenty to covet. Situ Huo is thinking of defecting to their side, so why wouldn't someone from their side think of defecting to ours? This man is proud. He would never submit to the Buddhists. Yet the Buddhist cultivators covet his power. How can he possibly rely on them?"

"The northern Seven Aspects have numerous Dharma Masters, and they already occupy the foundation of the Capital Guard's path: Radiant Qi. They would never let him covet the Capital Guard's authority. The Capital Guard path, with its Dushan Spirit-Summoning, often deals with ghosts and spirits. Wouldn't defecting to the Underworld be a perfect fit?"

Li Ximing was instantly, completely enlightened.

"So that's it... that's it! The sheer audacity of the man!"

The Daoist Master was still incredulous.

"I heard... I heard Wei Xuanyin treated him exceptionally well, entrusting him with great authority. And he... he just ignored all that friendship and plotted to betray him from the very beginning!"

"Friendship? How can that weigh more than a Golden Position?"

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"He wants to curry favor with the Underworld, not True Qi. To do that, he needed to force a major change in the situation. He's been planning this since the day he first joined the North. I always wondered... if he was going to join the North, why did he come save you, Uncle? Why did he come to our gates and say all that? His talk of 'mutual aid' was nonsense. He was signaling his ambition... signaling that he would _not_ submit to the Buddhists. It was all laying the groundwork for today."

"Yang Ruiyi is a defender, not an attacker; he won't lead the offensive for long. Situ Huo is unreliable and might sell him out. Only our family was on his radar early on. He knew we would inevitably end up on the southern side. Making this play in advance... it was the most secure move."

"Furthermore, we are a clan. We provide for our juniors. This grotto-heaven is perfect for elevating the next generation, and it even comes with the Wuguan Legacy. He knew we wouldn't be able to resist."

Li Zhouwei's eyes shone like stars.

"Of course, there is one more thing. He doesn't know if his defection is part of the calculations of the great powers on either side. Is Yang Ruiyi reliable? Is he willing to accept such a variable? But _I_ am a certainty. This King Wei will never pass up a chance to shatter the North, and I absolutely welcome variables."

"But you were right about one thing, Uncle." A note of admiration entered the voice of Great Song's King Wei. "This man's audacity, his ambition... they are truly rare in this era."




# Chapter 1110: The Demon Body

A light snow, as fine as catkin fluff, drifted through the cold spring air. Below, the earth was a hazy expanse of yellow and white. A man in white, feathered robes sped onward with the wind, watching settlements of all sizes pass beneath his feet across the flat plains.

This land lay north of the Prefectures governed by the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. Beyond an ancient city wall rose a magnificent citadel. Its myriad palaces were all built in hues of yellow and white, and banners of two colors—representing Profound Yellow Qi—fluttered from every corner.

Its name was Shengle.

The city's history was ancient. It was originally the territory of the Touba Xianbei. Their ancestor, Touba Xige Yi, first settled this land. Only after Touba Changming received the surname 'Yuan' and was granted rewards by the Wei state did this city truly rise, remaining a towering presence to this day.

Touba Ci had ridden the wind to this spot, the very edge of the traditional Xia frontiers. This land was not ruled by the Great Zhao, but was instead the domain of his Touba clan: the State of Dai. Shengle still served as its capital.

He descended into a great hall adorned with the Profound Yellow Qi banners. A cultivator immediately came forward to pay respects. Touba Ci, his face a mask of impatience, asked,

"How much longer until we can enter?"

The cultivator, whose cultivation was clearly not low, was nonetheless deferential. He bowed quickly.

"The grotto-heaven's Profound Foundation has only shifted six-tenths of the way and is just now aligning with the Gloom position. It will be some time yet..."

Touba Ci let out a breath, his expression remaining dark.

The death of Vast Cicada had little impact on Touba Ci. The reason he had rushed all the way from Jianghuai to Mobei was something else entirely:

The Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body.

Li Zhouwei's Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body wasn't particularly strong, and it didn't look as though it had been nourished with much blood-food. While the Dao lineage of Profound Qi was now only prominent within the Touba clan, it had been widespread in ancient times. If Li Zhouwei had truly stumbled upon the technique in some forgotten corner, it wouldn't have been _that_ surprising.

But Touba Ci could never mistake the familiar aura radiating from that Dharma Body. He knew with chilling certainty—Li Zhouwei was cultivating _their_ family's specific version.

This was a terrifying prospect. After his initial shock, Touba Ci had immediately feigned nonchalance, his heart sinking. He had lost all interest in the remainder of the battle, his mind consumed by suspicion.

The Touba clan's inheritance was sealed within their grotto-heaven, Shengle Heaven, which had been isolated from the world for years. The rare instances when it was opened to receive someone were conducted with extreme secrecy, aided by an ancestral Dharma Treasure that prevented all communication with the outside world. The techniques for these Dharma Body divine abilities were hidden _within_ that Dharma Treasure. It was impossible for them to have been stolen!

He fell silent for a moment before asking,

"Has my father returned?"

The cultivator nodded repeatedly.

"Yes... Lord Wei has arrived."

Touba Ci had only asked in passing. This was an unexpected development. Somewhat surprised, he quickly straightened his robes, strode forward, and pushed open the doors to the main hall. Sure enough, two men were seated at the head of the room.

The one on the left wore white and had an extraordinary air. The one on the right, dressed in black, looked solemn. A chessboard lay between them, black and white pieces locked in a fierce battle.

Touba Ci laughed heartily and strode inside.

"Lord Wei! What a fine day for a leisurely game!"

Wei Xuanyin glanced at him. Before he could speak, the man in black shot Touba Ci a look and chuckled.

"You brat... I trust you've learned there's always someone stronger out there?"

Touba Ci immediately played along. Whatever gloom he felt was masked by an air of easygoing acceptance.

"It was incredible! Absolutely incredible! That White Qilin cleaved Vast Cicada in two with a single strike!"

The father and son put on their little show, but Wei Xuanyin didn't seem annoyed. He simply shook his head with a faint smile.

"It has been many years, Daoist Friend Qiye. You are now a man who has stepped across the threshold of Purple Mystery. Why resort to such theatrics? It seems my time overseeing Profound Governance has made us grow distant."

Wei Xuanyin's words made the man—Touba Qiye—laugh as well. As the biological brother of the current King of Dai, his status was immense, and with his divine abilities having advanced, he no longer felt he had to fear Wei Xuanyin.

"And Lord Wei isn't heartbroken? The Tao family... they're just going to let this go?"

Wei Xuanyin, pinching a white stone, replied,

"I warned him three times. The Tao family was present for the first two. The last time, he still insisted on returning to Jiangbei, so I let him be. I thought I might have a fourth chance, but it seems I've waited too long. As for being heartbroken... I am not the one who should be."

He continued, "The Tao family still felt some connection to him. They might cause trouble for Lanyan. But you expect them to seek vengeance for a disciple who abandoned them to join the Buddhists? The Tao clan has held itself to a righteous standard for too long. They won't do such a thing."

Touba Qiye understood.

"Does this mean the matter is dropped? Surely the Great Adoration Dharma Realm will at least make a sound?"

Wei Xuanyin placed a piece.

"Fachang has been sent out again... The meaning is clear. The Great Adoration Dharma Realm has no immediate solution. The situation in Jianghuai... they and Mount Dayang have also begun to pull back, waiting for an opportunity. In any case, the business with the Way of Great Desire is wrapping up."

Touba Qiye shook his head and sighed. Wei Xuanyin looked past him, his gaze settling on Touba Ci.

"I came this time because I have a question for you, Daoist Friend."

Touba Ci stiffened. Suddenly, the Great Daoist Master's features sharpened, his calm, watery eyes staring straight through him.

"You fought him personally. The demon body on King Wei... does it belong to your noble clan's Dao lineage?"

The question struck like a boulder thrown into a placid lake, sending a chill through Touba Ci. The words were too sharp, and for a moment, he dared not speak.

Only after the man in black—his father—gave a slight nod did Touba Ci answer, his voice tight with reluctance.

"Reporting to you, my lord. It is... the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body!"

He had been intentionally vague, but Wei Xuanyin's expression, while not fierce, held an unyielding, tranquil authority.

"I am curious. How did your clan's highest Dao lineage fall into his hands?"

Touba Ci's eyes narrowed.

"My lord, you are not the only one who wishes to investigate! Otherwise, this Daoist Master would not have rushed back from Jianghuai to the Northern Lands!"

Touba Qiye, seeing Wei Xuanyin's expression darken, sensed where this was going. He quickly interjected in a low voice,

"The Touba clan's Dark-Soul Mara is not of the same origin as the current Great Pass Azure-Soul. The Lesser Yang Demon Monarch himself cultivated the Great Pass Azure-Soul Dharma Body."

"While the 'Dark Flame Mara' Dharma Body is one of our clan's fundamental arts, it was an accidental acquisition by the Martial Emperor before he achieved the Dao... Other versions have spread throughout the world. How can you be so certain our Touba clan secretly gifted him _our_ method?"

"Certain?" Wei Xuanyin laughed coldly. "I know that version circulated. But after the Martial Emperor attained the Dao, did he not refine the art and establish a new inheritance? Your family's lineage is _different_ from that ancient Mara Dharma Body. The one he possesses is _your_ version. Why play these games with me?"

The two men froze, stunned that their secret techniques were known so clearly. The Great Daoist Master from the Profound Governance Pavilion stood up, pacing with his hands behind his back. His gaze turned icy.

"You two had best think clearly before you answer. This inquiry does not come from Profound Governance."

He stated quietly, "Xuanlou is here on orders."

It was rare for Wei Xuanyin to use the name Xuanlou.

In that instant, the color drained from Touba Qiye's face. A Great Daoist Master, a man of immense divine abilities among the world's pre-eminent cultivators, was visibly flustered. He took a step back, bowing his head.

"Qiye... I... I have only just learned of this," he pleaded. "I beg the Upper Emissary to be lenient... grant us some time..."

Touba Ci's reaction was just as swift. All pretense vanished, replaced by pure panic. He dropped to his knees simultaneously, pressing his forehead to the floor without a word.

A single name. In one breath, the dignity of Touba Qiye, of Touba Ci, of the entire Touba clan—descendants of the Liang, heirs of a True Monarch—was shattered, leaving not a shred behind.

Wei Xuanyin was not surprised. From his elevated position, he looked down.

"Since you've had time to think, speak."

Touba Qiye, after a moment's hesitation, gritted his teeth.

"Reporting to the Upper Emissary... this subordinate truly does not know. But why would my family help Bright Yang? Even if we wished to, why would we give him our fundamental art and let him parade it around? What benefit is that to the Touba? We must have been framed!"

His expression shifted.

"I fear the inheritance was stolen... But even so, even if he learned one or two levels of the Dharma Body, surely it isn't... _this_ serious?"

Wei Xuanyin knew that Touba Qiye, a Great Daoist Master, would not be truly convinced unless the full stakes were laid bare. He'd just think this was an overreaction.

"Not serious?" Wei Xuanyin said softly. "Profound Qi is the Ancient Demonic Dao. It is the _only_ Great Dao that stands equal to the paths of the Immortals and the Buddhists. You dare let such a thing fall into King Wei's hands? Lord Yao is already losing sleep over the possibility of him joining the Buddhists. Now we must worry about him joining the Demons?"

"We have heard King Wei may be cultivating the _fundamental_ art. Lord Yao was on the verge of coming out of seclusion himself over this!" Wei Xuanyin raised his eyebrows, his tone frigid.

"If I had not personally volunteered for this task, the one standing here now would be Yao Guanyi. And given his attitude toward your clan, Daoist Friend Qiye, you wouldn't be explaining anything at all."

The great hall fell silent. Touba Qiye kept his head bowed. After a long pause, Touba Ci stepped forward.

"The Dark-Soul Mara has three transformations. He has only shown the first, and it is still weak. Unless it is cultivated to its absolute peak, it cannot connect to the Great Dao of Profound Qi. It's... possible that during the Liang chaos a thousand years ago, a heart-method or two leaked out. But the remaining two transformations are locked within the imprint. They cannot be obtained without personal, physical contact. I ask the Upper Emissary to see the truth of this."

This was an explanation, but it was also a concession, a tacit acceptance of responsibility. Hearing it, Wei Xuanyin's expression softened fractionally. He waved a hand.

"It is precisely because I know these details that I volunteered, to give you a chance."

He paused.

"But telling _me_ isn't enough. I'm afraid, Daoist Friend, you will have to return with me to Profound Governance."

"Many thanks, Upper Emissary," Touba Qiye, silent for so long, finally spoke. He rose, shot Touba Ci a deep, meaningful glance, and then made a 'please' gesture for Wei Xuanyin to lead the way.

Just like that, they departed, one following the other, without time for another word.

Touba Ci remained, standing alone in the hall, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles were white. His expression turned frigid.

'Who was it!'

His words had been a strategic ambiguity, a way to give both sides an exit. But the Touba family rules were ironclad. The clan's Dharma Treasure, the magical imprint, was still secure. Anyone who had ever received the art from the imprint was magically bound; they _could not_ write it down or transmit it to another. Not even the first transformation!

'The only way... is soul-searching. But the imprint is a Dharma Treasure... Who has that kind of power? A True Monarch? Would they even need to? One word from them could destroy my entire clan!'

A cold fear washed over him. He sat heavily in the main seat, staring blankly at the half-finished chess game.

'Could it be... they're just trying to scare us?'

But it had already happened. He had to consider the consequences.

'We've already handed over two Dharma Treasures. Wasn't that enough? Are they using this as an excuse to seize our clan's ancestral treasure imprint?'

The darkness in his eyes deepened. He stared south, toward the distant horizon, until a streak of Heavenly Glow, flashing past like a bird, seared his vision. Touba Ci lowered his head, eyes shut tight.

'Yao Guanyi…'

...

"Tenth year of the calendar, spring. The Touba clan entered Huai. King Wei led a strike against them. The Zhao general, Vast Cicada, launched a failed ambush. The armies clashed at Baixiang. A great victory. The heavens ran red, mountains fell. Vast Cicada died."

"At that time, the State of Song bordered the Heluo region."

The black ink lay starkly on the bamboo slip. The young man stared at the desk, utterly dumbfounded. A long moment passed before he finally murmured,

"Vast Cicada... died?"

_Huh?_

Vast Cicada was just... dead? Li Suining was speechless.

'What... What is this? Is this because of me?'

'I gave a single warning, and a dignified Fifth-Generation Maha was slain by His Majesty?!'

Who was Vast Cicada? He was the Great Adoration Dharma Realm's primary agent in Jiangbei. According to the history of his previous life, Vast Cicada should have only just been making his first major moves around this time. He was supposed to break through to the Sixth Generation and spend years countering the Way of Great Desire and the Dao of Compassion...

It wasn't that the man was immortal. In the original timeline, he was _still_ slain by King Wei, at a place called White Horse Mountain.

'I remember hearing that when he died, a great sun appeared in the sky and the Buddhist Land itself faltered. The Great Adoration Dharma Realm didn't even seem that sad, claiming he had gone to reincarnate and that his Dao was complete.'

In the end, he died, just with more fanfare.

But his dying _this_ early changed everything. Who could possibly replace him in Jianghuai? Could the Great Adoration Dharma Realm just find a second Li Jieyi?

Li Suining paced twice around his cave-residence, staring at the map again. A strange look crossed his face.

"Although... the overall situation hasn't changed much... the battle lines are almost identical to how they were before."

He was lost in thought when the door to his residence shimmered. A man in an ink-black robe strode inside. He glanced at the map on the desk and smiled.

"Did the news frighten you?"

Even though Li Zhouwei's tone was familiar, Li Suining's first instinct was still one of reverence. He hurried down from his platform.

"This subordinate greets Your Majesty!"

He bowed deeply before rising. Li Zhouwei waved him up. Li Suining replied,

"Vast Cicada's death... it's just, it's very early!"

"This King knows." Li Zhouwei smiled, clasping his hands behind his back. "This was a miscalculation on the part of the Dharma Masters. It is precisely because _your_ premonition was correct that his death feels early to you."

A thoughtful light flickered in his eyes.

"This isn't a bad thing, and it was unavoidable. But I came today because there is something I must ask you."

Li Suining raised an eyebrow. Li Zhouwei nodded.

"Do you know of the Heavenly Element?"

Li Suining frowned slightly and shook his head.

Li Zhouwei was silent for a long time. He hesitated, the words of Qingyu Qian echoing in his mind.

'Back then, that Liu Changdie visited the lake once and his connection to the Book of Elements was severed by the Azure Insight Origin Mirror. He went from being an anomaly only a True Monarch could sense to a beacon that drew the attention of all divine abilities... and the miracle upon him was stripped away.'

That was Qingyu Qian's explanation. But as Li Zhouwei studied Li Suining, a strange feeling rose again. Wasn't Li Suining just like Liu Changdie?

And yet... Li Suining had shown _no_ abnormality when faced with a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability!

That meant the Azure Insight Origin Mirror had _not_ stripped away the miracle he possessed.

'The Azure Insight Origin Mirror that the fox-kin can't control... it must be in the hands of the "Heavens" Above. And Suining must be carrying some failsafe from those same "Heavens," which is how he walked away from the mirror undetected!'




# Chapter 1111: His Highness

And from his perspective, with the Azure Insight Origin Mirror present, the Heavenly Element divine mystery shouldn't have been in Ting Province. It _couldn't_ be in Ting Province. The fact that Suining obtained it must also be a move by the heavens.

The look in Li Zhouwei's eyes gradually cleared.

'In essence, this is a deep scheme hidden beneath a shallow one. Suining is indeed of the Heavenly Element, but the divine mystery he obtained is likely not limited to that. The future he is guiding is very likely the future that the great personage in the heavens desires.'

If that was the case, Li Suining's vagueness about the Heavenly Element divine mystery finally made sense. This invisible, perfectly concealed chess piece had undoubtedly been placed to target his Li family.

'That's exactly why... Suining cannot have a Talisman Seed. He's bound to be exposed to that personage's sight eventually. If he accepts a Talisman Seed, the karmic link will be instantly severed, leaving no trace. Then the Li family's anomaly will have no explanation, which will only make others vigilant...'

Li Zhouwei understood. The Li family was being watched by millions, and those members who bore Talisman Seeds and gained only a moment's respite by entering the lake... they all seemed free, but in reality, they were trapped in a cage.

Li Zhouwei mused for a moment, his gaze resting on Li Suining, an idea forming in his mind.

He asked, "The next great war between North and South. How much time is left? Can you calculate it precisely?"

Hearing this, Li Suining replied, "Although there have been minor frictions over the years, if I am not mistaken, the true great war is still eight years away!"

Eight years from now would be the Baihai Campaign. It was the final joint northern expedition where the Great Song and Western Shu would cooperate for their own respective gains. It was also the war where the Way of Great Desire would once again pour its forces into the Huai region... Now that Vast Cicada was dead and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm was silent, the timelines matched perfectly. From Li Suining's perspective, the timing should be accurate.

When Li Zhouwei heard this, however, his heart brightened.

'Eight years... That is more than enough time.'

He had emerged from this last war with no major injuries. And the years Li Ximing had struggled to hold on, he had passed through safely by relying on his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body. This meant these eight years... for the Li family, this was an extremely precious period that could be dedicated purely to development and preparation!

He mused for a moment, then suddenly raised his head as if sensing something. He gazed at the horizon, watching the black Profound Banners fluttering in the distance. He knew the people from the Song court had arrived. He stood and said, 

"The Old Master mentioned he wishes to see you. Once you are ready, go out and meet the Old Ancestor."

Li Suining quickly agreed and bowed as Li Zhouwei departed. He waited until the colors faded from the sky before standing up, hesitating in his cave residence.

'Should I tell him... or not...'

At this point, in this situation, Li Suining naturally understood the issue.

'He thinks I possess some peculiar divination ability...'

Li Suining had the urge to confess the truth, but every time he faced Li Zhouwei, he couldn't bring himself to speak.

'Is it really a good idea to confess to King Wei?'

He could hardly imagine what would happen if Li Zhouwei learned the complete story of the Li family's rise and fall. Worse, how could he tell a fervent Dao-seeker that his attainment of verifying the Dao was like the Second Manifestation of the world—destined to fall soon after?

Even if Li Suining knew little about the Quest for Gold, he knew that for a process so steeped in symbolism and the verification of one's path, this was absolutely not a good omen.

'What can be said, and what cannot... it's probably impossible to distinguish anymore.'

He knelt anxiously in his cave residence, pulling a jade slip from his sleeve. He tried to read, but his mind refused to quiet. Pacing a few steps, he finally leaned back against the main seat and closed his eyes in deep thought.

An unknown amount of time passed. His breathing gradually evened out. A flicker of silver light leaped from between his brows, connecting to a brilliant, distant star, pulsing with dazzling radiance.

---

The imperial palace was magnificent and imposing, its deep halls hushed and serene.

"This is the Great Song," Lin Chensheng said, his heart a knot of complex emotions. He was dressed in white robes.

Even though he had learned much at the monastery, walking through the Great Song's palace court still filled him with a disorienting wind of confusion. He felt as if he were trapped in a dream.

He walked silently along the palace corridor. After a while, he saw a woman waiting on the path. Her head was bowed, her hands clasped, her posture exceedingly humble. Lin Chensheng only recognized her when he was standing right in front of her.

"Ziyu!" he said, his voice dry.

Kan Ziyu and Lin Chensheng were old acquaintances. They had grown up together and shared deep feelings, even venturing into a Grotto-Heaven together for training... But looking at her now, this person bore no resemblance to the high-spirited yet gentle Kan Ziyu he remembered.

Only then did Daoist Master Wenqing look up at him, her gaze flickering for an instant.

"So, Daoist Master Chensheng has arrived," she replied. "Please, follow me."

Lin Chensheng immediately masked his expression, a sour feeling rising in his heart.

'The chosen prodigy of my Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... reduced to a minor role, merely guiding others.'

He lowered his head and said nothing more, following her to the deepest part of the palace complex. He bowed low, listening to the surrounding officials whispering among themselves. He vaguely caught a few words... King Wei...

"A great victory, I presume?" Lin Chensheng asked in a low voice.

Daoist Master Wenqing nodded. She seemed devoid of emotion, yet she spoke readily.

"Indeed. A great victory for King Wei. This King Wei is surnamed Li, his given name is Zhouwei. He is a kinsman of Li Xuanfeng. Li Xuanfeng... Brother Chensheng, do you remember him?"

The image of the man holding a golden bow in the Grotto-Heaven instantly surfaced in Lin Chensheng's mind. He nodded. He had only seen him once, but he'd vaguely felt that fierce man possessed something his own Dao Lineage lacked. The impression had stuck with him.

Daoist Master Wenqing added, "King Wei... he should have been born during the era when you and I were prominent. He now possesses three divine abilities."

Lin Chensheng fell silent for a moment before replying, "Chi Wei committed countless evils. If not for that... he should have been a disciple of my Supreme Yang."

"It just means the destiny of the Supreme Yang is exhausted," Wenqing said flatly.

Daoist Master Wenqing had emerged from seclusion several years before him. She had personally witnessed the final hope of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition collapse and had seen the many ups and downs since. She spoke of it with absolute calm.

As they spoke, they arrived at a hall deep within the palace. Grand General Yang Ruiyi was standing there. Beside him, a woman in beautiful green robes waited, her body turned slightly to the side.

Lin Chensheng bowed respectfully. Yang Ruiyi, however, smiled warmly and hurried over to help him up.

"Chensheng is out of seclusion!" he boomed. "I have gained another great general! This gives me much more confidence!"

The title "great general" might have been a courtesy, but the confidence was genuine. No matter how far the Great Xiukui Monastery had fallen, it was no ordinary Dao Lineage. A single Lin Chensheng offered far more than any ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!

The affair between Sword Immortal Lou Xing and the Lingu family had caused a massive uproar at the time. In reality, aside from some spiritual items and resources, Lingu Lanying had ended up with only two Spiritual Artifacts, one of which even clashed with her own Dao Lineage. Lou Xing hadn't touched the true foundation on Tiger's Frontier mountain in the slightest!

'Losing the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword is fine. We still have the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, and the former "Whole Pill" wondrous treasure, the [Un-harming Stone] that was sealed away... And even that aside, the Celestial Xiukui is still on Tiger's Frontier!'

In Yang Ruiyi's opinion, Lou Xing was one of the sharpest minds in the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. His actions back then had minimized the Great Xiukui Monastery's losses while keeping the North completely unbothered.

He was calculating inwardly, but his expression turned sorrowful. He sighed, 

"Fellow Daoist Houfu... truly a model for our generation!"

Houfu's death had been silent and should have gone unnoticed, but matters of life and death could never be hidden from the Underworld.

Lin Chensheng lowered his gaze.

"My uncle died at the hands of Northern cultivators. I, Chensheng, will surely avenge him!"

Whatever his true feelings, Yang Ruiyi was pleased by these words. He helped Lin Chensheng up and led Lingu Lanying over.

"This is Yingjia," he introduced. "Lingu Lanying."

Lin Chensheng nodded slightly in acknowledgment. Lingu Lanying immediately took a step back and said respectfully, "Greetings, Benefactor!"

"Daoist Master, you are too polite."

Even though Lingu Lanying held a royal title from the Great Song, she dared not put on airs before Lin Chensheng. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition may have ended, but it was still a Golden Core inheritance. There was no need to even compare their respective standing in the Yang family's eyes. Besides... in the entire Song state, who didn't know the roots of her Lingu family?
Unless some pretext arose in the future, she would always be a step below him.

Yang Ruiyi maintained an air of nonchalance. He simply smiled at Lin Chensheng and said,

"You've emerged from seclusion just when I need you... I must trouble you all to take a trip to the North."

Lin Chensheng nodded. Yang Ruiyi pulled him aside, whispered a few sentences, and pressed a pitch-black token into his hand. Then, he silently saw the three of them out.

The Grand General seemed to have just recalled something.

"In Qize," he asked, seemingly offhand, "there is a Dingyang Zi. He is... close with your Dao Lineage, I believe?"

Lin Chensheng quickly replied,

"A friendship from a past generation, and so much time has passed... This subordinate will have to return and inquire... It would be best to meet him first before saying more."

Yang Ruiyi smiled and nodded, watching the three depart. Only then did his smile vanish. He turned and walked back inside, heading deeper into the palace.

This place was devoid of any human warmth, filled only with a piercing chill. Faint shadows stretched across the floor. Yang Ruiyi knelt humbly and reported in a low voice, "Your Imperial Majesty, someone from Xiukui has arrived."

The Emperor of the Great Song stood in the hall, holding a three-inch copper hairpin, quietly toying with the bird in the cage before him. After a long moment, he spoke.

"Houfu had integrity."

It seemed the allegiance of the Great Xiukui Monastery brought him little joy. Instead, the death of Daoist Master Houfu seemed to stir something in him, reminding him of another.

"Is Lingmei attempting the Purple Mystery?"

Yang Ruiyi's expression tensed.

"Yes... It has been some time. The events of that year spurred him on. In truth... if the Cheng family hadn't suppressed him and denied him that Life Divine Ability... with his talent, he should have surpassed the Purple Mystery long ago."

The Song Emperor remained noncommittal.

"What is he cultivating now?"

Yang Ruiyi replied, "He originally cultivated Dui Metal. Lacking the Dui Metal Life Divine Ability, 'Position Follows Trust', he naturally sought to compensate with Geng Metal. He is using 'Present Departs Old'. Dui Metal is prone to shifts, so this is not considered an inferior choice."

Yang Zhuo took a step, his mind already elsewhere. He said indifferently,

"The Cheng family has no use for him, so let him cultivate. The current trend of the world aligns perfectly with that Life Divine Ability of his. He has a high chance of success. Once he passes the Purple Mystery, the old capital will see some changes."

The Cheng family's territory was once the capital of Yue State, which is why the emperor referred to it as the 'old capital'. The Yang Ruiyi on the other side nodded.

"His destiny also resonates with his divine ability. This subordinate will absolutely seize this opportunity..."

Before he could finish, the Song Emperor cut him off with a grim look and a wave of his hand.

"Lingmei is the successor of the Sword Gate. The Great Song will not disturb him. But the Cheng family? Are _they_ worthy of the name Sword Gate? We give Lingmei face for now. Once this is settled, Wanyu must also submit to Song's command."

Yang Ruiyi nodded quickly.

"That Daoist Master from the Cheng family always took both prestige and profit for himself. He emerges when it's time to claim benefits and retreats into seclusion when it's time to bear responsibility... With Cheng Gao dead, there's no one left to step up..."

Yang Zhuo shot him a glance, and Yang Ruiyi immediately fell silent, standing beside him without another word.

"Ding..."

With a flick from Yang Zhuo, the clear ring of metal on metal echoed through the hall. The sparrow in the cage, just waking up, stared drowsily at the copper hairpin in his hand.

Suddenly, the sound of rapid footsteps approached. Several people rushed into the hall, but it was a young boy who trotted in. He bowed before the emperor, his voice childish.

"Father Emperor!"

At that sound, a trace of warmth finally entered Yang Zhuo's cold, inhuman eyes. He looked down at the boy and smiled.

"Jiao'er."

This was his third son, Yang Jiao.

For a moment, the icy imperial palace grew warmer, infused with a bit of human life. Even Yang Ruiyi smiled, watching the boy with sincere relief.

Yang Zhuo's harem was small. Of his children, Yang Jiao was the only one truly considered an imperial descendant born after his ascension. The child was young, but incredibly bright.

But Yang Ruiyi knew even more.

This prince was studying the ancient Daoist Tradition, the [Taiyi Profound Truth Art]. He had entered the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature, not the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao!

Not only that, but Yang Jiao's talent was so astounding it had even alarmed the Underworld.

'If he achieves the Dao through True Qi... this prince not only has a limitless future, he might even be able to contend for an Auxiliary Position!'

The significance of this was staggering. Even the Underworld would never object to one more True Monarch.

For Yang Ruiyi, seeing this Third Highness wasn't just seeing a promising descendant of the Yang clan; he was possibly looking at a future sovereign.

"Greetings, Grand General!"

The prince bowed to them both before gleefully pulling a small stone sparrow from his sleeve. He held it up in his palm.

"Father, look!"

The little sparrow was carved with breathtaking realism—two tail feathers, pitch-black claws, red eyes, and a green beak. It was a perfect likeness of the Tanzhen sparrow in the cage beside Yang Zhuo.

"Impressive," the Song Emperor said, glancing at it with interest.

The little prince, however, looked a bit crestfallen.

"But it doesn't move like yours, Father."

Yang Zhuo chuckled softly. With a light flick of the copper hairpin, he opened the cage door, casually took the Spirit Sparrow out, and offered it to his son.

The Spirit Sparrow's eyes were bright and alert. It didn't fly away but simply stared quietly at the young prince.

Yang Jiao's eyes filled with delight, but he didn't take it, clasping his hands instead.

"But Father Emperor, you love this Tanzhen..."

Yang Zhuo smiled and shook his head. He picked up the stone sparrow and blew a gentle breath across it.

Instantly, the sound of fluttering wings filled the air. A white shadow flickered, and the stone sparrow—carved from common jade—sprang to life. It hopped and jumped, utterly alive, before settling quietly on the emperor's finger.

The Song Emperor placed the new bird into the cage and then patted his son's shoulder.

"Go and play."

Yang Jiao's eyes shone with adoration. He offered his thanks and skipped happily out of the hall.

A retinue of attendants flocked around the prince, sweeping him away like the wind. Yang Ruiyi's pupils contracted slightly.

The Tanzhen was a congratulatory gift from the Underworld, incredibly rare and precious. Never mind its small size; if it truly manifested its power, an ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would struggle to capture it. Moreover, it was a creature of the True Qi path, innately skilled at piercing all illusion!

Yet the man before him had merely _breathed_ on a stone, and it had transformed. The suppressed divine ability and the roiling of the Great Void all testified to the authenticity of the bird now in the cage.

'The Emperor's power... what terrifying level has it reached? He is the reincarnation of the Tianwu Metallic Essence, forged from the full might of the Underworld... Truly an existence far beyond any mere 'child of destiny'...'

He remained silent for a long time. Finally, he heard someone approach the hall and report,

"Your Majesty... King Wei has arrived at Zhengxing Palace!"




# Chapter 1112: Imperial Monarch

"Let us proceed."

A smile touched the Song Emperor's lips. He stepped forward, and the light and shadow within the grand hall shifted and intertwined around him. Blazing streams of fire and water began to flow along the steps. He crossed the hall in a few strides and passed through the doors. Immediately, a ceremonial canopy appeared above, swaying gently, shimmering with splendid white and violet light.

Zhengxing Palace was already deep within the imperial court, separated from the emperor's private Taijia Palace by only the Xuanwei Hall. It was typically used for audiences with the Holder of the Profound; ordinary officials were forbidden entry.

Paved paths, known as the 'Dragon's Tail,' flanked the palace. In its center stood a 300-chi-square audience hall, dominated by a massive golden-iron phoenix that pierced the structure from top to bottom. As the Song Emperor passed through, the sound of cascading water, doused flames, and the ringing of golden chimes filled the air.

Only after exiting the hall did Yang Ruiyi dare to lift his head slightly. He saw a man in black robes standing by a pavilion. Li Jiangliang waited upon him, head bowed in silence. On the other side stood another man with a dark, sinister brow.

Only then did Yang Zhuo's eyes, usually as still as placid water, finally rise.

Within the hall lounged a beast, neither tiger nor wolf. Two lethally sharp, jade-white horns crowned its head. As it stretched, the powerful line of its spine was visible beneath overlapping scales. Its eye, turned sideways, revealed a swirl of somber golden rings. Scales layered beneath its eyelid resembled the tracks of mournful tears.

The Great Song Emperor stared, transfixed. The coiled coldness and vigilance within the beast gradually faded, and the emperor's own expression grew obscure.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes gazed over, studying him intently.

Before the hall, the resplendent canopy floated, surrounded by high ministers. The majestic imperial robes hung empty in mid-air. Above the heavy collar, there was nothing. Only a helmet hovered in the void.

The helmet bore a single, blue-violet plume and was etched with gold on its flanks. Beneath the robes, there was no Emperor Yang Zhuo, only a suit of armor.

A long, drawn-out cry rang out.

"Announce! King Wei for an audience!"

The call was as crisp as a jade vase shattering, as clear as golden pearls scattering on the floor. The emperor and the king both shifted their gaze. The coiled beast vanished. A form now appeared beneath the imperial crown, and the formless, world-enveloping phenomenon dissipated.

The sun was setting. King Wei stood turned to the side, facing the hall, poised at the precise intersection of light and shadow. Streaks of golden-red sunset pierced through his black hair, lancing eastward and causing Yang Ruiyi to blink.

"Greetings, Emperor!"

The crimson light fell upon a blue-black imperial robe that slowly brightened in the gloom. The Song Emperor strode down from the hall and inclined his head.

"King Wei, your great victory at Baixiang Valley gratifies Us."

"It was merely by the Song Dynasty's profound grace and the protection of Martial Cultivation."

The two men moved to a high pavilion, and the attendants all retreated to its base. Only Li Jiangliang followed, taking up a jade pot to pour wine for them both. Yang Zhuo lifted his chin.

In an instant, six distinct colors of water and fire flickered to life in his eyes. The world around them seemed to freeze. The Song Emperor said coldly, 

"Leave us."

Li Jiangliang, head bowed, remained utterly oblivious, as if the words had passed straight through him. Only Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly, silent.

The coldness in the Song Emperor's pupils intensified. He said flatly,

"We said, leave us."

The clouds overhead trembled. An invisible darkness enveloped the area. In that moment, it was as if heavy shadows had seeped out of the pavilion, coiling beneath the steps, waiting.

The Song Emperor's expression softened. He glanced at the man before him and asked,

"King Wei, your slaying of Vast Cicada was no feat of Martial Cultivation. It was an act of supreme courage and immortal might. Though We reside in the deep palace, We were moved by it."

The emperor, elegant and poised, raised his cup.

"This cup is to celebrate your triumph."

Li Zhouwei raised his cup and drank, a hint of a smile on his lips.

"If not for matters of cultivation, Ting Province could never have been held. How then could we have this day?"

Yang Zhuo's expression was unchanged.

"The King of Qi was once a stablehand, humbled beneath common soldiers. The Emperor of Liang once guarded a desolate border, trapped in a land of bitter cold. For one who would be an Imperial Monarch, there are cycles of rising and concealment. In times of concealment, Martial Cultivation cannot illuminate the path. In times of rising, even heroes cannot restrain them. Therefore, verifying the Dao and pursuing the Quest for Gold cannot be done from beneath sheltering wings."

He smiled, making no effort to hide his meaning.

"What you seek, King Wei, is to become an Imperial Monarch, is it not?"

At these words, Li Jiangliang should have broken out in a cold sweat, struck dumb with terror. Instead, he remained oblivious, standing blankly.

Li Zhouwei set down his cup and smiled.

"The world is vast, yet no place escapes the Wu Light. The central lands are broad, yet no one evades the Underworld's claim. This subject is indeed seeking the Dao, but even the Emperor of Wei would not dare claim to be beyond all shelter. The Emperor speaks too highly."

Yang Zhuo sipped his wine, silent for a long moment before speaking.

"At the very least, you, King Wei, have a chance to part a wisp of mist and glimpse the azure sky."

As he finished, the sun sank below the horizon. A pale purple darkness crept across the sky, and soft moonlight spilled down, bathing the palace complex in its glow.

King Wei seemed not to hear, his gaze fixed on the wine in his cup.

The Song Emperor rose and paced quietly.

"Tianwu received the Mandate of Heaven from Wei and conquered Jianghuai. The immortals submitted. He pacified the lands without slaughter, raised up immortal sects, and allowed a hundred traditions to flourish. He established the great Ning State's destiny upon the foundation of the Jianghuai King, yet he never claimed the title of Imperial Monarch. Tianwu sought truth and became an emperor; he did not seek to be an emperor to find his truth."

"King Wei, you need not worry. Great Song has no ambition to conquer the world. All lands beyond Jianghuai can be Wei territory. Unless I, Yang Zhuo, perish before I finish seeking the Dao, no one in Great Song will obstruct you, King Wei, from seeking the Dao."

He turned to gaze at the moon.

"That is, seeking the Dao. Not seizing the golden position."

King Wei raised his brows, his golden pupils bright in the night. He watched the Song Emperor quietly raise his cup, his face luminous in the moonlight.

"Ning State received its mandate from Wei," the emperor said. "We now return that mandate to Wei."

Li Zhouwei stood. He did not bow or salute. He simply raised his cup, a genuine smile spreading across his face.

"My thanks, Daoist Friend."

Yang Zhuo burst into laughter, the cold solemnity vanishing from his features.

"A fine 'Daoist Friend'!"

That title seemed a higher honor than all the world's 'Monarchs,' and a smile curved Yang Zhuo's lips that he could not suppress.

His laughter slowly faded. He stared at the moon for a long time, and the imperial mask of majesty settled back onto his face.

"Jianghuai may be small, but it spans two provinces. Shanji is also cramped, yet it festers like a sore on Jiangnan. If they are pacified, two Military Commissioners could be established, along with several immortal sects. Does King Wei have a strategy?"

Li Zhouwei's voice was calm.

"Under the Great Zhao, power fell to lesser hands. The great houses are apprehensive, and the Northern Buddhists are mired in suspicion. The sects of Jianghuai have long harbored dissent; they fear only the Profound Governance. If we can incite one or two of their subordinates, rally factions like Baiye Creek and Chengyun Gate, and lure them with the promise of Martial Cultivation, we can conquer Baihai Creek, break Shanji, and hunt down Lanyan. Jianghuai will be pacified with a single decree."

"The Qing Clan of Western Shu rules without benevolence. Despite their strong defenses, they style themselves as immortal nobility and mistreat those with divine abilities. Their followers dare not rebel, but their hearts lean toward the Song Dynasty. When the greater situation shifts, if we remove their lingering doubts, they too can be made to surrender to Song."

King Wei paused briefly.

"The Celestial Dynasty favors the Immortal Dao, but divine abilities are few. Jianghuai and the Shu region are not places for slaughter; they must be subdued. We must spread benevolence and virtue. But when this subject crosses Profound Truth Mountain, passes the Yan border, stations troops at Luoxia, and marches on the Buddhist Land... then there will be only slaughter, not surrender. We will unleash our full might and virtue, to demonstrate the Celestial Dynasty's infinite benevolence."

Yang Zhuo's eyes brightened. He nodded and raised his cup.

"With King Wei conquering the north, We have no worries."

Li Zhouwei drank his wine.

"Attendants," the Song Emperor called.

The word boomed like rolling thunder, shattering the frozen silence. The wind outside the pavilion roared back to life, rustling the kudzu leaves on the walls.

Footsteps sounded below. A person emerged from the crowd holding a tray and carried it into the pavilion. On a white cushion sat an object covered by a vermilion cloth. Li Jiangliang accepted it and presented it respectfully.

The Song Emperor said, "King Wei, look at this."

Li Jiangliang lifted the cloth. Beneath lay a brown urn containing a handful of dark, grain-like gems that shimmered in the night.

"This is an ancient object," Yang Zhuo said, "called the Heavenly Nurture Urn. It comes from the legendary Protecting Wood, a lineage that has now been severed."

"Protecting Wood is the Dao of nurturing life within wood, and this urn is a Spiritual Treasure from that tradition. Though the lineage itself has suffered, the urn remains wondrous."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. "Protecting Wood? I have rarely heard of it."

The Song Emperor gave a rare smile.

"The lineage didn't always have this name. In ancient times, a wielder of supreme divine ability verified his Dao by severing it. After that, it went through many sordid affairs, and its Dao was obscured. 'Protecting Wood' is a name later generations gave it. You won't find it in the ancient texts, which is why it's so rarely heard of."

"But it is useful. At a critical moment, it can preserve one's life-mandate. And it is exceptionally effective against Buddhist cultivators."

'He is, after all, a reincarnated Metallic Essence fully backed by the Underworld. When Yang Zhuo makes a gift, it's a Spiritual Treasure, no less!' Li Zhouwei certainly wasn't going to complain about having too many Spiritual Treasures, especially one that could suppress Buddhist cultivators.

"This subject accepts Your Majesty's grace!"

But speaking of supreme divine abilities, Yang Zhuo smiled at Li Zhouwei.

"I hear your clan has produced a sword immortal."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"Our clan has always possessed such a heritage. It is rare for a junior to finally be able to take up the Way of the Sword..."

Yang Zhuo looked at him, smiling.

"Coincidentally, both of my sons are fond of the Way of the Sword. My eldest is rather clumsy, but my second son has already formed his Sword Origin. My third son, though young, is also quite fond of the monarch of all weapons."

"He won a great victory. We should reward him."

Li Zhouwei fell silent, understanding Yang Zhuo's intent.

'Holder of the Profound.'

'That's right. In the emperor's eyes, Li Jiangchun, who possesses Sword Intent, is the absolute best candidate for Holder of the Profound! If he were granted that high national position, he could probably frighten off the Merciful Ones in the north. Even Maha would have to reconsider!'

But how could Li Zhouwei bear to part with him?

'What's more... he carries the Talisman Seed. If he takes the post of Holder of the Profound, who knows what abnormalities might occur?'

Li Zhouwei replied,

"This subject has five sons. Li Jianglong, Jiangxia, and Li Jiangliang all serve the Celestial Dynasty to the death. My eldest son, Li Jiangqian, is older and already seeking the Dao. He has a bit of low cunning, so he remains with the clan. If he achieves anything, he too can expand the borders for Great Song. My youngest son alone is unworthy. He has gone overseas to live out his days in peace."

"The clan endures constant battle; old and young perish. The clan elders fixate on this one child. But his nature is wild and rebellious, making it difficult for him to inherit the truth. He also cultivates the Way of the Sword, and his heart cannot be bent. I beg Your Majesty to understand."

His tone was heavy, and Yang Zhuo understood the refusal. He paused, then took a step back.

"My Dao is cultivation, and Sword Intent is the ultimate, true intent. I had hoped your clan's Way of the Sword genius could come to the capital to offer some guidance and perfect Great Song's martial virtue. But I respect your wishes. In Simin, no one can harm him."

This was a polite concession, but it was also Yang Zhuo's final line. Li Zhouwei considered it for only a moment before nodding.

'I can always use 'closed-door cultivation' as an excuse. This requires careful thought.'

The emperor and the king rose. Li Jiangliang followed with the jade tray, handing it to Chen Yang as he stepped forward to receive it.

Yang Zhuo's gaze swept over Chen Yang, lingering for a second.

"We intend to seek truth, elevate immortals, and cultivate Martial Cultivation. Which is true? Which is immortal? Which is martial? Not one can be missing."

The emperor's expression seemed distant.

"However... the false and the hidden are Yin; the true and the manifest are Yang. Tianwu resides in Yang. Therefore, the affairs of Martial Cultivation fall to you, King Wei. I must rely on you for this."

"Yes!"

"This subject takes his leave," Li Zhouwei replied.

He took several steps back before turning to depart. The Song Emperor showed no sign of wishing him to stay. He passed back through the audience hall and vanished into the deep, obscure darkness.

Li Zhouwei straightened up. Without a word, he left the palace, escorted by Li Jiangliang. Once they were outside, his son finally spoke.

"Father... now..."

Li Zhouwei's pace was unhurried.

"We return to Moongaze."

Li Jiangliang was silent for a moment, then heard his father ask, "Is there any sign of a bloodline?"

He silently shook his head.

"Your son and Tianyou are both cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm. It is... difficult."

Whether it was Li Jianglong or Jiangxia, those two Wei descendants who cultivate Bright Yang both had wives and concubines, making it easier. But Li Jiangliang and Yang Tianyou were deeply in love, a perfect match, which naturally made conceiving a child difficult.

Li Zhouwei's gaze flickered. He gave his son a gentle look.

"When you have the time, come to the lake more often."

Li Jiangliang felt a great weight settle on his heart.

"Your son will..." he said hoarsely.

They reached the palace gates. Cultivators knelt on both sides, heads bowed, their respectful murmurs rising and falling. A single black carriage approached, and a man in golden robes hurried out, his black formal attire immensely imposing.

The man rushed forward, heedless of his own dignity, and bowed respectfully. 

"Greetings, Elder Brother!"

"Zhouluo, you've come."

Reunited after so long, Li Zhouwei looked his younger clan brother up and down. 

"Your cultivation has advanced quickly."

Li Zhouluo forced a smile. He looked worried, shifting restlessly. He was, of course, afraid of his elder brother. Few in the Li clan were not. And now, the man before him was also King Wei, amplifying his fear.

The flood of words he had prepared died in his throat. He put on a smile and walked with him for a short way, until Li Zhouwei stopped and spoke with great seriousness.

"The Old Master's health is failing. Find some time to go back and see him. He misses you."

Li Zhouluo's eyes reddened instantly.

"Younger brother understands," he choked out. "I went south several times on this trip, trying to ask that young grand-uncle... but he just lost his wife and is overwhelmed. It kept being delayed..."

Li Zhouwei's heart sank. "How is the old man now?"

Zhouluo shook his head grimly.

"No one dares neglect him, but he's already at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. I've spoken with him several times about adopting a junior for him. He agreed, but said he wants to wait until he's back at the lake... to choose one himself."

Li Zhouwei nodded. Li Zhouluo hesitated, then added,

"Actually... a few years ago, young grand-uncle took in an adopted son, Ning Fuchao. He changed his surname, so he's Li Fuchao now. His talent isn't bad..."

Li Zhouwei waved his hand.

"It doesn't matter. If his character is good, bring him back. We can add his name to the branch genealogy."

He raised a hand, wreathed in light, and clapped his brother's shoulder—a rare gesture. His golden eyes were serious.

"Serve well. Don't worry about home. Of all our brothers, only you..."

King Wei paused, leaned in, and smiled.

"Only you have a sliver of a chance at the Purple Mansion Realm. Do not get entangled. Focus on your cultivation. Your nephews are all bound to follow me. If I am guarding the north and cannot return... through all the ups and downs, you must watch over them for your elder brother!"

"Younger brother will watch over the clan! I won't disappoint..."

Li Zhouluo stammered his assent, watching Li Zhouwei step into the Great Void. Before the dark rift of the Great Void sealed, his elder brother looked back, interrupting with a smile.

"Do not dwell on it. The Old Master is very pleased. No one in the clan blames you."

His hidden anxieties laid bare, Li Zhouluo's face flushed. He stood frozen for a long moment, then let out a breath of pure relief. He scrambled back into his carriage.

"Quickly, to Lord Li's residence!"

# Chapter 1113 Heavenly Nurture

Ting Province.

Inside the magnificent great hall, the atmosphere was grim. Cultivators knelt across the floor below, while high above, a man in crimson robes paced with his hands clasped behind him. He listened to the reports from his subordinates, finally letting out a long sigh.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had won a complete victory in the great battle, suffering no casualties. The situation on the west bank, however, was tragic. Li Jiangzong had been chained to this position for seven consecutive days, unable to rest for even a moment.

"Family Head... the Pu family's young head, Pu Xinya, has also returned..."

Li Jiangzong paused.

"Did he have anything to say?"

The man below shook his head.

"He collected the consolation payment, changed into white mourning robes, and went up the mountain."

The Pu clan had been diligent these past years. They had finally managed to produce a Family Head at the Foundation Establishment Realm, only for him to die in the battle. Although Pu Xinya had been assigned to a market far from home, the original purpose was to temper him. His talent was excellent, and he was a good friend of Li Suining. Li Jiangzong naturally looked out for him.

"This matter must also be told to Suining. It would be best if it came from him..."

He turned to ask, but another subordinate came forward to report.

"Young Master Ning is still on the mountain. His estate's gates are tightly sealed, and he has sent no word."

Li Suining was considered exceptionally hardworking among the clan. Having broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he was a pillar of his generation. Ordinarily, he would have been out and about helping at a time like this. It was the first time he had remained in seclusion for so long.

Li Jiangzong shook his head, slightly surprised.

"Then set it aside for now... You..."

Before he could say more, a series of reports came from outside, and a youth entered the hall.

The young man was dressed in military attire, cutting a heroic and dashing figure. He was born with a truly celestial appearance, his golden pupils shining, and he carried an air of exceptional martial prowess. He offered a salute and said formally,

"Greetings, Clan Uncle!"

A smile immediately bloomed in Li Jiangzong's eyes. He strode quickly down the steps, helped the young man up, and said,

"We are family. Why stand on ceremony!"

This person was King Wei's eldest grandson, the son of Li Jianglong—Li Suihuan!

As the genius of the Li clan's new generation, Li Suihuan's cultivation speed was terrifying. At only twenty-eight, he had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. His cultivation base was faintly on par with Li Jiangzong himself, who stood on the high platform. His speed in reaching this realm was not only the fastest of all the clan branches but had even surpassed several of his uncles. He was second only to his grandfather, Li Zhouwei!

While this was certainly due to the blessing of his Bright Yang bloodline, it was more than enough to prove how astonishing the King Wei's grandson's talent truly was.

Li Jiangzong's eyes were filled with admiration. He watched as Li Suihuan smiled faintly, retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, and presented it to his elder.

"The affairs of the west bank are settled. The land deeds have been redistributed, and all posts are functioning. Stability has been restored."

Li Jiangzong exclaimed in admiration. He dismissed everyone else and led Li Suihuan to the back hall to sit. He read the contents of the slip carefully, and after a long time, he sighed.

"Impressive."

This twenty-eight-year-old grandson had pacified the chaos and ruin of the entire west bank in just seven days. He had repaired the palaces, resumed operations at the spirit mines, and arranged guards for the immortal mountains. He was nothing like the royal scion one would expect to find cultivating in seclusion all day.

This made Li Jiangzong silently think of his own eldest son, currently imprisoned on Qingdu. He grew so angry his insides trembled. He gnashed his teeth and sighed,

"That monstrous beast... if he had even a fraction of your ability, I wouldn't have to keep him locked up!"

Li Suihuan returned the salute but replied with great solemnity,

"Brother Qing... his flaws are only a matter of his arrogant temperament."

Li Jiangzong merely took these as pleasantries. He shook his head, not paying it much mind.

Ever since Li Suiqing had committed that monstrous mistake, Li Jiangzong had given up all hope for him. He had only intervened to spare his life. Since then, he had taken a new concubine and diligently attended to his bedroom affairs. Only his own father, Zhoufang, still cared, occasionally visiting his grandson.

He dropped the subject, noticing that Li Suihuan's face still held a trace of joy. He smiled,

"What's this? You have good news?"

Li Suihuan laughed. "I received a letter from Father! I was wondering if Grandfather has returned?"

Smiling, he took the letter from his sleeve and handed it to Li Jiangzong. Li Jiangzong was slightly taken aback. He held the letter, not daring to read it. Only after Li Suihuan nodded did he open it and scan the contents.

Li Suihuan grinned.

"Father's concubine, who accompanied the army, has given birth to a daughter!"

"Oh?!" Li Jiangzong was instantly overjoyed. "How rare!"

The 'Sui' generation was not lacking in geniuses. Setting aside the royal scions, the brothers Li Suining and Li Suikuan were more than enough to support the generation. There were many others with excellent talent as well. The only regret was the imbalance of Yin and Yang—there were far too few women.

He read the letter, his face wreathed in smiles, but his heart held more than just joy. After so many years as Family Head, his sharp intuition made him ask,

"I wonder which wife it was?"

Li Suihuan gave an ambiguous smile.

"Mother has remained in the capital all these years. The few wives from the family who went along would naturally not accompany the army. The one in the camp was a gift from Lord Yang. She has no background, nor is her surname Yang. It is Huang."

"I heard she is a cultivator from a small clan in Yue State. Her father is traceable, enfeoffed as a minor official in the Dongli area... After this, I imagine he's due for a meteoric rise."

Li Jiangzong understood the implications and relaxed slightly. He felt much more satisfied.

"This is for the best."

Li Suihuan had already stood up, visibly excited.

"My little sister was born in Jianghuai, just as the old year was bidding farewell. Father thought of it long ago and chose the character 'Sui' for her name. He sent this letter back to report the happy news to Grandfather!"

Li Jiangzong nodded repeatedly. He held the letter as if it were a priceless treasure and smiled.

"Let's go! We must see the Old Master at once!"

...

The Heavenly Light was brilliant.

Li Ximing stood up on the mountainside, pacing twice on the white jade-like ground. A small, bird-like wisp of Li Fire circled him once before landing on his shoulder. The Daoist Master's face was contemplative.

After a long moment, he said, "I... truly did not expect the Song Emperor to hold such views regarding the Underworld."

Li Zhouwei stood with his hands behind his back.

"The dissatisfaction in his heart runs even deeper than this junior imagined. After all, no matter how you look at it, the Underworld is determined to see him succeed. Yet, judging by his attitude, he is completely displeased by it."

Li Ximing's brow was tightly furrowed. He looked up after a good while.

"From his demeanor, how much of what he said was true?"

King Wei paused, then shook his head.

"It did not seem false, nor would there be a reason for falsehood. There must be a subtle rift between Yang Zhuo and the Underworld."

Li Ximing looked as if he wanted to say something, but he stopped as Li Zhouwei continued thoughtfully, "Unless... Yang Zhuo himself is unsatisfied with his future path of attaining the Dao. Or perhaps... even for an entity as powerful as the Underworld, possessing the Metallic Essence of True Monarch Tianwu... the True Qi they've obtained by using the entire world as a chessboard... Yang Zhuo is not satisfied with it."

"Is this a disagreement between Yang Zhuo and the Underworld, or between Tianwu and the Underworld? And what exactly is the relationship between Yang Zhuo himself and the Tianwu Metallic Essence?"

Li Ximing pondered this for a long time, finding the perspective refreshing.

"You mean... his emphasis that an Imperial Monarch cannot be subservient, and his point that Tianwu styled himself a True Monarch, not an Imperial Monarch... was a hint? That his conflict with the Underworld isn't about status... but some other problem? Perhaps he feels they are stunting his growth, or... perhaps it's an old grudge from his time as Tianwu?"

He mulled this over, then asked tentatively, "Did the Underworld... play a disgraceful role in the destruction of the Ning and Chu states, both of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition?"

Li Zhouwei said quietly, "Wei is also Encompassing Profoundity."

This silenced Li Ximing. He raised his eyebrows in dawning realization.

"Wei and Chu are known as the Southern and Northern Dynasties. If both originated from Encompassing Profoundity... does that mean the entire mortal realm falls under this single Profoundity? That is... formidable indeed."

Li Zhouwei hesitated for a moment before replying, "It is too early to be certain of these things. But I can see that Yang Zhuo is ambitious. He will uncover the truth sooner or later. This junior is more concerned with another matter."

"This Underworld, and this Luoxia... if they want to elevate a True Monarch, what are their chances of success? How difficult would it be to control a True Monarch? And what methods do they possess to make a True Monarch fall?"

He pressed his hand against his cup.

"It is the same path of attaining the Dao. Why did Emperor Zhao fall so suddenly? When the Metallic Essence of a deceased True Monarch or Immortal attains the Dao again, how does it differ from a successor ascending to that position?"

"In other words, when Jade True attained the Dao all those years ago and managed to retreat completely unharmed... was it because they had the ability and qualifications to do so? Or was it because... the great powers above _needed_ someone to occupy the Jade True position?"

Li Zhouwei paced two steps.

"These answers have been extinguished by history. Besides a few great, renowned powers, only those ancient, powerful clans would know. The Touba, the Shilou, and perhaps the Tao, Wei, and Qi... Once we fight our way into Luoxia, and our cultivation is higher, we should be able to find some answers."

Li Ximing nodded, musing, "In any case, this can be considered a good thing. As long as the Song Emperor stands with you, you won't have to watch your back. The northern expedition will be far more peaceful, and you will have a proper chance to seek your own opportunities."

The two sorted through their gains. Li Zhouwei then took the Spiritual Treasure, the Heavenly Nurture Urn, from his sleeve. He placed it before Li Ximing with a smile.

"He was certainly generous, though."

The item was a gift from the Song Emperor and was naturally ownerless. Li Zhouwei had refined it in the short time since his return. It was the same small, brown urn, but it now showed faint, golden, vertical veins that looked like wood grain. Inside, dark grains of rice rolled slightly with the movement, each one possessing the texture of a gemstone.

Li Ximing took it from his hand, and the mystical connection transferred. A feeling of a blood-link instantly spread from his palm. He tilted the urn slightly, hearing the faint _clinking_ of the gem-like grains colliding inside, but nothing would pour out. He then spotted a line of characters on the urn's bottom:

【My Spirit Resides in the Marsh】.

This Heavenly Nurture Urn, whose Dao Lineage the Song Emperor claimed was extinguished, possessed a full four wondrous abilities!

The main divine ability was Store and Combine. It was described as: The people gather, the people receive, beginning from me; the people pick, the people carry, reaching where I be. With a thought, the urn's mouth would release ten thousand rays of binding light. It could not collect lightning, fire, or Metal Malice, but all other things would be drawn in, unable to resist. This was especially true for anything of water-virtue; it would rush in, never to return.

This collection ability was different from ordinary mystical arts. It could take not only inanimate objects, but also light, illusions, wavering blessings, and even living beings.

A thought stirred in Li Ximing's mind. He saw Li Zhouwei smile.

"If Buddhist cultivators run into this, they're in for a rough time. Especially those of the Compassion Dao... they love establishing their little Buddhist Lands and releasing their Dharma Protectors. If they run into this Spiritual Treasure, Maha might be fine, but Merciful One would probably have all their spell arts crippled. Any spirit bodies they summon would just float powerlessly and fall."

"This junior tested it briefly. I estimate that if you could beat Merciful One half to death, you could collect them inside. They would be unable to call to heaven or appeal to earth. While it's not as good as the Huai River Map in that regard, it's still a wondrous method!"

Li Ximing nodded slowly, then said suddenly, "In that case, this treasure would also be very useful against the 'Upper Shaman' and the 'Xiukui'."

He replied casually, continuing his study of the treasure. The secondary mystical ability was called Bright Alignment, and it was equally peculiar.

This so-called Bright Alignment was quite similar to the Renew ability of the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron from Li Ximing's own 'Gathering Wood' Dao Lineage.

Renew allowed injured spirit plants within the cauldron to recover slowly by gathering spiritual items. Bright Alignment, however, allowed the Heavenly Nurture Urn to hold a massive amount of spiritual resources, which would, over time, condense into a wisp of Sacrificial Millet Earth.

This Sacrificial Millet Earth was nurtured within the urn and served as its core spirit. Its nature was aligned with 'Horn Wood' and 'Treasured Earth'. It could nourish spirit roots, sense them, and complete their life-mandate!

Beyond that, there was another ability used to preserve a life-mandate, called Preservation. Its requirements were strange: it could only be used on a 'guest', not the 'host'. If a cultivator suffered grievous injuries and their Dharma body was collapsing, the Spiritual Treasure's owner could draw them into the urn to temporarily stabilize them.

However, if the owner _themself_ was injured, this ability could not be used at all—unless another person took possession of the Spiritual Treasure and became its new owner.

The final wondrous ability was called Grand Sacrifice. It was much rarer and was used for sacrifice to seize blood-qi. By using Grand Sacrifice to collect three or four hundred cultivators, one could nurture their blood-qi to heal wounds or nourish other items.

This made Li Ximing feel slightly uneasy. A thought quickly turned in his mind.

'Looking at this ability's performance... if it's combined with the first divine ability, 【Store and Combine】... one could theoretically collect a heavily injured Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, strip them of their divine abilities, and refine their essence...'

Pondering this, he couldn't help but give a bitter laugh.

"'Upper Shaman' are barbaric, and 'Xiukui' are grotesque. It's not surprising they would have a Spiritual Treasure like this."

Li Zhouwei knew what he was referring to. He shook his head.

"I don't believe this item belonged to the Underworld originally."

He didn't dwell on the matter, instead smiling.

"I believe this Spiritual Treasure's main power is in Store and Combine, but its most wondrous aspect is Bright Alignment!"

Li Ximing mused for a moment, and understanding dawned. His eyes lit up.

"You mean... that spirit root?!"

Li Zhouwei nodded with a smile.

"Purple Mansion Realm spirit roots are incredibly rare. When the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven found one, it immediately fell into the Golden Feather Sect's hands. As for Foundation Establishment Realm spirit roots, our family doesn't lack for them. But... setting aside cultivation level, a spirit cultivator that has awakened its own sentience... don't we have one of those right here?"

Years ago, when Li Qinghong was traveling, she found a spirit root persimmon tree in Jiangnan that had gained spirituality. Such spirit cultivators are exceedingly rare and take a thousand years to mature, so its cultivation base is extremely low. After being moved to the clan, it has only served to provide the younger generation with an occasional spirit persimmon to taste.

"But with this Spiritual Treasure, the situation is entirely different."

Li Ximing studied the faintly glowing treasure in his hands, growing fonder of it by the moment. He nodded repeatedly in praise.

"Our family has no shortage of spirit rice and other resources. Even if the quality is low, we can easily make up for it with quantity. It's no great loss to use a lot! We will first spend half a year nurturing this Sacrificial Millet Earth."

"This so-called Sacrificial Millet Earth that 'completes the life-mandate'... when it encounters a sentient spirit root, I imagine it will produce a truly unique wonder!"

Li Zhouwei smiled and replied, "I will have to trouble Grand-Uncle with this matter. I am going to select my spell arts and enter seclusion immediately."




# Chapter 1114: Shi'er

Clear qi drifted and swirled.

White mist drifted gently through the pavilion. On a jade platform with a bronze-like sheen, light shone with a burning radiance. A man in black robes stood by the platform's edge, his pupils reflecting slivers of abstruse runes.

A hint of a smile touched his eyes.

Back then, the clan had exhausted its immortal merits exchanging for techniques, leaving only twelve. Before he entered seclusion, he had defeated Taixi and crippled Chiluo, bringing the total to seventy-seven.

But now, a quick look revealed a full two hundred and ninety-six!

He had been in secluded cultivation, and Li Ximing hadn't made many gains. This meant that the battle at Baixiang Valley alone had yielded two hundred and nineteen immortal merits!

The number was staggering.

'Immortal merits are primarily awarded for kills. Back then, slaying Cheng Yan was only worth fifty-seven, and Nu Xiao thirty-five. Even Taixi and Chiluo, whom I failed to kill, were only worth sixty-five combined...'

'This gives a rough estimate of the value of a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability and a Merciful One. Vast Cicada was a fifth-generation Maha and one of the Buddhist cultivators; his value should far exceed an ordinary mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert. Even so... it might not have been enough to reach over two hundred.'

'It seems his status as the favored of the Precious Tusk Golden Land, giving him the air of a minor master of a Buddhist Land, added quite a bit extra!'

Li Zhouwei mulled it over for a moment, thoroughly pleased. He gave a cold, inward sneer.

'I wonder how many immortal merits Sparrow Carp Fish and Jiang Toushou will get us!'

The Crimson Severing Arrowhead had compensated for his lack of flexibility. After slaying Vast Cicada in this great battle, Li Zhouwei's own gains were far from shallow, and a plan had long since formed in his mind.

"For charging assaults, I have Sovereign's Perilous Tread. For movement, I have Crimson Severing Arrowhead. For suppression, I have Audience with the Celestial Gate. All my bases are covered. Aside from a few Great Daoist Masters and Great Mahas, no one can claim to have me firmly suppressed. But I am not without flaws."

"I have more than enough power to overwhelm, but not enough killing power."

Li Zhouwei had only managed to slay Vast Cicada because the Spiritual Treasures in Yang Ruizao's and Tinglan's hands had played a major role. If he had faced the enemy alone, trying to suppress and execute him, he still couldn't bypass the clumsy, slow drawbacks of Audience with the Celestial Gate and the Radiant Sun King's Halberd.

'As of today, the fourth-grade Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light can no longer keep up with my divine abilities. Emperor Qi's Light, when boosted by the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, has decent power and can lock down a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert on Touba Ci's level. But it is, in the end, a light of the Yang Extremity. It excels at winning through unorthodox means, not at direct engagement. It lacks the magnificent, righteous power to execute an enemy head-on.'

'I need a spell art for direct, orthodox combat!'

But as Li Zhouwei searched, his brows knit tightly. He found nothing that truly satisfied him.

The spell arts available were broadly divided into two types. The first was the path of the Bright Yang Emperor-King, which used brilliant imperial might to suppress foes. Most of these, like Audience with the Celestial Gate and Sovereign's Perilous Tread, were variations on a theme. Ultimately, they couldn't escape the label of 'cumbersome'. If there were no flanking controls, an enemy could simply break apart, scattering like bandits into the common populace, making them impossible to constrain.

The second type, modeled on arts like Eternal Brightness Steps and Luminous Heart, was the path of luminous cultivation, of plucking yin to nourish yang. While flexible, versatile, and possessing subtleties that hardly seemed to belong to Bright Yang, they lacked any domineering, killing intent.

He kept searching, but the prices of the spell arts he reviewed climbed higher and higher. He had no choice but to relax his criteria slightly, expanding his search to include Li Fire arts. Only after considering what would pair well with his existing divine abilities did he find a few candidates.

A Li Fire Bright Yang art, the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method, and a Supreme Yang Bright Yang art, the Questioning the Sun Manifesting Yang Scripture.

The Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method was essentially a Li Fire art. It used one's life-mandate to resonate with the Great Void, constructing a snare of considerable power. Its true marvel was that it used the Great Void as its source; once summoned, it would appear from thin air and drop directly onto the enemy's head. Not only was it exceedingly difficult to defend against, but it also had a binding effect upon striking.

This point alone made Li Zhouwei extremely fond of it.

The Questioning the Sun Manifesting Yang Scripture used the Supreme Yang as its foundation and also possessed the ability to bind and separate. Based on the ancient Supreme Yang divine ability Gazing Heaven Governance and the modern Sun-Splitting Hairpin, it could shatter an opponent's divine abilities and lock down their physical form, making escape or concealment impossible.

Both had their merits. The Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method had a wider range of applications, but the Questioning the Sun Manifesting Yang Scripture possessed a deadlier killing intent. Li Zhouwei compared them for a long time before finally choosing the former.

'Li Fire Bright Yang is closer to my own affinity, after all. Supreme Yang isn't distant, but the difficulty is much higher. Furthermore, the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method uses my life-mandate to resonate with the Great Void. My personal destiny is extraordinary, which should make cultivating it more convenient.'

There was also one other, minor consideration—the Questioning the Sun Manifesting Yang Scripture was related to the Supreme Yang. Anything that touched upon Yin and Yang saw its value skyrocket. It was a full seventy immortal merits more expensive than the first art.

'Uncle-Grandfather still has several spell arts backlogged, enough to keep him busy cultivating for a century or two. He won't be needing new ones anytime soon. But the two juniors are coming out of seclusion, and I still need to acquire techniques for them... I must save where I can.'

He lit incense and prayed, awaiting a response from the heavens. After spending one hundred and ten immortal merits, he turned and returned to his cultivation abode, sinking into meditation.

---

The courtyard was magnificent.

A colossal, mystical tree stood in its center, its yellow-green leaves forming a canopy that blotted out the sky. Pale red flower buds hid among the high branches, a delightful sight. The purple-gold light of the great formation filtered through the leaves, sprinkling shattered patterns on the ground below.

The Wanling Flower Tree had bloomed by Moongaze Lake for generations, and the Li family had never neglected this spiritual root. In just over a hundred years, it had grown so thick that it would take several people to encircle its trunk, a picture of extreme prosperity.

The ground, usually immaculate, was now piled high with mounds of spirit rice that undulated like small hills, gleaming golden in the ambient light. A small, dark-light urn hovered in mid-air, inhaling the grains one by one like a great whale drawing in water.

Li Xuanxuan stood by the steps for a long moment, praising the sight, though his voice was tinged with a pained reluctance.

"A Purple Mansion Realm Spiritual Artifact... truly extraordinary!"

As he spoke, the green-robed Daoist Master beside him immediately chimed in with a polite laugh.

"Old Senior! It is a Spiritual Treasure, after all. Something an ordinary Daoist Master couldn't hope to obtain. Qinghu is truly envious!"

Although Li Xuanxuan's cultivation was low, his current status was sky-high. When Sima Yuanli had heard the news that Li Zhouwei had slain Vast Cicada, he couldn't even muster a trace of jealousy. He was entirely focused on currying favor, his attitude exceedingly deferential.

Li Xuanxuan shook his head repeatedly.

"Sir, you are too kind..."

Sima Yuanli was here to guard the lake. Li Ximing, however, had other plans and had specifically summoned him. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, a faint smile on his face. Watching the last wisp of spirit rice flow into the urn, he commanded,

"Come!"

At his word, the small urn dropped into his palm, glowing with a dim, hazy light. 

This Daoist Master explained, "Although this Sacrificial Millet Earth is refined, it cannot be without spiritual resources to nourish it. We'll let it eat its fill first. We won't need to bother with it for several decades."

Such a marvel was beyond the imagination of a minor cultivator. Li Xuanxuan let out a long sigh, his eyes fixed on the treasure.

"It is just like a living thing," he replied.

Li Ximing had already strode before the persimmon tree.

By now, the spiritual root was as thick as a water bucket, its branches lush and its leaves a vibrant emerald. Pale green fruits swayed, hidden among the boughs. Seeing Li Ximing approach, the tree immediately began to quiver, rustling like the sound of rain as it trembled in fear.

At the same time, the Life Divine Ability Li Ximing was circulating sensed the spiritual root's nascent consciousness. With a single thought, he could extinguish its mind, reducing it to a mundane object.

The Daoist Master raised the treasure in his hand and smiled.

"You have shared a bond with my Li family for many years. Today, that bond shall be fulfilled!"

In an instant, a furious wind roared. Boundless dark clouds gathered in the heavens as the earth began to tremble. Locked in place by the Bright Yang divine ability, the spiritual root was torn from the ground, every last fiber of its root system intact, and levitated shockingly into the air.

The spiritual root was frightened out of its wits. A faint, weak cry for mercy rang out, causing the old ape nearby to take a panicked step forward, its ancient eyes filled with worry.

The Daoist Master tossed the Spiritual Treasure. The fist-sized mouth of the urn instantly expanded, unleashing a powerful suction. Within its depths, a vision of fertile earth appeared, wreathed in clouds and mist, pulsing with a profound light!

Bright Alignment!

The massive spiritual root vanished in a flash. The profound urn, in contrast, spun in the air, its illusory colors growing more brilliant. The golden patterns running vertically down its surface brightened, making it look surprisingly more like a simple wooden urn.

Amid the dazzling green light, a few needle-thin, tender branches emerged from the urn's mouth. They coiled around and bloomed small yellow flowers, swaying joyfully. A clean fragrance instantly filled the air. Li Ximing caught the Spiritual Treasure as Sima Yuanli praised,

"Such potent spirituality!"

Li Ximing tilted the urn's mouth, and a projection of fertile earth appeared. The swaying persimmon tree stood within the multicolored light. Its branches and leaves looked the same, but its aura was now obscure and indistinct—utterly different from before.

Sima Yuanli saw this clearly and gasped in amazement.

"This spiritual root's life-mandate has become one with the Spiritual Treasure. It's completely changed! The designs of the ancient cultivators are truly astonishing!"

As the Spiritual Treasure's master, Li Ximing's perception was even clearer. The persimmon tree had lent its life-mandate, and the Heavenly Nurture Urn had provided its status. With the two combined, the nourishment the tree received was terrifying to contemplate. In turn, the Heavenly Nurture Urn had become brimming with spirituality, even gaining a measure of autonomy to face enemies on its own.

'They complete each other. The only pity is that if this Spirit Persimmon is ever to leave the Heavenly Nurture Urn, the spiritual root itself will likely not survive. Not only that, but it would require a great divine ability to re-nourish the Spiritual Treasure... Still... a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual root is hard to find. A Spirit Persimmon is more than good enough.'

Still unsatisfied, Li Ximing made a slight hooking motion with his finger. The multicolored light swirled, coalescing into a pair of shears that snipped a branch from the tree. He then retrieved a finger-sized piece of black wood from his sleeve, turned, and smiled.

"Daoist Friend Qinghu—if you would, some of your Valley Water."

Sima Yuanli understood at once. He summoned his gourd and, with a thought, a stream of Azure Radiance Pure Essence—famed for curing illness, restoring life, and recreating bodies—surged out. As it poured down, Li Ximing gathered his sleeve and intoned an edict:

"Today, I transmit a true law, teaching you to create an alternate body."

His fingertip blazed, and the Light of the Six Harmonies erupted.

'This light governs the six harmonies, balances heaven and earth, serves as a companion to gods, and questions the cosmos!'

A companion to gods!

In that instant, a brilliant, clear light shone. The Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood dissolved within the Valley Water. A new form coalesced, and a young acolyte seemingly appeared from thin air.

She had elegant features and a beautiful, jade-like face with ruby lips. She wore feathered robes, her hair was bound up, and her sleeves seemed to catch the wind. Her cheeks were adorned with five-colored makeup. Her bright eyes darted around, shining with a faint confusion. She quickly knelt and spoke in a crisp, clear voice.

"Greetings, Master!"

Li Ximing, thoroughly pleased, lowered his hand and laughed. Sima Yuanli, however, remained stunned for a long moment before stating, dumbfounded:

"Zhaojing... what a divine ability!"

Li Ximing, with a flick of his sleeve, plucked the profound urn from the air as if grasping the moon's reflection in water. He handed it to the acolyte to hold and smiled.

"It is merely an unorthodox trick!"

This truly highlighted Li Ximing's skill. World's Radiance and Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body were already exceptionally compatible; otherwise, he would never have mastered Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body so quickly. By turning World's Radiance outward, he had managed to align it even more perfectly with the 'companion' aspect of 'companion to gods'. He had actually managed to pull it off.

He looked the new acolyte up and down.

"Born from an urn... and a persimmon tree..."

The words inexplicably caused Li Xuanxuan to raise his head, his gaze questioning. Li Ximing hesitated.

"Wengshi (Urn-Persimmon) doesn't sound very pleasant. You... shall be called Shi'er."

Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan closed his eyes, looking as if he wanted to say something but was holding back. He mused internally,

'Wengshi... That ridiculous Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array... that really was this kid's naming. This time, Shi'er sounds much better...'

(AI/TL: Zhaoguang means Bright and Broad)

Li Ximing paid him no mind, listening as the young acolyte replied in her bright voice:

"Master, Shi'er understands!"

Li Ximing asked her a few casual questions, then turned away. Shi'er immediately lowered her head and made a face at the White Ape by her feet. The old ape shook its head in surprise, but its eyes glistened with the faint sheen of tears.

The old ape had watched over the plants in this courtyard for a hundred years and had developed a parent's affection for them. Seeing her achieve this fruition, how could it not be overjoyed?

Li Ximing had a good grasp of the situation.

'Her mind is that of a twelve or thirteen-year-old... She does have memories... At least she recognizes everyone.'

This was an excellent outcome. He hadn't used any precious materials for Shi'er's body; in a Purple Mansion Realm battle, it would be as fragile as paper. He could just retract her into the Spiritual Treasure. But for all other matters, she would be incredibly convenient.

'In a fight, she can't compare to Xuanyi's Bai Yinzi, but she has her own benefits. Her body is maintained by my divine ability, so she has no lifespan limit. If she's passed down for a few generations, who knows what she might become.'

He turned back to Sima Yuanli with a smile. Daoist Master Qinghu seemed lost in thought and had remained silent. At Li Ximing's gaze, he finally snapped out of it.

"The Severed Branch Spirit Molt that Zhaojing required. I have found it."

He produced a jade box from his sleeve and opened it gently. Inside were five or six short wings, clustered together like fallen petals. A look of joy crossed Li Ximing's face.

"Excellent!"

This item was a key ingredient for the Fading Sun Armour-Break Pill. Li Ximing had been unable to decipher the pill recipe for some time, only gaining enlightenment after receiving guidance from Li Zhouwei. Now that Sima Yuanli had brought the spiritual item, he said joyfully,

"As per our agreement, once the pills are refined, I will give Qinghu four!"

Sima Yuanli smiled and nodded, though his mind was clearly elsewhere. He didn't actually need the pills; he was merely returning a long-standing favor for pill refinement and hoping to strengthen their connection...

But before he could say more, Li Ximing smiled.

"I have a matter that I must trouble Daoist Friend Qinghu with."

Sima Yuanli smiled. He listened as Li Ximing continued:

"Since you have seen the Heavenly Nurture Urn, I will speak plainly. Within the urn is an art called Grand Sacrifice. It has the power to imprison and to strip."

Sima Yuanli's eyebrows rose, a look of confusion on his face. But the smile on the gold-and-white-robed Daoist Master's face turned icy.

"If one could imprison a divine ability, seize its marvels, and nourish the urn... would that not be a fine thing?" he asked softly.

Sima Yuanli froze, reacting only after a long moment, as if seeing this Daoist Master for the first time. A deep chill filled his heart. It was a long time before he finally spoke.

"That... would be truly difficult!"

Li Ximing smiled at him, then said with slow, deliberate care,

"I, Li Ximing, would naturally never capture a person for such refinement. But for certain Demon beasts whose crimes are too numerous to list... opportunities will arise. And if not, some of the Spirit Beasts and mounts from the Buddhist Land would also serve nicely."

Only then did Sima Yuanli lower his head slightly, sinking into thought. Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back, smiling as he gazed out at the shimmering surface of the lake.

He had invited Sima Yuanli here not just to borrow his Azure Radiance Pure Essence, but more importantly, to say these words to his face, providing a pretext for his future actions. Of course, Grand Sacrifice was not his true goal.

Even without Grand Sacrifice, there would have been enmities and grudges, and a need for spiritual items. Li Ximing's trip to the Southern Borderlands all those years ago had been to lay the groundwork for this very moment. It was only ever a question of finding a good excuse.

'Before Jiangqian emerges from seclusion, the matter of the Azure Talisman must be settled!'




# Chapter 1115: Spring-Frozen Blood (2)

The Ling River snaked through the land, mountain peaks rising one after another. Amidst the swirling clouds, a table and a platform were faintly visible. A golden formation was embedded in the ground, where a woman veiled in white gauze was pouring fine wine. The reflection in the wine shimmered with a hint of light.

A Daoist Master in blue robes strode over, smiling.

"Daoist friend Zhaojing, you've come at just the right time!"

Li Ximing smiled and nodded. His gaze swept over the woman beside the Daoist Master, and he said,

"I have often heard that your noble path upholds the balance of yin and yang, cultivating the immortal way of male-female union. Seeing it today, it is exactly as rumored!"

The Daoist Master approaching with a smile was none other than Liaoluo of Mount Qusi. Hearing this, he knew Li Ximing was referring to how most of the female cultivators practiced as cultivation cauldrons. He chuckled,

"My Mount Qusi lineage has always researched the paths of male and female. In ancient times, we even had the Great Dao of yin-yang complementation. Later, we added the inheritance from the Yin family's Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate—'Bright Yang,' you understand. I'm sure you've heard of it, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing found it difficult to respond and merely gave a few dry laughs. Liaoluo shook his head and smiled.

"If you had come in earlier years, Daoist Master, the atmosphere on the mountain was far more blatant. In recent years, the Mount Jingyi lineage split off, Kuang Yu went to Hengzhu when she was young, and there aren't many people left on the mountain. Plus, I've cultivated 'Converging Water'... so this tendency has faded."

Li Ximing nodded and changed the subject.

"That pagoda..."

Li Ximing had discussed worldly matters with Li Zhouwei long ago, arranging for Guo Nanwu to bring the item to Liaoluo. Nearly a year had passed since then. He had received news and made his own calculations, which was why he had made this special trip.

Hearing his words, Liaoluo smiled and called out casually, "Attendants!"

Several serving women approached in a line, each holding a tray. Atop a white jade cushion sat a stone, about the size of two fingers. It pulsed with Heavenly Light, and flames licked within it, flushing the surrounding clouds an orange-red.

Radiant Sky Stone.

This piece of Radiant Sky Stone was nearly twice as large as the one Li Ximing had used for his breakthrough. Resting on the jade, its colors were dazzling, and he was visibly moved.

However, a closer look revealed that this Radiant Sky Stone was different. The light and flames upon it blazed, and Li Fire seemed to dance faintly within. Daoist Master Liaoluo adopted a serious expression.

"The materials for that pagoda were quite valuable. It used Radiant Sky Stone and Chongming Golden Essence. I have already extracted them, but the two spiritual items have completely achieved profound unity. If you wish to separate them, you'll have to find a 'Whole Pill' cultivator."

Li Ximing nodded in praise.

"Daoist friend, your skill is magnificent!"

There was a reason Li Ximing had sought out Daoist Master Liaoluo. The man was an artifact refiner who also cultivated 'Converging Water,' making his ability to gather and consolidate materials first-class. In just under a year, Liaoluo had settled the matter without even delaying his own cultivation.

Li Ximing, however, had no need to find a cultivator to separate them. The two spiritual items being merged was of no consequence to his family. He just smiled and nodded, asking no further.

According to the rules of Mount Qusi, aside from the proper payment for artifact refinement, any materials below the Purple Mansion Realm, or any additional Purple Mansion-level resources that constituted less than ten percent of the total, were kept by the mountain. This was just like how Li Ximing skimmed a few pills for himself during alchemy—an unspoken understanding. Since the man hadn't charged him a fee, Li Ximing naturally wouldn't try to reclaim these scraps.

Liaoluo waved his hand and led him to a golden platform off to the side. In its center was a fist-sized hole leading deep underground, from which flames raged. Faintly visible within was a golden embryo, as long as an arm and as thick as a finger.

Liaoluo said, "Daoist friend mentioned that time was of the essence. For Vast Cicada's Li Fire spear, I invited Nanwu to help refine it. We melted away most of the impurities and all of its embedded Dharma-releases, leaving this embryo. It can be reforged according to your wishes. The only thing is, the materials are in profound unity. The Tianyang Radiant Copper that was originally in the spearhead has now fused with the entire body. It's suitable for forging a Spiritual Artifact that is completely uniform!"

"By my estimates, it can be finished by the end of the year!"

Li Ximing had not expected such speed. He was overjoyed, understanding that Liaoluo's entire Dao lineage must have been mobilized for this task.

"This... Thank you, Daoist Master!"

He intended to have this forged into a Spiritual Artifact for Li Jiangqian immediately. The time required to forge a Spiritual Artifact was terrifyingly long, and Li Ximing didn't want Li Jiangqian to emerge from seclusion only to wait another dozen years!

With this embryo, he had saved an unknown amount of time.

The Daoist Master simply smiled.

"My skills are just parlor tricks. The Great Daoist Master is the one with true immortal talent. You sent that Valley Water treasure here. It has only been one hundred and sixty days. Once it reaches three hundred, all of its dharmas will be dissolved, its components separated, and it will be reborn!"

"Oh?" Joy instantly lit up Li Ximing's eyes. "I heard that the Valley Water Glazed Treasure Seat had already achieved profound unity, to the point where it was impossible to reverse. I never expected that in the Great Daoist Master's hands, extracting all the spiritual items from within would take less than a year!"

Liaoluo shot him a meaningful glance.

"The Great Daoist Master's abilities are rare in this age! Even when the Ancestral Master was alive, he praised his artifact refinement arts as having reached the peak of perfection!"

Dingyang Zi was currently in Qize, making a meeting difficult. Li Ximing had come personally this time precisely for artifact refinement. How could he not understand the implication? He solemnly pushed forward the Radiant Sky Stone that had merged with the Li Fire.

"Then I must ask the old Daoist Master... to refine an artifact for my family!"

The Li family possessed a good number of spiritual resources and items, but few were unallocated. Although they had four Purple Mansion-level spiritual items, the one from the 'Upper Rite' had no current use and was being used to gather qi; the Concealed Plunder Gold and the Long Yue Variable Gold were used for casting Dharma Arts; and the Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue had to be saved for Li Que'wan. Still, if he squeezed, he had things he could use.

His spiritual resources, on the other hand, were abundant. Thanks to the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, the Neck Feathers supplied over the years had filled nearly all the gaps in their expenditures, allowing their resources to slowly accumulate. Excluding the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, which was difficult to quantify, and the two portions of Crimson Radiance Li Amber reserved for Li Jiangqian, which couldn't be touched, he had plenty.

He had two remaining Neck Feathers, one portion each of Heart-Taste Baleful Qi and Cangzhou Serpent Scale, one portion each of Shangxiang Silver, Golden Branch of the Late Tassel, and Bound Heart-Ice, plus the newly obtained Nightshade Spirit Grass and the Heart-Armor of the Yù-Beast he kept at the bottom of his chest. That was nine portions in total.

'That's more than enough for a Spiritual Artifact!'

The first thing Li Ximing thought of was not a weapon, but spiritual armor for Li Jiangqian!

Li Jiangqian had no particular preference for weapons. With the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, he was covered for both offense and defense. If he also had a suit of Li Fire armor, received an Azure Talisman, and condensed a divine ability, he would be a standard combatant capable of tying down three ordinary divine ability users!

'And what's more, there's that golden embryo...'

As for the golden embryo, Li Ximing thought of his family's King Wei. Li Zhouwei's quip about 'using it better than me' had just been a joke, but Li Ximing had taken it to heart.

'He's a figure who shakes the north, after all. It's truly unsuitable for him to still be fighting with a mere spirit embryo.'

He thus stated his request. Daoist Master Liaoluo immediately fell into deep thought, then shook his head.

"The golden embryo... Since it is being forged for King Wei, how can it be made from nothing but Vast Cicada's broken weapon? I fear that would be beneath his station. We must use the golden embryo as the bone, and the merged Radiant Sky Stone and Chongming Golden Essence as the blade. We must have my Great Daoist Master personally forge it. Only such a weapon can contend with the Spiritual Treasures in those others' hands!"

Li Ximing had a realization, and a hidden light gleamed in his eyes.

'That's an excellent idea. If those two items are merged, the result might even rival the weapon of Chu Yi, the Wei Emperor's reincarnation!'

He said joyfully, "What you say is absolutely right, Daoist friend! I must trouble you to do your utmost. If there is any lack of spiritual resources to complete it, I hope I might be able to trade for some!"

Liaoluo said solemnly, "This is my duty. The mountain has plenty of Bright Yang and Li Fire spiritual resources, and the Great Daoist Master has even more. Just leave it to us!"

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. He currently planned to use his Neck Feathers to extract spiritual water, so he didn't offer them. Amidst Liaoluo's insistent refusals, he left the Nightshade Spirit Grass and the Bound Heart-Ice as a contribution.

He did not intend to stay overseas for long and quickly rose to take his leave. Before he left, however, he couldn't help asking one last thing.

"That Valley Water Glazed Treasure Pagoda... if it is successfully refined, what kind of spiritual items might be obtained?"

The Daoist Master replied, "At least one Valley Water item and one Gold-attribute item."

'Valley Water and Gold...'

Li Ximing's consciousness slipped into the Great Void as he pondered. 'It looks like they can only go to Que'Wan. A 'Whole Pill' cultivator needs to cast many arts. If I can use the Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue with these, it would be perfect for refining a sword technique for her. Good. That saves Jiangqian from getting a Spiritual Treasure while she has empty hands.'

He finalized the arrangements, but after a moment's thought, he felt a little uneasy.

'Mount Qusi is an ally, and this is mutual aid. But this way, I'm just taking their charity. That's not the way of allies, nor is it a principle to live by. I'll likely be burdened by this debt of gratitude.'

He mulled it over and sighed.

'I can only find a way to make it up to them in the future!'

---

The normally clear surface of Moongaze Lake was dim and heavy. Shards of ice collided violently, emitting sharp, cracking sounds. A faint red bloomed within the waves, like unfurling bolts of blood-red silk, appearing unnervingly calm in the dark, grim wind and rain.

Broken, purple-gold profound pillars sank into the lake, their jagged surfaces piled high with glittering fragments of ice.

The entire mountain was covered in corpses.

Above the lake, heavenly thunder rolled through thickly gathered dark clouds. A dangerous aura washed over the scene. A woman in a Cinnabar-red skirt stood within a gloomy, multicolored light, saying not a word.

Faint traces of blood stained her beautiful face. Her snow-white, slender hand gripped a profound sword used for Dharma Arts. Her gaze was ice-cold as she stood upon the clouds, surrounded by the rumble of thunder.

"RUMBLE!"

A dark shadow faintly emerged from the heavy mist. A middle-aged Daoist stood against the horizon. He had sharp brows, star-like eyes, a wide face, and thick shoulders. He wore a white and yellow Daoist robe, his expression placid as he quietly observed the woman below.

"Lord Xuan'an truly has remarkable divine abilities. Even with no strength remaining, he still managed to suppress an Immortal Artifact to release a wisp of Heaven-Governing power, causing the other lords to misjudge His condition. By struggling until now, you have caused my North to suffer grievous losses..."

'Li Que'wan...'

The Daoist's gaze was calm, yet filled with killing intent. His tone, however, held a smile.

"Three divine abilities. That counts as skill. If you weren't born into the imperial family, you might have been a figure destined for the Quest for Gold. A pity."

As he spoke, all the wind in the world began to howl southward, whipping the woman's red skirt about. Her pale face was a mask of deep-seated hatred. Her red lips parted slightly.

"The immortal mountain honors reclusive cultivation, unstained by the mortal world. For Lord Yao to descend the mountain to govern the Profound Governance Pavilion, and then to breach my Song border... is this not... entirely without reason?"

The middle-aged Daoist took a step forward, casually drawing a divine spear from the clouds. One after another, fans made of clouds began to gather behind him. The ringing of metal sounded once more. He gently stroked the long spear, his gaze lowered as he spoke flatly.

"Ever since King Wei slew Xuanlou, this has not been a mortal affair. Between myself and the imperial clan, there is no reason left to be spoken."

Li Que'wan still refused to retreat even half a step. She stared silently at the spear's long blade, watching the Spiritual Treasure grow brighter and brighter. The Daoist chuckled.

"As for the mountain, Guanyi will naturally provide an explanation. At worst... I will send this head to the Underworld, in exchange for their cooperation."

The radiance of Yao Guanyi's perfected divine ability shone like a full moon, illuminating the land. A trace of a smile flashed across his face. The bright blade in his sleeve retracted, and the surprise in his pupils vanished.

"So, it's the Un-harming Stone. Supplemented by a 'Whole Pill' cultivator, it is innately fearless of water and fire. It seems that even though Lord Su perished in the Converging Water, and despite the new wounds of later generations, this Spiritual Treasure is still formidable."

Though the woman in the clouds was unharmed, her expression grew heavier, touched by a faint despair. The divine ability in her hand flared, multicolored light cycling.

"RUMBLE!"

Thunder and rainstorms echoed through heaven and earth. Waves of purple lightning once again submerged the land. The few solitary profound pillars still standing finally toppled, crashing down with a deafening roar.

There were very few figures left on the island. After an unknown time, a man in copper armor struggled to his feet amidst the collapsed ruins. His cracked and shattered eye slid down his cheek, and his empty socket stared blankly at the sky.

"THUD!"

The woman was already kneeling in the clouds. The profound sword that belonged to her was now in the Daoist's hand.

"Pfft..."

The profound sword, covered in Cinnabar-red runes and used for casting Dharma Arts, pierced through her. With a light flick of the man's fingers, it had already shot forward, passing through the woman's chest and bursting from the feather cloak on her back, shedding a vibrant, multicolored light.

"Ugh..."

Viscous, mercury-like blood welled along the blade's edge, still struggling stubbornly to retract into her body. Li Que'wan's lips were bloodless. She trembled, and then a world-shaking screech tore through the air!

"SCREECH—"

The resounding cry of a bird flashed for only an instant before being muffled by the thunder. A two-colored, red-and-white profound bird soared into the sky, earning only a slight nod from the Daoist.

"A 'Whole Pill' cultivator, after all."

He simply raised his hand, plucked a wooden urn from his sleeve, and tossed it lightly into the air. In an instant, profound mysteries converged, and a gale roared to life, seizing the profound bird that was attempting to flee and hide. No matter how it struggled, it could not escape.

If anything, the sight of the urn made the bird's cry even more shrill and desperate.

"THUD!"

Torrents of clear, spiritual qi poured down, accompanied by silver light. A silver-robed youth emerged from a patch of ruins, stepping through the Great Void. He steadied himself on the ground, which was covered in blood and gore. As far as he could see, no one was left standing.

'Why? Why was it so fast...'

The most terrifying thing imaginable had happened right in front of him, leaving his gaze hollow with terror and disbelief.

'King Wei... he clearly just reached the Wei capital... Why?'

The Li family's direct bloodline and its cultivators had nearly all been killed on the shore. Only the old and the young remained on the island. How could they possibly withstand the Profound Thunder?

'How is this possible... I remember... they held on for many years after King Wei fell... How can this be?'

Li Suining sank blankly to his knees, his vision blurred with tears as he stared at the ground. Suddenly, he saw a familiar face.

Old Man Du.

He looked as though he had fallen from a great height. His face was a ruin of blood and flesh, but because of the frigid weather, his upturned eyeballs were half-frozen in their sockets, grotesquely semi-solid. Li Suining started to reach out a hand but snatched it back, unable to look. He raised his head, utterly lost.

In the darkness, a lightning strike illuminated the land. Atop the mountain peak stood a man in shattered armor, his body covered in wounds, his gaze serene.

'It's Ding Weizeng...'

Ding Weizeng looked like he wanted to roar, but the blood surging in his throat choked him, sending him into a fit of coughing. It was as if he had triggered some cosmic mechanism. The fury brewing in the rolling black clouds found its target, and a silver bolt of lightning struck down!

"RUMBLE!"

The stalwart man didn't make a sound. The flesh on his body instantly exploded, and his white bones shattered into fragments, cascading down like an avalanche. They tumbled into the ruins, painting everything a visceral, bright red.

A single charred skull rolled down the steps, striking the broken jade with a crisp sound. It clattered against the burned remnants of wood, thudding hollowly, before finally rolling to a soft, muffled stop in the gore. It came to rest directly in front of the kneeling, silver-robed man.

The man stared, insensate. His ears were filled with the roar of thunder, a deafening rumble that drowned out all other sound. He felt the cold rain lashing his face. The rain, conjured by dharma power, could not freeze, but it carried a chill that pierced him to the bone.

His profound senses were linked to his grotto-heaven; he could still rise and flee. But he knew it was meaningless. Everything was already over.

The young man kept his head bowed, kneeling in the deluge, staring blankly at the charred skull.

"Splat."

The sound of profound boots stepping through the viscera was distinct. A pair of gold-and-white boots stopped in front of him. The man remained motionless, head down. A long time passed before he heard the Daoist's voice.

"Li Suining."

He showed a flicker of reaction. His voice was low and hoarse.

"Why."

The Daoist raised his hand, palm flat. The Heavenly Nurture Urn in the sky immediately fell into his grasp. It shook violently, as if a ferocious beast were trapped inside.

As the Spiritual Treasure trembled, pools of mercury-like liquid and Cinnabar began to manifest in the air. The man chuckled.

"Why? Naturally, because your abilities were too great. So great that they had to deploy me."

Li Suining raised his chin. His gaze was now utterly calm.

"Lord Yao, you've slaughtered your way to the lake in a great massacre. What standing does this give the Song Emperor?"

The Daoist casually tossed the Spiritual Treasure into his sleeve, and all the strange phenomena vanished. He gazed quietly at the sky, his expression one of wistful regret.

"Originally, no one cared about King Wei colluding with Yang Zhuo. Their Daos are different, after all. But now... I suppose this counts as 'fulfilling' their ambitions."

Li Suining's expression darkened. He numbly followed the Daoist's gaze. Torrents of water and fire were rising from the south. Beneath the profound darkness, a single column of white qi soared into the sky, flickering unstably.

'In the South, verifying True Qi.'

He felt a chill seep into his bones, unable to comprehend it.

'The Song Emperor is verifying the Dao? At this time? Why? On what grounds?'

'It's too soon... Everything is too soon... How could this happen... Can they just achieve verification whenever they wish it?'

The thoughts in his mind seemed to shatter like glass struck by lightning. He whipped his head back in panic, staring at the northern sky. There, beneath the heavy pall of clouds, he finally saw it: a faint golden light, falling, flickering like a dying sunset, barely visible on the distant horizon.

'In the North, verifying Bright Yang.'

Li Suining snapped his eyes shut as tears streamed down his face. A scalding heat boiled in his chest. He could no longer restrain his grief and choked out,

"We just wanted a path to survive! You wanted King Wei to complete the Quest for Gold, and he already reached the Wei capital..."

"Why? Why couldn't you wait even one moment!"

"RUMBLE!"

The flashing lightning illuminated his face. The rain grew more ferocious. Thunderbolts writhed in the sky, greedily eyeing the earth. The Daoist-robed man planted his long spear upright in the bloody water and watched him quietly.

"Things have already been taken to their extreme, Li Suining."

The violent rain sent ripples through the blood, which began to flow in swift currents. Yet, the torrent parted around the Daoist's golden boots, leaving a clean patch of ground. Yao Guanyi spoke softly.

"For Bright Yang to fall and imperial power to wane is certainly what the great lord wishes. But is there only one great lord on the mountain? Who among them doesn't have disciples and beloved students? In the eyes of some, it is naturally for the best if King Wei verifies his gold and then perishes."

"I certainly did not wish to destroy my own future, but the grudge for Xuanlou's death had to be avenged. As it happens, this also fulfills their desires."

Li Suining's voice was a raw rasp.

"Then what about the Underworld? What about the Song Emperor?"

Yao Guanyi laughed but did not answer. He began to pace silently, as if unwilling to speak. But seeing Li Suining, his clan annihilated, his own death imminent, Yao Guanyi finally hesitated. Whether out of pity or respect, he spoke.

"Li Suining, what is 'curbing indulgence with righteous nature'?"

Li Suining knelt in the storm, his bloodshot eyes fixed on the Daoist.

Yao Guanyi met his gaze and said flatly, "'Righteous' means to protect, persevere, and elevate the king. It is order, governance, correction, and stability. It is the proper sovereign. 'Indulgence' means evil emerging from nowhere. It is treachery, license, desire, and chaos. It is transgression."

"Killing the king. Is it 'righteous' or 'indulgent'?"

"This 'righteous nature'... is it King Wei, or the Wei Emperor?"

Li Suining's brows shot up. Bloody tears streamed down his cheeks as he spat,

"If that's the case, why the hypocrisy! Yang Zhuo made no promise, how dares he claim to be 'True'!"

Yao Guanyi was silent for a long moment before speaking.

"If a King can depose an Emperor, he is upholding righteousness and executing a tyrant. If he attempts regicide and falls, he is 'indulgent' and has been struck down by Heaven. Succeed, and he becomes the righteous king; fail, and he is the indulgent rebel. It has been thus since ancient times. The Song Emperor is confident, and he also believes King Wei can succeed. He is, naturally, no hypocrite."

Li Suining said hoarsely, "So you just wanted King Wei to fail. Killing Wei Xuanyin, slaying the Yan Crown Prince... those were just excuses. It was because King Wei's destiny was too strong that you had to besiege him early, force him to attempt the Quest for Gold while his kingdom was broken and his armies in chaos. Then you immediately executed the imperial clan to damage his destiny."

Yao Guanyi turned his head away.

"It's more than that. This matter... I am not the one in charge."

But Li Suining no longer cared. He stared into the endless darkness and said quietly,

"Even if you manage to fix this, if King Wei fails to gain the position, the fact that the Song Emperor supported him can never be erased."

Yao Guanyi stood in the rain for a moment. A slow smile crept across his lips. He raised the long spear again, weighing it in his palm, and laughed.

"Li Suining, you are wrong. You, King Wei... you are all travelers lost in the fog."

"You stand here in Jiangnan, looking north at the Seven Aspects and the great families, and you see such foolishness! They clearly know the mountain will force King Wei to attempt the Quest for Gold—the only question is success or failure—yet they all think they can seize destiny. They throw themselves into the fire, one after another, until nothing is left but a sea of blood..."

"But from the North, your Jiangnan looks exactly the same."

"Do you think the Underworld needs Yang Zhuo to 'seek the True'? That they are begging him to take the throne? Do you think the Underworld can accomplish nothing without him? That thought... it's no different from those monks in the North who believe Mount Luoxia truly doesn't care about King Wei!"

"Li Suining, you are wrong!"

Bright lightning once again seared the night sky. Yao Guanyi's face was a mask of self-mockery. The spear had turned, aiming down his arm at the young man on the ground.

"How could the great figures base their critical plans on the actions of a lowly cultivator!"

He spoke flatly, but his words were like a wisp of spectral wind, terrifying and deep.

"Yang Zhuo _is_ King Wei. He is the Underworld's King Wei."

"They want him to 'seek,' but they do not require him to 'succeed.' Mount Luoxia sees King Wei as a tool. How much more highly do you think the Underworld views Yang Zhuo? As long as he makes the attempt, as long as he quests for gold, the matter is settled."

Li Suining's pupils dilated. He stared at the Daoist in utter disbelief, then slowly lowered his head. The long spear was piercing his chest, pinning him to the bloody ground. An intense, hollowing emptiness washed over him.

"Pff."

His life-mandate was entrusted to his grotto-heaven; he had countless ways to escape. But in the presence of this Great Daoist Master, whose divine ability was perfected, all of it was empty talk. The 'Heaven-Governing' divine ability and its dharma power faded, bit by bit, as the Spiritual Treasure was withdrawn. The silver-robed man coughed up great mouthfuls of illusory, glittering color.

These colors dissolved into a chaotic mass of starlight. Constellations shifted, traversing the Great Void, leaping and floating, rising and falling in the bloody deluge, before quickly dissipating like smoke. His figure scattered like the wind. Yao Guanyi stood silently in the storm, staring blankly at the ground.

In the last moments of his life, Li Suining's head slowly drooped. The storm grew more terrifying, now mixed with snow and ice. The bones and blood beneath his knees were swallowed by the rushing torrent.

For an instant, the Great Void trembled. Something bright and brilliant flashed. A massive, eggshell-like curtain of light appeared over the ruined island, as if a paradise were falling from the heavens.

"RUMBLE!"

An unknown time passed. The air flashed hot and cold. From within the roiling waves of qi, a faint, multicolored light began to flow. A middle-aged man stood in the surging river of blood, silent. The six short swords at his waist swayed, chiming softly.

His slender, phoenix-like eyes stared gently at the blood at his feet. He watched the current sweep away the fine ice, winding into the darkness. Near the shore, the water was dark red, ice crystals clinking. In the distance, it was still azure. It was just as the poem said: _Half the river shivers, half the river's red._

This Great Daoist Master of Mount Luoxia lowered his gaze and said dejectedly, 

"Today is the Beginning of Spring. You... you really know how to pick a day."

Yao Guanyi seemed to understand. He smiled.

"Since disciple-brother spoke, how could Guanyi dare to disappoint?"

Xueyang did not smile. He stood stiffly, his back to Yao Guanyi. He felt no joy, only a profound sorrow and confusion that sealed his lips in a long silence.

Yao Guanyi, however, tossed away the profound spear. He undid his robes, removed his immortal crown, and let his hair fall loose, a look of wild freedom on his face.

He laughed.

"Disciple-brother... you're here to clean house, aren't you!"

---

The cave-dwelling was utterly silent. A faint luster shone from the white-jade table, where a thick sheepskin map lay covered in dust. On it, the ink depicting the great river was dark and heavy, winding and soaring, its colors bright.

The youth sleeping against the main seat twitched, as if trapped in a nightmare. The silver light between his brows flickered and pulsed, rapid as a panicked breath. After an unknown time, his eyes snapped open.

"Pfft!"

Li Suining spat a mouthful of blood onto the floor. It wasn't red; it spattered like a solid, scattering into a spray of fine, bright silver motes. His gaze was ice-cold, fixed on the ground, his face rapidly turning a ghastly, pale white.

"Cough, cough..."

The piercing, death-like suffocation in his chest lingered. Li Suining's eyes rapidly filled with blood. He braced himself on the floor with one hand, pressing the other to his forehead. The world spun before him, a dizzying blur.

A long time passed before the young man let out a shuddering breath. He looked around, dazed. The agonizing pain still echoed in his mind, but it couldn't suppress the sheer horror rising in his eyes.

He sat blankly for a moment, then scrambled to turn around, looking at the main seat behind him.

After one look, he began to laugh.

"Hahahahaha..."

It started as a faint buzz, but it grew louder and louder. He laughed until he was doubled over, laughed until his eyes were crimson, laughed until tears streamed down his face. He collapsed onto the ground, heedless of his image, his face pale, but he could not stop laughing.

'Yao Guanyi... so that was it... Yao Guanyi... so that was the reason!'

'So—you were watching all along!'

After another long while, Li Suining stood up, feeling as if he had returned from another life. He looked around, reluctant to let the feeling go, confirming that his life-mandate was still his own. The Heaven-Governing Thunder Mansion was still resting in his sea of qi.

Wave after wave of dizziness washed over his Shengyang Acupoint. He couldn't speak. He soon knelt back down, closing his eyes.

After a long time, Li Suining wiped the tears from his eyes. His expression became decisive once more. He extended two fingers and pinched a smear of the silver powder that his blood had become.

'This was transformed by the 'Heaven-Governing' divine mystery.'

In his past life, Li Suining had surpassed the Foundation Establishment Realm. He possessed a completely different level of Dao-Profundity and experience. Combining the drilling pain in his mind with the intense dizziness at his acupoint, he understood at a glance.

'This is the price of the Heavenly Element... My life-mandate... has most likely been damaged.'

But he didn't care. He brushed the silver glow from his fingertips as if it were nothing but incense ash. Li Suining stood up again and pushed open the cave door. The moonlight was bright and clear, casting a pure radiance. A cold chill hit his face.

He hurried across the steps and pulled up the old man who was leaning against them.

"How long has it been?" he asked in a low voice.

The old man yelped, "Aiya! Young Master Ning, you're finally out of seclusion! A lot of people came by asking... they all said... they..."

Li Suining's gaze suddenly locked onto the old man's face. The bloody, mangled image from his vision flashed in his eyes, pouncing like a hungry wolf. He turned his head away, overcome, his face pale.

Old Man Du was observant. He hadn't finished his sentence before he noticed the young man's strange expression and quickly changed his tune.

"Young Master Ning... today... is the eleventh year of Martial Cultivation. Only three days of the first month have passed... You... You've been in seclusion for a whole year!"

Li Suining closed his eyes, forcing the tears back. His voice was hoarse.

"Is it the Beginning of Spring?"

"Yes, it's the Beginning of Spring."

He suppressed the hatred and fear in his heart, murmuring as if still in a nightmare,

"Is the lake frozen?"

"Replying to ge'er... the cold has lingered late these past two years. It's all frozen solid."




# Chapter 1116: This Life's Affairs, Concluded

The snow whispered down.

The lake water near the shore had frozen into a solid sheet. A sky full of heavy snow cast a deep gloom over the world, and the roads were empty of figures. Li Suining stood silently in the storm, draped in a thick cloak.

_Crunch._

The sound of breaking ice and snow was both muffled and sharp. He trudged a few steps, sinking deep with each footfall, before stopping. He stared into the swirling blizzard.

'So this is how the Heavenly Element is used?'

Rebirth into a second life had sent Li Suining into fits of near-maniacal joy. Countless threads of thought had unraveled for him in that instant. Even looking back on the past few years, he found new clarity.

'The Vast Cicada affair was never just my doing. I am not the only one who has changed things between this present world and the first. At Xuanmiao Temple... beside Qi Lanyan, there is someone else!'

This solved so many of the mysteries that had plagued him.

'Gongsun Bei's baffling arrival at the lake wasn't random, either. It wasn't an impact I caused. It was him... Fan Kang...'

As far as he knew, this Fan Kang was a disciple of the Profound Governance Pavilion. All of Qi Lanyan's recent actions were because of him! It had been an intractable problem for Li Suining, right up until Zhao State lost Jiangnan. Qi Lanyan was forced to flee, suffering defeat after defeat, and finally, Fan Kang died at the hands of his own people.

But soon, another layer of confusion clouded his mind.

'This is the third life, though.'

'Do all Heavenly Element Scions have this ability, or is it just me?'

Li Suining had never left Moongaze Lake, so he'd never had the chance to meet any of these others. Even if ordinary people knew they were reborn and possessed memories of the future, they wouldn't just randomly wonder how many times they had been reborn... or what changes had occurred...

He remained silent.

'If it happened twice, will it happen a third time? When I arrived... it was five years before the Yang clan took the throne... plus ten years of Martial Cultivation meditation, for a total of fifteen years.'

'Is it triggered by time? Or a specific action? When will it be next...'

His gaze drifted, lost. Ever since his rebirth, Li Suining's eyes had always been firm and calm, but standing here in the vast, swirling snow, he felt a sliver of doubt.

'These fifteen years... was I right or wrong?'

He had believed he could reverse everything. The events of his second life had seemed to confirm his impact. He had saved almost everyone who could be saved in Moongaze Lake. The harm from the Murong clan's Compassion Dao bringing the Changhe Rebellion south was also minimized...

In matters concerning the Underworld, his own junior martial uncle hadn't died, which prevented the incident of King Wei entering the imperial court. The relationship between Song and Wei grew even closer. Even Situ Huo's rebellion was strangled in its infancy, forcing that old man to remain reluctantly with the Capital Immortals Dao.

The Dragon-kin were also brought into accord. The Dragon King finally abandoned his plans. The tomb for King Wei, originally planned for the Eastern Sea, became a mere bluff. That Dragon King Danhai, Guangfou, even came to the island personally to present King Wei with the Quest for Gold method of the Wei lineage, which had been lost in the dragon palace!

They had even obtained the crucial Quest for Gold method! His own Daoist Masters had poured out their blood and sweat, doing almost everything that could be done. His King Wei's achievements and reputation were several times greater than in the first life!

But then, someone on Mount Luoxia made a move.

And so, the entire situation collapsed like an avalanche. Li Suining, who had expected to witness King Wei's Quest for Gold, ended up dying even earlier than Li Zhouwei. In fact, almost the entire Li family was wiped out at the very moment Li Zhouwei was verifying the Dao!

Li Jiangchun fell in battle in Jianghuai. Li Que'wan, rushing out of seclusion, was forced to face Yao Guanyi, who had perfected his divine ability. As for their forces in Zhao State, it was a disaster. King Wei's sons were surely scattered, unable to even see one another. Of the remaining troops, who surrendered to the Buddhists and who to Zhao... it was impossible to know.

'Luoxia and the Underworld definitely have Dao Embryo wielders. In other words, immortals.'

The absolute gap in power between them made him feel as if he'd been plunged into an icy abyss, cold to the bone. Li Suining realized he didn't just need to _change_ things; he had to _defeat_ them. And blindly increasing his own strength wouldn't be enough.

He stared grimly at the lake's surface, a trace of regret in his eyes.

'Wei Xuanyin.'

In the first life, Wei Xuanyin, the Grand Preceptor of Great Zhao, had died while seeking the Dao. It was said he was only a single step from the Golden Rank, a fact that had once shaken the world.

But in the second life, King Wei defeated the Zhao army ahead of schedule, invaded the lands of Qi, contended for the Central Plains, and entered Guanlong. His cultivation speed doubled, and his presence reached its zenith. Li Suining was overjoyed at the time and immediately plotted with the Profound Governance group to ambush and kill Wei Xuanyin, proposing,

'Your Majesty must kill Xuanlou. Retread the path of imperial might and seek the Golden Rank.'

Yang Zhuo gave this matter his full support, even emphasizing it several times. But when they were gathered in the mystic realm, King Wei was clearly displeased. He had said,

'Xuanlou seeks to uphold the balance of yin and yang. His Dao is righteous. There is no benefit in eliminating him.'

But Li Suining was driven by two things. First, he wanted King Wei's path to enlightenment to be smoother, and removing this man would also fulfill the Song Emperor's wish. Second, he felt that Wei Xuanyin's fated death while seeking the Dao would unleash a wave of yin energy that would affect Li Zhouwei. If he could be eliminated, even if only to accumulate prestige, it would be for the best.

He had been blinded by the favorable situation. After all, in Li Suining's eyes, the second life was proceeding perfectly under his guidance. The relationship between the Yang and Li clans was excellent, and the Song Emperor was friends with King Wei. That emperor was destined for greatness and was known for honoring his word. With a Golden Core expert providing shelter, his family's future was secure.

With a safe retreat, the natural next step was to ensure Li Zhouwei could succeed in-attaining the Dao.

He deliberated for three days before finally hardening his resolve. He said:

'If we do not kill Xuanlou, the northern lands cannot be pacified. Your Majesty has already mastered all five methods. Removing him would be a favor to the Song Emperor and would protect our clan.'

Simultaneously, the storm in the northern lands intensified, pushing the situation to a peak of chaos. Aided by various factors, the Great Daoist Master Xuanlou fell in the imperial capital of Great Zhao.

But now, as he stood in the snow, a bitter realization struck him.

'Wei Xuanyin didn't represent Great Zhao, or the Profound Governance Pavilion, or even the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao!'

'He didn't seem to have close ties to Luoxia, but he _represented_ the ideals or plans of a certain faction on Mount Luoxia... His death ripped away their 'face' entirely...'

'That wasn't a good thing... In fact, it was a warning. A warning that mortal affairs had spun out of control and were threatening the grander scheme! It made Luoxia turn its gaze this way!'

'The sudden collapse of the situation in my previous life... his death was the starting point. Once Yao Guanyi took charge of the mortal realm, it was just as he said... things were already irreversible!'

Even thinking of it now, his gaze dimmed.

'Qi Lanyan, having been protected by Xuanlou, should have understood. Wei Xuanyin was actually trying to control the situation, to keep it from escalating. When King Wei said he sought to uphold the balance of yin and yang, this is what he meant. Wei Xuanyin was the last person who wanted to see yin and yang destroy each other...'

'Looking at the final result of the second life... Yang Zhuo wasn't comfortable with it either. The emperors joined forces, and after all that struggle, it was the Underworld that profited most. The radiance of Martial Cultivation was several times brighter than in the first life. Meanwhile, certain people from Luoxia lost both 'face' and followers.'

He closed his eyes, thinking for a moment, then shook his head.

'But Yang Zhuo isn't safe, so the Yang family must be suffering too. In truth, the real winners are still Luoxia and the Underworld. The only ones who lost out were the minor factions beneath them...'

He had only been standing for a short while, but the snow had already buried his boots. Li Suining didn't notice, his gaze fixed silently.

'The Underworld is indifferent, but Yang Zhuo isn't evil. The Dragon-kin are fickle, but Guangfou can be reasoned with. Luoxia's power is immense... but fortunately, King Wei doesn't have to defeat that immortal—just the one giving Yao Guanyi orders.'

'The only way to break this stalemate is to make _Him_ miscalculate.'

He stood in the snow for a long time, sorting through his thoughts.

'Regardless, I absolutely must not leave Moongaze Lake. I shouldn't even go north. Staying on the southern shore is best... I'll wait until our Daoist Masters break through, until the mystic realm is established and our life-mandates are secure. Things will be much more stable then...'

...

Profound Governance Pavilion.

The winter snows had lasted an unusually long time this year. Below the immortal platform, everything was a vast expanse of white. Snow and frost caked the stairs, yet a small black shadow could be seen moving upon them.

It was a monk in black robes.

The monk's robes were simple, even thin for the weather. His calves were wrapped in white cloth, a stark contrast to his black shoes. Beside him, Maha Fachang supported him, his face etched with guilt.

"I apologize for troubling you to make this trip, little Martial Grand-Uncle..."

The black-robed monk shook his head, seemingly unbothered. In fact, he looked to be in high spirits as he climbed the steps. Halfway up, he saw a man in white robes strolling down to meet them.

The man's black hair was unbound, his eyes gentle. Against the vast white snow, he had an ethereal, immortal bearing. It was none other than Wei Xuanyin of Great Zhao.

He smiled.

"Forgive me for not welcoming you sooner. I am Xuanlou, a disciple of the Transformation."

The black-robed monk smiled in return.

"You honor me. I am Kongshu of the dharma realm."

This monk was none other than Kongshu, the disciple from the dharma realm with the highest Dao-Profundity and the most vast divine ability!

Fachang watched this, and beyond his surprise, he felt a surge of joy, even excitement.

The Profound Governance Pavilion belonged to the Viewing Pavilion faction. If one traced its Transformation Daoist Tradition all the way back, it had deep connections, claiming lineage from a direct disciple of the Master of Comprehending Profoundity. It was a noble heritage, and as a result, the cultivators there held Buddhist cultivators in low regard.

Even Buddhist cultivators with connections, like Vast Cicada, wouldn't be offered a seat here, let alone be welcomed personally by the host!

Wei Xuanyin had always been humble, so the greeting didn't seem out of place. But for the guest to be a Buddhist cultivator... the implication was profound.

'At least... the Profound Governance Pavilion acknowledges our little Martial Grand-Uncle's status. They recognize his Dao-Profundity... No wonder they deferred and delayed, finally forcing him to be the one to come.'

At this thought, Fachang felt a bit more confident about their objective. He fell in silently behind Kongshu as the black-robed monk sighed.

"Senior, you are too formal."

Wei Xuanyin replied,

"Liaohe Temple is the orthodox line of the Buddhist Dao. Furthermore, it is the place where Zhizhan Tianjia succeeded in verifying the Dao. It is only right to offer such a welcome."

As soon as he said this, Fachang's heart sank. All the joy he'd felt was instantly drained away, replaced by a bitter taste.

'So that's it... _that's_ the status they're acknowledging!'

When Kongshu heard this, he fell silent for a moment. For the first time, a flicker of confusion crossed his brow. He pressed his palms together and replied, 

"Liaohe Temple is in the past. Senior Xuanlou need not dwell on it."

Wei Xuanyin didn't answer, merely leading the two to the top. He stopped before the main plaque. The monk Kongshu pressed his palms together.

"There is no need to go inside. We can spare Senior Xuanlou the trouble."

Wei Xuanyin hesitated for a moment. The heavy snow drifted down around them. He lowered the hand that had been resting on the hall door.

"Very well."

The three of them began to walk casually through the snow on the wide platform. The black-robed monk seemed lost in memory and grew very quiet. After a long time, he spoke.

"Mount Dayang has had some disputes with my realm. We have... disagreements... about the south. This is not something my realm can resolve alone. We must ask Senior Xuanlou to help us deliberate."

Wei Xuanyin shook his head.

"Great Virtue, you came because of Vast Cicada. It seems Mount Dayang cannot swallow this loss. They want to use this as a pretext to force my hand, to have me reclaim the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple for you."

Kongshu did not deny it. He pressed his palms together.

"I am ashamed. We were busy settling the dharma lineage and gathering the dharma corpses. Disputes arose within the dharma realm, and the matter was delayed time and again, bringing us to this day."

Wei Xuanyin's eyes grew colder, though he smiled.

"I thought monastics were above worldly affairs. And yet, here you are, shirking responsibility."

The sarcasm was biting, but Kongshu merely shook his head.

"Being unstained by the world... our disciples' cultivation is insufficient. They cannot achieve it. Their Dao-Profundity is lacking. They do not have the state of mind to make a boat of the bitter sea, so naturally, they dared not respond."

"Hm?"

Wei Xuanyin froze, frowning at the monk. He saw only frankness in the man's expression. His eyes were bright and clean, without a trace of hypocrisy. Wei Xuanyin realized he had misjudged him and nodded to himself.

'He really is more capable than Fachang.'

Before the black-robed monk could speak again, Fachang chimed in with a sigh.

"Daoist Qi oversaw the situation that led to the violent death of our Dao's Maha. Though he had no intent to harm, the karma remains. This cannot be dismissed lightly... Within the dharma realm... there are many voices questioning Lord Wei..."

Wei Xuanyin blinked.

"Me?"

His Dao-Profundity was immense, and he was an exceptionally sharp man. He understood the implication immediately and burst out laughing.

"Oh? You think I'm the one destroying the Bright Yang? Using it for my own cultivation?"

"What a joke!"

Kongshu shook his head and held up a hand, cutting Fachang off.

"Senior Xuanlou, Vast Cicada fell to his own karma. No one else is to blame... Kongshu merely has one question."

Wei Xuanyin looked up as the black-robed monk continued.

"What is it you are waiting for, Lord Wei?"

The monk pressed his palms together, looking directly at Wei Xuanyin.

"Since the Profound Governance group was entrusted to you, the intentions of the mountain should be clear. Yet you seem reluctant to be the enemy of the Bright Yang. If you had been willing to act, the situation would not be as it is today."

A smile touched Wei Xuanyin's lips as he listened.

"I've heard the Realm Lord has many Golden Lands, and vacant positions as well. Why do you, Kongshu, delay? Why do you remain, listening to sutras and pondering Zen? If you were willing to step forward, I imagine you would already be a great personage."

The monk didn't seem surprised. He finally smiled, though his expression was tinged with regret.

"Lord Wei, today the Bright Yang rises only to fall. It is not an auspicious time. Why not temporarily retreat to a yin position and serve the greater good? Seize your destiny, and seek the Dao in the next life. Is that not the favored method of your tradition?"

Wei Xuanyin sneered.

"If this life is defiled, how can the next be free of it? Every one of you hopes I will join you in the muck, that I will walk a heretical path. Even the Zhao Emperor schemes against me, deliberately granting me the title of King. I understand. You are all betting that I will fall, that I will be killed, that I will seek and never find."

"But my life-mandate is my own. If I am to succeed, who can plot against me? And if I am not..."

He lowered his gaze, brushing the snowflakes from his sleeve.

"This life's Dao will be settled in this life."




# Chapter 1121: The Orthodox Position

Wei Xuanyin finished speaking. At his side, Fachang listened with silent, secret admiration. Kongshu, however, merely pressed his palms together. He was not surprised, but his face was filled with emotion as he nodded.

"I heard that before Daoist Master Shaomian began seeking the Dao, he returned to the Tao family... He stated that the rise and fall of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao were one and the same, and that it would all depend on Xuanlou. Looking at it now, the old Daoist Master's insight was truly remarkable."

"The Wei family... is, after all, a blood descendant of that personage."

Hearing Kongshu mention his late master, Tao Ping, a ripple passed through Wei Xuanyin's eyes.

"I understand what you mean, Kongshu. Although Li Jieyi is no longer part of the Seeking the Purple Pavilion and has transformed from 'Xuan Chan' into the 'Vast Cicada' of today, he is, in the end, of the same generation as I. It's not that I never tried to persuade him, but his karma is settled. Even if Xuanwei himself were here, he could only offer four words: 'He brought this upon himself!'"

"This little monk understands."

Kongshu sighed softly.

"Regarding the matter of Vast Cicada, I will tell the dharma realm to give up hope. At least, for now..."

He seemed to have forgotten the original purpose of his visit, his gaze resting on Wei Xuanyin with profound meaning.

"This little monk once heard a story."

"Back when the Liang dynasty fell, Guo Wusi declared himself King Yong. He cultivated Valley Water and battled Qi Wang, a cultivator of Molten Fire, in Yongzhou. The great powers of the world assumed that in this clash of water and fire, one was bound to be destroyed, and the victor would become the lord of Yongzhou."

"Guo Wusi was a genius of Yongzhou, descended from a line of great generals from the Wei dynasty. He had attained the 'wisdom eye' and had high hopes of seeking the Auxiliary Position through Valley Water. Qi Wang was his equal, with a deep background and a strong contender for the Auxiliary Position himself. However, Molten Fire was less renowned than Valley Water, and Guo Wusi's fame was far greater. At the time, half the Central Plains were inclined to follow his lead."

Wei Xuanyin's eyes flashed.

"Xuanlou has also heard this. But they weren't the only geniuses of that era... After all, no matter how much the Touba family revered the Wei, they were still foreign tribes. The lands had been in turmoil for so long. Every great family and common citizen hoped for an Imperial Monarch of true Xia descent to emerge..."

The monk nodded, his tone full of pity.

"At that time, the Murong Xianbei had already consolidated his power, his might at its zenith. Guo Wusi feared that the state of Yan would play the fisherman and reap the benefits, so he repeatedly tried to negotiate with Qi Wang, urging him to resist the foreign invaders first. But Qi Wang saw his own chance to attain the Dao as being intrinsically linked to Guo Wusi. He made a three-point pact with the Murong Clan and immediately turned to attack Yong."

"In the end... Great Yan naturally broke the pact. It resulted in one of the two kings falling in battle and the other being captured. Although Qi Wang survived, he lost all possibility of ever seeking the 'golden position' and died full of resentment."

Wei Xuanyin said quietly, "He placed too much faith in the promises of so-called great figures."

Kongshu pressed his palms together.

"You cannot entirely blame Qi Wang. Their Daos were different, so their outcomes were destined to diverge. Even if Qi Wang had not chosen that path, he would have lost his chance for the Quest for Gold regardless. Why not take the gamble?"

"I have some guesses about Your Excellency's own Dao path. It is one where Yang manifests and Yin recedes, where Wei rises and Zhao falls. But although Profound Governance is powerful, the tide of this era is not something your faction can control alone. This, too, is a narrow path along a perilous cliff. Relying on just yourself and Lord Yao Guanyi, controlling the situation will be incredibly difficult."

"Setting aside the larger situation, Bright Yang is explosive, domineering, and judgmental. Lord Wei may have no intention of descending into yin-natured wickedness, but how can you be certain that King Wei does not harbor ambitions of emulating the Wei Emperor? Even if he doesn't, might others force his hand? You must be cautious. Extremely cautious."

The black-robed monk closed his eyes.

"This little monk has said all he intends to say."

Wei Xuanyin had long since understood the monk's allegory. His gaze drifted to the white snow filling the sky. After a long moment, he replied, "Xuanlou has been enlightened."

The black-robed monk smiled and waved his farewell. The two monks began their descent, stepping through the snow. Their figures shrank into two small black dots as they departed. Fachang finally let out a sigh of relief.

"So be it... so be it!"

Kongshu chuckled and shook his head.

"If you didn't let it be, you would be obstructing his Dao path."

Fachang, however, was unconvinced.

"Am I the only one? Never mind that King Wei is a qilin in chains, is Wei Xuanyin's life any easier? Before Yao Guanyi came out of seclusion, did you see the state he was in, being ordered around left and right? He will face plenty more predicaments like that in the future!"

Kongshu didn't argue. He just smiled.

"Do you know the origins of the Wei clan?"

Fachang said, "The Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao... Wei Guanyan, of course. It's just a pity he was born in that era. With Yin and Yang in chaos, he was doomed to fail."

The black-robed monk shook his head.

"Although the Wei family had fallen on hard times by Wei Guanyan's generation, they were still the Wei Clan of Chenchuan. They are descendants of _that_ True Monarch Guanhu. He was the second disciple of the Master of Comprehending Profoundity, and the master of Xu Che."

"Xu Che? The one who was a lazybones until he became a Woven Jade Immortal?"

Kongshu nodded, his expression serious.

"Xu Che was an old man who 'imbibed qi for ninety years, white-headed and haggard with tears,' yet He was able to teach him to become a Woven Jade Immortal. That alone shows His capability. And it was precisely because of Xu Che that all the cultivators in the world began to flock to the gates of Comprehending Profoundity..."

"Later, this True Monarch Guanhu returned his 'position' to Heaven and Earth and went seeking the Dao beyond the sky. He traveled until he reached a dim, unfathomable place. There, he thought of his descendants and erected a stone stele. Upon it, he inscribed: 'Land of Regret'."

"That stele, just like his Daoist temple, the Unmoving Temple, has remained fixed for eternity. From that day on, any great power seeking the Dao beyond the heavens can rest at that place. And if they realize their own inadequacy and feel regret, they can turn back."

"Incredible..." Fachang was silent for a long time. "I wonder what kind of spirit pills or immortal medicines exist beyond the heavens that make all these great figures strive for it, one after another."

Kongshu raised an eyebrow.

"I'm afraid only those who have reached the level of Fruition Attainment would understand that."

...

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Yin and Yang were in perfect balance, the light deep and somber.

Faint white qi flickered. On the jade throne, the man slowly exhaled a breath of white mist. His golden eyes brightened, filling the room with radiance.

'Much slower.'

Li Zhouwei's cultivation session had not been long. For a Purple Mansion Realm expert, a mere half-year was just a brief meditation, only enough to slightly consolidate this newly acquired divine ability. Yet he could clearly feel it: compared to Sovereign's Perilous Tread, his progress in cultivating Crimson Severing Arrowhead was slower by more than just one level.

'It's not just that Sovereign's Perilous Tread was blessed by fate and was highly compatible... it seems this new one is inherently different.'

Li Zhouwei could feel that the Crimson Severing Arrowhead divine ability within him disliked the spiritually balanced atmosphere of this place; it even faintly resisted it. While an overly dense spiritual influx was excellent for condensing an immortal foundation, it was not of great help in refining a divine ability.

Furthermore, the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, which had been so helpful for his first two divine abilities, showed almost no effect on this one. A thoughtful look passed through his eyes.

Normally, any spiritual atmosphere, as long as it approached a state of Yin-Yang balance, was broadly beneficial for cultivation. Whether for cultivating Jade True or refining True Qi, the boons to one's speed were immense.

Bright Yang was one of the 'Three Yangs', and his previous two divine abilities had been extremely active in this balanced atmosphere, allowing him to progress at incredible speed. This was the first time he had ever felt such resistance.

'Finding a grotto-heaven like this is already difficult. It would be more practical to find some medicinal pills... Besides... crossing the Purple Mystery is no easy task.'

He stood up and entered the High Firmament Pavilion. A quick check showed that the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method was now available. He retrieved the jade slip and began to carefully study its contents.

This method was different from Great Parting's White Brilliance. It did not require a wisp of Li Fire as its foundation. Instead, it was an art of 'life-mandate resonance', using one's own life-mandate to sense Li Fire. This meant that aside from the cultivator's personal progress, a large part of the spell art's power depended on the caster's own divine abilities.

'For every additional divine ability the caster possesses, this spell art gains a fraction more power. For a Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator, every extra Life Divine Ability they possess makes their life-mandate more balanced, making this art easier to advance.'

After all, one could have more than one Life Divine Ability. For his Bright Yang path, which only had a single one, this was not particularly advantageous. However, the relationship between Bright Yang and Li Fire was among the closest that existed, which served as a form of compensation.

This did not mean one could gain power without practicing the art. It simply meant the demand for external resources was far less. The fundamental source of power was oneself. If one could not thoroughly master the spell art and cultivate it diligently, it was useless, no matter how 'high' one's life-mandate was.

'It's not that it requires no resources at all... rather, the resources it _does_ require are far beyond the conventional. If I could obtain a Metallic Essence... cultivating this art would surely show progress of a thousand miles a day.'

Of course, someone with a unique life-mandate like Li Zhouwei was second only to a literal reincarnation of a Metallic Essence. He could not be judged by common standards. As he finished reading the overview, a strange feeling welled up within him.

'An art of life-mandate resonance... How peculiar. I've never seen one for Bright Yang.'

Stirred by this, he pressed his hand onto the bronze platform once more, causing the golden characters on the bamboo slips to float up, one after another. An unknown amount of time passed before he finally looked away, deep in thought.

The cultivation methods and spell arts in the High Firmament Pavilion were as vast as a sea of smoke. He could not possibly read them all, but from this small sample, he could glimpse the whole. In that short time, he had seen only five arts of life-mandate resonance:

'Dui Metal, Upright Wood, Pit Water, Li Fire, and Bound Earth.'

'This means that among such resonance arts, only Li Fire is compatible with Bright Yang... There is not a more suitable one. But... why these five? Is there something special about them?'

His current Dao-Profundity was already considerably high. He mused softly, "Li Fire's fierce assembly, holding fire's orthodox position... Dui Metal, the orthodox position of Shen-You metal... Jia-Yi Configuration, Upright Wood like stone..."

"As for Bound Earth, the Profound Peak Dao lineage also has a description: 'Uphold the orthodox, banish the deviant, command and adjust the mountains and rivers'..."

'These five 'virtues' must be connected... and it has something to do with the 'orthodox'.'

The understanding in his golden eyes grew clearer.

"The 'intercalary matching' must be the key! It is just that low-level cultivators cannot perceive it."

He lowered his head, pondering silently for a long time. An idea was already taking shape in his mind. Only then did he ascend to the pavilion's upper floor. As expected, he saw a pill furnace standing tall, blazing with fire. A man with regular features and striking ruby-red lips sat quietly within the flames.

It was Li Ximing's Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

'Grand-uncle's alchemy skill has improved immensely. To be this confident, he can let his alternate body work even when he's away from the grotto-heaven.'

He waited a short while, reading over the spell art's incantations. Just then, the real Li Ximing hurried in, his movement technique active. He paused in surprise, then smiled, casually withdrawing his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

"Perfect timing!"

He slapped the furnace. The flames trembled, and brilliant immortal light flared. The furnace lid flew open, and nine motes of light shot out, landing one by one in his palm. They were the size of pearls but had the appearance of multicolored, wing-flapping White Cicadas.

"Not bad at all."

Li Ximing always refined large batches. This one was also perfectly compatible with the Bright Yang path, so he had naturally refined a full set. He laughed and held them out.

"This is the Fading Sun Armour-Break Pill. It's said that 'the pill is a chariot, the form shifts a thousand li'. Thanks to Sima Yuanli, I've finally succeeded in refining it. I was just bringing it for you to see."

"This pill can be used to shift one's form to deliver a killing blow, or for escape. If taken during daily cultivation, it also has the auxiliary effect of harmonizing multiple, different divine abilities within the body. It's a bit unorthodox, but it has one interesting benefit: if a Demon beast consumes it, it has the effect of purifying its bloodline."

Li Zhouwei took one and examined it closely.

"It draws upon the Light of Karmic Dissolution and Pure Yin," he praised, "and merges it with the concept of the Yang Cusp's annihilation. The creator's methods were good, but their understanding of Bright Yang was not deep enough. They only grasped the surface, not the true interior."

"A step further would be to incorporate the 'fading sun' killing intent of Crimson Severing Arrowhead. And a step beyond that, one would have to grasp the original intent of the Yang Cusp, to create a 'thorn of perversion'."

"As for the bloodline purification..." Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment. "I suspect that's because the inversion of Bright Yang inherently carries the meaning of 'supplanting the honored'. It naturally has some effect on bloodlines. But the pill formula was not designed for that purpose, so even if the effect exists, it must be minimal."

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully.

"The creator of this formula, Cui E... was from ancient times. When he wrote this, the Wei Emperor might have still been alive. Even if he knew the inner principles, he probably would not have dared to write them down... The day he did, officials would have been knocking on his door."

"It's different now, though. Your guidance is crucial. Based on my Alchemy Dao, if I experiment a few more times, I should be able to create several variations."

Li Zhouwei chuckled. He took only one pill and slipped it into his sleeve. His expression turned serious.

"Grand-uncle, please look at this."

Li Ximing took the jade slip, read through the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method, and exclaimed in surprise,

"What a profound ancient spell art!"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"It is difficult, but its advantage is that it does not require resources. When Jiangqian comes out of seclusion, we can have him study it."

He voiced a slight concern, "I wonder how many Life Divine Abilities 『Li Fire』 has. I am not asking for as many as Pit Water, but I hope it is better than Bright Yang's single one. If it has two, it would be much simpler to use."

Pit Water was the Li family's foundational Dao lineage, and they had gained further understanding of it because of the Xiao family. Li Ximing knew this well. 

"That is not the urgent matter... There was something I wanted to ask you..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. The Daoist Master before him seemed anxious, pacing a few steps before he finally spoke.

"The Old Master's health... is already in some danger."

The words made Li Zhouwei turn his head, a sense of unease rising. He pinched his fingers, calculating.

"It is too soon."

Even at the same cultivation realm, lifespans could vary greatly. Chi Wei had lived a hundred years less than average, while Daoist Master Yuanxiu, Si Boxiu, had lived quite a bit longer. Those with divine abilities like Horn Wood or Valley Water also tended to live longer...

He asked, "Is it his lifespan?"

Li Ximing shook his head.

"Not entirely. The Old Master sustained many injuries in his youth, and a large portion of them damaged his foundation. In Purple Mansion Realm terms, they damaged his 'nature' or his 'life'. He has been recuperating well all these years, so nothing seemed wrong. But as his natural lifespan approaches its end, all that old damage to his life-mandate is beginning to surface..."

"I was thinking... we do not lack for spiritual resources. I want to find that Horn Wood Daoist Master, or perhaps Daoist Master Xiang Chun. We could use one of their divine abilities, trade them something, and I could refine a pill... In short, I want to try, without telling the Old Master. I cannot say how much it will extend his life, but at least it might make him more comfortable..."

(End of chapter)




# Chapter 1118: The West

"This is a critical matter."

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly.

"The number of disciples on the lake has grown over the years. With Mount Qingdu managing them, things won't be too bad. The only fear is that they aren't close. As long as the Old Master is here, the four branches will always have a measure of harmony and tolerance..."

Hearing this, Li Ximing grew melancholic. Standing in the pavilion, he lowered his gaze and said,

"Although I've cultivated to the Purple Mansion Realm, my descendants are few. On the lake, far more people fear me than feel close to me. Grandfather can persuade and smooth over any matter, but none of it ever reaches my ears. If something truly happens to the old man..."

This was the unbridgeable chasm between a cultivator with a divine ability and a mortal. To a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, even a noble Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was merely an ant that could be extinguished with a single breath. No matter how much Li Ximing cared for the clan, it was difficult to genuinely invest himself in the teeming masses of juniors. Even when one of them successfully refined Qi or reached the Foundation Establishment Realm and was presented to him, he would, at most, offer a word of casual praise.

Even his own grandson, Li Zhouming, who was also a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, had pitifully few opportunities to meet with him. But Li Xuanxuan was different; he held them in his heart and doted on them. Every time someone achieved a breakthrough, he would summon them, look them over, and speak heartfelt, intimate words. This was something Li Ximing was utterly incapable of doing.

The Daoist Master stood with his hands clasped behind him for a moment before speaking with genuine conviction.

"The Li family stands strong today because of the Old Master's countless contributions, which no one can replicate! I am thinking... if it truly comes to that, I would not hesitate to use this pill in my hand, even if it only saves Grandfather for three to five years!"

The pill he spoke of was the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill, entrusted to him by Tinglan years ago. It was exceptionally precious, formed from the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness, and possessed the miraculous efficacy of reviving the dead and regenerating flesh on bare bones. Taking it could also extend one's lifespan.

Logically, even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would covet such a pill. A few years of life for a Purple Mansion Realm expert could change many things; it absolutely should not be wasted on someone merely at the Qi Refining level. Li Zhouwei, however, was not surprised.

"Curing injuries is nothing special," he said. "The Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill is precious because it elevates one's immortal foundation. Our family's cultivation arts are complete and our Dao Lineage is precious, with no unorthodox or flawed methods. Therefore, this is its only remaining use. It is fitting to retrieve it."

Li Ximing understood he was being comforted. He merely nodded silently and replied,

"First, we will try the usual life-extending remedies. I will go find that 'Horn Wood' elder, Daoist Master Shanbai. I'll invite him to the lake to draft a conditioning formula first."

Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement.

"It is inconvenient for Daoist Master Xiang Chun to come to the mainland. It would be better to arrange this at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. I must ask Grand-uncle to find a reason to invite the Old Master out to the Eastern Sea. Take the pill there, and ask both of them to examine it and jointly create the formula."

This was an undeniably impressive lineup of experts. Li Ximing finally relaxed. 

"That's simple enough. The old man has never been to the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. Although he doesn't say so, with Li Wen and An Siwei both there, he still worries about them. We'll just say we are taking him for a visit."

The two finalized the plan, both feeling a sense of sorrow. Li Xuanxuan's cultivation was too low; his body lacked the foundation to withstand many remedies. Even if his life was extended, it wouldn't be for long. At the Qi Refining stage, even the method involving Daoist Master Xuanyi's artifact spirit was impossible... And even if it were possible, they still had to consider the Talisman Seed within the old man's body.

They fell silent for a moment. Li Ximing quickly changed the subject, recounting the events at Mount Qusi.

"A major event occurred while you were in seclusion. The Western Shu suffered a heavy loss on the Great Western Plateau. Even figures like Qing Jifang were injured... and a Daoist Master has fallen. When it rains, it pours... Qize has also become unstable."

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei asked with interest. He listened as Li Ximing continued with a hint of schadenfreude.

"In Qize, there is a Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal... Do you remember him?"

Seeing the golden-eyed youth nod, Li Ximing smiled.

"This Sword Immortal is at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm and has been stuck at the threshold of the Purple Mystery for a long time. It seems he has finally made progress. Once he breaks through, he will be a figure capable of influencing the entire world... The Qing clan has always been careful to stay on his good side..."

"But who knows what trouble they stirred up. The Shu State has been plagued by disturbances. In a place called Xunyang Pool, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator appeared, claiming his surname was Xu. Wielding Sword Intent, he announced he was there for revenge. He stirred up roiling golden qi in the sky and took the head of the local County Governor... It was a blatant provocation against the Qing clan's authority. A Purple Mansion Realm expert from the Shangguan family rushed to the scene and they fought for hours, only to suddenly disengage. It was only later we learned that it was the cultivator backing the Xu-surnamed expert who intervened..."

"The incident caused a huge sensation but ultimately fizzled out. However, rumors are spreading everywhere that the one who intervened was the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal."

Li Zhouwei frowned as Li Ximing sighed.

"The Shu lands are famous for their sword cultivators; their Sword Immortals were once the greatest of all provinces. They have fallen into decline in recent years, leaving only the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal. It's not surprising that another has now appeared."

Li Zhouwei, however, suddenly recalled the Sword Immortal he had briefly glimpsed within the grotto-heaven.

'He wore the attire of the Shu lands,' he mused, 'and possessed the Metal Virtue. It might very well be him.'

Li Ximing seemed hesitant.

"I paid close attention to this news, particularly the name... Xunyang Pool."

This made Li Zhouwei raise his eyebrows. He listened as Li Ximing continued,

"I heard Daoist Master Guansue fell at Xunyang Pool... and back then, Daoist Master Donghua's Immortal Sword was also lost there. Now, two Sword Immortals have clashed in that very place. Could these events be related?"

Li Zhouwei understood at once. Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun, was strongly suspected of being a figure from the heavens. Naturally, Li Ximing would scrutinize any information related to him. He pondered for a moment before replying,

"It is an excellent thing that the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal cannot be used by the Qing clan. Otherwise, the price of attacking Shu in the future would increase tenfold... As for Xunyang Pool... we will have to attack Shu sooner or later. I should go there personally."

Li Ximing nodded discreetly, then said,

"This is just news for now... During the days of your seclusion, I have not been idle. Using the pretext of the Heavenly Nurture Urn, I've gathered a great deal of information and found a suitable sacrifice for the Azure Talisman!"

"While the situation between the north and south is temporarily stable, we must arrange this. I fear that once the wars begin again, this will be endlessly delayed."

This piqued Li Zhouwei's interest. He raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"That couldn't have been easy to find!"

Li Ximing shook his head helplessly.

"The first place I considered was the Southern Borderlands."

"That Bifeng Mountain Lord has a natural enmity with our family, making him an excellent target. He even has an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Demon King under his command... The problem is, the Bifeng Mountain Lord never leaves the Southern Borderlands, and his Demon King doesn't stray far either. If we try to suppress him in the Southern Borderlands, it will inevitably draw out Can Lufu."

"If we were extremely lucky and one of them happened to leave the Southern Borderlands, we could capture him in the Eastern Sea. That would solve the Azure Talisman's needs. But it would also alert the Bifeng Mountain Lord, making any future plots against him incredibly difficult."

He said grimly, "Relying on luck is never a sound strategy. Perhaps we could lure him out, but I've placed the Bifeng line as the last resort... It would be best to resolve this elsewhere."

"Furthermore, most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the world have both power and backing. I've asked around carefully, and it's a thorny issue. We can forget about the ones controlled by the Dragon-kin, and there's no need to even consider the Northern Sea. The only places we might be able to make a move are the Southern Borderlands, Poluoduo, and the Western Sea."

A trace of melancholy crossed the Daoist Master's face.

"There's another problem. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are not minor figures. Even if they lack a powerful background or overwhelming strength, they always have a friend or two, or are backed by some power... They are not people one can simply attack at will."

Li Zhouwei frowned as Li Ximing continued.

"For example, there is a white elephant in the Southern Sea that cultivates Baleful Qi. Few pay him any mind, but his ancestors had connections to the Buddhist cultivators. The Mahas of the Southern Sea all know of him, and he has several friends of his own. If we were to travel all that way to kill him for no reason, it would be impossible to justify, emotionally or rationally. Someone would certainly intervene, and it might even destroy our reputation."

"Poluoduo is the same."

"In other words, while these Purple Mansion Realm experts may lack a formal background, their network and their divine abilities _are_ their background. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator relies on their personal divine ability; they are anything but ordinary. Even a Golden Core-level power wouldn't casually kill one without a major conflict of interest."

"Furthermore, if the target were to escape, any friends or family they have... would only lead to more trouble."

His words sent Li Zhouwei into deep thought. He finally replied, "What about a Merciful One?"

Li Ximing nodded at once.

"I had the same thought. A Purple Mansion Realm expert is hard to find, but a Merciful One is easier. The one we are most familiar with is at the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour. We already have an enmity with them, so killing two of their peacocks in our own interest would be perfectly reasonable..."

But he gave a bitter smile.

"Unfortunately, something strange happened. The Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour lost two peacocks in succession a few years ago. Both died unnatural deaths, and the cause couldn't even be investigated. It nearly left the temple's master completely alone, which made the Way of Great Desire extremely dissatisfied. It will be very difficult to make a move on the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour now."

Li Ximing lowered his voice.

"I asked Sima Yuanli. After careful thought, he said there is a demon beast temple in the Western Sea that we could try. But it presents its own set of problems... namely, we would be offending people."

"I tested the waters. If we decide to go to the Western Sea, Guo Nanwu can be persuaded by calling in a favor. But people like Sima Yuanli are unwilling to go. They have no grievance or enmity with that power, and they won't proactively offend them just because we need to refine a Spiritual Artifact... They might even see us as greedy and reckless, and offer words of caution."

Li Zhouwei was about to speak, but Li Ximing quickly continued,

"There is one other method: relying on the conflict between the north and south. The problem is, not many Buddhist cultivators have mounts, and even fewer are willing to bring them south. I had Guo Nanwu make a trip to Yinzhou Island and entrust the Daoist Master there to ask around. The Way of Great Desire has a newly promoted Maha named Bashan. Due to his promotion, his mount has also become a Merciful One. It could be a target."

This made Li Zhouwei's eyes light up. He silently calculated the pros and cons for a long time before speaking.

"In terms of convenience, using the North-South conflict is both reasonable and justifiable. But we would have to wait for some time, and there's no guarantee we could even capture that Merciful One..."

"Since Jiangqian and Que'wan's seclusions are close together, let's use the next few years to take care of that demon beast in the Western Sea. We'll secure one sacrifice first. Then, when the north and south begin to fight, we will try our best to capture the other one as well. It will be useful eventually."

"If these two matters are handled properly, our family won't need another Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast for a while. The only one remaining is Jiangchun... His spell art is difficult, and we haven't secured the secret method for him yet. We can afford to wait a bit on his account."

They exchanged a look, and Li Ximing understood Li Zhouwei's meaning.

'Our family has the Talisman Seed to aid them and break through their ignorance. They don't need to wait all those years. This means the breakthrough time for both children is tied directly to their personal Dao-Profundity and the difficulty of their cultivation arts. Que'wan's cultivation art is much more difficult, but given her Dao-Profundity, she won't be that much slower... We truly must consider them together.'

Li Ximing nodded.

Li Zhouwei mused, "We must try to handle this cleanly and not alert the target. As it happens, there is the matter of the Wall-Sinking Water. I'll have to trouble Grand-uncle to make a trip to the Western Sea to deal with it. You can inquire about the local situation at the same time. It's two birds with one stone."

"This junior recalls that the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron has the 'Renew' ability, which we have never had a use for. The Water Mansion is in the west, and Pit Water is in the north. Grand-uncle can use this as a pretext for the visit, which might also earn us some local favors. You can say you are refining a spiritual water... If it succeeds, it will be another boon."

Li Zhouwei, having settled the matter, began to ponder.

"As for Sima Yuanli... whether he joins the fight is irrelevant, as long as he is willing to lend us that Spiritual Treasure."

Li Ximing smiled.

"He treasures that thing! He doesn't even dare show it in my presence!"

Hearing this joke, a faint smile touched the golden-eyed King Wei's expression. 

"No matter. I will ask him personally."

...

The rain and snow began to subside.

Inside the cave-dwelling, a green lamp flickered. Scrolls large and small were piled high on the stone platform and the floor. A youth in white robes stood among them, his brows tightly knit in thought.

'If I had known...' he thought, 'I would have memorized a few more spell arts...'

Compared to his first life, Li Suining's second life had not lasted long, and events had developed with shocking suddenness. It was nothing like the first life's long wandering to the Southern Borderlands... but that didn't mean Moongaze Lake was at peace.

'Constructing the Mystic Realm... it consumes a vast amount of resources...'

In his previous life, Li Zhouwei had given him the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence and the method for constructing the Mystic Realm. Li Suining had been stunned when he read it, treating it as a supreme treasure that could bring about great change. But the spiritual materials required to build the Great Void's Profound Foundation were simply astronomical.

'This grotto-heaven method nearly exhausted the energy and resources of three generations. The sheer variety of ratios and the rate of consumption... even if we poured in everything left over from the Changxiao Gate, it wouldn't be nearly enough... And to make matters worse, Chengyun surrendered, so we can't plunder it...'

What he had to do now was write down every detail of his experience from his past life regarding the construction of this mystic realm, to prepare for what was to come.

'The Profound Foundation's formation structure and the ratios of spiritual materials are incredibly complex, with several thousand types that must be matched. Fortunately, as a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, I can recall them all one by one, and I can deduce the rest by visualizing the materials. That's the secondary part. The most important thing is the Great Void's anchor points that Aunt Que'wan spent two years calculating!'

He was writing silently when he heard a sound at the cave-dwelling's entrance.

"Knock, knock..."

Li Suining frowned and looked up, only to see a young man in black robes walking slowly inside. Startled, Li Suining shot to his feet and bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Your Majesty!"

In truth, seeing King Wei at this moment, Li Suining's heart filled with a profound sorrow, and even more, the shame of having betrayed his trust. He shut his eyes tightly, his voice catching in his throat.

Li Zhouwei simply sat down at a nearby desk, his gaze sweeping over the scrolls piled everywhere. He didn't ask about them, only smiled.

"You've been in seclusion for quite a while. The Old Master has been asking about you."

Li Suining felt a pang of guilt and hurriedly bowed again.

"I... I lost track of time. Fortunately, the gains were not small!"

King Wei smiled, still not asking about his work. He stood with his hands behind his back, raised an eyebrow, and said,

"This King and Daoist Master Zhaojing have a plan in the Western Sea... but we are concerned about a potential ambush, which gives us pause. I came here specifically to ask your opinion."




# Chapter 1119 The Pear Garden

'Western Sea...'

Li Suining was no stranger to this name; he even felt a sense of dissociation.

In his second life, Li Zhouwei had also come to ask him. But at that time, Li Suining hadn't been unconscious for a year. He had already met with Li Xuanxuan and dealt with the affairs of the West Bank. When King Wei came asking, Li Suining had been truly embarrassed.

Because in his first life, Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing had never gone to the Western Sea at all. If anything, it was only Li Ximing who had suffered a major setback there in the early days and, by a twist of fate, failed to make the trip. Li Zhouwei had not slain Vast Cicada and was, at that time, still recovering from his injuries.

The situation now, however, was completely different.

He had considered it carefully at the time and ultimately gave his approval.

'Western Shu and Xiangxiong Kingdom are locked in a fierce battle. The Western Sea, Poluoduo, even the Land of Long and Moxi are all stirring. There is turmoil everywhere, but also opportunities to profit from the chaos.'

Thus, to acquire the Wall-Sinking Water, Li Ximing and his companion had gone to the Western Sea. Although the Li Suining of that time did not yet possess a Cave-Heaven and only held Li Zhouwei's trust, he knew none of the details. However, he had never heard of Li Zhouwei or the others suffering any injuries.

'With the current combined strength of Daoist Master Zhaojing and King Wei, it's not enough to run rampant on the mainland, which is teeming with prodigies. But in that remote place, there truly aren't many who could afford to provoke them!'

After all, the Western Sea was not large, and navigating the winds there was difficult. It was never a place suited for the younger generation to cultivate, only marginally better than the outer seas. What kinds of people holed up in the Western Sea? Either they were of the Yangya ilk—figures with no heart for seeking the Dao and no inclination toward a sect, who only dreamed of closing their doors to become local tyrants—or they were of the Qingyan ilk—cultivators who had offended powerful figures, practiced forbidden arts, and dared not show their faces outside.

As for the lower-level cultivators, they were few and far between, mostly demonic cultivators.

In other words, Li Suining could tell Li Zhouwei with full confidence this time, that the outcome of the Western Sea trip would be good!

Not only that, but many years later, Li Suining had seen Li Que'wan in the mystic realm, using Profound Coffin Crimson Water to practice her spell arts and suppress her injuries. He once heard her lament,

'This water was refined by the Daoist Master in the Western Sea. It's just a pity I was still in seclusion and couldn't assist. We were short one part of Treasured Earth to harmonize the water and wood. If we'd had that one part of Treasured Earth, I could have corrected this... But it's a pity... the foundation is ruined.'

Li Suining asked at the time,

'Refined in the Western Sea... was it using the Piting Qingyuan Treasure Cauldron in Aunt's hand?'

Li Que'wan nodded.

'That Rogue Cultivator Yinqin is despicable. He took a spiritual ingredient back, promising the Shore-Manifesting White Flower, but to this day, he's only sent back a single flower. He claims the spiritual aura has changed and he needs to settle accounts... If he can't be clear about it, we might as well just chop down that spiritual root!'

Li Suining had some understanding of this latter matter. It was an old agreement with a Western Sea cultivator. But later, the spiritual aura in the Western Sea supposedly changed. The man began making excuses and stopped sending the deliveries to the lake. It was impossible to know if he was telling the truth. By that time, the conflict between the North and South had grown taut as a bowstring, and no one had the spare energy to deal with a cultivator from the Western Sea.

'Perhaps that rogue cultivator saw that the family lacked the power to go to the Western Sea and demand it... That's why he was hemming and hawing, making excuses, and not sending anyone.'

He carefully sorted through his thoughts and replied,

"This venture is highly auspicious. It is only lacking earth. Judging from the divine mystery, it must involve the refining of a spiritual item. It would be best to add one part of Treasured Earth to the process."

Li Zhouwei's expression grew thoughtful as he heard the precision of the reply. 

"One part of Treasured Earth..."

Li Suining instantly caught his meaning. He immediately regretted not having asked Li Que'wan exactly how much "one part of Treasured Earth" was.

'It seems I'll have to ask about every detail from now on... so I won't be put in such an awkward position again...'

Li Zhouwei, however, quickly grasped the point.

"I understand. So there's such a calculation involved, it's not just a matter of throwing in spiritual items. How about this... If any refining needs to be done, we'll postpone it if we can, preferably until Que'Wan comes out of seclusion. If it truly cannot be delayed, I will carefully consider adding some Treasured Earth."

Li Suining's eyes lit up. While moving aside the clan scrolls on his desk, he picked up the teapot to serve him.

"That is the first matter. The second should involve the division of a spiritual root. There is a risk of complications from a change in the spiritual aura. I hope the Daoist Master can settle things in one go. At worst, it might be a bit wasteful... but just cut it down for the materials."

"Good."

The light in Li Zhouwei's eyes grew sharper. He accepted the tea, nodded slightly, and after a long moment, spoke.

"The Heavenly Element's ability is truly remarkable. No wonder Senior Changdie was able to thrive as a mere rogue cultivator all those years ago..."

"I cannot compare to Senior..."

Li Suining could only lower his head, his heart a knot of complexity. But he saw Li Zhouwei staring at him, his golden eyes glittering.

"You are injured?"

How sharp were Li Zhouwei's eyes! With a single glance, he had seen that Li Suining's foundation was damaged and his lifespan was diminished. This was no trivial matter!

For those in the Purple Mansion Realm, this was a matter of one's life-mandate. For cultivators below that realm, the term 'foundation' was more familiar. Such an injury usually occurred when escaping a battle of life and death, or after suffering some other catastrophic blow. Once it appeared, it was not only difficult to mend but would very likely impact all future cultivation and breakthroughs!

The injury Li Xuanxuan had suffered at the market back then had damaged his lifespan, causing endless harm. But the sight on Li Suining now was even stranger. To Li Zhouwei, it looked more like he had lost a significant amount of life-span, but the greater price his body should have paid seemed to have been covered by the favor of the Heavenly Element within him.

The loss of life-span was severe and irreversible. For practitioners of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao, there was basically no cure—unless one surrendered their True Spirit to the Buddhist Land, became a vassal, and converted to another path. Only a few, rare divine abilities could increase it, and even those were exceedingly scarce.

'Although it's serious, at least it won't greatly impact his cultivation... I wonder if Senior Changdie had such an injury. But seeing as he was able to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm... if he did, it must have been this type, with minimal impact...'

A hundred thoughts spun through Li Zhouwei's mind in that short moment. Li Suining, hearing the question, was stunned at first. He then recalled the blood he had spat upon waking and quickly shook his head with a forced smile.

"It's not really an injury! Just a small mishap during cultivation..."

What kind of "mishap" could damage one's life-mandate and shorten one's lifespan?

Li Zhouwei frowned. He quickly connected this to Li Suining's year-long seclusion and the natural way he had just mentioned Liu Changdie. An answer formed in his mind.

'When I asked him about the Heavenly Element back then, he was completely oblivious. Now, he acts like an expert...'

But Li Zhouwei did not expose him. Instead, he said in a low voice,

"Do not be impatient for quick results. This... must be taken slowly."

Li Suining's heart trembled. Staring into those golden eyes, he was at a loss for how to reply. Li Zhouwei's tone carried an inexplicable undercurrent as he smiled.

"The 'Heaven–Governing' path is Heaven's calculation. You and I, we are Man's calculation. We will have to test it to see which is superior."

...

The night was deep, but the courtyard was utterly silent. A mournful aria rose and fell, its lingering notes coiling around the beams, seeming to never end.

"A family's blood, a year of hate—I knock on every ancestral gate, why is there no reply? Can it be the stars and moon were all in vain... The loyal die, the treacherous remain. I trace the karmic chain... and find only dark water swallowing the prison door!"

In the Pear Garden, the audience stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. Outside the courtyard, however, flames flickered. Medicine boiled over a roaring stove. Beside it, an old man, though his hair and beard were silver, remained robust. He gently waved a fan, waiting. When the time was right, he added medicinal pills. He poured the concoction out in three batches, let it cool, and carried the tray upstairs.

"Hilarious! Hilarious! Before the ancestral stones, before the ancestral stones... a land up in smoke! I've roamed every mountain and ridge, only to earn sleepless night after sleepless night..."

The dharma lamp in the attic was even dimmer. There were few spectators; only a single table was placed by the railing, a man slumped over it. Beside the railing stood a young master. Several opera robes hung on the wall, their dark red cuffs fluttering in the breeze. The old man carried the tray and said,

"Old Ancestor..."

Only then did the man at the table shift his gaze from the stage below. His hair and beard were stark white, almost withered.

"Shuya... just set it down."

"Yes."

Li Xuanxuan's turbid old eyes glanced at him.

"Let the servants handle these things. You're getting old. Don't trouble yourself."

Li Shuya was Li Que'wan's elder brother. He had been sent to serve Li Xuanxuan decades ago due to some past turmoil. In the blink of an eye, the young man had become an old one, yet he remained as meticulous as ever.

Li Shuya was a direct witness to the old man's declining health. He glanced at the cup and stood waiting silently to the side.

Li Xuanxuan had no choice but to lift the cup. He drank it down hastily, set his manuscript aside, and said,

"No matter how good these pills are, they have their limits. They aren't doing much good anymore. Report to Jiangzong. Tell him not to send any more."

"Yes."

Li Shuya silently carried the cup out. A moment later, rising above the faint, lingering opera song, came the stubborn sound of medicine being boiled outside, the clink of the porcelain stove. Li Xuanxuan could only sigh, his gaze falling quietly on the opera costume hanging in the room.

This robe was entirely crimson, embroidered with flowing gold thread, and paired with a colorful crown. In the Pear Garden, an actor wearing this costume usually represented the ruler of the Li family. Sometimes, they would also carry a bow and sword, as seen in the recent tragedy of the Jiang and Yu families, _The Recent Usurpation_, or the story of the Li family's rise, _Expelling the Vicious_.

'After all, in recent years, Jiangzong, Jiangqian, and Jianglong have all used a unified Family Head system. It's not surprising this custom exists...'

Ever since that year's Lament for the Fleeting River, Li Xuanxuan had made a point to attend every new play that appeared among the common folk. This current play, The Recent Usurpation, was a tragedy. For its costume to also be hanging on the wall meant something more—this play had been personally composed by a direct descendant of the Li family.

It was none other than the profligate young master standing by the railing with his hands clasped behind him, the one who had yet to utter a single word.

Li Zhouming.

Li Xuanxuan always made time to see the juniors. It was no secret his health was failing. Many felt pity, some were even overcome with grief, but only this profligate young master visited one day, accompanied him the next, traveled with him, ate with him—behaving as if he would never leave his side.

He held an extremely simple bamboo tube. Inside were finger-width tokens of various sizes, inscribed with the names of different plays, one after another. They looked especially rustic in the faint light.

As the music swelled, Li Zhouming turned his head. He was startled to find that, in the shadows, a Daoist Master had appeared beside him, the Heavenly Light between his brows shining brilliantly.

Li Ximing, however, simply waved his hand, his gaze fixed on the actor on the stage below.

"Look! Look! His sad tears cross the foul river, he kills wantonly, yet dares to speak of brotherly blood! He lingers here, he lingers there... It turns out he killed his brother—to teach his younger brother treachery!"

Making a show of weeping, the actor playing the young master of the Jiang family—with two short, flimsy flags on his back to signify his low cultivation—was quickly carried off the stage. This marked the end of the first act.

The music slowly faded. The old man had already risen from his seat.

"Daoist Master, you've come."

Li Xuanxuan always called him Daoist Master. It wasn't a sign of distance; it was a sign of pride. Li Ximing had grown used to it over the years. He smiled. 

"Seeing Grandfather enjoying such refined leisure, Grandson feels more at ease."

Li Xuanxuan just shook his head and sighed.

"The situation is urgent. You mustn't worry about me. I've lived this long; how could I not know how to take care of myself?"

The old man's gaze was laced with concern.

"But for the Daoist Master to come seeking me so late at night... I wonder what the matter is."

Li Ximing smiled, his eyes sweeping over the crimson robe on the wall. 

"Grandfather misunderstands. Grandson is going on a trip to the Eastern Sea. It is nothing urgent. I simply received a letter from Senior Liu and wanted to bring Grandfather along to meet him. You can also see the An family and the Li family members on the island... They miss you dearly."

The old man hesitated.

"This..."

Just then, Li Zhouming strode over and affectionately took the old man's hand. 

"Old Master, weren't you just mentioning Senior Liu the other day? He has already achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, but he cannot come to the lake. He must miss you terribly."

Li Xuanxuan sighed and smiled.

"I'm just afraid of making a fuss and troubling the Daoist Master."

Li Ximing shook his head and waved his hand slightly. A streak of green light leaped from his sleeve, landing and transforming into a page-boy with clear, bright features. He warmly helped the old man up. "Old Master, do you remember me?"

Most old men have a fondness for such child-like figures. Li Xuanxuan only needed two glances before he broke into a laugh.

"The Shi'er tree has attained the Dao, and to think it's so mischievous!"

Li Ximing couldn't help but smile. With a flick of his sleeve, a thick darkness enveloped them. In an instant, they flew into the Great Void, speeding away. Once the old man was settled, he let out a long sigh.

"Changdie is a capable man."

Li Ximing smiled but said nothing. His expression was somewhat peculiar.

"Master has taken an interest in short plays recently... I heard Zhouwei mention it once... something called Lament for the Fleeting River..."

The old man's smile faded slightly, as if he were preoccupied. Li Ximing continued naturally,

"I went to listen to it once in private. The actors at the Pear Garden are quite good. In the audience, some were sighing, some were sympathetic, some were angry. But in this Grandson's opinion... the tune is a bit too tragic."

Li Xuanxuan was silent, staring intently at this grandson who had long since shed his mortal flesh and become a Daoist Master. He listened as Li Ximing continued softly,

"Ming'er may seem idle, and his mind isn't on proper business, but he is actually very sharp. Even if Grandfather says nothing, he can guess much of it. What's more... I heard he was the one who originally arranged the music for that Lament for the Fleeting River. Now that the words and music no longer match, how could he not know?"

Li Xuanxuan remained silent, listening as Li Ximing said,

"And... this play. Grandson believes it should not be allowed to spread too far. Que'Wan is one thing, but Jiangqian is a deeply suspicious man. I fear this will stir up trouble."

The old man said, "I understand."

Silence reigned in the Great Void, filled only with an empty echo. After an unknown amount of time, the Daoist Master slowly averted his gaze. He closed his eyes tightly, his lips moving, but no sound emerged:

'A single point of transcendence is the truest.'




# Chapter 1120: The Lifeless Marshland

The immortal's cave vibrated with brilliant colors. In its center sat a man, array diagram in hand, brow furrowed in thought. A long time passed before he finally looked up, releasing a heavy sigh.

Liu Changdie rarely left the island, and his days were tranquil. With no further path to walk in his cultivation, his mind was consumed by Dao-Profundity and the Dao of arrays. It was, in truth, a life of reclusive contemplation.

Any resentment he once felt about his inability to advance had long since faded away.

'It's not so much that I've accepted my fate... It's more that reaching this realm in one lifetime is already worth it.'

He suddenly sensed something. Pinching his fingers in a quick calculation, his eyes lit up. He rose from his position, blurred out of the cave, and looked west. A swath of azure clouds drifted ethereally toward him, landing before the island to reveal an old Daoist Master.

Liu Changdie felt a flush of embarrassment and quickly bowed his head.

"Greetings, old senior!"

The old man simply nodded, a faint smile on his lips.

This was the elder Daoist Master Shanbai, known for his kindness and charity. He was a 'Horn Wood' Daoist Master at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. Cultivators traversing the region always showed him a measure of respect. His sect was situated by the sea, and he had remained completely untouched by the great conflict between north and south.

Daoist Master Shanbai did not seem to find Liu Changdie a stranger. He cupped his hands and smiled.

"Karmic affinity truly follows us. Daoist friend, you have also reached the Purple Mansion Realm! It seems the Four Constant Wood was not given to the wrong person after all!"

Liu Changdie's embarrassment deepened. Back when his cultivation was low, he had relied on memories from his past life, knowing that a rogue cultivator had once saved an old man on an island in the Eastern Sea and received a treasure. He had played the part of the patient farmer, waiting by the stump, and snatched the opportunity for himself.

The problem was, the karmic gift he'd received should have been of the 'Returning Earth', but it had manifested as Wood Virtue. He had been confused at the time, assuming the old man had simply acted on a whim.

Now, of course, he understood the truth. This Daoist Master Shanbai had come down the mountain to manifest his grace for a specific, chosen person. Liu Changdie had merely intercepted it. He bowed deeply, mortified.

"Senior, I have truly made a fool of myself. I can only hope I did not disrupt your greater plans!"

Daoist Master Shanbai shook his head, his smile gentle.

"It was nothing so grand. I merely saw the blood descendant of an old acquaintance and offered a hand. I had his junior bring a spiritual item back to him, hoping to help him break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Alas, he was overwhelmed by the spiritual infusion and perished. I never learned if he managed to use the item in the end. Whether you were there or not, Daoist friend, it made no difference to the outcome."

Liu Changdie could only nod. Just as their conversation paused, the northern sky filled with mist and rain. A chariot pulled by massive crabs and drawn by a Flood Dragon emerged, revealing a woman within.

The woman was dressed in a white Daoist robe, her beauty clear and refined. She stopped her conveyance gracefully before the island. Liu Changdie stepped forward and bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Daoist Master Xiang Chun returned the courtesy.

"I have come as requested. You are too polite, Daoist friend."

Liu Changdie knew exactly what "requested" meant; he had long anticipated this day. In his previous life, he had never even met Li Xuanxuan. The old man had died tragically, far, far too early, seemingly lost during a demonic calamity.

'He must have dodged that fated death,' Liu Changdie thought. 'All these years, he must have been sustained by spiritual items to have lasted until today. But with Yuanjiao gone, it falls to me to protect his father.'

Liu Changdie led her to a seat in the pavilion. Daoist Master Shanbai, having spent many years in the Eastern Sea, was acquainted with the Daoist Master and greeted her casually. Liu Changdie, ever polite, had tea served.

"The old man is not only an elder of King Wei," he said, "but also Yuanbian's benefactor. We have troubled you to come all this way, Daoist Master. If you require anything at all, you need only to command."

"I would not dare call it a command," Daoist Master Xiang Chun replied with a nod.

The three Daoist Masters looked up in unison as the Great Void rippled. Li Ximing emerged in a streak of light, bowing to each of them in turn.

"I apologize for troubling you all!"

Behind him, Li Xuanxuan was utterly dumbfounded. He stared blankly, a thousand emotions caught in his throat.

His affliction was a fundamental decay of his foundation—incurable, irreversible. In any other family, or even in his own just a few decades prior, he would have simply been kept comfortable to live out his final days, waiting for the end.

Yet here, three Daoist Masters had gathered for him. Including Li Ximing who had brought him, four great Daoist Masters were bustling about for his sake—for his worthless, broken body!

Li Xuanxuan had never thought of himself as anyone significant. In his day, low-level cultivators in the markets fell like weeds; countless talents perished young in battle. If not for his capable juniors sparing him the need to fight for his life, and a sliver of meager luck... how could he still be breathing? He had lived more than long enough.

Li Ximing had insisted he come, and Li Xuanxuan had only agreed to set the young man's mind at ease. Now, his eyes reddened, and his heart trembled.

'This wretched body... how could I be worthy of this?'

Everyone present was a Purple Mansion Realm expert; they could read the situation as clear as day and naturally sensed the old man's turmoil. Daoist Master Xiang Chun retrieved a talisman from her sleeve, her expression softening with emotion.

"When this letter reached the Dragon Palace, Heyun read it first. He made a special trip to the Thunder Pool, and only then did we learn that the old master is also the Thunder Maiden's great-uncle. Publicly or privately, this is no small matter."

A flicker of hope ignited in Li Xuanxuan's eyes.

"I haven't seen Qinghong in so many years..."

Li Ximing turned his head away, his expression unreadable. Daoist Master Xiang Chun, meanwhile, began to prepare the Valley Water. The talisman in her hand swayed as she spoke softly.

"The Thunder Pool contains the deepest secrets of thunder-devouring. It requires a guardian, and its mysteries cannot be exposed. It cannot be left unattended."

The old man nodded, again and again. Seeing Daoist Master Xiang Chun explain this to him personally, Daoist Master Shanbai, who stood to the side, was inwardly reeling.

'No wonder they've mobilized such forces... This is an intervention on par with healing another clan's Daoist Master. So _that's_ who this old ancestor is...'

Daoist Master Xiang Chun shifted the talisman. A gentle, dark light flowed from it, instantly calming the old man's agitated mind. He closed his eyes as she began to form a divine ability in her hands. Daoist Master Shanbai reached out and placed his fingers on the old man's wrist to read his pulse. Silence fell over the pavilion.

A long moment passed before Daoist Master Xiang Chun opened her eyes, meeting Liu Changdie's anxious gaze. She exchanged a glance with Daoist Master Shanbai, then spoke first.

"The old man's core problem is, indeed, the exhaustion of his lifespan. Though he suffered severe injuries in middle age that cost him a decade of life, he was fortunate to recuperate well in his later years. He did not let the damage spread and even managed to nourish his foundation. That he has lasted until today is a testament to his efforts."

She continued, "I sense a golden pill within him, likely a method from the Hengzhu Dao Lineage. It is used to calm the mind and disperse heart-demons. The Hengzhu methods are known for their uncanny efficacy, and this has been a great help to him. Without this art, his body would have given out long ago."

Li Ximing nodded gravely. The old man wiped a tear, his thoughts drifting to Li Xijun. The two Daoist Masters fell silent. Li Ximing considered the atmosphere and said,

"Grandfather, you haven't seen Senior Liu in a long time. Why don't you go and catch up?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded silently and allowed Liu Changdie to help him from the pavilion.

Once they were gone, Daoist Master Shanbai nodded and took over the conversation.

"This matter of lifespan... ever since Wood Virtue declined and withered in ancient times, the path has been flawed. After it suffered the Severing Nurture Calamity, it atrophied even further. Taking unorthodox routes is often the most effective solution, but the old man's cultivation is too low. Such methods would be too harsh for him."

Daoist Master Xiang Chun said, "I was instructed upon coming here that he should be gently nourished. His cultivation is low, so I will not speak of methods like vassalization or refinement. Other techniques, like carving bone or replacing blood, are far too agonizing and bloody. I hear your noble clan follows the righteous path, so I would not dare suggest them."

"As I see it, the best method is to directly extend his lifespan. The old man cultivates Pristine Water. Given his low cultivation, supplementing his life-force should not be overwhelmingly difficult."

The two Daoist Masters conferred quietly for a moment. Daoist Master Shanbai then looked up.

"This method of extending life is fundamentally a way for low-level cultivators to leech off the resources of high-level ones, 'stealing' a fraction of the longevity they themselves could not attain. By stealing one or two-tenths, they also forfeit any future possibility of breakthrough."

"Take your clan's elder. Breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm would grant him another hundred years. We can use secret arts and spiritual resources to simulate that breakthrough's True Essence for him, allowing him to gain a tenth or two of that span. If you are willing to provide one portion of a Horn Wood spiritual resource and one portion of either Valley Water or Pristine Water spiritual resource, we can use our divine abilities to harmonize them. Combined with some common life-extending pills for low-level cultivators, we might be able to try for twenty years. Anything more than that," he concluded, "will depend on the old man's own fortune."

He had spoken with considerable tact. Li Ximing simply cupped his hands and sighed.

"Please, just do everything you can."

He then produced the 'Horn Wood' spiritual resource, the Golden Branch of the Late Tassel, and also retrieved a jade bottle. He passed them to Daoist Master Xiang Chun, saying solemnly,

"This medicinal pill is something I acquired in my early years. It has the ability to extend one's lifespan. I ask that you examine it, Daoist friend."

Daoist Master Xiang Chun accepted the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill. As she examined it, she was momentarily struck speechless. After a long pause, she carefully secured the bottle.

"This... this is an extraordinary pill," she said, her voice laced with disbelief. "It actually uses the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness, and its other ingredients are priceless. If this pill is used... it could add ten years at the very least. But..."

The woman pressed her lips together. "This pill would grant a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator _ten years_ as well. That is not an insignificant sum that can be replicated with a few spiritual resources, as one might for a Qi Refining cultivator. If someone like Xianyao learned of this, they would stop at nothing to trade for it. Daoist friend, have you truly thought this through?"

Li Ximing let out a soft sigh.

"If I had not already considered this long and hard, how could I possibly have brought it out?"

Daoist Master Xiang Chun exchanged a look with Daoist Master Shanbai. After a moment's thought, she said,

"There is no immediate rush to use it. Twenty years is a significant amount of time. Perhaps we should proceed this way: Daoist Master Shanbai and I will first focus on recuperating the senior's body and extending his life by those twenty years. If, in that time, King Wei should find another wondrous treasure or prescription, it will not be too late to reassess."

"As for this pill, I will still prepare a prescription for you, detailing a special method for its ingestion. We simply will not use it yet. This way, should it be needed in the future, it will not become a source of guilt for the old man."

Daoist Master Xiang Chun clearly disapproved of such extravagance, but her words were tactful. Li Ximing understood and nodded silently.

"I can only thank you for your trouble."

Both masters waved their hands dismissively. Daoist Master Shanbai sighed.

"Zhaojing is not the first to seek me out for such a thing. Years ago, Daoist friend Tingyun brought an elder here to cure a persistent malady. A divine ability is a precious thing, it's true, but every family has loved ones they cannot bear to part with."

"Indeed..." Li Ximing murmured, but then his eyebrows rose. "Senior, I was wondering... what exactly is this Severing Nurture Calamity you mentioned earlier?"

Daoist Master Shanbai paused. He glanced at Daoist Master Xiang Chun, and seeing her placid expression, he seemed to come to a decision.

"That," he said, "pertains to the first great war between Immortals and Demons."

"The conflict between them is endless, but there have been three great wars. In the beginning, the Wood Virtue paths largely resided within the demonic Dao. They were severed during that first great war. Two True Monarchs, Gathering Wood and Renewing Wood, perished together. For a long age, the path was withered and could not prosper. Later, due to a schism in the Daoist Tradition, only the Horn and Upright Wood paths of the righteous Wood Virtue ever truly flourished."

"The flashpoint for that entire war," he said, lowering his voice, "was the Severing Nurture Calamity."

"There was a branch of Wood Virtue known as 'Protecting Wood'. At the time, it was not prominent, yet it was lorded over by a Demonic Ancestor Immortal titled Zixuan. His power was monstrous, second only to the Three Profoundities. He is the one who unleashed the Severing Nurture Calamity upon the Immortal Dao. In doing so, he gravely offended the heavens and fled the world. The 'Protecting Wood' Fruition Attainment was catastrophically suppressed, and it has never risen again."

Daoist Master Shanbai looked down.

"This is all just hearsay, mind you. A story to pass the time. This Severing Nurture Calamity... it's terrifying, and yet it did not harm a single person. But to call it insidious... it is perhaps the most insidious act in all of history."

Li Ximing's brow furrowed deeply.

"How insidious?"

A bitter expression crossed Daoist Master Shanbai's face.

"With the Three Profoundities gone, this Demonic Ancestor's Dao-Profundity was supreme. Drawing on his authority as lord of 'Protecting Wood' and his mastery of 'Exiled Qi', he wagered the sum total of his entire Dao lineage, his life-mandate, and his Rank Designation as collateral. With this, he 'borrowed' one thing from Heaven and Earth, which he then secretly severed and concealed."

Li Ximing asked, "What thing?"

"Lifespan."

Daoist Master Shanbai sighed.

"The lifespan of all living beings."

Li Ximing stared at him. It was Daoist Master Xiang Chun who spoke, her own eyes downcast.

"In that age, mortals lived to one hundred and twenty. Shamans lived four hundred years. Those with divine abilities lived eight hundred. Traces of this remain; ancient texts still speak of mortals living a century. But the reality now is decline at fifty, exhaustion at sixty, and death at seventy."

This left Li Ximing stunned into silence. A long moment passed before he finally breathed, "How... _vicious_."

"If he were not, how could he be known as one of the four great founders of the demonic path?" Daoist Master Shanbai said with a bitter smile.

"The Lifeless Marshland he established is recorded in the darkest scriptures. Though it is counted alongside the Wuguan Legacy, the Profound Crimson Demonic Legacy, and the Dao of Enduring Malice, it is by far the most stable and powerful of the True Demonic Daos."

"And as long as the Lifeless Marshland stands, the 'Protecting Wood' path can never reclaim its true name, nor can it ever be liberated or verified by another."

The old Daoist Master clearly had access to obscure records, as he understood the Wood Virtue of that era well.

"Even after that Demonic Ancestor verified his Dao and departed this world, the Lifeless Marshland remained, hidden and guarded by his disciple, the Demon Monarch Zheli. A few other powerful figures, holding to old loyalties or agreeing with the Ancestor's philosophy, supported him. The True Monarchs eventually fought a great battle over it, and several fell."

"But that Demon Monarch remained concealed within the Lifeless Marshland, manipulating events from the shadows, stirring up one bloody calamity after another. His hand was even present in the final, cataclysmic battle of Pingming Jin... a battle that shattered the very heavens. Only then was the slate considered 'wiped clean'..."

Hearing him use the phrase "wiped clean," Daoist Master Xiang Chun quietly raised an eyebrow.

"If the slate were truly clean," she said coolly, "then our lifespans would have been returned."

Li Ximing froze, and a chill of horror crept up his spine.

"So... 'Demon Monarch' isn't just a casual title. In that case, the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch..."

At this, Daoist Master Shanbai instantly clamped his mouth shut, saying no more.

Daoist Master Xiang Chun, however, merely sighed and spoke frankly.

"The Lesser Yang Demon Monarch is a disciple of the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect and a figure from the Dao of Enduring Malice. He has no ties to the Lifeless Marshland. He is, of course, a Demon Monarch who falls under the jurisdiction of our Comprehending Profoundity Great Dao."

The moment she said this, Daoist Master Shanbai became visibly flustered. The old man wiped his forehead.

"I'll go and prepare those spiritual items right now!" he interrupted, beating a hasty retreat.

The woman watched him go, a cold smile lingering on her lips.

"What is there to be so afraid of saying? The Wuguan Legacy is on Mount Encompassing Profoundity, and do people not flock to it just the same? The Profound Crimson Demonic Legacy is within the Azure Profoundity, and it, too, is circulated. The Three Profoundities are the True Origin Great Dao; they are all-encompassing. Even the demonic path has a place within them. No one has ever denied this!"

Li Ximing felt an internal chill.

'She's right. The Wuguan Legacy is indeed bound to Mount Encompassing Profoundity.'

Thinking on it, he realized he had never once met a 'Protecting Wood' cultivator. And yet, he himself possessed a 'Protecting Wood' Spiritual Treasure—the Heavenly Nurture Urn he had acquired not long ago.

The inscription on the bottom of that urn read: My Spirit Resides in the Marsh.

'No wonder the Grand Sacrifice technique felt nothing like a righteous art, with its methods for harvesting blood qi and imprisoning divine abilities... It was a demonic artifact from the very beginning.'

'Emperor Song mentioned at the time that the path was incomplete and that its Dao lineage was "filthy." There must have been immense turmoil after... This war between Immortals and Demons, the one that reshaped the entire world... what was it truly about?'

'Was it order? Fruition Attainment? Or was it Yin and Yang... the Five Virtues and the Twelve Qis?'




# Chapter 1121: The Weakening of the Mansion

Li Ximing saw the two Daoist Masters off. By the time he was done, the sky had already darkened. The buildings across the island were a patchwork of light and shadow, bustling with figures.

The Li family, of course, had no intention of inviting those two into the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. Only now did Li Ximing ride the wind down, entering the grotto-mansion of interwoven black, white, and azure. At its center, the pool of Wall-Sinking Water had turned a pure, uniform white. It was clearly ready for harvest.

'Yehui gave one pool of Wall-Sinking Water, and what was used here only amounted to two portions. Once I collect this second portion, and the two Neck Feathers are in my bag, this source will be exhausted.'

'Grandfather's situation cost one Golden Branch of the Late Tassel and one Neck Feathers... I suppose this balances things out.'

He looked up just as Liu Changdie was leading someone inside. Spotting him, Liu Changdie smiled.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing! Come, let me introduce you!"

Li Ximing looked over. The Daoist Master following Liu Changdie was quite short, only reaching his shoulder. Her long hair was tied back, and she had a delicate, gentle appearance, yet her eyes held a profound depth. With every step, she seemed to carry the sound of a gurgling spring.

Before he could speak, the woman had already bowed with a smile.

"Bao Xiang of Bojun Mountain greets Senior!"

Neither of the previous Daoist Masters had been permitted to enter this place, yet Liu Changdie had brought Daoist Master Bao Xiang back without hesitation. Clearly, he held her in extremely high trust.

This immediately gave Li Ximing a favorable impression. Seeing how young she appeared, he returned the bow politely, intending to treat her as a peer. But Liu Changdie chuckled.

"This child only broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm two years ago. She's the junior of a friend of mine, so she should rightly call you Senior!"

Hearing the name Bojun Mountain, Li Ximing understood. Liu Changdie had taken the Western Sea matter to heart and made contact in advance. Secretly grateful, he smiled.

"Truly, the younger generation is full of outstanding talent!"

The Daoist Master quickly demurred, but Liu Changdie continued seriously,

"She cultivates Pit Water, follows the Heavenly Embryo Dao, and is supported by a Diverse Mansion. Her divine ability is Holding the Ridge. She comes from a distinguished lineage!"

He paused, then added, "Regarding the Western Sea... I'll have this junior guide you."

Li Ximing thanked him.

"I must still rely on Senior's guidance."

Liu Changdie turned, and they sat down together. He poured tea, his voice growing distant.

"The Western Sea... it isn't just one sea. 'The Various Seas' would be more fitting. If you travel northwest from the highlands, past Great Yona, you'll find a sea-like basin named the Beigao Leizhu Sea, as vast as the Great Shu region. Cross a few mountain ranges, and you'll find another sea of similar size, the Taihai. Great Tazi lies between them."

"Only after crossing the Taihai do you reach the heart of the Western Sea, called the Fuzhong Sea. It's larger than Jiangnan, comparable to the Zhulu region. This is what most people simply call the Western Sea."

Liu Changdie smiled.

"This Western Sea is peculiar. It's encircled by mountains and islands, much like a giant pool, yet it's filled with saltwater. It is precisely this strange geography, embodying the essence of a lake or marsh, that earned it the favor of Water Mansion. It was the first place Water Mansion was verified, its primary symbolic domain!"

Li Ximing had visited Great Tazi some time ago. He vividly remembered the turban-wearing westerners. But he had only traveled between the Beigao Leizhu Sea and the Taihai, never venturing further west. He had long heard rumors of the connection between the Western Sea and Water Mansion, but only now understood the reason. He marveled,

"No wonder Water Mansion favors it! To think a great sea exists, landlocked like that!"

In truth, it wasn't the only such place. Li Ximing's first thought was of Lake Xian, the familiar salt lake in Jiangnan. Legend held it was left behind from a battle between great powers; it, too, was like a lake but connected to the sea, carrying the symbolism of Water Mansion. That was why Li Wushao, who cultivated Water Mansion, had coveted the place before being dragged back by his uncle, Li Yuanjiao.

"Back then, Moongaze Marsh was already considered a holy land for Water Mansion. If there was a lake as vast as a sea... I can't imagine how much favor it would receive!"

Liu Changdie nodded at his words. Bao Xiang, having listened quietly, spoke up thoughtfully.

"In the past, Water Mansion had two major branches, often seen as an immortal and a demonic division. One branch was located on an ancient mountain not far from the Beigao Leizhu Sea, controlling the powers of the Weak Water branch. This is the 'Weak Water' most Xia people traditionally imagine. The other branch was here in the Western Sea, controlling the vast, oceanic power of Water Mansion."

"Back then, the Western Sea was far more formidable than it is today, rich in spiritual qi. Because it governed the vastness of Water Mansion, the specific mysteries of Weak Water weren't as apparent. It was an incredibly glorious place. Far from the mainland, it was beyond the notice of the great powers, and its inhabitants were not Xia people, so it wasn't bound by so many dogmatic traditions. It was a sanctuary for demonic cultivators... A great nation, Daqin, was even built around this sea, and it, too, raised storms of blood..."

"Later, some great change—a dispute related to the Dragon-kin—occurred. After that, the ancient immortal mountain vanished, and the connection between the Western Sea and Water Mansion grew tenuous. Furthermore, the power of Weak Water spun out of control. It rampaged, unable to be unified or transcended, and so it declined year after year."

She seemed to have a deep understanding of these matters, explaining them with simple clarity. Li Ximing grew pensive.

"So the division between Water Mansion and Weak Water... it began that long ago."

The woman smiled.

"Indeed. Cultivators in the Western Sea have no concept of 'Weak Water'. Only high-level cultivators from the mainland use that term."

The Li family had heard the name Weak Water very early on, from Yang Xiao'er. That imperial descendant with ties to the Underworld had mentioned it casually, cementing the impression of 'Weak Water' in their minds.

But Li Ximing recalled something with sudden clarity:

'Why does Water Mansion not verify? It only hates the beast that seized the abyss. The Profound Giant Turtle lost the Vast Ocean. Henceforth, their natures are hard to unite!'

Those were words from the original master of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion!

'Given the sheer size of the Western Sea, it must correspond to Water Mansion's 'Vast Ocean'! It's highly probable that Water Mansion was decoupled from the Vast Ocean. Its authority shrank, confined only to lakes and marshes. That must be why the Western Sea lost its connection to Water Mansion!'

'I fear that the 'great change' she mentioned... was the very 'abyss-seizing' event that allowed Pit Water to claim the Vast Ocean!'

His heart sank. This new understanding of Water Mansion left him pensive and silent for a long time. His silence eventually prompted the woman to venture,

"I hear Senior is interested in the Western Sea's situation and the Wall-Sinking Water... This junior may have a suggestion or two..."

Li Ximing's eyes brightened.

"Please, go on!"

Daoist Master Bao Xiang said, "Wall-Sinking Water isn't exceptionally precious, but gathering a large amount is difficult. If you require a steady supply, it's best to have the Xinggong Terrace manage it... We can discuss the details."

"As for the situation..."

Liu Changdie, quiet until now, set down his cup.

"On Small Guang Kong Mountain, there is a De'ai Temple. Its master is Host Shehu. He and I have some old grudges. The spiritual water he possesses is also what Daoist Master Zhaojing requires. That is why we are here."

Li Ximing filed the name away. Bao Xiang's brow furrowed.

"Junior understands... But Host Shehu is a friend of the West Mansion Grotto Sect... I urge both Seniors to reconsider and proceed with caution."

Bao Xiang was no fool; she had detected the killing intent in Liu Changdie's tone. This matter was dangerous. If anything went wrong, she, having assisted them, could be dragged down as well. She would never have involved herself if anyone but Liu Changdie had asked.

Liu Changdie met his gaze and sent a voice transmission.

'We'll proceed as Zhaojing arranges. My enmity with Shehu isn't that deep. If we must dispose of him, it's not a major affair. But it must be fast and ruthless. If it drags on, someone will certainly come to his rescue.'

'His cultivation isn't high, but he has two divine abilities and cultivates Upright Wood. Are you confident?'

Li Ximing had plenty of assets to call on. With unrelated figures like Yan Dushui and Guo Nanwu providing support from the sidelines, there were countless schemes he could employ. Adding in several Spiritual Treasures and Li Zhouwei himself, their target couldn't escape even if he grew wings. He simply replied,

'You can be completely at ease.'

Li Ximing replied, then smiled at Bao Xiang.

"I'll trouble you to make the arrangements. I will find the right moment to act... If reconciliation is truly impossible, someone will naturally be there to dispose of him."

Daoist Master Bao Xiang considered this silently for a moment before nodding.

"Junior understands."

...

A fierce wind howled under heavy black clouds.

The Qi region was vast, its lands open, sprawling above the Jianghuai region. It had been a strategic heartland for generations. But in the current Zhao State, the Qi territory promised to the Gao family was fractured and incomplete.

'The east is held by Yan, the west is ruled by Zhao. The center of power, Mount Dayang, is occupied by Buddhist cultivators. The Gao clan only received the eastern territories. Although they are the foremost clan in Qi... their position is precarious.'

Gazing at the dim earth below, the man silently shook his head.

'The only saving grace is the Yue Cultivating Sect's Profound Truth Mountain to the south. Though the Yue Cultivating Sect is reclusive, it controls enough land to form a natural buffer, preventing the Gao family from having direct contact with Jianghuai. This affords them a small measure of freedom.'

Wind and rain lashed the normally peaceful Prefecture city, shrouding it in darkness. A man riding a profound light descended, halting in mid-air. A long-faced man in golden robes immediately flew up to greet him, his voice low.

"Senior Touba honors us with your presence. Please forgive my failure to welcome you properly!"

"Ah, Yingge. It has indeed been many years."

The man on the profound light was none other than the Dai King's own brother, the Great Daoist Master Touba Qiye, who had previously gone to Luoxia to meet Yao Guanyi.

Though the Great Daoist Master's tone was cordial, Shilou Yingge remained inwardly guarded. He smiled deferentially.

"My Great King has been awaiting your arrival."

The two Purple Mansion Realm experts, one leading, one following, descended toward a palace from which True Fire pulsed and leaped. Inside, golden light shone from everywhere. They passed through vermilion gates, one after another, traversing four grand halls, past a silver dais of rising dragons and twelve fractured pillars, all awash in brilliant color.

Atop a throne blazing with True Fire sat a man. He wore a snow-white upper garment and bright red robes. His build was powerful, his eyebrows thick, and his beard full.

This was the Valiant King, Gao Fu.

Waves of blazing light rippled behind him, illuminating the hall as if he were a deity. Shockingly, he had already surpassed the Purple Mystery and become a Great Daoist Master of the True Fire Dao.

Touba Qiye studied him quietly for a moment.

"Congratulations."

Gao Fu's eyes, turned crimson by the flames, met his. His voice was calm.

"I am nearly seventy years behind you, my friend. What is there to celebrate?"

Shilou Yingge had already retreated to one side. Touba Qiye chuckled, clasping his hands behind his back.

"My Touba family follows the Great Dao of Profound Qi; the Golden Core stage is merely the beginning. How can it be compared to ordinary traditions? The Valiant King shoulders the burdens of royalty and has cultivated the Great Dao of True Fire. The two are not comparable."

Gao Fu stared at him.

"You are too modest. I wonder, how is the Dai King?"

Touba Qiye spoke without reservation.

"His divine ability is perfected. He is but one step from the Quest for Gold."

"Waiting for the True Qi to return to its position?"

Hearing the Valiant King's question, Touba Qiye replied softly,

"Not necessarily. Whether it returns or not, my brother will continue seeking the Dao. It's just a matter of waiting for the right moment. If there is no True Qi, there are other paths. He will not be led by the nose by those great figures. And what if it never returns?"

Gao Fu stroked his beard.

"In that, I am his inferior."

This admission gave Touba Qiye a complicated expression. Had anyone else said it, he would have taken it as a matter of course. But hearing it from Gao Fu, he felt no arrogance, only a complex mix of emotions. After a long pause, he said:

"My brother often says that the world sees a new wave of dragons rising. While this is due to five hundred years of peace and a rich spiritual environment... it is also a matter of circumstance and destiny. The only things the Valiant King lacks... are birthright and timing."

"If this were ancient times..."

Before he could finish, Gao Fu, still seated, waved his hand.

"The world is full of heroes, but one must seize the right moment to leap the dragon gate. Heaven's mandate does not lie with True Fire. What good is one person's talent? Look at today's Xiao Chuting and Chi Buzi, or the earlier Duanmu Kui and Si Boxiu. Which of them was not a figure of astonishing talent?"

"Moreover... the difficulty of attaining the True Fire Dao is rivaled only by that of Water Mansion."

Gao Fu smiled faintly.

"I know I cannot compare to that Great Demon Tianzhi, who could generate light from the darkness, attracting the master of the Tree of One Heart to observe his ceremony. Even he has not succeeded, so what hope is there for a minor cultivator like me, whose path is all but severed?"

Touba Qiye fell silent. Gao Fu, however, changed the subject with a smile.

"So, you were reprimanded by Lord Yao."

At the mention of this, Touba Qiye's eye twitched. His expression turned gloomy.

"It was merely a warning."

Gao Fu easily read the true meaning.

'The dharma body wasn't the point. The point is that the Touba family has been making too many moves, acting restlessly. Yao Guanyi just used that incident as a pretext to warn him.'

The Valiant King rose and slowly paced down from the high dais. He stopped before Touba Qiye.

"Since that is the case, why has Daoist Friend Touba come to my Gao family today?"

Touba Qiye was silent for a long time before finally speaking.

"The Dai State will be increasing its involvement. I will be leading men to Yunzhong Prefecture to act as a flanking force for Yan, to help pin down King Wei."

The gloom on his face faded, replaced by a cold anger.

"In the meantime, Touba Ci will go south. He is to be commissioned as a general of Zhao State, his life and death no longer the concern of Shengle Heaven. And your Gao clan... you are to dispatch someone to go with him, to fight at his side."

A flicker of coldness passed through Gao Fu's eyes, though he seemed unsurprised by the command. His smile remained.

"Oh? So you must enter the fray as well? How many Great Daoist Masters does that make, prepared for 'His Highness'? Not even the Wei Crown Prince of old enjoyed such favor!"

Hearing the words "His Highness," Shilou Yingge snapped his head up. Touba Qiye looked even more incredulous, his intended words catching in his throat. After a long moment, he said in a low voice,

"Yingge's actions years ago, though hidden within the grotto-heaven, were not hidden from those great figures. Whether your injuries were real or feigned, they saw right through your little scheme. The Lotus Temple remains safe only because Jinlian has powerful backing!"

"And now... they sent _me_ to deliver this message. Is the meaning not obvious enough?!"

Gao Fu stood with his hands clasped behind him, offering no reply. Touba Qiye's expression was fraught.

"Brother Gao Fu... you must think this through, very carefully!"




# Chapter 1122: Vast Jade

Touba Qiye's eyes, burning with Profound Yellow Qi, stared heavily at him. The great hall was silent save for the crackling of the fiercely burning True Fire. The Valiant King remained quiet for a long time before speaking.

“Daoist Friend Touba, I understand why Lord Yao sent you.”

At his side, Shilou Yingge raised an eyebrow, seeming to suppress the urge to speak. Touba Qiye continued in a soft voice,

“Back when the Wei first rose, our two families were enfeoffed side-by-side. When the Qi later fell, we contended for the world together. Your ancestor, Gao Jun, was a good friend of the former emperor and the king my Liang clan recognized to 'Uphold Wei'... Even if we've had our frictions since, we have ultimately walked this path together for many years.”

“This isn't just about our personal friendship today; it's about the bond between our families... The matter of King Wei is no longer something the Gao clan can involve itself in!”

Touba Qiye looked anxious.

“Moongaze Lake saved the Li clan, and it's their life-saving talisman. But in the end, it will also be their death warrant! If the Gao clan gets entangled in this, it will surely lead to disaster!”

Gao Fu's expression didn't flicker. His voice was utterly flat as he replied:

“Thank you for the warning, Daoist friend.”

This made Touba Qiye turn his head away. He opened his mouth to speak several times but ultimately held his tongue, recalling this was another's family affair. After a long pause, he finally said,

“In that case... Qiye takes his leave.”

The blood brother of Mobei's Regent King, the Great Daoist Master of the Touba family, left without another word, striding hastily from the hall. Shilou Yingge escorted him all the way to the edge before finally speaking.

“You've troubled yourself, Senior.”

Touba Qiye's speech in the hall had clearly lowered some of his guard. Shilou Yingge's voice was heavy with worry.

“This matter... isn't about right or wrong. Please, milord, do not take offense.”

Touba Qiye turned back, a hint of a sigh in his twin-colored, Profound Yellow Qi-filled eyes.

“What offense is there to take? I can't say he's wrong... After all...”

He paused.

“If it came down to it, and only one of you and Ci'er could live... it would certainly be you, Shilou Yingge.”

This silenced Shilou Yingge for a long moment.

“That might not be a good thing.”

Touba Qiye didn't reply. He silently rode the winds away. Even though the one to be sacrificed was his own son, his grief was overshadowed by a stark resolution.

Even the Touba clan of old couldn't afford to offend Mount Luoxia, let alone now.

'As long as big brother's and the young master's plan succeeds... Ci'er will just have to be wronged!'

As he flew away, Shilou Yingge returned to the fire hall, his thoughts heavy. The dark red flames leaped, casting flickering light on Gao Fu. Shilou Yingge lowered his gaze, stepped forward, and asked,

“Great King... whom will you send to stop Wei?”

Gao Fu didn't look at him. He stared quietly at the radiance beyond the countless palace halls.

“Yingge, I suppose you must resent me now.”

Shilou Yingge raised an eyebrow and smiled.

“You are the Great King, the Valiant King, and the Gao Family Head. You make the decisions. This junior can only obey. However, Yingge must consider the future of the Gao clan. You have your reasons for courting death, and I have my wish to preserve our family. Resenting one's superior... that is not the way of the Gao.”

He said no more, only smiling.

“I only ask that Your Majesty grants my wish!”

Gao Fu gave him a deep look. In the end, he offered no words of dissuasion.

“Go, then.”

Expressionless, Shilou Yingge bowed and withdrew. The flame-filled palace grew even more silent. The Valiant King, Gao Fu, stood alone in the hall, gazing silently at the bright Heavenly Light beyond the palaces.

...

Night's darkness surged.

The sea was utterly still, without a single ripple of light or color, submerged in thick blackness. An unknown time passed before a speck of Heavenly Light drifted over and hovered to a stop above the water.

Li Ximing's eyes were bright as he looked down at the ocean.

“This Weak Water... it's truly formidable.”

He had only just entered the sea region, but he could already sense that the strange properties of the Weak Water here were enough to make it difficult for even a Qi Refining cultivator to ride the wind. Without a Water Mansion dharma artifact, he feared not even a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would dare try to cross a hundred li.

Beside him, Daoist Master Bao Xiang shook her head slightly.

“This isn't even its most dangerous part. Further west, there is a strait called the Abyss of Weak Water. Even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who isn't careful can fall in.”

Li Ximing asked, intrigued, “Beyond the Abyss of Weak Water, is there a Sea's Cape?”

Daoist Master Bao Xiang smiled and nodded.

“This place can't compare to the Eastern Sea, with its countless outer seas. Continue west from the Abyss of Weak Water for another thousand li, and you'll reach the Sea's Cape.”

The two flew onward. A massive mountain range swiftly rose from the sea, winding and undulating, shrouded in a hazy, luminous mist. The surrounding water was perfectly still, like a clear mirror.

“That is the Little Mountain of Vast Jade,” Daoist Master Bao Xiang said.

Li Ximing had heard of this mountain. The Marvelous Wisdom Whisker he'd gotten from Liu Changdie years ago was a treasure from this very place. He pinched his fingers in a quick calculation and asked in surpris.

“Gathering Wood?”

Daoist Master Bao Xiang nodded with a smile.

“This mountain was formed from a demon's corpse. The Eastern Sea has Splitreed Island; the Western Sea has the Little Mountain of Vast Jade. It just can't compare to the Eastern Sea in terms of resources or cultivators. Ordinary people can't set foot on this mountain. Anyone who can stay here is at least in the Foundation Establishment Realm.”

Her expression turned serious.

“After all, this is where the very first 'Gathering Wood' Demon Monarch was slain. Who knows how many treasures it has nourished over the millennia. Back in the day, Senior Yuanxiu cultivated here for many years.”

“Yuanxiu?”

Li Ximing hadn't expected to hear his name. As he pondered, Daoist Master Bao Xiang glanced around and lowered her voice.

“He had a good relationship with Xinggong Terrace. My own closest friend is the current master of Xinggong Terrace. I heard that Daoist Master Yuanxiu came here long ago to discuss his path with the Great Daoist Master Miaoqi.”

“At the time, the Great Daoist Master warned him that his method for achieving the Dao was too dangerous. But Daoist Master Yuanxiu disagreed, saying, ‘The Great Dao is born of heaven; we who cultivate later merely follow it. How can there be a path without risk, or a transformation without peril?’”

Li Ximing remarked, “I've heard many praise him. He must have been just one step away.”

Daoist Master Bao Xiang smiled.

“Senior sees clearly. Old Daoist Master Yuanxiu may not have a reputation for combat, but his Dao-Profundity was first-class.”

Li Ximing keenly sensed she seemed to know an unusual amount about matters in Jiangnan. He filed the thought away. Hearing the name Great Daoist Master Miaoqi, his interest was piqued, and he raised an eyebrow.

“This Great Daoist Master Miaoqi... was she a 'Whole Pill' cultivator? What is her cultivation level now?”

Daoist Master Bao Xiang's expression changed, a complex look flashing in her eyes. She lowered her head.

“Her Ladyship perished long ago.”

Li Ximing was taken aback.

He mused, “This was...”

Seeing that they were drawing closer to the mountain, and their connection to the Great Void was rapidly fading, Bao Xiang grew a bit bolder. She sneered,

“Who else could it be? Whose private domain is the 'Whole Pill' path? Wasn't there already that Daoist Master from the Helian family? Even with no evidence, it's easy enough to guess!”

Li Ximing felt a jolt of shock. A flicker of worry crossed his heart, and he nodded silently, lowering his gaze to the mountains below. The colors there were thick and layered. Bao Xiang quickly fell silent.

“This is the Little Mountain of Vast Jade.”

Li Ximing scanned the surrounding sea. It was truly just this single mountain island. Noticing the dense fog, a thought struck him.

“Oh? Senior Liu once gave me a spiritual resource from this mountain, but for some reason, it was hazy and indistinct...”

Bao Xiang whispered, “‘Water Mansion’ is the water of a thriving lake, and ‘Gathering Wood’ is the wood where things perch and depend on one another. Wood in water should be nourished, but this is dead wood. Instead of nourishment, it received rot. This created the 'Great Submerged Rot Qi,' which is even more potent than the winds of the Great Western Plateau. It can shroud one's spiritual sense.”

“There are many spiritual items on the mountain, and even Purple Mansion Realm resources appear from time to time. They're just hard to find; you must rely on divination. However, every year on the fourteenth of the seventh month, the mists on the mountain thin slightly. Even Qi Refining disciples can enter, so the various sects send their people in.”

Bao Xiang's face held a cold smile.

“I don't need to say more. The so-called fourteenth of the seventh month is just when a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators join forces to suppress the Great Submerged Rot Qi. They naturally use life-mandates to 'fill the gap.' How could there be any real treasures left for the junior disciples?”

Li Ximing glanced over, his mind working. He silently connected to the Immortal Artifact, and the power of Spirit Probe poured forth. His vision cleared instantly, revealing the wood-grained body of the mountain.

But beneath the mist, atop the mountains, were piles of white bones and collapsed, dead trees. Not a single spot was clean. Rivers of blood pulsed as if breathing, nourishing the spiritual-qi-wreathed clouds and rain.

'This is the sea of demon cultivators, after all. It really is just a bloody mire—using 'Gathering Wood' to collect blood qi and nurture spiritual resources.'

He scanned the scene, unsurprised. Bao Xiang, however, seemed to remember something and smiled.

“There are benefits, too. Because this qi can mask spiritual sense, many 'children of fate' have risen from this place. Thirty percent of the Western Sea's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators came from the Little Mountain of Vast Jade!”

Li Ximing glanced over impassively, but under the Immortal Artifact's observation, he noticed something. On the sea's mirror-calm surface at the mountain's base, there was the faint reflection of a palace. It was massive, clearly not a human dwelling.

The palace was ancient and rough, yet damaged and incomplete. Signs of destruction were everywhere, a chaotic mess of light and dark green. Enormous statues lay toppled on either side; he could vaguely make out the fragmented, stone-carved scales of immense serpentine bodies.

His heart leaped. Recalling old rumors about the Western Sea, he asked:

“I've heard there is also a 'Great Vast Jade Mountain'...”

“Oh.”

Bao Xiang, oblivious, said seriously, “The 'Great Vast Jade Mountain' is far away, on the seabed. It was once the Western Sea Dragon Monarch's palace, but now it's the residence of a certain great lord. We don't normally speak of it. The interesting one is the other, which the people of the Western Sea call the 'Middle Vast Jade Mountain.' It's not on the sea, nor _in_ the sea.”

Li Ximing laughed. Feigning ignorance, he asked,

“Oh? If it's a Water Mansion, it can't be in the sky. So... is it in the Great Void?”

The woman, riding her Pit Water, said:

“It's in the water's reflection.”

She elaborated, “That place was once the palace of the True Hornless Dragon's sixth son, Dongfang Fengchi. Because he held the 'Pristine Water' position, he borrowed the concept of 'Gathering Wood establishing a Water Mansion' to create a pool. That's why the water is as calm as a mirror. It's located within the reflection of the Little Mountain of Vast Jade—that's what we call the 'Middle Vast Jade Mountain'.”

“Later, he was eliminated by the Western Sea Dragon Monarch Dongfang Yuezhu and the other Dragons. The place has been empty ever since. Occasionally, on days when the wind and rain have ceased and the world is clear, you can still see the ruins of the 'Middle Vast Jade Mountain' in the reflection.”

Li Ximing called it marvelous, knowing the Immortal Artifact had already seen it clearly. It had to be that former Demon palace. He secretly pushed the divine ability, and sure enough, he saw a field of ruins. The throne at the highest point was as large as a palace, but it had been split in two. The entire place was a wreck, completely empty, with no sign of treasure.

He asked in surprise, “Isn't that a Grotto-Heaven? Has any Daoist friend ever tried to enter?”

Bao Xiang clearly faltered, not expecting his mind to leap there so quickly. She sank into deep thought.

“This...”

Before Bao Xiang could answer, Li Ximing’s gaze, which had been moving, suddenly froze. An utterly terrifying scene had appeared.

Amidst the endless, ancient reflections of the ruins, there was a flicker of green.

It was a green-robed figure.

The man wore green robes with golden tassels. His movements were lazy as he lounged against a massive, throne-like step. His face was demonic, with long, narrow eyes like a snake or a Flood Dragon. Blue-black hair spilled down, dark and dreadful.

He was gazing up at the sky, twirling a green apricot in his hand. He had already taken a bite. The expression on his face was one of keen interest.

Li Ximing felt an icy chill shoot up his spine, flooding his throat and mind.

That face was terribly familiar.

'Suiguan.'

The Great Daoist Master who had walked out of Pristine Speech Heaven. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator suspected to be an incarnation of True Monarch Lushui, Du Qing. The demonic figure who had personally orchestrated a slaughter of millions!

'He's looking at me.'

In Li Ximing's eyes, this ghostly Great Daoist Master with his perfected divine ability was no different from Du Qing himself. His appearance on the north bank back then had been terrifying enough, let alone appearing so suddenly within his Spirit Probe's vision!

'Has he been hiding here all this time? Or is it...'

He didn't dare show the slightest change in expression. He didn't dare deliberately look away. He forced himself to keep gazing at the sea's surface as if appreciating the view.

The Great Daoist Master moved.

Suiguan caught the green apricot between his lips. The smile on his face seemed to fade. He freed both hands, sat up a little straighter, and continued to stare right at Li Ximing's face.

'...'

The suffocating moment lasted for two full breaths. Only then did Li Ximing hear Bao Xiang laugh.

“They don't dare. They're all afraid that what they'd be stepping into isn't the 'Middle Vast Jade Mountain'—but Pristine Speech Heaven!”

'They have good reason to be afraid...'

Her words were a life-saving rope. With a look of perfect surprise, Li Ximing turned his head to look at the Daoist Master. His smile remained fixed. He shook his sleeves, hiding his hands behind his back.

“You must be joking! Pristine Speech Heaven is far away in Jiangnan.”

He glanced at the Daoist Master beside him. In that brief instant, he had already severed his connection to the Immortal Artifact. But the artifact's power was astonishing. In the fraction of a second it took to turn his head, his peripheral vision still caught the scene below.

The ruined steps were now empty.

The green-robed man was standing at the very apex of the reflection, his robes billowing. His arms were crossed over his chest, his pale hand still clutching the green apricot. That demonic face was now only a fist's distance from breaking the surface of the water. He was so close that if he just raised his eyebrows, he would be seen.

His eyes, swirling with green and purple light, held a look of profound interest as they stared quietly at him.

The seawater was crystal clear, as if nothing at all was in it.




# Chapter 1123: A Scheme for Change

A faint, watery light flickered across the collapsed stone wall. On the mural, the mottled, winding body of a giant serpent was visible, and the Great Daoist Master’s shadow danced lightly upon the wreckage.

The smile on Suiguan's face broadened.

Simultaneously, the entire Demon palace hidden within the reflection began to tremble. Gushing light from the Pristine Water surged from every stone crevice, slithering up the fallen pillars like countless green serpents.

These serpents intertwined, wings bursting from their backs. They took flight with a rustling hiss. The reflection of the entire sea trembled and roiled, colors bleeding into one another, threatening to breach the surface at any moment and drag the two Daoist Masters down into its depths.

Even more fatal was the haunting music that echoed through the reflection—a mournful, gurgling melody that tugged at the heart, its notes calling and responding.

Yet the two Daoist Masters on the sea's surface remained utterly oblivious.

A flicker of doubt crossed Suiguan's eyes. He stood silently, hands clasped behind his back. In an instant, all phenomena vanished, and the watery light settled back onto the ruins.

'An illusion...?'

He was using his Spring's Echo to sense this place, a divine mystery he had borrowed. It wasn't something one could simply ignore. Even if Li Ximing was a Great Daoist Master, he should have shown some reaction, so long as he could see and hear.

'No reaction at all...'

'Am I overthinking... or did he truly sense my gaze just now?'

This was not the time for this place to reveal itself. If Li Zhouwei had come, Suiguan might have understood; that man's fate was strong, his eyes sharp. But Li Ximing... this was interesting.

'That's not right, either. The Xingyu Palace may be in ruins, but I am shielded by the Chou-Gui Hidden Form. Detecting my gaze should be nearly impossible.'

The man’s blue-purple eyes shifted, and he remained silent for a long time.

'This fellow has cultivated the Life Divine Ability. His World's Radiance... could it grant such perception?'

He pondered for a moment, a murderous smile touching his lips.

"Du Qingzang... I've been here for days. I didn't see Chi Buzi, but this Li Ximing pops up... Li Ximing... a probe from Moongaze Lake."

"According to Du's plan, if it wasn't Chi Buzi, I shouldn't bother. But Li Ximing... he might be in league with that other one. Whether he saw me or not, since he's appeared here, it's safer to eliminate him. It will also serve as a warning."

His blue-purple eyes scanned the area wantonly. He began to stroll, moving with deceptive speed, shuttling through the reflection to follow closely behind the two figures on the water. His gaze fixed on the man like a phantom.

But even a place as large as Little Mountain of Vast Jade was quickly crossed by two Daoist Masters. Suiguan stopped at the edge of the reflection, his expression turning cold. He hesitantly extended half a foot.

The instant he did, the watery light collapsed. Infinite illusory phases churned, and the entire world shook violently, as if mountains were crumbling and the earth splitting. The Demon palace itself began to disintegrate, issuing a cold, silent warning.

The Great Daoist Master's brow furrowed. He watched helplessly as the two divine ability-wielders vanished over the horizon. He quietly retracted his foot, his expression once again calm.

'That damned Du... I can't even kill him...?'

Suiguan squinted into the distance for a long time before turning away. He stepped through the void, rematerializing beside the throne. He stood silent. Only when the sky outside had grown completely dark did he quietly take a seat and speak, his voice flat.

"You think it will alert the enemy? What, Lord Pristine Water, is Chi Buzi himself more dangerous than the plans of the Underworld and the Immortal Mansion?"

As he spoke, the faint light of the Pristine Water began to flow through the ruins, illuminating countless buried treasures and golden artifacts. Suiguan watched with cold eyes, finally murmuring to himself,

"The True Dragons are imminent. This is the only time the Dragon-kin will be so lax about the Pristine Water position. Du Qing, ah Du Qing... you disdain the schemes of the great houses, yet you guard so fiercely against a mere cultivator surnamed Chi... Are you truly not... sacrificing the vital for the trivial?"

But the world of the reflection remained utterly silent. The brilliance of the Pristine Water rose, bathing the world in a pale, greenish-white light. The only answer was the cold sound of flowing water and the churning, primordial chaos coiling silently in the zenith.

...

The moonlight was bright and clear.

A cool breeze rustled through the swaying pines. Li Ximing landed atop another sect's mountain gate. Seeing the Purple Mansion Realm's grand defensive array close beneath him, he finally felt the relief of having survived a disaster. He secretly activated the Immortal Artifact.

'That ghostly thing... it didn't follow me.'

He had seen Suiguan appear below his feet and had immediately severed his divine sense. He knew nothing of what happened after, but that didn't mean he was unaffected...

Heavens knew how many thoughts had raced through his mind on that short journey. Why was Suiguan here? Was it an arrangement by that True Monarch? If he had been exposed... what would the consequences have been?

'The Dragon Prince's palace... the Pristine Water Golden Core... how many secrets does it hold...'

But what chilled him most was Suiguan’s reaction.

'How could he be so perceptive?'

Li Ximing had been using the Immortal Mirror to scan the area. Technically, it was the Immortal Artifact that had seen Suiguan, not him! It was impossible for Suiguan to have made any judgment based on the mere shift of his gaze.

'He must have seen me passing by and decided to test me...'

Even members of Azure Pond felt their hearts pound when they saw the demonic Suiguan. Li Ximing now understood that feeling deeply. A headache pulsed behind his eyes as he cursed inwardly:

'When I go back, I am _never_ flying over Little Mountain of Vast Jade again!'

He forced himself to calm down and surveyed his surroundings. He had arrived at a Daoist temple, but it seemed deserted. The mountains were quiet, with few people in sight. Presently, an old Daoist Master emerged to greet him.

The man wore simple robes, but his cuffs were embroidered with heavy gold patterns that seemed to glow in the night. A faint, multicolored halo shimmered behind his head, giving him a benevolent and extraordinary aura.

He was just extremely old, his face a map of hardships, and he appeared to be injured. He hurried forward and bowed.

"Dao Mian of Xinggong Terrace greets Your Highness!"

Li Ximing glanced at him, realization dawning. The man before him was an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Whole Pill path, and likely possessed two divine abilities.

'This is Xinggong Terrace?'

Li Ximing was genuinely surprised. He glanced at the desolate mountain beneath his feet. He suspected their very mountain gate had been stolen, forcing them to relocate here.

"Senior, you are too kind," he sighed.

Then, he forced a smile.

"My family also has a junior cultivating the Whole Pill, and she is near her breakthrough. Perhaps we will have much to discuss in the future!"

Liu Changdie hadn't arranged this connection with Xinggong Terrace just for resources. The Whole Pill path placed immense importance on lineage, inheritance, and specific spiritual items. This was all to pave the way for his family's Li Que'wan.

Dao Mian's eyes lit up with surprise and delight.

"Excellent... excellent..."

Xinggong Terrace was at the absolute nadir of its lineage. They had already traded away generations of their savings, and were still just barely clinging on. How could he not be thrilled? Even the deep lines of hardship on his face seemed to soften.

Daoist Master Bao Xiang led him inside, seemingly about to offer tea. But after the scare at Little Mountain of Vast Jade, Li Ximing wanted to get this over with.

"I presume Senior already knows the reason for my visit... I was wondering about the Wall-Sinking Water..."

Dao Mian clasped his hands.

"That is not difficult to acquire in the Western Sea. Using my lineage's methods, it can be produced in several locations. Although we have lost access to most of them, it wouldn't be hard to ask a few Daoist friends to... make arrangements."

Li Ximing sighed internally.

"Ideally... I would need one pool a year. That's approximately... one hundred portions."

"One... pool... _a year_?!"

Dao Mian had expected a large request, fitting for a Purple Mansion Realm expert, and one pool wasn't an absurd amount. But _one pool every year_ was terrifying. A thoughtful expression crossed his face.

"That... is somewhat troublesome," he probed. "I wonder... what fellow Daoist offers in trade?"

Li Ximing's expression turned serious.

"Our two lands are far apart. I will dispatch a Daoist Master to travel between them. Each time they arrive, they will supply your esteemed lineage with equivalent spiritual resources. Your troubles, compensation for the Material Transformation... be it pill refinement materials or Purple Mansion Realm resources, all are negotiable."

Dao Mian seemed unconcerned with resources. He sighed.

"The Western Sea cannot compare to the Eastern Sea. I will find a way to gather the spiritual water, I just ask that fellow Daoist give me time. As for compensation... it concerns this injury of mine."

"I was wounded by another, and Merging Fire seared my body. I have yet to recover. I've sought help from many, but nothing works. They say it's not a matter of healing, but of replenishing. It requires a pill."

Li Ximing was beginning to understand.

Dao Mian smiled.

"I cultivate the Whole Pill and am versed in transformations. I've tried mixing a remedy with spiritual items, but it's not as effective as a refined pill. Please, take a look."

He drew a silk cloth from his sleeve. It was covered in fine, golden script. Li Ximing read it several times over.

"Hm?"

His own skill in the Dao of pills was profound. As he read the Whole Pill profundities, his mind lit up, and inspiration struck. He was deeply impressed.

"Fellow Daoist... you are truly formidable!"

Dao Mian was not surprised.

"You praise me too highly. The Whole Pill path concerns itself with Material Transformation, so we have some small ability. There have been many great pill refiners, but few could write a formula that later generations could successfully replicate. Half the formulas passed down... were written by Whole Pill cultivators. I am merely dabbling in the art, and cannot compare to fellow Daoist."

The formula used Valley Water resources, combined them with Pristine Water transformations, nourished the mixture with Water Mansion spiritual water, and finally refined it into a medicine. The process was incredibly complex and clever. If successful, it could harmonize three different water virtues, producing an effect far beyond the sum of its parts. The refinement itself wasn't the hard part; determining the precise ratios would likely lead to countless costly failures. No wonder he hadn't attempted it himself.

But Li Ximing immediately thought of the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art. That secret art was perfect for this. With its aid, the difficulty of this refinement would plummet. He felt a craftsman's eagerness to take on the challenge.

"I will refine it for you," he said decisively. "You will provide the spiritual resources. As for the Wall-Sinking Water... I require six pools."

He didn't bother with a yearly arrangement. Collection would only grow more difficult. In a few years, they might not be able to gather a single pool.

Dao Mian made a quick calculation and nodded.

"Many thanks, fellow Daoist!"

With that settled, Li Ximing moved on.

"Then where is this Small Guang Kong Mountain?"

Bao Xiang, who was standing to the side, spoke up immediately.

"Further west. It's no place of any fame. It's just that Host Shehu of De'ai Temple, shamelessly clinging to the name, trying to associate himself with Little Mountain of Vast Jade."

Li Ximing grew suspicious.

"I heard it was a temple... Does it have any connection to Buddhist cultivators?"
Bao Xiang didn't seem to notice his odd tone and smiled.

"Not much. It's called De'ai Temple because Host Shehu was suppressed by a Maha from the Way of Emptiness for many years. He only escaped during a period of turmoil and has held a grudge ever since. So, he established this De'ai Temple. He treats the monks as slaves and takes the nuns as concubines. It's his... unique preference."

Li Ximing's expression turned strange. He hesitated, but Bao Xiang continued, speaking as if it were common knowledge.

"He has a taste for human hearts. He often sends the nuns to lure men into... copulation. After they have made love three times and the man's vital blood is hot, he immediately carves out the heart and plunges it into ice water. Then he slices it thin. When he picks it up with his chopsticks, the juices flow. It's said to be fresh, fragrant, crisp, and utterly delicious. Fortunately, he doesn't often go on a killing spree for blood; he's quite restrained. His reputation is actually decent. Many call him a 'good man'."

Li Ximing shook his head.

"What a 'good man'."

Perhaps sensing the tone in his voice, Bao Xiang glanced at Dao Mian, then felt compelled to add,

"The Western Sea is barren. When you stand so high, your food and clothes are bound to be stained with blood. Shehu doesn't meddle with those beneath him, so De'ai Temple is actually... less bloody than most."

Bao Xiang was still young. Hearing this, Dao Mian quickly chimed in.

"Every realm has its rules. Back when the Immortal Mansion ruled, even entering the mortal world to govern was considered a demonic act. The lines are truly blurred."

Li Ximing hadn't expected his casual remark to provoke such an explanation. He smiled.

"Zhaojing has no authority to correct the world's morals. I just wonder... how powerful is this Host Shehu? And how many friends does he have?"

Only then did a trace of hatred surface in Dao Mian's eyes.

"That Demon's connections run deep. He's good friends with Chi She, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the West Mansion Grotto Sect. That's the biggest problem. It could drag in several other Purple Mansion experts. Even if you catch them when they're out, Chi She is almost always at the sect. He _must_ be dealt with."

"There's also an old early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Demon in Fangya Province. And Daoist Xie Hu, a mid-stage expert from Tanping Desert, owes him a favor... There may be more."

Listening to the list, Li Ximing felt a headache coming on. Bao Xiang had gone completely silent, letting Dao Mian, who held the grudge, do the talking. It was clear she wanted no part in this.

'If all of them show up... success will be uncertain, but it will definitely be a world-shaking battle. Everyone for leagues around will know...'

He fell silent, but Dao Mian spoke again, his voice low.

"If fellow Daoist is determined, though I am injured and cannot fight, I know an old enemy of the West Mansion Grotto Sect. He is called Yin Qin. He can hold off Chi She."

Li Ximing nodded slowly, a plan forming. He asked about the other mid-stage expert.

"This Daoist Xie Hu... what is he like?"

Dao Mian sighed.

"He is one of the few orthodox figures here. Though he cultivates the path of the Upper Shaman, he has a noble heart and doesn't touch blood-qi. He dislikes Shehu, but he values relationships and honors his word above all. Even as my friend, I know he cannot be persuaded or moved on this."

His face was lined with worry. He wasn't trying to incite Li Ximing out of personal hatred; he was giving a genuine warning.

"He is the most formidable cultivator to rise in the Western Sea in years. His cultivation is advancing rapidly. If fellow Daoist insists on killing Shehu in front of him, you will make a terrible enemy... That would not be good for your future."

Li Ximing listened to it all, his plan solidifying. He smiled.

"That's easily handled. I have a way to ensure he won't be able to interfere."

ps: Host Shehu is at De'ai Temple. Baiyan Temple, which appeared once before, is a different place and has been corrected.




# Chapter 1124: The Vassal's Inscription

Spiritual Qi surged through the ethereal clouds and mist.

Blazing radiance flickered between toppled jade pillars. Steps that seemed carved from white jade glowed faintly. Li Minggong ascended them all, reaching the peak. She turned slightly, a perfectly measured smile gracing her stunning features.

"Please wait for a moment, Your Lordship. King Wei will be here shortly."

The Daoist Master behind her, clad in green robes with a gourd and scroll at his waist, wore a solemn expression. It was none other than Daoist Master Qinghu, Sima Yuanli.

"Of course… of course…"

Sima Yuanli quickly agreed. He watched her depart before beginning to pace the mountaintop.

He had visited this place more than once but seldom had a moment to appreciate it so idly. Truthfully, the Li family's Gardenia Scenery Mountain was not overwhelmingly powerful—its formations were merely at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Yet, it possessed an undeniable grace, a profound calm and presence that spoke of a lineage risen from chaotic times.

Just like the woman who had just left.

He meandered, gaze drifting. Rounding a slight bend, he found the central pillar gleaming with a bright light. He looked closer and saw a line of words carved into it, the handwriting resolute and powerful.

"The great desert wall has crumbled, making it arduous to gather qi. Should I fall, Heavenly Light will converge, sands will smoke, and Radiant Essence will overflow. I have bound it with a formation for the benefit of later generations."

"Li Clan Disciple, Ximing."

Sima Yuanli stared, momentarily stunned. A storm of complex emotions washed over him as a realization dawned. Only now did he understand how ignorant his bewilderment had been all those years ago, sitting in his sect, when he first heard of Li Ximing's achievements.

'That day, I looked down upon the world's heroes and thought them lacking. I never knew that talents were rising everywhere, swimming hidden in the abyss, sacrificing everything for the chance at a single, glorious leap!'

He was so lost in his silence, so staggered by this revelation, that he failed to immediately notice the young man stepping through the air to stand upon the mountain. He froze, then swiftly turned, his face once more arranging itself into a respectful smile.

"Greetings, King Wei!"

The young man looked as though he had just emerged from seclusion. He slowly opened a pair of golden eyes, and one could faintly perceive flames surging within them, blazing with power.

"There is no need for such ceremony."

Sima Yuanli smiled and went to greet him. Li Zhouwei, seeing him approach, spoke softly:

"I asked you to come, Daoist Master, for two matters."

"First, This King must make a trip to the Western Sea. Please inform the Grand General to maintain strict vigilance against Zhao and Shu."

If Li Suining had not already verified this matter, Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing would never have felt at ease leaving Moongaze Lake at the same time. But even so, the necessary arrangements could not be neglected.

"Second, I need to borrow the Huai River Map."

Almost before the words had left his lips, Daoist Master Qinghu naturally untied the scroll from his waist. He held it forth in both hands without a moment's hesitation or thought, presenting it to Li Zhouwei.

"Qinghu shall obey the King's command."

A flash of interest flickered in Li Zhouwei's golden eyes. He realized the Daoist Master before him had been prepared for this—perhaps ever since Vast Cicada's fall, he had been waiting for him, King Wei, to come and 'borrow' the Huai River Map.

Yet, even when faced with such an ultimate treasure of the Bright Yang, not a trace of greed showed in those golden eyes.

"Do not worry. When the matter is concluded, I will certainly return it to Daoist friend Qinghu—and the proper compensation will not be forgotten."

He took it casually, holding it in one hand. He raised it before him and gave it a gentle shake.

_Shhhla!_

The satin-like cord binding the scroll instantly dissolved. A brilliant, warm, and gentle radiance flared as the Spiritual Treasure revealed its true form!

Vast river waters surged and swelled. The brushwork moved like waves, like a Flood Dragon, a tempest of tumbling billows. It felt less like unrolling a map and more like unfurling a stretch of endless, pure white. The roar of a mighty river instantly echoed in his ears. But then, a Heavenly Light burst forth, a majestic pass rose, and an imposing city wall stood firm within the river, unmoving against the raging torrents.

A few lines of golden light appeared at the end of the scroll.

Sima Yuanli's gaze twitched as if he had seen something terrifying. A hint of panic flickered in his eyes, and he quickly looked down at the ground.

This artifact had been in his possession for decades, and its inscription had always read:

Huai River Map. Cui Yan of Boye. The 317th year of Zhenghe.

The characters were stark and distinct, without the slightest error—it was the handwriting of a True Monarch! It had not changed in a thousand years!
But as King Wei unrolled the map, an unprecedented, dense web of golden patterns spread over the scroll's edges. The golden characters of the inscription at the end lit up, one by one:

'Huai River Map. Your humble subject, Cui Yan, crafted this in the 317th year of Zhenghe.'

…

The sky and clouds were one, bathed in brilliant light.

The darkness of the Great Void was suddenly torn apart. Pale yellow light spilled through as a Daoist strolled out. His robes were immaculate, his demeanor perfectly calm. He trod upon the shifting, ephemeral light of the Lesser Yang, which tumbled and rolled beneath him. He drifted to a stop above the sea surface and smiled.

"Old senior… this is the Western Sea!"

Only then did an old man hurry out from behind him. His face was a little pale, and he looked weather-beaten. His somewhat cloudy eyes swept their surroundings.

"This old man has spent his life drifting through the Eastern Sea, but this is a true feast for the eyes. I'm afraid I'll need some guidance from you, Daoist friend."

These words made the Lesser Yang-cultivating Daoist Master smile and shake his head.

"Old senior jests. Nanwu has only accompanied a disciple-brother here once, so I am hardly familiar with it. We shall just have to see what arrangements senior Zhaojing has made."

The two were precisely Guo Nanwu and Yan Dushui!

After Li Ximing had settled his affairs, he spent some time in the Western Sea, hoping to drum up some pill-refining business. He had given Guo Nanwu a command token and sent him on a trip to the Eastern Sea.

But having Guo Nanwu be the one to handle this had given Yan Dushui quite a start.

The Guo family had once taken refuge in the outer seas. The West Curtain Sea, where Yan Dushui resided, was one of the closest locations to the outer seas, and he actually recognized Guo Nanwu!

'I heard… he is practically a disciple of that Great Daoist Master from Mount Qusi.'

He, Yan Dushui, was old, but he certainly knew of Mount Qusi! To put it bluntly, that immortal mountain was a top-tier Daoist tradition in the entire Southern Sea, and it was faintly backed by an ancient inheritance. While it couldn't compare to the Nine Mounds… it wasn't far off!

In truth, Guo Nanwu's status was far from low—much higher than his own. This old Daoist Master had lived in seclusion for many years, and plying Guo Nanwu for news along the journey had left him reeling.

'That Li Zhouwei obtained the King Wei title… he's already that formidable?'

After their long journey, his expression had grown solemn. He drifted down into the mountains. When he saw Li Ximing approaching to greet him, Yan Dushui's smile broadened, and he hurried to speak.

"Daoist friend Zhaojing, long time no see!"

A hot wind rustled through the mountains, where tall pill furnaces stood. Rolling flames leaped at their bases, casting colorful light. The Daoist Master looked over with a smile. After a few pleasantries, his expression shifted to one of surprise and emotion.

"Senior Yan… you have truly toiled these past years!"

He had seen Yan Dushui years ago when he visited the Nine Mounds. He had seemed much older than their very first meeting. Time had flown by, and seeing him again, things were different once more.

Although the old man's face had not changed much, when Li Ximing activated his Life Divine Ability and simulated the Light of the Six Harmonies, he immediately sensed that something was wrong.

'His vital essence is blazing, visible even outside his physical form. His divine ability is brilliant, but it fluctuates erratically within his six senses… He must be using some spiritual object to cling to life… His days are numbered!'

Noticing the deep emotion in Li Ximing's expression, Yan Dushui shook his head.

"To see the mortal world's great seas and famous mountains before I fall is an excellent thing."

They chatted for a moment before Yan Dushui's face filled with guilt.

"I promised to take action for you back then, Daoist friend. Who knew my body would fail so quickly? I am not of much use now, but I will do my best!"

Li Ximing sighed.

"Senior's Dharma body is unwell. To engage in battle would burn through your life-mandate at an alarming rate. How could Zhaojing turn a blind eye? Please, do not mention it again!"

This deeply moved Yan Dushui, though it also left his thoughts more muddled.

"But I have already crossed ten thousand li to come here…"

Li Ximing shook his head gravely and asked, "Senior mentioned long ago that our two families share ancient kinship. Are you willing to speak of your arrangements? Which of your disciples is cultivating in the Nine Mounds? If I should encounter them in the future, I can look after them."

Yan Dushui hadn't crossed ten thousand li just to see the sights. He had come, first, to repay a favor, and second, to settle his final affairs. Li Ximing's words were spoken with such consideration that the old man's eyes reddened.

"Zhaojing… such high-minded righteousness… I only regret that Lin Yi did not know you sooner… Now I have no way to repay you…"

Seeing Li Ximing wave his hand dismissively, Yan Dushui did not delay.

"That child of mine is named Yan Chuan. He is a disciple under cultivator Cao Tingwen of the Nine Mounds' Zhiyan Peak. The Nine Mounds will provide him with spiritual objects. If he fails to break through, he will return to my tradition to find new disciples. As for my life's wealth, it is all deposited with the Nine Mounds…"

Li Ximing nodded.

"If this child achieves a divine ability, will he be counted as a disciple of the Nine Mounds?"

Yan Dushui fell silent for a moment before saying, his voice thick with tears, 

"He should be… But according to the rules of the immortal mountain, if he fully enters the Nine Mounds, he can no longer manage his clansmen below. Several hundred thousand of my disciples are on the sea. While their lives won't be in danger… I fear their future development will be entirely out of his control!"

After all, those people were still under the banner of the Nine Mounds, so they wouldn't be snatched up and eaten by some Demon beast. But how Yan Chuan would view his own clan in the future was truly hard to say.

Li Ximing paused, adopting a pensive look.

"I have an idea."

Yan Dushui looked up, his eyes filled with hope.

"Why not find another way out for your esteemed clan?" Li Ximing said. "I've heard there is a Daoist Master Xie Hu in the Tanping Desert. He is an upright man with a high cultivation, and he is known for honoring his promises. He seems especially suitable."

Yan Dushui was not without other contingency plans; he had disciples placed elsewhere. He had originally hoped Mount Qusi would be willing to accept a Yan clan disciple, but now this unrelated name had appeared. And yet, he found his heart stirring.

'Far away in the Western Sea is even better… If I can find a Daoist Master like this as a backer and bring a few disciples over, that would be a fine escape route.'

He sighed.

"I am utterly destitute. The only Valley Water I have left is for the younger generation. The only thing I have to offer is this broken old body…"

To extend these last few years of his life, Yan Dushui had exhausted nearly every spiritual resource he possessed. Li Ximing, however, spoke with a serious expression.

"I know a Daoist Master Dao Mian who has a good relationship with Xie Hu. You can use his introduction to pay him a visit."

The Daoist Master smiled.

"Do you remember that place where the 'Exiled Qi' spiritual object is stored?"

Understanding dawned on Yan Dushui. He said thoughtfully, "This…"

Li Ximing smiled.

"That cave-mansion is preserved by 'Exiled Qi'. Apart from your family's secret method, no one can find it. Even if you lead them there, they forget the location the moment they turn away… Not only is it filled with all kinds of yin qi, it also contains ancient shamanic patterns from the Underworld!"

"This Daoist Master Xie Hu cultivates 'Upper Shaman,' so his Daoist tradition can be said to fall within the Underworld's sphere. He is also a man intent on seeking the Dao. If you tell him of this, how could his heart not be moved? Regardless of whether it's useful to him, he will certainly go and take a look. If it proves to be of great use, the grace of attaining the Dao is as heavy as Mount Tai! What is taking one disciple in comparison? Even if you asked him to kill someone for you… it would not be impossible!"

Yan Dushui stared blankly, silent for a long time before muttering,

"True… I am a dying man, so I have no fear of him trying to force the secret method from me… The Yan family is also under the protection of the Nine Mounds, so I don't need to fear his schemes…"

"And the incense in that cave mansion is almost gone. Once it burns out, the place cannot be found even with the secret method. There is no benefit for him to be ungrateful…"

Li Ximing smiled.

"You need not worry about that. I have been here for several months and have heard of this Daoist Master Xie Hu's reputation. He opened a mystic realm with others, and his word is his bond. A Daoist friend who accompanied him fell within, but to honor a promise, he was willing to travel a thousand li to deliver even the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness to that man's descendants."

"I saw him again later and refined a pill for him. He even questioned me in detail about Mount Wu!"

Yan Dushui was skeptical of such rumors, but a light gradually kindled in his eyes as he listened to Li Ximing's ambiguous smile.

"It's the perfect opportunity to invite him back, let him tour the Eastern Sea, and pick a junior he finds most pleasing to be his disciple…"

"Exactly!" Yan Dushui looked deeply moved. "Many thanks to Daoist friend for the guidance!"

But once the words of thanks were spoken, Yan Dushui's mind raced. He didn't believe for a second that this was about any deep feelings between their families. Li Ximing was helping him for a reason; he clearly wanted something. That line about 'killing someone' sparked a thought.

'What do I have that's worth him coveting? It's nothing more than a favor from this Daoist Master Xie Hu.'

Yan Dushui spoke.

"Daoist friend, you are so considerate of me, I must repay this kindness! But as for killing someone… I am old. I do not wish to create more enemies for my descendants. However, if a disciple of my clan successfully enters his tutelage, and Daoist Master Xie Hu gains from his trip to the east, he will surely owe a favor. I will definitely have him repay this kindness to you, Daoist friend!"

Li Ximing waved his hand and smiled.

"Daoist friend, you are too polite. If we can truly gain a favor from Daoist Master Xie Hu, and the Li family draws closer to him, how could your esteemed clan's disciple… not receive more favorable treatment?"

If Xie Hu was truly as loyal and righteous as claimed, a disciple under his wing would have no need for such a favor. It was far better to trade it to the Li family. The two of them reached a silent, mutual understanding. Yan Dushui immediately prioritized this matter, saying solemnly,

"I shall go pay him a visit right now?"

Li Ximing smiled faintly.

This was a matter that truly only he, Li Ximing, could have orchestrated. Only he and Yan Dushui had entered that place together and understood what it contained. And as someone within the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, who had connections to both the Great Xiukui Monastery and the imperial scions of the Underworld, he understood better than anyone how precious that cave mansion truly was!

'Apart from Yan Dushui, no one else can find that place. But I have the Immortal Mirror. As long as I've been there once and know the general direction, I can find it again… I just have to wait for Que'Wan to reach the next stage, and I can let her take a look.'

He swirled the contents of his cup.

'Yan Dushui doesn't have the Profound Mystery incense; he can only enter one last time. My family, however, has some…'

For some reason, the terrifying image of the Middle Vast Jade Mountain flashed before his eyes. Once bitten, twice shy. The memory made him hesitate.

'Many things in this world are better left unknown… That place… It's best to get the secret method from Yan Dushui's own mouth, to have a perfectly justifiable reason. Besides, once the Profound Mystery incense burns out, the cave mansion will disperse. I can't let him use up that final wisp. That way, I'll have a chance to replenish it in the future.'

He took a sip of tea and smiled.

"Just one thing. If this matter succeeds, I hope Daoist friend will leave a thread of opportunity. Do not let the cave mansion dissipate entirely. My family has a junior who cultivates shamanic arts. If she can reach the Purple Mansion Realm, I hope she, too, can enter and take a look."

This made Yan Dushui's eyes light up. He nodded in pleasant surprise.

"That would be Que'Wan, correct? She is in seclusion at the Nine Mounds. I heard that great personage mention her. A true genius! What wonderful fate, wonderful fate. I will remember this."

Seeing him so eager to forge more connections, Li Ximing chuckled. He found Dao Mian and sent the two on their way. Only then did he quietly pace back to his courtyard. He refilled his own cup with clear tea and smiled to himself.

'There was no need to clash with him head-on, and no need to persuade him with great wealth. If all goes smoothly, I'll be the one earning a favor from him.'




# Chapter 1125: Taking Action

Li Ximing finished his arrangements. He settled cross-legged on the mountain, closed his eyes, and began refining a batch of pills. Light and shadow intertwined around him. Soon, there was a disturbance. A hot gust of wind swept in, and a faint golden light sprinkled down upon the wards. At the same time, the jade pendant at his waist pulsed with intense heat.

'Minghuang is here!'

A smile touched Li Ximing's lips as he rose, treading on the light. As expected, the clouds and mist parted to reveal a young man descending from the sky. He wore a black robe adorned with golden patterns, his long hair tied back simply. His features were majestic, and his bright golden eyes radiated a fierce, soul-shaking pressure. A pale white scroll was fastened at his waist.

Daoist Master Bao Xiang had moved even faster, already waiting in the air. Her cultivation was in Pit Water, which was deeply incompatible with Bright Yang. A single glance at the newcomer sent her divine abilities screaming in warning, filling her with an unprecedented sense of crisis. Her expression was a mixture of awe and dread. When she saw Li Ximing approach, she quickly took a step back.

"So, it is King Wei..."

Li Ximing laughed heartily, introduced Bao Xiang with a flick of his sleeve, and then led Li Zhouwei inside. The Daoist Master hastily spoke,

"This junior failed to welcome you from afar... please, do not take offense..."

Li Ximing had learned a few things during his stay. Based on Daoist Master Bao Xiang's seniority, she was indeed from the same generation as Jiangqian. Calling herself "junior" was not mere politeness. He smiled and led them into the mountain. After a few brief pleasantries, the Daoist Master tactfully excused herself, leaving the two to talk privately. Li Ximing then began.

"Everything is settled. And I've received some good news."

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei asked with a smile. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"On the coast of the Western Sea, near the Abyss of Weak Water, there's an old rogue cultivator. He's in desperate need of a Precious Heart Mystic Swan Pill. When he heard I was here, he traveled all this way to find me. And, according to him... he has a Verdant Profound Sarcophagus."

A thoughtful look crossed Li Zhouwei's face.

"I've heard of it. It's a Water Mansion spiritual object, not particularly famous, nor does it have many uses. It was supposedly recovered from an immortal cave in the Western Sea. The best part, however... is that there wasn't just one."

He sighed.

"I assumed the Western Sea, being one of the Four Seas, would have _something_. But after a tour, 'barren' is the only word for it. It's slightly better than Zhulu, I suppose, with a few more Water Mansion spiritual objects. But the environment is harsh, and betrayal is rampant. Aside from a handful of truly powerful figures, the vast majority of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators dare not leave the protection of their own Dao Lineage."

"Their divine abilities are so weak they can't even establish a Purple Mansion grand array. They can only resort to underhanded schemes to gather resources. As for Purple Mansion-grade spiritual objects... those are mostly found in ancient immortal caves."

"That particular immortal cave only emerged a few years ago. The spiritual object was suppressed by the cave's grand array. There were five of them in total, and they were divided among five Daoist Masters."

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei already understood his intention.

"Since there are several of them, and it's a Water Mansion spiritual object only recently acquired... Grand-Uncle, you're planning to use the Piting Qingyuan Treasure Cauldron."

Li Ximing nodded with a smile.

"The beauty of it is... that Host Shehu also has a Verdant Profound Sarcophagus. The rogue cultivator who approached me intends to trade for it. As for the others, Daoist Master Bao Xiang has one, and our soon-to-be-helper, the rogue cultivator Yin Qin, has another."

"We don't need all four. If we can get just three of them into the Spiritual Artifact and let it nurture and refine them for a few years, we'll undoubtedly get a portion of spiritual water!"

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully, but Li Ximing's expression turned serious.

"I also made inquiries. Legend says the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus is born from Profound Coffin Crimson Water. If we could refine the Profound Coffin Crimson Water itself... that would be a different matter entirely."

"This Profound Coffin Crimson Water is a treasure of water and wood from the lake. It holds the marvel of transformation and the virtue of nurturing. It's incredibly useful, whether for refining Spiritual Artifacts, constructing precious arrays, or even practicing spell arts."

Li Zhouwei didn't comment further, simply nodding in acknowledgment. He changed the subject.

"This Shehu... what is his strength?"

Li Ximing shook his head with a smile.

"I've asked around. He has two Upright Wood divine abilities, but no Life Divine Ability. And I have the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire. I estimate he can't even defeat me."

After a moment's thought, he sighed.

"The problem is our ally, the rogue cultivator Yin Qin. He's the one facing the West Mansion Grotto Sect. The risk is enormous—he's up against Chi She, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and there's no telling who else is in their stronghold. So, he made a demand. If this succeeds, he wants half of everything we get from Shehu."

When Li Zhouwei frowned, Li Ximing explained seriously.

"He's the only Western Sea cultivator willing to get involved, and he'll take the public fallout. No one else would. This way, the official story is that he hired us. The West Mansion Grotto Sect is currently powerful... it's far better to let him be the one to offend them and take the heat. There's no need to drag Moongaze Lake into this."

This reasoning, centered on the clan's future, made Li Zhouwei nod. He recalled some news he'd received before departing and understood.

'So that's how it is. In a remote place like the Western Sea, Shehu is hiding a spiritual root. This Yin Qin must have sensed it and has been plotting to kill him for his treasure all along, just waiting for an opportunity. Everyone is scheming.'

As he was pondering, a faint sound echoed from the mountain. A brilliant multicolored light flared, and Daoist Master Dao Mian returned. He stopped at the foot of the steps, staring at Li Zhouwei with a strange expression.

"Greetings, King Wei."

The Daoist Master's pupils glittered, a clear sign of some unusual cultivated art. He bowed slightly, only straightening up after Li Zhouwei acknowledged him. Then, he smiled.

"Congratulations, Zhaojing! When Daoist Friend Xie heard the good news, he was overjoyed. He started calling Daoist Friend Yan 'Old Senior' and has already settled his affairs in the Western Sea and headed east."

This Daoist Master Dao Mian still looked curious, clearly wondering what great benefit Yan Dushui had offered to make Xie Hu leave so readily. Li Ximing, however, was not surprised. He stood up and smiled.

"Daoist friend, what about your Yin Qin?"

Daoist Master Dao Mian clasped his hands.

"He has already been informed. He is just waiting for your word, Daoist friend!"

"Excellent! The matter is settled!"

Li Ximing smiled and nodded. He strode out and summoned Guo Nanwu, explaining the plan in front of everyone.

"Host Shehu has three allies. Daoist Master Xie Hu has departed and is no longer a factor. The threat from the West Mansion Grotto Sect—namely, the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator Chi She—will be handled by Yin Qin. The Demon beasts of Fangya Province, I am leaving to Nanwu."

Guo Nanwu nodded, accepting the assignment. Daoist Master Dao Mian also nodded, looking quite satisfied. Li Ximing continued.

"He may yet have other allies we don't know about. To prevent any surprises, King Wei and I will move together to suppress this fiend!"

Given Li Zhouwei's current power, second only to a Great Daoist Master, Li Ximing's arrangement was anything but careless.

Delays breed complications. The words had barely faded when Li Ximing acted, showing no hesitation. He and the others took to the wind, soaring up and vanishing into the Great Void. The three of them scattered. Daoist Master Dao Mian, meanwhile, retrieved a jade talisman and crushed it, sending the signal to Yin Qin.

Only then did Daoist Master Bao Xiang enter from the courtyard. She paced the garden a few steps as she listened to Daoist Master Dao Mian sigh.

"They always say mainland cultivators are rigid and old-fashioned, but every one I've met is anything but. Even without this Yan Dushui, given their wealth and position at the center of the world, it wouldn't have been difficult for them to summon another mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to deal with Xie Hu. But their _method_ of handling him... it truly reveals how skilled these righteous paths are at protecting their reputations."

Bao Xiang, being more familiar with Jiangnan, smiled.

"The mainland is full of rules. Dealing with an enemy, as they just did with Xie Hu, plays right into the strengths of their so-called righteous path. My master once said, 'The true skill lies in wielding righteousness.' Anyone can be unscrupulous. Who among those who have achieved a divine ability isn't ruthless at heart?"

"That doesn't mean he is so capable. It's his position at the heart of the world, giving him the resources and information to mobilize others..."

Daoist Master Dao Mian seemed to recall something. A profound desolation and despair settled on his old features. On the verge of tears, he said,

"Easier said than done. We stay in the Western Sea, free from the constraints of the mainland's great powers, and we think we're clever... but when the time comes... you don't even know what killed you."

"My Xinggong Terrace... that is how it fell!"

---

De'ai Temple.

Small Guang Kong Mountain was no grand spiritual peak. In truth, the entire Western Sea had few such places. The territories of these powerful cultivators were usually just called provinces or islands; even Xie Hu resided in the Tanping Desert.

Host Shehu had moved Small Guang Kong Mountain here himself. Few in this region were proficient in the Dao of mountain-moving, and with the Western Sea being so remote, he hadn't been able to transport anything of quality. It was a mountain in shape only, its scattered temples buffeted by gusts of black wind.

Decadent sounds drifted from the 'Hall of Listening' high on the peak. Inside, two rows of nuns stood in shackles, burdened with stones and satchels of earth. A dark-red table sat in the center. A naked woman shuffled forward on her knees, fished a round object from a bowl of ice water, sliced it meticulously, and placed it in a small bowl. She then picked up a piece with chopsticks and fed it to the middle-aged man seated before her.

The man had a benevolent face with a slightly pointed chin and wore the robes of an abbot. A faint, pleasant smile played on his lips. His throat bobbed as he swallowed, and he let out a breath.

It was none other than Host Shehu.

Shehu was not native to the Western Sea. He was a Demon cultivator from the north, having practiced on the fringes of the Feather-Shedding Land in the Northern Sea. Thanks to a remarkable bloodline, excellent talent, and the grace of his ancestors, he had received a spiritual object from the Tree of One Heart. After enduring countless years, he finally achieved the Dao.

But after achieving the Dao, he grew arrogant. While traveling in the Eastern Sea, he was suppressed in a secret location by Maha Shejie of the Kosa Temple Sect. He was imprisoned for a century, forced to listen to endless scriptures until his mind was broken. He later escaped during a great upheaval, stealing Maha Shejie's spiritual root treasure tree, but he could never escape the scriptures' influence. For a time, he retained some clarity and knew he needed to cultivate a Life Divine Ability. But after decades of failure, Shehu grew increasingly listless.

Shehu found everything dull and meaningless.

'Life ends in death. What is the point of it all?'

Only his hatred for Shejie remained, fueling his atrocities at De'ai Temple as he coldly watched the nuns suffer. Just then, a man in green robes approached, knelt in the hall, and spoke.

"Host... a Daoist Master is outside. He says he's from Jiangnan... an old acquaintance of Daoist Master Yuanxiu. He wishes to speak with you in detail."

The Demon beast raised an eyebrow.

"Yuanxiu? ...He must have something of the Upright Wood Dao to trade with me."

The cultivation method for the Life Divine Ability he possessed had come from Yuanxiu, so the name was familiar. He felt no particular greed, but decided he might as well see him. Picking up the plate from the table, he rose and left the hall. Down at the base of the mountain, he saw a Daoist Master standing there as promised.

Li Ximing, in turn, was studying him. He noted the Demon's kind, benevolent features and his clear gaze. If not for the plate of sliced, blood-dripping heart and liver in his hands, he might have truly passed for a benevolent man.

Li Ximing had no intention of wasting time. He smiled.

"Daoist friend, watch closely!"

He rolled up his sleeve. The various spiritual flames within his body converged in his palm, condensed by the Valley Wind Guide-Fire. He raised a simple, unadorned hand and struck straight at the Demon beast's face.

"You... I...?"

Even with his thousand years of cultivation, Shehu had never encountered such a bizarre situation. This cultivator from Jiangnan had crossed thousands of miles, said "Watch closely," and then, without using any spell arts or Spiritual Artifacts, simply tried to slap him in the face!

"Ah?"

But his shock lasted only an instant. His divine abilities sensed the danger radiating from that palm, even though the hand itself looked as gentle as jade, devoid of any powerful aura. A flash of rage cut through Shehu's confusion.

'Don't tell me Body of Kui cultivators still exist!'

He lacked a Life Divine Ability, but he could still recognize a mortal threat. He instantly opened his mouth and spat out a cyan-yellow light.

It was a bronze basin the size of a human face, ancient and deeply patinated. It was etched with profound patterns, and illusory cyan sparrows wheeled above it, weaving and leaping with brilliant, shifting colors.

Boom!

Li Ximing's long-gathering palm strike landed squarely in the basin, erupting like a dense firestorm. The bronze basin shook violently, glowing red-hot, and visibly swelled as it attempted to contain and absorb all the flames.

It actually had qualities reminiscent of the Buddhist cultivators.

Li Ximing's palm strike was pure fire control, built up over a long time. It was most devastating when landing on a physical body. Even so, it wasn't something Shehu could block just by spitting out a Spiritual Artifact in a panic.

The various spiritual flames were all constrained, save for one bright white radiance that erupted forth:

The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire!

Shehu clearly recognized the infamous flame—or at least knew that no Merging Fire was ever good news. His expression twisted. He crushed a jade talisman as the illusory light of his Upright Wood Dao flared around him, solidifying like gold. He abruptly clasped his hands.

"Journeying North!"

In an instant, endless gales and lightning filled the world, converging and sweeping in. The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire flared brightly but began to sputter and scatter, buffeted by the wind. The Demon's own form became ethereal and light, allowing him to drift just outside the raging torrent of fire.

'Journeying North... so it commands wind and thunder to evade fire!'

Li Ximing had discussed this Dao with Sima Yuanli before, so he understood its principles instantly. He withdrew his palm with a trace of regret, but a beam of Heavenly Light was already descending from the sky, manifesting as a brilliant Celestial Gate that crashed down on Shehu.

'Not good! This is a killing blow!'

Shehu's eyes widened, and a cold sweat broke out on his brow. His face turned grim. With no time to prepare, he decisively raised his hand and drew out a talisman.

The Dao-Valley Profound-Color Talisman.

He had acquired it years ago as a life-saving measure. Keenly sensing his opponent had come prepared, he used it without hesitation. His body instantly dissolved into a surge of roiling Valley Water.

The scenery warped around him. Before Shehu could even take a breath, another Celestial Gate descended from the heavens. This one was translucent as jade, radiating a pure, white radiance, and it expanded rapidly in his disbelieving eyes.

It was even more domineering and terrifying than the last!

'There's another one!'

The Heavenly Light blazed, scattering the clouds. High in the sky, a young man stood clad in Qilin-scale profound armor, a halberd in his grip. The scroll in his other hand was wide open, unleashing a cascading waterfall of brilliant colors from the heavens.

The Bright Yang Spiritual Treasure, the Huai River Map!




# Chapter 1126: The Treasure Urn

Shehu might not have possessed great skill, but after so many years of cultivation, he had developed a discerning eye. How could he fail to recognize the treasure in the sky? Terror seized his heart.

"Great Daoist Masters," he cried, "could there be a misunderstanding? I have cultivated in this place for many years and have never given any offense!"

Though his words begged for mercy, his actions were decisive. With a rapid flip, his brown robes tore apart as he transformed on the spot, swelling into a brown-feathered swan as vast as a mountain. Beneath his plumage, however, was a pair of vicious talons. His pupils were vertical slits, radiating a fierce, wolf-like cruelty.

This Demon beast's bloodline was clearly impressive. His transformation made the earth tremble and the mountains shake. Revealing a blood-red underbelly, he planted his talons beneath the Celestial Gate, attempting to heave it upward.

But the man in black armor stood atop the Celestial Gate, as immovable as Mount Taishi itself. No matter what divine ability Shehu unleashed, he could not budge the gate a single inch.

As that resplendent divine ability bore down, the scroll in the man's hand flared to life!

"Rumble!"

Beneath the mighty celestial pass, countless jagged peaks erupted from the earth—shards of white stone, sharp as swords. A powerful Bright Yang intent manifested as bells and drums chimed in unison. A river, winding through the newly formed peaks, cascaded down, locking Shehu's divine ability in place from every direction!

Shehu's face went visibly pale.

'This is bad... a fatal disaster!'

He had no time to think. A faint, authoritative whisper sounded in his ear, and the world around him visibly distorted. A flame so bright he couldn't open his eyes surged inward, about to engulf his dharma body.

Shehu possessed the technique 'Journeying North', which was supernaturally effective at evading fire. But this divine ability had a critical flaw—'Journeying North' relied on movement. Once he was suppressed and sealed off, disconnected from heaven and earth, he could no longer evade the flames!

A bone-deep chill seized him. His massive form instantly shrank, reforming into his human body. He quickly waved a sleeve, and a walnut-sized pearl dropped from his cuff. It spun, blooming with shields of green light to block the inferno.

His 'Upright Wood' took its aspect from metal; it was a wood-virtue power that feared fire the least. But this was the notorious Merging Fire! The green light immediately withered in the raging blaze, dissolving into coiling wisps of black smoke.

The Demon beast was horrified.

"High Immortals!" he screamed. "Where have I given offense? Is some villain framing me?"

There was no reply from outside. The flames merely trembled, and a golden gleam suddenly leaped out from within!

It was a long halberd, shimmering with light, its curved blade gleaming like the moon.

Shehu frantically waved his sleeve, summoning the copper basin. He heard a shattering sound. From beneath the heavy, shrouding copper light, a second halberd-shadow leaped out and smashed against the green light.

"Crack!"

His precious pearl was only a spirit embryo. It was already fading at a terrifying rate against the Merging Fire; how could it possibly withstand such a blow? It shattered into fragments. The flames surged forward, rushing to consume him.

He was struck with terror. He opened his massive mouth, revealing rows of densely packed fangs. Within that maw was a hellscape: rivers of blood, towers of bone, roiling yin souls, and the sound of countless wails!

The great Demon gathered the power and then blew.

"AOOO!"

A shriek like grinding metal and crashing thunder ripped through heaven and earth. Billowing yin qi erupted, finally causing the infinitely bright Celestial Gate to waver. Li Zhouwei finally gave the Demon a proper look.

"It seems," he nodded, "your thousand years weren't cultivated in vain."

Li Ximing, circulating his Life Divine Ability, also saw the attack's nature clearly and nodded in silent agreement.

Had it not been for the joint suppression of the divine ability and the Spiritual Treasure, that yin shriek was formidable. It would have forced even Li Ximing to halt his attack and defend with all his might. If caught off guard, he could have been injured!

Dense golden patterns lit up on Li Zhouwei's face. He set the long halberd to hang unsupported in the sky, then pressed both hands firmly onto the Celestial Gate.

The wavering portal stabilized once more.

Shehu had clearly cultivated that mouthful of yin qi for untold years. It was as vast as a sea of smoke, as boundless as a desert. Even as the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire and 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' continuously wore it down, the space beneath the gate grew increasingly dark.

But that was all it could do.

The darkness lasted for the better part of an hour before finally receding. The Demon beast's voice, still probing while pretending to beg, sounded out again. Li Ximing couldn't help but remark,

"The coordination between the Huai River Map and 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' is... truly terrifying."

Li Ximing sighed, but Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"His technique isn't weak. Unfortunately, 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' innately suppresses yin and evil and dissolves resentment. If he were from a different Dao lineage, his war of attrition might have actually been able to budge my divine ability."

But inside the rolling Merging Fire, Shehu was weeping, his eyes streaming. Every part of his body was in agony. Hundreds of years of accumulated power were gone in an instant, his Dharma Arts completely exhausted. He finally stopped holding back.

"Since you've come from Jiangnan, you must know my past! The spirit root... I'll offer the spirit root to you both! I only beg you to spare my life!"

The Merging Fire blazed on, relentless. The divine ability overhead, amplified by the Spiritual Treasure, was omnipotent. No matter how he struggled, it didn't waver. As strand after strand of bright white flame licked at his dharma body, Shehu fell into complete despair.

'Bright Yang is tyrannical, Merging Fire is vicious... My life is over!'

How could he not know the power of Bright Yang? The reputation of 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' was immense. If his own divine ability surpassed the youth above him, or if he could at least fight to a draw, this technique would be nothing to fear. But he had fallen into a state where he was inferior in both divine ability and Dao-Profundity. Pinned beneath it, his prayers were useless, his calls unanswered!

'If it were any other divine ability, I could still struggle. But with this technique above me, and my only Valley Water talisman already used...'

Knowing his life was forfeit, he still cried out,

"I'll give you my wealth, my life! I only beg for a trace of my True Spirit to escape!"

While he suffered in agony, burned by the Merging Fire, Li Ximing stood outside, riding the Heavenly Light. With two fingers extended, he directed the flames, a note of pleasant surprise in his voice.

"A spirit root! He really did have something good!"

He didn't relax his guard for a moment. Watching the situation inside, he saw the Demon beast was truly at his limit. He couldn't help but sigh,

"That was almost too easy. I definitely over-planned."

Li Zhouwei, however, was not surprised. He carefully examined the Spiritual Treasure in his hand.

"I wouldn't call it easy. Grand-uncle and I attacked together, with both our Spiritual Treasures. Against a mere Demon King from a remote corner, of course it was a simple capture."

He added, "We just had to prevent him from trying to take us down with him."

The Merging Fire burned for another moment before Li Ximing finally transformed into Heavenly Light and descended into the blaze.

Since ascending to the divine ability realm, this was only the second time Shehu had felt such utter despair. It was just like that time beneath the pagoda of the seven-life Maha's calamity, with no chance of escape. The same despair and loneliness from all those years ago flooded his mind, making him tremble. Scriptures even began to echo in his ears.

"I submit... I submit! Please, let me out!"

It seemed his various attempts at bribery had failed, but this simple plea worked. The Merging Fire on all sides dissipated. Shehu, robes in tatters and body covered in gray ash, knelt beneath the divine ability's pressure.

Seeing Li Ximing tread upon the light and approach, he put on a tear-streaked expression, no longer asking questions.

"I am willing to be your beast of burden, my lord..."

Li Ximing shook his head.

"When your Demon race attains the Dao, your very spirit is refined into your divine ability. What power do I have to make you an ox or a horse? We are both beings who have achieved divine abilities. There's no need for such empty words."

Shehu saw that even now, Li Ximing wouldn't release the suppression. He wept, 

"High cultivator, you must want my wealth and my life. I will offer them with both hands. I only hope to escape with a wisp of my True Spirit. I can find any random Demon body to possess. Once I lose my divine ability, my spirit will naturally separate from my True Spirit. You can then take it, and I will pledge my loyalty to you, my lord."

He added, "This little Demon has cultivated for many years, my Dao-Profundity is not shallow. I'm confident I can handle any Foundation Establishment Realm foe... I can even help guide your lordship's juniors..."

Li Ximing just smiled.

"You make it sound so appealing. But how could changing bodies and abandoning your form be so simple? In any case, I didn't come here specifically to eliminate you."

Shehu tried to speak again, but Li Ximing raised his sleeve, pinched his fingers to form a divine ability, and projected it at the Demon, chanting:

"Curb weapons and halt all sharpness, let there be no treacherous assault!"

'World's Radiance'.

A dim golden light shone down, locking the Demon beast in place. But Shehu had no intention of submitting. His eyes hardened, and he tensed, about to struggle!

But in that short instant, an urn appeared in Li Ximing's hand.

Heavenly Nurture Urn.

Store and Combine!

A puff of dim radiance gushed from the urn's mouth, expanding rapidly. Like a great whale inhaling water, it locked onto the Demon beast on the ground. Shehu was already at the end of his rope, exhausted, and held fast by the Life Divine Ability. Powerless to resist, he was pulled in and fell inside.

"Clink."

The light of the brilliant copper basin faded, and the azure-glowing pearl went dim. Only the empty robes, wrapped around a storage bag, drifted down, floating in the Heavenly Light.

But as the profound art of Grand Sacrifice activated, Li Ximing didn't even have time to grab the Spiritual Artifact. He felt his divine ability and dharma power draining rapidly. The urn in his hand sank, as if he were holding a small mountain. It was still struggling, emitting dull thuds, and for a moment, he almost lost his grip.

He hurriedly sat cross-legged, circulating his divine ability to stabilize the Spiritual Treasure. The radiance in the sky quickly faded. Li Zhouwei retrieved his Spiritual Artifact, stepped down through the air, and seeing Li Ximing drenched in sweat, reached out to help him steady the urn.

A full incense stick's time passed. The Spiritual Treasure finally absorbed a massive amount of divine ability and dharma power from them both and grew quiet, having thoroughly sealed the great Demon within. It remained, however, as heavy as a mountain.

'It's done! An Azure Talisman!'

'My family's first self-refined Azure Talisman!'

Li Ximing let out a long breath, his joy overflowing. He smiled.

"What a good treasure!"

He peered inside. The interior was dim and gloomy. The densely packed rice grains were gone, replaced by layer upon layer of coiling black clouds, looking sinister and terrifying.

This was the first time Li Ximing had seen such an art for capturing a person, let alone a master of divine abilities. He was quite amazed. Li Zhouwei then held up the copper basin.

The basin was thin, its light now dim. The patterns on it were indistinct, with only a few swirls of azure-bird-like color. But with the Li Clan's years of experience fighting Buddhist cultivators, both men quickly spotted the Buddhist traces on it.

"The original Maha must have obtained this Spiritual Artifact, made modifications to refine it, but then this Demon beast acquired it. Since he doesn't understand artifact refinement, it has sat unused."

The other item, the 'Upright Wood' spirit embryo, was of good quality. However, Shehu lacked the heritage and skills of humans, so his refinement technique was crude.

The robes were worthless, but the storage bag was heavy. Li Ximing was very satisfied.

"Since he escaped from that Maha, he must have grabbed plenty of spiritual items during the chaos. Plus, he was hiding a spirit root. After so many years of accumulation, he must have amassed a huge fortune."

"I'd wager he's no poorer than any cultivator on the mainland."

Li Zhouwei smiled, his golden eyes looking down at the Small Guang Kong Mountain below. The temple was completely empty, not a soul in sight. They had either hidden or fled.

The formation here was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm level. He shattered it with a flick of his finger. The two descended into the compound. The temple was dark and the corridors long. Below, a group of monks and nuns knelt, all in shackles. They had little or no cultivation and hadn't dared to flee, trembling in fear.

Li Zhouwei's gaze swept over them. He discovered that these so-called monks and nuns were actually cultivating the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. Shehu hadn't even dared to capture real Buddhists.

"It seems," he said, "that incident back then truly terrified him."

His golden eyes swept over them again. He found they weren't even qualified to be consumed for their blood-qi; they were all relatively "clean" cultivators. He stepped into the depths of the temple. Li Ximing followed, remarking,

"There are over a hundred with cultivation, and even more mortals. We can't take them back. The moment we leave, they'll probably end up filling the stomachs of other cultivators."

Li Zhouwei finally spoke.

"Xinggong Terrace just suffered a great loss of vitality. These people have clean cultivation. They could serve as outer disciples for Dao Mian. Besides, Grand-uncle, didn't you want to use a Spiritual Artifact to condense spiritual water?"

Li Ximing nodded slightly, falling into thought. Li Zhouwei continued impassively,

"Although that wondrous ability can condense the water on its own, we are not proficient in matters like the transformation of material properties. In my opinion, this kind of task is best left to a 'Whole Pill' cultivator. We should consult him. These people can serve as his payment."

Hearing this, Li Ximing immediately nodded.

"That is very considerate."

They entered the main hall and the attached living cave, but found nothing. It was appallingly poor. Li Zhouwei swept his golden eyes over the area, then closed them, connecting with the Immortal Mirror. He understood.

'The spirit root is in an underwater cave. Shehu established this Little Mountain of Vast Jade just to guard it.'

Before they could say more, a fierce wind howled outside. A streak of emerald light descended from the sky, taking the form of a falcon. It landed and transformed into a middle-aged man. He had sinister eyes, a broad forehead, and a slightly pale complexion. He glanced at the two of them, his expression clearly surprised, even doubtful.
'Shehu was dealt with this quickly? But I saw no major phenomenon. Could he have escaped?'

He cupped his hands.

"King Wei truly lives up to his reputation. Congratulations, fellow Daoists!"

This man was Yin Qin!

His body radiated a bright divine ability; his skills were clearly not small. Li Ximing smiled faintly and nodded in greeting. Yin Qin immediately asked,

"This Shehu..."

Li Ximing replied casually:

"We've collected him for pill refinement. No need for you to worry, fellow Daoist."

The words were quite terrifying. Paired with Li Ximing's casual expression and Li Zhouwei's continued silence, it created a strange deterrent effect. Yin Qin glanced at him, a trace of apprehension in his eyes, before replying,

"Since that's the case, let's divide the spoils here."

His gaze seemed perfectly calm. But Li Zhouwei, who had been silent all this time, suddenly spoke, his voice light:

"There's no need to probe, fellow Daoist. Let's go see the spirit root first."

Only then did a trace of disappointment flash deep in Yin Qin's eyes. His expression, however, showed no embarrassment. He smiled,

"But of course. Please!"




# Chapter 1127: The Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant

Descending from Small Guang Kong Mountain, one entered the Western Sea. The earth veins here were robust, but the spiritual energy was sparse. The seabed rose and fell, yet Demon beasts were few—a stark contrast to the scenery of the Eastern Sea.

The three masters followed the earth veins, heading deeper into the baleful qi as the terrain grew more treacherous. Though Li Ximing possessed an Immortal Artifact, with this man leading, he saw no need to arouse suspicion and spoke casually,

"It's hidden quite deep... Daoist friend, you have some impressive skills to have found this place."

Yin Qin chuckled.

"I may cultivate in the Western Sea, but I have spent long periods in the Abyss of Weak Water. My own divine ability has a few unique applications. I noticed that Daoist Friend Cang Tiaozi of the World's Navel entered and exited the abyss every few years. I chanced upon him twice, which made me pay closer attention. After asking around, I learned that Daoist Friend Cang Tiaozi possessed the Shore-Manifesting White Flower and supplied it to many other cultivators."

The man's gaze was chilling as he continued faintly:

"There shouldn't be so many of this item, and there was no need for him to come here year after year. I suspected then that Cang Tiaozi had a spiritual root... one that couldn't be moved from the Abyss of Weak Water. I searched high and low, but I could never find any proof."

"It wasn't a total loss, however. I saw that lynx demon skulking back through the Abyss of Weak Water. After much thought, I shifted my focus to him. Only then did I realize this was merely their chosen trading spot..."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"A remarkable divine ability, Daoist friend, to uncover such details."

Yin Qin laughed. His expression was polite, but combined with his gloomy aura, it carried a chilling undertone.

"I cultivate 'Bound Earth,' the true path of stillness that arrests profound change. My divine ability is named 'Valley of True Origin.' I merely saw him descend into the sea at a certain point, recorded the location, and then used the earth veins to calculate his exact position."

He smiled.

"All spiritual roots must commune with the earth veins. That Demon beast is both stingy and cowardly, so he never had the chance to establish a great Purple Mansion Realm array to protect it. That made the calculation even simpler."

"This is almost certainly the Solitary White Brahma Cluster, which frequently bears the Shore-Manifesting White Flower! Since it's a living spiritual root, it will surely fare better in our hands, with careful tending, than in the possession of that Demon beast!"

Cultivators of Bound Earth were numerous, but those with a proper Dao lineage were exceedingly rare. Li Ximing couldn't help but shoot him a second glance, sighing,

"In Jiangnan, we also had a cultivator... He, too, practiced Bound Earth. His was the Fool's Mountain Chase..."

Yin Qin sneered.

"Fool's Mountain Chase? That's a divine ability from Tongxuan Palace, used to supplement their Shetu Earth. What kind of unorthodox lineage is that? To be blunt, it can barely be considered 'Bound Earth' at all... As for its wondrousness..."

He was one step short of saying, 'It's a disgrace to Bound Earth.' By speaking so candidly, he was likely hinting at his own superior lineage, a subtle threat to prevent the other two from getting any ideas.

Li Ximing listened, making a mental note. He understood this man was likely arrogant at his core and deliberately provoked him:

"Oh? But my senior's Dao lineage was officially recognized by the Profound Governance. The five types of earth are all part of the five elements, but there are high and low distinctions. That Dao which manifests as rosy clouds in the heavens is probably the most practical."

Hearing this, Yin Qin actually fell silent for a moment before replying:

"That is a matter for the immortals of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition, not for minor cultivators like us to discuss recklessly."

'His lips are sealed tight...'

Though the man said little, Li Ximing gleaned a great deal and chuckled inwardly.

'So he isn't a Comprehending Profoundity cultivator either! I wonder where his Earth Virtue inheritance came from...'

As they spoke, they arrived in a deep ocean trench. The water was heavy and shrouded in darkness. Li Zhouwei's golden eyes swept the area, instantly piercing the illusion. A formation as thin as a cicada's wing shattered at a touch, revealing, as expected, a cave-abode hidden within!

Inside the cavern, the radiance was dim. A vast hall was filled with the ruins of countless palaces, set between dark rivers. They surrounded a central purple lake, upon which stood an ancient tree.

The tree was over four hundred feet tall, its canopy spreading like a cloud. It was sparsely dusted with ice and snow, and its branches and leaves were entirely white. Several white blossoms, each the size of a human face with stamens of gold and silver, adorned its boughs, releasing an intoxicating fragrance.

The surface of the pool was perfectly still, a mirror reflecting the branches and leaves. A faint, mournful music drifted through the air, stirring the heart.

Li Zhouwei, however, merely glanced around and smiled.

"What a potent illusion."

Li Ximing, who had been observing intently, had already formed the Light of the Six Harmonies in his hand. He held it like a wisp of flame, raised it to his lips, and blew gently.

Everything before them shattered like a lake reflection. The ruined palaces and layered scenery dissolved into nothing. The cavern was, in reality, no larger than a small hall. Faint, silver-white array patterns flickered across the ground, bathing the room in a dim white glow. In the center stood a small, graceful spiritual shrub, like a tea plant, with sparse, elegant branches.

Yin Qin stood frozen, stunned.

'It's not the Solitary White Brahma Cluster?'

The tea plant-like spiritual root before them had golden branches, leaves as white as snow, and white blossoms dotting its limbs. This sight made the Daoist Master stumble back a step in disbelief, instantly creating distance between himself and the other two!

Li Ximing felt a wave of Lesser Yang light wash over his face, as brilliant as moonlight on snow but lacking any chill. He knew something had changed and immediately gripped the Spiritual Treasure in his hand, his gaze turning wary.

The atmosphere in the grotto-abode instantly tensed. Li Zhouwei, however, showed little reaction. His golden eyes scanned the surroundings, examining every detail.

"The spiritual energy here is unusual," he stated calmly. "Neither sun nor moon shines, and all energies are in harmony. It possesses the consummate qi of the Lesser Yang, which is perfect for preserving this spiritual object. It's not that the Demon beast didn't set up an array; he simply lacked the ability to deploy a Purple Mansion Realm formation without destroying this delicate balance."

His words eliminated any possibility of a fight breaking out in this place. Yin Qin , seeming to recover, pinched his fingers to make a calculation. In a low, uncertain voice, he muttered:

"This is the Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant, a 'Lesser Yang' Purple Mansion Realm spiritual root. So the Shore-Manifesting White Flower actually came from this... That lynx demon hid this well!"

"Ever since the Sundering of the Lesser Yang, this spiritual root's lineage was severed at its source. Its leaves turned from white to pale yellow, and its twelve branches withered to four, becoming the Solitary White Brahma Cluster... The origin of this particular plant must be ancient indeed!"

Li Ximing glanced at it, thinking,

'If that's the case, it can't be moved. The moment it's taken outside and exposed to the world's spiritual aura, it will degenerate day by day until it becomes a second-rate spiritual root...'

But the golden-eyed youth's gaze was blazing. He studied the area for a long moment, feeling that the perfection of this place was almost frightening. He began to pace, his eyes sweeping over the glowing patterns on the ground, remaining silent. A dark cloud of suspicion rose in his heart.

'Such an exquisitely balanced place... was it really created by nature?'

Li Zhouwei pondered for a long time before activating his Immortal Mirror, scanning the area once more. Still, he found nothing out of the ordinary.

'It's just this one location... no traces anywhere else. But if it was crafted by a cultivator... how many people in this world possess such profound Dao-Profundity? How could it possibly be that worthless lynx demon? Was it truly natural?'

A cold glint entered his eyes. He closed them briefly, recalling the Demon beast's pleas,

'Since you are from Jiangnan, you must know of my past karma. I am willing to offer this spiritual root to you two sirs...'

'The spiritual root is tied to the karma... Perhaps he found a clue to this spiritual root through that past karma... That would explain it... Let's observe a little longer.'

He turned his head, glanced at the Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant, and said, "Since we agreed to split everything, this plant has four mature Shore-Manifesting White Flower. Let's pick those first."

Hearing this, Yin Qin spoke up immediately, clearly afraid they might damage the root.

"This item is among the most delicate of Lesser Yang resources. It fears both fire and baleful qi. It's best to collect them in a wooden box."

Li Zhouwei, however, was watching him intently.

"As for the spiritual root itself..." he continued.

That sentence made Yin Qin 's heart leap into his throat. His expression grew hesitant, but the young man merely said flatly:

"We'll chop it down right here. Our two families will divide it."

At these words, even Li Ximing winced, to say nothing of Yin Qin . The man's face turned pale, and he cried out anxiously,

"Absolutely not! How can such a magnificent spiritual root be turned into firewood!"

He could no longer restrain himself and stepped forward to plead,

"I understand your esteemed clan is far away, making it difficult to manage this spiritual root. But this is easily solved! The Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant flowers far more rapidly than the Solitary White Brahma Cluster. I cultivate Earth Virtue and have some knowledge of tending spiritual roots. Just entrust it to me! In the future, whenever it flowers or sprouts new leaves, I will divide them fifty-fifty and have your portion delivered to your esteemed clan!"

He bowed repeatedly, sighing, "This way, we are all satisfied. Is that not for the best?"

His proposal was reasonable, and Li Ximing looked moved. But Li Zhouwei's golden eyes remained unwavering. He smiled.

"You are very considerate of my family, Daoist friend. But this item is so precious... how could splitting it between two be better than one person taking it all? Are you not afraid that this King will return home, gather reinforcements, and dispose of you? Then I wouldn't have to share it at all."

Yin Qin 's expression changed drastically. He raised his brows and said,

"King Wei, your radiance..."

The young man, however, cut him off. His eyes glittered with a sharp, wicked light as he laughed.

"Radiance? This King dares to claim it, but do _you_ dare to believe it?"

Yin Qin deliberated for a moment, clearly unwilling to offend him. He finally let out a long sigh, unable to argue.

"Since King Wei insists on felling it, then please, proceed!"

Li Zhouwei turned, plucked the four white flowers, and stored them safely. Then, he lightly flipped his palm.

An invisible object appeared in his hand. Though formless, its power radiated outward, feeling like the scorching, oppressive heat of a midday sun, parching the throat.

It was the 'Concealed Plunder Gold'!

This was a gift from the White Dragon Prince, formed from the essence of the Supreme Yang that had fallen into the Eastern Sea. It was a truly orthodox Supreme Yang spiritual object!

He brought two fingers together, pinching the item, and slashed at the Lesser Yang spiritual root.

In an instant, radiance exploded. Leaves fluttered down like a shattering jade vase. A flash of azure burst from within the white as small beads scattered across the ground, like mottled sunlight filtering through trees at dusk.

Only then did a dull rumble sound, like the overturning of the sea. Three colors scattered from the light. Li Ximing looked down to find pale blue Converging Water already surging past his boots.

He exclaimed in praise, and with a sweep of his hand, gathered the rolling white beads. The moment they entered his sleeve, they melted into a pool. Li Ximing's eyes lit up.

"'Lesser Yang' Purple Mansion Realm spiritual object! Supreme Eaves Radiance!"

Li Zhouwei closed his eyes briefly, absorbing the 'Concealed Plunder Gold' back into his Juque Palace. In his hand, six pale-white, scale-like objects appeared. The young man displayed them openly.

"'Dawn Qi' spiritual resource, Dao-Gazing Scales."

The Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant had been reduced to a fist-sized piece of dead wood, soaking in the shallow Converging Water. Yin Qin 's expression was grim as he picked it up.

"This is what the Solitary White Brahma Cluster transforms into... Solitary White Brahma Wood. It is also of the 'Lesser Yang'—King Wei, your methods are truly impressive. To use a Supreme Yang spiritual object to divide it... you have not failed it!"

He wasn't wrong. Not only were Supreme Yang spiritual objects incredibly rare, but Li Zhouwei's casual slash was backed by his profound Dao-Profundity. It was no simple feat.

Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei exchanged a glance and nodded. Li Zhouwei separated three of the Dao-Gazing Scales and handed them to Yin Qin to seal the deal. Only then did Li Ximing speak:

"Daoist friend, since we are here, let us also divide the items from the lynx demon."

He took out the storage bag, showed it to Yin Qin , and then used a divine ability to open it. Though a small mountain of spiritual items poured out, the truly valuable items were gathered with a sweep of his power and separated into six lots.

Two were cultivation manuals: the Upright Wood's Journeying North manual, Mountains Gaze South Classic, and the Merging Fire manual, Dao Fire Merging Heart Classic, which cultivated the divine ability 'Concurrent-Risk Seizure'.

Both were excellent and uncommon Purple Mansion Realm manuals. The Dao Fire Merging Heart Classic in particular was an ancient method; its grade was indiscernible, but it was written on a crimson-gold scroll that was clearly extraordinary.

'An unexpected boon!'

The remaining four items included a piece of inky-black, iron-hard rotted wood, which had to be the 'Upright Wood' spiritual wood Wood-Worshipping Iron, and a dark-green, water-like ripple of energy, which was precisely the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus Li Ximing had been coveting!

The last two were spiritual resources: one was the 'Blazing Fire' resource Rising Warmth Stone, which Li Ximing had acquired before, and the other was an item his family knew all too well, Neck Feathers.

The former was required for cultivating Journeying North, which made sense. But seeing the latter, Li Ximing felt a pang of guilt.

'I've used quite a few Neck Feathers over the years... It's possible he traded for this one from someone else...'

This was a respectable fortune for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but for a Demon beast who had controlled a spiritual root for so many years, it was surprisingly meager. Li Zhouwei's suspicion deepened, but he said nothing. Li Ximing had already stepped forward with a smile.

"I heard that you, Daoist friend, possess a Verdant Profound Sarcophagus. I am willing to trade one of my spiritual resources and two Dao-Gazing Scales for it. Are you interested?"

This made the Daoist Master pause and reflect.

"The lynx demon had one... for you to ask me for another, it seems your need is great. You'll be taking the one from his stash as well, then..."

It was impossible to hide. Li Ximing smiled and nodded. Yin Qin hesitated, but the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus was useless to him. He finally nodded, retrieving a jade box from his sleeve.

"Very well!"

With two Verdant Profound Sarcophagus in hand, Li Ximing's mind was at ease. He made a copy of the cultivation manuals, and the three prepared to leave. But as they did, a cloud of mist rose from the ground, and the treasure-land began to collapse.

'A Bound Earth divine ability.'

Li Ximing felt a prickle of unease. Li Zhouwei snapped his eyes up, staring directly at Yin Qin . The Daoist Master simply waved his hand.

"None of us has any more use for this place, but the residual aura of the spiritual root lingers. It's best not to leave it... It will save us the trouble of another Daoist Master finding it, sensing something, and tracing it back to us."

His divine ability had pulsed for only an instant, yet it had utterly destroyed the millennia-old, exquisitely constructed cave. He avoided Li Zhouwei's gaze, turned, and cupped his hands.

"Fellow Daoists, farewell. We shall meet again if destiny wills it!"

As his figure dissipated, Li Ximing turned to his companion and sighed.

"Cooperating with him... might not have been a bad thing. The Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant os far superior to the Solitary White Brahma Cluster. It's a true treasure pot. If we could have gotten one flower every two years, it's as good as the Wave-Suppressing Mansion!"

Li Zhouwei's heart was dark with suspicion, but his smile was relaxed.

"That man is treacherous and cunning. I don't trust him. If war truly breaks out between north and south and he offers some flimsy excuse, are we going to cross the sea just to confront him? It's better to settle this permanently."

Li Ximing could only nod. Li Zhouwei then said nonchalantly,

"Grand-Uncle, you still need to collect the spiritual items and tidy up here. Why don't I take the Heavenly Nurture Urn back first, just in case anything unexpected happens?"

Although Li Ximing didn't foresee any problems, he handed the Spiritual Treasure over. Li Zhouwei took it, bid his farewell, and vanished into the Great Void, his heart growing colder by the second.

'Now... let's see just what kind of trickery you were hiding!'

(End of Chapter)




# Chapter 1128: Xiyang

After seeing his junior clansman off, Li Ximing rode a beam of light back toward the lone mountain. He arrived to find the young man already waiting quietly in the monastery.

"Nanwu, you live a truly carefree life," Li Ximing smiled.

Guo Nanwu had been ordered to hold the line against a Demon King from the White Rock Monastery on nearby Fangya Province. His posting was quite close to Li Ximing's, and he seemed to be handling the task with ease, appearing completely unfazed by his duties.

"I cultivate Heretical Seeking," Guo Nanwu smiled, "which is a method of the Lesser Yang for walking through Yin. It makes escape exceptionally easy, no less effective than Valley Water. That Demon beast cultivated Water Mansion, but it stood no chance of holding me."

Li Ximing, with the Azure Talisman now in his possession, was in excellent spirits.

"I've made a great haul as well!" he laughed.

The two entered together. Daoist Master Dao Mian, dressed in full robes, greeted them with a sigh.

"Only now do I realize the true power of the Jiangnan Immortal Dao!"

Hiding in this desolate Western Sea was, at its root, just a way to seek freedom and preserve one's life-mandate. How could they not be sensitive to such major events? Li Ximing knew this group from the Purple Mansion Realm all felt a sense of shared sorrow. Even a Daoist Master like Dao Mian, who held personal grudges, was moved.

"Senior Liu showed my family a great kindness," Li Ximing replied. "This was merely to remove a weight from his mind. Besides, possessing a treasure is itself an invitation to disaster."

Nearby, Bao Xiang, though her expression was calm, lowered her eyes.

"Tonight, the entire Western Sea is buzzing with talk of King Wei's mighty name!"

Li Ximing just laughed and shook his head, not elaborating.

"Let's speak privately."

Bao Xiang raised an eyebrow and followed him into the inner hall.

"I recall you cultivate Pit Water," Li Ximing smiled. "Is your Dao Lineage still complete?"

The woman looked up, her interest piqued, and her eyes suddenly brightened.

"There aren't many in the Purple Mansion Realm who would dare claim their Dao Lineage is complete. My lineage has been supplemented for generations and has a deep heritage. Pit Water is a widespread Dao Lineage, but we are missing the Man on Creek. It's in Jiangnan... If Senior has this art, Bao Xiang would be eternally grateful for the grace that leads to the Dao!"

"This..."

How could Li Ximing not recognize the name of that divine ability? During his family's initial rise, it had scared him half to death. He shook his head, slightly embarrassed.

"'Man on Creek'... I can only point you toward Cangzhou to ask. Whether you can obtain it will depend on your own karmic affinity. However, I do have a spell art here. It's called the Water-Guiding Transformation Scripture."

He took out a purple jade profound slip and handed it to Bao Xiang. She glanced at the summary and smiled.

"What a marvelous art... This is... this is a technique from the Encompassing Profoundity!"

The spell art in Li Ximing's hand had come from the High Firmament Pavilion; how could it be an ordinary item? Although Bao Xiang didn't seem overly excited, Li Ximing knew she absolutely coveted it. Seeing she had recognized its origin, he simply smiled.

"First, you've been a great help along the way, and I can't let Senior Liu be indebted to you for nothing. Second, I wish to trade it for the spirit object in your possession, the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus."

Li Ximing had, of course, come for the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus. Since he had already acquired the one from Rogue Cultivator Yin Qin, he couldn't be bothered to pay an exorbitant price to another rogue cultivator. He would simply trade with Bao Xiang here and now. The woman was getting a fantastic deal, so why would she hesitate?

"Done!" she smiled.

One was getting something for nothing, the other was secretly snagging a bargain. They struck the deal instantly. With the item in hand, Li Ximing asked with a faint smile:

"That Rogue Cultivator Yin Qin... what's his story?"

Bao Xiang paused.

"He came to the Western Sea to cultivate over a hundred years ago. His cultivation is formidable, and many have suffered at his hands. As for his Dao Lineage... he only ever claims to be one of the rogue cultivators."

"Is that so..."

Li Ximing smiled and shook his head.

"Just a casual question."

He didn't linger, stepping back out.

"I do have one item I must have Senior Dao Mian inspect!"

With a flick of his sleeve, he revealed the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron, handing it to Daoist Master Dao Mian. He then took out three portions of the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus.

"Please, take a look!"

Any Daoist Master who reached the Purple Mansion Realm was shrewd. Daoist Master Dao Mian understood with a single glance.

"What an incredible treasure, Daoist friend. You'd never find something so wondrous outside of Jiangnan!"

The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron had been obtained from Wanling Heaven, a Grotto-Heaven of the Encompassing Profoundity. It was naturally extraordinary. Li Ximing smiled as he watched the man retract his divine ability. Daoist Master Dao Mian then took a round disk from his sleeve.

The disk was no larger than his palm and shone like silver. Dao Mian collected a wisp of aura from the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus, then took out several Foundation Establishment Realm-level samples of water and fire from his sleeve. He tested them one by one before speaking.

"This Spiritual Artifact stems from the root of Gathering Wood, yet it holds the function of the Whole Pill. The creator's genius is astonishing, far beyond my own. This Verdant Profound Sarcophagus, however, is aligned with water and wood. It lacks a component of Earth Virtue. Based on my years of cultivation, it requires a 'nurturing' Treasured Earth."

He smiled.

"I will spend a few days making careful calculations. I will ensure no mistakes are left."

Li Ximing was startled.

"'Treasured Earth'? It needs another spiritual resource? Without your help, Senior, I would have made a terrible mistake!"

Daoist Master Dao Mian nodded.

"This Spiritual Artifact is extremely potent. Even if you don't supplement it with this earth element, it should still be able to condense spiritual water. It would just be flawed, congenitally deficient, and lacking some of its true marvel. In a battle, if you encountered an art from the Three Shamans and Two Rites, or the Whole Pill and Exiled Qi, this spiritual water might be extinguished. If you just keep it within the clan for internal use, it should be fine."

Hearing this, Li Ximing felt a wave of relief. He sighed, "But this Treasured Earth spiritual resource..."

Guo Nanwu, who had been listening, smiled.

"This junior happens to have a portion of Cliff-Repel Earth."

Li Ximing had no desire to run around searching for this resource. He was overjoyed. He took a Shore-Manifesting White Flower from his robes.

"You've been troubled to come all this way. This Shore-Manifesting White Flower is a spiritual resource of the Lesser Yang path. It's perfect for you. Take it."

Although both were spiritual resources, the Shore-Manifesting White Flower could be directly consumed and was perfectly aligned with Guo Nanwu's Dao Lineage. It was an exceptionally good treasure. The young man's eyes curved into crescents as he cupped his hands.

"Many thanks to Senior for your generosity!"

With all matters settled, Li Ximing was even more satisfied. He finalized the details with Daoist Master Dao Mian and began to calculate inwardly,

'The items from Shehu were divided, but the Spiritual Artifact and the spirit embryo both ended up with Zhouwei. Add to that one spirit object, the Supreme Eaves Radiance, and two spiritual resources, the Dao-Gazing Scales and the Shore-Manifesting White Flower... this harvest is enormous. Far beyond my expectations!'

'And that's not even mentioning the Azure Talisman and the spiritual water!'

...

The sky was a dim, heavy, purple-gold.

While Li Ximing was in the Western Sea, giddy with joy as he gathered spirit objects and counted his gains, the black-robed young man felt a chill in his heart. He had rushed all the way back to Moongaze Lake, settling into the grand formation. He counted the days; he had been gone only half a month.

He did not go to see Sima Yuanli. Instead, he immediately went to the deepest part of the formation, produced the treasured urn, and placed it on a table using a divine ability. With his gaze lowered and hands behind his back, he slowly began to loosen the seal.

He relaxed it by only a fraction, but the vertical patterns on the urn lit up one by one, trembling slightly. A thick, grey qi swirled at the mouth of the urn. It slammed into the pair of golden eyes waiting in the darkness and instantly froze. A low voice emerged,

"This little Demon greets King Wei..."

Now that it was completely sealed in the urn, Shehu's voice was surprisingly calm. Golden light flickered in the dark hall as Li Zhouwei spoke, his tone faint.

"Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant... where did it come from?"

The Demon beast in the urn fell silent for a moment before a voice, thick with hatred and grinding teeth, replied:

"You found my treasure so quickly... Yin Qin must have invited you... Good... Very good..."

Li Zhouwei didn't press the question. He merely watched, the gold in his eyes growing more intense. Shehu couldn't hold onto his sliver of hope.

"It was stolen from Shejie's Golden Land," he whispered. "I carried it all the way from the Eastern Sea..."

Before he could finish, Li Zhouwei laughed, a cold, sharp sound.

"Stolen? This King won't even bother debating whether Shejie's Golden Land could have preserved this spirit root. You carried it from the Eastern Sea? And you just _happened_ to find the one place capable of sustaining a Lesser Yang item? What a joke!"

Seeing the anger in his eyes, Shehu's voice grew urgent.

"I didn't find the place! A Daoist friend... a Daoist friend set it up for me."

At these words, the smile vanished from Li Zhouwei's face.

"This Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant wasn't always so small," Shehu rushed to explain. "Back when I was in the Golden Land, I was suppressed, unable to move. The immortal plant was as tall as a man... Shejie received it as a reward from the Liang Emperor after a Dao debate in the Liang Palace."

Li Zhouwei frowned.'
"You claim you were trapped in the Golden Land, unable to move. How could you know all this?"

Seeing how sharp and suspicious he was, Shehu felt more sorrow than anger, terrified for his life.

"King Wei, you may not know. The Great Liang dynasty was plagued by three great troubles. The first was the flooding of the rivers. The second was the conflict between barbarians and the civilized. The third was the great debate between the Immortals and the Buddhists. At that time, many Buddhists and Daoists were beyond the passes. The Liang Emperor invited all the great cultivators and monks of the world to debate the Immortal and Buddhist scriptures... There were nine debates in total. The Buddhist cultivators won only three, and Shejie was one of the victors... He... he disliked using spell arts to bewilder people. He focused on sincerity and genuine conviction..."

Li Zhouwei's suspicion eased slightly.

"No wonder it took a figure like that so long to subdue a little Demon like you."

Locked inside, Shehu wiped at a cold sweat.

"Later, the void collapsed, and the Golden Land returned to emptiness. I grabbed this spirit root and snatched several Enlightened Artifacts he had been refining there. I fled in a panic, all the way from the Eastern Sea to the Western Sea, and only then did I stop to rest. But when I undid my arts to check, the Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant was withered, almost lifeless!"

"I don't understand Dharma arts, I couldn't save it. I could only let it be. I sold those Enlightened Artifacts for spiritual resources to heal and cultivate. But then... I ran into a great cultivator practicing in the Western Sea..."

"A great cultivator?"

Li Zhouwei's gaze sharpened. Shehu continued,

"His surname was Qu. He called himself Daoist Qu. He had the face of a middle-aged man, but his divine ability was dazzling, terrifying. This little Demon had never seen anyone with such a brilliant divine ability. I was so scared I prostrated myself. But he just claimed to be a minor cultivator from the Xiyang Monastery..."

"I said, 'This little Demon is ignorant, I don't recognize any such immortal monastery.'"

"This Daoist Qu said, 'My Ancestral Master is not within the Five Elements, born of Yin and Yang. He is the First Lesser Yang, the first disciple of Comprehending Profoundity, the Immortal Lord worshipped by Great Liang for generations, the very clan that Shangqing seeks to ally with year after year.'"

"'Guanhua is magnificent, he is His junior brother. Zidu governs the world, revering Him as Ancestral Master. Dongwu and Qingyi bow to Him. Changtang and Wuguan cultivate in seclusion with Him. Xu Xiang built a great tower, begging Him for guidance time and again, pleading for the immortal mountain—hoping it would serve as His imperial palace.'"

Li Zhouwei's brows shot up. The worry in his heart finally took solid form.

"An immortal cultivator from Comprehending Profoundity!"

At this, Shehu's voice began to tremble visibly, whether from fear or excitement.

"When I heard that, my head spun. I assumed this person must be an immortal's messenger. I kowtowed again and again, saying, 'Aiya! My lord, just take my head! You don't need to frighten me so!'"

"But he said, 'I see that you, little Demon, have obtained my Lesser Yang treasure tree. It is the only one of its kind in the world. It was Senior Shejie's karmic affinity. He, too, was a senior of my Xiyang Monastery who entered the mortal world and joined the Buddhists. Now, I will protect this, so it does not also turn to nothingness.'"

Li Zhouwei's expression was grave. Even if he doubted the story, he knew this Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast could never have fabricated such words.

'I've never heard of this Changtang or Zidu... but Qingyi and Wuguan? They're either Immortal Lords or Demon Ancestors!'

'But from his words, this person... he's probably not one of the figures "from the mountain."'

'Shangqing... that's the Golden Feather Sect...'

'The clan that Shangqing seeks to ally with year after year... That means this great lord most likely has the surname Zhang! I could never find the proof that True Monarch Taiyuan's Dharma principles came from Comprehending Profoundity... perhaps it's related to this lord...'

He remained silent, so Shehu continued.

"He chose a mountain, established that wondrous domain, and revived the tree. I may be ignorant, but I knew his methods were profound. I wanted to set up a Purple Mansion Realm formation to protect it, but I was afraid of disturbing his work..."

"He also told me, 'The Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant is a Lesser Yang spirit root. It was once planted in the palace and nurtured by an Emperor. Wait one hundred years, and it will grow roots. Wait another hundred, and its leaves will flourish. After another hundred years, it will bloom one flower every fifty years. A hundred years after that, it will bloom three. And after another hundred years, it will bloom four flowers every twenty years...'"

He whimpered, "By Heaven's pity, I used so many spiritual resources to nourish it, and it was blooming four flowers in less than five hundred years! But in total, I've only ever gotten just over ten flowers. I used half of them just to feed the spirit root..."

'No wonder he had nothing good on him.' Li Zhouwei's expression hardened. 'By that count, it's only been nurtured for nearly five hundred years. That's one flower every five years... worse than the Neck Feathers. The only advantage is not needing to painstakingly gather Wall-Sinking Water, and the flowers can be used for alchemy... But it's far inferior to that spirit flower the Golden Feather Sect seized from Donghuo.'

Before the Demon beast could complain further, Li Zhouwei sealed the urn with a mental slap. He casually picked up the Spiritual Treasure, his gaze lowered, and remained silent for a long time.

'Xiyang Monastery... was this a scheme?'

He refused to believe that someone from hundreds of years ago could lay a trap spanning so much time, just to ensnare a Li family member carrying a Talisman Seed. Yet, he also refused to believe that this was all a coincidence, free of mortal interference.

'That Daoist Qu doesn't seem like the type to lay plots, but those who came after could easily use his opening move as their own... The arrangement around Shehu is definitely not simple. That Rogue Cultivator Yin Qin... he was likely targeted long ago, just waiting for an excuse.'

'But he cultivates Earth Virtue, and his background isn't shallow. Bound Earth is clearly one of the "mountain" lineages. Besides Comprehending Profoundity... what other faction is there?'

The young man was silent for a long time, staring at the purple light that flowed like water through the hall.

'Suining's meaning was that even if we don't harvest this spirit root now, the spiritual energies will shift and the plant will be ruined anyway. But... if we had cooperated, that place would have been left in Yin Qin's care... Doesn't that mean _he_ would have been the one to ruin it?'

He recalled the man's haste to leave, and his certainty grew.

'The one who truly wanted this spirit root destroyed... could it have been Yin Qin? But if he really is from Comprehending Profoundity, why wait until today? He could have just destroyed the place openly. Why borrow my hand?'

"Lesser Yang... Lesser Yang..."

His eyes were heavy as he slowly grasped the heart of the problem.

'The key is Great Liang and Lesser Yang. The world believes it was a conflict between Comprehending Profoundity and Azure Profoundity. That the Supreme Yang executing the Lesser Yang planted a hidden danger, leaving the Liang Emperor unable to stand alone against the Dragon-kin, which led to the collapse of Great Liang... But is that the truth?'

'But Great Liang was a Celestial Dynasty! The second Celestial Dynasty after the Great Wei... Qingyu Qian implied that the Great Zhao's current plight is also a result of nursing such ambitions. But Wei, Liang, and Zhao... each dynasty was shorter-lived than the last. This means the original perpetrator's precautions are growing stronger and stronger...'

"When the Supreme Yang executed the Lesser Yang, was Mount Luoxia joyous or grieving? How many different voices were there on Mount Luoxia?"

The golden light in his eyes slowly receded. He committed everything to memory, sat on the main seat, and stared at the Spiritual Treasure in his hand, lost in thought.




# Chapter 1129: Duty and Private Sentiments

West Curtain Sea.

The moonlight was clear and bright, casting shimmering reflections across the undulating waves. Suddenly, a divine ability streaked through the air, resolving into two figures, one chasing the other. Two Daoist Masters had arrived.

The one in front wore a Daoist robe, three brocade pouches tied at his waist. He carried a long, green-bamboo-like staff over one shoulder. Tied to its end, a cluster of small, jade-carved swords clinked crisply against each other.

His attire was rather strange. He had the look of a middle-aged man, his skin reddish, his expression severe. His eyes were half-closed, lost in thought.

Following him was an old man in magnificent, formal robes. His face, however, was deathly pale, and a look of pained reluctance flickered in his eyes. Seeing the first man remain silent for so long, he finally ventured,

"Daoist Friend Xie...?"

The Daoist Master he called Xie seemed to snap out of a trance. He let out a long breath.

"Senior... truly incredible!"

"The shamanic talismans in that abode are astounding, and the mystic realm of the abode itself is no less so... If someone with sufficient Dao-Profundity were inside... they could even use it to evade or repel an enemy... I even suspect... that the entire abode can be taken and stored!"

These two were none other than Yan Dushui and Xie Hu.

The distance between the Western Sea and the West Curtain Sea was vast. The Li family had long since concluded their business, but it seemed these two had only just now seen the immortal abode. Daoist Master Xie Hu's eyes were slightly red as he spoke, deeply moved.

"May I ask... that expert your ancestor met all those years ago... what was he like?"

This made Yan Dushui fall silent. After a long time, he said:

"For generations, my ancestors have guessed he was a figure from the Underworld. But at the time... the word he spoke was 'Immortal'."

Xie Hu's expression was grave.

"This person, I'm afraid, is not one of the Three Profoundities."

"My Dao Lineage cultivates the Shaman-Register. Our ancestral inheritance is ancient. My own grandmaster once sparred with that Duanmu Kui; they had something of a friendship. He had a deep understanding of both the Three Profoundities and the Shaman-Register's legacy."

"Whether this expert was from the Underworld, I do not know. But even if he was, he must have been an unorthodox practitioner who became a ghost and joined the Underworld."

Although Yan Dushui had guarded this treasure land for many years, his family line was not of the Upper Shaman or Merging Owl Dao Lineages. He couldn't distinguish the subtleties, nor did he particularly care. After listening, he just sighed.

"I only hope it was of some help to you, Daoist Friend..."

"Help... that's hard to say."

Xie Hu's expression was complicated, half-joyful and half-sorrowful.

"My grandmaster once discussed the Profound Dao with Duanmu Kui. That Daoist Master, whose name once shook the north and south, said this, 'The Upper Shaman appears empty but is truly obscure, existing only to answer the fallen. If I were to master it, I fear I would lose my life-mandate."

Though Yan Dushui lived at the edge of the world, he had heard of Duanmu Kui. He was stunned.

"I heard he was utterly tyrannical, obstinate and arrogant, claiming to be enlightened by an immortal, his power endless. He actually said something like that?"

"Immortals... there isn't just one. If the Underworld had no immortals, how could it have survived from antiquity until today?"

Xie Hu's expression dimmed.

"My grandmaster tried to persuade him, 'The immortal spoke of obtaining gold, but must it be the gold of the Upper Shaman? There are other paths above, great hope remains.'"

"But you are right. That senior was obstinate and arrogant, tyrannical and arbitrary. He charged down that single road to his death. Even someone as brilliant as him... could not achieve the Dao. Who else in the world would dare try?"

The middle-aged man turned to look at Yan Dushui and thanked him solemnly.

"Old senior, the supreme profound talismans carved in this abode contain great meaning in subtle words. This junior has benefited immensely. But no matter how profound the talismans, they cannot compare to the immortal scripture of that era. Duanmu Kui failed. What hope does this junior have? I cultivate the Upper Shaman, but my path of seeking the Dao lies outside it. This talisman does not aid my quest!"

Yan Dushui stood frozen, speechless for a long time, a pang of sorrow welling in his heart. But then Xie Hu's tone shifted. He lowered his gaze.

"However, with this wall of profound talismans, passing the Purple Mystery is now possible! This is an immeasurable kindness!"

The old man finally let out his breath, overjoyed.

"That's wonderful... wonderful!"

A wave of delight washed over him, and he was already scheming how to report the good news to Li Ximing, to squeeze every last drop of benefit from the information Xie Hu had provided.

Seeing the old man's deathly pale face, still muttering to himself, a trace of pity flashed in Xie Hu's eyes.

"I know what senior seeks," he said softly. "But senior... seeking the Dao is for oneself, to roam the heavens and earth. That is the true Great Dao of cultivation. Why must you place your hopes in your descendants? It is a grave error. You possess a divine ability, after all. If you are willing, I can use certain shamanic arts to dissolve that divine ability. You could live for several more decades... perhaps a new opportunity would arise?"

Yan Dushui's face lit up at the first half of the sentence, but the second half made him turn and stare blankly at Xie Hu. Seeing the man standing high-spirited under the moonlight, the old man laughed.

"Without your grandmaster, how could you be here today, seeking the Dao for yourself, roaming the heavens and earth? Be it a Dao Lineage or one's descendants, it is not a 'placed hope,' it is a fulfillment. It is in no way inferior to you Dao-seekers. A pitiful, prolonged life is useless. If achieving the Dao cannot be for myself, then it will be for those I entrust!"

Xie Hu watched him quietly. He could see the man's divine sense scattering, his dharma essence fluttering, even causing snowflakes to drift down around them. Yet the old man's face was wreathed in smiles, his words landing with unshakeable force. Xie Hu nodded gravely and cupped his hands.

"This junior has been taught."

...

Simin.

The sky was just beginning to brighten, but the road had grown cold again. The rumble of wheels echoed before the gate as a young man in profound-black robes stepped down from a sedan. The great crimson doors swung open, and a young boy was the first to run out.

The child was delicately featured, his steps light. A heavy, golden light settled in his eyes, but his face was all smiles. He stopped excitedly before the gate, staring at the young man.

"Fourth Uncle... you're back from the court assembly."

A smile instantly bloomed on Li Jiangliang's face. He took the boy's small hand.

"It's Suichu's birthday. Fourth Uncle didn't forget..."

He slipped an object from his wide, blue-black sleeve. It was a round, walnut-sized pearl, glowing with an intense radiance. The child accepted it with pure delight. As they walked inside together, a girl stood by the threshold of the inner courtyard, hiding behind the doorway. She showed only half her face, smiling shyly at him,

"Fourth Uncle..."

Her smile was expectant, her eyes fixed on his sleeve. Li Jiangliang's smile widened. He retrieved a small, palm-sized mirror.

"I could never forget Zhi'er!"

The child's eyes lit up as she took it. After a polite thank-you, she lifted the hem of her dress and ran to chase her brother. Li Jiangliang watched with a smile as the two children vanished, roughhousing, into the depths of the corridor, before he finally entered the courtyard.

His elder brother was in simple, plain clothes, his cuffs rolled up. He held a pair of small, white jade scissors, his head bowed as he inspected the plum blossoms in a porcelain vase. Pink petals were scattered around him.

Li Jiangliang stepped forward and bowed. Li Jiangxia smiled.

"It must have been difficult for you... insisting on having me transferred back to the capital so I wouldn't miss the little ones' birthdays. Suichu is easy enough to handle, but Zhi'er is terribly hard to please..."

Compared to when they had first entered the court, the two brothers were clearly much closer.

"Both children are close to you, and they have gentle temperaments," Li Jiangliang replied. "Lady Zou has taught them well."

Li Jiangxia led him to a seat and shook his head.

"You're wrong there. Suichu is mischievous, not nearly as steady as Suihuan. Li Jianglong might not have much else to his name, but he's truly gifted at siring sons. That's the only thing I envy him for."

This prominent official of the Great Song, the Emissary of the True Light Cloud, received the rebuke without the slightest change in expression. He only sighed.

"Big Brother's divine ability is imminent; he won't be having any more heirs. Suihuan is being raised as the main heir of the Li family, and he's living up to it. He has the makings of a divine ability... Suichu was born in the imperial capital... he hasn't experienced as much..."

His brother just laughed, not holding back.

"You're being far too polite. Everyone says our Li family has three Holders of the Profound. You rule the court, and I have illustrious prestige. But we both know that those of us who end up as Holders of the Profound here... are the ones who already lost the fight on Moongaze Lake. We're a step behind."

"And Suichu? Born in the imperial capital, everyone calls him 'Young Master.' Is that a good thing? He's a Bright Yang blood descendant, same as the others, but my son growing up in the deep palace courtyards. He has shouldered no responsibilities, seen nothing of the world. When he meets his clan cousin in the future, he'll be consumed by his own inferiority."

"It's just Li Jianglong's dumb luck. He had a child early and got the Daoist Master himself to bestow a name."

Hearing his brother say all this, Li Jiangliang found it difficult to respond. He shook his head.

"I heard... Father went to the Western Sea."

Li Jiangxia's expression turned solemn.

"Your information is sharp, as always... Did something happen?"

Li Jiangliang gave a bitter smile.

"What else could it be... My wife complained about the matter of the bestowed treasure. She said the Heavenly Nurture Urn was the Emperor's own fortunate encounter, not something from the Yang family, and that it has a wondrous power to... store, suppress, and seize essence..."

He raised an eyebrow and sighed.

"You know Father's personality... He went all the way to the Western Sea and captured a Demon King with two divine abilities. I heard he didn't even lift a finger—just one divine ability and one Spiritual Treasure. He scared the robes off that crowd of rogue cultivators."

Li Jiangxia was silent for a moment.

"With Father's current divine ability, I'm afraid even the Grand General wouldn't dare claim a certain victory against him!"

Li Jiangliang sighed.

"Isn't that the truth? And just when Western Shu is stretched too thin and Northern Zhao is a headless horde..."

Li Jiangxia shot him a glance.

"The stronger Father's divine ability becomes, the more they'll be wary of the consequences, and the more helpless they'll be against him. The day he reaches the Eastern Sea, none of you will even be able to see him clearly!"

Li Jiangliang was taken aback. He raised a hand.

"They are also acting out of good intentions."

His words were an explanation, but his brother didn't press the point.

"I hear the abbot of the Great Konghai Temple has returned to his position, and there are rumors stirring in Shitang again..."

Li Jiangliang gave a few distracted replies, seemingly lost in thought. After a long while, he asked,

"Since you came from the north, did you pass over the lake? Did you see Father?"

Li Jiangxia paused.

"Naturally, I passed over the lake... but Sima Yuanli was on guard. I didn't see Father. Isn't he still in the Western Sea?"

This made the young man lower his gaze slightly, though he smiled.

"That's also a matter for congratulations. The Grand General is transferring me to the north to assist with the defense. I'll have to travel via the lake as well. It will be a perfect chance to see Father and offer him my congratulations."

His brother laughed.

"Then you'd better be careful! Ting Province is a land where Martial Cultivation doesn't shine. The feeling of being knocked from the Holder of the Profound realm is not pleasant!"

Li Jiangliang just smiled, said his farewells, and stepped back into the sedan. He heard the crack of a whip and a shout. An illusory, multicolored light flashed, and pedestrians on both sides turned to stare.

Radiance flickered outside, but the inside of the sedan was dark and gloomy. A woman in white sat quietly, her expression heavy. The moment she saw him, she spoke,

"How did it go?"

Li Jiangliang shook his head.

"You're overthinking. Even if Father saw my brother, he would just offer words of encouragement. At most, he'd ask about the two children. Why would he possibly speak about his gains?"

The woman's expression remained heavy.

"I can't help but be suspicious. That Qu Qian of Mount Luoxia was from the same era as the Six Scions of Chongming, a cultivator who listened to lectures at the True Monarch's side. His power was immense, and it's highly likely he was acting on the True Monarch's instructions... It's a play by the Lesser Yang lineage."

"That's precisely why that little demon Shehu, with no backing and no obvious divine ability, was able to survive for five hundred years. The business with Daoist Master Zhaojing was an accident... but I fear there's something fishy about it."

Li Jiangliang lowered his gaze, his tone calm,

"What could possibly be fishy?"

Yang Tianyou paused, sensing his discomfort, and lowered her voice.

"Mount Luoxia always acts in extremes. Either they play at being lofty immortals, or they bring out their Dharma Treasures and doom people to eternal ruin. Even... even True Monarchs face the peril of ancient powers reappearing to fight over the five forms... With all those Dharma Treasures high above, how can we not be cautious?"

"Lesser Yang is practically Comprehending Profoundity's forbidden preserve. And given the current situation—Veiled Yin has collapsed, Lesser Yin has departed, Bright Yang has fallen, Lesser Yang is divided, and Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang are annihilated from history... This is not something we should be touching. Especially anything related to the complete Lesser Yang."

Li Jiangliang frowned.

"The items have already been divided by Father. What is there to worry about? I'll make the trip and ask him clearly. As for what else might have been in that abode, Mount Luoxia itself knows best!"

This high official of the Great Song always presented a gentle face, but her repeated attempts to make him probe his own family had clearly crossed a line. A sharp light flashed in his golden eyes, and he gritted his teeth.

"They plot against my family, and in return, my family has to live in fear, worrying if we've displeased them in some small way... In my opinion... that Wu Light is more tyrannical than any Bright Yang!"

As soon as he said it, Yang Tianyou subconsciously scanned the black qi swirling around them, terrified a third person might hear.

"The mainland is 'on the board,' so anything goes. But the Western Sea is 'off the board,' where any trick is permissible. I just hope that when you go back and ask, you'll warn Zhaojing to be careful..."

Li Jiangliang shot her a glance and sighed.

"The Daoist Master is your elder, too."

Yang Tianyou realized that in her anxiety, she had misspoken, using Li Ximing's Daoist title directly. She lowered her gaze.

"I... misspoke..."

She was quiet for a long moment, then said, sounding wronged,

"My love... I'm... I'm only thinking of you. Besides me, who cares if Ting Province interferes with the Lesser Yang's plans? I overhear a few scraps of their idle talk, and I have to come and ask you in secret..."

Li Jiangliang's brow relaxed.

"I know what's in your heart," he said softly. "I just... I can't stomach the injustice of it."

Yang Tianyou wiped her tears and leaned against his shoulder, a secret sorrow in her heart.

'In the entire Yang family, the only one who hopes King Wei achieves the Dao—who dreams of surviving after he achieves it... is me. My sisters all laugh at my naivety... But am I doing this just to have a Bright Yang True Monarch as an uncle-in-law? I am a person of the Underworld. Sooner or later, I must return to it. I don't care about the Li family at all... I am only thinking of your life-mandate...'

Her tears fell like rain, spattering on the man's blue-purple robes. Held aloft by dharma power, they glittered like pearls. Li Jiangliang stroked her hair.

"You'er," he said softly, "I know your heart."




# Chapter 1130: The Beginning and End Settled

Li Ximing rode the wind all the way back, his heart pounding with anxiety. He only managed to catch his breath after leaving the Fuzhong Sea. He passed through the dense jungles of Poluoduo, looped back from the Southern Sea to the Song State, and only when he saw that familiar, great lake did he finally, truly relax.

'That ghostly thing... thankfully, it didn't latch onto me.'

This realization amplified the joy from his great harvest, setting his mind completely at ease. As he landed in the mountains, he was greeted by an unexpectedly lively scene.

A Daoist Master in green robes sat meditating in a pavilion, a scroll resting on his lap. He stared intently at the text, his fingers pinching together in calculation. Two figures stood beside him: an old man, robed and stroking his beard with a look of contentment, and a young man, clasping a mercury-colored object, his bearing heroic.

Besides Daoist Master Qinghu, who had been invited to guard the area, it was also Xianyao and his disciple, Cheng Qian!

"Fellow Daoists!"

The pair seemed to be looking for Sima Yuanli. Li Ximing offered a smiling greeting. The green-robed Daoist Master immediately rose, studied his expression, and praised him.

"To have a harvest in such a short time... fellow Daoist is truly impressive!"

The Western Sea was distant, after all. Li Ximing had spent months preparing for the journey. Gathering information, refining pills, and setting up his plans all took time. After Li Zhouwei returned, he still had to arrange matters concerning Dao Mian. By the time he had finished with everything and returned, more than a year had passed.

Sima Yuanli clearly had connections in the Western Sea and knew exactly how long it had taken to eliminate that Demon beast. His smile was polite. Li Ximing replied.

"I spent some time handling private affairs. I was worried that if I stayed away too long, there might be trouble in the north again. I'm grateful to the Daoist Master for guarding the lake for my family."

"It was no trouble. Is cultivation not practiced everywhere?"

Sima Yuanli beamed, pressing his hands together.

"King Wei truly struck Qi Lanyan where it hurts. He's far too busy dealing with the accusations to cause any trouble!"

With three Daoist Masters arriving at the mountain gate, Li Ximing couldn't very well leave them standing outside. He led the group inside and they sat among the peaks. Sima Yuanli smiled.

"Congratulations, fellow Daoist! I've also heard of that Shehu. It was said to possess a certain treasure..."

Li Ximing already knew what he was thinking. With a faint smile, he brought his hand out from his sleeve. Resting in his palm was a brilliant, dazzling azure pearl.

It was the Shehu's Upright Wood spirit embryo.

It wasn't that Sima Yuanli lacked a spirit embryo. Although Daoist Master Yuanxiu hadn't been able to predict the date of his breakthrough and left one for him, Sima Yuanli now possessed both Spiritual Artifacts and Spiritual Treasures. Why would he waste effort refining a spirit embryo he looked down upon?

But Li Ximing had seen how crudely this artifact was refined, yet it had still managed to endure for so long against the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire. He knew the material of this Upright Wood spirit embryo was exceptionally rare. As expected, he saw Sima Yuanli's eyes light up.

Sima Yuanli joked,

"If Zhaojing still wants a Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill, I'm afraid I'm truly all out!"

Though spoken in jest, his words made Li Ximing pause. He, too, smiled.

"Daoist Master Qinghu's prediction was spot on. What a pity."

He smiled and said no more, immediately turning his hand and putting the spirit embryo away.

Whether it was for the formation or the cultivation of the two juniors, the Li family still required a massive amount of spiritual resources. But Li Ximing currently had plenty on hand. What was the rush to trade?

'A spirit embryo will degenerate. In five or six years, its value will plummet. But it's still early. The one who should be anxious is Sima Yuanli.'

He paid the pondering Sima Yuanli no mind and turned his gaze. As expected, Cheng Qian was speaking politely.

"Senior... did you happen to see that Demon beast use a treasure basin?"

Sima Yuanli anticipating this wasn't surprising, but Cheng Qian's query was odd. Suspicion rose in Li Ximing's heart, though his face remained pleasant.

"Your information is quite thorough."

Cheng Qian had worked with Li Ximing before and had always been clever and astute—a truly rare junior. Hearing the comment, he smiled.

"It is not I who is asking, but a friend. He said he is quite interested in the item, but his identity is... special, and he cannot meet with the Shehu to trade. Thus, he has been unable to acquire it."

Li Ximing understood immediately.

'Buddhist cultivators.'

Clearly, the boundaries between the Immortals and Buddhists of the Eastern Sea were not as sharply defined as they were in the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Cheng Qian likely knew many Buddhist cultivators. Li Ximing poured him some tea and said casually,

"It is in my hands. It just depends on what he's willing to offer in trade."

Cheng Qian's lips moved slightly. A voice, guided by a divine ability, floated clearly and decisively into Li Ximing's ear.

'This junior is willing to trade on his behalf. How about two portions of Radiant Spirit-Vessel?'

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat.

Li Zhouwei had obtained a portion of Radiant Spirit-Vessel from Changxiao Gate back then, and Li Ximing had used it. Its effects were excellent, especially for a cultivator like him. His Dao-Profundity wasn't high, making progress in spell arts exceptionally difficult, and the item had helped immensely. He was tempted, but the two items were not of equal value. He smiled.

"The item is good, but the basin's materials are superb. It's not an even trade. You'd be better off looking for spiritual items of the Li Fire or Whole Pill variety."

Nearly all the spoils from Vast Cicada had been poured into Li Zhouwei's weapon. Li Ximing was naturally thinking of future plans. His words weren't just for Cheng Qian; they were also for Daoist Master Qinghu, who sat nearby. At the same time, another calculation ran through Li Ximing's mind.

'This isn't my only option. If a Buddhist cultivator is making inquiries through such a winding path, and Cheng Qian is so decisive he's willing to make the trade himself, the basin's value must be extraordinary. If I don't ask Minghui about it first, won't I be taking a loss for nothing?'

He mused silently. The master and disciple before him, however, showed no signs of leaving. Cheng Qian lowered his brow in thought, but it was Xianyao who unexpectedly spoke.

He seemed to have hesitated for a long time. His expression was somewhat bitter.

"It's quite a coincidence to run into Zhaojing. I've heard of your esteemed clan's great reputation, and I have a few... private words to share. I only fear the Daoist Master will find me long-winded."

Li Ximing gave him a curious glance and nodded for him to continue. The older Daoist Master chose his words carefully.

"Although the Shehu was no powerful figure, it had its reasons for holding its ground. The West Mansion Grotto Sect, and the other Daoist Masters... though they can say nothing, they are deeply unhappy. And those few whose sources of spiritual resources were destroyed must certainly harbor some resentment..."

Li Ximing had expected this. He simply smiled, saying nothing. Xianyao continued.

"I understand the Immortal Clan is short on resources and has just received the Heavenly Nurture Urn from His Majesty, allowing you to fill this gap. But... to travel a thousand li to execute someone with a divine ability, someone with whom you have no prior enmity... this action is simply too severe. It does not earn a good name."

The smile on Li Ximing's face faded slightly. He understood the old man's point. He chuckled.

"Those words lack reason. Old sir, please speak plainly! Back then, the Chi clan used the cultivators of Jiangnan to guard the river, feeding the insatiable maw of the Buddhist cultivators. I never heard anyone speak a word of 'severity'. When the Murong clan swept south, they feasted on blood and perfected their Dao-Profundity, and no one came knocking to question them. I simply assumed that executing a man-eating evil Demon wouldn't earn me a 'severe' reputation. It seems I was mistaken."

His words landed softly, his tone mild, but they held no trace of agreement. A flicker of worry crossed Cheng Qian's eyes. Sima Yuanli kept smiling, as if he'd heard nothing. Xianyao sighed.

"Forgive this old man for saying a few things that are hard to hear. The common folk are common folk. No matter how many, they are just mortals. But a divine ability is a divine ability. Even one is an Immortal. Once that state is achieved, we are all 'fellow Daoists'. Countless commoners die of suffering, but never has one with a divine ability been executed without cause. Since it had already fled to the Western Sea, and you had no quarrel, you should have at least left it some dignity. Killing it is one thing... but why capture it and torture it?"

"If Zhaojing had secretly drawn its blood to nourish a Spiritual Treasure, even if word got out, people would at most praise your methods. But to capture one with a divine ability, to eat its flesh and wear its skin... anyone who hears of it will frown. This time it was a Shehu. Who will it be next time?"

"As for claiming it was a 'man-eating evil Demon' and that you thus had cause to execute it... that is an invitation to chaos."

His face was etched with sorrow. He cupped his hands.

"An evil Demon is inherently evil, but one cannot execute it simply _because_ it is evil. Otherwise, wouldn't every person with a divine ability live in constant fear? Your Li clan holds the banner of the righteous path high; is there anyone you _cannot_ kill? This is the way of the Encompassing Profoundity's Heaven-Governing. It is ill-suited for these times. The world belongs to those who are attaining the Dao. To govern those who have attained the Dao with the foolish notions of commoners... such a path will inevitably lead to ruin. All of history proves this."

Li Ximing narrowed his eyes, listening as Xianyao's voice dropped low.

"My ancestors came from Guanlong and received the grace of Wei. I am not Situ Huo; I cannot simply ignore my forebears. I had to be nosy. If the Daoist Master dislikes what he has heard, then for the sake of a man near death... please spare this old man..."

He bid his farewell, turned, and stepped onto the wind, departing. Cheng Qian, left behind, was frozen, clearly distressed, not knowing whether to stay or go. He apologized profusely.

"My master is old and speaking nonsense. Senior, please, do not take his words to heart!"

Li Ximing nodded.

"They were all words of sincerity. I have been taught a lesson."

Cheng Qian's expression was complicated. He cupped his hands, then hurriedly chased after his master. He caught up to him in the Great Void and sighed.

"Master, why did you have to do that!"

He saw his master's silence and knew this was not the place to talk. He held his tongue, and the two flew on until they reached their own mountain gate, a place of drifting clouds and floating immortal peaks. Only then did he speak urgently.

"Back then, Tianwu had the Wanling Upper Sect, and the Lin and Li families to conquer evil and set things right on its behalf. Their own people cursed Wanling for trying to become a second Thunder Palace. Today, we have King Wei. The purpose of the Heavenly Nurture Urn must be the same. One is willing to strike, the other willing to be struck. Master, why must you interfere?"

Xianyao's face fell. He stood with his hands behind his back, silent for a long time before lowering his head.

"Why? I certainly have my own selfish reasons. But King Wei cannot succeed! What will his end be? Can I not even offer a single word of caution?"

Cheng Qian knew his master understood everything and was just being stubborn.

"Since Master mentioned the Situ family, I must also say this, How glorious was the Situ family during the Wei era? The dignified King Shouyi, a great clan of Guanlong. And what are they reduced to now? Why must Master burden himself with these old connections? Looking after Situ Huo for all these years was one thing, but what is this you're meddling in now?"

The old man sat down heavily.

"I know I shouldn't interfere. But hearing all the rumors, I couldn't let it pass without saying something. In the end, I had to speak my mind. Li Ximing is not an unreasonable man. Forget it. Just... just consider it me, a man with little time left, building some goodwill for you."

Cheng Qian let out a long sigh and fell silent.

...

After seeing Sima Yuanli off, Li Ximing didn't linger. He summoned Li Jiangzong to listen to a detailed report on clan affairs. This scion of the main branch had managed the clan for many years and grown increasingly adept. He bowed in the courtyard and relayed the news item by item.

"...Yusui is currently in Suihuan's care. Third Brother also visited once. I heard he received orders to return to court. He came by the lake, but you were both absent..."

"There is one other matter. When you two sirs left the lake, two cultivators became ready to break through. One of them is a direct scion of our family, Li Suikuan. He is waiting in the mountains."

He presented everything clearly. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"This is excellent news! The Suiyu generation is gradually coming into its own. He is Li Suining's brother, correct? Have him come up."

Li Jiangzong respectfully withdrew. Soon, a young man ascended the mountain. He had a round face and rather thin eyebrows. He wasn't particularly handsome, but he seemed earnest and well-behaved. He prostrated himself, hands on the ground, and spoke respectfully.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

"Rise."

Li Ximing looked him up and down.

"You cultivate the Upper Rite?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, yes."

Though they were brothers, Li Suikuan's appearance and bearing were completely different from Li Suining's. That formation prodigy had a cold, almost melancholic air, as if he concealed countless worries. But Li Suikuan was clear and bright, his gaze firm.

Li Ximing nodded to himself.

'A single-minded one. Li Minggong has been supporting the Dongyi Prefecture for so many years. She's finally produced two pillars for the clan.'

He made a mental note of the name, rewarded him with spiritual pills, and smiled.

"You will in seclusion. What are your plans after your breakthrough? It is rare for the Dongyi Prefecture to produce both you and your brother. You should be handsomely rewarded."

Li Suikuan bowed.

"This junior does not wish for reward without merit. If I am fortunate enough to succeed, I only wish to follow the army north, to carry a saber and raise a banner for you, sir."

Li Ximing was genuinely taken aback. He looked at him again. Tapping his finger, he pushed up slightly, and an imperceptible gleam of light flashed from his fingertip.

'Utterly sincere...'

This was the first time a member of the Li clan, a scion of the direct line, had been willing to forsake the comfortable life on the lake to explicitly ask to go north. Li Ximing sighed, unsure if he felt joy or sorrow. After a moment of silence, he said:

"Very well. When you emerge from seclusion, go find Zhouda."

Li Suikuan bowed respectfully and departed, his excitement clear. Li Ximing, however, had lost the desire to ask any more questions. He stepped into the Great Void, floating away toward his grand formation.

The Purple and Gold Palace remained dark. He rode the wind inside. Li Zhouwei sat quietly on the main seat, cross-legged, his hands shielding his dantian. He held a golden, cicada-shaped pill, seemingly cultivating a divine ability.

The balance of yin and yang here was not beneficial for the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, so Li Zhouwei was cultivating with the Fading Sun Armour-Break Pill instead. He opened his golden eyes, seeing at a glance the disquiet in his visitor's heart. He smiled.

"Grand-uncle, what's wrong?"

Li Ximing sighed.

"My hands are stained by the Shehu affair. Looking back, it seems a mixed blessing at best. Sometimes I wonder if we would have been better off without the Heavenly Nurture Urn."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. He knew this elder was easily swayed by others' words. He simply smiled.

"Without the Heavenly Nurture Urn, we still wouldn't know the origin of that spirit root. There is no path for regret. Each step is taken as it comes. Resolving the Shehu matter was a major accomplishment."

"The most difficult part is over. Now, we have just cause to deal with those few beasts in the Southern Borderlands. Grand-uncle sees it as a bad thing... but I see it as a good one."

His faint smile calmed Li Ximation's heart. Daoist Master Zhaojing pondered for a long time before breathing out.

"I truly do not want to delay your cultivation. Since you are here, you can also watch over the lake. I must go and see to your weapon."

"I'll have to trouble you, Grand-uncle."

Li Zhouwei nodded, watching the man dissipate like light. His golden eyes closed once more. The radiance in the great hall instantly dimmed, leaving only the pill between his palms, pulsing faintly with a warm, red glow.




# Chapter 1131: Xinyu

A downpour lashed the mountains.

A biting chill hung over Mount Qusi. Li Ximing arrived on the wind, only to find the mountain slopes conspicuously empty. The icy rain, laced with sleet, hammered the trees, raising a deafening racket. The Daoist Master was seated cross-legged on the summit, absorbing the mists and morning dew. He snapped his eyes open, a smile spreading across his face.

"Fellow Daoist, you've arrived!"

Li Ximing held a long halberd, its long blade curved like the moon, radiating a brilliant light. It was precisely Grand Ascension. He presented the weapon. Liaoluo nodded slightly, his gaze sharpening as he examined it.

"What a fine ancient artifact!"

Grand Ascension had been obtained from the Green Pine Temple grotto-heaven. Though it was merely an ancient dharma artifact, it possessed a unique charm. It had followed Li Zhouwei for many years, and now that it had been refined into a spirit embryo, its wondrous qualities were even more pronounced. Liaoluo's eyes were fixed on it, unable to look away for a long moment.

"A fine treasure... a truly fine treasure..."

Li Ximing smiled.

"We had agreed on three hundred days, but I was unexpectedly delayed by a trip to the Western Sea."

All the spoils Li Zhouwei had taken from Vast Cicada were in Liaoluo's hands. Aside from two items to be combined into Li Zhouwei's new weapon, there was also an exceedingly potent Valley Water lotus that required three hundred days to refine. Li Ximing had come, first, for the weapon, and second, to eagerly claim that portion of Valley Water!

Liaoluo finally, and reluctantly, tore his gaze away.

"It has been prepared for you, Fellow Daoist."

He dismissed the women attending him. Once they were alone, his expression turned serious.

"This spirit embryo is magnificent, but it has completely disrupted my plans..."

Li Ximing blinked, raising an eyebrow. Liaoluo sighed.

"That portion of gold embryo I formed from the spiritual materials... I had already beaten it into the shape of a halberd, preparing to refine it for King Wei. I drafted five or six different blade designs, but the Great Daoist Master was never satisfied. Only now, after seeing this spirit embryo, do I realize I nearly ruined a treasure!"

The man, usually so carefree and relaxed, now had an excited, piercing glint in his eyes.

"This treasure is of ancient Wei design and was wielded by King Wei for many years; it could not be more suitable. The Great Daoist Master possesses the [Void-Rim Pure Treasure Furnace], which contains the [Displacement Refining Art]. It is a perfect match for this spirit embryo! It's a hundred times better than anything I could have devised!"

This weapon being forged for Li Zhouwei was no small matter; a vast amount of spiritual materials had been invested. Li Ximing valued it highly. His expression grew solemn as he asked:

"Please, elaborate."

Liaoluo explained, "This treasure furnace in the Great Daoist Master's hands is an artifact of ancient cultivators, a legacy from Encompassing Profoundity's Aegis of the Transverse Dam. It was forged using spiritual materials of the Geng-Metal and Blazing Fire paths. Within it burn three types of Blazing Fire and three types of True Fire. The [Displacement Refining Art] can purge a specific spiritual material from a Spiritual Artifact without having to melt the artifact itself down to liquid... It was originally used by those half-immortal, half-Buddhist cultivators to refine Enlightened Artifacts..."

'I thought my family was wealthy enough... but compared to these people, we're still a step behind. We lack their deep foundations...'

Hearing this, Li Ximing sighed inwardly. His mind raced as he grasped the implication.

"I see... You intend to use the form of Grand Ascension, purge its impurities, and refine new spiritual materials directly into it."

Liaoluo shook his head.

"That would be settling for less. The goal is to preserve Grand Ascension itself—especially the talismans, conceptual imprints, and even the nurturing aura left by the ancient Wei artifact smiths, cultivated from King Wei's many years of wielding it..."

"The method you mentioned can be done by any ordinary refinement art, but the weapon would essentially be a different one. If you refine a Spiritual Artifact possessing spirituality in that way, its spirituality will be lost. But with my family's method, it can be preserved."

Li Ximing knew nothing of artifact refinement, but he could certainly tell a superior method when he heard one. He nodded repeatedly.

"Let us proceed with your method, Fellow Daoist!"

As they spoke, an attendant approached, holding a jade tray covered with a red cloth. When the cloth was lifted, it revealed a bottle and a piece of gleaming gold, both radiating a brilliant light.

The gold had a deep, somber base, yet it shimmered with a dazzling radiance. Li Ximing recognized it—his family had once acquired a piece of this Converging Water's Sinking Savage Aged Gold. It was later presented as a congratulatory gift to the crown prince of the Dragon-kin's White Dragon Shrine.

Liaoluo, however, pointed to the bottle.

"The thing in this bottle is good stuff! It's one of the 'Valley Waters', called [Returning Creek Valley Water]. This water upholds the transfer principle of Valley Water, governed by the Dao of the Profound Mystery Heaven. It cannot be consumed or used for alchemy, which is why it's called Valley Water and not 'Pure Origin'. Of course, many Daoist traditions have been lost, so the terms are often conflated. But its effect is not the least bit inferior. Fellow Daoist, you must try it!"

Joy sparked in Li Ximing's heart. He took the bottle. Inside, a pale gray liquid surged restlessly. He sighed inwardly:

'[Grotto Egret Origin Water] is far too precious; I haven't dared to use it. This Valley Water is the second true spiritual water I've managed to get my hands on!'

He studied it, captivated. Liaoluo smiled.

"I remember Fellow Daoist also possesses a piece of [Long Yue Variable Gold]. It is exceptionally compatible with this [Returning Creek Valley Water]. You could try refining them into a treasure to preserve your life-mandate and avert calamities!"

Li Ximing nodded eagerly. Before Liaoluo could even introduce the piece of Converging Water gold, Li Ximing pushed the jade tray back toward him, his expression serious.

"For all these matters, Fellow Daoist, you have been the one laboring. The subsequent refinement of the Spiritual Artifact will be an even greater trial of mind and body. How can I let you work for free? Please, accept this piece of [Sinking Savage Aged Gold]!"

As a Converging Water cultivator, how could Liaoluo not covet this spiritual material? He hesitated, his face conflicted.

"I was only tasked with solving a few problems for you. How could I dare claim credit for it?"

Li Ximing's expression hardened.

"If Fellow Daoist does not accept, I will surely not dare to seek your help in the future!"

Li Ximing's reasoning was sound. 'Converging Water' items were the most unsuitable for his family. Neither Jiangqian nor Que'Wan cultivated Dao paths that favored Converging Water. It was perfect for repaying this favor; otherwise, he would only have to trade it away later. His attitude was unyielding, practically forcing Daoist Master Liaoluo to accept.

Only then did he press two fingers to his Juque, lightly drawing out a golden object.

Long Yue Variable Gold!

This item had always been stored in his Juque, reserved for cultivating the [Emperor Qi's Light]. But Li Ximing's Dao-Profundity was pitifully low compared to Li Zhouwei's. He barely practiced his few Li Fire spell arts, let alone the [Emperor Qi's Light]. Now, he was decisive, retrieving it without hesitation.

A refusal was one thing, but Liaoluo's attitude was now visibly more cordial, even tinged with the slight embarrassment of one whose hands have been tied by a gift. After all, even without his connection to Diyan, acquiring a spiritual material of Converging Water was an immense boon.

He swiftly stored the Returning Creek Valley Water and the Long Yue Variable Gold, then said with great solemnity,

"Leave this matter to me. I will ensure it is handled perfectly for you!"

Li Ximing smiled.

"The Valley Water is not urgent, but the weapon must be. It won't do to leave King Wei empty-handed."

Liaoluo nodded grimly. But just as he was about to reply, a disciple rushed in.

"Reporting to Daoist Master, a divine ability cultivator has arrived at the mountain's foot. He calls himself the Western Sea rogue cultivator Xie Hu, and is here to find... Daoist Master Zhaojing."

'Xie Hu?!'

Li Ximing's brows shot up, his initial disbelief replaced by a flash of suspicion.

'He actually found this place... It seems he went to the lake... Don't tell me he still wants to settle this score with me!'

Liaoluo fell silent, glancing at him. Li Ximing calmly sipped his tea.

"Are those his exact words?"

The disciple bowed low.

"Yes."

"Then please invite him up."

The mountain rain intensified, blurring the world outside the pavilion into a gray-white curtain. Yet, through the deluge, the crisp sound of colliding jade could be heard. A man in a rain-soaked straw cloak and bamboo hat stood before the hall, a silent, downcast youth behind him. The man drove a long staff, from which hung numerous jade swords, into the ground. His voice was deep.

"Is it Daoist Master Li?"

Li Ximing activated his Life Divine Ability. He saw the rain was saturated with a sharp, piercing aura. He descended from the hall.

"Indeed!"

Xie Hu looked up, his face finally visible from beneath the brim of his hat. He studied Li Ximing for a moment before retrieving a jade box from his robes.

"Senior Yan's lifespan ended. He passed away in the West Curtain Sea, nourishing his ancestral land. I was entrusted by him to come see Fellow Daoist—this is his descendant, Yan Ruzhe."

'Yan Dushui has fallen!'

A wave of desolation washed over Li Ximing. He glanced at the youth. He was not handsome, but he was tall with a resolute face. The boy smartly dropped to his knees and kowtowed several times.

"Junior greets Daoist Master!"

"I will remember you."

Though Yan Dushui was dead, he had burned the last of his life's radiance to its fullest. These simple words represented the favor of a Daoist Master. The youth was overcome with gratitude, kowtowing repeatedly. Li Ximing rewarded him with some spiritual materials and helped him to his feet.

He pinched his fingers, performing a quick calculation and recalling the last time he'd seen him.

"This... is a bit early."

Xie Hu nodded.

"Before his death, he crafted three final talismans to leave as his legacy, and then he passed on. He asked me to deliver a message to you, Fellow Daoist."

"The Zhao and Yan surnames, hidden in the West Curtain, have long forgotten their clan's past connections and Yongjing's wealth. Fearing the clan's extermination, they only wish that for generations they will never return... We hope Zhaojing will, for the sake of private friendship, show mercy... Lin Yi is overwhelmed with panic, fear, and tearful gratitude."

Li Ximing fell silent, grasping the old Daoist Master's intent.

'The Wei and Yan families ultimately have a karmic connection. His family can't even produce a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator now... They truly do not want their descendants involved in the affairs of Jiangnan.'

He let out a long sigh, accepted the jade box, and opened it. Inside, he saw a jade slip, likely concerning the mystic realm. He stored it away and gestured.

"Please!"

But the middle-aged man's expression remained stern. He returned the salute.

"No need, this Xie still has important matters."

Without another word, he walked straight down the mountain, stepping into the Great Void and vanishing.

Li Ximing watched him depart, another weight lifting from his mind. He returned to the hall, where Liaoluo commented,

"A decisive person."

They finished their tea. Liaoluo paused, listening as Li Ximing spoke, his tone grave.

"Does Fellow Daoist have any Pristine Water?"

Liaoluo started.

"This is..."

Li Ximing smiled.

"I don't need to trade for it. I just promised a Fellow Daoist to refine a pill, which needs Pristine Water as a medium. I just need to use it!"

The pill he spoke of was, of course, for Daoist Master Dao Mian of the Western Sea. The pill required Pristine Water for its transformation and Water Mansion for assistance. He already possessed Water Mansion; only the Pristine Water was missing.

But the Daoist Master looked troubled, his brow furrowing in thought. A moment later, his expression cleared, and he smiled.

"I don't have any on hand, but Kuang Yu has a portion of [Tangyi Pristine Water], also called [Clear Tangyi Water Pool Origin]. It's exceptionally wondrous. You can certainly borrow it from her!"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He nodded to himself, a plan already forming.

'It's a good time to visit Xinyu... That child Queyi has also been guarding the overseas territories for many years. I can visit her on the way.'

---

The sea was a vast azure, dotted by circling eagles and sparrows.

A light rain drifted over the island. A woman in a purple dress, her face somewhat pale, paced atop the grand defensive formation. She gazed down at the scenery, her voice calm.

"This is the fourth time... If I had been a step later, this thing might have broken out. The entire Xinyu Archipelago might have turned into filth and sunk, and no one could have stopped it."

Her features were lovely, though etched with worry. It was Daoist Master Tinglan.

Tinglan was not particularly tall. The woman beside her, however, was, clad in a pale cyan Daoist robe. Her features were gentle, her eyes a striking blue-purple, and she shared the faint worry in her expression.

"It's good that there's no movement. If something really happened, this place wouldn't be for us to manage."

Kuang Yu's worry was justified. Tinglan simply frowned.

"Have you reported this matter to Daoist Master Diyan?"

Kuang Yu let out a long sigh.

"You, and Sister Hengxing, have both mentioned this is the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's private affair. I am half a Hengzhu cultivator, only helping out here. How can I ask?"

Tinglan seemd surprised by this. She paused before speaking.

"Then let's wait. The day it truly can't be held back, bring it up then... Your divine ability... has there been any progress? If you can break through, you should be able to buy more time."

Kuang Yu hesitated.

"It's been slow. I failed again a few years ago. Although my immortal foundation is restored, I still have no confidence... The 'Cultivation Transcendence' path has appeared, but it's not easy to cultivate."

The two women descended on the wind, returning to the palace. Rain dripped steadily within the hall. Seeing they were alone, Kuang Yu lowered her voice.

"Fellow Daoist Zhu Gong... how is she?"

At the mention of Zhu Gong, Tinglan's expression grew complicated, tinged with guilt.

Private failings aside, during this era of the Supreme Yang's decline, her close friend from overseas had done more than enough. Yet, she had gained nothing for it. Instead, Tinglan felt she had used her as a pawn...

She sat, her gaze falling.

"I went to see her a few days ago. Her injuries are slightly better, but the deficit is still huge... decades won't be enough, perhaps over a hundred years... When she is slightly better, we can discuss other things..."

Kuang Yu lifted a jade pot, pouring a clear, bright liquid.

"That's right. No matter what, she is still a Purple Mansion Realm. As long as she holds on, doesn't show her face, and waits until the great war between north and south turns... once Kong Tingyun loses her backing, she can escape this deadly predicament!"

Tinglan didn't reply at first. She took a sip, then raised an eyebrow.

"Wine?"

Kuang Yu smiled.

"It's wine refined from the [Feast Blazing Flower] that Nanwu just acquired. He hides it like a treasure. I finally managed to get some, so I'm letting sister have a taste."

"This thing is normally poison; only Blazing Fire cultivators can consume it. But a method from our Daoist tradition uses it to refine wine. The two elements clash and harmonize. Though the wine is strong, it can stabilize one's cultivation and increase dharma power."

Hearing this, Tinglan drained the remaining half of her cup. But at the mention of Guo Nanwu, her expression turned solemn.

"I see Nanwu frequently visiting Ting Province, and he was also in that fight in the Western Sea a year ago. And that kid Ximing often runs to Qusi. What is the Great Daoist Master thinking?"

At the mention of Diyan, Kuang Yu immediately lowered her brows.

"Qusi is surrounded by wolves, and the elder's life-mandate is failing. They are borrowing Wei's prestige for protection."

Tinglan hesitated, then sighed.

"I daren't say much, but you must think clearly. Although Ning Wan's life-mandate is not her own to command, she uses it to barely wear the tiger's skin, intending to protect a branch of the Li clan. But she truly has no confidence, and she doesn't want you dragged into it."

Ning Wan and the Li clan were old acquaintances, a friendship spanning generations from Li Chejing to Li Xuanfeng, and now to Li Ximing. Li Yuanqin was Ning Hemian's biological son. Tinglan could see Ning Wan's intention to protect them, but her pessimism was palpable, leaving Tinglan deeply uneasy.

Kuang Yu merely smiled.

"Sister worries too much."

Tinglan was not one for many words, so she said no more. Kuang Yu silently lifted the green jade pot and refilled her cup.

"The True and Purple paths are two sides of the same coin. Sister, you are in the Purple Smoke blessed land, so you will certainly be safe. After all, Lord Zimu is there, is he not?"

Surprise flashed across Tinglan's features. She raised her cup.

"You... who taught you?"

Kuang Yu smiled.

"The arrangements for the True and Purple paths... the people above see it all clearly. The Purple Qi has not manifested for a long time because it is waiting to ascend to Truth. How could the Great Daoist Master not understand? The elders always understand more than you or I."

Tinglan silently lowered her cup. Kuang Yu, however, drank her own fill, her eyes turning slightly red.

"Sister, you have also experienced what it means to be constrained. The Supreme Yang is in decline; think of the blood and tears. It was only because Lord Zimu was present during the upheaval at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter... that they were willing to let you return..."

"That time is finally past. No matter how the two sides struggle, they won't touch Purple Smoke. But Qusi still has a calamity to overcome. Being in the thick of it, one is never at ease, always fearing disaster... The Great Daoist Master... this is his only chance."

Tinglan saw how heavy Kuang Yu's thoughts were, but she didn't dare press for details. She remained silent. After three rounds of wine, her face was flushed. She finally spoke.

"The world is in turmoil. How many places are truly at ease? Look at this State of Song. Xianyao is dying, but not yet dead. Cheng Qian, having lost his backing, is restless. Chen Yin has lost all his capable descendents. Ning Wan is trapped in Jiangnan. Chensheng's family fortune has declined. Tingyun sits on a bed of needles."

"Sima Yuanli has no title and no reward. He appears carefree, but in truth, he is a running dog, a servile hound, sharing in the nation's anxiety. He lives in fear of the day the True Qi is verified, and the Great Song, having outlived its usefulness, is overthrown. Lingu Lanying has a flawed origin and her divine ability is lacking; no one values her. She has two masters above her, lives in terror of Xiukui stealing her treasure, and is consumed by anxiety..."

"Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing are brilliant today, but they, too, are walking a dangerous cliff path, a road with no clear end. They are just counting the days, fraught with anixety..."

Kuang Yu sipped her wine, the vibrant color in her blue-purple eyes dimming.

"I understand sister's meaning."

Tinglan sighed softly, shared a few more cups, and then rose to her feet.

"Since the crisis here is resolved, I shall return to the blessed land."

She paused, adding with some concern,

"This wine is too strong. You should drink less of it."

Kuang Yu, lost in thought, had been drinking quickly. She watched Tinglan leave, feeling dazed. She frowned at the wine pot, pouting.

"Sister is really something... This whole pot is worth a portion of spiritual resources. Since she already drank a dozen cups, wouldn't it be a waste not to finish... And she dumped it all on me!"

Once the purple-robed Daoist Master had left, the large grotto-mansion felt suddenly empty. Kuang Yu propped her chin on one hand and used the other to pour more wine into her jade cup.

The clear liquid pooled, revealing a faint, tender red. The pale hand set the pot down and, with a flick of her wrist, produced a jade talisman.

The talisman was half a palm long and two fingers wide, glowing with a warm light. It was tied to a red string that snaked around her long, delicate fingertips, dangling and swaying at her wrist.

The dharma lamp flickered. The blue-purple in Kuang Yu's eyes deepened. She was still hesitating when she heard hurried footsteps outside, followed by a joyful female voice:

"Daoist Master... Daoist Master Zhaojing is here!"

"Ah."

Kuang Yu, startled from her reverie, gave a small cry. Whether from wine or panic, the jade talisman slipped from her grasp and clattered onto the table.

A man's smiling voice followed immediately.

"Fellow Daoist Kuang Yu!"

Kuang Yu scrambled to her feet and hurried to the grotto entrance, just as a man in white and gold Daoist robes was stepping inside. Polite as ever, he offered a formal greeting.

"A sudden visit. I fear I've disturbed Fellow Daoist's peaceful cultivation!"

"No matter..."

Kuang Yu, whose nature was normally warm and generous, quickly composed herself. She glanced at him, then turned away with a smile.

"You've come at the right time... I opened a pot of good wine. I was afraid of getting drunk alone. I'll share a sip with you."

Li Ximing had noticed her face was slightly flushed when he entered; now he understood she had been drinking. He found it rather amusing and cupped his hands.

"This is..."

Kuang Yu grinned.

"Wine refined from spiritual resources!"

Li Ximing's brow rose. His tone shifted immediately.

"I can indeed try some."

They moved deeper into the grotto. The jade table was slightly cluttered. A long-necked, emerald-green pot sat upon it, along with two jade cups—one full, one empty. Beside the cups lay a jade talisman.

Kuang Yu's face flushed. She darted forward and snatched the talisman, hiding it in her sleeve. Li Ximing, however, was staring at the empty cup.

"This is..."

She turned back, an impish smile playing on her lips.

"Sister Tinglan was just here. Drank a few cups, got scared, and ran off."

Kuang Yu's personality was a rarity among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Hearing her tease, Li Ximing smiled helplessly.

"I'm afraid my arrival... interrupted things."

"Oh?"

Kuang Yu motioned for him to sit. She deliberately cleared away the empty cup and replaced it with a new one, smiling. "I'm afraid I interrupted _your_ business! You and Sister Tinglan are old friends. True Yang, Purple Yin, Tianxiu mediating light and dark, in ancient times the three Yins assisted... Your Bright Yang's little affair..."

Li Ximing had just raised the cup of pale red wine. He took a sip, and its strong kick shot straight up his nose. Hearing her bizarre string of words, he nearly coughed, freezing in place.

"Ah?"

Having just spouted nonsense, Kuang Yu saw him put the cup down and look up. No matter how bold her personality, she couldn't bear the scrutiny. She quickly ducked her head, hastily refilled his cup, and said through gritted teeth:

"Please!"

Li Ximing downed the cup in one go. A pleasant heat spread through him. He knew this was potent stuff; drinking it was no loss. He smiled and raised his cup to toast her. But the moment he finished, she refilled it.

The woman had moved closer, her face near his. The blue-purple in her round eyes seemed to glow. She held the pot, bit her lip, and put on a fierce expression.

"Sister Tinglan tricked me into drinking a lot... I can't drink anymore. No wasting allowed!"




# Chapter 1132: Cultivation

"Oh..."

Li Ximing's heart jolted. Only after he had drained three cups did the woman before him finally relent. She set down the long-necked jade pot, glanced at him, and smiled.

"How is the taste?"

The Daoist Master let out a breath.

"The flavor isn't strong, but its potency is fierce."

Kuang Yu sat down beside him and smiled again.

"It was originally a spiritual resource, meant to blur the mind and make one forget their worries. It isn't truly wine, which is why it's refined rather than brewed. In the past, cultivators of Azure Profoundity were quite fond of this drink. A lesser cultivator need only drink a single cup and they'd collapse on the spot, drifting, with no idea of what year or month they might awaken."

Li Ximing took another drink, feeling a majestic dharma power rapidly mobilizing his divine ability. He closed his eyes slightly and smiled.

"Fellow Daoist Yin, you have something on your mind. Why not speak of it?"

Kuang Yu tugged at her sleeves. The color in her eyes gradually faded, replaced by a touch of resolve.

She smiled, "Fellow Daoist, do you understand... the full history of the Cultivation Transcendence dao?"

Li Ximing sipped his wine.

"I ask for your guidance."

The woman rose from her position. With her hands clasped behind her back, she began to pace.

"Those of Cultivation Transcendence were originally called 'Zhibei'. They are tied to the heavenly Xingbo star, which is born when the stellar order falls into disarray. Those in the world who follow this path change at the boundary of yin and yang. This dao thrives on perversity and incitement. Whenever there is a change of dynasty, a popular revolt, or the slaying of a general, this star will invariably shine."

Li Ximing looked thoughtful. The woman continued in a low voice,

"Before the ancient Zhou, there was another dynasty named Xia. They used wind and thunder as their totem and belonged to the Thunder Palace above. When the Xia collapsed, the Zhou rose, and the states fell into conflict. With the Thunder Palace fallen, this dao found its place in the chaotic world. It was unruly and wild, spreading wide among the common people. Cultivators of this path sowed discord between the states, shaking the world, and used the chaos to ascend."

"But at the time, the ancient cultivators all considered this dao inauspicious, finding it too steeped in warfare. They followed other paths, such as those aligned with Manifestations Earth, refusing to seek the orthodox way, and so the 'Zhibei' dao gradually withered. This continued until its True Monarch was besieged and abruptly fell. In that same year, the Zhou Emperor obtained the Upper Rite, and with it, a third True Monarch. He then established the formal rites and etiquette, enfeoffing the lands, and the chaotic age finally came to an end."

Though she hadn't said it outright, the implication was clear. Li Ximing, holding his cup, felt a flash of clarity.

"So it was the Upper Rite."

Kuang Yu knew he understood.

"Precisely. Back then, the Upper Rite was the bane of 'Zhibei'. But just as that dao declined to its absolute nadir, a True Monarch from an Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition unexpectedly claimed it first. His title was 'Zhidu', the 'Crossing Holder'. He cultivated neither 'Zhibei' nor the Five Elements, but Yin and Yang. He used a Quest for Gold method that the world could not comprehend to attain the Dao, calling it 'Holding Yang to Cross Yin'. Thus, he achieved 'Yue', or Transcendence."

"From that point on, the dao gradually grew docile and was assimilated into the Immortal Dao. Its name was changed to Cultivation Transcendence, and its relationship with the Upper Rite became far more manageable. This True Monarch lived in deep seclusion; it was only heard that he rebuilt the Green Pine Temple. As for what year he fell... that is lost to time."

At this, she raised her eyebrows, a speculative look in her eyes, and said softly,

"This True Monarch... Fellow Daoist should not be unfamiliar with him, I think."

Li Ximing frowned and shook his head.

Kuang Yu hesitated for a moment before replying,

"He... is the earliest traceable ancestor of the Immortal Mansion lineage. And I fear that today's King Wei has a very deep connection to him as well!"

Li Ximing's heart suddenly clenched.

"What makes you say that?"

Kuang Yu spoke in that same low, haunting tone.

"I once heard a legend. It's said that this True Monarch was cultivating within Green Pine Temple when a disciple returned from his travels to report, saying, 'Master, today the world is in disharmony, yin and yang are imbalanced, and the Great Dao is in chaos. Our dao exists to balance yin and yang; we should make a plan.'"

"The True Monarch replied, 'This Venerable One passed Mount Xiao last year and saw an illustrious aura like a canopy, with auspicious qi circling. An emperor is soon to appear—a king of Bright Yang.'"

"The disciple pleaded for a method to balance yin and yang, but the True Monarch remained silent for a long time, pinching his fingers in calculation. The disciples kowtowed and begged for several days. Finally, the True Monarch drew a treasure from his sleeve. He studied it over and over, lamenting, 'A pitiable thing from the ancestors, soon to be lost among the common folk.' He then lightly tossed it down the mountain, where it vanished into the endless sea. Only then did he speak again."

"'The Bright Yang Imperial Monarch will be executed by it.'"

A chill shot straight to Li Ximing's mind. He stood up, incredulous.

"Azure Profoundity? How is that possible?"

Kuang Yu's expression turned mournful.

"The legend is widespread. Even though my family is of the Wei royal line, I heard it clearly. It's just that no one would believe it, and no one knew what the treasure was. In fact, this treasure was once obtained by the Wei Emperor and suppressed within the palace. Then, when Wei was destroyed, it was lost among the common people, only to eventually find its way back into the hands of Azure Profoundity."

But the man before her couldn't take in her words. The destruction of Wei... every single detail pointed to Comprehending Profoundity. How could Li Ximing possibly believe an Azure Profoundity cultivator was responsible? He was silent for a long time, but the woman gave him no respite. She took a step forward, staring into his eyes.

"But Mount Qusi has a record of this treasure. Fellow Daoist, do you know what it is?"

Li Ximing hesitantly shook his head.

She said, "The Sun Seeker Ring."

The Daoist Master's pupils dilated. He stared fixedly at her, his mind reeling.

'The Sun Seeker Ring... how could it be the Sun Seeker Ring? That item was obtained by my own family... though I was in seclusion at the time...'

His mind felt like it was collapsing. He suddenly recalled her words about a deep connection to Li Zhouwei, and the face of Li Xijun surfaced in his memory:

'When that Sun Seeker Ring saw the Immortal Artifact, its brilliance was infinite, like the sun scorching the earth! Ten thousand rays of light, endless yellow sand, orioles singing and deer calling, green mountains and trees bursting with life... It was as if Bright Yang itself had descended!'

'When I was condensing my immortal foundation, I saw many illusions of golden light, and the foundation condensed on its own, tens of times faster than my own efforts...'

'And the words written on that Sun Seeker Ring... "Green Pine Temple, Lu Jiangxian"...'

Li Ximing raised his head, his voice low.

"The Wei Emperor has not yet fallen."

"He has not."

"So the prophecy wasn't for the year Wei was destroyed. It was for the near future..."

The woman poured more wine, her expression somber.

"Correct. My family elder believes that the fall of Wei was indeed the work of Comprehending Profoundity, just as that True Monarch had long predicted. The Sun Seeker Ring can guide the favor of Bright Yang and give birth to the Mandate of Heaven. The line, 'The Bright Yang Imperial Monarch will be executed by it'... refers to the current King Wei."

"The one who will truly execute Him can only be King Wei."

Li Ximing's brow was furrowed in deep thought.

"I see... So the Sun Seeker Ring was always destined to fall into my family's hands. Only with it could King Wei come to be. The world's situation isn't a simple collision between Bright Yang and True Qi. It was meticulously arranged, layer upon layer, to ensure they would collide."

"The Underworld needs to shatter the order in Jiangbei and the north to re-establish True Qi. Meanwhile, Bright Yang's ascension to the Dao was the key to convincing Luoxia to yield its order... Both sides got what they needed. It's all interconnected."

He clutched his cup, silent for a long moment, his thoughts elsewhere. He muttered,

"There was no accident... Given the thinness of my family's ancestral bloodline, how could we possibly have produced a son of Bright Yang like Zhouwei without the Sun Seeker Ring? My family's entire purpose... was to raise him."

Kuang Yu sipped her wine, waiting for him to process the implications. When he fell silent, she spoke again.

"Cultivation Transcendence has been proven once more, by the current one who achieved the Dao when Liang was destroyed. Which path he walks, I need not say."

Ancient cultivators could be named freely, but it was inconvenient to speak of modern ones. Kuang Yu pursed her lips, watching him.

Li Ximing sighed softly. How could he not understand?

"You mean... the current situation with King Wei is highly beneficial to you."

Kuang Yu stared at him, her gaze unflinching.

"Yes. And not just me."

"The manifestations of Cultivation Transcendence are complex, its dao lineage obscure. Even a direct disciple of Lord Yingze had to rely on the fall of Liang to achieve the Dao. Although my own lineage possesses four nearly complete divine ability lineages, we have no True Monarch from the Yue Cultivating Sect to transmit the dharma. If I don't seize this opportunity, I will likely never master more than a few divine abilities in my lifetime, let alone step past the threshold of Purple Mystery!"

Her eyes were steel.

"My brother, currently in seclusion breaking through... is also cultivating Cultivation Transcendence! This matter benefits more than just me. Cultivators of this path are vital aides, extremely beneficial for The Recent Usurpation!"

Li Ximing fell silent for a long time. He realized that the Daoist Master from Qusi had laid more than one stone. While fulfilling his own desire for seeking the Dao, he had not neglected Qusi. If he could nurture two mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators—perhaps even two with the potential to reach Purple Mystery... With Daoist Master Liaoluo to guide the transition, both Mount Qusi and the Yin family would be secure for five hundred years.

He silently poured the last of the wine from the jade pot, filling a single cup.

"And what can I do to help you, Fellow Daoist?"

He saw the woman's hand, which she had held behind her back for so long, finally move. A jade talisman from her sleeve was extended toward him. Her fingers released it, and it landed on the table with a soft click.

Li Ximing gently picked it up. His hand suddenly clenched tight. As his spiritual sense flowed into it, a majestic torrent of information flooded his mind, coalescing into several large characters.

[Yin-Yang Mutual Refinement and Conjunction Method].

He froze, his brows shooting up.

Kuang Yu pursed her lips and suddenly leaned in, her face extremely close to his. He could see the blue-purple reflection in her pupils and smell a faint, clean fragrance.

She gritted her teeth.

"I need to borrow your manifestation."

The words exploded in his mind, and all the preceding information snapped into place. Li Ximing's emotions became instantly complex as he stared blankly at the Daoist Master before him.

'So that's the "borrowing" she meant... the dao of yin-yang conjunction...'

Li Ximing was not at all unfamiliar with this. His own earliest cultivation had been partially based on this very principle. But as his cultivation advanced, the Li family of that time could not find a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to practice with him. After he reached the Purple Mansion Realm, it became even more impossible.

Although the Bright Yang path had this benefit, he had long since cast it from his mind. As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had passed through countless illusions, he had abandoned such desires long ago. From start to finish, he'd held no improper thoughts toward Kuang Yu.

He remained frozen. Kuang Yu's eyes, though clear, now held a trace of confusion.

The atmosphere in the cave abode grew taut. Yin Xinyu seemed to misunderstand his hesitation, and her face paled slightly. Just as she was about to speak, the man before her picked the jade talisman back up, pressed it into her hand, and smiled.

"We are simply two people, each taking what we need. That is all."

Kuang Yu gave a curt nod, her expression still strained, but the tension in her brow visibly eased. She turned away on her toes, still avoiding his gaze, as she heard Li Ximing say with a light laugh,

"It is merely cultivation. Why hesitate? It makes me seem ungracious."

His words clearly defused her anxiety. Kuang Yu spun back around, gritting her teeth.

"You think this is easy for me? I have no idea what you're thinking. I've always heard how well you get on with this person or that one. Tinglan praises you constantly. If you favor someone else and hold reservations, and I just bluntly propose this, wouldn't I be humiliating myself? Matters of the dao cannot be spoken of lightly. If word got out and was twisted, I couldn't explain the truth even if I had a thousand mouths."

Li Ximing just shook his head.

"No wonder you brought up all that talk about Purple Yin."

Kuang Yu was already mortified. Hearing him mention it again, she snatched the jade talisman and tossed it at his chest.

"Just focus on your own cultivation!"

Li Ximing laughed, catching it easily. He raised the wine pot, filled both jade cups to the brim, and held his aloft, his eyes bright.

"Let's dispense with the pleasantries. After this cup, you owe me no favor, and I owe you no debt. We each walk our own path. This is for cultivation, and nothing more."

Kuang Yu stared at him, her expression complicated. The smile faded from her face, replaced by a solemn gravity. She raised her cup.

"Many thanks, Fellow Daoist."

Their eyes met. They drank together and fell into a long silence. Li Ximing, possessing the Life Divine Ability, processed the potent drink almost instantly. Only now did he begin to feel a slight warmth spreading through him. He smiled.

"I originally came to ask you for Pristine Water. I nearly forgot my purpose!"

Kuang Yu listened carefully to his intended use, then immediately retrieved a jade box from her sleeve. It was shrouded in a mystical white mist.

"This is Tangyi Pristine Water," she said softly. "It was a precious gift from Sister Hengxing when I achieved the Dao. Take it and use it as you need. Just be warned, this item must not go near fire. You must be careful to contain it. If you let it escape... it will be nearly impossible to find again."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly as he accepted it.

"Many thanks, Fellow Daoist."

"Such needless courtesy."

The spiritual drink's effects were not overwhelming, and Kuang Yu had already regained her composure. She escorted him to the main hall. Outside, the heavy rain continued to fall. She heard the man say politely,

"I will study this carefully. I shall return in three months."

"Oh, right."

Kuang Yu shut the hall door and hurried back to her cave abode. She pushed open the stone door and walked to the innermost chamber as the dharma lamps extinguished one by one behind her. She lay down on the couch, silently staring at the faint glint of light on the bed's edge.

After an unknown time, she suddenly sat up. She gazed at her pale, smooth face in the mirror, her expression calm.

"It's not so bad."

...

The rain pattered down. Li Ximing took a few steps on the stairs outside the hall, his mind churning.

'Diyan once mentioned that Kuang Yu is a key figure in the Qusi Daoist tradition Tradition... That means he intends to protect her. The implications of Yin Juexi cultivating Cultivation Transcendence are completely different from Kuang Yu cultivating it...'

'Yin Juexi is cultivating it to leverage the authority under Zhouwei, both to rapidly increase his own strength and to be useful to Zhouwei. That Great Daoist Master doesn't care if Yin Juexi survives the process. But Kuang Yu... she is the true pillar he left for the Yin family. This allows her to pursue the greatest benefits... while maintaining a clear separation from Ting Province.'

Every family had its own calculations. Li Ximing didn't find this offensive; in fact, seeing this clearly was what led to their agreement. Still, as he sorted through the schemes, his mind was turbulent. He stood for a moment with his hands behind his back, gazing at the downpour.

'Dao Mian's pill requires both Pristine Water and Water Mansion water. This is perfect. I can use the Vast Lake Array-Furnace from the Water Mansion Pill Formation Technique at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. I'll spend some time there to begin refining the pill, and I can stop back at Xinyu on the way.'

Just then, a happy voice called out.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

He saw a woman bowing at the foot of the steps. She was dressed in white, with a round, pleasant face. She wore no bright cosmetics, only a simple hairpin, yet she carried an air that was at once majestic and gentle. Li Ximing smiled in approval.

"Queyi, you carry yourself better and better!"

Li Queyi smiled politely, straightening up.

"Junior is running about on the seas all year and cannot serve the clan. I am deeply ashamed."

"Nonsense." Li Ximing waved his hand. "I hear you send things home every year and even consult with your brother Jiangzong on matters of trade. Having the heart to do so is more than enough. It's far better than some who stay in Jiangnan and don't return for a decade or more."

As one of the pair of treasured daughters who had left Moongaze Lake together, it was obvious that seeing Li Queyi made Li Ximing think of Li Quexi. His faint smile sent a chill down Li Queyi's back, and she bowed her head.

"Quexi is a Purple Smoke cultivator and a personal disciple; she must be terribly busy... I've heard... she also sends letters home often..."

After decades of trials overseas, Li Queyi had been completely transformed. She was decisive and capable. Perhaps as a young girl she had envied Li Quexi, but now that feeling had faded into simple melancholy. She still held out hope that her younger sister would align with Ting Province.

Li Ximing waved his hand, signaling that the topic was closed. He took a step, hands behind his back.

"I heard some days ago that nearly half of Jianghuai has been reclaimed and they need someone to assume the role of Holder of the Profound. How will Sima Xunhai reply?"

Li Queyi chose her words carefully.

"My husband declined the position and yielded it to the Chen Clan."

This was common knowledge. Chen Yin was the most desperate at the moment and had surely offered significant concessions. But even if he failed this time, the position would likely fall to Sima Xunhai next. Li Ximing changed the subject.

"Is Sima Xunhai good to you? Is there any trouble on the island? If a woman of our family is being bullied, I won't spare him."

A flash of gratitude crossed Li Queyi's face.

"My husband has been devoted and single-minded for many years, and he treats me exceptionally well. As for the island... there is occasional turmoil in the earth veins, sometimes quite intense. He always has to break seclusion to manage it, but the rest of the time, it is very stable."

Li Ximing finally relaxed and nodded. His form dissolved into light and traversed the Great Void, leaving the area. As he flew east over the vast sea, his expression slowly grew pensive.

'This issue with the earth veins on Xinyu isn't new. Tinglan has mentioned it several times... something about a cultivator breaking through... and talk of She Immortals.'

At that thought, he abruptly stopped. He looked down at the ocean, considered for a moment, and then his light plunged into the water.

The spiritual qi in this part of the sea was not abundant; most of it was concentrated on the island itself. In moments, he reached the seabed. Li Ximing scanned the area, then activated the Light of the Six Harmonies and performed a quick calculation. He found nothing out of the ordinary.

But it was this very result that put his casual mind on high alert.

'She just said there was turmoil in the earth veins. There should at least be a trace of Baleful Earth qi or leaking earth fire. How could it be completely normal? "Completely normal" is the greatest anomaly!'

He maintained a casual expression, shaking his head with a small laugh, but his spiritual sense flared.

'Spirit Probe!'

His vision instantly expanded. Layers upon layers of rock and sediment dissolved before his eyes. A massive formation base, glowing with purple light, flickered into view and then vanished as his senses pushed deeper.

But beneath that shimmering purple formation, there was an empty void of pure radiance.

At the base of this great array, there were no earth veins, no baleful fire. There was only another void, vast as a separate world, and within this endless radiance floated a single speck of colored light.

As his gaze fixed on that radiance, Li Ximing felt as if he were staring into roiling, endless lava. He could see nothing _but_ the light. A cool sensation surged from his Shengyang Acupoint, driving back the overwhelming pressure. The prickling numbness faded, allowing him to finally see the speck of light clearly.

The light was bizarre, a deep brownish-yellow, like a flame shining through a pinprick. It blurred at the edges, but the center was impossibly bright, illuminating a kaleidoscope of images.

At times, it showed earth and stone warping, baleful magnetism separating. At others, it showed the five colors layering and combining to form gods. He saw myriad ghosts and deities, wielding blades and halberds, their faces infinitely fierce. He saw Monarchs and kings offering sacrifices, slaughtering oxen and sheep, as heaven and earth became one...

This single point of light seemed as vast as the cosmos and as fine as a mote of dust. Vaguely, he could perceive countless divine beings suppressed beneath it, all in a posture of holding it aloft, their eyes crackling with lightning, their immortal might overwhelming.

It was this seemingly ordinary, palm-sized speck of light that sent a cataclysmic shock through Li Ximing's heart, forcing his mind blank.

His heart felt as if it had been seized by an unprecedented, violent impulse.

'This...'

A boundless, overwhelming wave of desire and awe rose from that mental void. An instant stretched into eternity. He saw the sun and moon fall, mountains and seas invert. An infinite, forgotten past seemed to stream past him, tumbling into the pitch-black Great Void.

The urge to _possess_ it was catastrophic, transcending all other desires. It converged in his mind, an instinct that needed no name or comparison. It was the cat seeing the tiger, the serpent meeting the dragon.

All these urges solidified into a single, blazing thought.

'Metallic Essence.'

'Manifestations Earth Metallic Essence.'

The ever-shifting light seemed to speak, pouring the unadulterated Great Dao into his mind, whispering the secrets of the cosmos.

'Seize it... You can be reincarnated... You can be invincible... You can dominate all living beings... You can establish new gods...'

But all he felt was an icy chill flooding the back of his neck.

'What "cultivator breakthrough"? What "earth vein trembling"? All of it... it's all because there is a Metallic Essence hidden here! A Metallic Essence potent enough to drive every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the world into a frenzy!'

'Whose Metallic Essence is this? It's so terrifying that an entire formation was needed to seal it away! All those Great Daoist Masters from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... could not a single one of them make use of it? And what is its relationship to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition itself?!'

Yet, the cooling sensation in his Shengyang Acupoint, which had swelled from a trickle to a roaring river, kept his expression and actions perfectly neutral. He feigned a dismissive laugh, shook his head, and stepped back into the Great Void.

'Most importantly... this isn't just any essence. It's _Manifestations Earth_! It is the "She" Earth, the Altar Earth, one of the two ancient Sheji earths. The Altar Earth that almost no one in modern times dares to cultivate... Such audacity! Such terrifying power!'

He emerged from the Great Void, not knowing how far he had traveled, and flew east. After what felt like thousands of li, a chain of islands appeared on the ocean's surface. Their shapes were rugged and irregular, and cultivators could be seen flying to and fro.

This was the Deer Weeds Island, the location of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion.

But by now, there was not a shred of calm left in the Daoist Master's heart. He was utterly horrified.

'No wonder... no wonder...'

This was the first time Li Ximing had ever witnessed such a thing. Setting aside the rational temptation of a Metallic Essence, the mere act of _looking_ at it felt like staring directly into the boundless secrets of the cosmos, witnessing an infinity of Quest for Gold methods all at once.

'No wonder back in Anhuai Heaven, the instant a Metallic Essence appeared, all the assembled immortals, demons, and Maha lost their composure. They abandoned their factions and distinctions, fleeing recklessly into the grotto-heaven... Metallic Essence... _this_ is Metallic Essence...'

Excluding those of the Demon attribute, Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had all passed the trial of boundless illusions. Their mental fortitude was extraordinary. And yet, even they would be driven to such impulsive madness.

'If this Manifestations Earth Metallic Essence were to fall openly into the mortal world—I fear it could instantly refine an entire divine domain or immortal kingdom on the spot!'




# Chapter 1133: The Pristine Deficiency

The world was desolate and clear, blanketed by flurries of white snow.

A mirror on the table glowed brightly, its light illuminating the dark and silent depths of the cave abode, streaking through the gloom like a shuttle.

The ground in that region was a limitless expanse of silver-white, reflecting countless profound lights. Dense patterns materialized within it, forming a large pentagon. Jet-black, profound pillars stood throughout the space, emitting a mysterious radiance.

As these illusory lights converged, they formed a high platform in the very center. Behind it stood three profound gates. The area below was dark, paved with five-colored bricks—dark gold, dark azure, dark crimson, dark white, and dark brown—all carved with intricate, colorful patterns.

On the platform rested a palm-sized, unopened stone box.

A torrent of divine ability roiled across the steps, drawn along five distinct patterns into the profound pillars. It surged and swelled, seeming as if it might burst from the mirror at any moment and charge into this unknown world.

The white-robed man beside the table watched quietly, completely unaffected. Yet his thoughts were not on the surging divine ability before him; his mind was heavy with other matters:

'The Sun Seeker Ring... that's the treasure.'

According to the information Lu Jiangxian had, the Sun Seeker Ring was supposed to have come from the Green Pine Temple of old. Because that group of cultivators who entered it were scattered, it eventually fell into the Six Ding Merging Fire Token

And this Spiritual Artifact, drawn by the strings of fate, ultimately fell upon a lake... and that lake was Moongaze Lake! If the token's fall was orchestrated, it could only have been the work of one group.

'Mount Dali.'

'The Six Ding Merging Fire Token and the Sun Seeker Ring... were deployed by the remnants of the Immortal Mansion. If the news from Mount Qusi is correct, then Bright Yang's fall... also aligned with the interests of the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition—or at least, with the ideology of the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition at that time.'

Lu Jiangxian himself possessed Bright Yang Metallic Essence and knew of Mount Luoxia's arrangements regarding the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment's status. He could be said to know everything clearly, but precisely because of this, he had a different perspective from these Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

'Lǐ Qiányuán's fall is untraceable, yet Mount Luoxia's actions were calm and steady. Regardless of whether the Sun Seeker Ring existed, Bright Yang's fall was already a certainty. It was only a matter of time...'

'Crossing Holder knew Bright Yang couldn't last. He used this ring, most likely, to ensure that the initiative for the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment would later fall into the hands of Azure Profoundity cultivators.'

'And the ideology of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition—at least, its superficial ideology—remains the same: "As long as the position is filled, who cares who fills it?" All that mattered was accelerating the Imperial Monarch's fall.'

'Beneath this dual-layered game, Emperor Wei made his own arrangements.'

Lu Jiangxian's thoughts grew heavy,

'He also anticipated this and left himself a contingency. He placed his own Metallic Essence within it... perhaps he broke the original method and replaced it, or perhaps he had other plans. It was hidden extremely deep. Thus, this treasure flowed back to the Azure Profoundity.'

'It likely passed through the hands of many powerful cultivators. Perhaps they saw nothing amiss, or felt it required a Profound Mystery locus to activate. In the end, it fell into the hands of the Immortal Mansion, which finally raised the curtain on this grand show.'

'So, what role did the Azure Pond Sect play? The cultivators who went to Moongaze Lake year after year were a line of communication. And Li Mutian, who walked out of Lijing Village, brought back the Underworld's signal of passage. The barely surviving Mount Dali, perhaps obeying an immortal decree or perhaps finally seizing a chance to grasp the initiative, immediately entered the game. They joined in to fulfill the prophecy: "The Bright Yang Imperial Monarch will meet his execution."'

'The fox Demon beast being able to accompany Lǐ Zhōuwēi from the lake into the sea... that was one of the benefits of grasping the initiative...'

Lu Jiangxian reflected silently, his mind gradually clearing:

'Many things were not personally arranged by my so-called "previous self"... they were the inevitable tide of the world's progression. I merely interfered in the process of the "Mandate of Heaven for Bright Yang descending upon the world."'

'Therefore... whether it was the Yang family or Xueyang, when they met Lǐ Zhōuwēi, they were all calm, as if expecting him. "The Bright Yang Imperial Monarch will meet his execution"... but that never meant "An Azure Profoundity descendant will set things right." From start to finish, he was only ever the emperor-slaying sword, destined to emerge with the changing tides. Whether he succeeded or failed... not even Crossing Holder could calculate such a thing across thousands of years, not with so many True Monarchs entering the world... He merely seized the crucial point, securing the initiative for the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition.'

Lu Jiangxian's gaze grew heavier,

'My actions... their influence on the situation is neither large nor small... But at the very least, Vast Cicada's death already caused the Dharma Master to miscalculate... It further proves that before True Qi is verified, the Yang family needs Lǐ Zhōuwēi more than Luoxia does.'

He let out a long breath. The falling snow in the world outside grew heavier. Bright moonlight poured down, piling up beneath the jade steps. On the luminous jade table, an object had suddenly appeared.

It was perfectly round and bright, like a pellet the size of a fingernail, resting in a jade cup, continuously emitting a soft, winding radiance.

Vast Cicada's fall was the result of a clash that transcended the Purple Mansion Realm level. The Precious Tusk Golden Land had a connection to the mortal world, so Lu Jiangxian hadn't dared to overtly claim it. But Lǐ Zhōuwēi's strike had shaken the Precious Tusk Golden Land, exposing it to his eyes for a single instant.

And Lu Jiangxian had cultivated the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core—a unique immortal art and grotto-heaven creation secret! In that one instant, he had already seen through seventy or eighty percent of the Precious Tusk Golden Land's essence.

'The way of Buddhist cultivators... is truly profound!'

'The Precious Tusk Golden Land is all about position! An ancient Buddhist cultivator seems to have borrowed an extremely high-status 'specification' and used a method similar to, but cruder than, the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core to verify this Golden Land with their own cultivation.'

'But after obtaining this Golden Land, the ancient Buddhist cultivator used their own position as a springboard, binding the Golden Land to themself. When they died after verifying the Dao, the Golden Land withered with them. Yet, because of that high-status object they borrowed when verifying it, it was not completely cast down. Instead, it transformed into a void.'

'Once it became a void, it should have never returned. But the corpses, stupas, and other things with inherent wondrous power and a degree of position left inside... by chance, they sensed the outside world and re-linked to a Buddhist cultivator's position. The Golden Land thus began to shine once more.'

'It has a very faint flavor of the Golden Core position distinction. After all, I only saw a shell; this is the most I can sense. For more details... I'm afraid I'll have to investigate the Buddhist cultivator Daoist tradition...'

But none of that mattered. With the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core in hand, what fate could an ownerless Golden Land exposed before him, Lu Jiangxian, possibly have?

'Naturally, it's mine!'

This pearl represented the authority of the Precious Tusk Golden Land. So long as he willed it—even with the Precious Tusk Golden Land currently being constrained by that Dharma Master from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and colluding with that dharma realm—it would immediately become Lu Jiangxian's personal Dao-sanctum!

'With my position... I wonder what this Golden Land will transform into!'

'It might even swallow the Great Adoration Dharma Realm whole... That Incense Master would become a minor Vajra before my throne, and that Realm Master would be a mere abbot beneath my seat. Then the dharma realm would burst through the heavens, forcing that Greatest Enlightenment Zen Heaven Acharya to jump out...'

Even if he couldn't personally possess it, through his careful study these past few days, he knew that as long as he was willing, he could use an immortal art like the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core to choose a master for the Precious Tusk Golden Land!

He sneered inwardly,

'That Way of Great Desire... can forget about ever scheming for this Precious Tusk Golden Land!'

After digesting the news from Qusi, he silently shifted his gaze to the stone box before him.

''Manifestations Earth''

Lǐ Xīmíng was observing the subterranean landscape, so he naturally couldn't avoid Lu Jiangxian's presence. The expanse of white light he saw was not some other object, but an illusion manifested by Lu Jiangxian. This place was rather strange; it was not wise to look too closely.

In Lu Jiangxian's judgment, this 'Manifestations Earth' Metallic Essence before him had an absolutely extraordinary origin. Even with the formation concealing it, the moment he entered this place, he could feel the extremely high position emanating from the Metallic Essence!

'If not for this formation, it wouldn't matter what void-isolating place you put it in... The moment its mystery unraveled, its spiritual energy would burst forth...'

The fluctuation from this Metallic Essence was as plain as the sun and moon. But the formation established here was even more ingenious. Through diversion, transformation, and guiding the five elements, it actually used the position and mystery of 'Manifestations Earth' itself to conceal the Metallic Essence!

'The skill behind this great formation is so high it even has a trace of immortal qi. It's likely from the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition.'

But this method was ultimately a clever trick, and not without its flaws. No matter how dynamic the formation was, it could never be as dynamic as the Metallic Essence itself. The Metallic Essence was constantly assaulting the great formation, setting off tremors time and again. If a cultivator didn't suppress and resolve this, it was highly likely to break the fragile balance and fly out into the mortal world!

Perversely, the formation was constructed using the power of the Metallic Essence itself. Once control was lost, it would immediately lose its power source. It would be utterly incapable of offering any resistance and would melt away and vanish in an instant under the radiance of the Metallic Essence.

'The entire Xinyu Archipelago would be reduced to turbid mud. This 'Manifestations Earth' Metallic Essence also has a drifting, divine-like immortal intent. If those great cultivators don't intervene, I'm afraid it will declare itself an ancestor and establish a boundless, evil land.'

Lu Jiangxian paced for two steps before raising his gaze. The five stone pillars shimmered with different illusory colors, each bearing deeply carved inscriptions, one following the next, from left to right:

'Secret Manual of the Baixiang Peak Matron Monarch's Dao Manifestation'

The Daoist mysteries in these words were profound, the sentences deep. Even with Lu Jiangxian's high Dao-Profundity, he couldn't help but pause, silent for a long moment.

'It truly is a Sheji inheritance. This is a secret art for manifesting Manifestations Earth and Returning Earth, nourishing cultivators, and upholding righteous cultivation. It must have been written by a supreme cultivator.'

This person's understanding of the Manifestations Earth Dao was terrifyingly deep. Although Lu Jiangxian was proficient in many Daos, he had never delved into Earth Virtue and was sorely lacking in it. Gazing at this text was like staring up at a towering mountain.

Although he had no use for it at the moment, he still committed it to memory, nodding to himself,

'This place is extremely well-hidden, almost impossible for anyone to reach. It's a Sheji Daoist tradition, and it has a 'Manifestations Earth' Metallic Essence... It will definitely be useful.'

'What's more... the five paths of Geng (Metal), Renewing (Wood), Pristine (Water), Blazing (Fire), and Manifestations (Earth) are all related. They are the paths of transformation and revolution among the Five Virtues. Even if I can't obtain a Pristine Water Metallic Essence, just seeing this Manifestations Earth is beneficial for reference.'

With that, he raised a brush to study it in detail. The snow falling in the world outside grew even more frantic. An unknown amount of time passed before his faintly calculating hand stilled. His brows furrowed tighter and tighter.

'Something's wrong...'

''Xuan' (Manifestation) means to express, to scatter, to spread, to clarify. When upheld righteously, the king's command is spread, and all follow it like a shadow. When used for rebellion, a single rogue can rise, and the world will boil in revolt. Thus, it is revered as the master of Sheji.'

'Among its techniques, one divine ability, 'Rite of the Sovereign Earth', is the most important—to replace the world's heart with one's own!'

Snowflakes fell. The jade slip on the desk glowed with a warm light. The hand hesitated for a moment before lifting the brush,

'But it's far more than just that. Since 'Pristine Water' was mentioned, there are five related divine abilities that are spoken of in the same breath. They are called the "Five Transgressions," also known as the "Five Transgressive Audiences," which can be concurrently cultivated by Cultivation Transcendence cultivators.'

'Besides Manifestations Earth's Rite of the Sovereign Earth, there is also Geng Metal's Present Departs Old, Renewing Wood's Spring Before Sickness, and Blazing Fire's Burning the Old Chamber...'

'These ancient names seem convoluted, but in the orthodox inheritance of Wanling Heaven, these divine abilities have even clearer aliases!'

'They are 'World's Heart', 'World's Revolution', 'World's Change', and 'World's Scorch'!'

'Earth, Metal, Wood, Fire... only water is missing. It should be 'Pristine Water'.'

Lu Jiangxian set down his brush, a look of confusion on his face.

'But the last one is not water... it's Bright Yang's 'World's Radiance'!'

Possessing several immortal arts, his Dao-Profundity provided a high-level, overarching understanding. As he cross-referenced, he truly grasped a point of confusion. He remained silent for a long time as the words on the jade slip flickered with light.

'Why do the Five Transgressions lack water? The various classics only express confusion, with not so much as a word of explanation. Only an ancient cultivator from the Liang dynasty, "Zhou Rao," said, "Water is said to moisten and flow down, thus it does not contend. It favors low places and abhors high ones, thus it has no transgression."'

This was Lu Jiangxian's original understanding as well. But now that he had seen the 'Manifestations Earth' Metallic Essence itself, he immediately realized those words only touched the surface, not the core. They were ultimately a lower-level interpretation.

'The Five Transgressions are, in the end, the Five Virtues, not Cultivation Transcendence. They have both a righteous and a reverse aspect. The "Transgression" is the exterior, but the "Transformation" is the interior. The Five Transgressions must include water, representing the concept of "The people are the water, the ruler is the boat; when the water is calm, there is prosperity; when the water is wroth, the boat is overturned." Logically, this should be 'Pristine Water's 'Heavy Murk'... That divine ability can bewitch the hearts of men; it was the source of the demonic calamity in Jiangnan all those years ago.'

'If I extrapolate based on Daoist arts, 'Pristine Water's 'Heavy Murk' should be that missing divine ability. It could well be called 'World's Overturning'!'

But Lu Jiangxian had already collected all the Pristine Water divine abilities. Chi Buzi even cultivated this path, so he had seen it clearly. 'Heavy Murk' was always missing something... Compared to 'World's Radiance' and 'World's Heart', it had lost its fundamental essence!

'The theoretical extrapolation from the Daoist arts conflicts with the current principles of magic... If my deduction isn't wrong, then it is highly likely that the Pristine Water Fruition Attainment itself has a problem... This is the root cause of why Du Qingzang stays reclusively indoors, bitterly suppressing his so-called 'dragon nature'!'

His eyes shone brightly as he stood up.

'Otherwise, with his orthodox Azure Profoundity Supreme Yang Daoist tradition method for ascending to immortality, he wouldn't be in such a wretched state!'

Lu Jiangxian grew more certain, his confidence approaching sixty percent.

'That's right... The 'Pristine Water' concept is about rising and sinking, clarity and turbidity. It is the water of ponds and pools, water that springs from the earth or descends from the sky, water that does not connect with the external waters... It has been 'repaired' to perfection, so perfect it seems natural. But is that a good thing? If the Feathered Serpent of old held such a 'Pristine Water' Fruition Attainment, why would it have needed to go to the sea?'

'Pond water—it cannot raise waves. This means it has lost the ability for 'the water to overturn its ruler'! 'World's Overturning' thus became 'Heavy Murk'. These two transformations are two sides of the same coin, revealing the deficiency in Pristine Water!'

'The "Pristine Unification Transformation" that the True Hornless Dragon spent its life's Dao-fruit on... was definitely not as simple as just swallowing something. Even its descendant could preside over the major event of the Water Mansion losing its 'vastness' (a play on Vast Ocean). How could the ancestor not do more? Pristine Unification was not about mutual fusion and growth. I fear that of the five waters, all except Valley Water... were corrupted by the Dragon-kin. Pristine Water was just the first!'

His gaze was now intensely bright, fixed burningly on the jade slip before him.

"But... why was it replaced by World's Radiance? Why the completely unrelated Bright Yang? Even if there was a scheme, Emperor Wei and the True Hornless Dragon weren't even from the same era!"

"Li Qianyuan, this Bright Yang Imperial Monarch... he was so close to the Dragon-kin. What does that signify?"

He had peeled back one layer of the mystery, only to see a deeper, slumbering plot. A wave of emotion rose in his heart.

'These figures... their abilities are so incredibly high! Their schemes... so unfathomably deep...'

"If... if I had a Pristine Water Metallic Essence in my hand... I could definitely uncover this mystery and understand what Du Qingzang and the Dragon-kin are plotting!"

He lowered his gaze, his thoughts surging:

'Chi Buzi is indeed seeking Valley (Water)... but with his Dao-Profundity, he might just be able to trigger the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal... Inside it is a Feathered Serpent Pristine Water Metallic Essence. Not the current Pristine Water Noon Origin Talismanic Speech Essenc"—but the most ancient, most glorious Pristine Water!'

(End of Chapter)




# Chapter 1134: The Valley Method

'The injury is from Merging Fire, but its roots are in the life-mandate. Among all the injuries to the world's Dao Lineages, this one ranks among the most troublesome to remove...'

'Nourishment from Valley Water would be best, but he isn't a Valley Water cultivator. A medicinal pill cannot easily penetrate the depths of the life-mandate as Merging Fire can. Only when the Water Mansion receives it and the clear water transforms it can there be success.'

Since Dao Mian had asked him to refine the pill, this line of thinking had certainly been verified many times. The key ingredient was a Pulse-Heart Origin Valley Liquid, a spiritual resource of Valley Water hidden deep within the earth. This 'Earth Water' accumulated without releasing. Once it pierced deep into the life-mandate, it would surge forth, its imagery transforming to become a 'Cave Spring'—which was, naturally, the clear water.

This old cultivator, who was of the Whole Pill nature, had researched this healing method for many years and clarified all its principles. Even so, with Li Ximing's current, terrifying pill arts, the refinement was still incredibly difficult. It took a full thirty-one days just to get the pill on the right track, leaving him feeling drenched in a cold sweat.

'This is, after all, a spiritual water refinement method. My Valley Wind Guide-Fire technique is useless, so I have to handle every single step personally... If I hadn't achieved World's Radiance, I'm afraid I would have truly suffered.'

As he released his hands from the furnace, he felt his six senses exhausted and his divine abilities drained. He used World's Radiance to seal the furnace and harmonize the various energies within. Tapping two fingers to his waist, he found the jade stone meant for contacting Liu Changdie was glowing brightly.

'Hm? We're on the same island. Why use a jade stone to send a message...'

Though he received the message, he didn't immediately step out into the air. Instead, with a flick of his sleeve, his figure appeared outside the pill room. He took two steps, and just as expected, a man hurried over and bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing glanced at him. The man looked middle-aged, with a robust body and a steady expression. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"Clan Brother... it has been some years."

Hearing this, Li Wen revealed a look of panic and knelt to the ground.

"Daoist Master, you praise this lowly one too much!"

This man had once been a pillar of the Li family, loyal and devoted, wielding two golden hammers. But his cultivation method was insufficient. As the Li family rose, he was slowly left behind. He had been left to guard this remote overseas island, holding authority over nearly all of its defenses. This was a sign of great trust. Li Ximing shook his head.

"When I was young, I vividly remember you, Clan Brother, guarding Father with your golden hammers, vigilant from dawn till dusk. Why be so modest?"

Li Wen pressed his forehead to the ground.

"I would not dare."

Li Ximing saw that his essence, qi, and spirit were full, and he carried a dignified air. Feeling moved, he quickly adopted a serious tone.

"Senior Liu..."

The jade stone on his person was warm; it was clearly Liu Changdie's doing, not wanting to disturb his refinement. Li Wen just said,

"Daoist Master, just after you entered seclusion, two groups of people came to the island. They wanted to trade for the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill you possess. Daoist Master Yuanbian was afraid you might come out at just the wrong time and find it difficult to refuse. He had this lowly one come to remind you. He said if I saw you exit seclusion, I must ask: if you have no intention of trading, you need not show yourself... For now, they have both been put off."

Li Ximing was stunned.

"Two groups of people? For the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill?"

The strange look in the eyes of Xiang Chun and the other man when he had extended Li Xuanxuan's life flashed through his mind. He found it amusing and silently shook his head. But the man before him continued,

"Ten days ago, another Daoist Master came to the island. He's been discussing something with Daoist Master Yuanbian, and seems to have a request. That Daoist Master is on the island discussing the Dao with him, waiting for you to emerge."

He lowered his gaze and added, "One more thing... people from Yinzhou came. They said... there was news, and they handed something over to Daoist Master Yuanbian."

Li Wen actually didn't know if this was Liu Changdie's personal business or a Li family matter, but his loyalty was absolute, and he reported it without omission. Li Ximing's eyes lit up.

'That copper basin... There's news from Minghui!'

He immediately took a step, his form floating gracefully until he appeared in a pavilion on the island. He saw two Daoist Masters, one in white and one in gray, playing a game of chess.

The person sitting across from Liu Changdie had a face as pale as paper, with pitch-black eyes. Though he seemed animated, there was clearly something strange about him. Li Ximing, with his hands behind his back, made a light pinching motion. His Life Divine Ability instantly sensed it.

'It's a Dharma Body... no weaker than my Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, just specialized in a different direction.'

He lifted his sleeves and smiled.

"And this is...?"

The person before him had already risen lightly to his feet.

"This lowly one is Cang Tiaozi, a cultivator from the World's Navel. Greetings, Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing bowed, and the ethereal man immediately explained,

"My Dao involves internally cultivating the five forms, with my life-mandate taking on the Valley aspect. I do not show my true body to others and walk using an air-sac. I ask for your understanding, Daoist Friend!"

"It is no matter!"

The Li family had seen a fair number of 'Valley Water' cultivators. The one they were most familiar with was actually Murong Yan from the north. That man had fought Li Zhouwei many times and also walked about wearing a skin-bag, only revealing his true body during combat.

He smiled and nodded, but his mind was more focused on the man's origins.

'He doesn't call himself one of the rogue cultivators, nor does he name a sect. Just one phrase: World's Navel... a place where Valley Water resides...'

But the man before him was direct and decisive.

"There are several Daoist friends in my Dao who are in urgent need of Lesser Yang items. You are likely aware of the history. I have come this time for the Shore-Manifesting White Flower and other Lesser Yang spiritual items in your possession!"

Cang Tiaozi was naturally referring to the matter in the Western Sea. Li Ximing had heard from Daoist Master Yin Qin long ago that the items in Shehu's possession had all ended up with Cang Tiaozi. When he thought about it, he himself had cut off the man's source of wealth. He nodded gravely.

"I only have this one Shore-Manifesting White Flower. However, I also have a Supreme Eaves Radiance. Would you be interested in that, Daoist Friend?"

A slight smile touched Cang Tiaozi's paper-pale face.

"It is actually that level of radiance... Excellent."

He then revealed several spiritual items from his sleeve, all shining brilliantly. Li Ximing swept his gaze over them and found himself in a difficult position. The other party's foundation was clearly deep; he had come prepared. Not only was every item precious, but there was even one Bright Yang spiritual item!

This spiritual item had sharp, distinct edges, its radiance held within. It was a spirit stone, its surface covered in dense, pale-white lines like the veins of a leaf. Resting in a box of black jade, it looked exceptionally tempting.

Cang Tiaozi said pointedly, "This is the Shield of White Sun!"

Li Ximing's heart stirred.

Although he had never obtained this item, he had heard its great name. Several of his own spirit embryos had been refined using the spiritual essence derived from it, which had been a reward from the Great Xiukui Monastery.

"'Guardian' implies the duty of 'governing'. A Yang Guardian is born from the act of Bright Yang governing a state and upholding justice. Unlike the Radiant Sky Stone, which is born of heaven and earth, this item was only born during the Wei period, appearing before the tombs of kings, princes, and high ministers."

Li Ximing listened for a moment. He was slightly tempted, but his hesitation was just as strong.

'I've collected quite a few Bright Yang items over the years. Zhouwei's weapon and armor are both taken care of. I don't really have a use for this... It's not as practical as Li Fire or Whole Pill.'

Seeing his silence, Cang Tiaozi straightened his posture, glanced at Liu Changdie, and smiled.

"I see, Daoist Friend... that you have cultivated an external body."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow with great interest.

"You have sharp eyes, Daoist Friend."

Cang Tiaozi smiled faintly and said quietly, "The external body arts of this world belong to many Dao Lineages. Some originate from divine abilities, others from spell arts. Whether it's the Divided Aspect of the Supreme Yin or the Form in Transition of Cultivation Transcendence, although they are numerous and chaotic, they all fall into one of three categories."

"First is the great Dao of divine ability. Second is to hide from disaster and avert calamity. And third... is to smear mud and sculpt statues. The first two, in particular, require spiritual resources as vast as the sea, and most cannot bypass my Dao of Valley Water..."

A trace of confidence appeared on his pale face.

"I flatter myself to have some small ability in this area. I can ask around on your behalf."

Li Ximing truly hadn't expected to be persuaded from this angle. He fell silent for a moment, his heart secretly moved.

'The three categories Cang Tiaozi mentioned are, in fact, the upper, middle, and lower paths described in the Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body...'

His Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body had a low starting point, created solely for the purpose of taking on injuries. After years of nourishment, its progress had been painfully slow. He had been forced to halt his research into this spell art long ago...

'This is a perfect chance to let him take a look... to see if he can recognize the roots of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.'

He raised an eyebrow and smiled. His Life Divine Ability circulated as he pinched off a wisp of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body's aura.

"My methods are unorthodox and naturally can't compare to your profound origins, Daoist Friend. Perhaps you could examine it for me?"

Cang Tiaozi took it casually. His bright red lips parted, revealing a completely empty void within. He placed the aura in his "mouth" to taste it.

"Daoist Friend... this is a method of the Encompassing Profoundity."

He said gravely, "Regarding external body arts, all Three Profoundities have their own legacies, but they are most prevalent in the Encompassing Profoundity and the Azure Profoundity. They are numerous and intertwined, yet fundamentally different."

"The Azure Profoundity is ethereal. They use 'Form and Shadow' and Divided Aspects, aiming for the Quest for Gold. That external body is cultivated step by step, a method to seek immortality and advance further!"

"The Encompassing Profoundity governs the heavens. They 'Refine Gold to Cultivate the Dao', completely forgetting the self. Once this external body is perfected, they must transfer their life-mandate into it, shedding their mortal coil!"

"As for Comprehending Profoundity..." The man paused, a hint of taboo in his expression, before continuing hurriedly.

"Comprehending Profoundity values the original body and life-mandate above all else. They would rather discard their Dao-fruit and refuse reincarnation than practice external body arts... The few methods they do possess are exceptionally mysterious."

He emphasized, "Of course, regardless of which of the Three Profoundities, these are all what we would call the first-class great Dao of divine ability."

Li Ximing nodded silently. The description of the Encompassing Profoundity's 'Refining Gold to Cultivate the Dao, completely forgetting the self' was exactly as the marvelous scroll had described!

'This 'refining'... means seizing the essence from the original body. And 'forgetting the self' means... forgetting the _former_ self, which is transferred into the new Dharma Body.'

As Li Ximing was lost in thought, Cang Tiaozi continued,

"As for the second-rate methods of 'hiding from disaster' and 'smearing mud statues', their applications are widespread. Many have been scattered among the various daoist traditions. The Majestic Jeweled Visage that the Buddhist cultivators have erected all over the north is, in essence, one such application. That is why they shatter the instant the main body dies."

"Some who specialize in these have formed their own dao lineages, and their methods are not to be underestimated. In your Jiangnan, there is a Daoist Master Yuanxiu. The 'Yellow Dao Profound Talisman' in his hands is one such branch, and it possesses considerable power for averting disaster..."

"As for your own method, Daoist Friend, it can preserve the life-mandate and separate you from calamities. Although it is not fully developed, I can see that its roots are exceptionally profound."

Li Ximing sighed inwardly. He knew full well which category his own art fell into. He smiled.

"It is merely 'smearing mud statues'."

The man paused, then replied, "Within my World's Navel, there is a certain spring. It occasionally produces an essence that can 'dot the eyes' of such creations. It is often borrowed by Daoist friends from traditions 'Beyond the Profound'. If you were to take some back, Daoist Friend, and use it with other top-tier spiritual items to refine your external body, I guarantee a qualitative change!"

Li Ximing was genuinely tempted, but he knew the other party absolutely needed the items he held. He remained impassive. Hearing that he would _still_ need to find other top-tier spiritual items, he put on a troubled expression.

"I am not proficient in this Dao. I fear it will be like drawing water with a bamboo basket—all for nothing."

Cang Tiaozi finally frowned, his expression turning difficult. He sighed.

"If you are willing to give me the Shore-Manifesting White Flower as well, Daoist Friend, I will add a secret method from my sect. It can nourish and transform that spring water, allowing it to protect your external body at a critical moment... I only ask that you do not leak this method to others."

At this, even Liu Changdie looked tempted. Li Ximing, however, became more alert. He raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"You trust me that much, Daoist Friend!"

Cang Tiaozi merely shook his sleeve, offering a pale smile. His two ink-black eyes stared at Li Ximing.

"Not at all... My Dao was transmitted by the Lady. Over the years, it has been lent out for study many times... I have yet to hear of anyone who dared to teach it recklessly."

Li Ximing's heart settled, and he nodded lightly. Cang Tiaozi also visibly relaxed, a look of profound joy on his face. He produced a jade slip and began to copy the method into it, speaking as he worked,

"You may read this secret method, Daoist Friend. As for the treasure, without a special Water Mansion Spiritual Artifact to preserve it, it will dissipate the moment it leaves the grasp of a divine ability... I will return now and have someone deliver it to Ting Province."

With that, he stood up and immediately took his leave. Li Ximing pondered for a long time before raising his head.

"Senior Liu... do you know of these 'Beyond the Profound' Daoist traditions he mentioned?"

Liu Changdie also seemed to be thinking, his brow deeply furrowed.

'The One-Qi White Globe Stone he worked so hard to trade for is also a Lesser Yang item. How interesting... I wonder what he plans to refine...'

He was deep in thought when Li Ximing's question startled him. He smiled.

"That's simple enough. They are Daoist traditions that do not fall within the Three Profoundities... The most ancient and famous is 'Penglai'. At the True Monarch level, there is also the Northern Dark Mansion. A step below that, you have the Southern Songzhou Luoshe..."

Li Ximing raised his eyebrows, surprised to hear the name of the North Star Lady's residence. Liu Changdie saw his reaction and said,

"Regarding the Sundering of the Lesser Yang, Xiyan considers itself the orthodoxy of Comprehending Profoundity, and the Dragon Monarch considers himself to be of the Azure Profoundity. Only this Lady has never declared her position..."

Li Ximing's thoughts deepened, and he nodded silently. Liu Changdie then, as expected, brought up the matter of Xiang Chun and Shanbai coming for the pill, a bitter smile on his face. Li Ximing simply said,

"It's not that I won't help them. But unless they can produce a treasure capable of extending the life-mandate of a Qi Refining cultivator, they absolutely will not be getting this pill from me!"

Liu Changdie nodded in firm agreement. He took a small scroll from his robes.

"News from Yinzhou Island."

Li Ximing glanced at it. It was indeed from that monk, Minghui. The meeting date, however, was set for two months from now. So much for his 'urgency'.

Seeing this, Li Ximing's heart settled. He casually wiped the message with his divine ability, set a new date, and had it sent back. Liu Changdie nodded silently.

"It's inconvenient, with your pill refinement..."

Li Ximing felt a pang of embarrassment. What pill refinement? The precious pill was already on the right track; he just needed to leave his divine ability here to nourish it...

'I'll just... I'll just have to make that monk wait. His Dharma Body was destroyed anyway. He's bored stiff and has nothing but time...'

His expression unchanging, he politely took his leave. He made his way to the heart of the great formation, faced the faintly pulsing light of the array, and took out the jade slip. Closing his eyes, he began to study it intently.




# Chapter 1135: Returning Home

White light shimmered within the immortal cave, suffused with a lingering, clear qi.

On the jade platform sat a youth, his long hair undone. An azure mark had surfaced between his pristine white brows. He exhaled slowly, and as if emerging from another lifetime, he opened his eyes. He stared at the swirling clear qi before him, remaining silent for a long time.

The azure sword rested on his lap.

Li Jiangchun had been in seclusion for a very long time, and his senses were still hazy.

The moment he grasped that azure sword, it felt as though he had fallen into a fable. He experienced countless eons, studied innumerable ancient texts, and attained a sudden, profound enlightenment. He had gained this sword, yet the experience left him feeling displaced, as if an entire age had passed.

He slowly raised his hand. As his palm lay flat, a speck of azure light appeared.

This azure speck was like a darting fish, like a wisp of clear breeze. It circled and leaped, pulsing in his palm, shimmering like moonlight that threatened to dissipate at any moment.

'Sword Intent...'

This intent was precisely what he had comprehended from that single sword—it was called [Azure Homeland]!

'My cultivation base didn't progress much... but this was worth it, no matter what...'

He, Li Jiangchun, had spent the better half of his life immersed in the sword. Sword Intent was the highest Dao-fruit a sword cultivator could seek in their lifetime. He had naturally yearned for it, yet now that he had manifested it overnight, he felt none of the joy he had imagined.

'This sword may have originated from Moon Palace, and I may have adapted it to my own temperament, but its attainment was not my own achievement.'

He was a genius in the Way of the Sword and had cultivated his Sword Origin for many years; he had only been a single step away from Sword Intent. This sword had helped him take that final step, yet it left him feeling hollow. The Way of the Sword was a personal path. Relying on an external force made it fundamentally different.

'It's still unstable, but I've achieved it. Still... this Sword Intent... it's ultimately different from my true, original path.'

If his lifetime of cultivation in the Way of the Sword was a spiritual root, then this new Sword Intent was its fruit. But it was a fruit rooted in the countless experiences that had flooded his mind when he grasped the sword, not from his own growth. Though the root had borne fruit, Li Jiangchun felt a lingering sense of dissatisfaction...

He remained silent for a long time before turning his hand and dispersing the [Azure Homeland Sword Intent]. He closed his eyes, and after a moment, his pale palm once again rippled with a faint white light. It drifted back and forth, gradually condensing.

This white light was quite different from the azure. It was as ethereal as moonlight, yet it shifted to form a small bird, flying and soaring. It seemed faint and unstable, on the verge of being assimilated and scattering completely.

This was the [Crescent Moon Sword Origin] he had cultivated for so many years!

The youth stared at the Sword Origin in his hand, and a vague, new idea formed in his mind:

'They seem like different fruits from the same branch... If I continue to pursue this path... could it be possible... to manifest [Crescent Moon] into its own Sword Intent?!'

...

Moongaze Lake.

A heavy snow had just begun to fall. A resplendent carriage streaked across the pure white sky, its long banners fluttering and its profound light casting reflections below. It landed swiftly by the shore, startling a flock of sparrows into flight.

A purple curtain swayed, and a handsome, scholarly man adjusted his silver-white crown before stepping down onto the snow. His black and white spiritual boots made soft crunching sounds as they met the fresh powder.

Li Jiangliang raised his brows, his expression complex and filled with emotion.

'Moongaze Lake... It's been so many years...'

He helped his wife down from the carriage and saw a person waiting for them in the snow. The man was dressed in red robes, adorned with gold and silver, and had a fan hanging from his waist. His face was bright and welcoming. He held the hand of a woman behind him, whose willow-like brows were slightly lowered, giving her a gentle and pleasant appearance.

Li Jiangliang quickly bowed.

"Junior greets Fifth Uncle... and Aunt! We have troubled you to come out..."

"Eh..."

Li Zhouming laughed heartily and casually pulled him closer.

"You've made quite a name for yourself out there. These days, you're the Emissary of the True Light Cloud and the Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace. How could you not deserve the welcome? This... this must be the Eldest Princess?"

At his words, Yang Tianyou, who was standing behind, quickly bowed as well and offered some pleasantries. Li Jiangliang, however, just smiled mysteriously. He turned slightly and gestured for Li Zhouming to look.

"Uncle, please look!"

In the carriage behind them, the colors within were dark. The curtain was lifted, revealing a middle-aged man dressed in black.

Li Zhouming looked, and he froze.

The man had long brows and sharp, narrow eyes. His profile was strong and capable, marked by a few faint scars. He had wide shoulders and a thick chest. His wrists and ankles were bound tightly with black cloth strips, like one of the rogue cultivators from the martial world, giving him an air of keen competence.

He placed one foot in the snow, bracing the other against the carriage, and stamped the snow from his boot. As he stepped down calmly, Li Zhouming finally noticed the gold and white bow slung across his back.

He saw a familiar shadow in this man. That aura of restrained danger, that calm and unhurried demeanor... it was somewhat reminiscent of his own King Wei.

'It's just that Elder Brother is steady and heavy; his danger is hidden within his heart. This man's eyes are grim and sharp, yet full of spirit. He inspires awe at first glance.'

Li Jiangliang smiled but didn't make an introduction. Instead, he turned to the man.

"My lord..."

The man in black raised his brows and stepped forward.

"Lord Duke, you are too kind."

Before Li Zhouming could speak, the man looked his way.

"And this is..."

Li Jiangliang smiled.

"This is my Fifth Uncle, the Daoist Master's grandson!"

Even having never met him, how could Li Zhouming not understand who this man was? The scrutiny on his face instantly melted into delighted surprise. He beamed.

"So, it is you, my lord, who has returned! This is wonderful... wonderful! The Old Master's wish can finally be fulfilled!"

The middle-aged man in black was, of course, Li Yuanqin!

Faced with this elder who had been gone for so many years, Li Zhouming's own feelings of sorrow and joy were not profound. His first thought was of Li Xuanxuan, and for that, he was overjoyed. A look of urgency crossed his face.

"Excellent... truly excellent! Come, everyone, follow me!"

Thus, they rode the clouds and mist, treading on light and fire, and flew hurriedly toward the mountain peak rising from the lake. They passed through layer upon layer of palaces until a great hall, shimmering with golden light and overlapping pavilions, came into view.

Li Zhouming, however, stopped. He lowered his gaze and said,

"The Old Master is getting on in years, and his health hasn't been good. He has been taking medicine these past few days, so he must not be disturbed by too much noise. Shouyu, why don't you take our two guests to request an audience with King Wei first? I will lead our lord to pay respects to the Old Ancestor."

Hearing this, Li Jiangliang's expression turned grave. He pinched his fingers as if calculating, then sighed.

"Of course... How insensible of me. When I return this time, I must make a point to find some spiritual items for him."

Xia Shouyu always knew how to give her husband face in front of others. She nodded with gentle obedience and led the other two away. Li Zhouming then led Li Yuanqin up the steps.

As they walked, Li Yuanqin said, "My adopted son is still behind, leading the convoy with the court's rewards for King Wei. We should have someone fetch him, so he can also pay his respects to the Old Master."

"Yes..."

The two stepped into the great hall. The old man was already waiting in the courtyard.

Since returning from the Eastern Sea, Li Xuanxuan felt his spirit and body were much improved. That vital energy had been renewed, and he had once again thrown himself into managing the family's affairs, catching up on all the news he had missed and seeing all the people he couldn't during his illness.

When he heard Li Jiangliang was returning to the lake, Li Xuanxuan, who was already deeply concerned about matters in the imperial capital, was naturally eager to see him. He paced anxiously, and the moment he saw movement, he strode down from the main seat. He never expected that when the golden doors opened, the one who entered would not be Li Jiangliang.

The man had a middle-aged appearance, dressed in practical black. His expression was steady, but his eyes held a fierce light. The bow on his back, glinting gold and white, was exceptionally striking.

Li Yuanqin remembered Li Xuanxuan. When he had returned to the lake with his mother all those years ago, everyone had been kind, but there was an unavoidable sense of distance. Only this uncle had held him and wept, mourning his father's death, his pain all-consuming...

Therefore, in this clan where so much had changed, Li Yuanqin respected and loved him most. The look he gave him now was warm, tinged with a smile.

But as he looked back, the old man sucked in a sharp breath. His heart seized, and he was momentarily speechless.

'Xuanfeng...'

But the voice that echoed in the hall was one of respect.

"Nephew greets Uncle!"

That single sentence sent hot tears streaming down the old man's face. He instantly realized the difference between this man and his second younger brother. Li Xuanfeng's fierceness had been that of an old sword stained with blood, a weapon that had taken lives. His steadiness came from having weathered every storm, merely waiting for death, a sharp light shining from within the gore. No matter how much this man resembled him, he ultimately lacked that killing aura.

He helped Li Yuanqin up, his voice thick with tears.

"I finally get to see you... How is your mother? And your... your wife..."

Li Yuanqin lowered his gaze, his voice strained.

"Mother has been living in seclusion in recent years and is unwilling to travel. She only wished for me to send her greetings... As for my wife, she perished during a breakthrough."

Li Xuanxuan was startled from his reverie. He led Li Yuanqin to a seat, but Li Yuanqin would not sit while bearing his late father's relic. He carefully took [White Lightning] from his back, held it level with both hands, and presented it to Li Xuanxuan.

The old man said nothing for a long time. He clutched the dharma artifact, weeping and murmuring to himself, before reverently placing it on the main seat. He sat to the side, taking a moment to collect his emotions before looking at Li Yuanqin. He asked several times about his recent situation, then hesitated for a moment before raising his brows.

"I've mentioned it many times... This branch of the family is thin, with only your father's line. I've worried about it year after year, so much that it's become a sickness in my heart... It wasn't proper for me to press the issue, but I often sent letters to the Southern Borderlands..."

"I never imagined your father's talent would be so good, and yours is no less. Your father, and you... both could be called the best of your generation, your cultivation advancing faster than anyone... You never had the chance to establish more branches... It's good that you are finally willing to see the line continued."

Li Yuanqin nodded silently.

"I have troubled Elder with worry."

The most important reason for Li Yuanqin's return to the clan was to adopt an heir. Hearing his words, Li Xuanxuan sighed.

"There is no rush. Since you have returned, you should get to know the various branches, meet the juniors, and let them get to know you... You must choose someone you know well, and someone you like."

Li Yuanqin could only nod. Just then, the hall doors opened, and a man entered. He was tall and carried himself with a heroic air. He approached and bowed.

"Greetings, Father, and Lord!"

Only then did Li Yuanqin speak formally.

"The Ning clan also places great importance on the matter of inheritance. The Daoist Master personally selected this child for me. He is now named Li Fuchao. I brought him here for you to see, my lord."

Li Xuanxuan studied the young man for a few moments, had him speak, and asked several questions. Li Yuanqin then said in a low voice,

"He is from Ning Heyuan's line. That man once visited the lake and was always on good terms with Father. Elder Sister Li Qinghong should also know of him."

Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan finally relaxed. They left the hall together and went to the ancestral hall.

The hall was deathly quiet, with incense smoke curling past shining golden characters. Li Xuanxuan personally cleaned this place most of the time. There were six rows of tablets, arranged by height, shrouded behind deep curtains.

Li Yuanqin followed the old man in kowtowing. He looked closely at the spirit tablets. His father's was in the fourth row, standing clearly in the center, bearing the characters he himself had written all those years ago. The space to its left was empty, presumably reserved by the old man for himself.

He glanced down. In the fifth row, he could see the tablet for Li Yuanping, the father of Daoist Master Zhaojing. But with just that one glance, a sliver of doubt rose in his heart.

'The space beneath Father's tablet is a bit wide...'

He remained silent. Li Xuanxuan had someone bring a vermilion brush and the clan register, which was covered by a red cloth. The old man seemed to hesitate and did not uncover it. Instead, he led Li Fuchao forward and said with great solemnity,

"Since the Li clan was consolidated by Li Jingtian, you are the only person to have been granted this surname. I hope you will guard your temperament, hold to the righteous path, and never bring defilement to our house... Come. Kowtow!"

The man kneeling below, his face flushed with emotion, prostrated himself fully on the ground.

"This junior will absolutely not disappoint you, my lord!"

...

The heavenly light was brilliant.

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain, white petals drifted through the air. Li Zhouwei sat quietly on the main seat, gazing at the two people bowing on the floor before him. A slight smile touched his lips.

"Rise. There is no need for such formality."

Only then did Li Jiangliang raise his head and rise respectfully. Yang Tianyou also lifted her head, moved to the table, and with a slender hand, picked up the jade pot. She filled a cup, held it reverently, and raised it past her brows.

"On our wedding day, we were unable to invite Father. This junior was deeply unsettled, and my husband also reprimanded me, saying that with Father-in-law not present, how could the marriage be proper? We make up for it today... Please, Father, accept this tea."

Li Zhouwei did not make things difficult for her. He casually accepted the cup, completing the simple rite, and took a small sip.

"I was in seclusion at the time, preoccupied with many things. It was an unfortunate delay."

He tilted his chin, his golden eyes calm, and looked at Li Jiangliang.

"Among all the brothers, Jiangliang is the one who most follows the rules and knows right from wrong. His heart is more upright than his older brothers. I only worried he might suffer for it in the south."

Yang Tianyou bowed respectfully.

"Father, rest assured. The Emperor places great trust in my husband, viewing him as an indispensable minister..."

She raised her brows and smiled, a deeper meaning in her eyes.

"My lord handles all matters perfectly. When I saw the Old Ancestor, he also mentioned the great defeat of the Buddhists, saying it was extremely mighty."

Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal and did not reply to her. Li Jiangliang lowered his gaze and said, "You'er, the Old Master's residence should be prepared by now. Why don't you go see him first? I will be along shortly."

Yang Tianyou's expression settled, and she nodded, withdrawing silently. The mountain peak grew quiet. Li Jiangliang remained motionless for a long time. Li Zhouwei gave a rare smile.

"Well? What matter could be so important as to bring you personally to the lake?"

Li Jiangliang, standing one step below him and to the side, bowed solemnly.

"Your son has an urgent matter to report!"

At these words, Li Zhouwei's expression also sobered. He listened as Li Jiangliang spoke, his face complex.

"Father, your victory in the Western Sea has greatly enhanced your reputation, but that spiritual object was not simple... I have heard fragments and whispers, which led to some speculations. I came urgently to report them."

Li Zhouwei already had his own suspicions. He frowned.

"Is this about the Lesser Yang matter?"

Li Jiangliang nodded grimly.

"The item that the demon beast acquired was passed down from a cultivator of the Comprehending Profoundity orthodoxy. Their Dao Lineage is called the [Xiyang Temple]..."

"The founder of this [Xiyang Temple] was originally a cultivator at the Lesser Yang Auxiliary Position. He was a disciple of Comprehending Profoundity's first disciple, the very first master of Lesser Yang, and is thus revered as their founder. The [Xiyang Temple]'s Dao Lineage in the mortal world is the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect!"

Li Zhouwei had, in fact, anticipated this. He remained impassive.

"I will ask you only one thing: Is Yin Qin one of Comprehending Profoundity's people?"

Li Jiangliang was stunned for a second before lowering his gaze.

"Father is sharp. While there are no great figures backing him, if you trace his origins, he does indeed belong to their mortal Dao Lineage."

Li Zhouwei's expression grew heavy. He listened as Li Jiangliang continued quickly,

"That Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant was a gift from the Emperor of Liang. It is an object of Lesser Yang consummation. While nothing seemed amiss at the time, after the fall of Lesser Yang, many of the great lords began to suspect... that this item... is connected to a contingency plan left by the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch."

"A contingency plan?"

Li Zhouwei was noncommittal. The item had shown no reaction under the Immortal Mirror's probe, so it surely couldn't be a major contingency... If he had to name a contingency, he would sooner think of something far more suspicious.

'That demonic evil that possessed Fuxun... that was very likely a method of Xiyang, attempting to escape confinement...'

He frowned.

"If it's a contingency plan, then what is Comprehending Profoundity playing at? Do they wish ill upon their own True Monarch?"

A look of dread appeared on Li Jiangliang's face. He organized his thoughts before speaking in a low voice.

"The Lesser Yang Demon Monarch Kuaili of Great Liang was originally a cultivator from the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect. But he obtained a demonic inheritance and plotted for a long time. He took advantage of the moment the Lesser Yang Immortal Lord of that era ascended to the [Purple Pavilion Palace] and departed, leaving the Fruition Attainment vacant. In a single stroke, he bypassed the [Xiyang Temple] and seized the Fruition Attainment for himself."

"At the time, the entire [Xiyang Temple] was shocked and furious, utterly disbelieving. But while His origins were low, He was still considered a Comprehending Profoundity cultivator. Furthermore, the Dao of Enduring Malice had also been established by a Comprehending Profoundity cultivator. Since He had already taken the Fruition Attainment, they had no choice but to hold their noses and acknowledge Him."

"Afterward, this Demon Monarch repeatedly profited from several great upheavals, and His cultivation advanced immensely... He once suppressed all other cultivators, and the Comprehending Profoundity cultivators naturally began to change their attitude, eventually holding Him up as their poster child."

He finished with a strained voice, "It's just... I heard them say that His relationship with the other great lords... was not good."

"This matter is technically concluded, but your son's heart remains uneasy. I was afraid that our family, upon seeing the Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant, might have other plans for it... and end up getting entangled in this..."

His words were already extremely tactful. Li Zhouwei was silent for a moment, not answering immediately. Instead, he seized on another point of doubt.

"If that's the case, why did Comprehending Profoundity clean up the demon beast's mess back then? They could have just gone with the flow and allowed the spiritual object to be destroyed naturally. Why go back and forth like this? Isn't that just causing trouble for themselves?"

Li Jiangliang had clearly not considered this question before he arrived. He thought hard for a moment, then said haltingly,

"The inner workings of the Comprehending Profoundity path... I do not know the fine details. In ancient times, if two True Monarchs ever emerged from the same Dao-path, it would immediately split. Even a single Dao Lineage can have internal conflicts, to say nothing of the countless figures operating under the Comprehending Profoundity banner..."

"Moreover, Comprehending Profoundity has always followed the principle that those on the mountain do not meddle in mortal affairs. If we are to be strict about it, Daoist Qu's involvement was already against their own rules..."

Li Zhouwei, however, did not let his guard down. His thoughts ran deep.

'From start to finish, Yin Qin was verbally trying to persuade me not to destroy the plant. He seemed to be in great distress. Yet, just as he was leaving, he decisively destroyed that precious land himself...'

If not destroying the plant didn't align with his true interests, then his actions must have served some other purpose.

'Saving face. Fulfilling an obligation.'

His mind cleared, and he began to form a hypothesis.

'If Jiangliang is correct, and if the Great Liang founded by Kuaili truly doesn't align with Comprehending Profoundity's ideals... it means there is genuine conflict. In that case, even though they are all part of Comprehending Profoundity, the lords in the heavens might not want to see Lesser Yang return.'

'But right at this moment... a suspected Lesser Yang contingency appears. They would certainly want it eliminated.'

So where was the difficulty?

Judging from Daoist Qu's actions, the [Xiyang Temple] had, by the end, clearly sided with the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch. A Demon Monarch who had cultivated for so many years would surely control his own Dao Lineage. His followers had to look to Kuaili's whims to cultivate; those who remained must have been his staunchest supporters.

It was hard to say if these supporters had a True Monarch backing them, but most were likely still at Mount Luoxia. And even without them, Kuaili was still a Demon Monarch officially recognized by Comprehending Profoundity, from within their own tradition. The lords above could not afford to be so brazen in their actions.

'So, they needed someone else to cut down this tree for them. And this person had to be someone involved in "mortal affairs," someone they couldn't easily stop. It's even possible Yin Qin's orders were to protect this plant at all costs. But he knew the true intentions of his superiors, leaving him trapped for years, damned if he acted and damned if he didn't...'

'That's it. That's why Yin Qin looked so reluctant... when in reality, he was overjoyed. He could go back and report: [King Wei insisted on destroying the tree!]'

But was that all?

Li Zhouwei's thoughts quickly circled back to his own position.

'And the message from Suining was to eliminate this spiritual root... he mentioned that specifically. This wasn't a case of them passively borrowing my hand. I suspect I was the one actively taking a stance!'

'A stance declaring that the powers behind me, Li Zhouwei, are also unwilling to see the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch return.'

With that, it all clicked into place.

'It's because I represent the remnant power of the Immortal Mansion line. The one backing me, placing their bets, is the person behind Qingyu Qian!'

'The Lesser Yang Demon Monarch fell at the hands of Lord Yingze. But Lord Yingze has been missing for many years, quite possibly having gone beyond the heavens. Even though the remaining Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is fractured and its factions fight among themselves, they would never want to see the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch make a comeback!'

The gold in his eyes turned dark and heavy.

'So that's how it is. If I cut down the plant, no one bats an eye. But if I don't cut it down... the implications become very complicated.'

He raised his brows and smiled.

"Are they afraid I'll side with Comprehending Profoundity?"

Li Jiangliang immediately stepped away from his spot and bowed low, his head down in silent admission.

He was right.

Comprehending Profoundity disliked the idea of Kuaili returning to meddle in the mortal world. But how could the Underworld not be on guard? The Demon Monarch's power was immense. If Comprehending Profoundity was playing a double game—saying one thing publicly while secretly preparing for the revival of Lesser Yang—the balance of power between the two great forces could be shattered!

'When Yang Tianyou arrived, she called me "Father" in every sentence, except for that last one, "My lord handles all matters perfectly". And she just had to mention Yang Tianya. Was that "my lord"... truly referring to me?'

'If "my lord" referred to the power behind me, it means the Underworld was also extremely satisfied with my destruction of the spiritual root... And yet, someone among Them still suspects that I, Li Zhouwei, am secretly colluding with Luoxia!'

Kuaili was a figure Comprehending Profoundity disliked, but one the Underworld was actively vigilant against.

'In truth, if that day really comes, the Underworld is not unprepared... Why else would they cede the vast lands of Jiangnan entirely to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition? Could it be a tacit agreement? The moment Comprehending Profoundity tries to use Kuaili, the four lords—Taiyi, Taiyue, Taiqing, and Taizhu—will immediately side with the Underworld.'

'And yet, the Underworld still dreads His return. Is it because their traditions are different? Or because it would invite new chaos? Or perhaps...'

Another, more terrifying answer surfaced in his mind.

'They believe that the four True Monarchs of Chongming Hall—four Azure Profoundity Golden Core masters wielding Dharma Treasures—even if they joined forces... still could not stop the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch who was dismembered a thousand years ago: Kuaili!'




# Chapter 1136: Lingering Attachments

On the mountaintop, iridescent light swirled as the Heavenly Light scattered down, drifting among white flowers. Li Jiangliang kept his head bowed, kneeling silently on the ground.

Honestly, Li Jiangliang had been reluctant to say any of this. Although Yang Tianyou was fraught with worry, Li Jiangliang didn't believe his father would truly interfere in the Lesser Yang's affairs. But after he and his wife discussed it at length, he had finally relented.

He had weighed the situation for a long time before secretly steeling his resolve.

'Regardless of the Yang family's attitude, or whether this matter is considered large or small, or what the various factions are debating... all I can do is ensure Ting Province is fully aware of what's happening with the Lesser Yang.'

So, he had used these orders as an opportunity to come and report everything he knew. Hearing his father's question, he looked up.

"I personally believe... the great figures are not worried. But Tianyou and the Great General can't help but overthink things."

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei understood that his son had a deep understanding of the Underworld but knew little about Ting Province. His perspective was skewed.

'Since I am backed by the Immortal Mansion, it's true those high-level figures have no need to worry. But Yang Ruiyi himself has absolutely no real power, let alone Yang Tianyou. She only came here as someone's puppet, to deliver a single message.'

'That line about the "lord handling things appropriately" was really just acknowledging that the Immortal Mansion knew its place. The Yang family reaped some benefit, or perhaps just found their own operations running more smoothly, so they sent someone to offer a token word of praise.'

He sneered inwardly but merely nodded, raising his cup.

"Return and tell them I'm engaged in fierce battles in Jiangbei, relying heavily on their divine might."

Li Jiangliang was taken aback. A flicker of worry crossed his brow, but he didn't press the matter.

"I will remember."

Once the tea was finished, their official business was concluded. Li Jiangliang returned to his seat. Li Zhouwei watched him, his expression softening slightly.

"You have no sons. Have you made any arrangements for the future?"

Li Jiangliang fell silent, his gaze dropping, obscuring the look in his eyes. After a moment, he looked up.

"Father, I appreciate your concern. But Tianyou and I share a deep bond, and I have no intention of taking a concubine. As for adopting an heir..."

He paused, his expression turning serious.

"My brothers do not have many children themselves. As for the other branches, they do not possess the 'golden eyes,' so there is no need to transfer them out of the main line. The Zhou royal house had many successions, and the Chu ancestral line was moved several times. We need not be so fastidious about purity."

These were not pleasant words, but he spoke them naturally, his gaze lowered. Li Zhouwei stared at him before setting down his cup.

"All of you born with the golden eyes are intelligent, and full of your own calculations. I have never interfered in your affairs. You are not like your three older brothers. If you achieve greatness, I doubt the Yang clan would be stingy with a position for you."

Li Jiangliang's expression grew complicated at this. He bowed his head.

"Father, you worry too much... My brothers..."

But Li Zhouwei rose to his feet.

"Since you've come to the lake, I doubt this was your only purpose."

Li Jiangliang nodded quickly, also rising.

"The Emperor has bestowed spiritual goods, a train of carts stretching for miles. They are a reward for Ting Province. Also..."

He lowered his head again.

"The Cheng clan of the Sword Gate has submitted a report. They say that after many years, the Myriad Radiance Sword Tome has revealed a name again. It displayed 'Jiangchun.' News of this will soon spread everywhere. The Emperor has ordered me to summon Jiangchun to the capital."

Li Zhouwei's tone was unreadable.

"This King knew this couldn't be avoided, but I didn't expect them to use this method. Clever, indeed."

Li Jiangliang didn't dare breathe, merely pouring more tea for his father.

"Uncle Zhouluo... also misses him terribly."

But his father seemed uninterested and waved his hand dismissively.

"Go see the Old Master."

Li Jiangliang gave a deep bow and retreated, facing his father as he went. When he reached the courtyard and was about to head down the mountain, the man above him raised his golden eyes. The color within them had grown heavy and somber.

"You and Zhouluo watch over him for me. If anything happens in the Imperial Capital, I will be going to Yang Zhuo to demand his return."

"Yes..."

The young man departed with hurried steps, never leaving his father's sight. The mountain fell quiet, but only for an instant. Footsteps broke the silence, and a bright figure leaped into view, landing gracefully. A youth with a sword on his back emerged, his bearing carefree and his face wreathed in a smile. He bowed.

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

"Jiangchun. You've come out of seclusion."

Li Zhouwei sighed inwardly but nodded with a smile. Li Jiangchun had already risen to his feet.

"It is only because you are here guarding Ting Province, Uncle, that this junior could cultivate in peace."

Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"Your eldest brother has been in seclusion for a long time. I cannot leave this place for an extended period. The Western Shu have a history of scheming. If they try their old tricks again... although Jiangqian's foundation is stable, such a disturbance would be detrimental. Besides... there may be another period of turmoil in the province soon."

Li Jiangchun nodded silently.

"At this juncture, they probably aren't paying it much mind."

Clearly, Li Jiangchun was referring to the efficacy of the Talisman Seed in coalescing a divine ability. To other families, Li Jiangqian had only been in seclusion for eight or nine years; he couldn't possibly be at the critical juncture yet. But Li Jiangchun himself estimated it would only be another year or two.

Li Zhouwei's thoughts, however, were on a different track. As he pondered, Li Jiangchun spoke again, his tone solemn.

"Junior has another important matter to report!"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. He watched as the young man revealed his palm, where a cyan radiance flared to life, shifting and floating. A sharp aura washed over them.

"What powerful Sword Intent!"

He could clearly sense a severing quality within it. Though faint and small, its quality was exceptionally high, and it seemed aimed directly at one's life-mandate.

But Li Jiangchun hesitated slightly before revealing his other hand. In that palm, another iridescent light appeared, spiraling nimbly as a sparrow.

Crescent Moon Sword Origin!

'Hm?'

Before he could say more, King Wei was on his feet, his gaze burning. He stared at the Sword Intent in one hand and the Sword Origin in the other. After a moment's thought, he asked in a low voice,

"How did you accomplish this?"

Li Jiangchun didn't dare be careless. He explained everything, then respectfully offered the cyan-white sword with both hands, presenting it to Li Zhouwei.

Li Zhouwei stared down at the Qingchi, silent for a long time.

Li Ximing had spoken of this spiritual sword's origins before and had been quite worried. He had even relayed Li Xijun's original words, believing the sword contained an inheritance. This Daoist Master's own thoughts on the matter were:

'To achieve an immortal foundation is to manifest intent; to establish a Dao Lineage for the Way of the Sword... how could that be done by a mere mortal? I fear an ancestor was a celestial being who stooped to reincarnate in the lower realm. When Xijun spoke of Immortal Swords—could this be what he meant?'

This caused Li Zhouwei to sigh deeply. He didn't press further into the origin of the Sword Intent, but said in a low voice,

"Is it really possible... two Sword Intents?"

Seeing Li Jiangchun's hesitant nod, an image of a particular figure flashed into the golden-eyed man's mind.

'True Monarch Shangyuan!'

When that True Monarch was still only at the Purple Mansion Realm, his fame for wielding two Sword Intents resounded throughout Jiangnan! Any discussion of dual Sword Intents inevitably led back to him.

Once a person manifests Sword Intent, it is unique to them; it cannot be duplicated. Even Wang Xun, who visited the Li family long ago—a descendant of a great, living True Monarch—had claimed, 'Even my True Monarch has never seen such a thing!'

'Regardless, Jiangchun's anomaly must be related to the heavens. If that's the case, then True Monarch Shangyuan's Sword Intent... where did _it_ come from?'

'If others were to see this... the trouble would be unimaginable...'

Li Zhouwei said in a low voice, "Since Azure Homeland has been revealed, you will use that Sword Intent and its Sword Origin from now on. As for the original one... do not use it. Continue to refine it in secret."

The young man bowed, his expression worried.

"I just fear the Myriad Radiance Sword Tome!"

The Myriad Radiance Sword Tome of the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate could respond to Sword Intents from thousands of miles away. How could Li Jiangchun not be worried about it? Li Zhouwei's brow furrowed in thought.

"Logically, with the Talisman Seed in your body, you shouldn't be detectable by such things. Yet, the Tome succeeds time and again. I estimate its senses must rely on the Sword Intent that manifests in the Great Void... and even that must have its limits."

"I will look into this. When the time is right, I will pay a visit to the Sword Gate... and probe this matter of Sword Intent. You just focus on advancing your cultivation."

Li Jiangchun nodded, his expression serious. Li Zhouwei added regretfully,

"It's just that we can no longer brush off the Song Emperor."

Li Jiangchun understood his meaning instantly. Far from worried, he looked delighted.

"I have been looking forward to this for a long time! Our ancestors pacified the Eastern Yue, eliminated the Maha, unified the lake, and slaughtered the hordes of Buddhists. When you were at the Foundation Establishment Realm, Uncle, you took up your halberd and carved out a reputation known on both shores, with none in the Three Sects and Seven Gates daring to stand as your equal. I, too, must test myself against the talents of this world!"

Li Zhouwei laughed.

"That wasn't exactly a good time for choosing rivals. Lord Xiangping had the King-Marquis of the Eastern Yue. Lord Tongya had the Yu father and son. My uncle's great-grandfather had the Eighteen Buddhists. My own talent was shallow; I could only find the likes of Situ Mo and Guan Gongxiao to fight. Still... their methods were not unworthy of the heroes of that era."

His expression was one of pity as he continued,

"But in the Jiangnan of today, there is no one worthy of the name. The Dao Children of the immortal sects and the direct heirs of the Underworld remain in seclusion... I fear even the imperial princes are not fit to be your opponents!"

...

Lotus Temple.

The land was sunk in the dimness of night, mountains rising and falling in shadow. Faint dots of golden light were visible. A colossal Buddhist statue stood amidst the range, looking particularly terrifying against the gray-black sky.

Golden light flickered within the temple. In a pool, a milky-white liquid roiled, looking starkly bright in the faint candlelight. A monk soaked within it, his clean-shaven head resting in the lap of a woman behind him. His expression was heavy, and he remained silent for a long time.

After an unknown time, a young novice approached the platform, his face etched with misery. He knelt before the pool.

"Master... the date has been changed!"

These words made the already agitated monk in the pool sit bolt upright.

"You... you... what have you done! I see it now. Logically, you're heavily injured and haven't recovered, so how could you trust him? And you certainly couldn't run off overseas to meet him... Now you've made him suspicious, haven't you!"

At this, Minghui began to slap his own face in remorse.

"This... this was my oversight, Master, but I didn't order this... It's difficult for us to send messages overseas, so I entrusted someone from Yinzhou Island. The plan was, as soon as there was news, he would crush a jade talisman, and I would arrive a month later. I... I forgot to give specific instructions, and I never imagined he would set the meeting directly..."

Hearing this, Jinlian's expression softened slightly. He sighed.

"I expect... he's almost certainly asking you about the 'Great Emptiness Dao-Seeking Disk.' That thing is worthless to us, but to the Way of Emptiness, it's priceless. This complicates things."

He lowered his gaze.

"I see... Just have your disciple-brother go in your place!"

Minghui was instantly alarmed.

"Is that... appropriate?"

Jinlian gritted his teeth.

"What's not appropriate about it! Do you dare to speak forcefully to Li Ximing? Even I hardly dare! The last time you met King Wei, he sensed something was wrong. You dare go again? Are you treating him like a fool?"

"It just so happens... your disciple-brother Mingmeng was a Daoist in his past life. He and Mingxiang are blood brothers. After that last incident, your disciple-brother Mingxiang is already suspicious. When Mingmeng returns and speaks with him, it will naturally help smooth over Mingxiang's feelings about our recent actions!"

Minghui's eyes lit up. He nodded vigorously, showering his master with flattery.

"Brilliant! Master, you are truly brilliant!"

"Pah!"

Although Jinlian was smiling, he spat.

"Useless!"

Minghui just chuckled in agreement.

He had been taken in by the Lotus Temple as a child. Jinlian was quick to curse and beat him, but was also fiercely protective when it mattered. Knowing his master's temperament, Minghui just pressed on anxiously.

"But this 'Great Emptiness Dao-Seeking Disk'... are we to acquire it... or not?"

Jinlian's expression immediately darkened.

"The Way of Great Desire intends to move south. When they come, the Way of Emptiness is sure to follow. Your disciple-brother is already in Jiangnan; how can we stay out of it? This disk... it's both useless and vital. It's merely a focus for their seeking the Dao. The only question is whether we should allow it to fall back into the hands of the Way of Emptiness."

He said in a dark tone,

"If not for this business with the Way of Great Desire, I would have preferred Zhelu to get it. It would have fed his ambition. But he can't make waves anymore. If it falls into his hands, it's as good as giving it to the enemy."

"If it falls into the hands of the Way of Great Desire, that's even worse. To get it, Zhelu would surely grovel and submit. He'd probably stop all his covert actions... wouldn't that just cause trouble for the 'Lord'?"

He narrowed his eyes, a plan forming quickly.

"Mingmeng!"

This place was already connected to the Buddhist Land. In an instant, light flashed, and a young monk stepped out of the void, dropping to his knees.

"Greetings, Master."

Jinlian nodded slightly, his voice chilling.

"The 'Great Emptiness Dao-Seeking Disk' from the Liang era is in King Wei's hands. Some Northern Buddhists, we don't know which, secretly tempted one of his rogue cultivators with a great reward to trade for it. This matter is of vital interest to the Way of Emptiness. You will go see Zhaojing in your junior brother's place."

Mingmeng raised his eyebrows, his expression serious.

"Does Master wish for me to retrieve it?"

"No."

Jinlian shook his head.

"Acquiring it would not only be enormously expensive, it would drag us into the conflict between the Way of Great Desire and the Way of Emptiness. They would certainly plot against you, pull you into their move south, all to force me to hand over the disk..."

"But once we hand it over, the Way of Emptiness's power will soar, and we will have offended King Wei. Caught between north and south, you would face certain death! It would be a massive effort just to roast ourselves over a fire."

Jinlian explained this, mixing truth with falsehood. Mingmeng's eyes lit up, and he nodded repeatedly, sighing with emotion.

"To be able to cultivate under Master is truly the fortune of this lifetime!"

Jinlian couldn't be bothered with his flattery.

"You are to explain the situation to him frankly. Lay out all the implications and warn him: no matter who comes asking, he must not hand it over. Consider it us doing him a favor. Perhaps King Wei will spare your lives for it."

Mingmeng agreed profusely and departed. Jinlian settled back into the milky pool, pondering his arrangements. Minghui watched with a look of utter admiration.

"Master, you truly are Master! That skill for spinning nonsense... I have so much to learn! To be able to cultivate under Master is truly the fortune of this lifetime!"

Jinlian shot him a look and sighed.

"These days, at the mere mention of King Wei, Mahas like Mingmeng are all desperate to avoid him... It's clear Vast Cicada's death scared them witless!"

At the mention of this, Minghui too fell silent.

"Vast Cicada was someone that Lord clearly wanted to protect... yet he died just like that. It was a slap in His face, plain for all the world to see. Everyone says Qi Lanyan lost his nerve and meekly handed over half of Jiangbei... but they forget how Zhelu and the others hesitated. Every single one of them was terrified!"

Back then, Jinlian had cursed his terrible luck. Now, his tune changed completely, his face filled with relief.

"Thinking on it now, we were the ones who received a great blessing... If not for the Lord's favor, the one dead today would be your disciple-brother! And the ones hiding in this temple, terrified... would be us!"




# Chapter 1137: Savoring the Rain

Minghui laid on the flattery thick, calming his Master down. After coming down from the main hall, he thought it over and over, slapped his head, and with a single step, arrived at the resplendent, shining Buddhist Land.

The full name of the Way of Joyful Bliss Buddhist Land was the [Twelve Realms Great Compassionate Good Dharma Corresponding Land]. It was attested by their own Ancestral Master, the Great Compassionate, Joyful Lotus-World Aspect, who achieved this at the base of Mount Dayang, becoming one of the Seven Aspects.

The ancient Buddhists did not cultivate through reincarnation. When their physical lifespan ended, it was 'Attestation Complete, Returning to Emptiness'. They did not use their Buddhist Lands to accept people, only cultivating and attesting their own bodies. What they attested was the Golden Land, which was also called the [Response Body] at the time. These varied in size, lacking the clearly defined ranks of today.

It was only after Su Xikong and Shijia Li established the Dao lineage for the modern Buddhists that the concept of the Buddhist Land truly came into being. At that time, the Buddhist Land referred to the Chandana Forest, where all the Dharma Masters resided.

Later, as the Seven Aspects expanded, new Buddhist Lands were differentiated. It was no longer appropriate to call them Golden Lands, so they were termed various [Response Lands]. The Chandana Forest, however, was where the true bodies of the Dharma Masters resided, and it was the sole [True Land].

The Great Compassionate, Joyful Lotus-World Aspect was among the very first group of Dharma Masters to transition from the Daoist Tradition to the Buddhist one. Their status was sublime. This Buddhist Land was pure, quiet, and peaceful, floating lightly at the peak of infinity. Gold covered the ground, endless silks abounded, colorful waters rippled, and lotus flowers bloomed. Everyone's face was filled with joy, free from worries about food or drink. They just sat upright, discussing sutra principles with one another, perfectly content.

They had already transcended the many sufferings of the mortal world, their merits and cultivation complete.

His Master had never liked staying here; it was always his First Disciple-brother, Mingzang, who managed the place. Minghui strode inside. People on both sides pressed their palms together in greeting, and he nodded in return. He passed by layers of golden steps and curtains, beyond lamps shaded by profound Dharma mysteries, and finally saw a monk.

The monk was tall and slender, his hands pressed together, chanting sutras by candlelight. Seeing Minghui enter, he raised an eyebrow and said,

"Little disciple-brother."

Minghui's expression darkened.

He asked, "[Horizon's End of Contemplation]... that side... how are things?"

The Seven Aspects were responsible for assimilating Spirit Beasts and expanding their Buddhist Lands. Each had its own spirit mountain. The most famous were the Compassion Dao's Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm's [Boundless Wondrous Void Cave]. Some others have already fallen into decline, such as Wrath's [Hall of Horns and Furs] and Emptiness's [Temple of No-Delusion Mystery]...

The Way of Joyful Bliss's [Horizon's End of Contemplation] was located in the extreme west of the Western Sea, bordering the Abyss of Weak Water. On its spirit mountain resided the descendants of the Fenglin, the various demons of the Water Mansion!

At this mention, First Disciple-brother Mingzang's expression remained calm, but he sighed.

"There is still activity. Gloom Mountain has sent word to the Buddhist Land several times. They say the ritual disk on the mountain is trembling, showing signs of Pristine Water."

Hearing this, Minghui's expression turned ugly.

"Is it really true?"

His disciple-brother nodded and sighed.

"Could it be... they're settling old scores with the Fenglin?"

Minghui felt his jaw tighten. He shook his head and whispered,

"That Fenglin back then was truly formidable. It was just trapped by an incomplete Water Mansion. It actually joined forces with Dongfang Tianye. One wished to rule the mountains and rivers, the other desired to open up lakes and marshes for the Water Mansion... In the end, heaven and earth were shaken. They were subdued and fell together at the hands of the Liang Emperor and the Demon Monarch..."

"Although the Dragon-kin and the Liang Emperor hadn't yet parted ways at that time, the matter with both Dongfang Tianye and the Fenglin was considered settled. What reason is there to rake it up again? If they truly wanted to settle scores, they wouldn't have waited until today!"

"Ever since the Great Liang was founded, Gloom Mountain's status has plummeted. That's just how it is. With the prestige of our Dao Lineage to deter them, few would dare to get any ideas."

"I just fear... it's that Chi Buzi!"

Mingzang's expression flickered.

"What makes you say that?"

"A cultivator... a great cultivator... who can come and go as he pleases in the Abyss of Weak Water... above Gloom Mountain... how many of those are there in the world? Since the ritual disk gave a clear reading, and it wasn't Water Mansion but Pristine Water, who else could it be? It must be him!"

Minghui, in his youthful form, paced two steps and said angrily,

"There's something unnatural about that guy! He's caused trouble at the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour several times, testing its limits. Now that the people from the Mount Dayang contingent are heavily guarding the place, ready to catch him in the act, he's gone still again... Master said that green-eyed ghost defected to the Dragon-kin. If so, none of this is surprising!"

His eldest disciple-brother sighed heavily, growing more anxious.

"The man is elusive, and his Pristine Water Dao-Profundity is terrifying. He's already on the same level as Wei Xuanyin. Even I am not his match. To deal with him... we can only rely on Master!"

Minghui's expression flickered. He stood up anxiously and paced a few steps. "This is truly troublesome. As long as he hasn't perfected his divine ability, Master has more than enough power to suppress him. But Master's Dharma Body isn't yet complete... it's not a good time to act rashly."

A new layer of anxiety crossed his face.

"Here's what I'm thinking. Since his movements are covert and he hasn't actually attacked, he must be after something. Even if it's the life-mandate of a Spirit Beast, that's something we can negotiate..."

As soon as he said this, Mingzang's expression soured.

"So you're proposing we conspire with him?"

Minghui bowed his head slightly.

"My apologies, disciple-brother," he said, gritting his teeth. "You know Master's spell arts. The [Buddhist Shame] is now complete, and it's the precise time to cultivate the [Evil Terror]. Gloom Mountain has a Great Karmic Affinity with him. If he learns about this, he will definitely go there and raise hell. This is not a good time for that! I urge you, disciple-brother, to prioritize the greater good!"

Mingzang was silent for a moment before replying, "Continue."

Minghui lowered his gaze.

"I had previously used an excuse to leave, intending to go speak with him myself. But now Master has assigned the matter to disciple-brother Mingmeng. That means only he can go. First disciple-brother, you are in charge of affairs... When he reaches the Eastern Sea, I'm hoping you can give him a last-minute instruction: to go and meet with Chi Buzi!"

Mingzang was silent for a long time before finally letting out a breath.

"I suspect... he might still be aiming for Master after all."

...

A fine, endless rain.

Purple qi drifted over the archipelago amidst the endless drizzle. Cultivators flew back and forth, busy among the layers of palaces. The sky gradually darkened, and the flying boats that came and went, riding rays of clear light, grew fewer. Everything was steeped in the fine rain and the encroaching night.

The highest pavilion was exceptionally tranquil. A pale purple curtain of light drifted and swirled, its colors faint. Clear rainwater streamed over the steps, only to be scattered by a pair of boots.

The man was of average height, his Daoist robes fluttering. His features were regular, his eyes holding the hint of a smile. A dot of Heavenly Light rested on his forehead, giving him an air of dashing elegance.

The Daoist Master in white-gold robes stepped up to the pavilion and saw a woman sitting under the eaves, seemingly watching the rain. When she suddenly noticed him, she set down the long-necked jade pot in her hand.

"Exactly ninety days," she said. "And still, it rains."

Kuang Yu was dressed in a pale azure skirt, a thin white silk ribbon tied at her waist. A few dark ornaments hung from one side. Her black hair was softly coiled and held in place by a simple jade hairpin. It was a striking contrast to her usual, simple hairstyle, and it made her appear surprisingly gentle.

She was tall for a female cultivator, standing a full head taller than Tinglan despite her youth. Her usual attire was crisp and bright. In truth, her features were soft, and with her hair coiled this way, she looked even more stunning.

Li Ximing discreetly averted his gaze.

"It rains nine days out of ten in the Xinyu Archipelago," he replied. "It would be stranger if it stopped. The rain has its own flavor—the soft murmur, the rustling of the curtains."

"Hehe." For some reason, she laughed. Standing up, she led him inside.

"I was worried this place wouldn't be as pleasant as the Heavenly Light-filled Ting Province. I even performed a divination yesterday. Cast it three times, just trying to get one clear day."

'The mere weather is something she could change with a single thought. Why would a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator need to divine it three times? She was just debating whether to disperse the rain or not.' Li Ximing chuckled. He met her gaze again, then turned his face slightly.

"I've really put you through a lot of trouble."

'She's clearly a bit flustered herself.'

Seeing him turn away, the woman smiled in secret triumph. Her fair face brightened, and a teasing light entered her blue-purple eyes.

"Daoist friend Ximing," she said, "this [Yin-Yang Mutual Refinement and Conjunction Method] is a secret oral tradition, an orthodox method that must be practiced step-by-step. It's not simple at all. Have you come to understand it?"

Li Ximing gritted his teeth.

"If I didn't understand it, would I have achieved my Bright Yang for nothing?"

Kuang Yu already felt insecure. His retort made her cheeks flush instantly. 

"Then I must ask you for a pointer or two."

Although Kuang Yu possessed a divine ability, she had cultivated at Hengzhu since she was young, living a secluded life. She had no experience with men after achieving the Purple Mansion Realm. How could she win a battle of wits against Li Ximing? The Daoist Master smiled faintly.

"When Yin and Yang join, water and fire merge. It begins with regulating the qi. The qi becomes a dense mist, and one gradually attains the receptive principle..."

He sat upright on the stone stool and took her hand. It was warm in his grasp. Kuang Yu, however, stiffened instantly, her eyes wide as she stared at him blankly. The man before her gazed at her gently and smiled.

"The qi enters the mansion of the Three Profoundities, connecting the upper and lower. It plucks the marvel of water and fire balancing, capturing the light of yin and yang's union. Thus, true yang ascends, and partial yin descends..."

Kuang Yu staggered and found herself right in front of him. Caught off guard, she felt his other hand come to rest on her waist, throwing her into a panic. Her lips parted slightly, but she quickly bit down, turning her head away.

Li Ximing, however, clearly sensed her slender waist. After a moment of tension, it unexpectedly softened, pliant beneath his hand. Now it was his turn for a teasing light to enter his eyes.

"The mouth produces fluid, the myriad bones open their stores, stirring the divine mystery. The yin becomes bright as the moon, the yang rises as brilliant light. For six hundred and eighty short nights, and one thousand eight hundred long dawns, one thus obtains, gradually passing the threshold. This is called 'Flowing'."

The hand on her waist pushed gently, while the hand holding hers pulled. Kuang Yu tumbled into his embrace, landing squarely against his chest. The impact knocked her hairpin loose.

She gasped, "You..."

Li Ximing held her. The hand that had been holding hers now took charge, guiding her wrist to rest against his chest. He quickly released it, instead cupping her chin, tilting her head up.

Her beautiful face was instantly before him, closer than close. He saw the elegant curve of her neck, her tightly pressed lips, her flawless, pink-dusted cheeks, and, beneath lowered lashes, her flustered, blue-purple eyes.

He had guessed right. Her eyes were round and lovely, and the panic and humiliation that made them blink added to their charm.

A very faint, cool fragrance drifted to him.

The woman was powerless, but she stubbornly kept silent, twisting her head to avoid his hand. Then she found the man's expression had turned serious. His lips parted slightly, and a low voice commanded,

"Focus your spirit and calm your qi!"

As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, her ability to focus her mind was extremely strong. Kuang Yu immediately met his gaze, her eyes clearing, filling with focus and tranquility. The two faced each other quietly, their breathing gradually falling into sync.

The [Yin-Yang Mutual Refinement and Conjunction Method]!

A faint radiance immediately emanated from behind Li Ximing, veiled in plumes of rolling mist. The woman's waist grew softer, and a pale, illusory grey light appeared behind her, the two radiances reflecting one another.

Her light breath brushed his face. As the technique slowly circulated, Li Ximing found that her clean fragrance became increasingly distinct.

The scent was cool and exceptionally elegant, like autumn rain outside the pavilion, carrying a rustling chill. Only after that coolness did the fragrance emerge, like a white apricot blossom struck down in a distant, snowy rain. It was faint, yet perfectly clear.

With her short breaths, it seemed to drift near and far, like clear, cold wine that only reveals its vivid, tender red hue when gathered in a bowl.

He was lost in it, silent for a long time. He didn't know how much time had passed until the woman in his arms suddenly shifted. The hand resting on his chest tapped lightly.

Li Ximing was completely absorbed, having lost himself. After a few more breaths, Kuang Yu grew anxious. With a twist of her head, her smooth chin finally broke free from his grasp.

That movement was like a great bell tolling in his ear. Li Ximing snapped back to awareness. The white apricot blossom in his mind resolved back into the beautiful woman before him. A trace of confusion flickered in his mind as he realized Kuang Yu had gone completely limp in his arms, her head lolled to the side, panting weakly.

The woman looked as if she had fainted. Her face was beaded with sweat, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. She had no strength at all, lying limply in his embrace.

His expression turned awkward. He quickly slid one hand under her arms to support her back, while his other hand sifted through her dark hair to support her head.

"Daoist friend Kuang Yu?"

Kuang Yu blinked, and two tears streamed down her pink cheeks. She took several gasping breaths before saying angrily,

"You're so greedy! Were you trying to drain me dry?"

The first stage of the [Yin-Yang Mutual Refinement and Conjunction Method] is the Respiratory Induction Art. It relies on balancing the yin and yang qi—you exhale, I inhale; you inhale, I exhale—to harmonize yin and yang and allow the divine abilities to complement each other. Li Ximing's Bright Yang divine ability was inherently dominant and drew heavily on yin. In his moment of absorption, he had, in a single go, completely drained Kuang Yu's sustaining qi, almost causing her cultivation to break!

Kuang Yu was still unable to rise, remaining in his arms. He apologized repeatedly, hastily grabbing the jade pot.

He filled a cup and passed it to her, saying, "Xinyu, your clear qi is truly... fragrant."

The woman just turned her head. The two tears slid down and dissipated into motes of clear light. The flush on her face vanished, returning to its usual fair, bright, and clean appearance. A trace of resentment lingered in her eyes. She dodged the tea he offered and stood up.

"Allowing you to 'savor' me for three days. It seems it was my mistake."

Only then did Li Ximing realize that what had felt like the snap of a finger had actually been three days. He felt invigorated, his dharma power unified. He quickly said,

"My mistake, my mistake. The Bright Yang is a bit... intense."

But a smile still lingered in his eyes. He struck a pose and shook his head. 

"That was only the first-level method of 'Respiratory Exchange'. The Wondrous Spirit has not been ferried, the Profound Union not yet connected... When we get to _that_ part..."

Kuang Yu was an sharp-witted woman to begin with. She saw at a glance he was teasing her again. Stubbornly refusing to show her annoyance, she quickly cut him off, feigning anger.

"Oh, really! They all say this Daoist Master Zhaojing is so steady. It turns out you're just a smooth-talker. It's called an 'exchange', but you were intentionally 'savoring' me. Who could withstand that?"

"In that case..."

Before she could react, her hand grew warm. The man had taken it again. His other hand found her waist. Kuang Yu pressed her lips together as she was pulled back into his grasp. The man looked down at her and smiled warmly.

"This time, it's your turn to 'savor' me."




# Chapter 1138: The Grand Method

Spiritual Qi swirled and settled, crimson light drew inward.

Within the purple-gold hall, a riot of color filled the hall. Seated at the head of the chamber, the red glow between the young man's palms faded. As the jade token at his waist grew warm, he slowly opened his eyes, and a flash of light swept through the hall, causing all energies to subside.

‘With the help of pills, cultivation has become much faster. Though it still can't compare to the past, the Crimson Severing Arrowhead has turned into a tedious grind.’

Li Zhouwei's cultivation speed was truly terrifying. What he called a 'tedious grind' would be considered an astonishing leap for others, yet he felt a hint of regret. He then noticed someone knocking outside and said casually,

"Come in."

The palace doors opened slowly, and Li Jiangzong entered with an air of urgency.

"My King, I have come to see you!"

Li Zhouwei waved a hand dismissively and asked,

"Did you take our youngest grand-uncle back?"

Li Jiangzong nodded.

"Reporting to my King, it took him over three months to pay respects to the ancestors and meet with the elders of the various lineages. Then, it took another two months for the elders to seriously select a suitable child to be adopted—after all, it concerns the lineage's descendants. The elders were very thorough, assessing every detail. And then, the old master was so welcoming that our grand-uncle couldn't refuse... so he stayed another two months."

"He left five months ago. My King, you have been in seclusion for more than a year."

Li Jiangliang and his wife had naturally departed earlier. Li Zhouwei had taken the opportunity to meet with Li Yuanqin once, but time in the Purple Mansion Realm passed in a blink. After returning, he had entered seclusion for a full year. He asked,

"Which child did he take back?"

Li Jiangzong replied,

"The old master originally told him to choose from the SuiYu generation, but they were all grown up, and he didn't like any of them. So he had to go down another generation and adopted a pair of twins. It wasn't strictly according to the rules, but the old master was so happy he was willing to return that he let him have his way."

"The two are the eldest and second sons of the QingYuan generation. He even chose their names himself. One is named Li Qinggong and the other Li Qingduo."

"A pair of them?"

"Yes, a pair," Li Jiangzong said. "The old master couldn't bear the thought of the ancestral incense continuing to dwindle outside the family, and he thought that one person should remain by the lake to light incense for Lord Xiangping. Both children kowtowed and acknowledged him as their ancestor, with one staying by the lake and the other sent to the south."

"That's a good method," Li Zhouwei praised, his heart filled with a profound sense of peace.

Li Jiangzong knelt down respectfully.

"I apologize for the disturbance, my King, but it's not about this matter... My third brother has returned with two of the royal lineage... They have come of age and can begin cultivation, and they specifically returned to see you. The old master approved as well, and they are waiting for you in the palace!"

"Jiangxia?" Li Zhouwei's expression shifted slightly. "It is time I see them."

Li Jiangzong was immediately overjoyed and was about to speak, but a crimson light flared before his eyes. The colors swirled and intertwined, then suddenly lit up. The Li Zhouwei he was looking at was now seated on a magnificent golden throne. His majestic face was illuminated by the Heavenly Light from both sides, and his golden eyes shone brilliantly.

From all around him came a respectful chorus: "We greet King Wei!"

He followed suit and knelt, looking around to find that he had already been transported to the Golden Palace on the island!

‘King Wei’s divine ability is becoming even more transcendent!’

He quietly retreated to the side. The entire golden palace fell silent. Li Zhouwei looked out and saw Li Suining standing beside Li Xuanxuan, his face free of any anxiety. His gaze then swept over Li Jiangxia and quickly landed on the woman behind him, who looked nervous and anxious.

A pair of children were holding her hands.

"Father!" Li Jiangxia stepped forward, leading his beloved concubine and children before him.

The Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace was clearly uncomfortable with his current lowered state. His face was pale, and the drop back to the Foundation Establishment Realm left him with a feeling of danger, as if his life could be controlled by another at any moment. He was slightly out of breath.

Li Zhouwei looked at the two children and a smile finally graced his face. He raised an eyebrow.

"Come closer. Let me take a look."

Zou, who came from a humble family, was filled with dread, whether facing the Li clan that dominated Ting Province or King Wei, who did not kneel before the emperor. She knelt, her face covered in cold sweat, urging her two children to go forward.

Li Suichu stared at his grandfather's golden eyes without any fear. He took a few quick steps up the stairs, bowed respectfully, and said,

"Greetings, Grandfather!"

Li Zhouwei stood up, bent down to look at him closely, and sighed with a smile.

"You really do resemble your father!"

At these words, a complex expression appeared on Li Jiangxia's face. He led his daughter forward, bringing her close.

"Father, this is Zhi'er."

Li Zhouwei turned to look at her, playfully saying a few words, but the girl's face remained deathly pale. She did not dare to look at him, clutching her sleeve tightly.

Li Suining stood below, smiling as he watched his third uncle's two children, a hint of sorrow in his heart.

In his second life, all the Li family members were scattered in the north, separated by thousands of miles, so Li Suining had no idea what happened to his uncles. But in his first life, he knew with certainty... Li Suichu had died in battle in the north.

As for Zhi'er, Li Jiangxia's cherished darling, she had married Lin Caiyin of the Lin clan. A year later, news came that she had suffered a cultivation deviation and died of severe injuries. A year after that, Lin Caiyin was imprisoned for speaking disrespectfully. If not for Lin Chensheng's protection, he would have lost his life as well!

‘A direct descendant of Wei, cultivating an orthodox lineage... cultivation deviation...’

He lowered his eyes, remaining silent, until the Daoist Master smiled.

"What grand method do they cultivate?"

Li Jiangxia bowed and replied, "Suichu cultivates the Li Fire. He has come home this time to request a Dao Lineage. As for Zhi'er... I happened to get a Wandering Metal lineage and wanted her to cultivate the Gazing the Metal Apex. It was left to me by an old friend."

"As long as you have a plan in mind."

This matter only required Li Zhouwei's approval; he did not need to be concerned about it. King Wei let out a laugh and looked at the old man below.

"Old master, have they paid respects to the ancestors?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded solemnly, letting out a sigh.

Li Zhouwei, however, understood what Li Xuanxuan meant: the had clearly not received the divine favor. He subtly reached into his sleeve and took out a pair of small swords. They were a brilliant golden color, no longer than a forearm. He blew gently on the two swords, and fine specks of light fell, their radiance contained. King Wei smiled.

"Your Uncle Jiangzong has some talent in artifact forging. He once crafted this pair of golden swords to celebrate my birthday. Today, I'll give them to you as a gift."

Li Jiangxia smiled but said nothing. Zou, on the other hand, was overwhelmed with gratitude, as if she had been spared from disaster. She pulled her two children and repeatedly thanked him. They retreated to the middle of the hall. Li Jiangxia said nothing more, bowing his head.

"Your son is stationed in the north. I've already delayed too long. May you be well, Father. Your son will depart immediately."

Li Zhouwei nodded, watching the family leave. He brought his hands from behind his back to his chest and said,

"You are all dismissed."

"Yes!"

Everyone bowed and withdrew, soon leaving only Li Xuanxuan and Li Suining, who was helping him. The old man saw Li Zhouwei give a slight nod and then went down as well. At the palace doors, he seemed to hesitate, turning his head. Seeing that Li Suining had escorted him to the entrance and stopped without a word, he felt at ease and continued on.

The great hall instantly fell silent. The formation activated, isolating the inside from the outside. Li Suining bowed before him.

"This junior has something to report and has disturbed my King's cultivation..."

That was right... before Li Jiangzong had requested an audience, it was Li Suining who had awakened Li Zhouwei!

Now, besides Li Ximing and Li Xuanxuan, only he could bypass the ranks and directly reach this place to interrupt Li Zhouwei's cultivation!

The jade pendant in his hand could contact Li Zhouwei at any time. He could even crush it to instantly summon King Wei to his own cave dwelling! However, his conduct had always been respectful, so he did not dare to activate the token inside his own dwelling. Instead, he had bowed outside the hall, waiting for an audience.

He prostrated himself and got straight to the point, saying respectfully, "This junior has a grand method to offer!"

Li Zhouwei smiled, sounding quite expectant. "Oh?"

Li Suining raised his hands and offered the white jade slip he was holding between his palms. Li Zhouwei took it. With a sweep of his spiritual sense, his expression changed abruptly.

The Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam.

This method was based on the mystery of a Spiritual Artifact, imitating the techniques of Vault Metal and Protecting Wood, harmonizing the two to absorb the anomalous energies of heaven and earth, summoning a change to seize the profound and collect spiritual essence! Because it was based on the mystery of a Spiritual Artifact, it was more like a simple grand method than a spell art!

The so-called "anomalous energies of heaven and earth" included the energy of mountains shifting and seas overturning, the leaking energies of earth veins and fire veins, and the gathering energies of strange and profound lands... such as the Li Fire fire vein in a certain part of the Eastern Sea, the malevolent aura in the lake beneath the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, or the scattering malevolence when the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple received the Manifestations Earth...

Although the conditions were demanding, this method could bind these energies and transform them into resources. If the collected spiritual essence was good enough, it could even condense spiritual resources for the Purple Mansion Realm.

Most importantly, these things included a portion of the Five Virtues' phenomena!

‘This is the starting point of the grand method. It's not for some spiritual resources!’

Li Zhouwei was shaken. Four words immediately came to his mind.

‘Break through the Purple Mansion!’

‘Conceal Jiangqian's Purple Mansion phenomena!’

He took the matter of Li Jiangqian very seriously, even more so than his own cultivation, which was now of little consequence to him. Li Zhouwei had long thought about concealing this phenomenon!

‘One reason is to keep it as a trump card. The second... is to reduce suspicion!’

From Li Ximing to himself, the time it took to break through was terrifyingly short. Li Zhouwei had destiny on his side, which made it easier to explain. Jiangqian could be barely be covered up, but when Que'wan broke through one after another, people would connect the dots. Everyone would have hit the same point in just over a decade, which would surely arouse suspicion!

Li Ximing's decision to send Li Que'wan to the Peacock Sea had a certain consideration behind it.

Methods of concealment were not unheard of. He had secretly gone to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, where there were roughly two kinds. One was a profound spell art that was not only expensive but also extremely difficult to learn, a great waste of both time and resources. The other was simpler but had strict requirements, needing divine abilities like the Untraceable Presence of Upper Shaman or Convergence of Valleys of Valley Water. Bright Yang cultivators could not do it.

He had intended to discuss this with Mount Dali, but Qingyu Qian had obtained the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence and hastily entered seclusion, from which he had yet to emerge. Li Zhouwei had even inquired about the methods within the scroll, considering using the Yang clan's help.

But after a long consideration, he had not acted.

‘First, the people of the Underworld cannot easily come to the lake due to the Azure Insight Origin Mirror. They are also unwilling to come to the lake. The more important point is... if a grand method is used, someone needs to maintain it constantly. Whether it is the spell arts from the hall or Suining's Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam, it requires a person to constantly cast the spell...'

‘This would also be extremely suspicious. At this point, a normal Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would never use such a method, because there is more than enough time!’

He had given up on the idea. But now, this Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam solved his most pressing problem, and the shock it gave him was far from over!

‘The Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam requires a Protecting Wood Spiritual Artifact that has a mysterious ability to contain... It can only collect just over half of the Five Virtues. Among the Fire Virtue, the only ones it's incompatible with are the Merging Fire, which is associated with sickness and pain, and the Blazing Fire, which is associated with rectifying Wood Qi... What does this mean?’

‘It points directly to the Heavenly Nurture Urn and Jiangqian. One could say it was tailor-made!’

The Divine Ability remained silent, and Li Suining lowered his head, his heart pounding.

Where did this Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam come from?

It was an ancient spell art that Li Que'wan and Daoist Master Yuanbian had jointly modified! It was specifically for the Heavenly Nurture Urn. In his previous life, it had been given to him. As a half-Divine Ability cultivator in the Mystic Realm, he had constantly maintained it to hide the breakthrough phenomena of their grand-uncle, Li Jiangchun!

But in his second life, Li Jiangqian's phenomena were completely exposed without any concealment!

He lowered his head, feeling a little guilty. Li Zhouwei did not ask how he had come to possess such a spell art. Instead, he examined it closely, his eyes gleaming.

"This thing of yours has solved a major problem for me!"

As soon as he said this, Li Suining became more relaxed. With a mind full of thoughts, he quickly said,

"That was my thinking too! If my grand-uncle can leave seclusion quietly, with his abilities and the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear, he will be of great benefit to the situation in the north and south!"

‘This kid even knows about the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument...’

Li Zhouwei uncharacteristically let out a couple of laughs and reminded him,

"That... the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear... he should not have acquired it yet."

"Oh..." Li Suining was momentarily at a loss for words, giving an awkward smile.

After all, he himself was not in the Purple Mansion Realm and had only achieved the breakthrough in the grotto-heaven late. He only knew that the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear were famous weapons that Li Jiangqian had acquired very early on...

As he was trying to find something to say to ease the awkwardness, the man before him turned his golden eyes to stare directly at him. With a raised eyebrow, he smiled, and a voice that made Li Suining shudder instantly came:

"You can even guess when he will leave seclusion?"

Li Suining had not expected him to see through his little plan in an instant. He opened his mouth but couldn't say a word.

Having gained the secrets of his second life, all he had done in his cave dwelling, besides researching the ratios of the mystic realm Profound Foundation, was to write this cultivation method. Yet, he had held onto it, not giving it to Li Zhouwei for a long time, and he had his own reasons for that!

‘The phenomena is a matter of the Shengyang Acupoint rising and a resonance with heaven and earth. By the time a sign appears, it is too late to stop it. Therefore, all spell arts that can hide the phenomena need to be maintained at all times. The Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam is no exception. Handling an affair of this divine magnitude is fraught with difficulty!’

Therefore, Li Suining had not given this spell art to Li Zhouwei in advance, which would have been a waste of Li Zhouwei's time. Others didn't know when Li Jiangqian would leave seclusion, but he did!

He was momentarily speechless, but Li Zhouwei had gotten the exact information he needed and was in a great mood. He revealed the Heavenly Nurture Urn with its wooden grain carvings in his hand. In just a moment, a magnificent cascade of divine power surged out.

King Wei laughed and said, "How much time is left?"

Li Suining had deliberately left time for Li Zhouwei to familiarize himself with the grand method. Seeing that he had mastered it in an instant, he secretly praised him in his heart and said with a smile,

'Three days!"




# Chapter 1139: Changli

The Li Fire is the truest expression of flame. It neither waxes nor wanes. In the heavens, it is a radiant beacon of spiritual light; on the earth, a hidden brilliance concealed within Double Fire. It is of the second order of manifestation, the very pillar of True Fire. It is the scorching heat that incinerates metal and boils the seas, the fundamental power that masters the abyss and nourishes life.

His immortal foundation surged past the twelvefold tower of his soul as boundless illusions gave way. A brilliant light washed over the landscape of his mind, and crimson light dissolved, fragment by fragment. The youth with golden eyes and crimson robes lowered the hands he held clasped before his chest. In that instant, the mental vista—a sky filled with celestial beings and a man shackled in heavy golden chains—vanished as one, leaving nothing but a silent void.

A pair of deep golden eyes snapped open. The cold, decisive resolve from his vision, as unyielding as ancient ice, finally began to thaw. The gloom within the Profound Chamber started to recede.

A soft pop echoed.

Two golden-red embers flickered to life, and the dim Profound Chamber was flooded with an endless sea of apricot-hued light. Li Jiangqian’s eyes, now open, slowly scanned his surroundings. Within their usual brilliant gold, a faint crimson sheen now swirled. He stood unmoving amidst the boundless Li Fire, a faint smile gracing his lips.

'The Purple Mansion Realm, achieved!'

Yet he didn't move. Instead, he slowly closed his eyes, as if to contain a scorching power within. A sharp, stabbing pain flared between his heart and lungs, forcing him back a step. He drew a deep breath.

Pfft!

The next moment, an apricot-red halo burst from his lips. It rose before descending, hovering and swirling without end as motes of fire danced like the rustling leaves of a phoenix tree caught in an autumn wind.

He steadied his chest with one hand while raising the other. With two fingers, he plucked something from the swirling light, then clenched his fist. Straightening up, he smiled and opened his palm.

An apricot-yellow flame, no larger than a fingernail, danced in his palm. Its light was intensely bright, and a subtle, wondrous quality emanated from it, resonating with his very life-mandate. In an instant, like a bursting dam, it erupted in a flash of infinite golden-red!

The Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun states: "When the heart-fire is hidden and the sun has set, the south remains bright. By facing south, one governs the world."

'A fire born from the resonance of my life-mandate… This is a Purple Mansion-level flame!'

That pair of gold-and-crimson eyes swept through the hazy Li Fire. He raised his brows slightly, quickly realizing something was wrong.

The roiling Li Fire had reached its absolute peak the moment he broke through, yet this felt nothing like a typical Purple Mansion advancement. The Li Fire throughout the entire chamber was already decaying at an incredible rate, its color visibly fading before his eyes.

In the space of a single breath, darkness descended once more. Like a receding tide, it revealed dharma lamps that had been corroded to fragments by the Li Fire. A contemplative look appeared in the golden-eyed, crimson-robed man's eyes as he stared at the tightly sealed chamber door.

BOOM!

Riddled with holes from the corrosive Li Fire that had poured through it, the door shattered, revealing the scene outside.

The man outside the hall was an imposing figure with a terrifying aura. Golden patterns writhed on his ink-black robes, and his light purple feather cloak bloomed with intricate golden runes, forming a seamless whole. A king’s battle-axe hung inverted at his waist where a qilin seemed to leap into motion. In his hands, he held a wood-grained urn into which the last, thinned-out remnants of the Li Fire were pouring, with no hope of escape.

A pair of somber golden eyes shone from the darkness. His father’s gaze fell upon him.

'Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm!'

The man before him hadn’t unleashed any divine abilities, yet a fatal sense of danger washed over Li Jiangqian. He felt a moment of dazed confusion, and after the heart-stopping pressure passed, he was left in a state of profound shock.

'Three divine abilities?! How long has it been?'

The shock from Li Zhouwei was so immense that he stood stunned for a moment before noticing the middle-aged man at his side. He wore a white-gold Daoist robe, a dot of gold adorned his brow, and he exuded an air of carefree ease. The smile on his face was kind as he watched Li Jiangqian intently.

In the next instant, the young man’s face broke into a wide grin. With a shake of his robes, he crossed the distance in a few quick steps and knelt on one knee. His voice was sonorous and strong.

"Your son has not failed you! I have achieved a divine ability!"

He heard his father let out a laugh. He seemed to be in a good mood, his voice deep yet cheerful.

"Congratulations!"

That single word of congratulations dispelled the years of distance between them. A smile spread across Li Jiangqian’s face. His thoughts moved quickly, and he had already figured everything out.

"I’ve troubled you two Daoist Masters to stand guard… and to conceal my breakthrough for me!"

Li Ximing had just rushed back after receiving the news. Compared to Li Zhouwei’s stoicism, the joy on his face was undisguised.

"Rise and speak," he said warmly.

The newly advanced Daoist Master stood, his expression radiating high spirits.

"This junior has mastered the Great Parting Scripture. My heart-fire is now contained, and through resonance with my life-mandate, I have produced a new flame!"

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. He watched as Li Jiangqian opened his palm, and a surge of apricot-yellow flame erupted. It felt ancient and profound, its edges glowing with an amber Li Fire halo, its colors dazzling.

"A Purple Mansion Spirit Fire: the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire!"

"Hm?"

Li Zhouwei’s gaze shifted. He stared at the flame for a moment before reaching out and delicately plucking a wisp of it between his fingers.

The flame, so docile in Li Jiangqian’s hand, instantly swelled with violent power in Li Zhouwei’s grasp. It thrashed restlessly, radiating a destructive aura. But the faint scale-like patterns on Li Zhouwei's palm flashed once, and the flame was extinguished, leaving only a faint white mark on his skin.

Li Jiangqian knew better than anyone the true power of his Li Fire; his eyelids twitched as he watched. Li Zhouwei, however, merely offered praise.

"To think it has a sliver of the Supreme Yang’s might. Not bad."

Li Ximing was a true connoisseur of fire. His sharp gaze had long since identified the flame’s extraordinary nature, and he nodded in approval.

"Truly worthy of a sixth-grade technique! To be born with its own Purple Mansion Spirit Fire is remarkable. Even without any other unique properties, this alone is enough for you to stand firm among those with a single divine ability!"

"Indeed!"

Though he had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, Li Jiangqian’s attitude hadn't changed in the slightest. He lowered his eyes respectfully and said,

"Reporting to the Daoist Masters, this fire originates from the spell-type divine ability, the Great Parting Scripture. The 'Great' signifies immensity, a boundless expanse that alludes to the First Manifestation. 'Parting' refers to the fundamental, orthodox nature of the Li Fire. And 'Scripture' in this context means 'to record'—to use the vastness of the Manifestation and the orthodox nature of Parting to inscribe my Daoist arts!"

"For this reason, the Great Parting Scripture is also known as the Art of Gazing Upon and Describing the Sun. However, because the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun emphasizes orthodox nature and the diligent cultivation of Li Fire, it is known by the former name."

Li Jiangqian paused before continuing.

"The character 'Li' is associated with the heart. This flame emerged through the resonance of my life-mandate, hence it is called a Heart-Fire. Its power is considerable, possessing an incinerating quality with a trace of the Supreme Yang’s demon-quelling might. And because it resonates with my life-mandate, it has gained an extra touch of the Bright Yang’s subtlety!"

Li Zhouwei already knew that Li Fire could resonate with one's life-mandate, but Li Ximing frowned as he listened.

"When you reached the Foundation Establishment Realm," he said softly, "you mentioned this art had a wondrous connection to the First Manifestation. I thought it was just a minor property, but I never imagined it would become so pronounced after achieving your divine ability. It’s often said that Li Fire is akin to Bright Yang, but I never thought it would also have ties to the Supreme Yang…"

Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"The First Manifestation is not named so for nothing. Is there any fire-virtue that does not yearn for the Supreme Yang? Even something as unruly as the Merging Fire has a lineage of spirit flames related to the Supreme Yang, to say nothing of Li Fire!"

Li Jiangqian nodded thoughtfully and continued, "Aside from the flame itself, the most wondrous aspect… is the Heart-Mansion."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. The crimson-robed youth smiled, and flames surged within his chest. His skin and flesh rippled like water, glowing with a deep red light. His heart and lungs had vanished. In their place, nestled within the cavity, was a small mansion with white bricks and red tiles, staggered in its architecture and glowing with a profound light.

"When ordinary cultivators absorb fire, they store it between the Juque and the Sea of Qi acupoints, or perhaps the Shengyang acupoint for the more talented. But my divine ability has reforged my organs, leaving only this Heart-Mansion to house the flame."

"The Heart-Mansion can directly consume Li Fire spiritual materials and woods with excellent effect. It can also contain and trap Spiritual Artifacts… though it’s far inferior to the Audience with the Celestial Gate ability, which specializes in confounding artifacts, it is still a decent tool."

"Furthermore, flames nurtured within the Heart-Mansion for many years will grow more attuned to me, harmonizing and becoming easier to control… I can even gather similar flames and refine them together within the mansion…"

A hint of bitterness touched his face as he added, "But… it still can’t compare to Grand-uncle’s Valley Wind Guide-Fire."

At his words, Li Ximing simply smiled.

"No need to prod me. I’m already on the verge of envying you!"

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian’s heart skipped a beat, already sensing what it meant. He pressed on, "And with the blessing of sunlight, the Great Parting Scripture excels at manipulating Li-Light. The Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun describes this as 'swallowing flame, plucking Li-Light.' The Heart-Mansion can refine Li-Light as well!"

"Beyond these abilities, the Great Parting Scripture is also of great use for movement. Whether traversing the mortal world or walking the Great Void, it provides a significant boost. If I were to cultivate a Great Void-walking technique, I could surely come and go as I please within the Great Void!"

"The other minor properties, such as being constantly wreathed in Li Fire or consuming wood to incinerate metal, are hardly worth mentioning."

Li Ximing, who had cultivated the Great Parting's White Brilliance, had been studying the Heart-Mansion of this new divine ability for some time. The more he looked, the more familiar it seemed. Now, hearing Li Jiangqian's explanation, he instantly understood.

"No wonder," he sighed. "No wonder the Great Parting's White Brilliance and the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun are considered a set. They truly complement one another…"

Li Zhouwei, having listened to it all, spoke with a note of regret.

"If Grand-uncle had cultivated the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun, the divine ability you possess today would be no less than that of Shilou Yingge or Murong Yan!"

But the man in the white-gold Daoist robe showed no sign of regret. Instead, he chuckled.

"If I had cultivated that Sutra, I likely wouldn’t have been able to achieve a divine ability at all without the proper Li Fire spiritual resources!"

He turned to Li Jiangqian and sighed softly.

"Now that you’ve also reached this realm, the family can finally breathe a sigh of relief."

With a wave of his hand, Li Zhouwei plucked an object from the Great Void.

It was perfectly round, like a Golden Core, and wreathed in countless golden threads. Leaping spiritual flames intertwined and swirled around it, shot through with iridescent colors. Streams of Li-Light pulsed from its poles, resembling fine golden threads that were exceptionally alluring.

The Li Fire Spiritual Treasure, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

This treasure had been suspended here for many years to aid Li Jiangqian in his breakthrough. Now that he had succeeded, it was finally free from its station!

Li Jiangqian’s eyes lit up at the sight of it. But this Li Fire Spiritual Treasure, a coveted item in all of Jiangnan, seemed to be nothing more than an ordinary object in Li Zhouwei’s eyes. With a casual toss, he threw the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument into his son's arms.

"Since you’ve achieved a divine ability," he said with a smile, "take it and use it!"

Li Jiangqian had received a promise of this from Li Ximing before and had been moved to tears at the time. He knew, however, that his father wouldn't be swayed by such displays. Overcome with joy, he let out a chuckle and tucked the treasure away without ceremony.

"Father is wise! This great kindness…"

"Enough! We’re family. There's no need for such politeness."

Li Zhouwei laughed, cutting him off, then his expression turned serious.

"Both the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and the Great Parting's White Brilliance require a Li Fire to fuel them. Your Southern Brightness Heart-Fire is rare, and it would be a waste to use it for that. Your grand-uncle has already made arrangements. You will have a suitable Li Fire when the time comes."

Li Jiangqian’s eyes grew even brighter with secret delight. He turned to Li Ximing, bowed respectfully, and shook his head.

"This junior has this one Li Fire, and it is enough. Grand-uncle possesses a Life Divine Ability and commands many spirit flames; their synergy produces a qualitative leap in power. Besides, a spirit flame is far too precious…"

Li Ximing shook his head slightly.

"There’s no need for modesty. While I have a knack for harmonizing flames, I’ve already taken on three and dare not add another. For a Bright Yang cultivator with no exceptional Dao-Profundity or Mandate of Heaven divine ability to harmonize three separate flames in a mere century of cultivation is already unheard of. If I continued to accept every spirit flame that came my way, wouldn’t that be a clear sign that something is amiss?"

Only then did Li Jiangqian nod, thanking him profusely. Li Zhouwei had not intervened. After listening, he handed his son a jade slip and gestured to the Heavenly Nurture Urn in his hand.

"This Heavenly Nurture Urn, combined with the Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam, has collected the phenomenon from your breakthrough. It is stored within the urn's power but has not yet been refined. Since it is the phenomenon from your own cultivation, you should spend some time to process it."

A smile touched his lips.

"A breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm can alter the very earth veins of a region. Capturing such a vast phenomenon cost this king a tremendous amount of dharma power. Even with significant losses during the collection, if you refine it properly, you are guaranteed to get at least one or two portions of Li Fire spiritual resources."

King Wei’s golden eyes flickered. He glanced at his son with amusement.

"And the thing you’ve been longing for is inside as well!"

Though he had expected it, Li Jiangqian still found it hard to believe. He accepted the Spiritual Treasure and connected his spiritual sense to it. From deep within, the blazing divine ability of an Upright Wood shone into his eyes!

It was a Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast!

His heart jolted with shock and joy.

"The Azure Talisman… it’s done, just like that!"

The surprise and excitement in his eyes were genuine. He took a deep breath, looked from his father to Li Ximing, and chose his words carefully.

"This junior has received a monumental kindness… I will say no more. If I can quickly solidify my divine ability, I will surely be of great help to the north and south… It’s just…"

Li Zhouwei understood his meaning.

"There is no rush. Breaking through in just ten years is already shocking enough. How could you possibly refine your second divine ability in one go? Fortunately, now that you have one, you can guide Talisman Qi. You may accept the Azure Talisman, but there is no hurry to raise your cultivation level."

Years ago, Li Zhouwei had set aside the refined essence from an Azure Talisman’s decree. Li Jiangqian had been hesitating, but these words made his eyes light up with satisfaction, and he nodded repeatedly.

Li Ximing exchanged a look with Li Zhouwei.

"Now that you have achieved a divine ability, there are certain methods we must teach you…" He smiled, his interest piqued. "But first… you should have a Daoist title."

This sentence truly sent Li Jiangqian into silent contemplation. He deliberated for a long moment, his golden eyes flickering, before a smile broke out on his face.

"Grand-uncle, your name heralds the bright dawn. Father, you are like the ascendant sun itself. This junior cultivates the Li Fire and serves you both. My only wish is that this Bright Yang will shine anew, and its light never fade…"

"The character 'Chang' represents the eternal sun. Therefore, let my title be Changli!"




# Chapter 1140: The Water of the Spring of Rebirth

‘Changli.’

Li Ximing listened with a smile and nodded, but Li Zhouwei turned, shaking his head.

“Since you’ve decided, then Changli it is,” he said. “Our family is built upon the clan. We’re not like the Golden Feather Sect with its two distinct Dao-paths. Since we already have generation names, there’s no need to start a tradition of Daoist titles. That would only disrupt our customs.”

Li Jiangqian offered a faint smile.

“It’s just that my younger brothers all have the potential for the Purple Mansion Realm. If we brothers can share that, it would lessen any distance between us…”

At the mention of affairs between the brothers, Li Ximing simply turned his head and pretended not to hear. Li Zhouwei shot him a glance and said,

“Since he’s a Holder of the Profound, that’s a matter for the Yang clan. We will not interfere.”

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian clasped his hands quite naturally.

“I’ll remember that.”

He then took his seat. Li Ximing first pressed a jade slip into his hand for him to read carefully. Li Jiangqian memorized its contents and, without needing any prompting from his elders, crushed the jade slip in his palm. Only then did Li Ximing nod and begin to recount the events of the past few years.

Li Jiangqian held his cup and listened for some time. When he heard his elder mention in passing how Li Zhouwei had annihilated the fifth-generation Maha, body and soul, with a single swing of his battle-axe, he couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of tea.

“Since Vast Cicada was a treasured figure to a powerhouse in the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, this matter can’t possibly be over,” Li Jiangqian said.

“In terms of interests, they no longer have a reason to contest our family and have withdrawn from the northern coalition. But monks like them are obsessed with cause and effect. The failure of such a great figure carries immense significance… they are the ones we must be most wary of.”

Li Zhouwei was not surprised, but Li Ximing grew pensive and nodded gravely.

“You have a point…”

A momentary silence fell over the hall. Li Jiangqian was eager to finally see the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance he had longed for, but since the two Daoist Masters made no move, he waited in silence.

Li Zhouwei stood with his hands clasped behind his back, slowly walking out of the main hall. He paused at the entrance, his gaze fixed quietly on the horizon.

Li Jiangqian felt a flicker of doubt, but Li Ximing’s expression shifted slightly. He motioned for him to remain calm, then rose and stood at the front of the hall, waiting as well.

The setting sun sank rapidly below the horizon, swallowed by the encroaching darkness. Long after the last sliver of red had vanished, the two familiar figures they were expecting had yet to appear. A glint of understanding flashed in Li Ximing’s eyes as he lowered his head in thought.

The golden-eyed youth waited patiently until the dead of night before a smile of amusement touched his lips.

“So, they really can’t perceive Jiangqian?”

Li Ximing hesitated for a moment.

“That is… interesting.”

They weren't waiting for just anyone. They were waiting for emissaries from the Underworld. The two Underworld emissaries, Zhang Gui and Wang Long, were responsible for overseeing all Purple Mansion breakthroughs in this region. The Underworld was a terrifying place, its reach all-encompassing. Not a single cultivator who broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm in Jiangnan could escape their notice. Li Zhouwei had once asked Dingjiao about it, and the Dragon Prince had told him:

“Every person in the world is recorded on a list in the Underworld. For those who cultivate the path of the Purple Mansion and the Golden Core, the Underworld can even know their exact cultivation level and the arts they practice!”

The Underworld likely used this list to keep track of Purple Mansion cultivators and manage the Quest for Gold.

“When Great-Granduncle broke through, Zhang Gui and Wang Long came here,” Li Zhouwei continued. “Judging by their conduct, both emissaries are likely trusted agents of the Yang family. They revealed two things… First, Yang Tianya. They knew a storm was coming and that the Azure Pond Sect was on the verge of decline. By revealing the existence of a Purple Mansion cultivator from the Yang family, their goal was to prevent friction between our families and avoid chaos in the turbulent times ahead.”

“And the second thing?”

“That… there was no name.”

Li Jiangqian listened quietly from the side as Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

“You mean… it’s likely that his name is not on their list either?”

The youth paced a few steps.

“This list of theirs can be avoided even by the Shaman-Register Dao and the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature,” he said in a low voice. “It certainly wouldn’t contain the names of True Monarchs. The status of a Talisman Seed is exceedingly high. Even that dignitary from the Yang family couldn’t perceive it directly, so it’s only natural that they failed to record you or me.”

“There’s one other possibility… the Azure Insight Origin Mirror.”

At these words, Li Jiangqian’s eyebrows twitched. Li Zhouwei’s expression was grim.

“Whether it’s the former, the latter, or a combination of the two, the Underworld has little control over Ting Province—a place where even the Martial Cultivation Star dares not shine. If that’s the case, then the Underworld, which is otherwise unstoppable, can only rely on observing phenomena to determine if someone has achieved a breakthrough!”

Li Jiangqian processed this and fell into contemplation. After a long while, he said,

“Then this is a good thing. I suspect the moment I take a single step off this lake, the Underworld will know.”

The three of them waited until dawn, but the figures from the Underworld never appeared. Leaving Li Zhouwei to continue cultivating in the hall and watch over the mortal world, Li Ximing finally led Li Jiangqian into the domain.

Even after cultivating here for many years, Li Ximing was still struck by the sheer density of the spiritual energy upon re-entry, to say nothing of Li Jiangqian, who was visiting for the first time. His expression changed.

With a simple gesture, he asked in astonishment,

“Yin and yang… perfectly balanced?”

Li Ximing had experienced something similar before, so the sensation wasn't as profound for him. For Li Jiangqian, however, it was the first time in his life he had felt such a perfect equilibrium. It felt strangely alien. He closed his eyes and exhaled deeply. When he opened them again, two faint red lights flickered within his pupils.

“Great-Granduncle… since entering this place, my Li Fire divine ability has become both more vigorous and more gentle.”

“Oh?”

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He watched as Li Jiangqian, his eyes shining with a rare intensity, looked around, ascended the steps, and made his way to the High Firmament Pavilion. He lightly touched the jade platform, and a tremor ran through his body.

An unknown amount of time passed before he opened his eyes again, a look of profound shock lingering within them. He remained silent for a long time, then turned his head abruptly. Li Ximing was standing quietly behind him, his gaze calm and deep.

Li Jiangqian was silent for a moment before hearing him laugh.

“I’ve already checked for you. The family possesses the Great Parting Scripture and the Grasp of Ninefold Heaven. The other three—Position Arising from Entanglement, Burning Annihilation, and Concordant Conquest—are all here in the pavilion, complete.”

Li Jiangqian nodded, a strange look on his face.

“Position Arising from Entanglement and Concordant Conquest… Li Fire cultivators aren’t known for manipulating fate… yet there are two Life Divine Abilities!”

Li Ximing had never considered that point. He pondered it now.

“True… When your father gave me the Southern Emperor’s Profound Snare Method, he mentioned that the trigrams Dui (Dui Metal), Kan (Pit Water), and Li (Li Fire) form a single entity. Now that you bring it up, Pit Water cultivators are also famous for their abundance of Life Divine Abilities…”

Li Jiangqian seemed lost in thought. He nodded in understanding and, without further hesitation, walked into the pavilion. He sat cross-legged, took out the Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam, and began to read it intently. Within four hours, he had grasped its essence. He brought out the Heavenly Nurture Urn, held a flame in his mouth, and gently exhaled.

A swarm of simple, apricot-yellow Southern Brightness Heart-Fire surged forward, suspending the Spiritual Treasure in mid-air. It suppressed the Li Fire within the artifact, aiding in its refinement, while Li Jiangqian himself began to circulate the wondrous power within the Golden Core-like treasure.

Li Ximing glanced over.

“What technique is that?” he asked, curious.

Li Jiangqian opened his eyes and smiled.

“Great-Granduncle, the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire is a manifestation of my own life-mandate; it is one with me. Not only can it refine spiritual artifacts and execute techniques on my behalf, but its aura is also identical to my own!”

Although Li Ximing’s Valley Wind Guide-Fire could control flames, it couldn’t imbue them with life as Li Jiangqian’s could. It could only rely on its simple spiritual nature to tend to an alchemy furnace. He felt a pang of envy.

“A pity that Li Fire is useless for alchemy or artifact refinement. Otherwise, one person could do the work of three. For everything heaven grants, it takes something away… this is a perfect example.”

He sighed, then said, “I won’t disturb you any longer. But remember, within the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, there is a copy of the Southern Li Ingestion Method. It is a unique Li Fire art for cultivating the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature. Since you have already manifested your divine abilities, you would do well to study it.”

Li Jiangqian acknowledged his words. Watching his elder depart, he sat down cross-legged, seemingly to meditate on the profound arts.

But from the conversation, he had realized that the state of the world was far more complex than he had ever imagined, and his family’s background was shrouded in greater mystery. His thoughts were in turmoil, yet a new, complicated resolve was forming within him.

‘The great tides of the world are sweeping up the Bright Yang… but even Dharma Masters can fail. Haven’t I witnessed the power of the master of the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance? Mount Luoxia may be tyrannical, but one must cross blades to know who is truly stronger.’

His heart was resolute, but his expression turned cold.

‘As for my brothers… the likes of Li Jiangxia and Li Jianglong are mere pawns for the north and south, ornaments on a king’s banner. They hold profound power but do nothing with it, merely waiting to be used in some grand calculation. Should the situation change, they will vanish like the morning dew. They are of no concern.’

---

Li Suining had waited in the hall for three days. At first, he was confident. But by the fourth day, with the main seat still empty, he began to grow anxious.

‘There shouldn’t have been any changes,’ he thought, a knot of doubt tightening in his chest. ‘I haven’t done anything, and there was no fluctuation of spiritual energy on the lake!’

It was no wonder he was so nervous. In his second life, he had exhausted himself, using every means at his disposal to elevate the Li clan’s strength far beyond its former glory, only for it to result in an even swifter annihilation. How could his heart not pound with dread? After waiting for another hour, he could bear it no longer and finally decided to enter the formation.

But just then, the faint sound of footsteps echoed from outside. A man entered the hall with a powerful, confident stride. Seeing Li Suining, a warm expression lit up his face.

“Elder Brother!”

Li Suining quickly returned the greeting.

“So, it’s you, Fourth Brother!”

The visitor was Li Suihuan. He looked at his brother eagerly, but seeing it was not the time for casual conversation, the eldest royal grandson spoke politely, 

“I have an urgent report. Daoist Master Nanwu has come to visit. Do you know where King Wei is?”

Guo Nanwu was by now a long-standing associate of the Li family. Not only did the two Daoist Masters know him, but even the core descendants were familiar with the Daoist Master who cultivated the arts of the Lesser Yang—and Li Suining was certainly no exception.

During the catastrophe on the lake in his second life, Guo Nanwu had already been at the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. While he hadn't been able to provide decisive aid in the end, he had played a significant role in the conflict between the north and south. Whether he managed to escape the final calamity was something Li Suining never saw.

What had left an even deeper impression on Li Suining, however, was another Daoist Master: Yin Juexi, a direct descendant of the Yin family and a successor of the Mount Qusi lineage.

Truthfully, though Li Suining was profoundly grateful to him, to this day he couldn't understand why that Daoist Master had traveled thousands of miles to throw himself into the fire, protecting their family at any cost.

‘This Daoist Master Nanwu… though his help was from a distance, he more than fulfilled his obligations to us. But why has he come to the lake at a time like this?’

Li Suining raised a hand and said tactfully,

“I paid my respects to King Wei a few days ago. He had some minor matters to attend to and asked me to wait here. He should return shortly.”

The golden-eyed youth nodded amiably, seemingly unsurprised that his second elder brother was always in attendance before a Daoist Master. He was about to speak when a brilliant light flared and then scattered. Joy filled his eyes, and he bowed deeply.

“Greetings, Great King!”

Li Zhouwei waved a hand dismissively, not bothering to ask the reason for his presence.

“Show our guest in.”

As he spoke, he turned to Li Suining and gave him an imperceptible nod. The signal sent a jolt of delight through Li Suining.

‘It’s good news, just as I’d hoped! They’ve concealed the signs of Daoist Master Changli’s breakthrough!’

Li Suining’s cultivation made him exceptionally sensitive to spiritual energy. Seeing that there had been no fluctuation whatsoever in the world or its energy throughout the entire process, he was filled with joy. He gave Li Zhouwei a deep, respectful bow and, taking the hint, withdrew with his younger clan brother.

A Daoist Master entered from outside the hall. His robes were immaculate, and his bearing was composed. Upon seeing Li Zhouwei, he immediately lowered his gaze and said respectfully,

“Greetings, King Wei.”

Li Zhouwei’s impression of him was favorable. He nodded politely.

“Daoist Master Nanwu, are you here looking for my granduncle?”

Guo Nanwu nodded, though he didn’t seem particularly enthusiastic.

“I’ve come to Ting Province to deliver something on behalf of another.”

He produced a pristine white jade vase, elegant and luminous, and a jade slip inscribed with dark patterns that gave it a somber feel. The Daoist Master lowered his eyes.

“Fellow Daoist Cang Tiaozi of the World’s Navel, at the request of Senior Zhaojing, has sent a vial of Water from the Xuanmiao Great Treasury's Spring of Rebirth and the Surrogate Body Ascension Art.”

The moment he finished speaking, a ray of heavenly light descended, solidifying before them into the form of a man in white-gold Daoist robes. With a smile, his gaze fell upon Guo Nanwu.

“We’ve troubled you, Nanwu.”

“It was nothing!”

Guo Nanwu replied quickly, his expression turning serious.

“The water from the Spring of Rebirth is stored within a Spiritual Artifact. Cang Tiaozi intended to deliver it to the lake himself, but when he performed a divination, the blocks shattered. He surmised that the mainland is a place where many golden-rank powers manifest their presence, so he dared not come and entrusted this junior with the task.”

Li Ximing wasn't sure if this was good news or bad. He shook his head with a wry laugh and accepted the items.

“You’ve come at just the right time. A few days later and you would have missed me.”

Guo Nanwu bowed, a hint of bitterness on his face.

“The Southern Sea has grown more turbulent in recent years. Although this junior possesses a few minor arts, I am not skilled in combat. I’ve managed to get by only by relying on the prestige of the Qusi clan, but it has been a harrowing experience.”

Li Ximing’s smile faded.

“Do you require my assistance?” he asked, his tone serious.

Guo Nanwu hastily shook his head.

“I wouldn’t dare trouble an immortal like yourself. The Qusi are capable of handling it. It’s just… I cannot stay long.”

Seeing his predicament, Li Ximing said at once, “Say no more.”

He had already set a date with Minghui. After cultivating in Xinyu for over half a year, his time was nearly up, and he had no intention of delaying. As he escorted Guo Nanwu out, his spiritual sense moved, engraving the mysteries of the Surrogate Body Ascension Art into his mind.

‘Surrogate body ascension… borrow a form for concealment, reflect the spirit within, evade disaster and calamity…’

As he absorbed the information, a tremor went through him, and his mind filled with astonishment.

This Surrogate Body Ascension Art was a method for using another body to evade disaster. More importantly, the art had no strict requirements for the vessel itself—it merely needed to be nurtured with a mouthful of this spiritual water. From that point on, the surrogate body would be utterly transformed.

He was secretly delighted. Seeing that he already possessed the few types of spiritual materials required by the art, he stored the technique away and turned to Li Zhouwei.

“I’m going to make a trip to Yinzhou first. If all goes smoothly, I’ll also return this Water Mansion bottle that holds the water from the Spring of Rebirth.”




# Chapter 1141: Greedy Snare of Profound Li

Li Ximing traveled across the sea for days, making haste. By the time the mountain teeming with demons—an overseas continent of devils—appeared before his eyes, he had already gained some insights into the Surrogate Body Ascension Art.

'This is a clever shortcut.'

He had examined the flask of Spring of Rebirth in his possession. Though precious and profound, it lacked the stability of an ordinary spiritual object. It was either a gift bestowed by a great power specifically for this technique, or it had emerged from a naturally formed treasured land, like the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew of the Nine Mounds. The Spring of Rebirth was simply far more noble. In the end, it was a path of expediency.

'As long as I can refine this Xuanmiao Great Treasury Spring of Rebirth into my Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, it will be imbued with the marvels of the Mysterious Valley, allowing it to resonate with the Surrogate Body Ascension Art and evade calamities.'

Though he had yet to master it, Li Ximing already understood its principles.

'This isn't like the alternate body's inherent ability to share damage. This can completely divert spells. At a critical moment, it can be a lifesaver, and it works even better when paired with a Valley Water divine ability or Spiritual Artifact… unless someone manages to shatter my Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body in a single blow, I can use the Surrogate Body Ascension Art indefinitely.'

Even if it were shattered, he could simply acquire another vial of the Xuanmiao Great Treasury Spring of Rebirth and start over. But having cultivated an external body for so many years, Li Ximing was self-aware enough to know that if a day came when his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was destroyed, he himself would be unlikely to survive.

Still, after reviewing it thoroughly, Li Ximing was extremely satisfied. He had a clear plan in his heart.

'Although the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire is mine to use, Minghuang risked life and limb to obtain it. Jiangqian's divine abilities are incredibly fast. One day, if he shows promise and reaches the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm before me, or even becomes a Great Daoist Master, the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire would be better suited for him.'

Given this, cultivating arts focused on evading disaster and nullifying spells had become Li Ximing's preferred choice. Obtaining the Surrogate Body Ascension Art bolstered his confidence.

'The art's description mentioned that nurturing it with several portions of the Spring of Rebirth can elevate the alternate body, cultivating a "Valley" within it for an even greater effect.'

Mulling this over, he landed on the demonic mountain, which, on the surface, appeared to be a paradise untouched by the mortal world. A disciple from the mountain led him to see Ping Yan.

This old, loyal servant of the Dragon-kin was bathed in demonic light, his cultivation having reached an extremely high level. Though he seemed to have just broken through to a new divine ability and was low on vital essence, his eyes were bright and full of confidence.

Li Ximing noticed the anomaly at a glance.

'What a formidable devil. He's actually cultivates Treasured Earth!'

Treasured Earth cultivators were rare; the only one he was familiar with in Jiangnan was Sumian. Li Ximing still remembered the demonic embryo in the man's possession. By his calculations, Sumian had either failed and perished, or had been reborn by now.

'That was a Qi Stone Demonic Embryo!'

When Li Ximing had his breakthrough, he hadn't understood how potent a Qi Stone Demonic Embryo was. Now, with his broadened horizons and his own external body, he knew it was a treasure of Manifestations Earth. In the Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, it was considered a superior-grade embryo for a Dharma Body!

'That Sumian really lucked out!'

He pushed the thought aside. A monk was already waiting beside the old devil. A pure light enveloped him, and his skin was as fine as a youth's, giving him the air of an enlightened master. He sat calmly at the table, his face heavy with contemplation.

'A Maha with a profound divine ability…'

Li Ximing clasped his hands together. Though suspicious, he spoke politely.

"And you are…?"

The monk rose and smiled.

"I am Mingmeng, senior brother to Minghui. He was gravely injured in the conflict between the north and south, and his Dharma Body has yet to recover. He dares not venture out, so I have come in his stead!"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He took a seat without ceremony and with a light wave of his hand, several golden artifacts materialized in a pile, covered by a worn kasaya that radiated a brilliant light.

Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing had achieved much in the past few years. While a large portion of the Enlightened Artifacts they had seized had not ended up in their hands, the pile here was still noteworthy, to say nothing of Vast Cicada's dazzling old kasaya. Mingmeng examined it carefully and sighed in admiration.

"King Wei's divine abilities are vast indeed!"

Li Ximing watched him take stock of the treasures and shook his head.

"The spiritual fire your junior brother traded us last time was a foul, miasmic mess! I'm still dealing with the fallout! It's truly tiresome. Spiritual resources are good, but spiritual objects are better. I only hope you have some cleaner goods on hand, fellow Daoist."

Minghui's offer had been generous, but Li Ximing had to press his advantage. The monk before him was unfazed and smiled.

"You speak the truth, Benefactor! This humble monk also came prepared."

He was seen taking a scroll from his sleeve. It rested on a cloth of gold silk, which he held carefully in his palm as he spoke in a low voice.

"My Lotus Temple has long been established in the central plains and possesses some heritage. Within this… is a technique from the old Wei palace. I trust you will be interested, fellow Daoist."

"This scroll is called the 'Scroll of Accomplishment and Fulfillment.' It is an old scroll that belonged to King Shouyi of the former Wei State."

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat. He scanned it with his spiritual sense, but his brow furrowed.

"What kind of technique is this? As far as I know, the Lotus Temple isn't that ancient, and the Way of Joyful Bliss was not among those who entered the capital during the Liang era… From its appearance, it lacks any sense of antiquity. It doesn't look like an original… more like a copy… You lack sincerity, fellow Daoist."

Mingmeng knew that a copied version was hardly convincing and even carried the suspicion of having key parts altered. If the sect hadn't given him this very item, he wouldn't have bothered presenting it. He sighed.

"There's something you may not know, fellow Daoist… In the past, during the Liang era's Immortal-Buddhist Debate, the Liang Emperor showed favoritism. The Immortals won by a margin of six victories, leaving all the Buddhist masters resentful. Later, Emperor Zhao fell, and Emperor Zhaoli welcomed the Seven Aspects of the Buddhist bone relic. The very next year, the Immortal-Buddhist Debate was held again…"

At these words, Li Ximing raised an eyebrow, a hint of disdain in his eyes.

"I assume the Buddhist cultivators won this time."

Mingmeng silently shook his head.

"It is shameful to admit, but the Immortal cultivators had already lost four consecutive matches, and no one else dared to take the stage. Who would have thought… who would have thought…"

He said awkwardly,

"Two more people appeared on the stage. They sat there, drinking wine with downcast eyes. I heard one was a direct disciple of the True Monarch of Mount Luoxia, named Wei Kan. The other was the former sect master of the Yue Cultivating Sect and also a direct disciple of a True Monarch, named Nian Hao…"

"And so, we didn't dare to win after that. The original of this item was lost to the prestigious Feng family at that time…"

Li Ximing frowned but reluctantly accepted this explanation. He took the scroll, looked at the glittering golden characters, and asked,

"What does it contain?"

Mingmeng, full of confidence, smiled.

"King Shouyi was the man who drove the Wei Emperor's chariot and wielded his blade. This 'Secret Art of Shouyi's Attainment' was a technique he developed by observing the Wei Emperor moving through army formations. It is a family treasure… I am sure King Wei… will have a use for it."

Li Ximing now understood where the monk's confidence came from. He frowned and remained silent, but Mingmeng continued softly.

"Even if King Wei cannot use it… this item is an heirloom of the Situ family… Who knows what use it might have? Situ Huo serves under the Great Song. I imagine he would be quite tempted by this."

At these words, Li Ximing's pupils widened slightly.

'Situ Huo? He's from King Shouyi's line? Him?'

Although Li Ximing had heard that the Situ family was once a great clan in Guanlong, the aristocratic families there had changed hands several times over the generations! He had never imagined that Situ Huo could be connected to the Wei Emperor. His shock was genuine, but he put on a smile.

"The man disowns his own kin. You expect him to acknowledge his ancestors?"

Mingmeng laughed heartily and clapped his hands in approval.

"Daoist Master must know that while these Enlightened Artifacts are valuable, not a single one is complete. Furthermore, our Enlightened Artifacts are not made with materials as precious as Spiritual Artifacts and can hardly compare to such an ancient secret art. I have come with the utmost sincerity. Firstly, I hope King Wei will look after the people of my Lotus Temple… Secondly… my purpose concerns that bronze basin in your possession, Daoist Master."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing's expression remained unchanged as he smiled.

"Although this bronze basin has traces of the Buddhist Dao, it is a Spiritual Artifact. It cannot be exchanged for a mere secret art or two."

A troubled look appeared on Mingmeng's face.

"You misunderstand, Daoist Master."

He said only this:

"This basin has a long history. Though its quality is not high, its origins are extraordinary. It is an item from the Dams-Goat Temple Palace, established by the Buddhists' Celestial Participant of the Dams!"

Li Ximing knew of the Dams-Goat Temple Palace. He also knew from Li Zhouwei that the figure known as Master Canyan to Immortal cultivators was the same person the Buddhists revered as the Celestial Participant of the Dams. A flicker of understanding crossed his mind.

'Canyan is the originator of the modern Buddhist tradition, which means this bronze basin… is indeed a Spiritual Artifact!'

As he pondered, Mingmeng said with a solemn expression,

"The founder of the Way of Emptiness was but an unknown figure under the Dams-Goat Daoist Tradition. This bronze basin was his Spiritual Artifact. Its quality may be poor, but it carries great karmic weight. Therefore… the Way of Emptiness covets it greatly!"

A thought flashed through Li Ximing's mind, and he asked suspiciously,

"You are truly kind-hearted, fellow Daoist!"

As he saw it, there was no reason for Mingmeng to tell him this. Wasn't he just making trouble for himself?

Hearing his words, Mingmeng shook his head.

"I have no intention of trading for this item, nor does the Way of Joyful Bliss wish to interfere in the matters between the Ways of Emptiness and Great Desire. I am only reminding you, Daoist Master… that the Way of Great Desire has already been working in secret to deceive you and trade for this item. Once it falls into their hands, it will surely create a formidable enemy for King Wei!"

Li Ximing's expression turned grave, and he fell silent.

'It seems… their people have already approached that master and disciple pair on Overlook Peak!'

He turned the monk's words over in his mind, finding that the logic and interests involved were sound. He recalled Cheng Qian's expression and didn't think he seemed like someone who would aid the enemy; it was more likely he had been kept in the dark as well. After a long silence, he finally spoke.

"Thank you for the warning!"

Unlike Minghui, Mingmeng did not possess such a heavy sycophantic streak. Seeing he had his answer, he nodded firmly, rose to his feet, and smiled slightly. With a surge of dharma power, the characters on the scroll became visible one by one. Li Ximing scanned them from top to bottom, reading through the text once. It was exceedingly obscure. He frowned and looked at Mingmeng.

The monk pressed his palms together, his voice sincere and trustworthy.

"When it comes to the Bright Yang, who can surpass King Wei? Trying to pull a fast one here would be suicide for this humble monk."

Li Ximing nodded, listening as the monk continued,

"My senior brother was ordered by Mount Dayang to guard the riverbank. My apologies for the repeated disturbances! This humble monk has urgent matters to attend to, so I will take my leave!"

He departed crisply. Li Ximing put away the items and considered the matter carefully. He hid the bronze basin and gradually formed a plan.

'This settles it… After I finish refining those few batches of pills, I'll deliver them to the two of them. Then I should enter seclusion and focus on my spell arts.'

Just as he was preparing to leave the mountain, he found that devil, Ping Yan, waiting for him before the hall. He was smiling as he looked at Li Ximing and said in a low voice,

"Daoist Master… His Majesty has concluded his affairs and has a message for you to deliver to King Wei!"

Li Ximing instantly grew vigilant, but his face remained polite as he nodded.

"May I ask which royal highness?"

"From the White Dragon Shrine, Dragon King Beihai."

"Please speak!"

The old devil gave him a heavy look and said,

"King Wei once replied to the Dragon King that since Great Ancestor Wei was harmed by Luoxia, the Dragon-kin, as millennium-old allies, should be able to distinguish right from wrong. Now that King Wei has reached the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, he should honor his old promise."

Li Ximing stared straight at him, a bitter taste forming in his mouth. He asked,

"What does the Dragon King mean by this?"

Ping Yan bowed.

"When King Wei's forces reach the Ji River, the Dragon King will come personally to discuss this matter with him. We hope King Wei remembers that while the Dragon-kin have not intervened in the conflict between north and south, we—have expectations of him."

The Daoist Master in the white and gold robes stared for a long time before saying in a deep voice,

"I will deliver the message."

…

Moongaze Lake.

A gentle breeze drifted over the lake. The sound of hurried footsteps echoed everywhere, and plumes of pale white smoke swirled between the grand halls. Li Jiangzong rushed down the steps, picking up a jade tablet once more to ask,

"Have the orders been passed down? Are the lamps in every location lit?"

The youth before him had a powerful build, and his golden eyes were brilliant, radiating a majesty that was at once soft and commanding. He nodded.

"Uncle, there's no need to worry. I have already asked everywhere."

But Li Jiangzong still appeared anxious.

"This ritual is the first time in a hundred years that all four lineages have gathered to honor the ancestral temple. Your great father gave the order himself. There can be no mistakes!"

How could Li Jiangzong not be anxious? He had managed the household for many years, and rituals had always been of the utmost importance. For Li Zhouwei to personally summon him and solemnly entrust this matter to him—this was a first!
He checked the reports from each hall one last time before letting out a long sigh of relief. He solemnly changed his robes, lit incense, and performed nine prostrations. Only then did he turn to Li Suihuan and say with great gravity,

"I'm leaving the island in your hands. I'm going to the inner sanctum to see King Wei. Wait for me to return with his decree!"

The youth simply nodded, as calm and steady as ever, which was reassuring. Li Jiangzong left the hall and hurried into the inner sanctum, only to find that the old man who usually stood guard at the entrance was gone.

This made him even more nervous. He walked to the front of the great hall, took a deep breath, and bowed.

"Junior Jiangzong requests an audience!"

"Creeak…"

The hall doors opened a crack, and the fragrance of candlelight wafted out. He vaguely saw a glimmer of gold light illuminating the towering flights of stairs. Countless lamps arranged throughout the hall were reflected in bronze mirrors, sparkling and brilliant, as if he had stepped into a realm of ten thousand golden suns.

"The rites are complete."

It was the old master's voice.

Li Xuanxuan had just been invited here and was sitting before the hall doors. After Li Jiangzong, who had come to report, departed, a torrent of Li Fire poured down. Only then did a youth with golden eyes and crimson robes materialize in the great hall, his expression grave.

Tears of excitement glistened in Li Xuanxuan's old eyes. He had been suspicious when he heard news of the ritual, and his heart had pounded with anticipation. Seeing him now, he was utterly satisfied, sighing with emotion.

'They've all made us proud… This "first ritual in a century with all four lineages gathered"… it was all for this good child's Azure Talisman!'

Though Ting Province's population had surpassed a million, an Azure Talisman was simply too precious. Neither Li Zhouwei nor Li Jiangqian had slacked in the slightest. They didn't even dare to go to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Under the pretext of the "Grand Centennial Ceremony of the Four Lineages," they had mobilized the entirety of Moongaze Lake.

As countless streams of invisible golden light drifted up and through the air, the black urn on the altar began to shake, faintly emitting cries for mercy. King Wei, standing to the side, showed no hesitation, his expression unflinching as he directly connected with the divine mystery!

"Om…"

An invisible color flashed past, and the cries for mercy abruptly ceased. Li Jiangqian, prostrating in the center, felt his ears ring as a sheet of white light seemed to explode before his eyes. A brilliant radiance surged into him. His Shengyang Acupoint felt intensely cool as the white light flooded in!

His divine ability, 'Great Parting Scripture', as if smelling some supremely attractive treasure of heaven and earth, began to stir frantically. His cultivation began to climb at a visible rate. Li Jiangqian had been waiting for this moment and immediately activated his spiritual sense to lock down the divine ability!

The divine ability was instantly trapped in place, but azure-mist-like dharma power continued to surge forward, condensing into a thick azure cloud beneath it. Li Jiangqian, however, felt a cold sweat break out all over his body.

When Li Zhouwei had condensed his azure cloud, he had done so under the condition that his divine ability was maxed out and could advance no further. But Li Jiangqian clearly had a divine ability that was as vacant as an empty pool, yet he prevented the azure cloud from flowing into it. The two forces clashed, creating a deadlock.

Li Zhouwei had been watching from the side. Seeing his face covered in cold sweat and his complexion changing, he was just about to intervene.

At that very moment, a cool sensation welled up. The Talisman Seed itself leaped out in the nick of time. The rolling azure cloud instantly condensed, transforming into a talisman that floated down!

Li Jiangqian let out a long sigh, the cold sweat vanishing. But he had no time to think. The dim darkness in his mind was torn open, and streaks of crimson appeared, outlined in crimson-gold, a dazzling display of colors!

Greedy Snare of Profound Li!

This talisman senses the Celestial Yang and seizes destiny. It inherits the Dao of heavenly separation and plunder, manifests the light of the Celestial Yang's universal radiance, elevates one's innate nature, and proclaims the radiance. Wherever life-mandate is sensed and connected, brilliance will be born, and the true essence will be seized!

Li Jiangqian felt his eyes grow heavy, as if flames were erupting within them. His vision went dark and then bright again, filled with infinite streams of Li-Light. He was speechless for a long time, unable to hold back a grunt!

That single exhalation was like a storm of Li Fire, extinguishing all the lamps in the great hall at once. Everything went dark, leaving only his open eyes, golden and crimson, shining with extreme brightness.

He raised his head, trembling slightly, and looked at his father.

"This Azure Talisman… it's a great Dao of sensing life-mandate and seizing the spirit of others!"

Li Zhouwei was slightly surprised. He shielded Li Xuanxuan behind him from the rolling Li Fire and listened as Li Jiangqian spoke with a trace of excitement.

"It contains the Dao of heavenly separation and plunder, and of the Celestial Yang's universal radiance. When I consume any Li Fire spiritual object, besides the nourishment it provides, it will also subtly increase my own life-mandate. This is what is meant by 'elevating one's innate nature'!"

"This Greedy Snare of Profound Li prioritizes the sensing of Li Fire life-mandate… It is a continuous source of perception, and it can also seize and devour the life-mandates of others. Although I can't make them my own, I can secretly use them to aid my own cultivation…"

His words caused the expressions of the two elders to change. But Li Jiangqian quickly changed the subject.

"And this Talisman Qi is endlessly mutable. It can serve as a reference for my own life-mandate perception! A foundation to rely upon for cultivating my life-mandate!"

"This means that if I cultivate a technique like the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method, not only will my cultivation speed be terrifyingly fast, but when I cast it… I will be sensing with double the life-mandate! And as long as I incorporate items into my three mansions, or even the fire mansion in my chest—a total of four mansions—they will all be within the perception of the Greedy Snare of Profound Li…"

He slowly raised his head, having an immediate realization.

"The most direct manifestation… will be in the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire, which is the result of the 'Great Parting Scripture' sensing life-mandate!"

He raised his hand again. The archaic, golden Li Fire began to swirl once more, but its radiance was several times more brilliant than before, blazing in the great hall and spreading an aura of destruction.

"Originally, this heart-fire sensed my own life-mandate. Now, it senses both mine and that of the Greedy Snare of Profound Li. Its power has already surged. In the future, with the spiritual fires I place in my four mansions, it will surely rise to another level! And as my skill in sensing life-mandate improves, these advantages will be magnified even further!"

Li Zhouwei listened, his eyes burning, clearly filled with ideas. He pondered for a moment, while Li Jiangqian considered.

"Some minor abilities for divining and manipulating fate will be helpful for calculations and avoiding schemes, quite useful in fights and other matters, but they aren't crucial… Elevating my innate nature is too extravagant to be worth mentioning. Just this heightened perception of life-mandate… is already an advantage that could not be greater!"

Li Zhouwei was silent for a long time, apparently thinking about something. He raised his eyebrows.

"Don't forget… you still have two Life Divine Abilities you haven't mastered!"

Li Jiangqian nodded happily. Li Zhouwei said in a deep voice,

"Life-mandate perception… Go and cultivate the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method immediately. Do not delay for a single moment!"

Li Jiangqian saw the look on his face and suppressed his joy. Li Zhouwei gave him a solemn warning.

"Before you make a move in the North-South conflict, you must raise your proficiency in the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method to a certain level! Only then can you explain why your Southern Brightness Heart-Fire is so powerful! It will prevent people from becoming needlessly suspicious…"

Li Jiangqian's expression changed slightly. His very life and safety were at stake. He immediately nodded, bowed, and without a moment's delay, vanished into the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

The great hall instantly dimmed, leaving only the toppled and shattered lamp stands, broken apart by the Li Fire. Li Zhouwei helped the old man up, only to see Li Xuanxuan standing speechless, looking somewhat shocked. He raised his head, his voice aged.

"I've watched for so many years, and I know the Talisman Qi of both seniors and juniors… It's often said they are related to one's character and fate…"

"This one… is the most venomous I have ever seen."

…

The Western Sea.

The seawater churned, its shimmering light ever-changing.

An expanse of Weak Water rose, swirling and shifting. Nestled within it was a small island, its waters glistening, its scenery beautiful.

Gloom Mountain, also known as Fenglin Isle, was an old haunt of the Weak Water demons. Located in the Abyss of Weak Water, it was now greatly weakened but still possessed some of its former glory. Even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator couldn't be certain of flying freely here.

Yet in this dark, bottomless place of the Underworld, a point of azure light burned brightly. A figure stood silently in the Great Void, a pair of placid jade-green eyes holding an icy chill.

'They refuse to come out, no matter what… It seems they really do have someone backing them. Quite perceptive.'

But there was no frustration in his gaze, only a dangerous resolve. The string of ink-jade beads in his hand rolled twice as he pondered.

'I've waited this long, and still no one has come to see me. The Way of Joyful Bliss has either abandoned them, or… they don't have the spare hands.'

The only one Chi Buzi was slightly wary of was that Jinlian.

'That fellow has been tempered through at least eight lifetimes and comes from an Immortal cultivator background. He is versed in both Immortal and Buddhist arts, one of the few truly capable ones… And his personality is bizarre. It's best not to get into a fight with him…'

His expression flickered for a moment. A rolling raincloud rose beneath his feet, lifting him up. A shifting light of clear and turbid azure swirled around his body as his gaze fell upon the great array enveloping the island.

Clear Dusk Rain.

Within the dark clouds, the faint sound of a treasured cauldron shifting could be heard. A rolling azure radiance immediately drifted down, growing more intense, soon covering the entire island. The light on the array flickered continuously, making a sizzling sound.

Seeing his blatant aggression, a commotion erupted within the great array. A torrent of divine abilities surged forth like converging waves of water, condensing and shifting, its light shimmering.

Dwelling in Winter's Depth!

The light of this Water Mansion was exceptionally strange. It surged upward and transformed, carrying a piercing cold and a towering killing intent. A vast domain manifested, dissipating the descending fine rain. An angry voice echoed faintly.

"Chi Buzi!"

"Your divine ability is powerful, beyond our reach. We will take a step back. Name any Water Mansion spiritual object or resource you desire! Why must you insist on taking the lives of my clansmen!"

The man in azure clothes showed no change in expression. He simply turned his hand over, revealing the string of ink-jade-like beads. Instantly, sheets of pure light transformed into goose-feather snow, mingling with the wind and rain, and came crashing down!

"Boom!"

The sky flickered between light and dark, but the snow grew thicker. The two divine abilities repeatedly clashed, but the light of the Water Mansion was forcefully pushed back into the array by the Pristine Water. The azure-clothed man strolled through the air as if in a garden, speaking coolly.

"Merging Dawn Abyss, Dwelling in Winter's Depth, you've brought out both… Your Fenglin Isle's Dao lineage is complete… surely you have more than just these two, right?"

He raised an eyebrow.

"I'd like to see Morning Cold Rain."

The Water Mansion below grew more agitated, but it couldn't stop the rolling azure rain from falling on the array. This continued for dozens of days. No matter how powerful the array was, large ripples eventually appeared.

Just then, a sound came from the Great Void. A monk stepped out, his expression grave. The yellow umbrella in his hand snapped open, floating up to block the streams of Pristine Water. He pressed his palms together and said in a deep voice,

"Show mercy, my lord!"

This shout was like a clap of thunder, stirring the murky Weak Water. It was Mingmeng, who had rushed to the scene!

The azure-robed Daoist Master raised an eyebrow and looked at him with a smile.

"Jinlian didn't come himself. I wonder what kind of trash he sent instead."

Mingmeng did not get angry. He clasped his hands together and said respectfully,

"I am Mingmeng of the Lotus Temple. I have come on my master's orders to resolve this karmic entanglement with you, Great Daoist Master."

Chi Buzi laughed.

"You Buddhist cultivators are amusing. When you yourselves are moved by greed to seize treasures, you call it 'karmic affinity' and attack without cause. Now that you are coveted by others, you know how to speak of 'resolving karma.' It seems you get to define what's good and bad in every situation."

His expression was casual as he spread his hands.

"The Water Mansion demon beast below has a karmic affinity with me. Since you all love fulfilling karmic destinies, you should just give it to me. I won't make things difficult for you. I only want the little one, not the old one… You can leave the old thing for your master to use as a mount!"

Chi Buzi had always been sharp-tongued. Hearing this, Mingmeng's face became unsightly.

"Mingmeng has come on orders and is willing to offer a measure of Cavern Essence."

The sky was silent. The only answer he received was the pounding rain.

Mingmeng's expression darkened. He gritted his teeth and raised his head.

"Two measures!"

Seeing the azure figure in the sky standing as if he hadn't heard, Mingmeng's face shifted between green and white. The light from his umbrella grew more intense as he said in a deep voice,

"Great Daoist Master, you had best think this through! The three of us stand with the protection of the array. It will not be broken so easily. My master has already completed his eighth lifetime. Great Daoist Master, do not push your luck!"

"Oh?"

The Pristine Water in the sky grew thicker, and Chi Buzi's gloomy voice drifted down.

"Do you take me for a castrated lineage like the Upper Rite? Or a weak position like the Cold Qi? Of the glories of Pristine Water, only Guo Shentong's Merging Fire can suppress it. Do you think you're Wei Xuanyin? How dare you speak to me like that…"

In a single thought, the verdant rain falling from the sky became terrifying. The umbrella in Mingmeng's hand emitted a sound as if it were on the verge of breaking. He was horrified.

'What terrifying Dao-Profundity… He passed the Purple Mystery stage far too early!'

It wasn't that Mingmeng had never heard of Chi Buzi's reputation. Jiangnan had produced a host of geniuses over the years, and while Chi Buzi's cultivation speed was frightening, it could only be ranked in the upper-middle among them…

But if one were to judge by aptitude for cultivating the Dao, based on the speed at which he passed the Purple Mystery stage… this man was definitely in the top three!

Once a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator passed the Purple Mystery stage, their divine abilities would surge, and their connection with heaven and earth would become more intimate, not to mention that Pristine Water had two Life Divine Abilities! Chi Buzi's Dao-Profundity now… was even more terrifying!

What horrified him even more was that this heavily falling Pristine Water… had taken on a different quality, one that was constantly dispelling the divine mysteries around his body, causing his protective light to shatter with a cracking sound…

'What is this? A divine ability? A spell art?'

Before he could think further, the bronze cauldron in the sky came crashing down!

"BOOM!"

The expected heavy blow never came. All the raindrops in the world froze in an instant. The rolling divine mysteries climbed and shattered in mid-air, dissolving into pure light. Chi Buzi finally straightened up, the smile on his face fading.

In the western sky, countless streams of brilliant light were rising. A path of gold, like a long flight of stairs, unfurled. Various wondrous pagodas could be seen everywhere. Rainbow-hued pools rippled with tranquil harmony. The scent of sandalwood rolled forth, pouring down like milk and spreading across the vast expanse of the sky.

A look of joy appeared in Mingmeng's eyes.

"Master!"

A monk stood upon the endless steps. He was of medium height with fair skin, simply draped in a translucent Zen robe. His face was holy as he stared quietly at Chi Buzi. Within his pupils, lotus flowers bloomed and folded, one after another.

'Eighth-Lifetime Maha, Jinlian!'

In the current world, once a Maha reached their ninth lifetime, they would almost always go to the Chandana Forest to prepare to become a Dharma Master and no longer walk the mortal world. An eighth lifetime—was practically the highest limit for a Maha to act in the human realm!

It was equivalent to a perfected divine ability!

The lotuses in his eyes bloomed and withered, revealing all sorts of illusions that traveled through the air, washing away all the rain in the world. In the next moment, they were about to fall upon the Great Daoist Master, but a thick, rolling light rose up, turbid as ink, and enveloped the man in azure.

Though they were clearly right before each other, it was as if they were separated by ten thousand miles. The dew and the brilliant light that filled the sky constantly collided, turning into a mix of azure and gold. Chi Buzi narrowed his eyes, and a strange thought suddenly occurred to him.

'What an infuriatingly punchable face. Strange… I've never met anyone so grating.'

All the colors converged and descended. Mingmeng felt no joy, only a bitter sigh as he stood silently in place, his face full of worry.

As expected, a holy chant rolled across the sky. A hint of pity appeared on the monk's sacred face, and his lips parted slightly.

"Chi Buzi… you orphan… Since you've made yourself a dog for the dragons, why don't you go lick their tails? What gives you the nerve to provoke your grandpa?"

'I knew it!'

The holy chant traveled across the sky. The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the array stood frozen. Mingmeng lowered his head in shame, not daring to look at the face of the jade-eyed devil.

'Revered One above… Your venerable self may have mastered Buddhist Shame, but we haven't… You… please show some restraint!'

Chi Buzi, who was always cool and detached, was stunned speechless for the first time. His pair of green eyes swept over the monk's holy face, and he shook his head.

"So this is how the Way of Joyful Bliss is cultivated."

He faintly sensed something and immediately had his Life Divine Ability sweep through his body, severing the connection of vital energy. He did not meet the man's gaze and instead said coolly,

"Jinlian, hand over the Profound Scale of the Sunken Manor, and I will not kill your disciples."

The sky was silent, but a faint tremor could be heard. The monk before him had already manifested a heaven-spanning Dharma Body. A face of joy and bliss stretched across the sky, its holy chant shaking the heavens, its brilliant light illuminating the Weak Water!

"Chi… you dog!"

Hearing this, Chi Buzi felt his insides churn, a burning heat rising. He narrowed his eyes, raised his hand, and grew ruthless!

'I'll see for myself what a stupid, depraved piece of trash like you is capable of!'




# Chapter 1142: Numinous Treasure

At the summit of Mount Qusi in the Southern Sea, wind and clouds churned. Flames shot skyward from a crimson dais, golden patterns swirling within the light. Beneath rows of heavy bronze lamps sat a massive furnace, and within it, suppressed flames roiled and surged, their overlapping hues shimmering with the seven colors of the rainbow.

Beside the furnace stood a Daoist Master in sky-blue robes, his face slightly pale. He had pushed his divine abilities to their absolute limit, straining to control the brilliance contained within the forge. But even with his full power, flames still licked out from the furnace from time to time, forcing him to turn his head away.

This was none other than Daoist Master Liaoluo, the master of Mount Qusi and a cultivator at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm.

And in the bronze hall above, a handsome man draped simply in a white robe leaned against the master's seat, sipping wine. His eyes swept casually over the furnace before he set down his golden cup and turned to look elsewhere.

A woman was prostrated on the floor, holding a jade talisman and awaiting his questions. But he remained silent. Instead, Daoist Master Diyan rose and produced a letter from thin air.

He gave it a gentle shake, unfolding it. A single glance was all it took for his expression to turn sharp and severe. He released his grip, letting the letter dissolve into wisps of smoke, and turned back.

His dark-gold eyes, like orbs of forged bronze, fixed upon the dancing flames in the furnace. He watched the weapon slowly taking shape within and spoke, his voice calm.

"Six full years… You've done well enough, but we did add the 'Six-Slaughter Imperial Dominion' to the mix. It's still too slow."

Those words made Daoist Master Liaoluo break out in a sweat, a flicker of guilt in his eyes. He was about to speak when the Great Daoist Master turned away, his gaze falling on a bronze sword hanging on the wall. He reached out and decisively gripped its hilt.

"Clang—"

A sliver of cold light, fluid as water, flashed out. The Great Daoist Master had already reversed the blade, resting its edge in his palm. His fingers tightened abruptly, his divine power surging. With a sound of grating metal, drops of dharma-blood, dark-gold and viscous as mercury, trickled down the hilt like a tiny stream, dripping onto the weapon in the furnace.

The sight made Daoist Master Liaoluo's face change. Kuang Yu glanced up, a hint of worry in her eyes, but Diyan’s expression was unreadable. His grip tightened further, and with a sharp crack, the sword shattered in his hand.

The stream of dark-gold blood finally ceased. The man casually tossed the sword's remains to the floor as if they were nothing, then took the jade talisman from the woman’s hands and turned to her with a smile.

"Quite a harvest, I take it."

Kuang Yu quickly answered, "I began cultivating the spell art five years ago, but my progress was slow. Only now is my qi flowing smoothly. I will select a day to enter seclusion."

Diyan’s brow lifted with a hint of pleasure. Five streams of divine power responded to his will, pouring into the furnace fire.

"The path I showed you was not mistaken," he said with a smile. "You failed several times, but this 'Severance Art of Parting Ways'—which governs the division of yin and yang and a sovereign’s mortal peril—is more than it appears. It is also a wondrous method for Holding Yang to Cross Yin, a technique of the Yin Master of the Central Palace… It is merely a pity that your cultivation level cannot overwhelm Li Ximing's. Otherwise, your gains would have been far greater."

Kuang Yu nodded but dared not interrupt him.

The vibrant colors in the furnace fire began to contract. With Diyan’s intervention, Daoist Master Liaoluo’s expression eased. He let out a breath and stepped aside, watching as the five-colored flames gradually coalesced.

"This disciple was incompetent," he said, his voice laced with shame. "To have troubled your celestial presence…"

Diyan shook his head, his five divine abilities blazing like great suns in the sky, suppressing the furnace.

"Your cultivation is in Converging Water," he said. "This task could not have been finished by you. In the end, I had to act."

"As for this blood…"

He smiled faintly.

"My divine abilities are perfected, my nature prepared for the Quest for Gold. I am like the dawn that awaits the sun, the bird that hastens the day. This blood is like a spiritual substance. Sealing it within this weapon is an ancient method of Dawn Qi, a way to perfect the Bright Yang."

"His Highness has not yet passed the Purple Mystery stage. I will be staying here to cultivate anyway. I have time to slowly recover the vital energy I've lost."

Daoist Master Liaoluo sighed to himself and said no more. Time passed as the flames surged. After eighty-one days of tempering, Diyan struck the furnace lid with his palm. A brilliant golden light shot out and landed in his hand. The two beside him looked on, but all they could see was a hazy golden glow. Daoist Master Liaoluo, mesmerized, took a step forward.

"Such a divine weapon," he murmured. "I fear even an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator, one who achieved their realm through common divine abilities, would struggle to wield it."

Diyan examined the weapon for a moment, offered a word of praise, and said no more, a nostalgic look on his face.

Kuang Yu, however, was concerned about the dharma-blood her elder had used. Seeing that Diyan seemed unaffected, she bowed and took her leave.

"This junior will now enter seclusion."

She departed in good spirits. Seeing his junior martial sister finally cross a threshold that had held her back for years, Daoist Master Liaoluo also felt a sense of relief. He stood to offer his congratulations, but Diyan, still staring at the long halberd, asked,

"Has Shitang been pacified?"

Daoist Master Liaoluo quickly clasped his hands.

"The turmoil has all been settled. That Protector-General of Jinghai, Grand General of the South Liu Bai, has some skill. Aided by the light of True Qi, even the Great Konghai Temple couldn't take him down. This junior held back Thunder-Hearing Island while the Southern Songzhou Luoshe and Nanwu both took action. In the end, it was pacified."

"It's just that Liu Bai was wounded in the process."

After listening to Liaoluo, Diyan said,

"The oceanic threat had to be quelled. The northern cultivators joined forces, using a combination of opportune moments and manipulation to set up Shanji Prefecture to vex the Yang family. But the problem still needs to be solved. They dare to target the Yang family, but they don't dare to provoke the Underworld."

He gave a cold laugh as Liaoluo lowered his head.

"After all… the last person who provoked the Underworld perished, even with an immortal scripture in hand."

Diyan was noncommittal.

"The immortal scripture was never found. Even Mount Changhuai could only vent its frustrations by torturing Jiang Boqing. What was the use of looking? It only threw fate into chaos. You say Duanmu Kui fell, and you are not wrong. But did the Underworld truly win?"

Daoist Master Liaoluo shook his head, a hint of disbelief on his face, and remained silent for a long time. Diyan changed the subject.

"What was Nanwu's reply?"

Liaoluo paused for a moment before answering.

"Back then… without us, the formation array would never have been negotiated. He understands your intentions, Your Excellency, and has been quite proactive. In this disciple’s view, Nanwu… is a clever man. He understood the meaning behind my words."

Diyan’s expression remained unchanged. The mighty Great Daoist Master, long confined to this one place, took a step forward, his demeanor calm as he instructed,

"Have him deliver the halberd at once. There must be no delay."

Daoist Master Liaoluo immediately agreed and hurried away, leaving the Great Daoist Master standing alone in the grand hall. A hint of satisfaction touched his dark-gold features. He calmly put the jade talisman away, leaned back against the master's seat, and a cryptic smile graced his lips.

Xuanmiao Temple.

A forest breeze gusted through the mountains, causing the red candles inside the temple to flicker, their light wavering between bright and dim. High above, the portrait of the patriarch riding a donkey remained unmoved by the wind, his face a featureless blank.

Below, a Daoist stood quietly, clad simply in a robe. He held three sticks of incense, which he offered with great respect. A man at his side spoke in a low voice.

"My lord, the master from the Numinous Treasure Order has arrived… He should be coming down from the Qi region and is on his way here now."

Qi Lanyan looked up, bowed to the portrait of the patriarch Xu Xiang, and remarked,

"Since we are at Xuanmiao Temple, it is only fitting that someone from the Numinous Treasure Order should come."

The man lowered his gaze and said softly,

"With his arrival, this southern expedition will surely bear fruit…"

Qi Lanyan fell silent for a moment, then let out a breath of impatience. He was about to speak when another disciple reported from the side,

"Lord Touba has arrived!"

The Daoist master said no more. He watched as a Daoist Master in formal black robes approached, his eyes filled with killing intent. The newcomer was about to speak, but his gaze fell upon the True Monarch’s portrait above. He had no choice but to fold his sleeves and bow silently.

But the first Daoist master spoke, a smile on his face.

"So the Touba clan has learned to pay respects to a True Monarch of my Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition?"

Touba Ci looked up, unafraid.

"The 'True Monarch of Nurturing Life and Prosperous Treasures' guards Tongxuan Palace," he said flatly. "His Dao is all-encompassing, his traditions the most diverse. Is there any reason I cannot pay him respect? You, on the other hand, drove out the master of Xuanmiao Temple and took his place like a cuckoo in a sparrow's nest. You don’t think of the Comprehending Profoundity traditions, only of meddling in the affairs of the north and south. And now you raise its banner? Who doesn't know what kind of person you, Qi Lanyan, truly are?"

Touba Ci’s words were blunt, but Qi Lanyan showed no anger. He turned to face him.

"Although Sumian obtained the Dao lineage, he lacks the sect's esoteric mantras. Even if he learned the Dharma Arts, he is nothing but a charlatan. Establishing a sect in Jiangbei was part of the plan from the beginning…"

"Besides… he is inferior to Changxi, just as Qi Qiuxin is inferior to Kong Tingyun!"

He smiled.

"Your anger is useless now. You hesitated at Baixiang Valley and then sat back and watched outside the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain. And now, haven't you ended up in the same boat as me?"

Touba Ci did not refute him. He remained silent for a long time before finally saying,

"Since you summoned me to Xuanmiao, you must have a plan."

"Attack the Song."

Qi Lanyan turned, his eyes cold. Touba Ci was not surprised.

"Eight years have passed since that great battle. Vast Cicada died without a sound. His 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' was different from the Wei tradition, a testament to his Dao-Profundity. He was favored by the Fruition Attainment, so he must have progressed even further. This time, who will you send to stop him?"

"You fear him far too much."

Despite their myriad disagreements, both men were clear-headed when it came to their fundamental interests. Qi Lanyan let the matter drop. He bowed before the True Monarch's portrait and said quietly,

"Vast Cicada's death was meticulously planned by the Yang family. Otherwise, even with Li Zhouwei's heaven-defying abilities, how could he have outmaneuvered the master of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm? The 'Dawn Qi' has become a stable springboard for disrupting yin and yang. No matter how high his Dao-Profundity, he cannot avoid this path. Have Gongsun Bei take a Spiritual Treasure, and you join forces with Shilou Yingge. Even with Li Ximing and the others present, it will be enough to make him suffer a major setback."

"Three mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators?"

Touba Ci actually laughed.

"With Tangjin lost and Baiye Creek dividing east from west, there are only two fronts: one at Baiye and one at Shanji. You're using three cultivators to deal with Li Zhouwei. You might be able to suppress him, but are you abandoning Shanji?"

Qi Lanyan smiled but did not speak. Before he could, footsteps were heard outside the gate, and another Daoist appeared.

The man was tall and thin, with a crystalline white beard. He had the noble air of a green pine under a bright moon, utterly transcendent. He wore dark crimson robes and cradled a large gourd in his arms. Made of what looked like ceramic, it stretched from his waist to above his head. His mere presence made both men turn their heads.

But his eyes were not on them. He solemnly adjusted his robes, bowed to the portrait, and began to chant respectfully. After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, he finally dared to step forward and examine the portrait closely.

Qi Lanyan said, "Martial Uncle Wang, the original portrait was taken by Sumian. This one was painted by his successors in the temple."

The Daoist addressed as Martial Uncle Wang looked regretful.

"What a pity!" he sighed.

Touba Ci studied him for a moment, his expression changing slightly.

"Daoist Master, you are…"

The Daoist master smiled.

"This old Daoist's name is Ziya. I cultivate on Mount Deshan. My ancestors were from Guzhou Prefecture. We are not as noble as the Three Kings, nor as lofty as the Viewing Pavilion. We do not contend with the twelve families and four Dao lineages for worldly power, we merely serve the Numinous Treasure."

Although Touba Ci was a descendant of the Great Liang, the mention of "Guzhou Prefecture" startled him into silence. Wang Ziya stepped aside, and Qi Lanyan said,

"Baiye… I must trouble you, Martial Uncle."

Wang Ziya smiled faintly but did not reply. Qi Lanyan paused, then turned back to Touba Ci, his brow furrowed.

"Valley Water has an advantage against Bright Yang and would have been more suitable. Unfortunately, Murong Yan is an old bastard. I can only trouble the three of you… advance south from Baixiang Valley and crush those Wei descendants on the banks of the river!"

"I will lead the others and apply pressure at Shanji. Faced with Yang Ruiyi, those other fellows will have no choice but to go all out. Once you take Baiye, the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain will be isolated. The rest will fall into place."

This time, Touba Ci did not argue. He simply nodded, then rode the wind and departed. Seeing the barbarian leave, Wang Ziya shook his head.

"I have just emerged from a grotto-heaven to earn some favor. Don't make me offend people."

Qi Lanyan nodded repeatedly and saw him out with a smile. When he returned on the wind, the great hall was empty save for the disciple still standing there. His voice turned cold.

"He's still not out of seclusion?"

His tone was like ice, startling the disciple, who fell to his knees. Knowing he was referring to Fan Kang, he hastily replied,

"There has been no movement…"

"Go and call him out."

Qi Lanyan’s gaze was sharp, making the disciple jump to his feet and rush out towards the back mountain.

In the courtyard, the moonlight was like water, and a faint formation enveloped the immortal's cave. The disciple knocked urgently on the door, channeling his spiritual sense, and called out in a low voice, "My lord!"

Inside the dark cave, a Daoist in a white robe was sleeping fitfully on a couch. Hearing the faint sound, his pale, delicate face twisted in a grimace. He ground his teeth as if caught in a nightmare, then rolled over and fell to the floor.

"Ah!"

As if his soul had fled him, the Daoist scrambled to his feet and spat a mouthful of crimson blood onto the ground, which sizzled and corroded pits into the stone. He stood up dazedly, the chaotic sounds in his ears leaving him stunned and disoriented.

'This…'

He looked down at his own clean hands, his heart sinking into a dark pit of terror. The image of a gleaming halberd materialized before him, growing rapidly, making his legs tremble and leaving him speechless.

'The second life…'

A single halberd strike.

In his first life, he had managed to hold out until Wei Prefecture. But in his second life, his status and position were immeasurably higher… yet he, Fan Kang, had died a violent death when the central plains fell. That King Wei had hunted him down to Xuanmiao Temple, pursued him all the way to the Qi region, and, in front of the whole world, had smashed him to pieces with a single blow from his halberd!

Qi Lanyan, Yin Baiyue… they had all hidden in the Great Void, not daring to lift a finger to help!

Even now, awake, his mind was a stunned blank, followed by a thick wave of fear.

'It's changed… it's all changed… To fall so early, it means… I know nothing of what comes after…'

The calls from outside grew more urgent. He scrambled up from the floor in a panic, hastily wiped away the bloodstains, and stumbled out, his mind a blinding flash of white light.

'I must… I must escape him!'

He was completely awake now. Even if Jianghuai was lost, Qi Lanyan would not be in mortal danger, but he, Fan Kang, was different! If this ship couldn't protect him, it didn't matter how long it stayed afloat. If Fan Kang didn't save himself, death was certain!

At that moment, he could not think of gratitude or distinguish friend from foe. As long as that halberd did not strike him, he could ignore everything else!

'The Buddhist cultivators… perhaps… only the Buddhist cultivators!'

But Fan Kang knew it would not be easy.

He was currently Qi Lanyan's disciple. And who was Qi Lanyan? A direct disciple of the Viewing Pavilion, a man of esteemed status. Even if he were willing to join the Buddhists, no ordinary Maha would dare to accept him!

Not to mention the greater powers, even if Qi Lanyan didn't act, Wei Xuanyin would certainly step in to clean up the sect!

He made his way to the main hall in a state of terror, his expression now composed, his excuse prepared. He lifted his foot to enter, only to see a pair of eyes staring at him from within the hall's gloom.

"What happened?"

Fan Kang's face went white. He lowered his gaze.

"There was a problem with my cultivation. It injured my life-mandate…"

Qi Lanyan chuckled twice, his voice turning cold.

"Injured your life-mandate?"

Fear gripped Fan Kang's heart.

"Master… I…"

But the Daoist master raised a hand to silence him.

"Are you truly so afraid of me?" he asked quietly.

The light in the hall was dim, only the dark red candlelight flickered, casting shifting shadows across the Daoist Master’s face. Fan Kang trembled. But the man before him did not press the matter, instead asking in a low voice,

"Who did I send to attack Baiye?"

Fan Kang, kneeling on the floor, wracked his brain but could come up with no response.

"It was… It was Murong Yan and Shilou Yingge…" he stammered.

A smile immediately bloomed on that focused face. Qi Lanyan’s joy deepened. He turned and began to pace slowly around the hall, his thoughts becoming clearer.

'He truly can't divine it… The one who came down from the grotto-heaven on the lord's orders… the Heavenly Element of both north and south cannot calculate his presence… Since this Martial Uncle is willing to leave his mountain to help me…'

His gaze burned as he cast a subtle glance at the patriarch's portrait. The smile on his face deepened.

'This means that the matter with Vast Cicada had an effect. At least one True Monarch is displeased with Bright Yang losing control. They don't want Vast Cicada's fall and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm's withdrawal to allow Li Zhouwei to break through Jianghuai too early, to step into the central plains and throw the game board into chaos…'

'Regardless of who was behind Vast Cicada's death, it broke the rules. A little tit for tat… is not so shameful…'

The Daoist master's smile was inscrutable, but to the disciple kneeling on the floor, it was growing more terrifying.

'This didn't happen in my past life… He has a backup plan… He has aid from beyond the Heavenly Element…'

This plunged him deeper into despair. Because he had been killed so early by that King Wei, his knowledge of the future was already incomplete. Now, with this change, wasn't it like pouring oil on the fire?

Whether Qi Lanyan could gain an advantage was of no concern to him. He could only recall the days his master had spent in the Great Void, seething with anger but saying nothing. Fan Kang remained on the floor, unable to rise, a single thought consuming him.

'I must find a way out now! I cannot just sit here and wait for death. Even if Wei Xuanyin strikes me down… at least there's a chance for a wisp of my True Spirit to escape. That's better than being shattered by a halberd!'

---

Moongaze Lake.

The rain over the lake grew heavier, threatening a downpour. It pattered onto the undulating surface. In the center, a man stroked a green gourd, a worried look on his face.

"I must ask you to wait a moment, Daoist Master…"

Li Jiangzong stood respectfully by his side. Sima Yuanli nodded. He was about to ask another question when his expression suddenly turned serious. The sky lit up with color, the rain clouds dispersed, and a tall man in a black robe with gold trim descended from the air.

'His divine ability and Dao-Profundity… have grown again!'

Those terrifying golden eyes burned, carrying a hint of Li Fire. As they fell upon him, Sima Yuanli's heart skipped a beat.

'King Wei is here…'

Five years had passed in the blink of an eye, a rare period of extended peace. Li Jiangqian had naturally remained hidden in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, while Li Zhouwei had been in seclusion in the island, refining his Dharma Arts and studying Daoist texts.

And the text in question was the Scroll of Accomplishment and Fulfillment, brought back by Li Ximing.

When Li Ximing had gone to Qusi, he heard that the Yin family, to which Diyan belonged as King Zhaoming, once possessed a Radiant Golden Convergence Method, an immortal scripture on the art of seeking the Dao. Li Ximing suspected that the Sima family's Scroll of Accomplishment and Fulfillment, held by King Shouyi of the Situ family, might be this very secret.

But he couldn't discern its true nature. When the scroll fell into Li Zhouwei's hands, he managed to uncover some of its secrets.

'While it's not a method for seeking the Dao, it's still a fine treasure.'

The text recorded the visualization techniques of the Wei Emperor's conquests, likely intended for Bright Yang cultivators to use during breakthroughs. It probably also contained many secret methods. According to Li Zhouwei's observations, the original scroll must have had profound diagrams to accompany it; only by combining the two could one truly understand its mysteries.

'Few of the Wei Emperor's Dao lineages remain in the world. If I could obtain the original scroll from the Feng family, the benefits would be immense!'

After studying it intensely for half a year, he put it away, spending no more time on it. He emerged from seclusion not only because Sima Yuanli had requested an audience, but also because the eight years Li Suining had spoken of had passed.

He had just finished studying the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method, and a fire still lingered in his chest. His gaze swept over Daoist Master Qinghu, noting his weak aura and desolate expression.

"The Daoist Master has been busy with imperial affairs," he said. "You've grown thin. How have things been lately?"

The green-robed Daoist Master was silent for a moment.

Sima Yuanli had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm long ago. The Upright Wood lineage he held was not as demanding of Dao-Profundity as Purple Qi, nor as complex as Xiukui. He even had detailed annotations from his predecessors. He had gained much from his studies and, with the luxurious supply of pills and spiritual items left by Daoist Master Yuanxiu, his refinement speed was extremely fast.

Yet, to this day, he had only one divine ability.

He dared not compare himself to Li Zhouwei, but he didn't think he was worse than Li Ximing. Yet, no matter how he cultivated, he couldn't elevate his immortal foundation. His most recent failure a few days ago had left him dejected. He simply cupped his hands.

"Reporting to King Wei, both Zhao and Shu have started border conflicts… Furthermore, it is said that Shilou Yingge and Touba Ci have traveled south alone and entered Xuanmiao Temple. Fortunately, the North's several probing attacks have all bypassed Profound Peak Gate… As for Western Shu, they have been fighting back and forth in Tongmo Prefecture, but have not disturbed Ting Province…"

The words seemed plain, but their weight was significant. Li Zhouwei frowned. 

"Traveled south alone?"

Sima Yuanli nodded, his expression complex.

"They should be under Qi Lanyan's command now. Things are different from how they were…"

Li Zhouwei knew what Shilou Yingge was capable of. Their battle in the grotto-heaven had been spectacular. If not for the interference of those two northern cultivators, escaping would not have been easy. Although his own divine abilities had greatly improved since then, if the enemy wanted to deal with him, they would surely send more than just Shilou Yingge.

"There was also a rather large-scale battle these past few years. General Liu was defending Shitang… against the Kongtong Sea… Several Purple Mansion cultivators considered whether to disturb King Wei, but fortunately, with the assistance of a few others… they managed to hold on."

Clearly, in the eight years since the conflict at Baixiang Valley, only Ting Province had been peaceful. The Song court was still going all out to pacify the Southern Sea and eliminate future troubles.

"The reason for disturbing King Wei this time is on the Grand General's orders."

He raised his eyebrows.

"Now that the nation's power is growing and the southeast is settled, Shanji Prefecture… the Grand General does not wish to wait any longer."

The words were decisive, but Li Zhouwei was not optimistic. He shook his head.

"Difficult."

The situation in both the north and south was clear. This single word hit right at Daoist Master Qinghu’s hesitation. He sighed and fell into thoughtful silence.

The Great Song's strength had grown considerably since its founding, one could even call it a leap forward. But the pressure from the northern cultivators and Buddhists was no small matter. There were four named mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators, all either immortal descendants or of imperial lineage.

And what worried Li Zhouwei the most was Qi Lanyan himself.

Qi Lanyan's schemes were not particularly brilliant, but he was ultimately a great cultivator from Comprehending Profoundity. Both his techniques and the treasures he wielded were first-class.

'Especially the treasures in his possession, they have some notable origins. Against him, Yang Ruiyi's advantage will be greatly diminished. The old method of suppressing people with Exiled Qi will likely be ineffective…'

'And besides that, Western Shu is watching like a tiger from the side.'

He only mentioned this one point and said no more. Just then, a streak of condensed, illusory color shot through the air and bowed before him. 

"Greetings, King Wei! Congratulations, King Wei!"

"Daoist friend Nanwu."

With Shitang pacified, Guo Nanwu, who had contributed to the Great Song's effort, had clearly profited. His spirits were high. He smiled and returned the bow.

"King Wei! The weapon is finished!"

At these words, a rare look of joy appeared in Li Zhouwei's eyes.

"Oh?"

Guo Nanwu took a halo of light, like a Golden Core, from his sleeve. It shone brightly in his hand. Before he could speak, the weapon saw Li Zhouwei and flew towards him like a young swallow returning to its nest. It landed in his hand, extending and transforming to reveal its true form.

The weapon was twelve feet and eight inches long, its shaft adorned with scales and intricate patterns, and it felt as heavy as a mountain. The tail was like a spear tip, and the crescent-shaped blade had two edges, as large as a small table. Held in the Daoist Master’s hands, it looked like a magnificent ritual object.

As he turned it, the patterns on the halberd flickered in and out of view, their undulating lines reflecting shimmering light onto his face, illuminating it.

Guo Nanwu said with a smile,

"This is the Halberd of the Second Manifestation, the White-Forged Rekindled King, named Grand Ascension!"

Sima Yuanli's eyes burned with envy. Even King Wei himself looked on with a fiery gaze.

"A fine treasure," he said.

The king's halberd was as heavy as a mountain, yet it seemed light in his hands. He gripped it with four fingers, resting the shaft against his elbow, and with a sudden flick—

"Hwoosh—"

A torrent of Li Fire surged forth, causing the heavenly light on both sides to ripple and scatter across the rain-battered lake, creating a field of shattered gold. The lake water began to churn violently. The man laughed.

"Rise!"

The halberd shot upright and struck the empty air with a heavy thud. In an instant, the wind and rain vanished, the lake became calm, its surface as smooth as a mirror, reflecting only the blazing Li Fire and brilliant light.

The joy in Li Zhouwei's eyes had yet to fade. The reforged Grand Ascension was a pleasant surprise indeed.

The weapon was wondrous, comparable to a Spiritual Treasure. What was even rarer was its ancient aura, a sense of vibrant perfection. It pulsed gently in his palm, conveying a feeling of intimacy.

The Halberd of the Second Manifestation, the White-Forged Rekindled King had three wonders.

The first was 'Bright King', its innate nature, a transformation of the old 'Luminous Grasp'. As long as the halberd's master wielded it, they would be blessed by heavenly light. Each time they suppressed an enemy's weapon, they would gain one ray of light. Eighty-one rays would form the Bright King's Dharma Light, and the halberd would shine with infinite splendor.

The second was 'First Strike', a transformation of the old 'Attachment'. Li Zhouwei had used it for many years, and it was his most common technique. As his enemies grew stronger, the halberd's shadow clone could often only serve as a distraction. But now, with the 'Bright King' blessing, the shadow clone would be even faster than the main body.

This thought made Li Zhouwei's heart stir.

The improvement seemed minor, but the enhancement it brought was exponential. It meant that when a northern cultivator engaged him in close combat, their full-powered strike with a spiritual artifact would only hit the 'First Strike' clone, while the Grand Ascension itself would cut through the air, coordinating with his 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' to strike the opponent's true body.

'Murong Yan and the others might manage, but if I encounter someone who specializes in spell arts, they will surely suffer a great loss!'

These two wonders were not even the most fearsome. The weapon now also possessed a third, 'Binding Light', which held the power to command and imprison. This was an ability derived from the 'World's Radiance'. Though attached to the halberd and dissipating after a single strike, requiring time to charge, its power was undeniably domineering. Combined with 'First Strike', it was a fatal combination. Furthermore, the stronger the wielder's Bright Yang divine abilities, the stronger this wonder would become.

Although the Halberd of the Second Manifestation, the White-Forged Rekindled King did not have many wonders, each one was terrifying, and they complemented each other perfectly. After years of nurturing, it had undergone Foundation Establishment and entered the Purple Mansion Realm alongside him. It was connected to Li Zhouwei's heart and mind, a testament to Daoist Master Diyan's extraordinary skill.

'Compared to this, the Primal Summit on my person is much inferior! Even accounting for Bright Yang's preference for halberds, the difference in the two smiths' skills is clear!'

What was even more remarkable was that Li Zhouwei could faintly sense a trace of dawn light harmony within it, something that should be impossible in the current age. It was like a gentle light flowing over the weapon, subtly absorbing radiance.

'In this era where ancient Bright Yang Spiritual Treasures are rare… the value of this halberd is absolutely terrifying. Even if I searched the entire North… I would never find another weapon so perfectly suited for me!'

'To reach this level, it wasn't just his skill, but also the preciousness of the spiritual materials. The gains from Vast Cicada were substantial, but likely not enough… Diyan must have supplemented it himself.'

Li Zhouwei's eye was sharp. He saw it at a glance. His golden eyes swept softly over the halberd in his hand as he sighed inwardly.

'The Sinking Savage Aged Gold that my grand-uncle sent over… probably wasn't even enough to cover his costs…'

With a thought, the formidable weapon in his hand dissipated like light, transforming into a round, Golden Core-like point of light that hovered in his palm. Li Zhouwei closed his hand around it and stored it away in his Juque Palace.

Only then did he look up and say with praise,

"I've troubled you, Nanwu."

Guo Nanwu bowed and smiled.

"As soon as this item was born, I brought it to King Wei. There is also a Valley Water treasure that Senior Zhaojing asked Daoist Master Liaoluo to refine. He has been busy reforging King Wei's weapon lately and has not yet begun. It will take some more time."

"No matter."

Li Zhouwei nodded and watched him depart. Sima Yuanli, having waited for some time, was growing restless, wanting to speak but hesitating. Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow.

"Please."

The two of them rose on the wind and flew towards the Wilderness. Sima Yuanli found a moment to speak, his voice filled with worry.

"It's… a private matter…"

The man in the black robe stood in the Great Void, slowly turning to the side. He listened as Sima Yuanli hesitated.

"A few years ago… that Chi Buzi appeared in the Western Sea."

When it came to Chi Buzi, Sima Yuanli felt both resentment and fear. He spat out the three words through gritted teeth. The King Wei before him seemed interested.

"And?"

"To seize the Fenglin bloodline from the Way of Joyful Bliss at Horizon's End of Contemplation, Chi Buzi fought a great battle with the eighth-generation Maha, Jinlian. The fight shook the Weak Water into the sky and alarmed all cultivators. In the end, it came to nothing…"

There was a hint of regret in Sima Yuanli's tone.

"Even Jinlian could do nothing to him… In that case, the Way of Joyful Bliss will have to back down. After all, Chi Buzi can stand guard at Fenglin Isle every day… but Jinlian cannot. You can't guard against a thief for a thousand days. And as it happens, this Jinlian has some karmic ties to Fenglin Isle. In the end, he will likely have to swallow this bitter pill."

"That Chi Buzi… unless he is ninety-nine percent certain, he will not act."

Li Zhouwei's expression was unreadable. He nodded.

"Fenglin Isle? What is the connection?"

Sima Yuanli clasped his hands, gathering his thoughts.

"Fenglin Isle is where the Weak Water resides. This Jinlian… was also a cultivator from Fenglin Isle. During the late Qi dynasty, the floods were severe. Emperor Wu of Liang killed the master of Fenglin Isle, who was said to be an ancient Auxiliary Position holder of the Water Mansion… After Emperor Wu slew Dongfang Tianye, he had repeated disagreements with Dragon Monarch Beijia. As a result, the Liang dynasty rose with floods and fell with floods…"

'Water Mansion… seeking a mansion through the waters…'

He pondered for a moment and understood instantly.

'No wonder. The method for seeking gold through the Water Mansion is likely in the hands of the Immortal Mansion.'

As for this Jinlian, Li Zhouwei held no great fondness for him. Even though the monks of the Lotus Temple had always been polite, the Li family's distrust of Buddhist cultivators was etched into their very bones. Hearing that Chi Buzi had gained the upper hand was, to him, good news.

He remained silent for a long time. Sima Yuanli, however, looked up and stopped in the dark, grand hall.

"Please!" he said formally.

Li Zhouwei strode into the hall and saw Yang Ruiyi standing on a high platform in the gloom. The man's face lit up with a smile as he descended.

"King Wei has arrived!"

Years had passed, but Yang Ruiyi had not changed a bit. His robes were a somber dark color, tinged with a bit more of the Underworld's gloom compared to Li Zhouwei's black and gold attire. He held a golden scroll, and his brow was furrowed with worry.

"With King Wei's arrival, my heart is much more at ease!"

After a brief pleasantry, Li Zhouwei got straight to the point.

"What are the arrangements for the battle?"

Yang Ruiyi didn't waste time either.

"It is said that the North is mobilizing frequently. There will be a major battle soon. If Qi Lanyan is to make a move, his main force will surely head for Baiye. Protector-General Liu has already returned. I intend for him to defend Baijiang Creek, while you and I go to Shanji!"

Li Zhouwei could tell that the Grand General was not focused on defense. He frowned.

"The Buddhist cultivators will not give up Tangdao Mountain. One of us four must guard it. Now, with Situ Huo and I at Baiye, and you at Shanji, it's impossible for Cheng Qian and his disciple to hold Tangdao Mountain. With Shilou Yingge and Touba Ci there as well, trying to conquer Shanji will be a real struggle!"

Tangdao and Baiye were west and east, one in front, one behind, like two slanted barriers with Baijiang Creek as the buffer zone. Li Zhouwei's consistent advice had been to defend the two barriers and fight the northern cultivators in the Baijiang area. In retreat, they could be blocked by Ting Province; on the advance, they could cut off the retreat route at Baixiang.

But Yang Ruiyi's meaning was to let Tangdao go, to fight for the uncertain gains of Shanji… Li Zhouwei could not agree.

Yang Ruiyi was silent for a moment, then replied as expected,

"I understand the situation… The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain does not have to be defended at all costs."

Li Zhouwei frowned, feeling this was too aggressive. He looked up at him and noticed the same anxiety in Yang Ruiyi's eyes. The general began to pace.

"This is the eighteenth year of Martial Cultivation. Eighteen years! The Great Song has been established for eighteen years, yet we haven't even recovered Shanji, which is right on our doorstep!"

He gritted his teeth.

"The Great Konghai Temple in the Southern Sea has long coveted Shitang. Now that it's pacified, the matter of the North must be dealt with immediately."

Although he sounded agitated, Li Zhouwei sensed something else in his tone. He sighed inwardly.

'This is not his wish. It must be pressure from above…'

But if things went south in the North, Ting Province would bear the brunt. Li Zhouwei was silent for a moment.

"Even so, we must not be hasty. Tangdao, Baijiang, and Baiye are mutually dependent, especially the two mountains. If we lose one, the other will not hold, and we risk losing all the territory on the other side…"

"I understand."

There was a shadow in Yang Ruiyi's eyes.

"There must be a change in the North's strength. We cannot be careless. Let's test them first. You…"

Before he could finish, both men looked up sharply, their expressions changing simultaneously.

The northern sky was already thick with dark clouds. Surging divine abilities suddenly appeared, weaving through the churning clouds. The greyish-white clouds descended abruptly, revealing a massive and terrifying golden body.

Yang Ruiyi's face contorted with rage. He took a step forward and roared,

"How dare you!"

His voice boomed like thunder, shaking the heavens. Li Zhouwei's gaze turned cold. He was already in the sky, watching the northern clouds roil as countless streams of illusory color flew from the north, trailing ten thousand streaks of light.

The entire sky was stained a myriad of colors by the escape lights and divine abilities, a dazzling display of profound light.

The northern cultivators had made their move.

The situation seemed to have taken Yang Ruiyi by surprise. While he was still considering a probing attack, Qi Lanyan had already bared his fangs, his intentions laid bare for all to see.

Gazing at the colorful streams rolling in from the north, Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes.

'We're at a greater disadvantage.'

In a conflict between two sides, seizing the initiative was often key. The brilliance from the north shore was so intense, heading straight for Baiye. How could Yang Ruiyi sit back and watch?

Yang Ruiyi's expression grew taut. He closed his eyes for a moment as if communicating with someone, then turned to the King Wei beside him, his voice urgent and grave.

"I must ask King Wei to rush to Baiye. I will go to Shanji immediately!"

The golden-eyed young man nodded calmly. His eyes, full of concern, were fixed on the north, but he was secretly sizing up the Grand General before him, his thoughts uncertain. He then stepped into the Great Void and vanished.




# Chapter 1143: A Blade Astray, A Son Exchanged

A searing radiance filled the air, tinged with a crimson glow as rich as blood.

Within the pavilion, yin and yang qi churned ceaselessly around a man seated in cross-legged meditation. His lips were ruby-red, his teeth impossibly white. A storm of gray and white light swirled in his eyes, and his hands, resting on his knees, were clasped in a sacred lotus seal.

Li Ximing gazed at the figure before him, a flicker of satisfaction in his eyes.

This was his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

Having acquired water from the Xuanmiao Great Treasury's Spring of Rebirth, he had used the Surrogate Body Ascension Art to finally refine it into this vessel. The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was now astonishingly lifelike. Beyond the vibrant color of its lips and teeth, its complexion was brighter, making it nearly a perfect replica of Li Ximing himself.

He took a step forward and activated a spell art. The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body raised a hand, revealing fingers as flawless as jade. With a gentle pinch, the skin broke, and beads of crimson blood welled up.

'The Spring of Rebirth has entered its hundred bones, transforming into its flesh, bones, and marrow. It is complete.'

This meant that his external incarnation had finally moved beyond the realm of a mere clay statue, touching upon the ability to evade disaster and ward off evil.

He closed his eyes slightly and sat down in meditation to compose himself. The Light of the Six Harmonies rose like a brilliant, iridescent cloud, mingling with a thick Heavenly Light before pouring into the glabella of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body before him.

The statue trembled. Its nostrils flared slightly, and the color drained from its eyes, leaving them completely blank. It stood up and took two somewhat stiff steps, but its movements quickly became natural.

'It can be used for research, alchemy, meditation… And if I were to animate it with the unique companion-to-gods ability of my World's Radiance, I could even use it for battle. Fighting a Purple Mansion cultivator would be difficult, but it could probably handle a few Merciful Ones…'

Li Ximing tested its capabilities one by one, his eyes widening in amazement as he began to grasp its potential.

'This Spring of Rebirth is truly remarkable. It seems to have more than just the ability to evade disaster; it feels almost like a true, mobile body.'

In Li Ximing's view, the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was still fundamentally a clay statue, one that had merely been touched by the qualities of gilded refinement and disaster evasion. An ancient cultivator would have likely dismissed it as an unorthodox and impractical creation. But in the current era, when combined with the animating power of his World's Radiance, it was quite formidable.

'Although animating it with World's Radiance would consume the Light of the Six Harmonies from this divine ability, making it unworthy for use against mere Merciful Ones, and this alternate body is too precious to risk in battle… but time is on my side, is it not? With the Surrogate Body Ascension Art, there is still room for it to grow.'

'For now, using it to evade disaster and ward off evil is its proper path.'

With a flick of his wrist, the alternate body, a mirror image of himself, dissolved into light and drifted down, solidifying into a small statuette. It felt neither like wood nor porcelain, but glowed with a vibrant, exquisite beauty.

At that exact moment, two jade talismans—one large, one small—hanging from his waist flared with a simultaneous, scorching heat.

Li Zhouwei and Ting Province were both sending warnings!

Li Ximing froze for a bare instant, then his heart seized with alarm. He took a single step out of the pavilion door, his ears filling with the roar of flames. The man in crimson robes was startled awake at the same time, his expression grave as he looked immediately to Li Ximing.

Without a second thought, Li Ximing commanded,

"You're to exit the grotto-heaven and wait within the formation. I'll go out first."

Then, the sun and moon receded, and the light around him submerged. Daoist Master Zhaojing dissipated the aura around him, his figure materializing over the surface of the vast lake.

By now, the lake waters were a gloomy, dark expanse. Inky black clouds rolled in from the north, and the sky, once filled with esacpe lights, was now empty. The appearance of Li Ximing's Heavenly Light on the horizon was like a calming balm, instantly easing the oppressive atmosphere.

But Li Ximing's own expression grew more complicated.

On the northern horizon, a roiling barrier of Jade True brilliance blocked countless streaks of light. But pressing down against it was a torrent of Li Fire, a colossal waterfall of flame that stretched to the heavens. The two forces clashed violently. A jolt went through Li Ximing's heart.

"The northern cultivators are invading… Zhusheng is at the White River!"

Ever since the Great Song had taken control of most of Jianghuai, Moongaze Lake no longer had to face the northern conflicts directly. But if the northern cultivators had broken through to the White River, Li Ximing could not stand by and watch.

'Where is Minghuang? Where is Yang Ruiyi? If Zhusheng is at the White River, who is left to guard Tangdao?'

He didn't hesitate for a moment. He crossed his hands, gave a sharp twist, and snapped off his own index finger. Tossing it into his sleeve, he used Sealing the Life-Mandate. Only then did he ride the wind, soaring through the Great Void. As the dazzling Jade True light ahead grew brighter, he faced the oncoming dark clouds, took half a step forward, and while advancing, extended his spiritual sense to connect with the Immortal Mirror.

Spirit Probe!

The scene at the White River instantly became clear. The figure within the raging True Fire shone brightly. Dressed in golden robes, he sat calmly within a hexagonal pavilion formed from the True Fire itself, his fine beard dancing in the air, his eyes radiating a sharp brilliance.

'Shilou Yingge.'

The other stream of Jade True light, belonging to Liu Bai, was bright but wavered unstably. Fortunately, waves of Exiled Qi surged forth, and a great cauldron hung in the sky, neutralizing the various lights. This sight made Li Ximing's heart sink.

'But this Protector-General… his injuries haven't fully healed, have they…'

Liu Bai had been a meritorious official in the pacification of the Southern Sea, but he had paid a heavy price. The Yang clan had bestowed upon him many healing spiritual treasures, but Liu Bai did not possess the Sovereign's Perilous Tread. Moreover, the path of a Jade True cultivator was one of refinement and purity; recovery, no matter what, required time.

A sense of dread rose in Li Ximing's heart. But as the Spirit Probe continued, the scene within the Great Void unfolded before his eyes.

To the left stood a man with a sanctimonious air, wearing a tall crown and broad-sashed, flowing black robes. His eyes were closed, and he held a brightly lit halberd, its colors frozen and interwoven with Profound Yellow Qi. His other hand held a large, luminous seal, poised to strike.

To the right was a tall, powerfully built man with a ferocious expression and a face covered in scars. He gripped a heavy, blood-colored axe that looked as if it might drip blood at any moment. More fatally, in his other hand, he held a small, high platform, its colors deep and concentrated with a terrifying amount of Dawn Qi.

'Touba Ci and Gongsun Bei!'

'The Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform!'

A chill shot through Li Ximing's mind.

'Is this ambush for me? Or for Minghuang?!'

The Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform was a renowned Spiritual Treasure. Wielded by Gongsun Bei, with Touba Ci lying in wait—if he were to fall into their trap, Li Ximing would be utterly annihilated.

His heart went cold. The iridescent light at his feet slowed for a fraction of a second as a flicker of hesitation crossed his mind.

'This...'

But after that brief moment of indecision, Li Ximing’s heart calmed instantly. The Heavenly Light at his feet remained steady, continuing its course straight toward the Jade True radiance.

The situation on the battlefield was unknown. If he hadn't used Spirit Probe and had only known that two mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators were waiting in ambush with a Spiritual Treasure, he would never have dared to advance. But precisely because Spirit Probe had shown him everything so clearly, he now dared to proceed.

He rode the light forward, drawing ever closer. Before he had even entered the spiritual sense range of an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator, the lavishly dressed Daoist in the Great Void opened his eyes. A flash of Profound Yellow Qi appeared within them, his five fingers tightened around his halberd, and he turned his head to look.

This movement alerted Gongsun Bei. The iridescent light from the Spiritual Treasure in his hand flickered, and he whispered,

"Your Highness?"

Touba Ci observed for a moment, then narrowed his eyes and shook his head.

"Li Ximing."

The general considered this, then raised an eyebrow.

"Since it's not Li Zhouwei, perhaps we should wait a little longer."

Touba Ci's eyes reflected the unfolding scene. He didn't answer, but the Daoist Master in his vision had already halted, observing them in silence. This made the Liang descendant frown.

What neither of them expected was for the Jade True cultivator in the midst of the raging True Fire, who had appeared utterly focused and stern, to suddenly speak. His voice was like the chime of jade, crisp and clear,

"Is that Daoist Master Zhaojing? Do not come any closer!"

'Damn it!'

Gongsun Bei's expression changed drastically. A look of regret crossed his face, and his heart pounded. He had no time to ponder whether this was an ability of the Jade True divine ability, a sense from Martial Cultivation True Qi, or an effect of the jade wheel behind his opponent. He immediately raised the Spiritual Treasure.

But Touba Ci's halberd was faster.

The instant Liu Bai activated his divine ability, Touba Ci sensed it. The halberd slashed through the Great Void like lightning, unleashing a torrent of interwoven Profound Yellow Qi that surged across the void with murderous intent.

Before the iridescent light even reached him, a sense of crisis washed over Li Ximing. The Surrogate Body Ascension Art was constantly active, and its disaster-evading effect manifested, causing a numb heat to spread across his chest.

"Edict"

In a single thought, a wave of azure-yellow light rippled outward. Li Ximing's figure, blazing with Li Fire, shifted sideways by a single step, a ray of Supreme Yang Responding-to-Li light appearing in his palm.

Though there were two other Spiritual Treasures left with the Li family, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument had long been given to Li Jiangqian, and the other, the Heavenly Nurture Urn, was not a defensive artifact. He could only rely on this less-than-brilliant spell art to defend himself. Fortunately, with the foresight, his movement techniques were proficient. He took that step, riding the Li Fire, and narrowly dodged the halberd's light.

The torrent of Profound Yellow Qi slammed into a small hill, leveling it. The Daoist Master, already prepared, immediately rode his light south. He reacted with incredible speed; Gongsun Bei, who had intended to raise the Spiritual Treasure, was forced to give chase instead.

Touba Ci's expression shifted, his gaze turning cold.

"Gongsun Bei!"

Gongsun Bei glanced back abruptly, catching the warning in his eyes.

Li Ximing knew nothing of the northern cultivators' plans, but how much did the three of them know of the Great Song's arrangements? They only knew to come south to suppress Li Zhouwei, but upon entering the White River, they had run into Liu Bai. And now, Li Ximing had appeared out of nowhere.

Where was Li Zhouwei?

To chase or not to chase?

A shadow passed over Gongsun Bei's face, but he didn't ponder for long. His voice was low.

"His Highness's meaning is… to kill Liu Bai first? Can we even kill him? With that Exiled Qi Spiritual Treasure, it won't be easy."

Touba Ci shot him a cold glance and said,

"And you think you can finish him off just by chasing him?"

Gongsun Bei's gaze was heavy. He glanced toward the far side of the lake and said softly,

"Lord Qi's intention was… to force out those few Wei descendants. Now that Li Ximing has appeared, where is Li Zhouwei? Liu Bai is injured, and his Exiled Qi is a tough nut to crack—strong in defense but weak in offense. Shilou Yingge is enough to handle him. If we pursue Li Ximing with our full strength, Li Zhouwei will have no choice but to show himself."

Hearing him bring up Qi Lanyan, Touba Ci was clearly displeased. But Gongsun Bei was no longer willing to waste time. He was already riding the Dawn Qi in pursuit, his low voice carried by a divine ability,

'If Moongaze Lake remains peaceful and Li Zhouwei escapes, the three of us will surely be blamed! But if we attack Ting Province and he isn't there, we can still blame it on the Song court's arrangements!'

Gongsun Bei had spent years navigating between various powers and was adept at such schemes. Touba Ci was used to acting domineeringly and, when forced to submit, was unaccustomed to such intricate thinking. However, he understood a simpler truth—without Gongsun Bei, he was useless here alone.

He rose upon the Profound Qi, his expression dark, and muttered coldly,

'Qi Lanyan, that fool who doesn't know how to delegate. I'd like to see what kind of mess he can make of this!'

...

Baiye.

Clouds and mist rolled as the light of the four realms was refined. The grand formation in the mountains fluctuated ceaselessly under the pressure of various divine abilities. A golden radiance shone upon the earth, revealing massive golden bodies one after another.

In the center was a thousand-eyed, pink form, its light overlapping in wondrous ways. To its left was one with swirling patterns and floating clouds; to its right, one riding a fierce tiger and wielding a long staff. The multicolored lights shone on an old man's face, causing him to narrow his eyes slightly.

The two colossal figures to the left and right were terrifying, but they were merely Nuzi and a newly ascended Maha Bashan of the Way of Great Desire. Situ Huo paid them little mind. His gaze swept past their golden bodies to settle on the thousand-eyed golden statue behind them, and on the young monk in mortal form who stood before it.

"Zhelu, Mingxiang…"

These two—one a Liangli Maha, the other a disciple of the master of Lotus Temple—were the main force of the Buddhist cultivators attacking Baiye.

Even so, the sharpness and vigilance in Situ Huo's eyes were not intense.

'Something's not right…'

It wasn't that the enemy was too strong or too weak, but that their strength was…awkwardly positioned.

'Mingxiang's skills are decent, and Zhelu is a Liangli. Although he can't compare to those from the more prosperous Buddhist traditions, he still has their blessings, making him only slightly weaker than a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator… Even if they don't exert their full strength, together they are enough to threaten my life…'

'But I'm not the only one in Baiye. Tinglan is still by my side, and we have the protection of the grand formation… Yang Ruiyi would never fully trust me; someone must be on their way… How could they possibly take me down quickly?'

He, Situ Huo, possessed more than just the Blood-Omen Tower! He also had another Spiritual Treasure that had allowed him to escape perilous situations several times, the Monarch's Lost Sheep. Simply surrounding him with superior numbers would not give them an easy advantage.

He could only assume that Qi Lanyan's focus was not on Baiye. Feeling a mix of relief and a schadenfreude-like glee to watch the tigers fight from his mountain perch, he stepped into the air. The Blood-Omen Tower in his hand pulsed with a deep crimson light, as if drawn from the depths of hell, dyeing the sky a bloody scarlet.

Situ Huo's figure reappeared elsewhere, the long saber in his hand streaking across the sky, transforming into a gigantic blade of blood that descended upon Nuzi.

At the same time, a surging light of profound unity and white lightning erupted, stripping all other lights of their power and shattering the radiant light before the Maha, causing Nuzi's expression to change.

Double Destruction!

This was clearly the Maha's first encounter with Situ Huo. He had not expected his opponent to dare engage in close combat while heavily besieged. But as a trusted subordinate of the Peacock, his skills were not to be underestimated. He opened his great mouth and spat out a dusky-yellow Golden Land, filled with brewing illusions of infinite beauty.

Faced with the menacing blood blade, the dusky-yellow light shattered with a boom. An intensely rich brilliance burst forth, shaking the heavens and earth and forcing back all the bloody qi.

But the stalemate between brilliant light and blood qi did not last long. Tens of thousands of pink, illusory lights merged into one, forming a column of pink light that stretched from heaven to earth and suddenly slammed down.

"Boom!"

Zhelu was, after all, a Liangli of the Way of Emptiness. Though he wavered in the conflict between north and south, his abilities were considerable. The radiance from Situ Huo's slash with the Blood-Omen Tower was instantly pinned beneath the column of light, unable to move.

'A good chance!'

What followed was a dazzling treasure bracelet, a descending treasure sword, and a jade pestle like an emerald, each one having stored power for some time. The many golden bodies had attacked in unison.

But in that brief instant, the man's figure blurred slightly, and the many spell arts and Enlightened Artifacts that had locked onto his aura all faltered.

"Boom!"

The numerous spell arts missed their mark, exploding in a thick cloud of brilliant light, but the old man was nowhere to be seen. Situ Huo reappeared in the distance, a wide smile on his face, and shouted,

"King Wei has arrived!"

These four words struck like a clap of heavenly thunder. Below, the many Merciful Ones coordinating their assault on the grand formation and the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion fell into disarray. A guilty look flashed across Zhelu’s face while Nuzi was visibly terrified. For a brief moment, all the resplendent light in the sky seemed to freeze, and there was even a brief, strange silence.

The golden figure did not appear. Nuzi, having just been attacked and then frightened, became enraged with humiliation and roared,

"Idiot! That Qilin can't even leave the lake!"

This shout, filled with confidence, instantly steadied the hearts of the many Merciful Ones. They let out a soaring Buddhist chant,

"Great Desire is Limitless!"

"First Gain, Then Lose!"

But then, the mountain-sized, thousand-eyed golden body suddenly shuddered and let out an earth-shattering roar. Nuzi's face, covered in golden script, abruptly froze. He snapped his head up.

A pair of golden eyes were reflected in the pupils of his golden body.

The sun, moon, and stars in the sky began to fade at an alarming speed. A vast darkness enveloped them, and a gigantic setting sun descended from the horizon, stripping the golden bodies of their radiance. A sandstorm of swirling dust and the glint of broken, blood-stained armor swept through, blowing the brilliant light away.




# Chapter 1144: The Bright Yang Assault

Maha Nuzi was by no means a low-ranking figure among his kind. His deep ties to the Peacock had saved his skin on several occasions, leaving him unscathed to this day.

And yet... his status and importance were nothing compared to Vast Cicada's in his prime. Even Nuzi's own master, Sparrow Carp Fish, had only been Vast Cicada's equal before purging his wicked roots.

So when a curtain of absolute, lightless black descended upon the sky, the terror in the Maha's heart was palpable. A frigid dread flooded his mind, and his Dharma Body trembled, unleashing streams of radiant light.

His first instinct was to defend against the Audience with the Celestial Gate.

'Killing me won't be nearly as troublesome as it was for Vast Cicada,' he thought. 'The moment the Audience with the Celestial Gate pins me down, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd will be coming for my throat!'

The thought flashed through his mind like lightning as the Enlightened Artifact in his hand—a jade vase—shot forth to intercept the streaking golden light.

Only then did a glint of gold emerge from the darkness. The royal halberd was like a sliver of Heavenly Light hidden in the night, thrusting forward with a blade of light so dense it had condensed into a solid white edge.

BOOM!

The jade vase was Nuzi’s new Treasured Artifact, designed specifically to suppress anything that got too close. It unleashed a cascading torrent of brilliance, a waterfall of light meant to overwhelm the Heavenly Light of the halberd.

But the long halberd erupted with power. A dense, pale-white Heavenly Light rippled out from its crescent blade. The light, like a lone beam in the night, touched the edge of the jade vase and spread with lightning speed, freezing the entire waterfall of brilliance—a cascade that resembled the heavenly rivers—in mid-air.

[Bindling Light]!

'He... what new technique has he acquired?!'

Radiant light erupted from Nuzi's entire body like a volley of a thousand arrows, meant to drive back any encroaching light. But the golden-eyed young man's gaze remained calm as faint golden scales materialized on his face.

Sovereign's Perilous Tread.

BOOM!

A massive, iridescent white light surged upward, rushing into the endless darkness of the sky. Just as it began to expand amidst a piercing scream, a torrential storm of black-gold light descended, slamming the white light back down onto the desert.

Amidst the earth-shattering crack, King Wei spun his halberd. His golden eyes flickered to the side, catching a flash of pink light soaring in from beyond the immediate battlefield. In that instant, the desert illusion vanished, and rows of golden figures reappeared between heaven and earth. Then came the furious roars.

"The Qilin is here!"

BOOM!

As the desert faded, Nuzi’s colossal golden form struggled back to its feet, still towering in the sky. But to the shock and fury of his brethren, his face was now a web of cracks. His form was rapidly fading, and his eyes, flickering between light and dark, were vacant and dazed.

"You despicable coward!"

Maha Nuzi couldn't muster a curse. He forced a brilliant light to shine from his eyes, barely maintaining the dignity of a Maha. In truth, his head was spinning, and he couldn't even process the strange looks from his brethren. He felt the Heavenly Light that had pierced his Dharma Body and his heart shook.

'Is... is he even human?'

He, Nuzi, wasn't the strongest of the Buddhist cultivators, but he was a Maha nonetheless... and yet he couldn't even block a single blow from this White Qilin! The wound itself wasn't severe, but it was an incredibly dangerous sign—Li Zhouwei had done this with just his halberd.

Nuzi's mind went blank with terror, but the expression on Zhelu, the thousand-eyed Maha, was even uglier. As a veteran Maha, his insight was far more discerning.

'Li Zhouwei's weapon has changed... It's not that useless spirit embryo anymore... it's an exceptional Spiritual Artifact, nearly on par with a Spiritual Treasure!'

In the next instant, the thousand-eyed Maha's gaze turned to ice. A thick cascade of golden energy poured down as Situ Huo appeared, his long blade razor-sharp and radiating boundless, ferocious power.

Zhelu, however, was not surprised.

Among all the cultivators present, he was the only sixth-life Maha, his divine abilities the most profound. He was also a Maha of the Liangli rank. Neither Li Zhouwei nor Situ Huo would ever allow him to act freely, so it was only natural that Situ Huo would be the one to face him.

'Li Zhouwei is a Bright Yang, after all...'

The 'Bright Yang' path disdains the weak and revels in overpowering the strong. While Li Zhouwei and Situ Huo possessed similar divine abilities, when it came to slaughtering these first and second-life Mahas, the White Qilin's speed was nothing short of terrifying.

The thousand-eyed Maha's expression was grim. He knew he should have intervened to stop Li Zhouwei and prevent further losses, yet he remained inwardly calm and made no move to act.

'I don't care what trump cards you have, Qi Lanyan... if anyone's going to get hurt, it'll be one of your people from the Way of Great Desire. As long as they're not killed outright, it doesn't matter...'

Zhelu remained unhurried, but terror seized Nuzi's heart. King Wei’s figure materialized before him once more, halberd leveled, its tip gleaming. The interplay of darkness and sunset across the king's face jolted the Maha to a terrible realization.

'That bastard Zhelu!'

BOOM!

Without hesitation, Nuzi erupted in a blaze of light, transforming into a sky-filling cascade of sand and wind as his figure vanished into the distance. At the same moment, another golden figure stepped forward, willfully meeting Li Zhouwei’s golden blade.

This new combatant was built like a bear, clad in resplendent golden armor that radiated a heavy, imposing aura. His four eyes, multicolored and seemingly forged from metal, watched intently. With two crossed clubs, he blocked the halberd's advance.

It was Maha Bashan.

Advancement among the Buddhist cultivators was all about patronage. Nuzi had once been Sparrow Carp Fish's "Merciful One," and Bashan, in turn, had been Nuzi's. Seats were limited in the Buddhist Land; there were countless cultivators like the Five-Eyed and Chiluo. Only those with connections could ascend the ranks.

Maha Bashan himself was a prodigy of the Buddhist path, born with immense strength. He was unskilled in spell arts, having spent untold ages tempering his Dharma Body. Now, as his golden clubs met the attack, their sheer force sent the royal halberd flying high into the air.

"Oh?"

A look of keen delight, like a hunter spotting his prey, crossed Li Zhouwei's face. The royal halberd in his hand became a blur, moving like the wind and casting light in all directions as it rained down blows. The Spiritual Artifact was incredibly heavy, each strike landing like a falling mountain, littering the golden body with sparks and dents.

Bashan had strength in excess but lacked agility. His Dharma Body shuddered under the assault, fine cracks spreading across its surface as he bitterly endured. Finally, he saw an opening. He thrust his twin clubs into the halberd's crescent blade, locking it in place. An explosion of Li Fire erupted, and the halberd's shaft bent under the strain.

But King Wei's smile only widened.

The halberd's radiance intensified to its absolute peak. All the ambient white light converged, transforming into brilliant white patterns that spread across the blade.

[Bright King]!

'If I had been using my full strength... would you have dared to keep taking my hits, letting me build up the light of my [Bright King]?'

The mirth in his golden eyes flickered for just a moment. The golden patterns on his face flashed as he tightened his two-handed grip on the shaft. With a surge of force, he rotated the moon-like crescent blade.

A grinding screech...

Bashan’s face fell. The power—both divine ability and raw strength—surging from the blade suddenly multiplied several times over. His golden body began to tremble, forced sideways at a slow but inexorable pace. The brilliant light of their struggle grew ever brighter until it burst like a collapsing dam. Maha Bashan’s expression twisted in alarm.

King Wei released one hand, holding the halberd with casual, single-handed ease.

Shock filled Maha Bashan's eyes as Li Zhouwei’s free hand reached for his waist and unfastened a battle-axe, its golden head gleaming brightly.

The ever-stoic Bashan finally lost his composure, his face paling in horror. His grip slackened for a fraction of a second, and with the force of a landslide, he was sent crashing to the ground at a terrifying speed.

CRASH!

A beam of light descended from the heavens, and Bashan’s mount—a ferocious tiger—stepped out of the void, revealing its true form. The ground shook as, with a surge of profound power, it lunged for King Wei's back.

'Excellent!'

Far from being angered, King Wei was delighted. He spun around, his uncanny golden eyes meeting the tiger’s. The sky drained of all color, replaced by an encroaching darkness from which a lone sunset bled. And then, the vast Celestial Gate descended from nothingness.

The Audience with the Celestial Gate!

'I've been waiting for you!'

A mournful cry shook the heavens. The magnificent Celestial Gate landed, and the Crimson Severing Arrowhead vanished like a fleeting dream. Li Zhouwei had already drifted forward, the profound power of his Sovereign's Perilous Tread neutralizing a volley of incoming attacks. He leveled his halberd once more, targeting Bashan as he struggled to his feet.

CLANG!

A light bloomed in the darkness. An intricately patterned, demon-quelling lotus, seemingly forged from dark gold, materialized to block the vicious halberd, erupting in a brilliant flash of shattering light upon impact.

[Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions]!

The appearance of this famed Enlightened Artifact—one Zhelu had spent nearly a century refining, the very same one that had once heavily wounded Daoist Master Zhu Gong's Dharma Body in a single blow—finally brought a momentary halt to the collapsing situation, forcing Li Zhouwei to pause.

But across the battlefield, the terrified Buddhist cultivators felt no trace of joy.

In just a few short exchanges, King Wei had torn through them like a tiger among sheep, his assault shaking the very earth. The Buddhists who had been maintaining the siege were thrown into chaos, afraid to advance and afraid to retreat. Even Zhelu, locked in combat with Situ Huo, felt his expression genuinely change for the first time.

Zhelu had been there when Vast Cicada fell. While Li Zhouwei’s battle-axe had been what drove him back, his true fear stemmed from the Dharma Master's miscalculation. Today, that weight on his heart felt even heavier.

'In terms of pure combat, Li Zhouwei's divine abilities are second to none in the entire Song Kingdom! Even Yang Ruiyi... would be at a disadvantage without resorting to his hidden aces.'

But in the next instant, that heaviness turned to shock.

The dark gold lotus bloomed in the sky, but it brought Bashan no comfort. The halberd that had struck the [Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions] dissolved like a reflection of the moon in water, only for the real weapon—now covered in swirling white patterns—to bypass the Enlightened Artifact and press against the throat of his Dharma Body!

CLANG!

As expected, Nuzi hadn't fled far. He unleashed a thick beam of golden light he had been gathering. King Wei simply flicked a hand, sending out a streak of his own light.

'The Pure Yang Bracelets!'

Bashan's vision filled with a dim, yellow haze, as if a dark light had exploded before him. A metallic ringing filled his ears. The lotus that had just saved him was gone.

The halberd plunged through as the battle-axe erupted with blinding light.

The new halberd, the [White-Forged Rekindled King], was the final piece of his assault, like adding wings to a tiger. From the restorative power of the Sovereign's Perilous Tread to his White Qilin Dharma Body, from the [First Strike] that could bypass Enlightened Artifacts to the imprisoning [Binding Light]—he had constructed a series of techniques that were incredibly costly to counter.

Anyone who couldn't overcome that threshold would have no choice but to take the blow.

The desperate radiance Bashan unleashed was like a dim ripple against the Sovereign's Perilous Tread; instead of helping, it seemed to weaken him. The imprisoning power surged once more, locking Nuzi's rescuing Treasured Vase in place. Dazzled by the lights, Bashan finally understood Nuzi's utter helplessness.

'He is the White Qilin, after all...'

Yet Li Zhouwei's golden eyes were bright and sharp, showing no trace of triumph. His attention wasn't even on the man before him.

'Still not going to show yourself?'

BOOM!

A shower of pink light descended. Zhelu, having forced his way through the golden energy, finally arrived, his expression hideous.

'Bashan and Nuzi can be wounded,' he thought grimly, 'but they cannot be sent back to the Buddhist Land after just a few exchanges!'

The Maha of the Liangli rank swept the area with his spiritual sense. Bashan’s brilliant golden body was now dim, covered in cracks, and his massive head was gone. The sunset colors in the sky had just begun to fade as the [Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions] tumbled down and vanished into the Great Void.

"Hm?"

Zhelu was slightly startled.

'That battle-axe... he didn't use it?'

His gaze darted over to King Wei. The battle-axe was already hooked back onto his robes. The king simply stood holding his halberd, frowning as he squinted into the Great Void.

The atmosphere between Li Zhouwei and Zhelu froze. Situ Huo, however, failed to notice. He had been fighting Zhelu for some time, and it was humiliating enough to be suppressed, but to allow Zhelu an opportunity to reinforce his allies was a disgrace. His expression hardened, his pupils turning an autumnal yellow as a powerful golden energy gathered in his hands. Zhelu’s expression turned grave.

Engraved Stone!

Streams of pale gold Metal Malice descended from the heavens, converging upon his long blade. The blade then shot across the sky with immense power, but its advance was met with laughter.

"A fine battle-axe indeed!"

The Great Void shimmered, and a doll-sized porcelain gourd popped out. With a quick spin, it absorbed all the golden energy from the sky. Only then did a white-bearded man in Daoist robes step out of the void. He paid no mind to Situ Huo or Zhelu, his entire focus on a piece of green stone he was juggling in his hands.

The green stone was scalding hot, forcing the Daoist to toss it from hand to hand like a hot potato. An axe-shaped mark on the stone glowed faintly before rapidly fading away.

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly.

'So you've finally shown yourself...'

For a moment, all was still. Zhelu didn't recognize the newcomer, but he knew this had to be Qi Lanyan's hidden ace. In an instant, every eye on his body glowed with a violet light, all of it directed at Li Zhouwei.

Situ Huo, who was closest to the Daoist, felt a chill run down his spine. He instantly grew wary, taking a step back. He pursed his lips and blew out a puff of golden dust, a vast divine ability that was accompanied by a sky full of autumn dew.

The Daoist ignored him completely, tossing the scorching green stone into his sleeve. Only when the golden energy was upon him did he speak.

"Absorb!"

The porcelain gourd spun once more. Without a moment's pause, it cleanly absorbed all the golden dust in the blink of an eye. Situ Huo stared as if he'd seen a ghost, sheer horror about to spill from his eyes.

'This is bad!'

He, Situ Huo, had cultivated the Metal Virtue for hundreds of years; his Dao-Profundity in this path was anything but weak. If the sky-spanning Metal Malice he had just summoned with his Body Divine Ability hadn't been powerful enough, then this mouthful of [Throne-Toppling Metal Malice] was something he had cultivated for many years. An unprepared cultivator, even one in the Purple Mansion Realm, would suffer greatly from a direct hit.

Having it neutralized wasn't what was frightening. What was frightening was that it hadn't even lasted for a single breath in the air, and his opponent had dealt with it so effortlessly.

For a moment, he was frozen, unsure how to react, as if plunged into an icy abyss. The Daoist, however, ignored him completely, casually stroking his beard as he smiled.

"This humble Daoist came down from my Grotto-Heaven and was just admiring this mountain here. I seem to have interrupted Your Highness's sport—my apologies, my apologies!"




# Chapter 1145: The Gap

The world roiled with wind and clouds. Myriad pink eyes flickered in and out of sight within the churning heavens, their profound patterns glowing brightly against a golden form that remained shrouded in darkness, exuding an aura of solemn dignity.

‘Zhelu.’

He knew this Maha. It was an old acquaintance. During the chaos in Anhuai Heaven years ago, Zhelu had contended with Jinlian and Vija for Tang Shecheng. He was also the very backer of Taixi who had sought to refine Li Xuanfeng.

Zhelu was a Maha Liangli of the Turbid Emptiness Dao. He should have been a top-tier figure among the Seven Aspects, but the Turbid Emptiness Dao was a shattered remnant, hollow within. He had only reached his sixth life through the support of others.

Even so, this Maha Liangli’s strength was approaching the late Purple Mansion Realm.

Facing the brilliant golden halberd, Zhelu remained utterly unperturbed. A bronze lotus bloomed before him, radiating infinite light as a thousand eyes flashed in unison.

Li Zhouwei withdrew his gaze from the mysterious daoist, his expression turning equally grave. Seizing the moment before his Bright King art dissipated, he swept his halberd up to point it at Zhelu, and a wave of pitch-black darkness stained the sky.

"Good…"

Confronted by Li Zhouwei's charge, Zhelu’s reaction was entirely different from the previous two Mahas. With a flicker of his thousand eyes, he closed a great hand around the bronze lotus. Instantly, heaven and earth trembled, clouds churned, and mountains of gold descended from the sky.

The Sovereign’s Perilous Tread technique was terrifying in a direct charge. Zhelu’s myriad disorienting lights, typically invincible, were useless now. But as a Maha Liangli of immense Dao-Profundity, he had no shortage of methods.

The mountains descended with a heavy, crushing weight. They did not target him, bind him, or suppress him; they simply fell, divine abilities crashing down like a relentless storm. Heavenly light clashed with the golden peaks, shattering the air all around. Zhelu then quelled his own ability and summoned a Buddhist Land.

"By my decree!"

From within the mists of the Buddhist Land, a five-colored radiance descended upon the golden mountains. The spell was instantly empowered, transforming completely. No matter how King Wei shattered the peaks, new ones grew back at a terrifying rate, a dense, ever-regenerating barrier that consumed the space before him.

Li Zhouwei frowned, getting his first true taste of this Turbid Emptiness Liangli’s power.

But his opponent was wary of the Sovereign’s Perilous Tread and refused to interfere with his charge. Unrestrained, Li Zhouwei merely shifted his golden eyes. The Crimson Severing Arrowhead vanished from the sky. The young man burst free from the mountain range, his white blade flashing as it closed in on the golden form’s eyes.

The thousand-eyed Maha showed no fear nor haste. He pressed his palms together, a faint smile on his lips. The Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions, which had been waiting before him, suddenly flipped over and descended to envelop its target.

This lotus was a treasure Zhelu had nurtured for many years. Now, brimming with accumulated power, it erupted into a three-colored lotus fire. Capitalizing on Li Zhouwei's broken charge, the flames slammed into him, burning fiercely and exploding in a brilliant flash of light.

A vast, disorienting sea of esoteric power flooded his Shengyang Acupoint, rooting him to the spot.

The thousand-eyed golden form before King Wei dispersed like the wind, rematerializing in the distance as a slender monk. His face, however, was covered in so many eyes that any trace of handsome refinement was utterly destroyed. He gave a strange little lift to his Zen robes and smiled.

"Please, King Wei, enjoy it at your leisure."

As his voice faded, not only did the main body of the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions charge forward, but the golden mountains he had summoned earlier shifted their target and began to fall once more.

Yet, amid the swirling lights and flames, King Wei's eyes snapped open. Dense Qilin patterns converged across his body, his ink-black robes transforming into battle armor. The roiling flames slid from his form like common water, completely harmless. His halberd flared.

Binding Light!

The bronze lotus had not only failed to restrain him, but it had been imprisoned in turn. The vicious light of the halberd expanded rapidly. King Wei’s gaze was glacial as he brought two fingers together and held them vertically before his lips.

"Boom!"

A sky-swallowing darkness swept in, and a single point of fire bloomed at his fingertips.

The flame was a brilliant, clear gold, radiating a pure light devoid of any evil or strangeness. It was neither false nor real, neither yin nor yang. Though only the size of a soybean, it pulsed with the condensed might of a life-mandate brought to its absolute peak.

It was the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare!

The monk's expression froze. The Great Void around him trembled as Li-Light erupted from all directions—above, below, left, and right. Golden locks of light interlinked and converged, weaving a great net of chains that trapped him where he stood.

The net appeared impossibly fine, yet it seared billowing white smoke from his body, embedding itself in his flesh and scalding the densely packed eyes. He opened his mouth and let out a terrifying, inhuman howl.

"Aaaargh!"

Zhelu had refined a thousand-eyed body. He was a classic Buddhist cultivator of the Immortal Dao, one who had poured all his Dao-Profundity into his golden form. He had spent untold years on this bizarre Dharma Body; it was exceptionally precious, and he never allowed an enemy to get near it. He had never imagined he would face a technique so tyrannical that it could manifest from thin air.

Worse, an intense imprisoning force washed over his body, and his brilliant lights suddenly dimmed. The bright halberd charged forward. King Wei held it in one hand, his eyes shining like twin stars.

"Dong!"

A wave of searing heavenly light shot into the sky, exceptionally bright against the dark canopy of night. The distant setting sun seemed to tremble. Yet, Li Zhouwei felt no joy. His sharp gaze swept across the battlefield, meeting the smiling eyes of the Daoist, who was calmly putting away an azure stone.

The Daoist had made his move again.

The power of this last halberd strike had clearly been less than that of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. The Daoist held the azure stone with an unnerving stillness. A moment later, a desolate, distant roar echoed through the air.

"King Wei… I require aid!"

Li Zhouwei turned his head and saw the white-haired old man.

Situ Huo!

The mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator's face was ashen, his eyes glinting with a sinister light. His Dharma Body, which seemed forged from gold and stone, was covered in cracks. Three flags were embedded in his chest and abdomen, fluttering wildly in the wind and pulsing with waves of True Fire.

The cloud of dragons and serpents beneath the old man's feet was still present, but it now looked ragged and pathetic. He held his long saber aloft, struggling to parry a simple wooden sword.

The Daoist advanced with the leisure of a man strolling through his own garden. He came to a stop and sat cross-legged upon a horizontal gourd, a broad smile on his face as he formed a sword-finger sign. As his fingers slowly pressed down, Situ Huo was inexorably forced back by the wooden sword, retreating bit by bit toward the river.

The Daoist still seemed unsatisfied, a flicker of surprise on his face as he remarked,

"He has some skill, I'll give him that."

Li Zhouwei's expression turned grim.

Situ Huo wasn't gravely injured. In their brief exchange, Li Zhouwei had only managed to gain a slight advantage over his own opponent, hardly a suppression. Yet this Military Commissioner, this master of the broadsword, had already been pushed all the way back to the river's edge. One more step and he would be in Jiangnan.

‘This isn't a call for aid. He's lost the will to fight.’

While Li Zhouwei was locked in a fierce back-and-forth, Situ Huo felt as if he were fighting a ghost. The Metal Virtue spell arts he had cultivated for years were a complete joke before this cultivator. The man’s porcelain gourd had simply swept through them like a gale scattering the clouds, leaving nothing behind.

His renowned Blood-Omen Tower had fared even worse. No matter how many seas of blood, disorienting illusions, or malevolent blade-winds it conjured, no matter the sinister light or Metal Malice it unleashed, his opponent negated it all with a single divine ability. The attacks vanished as if brushed by a gentle spring breeze.

‘Hundreds of years… this is the first time anything like this has happened…’

He felt no discouragement, only a profound shock.

‘This spell is specifically designed to counter blood-based arts! It has to be from a Golden Core Dao lineage!’

Situ Huo had trump cards of his own, but the situation made it clear that every technique he had ever relied on was little more than child's play to this man. Only his Monarch's Lost Sheep artifact had any effect, and it was only enough to allow for a continuous, desperate retreat.

He was Situ Huo! He was an expert among those at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, a recipient of the light of Martial Cultivation! What kind of monster could toy with him like this? There was no anger in his heart, only a spreading chill that seized his lungs and made his spirit tremble.

‘There's something wrong with this Daoist… he mentioned a Grotto-Heaven… who is he? A direct descendant of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition? A direct disciple of a True Monarch?’

With that realization, only a single thought remained in Situ Huo’s mind.

‘Run… I have to run now! These direct descendants of the Three Profoundities can't be judged by common sense. Baiye is lost. If I'm too slow, my life is lost too!’

He wasn’t Situ Tang, and he certainly wasn't Duanmu Kui. Years ago, Kui Qi couldn't even defend himself against Wei Xuanyin for a short time, and Wei Xuanyin hadn't even trained in a Grotto-Heaven—he was from a mere mortal branch of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition!

His cry to Li Zhouwei wasn't a request for help. It was a declaration.

‘I, Situ Huo, am leaving now. You're on your own!’

Li Zhouwei understood perfectly. His expression grew heavy. He glanced down at the great array below, where thick purple qi was churning within the formation's light.

‘This is trouble. Without Situ Huo, it's no longer a question of defending Baiye. Lingering any longer is a death sentence!’

His gaze hardened. He made his decision in an instant. Stepping upon a trail of faint red light, he crossed the sky to intercept the Daoist. At the same time, his voice, empowered by a divine ability, shot into the array below.

"Retreat immediately!"

Zhelu, caught off guard by Li Zhouwei's previous attack, was seething. He wasn't about to let his target escape. But just as he moved to act, a kaleidoscope of colors exploded before his eyes. His mind grew fuzzy as infinite heavenly light spun before him.

The Pure Yang Bracelets!

The Spiritual Treasure had never failed. It pinned the Maha in place. The light of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead shifted, arcing gracefully through the air not toward Zhelu, but straight for the Daoist, buying precious time for the enormous purple pavilion that was now rising from the ground.

Seeing Li Zhouwei arrive on a path of light, the Daoist's smile faded. He frowned, clasped his hands together, and spoke, his head lowered.

"A reminder for King Wei, it would be unwise to linger here!"

His only answer was the flash of a bright halberd.

The Daoist smiled and shook his head. He raised two fingers and held them before him.

Guileful Desolate Plain!

In an instant, a grayish-yellow light enveloped them. The distance between the two combatants seemed to stretch impossibly, yet they also felt as if they were right next to each other. All color and power converged on the halberd's tip, only to be met by an object falling from the sky.

It was a jade Ruyi Scepter, the color of a yellowish-green autumn leaf.

The scepter struck the halberd with a force that made the muscles on Li Zhouwei's arm bulge and his Qilin patterns flare into view. The radiance and esoteric power of his attack instantly dimmed. He should have been stopped cold, but the charging momentum of the Sovereign’s Perilous Tread suddenly surged, and he broke through.

The sleeve of the Daoist’s gray robe billowed open.

The halberd felt as though it had been plunged into an endless mire. The two warriors' auras tangled in the air as their divine abilities clashed. Li Zhouwei's golden eyes shifted, his brow furrowed in concentration.

A wooden sword had already pierced the Great Void and was now reflected in his pupils.

The sword was crude, its hilt still bearing the untrimmed nubs of branches that glowed with a faint, tender-green iridescence. A familiar aura washed over him.

‘The Heavenly Nurture Urn… it's Protecting Wood…’

"Thud!"

Without a flicker of hesitation, Li Zhouwei's hand shot up and clamped down on the wooden sword. The Daoist's expression shifted, and his sword-finger sign paused. But the space between the young man's brows had already transformed into the omen of a solar eclipse. A vast desert manifested, and a black-gold radiance erupted forth.

"An art of the Yang Cusp…"

The Daoist's expression changed. His eyes took on the brilliant hue of sunset clouds. A seven-colored divine light gathered and surged out to meet the black-gold wave of Emperor Qi's Light.

"BOOM!"

The light in the sky shattered. The black-gold radiance dissolved like winter snow under a blazing sun. The majestic, seven-colored pillar of sunset light struck the golden figure, passed through it, and slammed into the earth like a falling comet.

An earth-shattering cloud of dust erupted. The purple pavilion had already soared high into the sky. A beam of cool, clear light pierced the dust cloud and shone upon the ground, tranquil and fragrant like the light of an immortal realm.

The Violet Arrangement!

The rolling, clear light, mingled with purple qi, settled the dust. The golden-eyed youth was gone, leaving only a trail of violet mist rising into the air. The Daoist paused, a flicker of surprise on his face.

He didn't seem to care that his prey had escaped. Instead, he remarked with admiration,

"The heritage of the True Dao Sect."

The mountain forest fell silent. All was peaceful. The assembled Buddhist cultivators kept their heads bowed, not daring to look at him. Even Zhelu, the Maha Liangli, was trembling with fear as he stared at the man.

The Daoist paid them no mind; it was as if they didn't exist. With a flick of his sleeve, he stepped into the Great Void and vanished.

For a moment, the golden forms of the Mahas shimmered. The Merciful Ones exchanged glances, and their strange gazes fell in unison upon the pale face of the immortal cultivator still trapped beneath the white light of the array.

"BOOM!"

---

Ting Province.

A shroud of Dawn Qi intertwined with the merciless, unifying light that bathed the island. A Daoist Master in white-gold robes stood silently, his face ashen. The flames beside him danced, threatening to burn a hole through the Great Void itself.

Opposite him stood a tall man in feathered robes. Strings of viscous, golden blood dripped from the tip of his long halberd. His eyes, a swirling mix of Profound Yellow Qi, watched his opponent quietly.

There was no great solemnity in his gaze, only casual observation. A flicker of wariness appeared only when his eyes swept over the burning Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire.

A rolling aura of Veiled Yin clung to Touba Ci's robes, effortlessly neutralizing the heavenly light that shone upon him and leaving a bitter taste in Li Ximing’s mouth.

‘Substituted Hindrance…’

Back in Baixiang Valley, Li Ximing had seen Li Zhouwei suppress this man with a single Audience with the Celestial Gate. He hadn't thought much of him then. Perhaps Li Zhouwei had killed Vast Cicada too quickly, or perhaps the northern cultivators were simply accustomed to holding back. At Baixiang, this man, like Changyun, had clearly not been fighting at full strength.

But after nearly seventy rounds of combat on the lake, Li Ximing was covered in wounds, and his heart was cold with dread.

‘The Profound Qi Dao lineage… it's terrifying.’

His opponent possessed the Substituted Hindrance divine ability. Though he cultivated Profound Qi, he could perceive Bright Yang and give birth to Veiled Yin. His mastery of the technique wasn't deep, but it was enough to neutralize the majority of Li Ximing's attacks.

And every strike of the man's halberd was brutally powerful, each more ferocious than the last, beating Li Ximing into a sorry state.

He shifted his gaze to the general standing high above with his hands clasped behind his back. His eyes darkened.

Gongsun Bei.

Truthfully, this man was an even greater threat than Touba Ci. His mastery over Dawn Qi was exquisite, and his combat prowess was formidable. Most lethally, Li Ximing knew he was still holding back a Dawn Qi Spiritual Treasure.

‘He's keeping it in reserve, waiting for Minghuang!’

If not for that Spiritual Treasure still gathering power, the support of the array, his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, and the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire that could force his opponents back, Li Ximing would already be dead. Even so, with every exchange, he sustained new injuries.

He appeared to be holding his own, but the effigy hidden in his sleeve was covered in cracks. After just seventy rounds, it was on the verge of shattering. Worse still was the great array beneath his feet, which flickered precariously under the constant assault, filling him with rage and frustration.

‘This Gongsun Bei… he doesn't even try to injure me with every attack. His attention isn't even fully on me—it's still on the island!’

Before he could think further, the descendant of Great Liang raised his hand again. An ornate azure jade vase descended from the heavens, spilling a cascade of clear, brilliant light.

As the light rained down, a great azure cauldron materialized in the air. The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron flew out and absorbed the radiance, but the divine ability hidden within was unleashed.

Plea to Supplant the Night!

A dim light fell, shearing away a huge portion of the Light of the Six Harmonies he projected. The Heavenly Yuwu spiritual fire immediately surged to fill the gap, lunging toward the general’s face with sinister venom.

Even Touba Ci had to retreat before this Merging Fire, let alone Gongsun Bei. Faced with it, even a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert had to withdraw his power and avoid it, unwilling to risk a Spiritual Artifact against the flames.

But this gave Li Ximing no respite. The halberd wreathed in demonic flames was already upon him.

"BOOM!"

He brought out a bronze basin to defend himself, but it looked frail before the halberd. Touba Ci’s demonic flames were at their absolute peak; it was not something a minor Spiritual Artifact could block. The basin was sent flying with a deafening crash.

The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light at the center of Li Ximing's brow flared, momentarily halting the halberd and erasing some of its demonic fire. But the weapon still fell, carving a massive gash across his waist and abdomen and engulfing half his body in flames.

He choked on a mouthful of blood, his face growing even paler.

The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body in his sleeve desperately worked to weaken the invading demonic qi. Li Ximing barely managed to retreat, but a chill shot through his mind as the Surrogate Body Ascension Art screamed a warning, forcing his head up.

From within the seemingly safe curtain of Merging Fire, a brilliant light suddenly plunged down.

Gongsun Bei had been forced back by the fire time and again, but he wouldn't be denied forever. He had been secretly accumulating power. A blast of extremely condensed Dawn Qi gushed down, and Li Ximing felt a profound sense of crisis.

But his expression remained unchanged. He thrust open his sleeve and revealed an urn.

The Heavenly Nurture Urn!

The moment the Spiritual Treasure appeared, its presence and power changed the battlefield. The urn's mouth was small, but it pulsed with an immense gravitational pull, a veritable Taotie’s maw. It not only swallowed the incoming divine ability and Dawn Qi with ease but turned the tables, attempting to disrupt Gongsun Bei’s own stability.

The general's expression changed. A suspicion in the back of his mind solidified into certainty.

‘I fear Li Zhouwei was never in seclusion on the lake to begin with!’

The events in the Western Sea were widely known; the Heavenly Nurture Urn was no longer a secret. But in Gongsun Bei's mind, all of the Li family's greatest treasures should have been with Li Zhouwei. If Li Ximing had it, it could only mean it had been left to him to defend the lake while Li Zhouwei himself was away.

The surprise on Gongsun Bei’s face lasted only a second. Years of war had made him ruthlessly decisive. In the next instant, a sheet of Dawn Light cut across the world without warning.

The Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform!

The instant the Heavenly Nurture Urn appeared, his entire strategy shifted in a flash of lightning from forcing Li Zhouwei’s hand to annihilating Li Ximing.

As the Dawn Light appeared, Li Ximing felt an unprecedented chill. Every fiber of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body in his sleeve shrieked a warning.

‘Mortal danger!’

Yet his face remained placid. He ignored the threat, even using his brilliant Merging Fire to force back the Profound Qi cultivator. He brought his hands together, and rolling talismans of intertwined crimson and gold began to coalesce in his palms like a newborn star.

"Hm?"

Gongsun Bei seemed to sense something and snapped his head up.

Just as the colossal Treasure Platform was about to crush everything, an intense blaze of Li Fire flooded the sky, overwhelming the clear light. Golden threads streamed from the Great Void, freezing the platform in midair.

And from within the crimson radiance, a Daoist Master clad in the crimson robes of Li Fire emerged, walking upon the flames. A bead like a Golden Core spun in his hand. Overlapping layers of golden light descended as an invisible qi enveloped the world.

Double Radiance!

The layered golden light shot forward. Though caught by surprise, Gongsun Bei's reaction was swift. A streak of azure-white light flashed across his robes as he moved to evade. But then the invisible qi descended upon him.

Swarm of Light!

The suppressive power of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument against other Dao paths slowed his movements for a critical instant. The brilliant golden light struck him. His vision went white, and he stumbled back two steps in disorientation.

"This is bad."

The general's expression changed. He fought to regain his balance, not even glancing at the newcomer. He turned his head sharply, desperately calling his jade vase back to protect him.

In the clouds, Li Ximing had already raised his head. Seizing the moment his foe was immobilized, an intense, pure gold light surged from his palms. It tore through the clouds, echoed through the Great Void, and arrived in an instant.

"BOOM!"

The sixth-grade Li Fire art: Great Parting's White Brilliance!

The art was incredibly costly and time-consuming to master, and cumbersome to cast. But it was backed by the grand Dao of Li Fire's ascendant position, a convergence of malign and auspicious forces. Its power was first-rate. Years ago, it had pierced straight through Vast Cicada’s magnificent Dharma Body. An ordinary immortal cultivator stood no chance.

Just then, a square seal flew through the air, shielding Gongsun Bei.

Touba Ci!

His eyes were sharp, and he clearly possessed some uncanny perceptive ability; he had been the first to detect Li Ximing when he had crossed the river to scout. He had made his move the instant before the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument appeared, which was the only reason he had arrived in time.

"BOOM!"

But it had been a desperate, hasty defense. The magnificent square seal held for but a single breath before it was shattered. The intense golden light flooded the sky, blasting Gongsun Bei out of the air. He crashed onto the distant lakeshore, kicking up a storm of clouds and Li Fire.

"What audacity…"

The man in the feathered, glowing robes didn't spare a single glance for the battered Gongsun Bei on the ground, nor for Li Ximing, who had unleashed the sky-spanning, breathtaking Li Fire art. His gaze was fixed dead ahead.

His face was glacial. He caught the searing hot seal in his left hand while his right raised the halberd, its demonic flames burning bright. He forced back the thick Li Fire radiating from the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and aimed its tip directly at the crimson-robed youth.

Touba Ci narrowed his eyes, finally getting a clear look at the newcomer's face.

The man had narrow, hooded eyes and a wicked cast to his features, tempered by a superficial gentleness that was both unnerving and unforgettable. A merciless smile played on his lips as he gazed at the halberd pointed at him.

That pair of golden eyes burned like red-hot coals, so bright they stung the eyes. It made the descendant of Great Liang, the Daoist Master of the Touba clan, freeze. An expression of utter disbelief bloomed in his eyes.

‘This is…’




# Chapter 1146: Lost Territory

'That must be the Qilin's heir.'

Touba Ci glanced at the man's face and felt a certainty settle in his heart. His grip on the long, demonic-flame-wreathed halberd tightened, a flicker of shock and horror crossing his eyes.

'He's already in the Purple Mansion Realm...'

As one of the most critical figures in the conflict between north and south, Li Zhouwei had shaken the world not just with his divine abilities, but with his terrifying cultivation speed. The man had already mastered three divine abilities and reached the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, yet he was barely over ninety years old!

Such speed was almost unheard of.

Touba Ci's own uncle, a proud descendant of the Great Liang and the current regent king, had been one hundred and twenty-two when he'd mastered his third divine ability. The now-famous Wei Xuanyin had been even slower, set back by the decline of his Veiled Yin. Even Jiang Yan of the prestigious Gao Pingwang clan, renowned in recent years for his rapid cultivation, had taken one hundred and ten years.

Even setting aside tales of reincarnation, few of the high masters on Mount Luoxia could claim to be faster. Touba Ci knew this for a fact—when the Liang fell, Wei Kan, the True Monarch's own direct disciple, had been ninety-six when he first descended from the mountain, and he too possessed only three divine abilities!

If Li Zhouwei was not yet a century old, how old could his heir possibly be? Seventy? Eighty? The pure blood of the Wei lineage flowed through his veins. While he couldn't be compared to the likes of Wei Kan or Yao Guanyi, his chances of one day touching upon the Purple Mystery were far from small!

He cast an incredulous glance at the young man's golden eyes, feeling the indescribable coldness that flowed within them.

'Give him time, and he'll be another Great Daoist Master!'

In the moment Touba Ci was stunned, Li Jiangqian had already clasped his hands together and slightly opened his eyes, his heart on high alert.

'Formidable...'

His Great Parting Scripture was amplified by his mastery of traversing the Great Void. From the instant he'd leaped from the lake to the moment the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument had unleashed its power, the interval had been infinitesimally short. Gongsun Bei had been utterly unable to mount an effective defense, yet Touba Ci had gone from detection to activating a Spiritual Artifact in the blink of an eye. It was inhuman!

Without a shred of hesitation, the Li Fire in the crimson-robed man's hand flared. The archaic, amber-like flame leaped from his pale palm, streaked across the sky, and lunged straight for Touba Ci!

The Northern Barbarian turned his gaze. Before Li Jiangqian's solemn eyes, the light of Veiled Yin swirling around his feathered robes suddenly transformed, becoming a churning, pale gray torrent of Pit Water that surged forward.

In that instant, water and fire collided in a burst of pearlescent white light. Touba Ci, who had just raised his halberd, froze and forcefully changed its trajectory to block the attack.

"Oh?"

To his astonishment, the flame burned straight through the wall of Pit Water and rushed him with unabated fury. It slammed viciously against his halberd, erupting in a sheet of fire.

Touba Ci's Dao-Profundity was considerable; he could naturally identify his opponent's Li Fire. But he could also see that Li Jiangqian's divine ability was faint, a clear sign of a recent breakthrough with little time to nurture it. His own Substituted Hindrance, on the other hand, was a divine ability of Profound Qi that he had cultivated for many years!

'Profound Qi is meant to suppress the weak, to transform into Pit Water and extinguish Li Fire. My Substituted Hindrance manifested that very Pit Water. The combined effect should have suppressed his Li Fire to a terrifying degree!'

Though the flame was not strong and quickly dissipated like smoke under the assault of the Profound Qi, it had managed to extinguish a small patch of the roiling demonic flames. Touba Ci's expression shifted as a realization struck him.

'Supreme Yang!'

Even as his mind raced, his hands moved without pause. The halberd lunged forward like a dragon, stirring the Profound Yellow Qi that filled the air as it shot toward its target!

Li Jiangqian’s eyebrows shot up. He pulled his hands back, conjuring a wave of rising Li-Light that resembled a thousand crimson clouds tinged with gold. It swirled within a hazy Li-mist before crashing down.

The Great Parting Scripture.

"Dong!"

A cacophony of shattering sounds erupted, like blades striking a cavern of porcelain. Faced with the churning Profound Qi, the Li Fire scattered and retreated. The crimson-robed man was forced back a step, summoning the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire to counter.

But just then, Touba Ci's lips moved. An ancient, time-worn incantation tumbled from them in overlapping layers. His eyes blinked once, turning a pure, profound yellow as he stared straight at Li Jiangqian.

Calamity of the Shrouded Sky!

Li Jiangqian felt a piercing shriek erupt in his ears, as if a chain of golden rings was being smashed right in front of his face. His vision bleached white!

The familiar coolness from his Shengyang Acupoint flooded his senses. His vision cleared after only a moment's darkness, but he found the dharma power in his body erupting into chaos. His smoothly circulating divine abilities were thrown into disarray, leaving him paralyzed.

The halberd was already upon him!

This divine ability of Profound Qi was so tyrannical that it sent shockwaves through his own arts. In the Great Void, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, which had been locking down the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform, flickered and dimmed.

Worse, the dust in the distance had settled, revealing an approaching expanse of greenish-white light. Gongsun Bei was riding it toward them!

The man had taken the full force of the Great Parting's White Brilliance. His face was deathly pale, and the perfectly circular hole in his chest pulsed with layers of Li Fire. The glow of Dawn Qi repeatedly tried to smother the flames, only to be scattered each time.

Even with Touba Ci's intervention and a moment to meditate and take medicine, his power had been slashed by a full thirty percent. But it was more than enough.

Despite his high estimation of Touba Ci's power, Li Jiangqian felt a profound chill seep into his heart, and a cold sweat broke out across his body. Fortunately, the Great Void rumbled at that moment. A hand grabbed his collar, and stepping on roiling flames, pulled him sideways in a single step!

From one side, a brilliant Celestial Gate rose to suppress the halberd. From the other, a greenish-yellow ruler descended to barely hold back the Dawn Qi. A sharp command rang out in Li Jiangqian’s ears.

"Edict!"

The vast Light of the Six Harmonies flooded his body, purging the Profound Qi divine ability. Li Jiangqian coughed out a puff of black gas and looked up just in time to hear Gongsun Bei's booming laughter. The Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform in the sky above was rapidly expanding as it plummeted toward them.

Gongsun Bei laughed.

"Perfect! We'll capture them all at once!"

His face was wreathed in smiles, but Touba Ci's expression changed slightly as he took a step back.

The Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform hung frozen in mid-air, bound by countless threads of fine golden light that rendered it immobile. A layer of bright, dancing Li Fire covered its surface, constantly neutralizing the brilliance of its divine ability.

An infinite darkness had spread across the sky. Below, the great desert rolled on, the setting sun lying like a dying tiger between heaven and earth. A golden-eyed young man stood with a halberd in one hand. He held his other hand before his lips, where a flickering flame the size of a soybean—the flame of his life-mandate—danced.

Golden blood still dripped from the halberd's blade. A spectacular, seven-colored gash ran across the young man's cheek, deep enough to reveal the bone beneath. But his golden eyes were filled with a placid coldness that made Touba Ci narrow his eyes in vigilance and Gongsun Bei grit his teeth in hatred.

'Li Zhouwei...'

'Where did he come from? Something's wrong... something is definitely wrong... What was he guarding?'

'Baiye? Don't tell me it fell that quickly!'

Li Ximing showed no surprise at all, using the brief pause to reposition himself. As he moved, the darkness in the sky vanished. In Gongsun Bei's eyes, the image of the golden halberd swelled rapidly.

Li Zhouwei was before him!

Once, wielding the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform, Gongsun Bei had pinned this Qilin to the lake's surface. Even without the Spiritual Treasure, he had been confident in his ability to suppress the so-called King Wei.

But now, the man before him had mastered three divine abilities at a speed worthy of a reincarnated master. He charged forward, his fearsome, majestic face illuminated by the shining white Qilin patterns on his skin, and for a single, terrifying moment, Gongsun Bei felt his courage fail him.

A rain-patterned vase instantly lit up. The light of the Plea to Supplant the Night followed, diminishing the Bright Yang's illusory radiance, before releasing a stream of jade-like, emerald droplets.

In an instant, a heavy gloom descended. The sun and moon vanished, heat and cold were inverted, and the flow of qi stagnated. The halberd's dazzling light was steadily diminished by this strange radiance, even as the Binding Light technique shone down to counter it.

Gongsun Bei was skilled, after all. Though his humble origins meant his Spiritual Artifact was not particularly powerful, the profound might of his Plea to Supplant the Night still greatly weakened the Binding Light. One technique leveraged the suppressing power of its Dao lineage, the other drew upon the noble might of a superior Spiritual Artifact; in the end, they canceled each other out.

But the halberd, empowered by Sovereign's Perilous Tread, was already at his throat!

Unending Dawnfire!

A brilliant flash of Dawn Qi washed over the young man, but it failed to slow him in the slightest. The halberd crashed down upon Gongsun Bei, exploding in a wave of Heavenly Light.

Only then did the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform break free from the Southern Emperor's Profound Art and return to suppress its master's foe!

The platform was, after all, an Ancient Spiritual Treasure. In comparison, the Li family's Heavenly Nurture Urn suffered from a weakening Dao Lineage, and the Pure Yang Bracelets were merely ceremonial artifacts. Only the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument could truly compare. Now, as the platform descended with the suppressive power of the Bright Yang Dao Lineage, even Li Zhouwei was forced to take a step back.

Gongsun Bei, however, was coughing up great mouthfuls of Heavenly Light. His already grievously wounded dharma body was beginning to collapse. He watched in horror as the darkness began to envelop him once more, and the white Qilin brought two fingers together, conjuring that terrifying, soybean-sized flame again.

'I have to get out of here!'

...

The sky was a dreary gray, crisscrossed by streams of light and qi.

A thick, abyssal qi rose into the air like a hidden black sea, dissolving every divine ability it touched. On the other side, the air flickered between light and dark, faint, silvery-white cracks appearing in space.

A small drum floated in mid-air, its long golden tassels fluttering. A small silver mallet rhythmically struck the drumhead, causing the sky to pulse with colorful, alternating light.

The light seemed faint, but it caused the underworld carriage submerged in the Exiled Mist to tremble violently. Its delicately carved, dark windows rattled as if battered by a hurricane, threatening to burst open at any moment.

A terrifying divine ability stretched across the heavens. The Exiled Qi sealed off the Great Void, cutting off inside from out. The master of the underworld carriage raised his head, his voice sharp and cold.

"Qi Lanyan... how many lives do you have to waste on me?"

A corner of the black clouds parted, vaguely revealing the icy face of the Daoist-robed man within. He adjusted his crown, raised an eyebrow, and spoke calmly.

"Daoist Friend Yang, we simply serve different masters. Whether I return to my mountain to pursue the Purple Mystery or die here in this northern storm, what need have I for multiple lives? You, on the other hand..."

"You are merely waiting to accomplish your task and retire. You still have one life left to you."

His words were placid, but they made the carriage window rattle even more furiously. Yang Ruiyi's voice was low and heavy.

"Qi Lanyan... do you think anyone is fooled by the banner you fly? The great tides of this world cannot be turned by a single person or a single family."

Qi Lanyan merely smiled, estimating that the time was near.

"And how do you know," he said softly, "that a greater power does not stand behind me?"

In that instant, the golden silk ribbons of the drum leaped into the air. Three small mallets inscribed with profound patterns struck the drumhead in unison, shaking the very heavens. An impossibly dense, silver-white thunder erupted from within the Exiled Qi, blasting through the blockade with a roar that echoed across the world!

"BOOM!"

The dark, profound carriage emerged from a blessed land churning with purple qi. The man inside watched the streak of light vanish into the distance, then stood motionless, a strange look on his face as he silently swallowed a mouthful of blood.

'Thunder... is ultimately tyrannical.'

With Li Zhouwei heading to Baiye, Yang Ruiyi had naturally made for his long-desired destination of Shanji at top speed, only to be intercepted halfway by Qi Lanyan himself.

The northern and southern forces had clashed many times. Yang Ruiyi had often taken to the field personally, coming and going as he pleased. Yet his counterpart, Qi Lanyan, had always remained aloof in his mountain sanctuary. The only time he had acted was to lead his people away from Baiye to prevent the situation from escalating.

This was their first true confrontation, and it left Yang Ruiyi feeling wary and disheartened.

'The Drum of Annihilating Profound Thunder... he wields it with such ease. No wonder the Viewing Pavilion faction took him in. Qi Lanyan... is a capable man indeed. In this, the south is still lacking.'

Unlike Comprehending Profoundity with its many inherited Dao Lineages, the southern Underworld had long ignored the mortal realm, leaving it with no noteworthy traditions to speak of. The Yang clan they now relied on was itself a fallen house with few members. They had possessed some foundation when they migrated south and established their various prefectures, but after the rise and fall of the Yang-Yue, they were a shadow of their former selves.

It was precisely because of this decline that he, Yang Ruiyi, had been granted his current opportunity. But it also meant that when men like Qi Lanyan wielded Dao Lineages and dharma artifacts of a comparable level, he found himself struggling.

'The threshold to the Purple Mystery... I've waited too many years. I can't delay any longer...'

His gaze was like ice, but he had no time to catch his breath. Since Qi Lanyan had intercepted him here, the northern cultivators emerging from Shanji would surely press their advantage and head for the Linhai prefectures.

'If I let them penetrate our heartland and cause chaos in Simin, ten lives wouldn't be enough to pay for my failure!'

Although his situation was similar to that of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao—with both the Yang and Guanhua families bearing the responsibility for their own fortunes—neither dared to cross the other's fundamental boundaries and threaten the foundations of the Underworld. Still, he couldn't afford to gamble his life on that assumption. He immediately began to retract the Exiled Qi that filled the sky, preparing to form a seal for communication, when he saw a woman riding the wind toward him. Her figure was unsteady, her face ashen. She stopped before him and spoke in a low voice.

"Great General... the south has held! Linhai Prefecture is intact... Lord Lin has performed a great service!"

A wave of relief washed over Yang Ruiyi. He let out a sincere sigh of relief, a smile touching his lips.

"Xiukui is as reliable as ever!"

But as his finger traced a pattern on his palm, the expression of the Grand General of the North of Song suddenly changed. An icy dread washed over his face.

'Baiye? It's lost...'

He was horrified. He had disregarded the eastern front and sent Li Zhouwei to Baiye, and they had still been defeated.

He turned his head, his gaze dark, just in time to see a strand of golden light streak across the Great Void. He opened his mouth to curse, but when he saw the old man covered in roiling True Fire and riddled with wounds, he swallowed his anger and asked coldly,

"What happened!"

The Great General had always presented a benevolent front. Seeing this expression for the first time, Situ Huo knew they must have fallen into a northern plot. He immediately feigned weakness and cried out in distress.

"It was someone from Comprehending Profoundity! They cultivate Returning Earth!"

Yang Ruiyi's gaze was grim. His adversary's last words echoed in his mind. He listened intently to the memory, then closed his eyes, gritted his teeth, and took a deep, shuddering breath.

"A Dao Lineage of Numinous Treasure... it truly is Tongxuan Palace..."




# Chapter 1147: A Scheme in Broad Daylight

Shadowy clouds churned above Shanji, seeming to gestate countless wraiths within their depths. A palace of the Underworld stood upon that sea of clouds, and from time to time, streaks of light would descend from it, flying off in all directions.

Within the dark, lightless hall of the Underworld, Yang Ruiyi’s face was a mask of gloom. He stood in utter silence. Before him, a woman in pitch-black robes was equally afraid to make a sound.

"Qi Lanyan… is he trying to get himself killed?"

Even though it had already happened, he still found it impossible to comprehend.

'The Underworld and Mount Luoxia are both high and mighty. Below them are the Guanhua and the Yang clan, like ants beneath the feet of two giants. We look impressive on the surface, but we all know that in the eyes of our own superiors, we’re nothing. We’re even more terrified of the powers backing our rivals… This was supposed to be a cordial affair, something we’d wrap up with a bit of fanfare…'

In Yang Ruiyi’s mind, he and Qi Lanyan had always had a tacit understanding despite their frequent contests. They were like two young nobles playing a game of kickball; there were wins and losses, but they would laugh it off and finish the match amiably.

When it was time for the game to end, the ball was his to take home, as he had been the one to bring it in the first place.

But Qi Lanyan’s current move was like he’d inexplicably flown into a rage out of humiliation. He’d called upon his royal relatives, and just as the game was about to end, he insisted on kicking the ball back and smashing it right into Yang Ruiyi’s face.

Yang Ruiyi certainly had his own trump cards and wasn't afraid of some Numinous Treasure cultivator, but a single question filled him with doubt.

'What’s the point?'

He knew Qi Lanyan was targeting Bright Yang; it was the entire reason the man held his position. Everyone understood this, so why make a fuss with the Yang family? Did he really think he could snatch the ball away?

"After all this trouble, it’s as if Qi Lanyan is playing for keeps, truly determined to establish who’s superior!"

Hearing his furious words, Yang Tianyou whispered, "Perhaps… it's about Vast Cicada."

Yang Ruiyi fell instantly silent.

He had never anticipated the matter with Vast Cicada, nor had he ever shouldered the blame for it. For a moment, he’d forgotten that from his rival’s perspective, he was the one who had, without any reason, delivered a slap in the middle of their game.

He let out a cold sigh, a premonition stirring within him.

"Then what is his intention?"

Yang Tianyou appeared quite calm.

"He has such a powerful card to play, yet he used it on the insignificant Baiye Creek. He’s clearly not acting out of pure anger."

The words cut through his confusion like a sunbeam through clouds, and the grand general’s mind cooled. He narrowed his eyes.

"His target is still Bright Yang."

Yang Tianyou nodded grimly.

"Wang Ziya is certainly formidable, but they specifically sent a cultivator of the 'Returning Earth' Dao-path. This was clearly a targeted move. For Qi Lanyan to deploy him ahead of schedule… I fear it’s a warning."

"Whether he's bluffing with borrowed power or not, he truly does have the ability to make us retreat empty-handed for a time."

Yang Ruiyi was not a fool. He rose and paced two steps before raising an eyebrow.

"Indeed."

Yang Tianyou hesitated before nodding, her voice soft.

"He wouldn’t dare stand against the great tide of destiny. But from his position, while he cannot decide the outcome, he can influence the process. Besides… we will eventually take Shanji and the Xuanmiao Temple, but what else will we lose in the meantime?"

Yang Ruiyi was quiet for a long time, his eyes shut tight. A look of apprehension crossed his face.

"Indeed," he said. "His methods are brilliant."

Yang Tianyou lowered her head, her expression grim.

"But he forgets that Li Zhouwei is no ordinary man. Even if he can’t see the truth of this now, he will in time. This is too damaging to our relations, and I fear it is improper. Not to mention, the Emperor…"

But Yang Ruiyi’s gaze turned cold. He shook his head.

"The ones we should be considering… are the great ones."

Yang Tianyou’s pupils widened in an instant. She took a sharp breath.

'He's right… We haven’t received any new orders. We’ve been letting Wang Ziya run rampant in Baiye, which probably means the great ones, and even the Underworld, have tacitly approved. They’re remaining impartial…'

She had once spoken personally with one of the great ones. Many powerful figures cared deeply about the matter of Bright Yang.

'It isn’t just Mount Luoxia that dislikes Emperor Wei; the Underworld is no friend of his either. Even the fox-kin and the Immortal Mansions… none of them have any goodwill for Li Qianyuan! For Qi Lanyan to make such a move, he must be catering to the preferences of a certain great one in the north.'

A chill seized her heart. She looked up abruptly to see Yang Ruiyi struggling to raise a hand, his eyes still clamped shut.

"Have Lingu Lanying come up."

---

The colors above the water's surface had grown dim. Fading streaks and wisps of light receded into the distance as the great array powered down. Li Ximing retracted his divine ability and took a deep, shuddering breath, the dizzy spell that had afflicted him finally beginning to ease.

'That was a bit too close for comfort.'

Neither Touba Ci nor Gongsun Bei were easy opponents. One was a descendant of the Great Liang imperial line, and the other was a Dawn Qi cultivator wielding a Spiritual Treasure. Either one of them should have been more than enough to suppress him, and even posed a risk of serious injury.

This battle had been fought with the backing of the great array, and the divine effect of his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body had been put to great use. It was what allowed him to hold out against their combined assault. With the timely aid of two Spiritual Treasures and Li Jiangqian’s sudden strike that wounded Gongsun Bei, they had managed to survive until now.

'If anything had gone wrong by even a small margin, I might have been fine, but Jiangqian would have likely been injured…'

He scrambled to his feet and flew up to check on Li Zhouwei. The King of Wei stood atop a brilliant, shining Celestial Gate, retracting his own divine ability with a hint of regret.

Li Zhouwei had rushed here while still wounded, his momentum fearsome as he saved Ting Province. He’d had killing intent in his heart, but Touba Ci and his companion reacted too quickly. With one of his own wounded and another still young on the lake, Li Zhouwei had not pursued them deeply.

'Gongsun Bei is badly hurt. He won't be causing any trouble for a while…'

Of course, Li Zhouwei’s sudden arrival would not be for nothing. With a sweep of his sleeve, the Celestial Gate beside him rumbled, and as the lights faded, a bottle was revealed.

The bottle had a long neck and was the color of azure jade, magnificent and radiant. Coils of Dawn Qi swirled around it, and even held in his hand, it struggled ceaselessly, trying to escape.

It was Gongsun Bei’s Night Supplanting Bottle!

Though the Spiritual Artifact wasn’t forged from any exceedingly rare spiritual materials, its intricate patterns and potent spiritual aura showed that a great deal of effort had gone into its refinement. Among Spiritual Artifacts, it was certainly not of low quality.

'A pity it’s attuned to Dawn Qi. While I can’t use it myself, its greater value is in the loss Gongsun Bei has suffered… When the opportunity arises, I can trade this for some Li Fire or a Whole Pill!'

As he suppressed the bottle, his eyes met Li Ximing’s. Daoist Master Zhaojing looked deeply worried.

"How is your injury?" he asked.

Li Zhouwei knew he was referring to the piercing wound on his face. He touched it with a finger and saw it still came away with golden blood. His expression darkened slightly.

"It’s not severe…" he answered.

"The Rainbow Glow?"

"Yes."

It was the first time Li Zhouwei had been struck by a Heavenly Glow technique from a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator personally taught by a master of Comprehending Profoundity. The experience left a deep impression. Seeing the crimson-robed young man fly over on a plume of fire, he explained,

"It possesses a strange divinity. The wound is infused with Wu Light, making it feel heavy and insidious, extremely difficult to heal."

Li Zhouwei’s Emperor Qi's Light had clashed with his opponent's Heavenly Glow. The colors had flown apart, and his own technique quickly disintegrated. Nearly half the power of that Heavenly Glow had slammed into him. His Primal Summit treasure had nullified twenty percent of it, and his Radiant Sun King's Halberd and other minor abilities shaved off another five percent, leaving a quarter of the full force to land.

Thus, the wound wasn't severe, but it was deep. The trouble was the lingering Wu Light that interfered with his recovery.

Normally, his physical body was harder to heal than that of an ordinary person, but thanks to his Sovereign's Perilous Tread and Illuminating Sun and Moon techniques, his recovery rate was actually a notch faster. Even so, the injury showed no signs of lessening for the time being.

He briefly recounted the events at Baiye Creek.

"Tinglan and Situ Huo went to rescue the forces at Shanji. I saw there was trouble on the lake and folded back…"

But the news from Baiye caused Li Ximing’s expression to change.

"A master of Comprehending Profoundity? Someone from Mount Luoxia came? How can that be… From your description, if this person takes a stand at Baiye, how can the war between north and south even be fought? The Yang clan… what a headache this must be for them."

Li Zhouwei’s face was grim.

"There’s more… I don’t know if this person has cultivated some spell art or possesses a divine ability, but his body was veiled in a thick shroud, concealing his cultivation level. It was only when he used a 'Returning Earth' divine ability that I recognized his Dao Lineage."

Li Ximing sighed.

"I knew something was wrong—they were waiting for you on the north bank! If you hadn't gone to Baiye, you’d still be fighting at the White River… And if you weren't there, Baiye would have fallen. I don't know if Tinglan could have escaped, but if those Buddhist cultivators had turned toward the White River while you were still entangled, it would have been adding frost to snow. Another calamity!"

Li Ximing’s deduction was not wrong; it was highly likely this had been the north’s plan all along. This, however, only made Li Zhouwei more suspicious. A thought suddenly sank in his heart.

'The timing of Yang Ruiyi’s summons was quite clever. Was it intentional or a coincidence… Did he know this would happen?'

He hesitated for only a second before the answer became clear.

'No… Yang Ruiyi himself probably couldn’t have easily handled the situation at Baiye. If he knew about the enemy’s deployment, he should have ordered Tinglan and Situ Huo to abandon Shanji and defend their positions, or even reinforce the White River. That would have surely reduced his losses—not sent me there on a fool’s errand!'

'That Daoist master descended from a Grotto-Heaven. He was likely acting on direct orders that no one could have predicted…'

He shook his head, his thoughts heavy.

"There is something strange about this. I fear… the Yang clan was also caught by surprise."

"So… how should we proceed?" Li Ximing asked, his face clouded with indecision.

"Touba Ci and the other have retreated, but Protector-General Liu is still at the White River. If we let them leave… I’m afraid his position will become precarious."

The King of Wei fell silent for a moment, but it was Li Jiangqian who spoke, his voice quiet.

"As this junior sees it, we must not act rashly. Since Yang Ruizao is by Liu Bai’s side with the nation-suppressing Spiritual Treasure, the Guzhou Cauldron, he cannot be easily defeated. Otherwise, those two would not have crossed the river to pursue us… Now that Baiye has fallen, crossing the river ourselves would be walking right into a trap."

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes and nodded.

"On the opposite bank, there are at least three mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Although Gongsun Bei is now wounded by my hand, the Way of Great Desire and Zhelu are still there, having come from Baiye—not to mention that Daoist master. With the Yang clan’s plans in disarray, our own safety on the lake must be our first priority."

"Furthermore…"

He sighed, but before he could elaborate, he felt a tremor in the Great Void. A patch of black clouds appeared, from which a streak of dark, turquoise light flew, materializing over the lake into the form of a woman.

It was Lingu Lanying.

Her face was slightly pale as she came to a sudden halt above the water. Her gaze fell upon Li Jiangqian’s face, and she stared for a moment in a daze. But the urgency of the situation left her no time for questions. She immediately looked up.

"Greetings, King of Wei. Lanying has come with orders… Please, Your Highness, hold Ting Province and await reinforcements!"

Li Zhouwei’s expression was grave. He didn’t answer her directly, but instead asked in a low, urgent tone,

"How is Tangdao?"

Lingu Lanying faltered.

"They are still holding on. After Baiye fell, Zhelu and the others immediately moved to the White River. Protector-General Liu received orders and retreated toward Tangdao with Yang Ruizao ahead of time. They are now defending the mountain alongside the master and disciple from Overlook Peak."

"We hear the assault is not fierce. They can hold out for a while longer."

Li Zhouwei frowned.

"In that case, Tangdao is now isolated in the north. Touba Ci and his allies are right across the river, along with Zhelu’s group, and even that Daoist master… Could they not cross the river again at any moment?"

Lingu Lanying flinched. She lowered her gaze and said softly,

"That Daoist master is from a Numinous Treasure Order; he will not cross the river. The Grand General has already dispatched fellow Daoists Chen Yin and Tinglan to reinforce you… The Grand General says… to please rest assured, King of Wei… More aid is on its way!"

She gave a deep bow and then hurried south to deliver her next message. Li Zhouwei had caught the crucial information. His golden eyes narrowed. "Western Shu has not yet made a move. I must ask Martial Uncle to keep watch over the Western Mountains."

Li Ximing could only nod. Li Zhouwei then turned to his second son.

"Protector-General Liu is a pillar of our nation. We cannot sit by and watch him be besieged. I want you to watch the northern shore. If Tangdao is breached and he attempts to break out to the south, do what you can to assist him."

Li Jiangqian understood he was referring to his Spirit Probe technique, which could see for a thousand li. He bowed. "Father, rest assured."

The King of Wei transformed into a streak of light and vanished. Li Ximing, his face etched with worry, departed as well. Li Jiangqian took up a Li-Light artifact and headed north, his mind racing.

'To have me watch the northern shore… there’s likely more than one meaning to that. Grand Martial Uncle is too soft-hearted. Is Father worried that if the north truly shows killing intent, he won’t be ruthless enough to stand his ground?'

---

The divine abilities in the sky above had long since faded, but the cave-abode remained silent. The lamplight flickered restlessly, the only sound the pacing of a man. A map laid out on the main table was covered in so many marks it had become a chaotic mess.

'At Moongaze Lake… they’re actually fighting at Moongaze Lake…'

According to his memory, the Battle of Baihai in his second life had not changed. The Way of Great Desire besieged Tangdao, while Qi Lanyan used Touba Ci, Shilou Yingge, and Gongsun Bei to attack Baiye Creek, with the Maha Buddhists defending Shanji… Forget Ting Province, there hadn't even been a major battle at Baixiang Valley on the opposite shore.

Li Suining stopped by the main seat, a chill creeping into his heart.

"Qi Lanyan… what tricks is he up to now…"

The moment he had felt the ripple of divine abilities in the heavens, Li Suining had been shaken to his core. The Battle of Baihai had indeed taken place in the eighteenth year of Martial Cultivation… but that was in the seventh month. It was currently only the fourth.

'Qi Lanyan has launched the war ahead of schedule… The Great Song… is very likely unprepared…'

This threw all of Li Suining’s own arrangements into chaos.

His eyes darted across the ink-stained map, but he only grew more confused. He looked up sharply to find the man in black and gold robes already standing before him.

"Your Highness…"

Li Suining’s gaze immediately fell upon the deep, seven-colored gash on his face. He felt a jolt and was about to speak, but Li Zhouwei simply raised a hand, his expression grave as he stared at the map.

After only two breaths, his low voice sounded.

"Someone came from a Grotto-Heaven. That is why you did not foresee this."

Li Suining felt as if all the blood in his body had rushed to his head. He snapped his head up, his eyes instantly filled with profound shock and a chilling fear. His lips parted in horror.

"Yao Guanyi?!"

Li Zhouwei looked up sharply, meeting his eyes for an instant before slowly shaking his head.

Li Suining felt the blood drain back out of his head, a wave of heat washing over his limbs. He listened as Li Zhouwei gave a concise summary. "I was ordered to Baiye Creek… We failed to hold it… Touba Ci, Shilou Yingge, and Gongsun Bei… surrounded the White River. Liu Bai held one back, while Gongsun and Touba headed south. I rushed back… and just drove them off…"

A deep chill gripped Li Suining’s heart as he listened. Hearing Li Zhouwei’s description of the mysterious Daoist master, though he felt bewildered, he gradually calmed down. He seized upon the core issue and said urgently,

"A True Monarch’s Dao Lineage must have given an order, perhaps out of displeasure over the Vast Cicada affair. Qi Lanyan is borrowing their might… All arrangements have been disrupted, even the timing of the southern campaign… is wrong!"

Li Zhouwei was not surprised. He had already gleaned much from Yang Ruiyi’s reaction. The war between north and south was, at its core, a restrained conflict. But this move by Qi Lanyan had most certainly caught the Yang family in its calculations as well.

Li Suining’s thoughts mirrored his own. He looked up and whispered,

"Although this junior does not know the north’s current arrangements… this move by Qi Lanyan is absolutely, extremely dangerous!"

He lowered his gaze, his tone rapid.

"Dangerous for himself, and dangerous for the Yang clan!"

Li Zhouwei closed his eyes in thought, then suddenly asked,

"Qi Lanyan is now completely out of control. Don't waste your thoughts on him. Tell me, what is the Underworld’s trump card?"

When Li Zhouwei went to the Wilderness, Yang Ruiyi had mentioned his own plans, all while feigning frustration with pressure from his superiors. But Li Zhouwei hadn’t believed him. That Grand General of the Underworld… absolutely had a card of his own to play.

Li Suining considered for a moment, then gritted his teeth.

"The sword immortal of the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate, the Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal—Lingmei."

Li Zhouwei’s eyebrows shot up.

A Great Daoist Master.

'He… has surpassed the Purple Mystery stage!'

In an instant, everything became crystal clear to Li Zhouwei.

'No wonder!'

What was Yang Ruiyi’s original plan?

To have Liu Bai defend the White River and protect Moongaze Lake, while Situ Huo held the line at Baiye Creek. Li Zhouwei and Yang Ruiyi would then attack Shanji together.

If that was the entirety of the plan, it would have been like drinking poison to quench a thirst. Liu Bai and Situ Huo would not only be under immense pressure, facing the risk of death at any moment, but they also wouldn’t be able to hold out for long. But if a Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal from the Sword Gate, wielding the Great Snow's Severing Edge, were to step out… the situation would be entirely different.

Without that Daoist master from the Grotto-Heaven, having such a four-divine-ability sword cultivator join forces with Li Zhouwei and Yang Ruiyi would be enough to grind Shanji to dust, even if it were made of immortal gold and profound iron. They could have killed their way to the Xuanmiao Temple in one fell swoop.

'And at that point, the Xuanmiao Temple would be defended by Qi Lanyan alone!'

At that moment, it wouldn't matter if they lost the White River or Baiye Creek, or even the entire Jianghuai region. By pulling out the nail of Shanji that was driven deep into their territory and seizing the bridgehead of Xuanmiao, they could consolidate all the forces in eastern Jiangnan. The Jianghuai region would be theirs for the taking.

Li Zhouwei raised his eyebrows.

"Does Qi Lanyan know?"

Li Suining’s voice was somber.

"He has a disciple at his side named Fan Kang, who is also favored by the Heavenly Element."

The King of Wei took a step, murmuring, "Fan… Kang…"

The gold in his eyes slowly turned to ice.

"So… Qi Lanyan launched a preemptive strike to avoid being forced out of Jianghuai. That Daoist master is his backing—a certain great one who indeed does not wish to see things overturned so quickly."

"So what is Qi Lanyan’s plan now? To pull out the two daggers of Baiye and Tangdao, consolidate his forces to protect Shanji, and drag out the war with the Great Song for another two years?"

His words made Li Suining fall silent for a moment. He looked up.

"The north’s plans are difficult to guess… But for now… I’m afraid our only choice is to defend…"

"Wrong."

Li Suining looked up to see the King of Wei’s eyes blazing with a thick, golden light.

"It’s unnecessary," he said coldly. "Qi Lanyan has no need to go to all this trouble. His mind has never been on the war between north and south. He’s schemed against me more than once; I know him."

"Protecting Shanji… does it matter if it’s a year sooner or a year later? By causing such a major shift in the grand scheme, will he not offend the Underworld? Will he not interfere with the plans of some great one?"

"That Daoist master may be there to back him up, but Qi Lanyan would never be so foolish. The process doesn't matter, but the final result does. He won’t even try to defend Shanji. He won't even try to defend the Xuanmiao Temple."

"Stalling for two years is meaningless. Baihai, and indeed Jianghuai… will be lost sooner or later. If it’s lost, it’s lost. Why did Yang Ruiyi order me to hold my ground here and await reinforcements? Qi Lanyan’s target is me. It’s Bright Yang."

"As long as I am in Ting Province, he will bring his forces to the White River, or even to Ting Province itself. Before he leaves, he is determined to suppress me, to wound me gravely, to damage my aura and destiny."

He looked up, his voice like ice.

"Ordering me to defend this place is to accept this suppression. I am to meet Qi Lanyan and his forces with all my men, and it doesn't matter if we fight until the sky goes dark and the sun and moon lose their light, or if a million corpses pile up and our divine abilities are shattered. All that matters is that we tie them down."

"Then Yang Ruiyi can leisurely take Shanji and the Xuanmiao Temple, and even swallow the whole of Jianghuai—thousands of li of territory. The lives of others are unimportant, and since no one dares to kill me, Li Zhouwei, what does it matter?"

Li Suining’s understanding of the situation was profound. He reacted in an instant, his eyes flying open as he gritted his teeth.

"The two sides have joined forces!"

Thunder rolled in his heart. He looked up, about to speak, but the King of Wei stopped him. The smile in his eyes was frigid.

"It’s fine. Understanding is enough. He will not be difficult to deal with."

---

The mountain was shrouded in dense, dark clouds, and the four realms were dim. Qi Lanyan returned on the wind, retracting his arts before the great hall. He tucked his hands into his sleeves and only then strode inside.

His eyes were bright, full of pride and satisfaction.

The lamplight on both sides flickered with the magical breeze. As the Daoist Master walked forward, the cultivators on either side, their faces alight with joy, offered their congratulations.

"Congratulations, my lord!"

"Baiye Creek has been conquered!"

"Tangdao is under siege!"

Stepping into the main hall, he saw Fan Kang hurry forward, fawning.

"Master is brilliant! Li Zhouwei has appeared in Ting Province!"

"Ting Province is good," Qi Lanyan said with a smile. "A place where the star of Martial Cultivation does not shine."

He answered as he walked, his pace never faltering as he entered the rear hall. Silence fell instantly. The long-bearded Daoist master was already standing there, watching him with a smile. Qi Lanyan knew his great task was accomplished.

"I have troubled Martial Uncle Wang," he said.

He then picked up a pot, his spirit soaring, and sat down at the table. He filled Wang Ziya’s cup before pouring his own.

"Even the Yang clan will have to bow their heads now," he laughed.

Wang Ziya glanced at him, and his smile faded. He reached out and grasped the hand Qi Lanyan had hidden in his sleeve. The palm was pitch black, its veins like a spider’s web, dark and grim.

Wang Ziya stroked his white beard, his brow furrowing in alarm.

"You fought him?"

Only then did Qi Lanyan’s expression turn serious.

"The recapture of Baiye… could not be allowed to fail. Naturally, it fell to me to intercept him personally. By tying him down early, the matter at Baiye could proceed smoothly… I just pushed him too hard, and he started fighting for real. I had no choice but to use the Thunder of the Profound Drum to suppress him."

Qi Lanyan smiled, softening his tone.

"He didn’t get away unscathed either."

Wang Ziya seemed unable to understand. He shook his head.

"I don’t have much of my lifespan left. Coming down from the mountain is no great loss, and I have no regrets. But Yangfeng… you are young, with a great future ahead of you. You are the mortal Dao Lineage of Comprehending Profoundity. Why must you act like those cultivators of the mortal realm, throwing yourself into the fray? There is no benefit, and you will only be stained by karma… a world of trouble. When the time comes, who in the grand scheme of Bright Yang will be willing to protect you?"

"Furthermore, if Bright Yang truly succeeds one day, you, and the Viewing Pavilion, will likely be turned to ash."

Qi Lanyan lowered his head, avoiding his gaze. Wang Ziya had no choice but to stop. After a moment of thought, his expression changed.

"What will you do now?"

Qi Lanyan covertly watched his martial uncle’s face. He smiled.

"All that’s left is the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple, but they are like a turtle in a jar. The Way of Great Desire will besiege the mountain, while we will head south to the White River and shake the borders of the Song!"

Wang Ziya shook his head, looking somewhat disheartened.

"And after that?" he asked. He stroked his beard, clearly not supporting Qi Lanyan’s view.

"Know when to stop… My intervention on your behalf is already enough to give the Yang family a major headache. Must you press your advantage?"

"It’s too dangerous! You are not Li Zhouwei; you are not blessed by Bright Yang. Who stands behind you? He can kill Vast Cicada and walk away free, but do you dare kill even a single member of the Yang family?"

"As the lynchpin of Bright Yang, Li Zhouwei is destined to die sooner or later. He fears nothing and dares to kill anyone. His life is already on the gambling table. You still have a future, but right now… you are betting your own life alongside them!"

"Li Zhouwei killing Vast Cicada certainly broke the rules, but my descent from the mountain today is not merely for a tit-for-tat exchange. If we truly provoke the Underworld into a real fight, neither you nor I would be enough to withstand a single breath from them!"

He had put great effort into his admonishment, but Qi Lanyan’s eyes were bright. He was not surprised by the response.

"That is precisely the point. I, Qi Lanyan, have been pushed into this position, barely managing the interests of various factions. The Underworld is determined to reclaim its ancestral lands. As long as I value my life, I must bow my head and admit defeat. It is merely a matter of sooner or later. This is the great tide of the world."

His smile turned grim.

"My initial goal was to suppress Bright Yang, but I never expected the Yang clan’s stance to be so resolute. Since that is the case, I might as well be resolute myself."

"Baihai will be lost. The initiative in Jianghuai will be ceded. This is the south’s bottom line. But I can decide the price the Yang clan must pay to claim Jianghuai! I can decide how much territory they gain after their conquest!"

"If I am willing, even if the Xuanmiao Temple is lost, I can still occupy Tangdao, Baiye Creek, and Chengshui Marsh. This gives me more room to maneuver. For every year I delay, there is another year of benefit. The longer this drags on, the less time Bright Yang will have to accumulate power in the central plains, and the more prepared the Seven Aspects will be… and the greater Yang Ruiyi’s headache will become!"

Qi Lanyan paused.

"And the smaller the impact will be on Martial Uncle Wei."

Wang Ziya had never been able to understand his obsession with fighting the Great Song to the death. But upon hearing this last sentence, the gloom in his heart deepened.

"You… so this is… no wonder!"

Qi Lanyan began to laugh.

"This is a scheme in broad daylight. I am telling Yang Ruiyi plainly that I dare not refuse to cede Jianghuai, but I am determined to crush Bright Yang! I will ensure that Li Zhouwei gains not a shred of merit from the loss of this vast eastern Huai river region. I will see him so grievously wounded that he must recuperate for ten, even twenty years, ensuring he gains no glory from the subsequent campaigns in Jianghuai or even Qilu!"

"As long as Martial Uncle watches the east for me, if Li Zhouwei is at the White River, I will fight him at the White River. If he is at Baiye Creek, I will attack Baiye Creek. And if he is in Ting Province… I will go there even if the entire world is watching! I will humiliate and persecute him, kill his descendants, and damage his destiny!"

Wang Ziya was visibly moved. He shook his head, trying to calm his incredulous heart, and whispered,

"You… you are too stubborn… you place too much importance on this grand destiny! Have you… have you considered Xuanlou? Does he truly care about this?"

But Qi Lanyan ignored him, his demeanor unnervingly calm.

"The most crucial point is that he is not the one making the decisions. The Underworld’s attention to the mortal realm far exceeds that of the mountain sects. The Yang clan will surely prefer to simply reclaim Jianghuai, rather than face me head-on in a decisive battle… This is not a matter for Yang Ruiyi alone."

"Both sides will be pleased to see this happen."

"After this is over, I will withdraw from the mortal world. I will beg to enter the mountains. Since Martial Uncle Wang was willing to come here for me, a great one will surely be willing to accept me in the future. I will vanish from this world, and no one will ever find me."

"He is already at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm; this is the time when Bright Yang is weak and obscure. This heavy blow must be struck now, preventing him from building upon the glory of killing Vast Cicada and from consolidating his merits in the central plains. He will never be able to find me afterward. Even if he later becomes a Great Daoist Master, arrives at Weidu Prefecture, and is about to ascend to the True Dao, Bright Yang will forever remember this unavenged grievance!"

Wang Ziya stared at him, stunned.

"And if you fail to retreat successfully?"

Qi Lanyan’s eyes held a smile, but it was brimming with cold cruelty.

"I know what Martial Uncle is implying. They care about face; I do not. I am not afraid of offending those great ones who wish for Bright Yang's return to its rightful position—the worst that can happen is death! If I perish, can Li Zhouwei track me down to the Underworld to seek his revenge?"

Wang Ziya’s face changed dramatically.

"Must it come to this?"

"Must it come to this?" Qi Lanyan laughed. "Martial Uncle knows I possess a Heavenly Element scion, so you know what drives me. I entered the mountains at the age of six, but after ten years, I still could not sense Qi. I was cast out. The snow fell thick and fast. My father was already dead, and my uncle deemed me a failure for wasting a decade. It was my grandmaster and Martial Uncle Wei who took me in."

"Later, my grandmaster passed away. His only regret was failing to achieve the Dao. He held Martial Uncle’s hand tightly and said… ‘To restrain the Yin and master the Yang—this is the sole purpose of Xuanlou!’ The snow was still falling heavily then. This is the dream of three generations of Guanhua!"

Qi Lanyan’s gaze was like ice as he smiled.

"He may not care, but I must!"

"‘To ride the golden path to the Three Profound Halls, without power, no monarch earns respect. To ascend requires the Mandate of Heaven; learn not from the fallen Qin and Tang.’ The great Wuguan himself lamented as much. Martial Uncle need not try to persuade me further!"

Wang Ziya fell silent again, a grave look in his eyes. He suddenly felt that the person before him was completely different from the one he remembered. A doubt began to form, and his expression wavered.

'The Grotto-Heavens of Numinous Treasures enjoy endless Dao Lineages and use lavish resources… yet for years they have produced no golden talent, suffering one setback after another… I, too, had high hopes placed upon me… yet I have fallen to the point where my Dao-path is dictated by others. The younger generation, regardless of their talent, likely cannot even match the decisiveness of this Qi Lanyan!'

'Could it be true, as Yao Guanyi said, that there are "no heroic spirits left in the Grotto-Heavens"?'

He was lost in a daze when he heard a thud. The man before him had dropped to his knees, performing a grand bow. Wang Ziya was startled and quickly stepped aside to avoid it.

"What are you doing?"

Qi Lanyan stared fixedly into his eyes.

"This junior will never forget Martial Uncle’s kindness. The fact that you came here today proves that my actions are not entirely wrong… If, for my father’s sake, you have even a sliver of desire to see me succeed… please tell me… the great one’s command!"

Wang Ziya was silent, not knowing how to answer. After a long moment, he let out a breath.

"King Wei killed Vast Cicada. I, too, must eliminate someone to consider this matter settled."




# Chapter 1148: Besieged by North and West

Immortal light cascaded like a waterfall as clouds of Purple Qi billowed.

The Golden Feather Sect shimmered with a brilliant radiance, a picture of profound peace. Several streaks of immortal light soared through the air with carefree leisure. Within a high courtyard, an old man and a young man sat across from each other, sipping tea and playing a board game.

The young man placed his game piece, his expression still tinged with emotion.

“He was from the Wang clan of Guzhou Prefecture.”

“Guzhou Prefecture… the place where the Dao was first propagated. Wang Ziya… I suppose you could say we are all one family.”

The old man folded his hands, his tone heavy with sentiment.

“True Monarch Xu Xiang is gone, after all, and the Numinous Treasure Order is not faring well. No matter how much face they’re owed, it’s their people who must now venture into the mortal world.”

Tianhuo shook his head.

“Ancestor… his lifespan is nearly at its end. This isn’t such a bad assignment. Besides, True Monarch Xu Xiang always advocated for worldly engagement, so sending someone from the Numinous Treasure Order is only reasonable. What I fear is… Qi Lanyan’s current madness!”

“I don’t care what schemes he’s plotting. If he dares ruin Chengyun’s chances, he’ll be making an enemy of my Zhang family!”

Daoist Master Chunshuo’s expression turned grave.

“After all, my lineage has only produced this one hero. They are already guarding against us at every turn; we cannot afford the slightest compromise. As for the matter in Jianghuai, my family does not have grand ambitions. We don’t ask for great benefits, but he must at least attain the Purple Mystery and secure a chance at reincarnation.”

A cold glint flashed in Tianhuo’s eyes.

“Qi Lanyan’s madness may seem random, but it has roots. The lord is paving the way for the head disciple of that eminence in Dongmu Heaven—he has been through two reincarnations and has perfected his divine abilities. He can’t wait any longer!”

Daoist Master Chunshuo frowned.

“With his abilities, securing an Auxiliary Position shouldn’t be a problem. But to aim for a Fruition Attainment, and the Bright Yang one at that… We’re talking about Li Qianyuan. It’s no wonder the lord has been suppressing him. How can someone who has only cultivated within a grotto-heaven possibly contend with Emperor Wei?”

Tianhuo remained noncommittal.

“Whether he can contend or not depends on Bright Yang’s state. Do you not see the meaning in the name? The 'Seeker' in Sun Seeker Ring is a deliberate choice. It's pronounced the same as the word for 'Manifest,' but it was written without the 'King' radical. It's a clear sign: Bright Yang has cast off his royal path to return to the true one.”

“Comprehending Profoundity made the right calculation, keeping him out of the mortal world to cultivate as an immortal!”

The elder Daoist Master Chunshuo disagreed.

“I don’t believe it—and many within the grotto-heavens share my disbelief. That is the august Emperor Wei we speak of, and he once possessed the Sun Seeker Ring. How could he possibly be a fish on the chopping block? I fear that one careless day, the world will have a sovereign father once again.”

Tianhuo could only shake his head and smile.

“Ancestor, there’s no need to argue. Just watch. In the end, we are also loyal to Comprehending Profoundity. This junior recalls… when Lord Xue… when Lord Xue came to the mountain, he left behind two Immortal Edicts. One was for Emperor Wei’s reincarnation and his journey through Jianghuai.”

“The other, he told us to hide, to offer incense to it year after year, and to wait for the Second Manifestation in the world to open it…”

He chuckled.

“This junior has a premonition. When that time comes… this affair, which has been entangled for a thousand years, will finally be resolved.”

Daoist Master Chunshuo’s face was grim. He was about to speak when a streak of light shot toward them, landing swiftly in Tianhuo’s hand and transforming into a golden scroll no larger than his palm.

Tianhuo accepted it with both hands, though his expression held little respect. He smiled.

“I wonder what our great general is up to now!”

At the mention of Qing Jifang, even the good-natured Daoist Master Chunshuo couldn’t hide his disgust.

“They’re both grand generals, but it’s one thing for him to be inferior to Yang Ruiyi. In my eyes, he can’t even compare to Qi Lanyan!”

“He’s meant to be inferior. Otherwise, what would be the point of having him?”

Tianhuo smiled and shook his head, unrolling the scroll to reveal the golden text within.

‘The Zhao and Song have fallen out. Order Daoist Masters Muyan and Hongyan to take advantage of the situation and attack the Western Mountains. Observe the situation… strike when they are vulnerable. Ting Province, Jianghuai… ripe for the taking…’

The young man’s face hardened.

“He’s tangled in an inseparable fight with the Xiangxiong Kingdom and Yin Baiyue in the west, yet he still has his eyes on the Song court… and now he’s ordering us around?”

But after reading it over several times, Tianhuo frowned.

“How strange. Does Qing Jifang actually have the foresight to see that Qi Lanyan doesn’t plan to defend Jianghuai? Does he even know how to add frost to the snow in Ting Province?”

“Perhaps Qi Lanyan has been secretly advising him.”

Daoist Master Chunshuo shook his head.

“Then what is our position?”

Tianhuo set the golden scroll down and smiled.

“We are doing our part for the kingdom, of course. Naturally, we’ll go and have a look together.”

---

Lingu Lanying returned in a hurry from the south, passing through a heavy gloom, only to see a man standing amidst the clouds. His gray robes drifted in the wind. A small, brown pouch hung at his waist, looking heavy with whatever it contained, while on his other side hung a small, silver-white sword no longer than a palm.

Lingu Lanying quickly bowed in salute.

“Greetings, benefactor!”

The man was Lin Chensheng.

The newly ascended Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery, armed with numerous powerful treasures and secret sword talismans, had led the Song cultivators to a great victory against the northern cultivators in the region from Jingchuan to Linhai. Yet, his expression was unchanged, and he appeared to be in excellent condition.

Although everyone understood that Murong Yan and the others had likely been wary of being flanked by Yang Ruiyi and had long intended to retreat, merely using the battle as a convenient excuse, they were still stunned by the power of the treasures from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Seeing him now, Lingu Lanying simply smiled.

“Congratulations, benefactor!”

Lingu Lanying was perceptive and adopted a humble attitude. Lin Chensheng was polite in return, his expression serious.

“You’ve also come to see the grand general. Let us go together.”

He turned and strode forward. They entered the main hall together, where they saw a white-haired old man standing off to the side, his head bowed. The True Fire on his body had been extinguished, but dark, tattoo-like marks remained.

'Situ Huo.'

The Great Xiukui Monastery and the Situ family had never been on good terms, but times were different. Even though the blood-soaked saber on Situ Huo’s back was an eyesore to Lin Chensheng, he still gave a slight nod in greeting.

Lingu Lanying bowed.

“The grand general’s many orders have been relayed. The Daoist Masters have already departed for Ting Province!”

Yang Ruiyi, seated at the head of the hall, appeared deeply worried. His focus was clearly not on the ‘Daoist Masters.’ He asked with some urgency,

“What was King Wei’s reply?”

After asking, he felt he had misspoken. With a wave of his hand, a current of dark energy separated the two of them from the others. Lingu Lanying reported,

“This subordinate delivered the orders. King Wei asked about the northern strategies, and I answered him. I did not dare to linger and left for the south immediately… It’s just that, when I saw him…”

She was reluctant to say more, but seeing Yang Ruiyi’s probing gaze, she added awkwardly,

“He seemed full of doubt and did not give a clear answer.”

Yang Ruiyi’s anxiety deepened. He wanted to reprimand Lingu Lanying for her incompetence, but considering the setting, he waved his hand to disperse the Exiled Qi. He forced a smile only when he saw Lin Chensheng.

“Chensheng, you’ve come… You are a great meritorious official!”

Yang Ruiyi’s attitude toward Lin Chensheng was far better than even his treatment of Situ Huo. He immediately stood and walked down from his seat. Lin Chensheng quickly bowed and offered a polite remark before his smile vanished.

“I heard… something happened at Baiye Creek?”

Yang Ruiyi’s smile faded. He sighed.

“Yes… A person of note has arrived from the north.”

This made Lin Chensheng raise an eyebrow. He asked softly,

“And which family might this person be from?”

Though his tone was calm, Yang Ruiyi detected something unusual in it. He suddenly remembered the tragedy that had befallen the Great Xiukui Monastery, and a thought flickered in his mind,

'That master and disciple from the Great Xiukui Monastery both fell on the same day. It was undoubtedly the work of Wuguang. His heart must be burning with hatred…'

But what use was it? Yang Ruiyi saw it most clearly. Though the Great Xiukui Monastery still had some resources, the lowest-ranking enemy Lin Chensheng would have to face for his revenge was Qi Lanyan, and the highest was the Great Daoist Master of Mount Luoxia himself!

He could only sigh.

“He is a successor from the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition of True Monarch Xu Xiang, a ‘Returning Earth’ cultivator from Tongxuan Palace. They say his name is Wang Ziya.”

Having been thwarted and put on the defensive, Yang Ruiyi was clearly angered.

“To give him some credit, he is a Tongxuan cultivator, a successor of the Numinous Treasure lineage. But in reality, he’s just someone sent out from a grotto-heaven! If he were truly a major figure, would he have the time to swagger about on the river?”

His words, however, prompted the previously silent Situ Huo to speak. The old man said,

“Even an ordinary figure from a grotto-heaven possesses such skill.”

Yang Ruiyi fell silent for a moment, perhaps realizing his words had sounded like a slight against the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition. But then Lin Chensheng spoke.

“He is no longer ordinary. The grotto-heavens are sparsely populated. To be qualified to venture into the mortal world, one must be a top-tier figure at the very least, whose path forward has simply been severed.”

Wang Ziya had beaten Situ Huo so thoroughly that he had no fight left in him, and the sense of defeat among the divine ability masters of the Great Song was palpable. Although the Great Song was not as fragmented as the north, their words were filled with apprehension.

Yang Ruiyi saw their reluctance to fight but remained impassive. Seeing his inaction, Lin Chensheng frowned.

“Tangdao Mountain cannot be held for long. No matter what, we must do everything we can to reinforce them. If this man makes a move, the grand general himself will have to face him, which will be a great deal of trouble… At that point… I’m afraid it will be a grievous blow.”

“Even if we survive this calamity, when the north pushes south again, I fear we will lose territory once more.”

His words were tactful but realistic. With Wang Ziya’s appearance, given the current strength of both sides, the already struggling Great Song was instantly at a disadvantage. If not for the fact that everyone knew the Underworld stood behind the Yang family, they might as well declare the nation on the verge of collapse!

But Yang Ruiyi was calm.

“It’s of no concern. The grand formation at Tangdao is formidable. With our main forces stationed here, their troops will not dare to retreat. With Liu Bai holding the Guzhou Cauldron, holding out for a few months will not be difficult.”

As he said this, the divine ability masters present all agreed, though they exchanged bewildered glances in secret. Before they could say more, another report came from below.

“There is movement at the Western Mountains… It appears to be Western Shu deploying troops, with the intent of invading the east!”

None of the previous news had shaken the grand general in the slightest, but this report sent him into a sudden rage. He gritted his teeth.

“It’s Qing Jifang again! That medicine puppet who knocked his head against Bright Yang! How dare he! Sooner or later, I will make him… I will make him…”

He never finished his sentence, leaving everyone at a loss.

Yang Ruiyi’s heart was truly ablaze.

The Daoist Masters of the Great Song were all worried that the situation was dire and the balance had been broken. They believed that as long as Qi Lanyan in the north was in his right mind, he would press his advantage and push south, leading to a disastrous defeat for them. But Yang Ruiyi knew in his heart that Qi Lanyan wouldn’t dare!

The Great Song’s ultimate trump card, the Great Daoist Master of the Sword Gate, Lingmei, had not yet emerged from his seclusion!

'The purpose of launching the war early was not to strike at the Great Song, but to signal to me that he will wait… wait until Lingmei emerges!'

'Qi Lanyan is already treading on the edge of the Thunder Pool. As long as Lingmei remains in seclusion, the north and south are not evenly matched. He absolutely will not make another move, much less attack Tangdao Mountain.'

For this reason, Yang Ruiyi was not worried about Wang Ziya at all. He was worried about the King of Wei of the Great Song—Li Zhouwei!

Although not a single divine ability master in the Great Song could see through the situation, even the shrewd and cunning Situ Huo who was personally involved only had a vague premonition. Li Zhouwei should have been completely ignorant of the scheme, but Yang Tianyou’s words echoed constantly in his mind.

“He is no ordinary man!”

This made him hesitate. He dismissed the cultivators from the hall. He picked up his brush several times, only to set it down again. He waited and waited in the great hall, but no news came. He drew out a wisp of Exiled Qi to divine the future, but then remembered that neither Ting Province nor Li Zhouwei could be scried.

So he took out a scroll, forced himself to calm down, and began to read.

He didn't know how much time had passed when he was suddenly startled awake. Sensing something, his expression changed dramatically. He walked down quickly, crossed the hall, and looked up. His gray-brown eyes filled with a golden reflection.

“The Sword Gate?”

---

Myriad Radiance Sword Gate.

Above the sword peak, gray clouds churned and colorful mists swirled. The sea had turned a deep, dark blue, with only an occasional point of escaping light flying past.

On the peak, the verdant qi known as the ‘Auspicious Spring Breeze,’ which shot to the heavens and nourished the riverbanks, had billowed away. Beneath a profound pine that stood like a stately canopy, fallen leaves littered the ground. A Daoist in long robes stood among them, his expression complex.

He carried a sword on his back, his face grim. He had a long face and thick brows, and the golden qi around him was remarkably condensed. This was the Cheng family’s Daoist Master from the Sword Gate—Cheng Jiuwen!

For many years, the Sword Gate had enjoyed a fine reputation, regarded as the righteous path in Jiangnan. But in recent decades, disputes over Daoist traditions and philosophy had nearly paralyzed the sect. As a Daoist Master of the Sword Gate caught in the middle of it all, Cheng Jiuwen’s reputation had quietly suffered.

He seemed completely unconcerned, always doing as he pleased, and rarely appeared before the cultivators of Jiangnan. But now, this Daoist Master, who was usually either in seclusion or traveling, stood silently beneath the tree.

He looked up. The pine needles rustled, carrying a light fragrance on the breeze. He spoke.

“Senior Heaven's Horn…”

Cheng Jiuwen’s expression was complicated.

“I’m afraid Martial Uncle is about to succeed.”

As soon as Cheng Jiuwen spoke, the profound pine—Jiangnan’s foremost spiritual plant, personally planted by a True Monarch—began to tremble as if to console him. The sword cultivator’s eyes reddened slightly. Patches of green qi sprinkled down from the tree, making him raise his eyebrows and look toward the sky.

Outside the grand formation stood a young man in a black robe with golden patterns!

His face was majestic, his build powerful but not overly massive, giving him an air of profound solidity. His golden eyes were deep and dark. Set against his qilin-patterned golden and black robe, he looked as if he had stepped out of a painting, no longer a mortal man.

Behind him, the massive, mystical, and ethereal image of a Celestial Gate covered in profound patterns had already appeared. Billowing Heavenly Light surged into the sky, parting the dark clouds and illuminating the world.

A ripple passed through Cheng Jiuwen’s gaze. He rode the wind to greet him, raising his eyebrows in a salute.

“Greetings, King Wei!”

Li Zhouwei was quite courteous. His golden eyes met Cheng Jiuwen’s as he smiled.

“I have come to ask for guidance on a few matters. I only hope I am not disturbing you, Senior Cheng.”

“Not at all!”

Cheng Jiuwen bowed his head slightly and led him into the mountain.
