# Chapter 699: Gao Xuanzi

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Li Ximing paused, his hand resting on the jade box. He tapped it lightly and looked at the old man before him, his tone sincere.

"Since our families share such a bond, I must ask—what plans have you made for the future? Please, tell me what you can."

Li Ximing didn't believe for a moment that Daoist Master Changxi was seeking help on a whim. 'His lifespan is nearly at its end. He must have been making arrangements for decades. He certainly has a few cards left to play… and in his original plans, I was never a factor.'

Since the Profound Peak Gate was asking for the Li clan's aid, Li Ximing could not ignore their history. But he needed to understand the situation clearly. At his question, Changxi’s expression turned serious, and he let out a long sigh.

"I won't hide it from you, Zhaojing. My Profound Peak Gate… we migrated from Jiangbei. We don't belong to the Green Pine lineage, nor are we affiliated with any of the ancient Immortal Mansions. As a result, we've faced much prejudice in Jiangnan over the centuries. I’ve relied on my reputation alone to keep us afloat. In truth, there are very few I can call on for aid."

"Now that my time is short, even fewer are willing to lend a hand. Over the past century, I have managed to secure the help of two parties."

"The first is a Purple Mansion sect in the eastern reaches of Jiangbei, east of the Chengyun Gate. It is called the Xuanmiao Temple, presided over by an Elder Daoist Master Qi, whose title is Sumian."

Li Ximing recognized the name. In the last decade, two Purple Mansion cultivators had returned from overseas, establishing two new sects in Jiangbei. One was the White Ye Immortal Sect, and the other was this Xuanmiao Temple.

Seeing Li Ximing’s recognition, Changxi continued, "The second is an overseas mountain called Mount Jingyi. Its master, Daoist Master Xuanyi, has taken a direct descendant of my clan as a disciple."

"I have a few other minor arrangements, but they are hardly worth mentioning, lest I make a fool of myself. Perhaps one day I can arrange an introduction for you…"

Changxi was not close enough to Li Ximing to reveal all his cards, and a general understanding was enough for Li Ximing. He had no desire to meet these allies just yet. Who knew what kind of sects the Xuanmiao Temple and Mount Jingyi were? The Xuanmiao Temple was located right next to the Chengyun Gate—was there friction between them? If other Purple Mansion masters misunderstood his intentions, he could find himself unwittingly drawn into some factional conflict.

"I must first visit the other clans to return their courtesy," he replied. "There is no rush to meet them."

Changxi stroked his beard. "It was I who was being inconsiderate."

Having come this far, Li Ximing hesitated, the earth-virtue dharma artifact warm in his hand. Finally, he asked the question that had been weighing on him.

"I've heard that you were once close with Situ Tang… is there any truth to this?"

The Li family's history was short, but their information network was effective. In the early days, the Kong family and the Situ family were connected by marriage, their relationship nearly as close as that of the Xiao and Li clans. And the Situ family was the Golden Tang Gate—now the Li clan's mortal enemy. How could Li Ximing not be wary?

Situ Ku was still imprisoned beneath Mount Qingdu. If his next move against the Golden Tang Gate ended up dragging in a host of Kong family members, and he had already agreed to protect them, he would be caught in an impossible situation.

His question made Changxi fall silent. The old man studied his expression and said in a low voice, "I won't hide it from you. In the early years, my family and the Situ family were indeed friends. Situ Tang, for all his arrogance, was generous and forthright with those close to him. He held most of the Jiangnan sects in contempt and was likewise ostracized by the Seven Gates. When I traveled around seeking allies, he was the only one willing to see me. We developed a friendship and even arranged a marriage alliance."

"But he was a reckless man who offended countless Purple Mansion cultivators. After his death, I dared not associate too closely with the Golden Tang Gate. The sect fell into internal strife. His sons, though highly talented—two of them even reached the Purple Mansion realm—all looked down on me, despite their outward politeness. Our ties gradually faded."

He understood the enmity between the Li clan and the Golden Tang Gate and had no intention of mediating. He only sought to clarify his position, even offering a quiet warning.

"All cultivators know that Situ Mo has the backing of the Golden Feather Sect. You must be careful, Zhaojing. The Golden Feather Sect has been dominant for three generations. Their power is unrivaled in the Yue State, and they have more Purple Mansion cultivators than they show… Be extremely cautious."

The last thing Changxi wanted was for Li Ximing to pick a fight with the Golden Tang Gate. The Profound Peak Gate was already in a precarious state; if the Li clan collapsed while trying to help, his own sect's fate would be even worse.

"Thank you for the reminder, Elder," Li Ximing said, nodding gravely. He weighed the situation for a moment. The mid-grade earth-virtue dharma artifact, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, still sat on the table. He pushed it back toward Changxi.

"Senior Changxi, the bond between our families needs no further proof. If the Profound Peak Gate is in trouble, my Li clan will help. This artifact is too valuable. It is not right for me to accept it under these circumstances."

Changxi stroked his beard, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. "What do you mean, Zhaojing?"

Li Ximing thought for a moment before explaining. "Our families should support each other as allies on the same path. The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger is a mid-grade Purple Mansion dharma artifact. You should keep it for now and see if you can use it to leverage greater support from other powers. It could alleviate some of the pressure you face. You don’t need to use it to win me over."

"If the time comes when your lifespan is truly at its end and you have no other options, then give it to me. It will strengthen my hand, and I will be better equipped to handle the pressure from all sides."

Daoist Master Changxi was stunned. He seemed not to have expected such a response. He was silent for several seconds before his voice grew thick with emotion. "All those years ago, Tingyun advised against… she said some things she shouldn't have. I am truly sorry, Zhaojing."

Li Ximing knew he was referring to when Kong Tingyun had advised Li Qinghong to give the Radiant Sky Stone to Li Zhouwei instead. He shook his head. "I am not blind to the bigger picture, Senior. It was because of her reminders that I understood Senior Tingyun's earnest intentions. Not to mention the years of support, or how she helped cover for my brother when he got into trouble in the Eastern Sea. I remember all of it."

When Li Xizhi had accidentally trespassed on the Dragon Clan's territory, it was Kong Tingyun who had stepped in, using Changxi's name as a deterrent to quell Chi Zhiyun’s murderous intent. In the end, only Kong Tingyun had ever truly treated the Li family with genuine kindness.

His words made Daoist Master Changxi understand that it was Kong Tingyun's friendship that held the greatest weight. He sighed. "Zhaojing… your clan truly acts with…"

Li Ximing couldn't bear to hear it. He feared the other Purple Mansion masters would label him with the high-minded title of a "righteous cultivator" only to use his clan for their own ends. He quickly cut him off with a smile.

"It is your own foresight in preparing multiple escape routes that gives my Li clan the courage to help. If the situation were so dire as to threaten our own foundation with imminent collapse, I would not dare make such a promise."

Changxi nodded silently. But he knew that if not for the Li clan's sterling reputation, he would never have dared to present the artifact in the first place. Any other Purple Mansion cultivator from the Eastern Sea would have graciously accepted it, then simply walked away after he died.

Changxi's expression grew solemn. He flicked his sleeve, releasing a curtain of earthen-yellow light that enveloped them. His tone shifted back to how it was at the beginning, no longer trying to flatter Li Ximing with the address of 'Daoist Friend.'

"Little Friend Ximing, I will be honest with you," he said in a low voice. "Within my sect, three cultivators at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm are in seclusion."

"Three?"

Li Ximing was taken aback. Changxi's face had transformed into that of an old, white-haired man as he murmured, "The first is my great-grandson, Kong Haiying. I have kept his existence a secret, and he has been cultivating in seclusion since he was a boy, long before Tingyun. He entered seclusion with a Purple Mansion spiritual item, the Roaming Pass Treasured Earth. Although it's not a perfect match for our clan’s Fool's Mountain Chase, it's far better than what most have. He has been in seclusion for over forty years now—too long, otherwise he should have emerged before my time runs out."

"The second is a retainer of our family, Fu En. It was rumored he died overseas years ago, but he has been in secret seclusion for over twenty years. His chances of breaking through are not high; it is merely an attempt."

"The third is Tingyun. She has been in seclusion for fifteen or sixteen years. Her natural talent isn't high, and she was more of a long shot. Though her character is excellent, her understanding of the Dao is shallow. She had the lowest chance of them all. But unexpectedly, she had a fortuitous encounter within a grotto-heaven, and her chances of a breakthrough are now slightly higher than Fu En's."

A clever rabbit has three burrows, and Changxi had clearly made many preparations. Li Ximing now understood why the Profound Peak Gate had so few late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators—Changxi had been pushing them to attempt breakthroughs for years.

After a moment's consideration, Li Ximing felt a sense of relief. If Kong Haiying succeeded, the Li clan's timely aid would be a perfect gesture of support. A sudden realization dawned on him, and he smiled inwardly.

'What an old fox… He probably wasn't revealing this out of gratitude! Even if I had refused, he would have told me about Kong Haiying to tempt me.'

He gave a solemn nod of agreement. Changxi thanked him several times. Suddenly, Li Ximing’s ear twitched.

"My apologies, Elder," he said. "The other guests have arrived at the mountain. We shouldn't keep them waiting."

The two rose into the air on the wind, continuing their discussion in hushed tones as they flew toward the main assembly.

---

"The Purple Smoke Immortal Gate! Kong Yuzi has arrived!"

Li Jiangqian’s gaze swept across the attendees. Beside him, Si Tongyi looked up just as a woman in a yellow, feathered robe descended among the tables. Before he could get a good look, another announcement rang out.

"The Slaughter Jun Immortal Gate! Gao Xuanzi has arrived!"

This name made Si Tongyi narrow his eyes. A murmur of interest went through the crowd as everyone turned to look. A gust of cold air swept through, and snowflakes materialized in the clear sky as a young man appeared at the Slaughter Jun Gate's designated seats.

The young man wore dark blue robes pleated and embroidered with frost patterns, covered by a thick brocade cloak. Sword tassels were faintly visible at his waist, and the collar was trimmed with a circle of fine, snow-white fur that framed the elegant lines of his jaw.

His lips were pressed into a thin line, his skin a touch pale, and his eyebrows were sharp and defined. His eyes were a grayer shade than those of the Li clansmen, and they held an unusual, almost demonic allure, which he quickly masked with a faint smile.

"Hmph."

Li Zhouwei took a sip of tea, his golden pupils shifting slightly. The courtyard was abuzz with lively conversation, yet it seemed everyone was discreetly observing this Gao Xuanzi.

'I've never seen him before…'

'The Slaughter Jun Gate has such a figure among their core disciples?'

'He appears to be a sword cultivator…'

Gao Xuanzi sat down. He was the sole representative from the Slaughter Jun Gate, and the dozens of empty seats around him made his solitary presence stand out starkly among the other delegations.

He seemed unconcerned, however, simply stroking his jade cup as if familiarizing himself with its texture. His gaze traveled forward, meeting Li Zhouwei's from across the expanse.

Both appeared as young men. One with solemn golden eyes, clad in white and gold armor, majestic and imposing. The other with cool gray eyes and pale skin, dressed in elegant fur-trimmed robes, as serene as winter snow. Their gazes locked in the air.

Li Zhouwei's grip tightened on his cup. The man was, after all, a core disciple of the Slaughter Jun Gate. He offered a rare smile in acknowledgment. Gao Xuanzi returned the smile, his eyes filled with approval.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing… has arrived!"

With the representatives from the Three Sects and Seven Gates all present, Li Ximing finally appeared at the head of the assembly. The Purple Mansion masters raised their cups in unison, the core disciples bowed in respect, and the unaffiliated cultivators at the lowest tables prostrated themselves, a sea of bowing heads.

"Congratulations to the Daoist Master on achieving your divine ability!"

The cry shook the heavens, scattering the clouds above. Auspicious mists swirled in the sky. Li Ximing returned the salute, and as music filled the air, the spiritual banquet began.

Changxi had already returned to the Profound Peak Gate's seats. Li Ximing did a quick survey of the guests. Tianque of the Golden Feather Sect, an impatient man, strode forward with a female cultivator named Zhang Duanyan, holding a bluestone box.

The Golden Feather Sect was now the hegemon of the Yue State. Li Ximing rose to greet them, observing the etiquette of a junior.

Zhang Duanyan spoke respectfully, "The Golden Feather Sect presents the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier as a congratulatory gift to the Daoist Master!"

The stone box presumably held the artifact. Li Minggong stepped forward to accept it.

Tianque laughed heartily. "Zhaojing, you are an alchemist, after all. If you ever need any spirit herbs in the future, you must come to me. My Golden Feather Sect is rich in resources. I guarantee you will be satisfied."

Li Ximing naturally responded with polite pleasantries.

Tianque then added, "My sect possesses two Bright Yang dharma artifacts. If you have need of them, please send someone to retrieve them. It will save you the trouble of refining your own."

"I will remember that, junior that I am," Li Ximing replied cautiously.

Just as Tianque turned to leave, Hengli, dressed in his Li-Fire Daoist robes, flew over. Bi Yuzhuang, standing beside him, presented a jade bottle with a smile.

"The Hengzhu Sect offers a portion of Pure Feather Li-Fire to congratulate the Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing felt a touch of awkwardness. The animosity between Tianque and Hengli was common knowledge, and with the two of them here together, the air was thick with tension.

Hengli's voice was rough and booming. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing, there is no need for formalities between our sects! My clan has also studied the art of crafting Bright Yang artifacts. If you need anything, I will personally forge it for you!"

'They're putting me on the spot…'

Li Ximing shook his head inwardly. Tianque had spoken loudly on purpose, and not just Hengli, but nearly everyone present had heard him. Hengli's words were a direct challenge. He was a magnanimous and straightforward man, but also stubborn and ruthless when offended. Li Ximing smoothed things over diplomatically. Hengli clearly had no desire to linger and soon departed.

With those two gone, the rest were easier to handle. Changxi had already told him that the Sword Gate, the Xiukui Monastery, and the Purple Smoke Gate had sent Foundation Establishment cultivators. The representative from the Purple Smoke Gate was the next to approach.

"The Purple Smoke Gate presents the Tome of Adamant Flame Alchemy to congratulate the Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing nodded slightly and raised his cup. The female cultivator, Kong Yuzi, poured a cup of wine for her master and returned the gesture from the side, avoiding a direct address.

As Kong Yuzi hastily retreated, Li Ximing finally had a moment to observe the delegation from the Slaughter Jun Gate. He saw the young man, who likely cultivated a cold-type energy, and found it logical.

'Although Tu Longjian cultivates Molten Fire, the Slaughter Jun's main lineage is the cold energy of the Lesser Yin Dao… so this is not surprising. The young man certainly has an impressive bearing…'

Gao Xuanzi was smiling faintly, his gaze directed toward a nearby table. Li Ximing followed his line of sight and saw Li Xuanxuan, surrounded by a crowd of well-wishers. Music swirled around them as the old man laughed heartily, downing cup after cup of wine. It had been a hundred years since Li Ximing had seen him so carefree.

A smile touched Li Ximing's lips. He took a step forward and materialized at the empty tables of the Slaughter Jun Gate.

Gao Xuanzi immediately stood and clasped his hands in a salute. His eyes held an enigmatic glint, and his voice was a respectful murmur laced with a smile.

"Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing."

_Translator's Note: The original author included a greeting for the Lantern Festival. Happy holidays to all who celebrate!_

# Chapter 700: The White Ye Immortal Sect

"There is no need for such formality."

Something in Gao Xuanzi’s tone felt strangely familiar to Li Ximing. He could tell the man’s congratulations were sincere, far more so than the representatives from the other sects. He supposed that since Tu Longjian considered himself a junior to Li Yuanjiao, the Slaughter Jun Gate was genuinely pleased to see him reach the Purple Mansion Realm.

Gao Xuanzi picked up a jade box from the table. Li Minggong quickly stepped forward to receive it as Gao Xuanzi spoke respectfully.

"My master has prepared a copy of the _Art of Wondrous Transformations_ to congratulate you."

The technique didn't sound particularly profound, but the gesture was what mattered. The gift itself wasn't as important as the sentiment behind it. "Please extend my gratitude to Senior Junjian," Li Ximing replied. "I have not forgotten his kindness in the matter of the Radiant Sky Stone. Without his aid back then, I would not be where I am today."

Gao Xuanzi returned the salute and promptly withdrew, unwilling to say more in front of so many onlookers.

Li Ximing took a step, and another man approached, carrying a cup. His eyes were bright, and a spear was strapped to his back. He had a handsome, refined face and was dressed in practical attire. "Zhong Qian, on behalf of the Chengyun Gate, congratulates the Daoist Master!" he said with a smile. "We present a set of White Shadow Gold Buckles!"

Li Ximing recognized him at once. This was the same Zhong Qian that Li Xuanfeng had befriended years ago, and he was no simple character. "So, it is Sect Master Zhong," he said, giving a slight wave of his hand.

"You flatter me!" Zhong Qian, older now, had a more grounded and steady presence. He bowed. "I was in seclusion for the past few years, and my subordinates were left unsupervised. Fortunately, they knew their limits and did nothing too reckless. I have come today to offer my apologies."

The Brahma Cloud Cave might have had ill intentions, but they had never crossed the line. Since Zhong Qian was the sect master, a familiar face, and had come to apologize in person, Li Ximing saw no reason to press the matter. He simply had Li Minggong accept the gift.

"My late grand-uncle once mentioned you," Li Ximing said. "He praised your exceptional talent and believed you had the potential to reach the Purple Mansion Realm one day."

Zhong Qian murmured his thanks. At another table, An Siwei’s voice reached Li Zhouwei’s ears.

"Clan Head, Gao Xuanzi is taking his leave."

Like the others whose Daoist Masters had not attended, Gao Xuanzi was departing early. His actions, and by extension, the Slaughter Jun Gate’s, were not impolite. The sect was situated at the border of the Wu, Yue, and Southern Borderlands territories and wasn't truly considered a Yue State sect. They didn't even have to attend; their presence was purely a nod to Tu Longjian’s personal relationship with the Li clan.

The sects of the Wu State all answered to Mount Changhuai, whose authority far surpassed that of the Golden Feather Sect in Yue. Consequently, Wu State sects rarely associated with those from Yue. The Slaughter Jun Gate maintained a cool neutrality, never aligning with any power.

Thus, Gao Xuanzi’s attendance was a significant show of respect. Li Zhouwei made a point of rising from his seat and personally escorting him out of the courtyard. As they walked, Gao Xuanzi adjusted his robes and asked a few questions with a smile.

Li Zhouwei studied him discreetly. Once they had passed through the dense woods and reached the Changxi Gate, the warm, festive air of the banquet faded, replaced by a cool breeze. The young man spoke up.

"Thank you for seeing me out, Clan Head. My master wishes to avoid complications, so please, go no further. The Changxi Gate is far enough."

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei understood.

'Daoist Master Junjian doesn't want to get entangled in our clan's affairs. Or perhaps… he doesn't want his own troubles to spill over onto us.'

He gave Gao Xuanzi a deep look and nodded. "If the Daoist Master is unavailable and the Slaughter Jun Gate finds itself in difficulty, please send word to us in the Yue State. Our clan will spare no effort to assist."

Gao Xuanzi just smiled and shook his head. "I too am a sword cultivator. If your clan has any exceptional young sword cultivators, you are welcome to send them to the Slaughter Jun Gate to meet with me. While I would not call myself a Sword Immortal, I have achieved some small mastery of the Dao…"

Li Zhouwei was slightly surprised. The Li clan was known as a family of Sword Immortals. For Gao Xuanzi to make such an offer showed immense confidence in his own swordsmanship.

"Many thanks, Senior!"

Li Zhouwei expressed his gratitude, and Gao Xuanzi returned the bow. His eyes drifted over the Changxi Gate, noting the foundation stones carved from Radiant Sky Stone—simple, grand, and solid, etched with patterns of lakes and seas. The beams above were painted with scenes of snow-covered pines, rosy mists, and rainbows, while the seventy-two ridges of the roof had been dyed with the light of a Bright Yang divine ability, giving them a spectacular radiance.

"This Changxi Gate is quite impressive," he remarked with a smile.

With that, he summoned a gust of frost and snow and soared into the sky, heading southwest. Li Zhouwei watched him go, lost in thought. After a long moment, he flew back toward the banquet. By now, most of the major clans were preparing to leave.

Only the unaffiliated cultivators remained, unwilling to part with such a rare abundance of spiritual sustenance and energy. They sat silently in the courtyard, some drinking, others eating fruit, determined to fill their stomachs before they left.

A few had even begun to absorb the dense spiritual energy on the spot. Several older unaffiliated cultivators, not daring to be too obvious, secretly formed hand seals under the table, their eyes open and conversations flowing as if nothing was amiss, though who knew how effective their efforts were.

Life was hard for unaffiliated cultivators, and even harder for those who abstained from eating meat. The Li clan would not be stingy at such a grand event. Li Zhouwei called Li Minggong over and gave him a quiet order.

"For those at the lower tables who are reluctant to leave, have a pot of spirit tea sent to each of them. Don't let them sit there awkwardly."

Li Minggong acknowledged the order and left. Soon, attendants glided through the tables, carrying jade trays with steaming pots of spirit tea, and a chorus of thanks rose from the lower courtyard.

Li Zhouwei, his observation heightened by his ocular arts, watched from a distance. He saw the older cultivators hastily pour out the tea, wrap the leaves in paper to save for later, and then rise to ask for their empty pots to be refilled with spirit water.

"Clan Head Li!"

As he watched, a clear voice called out. A long-bearded man led a group forward. Judging by their attire, they were from the Xiao clan.

Li Zhouwei found his face somewhat familiar. The middle-aged man was already smiling. "I am Xiao Muyun. Does the Clan Head recognize me?"

Recognition dawned on Li Zhouwei. This was Li Qingxiao’s son, the head of the Yushan branch of the Xiao clan. He was technically an elder, but as he was a Xiao and Li Zhouwei was the Li Clan Head, they wouldn't address each other by familial seniority. Li Zhouwei rose and bowed.

"So, it is the master of Yushan. Have the elders come as well?"

"My mother is with Grand-uncle Xuanxuan," Xiao Muyun said warmly. "She was absolutely delighted! When she heard Daoist Master Zhaojing had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, she was so thrilled she packed her bags at dawn and rushed back to her maiden home."

Before Li Zhouwei could ask more, Xiao Muyun continued, "To let the Clan Head know, I now have the humble honor of managing the thirteen external branches of the Xiao clan, overseeing all the vassal families of Mount Xianyou. The Xiao clan has also prepared a small gift."

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei had an inkling of what was coming and asked politely.

Xiao Muyun produced a sheepskin scroll from his sleeve. "The territory from the eastern shore of Moongaze Lake to the border of Lixia Prefecture… a total of one hundred and twenty-seven clans and sects. As of now, the seventy-nine families in the lands twenty miles west of Crowncloud Peak are all gifted to your esteemed clan!"

Xiao Muyun's explanation was lengthy, but everyone present understood its meaning. Before Li Zhouwei could speak, Li Minggong let out a soft breath, her voice thick with emotion.

"We finally have it all!"

Although the Li clan had controlled Moongaze Lake for over a decade, their hold had never been complete, particularly over the southern and eastern shores.

The southern shore was dense with forests, especially in the Eastern Yue territory near Mount Dali, which couldn't be cultivated. However, the Li clan's relationship with the Demon Caves made this land a source of abundant spiritual materials, so it was valuable even without spirit fields.

The eastern shore had been home to over ninety families during the Jiang clan's era. When the Jiang clan fell, the Xiao clan had absorbed many of them as vassals. By the time the Yu clan took over, only thirty-nine families remained in Milin Prefecture, with the rest further east, almost in Lixia Prefecture.

Neither the Yu clan nor the Li clan had been able to reclaim those seventy-nine families. The Xiao clan had even forbidden the establishment of a market at Moongaze Lake, costing the region over eighty percent of its commercial income.

Now, with the return of these seventy-nine families, the Li clan's territory around Moongaze Lake was finally whole, totaling one hundred and eighteen families—even more than the Jiang clan's original ninety. It wasn't just about reclaiming thirteen spirit mines; it meant the Li clan's influence now extended further, giving them the power to intervene in the untamed lands along the river.

'The Xiao clan is giving too much. There must be a catch.'

Li Zhouwei stared at the unfurled scroll, his mind racing. 'This is to pave the way for the Profound Peak matter.'

The Li clan and the Profound Peak Gate were separated by the wild, untamed mountains dotted with small temples that lay along the riverbank. Most of these were likely vassals of the Kong family. The Xiao clan had acted as a buffer, but by taking this step back, they were placing the Li clan directly behind the Profound Peak Gate.

Li Zhouwei glanced toward the head table, but Li Ximing was already gone. The golden-eyed young man took a sip of tea. After over a decade of putting out fires for the clan, he grasped the implications of the map in an instant.

'It seems Uncle has already agreed to help the Profound Peak Gate. The Xiao clan wants no part of it, which means our clan must give it our all.'

He rolled up the scroll and smiled. "Such a generous gift… our clan is truly humbled to accept!"

Xiao Muyun beamed, and after a few more pleasantries, he withdrew. Music still filled the air, but Li Zhouwei’s mind was elsewhere. He left his seat, beckoned Li Jiangqian over, and sent a private message via a secret art.

"Go and investigate if there have been any recent territorial concessions or agreements between the Xiao clan and the Profound Peak Gate."

The look in Li Jiangqian’s eyes was identical to his father’s. The young man instantly understood the gravity of the decision. As the music played on, his brow furrowed.

'The Daoist Master has decided to take on the Profound Peak Gate's mess… It seems Daoist Master Changxi must have had a backup plan and offered a hefty price. It was an offer we couldn't refuse.'

He responded with a respectful nod and left the banquet as if nothing had happened. Once the decision was made to intervene, he stopped thinking about what a disaster the situation was and began to strategize.

'Kong Yu has a loose tongue and a weak will. He'll be easy to manipulate. I'll start with him.'

…

The night was serene. The scent of gardenias drifted from Gardenia Scenery Mountain on the evening breeze. Sparks of fire occasionally floated down from the fire vein at the mountain's base, which pulsed steadily, breathing out puffs of purple smoke.

A flash of light appeared on the summit, and Li Ximing materialized, his expression somewhat grim.

By now, all the guests who were going to come had come, and all the gifts had been presented. The Purple Mansion celebration could be considered over. The unaffiliated cultivators still lingering in the courtyard would likely stay until dawn.

Li Ximing sat down at the stone table and silently sipped his tea. After a moment, An Siwei landed on the mountain, looking uneasy. He bowed low.

"Daoist Master… someone from the White Ye Immortal Sect is here…"

"Let him come up."

The emissary from the White Ye Immortal Sect had been waiting on Gardenia Scenery Mountain the whole time, never daring to enter the banquet. That was why Li Ximing hadn't seen him. Not wanting to make an enemy so soon after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, he kept the anger from his voice.

An Siwei hurried away. Soon, a cultivator in red robes approached with his head bowed, his legs trembling. He collapsed to his knees with a thud and began kowtowing, his voice frantic and desperate.

"From the White Ye Immortal Sect… this humble servant, Duche… greets the Daoist Master."

Li Ximing's expression turned cold. He instantly understood why the emissary hadn't dared to enter the banquet or even show his face—and why he was now acting like a terrified worm. Three months ago, Daoist Wenhu had come to apologize and had promised that Daoist Chidu of the White Ye Immortal Sect would personally come to make amends!

After all, the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion from Xiaoshi Mountain had openly declared themselves enemies of the Li clan!

Even Zhong Qian, whose Brahma Cloud Cave had done nothing egregious, had come in person as the sect master. Which of the other sects, aside from the Profound Peak Gate who was seeking aid, had sent their leader?

Seeing no sign of Chidu, Li Ximing asked coldly, "Where is Chidu?"

Duche hesitated for a second, his terror palpable. "When Lord Chidu heard that the Daoist Master had achieved a divine ability, he was overcome with fear and rushed here from the Eastern Sea. But… but he was ambushed by demonic cultivators on the way and was nearly killed. He is too gravely injured to travel and is recuperating on a sea island… so… so he sent me."

After blurting this out, he didn't dare look at the Daoist Master's face. He just continued to plead and apologize, clutching the jade box containing the gift, his face pale with fright.

No matter how much Duche begged and pleaded, it did not reflect the sincerity of the White Ye Immortal Sect. Ninety-nine percent of his fear was simply that Li Ximing would strike him dead with a single palm strike. Sweat poured down his face as he trembled.

'Whether any of that is true is entirely up to his word…'

Li Ximing didn't show his anger. "Oh? Then leave the gift."

Duche could only offer the jade box with both hands. Li Ximing didn't even need to look inside. From the way the man didn't even dare to announce its contents, he knew it couldn't be anything of value.

_Click._

The jade box opened on its own. The jade slip inside was dull and unremarkable. A single glance told Li Ximing it contained an unknown technique called the _Sweeping Light Art_. It was of the Bright Yang lineage, but its grade was unlisted, and the text was laughably brief.

Duche’s lips trembled. "Our sect does not practice the Bright Yang Dao. My lord searched high and low to find this technique. Although it is not profound, it has an ancient charm… so he sent it as a congratulatory gift…"

Chidu's supposed misfortune could have been a setup by someone else, but the gift was unquestionably the true intention of the White Ye Immortal Sect. It was exactly the same as the offering from the Changxiao Gate! Both were shoddy, ungraded Bright Yang techniques.

When a cultivator reached the Purple Mansion Realm, everyone, unless they were sworn enemies, would attend the celebration to offer congratulations, the value of the gift reflecting their relationship. Both these sects had sent worthless techniques, but they had specifically chosen the Bright Yang lineage and left them ungraded, only describing them as having "an ancient charm."

'They're mocking me, openly and secretly. They don't care what I think, but they've gone through the motions so I have no excuse to retaliate. Without a grade or a proper name, I have no grounds to act.'

'The Daoist Master of the White Ye Immortal Sect is at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm… I wonder what his background is.'

Combined with the gift, the White Ye Immortal Sect’s malice was plain to see. The story about Chidu being injured was just a lie—perhaps even one this man had invented on the spot to save his own skin.

_Thud._

Li Ximing casually tossed the jade box onto the table. The dull sound made Duche jump as if his soul had left his body. But Li Ximing’s cold expression had vanished, replaced by a smile.

"You may go."

# Chapter 701: Taking Account

The moment Li Ximing spoke, Duche felt as if he had received a grand pardon. Sweat poured from his brow like rain as he kowtowed, striking his head against the ground a full nine times before finally retreating.

“Thank you, Daoist Master, for sparing my life!”

Li Ximing did not bother himself with such a minor figure, but the other members of the Li clan wore grim expressions. At the foot of the mountain, An Siwei refused to even glance at the emissary. Duche, knowing his place, scurried away in terror, melting into the night as he fled northward.

Li Ximing sat in quiet contemplation for a time before a middle-aged man ascended the stone steps. Dressed in resplendent feathered robes, he carried himself with an air of grace and dignity. A genuine smile finally touched Li Ximing’s lips, and he rose from the table to greet him.

“Brother Zhi!”

Li Xizhi smiled and bowed his head, clasping his hands in salute.

“Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing!”

“Brother, please don’t tease me.”

With his own brother before him, Li Ximing shed the imposing air of a Purple Mansion cultivator, reverting to his old self. He pulled Li Xizhi to sit beside him, his voice filled with concern.

“You’ve worked hard in the sect all these years. You and Zhouwei have shouldered the burdens of our clan, preventing any loss of life or land for a decade. You even nurtured several new Foundation Establishment cultivators. It is all thanks to your efforts.”

“The credit belongs mostly to Zhouwei,” Li Xizhi demurred, though a worried look lingered on his face. “I just came from the ancestral hall. Uncle Yuanqin is still paying his respects to our late grand-uncle… but on my way, I saw someone from the White Ye Immortal Sect leaving in a great hurry. Did something happen?”

“Yes…” Li Ximing murmured.

Li Xizhi continued, “Daoist Master Yehui of the White Ye Immortal Sect is at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. He cultivates a rare Dao lineage of the Capital Guard, which makes him difficult to handle. Also, I noticed the Changxiao Gate was not present at the banquet. That sect is truly at odds with our family. Daoist Master Changxiao’s divine abilities are formidable; we must be careful.”

Li Ximing nodded. After a moment, Li Zhouwei arrived on a beam of light and bowed to them both. Only then did Li Ximing push the jade box forward, his brow furrowed.

“This is the congratulatory gift from the White Ye Immortal Sect.”

Both men scanned it with their spiritual sense, and their expressions darkened as they exchanged a look. Li Zhouwei’s voice was grave.

“Reporting to the Daoist Master, Wenhu is still stationed on the riverbank. He has not been recalled to the White Ye Mountain Gate and continues to manage affairs from his cave. This means either the emissary knew nothing, or they have something they feel confident relying on.”

Li Xizhi fell silent for a breath. Seeing that Li Ximing remained quiet, he, as the eldest of the ‘Xi’ generation, spoke with careful deliberation.

“I heard that Situ Ku of the Golden Tang Gate is still at the Mount Qingdu Water Cave. Did the Golden Tang Gate send anyone?”

“They did not,” Li Zhouwei replied grimly. “Situ Mo is a ruthless and cruel man. He won’t care about Situ Ku’s life. Unless you drag Situ Ku to his doorstep, he will continue to play dumb and pretend such a person doesn’t exist.”

Li Xizhi continued his analysis. “The matter with the Golden Tang Gate is still unresolved, and their backer, the Golden Feather Sect, has shown no intention of mediating. The White Ye Immortal Sect is also north of the river and clearly in league with the Golden Tang Gate. Our clan has no foundation in the north. A mighty dragon cannot suppress a local serpent, and Daoist Master Yehui is by no means weak.

“That is the first issue. Second, regardless of Daoist Master Changxiao’s motives, the Changxiao Gate is now our enemy. He is far more terrifying than the White Ye Immortal Sect. He makes no overt moves, but who can guess what venomous schemes he is plotting? Our clan must not act rashly.”

Li Zhouwei glanced at Li Ximing, now Daoist Master Zhaojing, who gave a slight nod.

“What you say is wise, brother…”

Li Ximing paused, then went on. “That man, Duche, is clever. He knew not to enter the banquet hall. Had he shamed me in front of everyone, he would have forfeited his life. I also deliberately received him here on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, away from the main island. Seeing him alone was a way to prevent our clan from suffering public humiliation.”

“But…” Li Ximing sighed heavily. “All of this is merely a stalling tactic. Changxi is on the verge of death. Yehui and Changxiao are in no hurry; they are simply wary of a final, desperate counterattack from him. The moment he dies, the Profound Peak Gate will become a critical vulnerability, and they will find it easy to move against us.”

Li Xizhi was alarmed, his brows knitting together. “So the rumors were true… How much longer does he have?”

Li Ximing exhaled slowly. “He was vague, but it seems to be less than three to five years.”

“That’s no time at all!” To a Foundation Establishment cultivator, three to five years could pass in a single session of secluded cultivation. The news weighed heavily on Li Xizhi. “And the Profound Peak Gate wishes to entrust themselves to our clan… That makes everything even more difficult. We would have to defend the northern riverbank while also managing the untamed wilderness and the Profound Peak Gate.”

Li Xizhi raised no objection to helping. Years ago, when he had mistakenly wandered into dragon territory, it was the Profound Peak Gate that had covered for him. He was merely overwhelmed by the pressure. “We cannot abandon the north bank. The territory of the Floating Cloud Cave must remain under our control.”

All three of them understood the implications. If the Li clan retreated from the north bank of the river, the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion would immediately attempt to encroach upon the northern shore of Moongaze Lake. The combined pressure from Changxiao and Yehui would be immense.

‘The northern shore must not be threatened.’

A Purple Mansion clan that couldn’t even hold the lands of a single prefecture would become a laughingstock. And the Azure Pond Sect, the Li clan’s nominal superior, would likely delight in such a spectacle. The Si family was desperate to see the Li clan humbled, to force them to come begging for aid once more. If that happened, the entire dynamic would change.

The Li clan was not the Xiao clan. Xiao Chuting had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm through a Life Divine Ability, his power was indispensable during the demon calamity, and he was an exceptionally formidable figure in his own right. Thus, he had no lingering concerns and was able to completely sever his clan’s subordinate ties to the Azure Pond Sect. Li Ximing, despite his breakthrough, had left a path of retreat open and had not made a clean break. Li Xizhi had not left the Azure Pond Sect either. Their status was ambiguous; nominally, they were still an Azure Pond clan.

But if they were to ask the Azure Pond Sect for help, that nominal status would become a solidified reality. They would truly become vassals.

A moment of silence fell over the mountain. Li Xizhi finally asked, “Did Daoist Master Chuting give any instructions?”

Li Ximing chose his words carefully. “The Daoist Master hinted that I could sever ties with the Profound Peak Gate. That might not have been his true opinion—perhaps it was a test. But judging by the situation, he never takes sides. It already seems he intends to stay out of this.”

He lowered his voice. “Unless our clan aligns with either the Golden Feather Sect or the Hengzhu Immortal Dao… But how is siding with Golden Feather any different from bowing to Azure Pond? And Hengzhu is far to the south. At best, we could form an alliance, but they have no shortage of enemies themselves.”

Unless it was an absolute last resort, Li Ximing would never consider aligning with one of the three great sects. He poured tea for them and sighed. “Once these three to five years are up, our situation will become dire.”

Beside them, Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and clasped his fist. “Reporting to the Daoist Master… in my humble opinion, while Yehui and Changxiao are waiting for Daoist Master Changxi to perish, we cannot simply sit by and await our doom.”

“Why don’t we take advantage of the time Daoist Master Changxi has left? We can settle matters north of the river first. We can strike a heavy blow against the Golden Tang Gate and the White Ye Immortal Sect, and establish a firm foothold on the north bank.”

Li Ximing nodded. “I understand your meaning. But that would only amount to seizing most of the territory of the two Secret Diffusion sects. Can we truly inflict any substantial losses on the White Ye Immortal Sect? As for the Golden Tang Gate, with the Golden Feather Sect behind them, we can only demand compensation. We cannot act rashly against them.”

“And when Changxi dies, how would we defend such a vast territory? We would lose it in the blink of an eye.”

Li Xizhi remained silent, but Li Zhouwei’s voice rang with conviction.

“Daoist Master! Every step forward we take today is another step we can retreat tomorrow! Even if the lands we conquer fall back into the hands of the White Ye Immortal Sect, they will be stripped bare—a wasteland. That is far better than leaving those resources in their hands.”

Li Zhouwei’s tone grew more intense. “Furthermore, the situation is gradually worsening for our clan. Right now, it is the White Ye Immortal Sect that desires stability, while it is our Li clan that needs change. Chaos creates opportunity. In a conflict lasting three to five years, who knows what new variables might emerge?”

“Whatever the future holds, it is better than doing nothing, clinging to the Floating Cloud Cave territory and waiting for death!”

Li Ximing exchanged a look with his brother and then nodded decisively.

“Good.”

He stood, his expression resolute.

“The affairs north of the river are entirely in your hands, Minghuang! If you require anything, do not hesitate to ask. I will go and see Changxi. We hold leverage over Wenhu, and there is much we can accomplish!”

He gave his sleeve a gentle shake, and an array of jade boxes, stone caskets, and various spiritual items materialized on the table. “These are the congratulatory gifts from the various families. There are several Dharma Artifacts among them. Minghuang, take them and distribute them to Chenghui and the others.”

Li Zhouwei offered his thanks, collected the items, and was about to depart when Li Xizhi produced two jade boxes of his own. “The gift from the Azure Pond Sect is the recipe for the Essence Gathering Pill, which is with the Daoist Master. These two Dharma Artifacts are from my personal collection. They aren’t particularly precious, but they can be put to good use by the clan.”

After Li Zhouwei had respectfully accepted them and departed, Li Xizhi sighed with regret. “It is a pity that I am, after all, a peak master of the Azure Pond Sect. The sect will not permit me to act freely.”

Li Ximing waved his hand dismissively. “You have been wronged, brother. You still have to appease the Si family. Besides… if we were to sever ties with the Azure Pond Sect, when Chi Buzi eventually investigates, the Si and Lingu families would surely shift all the blame onto us. They could destroy our clan without any compunction. It is necessary to maintain this nominal connection for now.”

His expression then turned solemn. “There is something else I must tell you, brother. And this matter is of the utmost importance.”

Li Xizhi’s face grew serious as well, and he leaned in as Li Ximing spoke.

“Yang Tianya broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm decades ago! He has been concealing it all this time.”

Li Xizhi was stunned, looking up in utter disbelief. Li Ximing quickly recounted the entire incident involving the emissary from the Underworld. Li Xizhi listened, lost in thought, and after a long silence, he finally spoke.

“The Yang clan’s ambitions are vast indeed.”

Simply knowing that Yang Tianya had long been a Purple Mansion cultivator was enough for Li Xizhi to connect the dots. From the feathered robe given to him by Yang Xiao’er that had saved his life on multiple occasions, to the talisman from Yang Ruizao that had made Tuoba Chongyuan hesitate, and even the marriage negotiations between the Yuan and Yang families and the sudden shift in the Chi family’s situation—everything now cast faint, interlocking shadows.

“I understand,” Li Xizhi said.

Seeing that his brother grasped the situation, Li Ximing said no more on the topic. Li Xizhi quickly moved on. “Which Daoist Masters do you plan to visit?”

This was a delicate issue, but Li Ximing was prepared. “The first, naturally, is Daoist Master Yuanxiu. The second… I must go see Senior Xiao. As for the third… I find myself in a difficult position.”

Li Xizhi looked surprised. “Senior Tu Longjian…”

Li Ximing shook his head. “Daoist Master Chuting said he does not wish to be involved. I would not be able to see him even if I went.”

Li Xizhi immediately understood and began to list the options. “There is no need to visit the Profound Peak Gate; Changxi no longer cares for such formalities. The Snow Wings, Changxiao, and Purple Smoke Gates are out of the question. That leaves the Sword Gate, Golden Feather, Hengzhu, and Xiukui.”

Visiting the Golden Feather and Hengzhu sects was a dilemma. To visit one would be a great offense to the other. Visiting Golden Feather would anger Hengli, while visiting Hengzhu would offend Tianque. Yet, on the surface, both sects were on good terms with the Li clan.

“Tianque and Hengli are not easily fooled. Visiting the other sects would inevitably breed resentment…”

Li Ximing added, “I could, in fact, pay a visit to the Sword Gate. A record of our own senior’s sword intent is inscribed on their sword stele. If I go under the pretext of paying my respects to his legacy, it would not seem like a perfunctory gesture.”

Li Xizhi was not well-versed in these Purple Mansion Realm political intricacies and offered no further comment, only reminding him, “Uncle Yuanqin is here. We must go and see him.”

---

On Pingya Island, the grand hall was bathed in brilliant light. Li Xuanxuan, dressed in a simple blue-grey robe, sat in the main seat as two figures entered from outside.

The first was a woman at the Foundation Establishment realm who appeared to be in her forties. She still possessed a graceful charm, dressed in a white Dharma robe and adorned with a cyan jade pendant. Her face held the remnants of youthful beauty, though she had deliberately allowed herself to age naturally without using her cultivation to preserve her appearance.

Behind her stood a man in black robes, his bearing heroic. He was also at the Foundation Establishment realm, and while his cultivation was not particularly profound, his gaze was piercingly sharp.

The woman curtsied gracefully.

“Hemian greets you, elder brother.”

Li Xuanxuan hurried to help her up, his eyes filled with emotion as he looked at them. “Sister-in-law… we never had the chance to meet all those years ago…”

“Yuanqin pays his respects to Great Uncle!”

Li Yuanqin was exceedingly polite toward the elderly Li Xuanxuan, who quickly helped him to his feet. He studied the young man, his eyes growing red.

“You look so much like him…”

It was unclear whether he meant Li Xuanfeng or Li Xiangping. Li Yuanqin listened in silence.

“Of the four branches of our family, the youngest uncle’s has long been vacant,” Li Xuanxuan continued earnestly. “Yuanqin, now that you have returned, there is no need to leave again. Take your place, fill the gap in the next generation, and continue your grand-uncle’s line.”

Li Yuanqin hesitated, but Ning Hemian spoke up, her voice gentle.

“Elder brother, my own foolish brother brought about his own demise, and his entire line was extinguished with him, not a single descendant left. Fortunately, my cousin Ning Heyuan left behind an orphan, but he is not yet capable. The Ning family relies entirely on Qin’er for support. At this time… it is truly not possible for him to return.”

Li Xuanxuan was left speechless. He could not refute her words. Furthermore, Li Yuanqin had grown up within a sect and held little affection for the Li clan; he had no personal desire to stay.

As Li Xuanxuan hesitated, a ray of light pierced the hall from outside, resolving into two men—one in a white and gold Daoist robe, the other in a feathered robe shimmering with the colors of sunset. They came to a stop in the hall.

Li Yuanqin immediately clasped his hands to bow.

“Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing, and Pavilion Master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion.”

Li Xizhi would not permit him to bow and helped him up. Having overheard the exchange, he tried to persuade him. “Uncle, the youngest branch of our family is empty. We need you to support it. If our late grand-uncle could see this, he too would wish for you to remain with the clan.”

Li Ximing took up the plea, his tone serious. “This junior is about to visit Daoist Master Yuanxiu. Uncle, you only need to say the word, and you need not worry about anything else.”

Despite their words, Li Yuanqin replied with unwavering respect. “The clan has Daoist Master Zhaojing and the Pavilion Master, as well as Minghuang, Chenghui, and the other Daoists. It is as stable as Mount Tai. Meanwhile, my mother’s clan, the Ning family, is on the verge of collapse, and she cannot support it alone. I am afraid I cannot return. Please forgive me.”

His expression was firm, and Ning Hemian added her own pleas. Li Xuanxuan could only sigh in resignation as he saw them out.

Li Ximing waited in the courtyard. Sometime later, Li Xizhi returned on a cloud of rosy mist.

“That the four branches cannot be made whole,” he lamented, “will likely be a great regret for our grandfather.”

“When Uncle has an heir, we can bring one back—even a mortal child will do,” Li Ximing said. “The coming years will not be peaceful for our clan. It may be for the best that he remains in the Azure Pond Sect.”

# Chapter 702: The Spoils of Ascension

On the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner, Li Yuanqin stood at the rail, watching the dark night wind stream past the vessel’s radiant light. His mother, Ning Hemian, stood beside him. After a long silence, she was the first to speak.

“The Southern Borderlands are stable now. It might be a good life for you, to stay on the lake.”

“It would be difficult,” Li Yuanqin said, shaking his head. “Li Zhouwei is a genius, and Li Chenghui is a hero of his generation. I have neither the strength nor the close family ties to compete. Daoist Master Zhaojing has reached the Purple Mansion Realm, and even if he were willing to acknowledge an elder so much younger than himself, the powers within the clan would never respect me.”

He let out a sigh. “To have a high-ranking elder appear out of nowhere… no one would accept it. I’d be inviting scorn upon myself and would likely be shuffled into some sinecure to keep me out of the way. Once that happened, leaving would become difficult, and I would have offended a great many people in the process. As it stands, my position in the sect is promising. I have the freedom to advance or retreat. Isn’t that far better than staying with the Li clan?”

Ning Hemian knew he spoke the truth. “Li Xuanxuan was sincere, though,” she said with a sigh. “He looks upon you as his own grandson.”

“He was,” Li Yuanqin agreed. “Great Uncle was very warm to me. But he’s only a Qi Refinement cultivator. An old man’s heart is soft, and his words carry little weight. Once I was truly back in the clan, he would be powerless to support me.”

He leaned against the stern, gazing at the bright moon. “The Li clan appears harmonious, but no clan or sect in this world is without its conflicts. Their peace is a result of strict governance, powerful elders still in their prime, and a clear hierarchy of strength from one generation to the next.”

His voice became quiet and thoughtful. “Dark days are coming for the Li clan. It was the clan my father dedicated his life to, so I will help where I can.”

Ning Hemian nodded, then changed the subject. “White Lightning has been delivered to the Southern Borderlands. Should it be returned?”

Li Yuanqin paused for a moment before shaking his head. “No need. In the entire Azure Pond Sect, there isn’t a single person worthy of that bow. Si Yuanli tried to draw it himself and his hand was split open. Let it remain with the sect. If a worthy talent ever emerges in the Li clan, they can come and claim it.”

---

After descending from Gardenia Scenery Mountain, Li Zhouwei saw Chen Yang waiting at the foot of the slope.

“Go and ask the other Daoists to return to the island,” he instructed. “There are important matters to discuss.”

Chen Yang acknowledged the order and sped away. Li Zhouwei flew on a beam of light into the main hall, just as An Siwei was hurrying up the steps to meet him.

“Clan Head,” An Siwei said respectfully, “Tian Zhongqing went into seclusion a few days ago. He’s attempting to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.”

Li Zhouwei was slightly surprised. “He has courage,” he nodded.

Tian Zhongqing was an old retainer, having once served under Li Yuanxiu, Li Xuanxuan’s eldest son. He was now one hundred and five years old. He had spent the better part of his life as a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator and was one of the few non-family members to have returned from Jiangbei.

His chances of success were pitifully low, but if the old man wanted to make one last attempt, Li Zhouwei would not stand in his way. He calculated the time and asked, “It’s been seven years since Li Wen went into seclusion, has it not?”

An Siwei nodded.

The minor branches of the Li clan were not descended from the four main lines and their members generally had less talent. Li Wen was the foremost among them, yet he still hadn’t been able to attempt his breakthrough by the age of sixty. He had taken an Essence Gathering Pill, so his chances were far greater than Tian Zhongqing’s.

‘Seven years is a little long… He must be in danger,’ Li Zhouwei thought with a measure of regret, remembering the loyal, stout man who used to stand guard at the hall entrance with two golden hammers. ‘He cultivated the _Aged Courtly Path Sutra_ and secluded himself in the spirit jade mine. With the prevalence of jade in the world, he should have had a high chance of success…’

As he was lost in thought, several figures descended into the hall. Li Minggong, in her red dress, and Li Chenghui, in his silver armor and black robes, had arrived. Li Zhouwei walked to the main table and picked up a stone box, opening it gently.

Inside rested a small, six-pointed brazier. It was the color of brass and etched with bright red patterns of True Fire. Li Zhouwei passed it to Li Minggong with a smile.

“Aunt, this is the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, a gift from the Golden Feather Sect. It’s a fine Foundation Establishment Dharma Artifact. You should take it.”

Li Minggong thanked him profusely, accepting it with delight. The gifts from the two major sects reflected their status. While the Essence Gathering Pill recipe from the Azure Pond Sect was valuable, it felt opportunistic. The brazier was a truly practical gift.

The remaining gifts were from the seven gates. Excluding the Snow Wings and Changxiao Gates, there were five items in total. Li Zhouwei picked up a jade vial from the Hengzhu Immortal Dao and handed it to Li Minggong.

“These gates were all very thoughtful. This is Pure Feather Li-Fire. Though not a True Fire, it is a Luan-Fire, which is highly compatible with your Pheasant Li March technique. Please, take this as well.”

Li Minggong was now a little embarrassed, but seeing his insistent frown, she accepted it. Next, Li Zhouwei took out an elongated jade box from the Sword Gate. Inside was a Foundation Establishment spirit sword named _Darksea Serpent_.

“In our clan, only Uncle Chenghuai uses a sword… and he’s still in seclusion…” Li Zhouwei could only put it aside for now. Li Ximing had already claimed the _Tome of Adamant Flame Alchemy_ from the Purple Smoke Gate. That left the gifts from the Profound Peak Gate: the Earthen Aegis and the Earth-Treading Boots.

Since the Profound Peak Gate was asking for aid, their gifts were far more generous. Li Zhouwei presented the two Dharma Artifacts. The Earthen Aegis was a shield of coalesced rock, carved with the pattern of a spirit tortoise. The Earth-Treading Boots were ornately embroidered with patterns of heavenly glows, yet they were undeniably Earth Virtue artifacts.

“Rampant lightning is extinguished by earth… Chenghui can’t use either of these.”

Li Zhouwei took the Earth-Treading Boots and gave them to An Siwei. The middle-aged man stared in shock, clearly not expecting to receive a Dharma Artifact. Li Zhouwei stopped him before he could speak his thanks.

“These boots can restore your spiritual qi when you stand on the ground and will also increase your speed. Refine them later. For now, go to the riverbank at once and deliver the Earthen Aegis to the White Ape. It’s a perfect fit for him.”

An Siwei nodded eagerly and hurried out, his steps light with excitement. Li Zhouwei then picked up the gift from the Xiukui Monastery—a talisman covered in intricate patterns.

“This is a Mountain Ghost Talisman,” Li Zhouwei explained with a smile. “It can summon a being with the strength of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. For us, every use would deplete its power, which is a waste. I’ll set it aside for Que'wan. She might be able to learn something from it.”

Li Chenghui, who had been examining it, knew that for him, it wasn’t a matter of depleting its power—he couldn’t use it at all. He just shook his head with a wry smile.

After setting aside the gifts from the three sects and seven gates, Li Zhouwei picked up the _Art of Wondrous Transformations_ from the Slaughter Jun Gate. It detailed a method of consuming Li Fire and Baleful Earth to cultivate a breath of Earth Fire baleful qi that could force hidden enemies to reveal themselves.

“Daoist Master Junjian achieved his Divine Ability through such arts. The Slaughter Jun Gate is famous for refining baleful qi from both Earth Fire and Cold Earth.” Li Zhouwei hesitated for a second. Li Chenghui couldn’t cultivate this either, so he could only pass it to Li Minggong for her to study.

Now, only a single jade box remained on the table. Li Zhouwei opened it to reveal a pair of dark gold, perfectly round circlets. They were no thicker than a thumb and about the size of a palm, radiating a cold, metallic aura.

“The White Shadow Golden Clasps from the Chengyun Gate…”

Li Zhouwei felt a sense of helplessness. He glanced at Li Chenghui, hesitating.

Li Minggong stifled a laugh. “What a coincidence.”

The dashing young man in silver armor and black robes looked equally awkward. He was good-natured about it, however, and simply smiled. “My remnant lightning is grounded by Dui-Metal. It’s fine on a normal day, but if I were injured, the cold metallic energy of my own weapon would turn against me.”

# Chapter 703: The Cultivators of the Floating Cloud Cave

The White Shadow Golden Clasps were ill-suited for him, but Li Chenghui showed no sign of disappointment. “Thunder-elemental Dharma Artifacts are rare in Jiangnan,” he said. “Our clan’s elders have only seen a handful in a century of cultivation. I am content with my Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman. This artifact, however, is a good match for Zhouluo. We can set it aside for him.”

Li Zhouwei had no choice but to put the clasps away. As the lamps in the hall flickered, his expression turned serious. “Bring those cultivators from the Floating Cloud Cave. We’re short on manpower, and we’ll need people to stand guard in Jiangbei after we cross the lake. We can promote a few of them to serve our clan.”

Wenhu and Pingwang Zi had brought back a group of key members from the Floating Cloud Cave, who were then escorted to the Mount Qingdu water caves. They had been left unattended during the recent Dharma Assembly.

“I’ll go at once,” Li Minggong said with a nod, and departed.

Li Zhouwei turned to Li Chenghui. “The White Ape and An Siwei are watching the north bank. I must trouble you, Uncle, to take some men and secure the Floating Cloud Cave’s territory. We must prevent any unforeseen incidents.”

Li Chenghui left as well. Li Zhouwei waited in the main seat, and after a short while, Li Ximing’s form materialized out of thin air at the head of the hall. The entire chamber seemed to brighten at his presence.

“Greetings, Daoist Master.” Li Zhouwei rose to show his respect.

Just then, Li Minggong returned, leading the cultivators from the Floating Cloud Cave. They shuffled forward, heads bowed, their eyes filled with terror.

There were eighteen or nineteen of them in total, ranging from late-stage Qi Refinement to the Foundation Establishment Realm. All looked dishevelled and utterly wretched. Many were injured, their faces as pale as parchment.

“Daoist Master,” Li Minggong announced respectfully, “all the miscreants from the Floating Cloud Cave are here. Thirteen are at the Qi Refinement stage, and five are at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Of the five, three are demonic cultivators, and two are immortal cultivators.”

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. The Qi Refinement cultivators were in better shape, their cultivation merely sealed. The Foundation Establishment cultivators were a much sorrier sight. Their hands were bound behind their backs with heavy, grey shackles, and their necks were locked in white iron collars etched with array patterns, forcing them to stare straight ahead, unable to turn their heads.

Li Zhouwei’s gaze swept over them. Nearly half of the five Foundation Establishment cultivators were shrouded in a dim, murky aura, a clear sign of their wicked deeds. A particularly tall man in the center, who might have once been handsome, had had his eyes gouged out. Iron nails pierced his collarbones, and he lay prostrate on the floor, clearly unable to stand.

“Who are these people?” Li Ximing asked as he took a seat. He had been in seclusion for years and recognized none of them. Li Minggong, however, had dealt with the Floating Cloud Cave for years and knew them well. She undid the restraints on one of the men.

He was a tall, thin old man with the face of a youth and the hair of a crane. A palm-sized indentation was sunk deep into his chest, revealing his furiously beating heart. He ignored his wound and offered a fawning smile.

“This humble cultivator pays his respects to the Daoist Master! My name is Qu Bushi. I was originally a cultivator from the Eastern Sea, invited to the Floating Cloud Cave some years ago to practice my cultivation. I never imagined that scoundrel Fu Dou would be so audacious as to offend your esteemed clan. I am truly innocent in this matter…”

He spoke fluently, but his heart was pounding with fear. Never in the Eastern Sea had he been in the presence of a Purple Mansion cultivator. He kept his head bowed, not daring to look up.

Li Minggong snorted in derision. “This man is from the Eastern Sea. He cultivates the Earth Virtue foundation, the Palace of Concealed Storage. He’s vicious and cunning. In the past, he was full of schemes, but he never dared to face our clan in person.”

Li Ximing’s celestial eye, between his brows, twitched. He sensed that the man practiced a demonic art. He was a cultivator from the Eastern Sea, yet the turbid qi clinging to him was the lightest among the five. “I will not dwell on past grievances,” he said. “However, my clan has upheld the righteous path for generations. We cannot tolerate demonic cultivators.”

Qu Bushi felt as if he had received a grand pardon. He fell to his knees. “Daoist Master! My Palace of Concealed Storage may be a demonic art, but I nourish it with the corpses of those who have died of old age and have been buried for a century. In all these hundreds of years, the worst I have ever done is dig up a few ancestral graves… I have never committed any truly heinous acts!”

He wailed, “My Dao foundation is not suited for combat, and I have no taste for the flesh of the living. While my Yin Virtue may be lacking… my Yang Virtue is unstained!”

His howl was so loud it made Li Ximing frown. There were countless varieties of demonic arts, and it was possible such a method existed.

Li Minggong shot the old man a look. “Are you going to write down your cultivation art or not?!”

Old Man Qu hastily produced a jade slip from his robes. He never carried his cultivation arts on his person, but a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s spiritual sense could inscribe with incredible speed. In a flash, the jade slip was presented.

Li Ximing gave it a cursory read. The art was called the _Earth-Hiding Palace-Storing Art_. He couldn’t tell which branch of Earth Virtue it belonged to, but it was indeed an art that damaged one’s Yin Virtue and required its practitioner to avoid excessive bloodshed. A thought suddenly struck him as odd.

‘If that’s the case, is this even a demonic art? It bears too much resemblance to the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.’

The first demonic art the Li clan had encountered was the _Blood Asura Scripture_, one of the few high-grade demonic arts widely circulated in Jiangnan. Its poison had spread far and wide, with traces found even in Jiangbei, the Central Plains, and the Southern Borderlands.

Demonic cultivation was also known as the Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace Dao. The _Blood Asura Scripture_ was a prime example. At the Qi Refinement stage, one would merge the Shengyang, Juque, and Qihai acupoints into an Diverse Mansion. The physical body would then become a vessel adrift on a sea of bitterness, and all subsequent cultivation would take place within this Diverse Mansion.

Having attained a Divine Ability, Li Ximing’s perspective on cultivation arts was entirely different. He now possessed a profound sense that all paths led to the same destination.

Years ago, he hadn’t thought much of the technique, only knowing that the _Blood Asura Scripture_ required one to cultivate a ‘Asura Ridge’ within the Diverse Mansion to achieve a demonic Foundation Establishment. But now, seeing this new art, he had an epiphany.

‘The _Blood Asura Scripture_ tries its best to obscure its origins, but anyone who reaches a certain level of cultivation can see the truth. In the language of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, it’s simply forming a Dao foundation called the Asura Ridge.’

The _Earth-Hiding Palace-Storing Art_ was far more ancient and made no attempt to hide its nature. Although it also required the merging of the three acupoints, the subsequent path was much the same. Li Ximing estimated that a Purple Mansion cultivator of the Earth Virtue could likely modify this art into an immortal one.

‘No wonder the northern cultivators call the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao the Purple-Gold Demonic Dao, and the Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace Dao the Heavenly Embryo Dao, lumping them into the same category… They truly aren’t that different!’

‘If I were to dedicate myself to studying the art of merging the three acupoints, I might even be able to convert the _Radiant Essence Scripture_ into a demonic art!’

A sudden understanding dawned on him, and he frowned. ‘In that case, a demonic cultivator’s breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm would involve pushing the Diverse Mansion into the Great Void. And since the Dao foundation is already inside the Diverse Mansion, they wouldn’t need to push it into the Shengyang acupoint first, as is required in the immortal path… Could it be that their breakthrough is simpler?’

‘If demonic cultivation has no other hindrances, then right now, only my Shengyang acupoint exists within the Great Void. Everything else can be discarded… which is essentially the same as a demonic Purple Mansion cultivator… The only difference is the name—one is called Shengyang, the other, Diverse Mansion.’

‘In other words… if not for the fact that merging the three acupoints requires blood qi, after the great celestial shift, the Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace Dao would actually be a more advanced… a superior method of cultivation… It would save a vast amount of resources required to push one’s immortal foundation into the Shengyang acupoint.’

As he examined the _Earth-Hiding Palace-Storing Art_, he became almost certain it was a technique from the time of the great celestial shift, bearing all the marks of the Heavenly Embryo Dao branching off from the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.

‘If only I had a Purple Mansion-level cultivation art from the Heavenly Embryo Dao…’

This was a significant revelation. Li Ximing felt as if a fog had lifted from his mind. ‘This means I don’t need to limit my search for complementary cultivation arts to immortal ones. As long as it’s a Bright Yang demonic art… I can cultivate it and master another Divine Ability.’

The prospect of finding other Purple Mansion cultivation arts was remote, but a flicker of hope had been kindled. He looked up and said, “The _Earth-Hiding Palace-Storing Art_ is ancient. It cannot be considered a true demonic art. You lot simply lack the discernment to see it… Minggong, release him.”

Old Man Qu was stunned. He had obtained this art in the Eastern Sea, and as far as he knew, anything involving an Diverse Mansion was a demonic art. He had never heard of something not being a ‘true’ demonic art. But the word of a Purple Mansion cultivator was law. He was overjoyed and kowtowed. “Thank you, Daoist Master! To think I have been wrongly accused for over a century. If not for your guidance, I would have carried this injustice to my grave!”

It was pure flattery, and Li Ximing ignored it. He looked at the other two demonic cultivators. As expected, they practiced the _Blood Asura Scripture_. The turbid qi surrounding them was overwhelming; they had clearly never stopped consuming blood qi. They trembled on the floor.

Li Ximing’s gaze fell upon one of them, a man with a rather honest face. Before he could even ask, the man burst into tears. “Daoist Master, please hear me out.”

He knocked his head on the floor. “My name is Wen Yi, and this is my younger brother, Wen Shan. We were born in the Eastern Sea to demonic cultivators. We began our training at the age of six. We ate rice and meat, and our bowls were filled with blood qi… It wasn’t until we were older and had reached the Qi Refinement stage that we learned what these things truly were. But we were in a land of demonic cultivators, taught by our parents. We never thought anything of it.”

“It was only when we came inland that we realized not everyone in the world cultivates this way.”

Wen Yi saw death approaching and broke out in a cold sweat. His thick eyebrows were slick with moisture, and tears streamed down his face. “It’s not that I don’t wish to do good, but that I never knew of the righteous path. It’s not that I am wicked at heart. I have cared for my parents and been a good brother. I never thought of myself as an evil person. But… I was born in a demonic land, with no one to guide me. How could I have known I was committing a sin? I beg you, sir, to see the truth and give me a chance to start anew.”

His words made Li Minggong frown. The other demonic cultivator, Wen Shan, was stunned to hear his brother speak this way. But on reflection, he realized it was the truth. He quickly kowtowed as well. “We only beg the Daoist Master for a chance to live!”

Li Minggong paused, then said hesitantly, “Whether you knew you were sinning is one thing… whether you are guilty is another…”

Li Ximing listened intently. A somber memory seemed to surface in his mind. He pondered for a few moments, then glanced at their cultivation. Both were barely at the Foundation Establishment Realm, of little use. He brought two fingers together, and a brilliant golden light, the phantom gleam of his Divine Ability, appeared at their tips.

“Go.”

He drew out two wisps of his Bright Yang Divine Ability’s power. They flew like serpents into the two men’s Diverse Mansions, locking their immortal foundations. “The Nine Gates Mountain on the west bank is always short of cultivators for artifact refinement,” Li Ximing said. “I will spare your lives. For now, go to the mountain and manage the fire veins. Supply them with your spiritual qi.”

The two wisps of divine power contained the suppressive force of Audience with the Celestial Gate. They could not only disrupt the brothers’ techniques but also shatter their Diverse Mansions at any moment, killing them instantly. They would only be able to channel their spiritual qi and use their spiritual sense—perfect for supplying the flames of artifact refinement. The fire veins of Nine Gates Mountain were powerful and difficult for Qi Refinement cultivators to handle. The two brothers could manage them, saving the clan a great deal of effort.

“Thank you, Daoist Master!”

The two men rose, their foreheads beaded with sweat. Though they had lost their freedom, it was better than death. They knelt obediently to one side.

Two cultivators of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao remained. Li Ximing’s gaze first fell on an old woman with a rather ugly face, her clothes wrapped tightly around her. A golden qi swirled about her.

“This old one is Jiang Huzi,” she said in a raspy voice. “Greetings, Daoist Master…”

Li Minggong hesitated for a moment before speaking. “Daoist Master, she is also a cultivator from the Floating Cloud Cave, but she spent all her time within the sect and was never seen outside. We have no information on her.”

Jiang Huzi’s voice was ancient and low. “This old one is just a talisman-maker from the State of Zhao. I settled in Jiangbei and am now over two hundred years old. My time is nearly at an end…”

She smiled, revealing yellowed teeth. “The two sects would not have left anything of value for your clan. The young and talented ones were all killed. The ones they left for you… those with some status… are all old, weak, sick, or disabled…”

There was something unusual about this old woman. Not only was her qi pure, but she was also from the State of Zhao and carried herself with a certain dignity. Li Ximing paused. Not wanting to invite trouble, he said gently, “Since you are a righteous cultivator from the north, you are free to go. You may stay here and draw talismans, or wander the lake… or you may leave as you please.”

Jiang Huzi acknowledged his words. Li Ximing’s gaze then fell on the last man—the broad, handsome man whose eyes had been gouged out and collarbones pierced. Li Minggong understood at once and explained, “This is Ding Weizeng of the Floating Cloud Cave. He reached the Foundation Establishment Realm some years ago and is quite strong. His immortal foundation is the rare Palace-Yang Tiger, of the Hengzhu lineage.”

“The Hengzhu lineage?”

Li Ximing frowned immediately. Cultivators of the Hengzhu lineage were exceedingly rare. While there might be some in the north, in the south, they were concentrated entirely within the Hengzhu Immortal Dao. That sect had a complete set of cultivation arts for all five immortal daos, which was why they dared to take the name Hengzhu.

The sudden appearance of a cultivator from the Hengzhu lineage, and a strong one at that, was naturally suspicious. Li Ximing looked him up and down. “Why is he in this state?”

Old Man Qu immediately chimed in. “Daoist Master, this man cultivates the Palace-Yang Tiger. This immortal foundation is well-suited for combat. It can break free from imprisonment, shatter cages, and overcome karmic obstacles through sheer will, striking enemies with a glance… At first, he was chained like the rest of us. But he was stubborn and refused to submit, repeatedly trying to escape…”

“He also had some history with Wenhu, so his eyes were gouged out, his collarbones were pierced, and his Qihai acupoint was nearly shattered… He’s on the verge of becoming a cripple.”

After hearing the detailed account, Li Ximing’s mind stirred. With a flick of his Divine Ability, the iron nails in Ding Weizeng’s collarbones clattered to the floor, and his other restraints fell away.

The man was half-dead. He mumbled a greeting to the Daoist Master. Li Zhouwei, who had been standing by for some time, finally spoke. “Daoist Master, this man is a valiant warrior.”

Li Zhouwei had crossed paths with Ding Weizeng before. For him to give such an assessment meant the man was truly formidable. Li Ximing felt a flicker of admiration. Ding Weizeng, however, circulated his spiritual qi and spoke in a stiff voice. “My Qihai is damaged. My death is near. I only ask that the Daoist Master allow me to return to the mountains, to die in my homeland of Jiangbei.”

Li Ximing stroked his beard, not answering. He circulated the Bright Yang Divine Ability in his hand and sent it flying into the man’s body. The divine power regenerated his flesh and sealed his Qihai acupoint, preventing his cultivation from leaking away.

Ding Weizeng stood there in a daze. Li Minggong had already taken a pill from her sleeve and fed it to him. The man remained standing, bewildered. Qu Bushi, ever the opportunist, smiled. “Weizeng, what are you waiting for? Thank your new master!”

# Chapter 704: A Double Blessing

Ding Weizeng finally processed what had happened. He bowed low, a gesture as grand as a toppling mountain of jade. The Divine Ability had even healed his throat, allowing him to speak for the first time in ages, though his voice was raspy. "Weizeng thanks you, Daoist Master," he croaked. "I will never forget this gift of a new life."

Li Ximing shook his head with a gentle smile. "Your wounds are grave and not yet fully healed. My Bright Yang Divine Ability is not primarily for healing, though it has the power to foster life. Your Qihai acupoint is one of the Three Mansions—not something I can mend with a mere word. For now, I have only sealed the damage to prevent it from worsening."

Li Ximing's own body was formed of pure Bright Yang; he could remake it at will. Ding Weizeng, however, was a different matter. A damaged Qihai acupoint could not heal on its own. It would require a rare treasure, like an Earth-Gazing Bloodstone or the Primal Essence of Heaven Unity. The latter was a form of Purple Mansion Spirit Water, which the Li clan did not possess. They did, however, have half an Earth-Gazing Bloodstone remaining.

But Li Ximing had no intention of using it. 'His Qihai is only damaged, not shattered,' he thought. 'Using the Earth-Gazing Bloodstone would be a waste. All we need is a Purple Mansion cultivator skilled in healing. A brief application of their Divine Ability would suffice. The stone is too precious for this.'

The Li clan did not cultivate with blood qi, making the stone's other properties all the more valuable. Li Ximing treasured it. "I have my own methods for dealing with your Qihai," he said aloud. "As for your eyes, though I have regenerated them, they have not yet been nourished by your immortal foundation. It will take time for you to refine them and restore your sight fully."

"My gratitude, senior," Ding Weizeng said, his voice low and solemn as he bowed again. Freed from his bonds, his true stature was apparent. He was far larger than an ordinary man, with broad shoulders, a powerful waist, and a fierce, bearded visage. He looked like a crouching tiger.

Li Zhouwei watched, immensely pleased. He felt the weight of the White Shadow Golden Clasps in his sleeve and stepped forward to help the man up. "I remember you from the battle on Baijiang Creek," he said warmly. "Fu Dou was trying to kill me, and you fought my clan uncle so fiercely you nearly gained the upper hand. You made an impression. It seems we got to know each other through conflict. Your Palace-Yang Tiger foundation is truly impressive. My Uncle Chenghui will be thrilled when he hears of this."

Ding Weizeng, a ruggedly handsome man, had believed his life as a cultivator was over. He never imagined the Li clan would save him. Now, understanding the turn his fate had taken, he knew what to say. "Greetings, Clan Head," he said, bowing. "In the past, I served a different master. I failed to recognize you and gave much offense. Please forgive me."

Nearby, Qu Bushi, who had befriended him during their captivity, grew anxious. 'This boy,' he thought, 'Floating Cloud Cave is destroyed, and he's still talking about a 'former master.' He's too dignified to grovel or curse his old loyalties. A true son of Jiangbei...'

Li Zhouwei simply helped him up again. Li Ximing observed this with a nod. "Weizeng, go to Gardenia Scenery Mountain and wait there for now."

With his hands clasped behind his back, Li Ximing flicked his sleeve and vanished. But Li Zhouwei was more elated than anyone. He took Ding Weizeng by the arm, led him to the hall's entrance, and said in a low voice, "Worry not, Weizeng. Once you have recovered, we will need you to stand guard over the Baijiang Creek territory in Jiangbei."

The Baijiang Creek territory was home to more than just the Floating Cloud Cave! Ding Weizeng froze, the shock contained within his gaze, not once betraying itself on his face. Li Zhouwei saw this and knew the man possessed a deep composure. A wide smile spread across his face.

Ding Weizeng merely said in a measured tone, "Thank you, Clan Head. I only worry I might offend the Daoist Master on the mountain. Are there any rules or customs I should be aware of?"

"Our Daoist Master is an amiable man," Li Zhouwei replied. "Just be at ease."

Li Zhouwei gestured for a guard to escort Ding Weizeng away. Qu Bushi watched with hopeful eyes. The old man was no fighter, but he was an expert in surveying earth veins and nurturing spirit fields. Li Zhouwei didn't yet know his character well enough to keep him on the main island. "The former territory of the Floating Cloud Cave is in disarray," he said. "My clan uncle has already returned there. Elder Qu, you know their spirit fields well. Please go and lend him your assistance."

Qu Bushi was as cunning as they come. The moment he heard this, he dropped to his knees with a thud. "I have lived a wretched life," he wailed. "Even at the Floating Cloud Cave, I was a weakling anyone could push around. To be valued by an Immortal Clan and given such responsibility… from this day forward, I will follow only the Daoist Master and the Clan Head! I swear I will never have a disloyal thought!"

Li Zhouwei dismissed him, feeling a sense of relief. The old woman, Jiang Huzi, was still standing by. Her aura was pure, and her age was considerable, so Li Zhouwei addressed her respectfully. "Senior, what are your plans?"

Jiang Huzi coughed. "I do not have many years left," she answered. "I only hope to find a small mountain among the families on the eastern shore, settle down, and live out my days making talismans for a modest living."

Li Zhouwei nodded but wasn't about to let such a resource go. "Senior, an art as profound as yours cannot simply be allowed to vanish," he said with a smile. "Have you considered passing on your knowledge and establishing a lineage?"

His words made Jiang Huzi hesitate. She considered it for several long moments before finally nodding. "Since you are willing," Li Zhouwei continued, "I will find cultivators with an aptitude for the Dao of Talismans from the families around the lake. You may screen them, Senior, and take eight or ten disciples. From them, you can choose the most outstanding to inherit your legacy."

Jiang Huzi placidly agreed. Li Zhouwei allowed her to depart on her own, and after the Wen brothers, Yi and Shan, gave their thanks and left, only the Qi Refinement cultivators remained. There was little to discuss. Li Zhouwei picked out a few whose auras seemed relatively clean and sent them to work under Qu Bushi. The rest were led away to the dungeons.

With the hall finally empty, Li Zhouwei let out a long breath. He turned to Li Minggong. "Aunt, we know nothing of that Jiang Huzi's origins. We must watch her closely."

"I understand," Li Minggong nodded. She had gained the most from the Dharma Assembly. The Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier she had acquired from the Golden Feather Sect was a remarkable treasure, and her power had risen significantly. Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment before continuing.

"Though the cultivation of the Wen brothers is unremarkable, we still don't know their true history. They must be observed carefully in the mountains on the western shore..."

With Li Ximing's breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, the Li family had ascended to the rank of an Immortal Clan. They could now openly recruit Foundation Establishment experts as retainers, and men like Qu Bushi and Ding Weizeng would hardly dare harbor disloyal thoughts. The clan's shortage of manpower had been alleviated overnight.

"Aunt—" Before he could finish his thought, both he and Li Minggong looked up in astonishment, their gazes fixed on the sky outside the hall.

In the very next instant, Li Zhouwei transformed into a streak of brilliant light and shot into the air. Across the lake, every Foundation Establishment and late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator looked up, their eyes turning west.

There, on the western horizon, clouds churned in a great vortex at the edge of twilight. From its center, a pillar of milky-white light erupted, piercing the heavens and bathing the west in its glow.

Li Minggong was a moment behind him, stepping into the air. She studied the phenomenon for a breath before speaking in surprise. "Someone at the Purple Mansion Realm just failed their breakthrough to the Golden Core."

"Indeed," Li Zhouwei affirmed, his gaze distant. "It's coming from the direction of Mount Changhuai."

As the sun began to rise in the east, a subtle shift occurred. The world seemed to clarify, as if a heavy, oppressive weight had been lifted from it. Distant sights grew sharper, and the spiritual qi in the morning mist felt fresh and sweet.

Li Minggong looked up, feeling the spiritual qi within her stir and flow more freely. Li Zhouwei's golden eyes glinted with surprise. "The spiritual aura of the entire Jiangnan region... it's changed..."

For over thirty years, the spiritual qi of Jiangnan had been dominated by the Upper Evil Spirit Storage. This atmosphere favored the cultivation of Earth Virtue, demonic arts, Water Mansion paths, and blood qi, while actively suppressing the ancient immortal daos. This had little negative impact on the Li clan; the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was not considered an ancient path, and their recent absorption of blood qi had, if anything, accelerated their progress.

Feeling the clear spiritual energy of the world rising around him, Li Zhouwei looked at Li Minggong. "The spiritual era has only been in place for thirty-odd years. By all rights, it should be at its zenith. For it to shift now..."

Li Zhouwei nodded grimly. "The death of that Mount Changhuai cultivator is no ordinary event. We must consult the Daoist Master."

He dispatched a messenger to Gardenia Scenery Mountain and landed in the courtyard with Li Minggong. He was about to speak when his brow furrowed again. His golden pupils dilated, his expression turning sharp. The mark of the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light between his brows began to glow faintly as he fixed his gaze on the entrance to the hall.

An instant later, the radiant Grand Ascension Halberd materialized in his grip. "Who's there?!" he demanded, his voice like ice.

Li Minggong hadn't sensed a thing. A half-beat behind, she summoned her own flames. Lacking an ocular art, she took a half-step back, shrouding herself in fire as a precaution.

A flicker of grey light pulsed, and a wisp of black energy coalesced at the entrance to the hall, forming the figure of a man. He had a high brow, grey-black eyes, and a faint smile. He looked utterly unremarkable in his simple brown robes, a sword hanging at his waist.

As his form solidified, he quickly waved a placating hand. "It has been many years," he said with a chuckle. "Your mastery of the Radiant Splendor arts has grown truly formidable!"

"Little brother!" Li Minggong cried out, her face breaking into a joyful smile. She dismissed her flames and rushed forward. "It's you! You've finished your seclusion! But why was there no celestial phenomenon?"

The man was none other than Li Chenghuai.

Li Zhouwei's tense expression melted away, and the Grand Ascension Halberd vanished. He offered a respectful salute. Li Chenghuai, looking vibrant and full of energy, laughed. "Elder Sister, have you forgotten? I cultivate the Shamanic Talisman's foundation, _Untraceable Presence_. It conceals my form, hides my aura—spiritual sense cannot find me, and the naked eye overlooks me. One would need a divining talisman to even sense my presence. What phenomenon could there possibly be?"

He paused for a moment, studying their faces. "From the look of you both, it seems the clan's situation has stabilized?"

Li Chenghuai had entered seclusion during the clan's most difficult period, a time when Li Zhouwei was still being hounded by the Floating Cloud Cave. He had been deeply worried, which was why he had come straight to the main hall. But to his surprise, Li Minggong let out a giggle, covering her mouth with her hand. "Little brother," she said, her eyes dancing, "Clan Uncle has reached the Purple Mansion Realm!"

"Oh..." Li Chenghuai froze. A flush crept up his neck as he stared blankly into space. Several long seconds passed. "What?"

Li Minggong beamed. "It happened just a few days ago! All the major families came to offer their congratulations. We had several Purple Mansion cultivators attend the Dharma Assembly in person. It was a magnificent affair! If only you'd emerged a few days sooner, you could have seen it all!"

Li Chenghuai felt as if he were dreaming. It was utterly unbelievable. "Then our clan..." he whispered, "is now a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan?"

"Precisely!" Li Zhouwei confirmed.

Li Chenghuai could no longer contain his joy and burst into loud, incredulous laughter. "You're not joking, are you? Then... what about the Floating Cloud Cave?"

"The Floating Cloud Cave? We destroyed them!"

As Li Minggong recounted the events, an irrepressible smile spread across Li Chenghuai's face. He let out a long sigh of relief. "During my seclusion, I worried constantly about the clan. It took me nearly a year of conditioning before I even began the breakthrough process. It was an arduous struggle, and I was growing weaker by the day. Fortunately, the Essence Gathering Pills gave me the strength to persevere."

"I still had a long road ahead, and success was far from certain. But then, I felt the spiritual qi of the world suddenly shift. In that instant, countless new insights flooded my mind. It was as if the heavens themselves were aiding me, and I broke through in a single, fluid motion!"

"So that's it!" Li Zhouwei and Li Minggong exchanged a look of sudden understanding. "It was the change in Jiangnan's spiritual aura! An event like this might not happen in decades... What a blessed opportunity!"

Li Minggong sighed in amazement. Li Zhouwei was also deeply moved. "On the path of cultivation," he said, "the role of fate and fortune can truly never be underestimated."

He sighed once more, then broke into a smile. "Since you've broken through, Uncle, this is another great blessing for our clan. Aunt Minggong no longer needs to stand guard here; she can now go to Jiangbei... First, however, you should pay your respects to the elders, share the good news, and take over the affairs of Mount Qingdu."

"Of course," Li Chenghuai said thoughtfully. He immediately took his leave to pay his respects to Li Xuanxuan. Meanwhile, Li Zhouwei took out a sheet of paper and began to write with a flourish. 'I must also send a letter to the main sect,' he thought, 'and inform the elders of this joyous news.'

Li Minggong waited by his side. After a moment, an old man approached them. He had a bald head, a snow-white beard, and a sturdy frame. It was An Zheyan. At nearly one hundred and seventy years of age, he had mellowed considerably. He bowed. "Reporting to the Clan Head," he said. "A message from Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The Daoist Master left with Ding Weizeng some time ago. Their destination is unknown."

An Zheyan was one of the clan's most senior and loyal retainers. Li Zhouwei nodded to him, then turned back to Li Minggong. "Aunt, let's you and I make a trip to Jiangbei first."

---

"Great-Grandfather... Great-Grandfather, you needn't see me out..." Li Chenghuai said as he emerged from the hall. But Li Xuanxuan, beaming, held fast to his hand and walked him all the way to the entrance. This string of joyous news had brought a healthy, ruddy glow to the old man's face, making him look years younger.

"Huai'er," the old man said, his voice thick with emotion, "your father was always the most sensible of his generation. Now that you've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, he would be so, so proud..."

Li Xuanxuan rambled on, lost in memory, and Li Chenghuai listened in silence. The old man pulled him aside and took a brocade box from his robes. "Huai'er," he whispered, "when Ximing achieved his Divine Ability, your parents came back to visit. Xiao'er came to see me as well. You, however, were in seclusion and missed them. They only met with Zhouluo... they had a good talk and gave him many spiritual treasures."

"Your father left this with me for you," he continued, opening the box. "It is a Supreme Feather Night-robe. Dharma Artifacts for Upper Shamans are exceedingly rare; he spent years searching for this one. He said that if you succeeded in your breakthrough, it was to be yours. If you failed, it would go to Zhouluo."

Li Chenghuai's gaze lingered on the robe, and he let out a slow breath. Li Xuanxuan then added, "Your mother also came to see me privately. She left this for you—a Secret Talisman of the Night Ghost. It's a direct-lineage heirloom of the Yang family. I don't know what it does, but she wanted you to have it..."

Both items lay within the brocade box. Li Chenghuai accepted it in silence. A pang of pity went through Li Xuanxuan. "For many years... your father could barely ensure his own safety, and he's not a man of many words. Your mother, as a direct heir of the Yang family, has always had her hands tied. You must not blame them... Now, with Ximing's breakthrough, and your father as the Master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, he finally has the power to help you. But he would find it hard to say these things himself."

Li Chenghuai shook his head. "It was never about the Dharma Artifacts."

Li Xuanxuan patted his shoulder. "There is nothing that cannot be resolved between a father and son. Look at me... I lost my own father at birth, my mother in my youth, and my own sons in my middle years. Now, in my old age, I tend to their graves. Even your Uncle Ximing, for all his power, carries this same regret... Cherish your family."

"Now, both you and your father are Foundation Establishment cultivators. Others would be green with envy... For now, go and see to the affairs of Mount Qingdu. After a few days, you should take a trip to the Azure Pond Sect."

Li Chenghuai tucked the brocade box into his sleeve and took his leave, his voice thick. He took a moment to compose himself before silently riding the wind across the lake.

He replayed the words of Li Xuanxuan and Li Zhouwei in his mind, and a knot of apprehension tightened in his stomach. '_First, go and see to the affairs of Mount Qingdu_... It seems Zhouluo hasn't been managing things well.'

Not daring to delay, he changed course and headed straight for Mount Qingdu. Passing through the defensive formation, he saw the flickering lights of the main hall and could faintly hear the sounds of someone grinding an inkstone and turning the pages of a book.

Li Chenghuai knocked gently on the door.

A clear voice called from within. "Is that you, clan brother? Please, come in!"

# Chapter 705: The Shifting Spiritual Aura

"Father!"

Li Zhouluo looked up from his desk and saw the man standing in the doorway. Surprise and delight washed over him as he hurried down from the main seat to greet him. "Father! You're out of seclusion!"

Li Chenghuai smiled and nodded. Li Zhouluo, his face flushed with excitement, led his father to the seat of honor. "Congratulations, Father! This is wonderful news!" Overjoyed, he momentarily forgot his worries. "You've established your immortal foundation! A fourth-grade one at that... and with the Dharma robe Grandfather left you, you'll surely soar like a great roc!"

Li Zhouluo was well aware of the complicated history between his father and grandfather, but having recently met Li Xizhi, he had been captivated by the man's charisma. He felt a sense of shared glory and even saw him as a role model, so he was quick to put in a good word.

But Li Chenghuai was not one for pleasantries. He seized on his son's earlier distraction, his gaze sharp. "A clan brother, you said? Which one?"

Li Zhouluo had no choice but to bow and explain. "It's about Que'wan... Someone in the prefecture has accused her brother of using her influence for personal gain..."

"Let me see."

Li Chenghuai took the letter from his son's hand. He glanced at it, noting that both parties were involved in the shipping business, then flipped through the documents Li Zhouluo had prepared. A scornful laugh escaped him, and he slammed the papers down on the desk with a sharp crack.

"What utter nonsense!" he scoffed. "This is 'abusing influence'? That's 'abusing influence'? By that logic, we might as well lock up every cultivator's family in a formation and raise them like two-legged pigs!"

Li Zhouluo had rarely seen his father so furious. "Father," he said quickly, "there's more to it... If I simply suppress the matter, it will only serve as proof and harm Que'wan's reputation..."

"Of course I know there's more to it!" Li Chenghuai sneered. "What are they saying behind her back? That she was just lucky, that she stumbled into good fortune when an elder passed by the prefecture? I'll bet the people jealous of her could line the shores of the entire lake! All this scheming instead of focusing on their own cultivation. Pathetic!"

Li Zhouluo didn't dare say more.

"Have him come in," Li Chenghuai commanded.

Li Zhouluo sent for the accuser. Soon, the sound of footsteps approached, and a middle-aged man in fine brocade robes entered. He saw Li Zhouluo and bowed with a smile. "Greetings, my lord!"

His father was still sitting silently behind him. The man's friendly tone sent a shiver down Li Zhouluo's spine. He quickly stepped aside, remaining silent.

The middle-aged man froze, his eyes finally landing on the figure in the main seat. He recognized Li Chenghuai at once, and a flash of pure terror crossed his mind.

'He reached Foundation Establishment?'

"Li Dongti greets... my lord!"

"So it's you..." Li Chenghuai squinted, recognizing the man as a member of a relatively close branch family. "I hear Li Que'wan's brothers have been throwing their weight around. Is there any truth to this?"

Li Zhouluo, though intelligent, was still young and lacked his father's cunning. But at this point, there was no turning back.

Li Dongti understood his predicament. If he stuck to his story, he might face punishment, but to show weakness now would be a death sentence. "It is true!" he cried out in a sorrowful voice.

As he watched from the side, Li Zhouluo saw his father dip an index finger in ink. With a speed that was nearly invisible, his finger danced across a sheet of paper, tracing a talisman.

The moment Li Dongti finished speaking, a dull _thump_ echoed in the hall. The paper burst into brilliant flames and burned to ash.

"The audacity!" Li Chenghuai's voice was ice.

In a single step, he closed the distance and slapped the man across the face. The force snapped Li Dongti's head back, sending a spray of blood and teeth across the floor. Before he could fall, a backhand caught him on the other cheek, sending him flying.

Li Zhouluo was horrified, afraid his father might kill the man. "Father! Father, mind your hand!"

Li Dongti tumbled several times before coming to a stop. It took him a long moment to recover. He prostrated himself on the ground, mumbling incoherently, "My lord... how can you... enforce the law... like this..."

"Like this?" Li Chenghuai flicked his sleeves. "No need for theatrics. My immortal foundation can discern truth from falsehood." He paused, a cold smile touching his lips. "You... and the rest of you cowards hiding in the shadows... can all prepare for disaster."

**Azure Pond Sect.**

The grotto-heaven on the highest peak of the Azure Pond Sect faced east, a place where the essence of the sun and moon gathered amidst ethereal white clouds. It was the most spiritually dense location in the entire mountain range; the ambient spiritual qi was so thick it seemed perpetually on the verge of condensing into dew on the grass and trees.

Li Ximing waited on the immortal peak for only a few moments before a clear laugh rang out. An elder in azure robes appeared at the mountain gate. He looked vigorous, holding a golden talisman in his hand. "I was wondering which esteemed guest had arrived," he chuckled. "It's Zhaojing!"

That Li Ximing had come to see him first instead of Xiao Chuting was a great compliment to Daoist Master Yuanxiu. It put him in an excellent mood. Sensing from a distance that Li Ximing was waiting respectfully before the gate like a disciple, he lifted his chin, his laughter growing heartier.

Li Ximing returned the smile. Once the elder was close enough that others couldn't hear, he bowed. "This junior greets the Daoist Master! Zhaojing was able to break through in peace largely because Daoist Si Yuanli blocked the demonic cultivators and secured the northern territories of Yue. I am deeply grateful!"

Yuanxiu quickly waved him off. "My friend, what are you saying?" he said, his aged voice full of laughter. "Yuanli is your junior. There's no need for such formality. Besides, it was Li Xuanfeng who turned the tide on the river... Yuanli was merely doing his duty."

Yuanxiu was an old fox, after all. Li Ximing was just glad he had waited until he was close to speak quietly.

"Please," the old man said, gesturing.

The two Purple Mansion cultivators proceeded into the grotto-heaven. Inside, the spiritual qi was so rich it dripped like dew. A massive pool of Pristine Water, shimmering like a sheet of emerald, dominated the space. A potent wave of Pristine Water power washed over them, causing Ding Weizeng, who followed behind, to grimace in discomfort.

Above the pool hovered six magnificent thrones carved from green jade. The dense spiritual energy, mixed with the light of the Dharma, created an almost tangible, iridescent glow that illuminated the entire cavern.

Countless Pristine Water cultivators had likely broken through in this very place. Yuanxiu gestured for them to be seated, but he did not take the main throne himself, instead choosing the highest one to the side.

Li Ximing used his divine ability to shield Ding Weizeng from the oppressive aura of the Pristine Water and took a seat on a lower jade throne. He was about to speak when he paused, his expression shifting. Above him, Yuanxiu also stopped, then let out a cold sneer.

"Qingtangyin of Mount Changhuai has fallen! The old miser was stingy to the very end! He wouldn't even invite guests to witness his Golden Core breakthrough... The old ghost!"

Li Ximing immediately understood. The Profound Light between his brows pulsed faintly. "The spiritual aura has changed!" he said in surprise. "It's too early... The era of the Upper Evil Spirit Storage should be at its zenith..."

The smile vanished from Yuanxiu's face, replaced by his usual stern demeanor. "Early is hardly the word for it," he said, shaking his head. "Zhaojing, have you not noticed? The Upper Evil Spirit Storage has been laughably weak. Forget demonic cultivators... it hasn't even given rise to any special spiritual lands or treasures..."

'I've been in seclusion day in and day out,' Li Ximing thought wryly. 'What could I possibly know about any of that?'

Outwardly, he maintained a faint smile and nodded slowly as the light between his brows flickered. "Indeed..."

# Chapter 706: Yuanxiu's Intent

Li Ximing agreed. Behind him, Ding Weizeng kept his head bowed, not daring to speak. This was a conversation between two Purple Mansion cultivators; every word he overheard was a stroke of fortune. He was inwardly stunned.

'Daoist Master Zhaojing just broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm,' he thought. 'Daoist Master Yuanxiu is a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, one of the most powerful in all of Jiangnan. Why is he being so polite?'

He knew nothing of the intricacies of the Purple Mansion Realm, nor of divine abilities and lifespans. He only knew it was best not to overthink it. As he relaxed, Si Boxiu glanced at him before continuing to speak to Li Ximing.

"There is a reason for the weakening of the Upper Evil Spirit Storage. It began here in Jiangnan. Years ago, Zipei fell. Kan Xuyu was a grand master of 'Purple Qi.' Zhaojing, do you know the metallic Dao name of Purple Qi?"

"I would be honored to learn of it," Li Ximing said with a smile.

Yuanxiu’s expression turned serious. "Its full name is the 'Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence'"

The name alone told Li Ximing a great deal. As he expected, Si Boxiu continued, "The impact of her breakthrough and subsequent death on the spiritual aura of the Upper Evil Spirit Storage was immense. Just look at the word 'Immortal' in her Dao title. And she was a grand master of it. The fact that the Upper Evil Spirit Storage didn't dissipate on the spot can only be attributed to the lingering, overwhelmingly destructive effects of the rain from Chi Wei's downfall!"

The genesis of the Upper Evil Spirit Storage had been the turning point in the Yuan family's decline, when their ancestor Yuan Licheng failed his Purple Mansion breakthrough. His death caused it to rain for days across several prefectures. The Azure Pond Sect had secretly sustained the downpour to disrupt the previous era of Balanced Qi. It was a sordid affair, but Yuanxiu mentioned it with ease, pinning the infamy on Chi Wei and, by extension, the Chi family. Li Ximing immediately played along.

"The weather was erratic back then. The common folk suffered terribly. An aunt from my clan also failed her breakthrough and perished during that rain. She was from the Xiao family, in fact..."

In truth, the Li family had later investigated and found that the rain's effect on mortals was not nearly as great as imagined; it had a larger impact on cultivators, but it was nowhere near "overwhelmingly destructive." The truth, however, mattered little to either of them now.

Yuanxiu smiled. "And now that the old miser is dead, the Wu Kingdom is at peace, and Jiangnan has changed. From the looks of it, we are entering the era of 'Inward Heart Surging Profundity.' It benefits the Ancient Merging and Immortal Daos, closed-door cultivation, and artifact forging. It also suppresses spiritual sense, weakens Earth Virtue, and inhibits demonic arts, while greatly enhancing Fire Virtue powers and clarifying the Twelve Qis."

The Si family's heritage was extraordinary. According to Li Xuanfeng's records, they were descended from the Sima family, a great northern clan. An ordinary person would be lucky to recognize the name of the new spiritual era, and even an immortal sect would likely only know the basics, not such intricate details.

But as Li Ximing heard the description of Inward Heart Surging Profundity, his heart sank.

'Of all things, it had to be Earth Virtue! What terrible luck. The Profound Peak Gate lineage of Changxi's clan is based on Earth Virtue. With this era suppressing it, the already slim chances of those three Foundation Establishment cultivators breaking through have just become even slimmer...'

He wanted to help them, and a new Purple Mansion cultivator for the Profound Peak Gate would have been the best outcome. It seemed heaven itself was working against them.

Li Ximing didn't think this new era was intentionally targeting the Kong family. After all, the spiritual aura had been shifted by the successive deaths of Qingtangyin of Mount Changhuai and Daoist Master Zipei. Changxi's clan was insignificant compared to them, and using one's own death as part of a scheme was unthinkable.

Li Ximing nodded his thanks. Si Boxiu observed him shrewdly. "Years ago, while I was in seclusion, Si Yuanli took care of the sect. I heard that Li Xizhi provided invaluable assistance and deserves much credit. I have not yet had the chance to meet him since I emerged."

"I've also heard that the Yuan family tried to harm him on several occasions. Is this true?"

The question was abrupt. Li Ximing hadn't expected him to sound as if he were planning to settle scores with the Yuan family, especially since Yuan Chengzhao was now a loyal dog of the Si family. He simply smiled. "Not exactly. Those were all Chi Zhiyan's schemes. The Yuan family was an innocent party, and we were on good terms with them in the early years."

Though Li Ximing spent most of his days secluded in cultivation, he had been raised and educated as a potential clan head. He might not be the equal of Xiao Chuting or Si Boxiu yet, but he wouldn't stumble over such a simple political test. The excuse came easily. "Later, some unpleasantness arose from a marriage alliance. The people below love to gossip, and as rumors spread, people add and subtract details to suit their own preferences. It's a common occurrence."

It was a clean deflection. Si Boxiu nodded, appreciating his tact. Having the Yuan and Li families at odds served as a useful buffer for Moongaze Lake. "The Yuan family has an unusual ancestry," he said. "Even I cannot see it clearly. Zhaojing, it would be best not to lower yourself to their level."

Li Ximing couldn't tell if this was a threat or a genuine warning, but it was clear they had a mutual understanding: the Yuan family would remain.

Yuanxiu smiled. "Zhaojing, you hide your talents well. The younger generation is truly formidable."

"Yuanli is in seclusion now and cannot meet you. But the sect's main seat is empty, and that Dantai Jin is an outsider who joined us midway. He cannot command the respect of the masses. When all is said and done, there is only Xizhi."

Yuanxiu smiled faintly. "Why not let Xizhi become the new sect master? It would satisfy everyone and demonstrate our sect's impartiality."

"Absolutely not!"

The last thing Li Ximing wanted was for Li Xizhi to become sect master. Such a position required a corresponding level of backing. It sounded prestigious, but if they were to swallow that bait, the Li family would not only be firmly tied to the Azure Pond Sect's faction but also be forced to clean up the Si family's messes. He would never agree.

"Senior!" he said in a low, firm voice. "My family has never had any designs on power within the Azure Pond Sect! My brother is not suited to be a sect master. It is out of the question!"

"Zhaojing, don't be so quick to refuse," Yuanxiu said calmly. "Putting other benefits aside, the sect master's seat grants access to the Pristine Merging Owl Pool. Within it grows a Moon-Glazing Glass Tree. Consuming its fruit can enlighten one to all Dharmas and greatly increase one's chances of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

He stroked his beard. "You know my time is short. While my situation is not as dire as Changxi's, my end draws nearer each day. If Xizhi is willing to take the seat, a share of that spiritual fruit will naturally belong to the Li family."

"As for the Azure Pond Sect's Purple Mansion spiritual items and artifacts... Zhaojing will not be left out. When I pass, they can all be handed over to the Li family."

Yuanxiu's voice was warm. "Your clan is a family of sword immortals. Zhaojing, would you not like to see the spirit sword, 'Great Snow's Severing Edge'? It rests at the bottom of the pool right now!"

"I also know that the White Ye Immortal Sect and the Changxiao Gate have some friction with your clan. If you agree, I will immediately mediate between the three of you. I will ensure everything is arranged to your satisfaction."

'The Moon-Glazing Glass Tree...'

Li Ximing was silent for a breath before bowing. "Senior, you think too highly of us. My family has always been respectful to the main sect; we would never dare to be so audacious. A Purple Mansion breakthrough is a rare opportunity. Please, save such a treasure for Yuanli!"

"Purple Mansion spiritual items are exceedingly rare, and Great Snow's Severing Edge is a spirit sword... The Li family dare not covet them. Besides... with Daoist Master Suiguan overseeing all, everything should be decided by him."

Would Si Boxiu really be so generous? Li Ximing wouldn't believe this old fox if his life depended on it. Not to mention Chi Buzi was still out there, and Suiguan's whereabouts were unknown. Did Si Boxiu truly have the final say in the Azure Pond Sect?

Daoist Master Yuanxiu did not seem angered by the refusal. He casually poured some tea and took a sip. "So be it. Thank you, Zhaojing, for watching over the north for my Azure Pond Sect. If Yehui pushes you too far and you find yourself outmatched, you can always request aid from the sect. My previous offers will still stand. It would only take a single word."

'If I agreed, not only would I have to face Suiguan, I'd probably have to enter the Pristine Speech Heaven. A single word, he says...'

Li Ximing let Si Boxiu's beautiful promises go in one ear and out the other. Seeing that he was unshaken, the old man simply smiled and looked at Ding Weizeng. "And this is...?"

Li Ximing had been waiting for this. He smiled. "This is a newly recruited retainer of my family. Unfortunately, his Qihai was injured by the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion. While my Bright Yang divine ability can foster life, my lineage does not specialize in healing. I thought I would take this opportunity to ask the Daoist Master for his opinion."

Si Boxiu was a great cultivator of Wood Virtue, and a late-stage Purple Mansion one at that—likely the only one of his kind in the entire Yue State. Li Ximing wasn't one to stand on ceremony. An opportunity not taken was an opportunity wasted. Since he was already here, he might as well ask. It was a small matter, after all.

A damaged Qihai was a death sentence for a clan, but it was nothing to a Purple Mansion cultivator. Si Boxiu heard him out and nodded with a smile. "When it comes to healing, 'Valley Water' is first. Below that come 'Pristine Water' and 'Horn Wood.' However, the Dao I cultivate is a unique branch of Wood Virtue called 'Upright Wood.' It is the union of Jia and Yi wood, hard as stone with properties akin to Metal. It does not foster growth."

Li Ximming nodded slightly. Si Boxiu was saying his 'Upright Wood' was an anomaly among Wood Virtue paths, and his healing abilities were no better than his own. A thought sparked in his mind.

'No wonder Si Yuanli's swordsmanship is so ethereal, with no sense of Wood Virtue. His family's Dao, Upright Wood, is hard as stone and takes on the properties of Metal. A sword is the killing instrument of Metal. It all makes sense...'

As his thoughts churned, Si Boxiu smiled. "If you're interested, you could take a trip to the Eastern Sea. Near the Beihai Sea, there is a Changliu Mountain. The Daoist nun Xiang Chun who resides there cultivates 'Valley Water.' She is a charitable person and might be willing to help."

This wasn't a matter that required him to go out of his way to seek the aid of a Purple Mansion cultivator. Li Ximing frowned slightly. Si Boxiu, reading his expression, chuckled. "Ah, but I forgot the bond between the Xiao and Li. You could also ask Xiao Chuting. He cultivates 'Pit Water' and could give it a try."

Li Ximing's heart eased. After exchanging a few more pleasantries with Si Boxiu, he finally heard the old man speak in a softer tone.

"Zhaojing, since you came to visit me first, I will be clear with you. The Hengzhu Immortal Dao has a feud with the Changxiao Gate, and thus they view you favorably. However, the Golden Feather Sect has its eyes on Hengzhu..."

"I had many disputes with Hengzhu in my youth. Now that I am old, I see things more calmly... but..." Yuanxiu paused, then said casually, "No matter who the Li family allies with, you must not get too close to Hengzhu. It would be dangerous."

It was clear now. The three individuals Li Ximing planned to visit each represented a faction. Purple Mansion cultivators were all shrewd. Having chosen to visit Si Boxiu first, he could not, under any circumstances, go to Hengzhu now. To do so would be to alienate both sides and be left with no allies at all.

'But I had to come to the Azure Pond Sect,' Li Ximing thought with a sense of helplessness. 'Si Boxiu is nearing the end of his life and is naturally sensitive. And with Jiangbei so perilous, I cannot afford to have an unstable rear...'

'Hengzhu is at odds with the Golden Feather Sect and on poor terms with the Azure Pond Sect... who would dare get close? And my Moongaze Lake is situated right between the Golden Feather Sect's poisonous flood dragon and the Azure Pond Sect's sick tiger...'

"This junior understands," Li Ximing said gravely. Only then did he take his leave. Yuanxiu rose to see him out. The moment they left the Pristine Merging Owl Pool, the world felt clear and bright again. They walked out of the Azure Pond Sect, and Li Ximing departed, vanishing into the Great Void.

Yuanxiu watched him go before returning to the mountain. He slowly stroked his beard, musing, "Next is Xiao Chuting. Who knows if that fellow will even see him. Li Ximing speaks well. His fortune is strong, and he is not a fool... just too young."

---

**The Great Void.**

After leaving the Azure Pond Sect, Li Ximing did not immediately head for the Xiao family's grand formation. Instead, he traversed the Great Void, following the flows of spiritual energy until he came to a stop before Mount Xianyou.

A formal visit like this was different from a private one. One could not simply step out of the Great Void into their territory. At the Azure Pond Sect, he had entered through the main gate, a gesture signifying goodwill between the two families. If he had done so for the Azure Pond Sect, it was even more imperative for the Xiao family.

'What kind of figure is Hengzhu, to have reached such a state?' he wondered. 'I haven't heard of him being particularly close to any family, yet he has managed to offend so many.'

This reminded him of something. "When Murong Xia came south all those years ago, he devoured one of Hengzhu's direct descendants. At the time, I just thought the monk was arrogant, but thinking back on it now... perhaps Hengzhu's predicament was already beginning to show then..."

The Three Sects and Seven Gates had always been aloof and remote. Only upon reaching the Purple Mansion Realm did he understand the sheer amount of infighting that occurred within their ranks. As he was lost in thought, a figure approached from the mountain ahead. The man, dressed in a long robe, clasped his fist. "Xiao Ruyu of the Xiao family greets the Daoist Master!"

The middle-aged man had a warm smile and a humble, courteous demeanor—clearly a man of the world. Li Ximing had heard his name before; he had some dealings with his father's generation. He waved his hand. "So it is Market Master Ruyu."

Xiao Ruyu had once been a leading figure in the Xiao family, but it seemed he had made some mistake and was sidelined for decades, tasked only with guarding the market. With no interaction, the relationship with the Li family had cooled.

There was no trace left of the high-spirited youth who had pursued the Golden Tang Gate alongside Li Xuanfeng. All that remained were the deep marks of time's cruel passage. The life of that once-righteous young man had not been smooth either. He had endured different hardships than Li Xuanfeng, and his sharp edges had been worn completely smooth.

He bowed his head respectfully. "My clan uncle, Xiao Yongling, should have been the one to greet you, but he entered seclusion years ago to attempt his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. I can only ask for your forgiveness for having to receive you in his stead."

'Xiao Yongling is attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm...'

Li Ximing was surprised. After a moment of thought, he asked, "If I recall correctly... he cultivates the 'Eastern Feather Mountain' lineage, does he not? Which branch of the Dao is it?"

Coming from anyone else, the question might have seemed like prying into their cultivation secrets. But from a Purple Mansion cultivator, it was a gesture of concern. Xiao Ruyu answered respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, my clan uncle cultivates the 'Capital Guard' lineage from the Ancient Merging Dao. It is a path that has been lost to the Yue State for many years. It was a chance discovery by our own Daoist Master."

It was the first time Li Ximing had heard of this lineage. He committed it to memory but knew it was not the time or place to inquire further. He followed Xiao Ruyu into the mountain. When they arrived before the main peak's formation, Xiao Ruyu finally spoke. "I must ask this Daoist friend to wait outside."

He was, of course, referring to Ding Weizeng. The big man hesitated, looking to Li Ximing. A thought stirred in Li Ximing's mind, and he immediately sensed something was wrong.

'If Xiao Chuting hadn't given a specific order... Xiao Ruyu would never dare to bar my way... What does this mean?'

# Chapter 707: The Dawn of an Immortal Clan

He waved a hand dismissively. "Weizeng, the Daoist Master and I have important matters to discuss. Please wait at the foot of the mountain."

Ding Weizeng naturally complied. As Xiao Ruyu led him away, the burly man, despite his power, felt a wave of apprehension. He was a known figure in Jiangbei, but he had never experienced the grandeur of a true immortal clan. In the presence of the Xiao family, he felt utterly out of his depth.

Li Ximing ascended the main peak of Mount Xianyou alone, his steps measured as he approached the deep pool. This time, no snow fell; the stone path was clear, and the air was filled with a serene, welcoming tranquility. When he reached the water's edge, he found the old man not fishing, but sitting peacefully and sipping tea.

"Zhaojing pays his respects to the Daoist Master," Li Ximing said with a bow before taking a seat at the table.

Xiao Chuting’s demeanor was as unhurried as ever. "There is no need for such formality."

This was an official visit, far different from his previous attempt to foster goodwill. The tea Xiao Chuting served was a pale yellow, shimmering with a potent spiritual energy that marked it as a high-grade brew. Li Ximing took a small sip. While it was of little use to a Purple Mansion cultivator, its fragrance was exquisite.

After a moment's pause, Li Ximing lowered his voice. "Senior... that cultivator from Jiangbei follows the Hengzhu Immortal Dao. Is there any sign of a hidden motive?"

Xiao Chuting had barred Ding Weizeng from the mountain, and Li Ximing’s first instinct was that the man was trouble. But the old man simply shook his head. "Si Boxiu sent him, didn't he?"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing, and he recounted his recent conversation. Xiao Chuting let out a soft laugh. "He suspects the extent of my divine abilities and wanted to test whether I have mastered 'Holding the Ridge.' So first, he mentioned Daoist Xiangchun, knowing you would find it too troublesome. Then he mentioned me, making the suggestion seem casual."

He elaborated, "My path of 'Pit Water' includes the divine ability 'Holding the Ridge.' The water dwells within the mountain, sustained by its source, making it inexhaustible. It has the power to heal and restore life, and it could certainly cure your retainer."

"All he needed to do was watch. If your retainer left Mount Xianyou fully healed, he would know with near certainty that I, Xiao Chuting, have mastered the ability."

"This junior was ignorant of such subtleties and nearly caused a problem," Li Ximing said apologetically, thanking him for the guidance. Xiao Chuting could have easily dismissed the matter with a simple excuse; his detailed explanation was a clear gesture of instruction.

A more serious thought struck Li Ximing, and he frowned. "I wonder, was Daoist Master Yuanxiu merely seizing an opportunity, or did he use his life divine ability to orchestrate this? Would he truly concern himself with such a minor affair?"

"He was merely seizing an opportunity," Xiao Chuting replied casually. "A passing test. Though his 'Carpenter's Measure' is a life divine ability, it doesn't focus on manipulating events. Besides, he is far too proud to bother with such schemes."

It was clear from his tone that he had dealt with countless such ploys over the years; this was nothing more than a trivial distraction. He changed the subject. "Regarding Changxi, it seems you have agreed to his request. Do you know the full story behind the Radiant Sky Stone?"

Seeing the conversation turn to the Kong family, Li Ximing replied, "I know the basics, but I would be grateful for your instruction, Senior."

He knew that the Kong family had only provided information without getting directly involved, but he listened as Xiao Chuting began to explain.

"Years ago, Tu Longjian remained unaligned for a long time. After his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, he entered a long seclusion, seeing no one. It was a clear statement that he wished to remain neutral. Since he had made his name in the Yue State, such an attitude earned him more than a few cold shoulders."

"The incident with the Radiant Sky Stone was engineered to force his hand. When Li Xijun was led to the cultivators from the Crimson Reef Island, it was to compel Tu Longjian to choose between returning the spirit item and siding with the Hengzhu Immortal Dao. He staunchly refused to choose, and so, Li Xijun died."

As Li Ximing remained silent, Xiao Chuting continued, "The role the Kong family played in all this is... difficult to say for certain. Changxi was an outcast in Jiangnan. If an opportunity arose to curry favor with the major powers by fanning the flames, he would not have passed it up. Furthermore, knowing Tu Longjian's character, he likely calculated that even if he couldn't save Li Xijun, the Radiant Sky Stone would still end up in your family's hands."

"He had some ties to the Crimson Reef Island. A solution that pleased both sides was not beyond his means."

Though Xiao Chuting claimed it was "difficult to say," his meaning was clear: Changxi had been a key instigator. He had helped the Crimson Reef Island lure Tu Longjian while ensuring the Li family obtained the Radiant Sky Stone.

'It's even possible,' Li Ximing thought, 'that the Radiant Sky Stone was the payment the Crimson Reef Island promised the Profound Peak Gate for luring Tu Longjian. Changxi simply passed it along to my family as our 'reward.''

He understood now. Without the information from the Profound Peak Gate, the Li family might never have pursued the stone. It was precisely because they valued their relationship with the Kong clan, and because they had followed Changxi's wishes by pressuring Si Yuanli, that they saw the stone as due compensation and decided to act.

Looking back, the entire affair was a web of complexity. His family had merely been the killers; behind the scenes, several Purple Mansion cultivators had been pulling the strings.

'And the Changxiao Gate, who seemed to gain nothing... what was their role in all this?'

As his mind churned, Xiao Chuting took another sip of tea. "Did you accept Changxi's gift, Zhaojing? Knowing this now, how will you proceed?"

Li Ximing fell silent for a moment. Changxi's actions hadn't been intended to harm his family, merely to make their decisions for them. From any objective standpoint, trading a Foundation Establishment cultivator with no hope of reaching the Purple Mansion for a Radiant Sky Stone was a monumental gain.

'But back then, my family was just a noble house. Did we ever truly have the power to make our own decisions?'

He could hardly seek justice for Li Xijun's death. At most, he could hate the Crimson Reef Island. He certainly couldn't voice any blame in front of Xiao Chuting. "The Crimson Reef Island wanted to entrap Tu Longjian," he finally answered. "My family would have been caught in the crossfire regardless. Without the Profound Peak Gate, they would have used even crueler methods. Given their animosity toward us, it might not have been just my cousin who perished."

"This was like someone holding a knife to my throat to force my elders to act. Daoist Master Changxi merely tugged on his sleeve and secured some compensation for us. What he gained is another matter. My family was a minor house then. When a Purple Mansion cultivator offers aid, one does not have the luxury of being picky."

Whatever his true feelings were about Changxi, his words were exceedingly diplomatic, and not just for his sake.

The Profound Peak Gate had fanned the flames, but the Xiao family had remained completely aloof. They had controlled the eastern shore, denying the Li family the right to build a market, and had stood by during numerous conflicts. If Li Ximing spoke ill of Changxi, what would that make Xiao Chuting?

Li Ximing remembered one crucial fact: Mount Xianyou was not the Li family. Though the memory of Li Xijun's death was a knot in his heart, who truly cared? All anyone wanted was a gesture.

His reply elicited no significant change in Xiao Chuting's expression. The old man simply nodded. "You see things clearly, Zhaojing. That is no small feat."

His voice carried a hint of lament. Reaching the Purple Mansion Realm was a glorious achievement, enough to make even the most resolute cultivator swell with pride. And now, it was Changxi who was old and frail, begging for help.

After a moment, Xiao Chuting smiled. "As for your retainer, you can ask Changxi. He will have a way."

Li Ximing offered his thanks. As their conversation wound down, and it seemed his visit was nearing its end, he recalled Si Boxiu's parting words. "Senior, you have supported the Xiao family alone in Jiangnan for so long. You must have infringed upon the interests of many Purple Mansion cultivators. Are there any misunderstandings with other Daoist Masters that I should be aware of?"

He was asking about Xiao Chuting's enemies. The old man understood at once, but his reply was nonchalant. "I keep to myself in Jiangnan. No one would believe you and I have formed an alliance. You need not worry. Go on now."

---

**Moongaze Lake, Vermillion Bud Pavilion.**

The bluestone lantern stands cast a hazy glow, their light reflecting on the ink-black surface of the lake. The night was deep.

Li Quewan concluded her cultivation and stood for a moment in the pavilion. Since her Daoist Master's breakthrough, the Bright Yang in the sky above the lake had become too potent and unstable. It was better to cultivate her Whole Pill in the dead of night. She had thus shifted her schedule, and now, as she finished, the world was shrouded in darkness.

"Sister Quewan!"

She had barely begun to rest when a figure on a flying shuttle zipped across the lake and landed beside her. It was a distant cousin from her own branch of the family who usually cultivated on the main island. Li Queyi was younger than her, dressed in a pink skirt, with a round face and delicate ears that gave her a refined, lovely appearance. She smiled brightly. "Congratulations, sister! Your brothers have all been released!"

"What?!"

Li Quewan's heart had been heavy with worry, expecting a summons to Mount Qingdu. The news was so unexpectedly good that a fleeting look of joy crossed her face, quickly replaced by a flicker of unease. "How was the interrogation handled?"

She understood why Li Zhouwei had delayed, and she feared he might simply quash the matter without a proper investigation, which would only harm her in the long run.

But Li Queyi just smiled. "Don't worry, sister! Grand-uncle Chenghuai successfully broke through and has taken charge of Mount Qingdu. He used a truth-discerning talisman from his 'Untraceable Presence' lineage to expose all of Li Dongdi's lies! The rumors have collapsed on their own!"

A slow, genuine smile spread across Li Quewan's face. "Grand-uncle succeeded in his breakthrough? That's wonderful news!"

Li Queyi paused for a moment before adding, "Dozens of people involved have been captured, from outside families and branch lineages, even some from the main line. They've all been taken to the Water Cave on Mount Qingdu."

Li Quewan's joy quickly faded. She spoke softly, "I entered the main island and rose to stand with the Young Lord, despite coming from a branch family. It's only natural that there would be gossip and jealousy. We shouldn't be too harsh. If it causes chaos within the clan, the fault will ultimately be mine."

Li Queyi, who was also from the main line of the First Branch and was very close to Li Quewan, stared. A sense of injustice had long simmered within her, and her delicate eyebrows furrowed. "Sister, you think too highly of them. They're just insignificant nobodies."

Li Quewan simply shook her head. She rose from her seat in the pavilion, intending to go to Mount Qingdu to pay her respects to Li Chenghuai. But before she could leave, a man in black robes descended on the wind, landing before her. It was Chen Yang.

"Greetings, my lady," Chen Yang said with a cupped-fist salute. Without waiting for a reply, he stated gravely, "The Clan Head summons you. Please follow me to the island at once."

Not daring to delay, Li Quewan flew with him. As she arrived at the main hall on the island, she saw two youths waiting outside. One was dressed practically, with an ordinary face. The one beside him, however, was built for battle, with a bold and resolute air, thick eyebrows, and a suit of armor. Both had golden eyes.

"Greetings, Clan Sister," they both said.

Li Quewan quickly nodded in return. They were the Second Young Lord, Li Jianglong, and the Third Young Lord, Li Jiangxia. Both were younger than her, only eighteen or nineteen, and both cultivated the Bright Yang arts.

The Fourth Young Lord, Li Jiangliang, was still a child, but these two were formidable figures. Li Jianglong was known in the clan for his magnanimity and foresight, while Li Jiangxia had held a position of authority for some time, having recently returned from managing affairs on the eastern shore for the Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly.

Upon seeing Li Quewan, Li Jiangxia laughed heartily. "It's been many years, Clan Sister! A pity the Xiao family has returned the lands east of the shore. I will likely have to bid Father farewell and go back to take charge. There won't be much time to chat!"

Li Jiangxia was noticeably more outgoing than his brother, with a more striking presence and a more ruthless approach to his duties. He had distinguished himself early on and was favored by Li Zhouwei, who entrusted him with great responsibilities.

Li Jianglong was more reserved. He inquired after Li Quewan's brothers, and she answered his questions. Soon, they were summoned, and the three of them entered the hall together.

The hall was brightly lit. Li Zhouwei was still at his desk, marking documents with a vermillion brush. The end of the Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly had left a mountain of loose ends to tie up—which families had sent gifts, whose were more generous, who hadn't come, who had left halfway through. It was not a task that could be finished quickly.

He only set down his brush when the three of them approached. His eyes fell first on Li Quewan, his voice low and deep. "Wan'er, the matter within the clan has been settled. I've spoken with Uncle Chenghuai. For the time being, send your brothers to Mount Qingdu. They can work on the old master's talisman peak to keep him company."

The "old master" was, of course, Li Xuanxuan. After this ordeal, even if her brothers were released, their businesses were ruined. This arrangement was more than suitable. Li Quewan bowed respectfully. "Thank you, Clan Head."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "There has always been gossip in the clan—just power struggles between the sixteen prefectures. If it wasn't this rumor, it would have been another. Stay in the Vermillion Bud Pavilion and focus on your cultivation."

Li Quewan quickly agreed. Li Zhouwei then turned his gaze to his two sons, sliding a jade tablet across the desk. "Jiangxia, the Xiao family has ceded seventy-nine families on the eastern shore. Take this token, go to Mount Qingdu to get the immortal registers, and select a few Peak Attendants, Prefecture Stewards, and Guest Elders. Make a trip there and clean things up."

"Yes, sir!" Li Jiangxia's eyes lit up, his eagerness palpable. His brother, Li Jianglong, simply lowered his head, his expression unreadable.

Li Zhouwei picked up his brush again, not looking up as he asked, "Do you have a plan?"

Li Jiangxia answered without hesitation. "I've already thought it through, Father. Besides the tributes, first, we will station garrisons along the eastern shore to prohibit blood-qi consumption, hoarding of rice and meat, and forced mergers. Then, we will establish a market to facilitate trade. Finally, we'll establish a palace in the dense forest to govern the one hundred and eighteen families of the eastern shore."

"Every five years, twenty-four youths will be selected from those families to train at the mountain palace. Their treatment will be linked to their clan's status. Those who succeed in their cultivation can become stewards or Guest Elders in our service. Those who fail will return to their own families to manage their affairs."

Li Zhouwei's brush paused. "And if they don't wish to stay?"

Li Jiangxia frowned. "Then they can return to govern their own families."

Li Zhouwei glanced at Li Jianglong, who had been standing silently. "Jianglong, your thoughts."

Li Jianglong stepped forward and bowed. "Reporting to the Clan Head, my third brother's plan is excellent. The palace in the forest is currently empty and would be perfect for housing the geniuses from these families. However, we should frame it more favorably. Announce that once they complete their training and reach Qi Refinement, they are free. They can request to stay with our clan or on the mountain, return to their own families, or even travel the world as they please."

Li Jiangxia understood immediately. The youth grinned. "I was short-sighted. My brother's way certainly sounds better."

In the impoverished and narrow lands of the eastern shore, how could any of the one hundred and eighteen families support even a single Qi Refinement cultivator? A clan head was the absolute peak. Even if they wanted to return home, they lacked the resources. To protect their families, their only real choice was to remain at the lake.

Besides, the Li family never restricted their cultivators from venturing out into the world. But most would return within a year or two, having learned the harsh realities of life as a rogue cultivator—constantly scrambling for spiritual energy, lacking spirit rice for sustenance, always hiding, always wandering. When compared to the techniques and resources the Li family provided, the choice was obvious. They would come back on their own.

# Chapter 708: The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate

With the decision made, Li Jiangxia reported to Li Zhouwei, took the offered token, and departed, his spirits high as he went to assemble his forces for the eastern shore. Li Zhouwei raised a hand and turned to his other son.

“Jianglong,” he began, “the Profound Peak Gate has requested a marriage alliance. We must send a young woman and betroth one of the brothers. Excluding the youngest, Jiangnian, who do you think is suitable?”

Only then did Li Jianglong bow formally, his tone respectful. “Father, in my opinion, this alliance is merely a gesture of goodwill. The future is uncertain. We should choose one of the younger brothers and postpone the wedding. This will give us room to maneuver if circumstances change, avoiding any future difficulties.”

“As for which daughter to send,” he added, “that will depend on the proposal the Profound Peak Gate brings.”

“This is meant to reassure them,” Li Zhouwei countered. “It cannot be a perfunctory gesture. Your suggestion lacks sincerity.”

Li Jianglong bowed again. “Then I am willing to go to the Profound Peak Gate to cultivate as a direct descendant. This will put their minds at ease. As for the marriage, I implore you to arrange it for one of my younger brothers. I fear my own involvement could lead to disaster!”

Li Jianglong’s reasoning was sound. Once Changxi died, the fate of the Profound Peak Gate was unknown. In the worst-case scenario, if the gate was destroyed, having an adult heir like Jianglong or Jiangxia married to one of their direct descendants would only burden their own children with a legacy of vengeance.

In contrast, Li Jiangliang was still a child. A wedding would be at least a decade away. By then, Changxi would be long gone, and the situation at the Profound Peak Gate would be clear, preventing the Li family from becoming too deeply entangled.

His offer to go there himself, however, was unexpected. Li Zhouwei looked up at his son, his voice deep. “I had planned to give you authority over the dense forest and the one hundred and eighteen families once the eastern shore was settled, and send your brother in your stead. You wish to go to the Profound Peak Gate instead? Are you certain?”

All of his sons were capable leaders. As descendants of the Bright Yang lineage, they were ambitious and had already formed their own factions—a stark contrast to the deferential humility of previous generations. Li Zhouwei knew that even young Li Jiangliang harbored great aspirations. In this new, vibrant era of the clan, distancing oneself from the center of power was a major disadvantage. Li Jianglong's proposal was truly surprising.

Li Zhouwei asked again. Seeing his son bow low, he heard him say, “I have considered it carefully. I believe this journey will greatly benefit Moongaze Lake. I ask for your permission, Father.”

“Very well.” Li Zhouwei gave him no chance to equivocate, nodding immediately. “Go and choose two companions for your studies. I will speak with their Daoist Master myself. When you arrive at the Profound Peak Gate, be humble and cautious. Do not disgrace our family’s name.”

“You have my word, Father!”

Li Jianglong expressed his thanks and withdrew. Li Quewan, who had been listening quietly in her long, cloud-silk dress, found her opinion of him rising. She did not expect Li Zhouwei to turn to her next.

“Wan’er, regarding the eastern shore, who do you think should be sent to govern it?”

“This junior wouldn’t dare overstep… It would be a breach of protocol.”

“Speak freely,” Li Zhouwei insisted.

Li Quewan had no choice but to bow. “Clan Head, the elders are needed to guard the northern shore and cannot be easily moved. Now that Grand-uncle Chenghuai has taken over Mount Qingdu, Uncle Zhouluo is available. However, his cultivation is at a critical stage, and I worry this might hinder him.”

“Uncle Zhouming also reached Qi Refinement a few days ago,” she continued, “and there is also Aunt Xinghan. Both could contribute.”

She couldn’t help but acknowledge a harsh truth: the conflict between the north and south had devastated the Chengmíng and Zhouxing generations. With Li Chenghuai, Li Minggong, and others already assigned crucial roles, the only remaining member of the Zhouxing generation with notable cultivation was Li Zhouluo. After him was Li Xinghan of the First Branch, a quiet cultivator who was rarely seen outside of her seclusion.

As for Li Zhouming, though he was a direct grandson of the clan’s Daoist Master, his talent was lackluster. He was over thirty and had only managed to break through with the aid of a talisman pill, making him less accomplished than even the brothers Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang.

Li Zhouwei sighed inwardly. The Zhouxing generation’s talent was on par with that of an ordinary noble house, but lacked any truly outstanding figures. They had come of age during the tumultuous north-south conflict, a time of instability that not only deprived them of practical experience but also left many of them orphaned, with nothing but a storage pouch to inherit.

The vassal families had fared no better and had yet to recover their strength. The An clan was fortunate to have produced a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and the Chen clan had Chen Yang, with Chen Donghe still at the Jade Court. But the other prominent families of Lijing, despite their outward splendor, were suffering from a decline in talent, their prestige slowly fading.

“Uncle Chenghuai is now at Mount Qingdu, so it would be inappropriate for Zhouluo to enter the dense forest… For now, send one of the old masters to oversee things. Have Zhouming and Xinghan accompany them to learn.”

Having issued his orders, he finally set down his brush. “I will be traveling to Jiangbei in a few days,” he said softly. “I am leaving Jiangqian in charge of clan affairs. I want you to assist him. With Uncle Chenghuai here, there shouldn’t be any trouble.”

Li Quewan bowed her head in assent. Li Zhouwei then took the Mountain Ghost Talisman from his sleeve and placed it in her hand.

“This is a Mountain Ghost Talisman. It holds the power of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Study it. It can also serve to protect you.”

**The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate.**

The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate was located in Jingchuan Prefecture, a region of rolling hills and lush vegetation. The sect’s mountain, Yuchuan Sword Peak, rose from the earth like a greatsword piercing the heavens. From its summit, the Eastern Sea, less than two hundred miles away, stretched out in a vast, breathtaking panorama.

Atop the sharp, sword-like main peak grew a Profound Horn Treasured Tassel Pine. Unlike ordinary pines that grow straight and tall, this one spread out like a magnificent canopy. Its needles, clustered like tassels of emerald jade, marked it as a Purple Mansion spirit pine of the Horn Wood path, famed throughout Jiangnan.

The Sword Gate was a place of quiet cultivation. Pavilions were scattered across the peak, yet few people were about. Only one person came to greet Li Ximing—Cheng Jinzhu, who had attended the Dharma Assembly. With a sword on his back, he led Li Ximing up the mountain. A southeast wind rustled through the pine needles, scattering iridescent light.

The Profound Light in the center of Li Ximing’s brow stirred. He sensed something unusual about the wind, a verdant, life-giving quality that resonated with the Dao of Horn Wood.

“A fine Horn Wood spring breeze,” he remarked.

His Profound Light divine ability could detect anomalies, and he had noticed it at a glance.

“The Daoist Master’s perception is truly profound,” Cheng Jinzhu said quickly. “This is indeed of the Horn Wood path. We call it the Treasured Tassel Spring Breeze. Whenever the wind blows from the southeast and passes through the branches of our Ancestor Tree, it transforms, gaining the power to nourish the people and the land.”

He elaborated, “The wind travels from the southeast to the northwest until it reaches Lake Xian. There, it merges with the sea breeze, turns west, and follows the river, bringing life to Jiangnan.”

‘So that’s it,’ Li Ximing thought with a quiet sigh. ‘No matter how many demonic or bloody calamities the Azure Pond Sect suffers, its population always recovers quickly. This Purple Mansion spirit tree must be a major reason why!’

Just as the thought crossed his mind, a figure materialized beneath the tree. He was a middle-aged man in a Daoist robe, his hair and beard streaked with white. He held a sword in his arms and wore a faint, surprised smile.

“I am Lingmei,” he said. “Greetings, Zhaojing.”

“Greetings, Senior!” Li Ximing returned the bow. The cultivators of the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate were renowned for their combat prowess, and few were willing to offend them. He was naturally polite.

Daoist Master Lingmei approached and made another introduction. “And this is Senior Tianjiao.”

Li Ximing then understood he was referring to the Profound Horn Treasured Tassel Pine before him. He quickly offered a respectful bow. “This junior pays his respects.”

Li Ximing had three spirit trees of his own: a Snake-Dragon Fruit Tree and a Wanling Flower Tree, neither of which had gained sentience, and a Spirit Persimmon Tree from the Quanwu Mountains. Though the persimmon’s origins were far humbler than the other two, it had developed a nascent consciousness.

The Profound Horn Treasured Tassel Pine, however, gave no response.

“The old senior sleeps often,” Lingmei explained. “He hasn’t stirred in nearly fifty years. Please do not take offense.”

Li Ximing nodded and followed him forward. Daoist Master Lingmei gestured for him to sit. “This senior has quite a history,” he said with a smile. “When True Monarch Taiyu cultivated on this mountain, the golden qi he radiated was so intense that it left the land barren for hundreds of miles. He had to plant this tree to shield the area. Later, when the founder of our sect, the Myriad Radiance Sword Cheng Liuxing, became the True Monarch’s disciple, he had to address this tree as Martial Uncle…”

“Planted by a True Monarch!”

Li Ximing was stunned. True Monarch Taiyu was a legendary figure. The power of this ancient tree had to be supreme among Purple Mansion cultivators. As long as it stood here, who would dare attack the Sword Gate?

A clear note of pride entered Lingmei’s voice. “Our swords may cleave the sky and our golden qi may be overwhelming, but we have never brought harm to the people of Jingchuan Prefecture, all thanks to this old senior!”

He led Li Ximing to a table beneath the tree, its surface covered in jade-like pine needles. With a sweep of his sleeve, Lingmei cleared a space and poured tea. “I must say, your visit is quite a surprise, Zhaojing!”

Li Ximing merely smiled and replied courteously, “My ancestors were renowned as sword immortals, their names recorded in Chenghua Hall’s _Myriad Radiance Sword Tome_. Now that I have reached the Purple Mansion Realm, it is only right that I come to pay my respects. Furthermore, my family has practiced swordsmanship for generations, sharing a spiritual lineage and a righteous bond with the Sword Gate. How could I not visit?”

“Indeed.” Lingmei nodded, looking pleasantly surprised. His face was squarish and honest, but his eyes shone with approval. “Our founder once said that anyone whose name is recorded in the _Sword Tome_ is an honored guest of our gate. In matters of life and death, they may call upon us for aid.”

A pained look crossed his face. “Though many years have passed and our founder is long gone, our gate still considers the world’s sword immortals our friends. It is a great regret that by the time we learned of your ancestor’s plight… he had already been slain!”

Li Ximing sighed. “The affairs of the world are unpredictable…”

Lingmei did not dwell on the past. He changed the subject, his voice softening. “Fate works in strange ways. You and I, Zhaojing, share the same family name.”

“Oh?” Li Ximing was taken aback. “Is the Daoist Master not named Cheng?”

Lingmei laughed heartily. “My birth name is Li Mei.”

He paused, observing Li Ximing’s expression, and stroked his beard. “In the path of cultivation, when one person achieves the Dao, their entire lineage benefits. The descendants of cultivators are born with exceptional talent that mortals cannot match. Thus, most sects and clans are built upon bloodlines.”

“But the talent for the sword is different,” he continued. “The son of a farmer might draw a treasured sword of immense power, while the child of a Purple Mansion cultivator might not be able to wield a simple three-foot blade. Our Sword Gate honors swordsmanship above all, so it is common to see Qi Refinement cultivators as Peak Lords and Embryonic Breathing cultivators as Guest Elders.”

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing.

Lingmei went on, “Our sect follows the righteous path, and our core disciples come from many families. The Cheng clan are the descendants of our founder, so they are naturally respected and often represent us, holding the position of Sect Master.”

“A truly righteous path!” Li Ximing praised, finding it hard to believe.

Lingmei, however, looked weary. “Perhaps not… It has its own flaws, hardships only we can understand, though the other sects can see it plainly enough… As I was just explaining to you.”

“Our gate honors those with exceptional swordsmanship and virtue. But how many cultivators are there to begin with? To find someone who excels at both, and also possesses supreme talent for cultivation… you might not see one in a century!”

“As a result, the truly talented often lack resources, while the mediocre squander countless treasures just to take a single step forward. To gain resources, one must first practice the sword, then go out into the world to help the common people and demonstrate virtue. But with the exception of a few geniuses, swordsmanship deepens with age. By the time they have perfected their art, they have missed their window for a breakthrough. This has thrown the entire sect into chaos. There have even been cases of Embryonic Breathing elders enjoying the resources of a direct disciple for a hundred years, only to die upon breaking through to Qi Refinement…”

“That…” Li Ximing frowned at the thought.

Lingmei sighed. “I lived through that era. After I reached the Purple Mansion Realm and took charge, I used the founder’s grace as a pretext to strongly promote the Cheng clan and change the situation. I enacted many reforms and ignored countless objections. That is how we came to see the rise of talents like Cheng Mianfu, Cheng Gao, and Gu Pang…”

“Even so, to this day, most of our direct disciples are weak in cultivation, skilled only in swordplay… or in some cases, possessing only virtue. The mess left behind, the countless bad debts from those who consumed resources without contributing… it’s a reckoning that can no longer be calculated!”

Hearing this, Li Ximing finally understood why the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate—a lineage of sword immortals and successors to a Golden Core cultivator—was unable to contend with Crimson Reef Island and the Chunyi Dao Gate, leaving them floundering in the Eastern Sea. His heart sank.

“The righteous path is difficult,” he said. “It is fortunate you appeared to set things right.”

“It’s too soon to say,” Lingmei replied, shaking his head. “I have not yet changed the fundamental law of selecting disciples based on virtue. There are already undercurrents of resentment against me within the sect. If I were to touch that core principle, I fear they would all go to Chenghua Hall to prostrate themselves before Senior Tianjiao and demand that the _Sword Tome_ be used to execute me as a heretic. How history will judge me is anyone’s guess.”

Daoist Master Lingmei was entirely different from Si Boxiu or Xiao Chuting. Perhaps because the Li family also followed a righteous path and was a clan of sword immortals, his attitude was far more earnest. His cultivation of both the sword and virtue gave his words a steady, sincere weight.

“In any case, your visit at this time has truly helped me. There are many stubborn elders in the sect who hold the Li family in high regard… especially after the Celestial Moon Sword sacrificed themself to slay the Wrathful Manifestation, an act that has been recorded in Chenghua Hall and earned great renown. For this, I thank you, Zhaojing!”

With that, the mighty mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator rose from his seat to offer a formal bow.

Startled, Li Ximing shot to his feet to avoid it.

“However,” Daoist Master Lingmei said humbly, “my family has a rule. We do not participate in the struggles between sects and clans, nor in the schemes of Purple Mansion cultivators. We aided the Green Pine Temple because they sought to retrieve an artifact of their founder, a justifiable cause. Otherwise, our gate would not have acted… If you have other intentions, Zhaojing, I am afraid you will be disappointed!”

No one who reached the Purple Mansion Realm was a fool. Lingmei’s words were sincere, but he was well aware of the unspoken currents in any meeting between cultivators of their level. His statement drew a clear line. His gratitude might be genuine, but it also served as a polite refusal that Li Ximing could not take offense to.

The thanks had been solemn, but the boundary had been drawn with unimpeachable righteousness. What could Li Ximing possibly say? He had come to the Sword Gate precisely to avoid choosing between the Golden Feather Sect and the Hengzhu Immortal Dao, and he had never expected them to forge an alliance with his family.

He replied respectfully, “Senior, you misunderstand. I have come this time only to pay homage to the sword intent of my ancestors. I have no other motive. I only ask to be allowed to see the true face of the _Myriad Radiance Sword Tome_.”

# Chapter 709: The Vicissitudes of the World

At Li Ximing’s request, Daoist Master Lingmei nodded. He asked Li Ximing to enjoy his tea while he went to Chenghua Hall to retrieve the tome. After a considerable wait, he returned, holding a Daoist scripture in his hands.

The book had a deep blue cover and pages of pale yellow. It was held half-open in Lingmei’s hands, and even when he arrived back under the pine, he did not place it on the jade table.

“Zhaojing, please, have a look.”

It seemed awkward for him to continue holding it, but since such treasures often possessed strange properties, placing it on the table might risk shattering the jade. Li Ximing activated his divine ability and reached for it with both hands. But Daoist Master Lingmei raised a hand to stop him.

“Zhaojing, the _Myriad Radiance Sword Tome_ is no ordinary artifact,” Lingmei said with a smile. “Allow me.”

“If one possesses sword intent, the tome is as light as silk,” he explained. “Even an elderly farmer could tuck it under his arm and walk away. But for one without a cultivation in the sword Dao, it is heavier than a mountain. Even a Purple Mansion cultivator would struggle to lift it.”

Li Ximing smiled back and nodded, his gaze falling upon the tome. Lingmei had opened it to a page near the end. Six or seven pages had been turned, revealing a few small, bright characters:

【White Pear】

The two characters were a stark, snowy white. A few lines down, more small, white characters appeared:

【Imperial Sun】

Following these were even smaller, fly-speck characters that read: 【Pure Yang Sword of the Imperial Sun Spirit】. What came next was a complex series of symbols and phrases, impossible to decipher.

Using his own divine ability, Daoist Master Lingmei flipped through the pages until he reached the very last few. There, written in ancient, cyan-white script, were the words:

【Azure Ruler】

Li Ximing recognized it as the name of a sword. A few lines below, however, the characters were written in ordinary black ink:

【Celestial Moon】

Beneath these two words was a note: 【Autumnlight Sword of the Celestial Moon's Profound Union】. Li Ximing studied it carefully, a bitter feeling rising in his heart. “What is the name that follows?” he asked. “And why are its characters not as bright as the ones before?”

Daoist Master Lingmei sighed. “When a sword intent manifests in the world, its name is recorded in the tome. If the characters are bright, it means that sword intent still exists. The names you see are those of the intents themselves.”

The sword intent sealed by the Li family had been used long ago, so its entry was naturally dim. Li Ximing bowed in reverence. After a long, silent moment, Lingmei returned the tome to its place and offered a word of comfort.

“It is often said that a grudge can be avenged even after a century. But there are times when there is no target for vengeance. To have all that power coiled in your hand with nowhere to release it… that is the true hardship.”

Li Ximing understood he was referring to the fact that Chi Wei was long dead, and the Chi family had withered to the point where only a few insignificant members of a branch family remained. Though the Li family now had a Purple Mansion cultivator, there was no one left to take revenge upon.

“Thank you for your understanding, Senior,” he said softly.

When he thought about it, Li Xuanfeng and Li Xizhi had played a crucial role in the Chi family’s destruction. With the exception of Chi Zhiyun, who was in seclusion, every direct descendant of the Chi clan had been wiped out. In a way, vengeance had already been served.

‘And Chi Zhiyun is in seclusion somewhere,’ Li Ximing thought fleetingly. ‘Si Boxiu will most likely never let him out.’

The thought sparked another memory—his uncle Li Yuanjiao’s friend, Cheng Gao. “Daoist Master, you mentioned a Cheng Gao earlier,” he asked. “He has some history with my family. Might I ask where he is now?”

Lingmei paused for a moment before answering. “He is still stationed in Ganzi, in the Great Western Plains, guarding the Bai Liqiang kingdom. It’s a small nation, but the Long region is rife with demonic cultivators these days, so he cannot be easily moved.”

The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate’s main sect was in Jiangnan, yet their jurisdiction extended all the way to the border of the Wu and Zhao kingdoms in the northwest. Li Ximing had wondered about this for years, and now he had the perfect opportunity to ask. Lingmei answered readily.

“This traces back to the True Monarch. When our founder sought the Dao, he originally planned to establish the sect right here on Yuchuan Sword Peak. But when he consulted the True Monarch, his request was denied.”

“The True Monarch said, ‘The Dao lineages of the world may change as they will, but two things must not be altered. The first is that sword sects must choose their mountains in the Shu region. The second is that shamanistic talismans must flourish in the Southern Borderlands.’ Our ancestor asked for a reason time and again, but the True Monarch would only say that it was more pleasing to the eye of the Immortal Monarchs…”

“‘More pleasing to the eye?’”

Li Ximing frowned, puzzled. But the words of an Immortal Monarch surely held a deeper meaning.

Lingmei continued, “So our ancestor established the sect in Shu. In Jiangnan, we only had two locations: Sword Ferry and Sword Peak. At our zenith, our power extended across both Long and Shu. After our founder fell, the sect gradually declined. And since our ancestral tree in Jiangnan could not be moved, we slowly migrated to the more spiritually abundant lands here. That is why we still have foundations in Long and Shu to this day.”

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing, and he began to calculate inwardly. ‘I’ve heard that the founder of the Wei Li family was originally from the Li clan of Long. I’ll have to make a trip there someday. If the Sword Gate has a presence there, I can ask them for information.’

After a few more pleasantries, he rose to take his leave. Lingmei, not wanting him to have come all this way for nothing, took a jade box from his sleeve. He had clearly prepared it when he went to retrieve the _Sword Tome_.

“My apologies for the trouble, Zhaojing,” he said. “I hear your clan has a Wanling Flower Tree. Please accept this Horn Wood Golden Tassel. It will be of great benefit to the spirit plant. Consider it a gift from our Sword Gate in return for your visit.”

Li Ximing was unable to refuse and accepted the box. He left the mountain peak and stepped into the Great Void. Only then did he open the box. Inside lay a single, gleaming golden needle from a Horn Wood tassel.

‘This is from that Profound Horn tree. It’s a resource on the level of the Purple Mansion realm, far better than any ordinary treasure.’

He put the box away, a sense of relief washing over him. He had successfully managed his dealings with all three major powers. Though the Sword Gate had politely seen him off, his business with them was concluded, and his mind felt much lighter.

‘My relationships with the Three Sects and Seven Gates are stable for now. Next… I can turn my attention to Jiangbei!’

**Pingya Island.**

Li Jiangxia emerged from the hall, his armor clanking with every step. He strode to the edge of the island, where a golden light glowed beneath his feet. A black horse with scales on its belly and crimson eyes stood waiting, snorting impatiently.

The steed was a crossbreed of the famed Zhongsa horse from the Eastern Yue region and the black-scaled horses of the great desert. An Zheyan had spent over three years capturing them, and several more breeding them. By the time the colt was grown and sent to Moongaze Lake, Li Zhouwei had already reached the Foundation Establishment realm and had no need for it. He had gifted it to his favored son, Li Jiangxia.

Just as Li Jiangxia swung himself onto the spirit horse and turned its head, a figure emerged from his lower left. The man had clearly been waiting for some time. He called out past the guards.

“Third Prince! Third Prince!”

Li Jiangxia looked down, a flicker of confusion on his face. His brother, Li Jianglong, who had been a step behind, caught up and glanced at the man.

“Third Brother,” he said with a smile, “you may not know him. This is the illegitimate son of a cousin from the twenty-sixth branch. Outside the main lineage, his name is Hun.”

“So it’s you!”

Li Jiangxia was rarely in the clan and knew nothing of a Hun or a Xing. He urged his horse forward, and the two guards blocked his path with their cold, gleaming iron spears. Li Hun, who was older than both of them, cried out.

“Ah, the Second Prince is here as well! This nephew pays his respects.”

Li Jiangxia noted the man’s thin frame and plain features. He raised his whip and laughed heartily. “Second Brother, this man looks just like you! He must be family. Except for the eyes, the resemblance is uncanny!”

Li Jiangxia’s boisterous, energetic demeanor was a world away from Li Jianglong’s, but since Li Hun’s maternal clan was the Chen family—the same as Li Jianglong’s—a resemblance was to be expected.

Li Jianglong’s expression was one of mild amusement as he joined in the laughter. On the ground, Li Hun went pale and dropped to his knees with a thud.

“You honor me too much, my lords!” he cried. “How could this nephew be so fortunate? I have only just come of age and was looking for some work on the island. I did not expect to see the Third Prince. My father often speaks of you, and I became a little excited…”

‘He still calls him Third Prince, eh?’

Li Jianglong saw at once that the man was trying to latch onto his brother. It was common knowledge that Jiangxia was destined for the eastern shore. For Li Hun to be here in the main hall meant his father must be a Qi Refinement cultivator. A smile played on Li Jianglong’s lips.

‘So, he’s here to curry favor with my little brother.’

How could Li Jiangxia not see it? He let out a great laugh and tucked his whip away, pulling on the reins. “Fine, fine! When I have a moment after I return from the eastern shore, you can come and find me for a proper chat.”

Without waiting for a reply, he spurred his horse and galloped off, leaving a stunned Li Hun in his wake. Before the man could react, Li Jianglong had already helped him to his feet.

“Cousin, you came to the island to…?”

Li Hun answered instinctively, “They said a guest had arrived on the island. My father brought him into the hall. Several elders went as well, to see the Clan Head. He…”

He trailed off, realizing his mistake. But Li Jianglong had already let go of his hand, his expression one of surprise. “Oh, it’s clan business! I thought you were just visiting relatives. My apologies for asking. You shouldn’t have said anything… really, you shouldn’t have! You have a loose tongue, child. You shouldn’t wander around the hall like this in the future. If you stumble into something important… be careful you don’t get punished on Mount Qingdu!”

His words struck fear into Li Hun’s heart. As he spoke, Li Jianglong’s hand had deftly unfastened the token from Li Hun’s waist, palming it. His tone grew heavier.

“It’s a good thing I ran into you, to keep you from wandering off. Come, let’s go see your father.”

Without his token, Li Hun was trapped. He could only follow numbly, his mind racing. Panic finally set in.

“Second Prince, my father… he’s in the middle of something important! It’s really not a good time to see him!”

“It’s fine.”

Li Jianglong paused at the top of the steps and turned back with a pleasant smile. His golden eyes were piercing.

“I’ll wait for him in the side hall.”

Li Hun froze, unable to move. Li Jianglong gently took his hand and led him through the corridors. By the time they reached the side hall, Li Hun was ready to collapse.

Li Jianglong paid him no mind, his attention focused elsewhere. He saw a disheveled middle-aged man walk past the guards. He appeared to be a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, but his cultivation was unstable, clearly propped up by spiritual items.

‘Who is this…?’

Li Ximing traveled for a short while in the Great Void before piercing through his family’s great array. He descended on a beam of celestial light, flying straight into the great hall. A journey that would have taken days before he reached the Purple Mansion realm now took less than half an hour. The sky had barely changed.

Li Zhouwei was standing in the hall, more than a dozen jade boxes laid out on a table before him. He was writing on them with a vermillion brush. When Li Ximing appeared, he bowed.

“Daoist Master, the reciprocal gifts for the Three Sects and Seven Gates are ready.”

Of the various powers in the Yue State—the Three Sects, Seven Gates, and two clans besides their own—Li Ximing had chosen to personally visit three. That did not mean the rest could be ignored. For every Purple Mansion cultivator who had attended his Dharma Assembly, a letter and a gift had to be sent, explaining that he was in seclusion to stabilize his divine abilities and could not visit in person.

Li Ximing had already prepared his letters for the Golden Feather Sect, the Hengzhu Immortal Dao, and the Profound Peak Gate, each with a specially chosen precious herb. Li Zhouwei took them and then reported Li Chenghuai’s breakthrough. Li Ximing was very pleased.

“Have him come see me,” he said with a nod.

Just as the words left his lips, a figure hurried in from outside the hall. “Reporting to the Clan Head and the Daoist Master,” he said respectfully. “Someone has come to the island, claiming to be the son of an old friend. He requests an audience with the Clan Head.”

‘The son of an old friend.’

The phrase sparked a thought in Li Zhouwei’s mind. He wondered who it could be. He saw the celestial light in the center of Li Ximing’s brow stir. Li Ximing took a seat to the side, his voice turning slightly cold.

“Let him come up.”

The man quickly retreated. After a dozen breaths, the sound of frantic footsteps echoed on the stairs. A man stumbled into the hall, looking utterly wretched. He fell to his knees with a thud and began to kowtow.

“Greetings… greetings to the Clan Head!”

Li Zhouwei studied him. He was a middle-aged man with a scruffy beard and a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivation. His face had a certain noble air, but it was contorted with panic and fear. His legs trembled as he knocked his head against the floor.

Li Zhouwei did not recognize him, but he saw Li Ximing take a sip of his tea. “Well, if it isn’t Young Master Yuan,” Li Ximing said casually. “To what do we owe the pleasure?”

The words struck the man on the floor like a bolt of lightning. His entire body went cold, as if he might drop dead on the spot. He was so terrified he couldn’t even speak. Li Ximing simply lowered his eyes and continued to drink his tea, not sparing him another glance.

After a moment, Li Chenghuai entered the hall and moved to the side. He glanced at the kneeling figure, and a feeling of familiarity washed over him. His heart jolted.

“Yuan Fuyao!”

The man was indeed the son of an old acquaintance: Yuan Fuyao, son of Yuan Chengdun.

Years ago, after Yuan Tuan disappeared, Yuan Chengdun had prepared to sail out to sea, not expecting to return. He had used the friendship between their families and his entire life’s savings to arrange a marriage for his son, Yuan Fuyao. But Yuan Huwei and Yuan Hudu, seeking to curry favor with the Chi family, broke the agreement. They told Yuan Fuyao to take his inheritance and marry a young lady from the Song family instead.

That was the moment the rift between the Li and Yuan families began, a rift that had now grown so wide that Li Xizhi and Yuan Chengzhao were enemies.

Li Ximing knew all of this. He also knew that Yuan Fuyao had gone on to live a comfortable life with a beautiful wife, becoming the master of the Song estate. And now, here he was.

The expressions on the faces of the Li family members were varied, but Yuan Fuyao was too terrified to speak. His life with the Song family had indeed started idyllically, filled with cultivation and music. But a decade passed in the blink of an eye, and the north-south conflict erupted.

Thanks to his family’s status, Yuan Fuyao was spared from fighting on the riverbanks. He had just breathed a sigh of relief when the Song family suffered devastating losses in the war. They began to eye Yuan Chengdun’s legacy, borrowing five coins one day, ten the next, pressing him relentlessly.

The world was in chaos, and he had nowhere to run. Then came a string of calamities. The main line of the Chi family was annihilated, and the Song family’s fortunes plummeted, which only made them more desperate. Fortunately, his father’s inheritance was vast. He held onto it tightly and managed to survive for over a decade, though the comfortable life he once knew was gone.

He heard tales of the Li family’s rise, of how Li Xizhi—the man who was almost his brother-in-law—had become a renowned master known throughout Jiangnan as the "Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow." Regret gnawed at him like a rat, and he tossed and turned at night.

Then, the sound of Li Ximing’s ascension, the sheer power of his divine ability, echoed through the Great Void across Jiangnan. Yuan Fuyao was struck with terror. He immediately jumped out of a window and fled, not daring to take anyone or anything with him. He hid in the wilderness for months. It was there he learned that the Azure Pond Sect had descended upon the Song estate that very night, leaving no survivors. His wife, concubines, and children were all dead.

But he had been born a coddled young master. Even at his worst in the Song household, his life had been one that ordinary rogue cultivators could only dream of. Hiding in the wild, afraid to be seen, was no life for him. He lived in constant fear that Li Ximing would remember him, tear open the void, and come for him. Finally, he had made his way to the lake himself.

He trembled for a long time before finally recounting his tragic tale. “I… I regret it all, but it is too late!” he choked out. “I beg the immortal clan to be magnanimous…”

Li Zhouwei had heard enough. He looked on with cold eyes. ‘He has a bit of cunning… but his character is too weak to amount to anything.’

# Chapter 710: The Baijiang Creek Territory

Li Ximing understood the moment Yuan Fuyao finished his tale.

‘The wilderness is the territory of the Xiao and Kong families, and my clan is about to establish a presence there. He must have become a topic of conversation, a potential gift for someone to capture and present to us for favor. After the Si family destroyed the Song clan, his own bloodline fell into their hands. Finding him was only a matter of if they wanted to, not if they could.’

‘Coming to my family was his only real chance to save his life and fortune. A clever move.’

Though Yuan Fuyao was a coward, his father, Yuan Chengdun, had been a true hero. He had slain demons, earned a great name for himself, saved countless lives during the demonic calamity, and shared a bond with Li Yuanjiao. The Li family had long ago promised that even if the marriage alliance fell through, they would still look after Yuan Fuyao. Despite the disgrace Yuan Fuyao had brought upon himself, the Li family, out of respect for his father’s memory, would never truly harm him. Using him as an example of their magnanimity was the more logical path.

Yuan Fuyao had almost certainly realized this, which gave him the courage to make the journey. The man had some cunning. He even knew to seek out the Clan Head, Li Zhouwei, first, preventing any lesser members from capturing him for their own gain.

With Li Ximing seated to the side, Li Zhouwei naturally refrained from taking the main seat. He stood by, silent, but the cold glint in his eyes made it clear that he, too, saw through the entire affair. Li Ximing took a sip of tea and said softly, “You overstate things. My family has no interest in settling scores with you. Chenghuai, escort the young master back to the Mushroom Forest Plains.”

“Yes, Daoist Master,” Li Chenghuai replied respectfully.

Without another word, he moved to Yuan Fuyao’s side. As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, a simple touch was enough to immobilize the man. Li Chenghuai had known Yuan Fuyao since they were young, and he couldn’t help but sigh inwardly as he dragged him away.

Li Ximing sat with the teacup in his hands, a long silence stretching before he finally spoke. “Yuan Chengdun was a hero of his time, yet his son is no better than a rat in a temple—useless, surviving only by the grace of his station. Talent is one thing, but to be so shortsighted and utterly dependent on his inheritance… The matter of heirs is truly unpredictable.”

The words were laden with meaning. Li Zhouwei could only offer a quiet reply. “Yuan Fuyao has a certain quick-wittedness, but he was spoiled by the Yuan family. He’s clever, but he was allowed to drift through his youth, so his ambitions are small. Even a fool, if guided and mentored daily, can be shaped into something useful.”

Li Ximing waved a hand, dismissing the topic. He produced a jade box from his sleeve. “Enough of that. I received a Horn Wood Golden Tassel at the Sword Gate. Take it and use it to nourish the Wanling Flower.”

“The matter of transplanting the Wanling Flower has not yet been settled,” Li Zhouwei noted. “Is it…?”

Only then did Li Ximing understand. The Wanling Flower had been planted on Mount Huqian for years. In the Li family’s early days, the mountain was considered adequate, but now it was a spiritually barren land. Moreover, its location by the lake was no longer secure. It was time to move it to the main island.

“Then let’s wait. The Wanling Flower is too precious to be moved carelessly. I was just thinking of visiting Changxi; I’ll discuss it with him as well.”

Having concluded his clan business, Li Ximing vanished into the Great Void. Li Zhouwei remained in the hall for a few moments before taking the main seat. He picked up his vermillion brush and issued a command.

“Have the Peak Administrator come here at once.”

This “Peak Administrator” was the Qi Refinement cultivator who had guided Yuan Fuyao to the island. He was Li Hun’s father, Li Anshuo. He should have been named Li Jiangshuo according to his generation, but his poor talent had denied him a place on the island when he was young. He had grown up on the outside, so he was more accustomed to his birth name. He currently served as an administrator for one of the prefectures on the western shore.

An attendant bowed and hurried out. A minute later, a man entered and prostrated himself in the hall. Without looking up, Li Zhouwei asked, “What did you receive in return?”

Li Anshuo remained on the floor. “Reporting to the Clan Head, Yuan Fuyao offered a staff technique to the clan. It was handed over to the island authorities upon his arrival.”

“Cautious, I see. It must be Yuan Chengdun’s staff technique, then. No wonder you were willing to take such a risk to personally introduce him.” Li Zhouwei made a mark on a scroll, showing no sign of anger. “Yuan Fuyao isn’t a fool, either. I imagine the scroll didn’t specify the technique’s grade… all the better to reduce your own liability.”

The two statements left Li Anshuo drenched in a cold sweat. “The Clan Head’s insight is profound. The Yuan family wrote it themselves, so it was not graded.”

“Sit.”

Li Zhouwei gestured for him to take a seat to the side before finally looking up. Li Anshuo couldn’t meet his gaze.

“Don’t direct your scheming at the island,” Li Zhouwei said casually. “Since you have such an ambitious mind, you’ll accompany me to the eastern shore tomorrow. There will be plenty of opportunities for you to scheme there.”

“If you perform well, you will be rewarded. If you fail, I will settle today’s matter with you then and there.”

Li Anshuo was both shocked and overjoyed. He hurriedly expressed his thanks, his face beaming with confidence. It seemed that years as a minor administrator by the lake had been a waste of his talents. Li Zhouwei waved him away.

“You may go. Second Brother is waiting for you in the side hall.”

The words wiped the smile from Li Anshuo’s face. He froze for a second before hastily retreating. As he left, Li Zhouwei sent someone to retrieve Yuan Chengdun’s staff technique and rubbed his temples.

‘This Li Anshuo… he might be useful.’

The Li family was currently facing a severe shortage of talent. The handful of Foundation Establishment guest elders had eased the pressure at that level, but there was a gaping hole in the ranks of Qi Refinement cultivators. Eighty percent of the Chengming generation had died on the riverbanks, and the Zhouxing generation was lackluster. The four vassal families of Lijing, their pillars for a century, had been crippled, and the eastern and western shores had yet to recover their strength. All the while, the family’s own enterprises were expanding faster than ever.

“Clan Head.”

Li Zhouwei looked up to see Li Chenghuai glide into the hall like a phantom. He presented a jade scroll. “A message from the Fei family has arrived,” he reported in a low voice. “There are two pieces of news.”

Li Zhouwei took the scroll containing the staff technique and began to read it as Li Chenghuai continued.

“First, the Fei family’s old patriarch, Fei Tongyu, passed away a few days ago. He died attempting to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. He had only been in seclusion for a few months, and there were no major phenomena.”

“Old men… they can be stubborn.”

With Fei Tongyu’s broken body and shallow cultivation, attempting a breakthrough was a death sentence. It was a foregone conclusion. Fei Qingyi had sent several letters in an attempt to dissuade him, but the old man would not be moved. His death was like a single grain of sand, causing a small ripple in the Fei family that had already dissipated by the time the news reached the lake.

Li Chenghuai didn't dwell on it. “The Fei family’s Fei Qingyi has broken through to the late stage of Qi Refinement. She has left Cold Cloud Peak and is waiting on the island, hoping to serve the clan.”

With his pressing need for manpower, Li Zhouwei simply nodded. “He’ll go to Jiangbei with the others.”

Li Chenghuai withdrew. By then, Li Zhouwei had finished a rough scan of the jade scroll. Yuan Chengdun was truly a genius. The _Green Mountain Demon-Subduing Staff_ technique was likely a fourth-grade art, valuable enough to serve as the core inheritance for an ordinary cultivator family.

---

The Great River was the world’s artery, flowing from west to east and dividing the land into north and south. Across the river lay Jiangbei, the northern territory of the State of Xu. The first domain one encountered was the Baijiang Creek territory, controlled by the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion from Xiaoshi Mountain.

Li Chenghui flew on a bolt of lightning above Baijiang Creek, surveying the land. To the north lay the Tangdao Mountains, the domain of the Golden Tang Gate; he could faintly make out its rolling peaks. To the east was the Baiye Creek territory of the White Ye Immortal Sect, obscured by a vast expanse of hills. Beyond Baiye Creek was Chengshui Marsh, and further east still, bordering the sea, was the Baihai Creek territory of Xuanmiao Temple.

If one flew higher, they would see that Jiangbei was trisected by three waterways: the Baijiang, Baiye, and Baihai. Old Man Qu had told him that these three creeks were once a single great river, the Huai. During the cataclysm when six commanderies sank into the sea, the Huai River had vanished, leaving only these three streams behind.

Li Chenghui, along with Qu Bushi and An Siwei, landed before the Floating Cloud Cave. The path was littered with debris. The population had been plundered, and the spirit rice fields had been utterly ruined, leaving nothing but bare earth.

They descended before the entrance of the sect, which was situated on a low mountain. The protective array had been shattered long ago, and collapsed masonry was strewn everywhere. A few low-level rabbits and mice scurried through the dilapidated courtyards. Qu Bushi led the way with a practiced air. “My lord, Fu Dou’s immortal foundation was ‘Wood Leaning on Spring.’ When he fell on this mountain, the flora erupted with life. It’s only been a few months, but it looks like decades have passed.”

An Siwei went to the summit and performed a quick divination. “Jiangbei is truly overflowing with spiritual energy,” he marveled. “No wonder every Foundation Establishment cultivator wants to come here. Even a small peak like this can support several of them…”

Aside from the Li family’s core territories—the dense forest, Gardenia Scenery Mountain, and Pingya Island, which could support a Purple Mansion cultivator—the number of their lands that could sustain multiple Foundation Establishment cultivators could be counted on one hand. This place had neither high peaks nor deep earth-veins, yet it was remarkably rich.

“Protector, the Floating Cloud Cave territory has plenty of spirit fields,” Qu Bushi explained, “but it’s mostly hills. You won’t find a single tall mountain. The Foundation Establishment cultivators were scattered across the low peaks… even the main peak had few residents.”

Li Chenghui was aware of this. Floating Cloud Cave had been less of a centralized sect and more of a loose alliance of Foundation Establishment cultivators. They were large but hollow, each with their own agenda, which was why they had been powerless against Li Zhouwei. It was also why, when their doom was sealed, they had turned on Fu Dou to fight over his spoils.

“They divided the spoils and fled for their lives. At least they left the place clean.”

Li Chenghui dispatched Qu Bushi to inspect the land and An Siwei to survey the various peaks. He sent his own cultivators to spread out and occupy the territory. The Floating Cloud domain was about the size of the Li family’s western shore, but it was desolate and empty of people, giving it a hollow, abandoned feel.

It took three days of hard work just to get the cultivators settled and have them begin repairing their new residences. With no local populace to manage, claiming the territory was a straightforward process. Another half day passed, and the Embryonic Breathing realm cultivators arrived—runners, farmers, and qi-gatherers, nearly a hundred of them. Li Chenghui assigned them to his Qi Refinement subordinates, and the entire Floating Cloud territory began to stir with life, finally showing the signs of a proper cultivator settlement.

Though not a master administrator, Li Chenghui was competent. It still took him nearly half a month to establish a basic framework. The rich spiritual energy of Jiangbei motivated his subordinates; had it been a barren land, the process would have taken several times longer.

Just as he was getting things in order, An Siwei returned on the wind. “There were traces of demonic beasts in nine locations,” he reported softly. “Six were minor demons, and the teams I sent have already driven them off. Two were at the late Qi Refinement level, which I dealt with myself. But one location appears to be the residence of a Demon General. I don’t know his background, so I sent an invitation. The response was that he is in seclusion.”

Li Chenghui summoned Qu Bushi. The old man lacked leadership experience, but his age and expertise in surveying spirit fields were invaluable, and his work was progressing steadily. Hearing An Siwei’s report, he waved a hand. “To inform the master of the house, there is a demon flood dragon in Baijiang Creek. He is of the dragon lineage and settled in the river long ago. I’ve heard that when a Dragon Prince passed through Baihai Creek, he sent a messenger to summon him for questioning. He’s not someone to be offended…”

“He has a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation and belongs to a noble species. He’s been ennobled as the Northern Brocade River King. His domain isn’t just Baijiang Creek; all three rivers are under his rule. He just prefers to live here because the water is clearer.”

“The one on the mountain is a snake demon, who took the River King as his adoptive father, which is why he acts so arrogantly. When Fu Dou was here… he had to send tribute every year.”

“So he really does have backing,” An Siwei murmured. Sending an invitation first had been the right move.

Li Chenghui nodded in agreement. As he was about to speak, a woman descended onto the peak. She wore a red dress patterned with True Fire and a golden sash around her waist. In her delicate hand, she held a golden brazier from which a flicker of reddish-white flame danced.

Li Chenghui rose and bowed with a smile. “Elder Sister, you’ve arrived.”

In her hand, Li Minggong held the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, and nestled within it was the fluffy, glowing Pure Feather Li-Fire. The mere presence of the flame was enough to incinerate the thorns along her path.

“I came ahead of the Clan Head,” she said with a smile. “He will be here shortly. I came to see if my brother has concluded matters at Floating Cloud Cave.”

“All that’s left is to pacify the local demon,” Li Chenghui replied, his brow furrowing. “If he’s in seclusion, then so be it. My family is a Purple Mansion clan; as long as we don’t bother each other, that should be enough. We don’t need his mountain. He can have it for his cultivation.”

“About that…” Qu Bushi, who had spent the last few days learning the ways of his new masters, interjected cautiously. “That snake demon is vicious. He never gave Fu Dou any respect and would demand a blood sacrifice every eighth month. It’s the ninth month now… I fear he woke up long ago.”

Li Chenghui understood the implication immediately. Even Li Minggong raised an eyebrow. “Oh?” Li Chenghui’s voice grew heavy. “So he simply doesn’t wish to see us?”

Li Minggong scoffed. “Whether he wishes to or not is irrelevant. With a Purple Mansion cultivator present, does he dare say another word?”

Though she spoke with disdain, she was laughing at the snake demon’s ignorance.

‘Never mind a distant relative of dragon-kind; our Clan Head has conversed with a Dragon Prince himself. But that involves the Fox and Dragon clans, so we cannot speak of it openly…’

When Li Zhouwei had his breakthrough, dragons had come to offer invitations and serpents had bowed in respect. The Li family, fearing that borrowing the dragons’ prestige would attract even greater enemies, had not spread the tale. Furthermore, with their great-aunt’s fate still unknown, they were even more reluctant to speak of it. But many of the older Purple Mansion cultivators in Jiangnan knew. Otherwise, no matter how Li Zhouwei had struggled, he never would have survived the last decade. He would have been killed long ago.

Li Chenghui knew this as well and was not concerned. “An invitation must still be sent,” he insisted. “We need to meet him at least once. My family plans to relocate our people here. If he goes mad one day and comes down the mountain looking for a blood sacrifice, there will be lives lost!”

His words were veiled. Whether the lives lost would be human or demon was left unsaid. Qu Bushi understood perfectly and smiled grimly. “Placating the Northern Brocade River King is what’s most important,” he advised diplomatically. “This snake demon is merely relying on him. I’m afraid Wenhu of Dense Cloud Cave has already made his move to win over the River King… which would put our clan in a difficult position…”

# Chapter 711: An Audience with the Great King

Qu Bushi was a wily old man. He racked his brain before whispering, “That snake demon is weak, so he wouldn’t dare say much… but the Northern Brocade River King is a demon favored by a Dragon Prince. He holds authority over all three rivers. A few years ago, even a cultivator from the White Ye Immortal Sect paid him a personal visit…”

The old man’s implication was clear. ‘Your clan may have a Purple Mansion cultivator, but so does his backer. Since when have the dragon clans feared anyone?’ He was trying to be diplomatic, afraid that the Li family’s direct approach would offend a powerful figure. The veiled warning made Li Minggong chuckle to herself.

Li Chenghui simply smiled. “Rest easy, Honored Retainer.”

As he spoke, a brilliant light gathered in the sky. Several figures descended from the south, landing on the mountain. The leader was clad in gleaming plate armor and gripped a halberd, his golden eyes flashing. Beside him stood a man in black robes with a somber expression and a sword at his waist.

Li Chenghui and the others rose to greet them. “Greetings, Clan Head!”

Li Zhouwei helped him up and strode into the newly repaired hall. He remained standing and asked, “What is the situation here?”

Li Chenghui reported on their progress, explaining that everything had gone smoothly except for the matter of the snake demon. He had Qu Bushi recount the tale from the beginning, and the old man, not daring to be careless, explained every detail.

Li Zhouwei’s brow furrowed as he listened.

The problem was simple. He had a decent relationship with the Dragon Prince, Dingjiao, but the chasm between their families was as vast as the one between the clouds and the earth. Such a connection couldn't be cashed in like currency. The moment he used it, his ties to the Dragon Prince would be severed—a price Li Zhouwei had been unwilling to pay even for a Purple Mansion-grade ancient spiritual item.

‘And Dingjiao is a White Dragon Prince. The faction behind this Northern Brocade River King might not be the White Dragons at all! The other branches are one thing, but if he’s allied with the Black Dragons… that would be inviting a mountain of trouble for no reason!’

Li Zhouwei had long heard that the dragon clans were not a monolith. He had seen for himself in the Southern Sea how Dingjiao had made things difficult for Miao Ye. At its root, it was all part of the conflict between the White and Black Dragons.

‘The dragon clans will probably not interfere directly, but if this River King decides to make trouble, demanding a blood sacrifice now and then, it would be a nauseating problem with no clear recourse…’

After a moment of thought, Li Zhouwei asked, “What is this Northern Brocade River King’s true form?”

“That…” Qu Bushi froze, unable to answer for a long moment. Finally, he managed, “I do not know. I have only heard rumors… that the River King cultivates the Dao of Converging Water and possesses a powerful profound light. Wherever it passes, it can conjure maddening illusions and dissolve a person into a pool of blood.”

Li Zhouwei fell into a thoughtful silence, an understanding dawning in his mind. Suddenly, a calm, ethereal voice, as if drifting from the Great Void itself, echoed by his ear.

“Minghuang, go and see this snake demon at once. Take your men.”

Recognizing Li Ximing’s voice, Li Zhouwei put away his weapon and immediately gave the order. “I will go see this snake demon.”

He was a man of action. As soon as the words left his mouth, he called for Li Chenghui and Li Minggong, leaving only An Siwei to guard the mountain. He took to the sky, his thoughts racing.

‘This snake demon is a nobody. For a Purple Mansion cultivator to intervene, this must be about Dense Cloud Cave.’

With that realization, his pace quickened. In less than fifteen minutes, Baijiang Creek lay before them.

The waters of Baijiang Creek were clear with a faint blue tint, the longest and purest of the three streams. It even fed a small lake, a stark contrast to the murky Baiye Creek to the east.

The lake was no match for Moongaze Lake, spanning only fifty li, but from a distance, it looked like a lovely blue gem set among the rolling hills. They flew another fifty li past the lake before a small, lush mountain with a jagged peak came into view.

This mountain was far taller than Floating Cloud Cave’s main peak and was likely the finest spirit mountain in the entire domain. Fu Dou, lacking the backing, strength, and cunning to compete, had naturally lost it to the snake demon.

Li Zhouwei halted his light before the mountain and sent Qu Bushi to announce their arrival. Li Chenghui moved closer, speaking through a private transmission. “Clan Head, I see people waiting at the foot of the mountain. It seems someone has beaten us here.”

“Dense Cloud Cave, without a doubt.” Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes and concealed his aura. After a short wait, Qu Bushi returned on the wind, looking utterly dejected. He bowed. “Reporting to the Clan Head, the demon claims he is entertaining guests and cannot see us.”

Seeing his sorry state, Li Zhouwei guessed the demons had been far less polite than their words suggested. He nodded. “This snake demon has been preying on humans for a long time. There is nothing more to say. We will eliminate him today and spare ourselves future trouble.”

He shot into the sky, heading straight for the mountain. Seeing the lush vegetation, he drew his long halberd. As he descended with a cold expression, two demon soldiers blocked his path before a cave entrance. One held a saber, the other a spear. Seeing more visitors, they grew impatient. A leopard-headed demon shouted, “Who are you now? I already told you, my master is not seeing anyone! What part of the demon tongue don’t you understand?”

Li Zhouwei stood tall, his halberd in hand, his armor shimmering with golden light. “Use your dog eyes before you speak,” he said coldly.

“Oh?” The leopard-headed demon threw his spear to the ground, rolled up his sleeves, and took a step forward. But when his eyes met Li Zhouwei’s golden gaze, he froze. He sniffed the air, his bravado vanishing. “Ah… so it is a master who has arrived. Forgive me, but from which mountain do you hail? This lowly leopard failed to recognize your eminence…”

Li Zhouwei, remembering Bai Rong’s advice on how to handle demons, stared him down. “Witless slave. Do you not recognize a noble species when you see one? Have your master roll out here and pay his respects to me.”

His words sent a chill of terror through the two demons. They exchanged a panicked glance, and one scrambled back into the cave. A dozen breaths later, a man in a garishly multicolored python robe emerged, flanked by a host of lesser demons. He stretched his neck and squinted at them from the cave entrance.

Li Zhouwei met his gaze with an icy stare.

The snake demon’s heart pounded in his chest. He had no choice but to hurry down the mountain, still craning his neck to get a better look. But no matter how he looked, the man before him was clearly of high demonic lineage, his bloodline undeniably noble. He chose his words with care. “I wonder which mountain’s great king you are? This humble demon is but a minor steward from the Northern Brocade River King’s mansion, trying to make a living here. If you have any commands… I can arrange for you to meet the River King…”

Li Zhouwei didn’t move. He planted his halberd in the ground, his face a mask of contempt. “And what are you? Which palace does your master serve?”

This approach worked perfectly on demons. The snake demon’s suspicion melted away. He forced a smile and scurried to the edge of the defensive array, hesitating for a moment before stopping. He flicked his forked tongue and replied, “It is a great honor for my humble abode to receive a noble one such as yourself. My master is not from a direct palace lineage; he was ennobled by the Dragon Prince to temporarily govern the three rivers…”

“Not from a direct palace lineage?” Li Zhouwei scoffed, his face twisting with disdain. “In that case, how dare he not come out to greet me now that I have arrived in his domain? Which lineage branch does he belong to?”

That last question drained the color from the snake demon’s face. He began to wail, “Your Majesty… I am just a lowly steward in the mansion! How would I know such things? Please, allow me to introduce you to the Great King…”

Li Zhouwei bared his teeth in a cold, menacing grin. “Then why haven’t you invited me inside?”

“Ah!” The snake demon leaped from his spot as if struck by lightning. He flung aside his gaudy robe, scrambled out from behind the array, and dropped to his knees, his face a picture of pure sycophancy.

“I pay my respects, Your Majesty!”

# Chapter 712: The Northern Brocade River King

As the demon prostrated himself before the array, Li Zhouwei suspected that the cultivators from Dense Cloud Cave were still inside. He took a step forward, the light from his halberd casting a heavenly glow, and demanded, “This king smells humans on your territory. How many cultivators are there? Are they for boiling or for stewing? Or are they envoys from some other power?”

The question made the snake demon realize why this powerful figure had demanded he come out rather than entering the array himself. “This lowly demon has no great backing,” he said respectfully. “I was unaware of Your Majesty’s arrival and would never dare to harm you. The ones in the array are from a small, local power… called Dense Cloud Cave. They came to deliver some blood-food to me.”

He continued, “A new Bright Yang Purple Mansion Immortal Clan has appeared to the south, and they want to claim this land. They’re a rather stubborn lot. Though I do not fear them, I can’t be bothered to deal with them. I accepted the blood-food from Dense Cloud Cave and offered to introduce them to my great king.”

“Oh?”

Li Zhouwei remained outside the array, seating himself on the ground. “Your great king intends to meddle in the affairs of mortals?”

“Of course not…” The snake demon hesitated for a moment, but deciding this wasn’t exactly a secret, he focused on pleasing the golden-eyed beast before him. “It’s just a small matter. Baijiang Creek is the main waterway here, and my king cultivates the Dao of Converging Water. As the master of these waters, it is a simple thing for him to control the spiritual springs and, by extension, influence the spirit rice paddies…”

He lowered his head. “The people from the White Ye Immortal Sect also seem to have other matters to discuss with the Great King… As for what those are… this one does not know.”

As he spoke, his gaudy, multicolored robes pooled on the ground around him. Li Zhouwei judged from his appearance that his true form was likely a patterned python. Just as he came to this conclusion, two more cultivators flew out from the cave on the mountain. The leader was a woman wearing heavy, garish makeup, her face a mask of vigilance as she descended.

The snake demon didn't recognize Li Zhouwei, but no one from the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion could ever forget him. The moment he had appeared before the mountain, the disciples from Dense Cloud Cave had identified him. Within a few sentences, their own Foundation Establishment cultivator had been summoned.

Li Zhouwei secretly tightened his grip on his halberd. The Concealed Plunder Gold in his Juque Palace flared, and he silently activated Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, pushing his spiritual qi to its absolute peak. The patterned python demon heard a frantic shout from within the array.

“Manghuazi! Don’t let him fool you… He’s from the Li clan!”

The python demon, Manghuazi, looked up in a daze. Li Zhouwei’s expression was unchanged, but a single point of golden light suddenly erupted from between his thick brows.

_Boom!_

A deafening crack echoed from above as a golden flash of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light flickered through the air, gone in an instant. The light was so bright it brought tears to Manghuazi’s eyes. He scrambled to his feet and summoned a demonic wind, trying to flee.

But the woman in heavy makeup had just exited the array and flown right into the path of the attack. It struck her with a resounding bang, sending a shower of fiery sparks from her body as white smoke billowed forth.

“Aiyee… the pain!” she shrieked.

With the snake demon right in front of him, how could Li Zhouwei let him escape? Using Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light on him would have been a waste. He had first used the brilliant flash of light to take down the strongest of the Dense Cloud Cave cultivators. Only then did he raise his Grand Ascension Halberd.

“And where do you think you’re going?”

Manghuazi was shocked, furious, and deeply ashamed. He assumed Li Zhouwei had used some bizarre Immortal Foundation or strange shamanic art to trick him. He summoned a bone-white dharma treasure and brandished it, snarling, “You—”

He only managed to get out a single word before the Grand Ascension Halberd was at his chest. A black and red halo, a signature of the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts, flew out, melding with the bright light and casting an inky shadow. Manghuazi had no time to speak; he could only grit his teeth and block with his dharma treasure.

_Clang!_

The halberd slammed into the bone artifact with a dull thud. Manghuazi’s face went white, and he nearly reverted to his true form.

Li Zhouwei had been at the Foundation Establishment Realm for over a decade, spending far more time on his techniques than on cultivation itself. His constant struggles against the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion had forged him into an exceptional warrior. Though only at the mid-stage of his realm, he was a veteran of a hundred battles, his cultivation base incredibly solid.

Manghuazi was also a mid-stage Foundation Establishment demon, but his skills were unremarkable. He was no match for Li Zhouwei. The moment their weapons met, he knew he was in trouble. Only the quality of his dharma treasure saved him from total humiliation.

But Li Zhouwei simply applied pressure, turning the Grand Ascension Halberd so its specially crafted crescent blade hooked the bone artifact, trapping it in a surge of radiant light.

Manghuazi couldn't pull his weapon free. He saw another bright light gathering between Li Zhouwei’s brows and felt his soul tremble in terror. ‘What kind of man is this?’ he thought, aggrieved. ‘He must be a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion cultivator! A figure like the Northern Brocade River King himself! This is like using a butcher’s cleaver to kill a chicken!’

He took a sharp breath, drew upon his spiritual qi, and activated his Immortal Foundation, Concealing Dust Mist. A cloud of absolute darkness erupted from his mouth, shrouding his form completely and hoping to make the light between his foe’s brows lose its target.

“A cheap trick!”

Li Zhouwei’s eyes snapped open, blazing with a golden light that pierced through the darkness. The Way of the Bright Yang was not lacking in perceptive arts, to say nothing of his own innate ocular abilities.

“By my decree!” he commanded.

A spark of fire exploded, and the white smoke scattered. Manghuazi let out a wretched cry as a rain of blood fell from a new, gaping hole in his chest. “Please, My Lord, spare me!” he shrieked in a panic. “Report to my great king first, it won’t be too late to kill me then…”

Before he could finish, the Grand Ascension Halberd descended from the sky. Manghuazi could no longer maintain his human form and reverted to a massive, brightly patterned python. He crashed into the forest below, and the halberd followed, pinning him through his vital point, seven inches below his head, rendering him immobile.

Li Zhouwei had not even used his full strength. His Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner remained in his sleeve, and he had not yet prepared the Sun's Resonant Parting Art. The demon was subdued. He strode to the python’s head and ordered, “Summon the Northern Brocade River King.”

While Manghuazi was swiftly defeated, the others from Dense Cloud Cave fared no better. Li Chenghui’s reputation was well known, and with their leader already injured by Li Zhouwei, none dared to challenge him. They scattered in retreat.

Li Minggong held her Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier. The woman who had taken the first hit managed to steady herself and maintain the defensive array. “Are you from Moongaze Lake?” she yelled from the edge of the barrier. “My Dense Cloud Cave has not offended your immortal clan! Why do you attack me?”

“Dense Cloud Cave?” Li Minggong shook her head, her voice ringing out. “We were ordered to eliminate demons. All we see here are a few demonic cultivators colluding with evil. We see no one from Dense Cloud Cave.”

The woman was speechless. Contacting the demon wasn’t a major crime, but being cornered by the Li family like this, they could say whatever they pleased. Fury rose in her heart. “Don’t push us too far!”

“Push you too far?” Li Minggong found this laughable. She recognized the woman now—it was Miaoshui of Dense Cloud Cave. They had clashed before, and back then, neither had shown any mercy. She raised the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, puffed out her cheeks, and blew gently.

With her breath, the Pure Feather Li-Fire within the brazier erupted in a flurry of crimson and white feathers, drifting down toward Miaoshui’s face.

Miaoshui, of course, remembered Li Minggong, but in her memory, the girl had been a nobody, easily beaten within twenty exchanges. She hadn’t given her a second thought. But now, as the feather-like flames drifted toward her, she felt a stinging pain on her skin.

She was already injured and her spiritual qi was in turmoil from Li Zhouwei’s attack. In contrast, Li Minggong, newly equipped with the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, now wielded an enhanced Pure Feather Li-Fire. For a moment, Miaoshui was completely suppressed. Even more terrifying was Li Chenghui, standing right behind Li Minggong!

Li Minggong alone was more than she could handle, to say nothing of Li Chenghui watching like a tiger. “Quickly, come out of the array and help me!” Miaoshui cried.

The great array belonged to Manghuazi. It was easy enough for Miaoshui to exit, but she couldn’t simply retreat back inside. The few people still within the barrier heard her plea and hesitated.

‘Li Zhouwei is out there, too,’ they thought. ‘Going out now would be suicide.’

The weakness of a motley crew like Dense Cloud Cave was once again on full display. Not a single person moved. Miaoshui was livid. “Staying in the array is just waiting to die! What’s the difference?” she snarled.

Finally, someone rode the wind out of the array, shouting that they were coming to her aid. The old man, Qu Bushi, ever the opportunist, immediately grabbed his own dharma treasure and moved to assist Li Chenghui. Li Chenghui held one hand out flat, and six silver-white talismans of profound punishment rose into the air, spinning around his wrist and emitting an intense, crackling light.

“Where Yang culminates, the Six Thunders are born!”

Qu Bushi tied up one opponent, and Li Chenghui’s silver lightning immediately surged forth, striking the other. The demonic cultivator didn’t even utter a word, only a world-shaking scream as black energy rolled off his body.

Though Li Chenghui’s cultivation was not yet at the level of the late Li Qinghong, his mastery of lightning arts was only a step behind. A single bolt had nearly knocked his opponent unconscious. Li Qinghong had possessed great talent for cultivation and a passion for the spear, but she had little aptitude for spellcasting. Li Chenghui was entirely different. Not only was his cultivation method the more complete Celestial Cloud Thunder-Questioning Method, but he had spent his life practicing amidst the thunderstorms of the Eastern Sea. By the time he reached Foundation Establishment, the Li family was already a great clan, and the resources he received were far superior.

Most critically, all of Li Qinghong’s lifelong research into the profound-light secret arts of the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring had been left to the clan!

Wielding his dharma treasure, he was a truly imposing figure. His opponent was a demonic cultivator, and within twenty exchanges, the man was already half-dead. Qu Bushi watched, his eyes burning with excitement.

“Excellent, excellent… The Li clan is truly on the rise! Li Chenghui alone is formidable enough, and they still have Li Zhouwei!”

The old man had cultivated for many years and had a sharp eye. Li Chenghui’s Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman was clearly superior to the Crimson Flame Brazier, and he could see at a glance that Li Minggong relied on the power of her treasure, whereas Li Chenghui’s strength was his own.

While Li Chenghui suppressed the demonic cultivator in a matter of moments, Li Minggong steadily kept the pressure on Miaoshui. She knew the woman was cunning and that calling her allies out was merely a ploy to create a chance for her own escape. She remained vigilant, never giving her an opening.

It was only when Li Zhouwei returned, having subdued Manghuazi, that Miaoshui finally understood there was no escape. “For your esteemed clan to suppress a member of the water clans like this… Do you hold the Northern Brocade River King in such low regard?” she said in a low voice. “My cave master has already paid his respects to your Daoist Master. Our two families have reconciled. Why must you do this to me?”

She was playing dumb, but Li Zhouwei didn’t bother to answer her. He simply felt the moisture in the air thicken. The creek began to rise, the waters of Baijiang Creek churning below them. He crossed his arms and waited.

Li Chenghui sensed it too and narrowed his eyes.

“It’s the Northern Brocade River King!” Qu Bushi said in a panic.

As if on cue, a waterfall erupted from the surface of the creek, spraying white water high into the sky. A magnificent, aquamarine chariot burst from the waves, shimmering in the light. Two rows of shrimp soldiers and crab generals rode the water, flanking the carriage as the creek surged, flooding the base of the mountain.

Manghuazi, pinned to the ground, gave no reaction, but a wave of relief washed over Miaoshui. Though still surrounded by enemies, she couldn't help but smile to herself. ‘Now things are truly messy… With me and Manghuazi on the same side, it couldn’t be clearer who’s in the right and who’s in the wrong, could it?’

At the front of the carriage stood a hunchbacked old man in a heavy, ink-black coat, holding a conch shell that seemed entirely out of place. The carriage sped toward the base of the mountain. “I wonder which mountain’s great lord you might be?” the old man called out in a gravelly voice. “If this little snake has disturbed you, there was no need to go this far…”

His words were polite, but his expression was anything but. If not for Li Zhouwei’s unusual appearance, he likely wouldn’t have bothered with even that much courtesy. Hearing this, Miaoshui quickly shouted, “My Lord, these are the soldiers of the Li clan! They attacked Manghuazi without any provocation…”

Li Minggong gritted her teeth, and the flames from her brazier burned hotter. But a clear, cold voice cut through the air from within the carriage.

“Shui Zhao… enough!”

The old man in black, Shui Zhao, fell silent. The crystal curtain of the carriage was drawn aside, and a man stepped out.

He was tall, dressed in a turquoise, silk-brocaded shortcoat, over which he wore a white velvet cloak embroidered with a scene of a great green sea. One could faintly see fine, azure scales covering his neck, giving him an air that was both demonic and majestic.

The moment he appeared, Li Zhouwei recognized him.

‘So, it’s you…’

The suspicions Li Zhouwei had been harboring were finally confirmed. A wave of relief washed over him, and he had to suppress a laugh.

Years ago, as a guest of the Dragon Prince Dingjiao, Li Zhouwei had been entertained with wine and song aboard his vessel. The entertainment had included a battle between two noble beasts for sport… one was a Treasure-Scaled Ferry-Beast, and the other was an Azure-Necked Flood Dragon. Before Dingjiao, they were like two dogs, tearing into each other for their master’s amusement.

This Northern Brocade River King—was none other than that same Azure-Necked Flood Dragon!

He even recalled Dingjiao asking for his opinion on a technique, the Converging Water Profound Light. The memory had stuck with him. So when old Qu had mentioned a master of the Dao of Converging Water who used a profound light to create maddening illusions and dissolve people into blood, the connection had immediately formed in his mind.

Seeing him now, he knew his guess was correct. Li Zhouwei’s face remained impassive, but inwardly he was laughing. ‘I heard the Dragon Prince valued him highly. Whenever the prince passed by Baijiang Creek, he would specifically send for him. Well, how is this not sending for him specifically? Excellent!’

As Li Zhouwei recognized the Azure-Necked Flood Dragon, the Northern Brocade River King’s sharp, authoritative gaze swept over the scene. His face was a mask of clear displeasure—until his eyes met Li Zhouwei’s.

In a single instant, his expression shifted from calm to startled, and from startled to utter, abject terror. The Azure-Necked Flood Dragon was horrified. He immediately rode the water over, and before the stunned eyes of everyone present, he arrived before Li Zhouwei, bowed deeply, and said with the utmost respect:

“Greetings, Great King… A lowly demon under my command has been so blind as to offend Your Majesty… I am overwhelmed with shame and fear. I will have this thing’s life at once and prepare a snake stew for you.”

The Azure-Necked Flood Dragon turned his head, and the look he gave the pinned Manghuazi was filled with a chilling hatred and disgust, as if he were looking at something utterly repellent.

“Shui Zhao,” he commanded coldly. “Kill it at once!”

# Chapter 713: Floating Cloud Cave Settled

The Northern Brocade River King’s words left everyone stunned. The Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier in Li Minggong’s hand trembled, the flames momentarily receding. Her bright eyes darted toward the scene, and understanding dawned. She let out a sigh of relief.

‘I thought we’d have to negotiate with this imposing Northern Brocade River King, a supposed guest of a Dragon Prince… but it was settled so easily.’

The two demonic cultivators were still gasping for breath in Qu Bushi’s grasp, unable to move. The old retainer’s face was flushed with disbelief, his mind reeling. Having seen much in his life, he sensed something was amiss. ‘This isn’t how you treat a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan. The Northern Brocade River King wouldn’t be this deferential even to Zhaojing himself! No wonder Li Chenghui was so fearless. I thought the man had lost all sense of caution…’

While their reactions differed, even Li Chenghui was surprised. The young man in silver armor and black robes frowned. ‘From the looks of it, the rumors of the Northern Brocade River King being favored by the Dragon Prince… are likely false.’

But no matter how astonished they were, none could compare to Miaoshui. The color drained from her face, all the way down to her neck. The spell in her hands dissipated, and Li Minggong’s Li-Fire scorched several black marks onto her robes as her grip slackened.

“As you command, Your Majesty!” The old demon, Shui Zhao, hastily rode the water downward.

Shui Zhao’s true form was likely a black turtle, a proper steward of a water palace. When the Northern Brocade River King had first said, “enough,” his face had turned cold. He was completely unprepared for his master to immediately grovel, not even daring to raise his head. The sheer disparity left Shui Zhao reeling, making him question his own judgment.

‘“Enough”… so that’s what he meant… The cold words were for Manghuazi. I truly misjudged the situation!’

Fortunately, he hadn’t been too offensive earlier. He scrambled down from the carriage, rolled up his sleeves, and stomped on Manghuazi’s forked tongue. “You patterned loach!” he cursed. “Such audacity, to go around swindling people using my great king’s name!”

The old turtle was a cultured demon, and his insults lacked bite. He raised a hand to strike Manghuazi’s head, but the great halberd pinning the snake moved slightly, catching the light. Li Zhouwei’s voice carried from a distance, “There is no need to trouble yourself.”

The old turtle snatched his hand back as if it had been burned. The hierarchy among demons was strict, and even more so among dragon-kin. Servants like them could act high and mighty in front of outsiders, but they alone knew the true bitterness of their position. He dropped to his knees, his face slick with cold sweat, and waited respectfully by the halberd.

The Northern Brocade River King’s legs felt even weaker.

No one present understood the weight of the man before them better than he did. The Dragon Prince Dingjiao had feasted with this man while he and that Treasure-Scaled Ferry-Beast from the Vermillion Sea had fought to the death, all for their amusement. Though he had embellished his own status and borrowed much of the prince’s influence, that facade was paper-thin before this man!

The demon’s features were imposing, but his posture was utterly humble. “This lowly one is named Ying Hebai,” he said respectfully, “and I have the undeserved honor of leading the water clans of the three creeks. Now that you have arrived, My Lord, you need only give your command.”

Ying Hebai stood stiffly, not knowing how Li Zhouwei would expose him. He exhaled quietly, steeling himself for complete humiliation.

While the Azure-Necked Flood Dragon hesitated, Li Zhouwei understood the situation perfectly. Ying Hebai was borrowing Dingjiao’s prestige to intimidate others, but was he himself not doing the same? Dingjiao had shown him and Bai Rong some courtesy, but his true motives were still hard to guess…

If not for Dingjiao, Ying Hebai wouldn’t have given the Li clan the time of day. Li Zhouwei decided not to expose him. He clasped his hands behind his back and said, “So it is you. We met once, years ago. I did not expect to find you serving here.”

“Yes… I was fortunate enough to witness Your Lordship’s esteemed presence. I have not dared to forget it to this day!” Ying Hebai was momentarily stunned, then felt a wave of genuine relief wash over him. He understood the man was giving him a way to save face. Overcome with gratitude, he was unsure how to respond. A voice, faint and ethereal, echoed in his ear.

“What happened between myself and Dingjiao that day is a secret. Do not reveal my identity, and do not mention it.”

Li Zhouwei had no desire for the dragon-kin to think he was throwing Dingjiao’s name around. They were dragons, after all. He could skirt the edges of their influence, but he couldn’t act like a fox borrowing a tiger’s might. Offending that dragon would be troublesome indeed.

At these words, Ying Hebai knew it was a spiritual transmission. Now he was in a difficult position—he couldn’t be overly fawning, but he feared causing offense. “I invite you all to be guests in my palce,” he said respectfully.

Manghuazi had mentioned that the White Ye Immortal Sect had been in frequent talks with this Northern Brocade River King, Ying Hebai, and that they had many plans. Being unfamiliar with the territory, Li Zhouwei certainly needed to speak with him. He had no fear of being harmed, but with Miaoshui and her people just captured—a fact that even Dense Cloud Cave might not yet know, let alone the White Ye Immortal Sect—he didn't want to lose the element of surprise.

“I have urgent matters to attend to here,” he said. “I cannot leave for the moment.”

“It is no matter, no matter at all!” Ying Hebai replied deferentially. “This lowly one will wait by the river.”

It seemed the Azure-Necked Flood Dragon intended to wait right there in Baijiang Creek for them, which was far too conspicuous. Li Zhouwei considered for a moment. “I ought to accept the Northern Brocade River King’s gracious invitation,” he said softly. “Once I have concluded my business here, I will send someone to you.”

“Yes.” Ying Hebai sensed his displeasure and immediately prepared to take his leave. He was visibly relieved not to have to host Li Zhouwei in his palace. He had Shui Zhao bring the carriage around and departed into the river with a flurry of apologies.

Once the procession of water-kin was gone, Li Zhouwei turned his gaze to Miaoshui. She was still listlessly fending off the Li-Fire, the crimson and white feathers fluttering around her, her spiritual qi hissing as it burned.

The Golden Feather Sect’s Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier wasn't adept at killing, but it was an excellent tool for trapping foes with Li-Fire. It was a vicious, insidious weapon that wore its victims down like a dull knife scraping at bone. Wounded and having lost the initiative, Miaoshui was trapped, unable to advance or retreat.

As Li Zhouwei approached, her despair deepened and her expression grew harder. But then she heard his clear voice. “There is no need to struggle. It is a waste of effort. Put away your weapon and surrender. It will save me the trouble of capturing you.”

Miaoshui had watched the Northern Brocade River King depart, and she had been weighing her chances in an all-out fight, prepared to sacrifice everything but her life for a sliver of hope. But there had never been any real chance of escape. Seeing that Li Zhouwei’s killing intent was not strong, her desperate resolve softened. She raised her brows and called out, “This humble woman pays her respects, My Lord! I have long heard of your clan’s good name and have always admired it. It is only that in my past wanderings through the mortal world, I have been stained by some impurities. I feared tarnishing your esteemed clan’s name and thus did not dare to surrender immediately.”

At her words, the two demonic cultivators also looked up. The cultivators of Dense Cloud Cave were a slight improvement over those from Floating Cloud Cave, but seven out of ten had still dabbled in unclean practices. How the Li clan dealt with them would almost certainly determine the morale of the entire Dense Cloud Cave.

Cultivators like Miaoshui, who hailed from Jiangbei and the north, still had some reservations. They had not yet stooped to the level of demonic cultivators who slaughtered indiscriminately to advance their cultivation. But blood qi, blood pills… they had occasionally turned a blind eye and consumed them. When gravely injured and near death, they weren't picky about what kind of flesh they ate, either.

In truth, these people’s attitudes were not so different from minor clans like the Yuan and Yu. They couldn’t measure up to the likes of the Xiao or Li, but they were a cut above the demonic cultivators and those from the Eastern Sea.

Miaoshui was no fool. The Li clan’s next move would likely be against Dense Cloud Cave. Even if they didn't attack, using her as an example could greatly weaken their enemy’s resolve. She posed her question with trepidation. Li Zhouwei remained silent, but unexpectedly, Li Minggong spoke up.

“Clan Head… Fellow Daoist Miaoshui has not committed too many great sins. Blood pills are common in Jiangnan; it is normal to be stained by some impurities…”

Her words made Miaoshui look up in surprise. She had only met Li Minggong a few times, and she had even injured her in a past battle. Li Minggong was the last person she would have expected to plead her case. She turned her head in astonishment.

Li Minggong’s reasoning was simple. Dense Cloud Cave was backed by the White Ye Immortal Sect. Though the Li clan had Li Zhouwei and Li Chenghui, they were still short on manpower. Even if they had to make a move, they certainly didn’t want to face an unyielding, monolithic enemy who would fight to the death.

‘Even if we are to settle this score… it must be done after the autumn harvest, not now! Miaoshui is somewhat soft-hearted; by Dense Cloud Cave’s standards, she is relatively clean. If we kill her, everyone in Dense Cloud Cave will know they have no chance of survival in our hands.’

With her words, Li Zhouwei had a convenient way to step down. He was already thinking of launching a surprise attack before Dense Cloud Cave could react. He certainly couldn't kill Miaoshui and alert Wenhu.

“Since my aunt vouches for you, I will spare your life for now,” he said in a low voice. “Sheathe your weapon.”

After a final moment of hesitation, Miaoshui’s water sword flew back to her. A moment later, Li Minggong’s Li-Fire vanished. Miaoshui sped before Li Zhouwei and bowed with some awkwardness. “Greetings, My Lord.”

Li Zhouwei nodded. The two demonic cultivators were still held by Qu Bushi. A single glance was enough to tell they cultivated the _Blood Asura Scripture_, the sort of lucky ones who had reached Foundation Establishment by murdering and refining resentment and baleful qi. The demonic energy above their heads practically soared into the sky.

The Wen brothers, who were currently tending to the fire meridian on the mountain, were at least orthodox Eastern Sea demonic cultivators. These two, however, had flimsy cultivation bases and were utterly useless, yet they were stained with heavy sins. Li Zhouwei didn’t spare them a second glance. “Bind them and lock them up on the mountain. We will deal with them upon our return.”

A chill crept into Miaoshui’s heart. ‘Who knows how they’ll deal with me then… I can only take it one step at a time… I just fear that expert from the White Ye Immortal Sect is a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator. If Daoist Master Zhaojing is no match for him, I will have no way to live.’

As her heart turned to ice, she heard Li Zhouwei speak casually. “You must have realized that Dense Cloud Cave is backed by the White Ye Immortal Sect… but having a Purple Mansion power supporting you is one thing, and being a Purple Mansion power yourself is another. For you to leave a puppet like Dense Cloud Cave and join my clan… this is a matter not even worth Daoist Master Yehui’s notice.”

“But if you are feigning surrender… then you would be jumping from the protection of a Purple Mansion to the domain of a Purple Mansion power. No matter how things end, it would be perfectly reasonable for my clan to kill you. It would be effortless, and no one would protect you. Weigh your options carefully. Do not bring about your own ruin.”

His words sent a shiver down Miaoshui’s spine, leaving her deeply shaken. She was completely unfamiliar with the struggles between Purple Mansion powers. If she truly was to join the Li clan, she would be laughing with joy; her only fear was a future reckoning.

After hearing his words, she dared not have any other thoughts. “This subordinate has received your grace and will never have a second thought!”

Li Zhouwei didn't care what she was thinking; he still harbored a great deal of suspicion toward her. “What is the layout of the arrays in Dense Cloud Cave’s territory?” he asked.

Miaoshui’s mindset shifted quickly. “Dense Cloud Cave has eleven peaks and twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators,” she answered promptly. “Seven of them are guest retainers from overseas. Their strength is lacking, and they use demonic arts, so they are not a major concern. Of the remaining five, besides myself, Wenhu is the strongest. The other three each have their own tricks… The two most outstanding among them could probably hold their own against someone at the level of the Azure Pond Sect’s peak lords.”

This matched the intelligence the Li clan had gathered. Dense Cloud Cave was, after all, a puppet, and many of its members were guest retainers brought in from overseas by the White Ye Immortal Sect. Their overall strength wasn’t that different from the Li clan’s.

‘Wenhu will naturally be my opponent,’ Li Zhouwei calculated. ‘Uncle Chenghui and Aunt Minggong, along with Miaoshui, can handle the other two. But Qu Bushi can’t fight several demonic cultivators on his own. Even with Elder White Ape and An Siwei… they can’t handle the rest of them… to say nothing of the arrays.’

If Miaoshui’s surrender was genuine, their top-tier combat strength was not inferior to their opponent’s.

However, Wenhu would clearly not expect a sudden attack. With the element of surprise, it wouldn’t be a simple matter of one-on-one fights. If they moved quickly, they could definitely wipe out those few demonic cultivators…

‘Does that expert from the White Ye Immortal Sect have a Life Divine Ability… And what are Daoist Master Zhaojing and Changxi’s plans…’

Seeing Li Zhouwei lost in thought, Miaoshui quickly added, “Only the main peak has a Foundation Establishment-grade array. The others are all Qi Refining-level and not worth mentioning. And I don’t know where Wenhu is…”

Li Zhouwei simply drew his halberd, sealed Manghuazi’s cultivation, and dragged him away. He pointed to the two lesser demons and ordered, “No matter who comes, just say Manghuazi is in seclusion and seeing no one.”

The two little demons had witnessed everything and were scared out of their wits. Crying out “Elder,” they quickly agreed. Li Zhouwei glanced around, got his bearings, and said, “We’ll head straight for Floating Cloud Cave, drop these people off, then continue north to rendezvous with An Siwei and the others and proceed to Dense Cloud Cave’s territory.”

---

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Gardenia blossoms fell like rain under a bright, clear sky. Li Ximing materialized. Before him, at a desk, sat a white-haired old man, his brow deeply furrowed, seemingly weighed down by many troubles. It was Daoist Master Changxi.

It was impossible for the old Daoist Master not to know about the changes in Jiangnan’s spiritual atmosphere. He himself possessed an Earth Virtue divine ability; he knew better than anyone whether this change was beneficial or detrimental. With his three juniors still in seclusion, it was no wonder he looked so worn out.

The problem was, Kong Tingyun and the other two were attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. It was not an ordinary seclusion. They couldn’t be moved, or else they could have relocated from Jiangnan to somewhere else…

“Zhaojing, please do not be offended by my unannounced arrival!” Seeing Li Ximing appear, the worry on Changxi’s brow immediately vanished, replaced by a smile.

Li Ximing had been observing the situation from the Great Void in Jiangbei. He had felt a stir from the divine ability he had left on Gardenia Scenery Mountain and had broken through the void to return. As expected, it was Changxi.

Li Ximing picked up a jade pot and poured him a cup of tea, then sat down opposite him. “Senior has come at just the right time,” he said with a smile. “I was just thinking of meeting with you.”

“Oh?” Changxi raised an eyebrow. He was being as polite as he possibly could be to Li Ximing. He adopted a posture of one ready to listen intently.

“Senior,” Li Ximing began, “do you know of any remedy for a damaged Dantian?”

“So that’s what this is about!” Changxi laughed and shook his head. “Do you remember old Daoist Master Qi of the Xuanmiao Temple? He cultivates ‘Treasured Earth,’ which has powerful nourishing properties. Though it cannot compare to ‘Valley Water’ or ‘Horn Wood,’ it is more than sufficient for such an injury.”

# Chapter 714: Sumian

“‘Treasured Earth’?”

The Earth Virtue Dao was one of the rarest lineages in the world, and Li Ximing had never even heard of Treasured Earth.

“Treasured Earth is a type of Earth Virtue that nurtures plant life and promotes the growth of crops,” Changxi explained. “It can nourish people and artifacts alike. It is because of this ability that old Daoist Master Qi has extensive connections with the cultivators of the north.”

Seeing the understanding in Li Ximing’s eyes, the old man continued in his gravelly voice, “The Manifestation and Returning Earths of the ancient Jixian Immortals are almost entirely lost to time. Wu Earth and Bound Earth are still relatively common, but Treasured Earth is even rarer. It is perfectly normal that Zhaojing would not know of it.”

Li Ximing looked up. “I was originally thinking of introducing you to him,” Changxi said. “Now is the perfect time. You can bring your man along, and he can heal him while you’re there.”

Changxi had prepared two safety nets for the Profound Peak Gate. The first was his alliance by marriage with the Xuanmiao Temple, securing Daoist Master Qi as a backer. The second was having his direct disciples study under Mount Jingyi in the Eastern Sea. Li Ximing’s need to heal Ding Weizeng played right into his hands.

Although this Daoist Master Qi—Sumian—sounded like someone worth knowing, Li Ximing asked cautiously, “What is his background? Which lineage does he belong to? Are there any entanglements?”

Changxi was prepared for the question. “He comes from the state of Zhao, originally a cultivator from near Mount Yan. By some stroke of fortune, he obtained his Daoist lineage and went to the Eastern Sea, where he achieved his Dao. He is already four hundred years old.”

“The Daoist Master is advanced in age and prefers to act with caution in all things. He befriends cultivators from all over to ensure the future security of Xuanmiao Temple. This is not the sort of person who invites trouble… Furthermore, his lineage is a special branch of Earth Virtue, so there will naturally be no complications.”

Having lived for centuries, Changxi understood Li Ximing’s concerns and laid them out plainly. This piqued Li Ximing’s interest in meeting the man. “What is his cultivation level?” he asked.

“Initial-stage Purple Mansion!”

Li Ximing frowned. A bitter expression crossed Changxi’s face. “Zhaojing must understand… we are Earth Virtue cultivators!” he said with grave sincerity.

“Any given Earth Virtue lineage has only a handful of practitioners… To reach the Purple Mansion Realm at all is a stroke of immense fortune. Where would one find others of the same path to consult with? Most of us have no powerful backing… which makes things even more difficult.”

A look of regret washed over him, and he lowered his head, his expression weary.

“There are only so many ways for us to complete our lineages. In my younger years, I was arrogant, thinking only of finding Purple Mansion-grade techniques. After hitting a wall for over seventy years, I finally gave up that hope and started searching for Foundation Establishment techniques instead.”

His words were veiled, but Li Ximming understood immediately. ‘Searching for Foundation Establishment techniques… that can only mean he intended to use a path-continuation art to seize another’s Immortal Foundation. Changxi has no Life Divine Ability, no skill in alchemy, and no profound Daoist lineage. From the looks of him now, it clearly did not go well.’

Changxi was nearing the end of his lifespan, his recent years sustained only by medicine. Recalling these past events brought a look of remorse to his face, which was now veiled by a faint, gray aura of death.

“There are many who cultivate the Bound Earth Dao, but at the Foundation Establishment Realm, they all practice either Fool’s Mountain Chase or a substitute for it. I finally managed to find two manuals among rogue cultivators, but their quality was far too low…”

“The Profound Peak Gate already lacked successors. I could not bring myself to make my own disciples cultivate a path just to extend my own. So I sent the techniques out into the wilderness and the Eastern Sea, intentionally providing some resources to see if anything would come of it.”

“But I have no Life Divine Ability, and who knows which Daoist Master from which sect… simply erased them with a wave of his hand. Or perhaps the techniques themselves were just too inferior. Not a single person succeeded. Few even reached the Qi Refining stage.”

“In over a hundred years, I only had a few successes. But I knew nothing of this method and had to research it all myself… In the end, nothing came of it. I could only accept them as guest retainers.”

The path-continuation method was clearly no simple matter, especially for a small sect like Profound Peak Gate. Li Ximing mentally calculated the timeline. “The Green Pine Grotto-Heaven… Tingyun went, did she not?”

“She did.” Changxi nodded and sighed. “I had no right to a share of the old Mirrored-Mirrage Grotto-Heaven. Fortunately, the Green Pine Grotto-Heaven appeared later. I fought tooth and nail just to send Tingyun inside. She transcribed three techniques from the Three-Drum Wall, and all three were dead ends!”

“I spent the better part of a century modifying them… scattering the manuals and then gathering the disciples to check on their progress. I finally managed to revise one of them by sixty or seventy percent… but by then, it was too late.”

A self-deprecating smile touched Changxi’s lips. “Blame me for being arrogant at first, and then for overreaching. A hundred years passed in the blink of an eye. And what if I had succeeded in mastering that divine ability? I would still be facing death. This half-finished technique can only be left for my descendants… If the Profound Peak lineage can be preserved, a successor can pick up where I left off. In less than a hundred years, they could at least cultivate a second divine ability.”

A chill went down Li Ximing’s spine. The old man’s words seemed to be aimed at him, a subtle warning using his own life as an example. He remained silent.

“The Three-Drum Wall in the Green Pine Temple left us three techniques,” Changxi continued. “If a successor can revise another one, in five hundred years, my Profound Peak Gate will have a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator. And who can predict the fortunes of future generations? Perhaps one will find a way to cross the threshold into the immortal realms.”

Seeing that Li Ximing was still silent, he finally offered his advice directly. “We are not of the Green Pine lineage, after all. We cannot cultivate it just because we wish to. I have seen how your clan searches for techniques; your Bright Yang lineage is also incomplete. You must be careful.”

Li Ximing nodded in acknowledgment. A visit to Xuanmiao Temple was certainly in order. Not only was the old Daoist Master of Treasured Earth a significant figure, but his own plans for Jiangbei would benefit from the temple’s support.

‘Besides, it was Daoist Master Chuting who suggested I seek out Changxi. With his skill in divination, he clearly saw no problem with it… perhaps he even hoped my clan would get involved in Jiangbei.’

He and Changxi took to the air. Li Ximing activated his divine ability, lifting Ding Weizeng from where he waited below, and together they flew into the Great Void. As they traveled through the ethereal plane, Li Ximing took the opportunity to ask, “Daoist Master, what are your thoughts on the matter of Dense Cloud Cave?”

Changxi looked slightly embarrassed. Li Ximing’s words were polite, but to Changxi’s ears, the meaning was clear: ‘My people are already on the move, securing the Floating Cloud territory and have now crossed Baijiang Creek… Where are your Profound Peak disciples?’

“My clan’s cultivators have already reached the wilderness,” he said quickly. “They are using artifacts to conceal themselves and are secretly advancing toward Dense Cloud Cave.”

“Dense Cloud Cave is merely a subordinate of the White Ye Immortal Sect. Yehui has no Life Divine Ability and is not skilled in divination. He will not be able to predict this.”

Li Ximing wasn’t worried about Yehui, but about Changxiao. However, those two had no real friendship, only a shared interest in opposing his clan. He considered this and replied, “Xuanmiao Temple is but a stone’s throw from Baijiang Creek, so it can be watched over. Besides, you and I appearing at Xuanmiao Temple at this time… who knows what suspicions that will raise.”

The White Ye Immortal Sect had a few notable figures, but Li Zhouwei was carrying the Li clan’s trump card—a Purple Mansion-grade talisman. Li Ximing’s only fear was that the White Ye sect might be prepared and that Li Chenghui and the others would be lost. Hearing that the Profound Peak disciples were on their way, he finally felt at ease.

After a brief conversation, they emerged from the Great Void. A deep black cliff loomed before them on the edge of the sea. Massive waves crashed against it, creating a thunderous roar.

Cultivators could be seen flying to and from the cliff. A short distance away, the terrain rose into a small, verdant hill. There were no pavilions or halls, only a scene of natural beauty, with a single Daoist temple at its peak.

Changxi led him toward the temple. The great array was already open, shimmering with a clear, rippling light. A young man stood before the gate, dressed in a simple white robe, his Daoist cap faintly glowing. He was tall, with slightly deep-set eyes, not looking like a southern cultivator.

“Greetings, Daoist Master Changxi, Daoist Master Zhaojing.” He bowed his head, performing a perfect circular salute. “This humble Daoist welcomes you both! My master has been waiting for some time for your esteemed arrival.”

“It has been a while, Qiuxin. Your cultivation has improved again!” Changxi laughed, his tone warm and familiar, like one speaking to a junior of his own family. They landed within the temple grounds, and Changxi headed for the main hall.

The hall was plain on the outside, but the interior was furnished in rich, dark colors. The scent of incense hung in the air. Li Ximing’s gaze swept across the room. At the head of the hall was a white cloth hanging, on which was painted a faceless Daoist riding a donkey.

“Daoist friend Changxi! It has been too long!”

A middle-aged abbot walked out from within the hall. He had a squarish face and wore simple, unremarkable clothes. This was, of course, the master of Xuanmiao Temple, Daoist Master Sumian!

He bowed, then looked at Changxi’s face. The abbot seemed to know some art of qi observation. His expression changed. “My friend… how have things become so dire?”

Sumian and Changxi were clearly old friends, and both were Earth Virtue cultivators. A sense of shared sorrow filled his face with worry. Changxi returned the bow. “Mount Jingyi had some trouble a few years ago. Xuanyi asked for my help. I didn’t expect to receive a minor injury, and with the recent shift in the spiritual atmosphere, my complexion has worsened.”

Li Ximing watched closely. At the mention of Daoist Master Xuanyi, Sumian frowned slightly but said nothing more. He sighed. “The workings of heaven are boundless and ever-changing. The Upper Evil Spirit Storage can no longer hold… It is beyond our power. So be it, so be it!”

Sumian was also an Earth Virtue cultivator. The current spiritual atmosphere, the Inward Heart Surging Profundity, was detrimental to earth, which was clearly not a good thing for him. He looked up at Li Ximing. “You must be Zhaojing!”

“I am… Greetings, Senior!”

“Ah,” Daoist Master Sumian smiled. “Zhaojing, no need for such ceremony. Please, come inside.”

They entered, offered incense together, and then moved to the rear courtyard. “My Xuanmiao Temple carries the lineage of the ancient Tongxuan Palace,” Sumian said leisurely. “The painting you saw depicts True Monarch Xuxiang of Tongxuan Palace, who attained the fruition of the ‘Treasured Earth’ Dao…”

“So, a True Monarch.” Li Ximing had already suspected as much when he saw the faceless painting. ‘Since the lineage is so grand, yet he only has a single Purple Mansion divine ability, it is likely not the orthodox line,’ he thought. ‘Nine times out of ten, he stumbled upon a piece of the inheritance by chance.’

Sumian led them to the rear courtyard. In its center stood an ancient, bronze-colored alchemy furnace of excellent quality. Other than that, there were only a few meditation cushions. After they were all seated, with Ding Weizeng standing respectfully to one side, Sumian picked up the conversation. “Changxi, did you come this time to introduce Zhaojing?”

“Indeed.” Changxi drew a breath, his face reverting to its middle-aged appearance. He made a gesture and gave a brief introduction, but Li Ximing had already been briefed on the old Daoist Master, and Sumian likewise knew of the newly ascended Purple Mansion cultivator. They exchanged some pleasantries.

Sumian’s attitude toward him was friendly. “I hear Zhaojing is an alchemist,” he joked. “I will have much to ask of you in the future. I must make sure to build a good relationship with you now!”

“Senior is too kind!” Li Ximing knew not to take such words at face value. Judging by the alchemy furnace in the courtyard, it was entirely possible that Sumian’s skill in alchemy surpassed his own.

The requirements for alchemy were a balance of yin and yang within the Shengyang Acupoint and a vibrant Cinnabar Cloud within the Sea of Qi, where water and fire were in harmony. These conditions were rare, but for a Purple Mansion cultivator, they were trivial.

A Purple Mansion cultivator could shape their own Sea of Qi. Never mind a vibrant Cinnabar Cloud and the harmony of water and fire; they could even create the unified yin and yang and the vast heavenly glows required by a weapons refiner. Aside from a few specific lineages, most Purple Mansion cultivators could mold their internal environment as they wished.

Balancing yin and yang in the Shengyang Acupoint was slightly more difficult, but as long as one’s lineage was among the twelve core Qis, or not too heavily skewed toward yin or yang, it could be gradually adjusted.

Li Ximing was born with these conditions, but cultivators like Changxi could also practice alchemy if they so chose. It was merely a matter of proficiency… they simply wouldn’t be as naturally gifted as Li Ximing.

Changxi, listening nearby, feared Li Ximing might ask an awkward question. He quickly interjected, speaking on his behalf, “Daoist friend Sumian has taken a great interest in alchemy in recent years. He cultivates ‘Treasured Earth’ and is a northern cultivator, quite different from those in Jiangnan… You can let him take a look at your retainer.”

“Then I must trouble you, Senior!” Li Ximing smiled and bowed.

Sumian had already noticed Ding Weizeng. He beckoned him over, took his wrist, and diagnosed his condition without a moment’s thought. He nodded. “A fine ‘Palace-Yang Tiger’! Your Immortal Foundation is the same as that of Daoist Master Yanque of the Hengzhu Dao, two hundred years ago. He was a great cultivator of his time.”

He released his hand, formed a seal with one hand, and with a gentle pull, drew a handful of ash from the alchemy furnace. He sprinkled it into a jade bowl, then broke a branch from a willow tree in the courtyard. He deftly dipped it in clear water and said in a warm voice, “Do you practice alchemy or weapon refining? Your Dantian is damaged, and your yin and yang qi have been leaking. I will mend it for you now, but you will no longer be able to practice alchemy or weapon refining in the future.”

“Replying to the Daoist Master,” Ding Weizeng said respectfully, “this lowly one never had such fortune to begin with.”

Sumian had him hold the jade bowl. He then took the water-dipped willow branch and struck him twice across the abdomen. “Close your eyes!” he commanded.

Ding Weizeng shut his eyes just in time to see a multicolored light of a divine ability spray from Sumian’s mouth and flow over his body. A faint light stirred between Li Ximing’s brows. He knew that Ding Weizeng’s injury was already healed.

‘Healed, just like that!’

Of all the things Sumian had done, only the handful of ash, burned from some spiritual material, was even remotely mystical. The rest were all common items. An injury that was incurable for Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining cultivators, save for a few special spiritual medicines… was healed, just like that!

Seeing their astonishment, Sumian smiled and shook his head. “Not at all. On one side, we have Bright Yang; on the other, Bound Earth. My Treasured Earth merely acted as a medium, creating a situation where the heavenly sun shines, all plants flourish, and life abounds. I simply borrowed the Purple Mansion dignities of you both and took a small shortcut…”

“But it is more than enough to demonstrate the Daoist Master’s profound skill!” Li Ximing praised. From what he had seen, Sumian acted with integrity. Regardless of his hidden thoughts, his conduct so far suggested he was reliable and worthy of friendship. He smiled. “Weizeng, quickly, thank the Daoist Master!”

# Chapter 715: The Matter of the Capital immortals Dao

"My deepest thanks, Daoist Master!"

Ding Weizeng's voice was heavy with respect. He was a hearty man with a square jaw and a bristling beard, and his simple, earnest bow was more convincing than a thousand fawning compliments. The old Daoist Master nodded, pleased.

After Ding Weizeng paid his respects, Sumian remained smiling but silent. The conversation that followed was not for his retainer's ears, so Li Ximing gestured, sending him out of the courtyard.

"I must thank Daoist Master Qi," Li Ximing said sincerely. "I only recently broke through, and my clan's precepts forbid me from engaging with matters of blood qi. I'm not skilled in this area, unlike you, whose divine abilities make such healing seem effortless."

"Zhaojing, you jest," Sumian replied, shaking his head as he poured the tea. "If you truly wished to heal his injury, it would hardly be a challenge. I merely had the advantage of a convenient divine ability."

He filled their cups just as a cool, quiet rain began to fall outside. Changxi watched Li Ximing with a complex expression, a finger resting on his teacup as if to steady himself. "Seeing you in your prime, Zhaojing, is like looking at myself three hundred years ago. It brings back a flood of memories."

Changxi was not yet five hundred, only around four hundred and fifty. Li Ximing had long been puzzled by the lifespan of Purple Mansion cultivators. He paused for a moment before asking, "Even after attaining a divine ability, if one cannot achieve transcendence, is it not possible to at least enjoy a millennium of life? Five hundred years is hardly enough time for cultivation."

Sumian smiled wistfully. "That's a fine question, one I asked myself in my youth. My lineage's records touch upon it briefly. Allow me to share what I know."

"Lifespan consists of two parts: the life of the body and the life of the spirit. The former is tied to your physical nature, the latter to your destiny. We of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivate our physical nature. Our souls are bound to our bodies, so while the body itself may endure, our destiny is finite. When it runs its course, the soul weakens, and we die."

A flicker of understanding crossed Li Ximing's face. Changxi added with a wry smile, "Look at the Buddhist cultivators of the north. They cultivate destiny. Their physical lifespans are short, but when one body perishes, they simply find another. Their Merciful Ones, for instance, changes bodies every century or so. Though they must reforge their Dharma body each time, living for over a thousand years until their destiny is exhausted is no problem at all."

"Precisely," Sumian agreed. "Therefore, it shouldn't be called a five-hundred-year lifespan, but a five-hundred-year destiny. Before the heavens changed, this was all recorded in the registers of the Underworld—so-and-so cultivator, fated to live for so many years... I've even heard tales of cultivators bribing officials in the Underworld to extend their time."

Changxi sighed. "After the heavens changed, the Underworld became inaccessible. Everyone's destiny became fixed. Purple Mansion cultivators have five hundred years. Those who cultivate a Life Divine Ability can live a little longer and have a chance through possession, but with my divine ability... I can only wait for the end."

Li Ximing mulled this over for a moment. "What of the ancient arts of cultivating Qi and nurturing one's nature?"

"The way of the ancient immortals is superior, of course! To master a divine ability and perfect both body and destiny—that is the path to true longevity!" Sumian laughed. "But how many can actually succeed? Look at the Wang and Xie families, hiding in their vast Grotto-Heavens with millions of mortals. Do they even have ten cultivators among them? And of those who cultivate, does even one in a thousand attain a divine ability? Even if you could find such an immortal scripture, your entire Moongaze Lake might only produce one or two children capable of using their powers for something as simple as calling rain."

Li Ximing nodded in acceptance, took a sip of tea, and changed the subject. "Is the old Daoist Master secure in these lands?"

Sumian knew he was asking about the White Ye Immortal Sect. "Rest assured, Zhaojing, I have always lived peacefully here by the sea. Shen Yuming of the Shen family, Master Minghui of the Lotus Temple in Lu, and even Yehui of the Capital immortals Dao and Chang Yun of the Chengyun Gate have all paid their respects."

His meaning was clear. The Xuanmiao Temple had no grand ambitions. Sumian wished to live out his final years in peace, maintaining good relations with his neighbors. He had no desire to get involved in the tense standoff between Changxi, the Li clan, and the White Ye Immortal Sect.

He glanced at his two guests before adding, "But now that I have promised Changxi I would look after the Profound Peak Gate, I will naturally keep my word."

Li Ximing was not surprised. He chose his words carefully. "When I broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, this Daoist Master Yehui sent no congratulations. That I can overlook. But he then went out of his way to mock me without cause. I am at a loss as to how I offended him."

"I am aware that the White Ye Immortal Sect is blocked to the north by the Chengyun Gate—and Chang Yun is a formidable figure. To the east, they have Xuanmiao Temple; to the south, your Profound Peak Gate; and to the west, the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion. They are natural rivals to my clan... but there was no need for him to bare his fangs so soon."

Yehui was not the only one who knew that the Azure Pond Sect, the Li clan's backer, would not welcome their prosperity; Sumian and Changxi knew it as well. It was this knowledge that fueled Yehui's greed. The two old men exchanged a look, and Sumian sighed.

"There is something you don't know, Zhaojing. Yehui obtained his great opportunity in the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven, and he owed his entry to the support of Guo Shentong... In the early days of the conflict between the east and west isles of Crimson Reef Island, many held back from attacking the west isle out of respect for his connection to Guo."

The final piece of the puzzle clicked into place for Li Ximing. 'So that's it,' he thought with a deep sigh. 'In the end, it all comes back to our feud with Crimson Reef Island. No wonder he was so hostile. The vendetta between our clans and the direct lineage of Crimson Reef is not easily resolved.'

As he processed this, Changxi's voice grew low and cold. "I heard that opportunity was meant for Lingshu! That man is a snake! Zhang Lingshu is dead, and I'd wager Yehui had more than a little to do with it!"

The name Zhang Lingshu sounded familiar. After a moment's thought, Li Ximing remembered that Li Xizhi had inherited the title of Changtian Peak Lord after the line was broken with Zhang Lingshu's death. She had originally been a Peak Lord of the Azure Pond Sect.

Sumian shook his head, looking slightly uncomfortable. "It's a complicated matter. In the end, Haiying and Lingshu never married. You have no grounds to accuse him."

"Hah!" Changxi let out a heavy sigh.

Li Ximing, however, felt a jolt. _Haiying_ could only be Kong Haiying, the Purple Mansion seed of the Kong family, currently in seclusion for his breakthrough. From their words, it seemed Kong Haiying and Zhang Lingshu had nearly become Dao companions.

'This is a blood feud,' he realized. 'If I were Yehui, the moment Changxi dies, I would invade the wilderness... I'd strike at Profound Peak Gate until it trembled, then press the attack, disrupting Kong Haiying's breakthrough and ensuring his failure.'

It was a grudge tantamount to murdering one's beloved. Yehui understood the gravity of the situation, which only deepened Changxi's worries.

'So there was more to the story.' A flash of annoyance at Changxi's secrecy crossed Li Ximing's mind, but this was not the time or place to show it. Besides, the source of his own clan's conflict with Yehui was now crystal clear and seemingly irreconcilable. He lowered his head and sipped his tea.

Changxi, who had been watching him closely, felt the awkwardness and quickly moved the conversation along. Sumian, with the wisdom of his centuries, smoothly filled the silence. "Zhaojing, are you aware... Yehui cultivates the 'Capital Guard' of the Ancient Merging lineage. It is an ancient Dao of exorcising ghosts, guarding mountains, and empowering rivers. Its history is long, and he has mastered three divine abilities. He is not to be underestimated."

Li Ximing had only just learned of the Capital Guard Dao. If not for Xiao Ruyu mentioning that Xiao Yongling's 'Eastern Feather Mountain' was of this path, the Li clan would have remained ignorant. He decided to ease the tension. "This junior is inexperienced and has never encountered the Capital Guard Dao before. I would be grateful for the senior's guidance."

"It's actually quite common in Jiangnan," Sumian said with a smile. "The Capital Guard Dao has lacked a Fruition Attainment cultivator for many years, so it has waned. Below the Purple Mansion Realm, it's unremarkable, mostly consisting of Immortal Foundations based on the spirits of mountains and rivers. There are many such cultivators here, but they are difficult to identify. Most mistake them for substitutes of the Earth or Water Virtues, or of the Upper Shaman and Hengzhu Rites, never recognizing their true nature."

"The famous 'Eastern Feather Mountain' of the Xiao clan, the 'Soul-Summoning Lore' favored by the Yue cultivators, and the 'Sorrowful Southern Water' of the Lingu family are all of this path. More famous examples... are not in Jiangnan, such as the 'Western Heaven Plateau' of the Baiqiang and the 'Northern Desert Court' of the Di tribe."

This made sense. The Li clan had once assumed Eastern Feather Mountain was an Earth Virtue foundation and had only recently learned the truth. Changxi, clearly familiar with the topic, added, "Many fallen Dao lineages survive as substitute foundations. If not for the famous Duanmu Kui appearing in Jiangnan, most cultivators would still think the 'Locust Shade Ghost' was just a Wood Virtue substitute, believing its connection to Lesser Yin made it an inferior path."

"Exactly!" Sumian laughed heartily. "As long as the cultivation art is powerful, how can the Immortal Foundation be weak?"

All three men laughed. They all knew how rare and precious powerful arts and techniques were. Unless a clan faced utter annihilation, no one would let their jade slips fall into outside hands; they would destroy them first. If not for the Immortal Mirror's transmissions, the Li clan would still be practicing the _Great River and Grand Mound Scripture_.

"No wonder they're called the Capital immortals Dao. The 'Capital' is from the Capital Guard. What mysteries do its divine abilities hold?"

Sumian lowered his head to his tea, but Changxi answered, "At the Foundation Establishment Realm, it is merely the manipulation of the baleful qi of mountains and rivers. But at the Purple Mansion Realm, one can command spirits and drive out evil, using wondrous spiritual arts to face enemies. And yet, among the Ancient Merging arts, the Capital Guard is not considered particularly demonic. Thunder and heavenly light are not its natural counters."

Li Ximing committed this to memory while trying to pry more information about Yehui's specific divine abilities. He had asked Changxi before, but he didn't know. After a few subtle attempts, it became clear Sumian was unwilling to speak on the matter.

'Either he truly doesn't know, or he's afraid of getting involved in our conflict. A cautious old master indeed.'

The three chatted for a while longer. The cold rain in the courtyard grew heavier, drumming a steady rhythm on the eaves. The fragrance of tea filled the air. A figure appeared outside and spoke respectfully through the door.

"Reporting to the Daoist Masters! The Radiant Splendor Daoist has broken through the river peaks of the Dense Cloud Sect and has slain Pingyang Zi of Pingshui Hill. He is now advancing deep into their territory. The Secret Diffusion region is in an uproar, and cultivators have already been dispatched from Baiye Creek!"

"Good." Changxi pinched his fingers, calculating the time and distance of Li Zhouwei's advance. He smiled. "Worthy of being called the White Qilin of the Li clan! Now, Yehui will be forced to act."

Li Ximing stroked his beard and smiled, though a deeper thought surfaced in his mind.

'Here we sit, discussing idle matters over tea in the cold rain. Yet in the shadows of our robes, generals march and soldiers move, breaking formations and slaying enemies. Thousands of lives are maneuvered like pieces on a board. A Foundation Establishment cultivator, a master of his own domain, is reduced to a bargaining chip. The hegemon of a river, on whom countless cultivators depend, is nothing more than a watchtower...'

'This is the Purple Mansion Realm... this is true power.'

Li Ximing had not forgotten the generations of his ancestors who had been swept along like driftwood in the currents of Purple Mansion cultivators, used as pawns and sacrificed. From the moment Li Tongya first looked up from Mount Huaqian to Li Qinghong flying alone into the Eastern Sea, the clan had sacrificed everything to push him to where he sat today.

'I will trade the freedom of my divine abilities for the peace and prosperity of ten thousand households.'

Li Ximing finished his tea and rose with Changxi to take their leave. Sumian knew they were heading for the Baijiang Creek region and did not detain them, simply having Qiuxin escort them out. The young man seemed to be related to the Kong family by marriage and was quite close with Changxi.

As they stepped out of the courtyard, Qiuxin bowed to Li Ximing. "There is something I must return to the Daoist Master," he said respectfully.

He drew an object from his sleeve and presented it with both hands. It was a small purple cauldron with two handles and three legs, covered in intricate patterns that seemed to shimmer with faint flames.

Four small, elegantly inscribed characters were on the lid: "Shengle, Tuoba."

Not waiting for Li Ximing to ask, he explained, "Years ago, when our temple was still in the Eastern Sea, I accepted an invitation from Xi Chang of the Chunyi Dao Gate to exorcise demons at an estuary near Lake Xian. There, we encountered a cultivator from your esteemed clan who practiced thunder arts. We did not make things difficult for her and allowed her to leave, but she left an old man behind."

"He was killed by the Chunyi Dao Gate, but I kept this item. I return it to you now to settle the matter."

Li Ximing actually remembered the incident. The old man was Yu Yuwei of the Yu family, whom Li Xizhi had mentioned was the maternal uncle of Li Quantao from the Azure Pond Sect. Qiuxin—or rather, Sumian—was unsure of the connection and decided to return the item to be safe.

Li Ximing accepted it casually. "This belongs to a cultivator of the Yu family. If I have the chance, I will see that it reaches his relatives."

Changxi watched with a pleased expression. His sharp eyes noticed something else. "How did you get injured?" he asked Qiuxin.

"Replying to the Daoist Master," Qiuxin said respectfully, "the spirit mine at the Quanyuan ferry was overrun by a school of Xu Water Demon Perch from the sea. I was injured while rescuing people."

"Ah," Changxi said. "Those demon perch have some backing. Their constant harassment must be trying for you."

Li Ximing understood the implication immediately but kept his expression neutral. He scoffed internally. 'A subtle hint, is it? But my clan has no connection to dragon-kind! What Xu Water Demon Perch? What am I supposed to do about it?'

---

Meanwhile, in the territory of Dense Cloud Cave.

Dense Cloud Cave lay slightly northeast of Floating Cloud Cave, further downstream. The terrain was more varied, not just rolling hills but also gentle plains and several towering peaks. It was a fine piece of land.

Beyond the border at Pingshui Hill, several bustling cities came into view. Li Zhouwei flew high above, his cloak whipping in the wind. His armor gleamed, his great halberd held at the ready, and in his other hand, he carried a gruesome, severed head.

Pingyang Zi had been a demonic cultivator from the Eastern Sea, a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator of decent strength, certainly stronger than Wen Yi. But the formation on his mountain was only at the Qi Refining level. Surrounded by Li Chenghui and Li Minggong, there was no escape. Li Zhouwei had ended his life with a single strike of his halberd.

Now, having crossed Pingshui Hill, they were deep in enemy territory. The cities below were in chaos. Li Chenghui looked down with a trace of regret. "These cities are well-managed. It's a shame we don't have the strength to secure them. We must focus on the main peak."

Li Zhouwei nodded and made a quick estimation. "Dense Cloud Cave abducted the population of Floating Cloud Cave. Including their original people, there should be over a million mortals here. That's a significant prize."

Population was still a vital resource for the Li clan. They had no shortage of cultivators at the Embryonic Breathing and miscellaneous Qi stages, but they were desperately lacking at the Foundation Establishment level. They couldn't even manage their own affairs, which was why they had taken the risk of employing men like Qu Bushi.

Large families that had produced Foundation Establishment cultivators were valuable not only for their potential to provide guest retainers but also for their ability to supply a steady stream of mid and late-stage Qi Refining cultivators with pure Qi. These were the true backbone needed to govern a region, unlike the Li clan's current situation, where they had fewer than ten late-stage Qi Refining cultivators, most of whom were either elderly or from the direct family line.

# Chapter 716: Wenhu

Li Zhouwei hoped that the clan's core members could spend more time on their cultivation. People like Li Minggong and Li Chenghui had already lost years to other duties. The matter of Mount Qingdu had been unavoidable, but everything else felt like a waste of their precious time.

'Of the old Moongaze Lake families, the Yu had a noble ancestry, but their main line was extinct. Fortunately, we gained the An family, who have become a cornerstone of our strength. The Fei family, on the other hand, never had a strong foundation and struggled to produce Foundation Establishment cultivators. As vassals, they were always a step removed.'

The An patriarch, his son, and even his grandsons all held respectable positions within the Li clan. An Siwei was even the first outsider to reach Foundation Establishment under their banner. Their loyalty was unquestionable, but relying so heavily on another family was not a good long-term solution.

Li Zhouwei had been keeping this in mind. As they flew, he took note of the size of each city and the number of cultivators present, making a quick calculation.

"The White Ye Immortal Sect must know by now," he said. "Their spirit vessel can be here in less than fifteen minutes!"

Li Zhouwei had discussed this with Li Ximing beforehand. As a Purple Mansion cultivator, Li Ximing's attitude toward Wenhu had been remarkably lenient, making it clear that he wished to avoid conflict and settle matters peacefully.

The Capital immortals Dao had likely not anticipated the Li clan's sudden, explosive attack. But considering their strange and unpredictable arts, it was safest to assume they had known the moment the assault began.

Li Chenghui nodded. "Fifteen minutes... That's only enough time for us to capture two more mountains. Once the Capital immortals Dao arrives, regardless of how they react, we'll be forced into a stalemate. The borders will be redrawn, and it will be much harder to make a move in the future."

The Capital immortals Dao was a Purple Mansion sect that had relocated from the Eastern Sea, a far cry from the cultivators of Dense Cloud Cave. Wenhu, the most formidable figure in the entire cave, would only be considered a "Peak Lord" in the Capital immortals Dao. Miaoshui was nothing more than a guest retainer.

'Two more mountains...'

Even if they took two more mountains, they would only control forty percent of the territory—not enough to split the region evenly with the Capital immortals Dao. That wasn't good enough for Li Zhouwei. And that was only the first problem.

"Furthermore... the Ding family is at the foot of Hongfu Mountain, the main peak of Dense Cloud Cave..."

When Floating Cloud Cave was breached, the Ding family—a local power with over ten thousand members—had been captured and relocated to Hongfu Mountain. Ding Weizeng was destined to become one of the clan's key commanders, and it wouldn't do to have his people in enemy hands.

Seeing Li Zhouwei's frown, Li Chenghui, who was well aware of the situation, said gravely, "If we can take Hongfu Peak, seventy percent of the territory will be ours."

"Taking it would be ideal. If you and I went together, my aunt and An Siwei could capture the two mountains behind us. But if we fail and get pinned down deep in their territory, we'll be in trouble!"

Li Zhouwei possessed a Purple Mansion-grade talisman called the Xuanqin Baoyou, which could summon a divine ability to protect him. With it, he could move freely through Jiangbei. The talisman was a gift from Daoist Master Yuanwu to Yu Muxian. After the Li clan killed Yu Muxian, it had fallen into their hands.

At the time, only two cultivators in the Azure Pond Sect were skilled enough in the Dao of talismans to have reached the Purple Mansion Realm. One was Chi Wei, whose cultivation of Pristine Water aided his craft, and the other was Daoist Master Yuanxiu, who came from a long line of talisman masters. Li Xuanfeng had asked Daoist Master Yuanxiu about the talisman, and he had recognized it as his own work, as they had both studied under the same master. Thus, Li Zhouwei now had a Purple Mansion talisman at his disposal. Even if surrounded, he could escape. Li Chenghui, however, could not.

As he spoke, the Great Void rippled, and a heroic figure with a swallow's jaw and a bristling beard emerged. He was tall and powerfully built, with the broad back and muscular waist of a tiger, and clad in crimson soft armor, exuding a formidable aura.

"Greetings, Clan Lord!"

Li Ximing's decision to send Ding Weizeng was a timely relief! Li Zhouwei laughed heartily. "Congratulations, Weizeng!"

"This subordinate does not dare accept such praise!"

Ding Weizeng was built like a tiger, a full head taller than the men beside him. Li Zhouwei knew that Li Ximing must have healed his injuries, and he was thrilled. But this was no time for idle talk.

"With you here, Weizeng, I'm confident we can succeed! Clan Uncle, Aunt Minggong, you will lead our forces and secure the rear. Weizeng and I will make a lightning raid on Hongfu Mountain and rescue the Ding family!"

He sheathed his great halberd. Ding Weizeng was stunned by the order, only then realizing his entire family had been taken to Hongfu Mountain. He was deeply moved, but he still advised caution. "Clan Lord, Hongfu Mountain is defended by four Foundation Establishment cultivators, including Wenhu and Wang He. They are not to be underestimated, and they have a Foundation Establishment-grade array. For the two of us to go alone is too risky."

Li Zhouwei gestured toward Miaoshui. "We'll have her, too," he said with a smile.

Ding Weizeng frowned but still summoned a gust of wind to carry them eastward. As they flew at top speed, Li Zhouwei added, "Besides... with the current situation, do you really think all four of them are still guarding Hongfu Mountain? And did I say we were going to launch a direct assault? His Immortal Foundation is Hurricane Ghost Yin. My family cultivates Bright Yang, Thunder, and True Fire. He's walked right into the blade!"

---

"Li Zhouwei broke through Pingshui Hill?"

Wenhu stood on a mountain peak, his expression grim, his heart filled with a terrible unease.

Ever since he learned that Yehui had not gone to the Li clan, Wenhu had maintained a calm exterior, but inwardly he knew things had taken a turn for the worse. The relationship between the Li clan and their backer, the Capital immortals Dao, was bound to sour, and he was caught in the middle. His end would not be a pleasant one.

'What is this madness...'

He was at his wits' end. Though the White Ye Immortal Sect would receive the news no later than he did, he still dispatched a messenger before pacing back and forth in agitation.

'In this situation, my only path is to hold back the Li clan for the Capital immortals Dao for as long as possible!'

His fears from the moment he'd left the Li clan's territory had become reality, but he never thought it would happen so quickly. More tragically, Pingwang Zi's words had also come true.

'A bird seeks a branch, a man seeks a master. There's no chance to play both sides.'

"The men from the White Ye Immortal Sect will be here soon, so I don't have to worry about dying. Right now, no one can stop Li Zhouwei. I have to go myself."

Though he had only been a guest retainer in the Eastern Sea and lacked command experience, he understood the basics of defense. He appointed one person to guard the mountain and took the other two with him as reinforcements.

Wenhu understood deeply that anyone in Dense Cloud Cave could surrender to the Li clan except him. He had been personally recruited by Daoist Master Yehui. The others served him; he served a Purple Mansion cultivator.

'Purple Mansion cultivators are beings on high. There's nothing they can't negotiate. All this territory is just a bargaining chip. If I surrender to the Li clan and the two sides make peace, I'll be the one they sacrifice.'

'My only way to survive now is to throw my full support behind the Capital immortals Dao and resist the Li clan. The more ruthless I am, the better my chances of survival. It won't be more than thirty minutes. Li Zhouwei can't kill me in that time!'

Wenhu was, after all, Yehui's man. He had seen more of the world. While Miaoshui needed Li Zhouwei's prompting, he understood the gravity of his situation on his own. He flew out from the mountain and had traveled barely thirty miles when his vision flashed and a sharp pain erupted in his chest.

"Ah!"

Wenhu vaguely saw a shower of sparks and thick white mist rise from his chest, followed by a searing pain. A brilliant light shot toward him from the distance. He quickly pressed down on the wound, swallowed the blood rising in his throat, and roared, "Li Zhouwei!"

The great halberd grew from a distant meteor to fill his vision. A cold sweat broke out on Wenhu's back. He was confident Li Zhouwei couldn't kill him, but that didn't mean he could survive two strikes from this White Qilin after being caught off guard. He hastily clapped his hands together, summoning a stream of pure qi.

As the qi billowed out, Wenhu reappeared dozens of feet away. The wound on his chest was sealed, but his spiritual qi was draining away in waves. He silently gave thanks.

'Thankfully... Bright Yang is a noble, righteous path. Using its Profound Light for a sneak attack diminishes its power... otherwise, that blow would have been devastating...'

The halberd was already stabbing toward his chest. Wenhu had no time for curses. He activated a white jade artifact and threw up a talisman to block the attack. The young man materialized before him, his golden eyes dark and deep.

"You're a clever one," he said with a smile.

"Clang!"

As he spoke, the halberd slammed into the artifact, shattering the talisman's protective light. The white jade artifact groaned under the strain. Wenhu had specifically bought it after the True Monarch's ascension, and it had indeed proven its worth. He spat out a mouthful of black gas.

"Hoo!"

A gale tore through the forest, thick with black, sinister qi. The light rain falling from the sky seemed to empower his Immortal Foundation, Hurricane Ghost Yin, and frost began to form on the ground.

But Wenhu felt no confidence.

The reason was simple: the Li clan's patriarch had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm through the Bright Yang Dao!

As expected, Li Zhouwei simply drew a small flag from his sleeve and tossed it into the air. In an instant, the wind died and the rain stopped. Five-colored Li Fire—ochre, pale yellow, canary yellow, bright red, and crimson—leapt into existence, bathing the area in brilliant light and burning away the yin energy.

Wenhu felt a wave of helplessness, but at least he had bought a moment. His two subordinates quickly gathered around him. One of them, Wang He, held a feather fan and was Wenhu's most capable officer. His face was etched with apprehension.

Before Wenhu could feel any relief, a reddish-bronze halo appeared. The brawny, bearded warrior materialized in mid-air, a cold sneer on his face, his eyes locked onto them.

"Ding! Wei! Zeng!"

For the first time, Wenhu's mind went completely blank. He instantly understood what had happened. The black qi swirled in his hands, but he could only watch as Ding Weizeng, his expression like ice, slammed a palm down, crushing Wang He. The man stood in the air like a great tiger, watching its prey.

In that instant, envy, jealousy, and terror flooded Wenhu's heart.

Honestly, Wenhu had not wanted to offend the Li clan, nor the Capital immortals Dao behind him. He knew he wasn't even a pawn in their game; the slightest displeasure from either side would result in a miserable end for him.

That was why he hadn't stayed to defend Hongfu Mountain!

Did he not know that holding the mountain was the strategy that would incur the fewest losses? With four men defending the array, no matter how fiercely Li Zhouwei attacked, they would lose no more than half their territory. If Hongfu Mountain held, when the Capital immortals Dao arrived, the Li clan would gain no advantage in the region.

But Yehui had many enemies within the Capital immortals Dao. If Wenhu just sat in the mountain like a dead man, those stubborn purists in the sect would surely speak out. He had to be seriously injured, and losing territory was an expected outcome—after all, his opponent was a Purple Mansion clan, and the attacker was Li Zhouwei himself.

However, if he defended the mountain to the last, the Li clan's interests would be severely hampered, and they would hate him for it. Wenhu had no desire to provoke the Purple Mansion cultivator Zhaojing or the future Purple Mansion cultivator Li Zhouwei. Ceding Hongfu Mountain was the only way to satisfy them.

Thus, between the crime of incompetence and the crime of cowardice and treachery, he had chosen the former.

In his scenario, Miaoshui would most likely surrender. Li Zhouwei would seize the opportunity to occupy the mountain, then turn to besiege him. He would be gravely wounded, and then rescued by the Capital immortals Dao. How the two clans divided the territory afterward would have nothing to do with him. That was the only way to avoid offending either side!

But Li Zhouwei had cornered him here... and Ding Weizeng, the man he had looked down upon, had become a formidable general of the Li clan!

Wenhu nearly lost his composure. He couldn't stop the bitter thought from rising in his heart.

'A hundred cunning schemes are no match for a handsome face and a powerful lineage. A thousand careful calculations cannot compare to a fate that turns disaster into fortune!'

But he was a rogue cultivator who had risen to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the disciples of great sects. His willpower was extraordinary. He instantly regained his clarity. Though the Profound Light searing his body sent up wisps of green smoke, he grit his teeth and did his best to parry Li Zhouwei's halberd.

In terms of pure cultivation, Wenhu was far superior to Li Zhouwei, having already broken through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment. With a different Dao foundation, he might have been able to fight the White Qilin to a standstill.

But now, his artifacts and techniques were inferior, his Immortal Foundation was completely suppressed, and he had been wounded from the start. His spiritual qi flowed with difficulty, and he could only rely on his vast experience and deep reserves to barely hold on.

Li Zhouwei had no time to waste. He formed a hand seal, pointing his index finger forward. A hint of sunlight pierced through the clouds, and a brilliant light gathered at his fingertip.

"Sun's Resonant Parting Art!"

The Sun's Resonant Parting Art was an art of endless variations. At this moment, it reflected the sunlight, seizing control of the jade shield. The dark silhouette of the great halberd plunged toward the wound on Wenhu's chest.

But Wenhu was no ordinary man. He bit down hard on his tongue and spat out a mouthful of essence blood. A roaring sound erupted from his mouth as a torrent of deep black light shot toward Li Zhouwei, shattering the Profound Light around him.

For the first time, a look of surprise crossed Li Zhouwei's face.

"The Great Wind of the Abyssal Depths?"

This was not, of course, the true Great Wind of the Abyssal Depths, famed for its ability to disarm opponents. Wenhu had only managed to imitate some of its profound power using his Hurricane Ghost Yin foundation, but it was enough to catch an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator off guard and cause Li Zhouwei to pause for a fraction of a second.

But Li Zhouwei was familiar with this wind. The Great Wind of the Abyssal Depths from his clan's Chongming Profound Insight Screen was far more powerful. That artifact, however, had an extraordinary origin and was currently in Li Ximing's possession.

He broke free with a slight struggle, and the great wind lost its source. Although Wenhu hadn't expected him to escape so quickly, his next spell was already complete. A black light coalesced around him.

"By my decree!" he said coldly.

A blast of black light erupted, stirring up a hurricane of ghostly qi. A light shone from between Li Zhouwei's brows as Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light flew out to meet it. The two attacks collided with a deafening roar.

"Boom!"

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light effortlessly obliterated the black light and slammed into the distant Wenhu, who was still controlling his jade shield. The shield billowed with white smoke and was covered in cracks. Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes, his golden gaze sweeping the area.

'A fine technique!'

He took a step north, leaving Wenhu behind. The great halberd shone with celestial light as he thrust it into the empty air. A muffled cry of pain was heard as a figure was forced out of hiding, his face covered in blood. Who could it be but Wenhu?

"To cultivate a minor foundation like Hurricane Ghost Yin to such a degree... you're quite the talent!"

# Chapter 717: The Probe

With a single motion, Li Zhouwei ran his halberd through Wenhu’s trusted subordinate. He flexed his forearm, flipping the man over on the weapon’s shaft. Wenhu, his face pale and smeared with blood, continued to desperately conjure techniques, a bloody light surging around him as he prepared to fight to the death.

Li Zhouwei raised his other hand, and a brilliant radiance descended, enveloping Wenhu’s face and suppressing him. The Sun's Resonant Parting Art was a fifth-grade art that excelled in subduing foes with its endless variations. Wenhu's Hurricane Ghost Yin foundation was not only weak to Bright Yang, but even more so to Supreme Yang. The instant the light struck him, his techniques scattered, and a wave of searing heat washed over his mind, nearly knocking him unconscious.

Yet Wenhu clenched his jaw, forcing his eyes open on a single held breath. Though the sun’s radiance had burned his eyes milky-white and scorched his face, he still reached for his storage pouch.

'Impressive. Truly impressive willpower.'

Li Zhouwei merely withdrew his halberd, then unleashed Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light from between his brows, severing both of Wenhu's arms. He bound the man in solar light, rendering him immobile.

Meanwhile, Ding Weizeng had already beaten the other two cultivators into a sorry state. His Immortal Foundation was incredibly potent, suffusing his body with a flowing red light and turning his pupils a brownish-yellow. The weaker of the two demonic cultivators was half-dead and out of the fight, leaving only the cave's second-in-command, Wang He, struggling to hold on.

After subduing Wenhu, Li Zhouwei’s gaze swept over the remaining fight, causing Wang He to break out in a cold sweat, his heart seized with fear. Just as he was about to speak, a white light flared on the horizon.

The light flickered once before appearing right in front of them, landing beside Wang He in a streak of light and revealing its true form.

"I am Song Yunbai of the Capital immortals Dao. Greetings, fellow Daoist."

A woman materialized, her hands forming a seal around a talisman. She had a slightly round face with sharp eyebrows and was dressed in a crisp white robe, her features typical of those from Jiangbei. Her sharp gaze fixed on Li Zhouwei and Ding Weizeng.

She clearly didn't recognize either of them. Her eyes swept over Ding Weizeng, pausing for only a moment before settling on Li Zhouwei.

Song Yunbai froze, a strange expression on her face. She took a half-step back, suddenly hesitant. Her bright gaze quickly shifted away, and her voice became somewhat muted.

"Dense Cloud Cave was brought to enlightenment by my Capital immortals Dao. For your clan to attack without cause… what is the meaning of this?"

Wang He and the other survivor retreated behind her. Li Zhouwei, halberd in hand, replied, "So, a friend from the Capital immortals Dao. This Wenhu from Dense Cloud Cave deceived a Daoist Master and offended the dignity of a Purple Mansion cultivator. I came specifically to apprehend him. Now that he is captured, I intend to take him away."

Song Yunbai's tone was polite, so Li Zhouwei saw no need to start with threats. He simply held his captive, creating a standoff. In the time it took for this brief exchange, thunder rumbled from behind them, and two figures arrived amidst flowing True Fire.

A radiant and graceful woman holding a lamp and a man with eyes like polished lacquer riding a bolt of lightning—it was the siblings, Li Minggong and Li Chenghui. Before they could even speak, two more streaks of light shot in from the north and south, stopping nearby.

The lights resolved into human forms. On the left stood a tall woman in a colorful dress, holding a jade-green ribbon. Her expression was one of fury. To the right was a man in a bamboo hat and brown clothes, a saber at his waist, carefully observing the scene.

"What is the meaning of this, Li clan!" the woman in the colorful dress demanded without preamble. She brandished her ribbon-like artifact, pointed at Wenhu, and raged, "This cultivator was personally guided by our Daoist Chidu! Your clan is a noble family of Jiangnan. Are you truly unaware that Dense Cloud Cave is a vassal of our Capital immortals Dao? We were already being exceedingly generous by allowing you to take the territory of Floating Cloud Cave! How dare you press your advantage and invade Dense Cloud Cave!"

"Ridiculous!" Li Chenghui wasn't about to let Li Zhouwei personally engage in a shouting match. He stepped forward and said coldly, "Since you are so aware that Dense Cloud Cave is your vassal, have you ever bothered to manage their actions? For ten years, Dense Cloud and Floating Cloud have harassed the northern shores of our Moongaze Lake. Did you ever say a single word then? You only show up now, conveniently late, and act as if you’ve been wronged?"

"You!" The woman’s fury rose, and she gave a cold, mocking laugh.

The man in the bamboo hat finally spoke, cupping his hands in a salute. "I am Gongsun Bofan of the Capital immortals Dao. Greetings to the three noble scions of the immortal clan. Now that the esteemed master of your clan has reached the Purple Mansion Realm, these past matters should be swept away. Even if you cannot let bygones be bygones, it should be a matter for Purple Mansion cultivators to discuss and resolve. There was no need to strike so suddenly and seize our interests."

He addressed all three of them, and Li Minggong replied, "Good. Since your sect is aware that our clan's master has ascended, do you know who you sent to congratulate him? And with what gifts? Given how Floating Cloud and Dense Cloud provoked us, do you think our master didn't give them a chance? Did your sect truly have no idea how this situation came to be?"

Li Minggong’s tone was not harsh, but her questions silenced Gongsun Bofan. It was not his place to answer such things, and he lowered his head in silence.

Watching the brief exchange, Li Zhouwei was already beginning to form a theory. No organization was a monolith, especially not the Capital immortals Dao, which had only been in Jiangbei for a little over a decade.

The first to arrive, Song Yunbai, was the lowest in status and weakest in power. She was only here first because she was the closest. She likely represented a local power, the White Ye Song family, holding a position in the Capital immortals Dao similar to Li Xizhi’s former role in the Azure Pond Sect. Naturally, she wouldn’t be hostile, preferring to remain detached, hence her polite words.

Gongsun Bofan was undoubtedly a guest retainer, much like An Siwei was to the Li clan. Though he defended the Capital immortals Dao, he held no real decision-making power, so he also tried to be diplomatic.

Only the furious woman in the colorful dress was likely a true core disciple of the Capital immortals Dao.

Just as he predicted, Gongsun Bofan fell silent, and the woman gritted her teeth. "If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a pretext. Just admit you covet the territory instead of hiding behind false accusations! We are in Jiangbei, you are in Jiangnan. We had no obligation to congratulate you, so why make such demands!"

Seeing her completely ignore Dense Cloud Cave's past transgressions and cling to any point that favored her, Li Chenghui's face hardened. He knew that the Chengyun Gate, another Jiangbei power, had sent their sect master to offer congratulations!

Having sorted out their identities, Li Zhouwei finally spoke. "There's no need for further talk. Dense Cloud Cave harassed my clan for ten years and nearly killed my direct kin on several occasions. This debt must be paid. My family has already taken Hongfu Mountain. You should all return to where you came from!"

Li Zhouwei had already sent Miaoshui to take Hongfu Mountain. With her access token, she would have entered the mountain by now. The woman in the colorful dress had anticipated his words and gave a cold sneer. "Do you really think you have us cornered?"

The moment she spoke, the tension snapped. Swords were drawn and bows were strung. Li Chenghui’s hand immediately went to his Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman. Gongsun Bofan also gripped the hilt of his saber, while Wang He and the others exchanged terrified glances, their faces slick with sweat.

In truth, Li Zhouwei was not afraid of them. Before Ding Weizeng arrived, he might have had to weigh his options, but now, with the brawny warrior and Li Chenghui by his side, they were more than a match for the three newcomers.

'I'm only worried about more Capital immortals Dao reinforcements…'

It was almost certain that in the Great Void, Purple Mansion cultivators were already facing off. If Li Zhouwei fought them now, a victory would be fine, but a loss would mean Li Ximing would also lose a step in his own confrontation, putting him at a disadvantage.

He weighed his options, holding his halberd ready. His eyes narrowed, his intentions unreadable, as he said coldly, "You are welcome to try!"

Just then, a loud laugh echoed from the horizon, and a voice called out, "Friend Minghuang, I've come to help you!"

All eyes turned to see a brownish-yellow spirit vessel made of profound stone speeding toward them, parting the air in its wake. Standing at the prow was a man in a patterned black robe. He was clean-shaven with a pale face and looked rather anxious. It was none other than Kong Guxi, the Sect Master of the Profound Peak Gate!

The face of the woman in the colorful dress changed instantly. Realization dawned, and she let out a laugh that was more rage than mirth. "I see now, I see! So you two families have colluded. No wonder you were so bold!"

Kong Guxi arrived in a flash. Four figures disembarked from the spirit vessel behind him—three men and a woman, two of whom were mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. The five of them stood with the Li clan, and the tables immediately turned.

Yet the woman in the colorful dress seemed utterly fearless. Her gaze shot past them to land squarely on Kong Guxi. "Kong Guxi!" she yelled. "How much of your master's lifespan is left? How dare you antagonize my Capital immortals Dao!"

Kong Guxi met her glare with a cold expression of his own.

Though he was all smiles with the Li clan, when the pale, beardless man turned grim, he possessed a chilling ferocity. "I've been sick of the sight of you for ages!" he cursed. "You cultivate some cursed, headless ghost Dao, and you strut around with more arrogance than a dragon princess!"

His words, so unlike him, came like a slap to the face. They stunned the woman into silence, her face flushing red. Just as she was about to retaliate, Gongsun Bofan grabbed her. "Watch out!" he shouted.

The woman instinctively turned her head and saw a brilliant light emanating from between the brows of the man with the halberd—a vast, majestic radiance of Bright Yang.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

Li Zhouwei had planned this all along, waiting for the exact moment her gaze was diverted. His ability erupted, smashing toward her. In that split second, a sharp clang rang out as a cold light flared to life.

Gongsun Bofan had drawn his saber, unleashing a wave of Geng Metal light to block the attack. In an instant, the tense silence was shattered by the roar of thunder, the surge of True Fire, the rise of earthen mountains, and the clash of Geng Metal.

---

In the Great Void.

Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back, clad in a white and gold Daoist robe. A brilliant light shone from his brow, and the rainbow glow of his divine ability pulsed around him. Beside him, Changxi had channeled his own power to its peak, appearing as a middle-aged man with a white jade pendant on his chest.

Before them stood another man in a deep blue robe. He had a short, sharp-featured face that was rather handsome and spirited. He cradled a sword in his arms, his long hair tied back behind his head. He was seated on a crow-like beast covered in scales, its eyes like pools of ink. The Daoist watched them in cold silence.

"Daoist Yehui," Changxi said, his voice cold.

Yehui, caressing the slender, elegant ritual sword in his arms, finally spoke. "Zhaojing, what is the meaning of this?"

He seemed genuinely surprised, as if he had never expected the Li clan to erupt so suddenly, let alone take up the Profound Peak Gate's cause. He ran a hand along the blade. "I thought you were just placating the old man," he said softly. "Waiting for him to die so our two families could split the Profound Peak Gate's assets fifty-fifty. No grand campaigns, no confrontation between Purple Mansion cultivators. Wouldn't that have been better?"

The sword in his hands did not seem to be a weapon of the sword Dao, but rather a ritual instrument for casting spells. It pulsed with rings of spiritual light. Yehui smiled. "Then we could have negotiated our interests. The Profound Peak's territory would be up for grabs, its people would go to you, the mountain gate to me…"

"I never thought that while I held back, you would be the one to move on my things. Now it’s come to a confrontation between us, creating all this unpleasantness. What was the point?"

The smile faded from Yehui's voice. He sighed. "You truly want to make an enemy of me… A mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator in his prime versus a crumbling sect with no Purple Mansion master… Is the choice not obvious?"

He completely ignored Changxi, as if the man wasn't even there, speaking only to Li Ximing. Changxi’s expression darkened. "Yehui!" he growled.

Yehui glanced at him. "Do you wish to fight me to the death, old-timer? You're nothing but a divine ability. What good would sacrificing yourself do? You're already at death's door, yet you still insist on meddling and sowing discord."

Changxi fell silent.

Li Ximing finally spoke. "There is no need for such pretense, friend Yehui. Dense Cloud Cave has harmed my clan on numerous occasions, and Daoist Chidu has also acted without courtesy. If your sect had shown even an ounce of goodwill, we would not be at this point."

"Hahaha," Yehui laughed. "And what if we didn't? There is no friendship between Purple Mansion cultivators, no goodwill. If you fail to see that, Zhaojing, you will suffer for it sooner or later."

He seemed to have no desire to talk further. "Since Wenhu offended your family, you can have the rogue cultivator. I won't hold the losses in Dense Cloud Cave against you. Retreat to Floating Cloud's territory, and there is still room for negotiation between our families!"

"Retreat?" Li Ximing’s hand, hidden in his sleeve, tightened slightly. He didn't believe a single word of Yehui’s offer. Splitting the Profound Peak Gate, negotiating interests later—it all sounded tempting, but it was just his side of the story.

Besides, saving the Profound Peak Gate didn't mean he had to defend them on all fronts. Li Ximing had a favorable impression of the Xuanmiao Temple, and now he had even more leverage. Not to mention there was still Mount Jingyi across the sea.

He said coldly, "Since you were unwilling to offer congratulations for my ascension, I will take the territory of Dense Cloud Cave as my congratulatory gift!"

Yehui's brow furrowed. He stared at Li Ximing from across the Great Void, and ripples of spiritual light seemed to spread between them. The ritual sword in his hands began to tremble. Changxi stood firm, his stance making his intentions clear.

Li Ximing was not afraid of a fight. Not only did he have Changxi, who cared little for his own life, but the moment they clashed, the ones who would suffer most would be the Capital immortals Dao disciples on the ground. By the time their battle concluded days later, Li Zhouwei would have probably fought his way to the White Ye region.

"Fine, fine, fine," Yehui said, nodding. "You can have the territory. But remember this, Li Ximing: you did not win Dense Cloud Cave through some grand strategy. When that old man finally dies, I'd like to see how you handle the fallout!"

"You need not trouble yourself with my affairs!" Li Ximing replied with a smile.

Yehui sneered and turned, vanishing back into the Great Void. A single, cold parting shot remained.

"Old-timer, the Profound Peak Gate will inevitably be carved up by the other families. That day is not far off!"

Changxi remained silent. Li Ximing watched Yehui depart but offered no words of comfort. The old master had, after all, concealed the truth about Kong Haiying, and Li Ximing was still displeased with him. He was in no mood to offer consolation.

The two of them steered their divine abilities back toward the lake. Changxi finally sighed. "I have made a fool of myself in front of Zhaojing…"

# Chapter 718: Entering Dense Cloud

"You're too kind, Senior," Li Ximing replied, though he didn't pursue the topic. He gazed through the Great Void. Li Zhouwei and the others had clashed briefly with the core disciples of the Capital immortals Dao. Both sides had suffered minor injuries, but once Yehui departed, the Capital immortals Dao cultivators ceased their attack and retreated to the few remaining mountains under their control in Dense Cloud Cave's territory.

'We've taken about seventy percent of the territory. That's not a small gain.'

Leaving the affairs of Dense Cloud Cave to Li Zhouwei and his group, Li Ximing steered his divine ability away. He remained silent on the journey, a clear sign of his displeasure. Changxi, of course, noticed and could only sigh inwardly. When they landed on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, the old Daoist Master spoke in a weary voice.

"Yehui is a cultivator from the Eastern Sea. Though he was fortunate in his Dao lineage to have reached his current level, his words are not to be trusted. Zhaojing, don't let them trouble your mind."

Li Ximing's mind was a tangle of its own. Yehui's provocations held little credibility. If that Purple Mansion cultivator from the Capital immortals Dao truly intended to carve up the Profound Peak Gate, wouldn't it have been more logical for him to send congratulatory gifts and make his intentions clear sooner?

But now, a different question arose in Li Ximing's thoughts.

'Then why didn't he?'

Even if Changxi were to die, there was no way Yehui could seize all of the Profound Peak Gate's territory. The Li clan was right next door. If trouble befell the Profound Peak Gate, the Li clan's intervention would be seen as assistance, while the Capital immortals Dao's would be seen as an invasion. The speed at which they could take control of the land would be worlds apart.

From Li Ximing's perspective, if Yehui wanted to occupy a larger share of the Profound Peak Gate's territory, he shouldn't have pushed them toward the Li clan. Even if he bore the Li clan ill will, he should have feigned goodwill for the time being, pretending to have no interest in the Profound Peak Gate. That would have made a future betrayal far more convenient.

'As it stands now, with Changxi still alive, my clan will send people to help defend their borders. He'll have to face the united front of the Profound Peak and Moongaze Lake clans. The difficulty is a world of difference from what it was before!'

'Either he has some other ace up his sleeve… or his goal isn't the Profound Peak Gate's territory at all…'

Li Ximing still had no idea what Daoist Master Yehui truly wanted, and that was the most dangerous part. He dismissed the man's arrogant words as mere misdirection.

As he was lost in thought, Changxi continued, "Zhaojing, although Yehui has retreated, it's only because he is unwilling to clash with us at this moment…"

Li Ximing frowned. "Is Yehui truly so arrogant that he doesn't fear a counterattack from you, Senior? If you know anything more, I must ask you to tell me everything. Any concealment now could lead to disaster."

Changxi had previously hidden the fact that Kong Haiying's wife had been killed by Yehui. This was no small matter. In the future, Yehui's ambitions would extend beyond the Profound Peak Gate's territory and Dao lineage; he would be after the lives of Kong Haiying's entire line. The feud would escalate to an entirely new level.

Changxi didn't have much time left, and Yehui was already an enemy. Li Ximing felt it wasn't his place to press the matter of Kong Haiying, but he had made his current request clear. Changxi nodded with a heavy sigh.

At this point, he no longer held anything back. "Zhaojing, you may not know this, but he possesses two spell-type divine abilities and one body-type divine ability. My Fool's Mountain Chase can neither suppress nor entangle him. While I could likely injure him if I fought to the death, it's not that simple."

"Years ago, Daoist Master Chonghe of the Wuzhu Gate, a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, pursued Yanque of the Hengzhu lineage. Yanque's body-type divine ability dragged the chase across the Great Void of Wu-Yue for six years, yet Chonghe still couldn't succeed. The disparity between Yehui and myself is even greater."

"I am not Ning Tiaoxiao, who possesses an ancient spiritual artifact to suppress his foes. If we were to truly fight, and I was willing to throw my life away, he would surely refuse to engage me unless… he had an ambush prepared in the Great Void."

Having reached the Purple Mansion Realm himself, Li Ximing understood how difficult it was to kill another Purple Mansion cultivator when their divine abilities were of a similar level. But his intention wasn't for Changxi to fight Yehui to the death. The Capital immortals Dao was still in Jiangbei. The man could run, but could the sect?

Before he could even hint at this, Changxi continued, "As for targeting his clan's juniors… my Dao lineage still exists in this world. I cannot commit such an act that would leave my name in infamy for ten thousand years, nor can I condemn my descendants to die without a burial place, forever shouldering a cursed reputation."

"And as for attacking his sect in White Ye to force his hand… Zhaojing, think for a moment. Whose efforts nurtured the lands of Jiangbei?"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. "The conflict between the north and south… is this the will of those who have attained Fruition?"

"Exactly!" Changxi's expression was filled with sorrow. "How many people did the various sects commit to the conflict between north and south to cultivate Jiangbei into what it is today? Though it was mainly by carving flesh from the Azure Pond Sect and drinking the blood of demonic and rogue cultivators, this land is absolutely off-limits."

"The moment I set foot in White Ye, Yehui would laugh out loud. He would certainly appear to meet me, and the moment we clash, the spiritual energy in the White Ye region would be severely damaged. That would be a catastrophe."

"Before we could even truly fight, the other major powers would appear to mediate. Yuanxiu from the south, Qiushui from the west, Yuming and Shanbai from the north, Sumian from the east… even the various Buddhist sects would intervene to stop me."

Changxi looked at him deeply, his voice aged and grave. "His sect is in Jiangbei, and thus, he acts with impunity!"

Only then did Li Ximing understand why Yehui held Changxi in such low regard. He fell silent for a moment, at a loss for words. "Senior, do you have a plan? If we are limited to our current methods, I fear it will be difficult to fend off the enemy."

After all, based on the current situation, unless the Capital immortals Dao crossed the river to attack, Changxi was truly powerless. Seeing Li Ximing's troubled expression, Changxi took a sip of tea, the wrinkles on his face deepening.

The old man finally spoke. "Zhaojing, if, after my death, the situation becomes truly perilous and beyond hope, you may cede Shanji Prefecture to the Purple Smoke Gate in exchange for their protection… as long as the main gate of our sect remains, it will be enough."

Li Ximing breathed a sigh of relief and said with great solemnity, "Very well! With your words, many things become easier to handle. I only hope you will leave a letter or a handwritten note as proof."

The Kong family had cultivated Shanji Prefecture for generations, and they had never enforced a strict separation between cultivators and mortals. Not only were there many with Kong family blood, but the vast majority of the populace had deep ties to the cultivators of the sect. Li Ximing had no desire to be hailed as a savior only to be cursed later. He wanted it all in writing.

Changxi craned his neck and nodded. "This matter should not be widely known, otherwise the entire Profound Peak Gate will lose its will to fight. I have actually already written a final testament and hidden it beneath the first seat of Xiyue Hall on the main peak. I will write another copy for you now, so the two can be cross-referenced."

Li Ximing produced a sheet of spiritual cloth. Changxi used his divine ability as a brush and wrote two lines, then handed it to Li Ximing. The cloth was now as heavy as a boulder, weighing over a thousand pounds.

As the old man placed it in his hands, his aged appearance seemed to intensify. He said respectfully, "My thanks, Zhaojing!"

With that, he offered no further pleasantries, simply clasping his hands in farewell before using his divine ability to enter the Great Void and vanish.

Li Ximing turned the cloth over to read it.

"I entrust Daoist Friend Zhaojing to watch over the Profound Peak Gate. Should the situation turn dire, he has full authority to cede Shanji Prefecture to another power in exchange for aid."

Although Changxi's divine ability was not suited for combat, its profoundness was not lacking. The very act of writing produced strange phenomena. The characters were like stone carvings, looking as if they might fall right off the cloth. Li Ximing nodded to himself in appreciation.

His own divine abilities were also of the spell type, but they bordered on body arts. With the Bright Yang fire in his heart, he manifested Bright Yang both inside and out. The Purple Yang Fire resided within his Juque Palace, and the Heavenly Radiance was born between his brows. Beyond that, there was only Audience with the Celestial Gate. He was not weak in combat, but his abilities lacked versatility.

When the Li family had moved Mount Qingdu, they had invited Kong Yu for assistance. The old man had used a piece of Changxi's calligraphy to aid in moving the mountain. While the characters Li Ximing had inscribed on the six gates over his lake could reflect the heavenly light, they couldn't be used as talismans like Changxi's writing could.

'Once this is all settled, I can make a trip to the Cui family in the Eastern Sea… I should be able to find compatible cultivation methods to study there. I can also inquire about Purple Mansion-level array formations along the way… I need one that can at least cover all of Gardenia Scenery Mountain.'

'As for Yehui… I wonder what he's after… Daoist Master Chuting isn't always at Mount Xianyou, and we're not related by blood or friendship. I can't keep troubling him… Alas… if only Brother Jun were here!'

He gathered his thoughts.

'On the way, I'll sound Changxi out again. Maybe I can get the formula for a spiritual artifact embryo out of him!'

---

**Baijiang Creek.**

A brocade-like light floated over Hongfu Mountain, forming a circular halo. Soft, cotton-like motes of light drifted through it. From a distance, it looked less like a cultivator sect and more like the residence of an immortal clan.

When Li Zhouwei and the others arrived on streaks of light, Miaoshui hurriedly emerged from the array to greet them. The arrival of the cultivators from the White Ye Capital immortals Dao had terrified her. She had hidden within the formation, clutching the array disk, pretending to be oblivious. Fortunately for her, no one had paid her any mind.

Now, as Li Zhouwei flew closer, Miaoshui presented the multi-colored array disk with both hands.

"Greetings, Clan Head. This is the array disk for the Grand Array of Cloud and Sky on Hongfu Peak. It is a low-grade Foundation Establishment array."

"It can thwart an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Not bad."

Li Zhouwei accepted it with a measure of delight. The Li clan had only recently become an immortal clan, and their only Foundation Establishment arrays were on Lijing Peak and Mount Qingdu. While the Grand Array of Cloud and Sky was inferior to the Cloud-Gathering Southern Sky and the Five Waters Imperial Heaven, it was still the most valuable asset on the entire mountain. If not for the backing of the Capital immortals Dao, Wenhu would never have been able to set up such a thing.

As he examined it, Li Cheng stepped forward and took it. "It's of the Auspicious Qi lineage. This array might offer some assistance in alchemy and artifact refinement."

"Excellent!"

The Li clan members had fought less than a hundred bouts with the Capital immortals Dao cultivators and had the advantage in numbers. None of them were seriously injured, save for Qu Bushi, who had hurt his hand, and An Siwei, who had taken a palm strike. A few months of recuperation would see them healed.

Li Zhouwei immediately instructed the two of them to choose a cave residence on the mountain to recover, then strode into the main hall. Turning to Li Chenghui and the others, he asked, "Elders, how was the situation in the Dense Cloud territory as you fought your way here? Were the local magnates cooperative?"

Li Minggong replied, "We've taken the various peaks. All of Dense Cloud Cave's Foundation Establishment cultivators have retreated. A number of Qi Refining cultivators were captured. The Baijiang Creek area is a mix of cultivators and mortals, so the locals probably don't have a very favorable impression of us. As for the powerful local families, you'll have to ask Weizeng."

At the mention of his name, Ding Weizeng immediately stepped forward and bowed. "Clan Head, the Baijiang Creek area is dominated by four families: Wang, Zhou, Huang, and Ding. A few hundred years ago, they were all noble families of the State of Xu. They have risen and fallen over time, and now only the Wang and Ding families have Foundation Establishment cultivators… My own has already entered the peak. The Huang family is in the territory of Brahma Cloud Cave."

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei's mind was sharp. He immediately asked, "The Wang family's Foundation Establishment cultivator… is that Wenhu's subordinate, Wang He?"

"The very same!"

With Ding Weizeng's confirmation, Li Zhouwei understood how Wang He had become the second-in-command of Dense Cloud Cave. Wenhu must have been trying to win the support of the local powers. "Now that Wang He has thrown his lot in with the Capital immortals Dao and left, has the Wang family of Baijiang made any moves?"

Before anyone could answer, Li Chenghui spoke up. "The common folk haven't moved, but the direct lineage has most likely been sent to White Ye."

This was an inevitable conclusion that needed no proof. Li Zhouwei scanned the list of names that had been submitted and discovered that this place had indeed produced a fair number of Foundation Establishment cultivators. Though most were demonic cultivators, it was a testament to the region's potential.

The territory of Dense Cloud Cave was unlike other places. It was home to millions of mortals, and there had never been a rule separating them from cultivators. The bloodlines of the powerful families were deeply intertwined. Any one of them could be considered a local tyrant with a population of over ten thousand.

These people had their hands in many unclean dealings and had connections to several different powers. After all, the spiritual energy in Jiangbei was now extremely potent. Floating Cloud Cave, on the periphery, was one thing, but Dense Cloud Cave was truly rich in spiritual resources, all of which were exported through these local powers.

For this reason, even the ruthless Dense Cloud Cave had found it troublesome to take over this land, to say nothing of the more rule-bound Li clan. After a quick review, Li Zhouwei announced grimly, "It is not suitable to establish a Prefecture Peak in the Baijiang territory… The conditions here do not allow for it. If we were to hastily set one up, we would face at least a century of unrest. The income wouldn't even cover the stipends, and we'd end up with widespread resentment. It would be best to govern through autonomy."

It had taken the Li clan over a hundred years to solidify their rule over Moongaze Lake. Even now, their true foundation was still the ancestral lands on the southern shore and the dense forests on the eastern shore. The hundred-plus families further east were still only loosely controlled vassals, and the various families on the western shore remained stubbornly attached to their Prefecture Peaks, not to mention the Fei family on the northern shore.

Furthermore, a territory in Jiangbei might be won today and lost a few years later. Li Zhouwei had no intention of wasting his efforts for nothing.

Li Chenghui strongly agreed. "Just one thing," he added. "The Ding family are cultivators from the Floating Cloud territory. That land is now almost completely empty. We must make arrangements for Weizeng's family."

The Ding family was also a powerful clan. As much as Li Zhouwei valued Ding Weizeng, he wouldn't place this local tyrant back in his old territory. Since Floating Cloud was empty, it was better left that way. Li Zhouwei smiled. "Weizeng has worked hard on this journey. However, the situation is volatile, and we may not be able to hold the Floating Cloud territory. It would be best to relocate the Ding family's people to the Prefecture Peaks on the eastern shore. As for your direct relatives, Weizeng, they will be safest on our clan's own island."

This was a plan to move the entire Ding clan to the lakeside. Ding Weizeng's own life had been saved by the Li clan, and his entire clan had been freed from Hongfu Peak. He was in no position to object and could only express his gratitude respectfully.

Li Zhouwei did value him, however, and showed some consideration for his feelings by not splitting the Ding family among different Prefecture Peaks, which would have truly dismantled the clan, leaving only Ding Weizeng's immediate family.

After Ding Weizeng expressed his thanks, Li Zhouwei picked up a brush. "Though we will not establish a Prefecture Peak or appoint officials, that does not mean we will let them run wild. First, we will use the peaks as boundaries and station the Jade Court Guard there. Let them sweat for a few days. Then, we will offer a few positions and invite the direct descendants of their families to cultivate in the dense forests."

Li Cheng acknowledged the order.

Li Zhouwei added casually, "We'll nurture a few of the local magnates' direct heirs. Even if the situation changes in three to five years and our clan has to withdraw from this territory, as long as these heirs become successful, reintegrating this area should we return to Jiangbei one day will be a simple matter of a single command."

Both Li Cheng and Li Minggong nodded in agreement with his words.

"I'm afraid they won't send their true direct heirs, but rather some side branches or children of concubines," Li Minggong pointed out. "On Moongaze Lake… this is a tired old trick played by all the families."

Li Zhouwei laughed. "It's of no consequence. Our clan is inviting their legitimate, direct heirs. We will bring the person they send, parade them through the streets with gongs and drums, and congratulate them for three full circuits. Then we'll spread some rumors about their secret, noble bloodline—everyone loves to hear such tales. They won't dare to deny it. They won't be able to."

"If our clan says they are a direct heir, then they are a direct heir."

He spoke without any attempt to hide his words from Ding Weizeng, who was waiting outside. The warrior broke into a cold sweat as he listened. He quickly excused himself and waited outside the hall. As the details were being discussed inside, an indescribable feeling welled up within him.

'I used to think demonic cultivators were the only ones who acted without scruples. It turns out the righteous path is filled with its own calculations.'

# Chapter 719: Establishing the Baijiang Command

Ding Weizeng stood waiting outside the main hall when Qu Bushi ambled up. Despite a minor injury, the old man was practically glowing with satisfaction, every wrinkle on his face creased into a smile. He hummed a little tune as he approached, first offering congratulations before taking Ding Weizeng’s hand and whispering, “I’ve finished organizing the land deeds for the Floating Cloud territory. I’m about to present them to the family head. Has the Ding Clan made arrangements? Are you returning to your ancestral lands… or have you chosen a new place to settle?”

Ding Weizeng understood the old man’s intentions. Having just surveyed the spirit fields, Qu Bushi would know exactly which plots were fertile and which were barren. This was his way of offering an inside tip. Yet Ding Weizeng remained perfectly composed. “Senior Qu,” he said steadily, “my family will be moving to the lake to continue our cultivation on the isles.”

“Oh! Congratulations are in order, then!” Qu Bushi exclaimed.

Realizing that even a valued general like Ding was being relocated, he understood that the family’s control over the Floating Cloud territory would be strict, leaving no room for maneuvering. He let go of any notion of settling his own people there, gathered his robes, and headed inside, muttering to himself, ‘When did Ding Weizeng become so humble? Back in Floating Cloud Cave, he wouldn’t hesitate to scowl at Fu Dou’s own son. Now he’s as proper as that An Siwei…’

Qu Bushi actually had a decent impression of An Siwei. The young man was a typical cultivator from the mainland, one who had scraped his way past the Foundation Establishment threshold through sheer luck, potent elixirs, and a dense spiritual environment. In the seas, his standing would likely be even lower than Qu Bushi’s.

‘At least he comes from a good family,’ Qu Bushi mused. ‘His father was incompetent but had the good sense to pledge allegiance to the nascent dragon, becoming a loyal vassal for generations. Even Ding Weizeng has to treat him with courtesy.’

His thoughts wandering, Qu Bushi looked up. At the head of the hall, a young man in golden-white armor was writing something with his head lowered. To his left stood another young man of about the same age, clad in silver armor and a black robe, his eyes dark as lacquer, arms crossed. To the right, a resplendent woman in palace attire pondered thoughtfully, her hand shielding a brilliant treasure lamp.

These were three of the four most powerful figures in the Li family. He had heard there was another overseeing matters on the lake, but he had yet to meet them. Qu Bushi clasped his hands respectfully. “I have completed my survey of the Floating Cloud land deeds and have come to report to the family head!”

“Proceed,” Li Zhouwei replied without looking up.

“In the Floating Cloud region,” Qu Bushi began respectfully, “there are a total of two thousand and fifty-one spirit fields. Of these, two hundred and eleven are of the highest grade, five hundred and sixty-one are of middle grade, and one thousand two hundred and seventy-nine are of the lowest grade.”

Moongaze Lake was said to have ten thousand spirit fields, but most were controlled by the various peaks, and the majority were barren plots whose yields barely covered the cost of their upkeep, so they were left fallow. Since every field had a different spiritual density, discussing area was meaningless. Li Zhouwei cut to the chase. “Elder Qu, your Immortal Foundation is the Palace of Concealed Storage, and you are well-versed in agriculture. What is your estimate of the total output?”

“I have calculated each one,” Qu Bushi said deferentially. “The yield should be around ten thousand catties. If we install a full array of formations and properly regulate the water channels, it could exceed twenty thousand.”

“Truly a rich land.”

The Li family’s control was strongest along the southern and eastern shores of Moongaze Lake. The towns below the main peaks, excluding labor costs, contributed all their output to the clan, amounting to a yield of roughly fifty thousand. Pingya Island was primarily for cultivation and could be disregarded. The various families left behind by Daoist Master He on the western shore and the Fei family on the northern shore each contributed over ten thousand, and the hundred families of the eastern shore added another ten thousand. All told, the total output approached one hundred thousand.

This hundred-thousand-catty figure, however, was just for calculation. Now that the Li family no longer paid tribute to the Azure Pond Sect, they didn’t plant spirit grain exclusively. Vast tracts of land were used to cultivate more precious resources for Qi Refinement cultivators, like Pinewood Fruits and Lacquer Ridge Grass. The actual yield from land dedicated to spirit grain was only around thirty thousand.

This meant that Floating Cloud Cave, which constituted half of the Baijiang Creek region, already produced a fifth of Moongaze Lake's total output. It was an astonishing figure.

“No wonder so many sects and families have settled north of the river,” Li Minggong remarked. “Only lands this fertile could support such a dense population.”

Li Zhouwei did a quick mental calculation. ‘Our ten thousand spirit fields yield a hundred thousand catties, which translates to nearly a thousand spirit stones in annual income. But our clan has grown massive. First, the number of cultivators we support is staggering. Second, the stipends for our Foundation Establishment cultivators are extremely generous. And third… we have yet to establish our own market.’

‘Although life in the clan has become comfortable,’ he thought, ‘after deducting costs and salaries, the annual surplus is quite small—only ten to twenty percent of our income… less than a hundred spirit stones.’

A surplus of a hundred spirit stones a year might not sound like much, but it was actually an immense sum. It meant that every month, the clan generated enough wealth to cover the entire life savings of a Qi Refinement cultivator. Every year, they could build a top-tier Qi Refinement formation. In three to five years, they could construct a full Foundation Establishment-level grand array.

The only awkward part was that without their own market, most of their surplus was stored as spirit grain and other resources. These often spoiled from improper storage. The supply of spirit stones in the Jiangnan region was limited; if they tried to convert all their surplus, they would only succeed in driving up the price of spirit stones.

‘Besides, items at the level of treasure panaceas are rarely traded for spirit stones. It’s also nearly impossible to buy all the materials for a Foundation Establishment grand array with spirit stones alone.’

Li Zhouwei hesitated for a moment. While a ten-thousand-catty yield was worth a hundred spirit stones, spirit resources were often harvested annually. It would be a shame to lose these lands before the crops matured.

“For now, have Siwei arrange for spirit grain to be planted. There’s no rush to build top-tier formations, either. It would be a waste if we have to leave in a hurry.”

Qu Bushi nodded and withdrew. Li Zhouwei was now left with the headache of storing this massive amount of spirit grain. He sighed inwardly. Li Minggong, sensing his concern, spoke up. “Now I understand why the Xiao and Yuan families designated large swathes of spirit land and spent a fortune to cultivate just one or two valuable spirit plants. But we’ll only be occupying these places for a short time… so that approach isn’t suitable for us.”

“Indeed,” Li Zhouwei said gravely. “For now, we’ll convert some of the larger spirit fields at home to grow White Origin Fruit. We’ll have to dip into our reserves for the time being…”

Fortunately, this headache was limited to the ruins of the Floating Cloud territory. In the Dense Cloud territory, they simply needed to levy taxes on the established families—a much simpler and faster process. After discussing the matters in detail, Li Zhouwei asked Li Minggong to return and guard their home base, finally concluding the affairs of Baijiang Creek.

At last, he had a moment of peace. He gestured for Li Chenghui, who had been standing by his side, to sit. “Uncle, what are your thoughts on the cultivators from White Ye?”

Li Cheng paused, his brow furrowed. “They won’t be easy to deal with. I’ve already made inquiries. The one in the colorful robes is a direct descendant of the White Ye sect named Guan Lingdie. Her Immortal Foundation is the same as the Lingu family’s, Sorrowful Southern Water.”

“As for the saber-wielder, Gongsun Bofan, he was originally a rogue cultivator from north of the river. He cultivates the Pit Water, the Way of the Jing Dragon King, and has since joined the White Ye Immortal Sect. His saber techniques are formidable. The last one, the young lady from the Song family, is the daughter of a prominent northern clan.”

This intelligence matched Li Zhouwei’s own assessment. He thought for a moment. “Guan Lingdie’s words were sharp, but her combat experience is not to be underestimated. Gongsun Bofan’s Dao lineage is profound, not at all like a common rogue cultivator. As for Song Yunbai, her presence suggests that the White Ye Immortal Sect’s control over its territories isn’t particularly strict.”

Guan Lingdie was, after all, a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion clan. She had managed to hold off both Li Chenghui and An Siwei, even managing to injure the latter on her own. Her strength was not to be taken lightly. Li Zhouwei committed their names to memory. “And as for the Profound Peak Gate… they truly have no one. It’s a sign of their decline.”

He had a point. Kong Guxi, the esteemed sect master of the Profound Peak Gate, had been locked in an even fight with the daughter of a minor northern clan. If not for the Profound Peak’s numerical advantage and the White Ye’s early retreat, the casualties might have been far worse.

This situation was a direct result of Daoist Master Changxi’s repeated demands for his descendants to strive for the Purple Mansion realm. When the opportunity of the Upper Evil Spirit Storage arose, Changxi had been overjoyed, and several of his core descendants had entered seclusion, leading to the current state of affairs.

It was for this very reason that Kong Tingyun later ascended to the position of Sect Master, gradually earning Changxi’s favor and bringing the Profound Peak Gate and the Li family closer. It was, Li Zhouwei mused, a true testament to the workings of fate.

“The Profound Peak Gate still has Fuyuezi on Yuezhou Island,” Li Chenghui offered as a comfort. “His strength is considerable. He can contribute when the time comes.”

Li Zhouwei remained silent. After a moment, Chen Yang came up from below to report that the various families of the Dense Cloud territory had sent their representatives. The initial arrangements were settled, and the territory was, at least for now, under their control.

“With Dense Cloud secured… it is time we returned to the mountain. I must see the Daoist Master.” Li Zhouwei put down his brush.

“There’s still the Northern Brocade River King waiting in Baijiang Creek,” Li Cheng reminded him.

“Of course…” Li Zhouwei, who had been pondering who to station as a guard in the Dense Cloud territory, nodded. “I intend to establish a command post for the Baijiang Creek region to govern Floating Cloud and guard Dense Cloud. An Siwei is capable enough to manage the administration of Floating Cloud, but he lacks the strength to defend it. I’m afraid I must ask you, Uncle, to assume this post and oversee things here.”

Li Chenghui had fought alongside Li Zhouwei through more than a decade of peril; they knew each other too well for pleasantries. He simply nodded. “I will do my best to protect this place.”

Li Zhouwei considered for a breath before continuing. “Since the Secret Diffusion Sects have been broken and Hongfu Mountain has been conquered, it is time for a new order in the Floating Cloud and Dense Cloud territories. With Manghuazi Mountain as the border, the southern part of Floating Cloud will be renamed Funan, and Dense Cloud will be renamed Midong. We will establish the Baijiang Command, headquartered on Hongfu Mountain. The official positions and decrees… the clan will send them shortly.”

He let out a small laugh. “If we can hold these two territories and Funan begins to generate an income, the salaries for the command post can be drawn directly from the rear. It will be far more convenient.”

It was still a form of puppet rule, but Li Zhouwei was determined to secure the legitimacy of their claim. He wouldn’t call it a Gate or a Cave, but a Command, an entity that could be dissolved at any time. They had already burned their bridges with the White Ye Immortal Sect, and no one in the Midong territory expected the Li family to last long anyway. They were all just living day by day, so there was no need to worry about winning their loyalty.

“As for the Northern Brocade River King…” Li Zhouwei had already thought this through. “He knows a great deal. In his eyes, I am a figure on par with Dragon Prince Dingjiao. It would be utterly inappropriate for me to visit his estate. My presence would only make him suspicious and cause him to overthink things. But we cannot let such a valuable asset go to waste. You should go in my stead. He will not dare to be disrespectful.”

Li Chenghui nodded.

“He’s not some esteemed guest of the Dragon Palace as the rumors claim; he’s a minor figure there,” Li Zhouwei continued. “You only need to be clear on one point: the dragons are not to get involved in our affairs. He can gather information and help with the waterways, which is useful enough.”

“Qu Bushi, Ding Weizeng, and Miaoshui will all remain here with you. You cannot manage this all on your own. If you need anything, do not hesitate to ask the family. Aunt Minggong is just across the river on the northern shore, a short trip from Funan, and can provide timely support. As for Wenhu…”

A smile touched Li Zhouwei’s lips. “I will take him to Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Let the other families see… that our Daoist Master is not so easily trifled with.”

Wenhu, despite his cunning, had been incredibly unlucky. In addition to the man, Li Zhouwei planned to take the flower python back as well. He had been at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment for years; using a talisman ritual to break through to the late stage now would not seem abrupt.

However, with the Li family’s recent ascension to a Purple Mansion clan, they were no longer a minor family under the thumb of the Azure Pond Sect. Any major event was likely to attract the attention of other Purple Mansion cultivators, making the ritual a tricky affair.

Rituals conducted at the foot of their mountain could be disguised as local Moongaze Lake customs, but a ritual on the mountain itself would involve secrets from the _Sacrificial Rites Manual_. If another Purple Mansion expert saw through their methods, it would be disastrous.

They should have consulted the Immortal Mirror, but ever since it had vanished into the Great Void, they hadn't been able to see its physical form even when invoking its power. They didn’t know what phenomena consulting it might produce. With the Li family in the spotlight, Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei dared not be careless and had postponed the matter.

‘It would be best to wait until a Purple Mansion-level array that can isolate the Great Void is established before performing the ritual,’ Li Zhouwei thought. ‘But even if we can’t perform the ritual right away, we can still bring the flower python back first…’

As his thoughts drifted, Li Chenghui walked with him to the riverbank. Li Zhouwei came back to himself with a sigh. “This will be difficult for you, Uncle. But remember, everything else is secondary. Your own safety is what matters most. We can afford to lose this land. If something were to happen to you, it would be a blow to the very foundation of our family.”

The Baijiang Command might look like the domain of a regional tyrant, but it was anything but a comfortable post. Daoist Master Changxi could pass away at any moment in the next few years. If the situation changed, the Baijiang territory would be the first to fall. When the cultivators of White Ye swarmed over, a moment’s hesitation could mean being completely surrounded.

Li Cheng knew this well. He steadied himself and replied, “I command the thunder. In our family, no one surpasses my escape arts. With Profound Thunder in the Thunder Pool and the protection of the grand array, if I am determined to flee, no Foundation Establishment cultivator can stop me.”

Li Chenghui saw the group off, then summoned a bolt of lightning and flew back, his mind already racing. He was a man of his own ideas. ‘I should make some preparations,’ he thought. ‘Since I can use the Dragon Prince’s reputation to my advantage, and Ying Hebai is the master of three rivers… think of how many water spirits he commands. Won’t they be like a network of eyes spreading through every waterway? If I make an agreement with him, a flare of light over the White Ye Immortal Sect’s domain could be reported by a demon here in an instant!’

Although a demon’s flying speed couldn’t compare to that of a Foundation Establishment expert, a warning could be sent with the simple crushing of a jade talisman.

With a plan in place, Li Chenghui felt more confident. He summoned Ding Weizeng and the others. After looking them over, he said, “Weizeng, come with me to the river.”

Ding Weizeng acknowledged the order. Below them, the dark, overgrown slopes of Manghuazi Mountain stretched out. The mountain’s grand array had long been dismantled, and the demons had scattered, leaving it empty. The two landed by the river, where they saw the figure of an old man in black robes materialize. He had clearly been waiting for them and hurried over, bowing deeply.

“Shui Zhao greets you, my lord.”

Li Chenghui nodded and announced, “Are you here at the invitation of the Northern Brocade River King?”

“Indeed!” The old demon Shui Zhao beamed, then squatted down and transformed. In his place was a black turtle the size of a house, its four limbs marked with brownish-yellow patterns, clearly a unique breed. Its neck was remarkably long, and its voice was a low hum like a great bronze bell.

“I have been awaiting your esteemed arrival for some time!”

# Chapter 720: The Story of the Secret Diffusion Sects

The waters of Baijiang Creek were exceptionally clear, its bed a dense carpet of green stones. The underwater palace was grand, filled with shrimp and fish that had taken human form. Some played celestial music while others carried spirit delicacies, weaving through the halls in a lively spectacle.

Ying Hebai might be a nobody in the eyes of someone like Dingjiao, but the Azure-Necked Flood Dragon was a local hegemon in his own right. His palace lacked nothing in luxury and elegance. It was adorned with luminous pearls and featured stairs of gold—a dazzling and extravagant display.

‘He is, after all, a demon just a step below the Purple Mansion realm,’ Li Chenghui thought, assessing the situation. ‘He has borrowed the prestige of the dragons to become master of three rivers. Of course his domain would be impressive.’

Li Chenghui knew that Ying Hebai might seem deferential, but without Li Zhouwei’s reputation backing him, he himself might not have even been granted entry. He shed any pretense of arrogance, rode the giant turtle to the riverbed, and followed Shui Zhao, who had resumed his human form before the palace.

“This way, please!” Shui Zhao said with a bow.

Li Chenghui stepped forward. A tall man was waiting inside the main hall, dressed in a brocade jacket of slate-blue silk beneath a white velvet cloak embroidered with a scene of an azure sea. Scales were visible on his neck, and his eyes were sharp and piercing. He was a handsome figure. Seeing Li Chenghui, he smiled. “So it is fellow Daoist Chenghui. But why do I not see the lord?”

“Our family head is currently occupied.”

With that simple reply, Ying Hebai understood everything. He didn't need to be overly deferential to Li Chenghui. Taking a half-step back to reveal his turquoise and white boots, he announced, “Please.”

As Li Chenghui took his seat, Ying Hebai immediately cupped his hands. “First, allow me to congratulate you, fellow Daoist, on conquering the Baijiang Creek territory. This is a land of abundant spiritual energy, and it falls within my jurisdiction. The waterways are clear and well-connected, ensuring a good harvest every year. If you ever need to divert a remote water channel, you have only to ask!”

“You are too kind, Great King.” Li Chenghui, of course, had no concerns about the waterways. He began, “The Baijiang Creek region has no high mountains, and there are no noteworthy demons on the land. However, the extensive network of waterways makes it very convenient for water spirits to come ashore and prey on humans…”

“I understand.”

Li Chenghui, mindful that Ying Hebai was a demon, had spoken plainly. The Northern Brocade River King nodded at once and agreed readily. “I will restrain all the water spirits of the three rivers from preying on humans. I will send messengers to warn the demon generals in the outlying waters. If any demon dares to come ashore and harm people, simply send word, and I will investigate thoroughly.”

It had to be said, having a powerful backer made all the difference. A grave matter that the Secret Diffusion Three Sects had been powerless against—even having to offer up blood sacrifices to the flower python year after year—Li Chenghui had resolved with a single sentence.

With such a thorny issue settled so easily, Li Chenghui was in high spirits. Seizing the opportunity, he asked, “Great King, do you know of any special places or secret histories in the lands of Baijiang and Baiye? For the Secret Diffusion Three Sects to choose this location to establish themselves… it seems rather unusual, does it not?”

The very founding of the Secret Diffusion sects felt strange, so Li Chenghui naturally took the chance to inquire. Hearing this, Ying Hebai’s expression turned serious. “The lands of Baijiang hold their own mysteries. Allow me to explain it to you, fellow Daoist.”

“First, you should know that my aunt is a favored concubine of the Xu Water Demon King, and my elder brother also serves under him. It was through this connection, and by making myself known to Lord Ranwu of the Dragon Prince’s court, that I was granted this post overseeing the three rivers.”

After laying out his own background, he continued, “When the three caves established their sects here, I grew suspicious. I made a special trip to the Xu Water and asked the Demon King about it. Only then did I learn that the root of the matter lies with the Xiaoshi Mountain Dao Lineage.”

“The Xiaoshi Mountain Dao Lineage?” The name sounded familiar to Li Chenghui. He vaguely recalled his family having captured someone from that lineage before.

“Precisely,” the River King affirmed. “Near Chengshui Marsh, there is a mountain called Xiaoshi. On that mountain was a declining Daoist lineage that ran the Secret Diffusion Temple. During the height of the Xu Kingdom, the Secret Diffusion Temple was a celestial temple with its own Purple Mansion cultivator. It was one of the most prominent temples to emerge from the ruins of the Wanling Sect’s domain.”

Only now was Li Chenghui beginning to understand the origins of the Secret Diffusion Three Sects. He watched as Ying Hebai’s expression grew solemn.

“It was said this celestial temple had powerful connections. Later, its Purple Mansion expert perished, and the succeeding generations were inept. Yet no sect or clan ever dared to make a move on them. Instead, they were instigated by various powers until they fractured and turned on one another, each clinging to a piece of that mountain to survive.”

“This continued until the war between the north and south. The monks swept down from the north and finally disturbed this place. How could the various caves of Secret Diffusion resist? They were shattered and scattered, fleeing for their lives across the land.”

He stroked his beard. “I overheard my lord chatting once. He said the Secret Diffusion Temple has a treasure, an ancient spirit artifact… it lies hidden in the Great Void. If a descendant of the Secret Diffusion Temple can gain its recognition, it will descend from the Great Void… Several Purple Mansion cultivators covet it.”

With that, Li Chenghui finally understood the fundamental reason for the Secret Diffusion Three Sects’ existence. They were essentially seeds planted by the surrounding Purple Mansion powers, who would select talented individuals from among them to cultivate, all for the sake of that spirit artifact.

The schemes of Purple Mansion cultivators were often hard to fathom. While the demon king’s words couldn’t be trusted completely, the origin of the Secret Diffusion Temple was almost certainly true. Li Chenghui committed this to memory. “I see…”

But then a thought struck him, and he realized his family had grievously offended Yehui. ‘I wonder which Daoist Masters are involved…’ he pondered. ‘But then there’s the Brahma Cloud Cave, which means the master of the Chengyun Gate has a hand in this as well. This matter is of great importance. I must report it to the Daoist Master!’

Li Chenghui no longer had the heart for idle chat. After asking a few more details, he cut straight to the point. “The people of Dense Cloud Cave have retreated, but who knows when they will return. Great King, you guard the three rivers. If you hear any news, I ask that you inform me… My family will reward you generously!”

Anyone would know that Dense Cloud Cave was just another name for the White Ye Immortal Sect. But since the sect was a legitimate Purple Mansion power, mentioning it directly would put the other party in a difficult position. By substituting its name, he made things easier. Ying Hebai smiled. “But of course! They are merely a few Foundation Establishment remnants. I will have my people watch them. If there is any news, I will immediately dispatch Shui Zhao to inform you.”

Ying Hebai was no fool; how could he not understand Li Chenghui’s meaning? He was under strict orders from his own superiors not to interfere in human affairs, especially those involving Purple Mansion clans. He couldn’t openly take a side. But rules were rules, and some things were best left unsaid between them. By referring to them as Dense Cloud Cave, Li Chenghui had made it even more convenient. The flood dragon agreed enthusiastically and personally saw him out.

“I will have Shui Zhao visit a few times in the coming months to maintain contact. That way, it will be easier to notify you, fellow Daoist. It would be troublesome if something happened and we were unable to communicate in time.”

Li Chenghui knew this was likely a prelude to gift-giving. He would decide whether to accept based on the value of the gifts when they arrived. He summoned a bolt of lightning, shot out of Baijiang Creek, and hurried to write a letter to his family.

Ying Hebai returned to his hall, the smile vanishing from his face. He frowned. “Shui Zhao… during the war between the north and south, wasn’t there a thunder pearl that fell to the bottom of the river? A pity, it’s probably too valuable, he most likely wouldn’t accept it… Go check the treasury for any other thunder-attribute treasures.”

Shui Zhao acknowledged the order and departed. A sense of calm settled over Ying Hebai. “This one is easy to get along with. The phenomena of falling water and rising thunder in the Eastern Sea might be ending soon. I should take the opportunity to prepare a few more thunder-related gifts…”

**Gardenia Scenery Mountain.**

Li Zhouwei returned to the clan on a ray of Profound Light. He dismissed his retinue, tossed the flower python to the White Ape for safekeeping, and without a moment’s pause, grabbed Wenhu and rushed to see Li Ximing.

When he reached the foot of the mountain, a messenger informed him that Li Ximing was on the summit. He breathed a sigh of relief, dragged his captive up the mountain, and threw Wenhu onto the Radiant Sky Stone.

“This villain offended the Daoist Master with deceitful words!” he announced respectfully. “We have now broken through Hongfu Mountain and captured him!”

Li Ximing had been waiting for him on the mountain. He rose with a cheerful laugh. Although this had all been planned in advance, and he had already intercepted the other Purple Mansion experts in the Great Void, the extent of their gains still depended on Li Zhouwei’s strength.

“Excellent, excellent,” he said with a smile. “Have him taken away for now. You and I will talk. We can interrogate him later.”

Li Ximing had little desire to control the family’s every move and was thus extremely pleased with Li Zhouwei. A Purple Mansion’s divine abilities were formidable, but a top-tier Foundation Establishment cultivator was just as invaluable. Otherwise, why would Ning Tiaoxiao have gone to such lengths to promote Li Xuanfeng? If the Li family didn’t have Li Zhouwei now, how could they have advanced into the Midong territory? With only Li Chenghui and Li Minggong’s strength, they would have been lucky to hold the Funan territory on the opposite shore.

He helped his white qilin to its feet and recounted everything regarding Daoist Master Changxi. Li Zhouwei listened and considered it carefully.

“I suspect Yehui has other motives,” Li Ximing said. “Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been the first to jump out and oppose our family. That’s the first thing. The second is… while Changxi is still alive and can offer some protection, I want to make a trip to the Cui family and inquire about Daoist lineages.”

“The affairs of Purple Mansion cultivators are not so difficult to unravel,” Li Zhouwei replied. “Especially since neither the Chengyun Gate nor the Capital immortals Dao behind the Secret Diffusion sects possess a Life Divine Ability. As long as our information is good, we can guess at their motives. Changxi might not be ignorant of this; it’s more likely a matter of interests. If we don’t ask, he won’t tell. At worst, we can try to befriend that cultivator Sumian.”

His assessment was nearly identical to Li Ximing’s own. “Changxi is a clan cultivator who attained the Dao in the Eastern Sea,” Li Ximing responded. “He was never a particularly good person. Even at death’s door, he’s still scheming. If I were in his shoes, I might not fully trust our family either. After all, from his perspective, if the Profound Peak Gate falls, our family stands to gain the most.”

Li Ximing had a point. If the Profound Peak Gate were to collapse, its talents, resources, and Daoist lineages would inevitably flow to Moongaze Lake.

“As for the Cui family…” Li Zhouwei continued, “they are backed by Dongfang You’s faction, who are also supporters of Dingjiao. If you’re just asking for information, they shouldn’t refuse you, Daoist Master. I am certain the trip will be fruitful.”

“Good!” This was precisely what Li Ximing wanted to confirm. Hearing the connection to Dingjiao, he was ninety percent certain of his success. They chatted a bit more about the Baijiang territory, and when he heard the name “Baijiang Command,” he couldn’t help but laugh. “How domineering. It certainly has the autocratic flavor of the Bright Yang Dao.”

Li Zhouwei smiled without embarrassment. After another moment of lighthearted banter, Li Ximing’s expression grew worried. “Do you still have connections among the dragon clans? Don’t forget to inquire about our elder…”

Li Zhouwei knew he was referring to Li Qinghong. He sighed inwardly. It was a sensitive matter, not something one could ask about easily. He simply nodded in silent agreement.

Li Ximing seemed to sense his thoughts. A colorful light, the sign of a Bright Yang divine ability, pulsed from his sleeve as he tore open a path to the Great Void, leaving a final message. “I am leaving the Profound Pattern Vase to nurture in the Purple Flame Earth-Baleful Spring on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. If you have need of it, you may take it.”

The Profound Pattern Vase could absorb the power of fire channels, refining the Profound Light within it with the energies of Li Fire and Bright Yang to increase its power. Li Ximing had left it on the mountain ever since his breakthrough.

With that final reminder, he stepped into the Great Void. He traveled for some time, his heart filled with joyful anticipation for his trip to the Cui family. After a short while, the Purple Mansion grand array of the Profound Peak Gate materialized before him. A stream of black and yellow energy sank to its base, while an aura of deep blue light floated above. It looked even more formidable than the array at Mount Xianyou.

‘Every art has its specialty,’ he mused. ‘The Bound Earth dao excels at defense. A sect’s grand array would naturally be more robust.’

As he approached, an entrance naturally appeared in the array, and Changxi’s voice echoed out. “Daoist Friend Zhaojing, please enter.”

He passed through the array, and the world before him opened up. In the distance, he could see the brilliant white expanse of Lake Xian, with a few wisps of cloud drifting past. Li Ximing turned back to see the cave’s interior, its floor covered in rolling green stones.

Seated upon the central dharma seat was a stone man with a distinct nose and face. Its beard and eyebrows were like jade, standing out stiffly from its cheeks. Its eyes were textured stone, a solid, unnerving black that stared blankly ahead. It was a rather frightening sight.

Li Ximing paused. A muffled rumbling came from within the stone man’s belly. “Zhaojing, wait a moment.”

The stone man rose with great difficulty, scooped up a handful of sand from the floor, and pressed it onto its face, sculpting a new visage and neck. It covered the rest of its body with robes and sat down at a table, forcing a smile. But its eyes remained black stone, cold and devoid of emotion.

“A disgraceful sight…” Changxi laughed. The two stone orbs slowly grew flesh, returning to their usual kind and amiable appearance.

Li Ximing let out a breath. “Senior, how is your health?”

“Less than three years.” Changxi shook his head, his condition truly dire. “You must have come for a reason, Zhaojing,” he said wearily. “Please, speak.”

Li Ximing felt as though Changxi might drop dead at any second. Not daring to delay, he quickly asked, “There will be a great war in a few years. This junior wishes to refine a spirit embryo… It’s not a matter for just the next few years; refining it sooner would grant me a bit more strength.”

“Ah!” Changxi feigned a look of sudden understanding.

‘He’s asking me for the technique to refine a spirit embryo!’

At this point, what excuse could Changxi possibly have? To put it bluntly, if he were to die tomorrow, what secret technique of the Profound Peak Gate couldn't Li Ximing take if he so wished? What spirit resource would the Li family not dare to touch?

Besides, Changxi had never put much faith in sentiment. The Kong family had once been the region’s hegemon, yet when their clan was scattered, no one offered aid to their descendants out of some past friendship. The Li family was willing to help; it was only right that Li Ximing receive a share of the Profound Peak Gate’s legacy.

The old man coughed, suppressing his thoughts and forcing a smile onto his aged face. “It is my fault. I told you about it before and should have given it to you to study then. To make you come all this way to ask… my apologies.”

He took a jade slip from his sleeve. “This is called _Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire_,” he said with a cough. “I obtained it in my early years from the Eastern Sea. It is a clean technique. It is the same one I use for my own refinement. You can rest assured, Zhaojing.”

“Many thanks, Senior!”

Li Ximing accepted the slip. His spiritual sense swept over it. The jade was of exceptionally high quality, seemingly reinforced with an Earth Virtue divine ability, making it as heavy and sturdy as a Foundation Establishment artifact. The small slip contained millions of words and numerous diagrams, clearly the product of a complete and orthodox Daoist lineage.

# Chapter 721: The Cui Clan of Chongzhou

Li Ximing studied the old man’s weary expression as he calmly accepted the item. He offered a few words of comfort, then casually asked, "Senior, have you found a home for your Bound Earth spiritual artifact, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger? If not, you could always give it to the venerable Daoist Master Sumian, or even Daoist Master Xuanyi."

Changxi sighed wistfully. It was clear this was a plan long in the making, and one that had yet to bear fruit. "I have other gifts for Sumian," he replied. "As for Xuanyi, I have made arrangements for her as well. These days, those who would dare accept it won't help, and those who would help won't accept it. It remains in my hands. When my time is up, I'll have it sent to Zhaojing."

Hearing this, Li Ximing knew that the chances of trading the spiritual artifact for the support of a Purple Mansion cultivator were all but gone. In the end, it would be sent to his own clan to ease Changxi's conscience. "Take care of yourself, senior," he said. "The Profound Peak Gate's domain is vast. It would be best to recall the island's garrison leader from Yuezhou."

Changxi knew his clan was short on people; Fuyue-zi was the only one left to manage things. "I've already sent him out," he said, his voice raspy with age. "He is to give Yuezhou to Mount Jingyi. Once it is done, he will return. Zhaojing need not worry."

Li Ximing sighed inwardly for the old man but said no more. He nodded and took his leave, traveling from the Profound Peak Gate through the Great Void until he emerged into the Eastern Sea. The light of Converging Water shimmered everywhere he looked.

He journeyed through the Great Void, and whenever he encountered one of its towering peaks, he knew it would harbor spiritual items or waters. He would break through the boundary, casually collect them, and move on. Along the way, he gathered six spiritual items suitable for Qi Refining cultivators and one spiritual water—a Baleful Earth Coldspring.

The spring was guarded by a hook serpent, which likely used it for its own cultivation. When Li Ximing appeared, the demonic beast was so terrified it froze, not daring to make a sound. Given that they were in the territory of a dragon-kin, Li Ximing spared its life, took the spiritual spring, and departed.

In less than a night, by his reckoning, he had reached the Great Void above Chongzhou Island. He saw the illusory radiance of Bright Yang rippling through the void, forming a milky-white barrier of light that enveloped the island below in a brilliant glow. Li Ximing was slightly surprised.

'A starved camel is still bigger than a horse... The Cui clan of Chongzhou has a Purple Mansion formation... Impressive, truly impressive!'

With his hands clasped behind his back, he tore through the Great Void and came to a stop at the island's edge, standing upon a shaft of celestial light. Immediately, vibrant clouds gathered, interwoven with threads of purple and gold, and the sky turned bright and clear. Li Ximing released his spiritual sense, sweeping it across the island, and located a cultivator who looked to be from the main family line. He took a step forward.

The next moment, his figure materialized behind the patrolling cultivator. An intense celestial light immediately burst forth, casting a stark white glare upon the surroundings.

The man spun around instantly, his pupils dilating. He was frozen for a moment, then immediately dropped to his knees, trembling from head to toe. His face drained of color in terror, his eyelids twitched uncontrollably, and he stammered in a hoarse voice, "Chongzhou... Cui... Xinzhan, pays his respects to the Daoist Master!"

It was no wonder Cui Xinzhan was in such a state. He was merely a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator; to him, even a Foundation Establishment cultivator was a formidable figure. For a Purple Mansion master to suddenly tear through the Great Void before him—the fact that he could speak at all was a testament to his courage.

Li Ximing hadn't meant to frighten him so badly. "Go inform your elders," he said casually, "that Daoist Master Zhaojing of Moongaze Lake has arrived."

"Yes, sir!" Cui Xinzhan scrambled to his feet, drenched in sweat and so drained he nearly collapsed. He rushed toward the formation, and as he called out at the entrance, a streak of light descended before him, materializing into a woman holding a golden hoop.

She bowed her head respectfully and said, "Cui Wanqing of Chongzhou greets the Daoist Master! A senior from Moongaze Lake visited us in years past. To now be graced by your celestial presence is the greatest honor for all of Chongzhou!"

His own aunt had indeed visited Chongzhou Island, a fact Li Ximing was well aware of. He gave a slight nod. "I've come this time to honor the friendship between our families. There's no need for such ceremony."

When Cui Wanqing heard he was a Daoist Master from Moongaze Lake and saw that he cultivated the Bright Yang Dao, she knew his surname must be Li. Feeling a sense of kinship, she had come out to greet him personally. "This way, Daoist Master, please..." she said with a gentle smile.

She led Li Ximing into the formation. However, this was merely the outer Foundation Establishment array of the island. The Cui clan had fallen on hard times, and though they possessed a Purple Mansion formation, it was only large enough to cover the core mountain at the very center. The rest of the island was protected by arrays suitable for Foundation Establishment or Qi Refining cultivators. And though the Cui and Li families were close, there was no reason to invite a potential threat directly into their home right away.

Li Ximing looked down and saw bustling crowds of mortals below. They showed little fear, most simply lowering their heads and moving aside. The population was remarkably dense. "Chongzhou governs its people well," he praised.

Cui Wanqing smiled, a hint of pride in her expression. "As the Daoist Master knows, the Bright Yang Dao is a path of worldly engagement. Many of our clan's cultivation arts and secret techniques focus on governance, with personal cultivation as a secondary benefit. That is why our numbers are so large. The number of cultivators and clan members who migrate elsewhere each year is quite substantial!"

"Most of the Cui cultivators and families in the Eastern and Southern Seas can trace their lineage back to Chongzhou. Every ten years, Cui clan members from all over the world return to the island. It is truly a grand event."

With this explanation, Cui Wanqing made Chongzhou's standing clear. With the White Dragon's line backing them, no one dared to trouble them, and it was considered a good thing for distant relatives bearing the Cui name to return and pay their respects.

Just as they set foot on the steps leading to the main hall, a middle-aged man hurried out to meet them. He had a stern expression, with a long mustache that drooped at the sides. He approached, turned sideways, and bowed with utmost respect.

"Junior Cui Xianye greets the Daoist Master!"

Though older, Cui Xianye was far less at ease than Cui Wanqing. The man, who appeared to be of a similar age to Li Ximing, was extremely reserved. He kept his head pressed to the ground, not daring to rise. "My father is currently in seclusion and cannot personally welcome you. As the acting head of the island, I, Xianye, offer you a welcome on behalf of the Cui clan."

"Rise."

Li Ximing smiled and entered the hall. Cui Xianye led him to a seat and personally served him tea. "Some years ago, the Li family of Moongaze Lake corresponded with our Cui clan of Chongzhou," he said respectfully. "However, the letter came from a senior who cultivated the path of thunder. My elders were unsure of its authenticity and did not dare to place their full trust in it. But now, seeing you, Daoist Master, we know you are of the true Bright Yang lineage."

Li Ximing chose not to dwell on the past. The Li family had indeed been obscure and struggling back then. Their situation was slightly better now, but they had only just begun to make a name for themselves. The fact that the Cui clan had provided them with any information at all, even without handing over the full lineage, was generous enough. He nodded. "Indeed. Travel was inconvenient then, so contact was sparse. We can communicate more frequently from now on."

His intention to let bygones be bygones was clear, and a wave of relief washed over Cui Xianye. "Thank you for your understanding, Daoist Master," he said, bowing.

Li Ximing cut to the chase. "How many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators does the Cui clan have at present?"

Cui Xianye answered quickly. "Daoist Master, our island was once home to Daoist Master Mingzan, my great-grandfather. He passed away over a century ago. Several elders of his generation suffered from spiritual energy backlash while in seclusion and showed signs of passing away in recent years. My father also entered seclusion some time ago, so there are currently no Purple Mansion Realm cultivators on the island."

"However," he continued, "a descendant from my great-grandfather's ninth branch, who migrated away long ago, has achieved the Purple Mansion realm. His Daoist name is Yangya. He resides in the Western Sea, in the far west, and has established his own foundation there. He rarely returns, only visiting when a major event occurs."

Li Ximing frowned. The Cui clan's bloodline was strong, and they possessed numerous cultivation arts that led to the Purple Mansion realm. With no external threats and judging by the spiritual energy on Chongzhou—which should have produced more than one Bright Yang Purple Mansion cultivator—it was an excellent, resource-rich land. It was unthinkable that they couldn't produce a single Purple Mansion cultivator.

He had come hoping to find allies, and a seed of disappointment took root. "The Cui clan has cultivated this land for a thousand years. Surely your strength should be greater than this."

Cui Xianye hesitated before speaking. "Daoist Master, it is not just my great-grandfather. His younger brother was also a Purple Mansion cultivator, but he died in service to Li Xunquan when his kingdom fell. My great-great-grandfather was also at the Purple Mansion realm; he and two of our most talented elders fell while following Li Xuan. During the era of the Dongli Sect, Chongzhou was its vassal territory, and all our clansmen were conscripted. Every last one of them perished. As for how many Foundation Establishment cultivators and Purple Mansion masters were among them... no one knows."

He refilled Li Ximing's cup. "This junior means no offense," he added. "I am merely answering your question. I beg your forgiveness."

His words left Li Ximing speechless. Though everyone claimed that the Moongaze Lake Lis were descendants of the Wei-Li, it was not something he dared to openly admit. He could only sigh. "The Cui clan's loyalty and sacrifice are truly moving."

After Cui Xianye's explanation, Li Ximing's tone softened considerably. "My Li clan began as a small lakeside family with an incomplete Dao lineage," he said gently. "I have come this time for two reasons. First, to honor the friendship between our families. Second, to inquire about your lineages, in the hopes of completing my own. I will, of course, offer fair compensation."

Cui Xianye had clearly anticipated his purpose; after all, Li Qinghong had inquired about their Bright Yang lineage once before. "Rest assured, Daoist Master," he said. "Our family has preserved the Bright Yang lineages. May I ask which Dao you cultivate?"

Li Ximing saw no reason to hide it. He tapped his teacup. "Audience with the Celestial Gate."

"Ah, a Divine Ability of the Celestial Gate Arts."

His term, "Celestial Gate Arts," clearly referred to the entire system of high and low-grade cultivation methods related to Audience with the Celestial Gate, including the Radiant Origin Pass. Cui Xianye watched his expression and explained, "The orthodox Bright Yang path has three spells, one body, and one Life Divine Ability. The spell art Divine Abilities are 'Audience with the Celestial Gate,' 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead,' and 'Imperial Observation of the Origin.' The Body Divine Ability is 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread,' and the Life Divine Ability is 'Luminous Heart.'"

Li Ximing only knew that 'Imperial Observation of the Origin' was his clan's 'Eternal Brightness Steps,' and he had heard of the 'Luminous Heart' in the Eastern Sea. The others were new to him. After a moment to process, he asked, "Do they have other names?"

As he expected, Cui Xianye replied, "Indeed, Daoist Master. 'Imperial Observation of the Origin' has always been passed down exclusively within the imperial palace. The version available to outsiders is called 'Eternal Brightness Steps.' 'Luminous Heart' was also known in ancient times as 'World's Radiance.' Only these two are widely circulated. As for the myriad lower-tier Dao foundations, there are far too many to list. I will present you with a catalog later."

Li Ximing was delighted and nodded. Cui Xianye continued respectfully, "The Divine Abilities for 'Imperial Observation of the Origin' and 'Luminous Heart' can only be bestowed by the imperial family itself. We do not have them here in Chongzhou. We only possess 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' and 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread.'"

'The Body Divine Ability, Sovereign's Perilous Tread!'

A wave of elation washed over Li Ximing. It was almost too hot to contain. Besides the 'Luminous Heart,' this Body Divine Ability was the second thing he had hoped to obtain on this trip!

Ever since his Foundation Establishment days, he had heard of the power of such foundations—from the Yu family's 'Jade Court General' to Ning Tiaoxiao's famous 'Spring Echo.' Even Daoist Master Sumian had praised Ding Weizeng's 'Palace-Yang Tiger.' After hearing Changxi speak so often of the advantages of a Body Divine Ability, his heart had long been moved!

At this moment, he felt nothing but gratitude for his Bright Yang lineage and the legacy left by his predecessors, which had spared him the struggles faced by men like Changxi. He nodded and smiled. "I wish to study them. What is your price?"

Li Ximing knew that Purple Mansion cultivation arts were priceless. Back at Hengzhu, the minimum exchange for a Purple Mansion spiritual item was a Purple Mansion art or a spiritual artifact. The Cui clan of Chongzhou was not a family to be trifled with, especially given their deep historical ties to his own.

He saw Cui Xianye hesitate for a breath. Since Chongzhou had no urgent needs, he pondered, "Daoist Master... do you have a Bright Yang Purple Mansion spiritual item?"

Li Ximing had expected this question. It reminded him of his own clan's past struggles. "I would like one myself," he said with a hint of wistfulness. "Unfortunately, the only one my clan fought tooth and nail to acquire has already been used."

Cui Xianye asked again, "Then... does the Daoist Master have a Bright Yang Purple Mansion spiritual artifact?"

He paused, then added, "We would not dare ask for a spirit treasure, only a spiritual artifact. And we cannot accept an embryonic one, as we have no Purple Mansion cultivator with the divine ability to refine it."

Li Ximing sipped his tea. "I have a spiritual artifact, but it is not of the Bright Yang Dao."

"This..."

Now it was Cui Xianye's turn to be hesitant. Seeing his difficulty, Li Ximing asked, "What is the nature of your clan's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' lineage?"

Although he lacked a suitable spiritual artifact, he possessed a Bright Yang Purple Mansion cultivation art. A one-for-one exchange would not be unfair. In response to his question, Cui Xianye answered, "It is the _Upper Mansion Audience Scripture_, a fifth-grade cultivation art... with... three secret methods."

Doubt flickered in Li Ximing's mind.

He remembered Kong Tingyun once asking Li Qinghong how many secret methods the Li family's art had. Li Qinghong had said one, and Kong Tingyun had replied, 'That's quite normal.' At the time, he thought she was just being polite. Considering his clan's _Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun_ and the _Golden Book of Houshu_, it seemed to him that most clans should have at least four or five secret methods, if not six or seven.

But now, he saw that the illustrious Cui clan's art had only three. Meanwhile, the _Radiant Essence Scripture_ in his possession had a staggering nine!

For a moment, he didn't know how to respond. A single thought surfaced in his mind:

'A blessing and a curse.'

He remembered Xiao Chuting mentioning the _Secret Records of Dongli_. Most cultivation arts of the Bright Yang lineage were likely catalogued within it! And the phenomenon from his own breakthrough to Foundation Establishment had been witnessed by many!

But what had he used for that breakthrough? Not the _Radiant Essence Scripture_, but the _Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art_! He had switched to this Purple Mansion art later on.

Why had Daoist Master Yuanxiu and the others always considered him a non-threat? It must be because the _Secret Records of Dongli_ contained an entry for the fourth-grade _Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art_, likely listing it with one secret method, or perhaps none at all. And Si Boxiu had observed his breakthrough phenomenon perfectly...

But when he later broke through to the Purple Mansion realm, he had been using the new art, and its phenomenon was something no one could comprehend. Now, if he were to trade his cultivation art, did the Cui clan have any related records? If someone from their clan used this art to break through, would it be discovered?

The fact that the _Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art_ was in the _Secret Records of Dongli_ proved that the arts bestowed by the Immortal Mirror were pre-existing techniques. This meant the _Radiant Essence Scripture_ could very well lead to disaster.

'And the Eldest Scion cultivated this in the Eastern Sea, so his case isn't a useful reference...'

All these thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant, but Cui Xianye's mind was racing just as fast.

'The Moongaze Lake Li family started from nothing. The Purple Mansion art they luckily obtained probably can't compare to our _Upper Mansion Audience Scripture_, let alone the number of secret methods... His silence... only confirms it.'

# Chapter 722: Sovereign's Perilous Tread

‘If the Li Clan's techniques were inferior, why would the Cui Clan even propose an exchange?’ Li Ximing’s hesitation was born from this exact thought. Cui Xianye instantly grasped the situation. To spare the Daoist Master any awkwardness, he spoke with deep respect.

"Daoist Master, our _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ is merely a fourth-grade technique, and it comes with only a single secret art. How could it possibly compare to your clan's esteemed immortal methods? Furthermore, the _Upper Mansion Audience Scripture_ is one of our most fundamental treasures. I would never dare offer it without the express permission of my elders."

Decisively, he dropped to his knees and bowed low.

"This junior is willing to present the technique to you, Daoist Master. In return, I ask only for a single favor. Your divine abilities are as radiant as the sun, a shield for all of Chongzhou. Should our clan ever face a crisis, I pray you will protect our peace and safety."

Li Ximing paused, his mind racing.

'A single favor for a Purple Mansion cultivation method? Even if it's only fourth-grade with a single secret art… it's still a _Purple Mansion_ technique!'

Cultivation in the Purple Mansion realm was vastly different from Foundation Establishment. Upon breaking through, a cultivator couldn't immediately begin working on their next divine ability. First, they had to refine their current one to the point of perfection. This could be a slow, grinding process, taking decades of patient cultivation to max out the ability. Or, one could accelerate the process by using various spiritual treasures, pills, or specific continuation arts.

Once a divine ability was perfected, the cultivator had to immediately begin on the next. To do this, they needed a Purple Mansion technique to condense a new Immortal Foundation within their sea of Qi and then transfer it to their Shengyang Acupoint. Aided by their existing divine ability, the process was less arduous than the initial breakthrough to Foundation Establishment, but it still demanded a great deal of time.

Some cultivators could resort to unorthodox methods, like refining pills or even consuming another's Immortal Foundation, using specific arts to absorb it directly into their Shengyang Acupoint and gestate a new power. But for someone like Li Ximing, the only path forward was to follow a proper Purple Mansion technique, building his power step by painstaking step. Without such a technique, he would be trapped with a single divine ability until his death. Its importance to him was immeasurable.

For a cultivator like Ning Tiaoxiao, who had been stuck in the early Purple Mansion realm for years without a proper technique, a method like this would be priceless. He would trade almost anything for it. A Purple Mansion expert might scheme endlessly for such an opportunity; a single favor was a pittance in comparison.

Though Li Ximing generally trusted the Cui Clan, he didn't accept the offer right away. He took a slow sip of tea, saying nothing. Cui Xianye, his forehead still pressed to the floor, continued to speak.

"The Cui Clan has been isolated overseas for a millennium, but our loyalty has never wavered. In all the dealings between our two families, we have always supported one another. My request today is not merely a transaction; it is an appeal based on the bonds of our shared history."

"Our clan has the protection of a draconic ally, so we rarely face threats to our very foundation. The favor I ask is for a future possibility: if we ever discover the location of a Bright Yang spiritual object, we would need to ask for your aid in securing it."

Li Ximing was mostly convinced. He gave a thoughtful nod, a smile touching his lips.

"Favors are a part of any lasting relationship. As long as what you ask is within my power, I will certainly lend my aid."

"What's most important is that our families strengthen our ties. Everything else is a natural part of that friendship. Now that we're renewing our old bonds, the Cui Clan should send some of your younger generation to cultivate by the lake, and my Li Clan will send some of ours to your island."

Only then did Cui Xianye rise, taking a respectful step back.

"As you command, Daoist Master. The Jue generation of our clan is just now reaching maturity. I shall summon one for you to inspect."

He turned, first addressing Cui Wanqing.

"Go and fetch the _Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass_."

Cui Wanqing bowed with grave formality and departed. He then summoned another attendant.

"Bring Jueyin here."

The entire sequence of actions was a masterclass in showing respect, and Li Ximing couldn't help but admire the Cui Clan's discipline. A moment later, a figure entered the hall.

The man's features were pleasant enough, with well-defined brows, but what truly stood out was his scholarly and graceful bearing. He entered the hall, bowed first to Cui Xianye, then turned his attention to Li Ximing. He immediately took a respectful step back and bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Cui Xianye turned to make the introduction.

"This is Cui Jueyin, the second eldest of our Jue generation. He has been known since youth for his humility and grace, and is held in high esteem by the clan."

Li Ximing was in dire need of capable hands. Seeing that Cui Jueyin was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator and, more importantly, a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion clan, he was delighted. The Cui might have declined, but their heritage was undeniable.

"Jueyin," he said warmly, "would you be willing to return with me to the lake?"

Though he'd been summoned abruptly, Cui Jueyin was sharp. From Cui Xianye’s demeanor, Li Ximing’s welcoming tone, and the mention of "the lake," he had already pieced together the situation. He bowed again.

"To meet you, Daoist Master, and to have the chance to cultivate at the immortal lake is the greatest fortune of my life. I am both humbled and overjoyed to accept."

Li Ximing laughed heartily as Cui Wanqing returned, presenting a jade tray. "Daoist Master," she said softly, "the _Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass_, its secret art, and the activation incantations are here."

She presented the tray. On it lay three jade slips and a small jade box. Li Ximing swept his spiritual sense over them, identifying the contents: one slip for the _Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass_, one for its secret art, and a third containing the incantation to unlock them.

'A Purple Mansion technique, after all,' he thought. 'Even the unlocking incantation needs its own jade slip.'

Given its value, it was best to verify the contents immediately. Without delay, he used the incantation to access the scripture and began to read.

"The Divine Ability of the Supreme Radiance Profound Dharma Body is attained by embracing the nature of Bright Yang and treading a perilous path. Through the cycles of descent, one arrives at the realm of awakened clarity. With a focused heart and a purified will, the divine ability is forged. Only then is it understood that a treasured vessel finds its perfection through its flaws. From this emerges a form clad in profound robes and golden armor, borne upon a chariot drawn by a white luan..."

His eyes scanned to the end, where a particular phrase caught his attention. It was strikingly familiar.

"Shining upon the eight directions, all sovereigns pay homage. Ten thousand spirits bow in reverence. Supreme Radiance, the Celestial God!"

Those were the exact words of the casting incantation for his own technique, Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

'So, Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light and Sovereign's Perilous Tread are deeply connected!'

His spirits soared. He turned his attention to the secret art. Its name was _The Art of the Body That Breaks a Hundred Formations_. He read it through and muttered to himself.

"Isn't this just my clan's Folding technique? Why give it such a ridiculously long name?"

Li Ximing had studied all nine of his clan's secret arts. The text for _The Art of the Body That Breaks a Hundred Formations_ was pathetically short compared to his own clan's version of the Folding technique. After reading it through once, he was simply stunned.

He couldn't stop himself from reading it a second time, his mind reeling.

'What??'

Li Ximing had always lamented how difficult it was to cultivate his clan's secret arts. He'd assumed they were the raw, original texts, full of archaic and obscure language. He often imagined that major sects like the Azure Pond or Golden Feather must have volumes of annotations and interpretations, allowing their disciples to learn with twice the results for half the effort.

But looking at this, he realized _this_ was the original text. His clan's version was the heavily annotated one!

Reading _The Art of the Body That Breaks a Hundred Formations_ made his scalp crawl. If his clan's version was a finely prepared cake, this was the raw, unhusked grain!

'No wonder it was so easy to learn…' he thought, a little deflated. 'And here I was, thinking I was a peerless genius…'

He gave a wry laugh, though he didn't feel particularly discouraged. His clan lacked the deep heritage of a major sect; it was only natural that his cultivation path would be smoother, and his understanding less profound than that of their core disciples.

He collected the jade slips and turned back to Cui Xianye.

"I will accept this technique," he said. "When you need my help, send a messenger inland."

# Chapter 723: A Fulfilling Return

Amidst the respectful farewells of the Cui clan, Li Ximing departed the island. Cui Jueyin stood bathed in the heavenly light, a touch of melancholy in his eyes, but Li Ximing had no time for him. He was engrossed in reading _The Art of the Body That Breaks a Hundred Formations_ over and over, gaining a deeper understanding of the secret art.

'It's like a small fragment torn from the full "Art of Returning Fold,"' he mused. 'As if eight out of every ten words have been removed. It's incomplete, yet it resonates with the _Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass_, making it just barely possible to cultivate.'

'If I were using a different Immortal Foundation… one for Audience with the Celestial Gate, for instance, this would be impossible to learn.'

His mind was already racing with calculations.

'_The Art of the Body That Breaks a Hundred Formations_ can't be used with Audience with the Celestial Gate, but my family's complete "Art of Returning Fold" is likely compatible with any Immortal Foundation. Once I have all nine secret arts in hand, I can choose any cultivation method within the Bright Yang Dao, and my family will have nine corresponding arts to master!'

'Even the imperial clans of old could boast no more than this!'

He felt a flash of embarrassment, recalling his earlier complaints about the secret art being too simplistic. He retrieved a jade slip from his robes. To Cui Jueyin, his expression was solemn and profound, as if he were contemplating a pivotal move involving a great divine ability. The younger man didn't dare to speak.

But inside, Li Ximing was muttering to himself, 'What even is this?'

The jade slip contained nearly a hundred thousand words detailing his understanding of the secrets of Yang Origin. Comparing it to the profound art he now held, his lengthy treatise was less like grinding wheat and more like teaching someone how to swallow a pastry without choking.

He winced, cringing at the thought.

'Back then, the family's legacy was incomplete, and my understanding of the Bright Yang Dao was hardly better than a rogue cultivator's. If I left this in the clan archives, I wouldn't dare sign my own name… Future generations would see it and wonder how the great Daoist Master Zhaojing, the first of his rank in the Li family, could have written almost a hundred thousand words of utter nonsense.'

He wanted to toss it away but felt it was a waste. Instead, he found the signature line and casually inscribed the name "Daoist Master Gufeng." Only then did he tuck it back into his sleeve. Seeing his calm and resolute expression, Cui Jueyin sighed internally.

'The thoughts of a Daoist Master are truly impossible to fathom… Our clan's support must have given him even greater confidence.'

With that small matter settled, Li Ximing finally turned his thoughts to the origins of the _Radiant Essence Scripture_.

'Nine secret arts, yet it's only a fifth-grade cultivation manual! The Immortal Mirror's gifts… what is the principle behind them?'

The _Radiant Essence Scripture_ had been bestowed upon Li Zhouwei. That White Qilin, a talent the Li family might see only once in a century, was clearly the reason for the nine secret arts. And yet, the scripture itself was only fifth-grade.

'Based on the examples of Jiangqian and Quewan, it seems the cultivation method and the secret arts are granted separately… Minghuang's destiny is unique, so he received the ultimate number of nine secret arts…'

He hazarded a guess, a rough calculation forming in his mind. As he flew onward, the winds over the sea grew stronger, and the waves swelled. A few fish darted across the surface, and when the occasional demonic beast emerged, the heavenly light beneath his feet would graze it, instantly turning it to ash.

Li Ximing was no longer the man he once was. The light between his brows pulsed, connecting him to the Great Void and allowing him to perceive the subtle shifts in the spiritual qi.

'The spiritual qi is growing more volatile toward the southeast…' his calculations revealed.

'The fall of water and the rise of thunder are the affairs of True Monarchs. Meddling will only lead to disaster. Even with a divine ability, one cannot simply go wherever one pleases.'

He triangulated the position, which seemed to be near the World's Navel island. The Eastern Sea was the domain of dragons, and he had no intention of wandering into their territory without a guarantee of his safety. He steered his course back toward the mainland and Moongaze Lake.

'Still,' he thought, 'the spring water on that World's Navel island is said to have some miraculous properties. When my other affairs are settled, it might be worth a visit.'

The Great Void was a turbulent expanse, and this was Cui Jueyin's first time witnessing it as described in the records. He observed his surroundings with great curiosity. Li Ximing, pleased with his new subordinate and the renewed progress on his cultivation path, was in high spirits. Not wanting to waste time, he took out the scroll Changxi had given him, _Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire_, and began to read.

The name alone suggested it was no modern creation. The incantatory, insight-driven naming convention was similar to the _Six Chapters on Seeking Immortality_ and other texts his elders had recovered from the Green Pine Grotto-Heaven. It likely hailed from at least that same ancient era.

Li Ximing skimmed the contents. It mostly described profound and wondrous methods involving high-platform rituals, various spiritual materials, Li Fire, and Baleful Earth Qi. A number of cultivators were required to assist in refining a spiritual embryo over a great many years.

He looked closer at the description of these assistants: "Their seas of qi show a floating light, yet to reach Shengyang; possessing some minor wonders, but not yet divine abilities."

'So, Foundation Establishment cultivators… The ancients really had a grand way of speaking.'

Li Ximing scoffed inwardly. It seemed the ritual required twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators, working in two alternating teams of six. Furthermore, their Immortal Foundations could not conflict with the spiritual embryo. For example, when refining a Bright Yang artifact, cultivators of the Veiled Yin or Radiant Essence paths were unsuitable, and it was best to also avoid Pit Water from the Water Virtues.

'Thankfully, our family doesn't practice those first two paths.'

He paused, his attention caught by the mention of Pit Water. If there was one potential conflict, this was it. His family possessed quite a few Pit Water cultivation methods, and he had practiced them himself. Logically, there was no inherent conflict between Bright Yang and Pit Water. With his current level of understanding, he made an educated guess.

'Li Fire and Bright Yang are of the same Dao. Li Fire and Pit Water are opposites. That must be the reason.'

Dismissing the thought, his mind turned to selecting a spiritual embryo.

He didn't have many Foundation Establishment-level Dharma Artifacts. The Sun Seeker Ring was inscrutable, and it bore the name of a Green Pine Temple cultivator, so he couldn't use it. Aside from a few lesser items, the only ones worthy of being a spiritual embryo were the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner, and the Profound Pattern Vase.

The Chongming Profound Insight Screen was mysterious; he was almost certain it was fundamentally an artifact of the Supreme Yang Dao. It was one of the few confirmed ancient artifacts in his family's possession, and he had always treasured it, believing it held a profound secret.

The other ancient artifact was the Profound Pattern Vase. While it lacked overwhelming power, its marvelous versatility had long been valued by the Li family. They had never seen another artifact that could change and adapt along with its wielder, as if its wonders were limitless—a testament to the supreme skill of the ancients.

'Since the Profound Pattern Vase was part of the Wei-Li inheritance, it's very likely it can be used as a Bright Yang artifact. It's worth a try. Even if this method fails, the Azure Pond Sect's Purple Mansion cultivators have entered the Dongli Grotto-Heaven. It wouldn't be too difficult to trade for a top-tier Bright Yang artifact from them.'

---

Inside the world of the Immortal Mirror.

The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity.

Within the obsidian hall, the power of the Supreme Yin surged. Golden osmanthus and silver cassia patterns adorned every surface. Moonlight lamps cast a cold glow upon constructs of sculpted snow. Everywhere one looked, there were images of jade rabbits and moon toads. A few snowflakes drifted down from the ceiling. A figure walked through the palace, hands tucked into his sleeves.

The young man had a broad forehead and a thick head of hair and beard that cascended down his cheeks. His face was pale, his eyes a light shade of teal. His sleeves were embroidered with crashing waves. He walked into a courtyard, found a spot, and sat down. When he saw another official from the palace take a seat nearby, he asked:

"Lord Liu, do you have any connections in the lower realm? When will Lord Li be returning?"

The other man, an immortal official in white robes, simply shook his head.

"Time flows differently in the lower realm. We have no sense of the years there. If he has taken up cultivation, it could be a thousand years for all we know. He won't be back so quickly."

"A thousand years? Ugh! This is going to kill me!"

The news struck the young man like a physical blow, and he slumped in his seat, dazed.

This was, of course, Dangjiang. He had been here, transcribing techniques for who knows how long. He studied day and night, his mouth dry from the endless work, while the cabinets continued to spew forth an inexhaustible supply of jade slips.

Dangjiang was not a diligent person by nature, and compiling techniques was grueling labor with no rest. Having finally earned a short break, he had come out to ask for news of the Li Immortal Official, only to be met with this crushing reality.

He sat there for a long time, in no mood to appreciate the snow falling in the courtyard. Suddenly, the immortal official beside him, Lord Liu, shot to his feet and bowed respectfully.

"Greetings, my Lord!"

Dangjiang quickly looked up to see a stern-faced immortal general in silver armor standing at the edge of the courtyard. The general's features were sharp, as if carved from stone. The young man scrambled to his feet and sighed.

"Greetings, Immortal General!"

The man was none other than Zhengao, the Supreme Yin's Luminous Immortal General. Ever since Dangjiang had arrived, Zhengao had dumped him in this forsaken place to toil endlessly. The people here were few and far between, all of them elusive and taciturn. Finding Zhengao himself was next to impossible. Dangjiang was about to burst from frustration.

Finally seeing his superior, he was overcome with emotion. "It has been a long time, my Lord!"

Zhengao replied coolly, "A trip to the lower realm. It was not so long."

In the world within the mirror, everyone but Dangjiang was an illusion. Zhengao was, of course, a puppet controlled by Lu Jiangxian. Even Lord Liu at his side was the same. The reason they were so quiet was simply that Lu Jiangxian couldn't be bothered to respond to the talkative fellow.

During Li Ximing's breakthrough journey, he had visited several powers: the Azure Pond Sect, Mount Xianyou, the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate, the Xuanmiao Temple, the Profound Peak Gate, and the Cui family's Chongzhou Island.

Lu Jiangxian hadn't watched constantly, but the Immortal Mirror's gaze had followed from the Great Void, collecting every technique and secret art it could. However, most sects had their secret arts locked down, making them difficult to decipher. The harvest was thus neither large nor small.

Chongzhou Island, the Sword Gate, and the Azure Pond Sect each had specialized secret locks on their cultivation manuals. For any high-grade method, the decryption keys seemed to be passed down through individual peaks or bloodlines, not recorded in the jade slips. The gains there were minimal.

As for that old fox Xiao Chuting of Mount Xianyou, he had locked every single one of his cultivation methods from beginning to end. From the entire, vast Mount Xianyou, Lu Jiangxian had come away with nothing.

Only the Xuanmiao Temple and the Profound Peak Gate had shallow foundations and lacked a grand heritage. The decryption arts for their techniques were recorded on jade slips. Profound Peak was slightly better; the keys for their Purple Mansion methods were likely in Changxi's storage pouch. But everything else was laid bare. As for the Xuanmiao Temple, which had only been in Jiangbei for a little over a decade, its systems were incomplete. The decryption method for their Purple Mansion technique was right behind the statue of their patriarch, True Monarch Suxiang, allowing Lu Jiangxian to sweep the place clean.

'Most of it is just miscellaneous arts and Foundation Establishment techniques. I got a good number of third and fourth-grade sword arts from the Sword Gate. The Xuanmiao Temple had the fewest techniques overall, but they did have one fifth-grade Purple Mansion method, the _Sutra of the Majestic Jeweled Visage and Treasured Earth_… a rare technique of the Treasured Earth Dao.'

These were all expected gains. But as Li Ximing sped across the Eastern Sea, Lu Jiangxian had unintentionally scanned a grotto-heaven that seemed to belong to some ancient cultivator.

The grotto-heaven's formations were flawless. Even if Li Ximing had been standing right in front of it, he wouldn't have noticed a thing. Lu Jiangxian didn't bother wasting effort to break them; his divine sense simply passed through the arrays for a quick tour. The space inside was quite large, but held nothing of exceptional note. He simply read the formation plates and committed them to memory.

All the other cultivation methods were dumped into the Scripture Pavilion on the mountain, left to gather dust. These techniques bore the distinct signatures of their parent sects. Without being modified by Dangjiang or himself, they couldn't be used freely and could only serve as references.

Now, however, an idea began to form in his mind. He didn't want Dangjiang just altering minor arts day after day. The number of techniques in the pavilion was becoming absurd, and bestowing them upon the Li family one by one was too inefficient. He wanted to find a way to use the connection between the Talisman Seeds to let the Li family members choose for themselves.

'If I do that, I'll need someone in the pavilion to manage things and guide them. In the future, if there's more information I can disclose to the Li family, this would also be more convenient.'

'Take that grotto-heaven, for instance. If I had a point of contact, I could invent an excuse and bestow it upon them, rather than letting it go to waste at the bottom of the sea.'

In any case, it made no difference to Dangjiang where he worked. And if he wasn't in this palace, Lu Jiangxian wouldn't have to constantly manifest illusions to deal with him. Possessing memories from generations of the Li family, Lu Jiangxian had no intention of ever meeting them directly. This was all just proactive planning.

Thus, inhabiting the body of Zhengao, he had sought Dangjiang out. He nodded. "Although I was on a trip to the lower realm, Lord Liu informed me that you have been diligent and hardworking, burning the midnight oil. I have also reviewed the techniques you've modified. Most are useful. Although some were sent back for revision, I can see that you put your heart into it."

"This… Thank you for your understanding, my Lord!"

Dangjiang was overjoyed to hear this and shot a grateful look at Lord Liu.

Zhengao continued, "Since you are so dedicated and capable, I will arrange an official post for you in the heavens. What do you think?"

This was the moment Dangjiang had been working so tirelessly for. He was ecstatic and bowed low.

"My lord's grace… is etched upon my very soul… I…"

Before he could finish, Zhengao waved his hand. "I have already spoken with the Ministry of Merit. I have found a pavilion for you at the edge of the heavens. We are short-staffed, and that pavilion has been abandoned for a long time. It was originally the official post of Immortal Official Li. Now that he has returned from the lower realm, he is certain to receive a fine new position, leaving this one vacant. Since you are so skilled in Daoist arts, I will dispatch you there to manage the cultivation techniques and secret arts. You will hold the post in his stead for now."

'Huh?'

Hearing that it was the same soul-crushing work, Dangjiang nearly cried out. He lamented internally, 'What do you mean, "skilled in Daoist arts"? What else have I been allowed to do? You could have sent me to meet people, to patrol a pavilion, to stand guard in the heavens, or even to slay demons in the lower realm! Anything would have been better… Why is it "skilled in Daoist arts" again?!'

Lu Jiangxian knew he was a chatterbox by nature and not suited for the quiet work of modifying techniques. But where was there a heaven for him to patrol? Where were there demons for him to slay? He asked coolly, "Are you suggesting the post is too humble?"

The question sealed his fate. How could Dangjiang dare to argue? He shook his head repeatedly, spouting words of gratitude. Lu Jiangxian found it amusing and, controlling Zhengao, turned to leave.

"Pack your things. I will take you to the edge of the heavens."

After Zhengao left the courtyard, Lord Liu was no longer a respectfully silent attendant. He came to life at once, clasping his hands in congratulations.

"Congratulations, congratulations!"

Dangjiang was torn between joy and sorrow. He was happy to finally have an official post in the heavens, but he despaired at having to continue this exhausting work, which would likely now come in even greater volumes. Lu Jiangxian, inhabiting Lord Liu, drew on the management-speak of his past life to console him.

"This position is quite good, you know. We are colleagues now! Which of the immortal officials didn't start this way? Just keep your head down and work hard! You'll see the light at the end of the tunnel eventually!"

Dangjiang gritted his teeth and replied, "When I finally make something of myself and get a chance to go to the lower realm, I'm going to have a long, long talk with Daoist Friend Li… This is hundreds of years of work he's dumped on me!"

# Chapter 724: The Secret of the Essence Gathering Pill

Li Ximing tore through the Great Void and descended upon Gardenia Scenery Mountain. After settling in, he sent a messenger to summon Li Zhouwei and took a seat at a table. Cui Jueyin, not daring to sit, stood respectfully to the side.

As Li Ximing asked a few questions about matters overseas, which Cui Jueyin answered with deference, a figure was seen ascending the mountain path.

The man was tall and lean, radiating a powerful, athletic energy without appearing overly muscular. At a glance, he seemed formidable but not extraordinary. His golden eyes, however, were another matter entirely—one look was enough to inspire a deep-seated awe.

The moment Cui Jueyin saw those golden eyes, his mind went blank.

'An imperial descendant? The Li family of Moongaze Lake has a legitimate bloodline!'

The Cui family might mistake many things, but they could never be wrong about the Wei-Li lineage. The man before him might not be on par with the Crown Prince Li Xunquan of old, but he was certainly at the level of Li Xuan, who had nearly restored their dynasty. Shaken to his core, Cui Jueyin immediately bowed low.

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

Li Zhouwei, who seemed to be in good spirits, did not recognize the man before him. He offered a slight nod and a grunt of acknowledgment, his expression quizzical.

"Minghuang," Li Ximing said with a smile, "this is a direct descendant of the Cui family."

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei. "Ah, from the Cui clan," he said, nodding. "There is no need for such ceremony."

Cui Jueyin respectfully stepped aside as another man came up behind Li Zhouwei. This newcomer was a mountain of a man—burly and broad-shouldered, with a pair of golden hammers in his hands.

A hint of pleasure touched Li Zhouwei's face. "Daoist Master, Li Wen has succeeded! He has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

This was indeed Li Wen, who had been in seclusion at the spirit jade mine in the Helin Mountains. Li Ximing's eyebrows shot up. "What a stroke of good fortune!" he exclaimed with a laugh.

And what fortune it was. Among all the Li family members, Li Wen’s breakthrough to Foundation Establishment was a perfect confluence of timing, location, and opportunity. Li Ximing had assessed him long ago; the man’s chances were far slimmer than those of the fallen Li Chengliao, yet he had been the one to succeed.

Li Ximing looked at him with a sense of wonder. "You cultivate the path of Jade True, and your innate talent is comparable to An Zheyan's. A breakthrough should have been beyond your destiny. Yet, during your time as a Qi Refining cultivator, a True Monarch achieved their Dao, causing a surge in the world's jade essence and giving you a sliver of a chance."

"Then you went into seclusion. The family was embroiled in the war between the north and south, and the Essence Gathering Pills that were once unobtainable became available. You were also in the newly discovered spirit jade mine in the Helin Mountains, a place blessed with its own spiritual nexus. Not even a direct disciple of the Azure Pond Sect could ask for better circumstances."

"You were in seclusion for seven years, and the breakthrough must have been incredibly difficult. But then, the master of Mount Changhuai fell. The spiritual feedback from his death, 'Inward Heart Surging Profundity,' was beneficial to the Ancient Merging and Immortal Daos, and especially to those in seclusion. And the path of Jade True is a branch of Ancient Merging. You truly had every advantage!"

Li Wen, a simple and honest man, merely knelt and nodded.

Li Ximing let out a hearty laugh. "With all that, how could you possibly have failed?"

Li Zhouwei smiled and nodded in agreement. Li Wen, in his booming voice, said, "It was all just luck. But the real congratulations belong to you, Daoist Master. One Purple Mansion cultivator on the lake is worth more than a hundred of me."

Li Wen was one of the old guard. Li Ximing remembered seeing him by Li Yuanping’s side since he was a child and recalled the old man's bitter tears when his father had died. The memories warmed his heart, and he felt a surge of genuine delight, repeating, "Excellent, excellent!"

Cui Jueyin watched from the side, taking careful note. Though he was confident this rough-hewn man wouldn't last fifty rounds against him, his close relationship with Li Ximing was clear.

"Jueyin," Li Ximing said, turning to him, "what cultivation art do you practice? What scriptures have you studied? What techniques have you mastered?"

Cui Jueyin quickly replied, "I cultivate the 'Eternal Brightness Steps,' a fifth-grade art. I have studied most of the family's Bright Yang scrolls and have trained in the required magical arts, radiance techniques, ocular arts, and movement skills. Among my peers on the island, I rank in the top three."

He continued, "In combat, demonic and rogue cultivators are no match for me. As long as our Dao paths are not in direct conflict, I can hold my own against mid-stage and even late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. Against noble demon beasts of the same level in the sea, I can fight them to a standstill."

Li Ximing nodded, satisfied. He then instructed Li Wen, "Take this young master of the Cui family down and arrange a place for him to stay on the island."

Cui Jueyin rose to leave, his gaze still lingering on Li Zhouwei.

"Once everything is settled," Li Ximing said with a smile, "you can have a proper talk with my Minghuang."

As the two departed, Li Ximing’s expression grew serious. "This journey was indeed fruitful."

He recounted his gains, taking out the _Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass_ for Li Zhouwei to inspect. "Cui Jueyin is not one to boast," he concluded. "If he says he can 'hold his own,' his strength must be comparable. With his wide range of techniques and deep cultivation, you are likely the only one in the family who can definitively suppress him. If Cheng'e or Weizeng were to fight him, they would be at a disadvantage within a hundred rounds, and in serious danger if the fight went on longer."

Cui Xianye had clearly not been perfunctory. While it wasn't the all-out support of Li Xunquan and Li Xuan's era, he had still sent one of his family's most outstanding disciples.

"The Cui and Li families emerged from the same Wei dynasty," Li Zhouwei said, nodding. "Of the four Wei-Li True Monarchs, the Cui clan claimed two. They have been loyal for generations, a trait that remains even now that they are but a single branch. Their situation is far better than ours." The Cui clan of Chongzhou Island could trace its lineage directly, unlike the Li family, which had to publicly deny its heritage.

Li Zhouwei produced a letter from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing. It was Li Chenghui's report on the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion.

Li Ximing read it carefully, his interest piqued. "Since the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion have a legacy, could they have..."

He was, of course, thinking of the Immortal Mirror fragment he had once obtained from a Secret Diffusion cultivator. He didn't need to say it aloud; Li Zhouwei understood.

"On matters concerning the Purple Mansion, we cannot rely on a single source. This may not be as simple as it appears. Our family has many other priorities at the moment, and this Dharma Artifact is not something that can be dealt with in a year or two. We should observe for now."

"As for Wenhu... he holds the legacy of the Dense Cloud Cave, so we cannot kill him carelessly. Let's place him under house arrest to recover and slowly gather information. If this matter proves true, we won't be without a card to play."

"Proceed as you see fit." Li Ximing had complete faith in Li Zhouwei's judgment. He took out the _Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire_ that Changxi had given him and tasked Li Zhouwei with planning the construction of the high platform.

"What is the status of the Jade Court for the Courtly Red Dust Qi?" he asked.

The _Aged Courtly Path Sutra_ practiced on the lake was also a Purple Mansion art, but its Courtly Red Dust Qi required a massive Jade Court. This was the very reason the Li family had been mining in the Helin Mountains.

"We gathered enough material years ago," Li Zhouwei replied. "The mining operations in the Helin Mountains have ceased. But our family has been in turmoil these past years, and we've had no mind to build any Jade Court. The quarried jade is piled up like mountains, most of it still in the Helin range, not yet transported back."

"Besides," he added, "building this Jade Court is an enormous undertaking that would drain our resources and manpower!"

From Li Zhouwei's tone, Li Ximing understood the issue. When it came to moving mountains and hauling stone, who was better suited than their neighbors at the Profound Peak Gate? It was a simple matter of him giving the word. "That's easily solved," he said. "Write a letter to Kong Guxi and ask him to send some of his Earth Virtue Foundation Establishment cultivators to help us move the materials back. We can then use the immortal foundation to construct the Jade Court. We should use these next three years to get it done."

"Also, ask Kong Guxi for a handwritten letter from Changxi authorizing us to move our family's Foundation Establishment spirit root to the island."

With these matters arranged, Li Ximing prepared to enter seclusion. He handed over one last item—a small, purple-flamed cauldron. "This was Yu Yuwei's Dharma Artifact. Send someone to return it."

Even if the cauldron didn't bear the Tuoba family's mark, the Li family would not covet his belongings. With the Yu family scattered, and Yu Yuwei himself having been estranged from them, sending it to Li Quantao to decide its fate was the proper course of action.

After settling the miscellaneous affairs, Li Ximing gave his final instructions. "Our family is experiencing a golden age, the likes of which we haven't seen in a century. With you presiding over the 'Bright Yang' path, we have An Siwei and Li Wen for 'Jade True,' Chenghui for 'Celestial Thunder,' Minggong for 'True Fire,' Chenghuai for 'Upper Shaman,' and the Elder White Ape for 'True Qi.' Externally, we have Qu Bushi of 'Earth Virtue,' Miaoshui of 'Converging Water,' Cui Jueyin, who also follows 'Bright Yang,' and Ding Weizeng of 'Hengzhu'..."

"Excluding those in the dungeon, those under seal, and Jiang Huzi who is near death's door, our family has eleven Foundation Establishment cultivators. We have already caught up to the Yuan family of old, and that's with me overseeing everything... At a time like this, we must be even more cautious."

By Li Ximing's count, their eleven cultivators were still one short of the twelve needed for the _Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire_. Moreover, not everyone was available; each was busy with their own duties. They were still short-handed.

"Who else in the family has a chance at Foundation Establishment?" he asked.

Li Zhouwei knew the roster by heart. "If Chen Mufeng and An Siming from back then were still alive, they could be attempting it now. The two from the Tian family died in seclusion, and we've lost a third from the Jade Court Guard during their breakthrough attempt. The Xu clan has declined... but there is a Fei Qingyi from the Fei family. The descendants of the Western Tan have many Qi Refining cultivators, but they were severely weakened after changing their surname, and none are ready for a breakthrough yet."

"Only Chen Yang is very close."

"Chen Yang..." The name finally registered with Li Ximing. "He cultivates Pit Water... a pity, but he can free up someone else. As for the Fei family... there was a Fei Qingyi who served my elder brother. She could be useful."

The topic of breakthroughs brought a sudden silence. After a moment, Li Ximing asked, "Are there any Essence Gathering Pills left from the ones the Azure Pond Sect gave us? Bring one for me to see."

"Of course."

Li Zhouwei sent someone to fetch them. A short while later, Chen Yang arrived with the pill. Li Ximing glanced at him, took the pill, and immediately dismissed him.

"We received seven from the Azure Pond Sect in total. Father, Aunt, Uncle, Siwei, Li Wen... that leaves two."

The Profound Light in Li Ximing's brow pulsed as he scanned the pill. Finally, he closed his eyes and ground out a single word through his gritted teeth.

"Good!"

The Li family now possessed the formula for the Essence Gathering Pill and could refine it themselves. They were no longer reliant on begging others for something they barely understood. With a single look at the formula and the pill, Li Ximing immediately saw the truth.

The principles behind the Essence Gathering Pill were similar to the methods Purple Mansion cultivators used to extend their path or use spiritual items to aid in mastering divine abilities. Li Ximing had some knowledge of both. Though his skill in magical arts was lacking, his mastery of alchemy was profound. The answer came to him with crystal clarity.

"An Essence Gathering Pill, no matter how many precious secondary ingredients it contains, is fundamentally defined by one primary ingredient. In ancient times, they used 'Lanhu Spirit Grass,' an impossibly rare herb. The modern method is to tailor the ingredient to the individual. For a Pit Water cultivator, the best ingredient would be a Pit Water-aligned material, preferably refined using a divine ability. That would create a true Essence Gathering Pill, far more effective than the one-and-a-half-success-rate versions."

Their own ancestor, Li Tongya, had consumed such a treasure pill, meticulously refined by a Purple Mansion expert, which was why his breakthrough had been so effortless.

Li Ximing sighed internally. "The best choice for the primary ingredient is a fellow cultivator of the same path. A demon beast is the next best thing. Only as a last resort should one use treasure medicines—three at best, one at the very least."

"Now I understand why the direct disciples of Purple Mansion sects have so many successful breakthroughs. They all share the secret of the Essence Gathering Pill and never publicize it. The pills they release, with their paltry success rates, are given to guest elders and peak lords as 'inner sect treatment.' Secretly, they give better ones to the obedient and worse ones to the rebellious or threatening. They might even use a conflicting primary ingredient to sabotage someone. The actual effect is entirely in their control!"

Li Zhouwei's head snapped up, his eyes flashing with dawning horror. The calm in his gaze was instantly replaced by a venomous, astonished rage. "The ones the Azure Pond Sect gave our family!?"

"They were the worst kind. And not just the worst kind!" Li Ximing finally dropped all pretense of restraint, his voice turning vicious. "I've inspected the primary ingredients. They were all Veiled Yin and Radiant Essence! Why did Chengliao fail his breakthrough?! His foundation was Bright Yang! To take an Essence Gathering Pill of Veiled Yin and Radiant Essence... it is unconscionable!"

The five Essence Gathering Pills from the Azure Pond Sect had gray markings, indicating they were made from demon beasts and treasure medicines. Li Ximing had inspected them himself before allowing the family to use them, but back then, he couldn't discern the differences in their immortal foundations.

Li Zhouwei closed his eyes. He finally understood why his father, Li Chengliao, had failed so quickly after only a few years in seclusion, with barely a celestial phenomenon to mark his passing. He understood why they had all used the Essence Gathering Pill, yet his aunt Li Minggong and An Siwei had passed through with danger but ultimately survived... while his father, whose disposition and cultivation art were the finest among them, had failed.

Li Ximing exhaled slowly, the light in his eyes sharpening. "I still remember... back then, Lord Xuanfeng exchanged for an Essence Gathering Pill from the Azure Pond Sect for Second Uncle Li Yuanjiao. He recognized it was a 'human pill' and refused to use it, giving it to Yuan Huyuan instead. Yuan Huyuan then successfully broke through to the Earth Virtue realm... Thinking back, it must have been an Earth Virtue Essence Gathering Pill. Earth buries Pit Water... what a perfect 'Earth buries Pit Water'..."

He took a moment to process the treachery. "The Chi family is destroyed. Chi Fubo and Ning Hejing are dead, their bones scattered... otherwise, I would have torn them to shreds with my own hands!"

Though he spoke with fury, Li Ximing knew that Si Boxiu must have been aware of the truth. Even Si Yuanli likely understood it perfectly! They simply kept it to themselves.

'After all, given the situation at the time, weakening our family was something the Si clan was happy to see... They had no reason to warn us.'

Seeing Li Zhouwei's head bowed in silence, Li Ximing didn't know what to say. He could only sigh. "Among the three cartloads of spiritual items from the Xiao family, there were two Pit Water treasure medicines. Bring them to me for alchemy. Once this pill is refined, I will enter seclusion to work on my divine abilities... A great enemy is approaching."

When he finished, Li Zhouwei had already composed himself. He nodded and withdrew. "Leave the family's affairs to me, Daoist Master. Do not worry."

...

On the lake, spring turned to autumn, and time slipped by. For a Purple Mansion cultivator, a year was little more than a single session of seclusion. Though Li Ximing had mastered his divine ability, his proficiency with its associated arts was lacking. He started with the simplest one, Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.

Fortunately, having the divine ability made mastering the arts much faster. He had also studied the technique before, so he made some progress. In the midst of his training, he made a trip to the Xuanmiao Temple.

Sumian was as welcoming as ever, but when Li Ximing inquired about the Secret Diffusion Sects, their conversation drifted to old tales, and he couldn't glean any concrete information. After much consideration, Li Ximing realized he would likely have to ask the Daoist Master Changyun, the power behind the Brahma Cloud Cave.

But before he could set out, as he was passing through the territory of the Profound Peak Gate, he felt a ripple in the Great Void. The spiritual qi of Bound Earth surged. Descending to the ground to inspect the ley lines, he found that a new mountain had risen within the Profound Peak Gate's domain.

'Someone failed their breakthrough and perished!'

This event, while tragic for Changxi, was expected by Li Ximing and the other Purple Mansion cultivators. The repercussions of 'Inward Heart Surging Profundity'—suppressing Earth and inhibiting demons—were no joke. It had already drastically shortened Changxi's own remaining lifespan; it was only a matter of time before it claimed one of his Foundation Establishment cultivators.

'I should return to the mountain. Changxi might come looking for me.'

This was another cultivator who had fallen into the pit that had claimed Li Chengliao and Yuan Huyuan.

# Chapter 725: Transforming into a Mountain

Li Ximing returned through the Great Void, materializing on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. He listened to Li Wen's report and inquired about the Profound Peak Gate.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, there have been tremors in Shanji Prefecture since midnight, and the sky has been overcast. The Profound Peak Gate announced to the public that the Daoist Master was moving a mountain."

The phenomena caused by Earth Virtue cultivators were tied to the earth's meridians, so nothing could be gleaned from the sky. With the Profound Peak Gate's Purple Mansion formation active, Changxi's explanation was plausible—it did seem as if a new mountain had simply appeared. From the Great Void, however, the truth was clear: someone had failed their breakthrough.

Li Ximing asked, "Where is Minghuang, and who is managing the clan's affairs?"

Li Wen replied, "To the Daoist Master, the clan head has gone to the Baijiang Creek. The eldest young master is currently in charge."

Hearing that Li Jiangqian was in charge, Li Ximing continued, "As I emerged from the Great Void, I saw a great deal of activity on the lake. What's happening?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master," Li Wen answered, "the eldest young master has relocated the declining clans from the island to the lakeside, settling them beneath the six gatehouses. He has also moved direct descendants at the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment realms onto the island."

Li Ximing nodded. He inquired about Li Zhouwei's sons: the eldest, Li Jiangqian, was managing the clan; the second, Li Jianglong, had gone to the Profound Peak Gate; the third, Li Jiangxia, was handling affairs on the eastern shore; and the fourth, Jiangliang, had just left home to focus on his cultivation.

"And the youngest son? Is he like his brothers?"

Li Ximing had heard nothing of the fifth son, Li Jiangnian, so he asked. Li Wen responded in a muffled tone, "The youngest master is growing older. His eyes have lost their color, and he lacks the heroic bearing of his brothers."

Li Ximing had never met the fifth son, but for Li Wen to say such a thing implied a problem far more significant than simply being "lacking." He understood and dismissed the man.

He had only been seated for half an hour when Changxi's divine power indeed appeared in the Great Void. Though the Li clan lacked a Purple Mansion formation that would necessitate a formal entry, Changxi still halted his approach as a courtesy and announced himself before entering.

The old Daoist Master had the appearance of a middle-aged man. A jade pendant hung on his chest, and his face was ruddy, his voice resonant. Yet even Li Ximing, who was unskilled in divination and physiognomy, could see that his divine ability was leaking uncontrollably, agitating the earth meridians. The man was on the verge of death.

No one dared to provoke him in this state. Li Ximing spoke gently, "Senior, you've arrived! I heard the earth meridians in the Profound Peak Gate's territory were unstable. Has something happened?"

Changxi sat opposite him, his expression placid. "Fu En has fallen," he replied. "My territory has merely gained a new mountain."

His detached manner left Li Ximing at a loss for words. After a moment, Daoist Master Changxi spoke again. "Zhaojing, I am about to pass on and transform into a mountain. Have you given any thought as to where this mountain should rest?"

Li Ximing immediately understood that Changxi's condition was far worse than he had imagined. Perhaps it was the shock of failure, or perhaps the effects of _Inward Heart Surging Profundity_ were reaching their peak. With less than two years to his tribulation, the old man could no longer hold on.

'Thank heavens I wasn't wandering outside, heading for the World's Navel... If he had died suddenly, things would have become very complicated.'

He let out a breath and began to consider Changxi's final arrangements.

'According to him, he'll become a mountain after he dies. A Purple Mansion cultivator's final transformation... that mountain will likely be extraordinary. A treasured land.'

Li Ximing had little interest in holding onto Shanji Prefecture; he wasn't even confident he could protect the Profound Peak Gate's main sect. It would be best if Changxi passed on right here by the lake. His clan would gain a Geng Mountain.

'But I can't just say... "Senior, could I trouble you to die on my land?"'

It was an awkward thing to ask. Since Changxi had brought it up, he must have a plan. Li Ximing could only say, "Senior, do you have arrangements? We will follow your wishes."

Changxi glanced at him and nodded. "Even if you don't say it, Zhaojing, I understand. Shanji can't be held, and my own sect's gates may not be defensible. I won't simply hand a prize to the enemy. The Xuanmiao Temple also follows the path of Earth Virtue. Daoist Friend Sumian has invited me there to discuss the Dao at Baihai Creek. I sense my time is near, so I came to invite you to accompany me."

With that, Changxi produced a jade box from his sleeve. Nestled inside was a perfectly round white pearl, emanating fine, colorful rays of light. A carving of a tiger looking over its shoulder adorned its surface, illuminating the room. "Zhaojing, take it," Changxi said.

The mid-grade Bound Earth Dharma Treasure, the _Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger_! After being offered and refused, it had finally landed in Li Ximing's hands.

Li Ximing no longer refused. He reached out and took the box. The white pearl was cold to the touch with the chill of Baleful Earth Qi, and the carved lines of the tiger were so distinct they were almost sharp. As Changxi voluntarily withdrew his divine power, ceding control of the Dharma Treasure, Li Ximing's own Bright Yang ability began to infuse it.

The _Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger_ was a Dharma Treasure, even more powerful than the _Chongming Profound Insight Screen_ the Li clan had once refined. If not for Changxi willingly transferring it, the refinement process alone would have taken an unknown amount of time. As soon as he held it, its abilities naturally unfolded in his mind.

First, it possessed the protective power of Bound Earth. This was an excellent defensive ability that could not only release a _Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen_ to envelop the user's body, but also passively grant Li Ximing a _Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption_, reducing the damage he took from all divine abilities except those of the Twelve Qi and Fire Virtue.

Second, the _Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger_ had a marvelous earth-burrowing ability called _Sea-Crossing Profound Evasion_. It allowed the user to travel through the earth's meridians like an Earth Virtue cultivator, moving at an incredible speed.

Finally, there was the _Geng Tiger Dao_, which could transform the Dharma Treasure itself into a Geng Tiger to traverse the Great Void. While it had little combat prowess in this form, it possessed a remarkable stealth capability. Unless trapped by a formation in the Great Void, the Geng Tiger would dive deep into the void at the slightest touch of a Purple Mansion divine ability, making it extremely difficult to intercept.

Beyond these, there were numerous minor Earth Virtue abilities. The Dharma Treasure itself was a Purple Mansion-level symbol of Bound Earth. If Li Ximing's own cultivation deepened, he could even use it to cast spells freely. It was just as when Sumian had borrowed the power of Li Ximing and Changxi to heal Ding Weizeng; if Changxi hadn't been present, placing the _Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger_ nearby would have achieved the same effect.

'A fine Dharma Treasure... Changxi may not have had a great reputation in his life, but he certainly had some impressive items tucked away. This treasure is truly useful.'

Despite the growing pressure, Li Ximing was quite pleased with the _Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger_.

He sent someone to inform Li Zhouwei, then rose to leave with Changxi. As they entered the Great Void, the old man said, "Zhaojing, although the _Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger_ is more compatible with my and Sumian's abilities, it doesn't offer anything truly exceptional for us—its functions overlap with our own. After discussing it, we agreed it would be better for you to have it."

"In any upcoming direct confrontations with Purple Mansion cultivators, we'll be relying on your _Audience with the Celestial Gate_."

That was his stated reason, but Li Ximing knew it wasn't just about their abilities. While _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ was indeed a combat-oriented art, the real issue was that his own position was now fundamentally opposed to Yehui's. "Zhaojing understands," he replied.

Changxi continued, "The _Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger_ also shares a common trait of Earth Dharma Treasures—it's essentially a demonic path item. Besides nourishing it with divine power, you can also refine it with blood qi and resentful energy for even greater benefit. Over time, it might undergo even more wondrous transformations."

This gave Li Ximing pause, and a suspicion immediately formed in his mind. The Dharma Treasure was mid-grade; perhaps Changxi had been the one to advance it. But Changxi quickly preempted his thoughts: "I considered refining it that way in the past, but the item is too much of a chicken rib for me. Besides, the amount of material needed is vast. Such resources are scarce within the seas, and I never managed to secure much. I used most of what I had to refine something else."

He pointed to the jade stone on his chest. Li Ximing had been noticing it for some time. "This is the _Qi Stone Demon Embryo_," Changxi said. "I started refining it two hundred years ago, spending most of my life's savings on it. If I weren't bound by the ambiance of _Inward Heart Surging Profundity_, with the waters of the Eastern Sea descending and thunder ascending, I wouldn't have ended up in this state."

Hearing the name, Li Ximing was inwardly shocked, but his expression remained thoughtful. Changxi chuckled. "This art is a secret of my lineage. It harms the heavens' harmony but can extend one's life. It's not good for one's reputation, and it has many drawbacks. Even the ancestors who used it did so in secret."

'Why is he telling me this?'

Li Ximing hesitated for a moment, but Changxi had already turned away. His voice grew deeper. "Actually... the various houses are very wary of the orthodox Earth Virtue path, especially cultivators who walk the demonic path. Other lineages can be ignored, but an Earth Virtue cultivator who is _also_ an orthodox demonic cultivator inspires fear in everyone. Though the great houses benefited from the transformation of the Thunder Palaces, no one wants to see a repeat of that."

Li Ximing actually knew a little about this. Though he didn't know where Changxi was going with this, he seized the opportunity to ask, "I've read about the _Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace Dao_. After the Purple Mansion realm, the difference between it and the Purple Mansion Golden Core path is not that great... When you say orthodox demonic path... do you mean like Tuoba Chongyuan?"

"Something like that," Changxi said leisurely. "The _Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace Dao_ and the Purple Mansion Golden Core are one and the same—both are the demonic paths of the current age. But there were demonic cultivators in ancient times as well, otherwise why would Kuaili have been a Demon Monarch? The Tuoba clan is also a branch of the orthodox demonic path."

The old man snorted. "Arts are not taught lightly, so orthodoxies are born. If this side has an orthodoxy, so does that one. Those who attain Fruition don't pass down their own techniques; they bestow lesser arts upon others. By the time it reaches people like us, we use Foundation Establishment texts to control those below us. Isn't it all from the same source? Just as commoners bow their heads to our direct lineages, we too must bow our heads to the orthodox lines. To be another's plaything—is that not the natural order of things?"

He seemed to recall the painful memory of his clan's "one-incense-stick" legacy. He took a couple of deep breaths. On the verge of death, he pushed himself to materialize on a dark mountain cliff. He and Li Ximing descended towards the Xuanmiao Temple. The person who came to greet them, however, was not Qiuxin, but a pale, beardless, middle-aged man: Kong Guxi.

Someone from the Profound Peak Gate had already arrived.

Kong Guxi craned his neck, looking as terrified as a plucked quail. His already large eyes were wide with fear, making his Daoist robes hang loosely from his frame, as if on a coat rack.

He drifted over, was impatiently shoved aside by Changxi, and stumbled into a clumsy kowtow before bursting into tears. Changxi ignored him and looked only at Sumian. The old abbot stood with his hands tucked in his sleeves, his face etched with anxiety.

Changxi asked, "Which courtyard? Have you made the arrangements, Daoist Friend?"

Sumian quickly led the way to the far end of the cliff. "Daoist Friend..." he began anxiously, "that thing..."

"Ah!" Changxi took the _Qi Stone Demon Embryo_ from his neck and pressed it into Sumian's hand. "No third person knows of this item."

Li Ximing, who had been standing by with a downcast and respectful expression, felt his mind race.

'No third person knows? But you just told me!'

'What is Changxi doing? Is this leverage? A hint? The _Qi Stone Demon Embryo_ is bad for one's reputation and has many drawbacks... Is he leaving me a way to force the Xuanmiao Temple's hand in the future?'

Li Ximing's composure held; his expression didn't flicker. Sumian silently accepted the item and replied, "I will do my utmost to protect the Profound Peak Gate."

They had now reached the courtyard. An area a hundred li across had been cleared out, clearly in long anticipation of Changxi's death. It was a barren patch of yellow earth, save for a few frail blades of grass sprouting from the ground, swaying in the spring breeze.

Stones had begun to fall from beneath Changxi's robes, clattering and kicking up dust. He hurried into the courtyard. His robes billowed, but there was no grace in the movement—he looked like a bird throwing itself into a net. He sat cross-legged on the cot.

The Xuanmiao Temple was simple and unadorned, and this courtyard was no exception. As he sat on the cot, he looked so cramped it seemed he couldn't even stretch his limbs.

"Kong Guxi!" Changxi called.

Kong Guxi flew up, then immediately plummeted from the air. He landed nearby, ignoring the indignity of his ancestor sitting forlornly in the courtyard, and stared at him with a terrified, outstretched neck.

Changxi murmured, "Kong Guxi, my Kong clan rose from humble beginnings. We were never fated to have a Purple Mansion cultivator. But a True Monarch was reincarnated and slaughtered my people, transferring their destiny to me. I was to ascend to the Purple Mansion realm only to be a stepping stone for another..."

At these words, Kong Guxi lowered his head in silence. Li Ximing frowned, and fear flickered in Sumian's eyes. Standing beside Li Ximing, he sighed, "He's grown senile! Such things cannot be spoken..."

As if ignited by the words, Changxi seemed to grow intensely hot. He kicked out his legs and rolled up his sleeves, hesitating before finally saying, "Follow Daoist Master Zhaojing's orders."

Kong Guxi nodded again. Changxi could no longer sit upright. He fell onto the cot, tossing and turning as a deep rumbling began to sound from beneath the earth.

At last, Changxi spoke his final words: "When I die, I will become a mountain, six hundred and twenty-one ren high. To the north, there will be three peaks, a hundred paces apart. To the east and south, nine peaks in total, covered in persimmon trees. The sunny slopes will be rich with red copper, the shaded slopes with white gold. From the true south, a spring will gush forth white jade, flowing south to form a creek that empties into Lake Xian. The waters will teem with vipers and black turtles. The descendants of my Kong clan may pay homage from afar, but they are forbidden to ascend."

"This junior will remember!" Kong Guxi sobbed.

Daoist Master Changxi let out a muffled grunt. "The pain is killing me!"

His cry was like a thunderclap. The earth meridians beneath them swelled as if inflated, and menacing white stones and massive peaks burst from the soil. Mountain peaks shot up like bamboo after a spring rain. Kong Guxi couldn't keep his footing.

His staggering, choked farewell to his ancestor was completely swallowed by the earth-shaking cataclysm, heard by no one. The ground beneath them rose dramatically. Red copper, white gold, and twelve peaks appeared one by one. A spring gushed forth, and trees grew so rapidly they formed a dense canopy, from which the faint sound of cicadas could be heard.

Changxi's words had all come to pass, without the slightest deviation.

The courtyard and the old man were gone, as if they had been an illusion. All that remained before Kong Guxi was a Daoist robe, hanging from a tree branch, swaying silently. The forest was terrifyingly quiet, filled with the shadows of branches.

He carefully pulled it down. After taking a few bewildered steps, he finally heard the cries of alarm and praise from the Xuanmiao Temple cultivators at the foot of the new mountain.

Kong Guxi thought, 'There should be laughter, too, shouldn't there?'

**A Note on the Essence Gathering Pills**

The Li clan received a total of seven Essence Gathering Pills from the Azure Pond Sect, all of the Veiled Yin and Radiant Essence type. The first two came from the Ning family, originally obtained through a trade between the Azure Pond Sect and the Xiao family.

These two were consumed by Li Chengliao and Li Minggong (it was originally meant for Chenghuai, but his cultivation path change caused a delay, so Minggong took it). At that time, the Ning family no longer had a Purple Mansion cultivator, so the decision was effectively Chi Zhiyan's. According to the plot, the Xiao family and the Azure Pond Sect had an ongoing trade relationship in pills. Xiao Chuting was in the Northern Sea at the time, and Chi Zhiyan knew the Li clan did not consume blood-qi pills, so he specifically selected those from the batch traded with the Xiao family.

Another point some readers might not know is that grey-patterned pills can also be refined from demon beasts, with slight differences. Li Ximing can distinguish them. I forgot to clarify this when the next five pills were used.

I was in a rush yesterday, so I'm making detailed corrections today.

# Chapter 726: Four Borders

The mountain shot into the sky. Li Ximing, treading on the celestial light, saw Kong Guxi leaning against a tree in the forest, his face a mask of panic. He had none of the bearing expected of the Profound Peak Gate's master.

'They had no successor, so Changxi had no choice but to pick him,' Li Ximing mused. 'An obedient puppet was the best he could hope for, not someone with true grit. Besides, any man would be stunned after watching his clan's Purple Mansion cultivator perish.'

Although Changxi had never truly taken him into his confidence, he was still a senior who had offered much guidance during Li Ximing's early days in the Purple Mansion Realm. Out of respect for the man, if not his schemes, Li Ximing bowed his head in a silent salute.

Below, the people from the Xuanmiao Temple were still exclaiming in awe and praise. Their voices carried clearly enough for even Kong Guxi to hear, let alone cultivators with divine abilities like Li Ximing and Sumian. No matter how tragic his end, Changxi had been a Purple Mansion Daoist Master. Li Ximing simply raised his head and clasped his hands behind his back, remaining silent.

A man of Sumian's perception could tell from a single glance that Li Ximing was displeased. The Xuanmiao Temple had a relaxed, traditional structure without many strict rules, so things had gotten a bit disorderly. He waved a hand, signaling Qiuxin to go down and disperse the crowd.

Kong Guxi had already taken to the air, clutching a set of Daoist robes to his chest, intending to return and arrange a burial. He stopped before Li Ximing and bowed respectfully. "Greetings, Daoist Master. From this day forward, the Profound Peak Gate will follow your lead."

Li Ximing nodded. Once Kong Guxi was steady in the celestial light, he turned to Sumian and finally voiced the question that had been nagging him. "Senior Sumian, where is Daoist Master Xuanyi?"

Li Ximing remembered it all perfectly. Changxi's support hadn't just come from the Xuanmiao Temple; there was also Mount Jingyi overseas. Daoist Master Xuanyi had taken Yuezhou Island and accepted other benefits from Changxi. In fact, Changxi's premature death was partly due to the aid he'd given Mount Jingyi. Yet now that Changxi was dead, Xuanyi was nowhere to be seen!

At Li Ximing's question, Sumian shook his head, no longer bothering to hide the blatant disgust on his face. "Xuanyi is no saint. With Changxi gone, this is clearly a troublesome situation. What overseas Purple Mansion Daoist Master would eagerly jump into this mess?"

He paused before adding, "Xuanyi is on bad terms with the Chunyi Dao Gate. Guanghou, a Daoist Master from their lineage, has just achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, so Xuanyi's hands are tied. He can't come."

The Chunyi Dao Gate was another ancient, traditional lineage. Qiuxin had once worked with them to ambush demonic cultivators from Jiangnan, securing the Purple Flame Cauldron for the Li Clan. The relationship between the Xuanmiao Temple and the Chunyi Dao Gate was clearly a close one, which explained Sumian's dislike for Xuanyi.

Understanding this connection, Li Ximing saw the root of Sumian's animosity. But this wasn't the time to worry about Xuanyi. He needed to clarify the Xuanmiao Temple's position.

He glanced at Kong Guxi, who still seemed lost in a daze, and decided to speak for him. "With Senior Changxi's passing, the celestial phenomena and shifting ley lines have made the news plain for all to see. The White Ye Immortal Sect has long coveted the Shanji region. Senior, you promised to protect the Profound Peak Gate. What are your plans?"

Daoist Master Sumian stroked his beard and replied softly, "Brother Changxi was a friend to our Xuanmiao Temple for many years. We cannot simply stand by. However, the Profound Peak Gate's territory is vast, and covetous wolves lurk on all four of its borders. I fear our two families alone cannot protect it all. We must be prepared to cede some land. The lives of our disciples are what matter most."

The Profound Peak Gate's territory was centered around Shanji and their own mountain sect, with their influence extending to the wilderness around Lake Xian. Sumian's first instinct was to give up ground. Li Ximing had to ask, "Senior, what exactly are you suggesting?"

Sumian shook his head. "Zhaojing, rest assured. Our Xuanmiao Temple cultivators are already on their way to garrison the Lake Xian area. After all, the lake is part of our heartlands, and we cannot allow turmoil there. As for the wilderness to the west... I'm afraid our reach is too short."

The Li Clan and the Xuanmiao Temple perfectly bracketed the Profound Peak Gate, bordering them at the wilderness and Lake Xian, respectively. The implications of Sumian's words were instantly clear to Li Ximing. 'So that's how it is... The Xuanmiao Temple will absorb the Profound Peak Gate's influence over Lake Xian, and they're leaving the wilderness for my family to handle.'

It seemed like an even split, with each taking a border, but it was anything but! Not only did the Li Clan share a long border with the White Ye, but even a fool like Yehui knew of the Xuanmiao Temple's long-standing neutrality. He would only have to deal with the Li Clan.

'The Xuanmiao Temple's "defense" is just an excuse to swallow up the territory around Lake Xian!'

As a fellow Purple Mansion cultivator, how could Li Ximing not see through the ploy? His brow furrowed instantly. But Sumian's tone remained firm as he continued, "Zhaojing, do not worry. I will go and speak with Yehui personally. Out of respect for Brother Changxi, whose body is not yet cold, he won't let things escalate too drastically. If a real crisis occurs, I promise I will not stand idly by."

Sumian's meaning was clear: the Li Clan would face the Immortal Sect alone. The Xuanmiao Temple was unwilling to send its people to offend Yehui. However, if it came to a battle between Purple Mansion cultivators, Sumian was at least willing to mediate. Li Ximing listened in silence as Sumian turned to Kong Guxi. "Your sect's mountain is right next to Lake Xian. If you face any difficulties, or if any of your disciples are injured, send them over at once. The Xuanmiao Temple will not ignore their plight."

"The same goes for Moongaze Lake."

Li Ximing felt a headache coming on. Fortunately, Kong Guxi finally spoke up, his voice respectful. "Daoist Master, before our ancestor passed, he instructed this junior to follow Daoist Master Zhaojing's arrangements in all matters. We await your command."

Sumian nodded. Li Ximing had long understood the way these Purple Mansion Daoist Masters operated. They might appear benevolent and charitable, but they would never sacrifice their own strength to save another's. They had made grand promises while Changxi was alive, but now that he was dead, they would swallow up their share of the benefits, and any further action would depend entirely on their conscience. In that regard, Sumian was already far better than Xuanyi.

But Li Ximing couldn't afford to linger. Bidding a quick farewell, he tore open the Great Void and pulled Kong Guxi through the rift, traveling at incredible speed. "What are the Profound Peak Gate's defensive arrangements?" he asked as they moved. "Don't leave anyone at Lake Xian. Move all your forces to guard the wilderness."

Kong Guxi had managed to regain some composure. "Daoist Master, our ancestor gave instructions for our defenses before he passed. We currently have three early-stage, one mid-stage, and one late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator from our direct lineage, along with nine guest elders, all stationed on the riverbank in the wilderness. Lake Xian has been left completely undefended."

'Changxi really had planned ahead,' Li Ximing thought, relieved. 'Otherwise, he wouldn't have said what he did to me.' Fourteen Foundation Establishment cultivators, while lacking any truly exceptional individuals, represented the core strength of an entire immortal clan. They wouldn't be broken through easily. He then asked about the Profound Peak Gate's single most capable warrior: "Where is Fuyuezi?"

"Guarding the wilderness," Kong Guxi replied.

The Li Clan's main force was stationed on the eastern coast, perfectly positioned to reinforce the wilderness to the northeast or Funan to the northwest. And just a few days prior, Li Xizhi had secretly recalled Li Wushao and Li Qiyun, who were now both on the eastern coast as well.

In the time it took to exchange a few sentences, they arrived at the border of the wilderness. Li Ximing prepared to drop him off, giving one last order. "The Purple Mansion Daoist Master of Mount Jingyi is indisposed, but he must have disciples. Doesn't your clan have someone studying under him? Have that person invite a few of his martial brothers to lend their aid!"

Kong Guxi nodded hastily. "I will prepare generous gifts at once and send someone to Mount Jingyi. I'll have my cousin ask for assistance."

...

Baijiang Creek.

For the past year and a half, the Midong region could only be described as superficially stable. The prominent local clans were well-informed and knew something of the Kong family's situation, leading to widespread unease. They showed little interest in the stipends offered by the Li Clan, merely going through the motions.

On Hongfu Peak, lights burned brightly as cultivators hurried in and out. A young man with eyes like polished lacquer sat in the main seat, six tokens floating at his waist. Old Man Qu bustled in from below. "My lord, the Northern Brocade River King's messenger has arrived. He reports movement in the White Ye territory."

Among the Li Clan's Foundation Establishment cultivators, Li Chenghui was the most cautious. He had arranged for the Northern Brocade River King's men to stay on a side peak, changing out their communication jades monthly to ensure the timely delivery of news. After all, it only took the messenger a half-hour to fly over, and in a rebellious region like this, relying on a tiered notification system was just asking for trouble.

The moment the message arrived, Li Chenghui shot to his feet. He had just received word of geological shifts in the Profound Peak Gate's territory when Ying Hebai's news came in. His voice was grim. "Daoist Master Changxi has fallen. Get Ding Weizeng. All Foundation Establishment cultivators are to pull back immediately. Do not retreat via Hongfu Peak."

Since no word had come from Li Zhouwei, and no reinforcements were coming from the clan, Hongfu Peak was indefensible. Midong had never been a true strategic priority for the Li Clan; besides the land itself, it held little of value. Everything that could be moved had already been transferred to Funan over the last two years.

And besides the land and the local clans, what was the most valuable thing in Midong?

The Grand Celestial Cloud-Gathering Array on Hongfu Peak, of course!

Li Chenghui had focused on three tasks over the years. First, he moved Midong's commoners—those unaffiliated with the powerful clans—to populate Funan, never touching the cultivators. Second, he appointed cultivators from the local clans to high positions, generously distributing the spirit fields that Wenhu of Midong had painstakingly converted from private to public ownership.

In less than two years, Midong had not only seen a portion of its population drain away, but the consolidation of spirit fields had reached an unprecedented level, and the Li Clan had profited handsomely from the resales.

His third task had been to map the region's spiritual veins, ley lines, and waterways, working overtime to copy the platform of the Grand Celestial Cloud-Gathering Array. Now, by taking the priceless array plate and destroying the formation, he would leave Hongfu Mountain defenseless—a paradise for rogue cultivators and local clans to fight over.

Without pausing, he walked outside, continuing his orders, "We don't have time to deal with them. These clans and rogue cultivators, who so righteously want to drive our Li Clan out, won't pass up this opportunity. Let them fight over it. When the Immortal Sect's forces arrive, they'll surely have to leave a few people behind to suppress them."

Qu Bushi followed him out and whispered, "The spiritual energy in Jiangbei is flourishing. We could excavate the ley lines and sever the spiritual veins... we could also fill in the waterways..."

Li Chenghui retrieved the array plate from its stone pedestal in the main hall. It was an incredibly complex disk, covered in patterns like woven silk. Hearing Qu Bushi's words, Li Chenghui immediately shot the idea down. "Are you trying to get yourself killed? This is Jiangbei, not the Eastern Sea. No one touches the land in Jiangbei. Not even a Purple Mansion Daoist Master would dare!"

Qu Bushi froze, realizing his mistake. He fell silent and retreated. The two made their way off the mountain. Fearing Ding Weizeng and the others hadn't received his orders, Li Chenghui crushed another communication jade as a reminder. Just as they crossed out of Midong's borders, a pillar of fire erupted from Hongfu Mountain. The grand array shattered, its brocaded clouds sinking and scattering like rain.

It was followed by dozens of streaks of spiritual light, all hesitantly ascending toward Hongfu Mountain. The local clans had clearly noticed. Li Chenghui, already several miles out of Midong, glanced back to the north with a hint of regret.

"Midong is a truly prosperous land. One day... if we have the chance to return, we will set things right and bring these clans to heel."

He sped away on a current of lightning. An incense stick's time later, he crossed into Funan. The contrast with Midong was stark: here, the villages were sparse but orderly, all under the protection of a pristine, glowing array. A woman flew out to meet him.

It was Li Minggong, dressed in red and holding the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, riding a plume of fire. Behind her was An Siwei, clad in jade armor and carrying a spear. Worry was etched on Li Minggong's face. "You've arrived just in time," she said. "I just received word. Guan Gongxiao, the head disciple of the Immortal Sect, is leading a force into the wilderness. The clan head has already gone ahead. They've likely engaged the enemy by now."

"Thankfully, you didn't try to defend Hongfu Mountain and have freed up your forces. I am needed to guard this position and cannot leave. Please, hurry and provide reinforcements."

Li Chenghui hadn't expected the enemy to strike so swiftly. "How many cultivators?" he asked grimly.

Li Minggong shook her head, her voice tinged with anxiety. "It's hard to know for sure... Guan Lingdie and Gongsun Bofan have both been spotted, along with several other well-known Foundation Establishment cultivators who were recalled from overseas."

Li Cheng processed the information instantly. "It seems this Guan Gongxiao has sent local turncoats like Song Yunbai and Wang He to attack Jiangbei, while his main force heads for the eastern coast. I'll head over now. Ding Weizeng is right behind me; please brief him when he arrives."

Without another moment's delay, Li Chenghui led his men eastward, vanishing over the horizon at top speed.

Li Minggong, tasked with defending Funan—a vital buffer for Moongaze Lake and arguably more important than the wilderness itself—could only watch him go.

A short while later, before Ding Weizeng's forces had even arrived, she felt a tremor in the ley lines to the east. But then, a golden radiance erupted in the northwest. A wave of dread washed over her. Riding her fire higher, she peered into the distance and saw streaks of light racing across the border, formations shattering, and a torrent of metallic energy surging into the sky.

Li Minggong knew at once that something was wrong. She summoned a Jade Court Guard. "Go to the clan immediately and request aid! Have several Foundation Establishment cultivators reinforce Funan. This is critical—do not delay!"

The guard hurried off. Li Minggong then crushed a communication jade. Her clan's senior had two spirit beasts on the eastern coast; they could arrive in fifteen minutes. Having taken these precautions, she felt a surge of confidence and immediately set off with An Siwei, riding the wind.

An Siwei looked toward the disturbance, his expression instantly tightening with tension. His father, An Zheyan, was stationed near that area. Though he was a good distance away and the old man was sharp, An Siwei couldn't help but surge forward.

'I never should have assigned him to that post!'

An Zheyan was getting on in years, so he'd been given the safest, most relaxed assignment. An Siwei had never anticipated a sudden attack from the northwest, which had now put his father in grave danger.

Fortunately, the old man had accumulated a good number of protective treasures over the years and was stationed slightly behind the border, not directly on it. It seemed he had managed to escape. As the two Foundation Establishment cultivators sped onward, straining their eyes, they saw the old man flying toward them, cloaked in a bloody light.

An Zheyan had always been completely bald, and now his beard and eyebrows were completely white. Back when Li Ximing first reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he had restored the severed limbs of An Zheyan, Li Qiuyang, and several other elders. Now, with all four limbs intact, he looked much healthier, though the lines on his face had deepened with age.

He came to a hurried stop before Li Minggong as the golden energy on the horizon flared even brighter. The old man coughed up a mouthful of blood and cried out in alarm, "My lady! Situ Mo, the master of the Golden Tang Gate... he's leading his cultivators... they've crossed the mountains!"

### Chapter 727: The Battle of the Golden Tang Gate

"The Golden Tang Gate."

The name alone was enough to make An Siwei’s expression change drastically. Li Mingguang hesitated for only a moment before taking out her jade pendant again and crushing it. She issued an order for all the Qi Refinement cultivators in the territory to retreat to the main peak of Funan.

"Withdraw everyone and hold the line with the formations," she commanded. "The harvest in Funan is already accounted for. Losing a few years of production is nothing. Situ Mo has powerful backers; he'll be smart enough not to touch the spirit veins."

Li Zhouwei had, in fact, already discussed the Golden Tang Gate with Li Mingguang and Li Chenghui, so this development was not a complete surprise.

Ever since the death of Situ Tang, the Golden Tang Gate had been on a steady decline from its peak as the number one sect in the State of Xu, boasting three Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. When the Li family had first risen to prominence, the reputation of the Golden Tang Gate’s young master still carried some weight. But even then, the sect was a hollow shell, its glory fading with each passing day.

After the Lixia Prefecture disaster and the death of Chi Wei, the sect’s sole remaining Purple Mansion cultivator, Situ Huo, had managed to provoke Xiao Chuting, a master of the Life Divine Ability. Terrified, he hadn’t dared to return to the lands of Jiangnan or Jiangbei. The Golden Tang Gate became a mere stage for the political games of the Azure Pond Sect and the Golden Feather Sect. The subsequent conflict between the north and south had hit them hard. To put it bluntly, the current Golden Tang Gate was weaker than even the Profound Peak Gate.

Their handful of guest elders were no threat, and they only had two newly advanced Foundation Establishment disciples. Their two most presentable cultivators were Situ Ku and Situ Biao, and Li Zhouwei had already captured Situ Ku. The sect could barely fill the seats in its own main hall.

The only one worth any caution was the sect master, Situ Mo.

As Li Mingguang led the retreat, she spoke in a low voice. "Situ Mo is from the same generation as my great-aunt. He is an incredibly suspicious and treacherous man. Years ago, my ancestor went to their Golden Pocket Island with his bow and killed a beast called the E'wu. The display of power frightened him so badly that he didn't dare leave the island for over twenty years. Only after he was certain my ancestor had left the Eastern Sea did he scurry back to the Golden Tang Gate."

"He never took a single step out of his sect until he heard the news of my ancestor's passing. It's only now that we’re hearing from him again... For him to cross the mountains now, he must have found some courage."

At the mention of the name, a nostalgic look appeared on the face of the nearby An Zheyan. He swallowed a medicinal pill and said, "This old man… I discussed him with Elder Xuanxuan once. His uncle is Ji Dengqi, who was quite a figure in his own right."

An Zheyan spoke with authority. As the former head of the An family, he had not only spoken with the old Ji family master but had also participated in the siege against Ji Dengqi. Li Mingguang, however, was unfamiliar with this history.

"Situ Mo was stuck at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm for decades," she said. "It's possible he cultivated some secret art. And the Golden Tang Gate's _Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra_ is a renowned Geng Metal cultivation method. The few of us will have a hard time holding him off. I've already sent a message requesting aid."

Just as her words fell, a brilliant, dark-red illusory light flashed from the main mountain of Funan. A tall man flew into the formation. His heroic eyebrows arched upwards as he cupped his hands and announced in a deep voice, "Weizeng pays his respects to you, my lady!"

"You're just in time!" Li Mingguang’s face lit up with joy.

But as she beckoned him over, a golden aura was already speeding toward them from the horizon. An Siwei frowned. "They're here already."

Ding Weizeng glanced over and, to everyone's surprise, recognized the newcomers. He pulled a bright red staff from his storage pouch and planted it on the ground. A layer of fine, intricate runes spread out from beneath his crimson armor, crawling up his arms to his palms. The runes in his pupils grew denser.

"It's the Situ family!" he declared.

It wasn't strange that Ding Weizeng recognized Situ Mo. His Ding family had once been a powerful clan in the Funan territory, and Fu Dou had frequent dealings with the Golden Tang Gate. As a capable general, Ding Weizeng had even been acquainted with Situ Ku.

He raised his staff. In the sky, a middle-aged man appeared, a golden ring in his hand. He had a longish face and thin eyebrows, and his feather-adorned robes were embroidered with rhombus patterns and hung with glittering golden hooks and rings. He stood before their formation with his hands behind his back.

This was undoubtedly Situ Mo. Behind him stood his Foundation Establishment guest elders, and beside him was the elderly Situ Biao, who bore a slight resemblance to the Situ Ku held in their dungeon. Without a single word of prelude, Situ Mo gave a simple command.

"Attack!"

In an instant, a torrent of spiritual light rained down, hammering against the grand formation with a deafening clang. The faces of the Qi Refinement cultivators on the formation platform turned pale. An Siwei, holding the formation disc, staggered back a step, his own expression grim.

The formation on Funan's main mountain was top-tier for Qi Refinement cultivators, but it could never withstand an assault from multiple Foundation Establishment masters. If not for the fact that nearly every Qi Refinement cultivator in the Funan territory was present to share the burden, the formation would have shattered from that first blow.

But numbers alone were not enough to guarantee a defense—otherwise, there would be no need for Foundation Establishment-level formations. Even with ample spiritual qi, the array would break after two more hits. Ding Weizeng hurriedly flew out on the wind to buy time.

"Sect Master Situ," he called out, "why do you attack our Funan territory?"

Situ Mo raised an eyebrow and looked at him, drawing a golden blade from his waist. A sharp, golden aura immediately erupted, swirling around him like a white wave. "So, it's Weizeng," Situ Mo said in a placid tone. "You are also a cultivator of Funan. We are here to conquer this land. Why don't you surrender to my Golden Tang Gate? I can recommend you to the White Ye for further cultivation. Your contributions will be noted, and you'll have nothing to worry about. There is no need to die here."

Of course, the Golden Tang Gate wouldn't dare to recruit Ding Weizeng on its own; he had to use the name of the White Ye Immortal Sect. But Ding Weizeng knew where his loyalties lay—not only were his family members still on the lake, but he also remembered the immense kindness Li Ximing had shown him by seeking out four Daoist Masters just to heal a single injury. He refused, but as he did, he noticed Situ Mo's hands.

Situ Mo rested one hand on his blade while the other formed a complex seal within his robes. His ring finger crossed behind his middle finger to hook his index finger, while the others pressed together. A smile touched his lips as he whispered, "Go!"

A blade of golden light, sharp as a dagger, shot out from his sleeve. A piercing shriek filled the air as the golden aura descended. Ding Weizeng's reaction was swift. Gritting his teeth, he let out a great shout.

"Hah!"

The shout transformed mid-air into a tiger's roar that shook the forest, momentarily halting the golden blade. Ding Weizeng stared straight at Situ Mo. The sect master found his gaze locked, unable to look away. A powerful force slammed into him, making him stumble back a step, his vision filled with stars.

His retreat caused the golden blade in the air to slow for a fraction of a second, just enough for Ding Weizeng to dodge. But behind Situ Mo, the elderly Situ Biao, who knew his master's temperament well, was already attacking, swinging a golden hammer straight at him.

Instantly, all the golden aura in the sky converged on Ding Weizeng. Fortunately, a sheet of True Fire surged up from below. Li Mingguang's Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier had arrived. Countless red and white plumes of Pure Feather Li-Fire erupted with the flames, soaring into the sky to shield him.

"The Golden Tang Gate attacks our territory without provocation!" Li Mingguang shouted. "Do you wish to challenge the might of a Purple Mansion cultivator?"

Situ Mo and the Li family were long-standing enemies. He knew that the Li Clan would never let him off, regardless of whether he attacked or not. He was secretly hoping for a war to break out between the Li and the White Ye Immortal Sect so he could find a secure backer. Though inwardly delighted, his words were cautious. "You young woman! My Golden Tang Gate is acting on the orders of a Daoist Master from the White Ye Immortal Sect to take control of the Funan territory! What do you mean, 'attack'?"

As they spoke, the True Fire and the golden aura had already collided.

True Fire, one of the Fire Virtues, was the ultimate refiner of all things metal—it was precisely why Li Zhouwei had assigned Li Mingguang to defend this location. Amplified by the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, the fire, though weaker in terms of raw spiritual qi than the golden aura, was able to whittle it down continuously. The remaining golden aura that struck Ding Weizeng only produced a series of metallic clinks against his protective spiritual arts.

Situ Mo had already recovered. Drawing his blade, he commanded coldly, "Capture him, quickly!"

Led by Situ Biao, the six Foundation Establishment cultivators immediately surrounded Ding Weizeng, with one peeling off to intercept An Siwei. Situ Biao even produced a golden token that shone down, trapping Ding Weizeng in its light.

Though a skilled warrior, Ding Weizeng was only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment. He was no match for six opponents, especially with Situ Biao being his equal in cultivation. He immediately fell into a disadvantage, gritting his teeth and blocking desperately.

With Ding Weizeng in peril, Li Mingguang was also having a hard time against Situ Mo. His blade techniques suppressed her, and the corrosive golden aura he emitted spread like a mist, chilling her to the bone.

How could Li Mingguang, who had only been a Foundation Establishment cultivator for a few years, be a match for a veteran like Situ Mo? Fortunately, her True Fire countered his metal element. Relying on the flames from her Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, she managed to dissolve the golden aura, but she was forced to block Situ Mo's blade qi with the artifact itself, which rang out with loud clangs under the assault.

'The Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier was a gift from the Golden Feather Sect… it’s sturdy enough… It shouldn’t break right away…'

Li Mingguang had no time to worry about damaging her artifact. The golden blade that had missed Ding Weizeng had already circled back and was stabbing toward her back.

Before the blade arrived, a cold dread prickled her skin. Li Mingguang spat a stream of fire from her lips, barely forcing back the blade in front of her, and spun her brazier around to block the incoming attack.

_Clang!_

A soft chime echoed as a shower of sparks exploded in mid-air. The golden light retreated at high speed. Li Mingguang let out a muffled grunt; a wound so deep it revealed bone had been carved into her arm.

The Golden Tang Gate might be lacking in talent, but their techniques were formidable. This Golden Radiance Blade technique was simply too fast. Even though she had turned her artifact to block, its edge had only barely caught the blade, deflecting it to slice her arm.

A cold, metallic poison immediately tried to invade her meridians, but Li Mingguang's True Fire foundation surged, easily dissolving it. She looked up to see Situ Mo forming another seal, a brilliant golden light gathering in his hands.

'He's no ordinary cultivator…'

She had been injured after just a few exchanges. If not for her True Fire's advantage over metal, her condition would be far worse. Realizing the gap between herself and these veterans, she quickly retreated, activating several protective talismans.

But in the space of a breath, Situ Mo's spell was complete. He made a throwing motion, and countless golden needles flew from his hand, so dense they hurt the eyes. They swarmed toward her like a flock of birds returning to the forest, aiming for every part of her body.

'I can't hold back anymore…'

Li Mingguang knew she was outmatched. Her cultivation and techniques were far inferior to these old masters. The incoming needles were lethal. She had no choice but to take an object from her sleeve and toss it into the air.

An eight-paneled folding screen materialized in the sky, each panel depicting a different scene. A cyan light flickered across its surface, and a dark, cyan radiance flowed out, falling like rain.

The Chongming Profound Insight Screen!

The screen was imbued with the heritage of the Green Pine Dao Lineage, making it highly effective against the sects of Jiangnan. Coincidentally, the White Ye Immortal Sect was not of that lineage, so Li Zhouwei had not taken it with him.

He had left it with Li Mingguang for one specific reason: the screen's 'Heavy Abyssal Gale' ability—the power of the Deep Abyss—was the perfect counter to the Golden Tang Gate!

The ancient artifact unleashed its might. As the dark cyan radiance washed down, the thousands of golden needles seemed to be caught by the throat, freezing motionless in mid-air.

The cyan light rippled outwards, and incredibly, it forced two more hidden, squirming golden blades out of thin air nearby. They struggled fiercely, but were held fast. Li Mingguang stared for a second, a cold sweat breaking out on her brow.

'There was another one! If I didn't have this artifact, the blades would have struck one after another. I would have been killed!'

She had only reached the Foundation Establishment Realm a few years ago and lacked combat experience; otherwise, she wouldn't have found herself in such a difficult position. Having saved her life with the artifact, she saw that Situ Mo’s expression had finally turned sour. He glanced at the screen.

"The Great Wind of Abyss? What a domineering artifact…"

While Situ Mo and Li Mingguang’s clash had paused, Ding Weizeng was having a much harder time. Dark red spiritual qi surged around him as his long staff parried two golden spears. His eyes had turned blood-red. The gaze of the Palace-Yang Tiger was a potent weapon; none of his opponents dared to meet his eyes, resorting to bombarding him with ranged attacks instead.

With just his spiritual body, he was holding back six people. Situ Biao had taken a blow from the staff earlier, and his face was still pale. Situ Mo narrowed his eyes.

"What a fine Palace-Yang Tiger."

Seeing Ding Weizeng’s desperate situation, Li Mingguang immediately activated the screen's 'Dao Metal' protective power. She broke free from the cloud of golden needles and rushed to his aid.

Li Mingguang and Ding Weizeng together, True Fire and the Hengzhu Rite, plus an ancient artifact that specifically countered the Golden Tang Gate—this was no laughing matter! Situ Mo was the first to react, drawing his blade to block her. "Don't let them join forces!" he shouted coldly.

His reaction was lightning fast, intercepting Li Mingguang just in time. At his shout, Ding Weizeng also began to move. The Golden Tang Gate's guest elders exchanged a look and shouted in unison.

"Bind him!"

Several streams of golden light erupted from their hands. Situ Biao once again used his golden token, releasing a restrictive light. In an instant, Ding Weizeng was assailed by restraining forces from above, below, and all sides.

"Hahahahaha!"

This only made Ding Weizeng laugh. His dark red eyes shifted. He held one hand out in front of him and chanted:

"The crimson tiger flees, the monarch leaves his court, fasting in repentance, and granting amnesty to all under heaven!"

His figure dissolved into a dark red gust of wind, howling out from the surrounding barriers as if they didn't exist. The wind circled once in the sky before landing beside Li Mingguang, reforming into Ding Weizeng.

For a moment, everyone from the Golden Tang Gate was stunned. It had happened too fast. Even Situ Mo was momentarily dazed. Then, he and Li Mingguang understood at the same time.

'The Palace-Yang Tiger excels at combat, escaping confinement, shattering cages, overcoming adversity, and striking foes with its gaze.'

The encirclement by Situ Biao and the others had created the very concept of a 'cage,' and their combined efforts to stop him formed a 'confinement.' For the Palace-Yang Tiger, which overcame adversity, this was the perfect catalyst for its immortal foundation's divine ability to activate.

The situation had reversed dramatically. Situ Biao's face turned white as a sheet. Ding Weizeng's laughter continued, but Li Mingguang's expression suddenly changed. She desperately recalled the Chongming Profound Insight Screen.

'Siwei!'

While the main battle had raged in the sky, An Siwei was still fighting alone against a single guest elder from the Golden Tang Gate!

She was a step too late. Situ Mo’s reactions were terrifyingly fast. He was already stepping on a current of golden qi, appearing beside An Siwei. Before the Chongming Profound Insight Screen could arrive, he struck An Siwei with his palm, sending him flying and spitting blood toward the Golden Tang Gate's group. With time to spare, Situ Mo even turned to block the incoming artifact, his eyes cold and defiant.

An Siwei's immortal foundation was ordinary, and his cultivation methods were average. He had been completely focused on his opponent. How could he have possibly reacted? In the blink of an eye, he was caught in the six-man encirclement, completely immobilized.

# Chapter 728: Battle in the Wilderness

Situ Mo was indeed no ordinary opponent. Suppressed by True Fire and targeted by the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, he still managed to seize a fleeting opportunity when Ding Weizeng escaped, turning the tide of the battle. Li Minggong and his companion couldn't rush to the rescue in time. An Siwei only fought back three moves before he was severely wounded and captured. The next moment, Situ Mo's cold voice emerged.

"Attack the mountain!" he commanded.

Situ Mo unfastened a seal from his waist and tossed it into the air. It transformed into a stone mountain that pressed down upon the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. Li Minggong only needed a single glance to recognize the familiar mountain; it was likely a gift from the Profound Peak Gate to the Golden Tang Gate during a period of close relations. This Dharma Artifact was of a high grade. The moment it pressed down, Li Minggong's spiritual qi consumption doubled. Situ Mo stood before the two of them with his blade drawn, while five people behind him descended on the wind to attack the main peak of Funan.

Situ Mo's combat experience was far superior to his opponents. Although he couldn't defeat them, the mountain beneath their feet couldn't escape either. He held his ground, defending rather than attacking, and used his Dharma Artifact to fight the two opponents at once, holding back Li Minggong and Ding Weizeng. A great crash echoed.

"BOOM!"

The great formation beneath their feet shattered in just two rounds. The Li Clan cultivators were exposed like shivering sheep before the Foundation Establishment cultivators. Li Minggong's pupils widened slightly. Situ Mo had already captured the severely wounded An Siwei and, striking while the iron was hot, shouted, "Li Minggong! The Floating Cloud Territory cannot be held! I will release this man. Lead your people and retreat across the river! I swear I will not pursue!"

Li Minggong remained unshaken, her Dharma Artifact's brilliance intensifying. An Siwei, however, gritted his teeth, his face flushing crimson, causing Ding Weizeng and Situ Mo to change their expressions simultaneously.

"He's throwing his life away!"

Situ Mo, from a prestigious lineage, instantly saw that An Siwei was preparing a desperate attack. A golden flash of light burst from his eyes, hitting An Siwei's forehead, and he quickly dispersed his spiritual qi. But in that single instant of delay, Situ Mo felt a powerful force. His robes lit up on their own, and he felt as if he had been struck by something, his vision spinning. He was rapidly thrown backward, almost spitting up a mouthful of blood. Yet his will was tougher than an ordinary person's. Despite this sudden, unexpected attack, he did not release his hold on his technique. He pulled An Siwei to a halt and looked closer, seeing that another person had appeared in his original spot.

This was a young man in a multi-colored feathered robe. His face was slightly round, and his eyes were clear, but the dense orange feathers at his temples revealed him to be a demon.

"Dawn Rayfish?" he muttered, slightly stunned.

Several figures appeared on Funan's main peak. His own people had been forced back and were gathering around him. Situ Mo tossed the captured person to a subordinate, then suddenly leaned backward, and a dark shadow became visible, sweeping past his chin and leaving a dark red trail of blood.

"You shameless bastard with no father or mother!"

The Hooked Serpent's vertical pupil emerged from the shadow. Li Wushao, holding two black swords, was already lunging at his sides. Situ Mo's feathered robes shook, and he drifted back a few steps, evading the attack. Golden energy surged throughout his body, flowing from his robes and into his limbs, making his long blade glow brightly.

Beneath them, the enormous white ape in its true form and the elusive Li Chenghuai were battling with the Golden Tang Gate cultivators. In the Floating Cloud Territory, spiritual energy fluctuated as True Fire and Geng Metal clashed, disturbing the spiritual aura of the area. The mortals below stumbled into the woods, huddling on the ground and trembling.

---

In the wilderness, compared to the extreme chaos of the Floating Cloud Territory, the area was more vast and seemed quieter. The golden-eyed man sat imperiously in the Profound Light, in a standoff with several figures on the river before him.

The Capital immortals Dao cultivators in front of him were shrouded in a faint gray mist. Above their heads floated a brown stone stele, covered in dense, intricate patterns. The person at the head was dressed in a black Daoist robe with a silk sash tied at his waist. The front of his robe was a stark silver-white, and there were black markings painted on both of his cheeks. His attire, while strange, held a peculiar kind of aesthetic beauty. He had high brows and deep-set eyes, and he was none other than Guan Gongxiao, the foremost disciple of the Capital immortals Dao. He was at the late Foundation Establishment stage. Although he hadn't been in the late stage for long, he was extremely proficient in techniques, and could be called the foremost among his Daoist peers.

The wilderness was long, and it was the home ground of the Profound Peak Gate and the Li Clan. Their communication and defensive capabilities were exceptional. Li Zhouwei had not appeared at the riverside at first, and even the outermost defensive forces were sparse, making the area seem somewhat empty. But Guan Gongxiao was no fool. He didn't rush deep into the territory all at once, but first sent people to attack a few strategic mountain peaks to ensure a means of advance and retreat. So Li Zhouwei came forward to block him, and they held a stalemate at the riverside.

The wilderness was a vast territory, yet Li Zhouwei was unwilling to let the Profound Peak Gate's forces scatter. Most of the territory only had Qi Refining and Embryonic Breathing cultivators, with Foundation Establishment cultivators only stationed at key locations. Here, however, was the Profound Peak Gate's main force: nine of the Kong Clan's fifteen Foundation Establishment cultivators were here, led by Fu Yuezi. The remaining five were led by Li Zhouwei and included Cui Jueyin, Li Wen, Qu Bushi, and Miaoshui. Adding the people from the Kong Clan and the still-unarrived Li Chenghui, there were fifteen in total.

Both sides had sufficient numbers. The Capital immortals Dao side, with Guan Gongxiao, Gongsun Bofan, and others, had even more, a total of eighteen. It could be called the largest battle since the North-South conflict.

Li Zhouwei was waiting for Li Chenghui, and Guan Gongxiao was waiting for the Golden Tang Gate. After a brief stalemate, the aura in the east shifted, and baleful energy soared into the sky. Kong Guxi's expression changed dramatically.

Li Zhouwei didn't even need to ask; he knew the Profound Peak Gate's outlying areas had fallen. The Capital immortals Dao wouldn't have put all their people here, so a considerable number of guest cultivators must have infiltrated from various directions.

'The wilderness is a vast and permeable territory. My clan alone cannot possibly defend it all. We should retreat and focus on defending against the main force.'

The tension was growing more intense. The jade pendant on Li Zhouwei's waist grew warm, letting him know that Li Chenghui was just a few breaths away. The Profound Light in his brow flashed. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light surged forth, piercing across the river. The Capital immortals Dao immediately sent a stone stele flying to block the radiant light.

Without a single unnecessary word, the static scene erupted into motion. Spiritual qi and brilliant light rose everywhere. Li Zhouwei charged forward with his halberd. The first to meet him was none other than the straw-cloaked Gongsun Bofan!

With a resolute look in his eyes, he drew his blade. In contrast, Guan Lingdie stepped back, unwilling to engage him, and instead went after the "soft target," Qu Bushi. It was clear that their past clashes had left a significant impression on her. Now, with the possibility of life-or-death peril in the great battle, she immediately retreated.

Gongsun Bofan wanted to meet the charge, but Cui Jueyin didn't give him the chance. The elegant, scholarly man scoffed, and Steps of Radiance appeared beneath his feet, pulling Gongsun Bofan into them.

With Gongsun Bofan blocked, Guan Gongxiao's gaze shot over like an arrow. The Daoist book in his hand flipped open on its own, facing the incoming halberd. A vast expanse of river water surged from the book, swirling and dancing at his feet.

Li Zhouwei's Profound Light shone down, piercing into Guan Gongxiao's eyes. The latter only saw a man with golden pupils and nothing particularly extraordinary, and a cold smirk appeared on his face.

"Let's see just how mighty this White Qilin really is!"

# Chapter 729: The Halberd's First Display of Might

Guan Gongxiao was Yehui’s personal disciple, and he cultivated the foundation his master was most proud of: Sorrowful Southern Water. He seemed more aligned with the Water Virtue than the Capital Guard. Standing in the gray, murky water, he faced the celestial light descending from above and flicked his hand through a series of seals.

"Go."

He was clearly prepared. A bronze mirror flew from his sleeve and swallowed the celestial light whole. With his other hand, he unleashed a sheet of talismans.

The talismans shimmered with white shadows, accompanied by the profound, mystical sound of chanting sutras. A gust of wind and sand then swept from Guan Gongxiao's sleeve, merging with the white shadows as it rushed forward.

Though the sandstorm appeared unremarkable, it cut through the Bright Yang celestial light with unstoppable momentum. Li Zhouwei recognized it at a glance as a technique from the Radiant Essence lineage, specifically designed to counter his own. He immediately formed a new seal.

"Celestial Art Unleashed, Yang-Li Execution Fire!"

Five different flames—ochre, pale yellow, bright gold, crimson, and vermilion—roared downward in a towering inferno, instantly suppressing the sandstorm. In the next moment, Li Zhouwei had already charged to the front lines, his halberd swinging in a wide arc.

Celestial light blazed upon Li Zhouwei's halberd, wreathed in swirling umbral shadows. The technique he cultivated was the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts, an art that used the destruction of sects and clans to temper the halberd itself. He had first gained an elementary mastery of it during his Embryonic Breathing phase when he annihilated the royal court of the Mountain Yue—a minor power composed of Qi Refining cultivators. Later, after he reached Foundation Establishment and wiped out the Dense Cloud Cave, a major power in Jiangbei, his mastery of the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts had soared.

Now, umbral shadows leaped from the weapon, filled with the phantom cries of battle. Before the halberd even arrived, the force of its swing sent the waters of the White Waterfall River churning violently. Guan Gongxiao was a pure arcanist, and his years of fighting in the Eastern Sea had taught him never to let a martial cultivator get close. He pressed two fingers to his lips and blew hard.

His breath instantly formed a solid barrier of white light. The halberd swept past, gently pushed aside by the flexible ward. Guan Gongxiao had used this spell to deal with countless cultivators and thought little of it, but a sudden chill ran down his spine. He caught a glimpse of a dark, flickering flame that had appeared on Li Zhouwei's hand.

_Clang!_

He had no time to ponder it. Li Zhouwei’s next attack was faster and fiercer, a thrust aimed directly at his face. Guan Gongxiao had no choice but to block with another spell. As he pushed the attack away, a second umbral flame ignited around Li Zhouwei. A sense of dread washed over him.

As a personal disciple of a Purple Mansion master, Guan Gongxiao had witnessed a vast array of techniques. Seeing Li Zhouwei's umbral flames, he guessed they were some kind of stacking self-enhancement spell. He knew he couldn't allow his opponent to keep building momentum.

He immediately activated his artifact. A black bell materialized behind him and chimed, then turned to project a gray screen that surged forward. Li Zhouwei countered by unleashing a torrent of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light from between his brows.

Although the black bell looked strange, it was a genuine Capital Guard artifact. Unlike the flimsy equipment of the cultivators Li Zhouwei had faced before, it didn't shatter on impact. The bell let out a mournful cry as Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light slammed into it, but it held firm.

Guan Gongxiao seized the opportunity to retreat. He took two steps back and activated his Sorrowful Southern Water immortal foundation, his body dissolving into magical water that merged with the gray torrent pouring from the Daoist scripture in his hand. He reappeared a short distance away.

Having created some distance, Guan Gongxiao began forming a new seal while covertly studying the umbral flames on his opponent. They hadn't vanished; they continued to burn brightly. He frowned.

'I don't know what kind of art this is.'

The unknown was always the most terrifying. His retreat gave Li Zhouwei an opening. With a flick of his fingers, Li Zhouwei launched a beam of solar light, which erupted outward with a torrent of Li Fire.

The Sun's Resonant Parting Art!

This technique was fluid and adaptable, with no fixed form. Li Zhouwei used it to pin his opponent down while a small banner embroidered with a crimson sparrow flew up from the red and yellow flames at his feet, diving toward the gray water.

It was the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner! Guan Gongxiao's sandstorm had just been a spell, a rootless creation. And though Li Fire held no intrinsic advantage over Radiant Essence, it was quickly worn down and the banner now flew free.

Li Zhouwei timed it perfectly. His body transformed into a streak of celestial light, and he reappeared before Guan Gongxiao, his halberd thrusting forward to smash against the gray screen with a sharp crack.

_Clang!_

Guan Gongxiao's face paled. The feedback from the black bell told him just how immense the force behind that attack was. Previously, his spells had blunted the impact, but now, taking a direct hit, his spiritual energy plummeted. A chill crept into his heart.

'That halberd of his must be an ancient artifact…'

His gaze swept across the battlefield. His side had a clear advantage. The only competent fighters on the Li Clan and Profound Peak side were Fu Yuezi with his golden axe and that scholar-like figure. The rest were collapsing like scarecrows, many of them already wounded. He felt a wave of relief.

'I just need to stall him!'

In the brief moment that thought crossed his mind, his gray screen was struck three more times. Another umbral flame ignited on Li Zhouwei's body. Unaware of the shift in his own mentality, Guan Gongxiao began casting again.

Li Zhouwei saw the state of the battlefield as well. He glanced around, then pulled his halberd back. To Guan Gongxiao's shock, he ignored him completely and turned to strike at Gongsun Bofan.

Gongsun Bofan was a skilled bladesman, but as a rogue cultivator, he was no match for Cui Jueyin, a direct disciple from Chongzhou Island. Cui Jueyin was silently weaving around him with his Eternal Brightness Steps, casting spell after spell that left Gongsun Bofan disoriented and unable to advance or retreat.

Li Zhouwei's sudden attack made the bladesman’s face drain of color. Ignoring the backlash of spiritual energy that made him cough up blood, he spun around to defend himself, only for the gleaming halberd to swerve, causing his desperate parry to meet empty air. The awkward movement threw him further off balance, and Li Zhouwei easily pulled him into his attack range.

"He intends to fight us both!"

How could Guan Gongxiao not understand? Fury rose in his heart at the sheer audacity. The spell in his hands grew faster, more vicious. Cui Jueyin, however, read the situation and wisely retreated to help the beleaguered Profound Peak cultivators.

Gongsun Bofan lacked the backing of a powerful lineage. He clashed with Li Zhouwei, his long blade meeting the halberd several times. He saw the umbral flames growing more intense and felt a sense of unease. Guan Gongxiao, still in the middle of casting, had no time to warn him and could only manage a sharp shout.

"Halt!"

A burst of crimson light shot from his mouth. A solemn expression appeared on Li Zhouwei's face. He forcefully pulled his halberd back, silently channeling the Sun's Resonant Parting Art to form a celestial screen before him.

The crimson light was incredibly sharp. It paused for a fraction of a second against the celestial screen before shattering it. As Li Zhouwei blocked the attack with his halberd, he had a sudden realization.

'This crimson light is a profound technique from the Capital Guard Dao, and he'd been charging it for a while. I cast my Sun's Resonant Parting Art in an instant… yet it was able to slow it down. It seems the Supreme Yang Dao has a slight advantage over the Capital Guard Dao!'

He had used the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner before, and he knew the Capital Guard Dao was not weak against Li Fire. Therefore, the advantage must come from the solar aspect of his power. Li Zhouwei felt a surge of delight.

'This is a major discovery!'

Li Zhouwei had always been at a disadvantage when fighting cultivators from the Capital immortals Dao. The reputation of his Bright Yang Dao was so great that any cultivator with a decent heritage knew that Radiant Essence countered it. Guan Gongxiao had come prepared with his sandstorm and likely had other tricks up his sleeve.

The Capital Guard Dao, however, was ancient and obscure. Few cultivators even knew it existed, let alone its weaknesses. Now that he knew this, he had a way to fight back, whether with artifacts or spells.

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, a dull thud echoed. The Grand Ascension Halberd was sent flying high into the air. Li Zhouwei finally spat out a mouthful of blood, but the scales of the Yuane Armor on his chest flared with a brilliant light.

The Yuane Armor had been commissioned by Li Xuanfeng, forged by the full might of the Azure Pond Sect. Its first ability was to assist Li Zhouwei in teleporting with celestial light, enhancing his footwork to a phantom-like speed. His earlier teleportation was accomplished through a combination of the Flowing Sun Refraction art and the Yuane Armor.

Its second ability was to reinforce his spiritual energy and defend against spells. Except for techniques from the Radiant Essence lineage, all other incoming arts were evenly distributed across the armor's 6,200 scales, giving him extraordinary survivability.

This armor had been instrumental in his repeated escapes from Fu Dou.

Now, even after taking a direct hit from Guan Gongxiao's spell, he was only forced to cough up a mouthful of blood. The white blood transformed into a mist in mid-air, releasing the strange fragrance of peonies. Guan Gongxiao felt a secret relief seeing him injured, but then his eyes widened as a massive, dark mountain peak materialized in the sky.

"Someone from Profound Peak has fallen!"

Li Zhouwei realized it even faster, and he knew the situation was far worse than a single death. Two of their guest elders had been gravely wounded and forced to retreat. Their forces were down to twelve, and every single one was injured. Fu Yuezi and Cui Jueyin were each desperately holding off four opponents, barely maintaining the line.

Meanwhile, not a single cultivator from the Capital immortals Dao had suffered any serious injuries.

Just then, the sky crackled with thunder and silver lightning. Li Chenghui descended, locked in battle with two other cultivators, fighting as he advanced. Cui Jueyin glanced up and finally understood why he had been so late.

"The Capital immortals Dao had an ambush waiting!"

The two cultivators Li Chenghui was fighting were direct disciples, not mere guest elders. The pressure on him was immense; it was clear he couldn't break away to help. Li Zhouwei took in the scene with a sweep of his gaze, blocked incoming attacks from Guan Gongxiao and Gongsun Bofan, and sent his Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner streaking toward Guan Lingdie.

Seeing the aggressive flames bearing down on her, Guan Lingdie let out a scornful laugh. After a moment's hesitation, she turned to the people beside her.

"You, and you. Go stop him!"

The two direct disciples at her side were reluctant to face Li Zhouwei. As they hesitated, an old man named Guan Kan moved past them, intercepting Cui Jueyin to block the banner himself. Li Zhouwei watched this and shook his head.

'The Capital immortals Dao is an Eastern Sea power. Their people are strong, but their command structure is a chaotic mess.'

Guan Kan was a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. With him joining the fight, they finally managed to pin Li Zhouwei down. He rode a current of water as he sped forward, pulling a dozen interlinked rings of cold iron from his sleeve. The old man squinted, then lightly tossed the artifact. Taking advantage of the moment Li Zhouwei was blinded by Guan Gongxiao's Radiant Essence sandstorm, he chanted in a loud, clear voice:

"Light embraces ten thousand leagues, a verdant river topples a thousand peaks. By the power of Pit Water, bind all tribulations."

His immortal foundation, Grieving River Departure, activated at full power, resonating with the iron rings in the air. Beams of watery light converged within the dozen rings, which then unleashed chains of rushing river water that snaked toward Li Zhouwei.

Li Zhouwei retreated on a beam of celestial light, but the iron rings were no ordinary artifact. The water chains they produced were incredibly fast, wrapping themselves around his weapon.

'This old man is not simple… he must be an elder in the Capital immortals Dao.'

The water chains dispersed and reformed, impossible to shake off. Empowered by the spiritual energy of a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator and his immortal foundation, they had become his most difficult problem. With his Yuane Armor and the Sun's Resonant Parting Art, Li Zhouwei wasn't overly threatened by Guan Gongxiao or Gongsun Bofan, but he feared a soft power that could counter his hard strength.

He urgently pushed his spiritual energy, recalling the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner to fight Pit Water with Li Fire. Guan Gongxiao reacted instantly, his black bell about to fly out and intercept it, when a deep shout echoed through the air.

"Descend!"

'Another artifact?'

Guan Gongxiao was stunned for a second. A brilliant light shot into the sky, revealing billowing, colorful clouds. As the clouds parted, a celestial gate descended from the heavens, its corner towers looming high. The sight was so bright it made Guan Gongxiao's eyes ache. He cursed under his breath.

"I forgot about the Li Clan's suppressive immortal foundation!"

His own Capital immortals Dao had a similar foundation, Eastern Feather Mountain. Ultimately, it was just a specialized divine ability, but such foundations were incredibly powerful during the Foundation Establishment stage, providing a significant advantage. The two white corners of the gate slammed down squarely on his black bell artifact, which he had nurtured for years. The impact was so jarring it made him spit out a mouthful of blood.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

Li Zhouwei had achieved this through the Radiant Essence Scripture. In the past, he had thought his foundation was the Radiant Origin Pass and that it was quite different from Li Ximing's. It was only after Li Ximing reached the Purple Mansion realm that he understood the true name and power of his immortal foundation.

Li Zhouwei's figure materialized atop the celestial gate. Guan Kan's iron rings were also pinned down beneath it. The old man finally nodded, shook out his sleeves, and descended from the sky to fight with talismans instead.

Although Audience with the Celestial Gate was of an extremely high grade, it was fundamentally a suppressive foundation. Li Zhouwei's combat experience far surpassed that of the Li Ximing; he hadn't played his trump card at the start, keeping it hidden until the perfect moment.

Now, having suppressed his enemies' two most powerful artifacts in a single move, he recalled the freed Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner. Fighting under the brilliant light of the celestial gate, his own power resonating with his immortal foundation, he managed to hold his ground, though the battle remained perilous.

With Guan Kan's entry, he was now facing two late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators and one mid-stage cultivator. Both late-stage cultivators were direct disciples of their sect. In terms of opponent quality, it was a fight comparable to the one Tuoba Chongyuan had faced years ago.

However, Guan Kan was a step below the Li Xizhi of that time, while Guan Gongxiao was far stronger than Yu Wei had been, and Gongsun Bofan was leagues ahead of Quan Yi. Unfortunately, Li Zhouwei's cultivation was also a step below Tuoba Chongyuan's. While Tuoba had been able to suppress his three opponents, Li Zhouwei found himself fighting for his life, occasionally spitting out more of the white, fragrant blood.

But Foundation Establishment cultivators with true ability were not so easily killed. Those with powerful physical bodies or deep reserves of spiritual energy could fight against superior numbers for a short time. The trio could only force Li Zhouwei onto the defensive, slowly grinding him down. Yet, despite the seemingly inevitable outcome, Guan Gongxiao's brow furrowed deeper and deeper.

The reason was simple: the umbral flames surrounding Li Zhouwei were now soaring into the heavens.

"Don't meet his halberd head-on!"

Guan Gongxiao shouted sternly. Gongsun Bofan knew the warning was for him; he had been responsible for provoking half of those flames. But he was a bladesman—how else was he supposed to fight? He couldn't just let his opponent cut him down.

Gritting his teeth, he parried a few more blows, intending to fall back and let someone else take over. But Li Zhouwei pressed his attack, ignoring the other two to focus entirely on him. Finally, the umbral flames surged like a flowing river. A smile touched Li Zhouwei's blood-flecked lips. He took a light breath, and all the umbral flames streamed into his mouth and nose.

The Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts!

The unease in Guan Gongxiao's heart finally came to pass. Li Zhouwei pulled his halberd back. Then, from between lips stained with his own white blood, he exhaled the umbral energy. The moment it left his mouth, it expanded rapidly, showering the air with tiny sparks.

_BOOM!_

A dense torrent of umbral, shadowy flame erupted. Li Zhouwei turned his head, and his slightly savage eyes locked onto Guan Gongxiao, sending a chill deeper than any cold gaze ever could.

"He..."

In Guan Gongxiao's dark pupils, the reflection of Li Zhouwei's raging umbral flames danced. Two new arms, forged from the same shadowy fire, burst from Li Zhouwei's ribs, their hazy umbral light reaching for the sky.

The flames he had exhaled coalesced into two new halberds, which fell into the grasp of the shadowy arms. The arms slowly straightened, angling the halberds toward the ground. Guan Gongxiao's throat felt bone dry.

"What demonic art is this? ... Isn't his clan supposed to be on the righteous path? ... I thought _we_ were the rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea!"

# Chapter 730: Shouted to Death

Guan Gongxiao’s Capital immortals Dao was an orthodox lineage from the Eastern Sea, and he had read more demonic cultivation arts than the Li family had ever laid eyes on. He knew that the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts that Li Zhouwei practiced originated from the Liang Dynasty, and in truth, it was not far from a demonic art.

Just as the thought crossed his mind, a torrent of umbral flames rained down before him. The Grand Ascension Halberd lunged forward, and though the Profound Light radiating from its tip was blocked by his small mirror artifact, the surging black shadows were clearly not to be underestimated. He hastily formed a hand seal, releasing a sheet of white light.

This technique was called the Art of the Evening White Dispersion, designed specifically to counter cultivators who excelled in weapon arts. It could dissolve sharpness and repel Dharma artifacts. Guan Gongxiao had found it unfailingly effective in his past duels, and it had helped him fend off the halberd just moments before.

But this time, when the white light unfurled before the halberd, a plume of black flame erupted from the weapon’s shaft. The white light withered as if deflating. The Grand Ascension Halberd not only broke through but its Profound Light also escaped the mirror’s suppression, flaring with brilliant intensity.

_Clang!_

Caught off guard, Guan Gongxiao could only pull his Daoist tome closer. Its pages fluttered without a breeze, spewing forth streams of Pure Qi that barely managed to hold the halberd at bay. Guan Kan and Gongsun Bofan broke out in a cold sweat and rushed to his aid.

But Li Zhouwei had fought hard for this advantage and had no intention of relinquishing it. He pushed the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner to its limit, pressing down with five kinds of Li Fire. This, combined with the Profound Light streaming from his Celestial Gate, was enough to keep Guan Kan occupied.

Meanwhile, Gongsun Bofan, a master of the blade, had barely taken a step forward when a shadowy halberd materialized out of thin air and struck his weapon. The rain-cloaked swordsman exchanged more than a dozen blows in a heartbeat. He glanced up just in time to see the man wreathed in black flames press Guan Gongxiao so hard that his face turned crimson, nearly sending him tumbling from the sky.

Gongsun Bofan was arguably the pinnacle of what a rogue cultivator could achieve; even ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators from prominent clans were no match for him. Yet, he suffered from the common flaw of his kind—a lack of knowledge in spiritual arts and a shallow Daoist foundation. He had climbed to where he was on the strength of his blade alone. He could hold his own against anyone for a time, but he lacked any means to truly turn the tide of battle.

Perhaps after fifty or sixty years as a guest elder in the Capital immortals Dao, he might undergo a complete transformation and soar like a great roc. But for now, he was still just a rogue cultivator.

Seeing the state of the battlefield, Gongsun Bofan knew that even if he made it back, he would face severe reprimand. If anything happened to Guan Gongxiao, the consequences would be dire. Guan Kan would be fine, but what backing did he, Gongsun Bofan, have? He had to risk it all.

Without hesitation, he slapped his storage bag. Three crimson pills flew out and into his mouth. He bit his tongue and spat a mouthful of essence blood onto his blade, causing talismanic scripts to light up across its surface.

In that brief instant, Li Zhouwei’s eyes narrowed slightly. He chuckled.

“So it’s just an auxiliary artifact.”

Guan Gongxiao had always displayed that Daoist tome, making his opponents naturally wary of it as a hidden trump card. But Li Zhouwei’s surprise attack had pushed him to the brink, revealing the tome for what it was: a mere tool for assisting with casting and creating a water domain.

'That Black Bell must be his true primary artifact! And it’s already been sealed at the pass!'

With a twist and a flick, his halberd tore through the protection of the Daoist tome and drove straight onward. Profound Light surged from the Grand Ascension Halberd, so hot that it caused flames to erupt on Guan Gongxiao’s face with a sizzling sound.

'This is bad!'

Guan Kan was the most surprised of all. The old man had clearly not expected that the young master, in whom he had placed such high hopes, would be brought to the brink of death by a single halberd strike. He had still been observing, preparing a spell. Now, his eyes sharpened with horror as he began to channel his magic.

_Buzz!_

At that critical moment, a white halo burst from Guan Gongxiao’s body. A talisman on his chest flared to life, repelling the Profound Light and flames from his face and, with a resonant clang, blocking the Grand Ascension Halberd.

Li Zhouwei was not the least bit surprised. How could someone of Guan Gongxiao’s stature not possess life-saving treasures? He himself had three such items.

But he would not leave empty-handed. In a motion too swift to follow, the halberd slid upward and clamped down on the mirror artifact with a sharp clang. Though the talisman had saved Guan Gongxiao from injury, his Qi and blood were in turmoil, leaving him no chance to react.

The artifact struggled for a moment before the Grand Ascension Halberd ripped it away, slamming it down beneath the Celestial Gate, pinning it securely. Before Li Zhouwei could press his attack, he had to spin his halberd around to meet Gongsun Bofan, who had broken free from the shadow weapon and was charging in with murderous intent.

A deafening crash echoed as Li Zhouwei took a step back, slightly surprised. He knew this man was giving it his all. He met the long blade head-on with his halberd as two shadow weapons blurred into existence, striking from the flanks. Bolstered by the pills, Gongsun Bofan was fearless. Three shadows of water flood dragons surged from his back, each intercepting a shadow halberd. He roared, "Elder!"

Heeding the call, Guan Kan knew this was his chance. He unleashed the spell he had been gathering, which transformed in mid-air into a stream of the Essence of Pit Water that swam toward its target. But Li Zhouwei’s brow pulsed with Profound Light. The hairs on Gongsun Bofan’s body stood on end. Instead of blocking the Essence of Pit Water, Li Zhouwei was aiming his Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light at him!

“He—!”

Gongsun Bofan was fighting for his life to avoid a cold glare from Yehui, not to throw his life away! He immediately fell back, raising his blade to defend. And just as he did, Li Zhouwei’s Grand Ascension Halberd disengaged, smoothly and deliberately, moving to intercept the Essence of Pit Water.

'Why do something so convoluted?'

Gongsun Bofan’s blade was struck by the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. An immense force slammed into him. If not for his mastery of the blade and his defensive specialty, the blow would have knocked him from the sky. As it was, the back of his blade grew searing hot, and he almost coughed up blood. But his mind was filled with confusion.

The next moment, both he and Guan Kan understood.

As the Essence of Pit Water collided with the black flames on Li Zhouwei’s halberd, white steam billowed out. The stream of water instantly broke apart, retreated, and then dissipated further, scattering aimlessly toward the south. Guan Kan’s carefully prepared spell had vanished like snow under a blazing sun.

“How is that possible?”

Gongsun Bofan stared, dumbfounded. Guan Kan’s expression, however, had turned to one of utter horror. Guan Gongxiao, having just recovered, shouted, "Those black flames are the Profound Essence art from the Great Liang!"

The realization dawned on Guan Kan. He looked at Li Zhouwei, who was wreathed in churning black flames, and a deep sense of dread filled him.

'Profound Essence transforms Pit Water and negates Li Fire. After the era of Emperor Wu of Liang, it was refined to also subdue Converging Water and suppress Water Mansion… this is going to be difficult!'

Li Zhouwei himself was surprised by the power of his attack. The Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts he cultivated contained a latent law-breaking power, which was how he had caught Guan Gongxiao off guard and forced out his trump card. Now, he understood more.

'I only meant to use this art’s law-breaking properties, but the Profound Essence can actually destroy Pit Water. Excellent!'

Seizing this massive advantage, he immediately pulled his halberd back and, ignoring the crimson light Guan Gongxiao desperately shot at him, lunged toward Gongsun Bofan.

Everyone on the battlefield now understood what was happening—everyone except Gongsun Bofan, who was still lost in a fog of confusion. His shock at seeing Guan Kan’s spell inexplicably shattered had not yet faded when he saw the Grand Ascension Halberd coming for him. His shock turned to terror.

But Li Zhouwei was relentless. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light at his brow intensified, coalescing into a solid pillar of white light that locked Gongsun Bofan in place. If he tried to flee, the beam would undoubtedly blast his head apart.

With a sickening crunch, the Qi Refining-level, self-made rain-cape on Gongsun Bofan’s body tore like cloth. He spat a mouthful of blood that evaporated in mid-air. The three flood dragons were simultaneously severed by the halberd and then annihilated by the Profound Light, sending Gongsun Bofan plummeting from the sky like a bird with broken wings.

Umbral flames leaped from his falling body. Guan Kan’s eyelids twitched as he watched.

'That swordsman cultivates the path of the Jing Dragon King, which is also a Pit Water path. That one strike… he’s done for!'

Li Zhouwei had taken Guan Gongxiao’s spell head-on to incapacitate the other man. A muffled grunt escaped his lips, and his scales bristled. He pulled back his blood-streaked halberd, and his gaze swept over the battlefield. Guan Kan felt a chill run down his spine.

'He’s coming for me!'

Gongsun Bofan was as good as dead on the ground below. Now that Li Zhouwei knew his Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts countered Pit Water, he was naturally pressing his advantage. Swallowing the blood in his throat, he strode forward on a path of Profound Light, terrifying Guan Kan into abandoning the embattled Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner. With a flick of his sleeve, he cast out several dark shadows.

The shadows writhed and shifted before him, but Li Zhouwei didn't even give them a second look. Activating his Great Fissure Golden Pupils, he saw through the illusion with a single glance and took a step through the void, closing the distance instantly.

In this moment of crisis, Guan Gongxiao finally managed to catch up. His body, transformed into gray water, materialized within the currents summoned by Guan Kan. He produced a bronze coin from his sleeve and flicked it.

“Geng Metal grants its defense, protect my body!”

Though Guan Gongxiao was no match for Li Zhouwei, his reactions were swift. From their brief exchange, he had guessed that Li Zhouwei possessed a law-breaking ability. He didn't even bother with a spell this time, instead opting for a Metal-virtue Dharma artifact.

A large golden shield instantly materialized in the air. It took the full force of the flame-wreathed halberd, letting out a massive boom as its light dimmed, but the two men had managed to steady themselves.

Seeing the Metal-virtue artifact, Li Zhouwei immediately urged his Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner to descend. Li Fire rained down, seeking to smelt the metal, while he swept his halberd horizontally to dispel any incoming spells. The two direct disciples of the Capital immortals Dao found themselves in a bind.

The reason was simple: their primary artifacts were pinned beneath the Celestial Gate of the Radiant Pass, unable to be used, and Li Zhouwei’s halberd possessed the power to shatter their spells. Guan Gongxiao could still manage, but Guan Kan was finding it agonizingly difficult.

After a dozen more exchanges, the Metal-virtue artifact was already glowing cherry-red and sizzling, on the verge of collapse. Guan Gongxiao finally grit his teeth and said, "This demonic disciple specifically prepared a Profound Essence art to counter us. With Gongsun Bofan being so useless, we’ve ended up in this state. What should we do now?"

The Capital immortals Dao’s forces were far superior to the Li clan’s. Even without Elder Guan Kan, they still held a significant advantage on the overall battlefield. Guan Gongxiao’s only goal was to tie Li Zhouwei down; he was certain victory would eventually be theirs. He had absolutely no desire to call for more reinforcements.

Hearing this, Guan Kan understood the young master’s meaning. The life-or-death struggle was for him, the elder, to undertake, not Guan Gongxiao. In a solemn voice, he said, "Rest assured, Young Master. This old man still has strength to spare."

The old man drew several talismans from his sleeve, applying them to his ribs and cheeks. He bit his tongue and spat essence blood into his palm. Li Zhouwei, having just shattered the golden shield, fixed his golden eyes on him.

These old cultivators all had their own methods. Like Yu Yuwei and Jiang Huzi, they had little lifespan left and were not concerned about depleting their vitality or ruining their chances of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. They could not be underestimated. Li Zhouwei immediately moved his halberd, stabbing toward the spell forming in the elder's hands.

Guan Gongxiao’s Daoist tome flipped open. He channeled his Sorrowful Southern Water technique, unleashing a barrage of spells with all his might, hoping to slow the black-flamed weapon. As dharma power surged wildly, Guan Kan spat out a glob of the Essence of Pit Water and roared, "Four-Directional Pit-Metal Water Chains, bind him!"

Streams of light gray, watery chains erupted from his sleeves. They were soft and serpentine, and they shot forward with incredible speed, slithering up the halberd’s shaft and wrapping around Li Zhouwei’s arms. Li Zhouwei spun his weapon, shattering the chains, but they instantly reformed. Though their glow was slightly dimmer, they were quickly restored by the full force of Guan Kan's spiritual qi.

"This isn't a pure Pit Water technique…"

In a single breath, Guan Kan’s face grew haggard. Fueled by a desperate infusion of his life force, the water chains were both flexible and tenacious, binding the Grand Ascension Halberd tightly. Guan Gongxiao was overjoyed. His spells finally had an opening. He gathered his power and struck at Li Zhouwei's back.

_Clang!_

Li Zhouwei struggled fiercely, causing Guan Kan’s face to turn deathly pale. The blow landed squarely on his back, making him stagger. The water chains immediately slithered up the halberd, first ensnaring his two auxiliary arms.

The scene was spectacular: an old man, burning away his life essence, giving his all to bind a ferocious, flame-wreathed youth, while a robed young master suppressed him with spells from the side.

The Capital immortals Dao’s spells were not only powerful but also inflicted excruciating pain. After just a few exchanges, Li Zhouwei’s momentum began to wane, while Guan Kan had become visibly emaciated.

Finding Li Zhouwei’s armor incredibly tough, Guan Gongxiao changed tactics and began aiming for his face. While Li Zhouwei’s Dharma robes protected his whole body, his face was less covered. A strike split his forehead open, revealing the bone beneath. The old man cried out, "Just force his Immortal Foundation to defend him!"

If this dragged on any longer, he, Guan Kan, would be the first to die.

Their goal was never to kill Li Zhouwei, but to hold him in place. Once their two artifacts, the Pit-Metal Encircling Chain and the Capital immortals Dao Bell, were free, containing him would be no problem at all.

But as the old man spoke, his concentration wavered for a fraction of a second. Li Zhouwei, who had been silent all this time, suddenly erupted. His two arms strained, pulling the water chains taut. Guan Kan instinctively tried to pull back, but Li Zhouwei pulled and then released, lunging forward with shocking speed.

'No!'

With that one lunge, Li Zhouwei not only dodged Guan Gongxiao's crimson light but also appeared directly in front of Guan Kan. The old man saw a ghastly face of exposed bone and interwoven blood vessels fill his vision. Reacting with incredible speed, he threw up two water shields to block Li Zhouwei’s hands.

For a moment, everything seemed to slow down. He watched, eyes wide, as a dense layer of glittering white scales emerged on Li Zhouwei's neck. Those golden eyes were shot with blood from the extreme pain, and his two hands, pressed against the shields, made a creaking, groaning sound.

A final thought surfaced in Guan Kan’s mind.

"Is Li Zhouwei truly the reincarnation of a White Qilin!?"

The next instant, Li Zhouwei bared his teeth and let out a roar, as savage and violent as a beast’s.

“RAWR!”

Guan Kan didn’t even have time to close his eyes. The skin on his face was ripped away in shreds that flew off and vanished. Sinews, blood vessels, and cartilage were torn from his visage. In an instant, all the flesh on the old man's head was stripped away, flying in every direction.

Only a bare, white skull remained on his neck.

It was only then that a white protective shield sprang to life from his body. Guan Gongxiao, deafened and bleeding from his ears from the force of the roar, saw the skull glowing under the protective shield. He finally cast aside all pretense of dignity and shrieked, "Reinforcements! We need reinforcements now!"

# Chapter 731: A Scene of Devastation

The roar echoed like thunder, a low rumble that promised a storm. On the river, the battling cultivators paused almost as one.

The first to look up was Cui Jueyin.

He cultivated the Eternal Brightness Steps, the only art in the Bright Yang lineage capable of binding and restraining. Hailing from the main line of the Chongzhou Cui clan, who had studied the nature of Profound Light for centuries, his mastery of it surpassed even Li Zhouwei’s.

Brilliant light radiated from his sleeves—blinding, searing, pushing, and pulling. He had the four cultivators before him spinning in circles, unable to even touch the hem of his robes. He was the only member of the Li contingent who remained unscathed.

Cui Jueyin’s expression had been as placid as still water, but the roar struck him like a bolt from the blue. His control over the Profound Light nearly slipped. He shot his gaze upward, just in time to see the white scales bristling on Li Zhouwei’s neck.

‘What?’

A complex look washed over his face. He took an involuntary step forward, hesitating in mid-air. In that brief instant, his hold on the Profound Light loosened, and an enemy guest elder seized the opening. The man swept aside the light and lunged. Cui Jueyin reacted instantly, sidestepping to nullify the attack, but the fight had become much tighter, and he was once more locked in a bitter struggle.

Guan Kan's skull-headed Dharma Body faced forward as the earth beneath it split open. The river surged forth, its shallow, black Pit Water churning. Li Zhouwei’s eyes lingered on the body for a fraction of a second, and his scaled neck performed an unnervingly human-like swallowing motion.

In the next instant, he vanished. Ripples of Profound Light spread as he reappeared before Guan Gongxiao. The blood-red veins in his eyes and the white scales on his neck were gone, leaving only a face covered in jagged wounds.

Guan Gongxiao, however, was desperately channeling his arts. Crimson light flared as his cry for help continued to echo across the battlefield.

“Reinforcements! We need reinforcements now!!”

His plea threw the aggressive formation of the Capital immortals Dao into disarray. Cultivators from all directions—guest elders, clan elders, and core disciples alike—broke from their fights to rush to his aid. Li Zhouwei simply thrust his halberd, pouring all his energy into shattering the crimson light spewing from Guan Gongxiao. Just then, a deep voice boomed from the heavens:

“Where Yang culminates, the Six Thunders are born!”

It was Li Chenghui.

Li Chenghui was by no means weak, and his cultivation was substantial. He had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before Li Ximing’s seclusion and, after a decade, was ready to challenge the mid-stage. But a breakthrough required years of seclusion, and he had spent that time following Li Zhouwei, putting out fires all over their territory. There had been no time for himself.

Years before Li Ximing emerged, Li Chenghui was already on the verge of advancing. But as the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion pressed harder, he had funneled all his energy into mastering the Dao of Thunder.

The Capital immortals Dao, being a sect from the Eastern Sea, had clearly planned for him. The two disciples sent to intercept him cultivated the Dao of Pit Water and the Dao of True Fire, respectively—both highly resistant to lightning.

But now, silver-white lightning exploded with a searing radiance. Struck by the full force of his attack, his two opponents were forced to retreat.

Li Chenghui’s grasp of battlefield timing was sharp. Seizing the moment of distraction Li Zhouwei's shout had created, he fully unleashed his Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman. His figure shot out from the ensuing cascade of lightning, riding the thunder to appear before Guan Gongxiao in a flash.

The moment the thunder cracked, Li Zhouwei had already looked up. A beam of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light shot from between his brows. Guan Gongxiao had no time to worry about Li Chenghui; he brandished a talisman in one hand while forming a seal with the other. The sandstorm of Radiant Essence swirled up once more to meet the incoming beam.

Guan Gongxiao’s sandstorm was no match for Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, but it was enough to block it for a moment. What more could he ask for when his element was countered?

Though he had averted the immediate crisis, he had no time to relax. The space beside him warped as Li Chenghui opened his mouth and spat out a brilliant white pinpoint of light.

The Secret Art of the Purple Talisman’s Primal Light!

The point of light expanded in an instant. Guan Gongxiao barely had time to throw his head back and activate the talisman in his other hand when a massive explosion rocked the air.

_BOOM!_

A circular wave of white light pulsed outward, sweeping across the river. The water churned violently, and boulders tumbled from the cliffs. The white light swelled into a cascading waterfall of violet lightning that poured down from the sky.

Guan Gongxiao’s protective shield evaporated into nothingness under the deluge. The young master of the Capital immortals Dao was truly laden with treasures; he was only grazed by the stray bolts. But a halberd wreathed in roaring black flames was already upon him.

Gritting his teeth, Guan Gongxiao tore himself free from the lightning’s embrace. He activated his Sorrowful Southern Water art, dissolving into a spray of gray water that weaved through the currents of his own technique.

But he didn’t escape unscathed. The halberd clipped him, and a searing heat spread across his back, his Daoist robe sizzling. Knowing Li Zhouwei’s eye technique would see through his escape, he materialized by the riverbank and dashed toward the nearest person.

That person was a square-faced, large-nosed guest elder from the Capital immortals Dao, who was rushing to his aid. He held what looked to be a Wood Virtue art in his hands. Before he could reach his young master, a black-flamed halberd flew toward him.

The guest elder didn’t dare to receive the blow. His spell vanished as he took a step back, leaving Guan Gongxiao to face the attack alone. The young master was so furious he could have spit blood. Fortunately, Guan Lingdie, having fought Li Zhouwei before, was already watching. A white dart flew from her hand, striking the halberd with a clang and knocking its tip upward. Guan Gongxiao seized the chance to unleash his sandstorm, dispelling the Profound Light and allowing him to escape through the water.

Li Zhouwei finally retracted his halberd. Li Chenghui, meanwhile, drove back the two cultivators who had come to entangle him. At last, the chaotic battle on the river came to a standstill as the two sides gradually separated.

Guan Gongxiao, his face pale, materialized on the opposite bank. The Capital immortals Dao cultivators disengaged one by one and gathered by his side. They had the upper hand in numbers, so retreating was easy enough.

Killing Guan Gongxiao was impossible. With both Yehui and Li Ximing observing from the Great Void, neither side would dare to kill the other’s successor unless the conflict escalated to the Purple Mansion Realm.

The Li family had absolutely no desire for that to happen. Li Zhouwei had broken free from a three-man assault, crippled Gongsun Bofan, and killed Guan Kan, all while having strength to spare. The outcome of this battle was already sealed.

Though the Li family was outnumbered and in a precarious position, the Capital immortals Dao had no one left who could stop Li Zhouwei. A direct descendant of a Purple Mansion cultivator like him was a tiger among a flock of sheep when fighting guest elders; his presence could single-handedly turn the tide.

‘And that scholar of the Bright Yang Dao… he’s no simple character either… It seems our Dao wasn't the only one paying a high price these past few years. The Li Clan has been preparing in secret…’

With the immediate danger past, Guan Gongxiao’s mind settled. He swept his gaze over Li Zhouwei and the others, then felt the jade bead bracelet in his sleeve. Only three of the ten beads had shattered. A sliver of comfort returned to him.

‘At the very least, Shanji Prefecture and the Profound Peak Gate are out of the Li Clan’s hands now. We’ve secured seven locations, and our forces in the wilderness have crossed the river and established several footholds. It wasn’t a total loss.’

As he consoled himself, the battlefield fell utterly silent. Li Zhouwei stood with his halberd, his gaze fixed on him as the wound on his forehead slowly sealed itself. Li Chenghui and Cui Jueyin stood at his flanks. Guan Gongxiao felt a surge of pressure.

“You are truly skilled, Fellow Daoist,” he said, his voice tight.

With that final remark, he turned and rode a current of water away. The three Dharma Artifacts still pinned beneath the bright tower were beyond saving. He could only abandon them. Li Zhouwei watched him go, the wound on his forehead now completely gone.

Guan Gongxiao fled in disarray. The wind whistled past his ears, but the silence from his retinue was deafening. No one dared to speak. It was only after they were deep within their own territory that Guan Lingdie approached, her voice soft and consoling.

“Li Zhouwei is a man like Tu Longjian or Guo Shentong,” she murmured. “Favored by the heavens. It’s a cosmic injustice that only a Divine Ability can match. Don’t take it to heart, brother.”

“I understand,” Guan Gongxiao replied. Though he had lost both men and face, he was not discouraged. “Someone else will deal with him. We need only do our best.”

---

**Funan Territory.**

A golden mist of True Fire permeated the sky.

Li Minggong held the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier aloft, its pillar of fire holding the golden mist at bay. Beside her, the Chongming Profound Insight Screen shimmered with an iridescent green light, capturing the golden rays one by one.

The battle in the Funan Territory was nearing its end. Situ Mo, Master of the Golden Tang Gate, hovered high in the air, his diamond-patterned golden feather robe dancing in the wind. One hand was locked around Ding Weizeng’s longstaff. Golden Qi streamed down his cheeks, giving him a terrifying appearance.

His opponent, Ding Weizeng, was in a far more wretched state. His Dharma Body was covered in wounds from which dark red blood flowed freely. A massive gash on his abdomen revealed his internal organs, which pulsed with the faint light of Dharma Treasures.

Situ Mo glared at him, his eyes darting from side to side. That damned, foul-mouthed Hooked Serpent was still lurking somewhere nearby.

‘Time is running out…’

Situ Mo had lived up to his reputation; his methods were even more formidable than the Li family had anticipated. He had single-handedly fought both Ding Weizeng and the Hooked Serpent, steadily inflicting heavier and heavier wounds on Ding Weizeng… and that was with the Chongming Profound Insight Screen in the sky, a perfect counter to his flying swords and needles.

Although Ding Weizeng had been injured earlier while fighting six opponents, Situ Mo’s performance was still astonishing. Li Wushao, the Hooked Serpent, was no common demon; the two venomous stingers on his tail were enough to make anyone shudder.

And it was because of those stingers that Situ Mo was in his current predicament. Caught off guard earlier, he had been grazed on the chin. An icy chill had immediately spread down to his chest, and several pills had only temporarily suppressed it. One of his own idiots, unaware of the Hooked Serpent’s potency, had been struck and nearly fell from the sky.

‘Use your pig brain for once!’ Situ Mo fumed internally. ‘The Li family is a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan! The common Hooked Serpents from the sea floor… the white ones are alright, but the black ones are pathetic cowards. Even dragons find them unpalatable… Why would the Li family value one? This black serpent must be something else entirely!’

Having spent years in the Eastern Sea, Situ Mo was an expert on its creatures. He didn’t dare get hit again, which forced him to fight cautiously. With his favorite techniques countered, he found himself in a stalemate.

As for the other members of the Golden Tang Gate, Situ Biao was tied up with Li Minggong. Though he had the upper hand, Li Wushao’s occasional support strikes made him hesitant. Elder White Ape and Li Chenghuai were each engaged with their own opponents.

It was the Dawn Rayfish that proved to be the most surprisingly effective. Its noble lineage was apparent as it darted back and forth, single-handedly pinning down three cultivators. Its attacks weren’t life-threatening, but they were fast and vicious. It must have learned some advanced arts from Li Xizhi, as it was now capable of creating illusionary clones. The sky was filled with its phantoms, making it impossible to tell real from illusion.

As the battle dragged on, Situ Mo saw no sign of reinforcements from the Capital immortals Dao. He was beginning to grow anxious when he finally spotted several streaks of light approaching from the east. The cultivators from the Midong territory had arrived.

The leader was a round-faced woman. Li Minggong recognized her as Song Yunbai, and her heart sank.

‘This is trouble!’

Her forces were already stretched to their limit against the Golden Tang Gate. Below, a guest elder poisoned by the serpent was running rampant, sowing chaos and making a desperate situation even worse. If more enemies arrived, they would have no choice but to retreat.

As the woman drew closer, Situ Mo recognized her as well. While he was reverent toward the Capital immortals Dao and superficially polite to the Li family, he had no such courtesy for Song Yunbai.

“You girl!” he boomed. “What took the Midong forces so long?”

“What took so long?” Song Yunbai was not intimidated. Her tone was laced with sarcasm. “It’s not as if we could just march right in like you, Gate Master! Li Chenghui broke the grand array on Hongfu Mountain… the entire mountain is crawling with rogue cultivators and noble clans. The Daoist Master himself said to secure it, so we couldn’t afford to be careless.”

She smiled as she approached him. “If the Gate Master is dissatisfied… perhaps your clan’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivator might be so kind as to ask our Daoist Master about it?”

It wasn’t a great secret that the Golden Tang Gate’s Purple Mansion cultivator was a wanderer. Her words were polite and technically flawless, but the insult was sharp. Situ Mo’s face darkened, but now was not the time for an outburst.

“Then get over here and help!” he snarled.

Song Yunbai, however, simply bowed. “You misunderstand, Gate Master. Our Young Master used a secret talisman to retreat from the wilderness. I received the message and came to inform you.”

As soon as she spoke, the morale of the Li Clan’s cultivators surged. Song Yunbai flicked her sleeves, ignoring Situ Mo’s cold, ugly expression. After making a token gesture to cover his withdrawal, she prepared to ride the wind and depart. A knot of fury tightened in Situ Mo’s chest.

“Withdraw!” he finally choked out.

He instantly retracted his art, dodged a pair of stingers that shot out from nowhere, and retreated abruptly. On the battlefield, everyone was wounded; no one on the Li side dared to give chase.

After all, Li Minggong had been worn down by both Situ Mo and Situ Biao. She had consumed her elixirs and played all her trump cards. If either the Chongming Profound Insight Screen or the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier had been even a fraction weaker, she would have been incinerated into True Fire long ago. Pursuit was out of the question.

Ding Weizeng was the most severely injured, though his Dharma Body made his condition appear less dire. Elder White Ape and the Dawn Rayfish had sustained minor injuries. Li Wushao, the sneaky serpent, had been highly effective and had only suffered a few sword cuts.

Li Chenghuai, who had little combat ability, had faced a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. But he was equipped with the Supreme Feather Night-robe and a Night Ghost Secret Talisman from his parents. His opponent couldn’t even touch him and was instead harassed relentlessly by the night ghost. As a result, Li Chenghuai was in the best condition, having barely expended any spiritual energy.

The tension finally broke, and Li Minggong nearly collapsed. She waved Li Chenghuai over to handle the aftermath.

“They captured Elder Siwei…” she murmured, her voice filled with anguish. “I have no face to see the Old Master!”

Li Chenghuai offered a word of comfort and had Elder White Ape help her away. Below them, fires raged and black smoke billowed. The Funan territory, which had just begun to recover, was once again a scene of devastation, with the arrays on most of its mountain peaks shattered. It was a ruin.

# Chapter 732: News from Mount Jingyi

The battle in the wilderness had subsided.

Li Zhouwei was not lightly injured. After taking some medicine, he made a gentle gesture. The towering gatehouse in the sky vanished, transforming into a stream of light that flew back to him. Immediately, three streaks of light shot up from below in a desperate attempt to flee.

But if they could not escape during the height of battle, what chance did they have now that they had fallen into the hands of the Li Clan? Several cultivators closed in, seizing the three Dharma Artifacts and delivering them into Li Zhouwei's hands.

He stored them away and, enduring the pain, descended on a beam of light.

The Li Clan's foundation in the wilderness was shallow, with few garrisons to speak of. The Kong Clan, however, had been cultivating their presence here for a century. With the surge in spiritual Qi over the last decade, they had tightened their control and built numerous palaces.

They landed at the nearest one. Li Chenghui approached, his face etched with concern. Li Zhouwei let out a breath and asked, "How is everyone's condition?"

In the chaos of battle, no one could keep track of every detail unless a cultivator fell. Li Chenghui had already made a quick assessment.

"Only Miaoshui and Li Wen are seriously wounded," he answered concisely.

Everyone on the field was injured to some degree, so for Li Chenghui to single them out meant they were wounded to the point of incapacitation. Li Zhouwei still felt the urge to vomit blood.

"The Profound Peak Gate has a Pristine Water cultivator of the 'Spring's Echo' and a Wood Virtue cultivator of the 'Verdant Grove'," he said urgently. "Get them here to help."

Li Chenghui helped him settle into a hall before nodding.

"I'll go at once. The 'Spring's Echo' cultivator, Elder Bai, was killed in the fighting. Elder Sun of the 'Verdant Grove' is in better shape. I'll bring him."

As Li Chenghui departed, Li Zhouwei gritted his teeth and swallowed blood, forcing himself to sit on the main seat for a quarter of an hour. The stars in his vision slowly faded, and his sight returned to normal. He exhaled a plume of white mist, finally managing to bring his roiling Qi and blood under control. His complexion returned to normal, masking his weakness.

The white mist spread, filling the entire palace with the fragrance of peonies. A moment later, a group of people entered, led by Li Chenghui, to make their report.

Li Chenghui was largely unharmed, having expended nothing more than a Profound Thunder talisman. Behind him, Cui Jueyin stood with a lowered gaze, his expression respectful; he had merely consumed some spiritual qi.

The last of the group, Qu Bushi, had a severed arm and a weary expression, but it wasn't a serious concern. The old man was not much of a fighter, but he excelled at self-preservation. His 'Palace of Concealed Storage' was unique; he could simply find a few corpses to mend his severed arm and would be fine after some rest.

As for Miaoshui, who was not present, her injuries were severe. She had been struck down in the final moments of the battle, her body cut into three pieces as she plummeted from the sky. Qu Bushi had managed to find her and use a Wanling Flower to keep her alive. A moment's delay, and the cultivator from Jiangbei would have perished in the wilderness.

Although Miaoshui was a surrendered general from the Dense Cloud Cave, she had fought valiantly, perhaps in an attempt to atone for her past or to display her loyalty. She had nearly given her life. Li Zhouwei naturally couldn't ignore her sacrifice. "See that she is well cared for," he ordered. "I will ask a Daoist Master to save her."

The final casualty, Li Wen, possessed the Immortal Foundation 'Jade Court General'. Though not of a high grade, it was still a Dharma Body. He had only lost four fingers and suffered shattered bones throughout most of his body. He was immobilized but not in any mortal danger.

After hearing the report on his clan's cultivators, Li Zhouwei's mind began to settle. The Profound Peak Gate had served as the main force in the battle, and their guest elders—willingly or not—had been positioned to shield the Li Clan's own people. As a result, his clan's losses were not substantial.

'But this means nearly all the significant casualties were on the Profound Peak's side,' he mused. 'My family fought with all its strength, but the Profound Peak guest elders were practically used as sacrificial pawns. From a quick glance, I'd say they lost nearly five Foundation Establishment cultivators in that one battle...'

'Forget the guest elders... I imagine even the direct descendants of the Profound Peak Gate are terrified by now...'

After the arduous journey to reach Foundation Establishment, a cultivator could expect to be an honored guest anywhere they went. Who would willingly throw their life away after seeing so many peers perish in a single fight? The "Profound Peak" name wasn't a magic charm that inspired suicidal loyalty. The only reason they hadn't scattered at the start was the immense pressure from their own Purple Mansion Realm masters.

Knowing this full well, he deliberately inquired about the Profound Peak Gate.

The cultivator from the Profound Peak Gate, Elder Sun of the 'Verdant Grove', wore coarse hemp clothes and had an aged, desolate air about him. "To answer the Clan Head," he began, "we lost two early-stage and one mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. An early-stage direct descendant was crippled... We also killed one of the Capital immortals Dao's mid-stage elders and an early-stage cultivator, and... and..."

He seemed to find the next words difficult to say. "Two of our retainers were captured. One of them... surrendered before he was even out of our territory..."

It was a matter of shame, and it was unlikely the other captured retainer would hold out. Elder Sun fell silent.

Li Chenghui spoke up. "The remaining direct descendants are Kong Qiuyan and Kong Xiaxiang at the early Foundation Establishment realm, Kong Guli at the mid-stage, and the Gate Master Kong Guxi at the late-stage. Among the guest elders, we have Elder Sun Bo here at mid-stage and Fu Yuezi at late-stage. The other two guest elders... are incapacitated."

Li Zhouwei noted the presence of the Kong Clan members but didn't see Kong Guxi. The Profound Peak Gate Master had fought the hardest and was likely half-dead himself. He cut straight to the point. "How much of Shanji Prefecture did you manage to hold?"

Sun Bo looked startled for a moment, then replied in a low voice, "We secured about sixty percent. We only have the twenty-seven towns in the south. We've lost the mountains and the market. The main gate of the sect remains intact... The young master is cultivating within the sect and is unharmed."

The "young master" was, of course, Li Jianglong. With Changxi dead, the people of the Profound Peak Gate were desperate to see Li Jianglong return to the Li Clan safely. They would never allow him to come to harm. Li Zhouwei wasn't concerned about him, but he sighed inwardly. 'Without outside help, it will be difficult for them to even hold their current territory, let alone control Shanji Prefecture. They should have ceded it to the Purple Smoke Gate earlier in exchange for assistance.'

With no word yet from his own Daoist Master, Li Zhouwei dared not make any rash moves. He dismissed the group and waited. A short while later, the news he had been waiting for finally arrived from the west. Elder White Ape's figure appeared before the hall. Li Zhouwei hurried to greet him. "What is the situation in Funan?"

Elder White Ape reported everything. Li Zhouwei let out a breath of relief, but when he heard that An Siwei had been captured, he froze for a second before his expression hardened. "Immediately send someone with Situ Ku and try to exchange him for Elder Siwei! Once the Capital immortals Dao takes him away... it will be a completely different matter!"

If the Li Clan offered to trade Situ Ku for An Siwei, Situ Mo would surely agree with both hands raised. But once An Siwei was taken away by Guan Gongxiao's people, the situation would change entirely.

Guan Gongxiao wouldn't give Situ Ku a second glance.

Elder White Ape immediately clasped his fist and withdrew. An Siwei's strength was not outstanding, but his loyalty was unwavering and his contributions were significant. Li Zhouwei did not want anything to happen to him.

He paced the hall for a few steps, feeling the hope for this plan was slim. Furthermore, Li Ximing was still entangled with Daoist Master Yehui in the Great Void. An Siwei's chances of returning were pitifully small.

'Guan Gongxiao is no fool. Although Elder Siwei is not a powerful combatant, as an elder of my clan, he surely possesses valuable information. Guan Gongxiao knows this. He'll demand An Siwei from Situ Mo... and Situ Mo has no grounds to refuse!'

---

On the riverbank, the spiritual Qi in the air still vibrated from the recent battle. The grass and trees on the ground were wilted. Cultivators were dispatched to tend to the spirit veins scarred by True Fire and Geng Metal, but the ruins themselves were bustling with activity.

Although both sides coveted the territory of the wilderness and had tried to keep the fighting in the sky, collateral damage was unavoidable. Fortunately, an enemy cultivator had died on the spot, invigorating the water veins and preventing a major loss of spiritual Qi.

Kong Guxi descended from the sky and lifted his robes. The flesh on his legs looked as if it had been chewed by dogs, with chunks missing here and there, exposing translucent flesh and tender white cartilage.

'The Capital immortals Dao's Dharma Artifacts are truly formidable. This won't be easy to heal.'

His spiritual qi was depleted, preventing any self-healing. Worse, the wounds were infused with the enemy's lingering power. He quickly swallowed two pills and covered his legs, then addressed a disciple who had come to greet him. "Several of the Peak Lords are grievously injured. I saw that Elder Sun and Elder Wu were still in fair condition. Where have they gone?"

The disciple stammered for a moment. "Reporting to the Gate Master, the two lords have gone to Lord Chenghui's hall to make their report."

Kong Guxi paused, then nodded quickly. "Good... good... I've been too slow. I'll head over right now."

He glanced around. Not a single guest elder was in sight. Only his own kinswoman, Kong Qiuyan, was in the camp, tending to the wounded. Most of the other Foundation Establishment cultivators were down, and those still standing had rushed to greet the Li Clan.

Looking closer, Kong Guxi noticed that even the sect disciples they had brought were few and far between. There were only a handful left, with a dozen or so lying on the ground, groaning in pain.

He couldn't help but ask, "The disciples of the Seventeen Peaks... why are there so few left?"

The great battle had not involved many Qi Refining or Embryonic Breathing cultivators. While the Foundation Establishment masters fought in the sky, the Profound Peak disciples on the ground had mostly faced the gentry clans from across the river—hardly formidable opponents. Although the enemy had more Foundation Establishment cultivators and there were accidental killings, the losses shouldn't have been this catastrophic.

The disciple hesitated, unsure how to explain. Some things were apparent to him, a mere disciple, that might not be to the lofty Gate Master. He lowered his voice. "Reporting to the Gate Master... the brothers fought a retreating battle along the river. Perhaps they flew too far and lost their way. They should return after a short while."

"Lost their way?!"

Kong Guxi had not been in charge for long, but he was no fool. Hearing those words and seeing the disciple's expression, understanding dawned on him. He pursed his lips and said bitterly, "Oh... let them go... it's for the best."

The Profound Peak Gate had not been built from nothing. Most of its disciples came from the gentry clans of Lake Xian and Shanji Prefecture. With those lands now in enemy hands, their own families were in peril. It was only natural for the disciples to flee. Though a cold sorrow filled his heart, Kong Guxi understood.

'Once Shanji is completely lost, another wave will leave.'

Wincing in pain, Kong Guxi took to the air. A man in ochre armor with a black-patterned mask flew over to him, holding a spear and an axe, his body covered in blood. He bowed before Kong Guxi, his voice hoarse. "Fu Yuezi has just tended to his wounds and comes at once to pay respects to the Gate Master."

Fu Yuezi had fought one against four, and two of his ribs had been shattered, exposing the stark white bone beneath. Kong Guxi hurried to help him up, patting his shoulder. "Go and see Lord Chenghui. Why are you wasting time seeing me?"

Fu Yuezi stubbornly refused to move. Kong Guxi, severely injured himself, lacked the strength to push him and sighed, taking a step back. Just then, another old man hurried over, stopping hesitantly nearby. His hair was disheveled, his crown askew, his eyes red and bloodshot—a picture of utter misery.

The moment Kong Guxi saw him, it was as if a hole had been smashed in a frozen lake, and an icy chill shot to his heels. The heel on his left foot had been sheared off, and a phantom pain flared through the empty space. "Old brother... what is the meaning of this?" he asked.

This old man was the messenger Kong Guxi had sent to Mount Jingyi as soon as Changxi had fallen. He had crushed a jade talisman, signaling for the messenger to request aid. Now, he had returned in this pathetic state. The old man dropped to his knees with a thud, weeping and lamenting as he spoke. "The people stationed at the market near Mount Jingyi said... said Daoist Master Xuanyi is not on the mountain... That disciple was so arrogant, he wouldn't even deign to look me in the eye!"

"I asked for news of our seventeenth brother, but they said he refused to see me. The family sent eight letters before... he never answered a single one... And now... now! I went to Yuezhou Island, and they drove me away!"

"What!"

The breath caught in Kong Guxi's lungs. He was so stunned he could hardly breathe. Several moments passed before he could recover, his voice filled with disbelief. "Didn't he ask the sect for resources just before the new year?"

"He did..."

Understanding crashed down on Kong Guxi, and he nearly collapsed. The man who had not shed a single tear while his flesh was torn apart in battle now broke down into sobs. He let out two choked cries before stifling them, like a rooster being strangled.

"Alas... it's over... How will I ever explain this to Daoist Master Zhaojing!"

He wiped his tears. With his brother and Daoist Master Xuanyi proving unreliable, Kong Guxi feared the Li Clan would decide to retreat, sealing their doom.

Beside him, Kong Qiuyan was equally terrified. She glanced at her Gate Master and asked helplessly, "What can we do... He's climbed ashore and refuses to touch a sinking ship..."

A heavy silence fell over them. Kong Guxi's elder brother, the messenger, looked around with a miserable expression. "Where is everyone?" he asked.

Those two words struck them like a hammer blow. Seeing their faces, the old man understood. He went limp as if his bones had been removed. "The Xuanmiao Temple watches from the sidelines, Mount Jingyi slams the door in our face... Our family is in dire straits. It would be better to abandon the sect and find a place to live on the sea... At least there would be a chance of survival!"

Kong Qiuyan silently closed her eyes. "Who would go with you to some godforsaken place? Sun Bo? Which of the guest elders? And what random island could possibly support several Foundation Establishment cultivators?"

At their side, Fu Yuezi dropped to his knees again, his voice thick with emotion. "Wherever the Gate Master goes, Fu Yuezi will follow, even unto death!"

Kong Guxi listened in abject terror, his soul nearly flying from his body. "What nonsense are you spouting!" he roared. "We will follow the Daoist Master's arrangements! Who gave you the audacity to make such suggestions!"

Leave the mainland?

Never mind how important the Profound Peak Mountain was, or that their own elders were in seclusion there, even if the mountain fell, Kong Guxi would never dare to entertain the thought of leaving. It was madness!

'What is this? This is a slap in the face to the Li Clan... If we do that... where in this vast world could we possibly hide?'

A wave of dread washed up his spine, pulling him from his grief and rage. His face flushed crimson as he shouted, "You will all remember this! Even if the Kong Clan must die, we will die in Jiangnan! We will die fighting the Capital immortals Dao! As long as the Daoist Master allows it, even if there is only a single plot of land for us to stand on, as long as we can look up and see the spirit mountains of the north, we are not going anywhere!"

"Brother, if you speak such words again, do not blame my sword for being merciless!"

# Chapter 733: First Encounter

Kong Guxi’s words made the other members of the Kong clan lower their heads. Kong Qiuyan assented, her face a mask of regret as she shook her head.

“First Uncle was merely careless, I beg the Sect Master’s forgiveness… If our other uncles hadn’t been killed at sea by the Changxiao Gate, we wouldn’t be in such a desperate situation… We have troubled the Sect Master.”

Before Kong Guxi could reply, a streak of purple lightning descended nearby, transforming into a man in silver armor. Kong Guxi hurried to greet him, clasping his hands in a respectful bow.

“Brother Chenghui… I’ve sustained some injuries… and I was busy organizing the disciples, so I didn’t have a chance to pay my respects…”

“Sect Master Kong, there’s no need for such formalities.”

Li Chenghui quickly moved to help him up. Kong Guxi was technically of Li Ximing’s generation, making him a senior. He couldn’t let the man bow. “My clan head wishes to see you!” he announced, his tone serious.

As expected, Kong Guxi straightened up and hurried after him. Understanding the gravity of the Profound Peak Gate’s losses, Li Chenghui offered some comforting words.

“I heard that several of your guest elders were wounded, mostly while covering our clan’s cultivators. On behalf of my clan, I thank you.”

“Please, it was our duty,” Kong Guxi replied, doing his best to maintain his composure despite the throbbing pain in his legs, which he suppressed with his spiritual energy. “Without Moongaze Lake, the Profound Peak Gate’s lineage would not survive. You are too kind, Brother Cheng. Though Guest Elder Bai of the Spring's Echo lineage has fallen, Sun Bo, who is more skilled in healing arts, is still with us. Our injuries are manageable.”

When they arrived at the main hall, Li Zhouwei was conferring with Sun Bo about the cultivators’ conditions. Upon seeing Kong Guxi, Sun Bo immediately stepped aside, bowing his head and retreating with a clear understanding of his place.

As a guest elder of the Profound Peak Gate, it was a breach of protocol for Sun Bo to bypass his own sect master and report directly to Li Zhouwei. But power dictates its own etiquette. In these times, only Fu Yuezi remained aloof from the Li clan. Kong Guxi didn’t even bother to take offense.

In his youth, Kong Guxi had his share of arrogance. He had been a profligate son of a powerful clan, and he knew exactly what fueled such pride. Now, without a Purple Mansion realm patron, he was no better than a dog scrounging for bones under the table. Even he had to approach with deference, bowing deeply.

“Greetings, Clan Head!”

“Senior, you mustn’t.”

Li Zhouwei offered a token protest as two attendants moved to help Kong Guxi up. But Kong Guxi remained bowed, his voice firm.

“The Clan Head turned the tide and saved my Profound Peak Gate’s lineage. You deserve this bow!”

He completed the full set of ceremonial thanks. Li Zhouwei waited patiently, and after a few polite refusals, he cut to the heart of the matter.

“Senior, what are your plans for your people?”

Hearing this, Kong Guxi knew he couldn’t suggest returning to the Profound Peak mountain gate. He was well aware that large swaths of Shanji Prefecture had fallen. If his people retreated to the safety of their sect’s Purple Mansion formation, who would be left to defend the wilderness? The Li clan alone?

The Sect Master of Profound Peak immediately prostrated himself, his expression a mixture of fear and humility.

“Reporting to the Clan Head, the defenses of Shanji Prefecture have been breached, and the borders are fraught with danger. I fear any attempt to travel would be intercepted by Guan Gongxiao… I humbly request a place for my people to garrison in the wilderness. We will wait for the situation to stabilize before returning to our mountain.”

A hush fell over the hall. Outside the doors, Sun Bo couldn’t help but turn his head, a pang of guilt on his face. Even Li Zhouwei gave Kong Guxi a second look.

Regardless of whether Shanji Prefecture could be held, Li Zhouwei had already planned to station the Profound Peak Gate’s Foundation Establishment cultivators and disciples in the wilderness. The Li clan’s own members were stretched thin covering their duties, and there was no one to spare. He couldn't just let Kong Guxi and his people retreat to their sect to rest and recuperate. Who, then, would guard the wildlands?

As for allowing them to enter the inner territories of the Prefecture, Li Zhouwei had never considered it. The Li clan had no intention of annexing the Profound Peak Gate. The name had to be preserved. He wasn't even interested in poaching their guest elders.

‘Only this Sun Bo is of some use…’ Li Zhouwei mused. ‘He’s of the Verdant Grove Dao, after all, and most of its abilities are focused on healing. We were looking for someone from the Spring's Echo lineage before, but this Wood Virtue foundation is far superior to a half-baked practitioner of that art.’

Visibly, Li Zhouwei nodded. “Sect Master, you are too formal. The wilderness is your clan’s territory to begin with, so there is no need to speak of making space. I too was concerned that the Profound Peak mountain gate is far away on the shores of Lake Xian, making travel and reinforcements difficult.”

“Since we are of one mind, please select a suitable mountain range in the wilderness as your base of operations!”

Kong Guxi quickly agreed. He also needed to move a portion of his sect’s treasures out of the mountain gate. If the situation became truly unsalvageable and they lost their home, this would give the Profound Peak Gate a glimmer of hope for the future.

He waited with bated breath for a few moments, and then Li Zhouwei finally asked the question he had been dreading.

“Do you have any news regarding the matter of Mount Jingyi?”

Kong Guxi dropped to his knees with a thud and lowered his head as he explained the situation. Li Zhouwei listened with a tightening frown. When Kong Guxi finished, his brow relaxed, and he shook his head.

“Sect Master, this clan member of yours… is he truly unwilling to see you?”

He stared intently into Kong Guxi’s eyes, which were filled with a mixture of misery and terror that seemed genuine. The beleaguered sect master then presented a letter written by his own brother. After reading it, Li Zhouwei offered some counsel.

“Overseas sects can’t be trusted. Having left the clan at a young age, it’s unlikely he feels any loyalty to the Kong clan. Let it be.”

He dismissed Kong Guxi, but then added a probing reminder. “However, my word is not final on this. You will have to speak with the Daoist Master about it. When he returns, I will send someone to fetch you.”

At these words, the half-eased heart of Kong Guxi leaped back into his throat. He sighed and retreated to find Sun Bo for treatment. Li Chenghui escorted him out, then returned to Li Zhouwei’s side, a thoughtful expression on his face.

“Daoist Master Changxi chose well,” Li Chenghui remarked with a sigh. “Kong Guxi may lack strategic brilliance, but he knows when to let go, acts decisively, and is willing to lower his head. Those qualities alone… are enough to save the Profound Peak Gate!”

Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement. “He may be a mediocre leader in times of peace, but in a crisis, he is a pillar of strength, a fine steed for a collapsing dynasty. He sees the situation clearly and can swallow his pride. You say ‘those qualities alone,’ but how many can truly do the same? When ruin is at hand and life and death are decided in a few choices, how many could match him?”

Li Chenghui concurred, but then his tone turned worried. “But with the Daoist Master yet to return and the situation with Mount Jingyi in flux, the road ahead will be even more difficult.”

Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal. “The worst that can happen is we give up Shanji Prefecture and the Profound Peak mountain gate. It’s not as if we’ll gain nothing. The Profound Peak cultivators are the ones on the front lines anyway. Setting aside the Capital immortals Dao, who were our enemies from the start, as long as our clan is careful, this is a venture with guaranteed returns.”

“But we can’t just abandon Shanji and the Profound Peak Gate from the outset, especially since we’ve never even set foot inside… a hasty retreat would damage our reputation. It's better to defend and retreat step by step than to have never possessed it at all.”

In truth, aside from the loss of An Siwei, the Li clan had suffered no substantial damage in the great battle—just some minor territorial setbacks and injuries. With a Purple Mansion realm cultivator backing them, as long as their people were safe, nothing else was a major issue. He paused, his thoughts lingering on An Siwei’s fate for a moment, before his eyes fell upon the letter from Mount Jingyi. After a moment of contemplation, he spoke again.

“You say the situation with Mount Jingyi is in flux. I’m not so sure.”

Li Chenghui looked up as Li Zhouwei continued. “It’s hard to say if Daoist Master Xuanyi is truly being held up by the Chunyi Dao, but this Kong Gumo of Mount Jingyi… his refusal to help may not be a complete disregard for the Kong clan.”

“If I were Changxi, I would certainly want to leave behind a few bloodlines as a contingency. Kong Gumo might be Changxi’s final arrangement. What if my Li clan went back on our word? What if we didn’t shelter the Kong clan, but instead took their treasures and carved up their territory with the Capital immortals Dao? Or worse, what if we tried to curry favor with the mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator Yehui and threw the Kong clan to the wolves?”

“In that case, the Kong clan within the seas would be annihilated, without even a direct heir remaining. Kong Gumo, the son who severed all ties, would be the true last ember of the Kong clan. As the disciple of a Purple Mansion Daoist Master, he is guaranteed to reach Foundation Establishment… and by refusing to aid his family, he appears to be a completely ungrateful wretch. The other Purple Mansion Daoist Masters would not be so quick to kill him in front of Daoist Master Xuanyi.”

Li Zhouwei spoke as he searched through some books. Li Chenghui immediately grasped his meaning.

“Clan Head, you’re suggesting… Daoist Master Xuanyi received a favor from Changxi, and the condition wasn’t to save the Profound Peak Gate, but rather to stay out of the conflict and protect Kong Gumo?”

“Not necessarily,” Li Zhouwei said, picking up a brush. “Changxi was a clever man, and clever men don’t make trouble for themselves. Since he told our clan that Mount Jingyi would be an ally, the agreement likely included helping the Profound Peak Gate, but the terms were probably flexible—major or minor aid, mandatory or best-effort, at his discretion. He could fulfill the letter of the agreement by skirting the edges. That way, he’d have an explanation ready when our Daoist Master comes calling.”

“This matter isn’t settled yet. We shouldn’t place too much importance on Mount Jingyi. In the affairs within these seas, for the most part, we can only rely on ourselves.”

Li Zhouwei paused, his brush hovering over the paper. A genuine look of worry finally creased his features.

“All of this is secondary. My greatest concern is that the Daoist Master has yet to return.”

No matter how dire the Profound Peak Gate’s situation became, it was ultimately their problem. The Li clan could withdraw. Li Zhouwei was confident he could handle any new development. The only one who could not afford to have a mishap was Li Ximing. If something happened to him, not only would the Li clan and the Profound Peak Gate be finished in an instant, but Li Zhouwei himself would become a fugitive, forced to flee overseas.

---

The Great Void.

In an expanse of empty darkness, Li Ximing sat silently upon the Jewel Steps, cloaked in Profound Light.

Above him, a Celestial Gate towered into the blackness. Dragon banners and phoenix chariots drifted through it in a silent procession. Golden-armored and golden-robed figures stood frozen upon the gate like statues in various poses.

Only the platinum-gold canopies stirred gently, shedding streams of Profound Light that fell like countless golden threads.

Three Jewel Steps, each several feet high, led up to the gate. Li Ximing sat cross-legged on the highest one, his body wreathed in surging purple flames, his hands forming a seal in silent meditation.

Beyond the gate, a thick, dark-purple radiance pulsed like a fog, encroaching and receding, nearly blending with the blackness of the Great Void. Every so often, the Profound Light would disperse a cluster of it, revealing an even denser concentration of divine power that had the entire Celestial Gate locked down.

Yehui hadn't spoken a single word. He had simply brought his divine ability to bear within the Great Void, forcing Li Ximing to sit and counter it. A suffocating silence hung between them.

Li Ximing could even sense that his opponent had no desire for a full-blown battle; he merely wanted to contain him here.

Although he possessed the Profound Peak Gate's great treasure, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, which would allow him to escape and rush to Li Zhouwei’s aid in a crisis, he knew Yehui also had his own methods. Li Ximing didn’t want to truly fight him. He sat quietly, though the feeling of being constrained was far from pleasant.

Yehui was undoubtedly stronger. Li Ximing could feel that his opponent’s divine ability was perfectly calibrated, blanketing the Great Void. Shrouded by the Sorrowful Southern Water, he couldn’t even gauge the dimensions of the space around him. All he could see was the small patch of ground beneath his feet, which faced the wilderness below.

Seeing Guan Gongxiao and the others being forced to retreat brought him a measure of relief.

‘The dead are all Profound Peak cultivators, so it’s no loss to us,’ he calculated. ‘As for the territory we’ve secured in Shanji Prefecture… our clan won’t be guarding it. I wonder if the Purple Smoke Gate would be willing to take it…’

Even though the Li clan had repelled the Capital immortals Dao, Li Ximing knew they couldn't possibly hold all the newly acquired land. The border was simply too long, and it would become less defensible over time. After such a major battle, both sides had withdrawn to rest. This victory only meant that the Li clan now had the right to dispose of the remaining territory in Shanji Prefecture.

‘If not, I can ask Sumian of the Xuanmiao Temple and Lingmei of the Sword Gate. Both of their territories border it… better to let them have it than the Capital immortals Dao!’

These were matters to be dealt with upon his return. Li Ximing cleared his thoughts. The purple light before him showed no signs of weakening. In one hand, he held a gold-patterned profound pearl, ready to flee.

But then a second thought gave him pause.

‘The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger is a rare and powerful spiritual artifact. Although it belonged to Daoist Master Changxi and has been seen before, Yehui only arrived in Jiangnan a little over a decade ago. It’s very likely he isn’t familiar with it. If I use it to escape now, I’ll reveal a powerful tool for nothing. He’ll be wary of it in the future, and I’ll lose a valuable element of surprise.’

Acting on the principle of keeping a trump card hidden if possible, Li Ximing remained still. After a quarter of an hour, Yehui still hadn’t spoken. Li Ximing sighed softly and called out in a clear voice, “Friend Daoist, what guidance do you have for me?”

He waited a few breaths before Yehui’s figure emerged from the depths of the Great Void. The man looked up, his eyes gazing at him from beneath his brow. “Daoist Friend Zhaojing,” he began, “are you now willing to discuss the matter of the Profound Peak Gate?”

‘To hell with your Profound Peak Gate. Just drop this wretched divine ability of yours and let me go…’

Li Ximing paused for a moment before replying, “Senior Changxi entrusted the Profound Peak Gate to myself and Daoist Master Sumian. It is my duty to ensure the sect’s stability. Since Friend Daoist Yehui is willing to talk, I am willing to listen.”

Yehui cradled the ceremonial-looking Dharma sword in his arms, his expression calm. “I’ve heard,” he said suddenly, “that the Bright Yang lineage is not skilled in evasion arts. If I were to engage you in a discussion of the Dao and keep you here for, say, three to five years, I imagine it would be rather unpleasant for you, no?”

Li Ximing frowned. It was true that he was not skilled in evasion arts, and his Audience with the Celestial Gate had no such related abilities. Yehui, with his powerful divine ability, was more than capable of suppressing him. However, he had the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger to compensate for this weakness. Whether he could actually escape was an open question.

But he didn’t know the full extent of Yehui’s abilities, and he had never truly fought a Purple Mansion cultivator before, let alone a mid-stage one. After some consideration, he decided to hear the man out. “What is it you propose, Friend Daoist?”

Yehui’s tone suddenly softened. “There is a cultivator in the Profound Peak mountain gate named Kong Haiying. If you could take care of him, our two clans could sit down and talk about dividing the Profound Peak Gate’s territory…”

The man raised an eyebrow, a smile playing on his lips. “I know your clan values its reputation. We can put on a show of fighting. When we reach the border we’ve agreed upon, we can stop. The Profound Peak cultivators will be eternally grateful and serve you like dogs, and I will have eliminated a major threat. Wouldn’t that be a win-win?”

# Chapter 734: Traversing the Great Void

'So he wants to kill Kong Haiying.'

Li Ximing scoffed inwardly. In truth, there was no irreconcilable conflict between the Capital immortals Dao and the Li family. But he didn't believe for a second that Yehui's goal was merely Kong Haiying.

'If all your moves were aimed at Kong Haiying, why give my family such a sour look earlier?'

Since Yehui was putting on an act, Li Ximing decided to play along. A look of surprise flickered across his face.

"Daoist Yehui, didn't Kong Haiying fall some time ago? The disturbance in the Profound Peak's earth meridian before Senior Changxi's death—that was the omen of his passing!"

Yehui was momentarily stumped by the blatant lie. He stared grimly at Li Ximing. The man was supposed to be Fu En, but if he was actually Kong Haiying, it would make sense for Changxi to have deliberately misidentified him. He paused.

True or not, Li Ximing's words had completely disrupted his prepared script. Yehui's voice turned cold. "Oh? Is that... true or not... No matter. Let me witness your Bright Yang divine abilities."

As he spoke, the Great Void trembled. A vast expanse of dark purple iridescence above and below began to hum with a solemn, heavy resonance as a damp, watery vapor began to rise.

The next moment, a multicolored fish the size of a calf emerged from the iridescent light. Its scales were ethereal, shifting between deep and light shades of purple. But its head was a skeletal human skull with two hollow, quiet dark eye sockets.

The purple fish arched in the air, and countless more of its kind swarmed out of the purple haze. They converged into a torrential river beneath the Celestial Gate and surged upward. Seeing that Yehui was serious, Li Ximing’s Profound Light flared from between his brows, and the Celestial Gate behind him rumbled in response.

A battle cry shook the heavens. The countless figures in golden armor and robes on the Celestial Gate suddenly came to life. They descended with spears and swords in hand to meet the charge, clashing with the purple river and holding it back.

But with another deafening roar, Yehui exhaled a puff of white qi. This qi seemed to weigh a thousand tons, sinking instantly and causing the Great Void to congeal. Li Ximing and his entire Audience with the Celestial Gate were caught as if in a quagmire, sinking slowly, finding it difficult to advance or retreat.

'No wonder Changxi didn't dare fight him. Just with this Eastern Feather Mountain... this old fox has considerable control over the battlefield in the Great Void.'

Li Ximing knew this was Yehui's second divine ability, Eastern Feather Mountain. He was thankful that the Bright Yang lineage was formidable in combat. Intending to test his own capabilities without resorting to a Dharma Artifact, he opened his mouth and unleashed a torrent of Bright Yang Purple Fire.

This purple fire, normally nurtured in the Juque Palace, now poured out in an unending stream. It was no ordinary flame. The brilliant blaze pulsed with the power of imperial union and generation, crashing against the solidified Great Void.

Li Ximing didn't need to fight the suppression of Eastern Feather Mountain head-on. He focused the entirety of his purple fire onto a single point. No matter how powerful the opposing divine ability was, it couldn't withstand such a focused assault and a pinprick-sized hole was easily burned through the barrier.

A single point was all he needed.

In the Great Void, a point could be a plane, or it could be a doorway. Li Ximing, along with the Celestial Gate behind him, vanished, effortlessly breaking free from the lockdown of Sorrowful Southern Water and Eastern Feather Mountain. He reappeared in another section of the Great Void and transformed into a streak of Profound Light to flee.

And so, Yehui, a dignified mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, had failed to put any real pressure on a newly advanced cultivator in two exchanges, allowing him to escape.

'So this is the Great Void...'

Li Ximing finally understood just how difficult it was for Purple Mansion cultivators to kill one another. The Great Void was a net riddled with holes. Every cultivator could be as massive as a mountain or as small as a speck of dust. How could one possibly lock down another's escape?

Yehui was not surprised. His own divine ability activated, and his figure reappeared at the edge of the purple light. He brought the entire expanse of light with him, once again enveloping Li Ximing. The suppressing pressure of Eastern Feather Mountain descended anew, bringing back the feeling of being trapped in a mire.

But this time, Yehui's hands formed a seal. The instant Eastern Feather Mountain manifested, the Great Void beneath Li Ximing twisted and hollowed out, causing him to misstep and fail to shift away. Li Ximing remained fearless. With flames held in his mouth, he spat them directly at the ritual sword in Yehui’s hands.

The sword momentarily blocked the flames, but an incredibly sharp aura rose from within the Great Void. Li Ximing knew it was his opponent's Dharma Artifact. Forcing down the impulse to draw his own, the Profound Light between his brows pulsed as he shouted, "Hah!"

Flickering Profound Light illuminated the entire expanse of the Great Void, finally revealing a brilliant golden glint. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light erupted from between Li Ximing's brows and smashed into the weapon.

Li Ximing hadn't cultivated Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light for very long, but with the foundation of his Purple Mansion cultivation and the synergy with his innate Profound Light divine ability, the combined power was actually enough to stall the Dharma Artifact for a moment.

'I can't beat you head-on, but I can certainly leave.'

Familiarity bred confidence. Purple flames surged before Li Ximing, and he slipped away once more. But Yehui took another step, reappearing right behind him, ritual sword stabbing forward. Li Ximing immediately raised his Celestial Gate to block with his divine ability. He felt a chill as a streak of purple light shot up the back of his hand.

The blow was blocked without serious injury. Li Ximing used the opportunity to pull away. After flying for several breaths, his opponent closed the distance again. Having learned his lesson, Li Ximing simply spat a mouthful of purple fire at the sword. This move countered Eastern Feather Mountain and the weapon simultaneously, allowing him to escape unscathed.

But as he shifted sideways this time, he felt the Great Void suddenly grow steeper and more difficult to navigate. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed the distinct presence of a Pit Water formation. Glancing down at the physical world, he saw towering mountains encircled by a stream below. It was Mount Xianyou.

Li Ximing had no intention of asking the Xiao family for help; they had simply stumbled into the Great Void above Mount Xianyou during their fight. The Great Void here was like a vast mountain range, difficult to traverse. It wasn't because of a technique or a formation, but a matter of spiritual qi. Mount Xianyou was the primary spiritual hub of Lixia Prefecture, which made the local Great Void exceedingly steep.

Yehui had obviously noticed this as well. With his Sorrowful Southern Water divine ability and the aid of that crow spirit technique, he was much faster here. He closed the distance in an instant. Li Ximing blocked with a blast of purple fire and vanished, reappearing in the physical world.

'If it's hard to move in the Great Void, why can't I just travel through the physical world?'

He burst through, leaving his opponent to grasp at empty air. His eyes lit up. Below him were several spirit mountains belonging to a small family. A few cultivators were battling in the sky. Li Ximing’s divine ability flared, and in a flash, he recognized the emblem on their robes.

'The Wu family of southern Lixia. So I've already reached the southern part of the prefecture.'

The Wu family cultivators appeared to be locked in a desperate struggle with some demonic cultivators. The moment Li Ximing stepped out, the sky instantly changed from a light drizzle to a bright, clear spring day. The raindrops hanging in the air never hit the ground as the heavens filled with radiant light and colorful clouds.

'A Purple Mansion...? Huh?'

The sudden appearance of a Purple Mansion cultivator overhead froze every cultivator on the battlefield like statues. The demonic cultivator in the lead felt his mind might just explode. A single thought echoed in the blank void of his brain:

"Huh? It was just a batch of spirit rice... Was this really necessary?"

The pitched battle instantly descended into a farce. One man swinging his sword sent it flying into the sky. Another casting a spell nearly bit off his tongue. The demonic cultivator, who had half-raised his shield, didn't dare complete the motion, letting a sword chop into his head. His opponent from the Wu family was in no better state, having lost all mind for fighting and nearly plummeting from the sky.

Xiao Chuting was likely not here, and Li Ximing couldn't care less about them. He didn't pause for a moment. The Profound Light at his feet flashed, and he vanished, flying toward the distant horizon.

Yet even as he passed at a considerable distance, the demonic cultivator was caught off guard by the after-effect of Li Ximing's escape light. He felt a surge of purple flame and brilliant light wash over him. A stuffiness filled his chest, and in an instant, his hair and beard were incinerated. With a _whoosh_, his robes burst into flames.

Had he been an ordinary cultivator, it might have been better. But as a demonic cultivator, his very flesh began to burn along with his robes. The surrounding fighters watched, dumbfounded and too terrified to flee.

Fortunately, Li Ximing had only been there for a split second and had paid him no mind. He was already miles away, but the demonic cultivator's agonizing screams continued as his Dharma robes burned to ash.

Before anyone could feel relieved, the Great Void tore open once more. The sky, which had just cleared, was instantly filled with dark, heavy clouds. A solemn, prayer-like hum filled the air as Yehui's figure appeared. The Daoist Master, dressed in deep blue robes, swept his sharp, intelligent eyes over the area.

At this moment, Yehui's Sorrowful Southern Water was operating at full power, nearly half his body dissolved into a purple halo, and he was still augmented by Eastern Feather Mountain. That single glance was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky. The next moment, Yehui too had vanished. Only then did the six cultivators react, crying out in pain as they fell from the sky, trailing streaks of purple light.

Li Ximing hadn't even left the vicinity of Mount Xianyou. The moment the spiritual qi felt a little less oppressive, he ducked back into the Great Void. Yehui's purple light immediately followed. The speed of Sorrowful Southern Water was indeed impressive. Li Ximing was forced to take another hit as he saw the gates of the Profound Peak Mountain up ahead.

Yehui arrived at the same time.

He held his ritual sword, and every one of its deep blue runes was glowing. After the long chase, Yehui's face was grim. He formed a seal and chanted, and another wisp of white qi leaped from his lips.

As the white qi flew out, Li Ximing not only felt his feet grow heavy, but the very Great Void before him changed. The glow of the Profound Peak Gate's Bound Earth formation was instantly extinguished, veiled by a hazy white light. Even the fabric of the Great Void became uneven and distorted.

'Eastern Feather Mountain has this kind of power?!'

Li Ximing’s spiritual sense swept out. The Great Void around the Profound Peak Gate was deathly still, and the entrance to the Purple Mansion formation had become indistinct, shifting from near to far. He knew Eastern Feather Mountain could influence the Great Void, but he never realized it had such a wondrous application.

He spat fire, broke out of the Great Void, and entered the physical world of the Profound Peak Mountain. He saw a layer of purple light, like smoke and mist, covering the vast mountain. It drew the gazes of cultivators from all over Shanji Prefecture. Yehui was seated upon it, mounted on his dark crow.

"No wonder Yehui was confident he could tie me up for three to five years... If he keeps pestering me like this, it will be truly difficult to get away. Even if he can't kill me, he could definitely wear me down to a lightly injured state over three or five years."

Li Ximing couldn't enter the gate, but he wasn't discouraged. As long as Yehui was determined to entangle him, entering the gate would just mean being trapped in a different location. This simply meant continuing the fight outside.

But he had already planned his escape route. He hadn't come all this way just to be blocked at the door. He watched coolly as the purple light circled above the Profound Peak Gate.

'But... can Daoist Master Sumian really sit still for this?'

With a cold laugh, he plunged back into the Great Void. Though he couldn't enter the gate, he led Yehui on a chase, circling again and again around the perimeter. He took a few hits from divine abilities, but after a full half-incense stick of time, the purple aura still hung over the Profound Peak Gate.

Li Ximing knew Sumian cared for his reputation, so he deliberately prolonged the stalemate with Yehui. As more and more cultivators gathered in the vicinity, Li Ximing entered the Great Void one last time and finally saw Daoist Master Sumian appear in the distance.

The old Daoist Master sighed. "Daoist Yehui... please stay your hand! This old man... promised Daoist Changxi I would protect the Profound Peak. I cannot sit by and do nothing..."

Daoist Master Changxi had died at Sumian's Xuanmiao Temple—his body had been delivered to its very doorstep. Was there any cultivator in the north or south who didn't know? Lake Xian might be under the Xuanmiao Temple's protection only because the Capital immortals Dao hadn't bothered to attack it. But now Yehui was fighting right at the mountain gate, and while Li Ximing fought back, Sumian was nowhere to be seen. This was the kind of thing that would get him scorned...

Sumian had cultivated his reputation for centuries, much of it with an eye toward his own legacy. He couldn't afford to lose it. Forced to intervene, he simply stood in the Great Void, and Yehui finally stopped.

"So it is the venerable Daoist Master Qi."

Yehui chuckled. "I was merely sparring with Daoist Master Zhaojing. I didn't expect to cause such a commotion and disturb you, venerable master. In that case, we shall stop here."

He seemed to be on decent terms with Sumian. He gave Li Ximing a deep look, then turned with a smile to Sumian. "May I ask for how long the venerable master promised Changxi his protection? I plan to visit you in a few days, precisely to discuss the matter of the Profound Peak!"

"If conflict can be turned into friendship, that is naturally for the best," Sumian replied.

Li Ximing, ignoring Yehui, calmly brushed the enemy's lingering power from his wrist and spoke directly. "I recall the Daoist Master said he would treat the wounded of the Profound Peak Gate. One of the Kong family was crippled, three others were maimed. I will have them sent to you later. I'll have to trouble you, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing couldn't be bothered with pleasantries. Since Sumian had appeared, it meant the man valued his reputation and wouldn't go back on his word. With the Profound Peak members heavily injured, why should he handle it himself when he could trouble someone else?

Sumian simply nodded as he watched Li Ximing give a perfunctory salute and depart. Yehui flicked his sleeves and left as well. The old master suddenly felt a massive headache coming on.

'I have to find a way to resolve this. There's less and less time, and I need to focus my energy on that demonic embryo. I don't have time to babysit these two...'

Sumian sighed and headed back toward the Xuanmiao Temple, his mind already racing.

'I must find a way to open the Xiaoshi Mountain treasury and settle this matter quickly. Better than having these two idle masters drawing all eyes this way, catching me in the crossfire and tying my hands...'

# Chapter 735: Changxiao and Yehui

Yehui traveled through the Great Void for a time before returning to his own White Ye Mountain. Guan Gongxiao was kneeling before the monument at the summit, his forehead pressed firmly to the ground.

“Greetings, Daoist Master,” Guan Gongxiao said respectfully. “Your disciple has failed. We suffered heavy casualties and lost our Dharma Artifacts. I await your punishment!”

“Enough,” Yehui said, silencing him with a wave. His brow furrowed. “This wasn’t your fault. Our objectives were met, and the Profound Peak Gate sustained significant losses. We’ve reclaimed the territory we were due. What does it matter if we lost three Dharma Artifacts? It’s not as if they were ancient relics.”

Guan Gongxiao kowtowed again, about to say more, but with another flick of his hand, Yehui sent him away, leaving not even a shadow behind.

‘A pity about Guan Kan,’ Yehui mused to himself. ‘He was an old hand, yet Li Zhouwei managed to kill him. Still, he served his purpose. It wasn’t a total loss.’

Yehui poured a cup of tea at a stone table and waited. Within a quarter of an hour, a figure stepped out of the Great Void.

The Daoist Master wore a robe adorned with cloud patterns. His face was kind and gentle, giving him the air of a benevolent clan elder, though his eyes were a bit narrow. He sat down at the table, clearly in high spirits.

‘After all that scheming, the old scoundrel finally got what he wanted.’

Despite his cynical thoughts, Yehui smiled warmly. “Greetings, Daoist Friend Changxiao!”

This was none other than Chang Xiaozi, the master of the Changxiao Gate, a renowned figure who had carved a path to the Purple Mansion realm by fighting his way through the Three Sects and Seven Gates.

Changxiao smiled back. “Greetings, my friend. And how fares your third divine ability? The trials of the Purple Mansion are perilous. You must be careful.”

Yehui simply smiled without answering. Instead, he asked, “It has been many years since I last saw Daoist Friend Chengyan. I wonder how he is doing?”

Yehui was a relative newcomer to Jiangbei and hadn't been involved in the Anhuai Heaven incident, but he had heard the stories. He had no personal grudge against Chengyan; he just despised incompetence and enjoyed twisting the knife.

Changxiao understood his meaning perfectly. “Oh, him?” he replied casually. “He found a promising disciple a few years back and seems to think he’s on the verge of a breakthrough. He hasn’t been willing to leave the sect since, just waiting to perfect his second divine ability.”

After a moment’s hesitation, Yehui guided the conversation to the real issue. “We expended a great deal of effort, and my sect made significant sacrifices to achieve this. Did you see what you needed to?”

“I saw it clearly.” A strange, excited light gleamed in Changxiao’s eyes. “Li Zhouwei is indeed tied to a destiny of Metallic Essence. I observed from the side with my Life Divine Ability—it took the form of a White Qilin. My years of suspicion were not unfounded. At last, I have a lead!”

Yehui seemed uninterested in Changxiao’s affairs. He chose his words carefully. “To help you confirm this, I provoked the Li Clan for no reason, lost an elder, and suffered a blow to my reputation. I also failed to sow discord within the Profound Peak Gate, allowing the situation to change… The price was steep.”

“You have my sincerest thanks, Yehui!” Changxiao, still in a fine mood, laughed and cupped his hands. “Si Boxiu is always watching me, and the other clans around the lake resent my presence. Without your righteous assistance, I truly could not have investigated this matter on my own!”

Growing impatient with the pleasantries, Yehui offered a polite smile. “Daoist Friend Changxiao, surely you can give me the Crimson-Headed Profound Soul now!”

“Ah, not so hasty!” Changxiao chuckled. “This matter isn’t concluded yet. Besides, your third divine ability is still incomplete. Do you forget how difficult the path forward is?”

He paused, then shifted his tone. “The Soul-Summoning Lore is a Life Divine Ability. There are plenty of lineages in Jiangnan that teach such arts, yet you’ve never pursued them. You must look down on them, meaning you have something better in your hands—something so formidable that it requires a treasure like the Crimson-Headed Profound Soul. I imagine it’s no easy task. It will likely take you forty or fifty years. Why the sudden urgency?”

“Once this business is properly settled,” he concluded, “I will naturally hand the item over to you.”

‘Empty promises, you old fox.’

Though frustration simmered within him, Yehui merely nodded in agreement. “You may not be aware, Daoist Friend, but I’ve received word that the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea has been inactive for years. The thunder is about to fall, and the situation then will be far more complex. We should resolve this now, while we still can. In a few years, we can retreat into seclusion.”

As a cultivator from the Eastern Sea, how could Yehui not know this? “That’s hardly news,” he said flatly.

Changxiao, well aware of his companion’s prickly nature, simply continued, “But I do have a piece of good news for you.”

He smiled. “Xuanyi and the Chunyi Dao Gate got into a massive brawl. The fighting was so intense it roiled the seas, and even the Dragon King of the Crimson Reef Island had to intervene. If my information is correct, we won’t have to worry about Mount Jingyi for the foreseeable future.”

This, at last, earned a nod from Yehui. Xuanyi was a formidable opponent. If cultivators from Mount Jingyi had intervened, his own Capital immortals Dao might not have been their match. With Xuanyi out of the picture, it was unlikely the core disciples of Mount Jingyi would venture out. How could this not be good news?

After exchanging a few more words, Yehui politely saw Changxiao off. Returning to the table, he stared gloomily in the direction his guest had departed. A long while later, he muttered, “If the Crimson-Headed Profound Soul weren’t so incredibly rare, with that old bastard holding the only one he found in the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven… I wouldn’t be at his mercy.”

“A pity about my Capital immortals Dao lineage… So many of our arts have become useless with the decline of spiritual energy. Otherwise, I wouldn't be in this position. The Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven opens so rarely. Who knows when it will be accessible again? I can’t afford to wait.”

He let out a sharp breath and rubbed his temples, gritting his teeth. “That old scoundrel did this on purpose. Now the feud between my sect and the Li Clan has deepened. By the time this all comes out into the open… even if he doesn't give me a thing, I'll be forced to help him deal with them!”

Truthfully, Yehui had no desire to target the Li Clan. They were a useful buffer against the Azure Pond and Golden Feather Sects. But with Changxi constantly stirring up trouble and Changxiao applying pressure, he felt his options dwindling.

“Some things must be done. I’ll delay Li Ximing, handle this as delicately as possible. As long as Si Boxiu is still alive… I mustn’t push him too far.”

The Li Clan was wary of Yehui, but they didn’t know that the Purple Mansion Daoist Master of the Capital immortals Dao was just as wary of them. He hadn’t even used his full strength in the recent battle, doing just enough to fulfill his obligation to Changxiao.

“The moment I push Li Ximing into Si Boxiu’s arms, the moment I force the Li Clan back to the Azure Pond Sect, I can forget about gaining even the smallest foothold in Jiangnan. Si Boxiu will do everything he can to make the Li Clan dependent on Azure Pond and will interfere directly. Once that man gets involved, I can forget about ever getting my hands on the treasures of Xiaoshi Mountain!”

‘Besides… I came to Jiangbei to establish a sect, not to make enemies! Li Ximing is not even a century old. If Li Zhouwei can’t handle him… that’s even more unsettling.’

After pondering for a long time, Yehui finally set down his jade cup and drew his Dharma sword.

‘The only way to deal with Kong Haiying is through the Xuanmiao Temple. Eliminating him will not only remove a future threat but will also drive a wedge between Xuanmiao and Moongaze. Sumian is the type to appease and de-escalate. This won’t be difficult.’

### Chapter 736: Taking Stock

Li Ximing streaked across the Great Void, his form materializing in the sky above the untamed wilderness. He pushed up a sleeve, revealing the back of his hand where a speck of purple light pulsed with a sullen glow.

During the recent chase and clash, he had exchanged several blows with Yehui, who had managed to leave a wound on him. The injury was trivial, however, having almost no effect on his Dharma Body. He estimated it would take an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator half a month to heal, but his own Audience with the Celestial Gate technique was exceptionally skilled at grinding away foreign dharma power. It would likely take him only two or three days.

He examined it closely, then raised his other hand and swiped it across the back of the first, slicing off the afflicted piece of flesh. He held it up, studying it for a moment with a thoughtful expression before letting it merge back into his hand.

'For a typical Purple Mansion cultivator, if a part of their Dharma Body sustains too much damage, they can simply discard it and mold a new one. It's just a matter of which method is less time-consuming. But since I can suppress and nullify the damage, direct healing is usually faster. Other Purple Mansion cultivators likely have their own methods.'

With that thought, he descended. Below, cultivators moved to and fro. Not wishing to cause a scene with the requisite kneeling and bowing, Li Ximing casually veiled himself with an illusion and walked straight past the crowds.

He arrived before the main hall just as Kong Guxi was stepping out. The man named Fu Yuezi followed dutifully behind him, a golden spear and a golden axe strapped to his back. Of the other guest elders from the Profound Peak Gate, only a man named Sun Bai was willing to walk a few extra steps to offer some courteous words.

"Sect Master, please wait. Allow me to see to your injuries."

Sun Bai formed a hand seal and began to heal Kong Guxi. Li Ximing glanced over them. Among the Profound Peak cultivators, only Fu Yuezi and Sun Bai were truly presentable.

Sun Bai, a cultivator of the Verdant Grove lineage, specialized in healing and restoration. He had been protected as fiercely as any Li clansman during the battle, so his value was self-evident. As for Fu Yuezi, his Immortal Foundation was the Heavenly Gilded Helm, and he possessed considerable skill, enough to be ranked on the same level as Ding Weizeng within the Li clan.

Kong Guxi had performed exceptionally well in the great battle, advancing and retreating with sound judgment, but he had also sustained grievous wounds. Li Ximing naturally had to see him. He let his form become visible. Kong Guxi had been speaking politely with Sun Bai, but when his eyes caught the coalescing celestial light, he was so startled he immediately dropped to his knees.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

A wave of kneeling spread through the area. The Jade Court Guards on both sides dropped their polearms and knelt, the weapons clattering crisply on the ground.

"Rise," Li Ximing acknowledged.

The moment Kong Guxi saw him, the anxiety in his heart vanished completely, replaced by a surge of joy. The deep furrows in his brow smoothed out. But joy was swiftly followed by trepidation, and his face settled into an expression of reverence and submission.

Li Ximing had only recently reached the Purple Mansion Realm, while Yehui was at the mid-stage. Although Kong Guxi knew it was difficult for one Purple Mansion cultivator to truly defeat another, he couldn't help but worry. Seeing Li Ximing's calm demeanor brought him more relief than the successful defense of the wilderness. Yet, with the matter of Mount Jingyi still unresolved, he couldn't help but feel a sense of dread.

Li Ximing’s spiritual sense swept over him, taking in his condition at a glance. The man’s lower body was nothing but a skeleton, an injury inflicted by a Capital Guard Dao lineage that wielded sharp, baleful attacks.

'It must have been the Western Heaven Plateau.'

Kong Guxi himself cultivated the Fool's Mountain Chase, which offered no special resilience to his physical body. Li Ximing waved his sleeve, and the life-giving force of Bright Yang descended upon Kong Guxi. The man felt an itch at his wounds and a warmth spreading through him as his flesh began to regenerate, allowing him to stand firmly on the ground once more.

The power of Bright Yang could restore flesh and blood, but not one's cultivation. Still, it spared Kong Guxi the effort of taking medicine. The Profound Peak's sect master knelt again, his voice filled with gratitude.

"Thank you, Daoist Master!"

Behind him, the wounds on Fu Yuezi also began to close. However, his Immortal Foundation refined his Dharma Body to be ferocious in battle, which also made injuries harder to heal. The momentary recovery was only skin-deep; he would need to reforge the damaged parts later. He lowered his head and knelt alongside Kong Guxi.

'This one is utterly loyal,' Li Ximing noted. He had observed Fu Yuezi earlier. The man fought with true ferocity and had risked his life to save his fellow Profound Peak cultivators.

Li Ximing paused. Though he held out little hope, he still had to ask, "What is the situation at Mount Jingyi?"

Kong Guxi could only recount the news he had received. Li Ximing shook his head, thinking grimly, 'Shanji Prefecture is lost.'

Kong Guxi was still fraught with anxiety. Though the blame couldn't be laid at his feet, he maintained a fearful posture.

"I will make a trip to Mount Jingyi when the opportunity arises," Li Ximing said casually. "In the meantime, I need to borrow your Wood Virtue guest elder for a while."

Sun Bai was competent and his Immortal Foundation was useful. The Li clan's own Funan territory was a wreck, with everyone wounded. It was a request Li Zhouwei might find awkward to make, so Li Ximing made it himself.

His dismissal of the Mount Jingyi matter was a great relief to Kong Guxi. At the request to borrow Sun Bai, Kong Guxi pressed his forehead to the ground. "Daoist Master jests," he said respectfully. "Before his passing, our patriarch instructed that we are to obey all of your commands. Never mind Guest Elder Sun, all of the Profound Peak Gate's affairs are subject to the Daoist Master's will. This junior has no right to object and no desire to overstep. I only await your immortal command."

Li Ximing had long known the man was obedient and easy to manage, so he wasn't surprised. His gaze swept over the crowd. "The battle is over for now. All of you, go to the Xuanmiao Temple. Don't be shy with Sumian."

He transformed into a ray of celestial light and vanished, leaving the members of the Kong clan staring at each other. Kong Guxi, who was laughed at during Changxi’s death, had no real desire to go to the Xuanmiao Temple. But his people's injuries were truly severe, so he had no choice but to lead them there on the wind.

Meanwhile, Li Ximing phased into the main hall. Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up, and he stepped down from the main seat. Before he could speak, Li Ximing laughed heartily. "Such a magnificent display of power."

Li Zhouwei knew he was referring to the matter with Guan Kan. He chuckled in response and summoned an attendant. "Bring Miaoshui here."

Only then did he turn back to Li Ximing. "As expected, that Yehui was no match for you, Daoist Master. The old master sent me three consecutive letters. I can finally give him a proper reply."

Li Xuanxuan was back at the lake, but his thoughts were still on the riverfront battles. Li Ximing nodded with a smile. Li Zhouwei hadn't brought the matter up for no reason. He immediately followed up with a sigh. "Unfortunately... Elder Siwei was captured. I sent men to intercept them, but once Situ Mo left our territory, he retreated into his mountain gate and hasn't moved since. We sent messengers to inquire, but the Golden Tang Gate has given no response..."

"The master mentioned this repeatedly in his letters. I don't know how I should answer him."

'An Siwei captured...'

Li Ximing felt a headache coming on. Though An Siwei's strength was lacking and he had no special Dao lineage, he was a loyal retainer who had served for many years. The An family had intermarried with the Li for a century. In truth, An Siwei's status was no different from that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator with the surname Li.

He understood Li Zhouwei's meaning and said gravely, "We must first get a clear picture of the situation. If An Siwei is still at the Golden Tang Gate, or if he's been sent west, we might have a chance through the Golden Feather Sect. But if he was sent to the White Ye Immortal Sect... then things will be much more difficult."

Li Zhouwei nodded with a thoughtful look. "When I fought that Guan Kan, I reached a critical moment and a White Qilin phenomenon manifested. It saved me, but it also accidentally killed him. I have no idea what his status is in the Capital immortals Dao."

Li Ximing hesitated for a moment before Li Zhouwei continued, his expression serious, "Regarding the Profound Peak Gate, while our clan did act out of friendship, from another perspective... for all the powers surrounding them, this was nothing more than a feast to divide the spoils."

"The Capital immortals Dao came south. Whether they gained much or little, they still profited. The Xuanmiao Temple and our Moongaze Lake, who helped the Profound Peak Gate, were in a sense also encroaching. There were no losers in this great battle. The only thing that happened was that the Profound Peak Gate's centuries-old foundation was served up on a platter..."

He shook his head, a hint of unease on his face. "From Guan Gongxiao's attitude, the battle on the river was about flexing muscles and showing strength, to see who would get a bigger share. But now, a man with the surname Guan is dead. I'm afraid Guan Kan has some important bloodline or background. If this incites a true war between our two sides, that would be real trouble."

Hearing Li Zhouwei's analysis, Li Ximing nodded slightly. He had sensed something similar from Yehui's attitude. 'Compared to his callousness toward Changxi, Yehui seemed to maintain an ambiguous attitude of not wanting to completely fall out with me from start to finish... It seems that to these Purple Mansion cultivators... the lives of certain Foundation Establishment cultivators aren't worth a frown.'

The two conferred for a moment, and Li Zhouwei set the matter aside. "Besides," he added, "I revealed my phenomenon. I fear it has been noticed by those with ill intentions, which is not a good thing."

Li Ximing nodded and sighed. "Now I understand why these Purple Mansion cultivators need to raise capable Foundation Establishment subordinates. If we had one or two more skilled players, you wouldn't have had to enter the fray yourself! How are your injuries?"

"They are severe, but not debilitating."

Li Zhouwei's wounds were not light, but they didn't affect his daily functions.

"Have Sun Bai come see you," Li Ximing instructed. "Tomorrow, I'll take a trip to the Eastern Sea. I'll hunt some demons and refine their essences with the clan's treasure medicines. I'll have you healed in no time. Once you've recovered, take the Talisman Pill and enter seclusion. Your priority is to break through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment."

After settling these matters, Li Ximing looked around to ensure no one was listening in the Great Void, then spoke via a secret voice transmission technique.

"Regarding the Talisman Qi conferment, what are Minghuang's thoughts?"

Li Zhouwei had been wanting to ask about this. He seized the opportunity and replied, "Daoist Master, now that you've reached the Purple Mansion Realm, has there been any change in your Talisman Qi?"

Li Ximing paused for a moment, then shook his head. "None. It's the same as always. It can manipulate fire and draw in Qi to refine my dharma power. Before reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, I rarely fought, so I was the least skilled among my brothers at using the Talisman Qi. Furthermore, my Audience with the Celestial Gate technique can already command fire, so for the moment, I can't discern its full capabilities."

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment. "This junior's thoughts are as follows... First, the clan's Purple Mansion grand array has not yet been constructed. The ritual to request the Talisman Qi is a major event that will attract a lot of attention. Many Purple Mansion cultivators are watching our clan because of me, so it's best to be cautious. If we absolutely must do it, it should at least be performed at the Profound Peak Gate's mountain."

"There is another point..." Li Zhouwei hesitated, then continued in a low voice, transmitting his words with dharma power. "Since this junior is about to reach the late stage of Foundation Establishment anyway, wouldn't the ability of the Talisman Qi to enhance cultivation be wasted? Why not wait until... this junior also breaks through to the Purple Mansion Realm. With two Daoist Masters in our clan, plus our immortal artifact, could we not plan a trip to the Southern Borderlands or the Four Seas to bring back a Purple Mansion demon..."

"At that time, we could also observe the differences in its various mystical properties... Perhaps this method could even aid in cultivating divine abilities... Used unexpectedly, it could even become a trump card."

"A Purple Mansion demon?!"

Li Ximing had never considered such a possibility. He was genuinely stunned. Having reached the Purple Mansion Realm himself, he knew how difficult it was to corner and kill a cultivator of that level. But as he thought it through, he realized that while difficult, it wasn't a reason to dismiss Li Zhouwei's idea. After all, the Talisman Qi for a Foundation Establishment cultivator could still advance one's cultivation. It would be better to use it to advance a divine ability than waste it on the final push to the late stage...

"Good..." he nodded repeatedly. The two of them reined in their thoughts just as Qu Bushi requested permission and entered from outside the hall.

"Greetings, Clan Head, Daoist Master," he knelt. "I have brought the Daoist Miaoshui."

Behind him was a sturdy-looking stone coffin. The old man opened the lid, revealing a woman lying within. Her body was severed into three parts at the neck and waist. Her abdomen was empty, with nothing but a shriveled heart left in her thoracic cavity.

"Daoist Miaoshui was cut into three pieces. Although we managed to neutralize the dharma power at the wounds in time and gave her a Wanling Flower, her life was still hanging by a thread. The Clan Head had Guest Elder Sun piece her back together... and with the secrets of my Palace of Concealed Storage art, we barely managed to preserve her."

The old man, though cunning and better at fleeing than fighting, possessed a compassionate heart. He frowned at Miaoshui's state and pleaded, "I have gotten to know her over the years because of matters related to the water veins. Though she had a rough past in the Eastern Sea and her dharma power isn't perfectly pure, she's a good child and has always been well-behaved..."

Li Ximing glanced at Miaoshui and nodded. "As long as she is not dead."

He took a pill from his sleeve and placed it in Miaoshui's abdomen. A ray of celestial light shone down from between his brows, and the life-giving force of Bright Yang bloomed. Miaoshui's complexion immediately turned rosy. She gasped, then suddenly sat bolt upright, her eyes looking around in a daze.

After a few breaths, she climbed out of the coffin, her clear eyes welling with tears. She kowtowed. "Thank you, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing gave a slight nod, a hint of surprise in his eyes. Having hovered at the edge of life and death, Miaoshui's gaze seemed clearer, her entire disposition transformed. As tears streamed down her face, Li Ximing said, "Your injuries were too severe. Your Juque Palace was damaged, so you will be unable to cultivate any related techniques or spells. Breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm is now impossible. Wait for some time. If an opportunity arises, I will help you heal your Juque."

Miaoshui wept uncontrollably. Having been hacked into three pieces, she had experienced the slow process of her own death, a torment and shock others could not comprehend. She simply kowtowed again. "Thank you, Daoist Master, for saving my life. I no longer hope for divine abilities, nor do I have any wondrous arts to cultivate. To be given a new lease on life is a fortune beyond words. All else is meaningless. I only wish to return to my mountain and see my parents, to embrace them and weep."

Li Ximing's expression was complicated. Li Zhouwei nodded and dismissed the two of them.

"Weizeng was a pillar of strength at Funan," Li Zhouwei said. "He fought many opponents at once and retreated with grace. If not for him and the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, we might have had to abandon Funan for a time. He is now severely injured."

He swept a hand across the tabletop, and three Dharma Artifacts materialized. All of them shimmered with brilliant light, their edges smooth and their inscriptions complex. They were clearly items of the highest quality among Dharma Artifacts.

Li Ximing nodded in approval. "The Capital immortals Dao has operated in the Eastern Sea for so many years and took a hefty prize from the northern bank of the river. They're truly swimming in wealth," he chuckled. "With these three Dharma Artifacts... our losses at Funan and in the wilderness are practically negligible!"

He was being conservative. The life of a single Foundation Establishment rogue cultivator from the Eastern Sea might not even be worth one of these items. The Profound Peak guest elders who died at the hands of the Capital immortals Dao were certainly not as valuable as these artifacts!

Li Zhouwei smiled. "It is precisely because these Dharma Artifacts are so powerful that they will take a long time to refine... at least a month or two for each."

"That's simple." Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He gathered his divine power and dharma power in his mouth and blew gently. A bright light washed over the three items, and his divine ability instantly refined them. The celestial light lifted each one into the air.

The string of small, cold iron rings that Guan Kan had used was the first to react. There were eighteen silver rings in total, each no bigger than a fist and inscribed with the pattern of Pit Water. "This is the Pit-Metal Encircling Chain," Li Ximing said casually. "A high-grade Pit Water Dharma Artifact, primarily for binding and entanglement. It cannot compare to the Profound Punishment Talisman or the Profound Insight Screen, but it's on par with Minggong's Crimson Flame Brazier."

# Chapter 737: A Claim from the Sword Gate

Li Zhouwei had been ensnared by the Pit-Metal Encircling Chain before. Fortunately, he had managed to suppress it with his immortal foundation in a surprise move, otherwise, he would have been in for a world of trouble.

"This artifact may not have much destructive power, but its ability to restrain is exceptional," he said. "It would be particularly effective against cultivators with potent Dharma Bodies. One or two people might be enough to trap such an expert."

Li Ximing nodded. While these items were of little use to him, they were treasures for a Foundation Establishment cultivator. "Its primary function is binding, which makes it quite useful," he replied. "However, our clan has no cultivators who have reached Foundation Establishment through the Pit Water virtue. The only one even remotely close is Miaoshui."

"Although she contributed greatly in the battle, many others were injured. The Pit-Metal Encircling Chain is a valuable artifact, and to award it so casually would be poor stewardship. Let's store it for now and bring it out when it's needed in a future conflict."

Li Zhouwei put the artifact away and picked up the dark, unassuming Capital immortals Dao Bell. As his spiritual sense swept over it, a hint of surprise crossed his face. "It's imbued with Pure Qi."

Pure Qi was one of the most common Daoist lineages among rogue cultivators, especially in Jiangnan. Eight out of ten of them followed the path of the Lesser Pure Spirit Qi. Most of these cultivators never advanced beyond Embryonic Breathing, and it was common for a single Dharma Artifact to be passed down through three generations. Consequently, there was an abundance of Pure Qi artifacts for those at the Embryonic Breathing stage.

While Pure Qi cultivators were numerous at the lower levels, their numbers dwindled significantly at the Foundation Establishment realm, though they still represented a notable portion. Li Ximing, however, had never even heard of a Purple Mansion Daoist Master from the Pure Qi lineage. Foundation Establishment artifacts of this path were equally scarce, and the few he had seen were crudely made. This was the first time he had encountered one of such high quality.

He turned the black bell over, examining it closely. The materials, the refining techniques, the array patterns etched upon its surface—all were of a contemporary style. Li Ximing frowned. "How strange. Guan Gongxiao, the esteemed young master of the Capital immortals Dao, goes to the trouble of refining and nurturing a Dharma Artifact, yet he chooses to use Pure Qi instead of his own sect's Capital Guard..."

He exchanged a look with Li Zhouwei. "It seems there's some connection between the Capital Guard and Pure Qi. Interesting."

The Pure Qi lineage had no significant strengths or weaknesses against other paths, but this Capital immortals Dao Bell was of a higher grade than the Pit-Metal Encircling Chain, nearly rivaling the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner. Li Ximing let Li Zhouwei keep it for his own use before finally turning his attention to the small mirror.

The mirror was only the size of a palm, with an ancient bronze hue. Its twin-ringed frame was intricately carved with depictions of various beasts in motion. Though it was the most ornate of the three items, its quality was the lowest, and the craftsmanship was not particularly skilled. Li Ximing gave it a glance and said, "A Dharma Artifact, the Bronze-Winged Brightwhite. The frame is made from Virtue-Edict Bronze, and the mirrored surface is White Crane Lapis, a material from the True Qi lineage. The artifact isn't very old. It must have been specially prepared for our family's Profound Light users."

Li Zhouwei had little interest in this item and planned to pass it down to Ding Weizeng, so he tucked it into his sleeve for the time being.

"That old fox Yehui..." Li Ximing finally mused. "I wonder what game he's playing. I should deal with the matter of Shanji Prefecture quickly. Then there's the issue of Xiaoshi Mountain... I ought to pay a visit to the Chengyun Gate."

He mounted his Profound Light and vanished into the Great Void, leaving Li Zhouwei alone in the hall. After a moment of contemplation, Li Wen came to report, his face still pale. He entered the hall and knelt.

"Patriarch, a messenger has come from the Old Master to ask if there has been any progress regarding An Siwei's situation. The Old Master says that Elder An returned to the lake without a word, and we cannot let his heart grow cold."

An Siwei had been captured by the Golden Tang Gate, and that coward Situ Mo was holed up and refusing to show his face. Unless a Purple Mansion Daoist Master personally made the trip, there was little Li Zhouwei could do. He could only send back a message expressing the Daoist Master's concern and dispatched someone with the news.

He stood with his hands behind his back and asked Li Wen, who was still in the hall, "The Old Master asks about this daily. Such frequency... are the letters coming through the Jade Court?"

Li Wen served in the Jade Court and was the most knowledgeable on this matter. "There is no record of it in the Jade Court's logs," he answered. "It must be that the Old Master sent a personal confidant to the East Shore first."

Li Zhouwei's suspicions were confirmed. The East Shore was currently managed by Li Jiangxia, who was Lady An's son. It was this young man's people who were rushing back and forth. He simply tapped his brush on the desk. "He certainly is anxious."

Li Wen bowed his head, pretending not to hear.

"Send a reply through the Jade Court," Li Zhouwei instructed. "Make it clear to the Old Master that the Golden Tang Gate would not dare harm a clan elder, nor would the Golden Feather Sect. Even if he had fallen into the hands of the Capital immortals Dao earlier, he might have suffered a bit, but his life would not have been in danger."

"What is a monumental crisis for a Foundation Establishment cultivator is nothing more than a single sentence, a single game piece, to one at the Purple Mansion realm. Tell him not to worry."

After dismissing Li Wen, he finally began to tend to his wounds.

The main injuries Li Zhouwei had sustained in the great battle were to his head. His forehead had been fractured in two places. Though the external flesh had healed, an injury that affected the bone was not so easily mended. His other wounds were from the water chains he'd endured while taking Guan Kan's life, but those were healing quickly with the help of medicinal elixirs.

---

Li Zhouwei had only been recuperating in the hall for a dozen days, occasionally pausing to reply to messages, when Kong Guxi and the others unexpectedly returned.

Sumian had kept his word. The Xuanmiao Temple had put forth a genuine effort. The injuries of the Profound Peak Gate cultivators had greatly improved. Those with minor wounds were almost fully recovered, and even the heavily injured would be restored after a year or so of seclusion. Kong Guxi, however, wore a grim expression.

Li Zhouwei summoned Li Chenghui and questioned him in detail. He learned that the Xuanmiao Temple had already constructed a courtyard on the mountain where Changxi had passed away. They had even given it a name. Because it directly faced Lake Xian, it was called Gehu Peak—the Peak that Wards off the Lake—with the meaning that hardship, like the vast lake, was to be kept outside the temple's gates by this peak.

It was difficult to say whether this was a gesture of goodwill or an assertion of dominance. The Kong Clan was at its most vulnerable and had to rely on the Xuanmiao Temple for healing. Kong Guxi had naturally worn a fawning expression when he went there, but upon returning to the wilderness, he fell silent.

After Li Chenghui finished his report, Li Zhouwei responded, "It's not necessarily a bad thing that he's displeased. It might even be his way of demonstrating loyalty. In any case, send someone to placate him. We will need the Xuanmiao Temple's healing services again in the future, so we can't allow the Profound Peak Gate members to become too resentful."

The Xuanmiao Temple, after all, followed a Treasured Earth Dao lineage and possessed considerable expertise in healing. Neither Li Ximing nor Li Zhouwei would easily let go of such a valuable resource.

Li Cheng acknowledged the order and withdrew. As light and shadow shifted in the hall, Li Zhouwei had just finished healing a patch of skin when Li Ximing tore through the Great Void and descended.

In his hand, he held a horned beast, no larger than a calf, bound tightly by the Profound Light. Despite its size, its aura was ferocious. Though it was immobilized, its eyes glared with untamed fury.

Li Ximing casually tossed the beast to the floor and smiled. "It's truly difficult to find an unaligned demon general these days. I searched along the river, all the way to the State of Wu. I asked a local clan for information and found this creature in the middle of devouring people. It had the misfortune of running into me."

He then produced a jade box from his sleeve and opened it. Inside lay a spirit grass that shimmered like fine jade. Without pausing, Li Ximing knocked the horned beast unconscious. "The Purple Smoke Gate gifted us the _Tome of Adamant Flame Alchemy_," he explained. "The alchemical techniques within are quite beneficial to me. It even includes a Purple Mansion pill recipe called the Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill, which is said to help overcome karmic trials."

"This beast follows the Pure Qi lineage, which is perfect. And with this Jade Lingzhi Clear Orchid from the Shen Clan, one batch should yield six pills—enough for all of you."

It was the first time Li Zhouwei had heard the name of a Purple Mansion-level pill. As he pondered it, Li Ximing shook his head. "This medicine is life-saving for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but for someone at the Purple Mansion realm, it's merely for healing injuries. It's a common-grade item among Purple Mansion treasures. If it were truly exceptional, they wouldn't have given it to our family."

An ordinary alchemist would take three to five months to refine a batch of healing pills that used treasured herbs. But with his divine ability, Li Ximing could forgo a cauldron for many common elixirs. This particular pill would only take him three to five days. "I can now refine any pill below the Purple Mansion level with my divine ability," he continued. "The Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill isn't much more difficult. I'll have someone deliver it to you in a couple of days."

No matter how common it was, the elixir was still potent enough to heal a Purple Mansion Daoist Master. The Purple Smoke Gate's gift was not a light one. Li Ximing sighed. "It takes far too long for a demon beast to reach Foundation Establishment, and you can't just catch one whenever you want. It's no wonder the Daoist lineages of Jiangnan favor using humans for their alchemy."

As the two were discussing matters, Li Chenghui returned, entering the hall with a sense of urgency. His expression was somewhat awkward, and he only spoke in a low voice when he drew near. "Patriarch, Daoist Master... someone from the Sword Gate has arrived. They say they've come to the Profound Peak Gate to claim something."

"The Sword Gate? Myriad Radiance?"

This was a development no one had anticipated. Li Zhouwei was genuinely stunned. "Who is it? And what are they claiming?"

Li Cheng shook his head. "I've already arranged for them to be guided to a side hall and have summoned Kong Guxi and the others."

"Let them come up," Li Ximing said.

He immediately withdrew. Li Zhouwei rose from the main seat and moved to the side. The members of the Sword Gate entered the hall, led by the sword cultivator Cheng Jinzhu.

The longsword on his back seemed to hum with sharp intent, and his gaze was piercing. He first bowed to Li Ximing before clasping his hands in a salute. "Greetings, Daoist Master. Since our parting at the sword peak, my own Daoist Master has often spoken of you. He bade me to first extend his well-wishes."

"There's no need for such formality." Li Ximing had a good impression of Lingmei. After their conversation, he had found him to be far from the rigid traditionalists he imagined from the Sword Gate; he was actually quite agreeable.

Cheng Jinzhu did not waste time. After a few polite inquiries about their well-being, he got straight to the point. "This junior has come today on a certain matter... Senior Changxi once borrowed a Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain from my sect. He pledged that upon his death, he would return the southern shore of Lake Xian, along with the nine eastern towns of Shanji Prefecture. The time has now come for these to be returned."

His words fell into a stunned silence that enveloped the hall.

Though the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate was renowned for its integrity, Cheng Jinzhu's statement left Li Zhouwei, and even Li Ximing, momentarily speechless. A heavy quiet descended upon the hall.

The reason was simple: there had been no news, not even a whisper, of such an agreement. Neither Changxi nor Kong Guxi had ever mentioned it. It was only Myriad Radiance's stellar reputation that gave them pause; had it been any other sect, they would have immediately assumed it was a shameless act of opportunism, kicking a man when he was down.

After a noticeable pause, Li Ximing finally spoke. "Go and bring Kong Guxi up."

A few dozen breaths later, the middle-aged man hurried into the hall. He paid his respects to Li Ximing and the others before noticing Cheng Jinzhu. Kong Guxi's face showed no hint of suspicion, only a desire to curry favor. "Greetings, Daoist Cheng!"

By now, even Cheng Jinzhu looked puzzled. He glanced at Kong Guxi tentatively and said, "Greetings, Sect Master..."

A sense of suspicion grew in Li Zhouwei's heart. He smiled. "Sect Master Kong, this is an old matter concerning your Profound Peak Gate. The Cheng clan has come to retrieve something."

"Ah?"

Kong Guxi was completely lost. Seeing the situation in the hall, he had assumed the Li Clan was handing over Shanji Prefecture to Myriad Radiance and he was just here to witness the outcome. He never expected such a sudden turn of events, and a sense of unease washed over him.

Cheng Jinzhu had no choice but to repeat his statement. Kong Guxi's eyes widened in disbelief. Cheng Jinzhu even added, "The Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain is a dharma treasure our sect obtained from the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven. It is no ordinary item. The sect wishes to make use of it now, so I have come to inquire."

'A dharma treasure!'

A wave of bitter grief crashed over Kong Guxi. He raged internally. 'Fine, just fine! Everyone wants to kick us while we're down. But you, Myriad Radiance Sword Gate, you are a noble lineage of the Green Pine and Supreme Yang Dao! How could you be so cruel as to throw stones at my family? If you want our territory, just take it! Where would we possibly get a dharma treasure for you?'

But circumstances were stronger than he was. Let alone the Profound Peak Gate's current decline, even at the height of their power, the Kong Clan would not have dared to offend Myriad Radiance. Beads of sweat formed on his brow as he cast a pleading gaze toward Li Zhouwei.

Cheng Jinzhu was not slow to notice. He immediately sensed something was wrong. "Sect Master, can it be that you were unaware of this matter?"

'What does it matter if I was or not? If the Daoist Master says it exists, then it exists...' Kong Guxi saw that the members of the Li Clan remained silent and could only stammer, "Perhaps... perhaps there was such an arrangement... This territory is to be yielded to the Sword Gate..."

An odd expression flickered across Cheng Jinzhu's face. "Sect Master Kong, where is the dharma treasure?"

With the conversation at this point, Li Ximing had to intervene. "This involves a dharma treasure, a matter of great importance," he said. "The Sword Gate may take possession of the pledged territory for now. As for the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain, I have not yet seen it. Let us set the matter aside for the moment. The Profound Peak Gate can cede a few more towns as payment to continue leasing the dharma treasure. If you have an urgent need for it, I will discuss the matter in detail with Senior Lingmei."

Whatever Myriad Radiance's motives were, and whether this agreement was real or not, having someone take over a portion of Shanji Prefecture was a good thing. Li Ximing decided to lock it in. Cheng Jinzhu was in no position to negotiate with Li Ximing, but fortunately, his master had given him instructions beforehand. He spoke with a serious tone, "Since the Daoist Master has spoken, this matter will be arranged by Moongaze Lake. My Sword Gate understands that the Profound Peak Gate is at a critical juncture. The Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain may be of extreme importance to your esteemed sect. We are not a lineage that preys on the vulnerable. My master said long ago that if it is a matter of the Profound Peak Gate's survival, its return is not absolutely necessary."

Li Zhouwei, however, recalled something. "Your esteemed sect may send men to take control of Shanji Prefecture, but Lake Xian is now in the hands of the Xuanmiao Temple. To cede the southern shore, you will have to speak with Daoist Master Sumian."

"Clan Head," Cheng Jinzhu replied with a steady smile, shaking his head. "My master sent a letter yesterday. The Xuanmiao Temple has already complied. In fact, Daoist Master Sumian came to our sword peak to offer his apologies to my master, but he was not present. He was received by Daoist Master Qi and sent back."

The statement revealed the staggering status of the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate. Yet, both Kong Guxi and Cheng Jinzhu seemed to take it as a matter of course. Li Ximing's eyes narrowed slightly as understanding dawned.

'Is it because of Lingmei's supreme strength and unparalleled swordsmanship, or is it that the status of the Green Pine Dao lineage... is far more revered than we imagined?'

'In the Yue State, whether it's the Three Sects and Ten Gates or the subsequent Seven Gates, these powers rise and fall. Yet the six Dao lineages of the Chongming Palace have endured without fail. How could that be a coincidence?'

# Chapter 738: The Profound Peak Gate

The thought was a fleeting spark in Li Ximing's mind, yet it ignited a deep well of questions.

‘If that’s true… the kinship between the two major sects and the four minor gates might be far closer than I imagined. If Jiangnan’s entire Dao lineage truly originates from Green Pine Island, what does that signify? My breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm was met with obligatory congratulations and the custom of visiting the three great families. Are these traditions merely the rules and restraints of Jiangnan… or are they a form of power, a privilege exclusive to the region’s dominant forces?’

After a moment of contemplation, he gave a slight nod. In that instant, the eastern territories of Shanji Prefecture, the heartland of the Profound Peak Gate, were ceded. Kong Guxi could only feel a sense of relief that Li Ximing had agreed at all.

Though Cheng Jinzhu was privately bewildered, he was content that his mission for the gate was complete. He knew better than to prattle on in the presence of a Daoist Master. "The dharma treasure was borrowed by the former sect master, Kong Tingyun, when she accompanied the Daoist Master," he explained. "It seems the current sect master is unaware of the details. It's possible some arrangements were never formally passed down."

Li Zhouwei’s ears perked at the mention of Kong Tingyun's name. He raised an eyebrow. "And what miraculous properties does this dharma treasure possess?"

Cheng Jinzhu considered this for a moment. "I have never seen the dharma treasure itself," he admitted. "I only heard that within the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven, it was used as a decoration at the foot of a mountain. When it reveals its true form, it is said to be as vast as a mountain itself, snow-white and translucent. It can awaken spiritual potential, clarify the mind, and calm the spirit."

Li Ximing committed this to memory and exchanged a look with Li Zhouwei before changing the subject. "I once spoke with Daoist Master Lingmei about array formations. Do you have any news on that front?"

Several of the Purple Mansion cultivators Li Ximing had visited had mentioned this matter, so Cheng Jinzhu was prepared. "Daoist Master Lingmei has already sent a letter to an old friend at sea," he replied. "But the response was that his friend is in seclusion and won't be available for the foreseeable future."

He paused briefly. After Li Zhouwei dismissed Kong Guxi, Cheng Jinzhu continued in a lower voice, "There is also Daoist Master Tinglan of the Purple Smoke Gate. Their lineage excels in array formations. While she may not be able to lay down a new Purple Mansion array from scratch, she is skilled at adapting what already exists. She could move and modify a pre-existing grand array… its power might shift, but it would remain at the Purple Mansion level."

The implication was immediately clear to everyone present.

‘He’s talking about the Profound Peak Gate’s grand array!’

Li Ximing signaled his understanding, and Cheng Jinzhu took his leave. Once the hall was empty, Li Ximing spoke. "Minghuang, the story from the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate doesn't sound like a lie. I've met Lingmei. Although his ideals clash with those of the Myriad Radiance elders and he yearns for reform, he doesn't seem like the type to resort to such schemes."

Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement. "This affair has little to do with our family, but it should be investigated swiftly. Regardless of whether the claim is true or false, the Sword Gate must not be allowed to lay the blame at our door."

After all, the Li family currently had no dharma treasure to offer as compensation.

Li Ximing let out a breath. "That old fox Changxi… he wouldn't speak the whole truth even on his deathbed. I'll make a trip to the Profound Peak Gate. The description of that dharma treasure sounds like it possesses an Earth Virtue. It might be aiding Kong Tingyun in her breakthrough."

Li Zhouwei's earlier question about Kong Tingyun had hinted at this very possibility. Seeing that Li Ximing had caught his meaning, he nodded and saw him off, watching as his figure rode a beam of Profound Light and vanished into the Great Void.

---

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain, the cauldron before Li Ximing trembled softly as a current of Pure Qi ascended. With a slight shudder of the lid, six dark yellow pills shot out.

He caught them in his palm. Each Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill was the size of a longan, smooth and without any distinct markings. A refreshing fragrance wafted from them as Li Ximing carefully placed them into a jade bottle.

Petals rained down from the trees on the mountain, carried by the wind, creating a carpet of shimmering white on the ground. He admired the sight for a moment before his form reappeared on the southern face of the mountain.

In a depression on the mountainside, what was once a small pond had transformed into a Baleful Earth spring. Dark red baleful energy surged forth, purple flames dancing upon its surface, all contained within the pond by a white array formation that circled its edge, causing the energy to pool like water.

Li Ximing beckoned lightly with his hand.

_Splash!_

The surface of the pool stirred. The liquid condensed from Baleful Earth and purple fire rippled violently, and a palm-sized vase flew out from its depths.

The vase was a fiery reddish-purple, its surface covered in patterns like fire-forged glass. As it landed in Li Ximing’s hand, he immediately sensed its state.

‘This vase has been tempered by my Bright Yang Purple Fire and has absorbed a great deal of Li Fire. It’s nearing saturation.’

This pool was a Baleful Earth fire meridian born from his ascension to the Purple Mansion Realm, dominated by Bright Yang Fire, Li Fire, and Baleful Earth. While potent, the overwhelming baleful energy made it unsuitable for alchemy. The Profound Pattern Vase, however, could absorb the Bright Yang Fire and Li Fire from the meridian and refine them. Every six months, Li Ximing would retrieve it for this purpose.

Ignoring the amount of flame stored within, he circulated his arts and his Bright Yang divine ability. In less than an hour, he had completely refined the flames inside. A quick inspection revealed their power was already considerable, even among Foundation Establishment cultivators.

‘What a peculiar artifact.’

To this day, Li Ximaging could not identify which Dao lineage the vase belonged to. His own tempering with Bright Yang and Li Fire was still far from reaching its limit, clearly indicating the vase had much greater potential.

‘I wonder if it can be refined into a spirit embryo. It would be a shame to waste it. I’ll keep tempering it for now and use other materials for my projects.’

While Li Zhouwei and the others stood guard in the wilderness, Moongaze Lake was a hive of activity. Li Jiangqian had mobilized the entire workforce around the lake to construct a high platform next to the Inherited Clarity Gate, one of the six gates surrounding the lake.

This was no ordinary platform; it was a grand sacrificial altar required for the technique known as _Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire_. A quick glance told Li Ximing it was already more than half complete.

‘Once this is settled, I’ll visit the Profound Peak Gate first, then take a trip to the Chengyun Gate. They’re our neighbors, after all. It’s been long enough. I can also try asking about Xiaoshi Mountain.’

Tossing the Profound Pattern Vase back into the pool, Li Ximing slipped into the Great Void and departed without delay, materializing in the wilderness outpost.

Li Zhouwei was not in the main hall. Instead, Li Chenghui and Kong Guxi were discussing something. Li Ximing tossed the bottle of pills to Li Chenghui, then grabbed Kong Guxi by the collar and vanished.

The poor man was terrified, but fortunately, Changxi had taken him through the Great Void before. He managed to steady himself within the beam of Profound Light, his heart still pounding. He cupped his hands. "Daoist Master…"

Before he could continue, a nod from Li Ximing silenced him. Moments later, they dropped back into the physical world, arriving at the Profound Peak Gate in Shanji Prefecture.

Night had fallen, but the gate was still marked by a white halo of light shimmering in the sky, faintly outlining the peaks within. But unlike the bustling hub it once was, the entire mountain range was now utterly still. It was like a dead mountain, with not a single streak of light rising or falling.

A bitter taste filled Kong Guxi’s mouth as he heard Li Ximing’s command.

"Open the array."

"Yes!"

He untied the token from his waist and aimed it at the barrier. Forming a seal with his hands, he projected a brownish-yellow light. After a slight delay, the grand array parted, revealing a narrow opening. Through it, they could glimpse a jade-like gate and the warm glow of yellow lanterns.

The instant the gateway appeared, Kong Guxi felt the ground vanish beneath him. Below, dark mountain ranges twisted and undulated, dotted with shimmering lights. A few solitary figures moved about, their escape lights streaking across the sky like shooting stars.

He had seen this view countless times. They were now above his own sect. Li Ximing’s back was to him, the newly ascended Daoist Master staring intently at the immortal pavilions below, filling Kong Guxi with a sense of bone-chilling dread.

He shrank back, tucking his hands into his sleeves as he followed Li Ximing on a tour of the grounds. He heard the Daoist Master’s voice, filled with admiration.

"Your gate possesses a profound foundation and excels at moving mountains and reshaping the land. This entire area is brimming with potent spiritual energy, home to many unique spiritual mountains… It contains five of the Twelve Qi and eight of the Five Virtues, including three types of Earth Virtue. Remarkable… truly remarkable!"

The Profound Peak Gate might have lagged behind other immortal sects in some respects, but its collection of spiritual mountains was second to none. For centuries, Changxi had worked as diligently as a mole preparing for winter, relocating one mountain after another to this place. The resulting domain was incredibly tempting.

‘No wonder Yehui covets this mountain gate so fiercely. His White Ye Immortal Sect was only recently established. Acquiring a foundation like this would save him centuries of effort!’

Li Ximing completed his circuit. The gate was nearly empty of disciples. Only the main hall showed some signs of life, where his own junior, Li Jianglong, was engrossed in a jade slip, surrounded by stacks of books taller than he was.

Li Ximing nodded slightly but decided not to reveal himself. After touring the entire area and inspecting its various secret realms, he found nothing that remotely resembled the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain.

He finally came to a halt before the Profound Peak treasury. He paused, then turned, hands clasped behind his back. "Sect Master… are you certain the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain is not within?"

Kong Guxi, who had already guessed his purpose, fell to his knees. "I have never known of any Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain! If I am concealing even a shred of the truth, may I be struck down and my Dao perish this instant!"

Li Ximing hadn’t really expected Daoist Master Changxi to leave a dharma treasure of that magnitude sitting in the treasury; there would have been no need for secrecy if that were the case. "Take me to the seclusion grotto," he said.

The color drained from Kong Guxi’s face, but he bowed his head respectfully. "Which… which Daoist Master do you wish to see?" he asked in a low voice.

"Kong Tingyun," Li Ximing replied casually.

Kong Guxi simply nodded. He led the way, weaving through the mountains and deactivating illusion arrays with his token. After a series of twists and turns, they entered a spiritual mountain from below and passed through another illusion array, finally arriving at a grotto.

Standing on a stone platform inside, Kong Guxi used his token to activate the final mechanism. A tightly sealed stone door materialized on the grotto wall. Without another word, he collapsed to the floor, curling into a ball.

Li Ximing understood his meaning perfectly. If he insisted on searching for the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain, the sealed chamber would have to be opened. And once that door was unsealed, Kong Tingyun’s life would be forfeit.

He didn't enter. Instead, a puzzled expression crossed his face as he considered the situation.

‘Cheng Jinzhu said that when the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain is activated, it’s as large as a mountain. It’s highly unlikely it could be hidden in a small secret chamber… and even if it could, I would have sensed it easily.’

He paced back out of the grotto. Behind him, Kong Guxi kowtowed repeatedly. After they had left the area, Li Ximing was still unable to solve the puzzle.

Evidently, the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain was not within the Profound Peak Gate. Daoist Master Changxi had used some unknown means to secret it away as a contingency. Since he hadn’t told Li Ximing about it, finding it now would be exceedingly difficult.

‘He promised the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate the southern shore of Lake Xian and the eastern lands of Shanji… The intention couldn’t be more obvious. It was Changxi’s way of setting up his legacy. That being the case, the old fox surely had a plan for where to leave the associated Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain.’

Li Ximing could only depart with regret, making a mental note of the situation.

‘Daoist Master Lingmei specifically mentioned that this matter wasn't urgent. Changxi lived for over four hundred years; he wouldn't have pinned all his hopes on me. I’ll wait and see how things develop.’

He also held the secret of the demon embryo obtained from Sumian. These were matters that required careful investigation and could not be acted upon rashly, lest they backfire.

‘No matter how much of a gentleman Sumian appears to be now, he’s still a veteran Purple Mansion cultivator. If I push him too far, he’ll become a threat every bit as dangerous as Yehui.’

As he exited the mountain gate, Kong Guxi followed behind, dazed and lost in thought. Li Ximing set him down at the edge of the wilderness. "Send a few people back to search," he instructed. "If you can't find that dharma treasure, you'll have a hard time explaining things to the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate."

Kong Guxi could only nod meekly. His appearance was a reflection of his spirit; in just over a month, his hair had rapidly turned gray. Where once he had the look of a young man, he now looked thoroughly middle-aged, even showing signs of frailty.

Li Ximing gave him a second glance. It suddenly struck him how uncannily similar he looked to Li Xuanxuan during the years he was plagued by his inner demon. They were two completely different people, yet their expressions of despair made them appear almost the same.

‘Every family has its own troubles… when times are hard, no one’s burden is lighter than another’s.’

He withdrew his gaze and journeyed north through the Great Void. As he approached the borders of the Chengshui Marsh, the fabric of the Great Void became noticeably more turbulent.

‘Such incredible fortune,’ Li Ximing mused. ‘The most vital part of all Jiangbei is the Chengshui Marsh, and he has devoured it all for himself.’

Breaking back into the real world, Li Ximing saw a vast, shimmering marshland spread out before him. From the sky, countless dark cypress trees stood tall within the waters. A gentle breeze rustled through their leaves with a soft, whispering sound.

"Chengshui Marsh…"

A complex look entered Li Ximing’s eyes. This place was a famous great marsh, its depths hiding the bones of countless cultivators from both the north and the south. He swept the area with his spiritual sense.

‘The Chengshui Marsh was once a land of Converging Water, yet the Wood Qi here is so vigorous that all these cypress trees managed to grow despite the flooding. Compared to Moongaze Lake… this is more akin to a true marshland. Perhaps in another hundred years, it will evolve into a treasured land of Water Mansion.’

All things in the world were in a constant state of flux; nothing remained unchanged. Moongaze Lake was deeper, and the main body of the lake was elementally aligned with Pit Water, making it very stable. Otherwise, the remnants of the Lingyu Gate would not have chosen it as their refuge back then. The shores around Moongaze Lake were closer to Water Mansion marshlands, with water levels similar to Chengshui Marsh, though their spiritual energy was far inferior.

Li Ximing streaked across the sky, materializing above a bustling marketplace in the Chengshui Marsh.

The Li family also had an outpost here. Years ago, his junior Li Quewan had needed elemental spiritual energy for her Qi Refining, which was gathered from the marsh. They had used a shop in the marketplace as a cover, and the family still maintained a presence here.

‘I believe the He family is in charge of this place.’

Li Ximing formed a hand seal. The array protecting the marketplace was practically nonexistent to him. He passed through it via the Great Void and landed inside.

After all, not even the Golden Feather Sect, let alone the Chengyun Gate, was extravagant enough to protect a marketplace with a Purple Mansion grand array. To a Purple Mansion cultivator, more than ninety percent of the markets in Jiangnan were completely undefended. Li Ximing looked down at the bustling, lively crowd below.

He swept his spiritual sense across the area, and the cacophony of voices became crystal clear in his mind.

‘Minghui Lianmin of the Lotus Temple is leading her fellow monks… to debate the Dao with the Daoist Master of Chengyun here in the Chengshui Marsh?’

# Chapter 739: The Bait

'Minghui… the name sounds so familiar…'

When the name reached Li Ximing’s ears, a flicker of recollection crossed his face. For a Purple Mansion cultivator, even the faintest memory could be instantly recalled. Realization dawned.

"Ah, he was with Murong Xia!"

Years ago, when Murong Xia had traveled south to seek his Dao, he had avoided the path through the Sword Gate and Xiukui territory, likely fearing he would provoke the Daoist Master of the Spirit Pine. He also steered clear of the Profound Peak and Purple Smoke Gates, probably to avoid being struck down by Daoist Master Zipei. Instead, he took the route through the Azure Pond Sect, which led him straight to the Li clan's domain after crossing the river.

A minor conflict had erupted between Murong Xia and the Li clan. Li Tongya had made a move, only to be intercepted by a master monk from Lotus Temple. That monk’s name was Minghui—undoubtedly the same person from the rumors.

'We’ve had our disagreements, and my clan's enmity with the Buddhist cultivators has only deepened since. It’s best if I avoid him.'

He was about to step into the Great Void when a figure rose from the market below. The man was white-haired and dressed in black robes, giving him a rather sinister appearance, though his expression was respectful. He flew forward and bowed.

"By order of my ancestor, I have been waiting for you, Daoist Master. He has been at the Yebai Pavilion for some time. Please, follow me."

Li Ximing glanced at the man, a strange thought crossing his mind.

'A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator can see me? Changyun must have guided him… I wonder what wondrous art he used to grant him this sight.'

'But I've never heard of Daoist Master Changyun possessing any skill in the art of calculation… How could he have known I was coming? Even if he couldn't divine the exact movements of a Purple Mansion master, he must have at least foreseen an arrival related to me. His divination skills are astonishing.'

He withdrew his gaze, letting it rest on the black-robed elder for a moment before asking, "Daoist Friend Changyun’s calculation arts are truly impressive. He knew I would be the one to visit."

The elder, still visibly nervous, hurried to respond. "To answer the Daoist Master, my ancestor only passed down an order that a certain Daoist Master would be visiting today. He did not specify who it would be…"

That sounded far more plausible to Li Ximing. Since Changyun had already sent someone, he saw no point in turning back. "Lead the way," he said simply.

The black-robed elder bowed immediately and began to lead the way. Li Ximing watched him for a moment, the Profound Light between his brows pulsing faintly. He spoke, as if in passing, "I see that Chengshui Marsh is rich with spiritual Qi and abundant in spiritual resources. It seems like a fine place to nurture talent. I imagine many notable figures have emerged in recent years!"

The elder dared not neglect a Daoist Master's question. "Indeed, Daoist Master," he said quickly. "Several cultivator clans have risen in Jiangbei in recent years, and many rogue cultivators have successfully established their immortal foundations before scattering to the north and south. Some of the northern orthodoxies have even sent people to Chengshui Marsh to gather Qi."

"Oh?" Li Ximing’s interest was piqued. "Since the spiritual Qi is so abundant and the land is teeming with talent, I assume the blood-based arts from the Eastern Sea are no longer in use?"

The elder nodded vigorously. "Precisely. The sect master and the Daoist Master issued a decree long ago. We are no longer the sect we were in the Eastern Sea; we are a thoroughly righteous and orthodox sect now. Not only have all those who practiced blood arts been dispatched to guard the Eastern Sea, but even those whose demonic techniques were less severe have reined them in. Our disciples now venture out to slay demons and subdue evil, and they've purged the area around Chengshui Marsh until it's spotless. Demonic cultivators have been all but eradicated."

"Now, the common people are all migrating to our Chengshui region. We’ve built quite a reputation in Jiangbei, and our Chengyun Gate is the most famous of all for exorcising demons and defending the righteous path!"

A sycophantic smile spread across the elder's face. "Daoist Master, feel free to ask anyone here, whether they are rogue cultivators, clan cultivators, common folk, or our own disciples. They will all tell you that the Chengyun Gate is the foremost righteous sect in all of Jiangbei!"

Li Ximing's heart was a tangle of complex emotions. For this man to make such a guarantee in his presence, the conduct of Chengyun Gate must truly be impeccable.

But what these rogue cultivators and common people didn't know was that Chengyun Gate was a sect founded by a gathering of demonic cultivators. Now, after several decades, a new generation of disciples—talented Qi Refining cultivators from Jiangbei itself—had been trained to solidify their power. And somehow, they had become a beacon of righteousness.

'In another fifty years, who will remember that the ancestors of Chengyun Gate were a band of depraved demonic cultivators who fed on human flesh?'

'Their disciples, their descendants, their bloodlines—they will all carry themselves with honor, slaying evil and defending the Dao, never knowing what came before… And what of Chengyun Gate itself? Will the demon-slaying Chengyun Gate become an irreproachable righteous sect?'

His gaze darkened.

'Who will remember the sins of the ancestors who built their legacy on demonic arts? Who will care? Do the good deeds of their descendants not count as good deeds? And yet, those good deeds are built upon a foundation of their ancestors' slaughter and cannibalism…'

Regardless of his thoughts, Li Ximing understood that with Zhong Qian's influence, Chengyun Gate was destined to become the foremost righteous sect of Jiangbei. They would be comparable to the Sword Gate or Hengzhu. The stories of demonic cultivation, of killing people to refine pills from their blood—all of it would be buried beneath the endless mounds of their victims.

'These old demonic masters, who spent their lives devouring humans, can now spend a century absorbing spiritual Qi on their peaks, reinvent themselves as righteous elders, and who would ever question it? The grateful citizens under their rule? The rogue cultivators they rescued? The descendants of Chengyun Gate themselves will forget.'

'The line between good and evil is hopelessly blurred. This is the perfect example.'

Mount Yebai.

Mount Yebai was the highest point in Chengshui Marsh. The marsh had once been the site of the Ning Kingdom's imperial mausoleum, and Mount Yebai was its very center. After occupying the area, the Chengyun Gate had built a pavilion on the summit, naming it Yebai Pavilion after the mountain itself.

Though called a pavilion, the structure was expansive, with winding corridors and interconnected halls. The main pavilion was astonishingly large. Seated within was a young man of average appearance, dressed in a long robe of black and white feathers with intricate dark patterns. Beneath it, a soft, high-collared white armor was visible. A saber hung at his waist, and he held a jade gourd in his hand.

Across from him sat a kindly-faced, slightly portly monk in a brownish-yellow robe. He was studying a jade cup with a smile.

"Daoist Friend Changyun! If my calculations are correct, our fellow Daoist will arrive within the hour."

Daoist Master Changyun's gaze remained fixed on the jade gourd in his hand. After a few moments, as if sensing something, he finally spoke. "Daoist Friend Minghui’s calculation arts are truly remarkable."

The monk, Minghui, let out a chuckle. "Although this old monk failed to attain the rank of Maha, I did not leave empty-handed. I have achieved the state of Non-Retrogression beneath the lotus seat of the Maha's Pure Land. A position is reserved for me above. With a little more time, becoming a Maha is well within my reach!"

Daoist Master Changyun paused slightly before replying, "You are truly blessed with good fortune, my friend. How many master monks could ever hope for such a fate? You are the first disciple of a lotus-rank Maha and an emissary to the south. Back when the Yue Cultivating Sect marched north and the Shangyuan intervened, the Jinlian Maha swallowed his pride and even sacrificed the lives of other Merciful Ones just to secure you the title of 'Peace-Bringer.' With such support, becoming a Maha is a certainty!"

Minghui smiled. "That's because my master has completed his eighth reincarnation. He is now an eighth-life Maha. The Way of Joyful Bliss is flourishing, and a seat has opened up in the Pure Land. That's the only reason I have this chance…"

"Look at that Master Monk Xuwang from the north-south conflict," the monk continued with a laugh. "The Way of Emptiness had no seat for him, so he stubbornly refused to become a Merciful One. He had to slaughter countless cultivators from the Azure Pond Sect at Mount Bianyan just to achieve the state of Non-Retrogression, and even then, he only reached the Golden Lotus Seat—the same as me…"

"In the end," he concluded, "I have my Maha master's high regard to thank for everything!"

Daoist Master Changyun was inwardly unimpressed. He had little fondness for monks, but Minghui's backer, Jinlian, was an eighth-life Maha, and Minghui himself was destined for the same rank. He couldn't afford to be dismissive. He smiled and nodded just as a voice drifted in from outside the hall.

"Daoist Master, please!"

Both men raised their heads simultaneously to see a figure enter.

He was a young man in a white Daoist robe embroidered with golden patterns. His features were handsome and conveyed a gentle, warm temperament. Between his brows, a point of Profound Light faintly pulsed.

Daoist Master Changyun was taken aback for a moment. Sensing the Bright Yang divine ability emanating from the man, he asked tentatively, "Daoist Friend Zhaojing?"

Li Ximing clasped his hands in a salute and smiled. "Greetings, Daoist Master Changyun!"

At these words, Changyun immediately rose from the main seat and descended with a smile. "That boy Zhong Qian told me you would be paying a visit. I have been waiting and waiting. Finally, you've arrived!"

Zhong Qian not only had a karmic connection with Li Xuanfeng but was also exceedingly polite to the Li clan. He had shown them great respect during the establishment of their Purple Mansion. Li Ximing was naturally courteous in return, mirroring Changyun's smile. Changyun gestured for him to take a seat at a side table and then indicated Minghui.

"This is Daoist Master Zhaojing of the Moongaze Li clan."

Minghui had merely lifted his head for a cursory glance, remaining seated with a lazy posture. Li Ximing's aura was clearly that of a newly advanced Purple Mansion cultivator; there was no need for excessive courtesy.

'Oh… another immortal clan… Moongaze Li…' he thought dismissively.

"Moongaze Li?!"

The monk's eyes widened in shock.

Changyun had already turned back to Li Ximing to make the next introduction. "This is Minghui, a Merciful One from Lotus Temple. He has achieved Non-Retrogression in the Way of Joyful Bliss and is seated beneath the Golden Lotus. He is destined to become a Maha."

Among the seven Buddhist paths, the Way of Joyful Bliss had the least conflict with the Li clan. Still, Li Ximing felt no goodwill toward any of the northern Buddhists and expected none in return. He managed a polite expression.

Across from him, Minghui fought the overwhelming urge to turn and flee. A terror no one else could comprehend gripped him, and an icy chill shot through his veins.

'By the Merciful Revered One… it’s _that_ Li clan!'

Years ago, when Minghui had traveled to Moongaze Lake, a single attempt at divination had nearly cost him his life. He had sacrificed his most precious Dharma Treasure to escape, and the backlash had even implicated his master, Jinlian!

Minghui was certain that no one in the world understood the full story better than he did. Jinlian himself had no memory of the event and had only heard Minghui's vague, terrified account, which was horrifying enough. But Minghui had witnessed it firsthand—he had seen how fragile the seventh-life Maha Jinlian had been in that entity's hands, as helpless as a mortal.

The incident had left Minghui with a permanent shadow on his soul and had inflicted a wound on Jinlian so severe that it had derailed their subsequent plans. Ultimately, it had caused Minghui's own attempt to reach the Maha rank to fail.

For a master monk of the Seven Phases, the path forward was twofold: either become a humble Merciful One or take the great leap to become a Maha. The former was already incredibly difficult. If one could curry favor with a Maha, they might have a chance, first attaining the rank of Merciful One under the lowest-ranking Bodhisattva seat. From there, it was a life of fawning and begging, hoping for a sliver of favor from above to slowly elevate one's state of Non-Retrogression and perhaps snatch an empty seat.

The latter was a near-impossible feat. It required the blessing of immense fate, significant contributions to the Buddhist faith, an available seat within one's own Pure Land, and the support of a Maha. Only then could one even attempt the path to Maha.

Jinlian's injury had been to his soul and divine abilities, directly shaking his Maha seat. Fortunately, Minghui's foundation was deep, and Jinlian, within his Pure Land, gave him his full support. Minghui had to settle for second best, first attaining the rank of Merciful One under the highest Golden Lotus seat. If not for that, all his preparations would have been wasted, adding centuries to his cultivation.

Minghui and Jinlian had long ago reached a silent agreement to never speak of the matter. Minghui even had a nagging suspicion that Jinlian's fervent support was partly an attempt to pull an ally onto his sinking ship. Now, facing Li Ximing, he didn't dare be too friendly, nor did he dare be hostile.

Li Ximing had been prepared for a cold reception. To his surprise, the monk before him sat up straight, a beaming, sincere smile on his face.

"So it is Daoist Master Zhaojing! This humble monk is Minghui! I've admired you for a long time!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow in surprise. Minghui immediately followed up, "I was not always in the north. I traveled south in my early years and had the honor of crossing paths with one of your esteemed clan elders. I was so moved by his magnificent presence that my admiration for him knows no bounds!"

Li Ximing's expression turned strange. Changyun, finding the exchange amusing, explained, "After the Wrathful Manifestation fell, this Merciful One's Way of Joyful Bliss benefited greatly, and their Pure Land expanded. However, they have some friction with the Way of Emptiness—a dispute left over from the north-south conflict."

Li Ximing understood now. This monk was an enemy of the Way of Wrath and the Way of Emptiness. 'So, while most Buddhist cultivators are utter filth, this one clearly doesn't stink in the same way as the others,' he mused. 'And he's destined to become a Maha. No wonder Changyun is willing to meet with him.'

He gave a slight nod. Minghui smiled and said, "I calculated it long ago. I knew a Daoist friend would be visiting Daoist Friend Changyun today. He was still half in doubt…"

Daoist Master Changyun nodded, clearly wanting to steer the conversation away from his original discussion with Minghui. He interjected smoothly, "I underestimated the Merciful One's calculation arts. But I wonder… is there some matter you wished to discuss with me, Daoist Friend?"

Li Ximing naturally wanted to ask about Mount Xiaoshi, but he was wary of Minghui learning about it unnecessarily. He chose his words carefully. "It concerns the lineage of the Brahma Cloud Cave."

Minghui, sitting to the side, let out a hearty laugh to bolster his courage. "Ah, so it's about Mount Xiaoshi!"

A smile finally touched Changyun's lips. He poured tea and explained, "Everyone who knows of the Mount Xiaoshi affair is entitled to a share. There are benefits to be had from the formation. Since you, Zhaojing, have mastered the Floating Cloud Cave's lineage, you naturally have a claim. Mount Xiaoshi was breached by the Way of Emptiness, and it was originally a refuge for the Yue Cultivating Sect—a situation we allowed to happen. Therefore… the northern Buddhists are also aware of this."

Understanding began to dawn on Li Ximing. "In that case," he asked, "how is this formation to be opened?"

"Mount Xiaoshi is now a desolate wasteland, its heirs scattered. None of us wish to see that lineage re-established, which is why the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion were created. The key to opening the formation lies within those three sects."

Changyun took a sip of tea. "The secret arts of Mount Xiaoshi are divided into five lineages. Three of them became the current Three Sects of Secret Diffusion: the 'Floating Cloud Body,' the 'Hurricane Ghost Yin,' and the 'Empty Response Dispersion.' If the remaining two lineages can be gathered, the treasures of Mount Xiaoshi can be accessed."

Li Ximing pondered this for a moment before asking pointedly, "Are you saying that many of Mount Xiaoshi's lineages are scattered abroad?"

"Precisely!" Changyun laughed casually, but his next words carried a chilling weight. "Your guess is correct, Zhaojing. The Three Sects of Secret Diffusion are merely hooks. The remaining two lineages of Mount Xiaoshi are scattered to the four winds, their whereabouts unknown, but it is highly likely they are in the Eastern Sea."

"As long as the reputation of these three sects remains in Jiangbei, flying the banner of Mount Xiaoshi's secret arts, the descendants who inherit those lost lineages will eventually return once they achieve success. Whether it's to complete their heritage, find their kin, seek refuge, or simply find backing—for sentiment and for reason, they will have to come back."

"They are the bait we've cast into the river. All we have to do is wait for them to take the hook!"

# Chapter 740: A Detailed Account

"I see."

Changyun was the one holding the fishing rod, so of course, he knew the situation best. Hearing his explanation, Li Ximing understood that these Purple Mansion cultivators only answered what they were asked. If he failed to consider every angle, he would have no right to a share of the spoils.

"So, the Hurricane Ghost Yin Dao lineage from Wenhu is in my hands," Li Ximing said. "And you, fellow Daoist, have been cultivating Pingwang Zi in preparation for opening the formation. It seems I'll have to raise one of my own people for this."

Changyun let out a hearty laugh. "That's easily settled. The Wenhu you have... he once searched the Southern Sea for a Secret Diffusion Dao lineage on behalf of the Capital immortals Dao... This was before the Capital immortals Dao had even entered Jiangbei, yet their search had already begun! It's clear they've been plotting this for a long time..."

Li Ximing's eyes narrowed slightly. "Oh? And what was the result?" he asked, looking up.

"They found another with the Floating Cloud Body! The Capital immortals Dao kept it under a thousand layers of secrecy, and very few people know about it. I only learned of it when I overheard another Daoist mention it in passing. In the end, they didn't gain much... but the person who obtained the lineage was thoroughly deceived by Wenhu and ultimately perished, his Dao erased! It's likely every secret art he possessed was tricked out of him!"

Li Ximing knew Wenhu was no simple character. By his calculations, the Floating Cloud Cave had been an ally of the Golden Tang Gate, which meant it was part of the Golden Feather Sect's share. Now that the sect had been annihilated, the matter was complicated.

"These three Dao lineages... how many factions are dividing them?" he asked.

Changyun seemed to see right through his concerns. "The Golden Feather Sect already claimed the Floating Cloud Body lineage; it was one of their own disciples who was cultivating it. The Empty Response Dispersion is Pingwang Zi's technique, so that share is mine... And the Hurricane Ghost Yin belongs to the Capital immortals Dao, who also possess a Floating Cloud Body. A few other factions have been waiting quietly in the wings, but the situation is now uncertain."

He glanced at Li Ximing and smiled. "It's not as if only one person can claim a share from each lineage. The Xiaoshi Spirit Trove was prepared by the former Secret Diffusion Temple for its descendants. Any Foundation Establishment cultivator who has practiced the lineage can go and try their luck. The size of one's share depends on the individual. A single powerful direct heir is worth more than ten useless fools."

"Fortunately, this opportunity has fallen into our hands," Changyun added. "It benefits our own people and can be considered a money tree."

Clarity dawned in Li Ximing's mind.

'So many opportunities... so many schemes. The Xiaoshi Spirit Trove of Secret Diffusion can only be entered by those who possess its Dao lineages, so it has become a treasure basin for several major powers...'

Having pieced together the cause and effect, Li Ximing finally asked, "I've often heard that the Secret Diffusion Temple had a powerful backer. Do you know which one it was?"

This was apparently not a great secret. "Secret Diffusion is a remnant of the Wanling Upper Sect," Changyun explained. "The Wanling Upper Sect was a power on the level of the Three Sects, and to this day, its Grotto-Heaven remains hidden within the Great Void."

"Ah!" Li Ximing understood immediately. "But given Secret Diffusion's background, won't stirring up such trouble lead to disaster?"

Changyun shook his head gently, but it was Minghui who chuckled. "Daoist Zhaojing! How can you be certain... that this wasn't a method left behind by the Secret Diffusion Temple to ensure its own continuation? Year after year, if one of these cultivators truly reaches the Purple Mansion realm, or if some unforeseen event allows them to escape the control of the Daoist Masters... wouldn't they have a perfectly legitimate claim to monopolize the Secret Diffusion Spirit Trove on Mount Xiaoshi? With such a golden, profound background, a prestigious banner, and a foundational Dao... would they not desire it after attaining the Purple Mansion? Could they simply ignore the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage?"

Li Ximing grew thoughtful. Changyun also smiled. "Daoist Minghui is correct. Although gathering all five Dao lineages would yield a great harvest, opening the spirit trove is impossible without the Purple Mansion Divine Ability of the Secret Diffusion lineage. We have divided the trove's contents several times and scoured it clean, but the remaining Purple Mansion section requires a much longer-term strategy. It's not something to be taken lightly."

With a clear picture in his mind, Li Ximing began to plan his next steps. After offering his thanks, Daoist Master Changyun said, "There is no need for such formalities! I think very highly of the boy Zhong Qian. He has forged a bond with your esteemed clan through Ning Tiaoxiao, and there will be many opportunities for mutual support in the future."

Li Ximing exchanged a few more pleasantries, listening as the two discussed who had broken through to the Purple Mansion realm and who had accumulated enough merit to become a Merciful One. Just as he was about to take his leave, Minghui spoke with great enthusiasm. "My Lotus Temple is just across the river! If the Daoist Master has any need for anything in the north, you must come find me!"

Changyun, taking this in, sipped his tea and said with a hidden smile, "I say... Daoist Minghui, you are a Merciful One and exceptionally skilled in the arts of calculation. Why not perform a divination for our fellow Daoist and offer him some tangible assistance?"

The words struck Minghui like a blow, and he gritted his teeth, a sharp pain stabbing at his heart.

'Divination? Divination my ass... You want me to risk my life with your constant 'divine this, divine that'... You sure have a lot to say!'

Though he desperately wanted to slap Changyun, he forced a dry laugh. "I cannot simply perform a divination on a fellow Daoist directly, and I fear he would not be at ease allowing me to do so..."

There was some truth to this. Li Ximing harbored no goodwill toward any of them and had already intended to refuse. He followed Minghui's lead and demurred. After several more cups of tea, he grew tired of their polite maneuvering and excused himself.

He had just stepped out of the pavilion when he saw the monk Minghui emerging as well. Unwilling to get entangled, Li Ximing stepped into the Great Void, but Minghui followed him.

"Daoist Zhaojing! Might I be so bold as to say one more thing?" Minghui called out, catching up to him in the void.

Since the other man had pursued him so persistently, Li Ximing felt he couldn't just keep avoiding him. "Great Master Minghui," he replied, "what can I do for you?"

"It is just one matter," Minghui said. "A friend of this humble monk has obtained a Dao lineage and wishes to become a Merciful One. To do so, he must construct a grand temple, a luxurious Dharma Treasure, but he lacks a single ingredient: Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, which is produced in the Southern Borderlands of the Azure Pond Sect... Si Boxiu despises Buddhists, making it difficult for me to go there. You, fellow Daoist, have connections in the Azure Pond Sect. If you have the chance, I would be grateful if you could keep an eye out for it..."

Li Ximing, curious to see if the monk could cross the river, traveled alongside him through the Great Void and gave a noncommittal reply.

Minghui continued, "My Lotus Temple is, after all, in the north. I have a Bright Yang Spirit Embryo. If you can acquire the wood, I am willing to trade it."

Li Ximing still did not trust the monk. Even with the mention of a Bright Yang Spirit Embryo, his response remained perfunctory. As they neared the Funan region, Minghui abruptly changed the subject. "I mentioned a divination earlier. It was not my intention to slight you, but I knew you would not permit me to perform one. How about this: instead of a disciple or a blood relative, choose a retainer with no significant connection to you. The divination will be easier and more detailed for me, and it will not put you in too difficult a position!"

Li Ximing glanced down at the land below. The Funan region was densely populated, and all these people were in Jiangbei. Whether he agreed or not, Minghui could perform a divination on them at will. "If that is the case," he said cautiously, "and you wish to perform a divination yourself, I have no reason to stop you."

He didn't dare let him divine An Siwei, who was currently his highest priority. Instead, he chose the person with the most tenuous connection. "My clan has an old retainer... his name is Qu Bushi."

Minghui's gaze pierced through the Great Void. With just a name, he located the man. He first calculated the man's Dharma artifacts to gauge the karmic consequences of the divination, and only when he was certain it was safe did he proceed to divine the man himself.

"He nurtures his life and preserves his years, growing stronger with age," Minghui said thoughtfully. "His fate is constrained by Pit Water, preventing him from taking a leading role, but he is a useful retainer."

Li Ximing, however, was paying attention to Minghui's position. Just as he'd expected, the monk stopped at the river's edge.

"I will see you this far."

With that, Minghui vanished into the Great Void. Only then did Li Ximing ponder his words.

'That monk was surprisingly courteous. Qu Bushi is ultimately just a retainer. His Art of the Palace of Concealed Storage excels at self-preservation, and he still has many years left to live. In the future, he'll become another elder like An Zheyan.'

Descending from the sky, Li Ximing found himself with a rare moment of leisure. Instead of returning to Gardenia Scenery Mountain, he flew toward the island.

In the center of the island's vast courtyard stood a white flowering tree, over thirty zhang tall. Its leaves were so glossy they appeared transparent, casting no shade beneath. The tree was dotted with palm-sized, five-petaled spirit flowers, their colors a mixture of crimson and white.

The Wanling Flower Tree!

Seated cross-legged beneath the tree was an old ape with snow-white fur, clad in simple stone armor with a staff resting on its knees. As Li Ximing approached, the White Ape opened its eyes, stood, and bowed respectfully. "Greetings, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing nodded. The White Ape's first task upon joining the Li clan had been to guard the Wanling Flower, a duty he had now performed for over seventy years. After the great battle on the river, he had returned here to recuperate and continue his watch.

Li Ximing gazed at the Wanling Flower Tree. Over the years, his clan had harvested at least eight hundred, if not a thousand, spirit stones from its flowers, not to mention the cultivators whose lives had been saved by it... even Miaoshui had relied on it just a few days ago!

"Even the scraps that fall from the fingers of a Golden Core immortal's descendant have benefited my clan immeasurably!"

On the other side of the courtyard stood another tree, this one the size of an ordinary tree. It was a Spirit Persimmon Tree, suffused with spiritual energy. It had been twisting and swaying in its corner, but the moment it saw Li Ximing looking over, it froze.

This was, of course, the Spirit Persimmon he had dug up from the Quanwu Mountains. Though its roots were ordinary, this Qi Refining-level tree had been blessed with no small amount of fortune. It had already become a spirit, possessing a cultivation base. It would occasionally nibble on spirit herbs and sip spirit water, and had now reached the mid-stage of the Qi Refining realm.

The Li clan also had a Snake-Dragon Fruit Tree, but it was of a lower grade and was kept in the island's spirit garden.

After observing them, Li Ximing retrieved a box from his sleeve and casually opened it. Inside lay a brilliant golden tassel needle of Horn Woodthe Horn Wood Golden Tassel gifted by the Sword Gate!

"This is an excellent item for nourishing spirit plants..."

The moment the box was opened, the Wanling Flower Tree began to stir. The Spirit Persimmon in the corner dropped its pretense and stretched its branches over, not daring to touch Li Ximing, but tugging furtively at the White Ape.

Li Ximing infused his divine ability into the tassel. With a wave of his hand, he broke the Horn Wood Golden Tassel apart, guiding the fragments with the Profound Light to shower down upon the two spirit plants, causing them to rustle with delight.

Li Ximing knew nothing of horticulture. He left the two plants in the White Ape's care and departed.

He landed on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. A short while later, a youth dressed in pleated, dark-red robes descended on a trail of Li Fire. He walked up from the mountain path, arrived at the courtyard, and bowed.

"Jiangqian pays his respects to the Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing had rarely seen Li Jiangqian. He beckoned him closer, offering a warm smile to the junior to whom he had bestowed a Talisman Seed. "Jiangqian is here. Why do I not see Que Wan?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master," Li Jiangqian replied, "my sister has encountered a bottleneck in her arts and has gone to the Northern Yue to collect shamanic techniques. She was unable to come. This junior has come up the mountain to deliver a message on my father's orders."

"Speak."

As Li Ximing poured tea, Li Jiangqian began his report. "The Wu Clan from the south of the Lixia prefecture came to visit a few days ago. Their peak Foundation Establishment patriarch came personally with a gift to thank you, Daoist Master, for eliminating demonic cultivators when you passed by their lands. Father was unaware of this matter and sent me to ask."

Li Ximing knew exactly what had happened. He sipped his tea. "I was fighting Yehui and happened to pass by the Wu Clan's territory. The light of my escape technique probably incinerated one or two of those demonic cultivators. Yehui, who was following behind, likely manifested his own divine ability and crushed a few Wu clansmen in the process. This Wu patriarch certainly knows how to use a bigger banner to his advantage. He's quite shrewd."

Li Jiangqian understood immediately. He showed no fear in the Daoist Master's presence. "I see. We have a Retainer Wu in Profound Peak who is related to the southern Wu Clan. He has been insufferably proud about this..."

"Just explain it clearly to your father."

"The Shanji Prefecture has been attacked several times recently," Li Jiangqian continued. "We were unable to defend the area, and a significant amount of resources were plundered. We also lost a town..."

This did not surprise Li Ximing. The Shanji Prefecture was a burden in their hands. "How is your father handling it?" he asked.

"Father has already begun relocating the people of Shanji to populate the wilderness," Li Jiangqian reported respectfully. "The morale of Profound Peak has not collapsed, and with our clan's support, many prominent families and even aristocratic clans are willing to move. Aside from the Sword Gate's territory, which has been left largely untouched, most of the common folk have begun their journey. Father sees this as a matter of great importance and is personally escorting them..."

"Good." Li Ximing nodded. "It is almost certain that Profound Peak will have to rebuild its foundation in the wilderness. This is a necessary task. Leave it to your father."

He paused for a moment, then asked with a somewhat inscrutable tone, "How is Chengzhi these days?"

His eldest son, Li Chengzhi, was a mortal. Li Ximing had seen him once after reaching the Purple Mansion realm. He had been with his early-stage Qi Refining grandson, Li Zhouming. Both were timid and sweating profusely. Li Chengzhi's hair and beard were completely white, and he hadn't dared to look his father in the eye. He had come up, made a brief circle, and quickly left.

Although Li Zhouming was a cultivator and had been sent to the clan by his father at an early age, Li Ximing's successive periods of seclusion meant they had rarely met. Yet, due to a deeper understanding and fear of the Purple Mansion realm, his behavior had been even worse than his father's.

At Li Ximing's question, Li Jiangqian answered promptly, "Clan Elder Chengzhi is advancing in years and is no longer very active. Clan Uncle Zhouming is currently serving in the Dense Forest Mountains..."

Li Ximing knew there wasn't much good Li Jiangqian could say. Although he was not close to his eldest son, Li Chengzhi was at least thoughtful. His lack of cultivation was his fatal flaw. As for Li Zhouming, Li Ximing had met him himself and knew him to be a truly mediocre child, with a somewhat greedy nature. The fact that Li Jiangqian didn't speak ill of him was already a show of respect; there was certainly nothing worth praising.

His expression unchanging, Li Ximing lowered his gaze slightly. "Let them be. Chengzhi is getting old and may not be able to control Zhouming at times. Do not let them think I am paying them special attention, lest it encourages him to do something foolish."

Li Jiangqian had thought Li Ximing's inquiry was a subtle request to look after them, but hearing this, he could only nod in agreement. A realization dawned on him.

'The Daoist Master is not entirely unconcerned with the clan... These few words strike at the very heart of the two elders' situations. It would be impossible to be so precise without paying some attention...'

Li Ximing waved him away, his mind already turning to other calculations.

'There are three urgent matters at hand. First, the Purple Mansion grand formation. I must wait for news and observe the changes. Second, resolve the issue with the Shanji Prefecture and properly garrison Profound Peak... And third... I must settle things with Yehui, to stop him from constantly working against my clan.'

# Chapter 741: A Cunning Defense

Although the Capital immortals Dao had retreated, their southern advance was a matter of when, not if. Li Ximing could not afford to ignore the threat.

Fortunately, the battle on the river had left its mark. While Guan Gongxiao, Guan Lingdie, and the other core disciples were relatively unharmed, figures like Gongsun Bofan had sustained serious injuries. The Capital immortals Dao’s techniques were not known for their healing properties. Bright Yang cultivators at least possessed some regenerative abilities, but Yehui’s path was likely even less suited for recovery, his only advantage lying in his formidable vital energy.

‘They won’t be making any major moves in the short term,’ Li Ximing mused. ‘Once Shanji Prefecture is dealt with... the conflict in the wilderness will become a prolonged war of attrition. As for what other schemes Yehui is plotting, I’ll have to investigate further.’

‘And then there’s the matter of Wenhu’s Dao lineage...’

Now that he knew the Secret Diffusion Temple had a hidden spiritual repository on Mount Xiaoshi, Li Ximing had no intention of letting the opportunity pass him by.

"Bring Wenhu to me," he commanded.

At his word, Li Chenghuai descended the mountain on a gust of wind and returned moments later, dragging a dishevelled man by the chains that bound him. The prisoner’s hair was a tangled mess, and the iron links clanked with every step, leaving a trail of blood on the ground.

Wenhu had not been subjected to excessive torture in the dungeons, but his cultivation had been sealed, preventing the wounds he sustained over a year ago from ever fully healing. Despite the Li family’s rudimentary medical treatment, the gashes would still weep blood from time to time.

The man was a master of calculation. He had intentionally allowed the Li family to take Hongfu Mountain, a decision that had directly contributed to their ability to defend the Funan territory with minimal casualties. In a stroke of genius, he had managed to avoid earning any deep-seated enmity from the Li clan, lowering his presence to a minimum and surviving comfortably until today. If not for the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion lineage he possessed, Li Ximing might have forgotten him entirely, letting him languish in the dungeons indefinitely.

Looking at him now, Li Ximing could only think that the man’s luck had finally run out. An idea flickered in his mind.

‘After I extract the Dao lineages from him, perhaps I could offer him to Yehui in exchange for An Siwei. Given that this involves Mount Xiaoshi, Yehui might actually agree. Hah…’

His gaze fell upon Wenhu, whose cultivation was sealed and whose lips were bound to prevent him from casting any incantations. Li Ximing illuminated him with the Profound Light from between his brows, then silently dismissed the thought.

‘This man is no fool. And with his connection to the Secret Diffusion secrets of Mount Xiaoshi, handing him over to the White Ye Capital immortals Dao could create a significant threat down the line. Still... better to kill him.’

With a flick of his hand, Li Ximing released the seal on Wenhu's mouth. He remained seated in the position of authority, watching impassively as the man writhed on the floor before struggling to his feet.

"This sinner, Wenhu, pays his respects to the Daoist Master!" he rasped.

Wenhu’s supposed crime was merely "deceiving" a Purple Mansion cultivator—that is, for the absence of Daoist Chidu of the Capital immortals Dao. As the one who had made the promise, the blame had fallen squarely on him. Wenhu had never once proclaimed his innocence, accepting his fate in silence.

Li Ximing said nothing, his gaze fixed on the prisoner.

Deep down, he felt a flicker of appreciation for the man's talents. Wenhu was undeniably cunning and resourceful. But this was a conflict between Purple Mansion masters, a game far beyond what Wenhu could hope to influence.

To a Purple Mansion cultivator, most Foundation Establishment disciples were mere pawns. What truly mattered was face and reputation. Wenhu had been one of Yehui’s men; in Li Ximing’s hands, he was a bargaining chip, but he could never be a chess piece.

If Li Ximing were to brazenly take him in, it would create a true blood feud. Not only that, it would be a breach of unspoken rules. The moment Wenhu reappeared in public, Yehui would be justified in personally tearing through the Great Void to retrieve him.

But that single glance from Li Ximing was enough. Wenhu immediately understood his predicament. The executioner’s blade was already at his neck.

"This lowly one pays his respects to Daoist Master Zhaojing," he said, bowing his head. "The Secret Diffusion lineage never intended any disrespect. I was merely relaying a message under the guidance of a predecessor. I never imagined it would lead to this."

Even as he spoke the words, a bitter taste filled his mouth. He had clearly taken a stand for the White Ye Capital immortals Dao. No matter how he tried to excuse his actions by blaming his lineage or the Floating Cloud Cave, it would be nearly impossible to win Li Ximing’s trust.

As expected, when he shifted the blame to the Floating Cloud Cave, Li Ximing’s expression remained unchanged.

"Where is the lineage of the Dense Cloud Cave?" the Daoist Master asked flatly.

Wenhu’s heart pounded in his chest. He knew his end was near. Sweat beaded on his brow and streamed down his back. But what power did he have against a Purple Mansion master? His only chance, his only breath, came from the fact that this particular cultivator was conservative, perhaps hesitant to damage his own karma by immediately resorting to soul-searching.

But the specific mention of the _Dense Cloud_ lineage sent a shiver of terror through him. A thousand thoughts raced through his mind.

"In reply to the Daoist Master," he stammered, "I can transcribe the Dense Cloud lineage for you this instant. And not just that lineage… Wenhu has also found traces of the other Secret Diffusion lineages of Mount Xiaoshi."

Li Ximing’s expression turned strange. He had an inkling of what Wenhu was about to say, but he frowned at the cultivator’s sharp-wittedness. Unseen, the killing intent in his heart grew heavier.

"Oh?" Li Ximing smiled faintly. "And which lineage might that be?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master," Wenhu answered with utmost respect, "while cultivating in the Southern Sea under Daoist Chidu’s orders, I was tasked with searching for traces of the Secret Diffusion lineages. I found something near Danrong Wuluo... but I concealed my discovery. No one knows of it."

Suspicion bloomed in Li Ximing’s heart. He could already see the outlines of Wenhu’s desperate ploy, but he played along. "And why did you not report this to Daoist Chidu?"

Wiping the sweat from his brow, Wenhu replied, "Daoist Master, having received a Secret Diffusion lineage myself, I am not entirely ignorant of the great masters’ schemes. Therefore, I communicated privately with my fellow disciples and was reluctant to report back to Daoist Chidu…"

"The Dense Cloud lineage," Li Ximing interrupted softly.

Li Chenghuai immediately produced a jade slip. Wenhu had no choice but to take it and begin engraving with frantic speed. A quarter of an hour later, a text titled _The Xiaoshi Manual of Guiding the Netherwind_ was complete.

As Wenhu continued to carve into another slip, Li Ximing casually took the first one, his spiritual sense sweeping over its contents. The Profound Light between his brows pulsed faintly.

‘_The Xiaoshi Manual of Guiding the Netherwind_. It leads to the fourth-grade Foundation Establishment, Hurricane Ghost Yin.’

With his current level of spiritual attainment, Li Ximing could easily discern the authenticity of a cultivation manual. He waited as Wenhu finished a second text, this one titled _The Xiaoshi Art of Clearing the Heavens and Scattering Clouds_. This must have been the one Changyun said was obtained through murder.

‘_The Xiaoshi Art of Clearing the Heavens and Scattering Clouds_… Fourth-grade Foundation Establishment, Floating Cloud Body.’

Li Ximing asked pointedly, "Where did this one come from?"

Wenhu, still sweating, wore a mask of pure terror. "I obtained it from Fu Dou," he said respectfully. "I used certain methods to make him talk quickly…"

A faint smile touched Li Ximing’s lips. "I heard you took the mountain in less than a quarter of an hour. Your methods must be impressive indeed."

The man’s blood ran cold. He presented the jade slip and began to write again. After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, he presented another.

"_The Feathered Adept's Chant_."

This finally piqued Li Ximing’s interest. It was half of a secret art, and it appeared to be quite profound.

Wenhu prostrated himself, his words flowing with practiced ease. "This was passed down to me by my master just before he died. He said a predecessor obtained it from the body of a fallen direct disciple of the Wanling Upper Sect. It is meant to be a powerful defensive art that allows one to weave feathers into a protective robe…"

"As the Daoist Master can surely see, this is likely a Purple Mansion-level technique, somewhere between the fifth and sixth grades. This is only half of it. The rest…"

He looked up, a calculated gleam in his eyes. "Through my own secret investigations, I believe the other half is in the possession of that Secret Diffusion direct disciple in the Southern Sea!"

Li Ximing shot him a look, tucking the jade slip away. He watched Wenhu, who was now trembling in a full kowtow on the floor. His voice was light, almost conversational, but to Wenhu, it was a thunderclap that threatened to shatter his very soul.

"You dare to lie to me," Li Ximing said with an air of profound amusement.

# Chapter 742: Arranging Affairs (Part 1)

"You dare lie to me."

The moment Li Ximing spoke, a purple flame erupted across the mountain, its celestial light illuminating everything. Bathed in the searing blaze, the stone bricks grew scorching hot. Wenhu, his face already pressed to the ground, didn't dare to lift his head as his skin began to sizzle.

The consequences of deceiving a Purple Mansion cultivator were one thing, but to be questioned so calmly by one was a psychological torment of an entirely different order.

Whatever Wenhu was thinking, Li Chenghuai, standing beside him, felt a chill shoot up his spine and into his skull. Even though he wasn't the one lying, fear gripped him.

'Uncle already possesses the aura of a Daoist Master!'

Li Ximing looked down at Wenhu, feeling more amusement than anger. The man's lie had been cleverly constructed, a mixture of truth and falsehood. The Secret Diffusion direct lineage disciple he mentioned was most likely the one who had been lured away by the Capital immortals Dao and tricked to his death by Wenhu himself. This matter involved the Purple Mansion realm and was highly secretive. If not for a passing mention from Chang Yun, Li Ximing would have had no way to confirm it.

Wenhu had based his lie on a real person he had actually been in contact with. This not only guarded against Li Ximing using divination but also ensured the details were accurate—after all, Wenhu knew too little about other Secret Diffusion Dao lineages to invent such a person from thin air.

Had Li Ximing lacked concrete information, Wenhu could have continued his fabrication. But the Li family had Fu Dou's head and had used advanced shamanic arts to determine he was killed in a sneak attack. The revelation of _The Xiaoshi Art of Clearing the Heavens and Scattering Clouds_ was the final piece of evidence that sealed Wenhu's fate.

'In the span of a single breath, he concocted a complete story,' Li Ximing mused. 'If he hadn't been so desperate to prove his worth and offered up _The Xiaoshi Art of Clearing the Heavens and Scattering Clouds_, he might have left fewer loose ends.'

Li Ximing sipped his tea. Wenhu finally lifted his face, a scorched and blackened mess. It was impossible to tell if he was crying. Following a glance from Li Ximing, Li Chenghuai stepped forward, grabbed Wenhu’s chains, and said, "If you had just told the truth, the Daoist Master would have decided your fate. Why go to such lengths?"

Wenhu's eyes opened. They had been burned in their earlier fight and were now completely white. He looked up. "I've spent my life scheming and fighting in the Southern Sea. When I encounter a problem, I plot. If I succeed, it's my victory. If I fail, it's my loss. I have never been one to sit idly by and wait for a 'Daoist Master's judgment.'"

Li Ximing set down his jade cup. "Well said."

The word had barely left his lips when a torrent of celestial light wrapped in purple flames swept over Wenhu. His flesh and bone were torn away and incinerated, turning to ash in an instant. The chains and iron clasps etched with array patterns all melted away, leaving no trace. A moment ago, a Foundation Establishment cultivator had been kneeling there; now, he was gone, dispersed like smoke on the wind.

A faint clatter echoed as a few twisted, scorched pieces of metal—remnants of his shackles—fell to the ground. Wenhu had cultivated the art of Hurricane Ghost Yin, a technique completely suppressed by Bright Yang. The blast had not only killed him but had also erased his cultivation so thoroughly that not even a hint of a spiritual phenomenon remained.

Li Chenghuai, standing to the side, let out a silent breath. Li Ximing placed three jade slips on the table, rubbing his temples. "Chenghuai," he asked, "one art is Hurricane Ghost Yin, the other is Floating Cloud Body. Both are fourth-grade techniques and will be a great benefit to the clan's foundation. See if anyone in the family is interested in cultivating them."

Li Chenghuai considered this. "I will check which of the children are about to begin Qi Refining."

Li Ximing left the arrangements to him, though he knew that no matter which clan member was chosen, they would be too late for the spiritual trove of Xiaoshi Mountain. "The territories of Funan and Midong were taken over after we eliminated their sects and seized leverage over their great families," he said. "We brought some people back. Are there any promising talents from the same cave-heaven who cultivates a compatible Qi?"

"I will look into it, ancestor," Li Chenghuai replied.

He immediately sent someone to fetch the records. A court guard returned shortly with a jade slip, which Li Chenghuai began to read. The benefits of his meticulous administration were now clear; he had obviously kept careful track of these matters. After a quick scan, he reported, "There is one with the surname Wang who cultivates a compatible Qi for Floating Cloud Body; he is in the late stage of Qi Refining. There is also a Guest Elder Huang who cultivates the same art. We have no one with a compatible Qi for Hurricane Ghost Yin."

Li Ximing responded casually, "The Wang clan is a major lineage in Jiangbei, and Wang He still holds a position in the Capital immortals Dao... It's difficult to manage them in Secret Diffusion territory. Since this young man is already in the late stage of Qi Refining, we should support him. It would be best if he could achieve Foundation Establishment. This will also help stabilize the people who migrated from the Funan region."

As he gave the order, he had a premonition. 'It seems we won't be getting much from this spiritual trove. We'll have to treat this as a trial run. It's not a one-time opportunity, so we can plan more carefully once the younger generation rises.'

Li Chenghuai understood and bowed to take his leave. But then he saw the white-robed, gold-patterned Daoist Master close his eyes and exhale slowly.

"Chenghuai," Li Ximing said suddenly, "destiny, talent, and temperament are three things rarely found together. We often believe cultivation and cunning are paramount, but one must also worry... for when luck runs dry, the Purple Mansion is unattainable, and when fate is shallow, Divine Abilities remain a distant dream."

"This junior is enlightened," Li Chenghuai said, knowing his uncle was referring to Wenhu.

"Have the members of the Zhou generation come here," Li Ximing instructed. "And... invite the old patriarch as well."

---

**Mount Qingdu.**

These days, Mount Qingdu was bustling with newly constructed pavilions. Much of the forest had been cleared, transforming the once-secluded residence of a few Foundation Establishment cultivators and direct descendants into the busy peak of the Court of Justice. Streaks of light constantly rose and fell as figures hurried about their duties. Li Quewan's own light descended, landing softly on the mountainside.

The silver-white pendant around her neck gleamed faintly. She wore a thoughtful expression. Now at the seventh level of Qi Refining, she was considered a core member of the Li family. She had just returned from a fruitless trip to the northern Yue mountains, feeling slightly dejected.

'This Shamanic Talisman Dao is truly difficult...'

The _Shamanic Talisman Dao_ was a shamanic art she had obtained from a Talisman Seed. To call it an art was an understatement; it was a comprehensive encyclopedia of shamanism, filled with an astonishing number of techniques focused on three paths: transformation, shamanic talismans, and soul manipulation. Yet, for all its complexity, the tome was organized into just three sprawling chapters, with no clear progression, as if it had been haphazardly bound together.

'It's an ancient cultivation method, I suppose. They valued simplicity...'

Li Quewan dedicated nearly all her energy outside of her primary cultivation to the _Shamanic Talisman Dao_, yet she had barely scratched the surface. On Li Jiangqian's advice, she focused on the transformation techniques for self-preservation, learning little else besides a few divination methods.

The opening line of the text was daunting enough: "Only when the profound is first achieved may one begin the study of shamanic arts." As she had discovered, "first achieving the profound" meant reaching the Purple Mansion Realm.

"In ancient times, you weren't even considered accomplished without a Divine Ability," she sighed. "How I envy them."

Pushing these thoughts aside, Li Quewan focused on her surroundings. She had only visited Mount Qingdu a handful of times, but she held the place in deep reverence.

The Court of Justice on Mount Qingdu had originally managed the mortal affairs of the direct lineage. As more descendants became cultivators and the mortal bloodlines dispersed into the branch families, its staff was expanded to oversee cultivators. Later, as intermarriage with outside families and guest elders grew more common, and the Jade Court began transferring its prisoners to Mount Qingdu for judgment, its authority swelled. The Jade Court still conducted investigations, but its jurisdiction for sentencing and punishment was now limited to the lower-level cultivators of the sixteen prefectures, two peaks, and one mountain. It had gradually become subordinate to Mount Qingdu.

When Li Chenghuai broke through to the Foundation Establishment realm and mastered the art of Untraceable Presence, he gained the ability to discern truth from falsehood among low-grade Qi Refining cultivators. While this had little impact on the family's upper echelons, it was a monumental event for the entire administrative system, helping to root out corruption. He even uncovered wrongdoing among three direct-lineage clan elders, who were subsequently sent to the island under house arrest. This cemented Mount Qingdu's paramount status.

Yet, at the height of its power, one of Mount Qingdu's side peaks remained lush with trees, without a single new pavilion. It was quiet and rarely visited. Li Quewan was respectful as she approached a middle-aged man at the door.

"Please inform the old patriarch," she said politely, "that the Daoist Master has requested his presence."

The man was her own brother. He nodded quickly and hurried inside. Moments later, an old man descended the stairs. His cheeks were sunken, making his face appear thin and gaunt, but it did not diminish his kind expression. His eyes, bright and black, were nestled in a web of smiling wrinkles. His mouth was slightly open, and seeing him made Li Quewan want to smile herself.

"Is the old patriarch in good health?" she asked softly.

"Fine, just fine!" Li Xuanxuan came forward quickly. Li Quewan reached out to support him, but he waved her hand away, looking around eagerly. "Ximing is back? Let's go, let's go! We'll head over right now!"

Today, Li Xuanxuan was likely the only person who dared to call Daoist Master Zhaojing by his given name. Li Quewan rose into the air with him.

"A few months ago... that He Jiumen died of old age," Li Xuanxuan lamented. "He used too much of his vital blood in artifact refinement and only lived to be one hundred and fifty. Such a pity... And his legacy, he couldn't pass it all on to Queyi and the others. The old man didn't even get to die satisfied!"

He Jiumen was an old cultivator from the west bank who had grown close to Li Xuanxuan in recent years. This was the first Li Quewan had heard of his passing. Before she could respond, Li Xuanxuan continued, "Donghe has been silent as a stone at the Jade Court all these years, and An Zheyan is away on a mission. Qiuyang, on the other hand, has let everything go to pilot a boat on the lake. I'm all alone on this mountain with no one to talk to. The few who do come to visit are just trying to use my influence. It's all so insincere..."

After Li Qinghong, Li Xuanxuan was the first elder Li Quewan had followed. Hearing his complaints, she felt a pang of guilt.

"An Zheyan only has a few years left," Li Xuanxuan said, his tone turning indignant, "and they sent him to the north! And after what happened to An Siewen... what's the meaning of this? I'm going to have a good talk with the Daoist Master about it."

In the middle of his words, they descended upon Gardenia Scenery Mountain. At the foot of the mountain, a man and a woman were waiting.

The man was handsome, dressed in pleated robes that shimmered with a golden light like wheat, branching into six streams that moved with the grace of sparrows. The woman was of plain appearance, without makeup, wearing a simple dress with a sword on her back.

"Uncle Zhouluo, Aunt Xinghan!" Li Quewan greeted them.

The two quickly bowed to Li Xuanxuan, their ancestor. He hurried to help them up, giving Li Xinghan a surprised look. "Zhouluo visits me often on Mount Qingdu, so I see him a lot. But Xinghan, I don't believe I've seen you much. Where are you cultivating these days?"

Li Xinghan cupped her hands. "Replying to the patriarch, Xinghan cultivates on the northern shore of Moongaze Lake. The cliffs there are steep and excellent for practicing swordsmanship."

Though her appearance was unremarkable, her voice was as crisp and clear as melting snow, quite captivating. Hearing the word "swordsmanship," Li Xuanxuan's eyes lit up. "Have you cultivated sword Qi?"

"Replying to the patriarch, I have."

As they approached the Daoist Master's residence, they lowered their voices. Li Xuanxuan didn't press them further. They reached the summit, where fallen gardenia petals blanketed the ground like a layer of white frost. A few broken jade pillars lay amidst the sea of flowers, with faint wisps of purple flame flickering between them.

The Daoist Master, dressed in white robes with gold patterns, was reading a jade slip. Seeing Li Xuanxuan, he immediately rose to welcome him, helping the old man to a seat and pouring him tea. Only then did the younger clan members dare to move, standing respectfully to the side.

Li Zhouluo glanced over and saw his father, Li Chenghuai, standing silently nearby. His heart began to pound. 'What is happening...?'

With the juniors present, Li Xuanxuan held his tongue, simply responding to Li Ximing's questions about his well-being. Finally, Li Chenghuai spoke. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, Zhoufang and Zhouyang of the First Branch are in the wilderness and have not yet returned."

Li Ximing nodded and turned his gaze to Li Zhouluo and Li Xinghan, a look of satisfaction on his face. His eyes lingered on the sword on Li Xinghan's back. "Our family was founded on the sword," he said, "but besides my two brothers, few in the younger generation have taken to it. It is good that you two, one cultivating Geng Metal and the other Jade True, both practice the way of the sword."

Li Zhouluo was the first in the family to cultivate the _Gleaming Gold Spirit-Searching Art_. Li Xinghan was a special case; she cultivated the Yu family's Dao lineage, the _Jade Dao Unity True Art_.

This technique had been recovered from the Yu family's secret vaults. Although it was ungraded, it was a rare and complete inheritance. However, almost no one in the Li family had cultivated it over the years due to the difficulty of gathering its unique Qi.

The _Jade Dao Unity True Art_ required a cultivator to hold a jade plate and chant scriptures day in and day out to gather the initial strand of Qi. The process took five or six years—not an eternity, but far more demanding than the one or two hours a day other methods required. It was a significant delay in one's cultivation. Moreover, the Qi had to be gathered by the same person without interruption. The original scriptures had been scattered when the Yu family fell, making it even more challenging. Li Xinghan's father, though a direct descendant, was unremarkable in talent and ability and could never have acquired such a treasure for her.

But fortune and misfortune are intertwined. Because of his poor cultivation, her father was not qualified to participate in the great river battle. With only his status as a direct descendant, he had married a woman with ties to the Yu family. Li Xinghan's maternal uncle had once been a Yu family guest elder who knew the scriptures. Doting on his niece, he personally spent five years gathering the Qi for her.

Her mother's family's efforts had not been in vain. As Li Ximing looked at her, his eyes truly lit up.

A family's Dao lineages should be as diverse as possible to prevent them from being suppressed by a single type of magical artifact or spiritual aura. The family's direct lineage was lacking a Jade True cultivator. Li Ximing was pleased.

"Your immortal foundation has the intent of comprehension and unity, and you have appeared when the Jade True is prominent in the world," he said with a smile. "In ancient times, the Jade True Six-Nine Void True Monarch was also a sword immortal. When he attained Fruition... it's possible that this Jade True is an excellent lineage for sword practice, no worse than Geng Metal. Continue to train well."

Li Ximing needed to make no promises. For a Daoist Master of his stature to say these words in front of the clan's old patriarch and the Foundation Establishment head of Mount Qingdu was a clear sign that Li Xinghan had caught his eye. The young woman, though not one for complex thoughts, understood the weight of his words and immediately bowed low.

"Thank you, Daoist Master!"

# Chapter 743: Arranging Affairs, (Part 2)

Li Xinghan offered his thanks, earning a nod of approval from Li Xuanxuan.

"Do you have a Dharma Sword?" he asked.

The question made it obvious that a gift was forthcoming. Li Xinghan answered respectfully, "I have a lower-grade Qi Refining sword called the 'Northern Jade.' It was from my uncle's collection, originally a Dharma Artifact of the Yu family. It's quite old, likely forged back when the Jiang Clan was prominent, but it serves me well."

"The Yu family," Li Ximing remarked, raising an eyebrow. Since Li Xuanxuan had brought it up, it was only natural for him, the Daoist Master, to bestow the gift. "Back then... Yu Mujian had a sword named 'Bronze Hoard.' Your Uncle Xijun shattered it, but the remains are still in the treasury. It was forged from the bronze of Yan Mountain and the Water of the Drifting Nether. The craftsmanship was average, but the materials are of exceptional quality."

Everyone listened intently as Li Ximing continued, "Once you master the 'Flowing Light of the Triple Moon,' come up the mountain. I will personally find a smith to forge a new sword for you using the Bronze Hoard as the core material."

Li Xinghan bowed deeply in thanks, a genuine smile gracing her face. The promise of this new sword seemed to excite her even more than the Daoist Master's personal guidance.

Li Ximing then turned, his gaze sweeping over Li Zhouluo. The young man already wore a Foundation Establishment-grade sword at his waist, one cast in a brownish-yellow hue. It looked familiar to Li Ximing; it was likely the standard-issue 'Xushi Sword' his elder brother, Li Xizhi, had once used. Though made from Foundation Establishment materials, its quality was merely adequate, making it a suitable weapon for Zhouluo.

In recent years, Li Chenghuai had grown closer to Li Xizhi and his wife, so the family didn't need to worry about Li Zhouluo's cultivation resources or artifacts. His grandfather provided for almost everything, ensuring his supplies were on par with, if not better than, the direct descendants of the Azure Pond Sect. Within the Li family, he was in a class of his own. Thus, Li Ximing only asked a few questions about his cultivation before dismissing the two juniors, keeping only Li Quewan behind.

"You and Jiangqian wait for me down the mountain," he instructed.

Once the younger generation had departed, Li Xuanxuan finally spoke. He didn't ask about An Siwei, instead choosing a different topic. "Those two are promising children. And then there are Zhoufang and Zhouyang... Your younger brother once remarked that the only noteworthy thing about those two was their honesty. Yet now, aside from Zhouwei, Zhouluo, and Xinghan, they're the only presentable ones of the 'Zhou' generation..."

His tone held no anger, only a trace of melancholy. "Of the dozen or so others... the ones who are half-hearted, foolish, or incompetent are the better of the lot. Then there are those who lock themselves away, indulging in their own pleasures, secretly lost to wine and women... As long as they don't harm the common folk, Mount Qingdu can't punish them too severely. We can only let them be. As for the last one or two... they're still locked in a cell!"

At these words, Li Chenghuai quickly bowed his head in apology. "It is our failure as elders... My brothers and I have been negligent in their education..."

"Your Chengming generation is either cultivating or fighting. There are hardly any of you left. This blame doesn't fall on your shoulders..." Li Xuanxuan waved his hand dismissively. "It's that boy Zhouming's wretched nature... that is the real trouble."

Hearing his own grandson's name, Li Ximing understood at once. He glanced at Li Chenghuai and said, "Grandfather, you're blaming me... What foolishness has Zhouming committed now?"

Given that Li Ximing had just mentioned Li Zhouming, any misdeed that failed to reach his ears would be Li Chenghuai's responsibility. But Li Chenghuai was just as clueless; he had no idea what this person had done wrong! The last person who had deceived a Daoist Master had been reduced to ash. That single glance from Li Ximing, even coming from his own elder, was enough to make him freeze.

Fortunately, Li Xuanxuan's age had granted him sharp insight. A single look between the two was all he needed to grasp the situation. "This matter isn't under Mount Qingdu's jurisdiction, so the blame should fall on me."

Li Xuanxuan lowered his voice. "A few years ago, while you were in seclusion, Zhouming's cultivation was lagging. I thought to help him, so I had Jiangqian arrange a position for him. But he refused to go, and the matter was dropped. No one else in the family knew."

"Later, when Chenghuai came out of seclusion, he assigned him a task directly. He went, albeit reluctantly. I worried his cultivation level wouldn't command respect, so I secretly gave him a spiritual item to aid his practice... But... when I checked on him a few days ago... his cultivation showed no change."

Li Ximing sat up straight and poured Li Xuanxuan a cup of tea. "This junior has been lax in his upbringing."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head. "A direct descendant of a Daoist Master being supported by the family is one thing. We don't lack for one more mouth to feed... whether it's shameful or not is another matter. But I want what's best for him, so I have to say a few more words."

Silence fell upon the mountain. Fearing he had angered Li Ximing, Li Xuanxuan added, "I'm not saying he's completely useless. Among the juniors, Zhouwei is exceptional, of course, but the only others who have truly amounted to anything are Fang, Yang, Luo, and Han. Zhouming at least listens to his father a little. Compared to his brothers, he isn't the worst."

Li Ximing understood his grandfather's meaning. "Just give him an idle post. I never expected him to achieve anything great. We only need to manage the few who have ambition. Does Grandfather truly expect the family to prepare resources and send people to supervise his cultivation day and night? Our family has always selected the best based on talent and wit. We cannot break that rule."

Li Xuanxuan could only sigh and change the subject. "Chenghuai, though your Immortal Foundation is formidable, in my opinion... you shouldn't use it for every little thing."

Li Chenghuai looked slightly surprised.

Li Xuanxuan continued, "There are some things you can't perceive. As the saying goes, the water is too clear for fish. In the two years you've overseen Mount Qingdu, both the guest retainers and the family's direct line have grown timid, as if treading on ice. They've started colluding to find ways to evade your scrutiny. On the surface, things appear more peaceful, but in reality, their dealings have become more secretive. This is not a good sign."

"It's one thing if we can see their clandestine actions; a few grievances and injustices are acceptable. What I fear is that their activities become so cautious and hidden that neither of us can see them clearly. Then we'll have to expend twice the effort to investigate. There are countless wondrous arts in this world; they will eventually find a way to understand and bypass your divine ability. If we become too reliant on your Immortal Foundation, we will be the ones deceived and manipulated."

Li Chenghuai bowed his head in thought.

The old man went on, "Secondly, you should be focusing on your cultivation right now, not neglecting the root for the branches. Only involve yourself as a witness in major affairs concerning the direct lineage. After all, this current situation, where every single matter is brought to Mount Qingdu for a final judgment, has also broken the rules."

Li Chenghuai had just finished refining two new Dharma Artifacts and had yet to explore their many wonderful properties. He had been holding his post at Mount Qingdu purely out of a sense of duty. He now sensed the old man had been aware of this for some time and was offering him a way out. He couldn't help but marvel internally.

'The old master says nothing, but he is the one who sees things most clearly in this family... He has been watching over us for more than a century, after all...'

With a newfound sense of respect, he declared, "Chenghuai will obey. I will relinquish my authority at Mount Qingdu as soon as I return!"

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and smiled. "In that case, let Zhouluo take charge of Mount Qingdu."

"Old Master!" Li Chenghuai tried to object, but Li Xuanxuan simply waved his hand. Seeing this, he had no choice but to take his leave.

Alone now, the grandfather and grandson sat in silence. Li Xuanxuan glanced at the Daoist Master, who was quietly sipping his tea. "Ming'er, what do you think is the main flaw of the 'Zhou' generation?"

The celestial light between the white-robed, gold-patterned Daoist Master's brows subsided. He took a sip of tea. "They are too good-natured... and I fear they will be deceived."

"Precisely," Li Xuanxuan said with approval.

Li Ximing's voice was low. "Father told me from a young age that Moongaze Lake is a wicked land. He said that a ruler must be the most adept at misdeeds, cunning, and deception to control such people and bring peace to the populace. Zhouluo and Xinghan are talented, but they were born into privilege. Everything has come easily to them. They are fine for cultivation and combat, but if they encounter someone like Wenhu or Chen Yang, I'm afraid they will be easily manipulated."

In truth, Li Ximing was being gentle. Li Zhouluo wasn't a fool, but if he were to truly face Wenhu, he would almost certainly be played for one. This was exactly what worried Li Xuanxuan. "Who can say? People grow with age. When Chengdang was young, he was just a quiet boy among the Chengming generation. No one thought he would amount to much. Let's just wait and see."

Li Xuanxuan had been on the verge of asking about An Siwei several times, but in the end, he held his tongue. He simply stood up. "This old man has spent too long on the peak. It makes me want to meddle in family affairs. Don't mind my rambling."

"Grandfather's guidance is an endless benefit to the family."

Li Ximing saw him off. Down at the foot of the mountain, Li Jiangqian and Li Quewan were waiting, and behind them stood a broad-faced man. Feeling no need to return to the summit, Li Ximing sat down in the pavilion at the mountain's base.

"How are things progressing with the Secret Diffusion lineage?" he asked.

Li Jiangqian answered respectfully, "The Wang family members have arrived. This is Wang Quwan. He's from a different branch than Wang He, but he is still from the direct line of the Jiangbei Wang Clan."

The Wang Clan was a special case. They were an important local power, having migrated from the lands of Qi in the State of Zhao. Their numbers were significant not only in Funan and Midong, but their clan had once stretched all the way to the Tangjin region. Because of this, the Wang family could no longer be treated as ordinary guest retainers.

Li Ximing glanced at Wang Quwan. The man was dressed simply and had an unremarkable appearance. "Jiangbei is in turmoil. Now that the Wang clansmen have newly relocated to Funan, are you facing any difficulties?"

Wang Quwan clasped his hands and bowed, his eyes lowered respectfully toward the ground. "Midong was turbulent and dangerous. It is thanks to the main family that the Wang Clan was able to escape that sea of bitterness. Now we have been granted new lands. Everyone has a spirit field to cultivate and receives a stipend. The common clansmen are living and working in peace. We face no hardships."

His attitude and choice of words made the Daoist Master pause. Li Ximing noted that the man before him was neither young nor old, perhaps nearing fifty. "What arts have you studied? Do you have any skills? What crafts does your clan practice to sustain itself?"

Wang Quwan's gaze remained fixed on the ground, his posture one of ultimate deference. His etiquette was more impeccable than anyone Li Ximing had met. "Reporting to the Daoist Master," he said in a steady voice, "this humble one has practiced the sword since childhood and has achieved some small success, cultivating sword Qi for many years. My elder brother, Wang Qudao, is also nearby in the Funan region. He has some skill in alchemy, which he uses to support his family."

Li Ximing sensed a calm and composed mind, neither servile nor arrogant. This was no ordinary man. His words were precise and measured, which sparked a faint sense of unease in him.

'He's no simple character either... Wenhu, Ding Weizeng, Gongsun Bofan... and now Wang Qudao and Wang Quwan... This land of Jiangbei is truly blessed by the heavens. It's unusual... far too unusual.'

Li Ximing remained silent, and Wang Quwan could only continue to kneel. A strange premonition suddenly struck the Daoist Master.

'How does my family compare to the Xiao Clan of the past? Back then... did the Xiao Clan look upon my ancestor, Tongya, the same way I am looking at Wang Quwan now?'

'Did the Purple Mansion cultivators of that era think the same thing when they looked at my familyfirst there was Wan Huaqian and Yu Yufeng, then came Li Chejing and Yu Muxian, and then there was Li Tongya... This land of Moongaze Lake is truly blessed by the heavens!'

A myriad of thoughts raced through his mind. After a brief pause, he nodded. "Very well. Since you are willing to serve my family, you will be treated with the same consideration as our own clansmen."

Wang Quwan bowed respectfully. Just then, the Daoist Master flicked a finger, and a jade slip landed before him. "My clan has a technique called 'The Xiaoshi Art of Clearing the Heavens and Scattering Clouds.' It is far superior to whatever third-rate manual you're practicing, and it even includes the Foundation Establishment portion. You may begin cultivating it."

A flicker of joy lit up Wang Quwan's eyes. He understood the Daoist Master's intentions almost instantly. The Wang family had Wang He, a cultivator of the Capital immortals Dao, in Jiangbei. They were also the largest clan by far, with numerous direct branches. To stabilize their rule, the Li family needed a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Wang Clan. He accepted the jade slip with reverence. "This junior thanks the Daoist Master. The Wang Clan in Jiangbei will serve as loyal vassals to the main family, stabilizing the region for the Daoist Master and the clan head. We would die ten thousand deaths without regret."

Seeing that he had grasped the surface meaning, Li Ximing spoke more freely. "The family's 'Three Perfection Breakthrough Pill' and 'Pill of White Breath and Golden Sprout' will both have a share set aside for you. When you are ready to attempt your breakthrough, make a trip to Gardenia Scenery Mountain."

Wang Quwan expressed his gratitude once more and departed down the mountain. As he watched him leave, Li Ximing turned to Li Jiangqian. "Have you selected the candidates from the clan to cultivate the Secret Diffusion arts?"

Li Jiangqian nodded. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, I have just checked. Unfortunately, the most talented one, my younger sister Queyi, has already broken through, so it's too late for her. There are three members of the Jiangque generation at the fifth and sixth layers of Embyronic Breathing. This technique requires time to gather Qi, but fortunately, the Wang Clan had a stockpile that we've reclaimed. We'll have one of our younger clan brothers start cultivating it first, and then decide on the others."

Having seen Wang Quwan's capable demeanor, Li Ximing felt more at ease. In a few years, once his cultivation was higher, he would surely be a valuable asset. "Wang Quwan is a man of substance. It seems the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage is destined for him, which means his fortune is strong. You must watch him closely. The Wang Clan of Jiangbei is too large to tie down completely, but if we can make good use of Wang Quwan, he will be no less valuable than Ding Weizeng."

"This junior will remember!"

With the matter of the Secret Diffusion lineage settled, Li Ximing retrieved a stone box from his sleeve. Inside was Changxi's final testament. He handed it to Li Jiangqian. "I'm going to the Purple Smoke Gate, and I may have to make a detour to the Xuanmiao Temple to deal with Shanji Prefecture. I want you to inform Cheng'en to gather the people from the Profound Peak Gate. Have them retrieve the item from beneath the seat of the Head of the Hall of Resting Peaks and verify it against this testament."

Without another word, he transformed into a streak of celestial light and departed. Li Jiangqian maintained his bow until the light had vanished over the horizon. Only then did he straighten up and turn to Li Quewan.

"Sister, how has your progress been these past few months?"

"Not much to speak of," Li Quewan replied, her expression tinged with worry. "It seems we can no longer hold Shanji Prefecture. We're about to lose the entire prefecture, and all of the Profound Peak Gate's foundations will be scattered. I wonder how those few from the Kong Clan will react."

At the mention of this, Li Jiangqian said, "How else could they react? Has my Li family not been benevolent enough to them? Look at the Xuanmiao Temple, then look at Mount Jingyi. We are saving their Dao lineage. What cannot be defended must be abandoned, no matter how precious. Do they expect our family to protect it with our own lives?"

Li Quewan sighed. "Brother Qian, what you say is logical, but when you are caught in the middle of it, it's impossible to see clearly. From the Profound Peak Gate's perspective, they may not see this as a rescue. They might see it as something their ancestor earned by trading away spiritual artifacts and treasures, something that wasn't given to any other family... It all depends on whether Kong Guxi can make sense of it. If he can't, his fate will be far worse than Yuan Fuyao's!"

# Chapter 744: Dark Night

The wilderness.

Kong Guxi had mostly recovered from his injuries. Draped in a simple Daoist robe, he rode the wind, surveying his new domain. Two disciples trailed behind him, and as far as the eye could see, the land below teemed with a dense sea of people.

His Profound Peak Gate had relocated five hundred thousand people into the wilderness, nearly halving the population of their former territory in Shanji Prefecture. They had abandoned the more remote regions entirely, bringing everything they owned to this new land.

A territory that had lain empty for a century was suddenly bustling. He had established several secure settlements for his people. A good number of his disciples had been saved; he now had over a dozen at the Qi Refining Realm and even more at the Embryonic Breathing stage, all of whom had been dispatched to various locations.

As he tallied the lands in the wilderness now under the Profound Peak Gate’s control, Kong Guxi felt a flicker of relief.

'It’s not a small territory,' he thought. 'Enough to support our current disciples. The only drawback is the lack of rich spirit veins, which will make cultivation difficult for those at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Thankfully, we can borrow the Li family's spirit mountains.'

The Li family had been more than fair, granting him authority over most of the Profound Peak Gate's original holdings in the wilderness. Though news of raids and pillaging in Shanji Prefecture reached him from time to time, Kong Guxi had little time to mourn the loss.

'All the loyal ones have been moved. From now on, this wilderness is the domain of my Kong Clan. Let them fight over Shanji Prefecture… I was powerless to stop it anyway. Every extra day we held onto it was a blessing.'

Halfway through his patrol, he spotted several of his clan members gathered on a distant mountain peak. Li Chenghui stood among them, spear in hand. The sight made Kong Guxi’s eye twitch. He flew over at once, landing softly on the peak.

"Sect Master Kong," Li Chenghui said, his tone serious. "You've returned. We have an urgent matter to discuss."

Kong Guxi’s gaze swept over the group. His own people—Kong Qiuyan, Kong Xiaxiang, and even the clan’s other pillar of strength, Kong Guli—were all waiting expectantly. He hurried forward. “Please, instruct me!”

“I wouldn’t dare instruct you, Sect Master,” Li Chenghui replied, his expression grave. “I am merely relaying a message.”

“A message I received a while ago. My family’s Daoist Master has gone to the Purple Smoke Gate and sent me to inform you that your sect is to retrieve an item.”

“What item?” Kong Guxi’s heart pounded with fear. He was terrified Li Chenghui would ask for something like Kong Haiying’s head. Sweat beaded on his forehead.

But Li Chenghui only said, “An item left behind by Daoist Master Changxi. It is located beneath the primary seat in the Hall of Resting Peaks on your main mountain. Please send someone to retrieve it.”

Kong Guxi breathed a silent sigh of relief. He looked around and chose the most dependable person present. “Brother, I must ask you to make the trip.”

Kong Guli nodded and departed, leaving Kong Guxi and the others on the mountain, unsure of what to do. Kong Qiuyan glanced from Li Chenghui to her sect master, her mind too preoccupied to focus on anything. She ended up leaning against the doorway to wait. Old Kong Yu, his injuries still unhealed, paced back and forth, wanting to ask questions but not daring to.

The sky had begun to darken by the time a streak of light finally appeared in the distance. Kong Guli landed hastily on the peak, a stone box in his hands. “The seat was protected by a complex secret art,” he explained, breathless. “It took some time to bypass!”

Kong Guxi had no mind to reply. He opened the box, and the rest of the Kong clan members crowded around to look, their eyes filled with apprehension. Inside the box lay a piece of cloth, on which was written a single line of text.

“Desperate times call for desperate measures. Shanji Prefecture and the Profound Peak mountain sect are to be placed under the authority of Daoist Master Zhaojing.”

The cloth, inscribed by a Daoist Master, had taken on the texture of jade. Its smooth surface reflected their stunned faces. Old Kong Yu read it twice before speaking. “It is the ancestor’s decree.”

Seeing that there was no issue with the directive, Li Chenghui produced a jade box of his own. From it, he took out a piece of spirit cloth as hard as stone and placed it on the table. The crowd, silent as statues, leaned in once more to read.

‘I entrust Daoist Master Zhaojing to watch over the Profound Peak Gate. Should the situation turn dire, he has my permission to cede Shanji Prefecture to another power in exchange for their aid.’

The Kong clan stood in stunned silence.

To them, Shanji Prefecture was what Moongaze Lake was to the Li family. Losing it would be like the Li clan losing their sixteen prefectures and two mountains, left with nothing but Pingya Island. If they lost Shanji, they could never return to their ancestral home. All they could do was remain in the wilderness, serving as a buffer for others. Although they’d had some inkling of this when they migrated so many people, seeing it laid bare in writing left them utterly lost.

Kong Guxi was just as stunned.

In his heart, he had known since the battle on the river that the Profound Peak Gate was outmatched. In a departure from the thinking of nearly every other member of his clan, the sect master had already begun to see Shanji Prefecture as something that no longer belonged to them. That was why, no matter how fiercely the battles raged or how much was plundered, he could grit his teeth and suppress his heartache, pouring all his energy into their former dependency, this new domain in the wilderness.

But Changxi's final command mentioned another place: the mountain sect!

If their very mountain could be bartered away, then what of Kong Haiying and Kong Tingyun, who could not be moved? Kong Guxi could endure any hardship as long as there was a sliver of hope. But without those two, what was the Kong Clan?

Barely a second passed before Kong Guxi dropped to his knees. “The Profound Peak Gate respectfully obeys the Daoist Master’s command!” he cried out.

Night had fallen. His voice, amplified by his power, echoed through the mountains on the evening wind. From Kong Guli to Kong Yu, and even to the disciples scattered across the peak, everyone pondered his words.

'Obey which Daoist Master's command?'

'The Profound Peak Gate of Shanji… but if we have no Shanji, no mountain… are we still the Profound Peak Gate?'

But their bodies reacted faster than their thoughts. Like wheat before a scythe, they all fell to their knees, their voices joining in a chorus.

“The Profound Peak Gate respectfully obeys the Daoist Master’s command!”

Li Chenghui moved to help him up, but Kong Guxi bowed again. “The Daoist Master helped us relocate our people and gave us a place to shelter. The Profound Peak Gate is eternally grateful! We have no way to repay this debt…”

The others, lost and forlorn, repeated his words amid choked sobs. Only then did Kong Guxi rise, his voice thick with gratitude. “Thank you for making this trip, sir. If there is any news from Shanji, please inform us at once. We will immediately move the few dozen people we left behind, so as not to cause any delays or misunderstandings.”

Li Chenghui gave him a complicated look, then nodded and departed on the wind. The moment he was gone, Kong Qiuyan slumped to the ground. Kong Xiaxiang, a young man with reddened eyes, shot to his feet, his face a mask of agitation. He stormed toward the hall and slammed the doors open with a thunderous bang.

Kong Guxi, who had been hunched over, suddenly exploded into motion. He took a single step and seized the young man’s robes, yanking him around. The sect master’s face was a mask of fury, like that of a raging lion.

“What do you mean by that,” he roared, “what do you mean! Speak! What… do you mean!”

His voice was like a thunderclap, extinguishing every magic lamp in the hall and plunging the room into darkness. Faced with his sect master’s blazing eyes, Kong Xiaxiang’s defiant glare melted away. He gritted his teeth. “Reporting to the Sect Master, this junior was going to relay the order.”

Only then did Kong Guxi release him, his voice now a hoarse rasp. “It is not safe for you to go out now. Remain on this peak. Do not go anywhere. We will reassess in a few days.”

The eldest among them, Kong Guli, had watched the entire exchange without a word. Only Kong Yu, weeping quietly, stumbled out into the night and vanished into the darkness, a man whose nature had always been to pity himself.

After a long while, Kong Guxi stepped out of the hall. The lamps outside had gone out as well. He looked up at the sky.

He realized there was no moon tonight. A bleak wind rustled through the forest, and the entire mountain was steeped in blackness. His disciples stood on either side, their faces swallowed by the night, their features indistinct. It seemed to him that they were all trembling.

# Chapter 745: Pills and Formations

Though the night was deep, the Purple Smoke Blessed Land was a realm of perpetual light.

Wisps of purple qi coiled and ascended, creating an ethereal, immortal atmosphere. The qi ebbed and flowed like a tide, revealing and concealing a landscape of countless peaks in its thick, violet clouds. The glow of magical formations shot into the sky, bathing the entire domain in a brilliant radiance.

At the very center, pavilions and galleries floated upon the purple qi, a breathtaking sight. A Daoist Master in a white robe with gold trim descended on a beam of light, followed by a younger man with the air of a scholar. The purple qi parted before them, revealing a long, translucent staircase of purple jade.

The Purple Smoke Gate disciples they passed along the way bowed their heads in respect, whether they recognized the Daoist Master or not, only rising after he had passed. Li Ximing noted this with a silent nod of approval.

'The Purple Smoke Gate has a long and venerable history,' he thought. 'Their etiquette is quite strict.'

This visit was not solely about the Profound Peak Gate. The two families had much to discuss, and Li Ximing had never intended to come alone. However, the core members of his clan were either in seclusion or recovering from injuries, and the few who remained were busy managing critical affairs. After careful consideration, he had chosen to bring Cui Jueyin.

'Those other guest elders would be an embarrassment,' he mused. 'Ding Weizeng is qualified, but he's nursing a minor injury. Besides, he lacks polish and has never seen the wider world. Cui Jueyin, a direct descendant from Chongzhou, is the most suitable choice.'

A female cultivator descended on a cloud to greet them. She wore a pale yellow feathered robe, a brightly colored sash fluttering at her waist.

“Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing!”

The woman bowed. The Daoist Master in the white and gold robe returned the courtesy. “Is Daoist Master Tinglan present?” he asked.

Li Ximing had corresponded with the Purple Smoke Gate some time ago and only made the trip after confirming Tinglan had returned to the sect. His question was merely a formality. The woman in yellow replied, “My master returned to the Blessed Land half a year ago. She had planned to leave on the twenty-second, but after receiving your letter, she stayed a few extra days and sent me to wait for you here.”

She led the way, the purple qi swirling around them. Li Ximing turned his head slightly and spoke in a low voice to Cui Jueyin, who followed behind him. “This is the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate, of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Dao Lineage.”

The young man maintained a respectful posture, his eyes wide with wonder at the purple qi flowing through the mountains. He acknowledged the information with a soft sound of assent, a sense of ease settling over him.

Cui Jueyin was a stranger in these lands, but even in his year of relative seclusion, he had learned of the Three Sects and Seven Gates. For a Purple Mansion cultivator like Li Ximing to offer such an explanation showed that he was treating him as one of his own juniors. An ordinary Foundation Establishment subordinate would never have received such personal attention.

The three of them proceeded deeper, finally arriving at the palace complex floating on the purple qi. The spiritual energy here was even richer, and a special kind of energy seemed to flow up from the steps beneath their feet, dissipating like smoke.

Though only one of the Seven Gates, the Purple Smoke Gate’s foundation was deep. Their mountain sect, known as a Blessed Land, was a place of sublime beauty. Chongzhou Island was a fine place in its own right, but it paled in comparison. Cui Jueyin was filled with awe.

The Purple Qi Dao lineage was exceedingly rare overseas. While one might occasionally encounter a demonic cultivator of that path, an orthodox sect with such an immortal air was unheard of. Cui Jueyin’s gaze swept over the drifting purple mists, feeling their profound power.

The woman in yellow led them to the highest point, but here there was no palace. Instead, a smooth, translucent platform of purple jade stretched before them. The purple qi here had taken on a faint, luminous yellow hue, darting back and forth beneath their feet.

A laugh echoed through the air. “Greetings, Daoist Brother Zhaojing!”

Li Ximing looked up to see a woman standing on the platform. Unlike the usual purple attire of the sect’s members, she wore a magnificent autumn-yellow satin dress embroidered with butterfly patterns. Her features were delicate, her eyebrows thin. A touch of cyan at the corners of her eyes enhanced her beauty.

'So this is Daoist Master Tinglan,' Li Ximing thought. 'She seems to have a taste for finery.'

Only Li Ximing and Tinglan had the standing to openly appraise one another. Both the Purple Smoke cultivator and Cui Jueyin kept their eyes lowered, not daring to look directly at a Purple Mansion master. Whatever Tinglan thought of him, Li Ximing simply smiled in return. “You are too kind, Daoist Sister. I had heard your title was one of great beauty, and now that I see you in person, I find you are truly a celestial fairy.”

Daoist Master Tinglan laughed and thanked him for the compliment. “I am originally a cultivator from the northern land of Qi,” she explained. “My style of dress is a bit different from that of the Jiangnan region. I hope you do not find it strange.”

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. 'A cultivator from Qi? It seems she is not from the Kan family. Qi is the Gao family’s territory… Surely she isn’t a Gao, is she?'

While Li Ximing was still pondering this, Daoist Master Tinglan spoke again, her voice gentle. “My surname is Yi. I was once a loose cultivator and array master from Bolie Prefecture. I received the guidance of my master, Daoist Master Zipei, and achieved my Divine Ability here in the Blessed Land.”

Li Ximing nodded. Tinglan continued, “I have been traveling for many years and am not often in the sect. I only saw your letter upon my return. I apologize for making you wait, Daoist Brother.”

Li Ximing didn’t believe a word of it.

'When Changxi was alive, he visited the Purple Smoke Gate several times and never saw a soul. Even when my family sent inquiries, we received no response. Now that Changxi has fallen and we have proven our strength on the river, you suddenly appear, ready to divide up Shanji Prefecture. How convenient.'

For a loose cultivator to become a direct disciple of Zipei and break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Tinglan was no simple character. Li Ximing didn’t let his thoughts show. Everyone sought to avoid risk and maximize their gains. He simply replied, “It was no trouble. The search for our predecessor’s whereabouts is the highest priority.”

Daoist Master Tinglan merely smiled and nodded at his words, saying nothing more. With a light sweep of her sleeve, a table and chairs materialized on the jade platform, seemingly formed from the platform itself. A jade pot sat on the table, the tea inside boiling, steam billowing from its spout.

“Please!”

As they took their seats, Tinglan asked, “You sought me out, Daoist Brother. Is it concerning an array for your clan?”

She had provided the perfect opening. This was indeed one of Li Ximing’s goals. He nodded. “My family has only recently been elevated to an Immortal Clan, and we are indeed lacking a Purple Mansion-level spiritual array. The Purple Smoke Gate is a great sect of array masters, and you, Daoist Sister, are a grandmaster of the art. I came to ask for your guidance.”

Tinglan glanced at him and smiled. “You are no slouch yourself, Daoist Brother.”

In truth, Li Ximing had only just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm and was hardly a master of alchemy. Tinglan, for her part, was not yet capable of setting up a Purple Mansion array on her own. The exchange brought a wry smile to both their faces, and they dropped the pretenses.

Li Ximing’s expression turned serious. “Please, instruct me.”

Tinglan nodded. “There are three crucial elements to a Purple Mansion Grand Array,” she began softly. “First and foremost is the spiritual object at its core. Second is the foundation of the array. Last is the Divine Ability and dharma power of the cultivator setting it up.”

“The foundation of the array consists of the spiritual energy, the earth veins, the Great Void, and the array’s nodes. Though incredibly expensive, these are often manageable for cultivators like us. The true difficulty lies in finding a suitable spiritual object for the array, and in the fact that not every cultivator’s Divine Ability can properly channel the wondrous properties of such objects.”

Li Ximing considered her words.

“Your clan must first acquire a Purple Mansion-level spiritual object,” Tinglan continued. “Then, I can come and assess it. If we proceed, I have a few friends who can assist. It would take about three to five years before the array is operational.”

She paused, clearly thinking of the Profound Peak mountain sect, and poured him a cup of tea. “However, if you have a Purple Mansion array that can be moved, that changes things entirely. I would still need to survey your lake, realign the earth veins, and fill in lakes or level mountains where necessary. It would be a great deal of work upfront, but the setup would be much faster and far less expensive.”

The tea was surprisingly good, far better than anything Li Ximing or Daoist Master Changxi could brew. He took a sip, noticing Tinglan’s unusual enthusiasm for the matter. “So it takes that long,” he said. “I was hoping for your assistance, Daoist Sister, but I didn’t realize it would require such a monumental effort…”

Tinglan had been waiting for this. “Do not worry, Daoist Brother. I also require your help. I need you to refine a pill for me.”

“Refine a pill?” Li Ximing frowned. “Is it something your own Divine Ability cannot handle?”

For a Purple Mansion cultivator, creating pills was a simple matter of shaping them with a wave of the hand. If it required his intervention, it was surely no ordinary pill.

At his question, Tinglan nodded slowly but did not speak. She turned to the female cultivator in yellow. “Danying, take our young friend on a tour of the Blessed Land.”

Cui Jueyin understood immediately. After a nod from Li Ximing, he and the woman departed swiftly. The purple mist closed behind them.

Only then did Tinglan speak. “When cultivators like us use our Divine Abilities for alchemy, we can only manage pills for the Foundation Establishment or Qi Refining realms. We are not like you, who have practiced the Dao of Alchemy from the start. For you, the Shengyang Acupoint pushing into the Great Void is a state of perfect balance between yin and yang. For us, if we put our full power into refining, over time our Divine Ability will inevitably affect our Shengyang residence, throwing our yin and yang out of balance. I even have to rely on Hengxing for decent Essence Gathering Pills. Anything more powerful is simply beyond me.”

She took out a jade slip, casually broke the seal with a wave of her hand, and placed it on the table. “Please take a look, Daoist Brother,” she said with a smile, “and tell me if it can be done.”

This was an unexpected boon. Li Ximing picked up the slip and began to read.

“Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill”

As expected, it was a Purple Mansion-level pill of considerable complexity. It required an incredibly precious Purple Mansion spiritual object, Immeasurable Water and Fire, as a harmonizing agent. The ingredients had to be refined with Divine Ability sixteen thousand, two hundred times before the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness could be used as the pill’s body.

Li Ximing gritted his teeth. 'You people of the Purple Smoke Gate… so wealthy! Even Tinglan, who isn't a Kan, is this extravagant. Immeasurable Water and Fire, Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness… if I could obtain either one of those, I’d be happy for three days straight…'

The slip didn’t list the pill’s other primary ingredients, only the secondary ones, the general procedure, and a description of the refining difficulty. There was no mention of the pill’s effects, but as an alchemist, Li Ximing understood enough.

“This is a Valley Water spiritual pill for extracting and gathering primal essence… not exactly an orthodox concoction…”

He pondered for a moment. “I must ask, Daoist Sister, do the primary ingredients include spiritual objects of the Veiled Yin or Radiant Essence type?”

“Of course not!” Tinglan’s attitude brightened considerably when he didn’t immediately refuse. She smiled. “I anticipated that! It is precisely because of the Valley Water that it clashes with the Hengzhu rites. That is why Daoist Brother Hengxing dared not refine this pill for me. If it contained something like Veiled Yin… I wouldn’t dare ask for your help either.”

Now Li Ximing understood why she hadn’t sought out Daoist Master Hengxing. He weighed his options. 'The difficulty of this pill is unprecedented. Fortunately, the challenge lies in the refining process, not in an insurmountable barrier of Divine Ability. At worst, the yield will be low, and it will take more time. It’s not impossible.'

He thought for a moment more, then asked for confirmation. “Do you have the Immeasurable Water and Fire?”

Tinglan nodded and had someone bring a large stone box from the base of the mountain. She opened it with her Divine Ability and took out a small, palm-sized clay pot. Its surface was smooth and covered in intricate gold and white patterns.

The moment the pot was placed on the table, it appeared perfectly ordinary to the naked eye. But in Li Ximing’s spiritual sense, a thunderclap exploded. He perceived an intertwining of water and fire around the pot, so intense that the surrounding spiritual energy fled from it as if from a cursed star. In the Great Void, a new peak seemed to rise out of nowhere.

“I have the spiritual object,” Tinglan said, her voice filled with hope. “But this Immeasurable Water and Fire repels spiritual energy. Controlling it with one’s Divine Ability is incredibly draining. Are you confident, Daoist Brother? If you are to use this fire for alchemy, you might need to prepare some spiritual pills to maintain clarity of mind.”

But Li Ximing cared little for Immeasurable Water and Fire. His spiritual sense swept over it, and his Talisman Qi reacted. As long as it was fire, it could not escape the control of his Talisman Qi’s Valley Wind Guides the Flame. He never used his spiritual sense to control fire; it cost him nothing. How else could he have single-handedly supplied the Li family’s demand for pills while still cultivating?

“As long as the primary ingredient is not a fellow cultivator, and it does not violate my clan’s principles, I can attempt it,” he said. “However, my skills are not yet perfected. I fear I can produce no more than three pills.”

“Excellent!”

The Daoist Master in the autumn-yellow dress was pleasantly surprised by his confidence. 'Bright Yang accompanied by Li Fire,' she mused. 'It has control over fire, but is not fire itself. Perhaps that gives him an unusual degree of mastery over Immeasurable Water and Fire…'

Her confidence in him grew. Daoist Master Tinglan smiled and nodded, her expression turning serious. “If you can refine this pill for me, and your clan has a suitable spiritual object, then I will handle the array for Moongaze Lake. If… you intend to move an existing array… I can handle that as well. The value is not equal, of course, so I will compensate you with other things.”

Li Ximing had his own Whole Pill Purple Mansion spiritual object, but he had no intention of revealing it just yet. He let out a slow breath and raised an eyebrow. “I do have one question. Daoist Master Chuting of the Lixia Xiao Clan is a far superior alchemist than I. Why did you not seek him out? You might have gotten more pills and not wasted such a precious ingredient as the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness.”

Li Ximing had known of the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness since he was in the Qi Refining realm. It was a Purple Mansion-level spiritual water, also known as Primal Water, capable of cleansing one’s immortal foundation and bringing the dead back to life. Its preciousness was second only to treasures like the Supreme Yin Moon Essence.

There were many life-saving spiritual objects, but few that could truly cheat death. Furthermore, the ability to cleanse one’s immortal foundation could allow a mediocre cultivator to leap into the ranks of the elite, rivaling the direct descendants of Purple Mansion clans.

Once used in alchemy, the Immeasurable Water and Fire could be recovered, but the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness would be gone forever. The thought of such a loss made Li Ximing’s heart ache.

At his question, Daoist Master Tinglan shook her head. “I did consider seeking out that senior… but I would not be able to get an audience with him. Even if I did, I would not dare trust him. And even if I gritted my teeth and did trust him, the price would be astronomical. That old man’s mind is as deep as an abyss. You, Daoist Brother, are far more approachable.”

Li Ximing nodded, a strange feeling creeping over him.

'So, I’m the budget-friendly, more desperate, and easier to manipulate option…'

Daoist Master Tinglan glanced at him slyly and chuckled. “Don’t overthink it, Daoist Brother. My Purple Smoke Gate has a great need for refined pills, and several of my friends are also struggling with this. If this venture is successful, there will be many more pills to refine. There are great benefits for both our families in the future.”

Li Ximing listened to her empty promises, murmuring his assent. Tinglan pushed the jade slip toward him. “I will leave this with you for now. It contains some notes and insights on alchemy from a predecessor. Perhaps you will find it useful.”

Li Ximing was indeed tempted by the Purple Mansion-level insights in the slip, but he didn’t move. He finally understood the source of his unease.

'So, Tinglan’s real purpose in meeting me was for alchemy. It likely has nothing to do with Shanji Prefecture… Oh, Kong Guxi… you are willing to give up Shanji Prefecture, but she may not even want it! She’ll probably make you beg her to take it!'

# Chapter 746: The Intent of Purple Smoke

A contemplative Li Ximing set down his teacup, yet he still did not put away the jade slip, sighing as he spoke.

"Daoist Master, how do you see this matter with Profound Peak Gate?"

Tinglan saw that he was in no hurry to put the jade slip away and a hint of a smile appeared on her face. "I've been traveling overseas for years, so I don't know the specifics. Daoist Master Changxi, rising from such a minor clan, has already achieved something quite extraordinary. My master mentioned him once... he was very devoted to his clan."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. The woman continued, "After all, we are neighbors. Our Purple Smoke Immortal Gate has been watching. The former Haiying and Haiting, and later Gujun and Tingyun, were all fine supplements. He valued his clan, and that is why he did not act. A cunning rabbit has three burrows, and a Purple Mansion Daoist Master is no less. Now that he has died, Profound Peak Gate may seem to have no way to recover, but in reality, their retreat paths are more numerous than their forward ones. The Immortal Sect might not be saved, but the bloodline and Dao lineage are as steady as a mountain."

"What's more, doesn't the Moongaze Immortal Clan stand with them?"

At this, Li Ximing quickly shook his head.

Though he had not known Changxi for long and had often heard the Daoist Master's name accompanied by disrespectful jokes, he now understood. "Senior Changxi was a man of many thoughts, but he repeatedly mentioned Shanji Prefecture in his final days. He said the million-strong population of the prefecture was the fruit of his life's work and that he had protected them for hundreds of years. Now, unable to continue protecting them, he looked around and saw that only the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate was a legitimate and righteous holy land of pure cultivation. He could only feel at ease entrusting these people to the hands of the righteous path."

Whatever Tinglan was thinking, hearing such high praise made it impossible to refuse the first statement. "We can only thank the elder for his high regard. But as you also said, our Purple Smoke Immortal Gate belongs to the righteous Dao. It is a holy land of pure cultivation. As for the matters of the Immortal Dao, we naturally burn talismans for a higher purpose, to receive the Immortal Mandate from the Moonlight Origin Mansion, and to focus on self-cultivation by guarding our hearts and understanding our nature."

"The Origin Mansion once allocated several prefectures to our Purple Smoke Immortal Gate, and we have guarded those prefectures. We must not cross that boundary... please forgive us."

'Moonlight Origin Mansion?'

Li Ximing was genuinely stunned by her words. He had considered a thousand reasons for her to refuse, but this was not one of them. This excuse was utterly high-sounding and righteous. It took him a moment to recover before he finally spoke.

"I see... this Zhaojing was presumptuous."

The two azure dots in the corner of Tinglan's eyes flickered, and she gave him another look. "Your clan is a rising star and does not yet understand. In truth, the Xiao Clan and your Li Clan followed precedent to become Immortal Clans, separating themselves from the Azure Pond Sect. This precedent, this rule, was a regulation of the Origin Mansion. Elder Si was simply acting in accordance with the ancient rules."

When she finished, Li Ximing realized that Tinglan's earlier words were not a complete refusal. The Moonlight Origin Mansion had many rules that still operated within Jiangnan. Although they might not always be in effect, a Purple Mansion Daoist Master would not violate them unless there was a significant conflict of interest.

He recalled many things: the conservative names of the Immortal Sects and Immortal Gates, the superficial unity between the Green Pine and Supreme Yang Dao lineages, how the various clans retreated from Green Pine Temple to let the Six Gates reside there, and the immense reverence Xuanmiao Temple showed for Sword Gate...

'Even as these six clans secretly plot against each other, their territories barely ever change. They always hold on to their own small plots of land... and all their conflicts are taken overseas...'

'The Six Clans truly hold a transcendent status. Yue Cultivating Sect is reclusive, and Profound Peak Gate is a sect in name only. The Yue State is now essentially two sects, six gates, and three clans... but one sect and four gates cannot be moved.'

Li Ximing gradually came to a realization. A sudden thought surfaced in his mind.

"Snow Wings Gate has been closed for hundreds of years! It has reached the point where mortals have entered the mountains and no disciples have come out... and yet no one has ever tried to touch it! Could it be for this very reason... because it is tightly surrounded by the Green Pine Dao lineage and its land is barren, it has been able to cling to existence until today?"

Many thoughts passed through his mind, but his expression only showed a sigh. "Daoist Master Tinglan... my family has tried its best, but we can no longer protect the entire Shanji Prefecture. What a pity for the people there!"

Tinglan chuckled in return. "That is not difficult. You only need to invite a Purple Mansion Daoist Master to reside there. No one in Jiangnan dislikes more land, and there are many Purple Mansion cultivators who want to establish a Dao lineage here. They only lack a guarantor. The old ones are too cautious to come, and the young ones are too playful... as long as our two families come to an agreement, and we ask for Sword Gate's approval, the matter will be settled."

This gave Li Ximing pause for thought. The more he considered it, the more his brow furrowed. If there was a friendly Purple Mansion Daoist Master nearby, it would not be a terrible thing. However, with the Profound Peak Dao lineage now in his family's hands, it would not be a popular move. Sending the Kong clan members away would be a bit awkward for his family, and it would be hard to explain to Xuanmiao Temple.

'I can give it a try...'

He turned his thoughts and put away the jade slip. "If we go with this idea, can your Immortal Gate first send people to Shanji to gather the forces there? My family does not have the energy to watch over it. I'm afraid that by the time we have news, Shanji Prefecture will have been plundered clean."

"That is secondary."

Seeing that he had put the item away, Tinglan frowned. "If we finalize the matter, there are two conditions. One, the Profound Peak Gate's sect location must be given to them. Otherwise, how can a dignified Daoist Master start a sect? If the spiritual essence-rich land is already someone else's, where will they cultivate? That would be a loss of face."

"Second, Kong Haiying must die."

Li Ximing had expected this. He sighed internally, and Tinglan's expression turned serious. "Let me warn you of something here. If Kong Haiying does not die, the conflict between your clan and the Capital immortals Dao will only worsen day by day, quickly escalating to a point where it is difficult to mediate. Yehui is not an extremist, but he will not tolerate Kong Haiying under any circumstances. Kong Haiying's opportunities are not shallow; he truly has the potential to break through to the next realm!"

"You still have to refine pills for me, after all. If you start a real fight with him, it will likely turn the entire Jiangnan area into a chaotic mess, and I will have no place to refine my pills..."

"It's the same for the Profound Peak Gate's sect location... if it's handed over to someone else, what Daoist Master could tolerate having a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators still on the verge of breaking through within their sect? If they succeed in breaking through and coming out of seclusion, who would that sect belong to? Who would Shanji Prefecture belong to?"

"The fact that the Profound Peak lineage is in your family's hands is already a reason for Daoist Masters who wish to move inland to hesitate. Once they occupy Shanji and Profound Peak, the Kong clan members in the Wilderness will be, at best, a remnant clan, and at worst, remnants of an enemy. Your family would at least have to send the Kong clan members to them, forcing them to put on a show of gratitude before a reconciliation can be considered."

Although Li Ximing knew the matter was difficult, he sighed after hearing her explanation and nodded. "I understand... are your pills urgent, Daoist Master? If I can't resolve this matter, I'm afraid it will be difficult to refine them immediately."

"It's fine. I can wait for three to five years. Besides... I'm going to the Northern Sea in a few days, so I won't have time to set up the formation for you right away."

Tinglan clearly didn't expect Li Ximing to be able to refine the pills immediately. The two exchanged a few polite words and settled on the details of their agreement. Tinglan pointed to the clay pot on the table.

"I'll give you the formula for the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill to study first. Once you are prepared, you can come to our Purple Smoke Immortal Gate to retrieve the Immeasurable Water and Fire and the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness."

Li Ximing agreed and took his leave. Tinglan escorted him out. Below the purple jade platform, Cui Jueyin and the Purple Smoke cultivator, Wei Danying, were chatting amiably. Their relationship seemed much warmer than the transactional exchange between the two Daoist Masters.

Although Cui Jueyin's appearance was not outstanding, he was well-read and his demeanor was refined, making conversation with him a pleasant experience. Wei Danying listened with great interest. When the two Daoist Masters appeared, they immediately became respectful and retreated behind them.

"Safe travels, Zhaojing..."

Tinglan escorted him out of the blessed land. Li Ximing flew away, deep in thought. After a long time, he sighed internally.

'My family cannot protect the Profound Peak Gate's sect location and Shanji Prefecture right now.'

Li Ximing had considered the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate's attitude, but he hadn't expected Tinglan to have a single, unwavering word"kill"for Kong Haiying. He found it truly surprising.

When Tinglan had spoken from the perspective of the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate, Li Ximing understood. They had no intention of occupying Shanji, but they were open to the idea of inviting a Purple Mansion Daoist Master as a buffer and doing a favor for a friend... In this regard, his family was somewhat in her way.

But his thoughts did not stop at the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate. The next moment, he thought of another person:

'Yehui!'

If another Purple Mansion Daoist Master appearing in Shanji Prefecture was merely slightly awkward for the Li family, something they wouldn't get much benefit from... for Yehui, as long as he was willing to give up some benefits to lure someone in, it would be the best thing that could happen!

Yehui was a cultivator from the Eastern Sea. If he truly couldn't take over the Profound Peak Gate's sect location, he could heartlessly give up and invite a friendly Purple Mansion Daoist Master into Shanji. His family's situation would instantly become difficult... this new Daoist Master would not only have their sights set on the Profound Peak Gate but would also want to sever the Kong clan's lineage!

If this Purple Mansion Daoist Master was invited by the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate, the Li family would still have the option of sending the Kong clan members back and allowing the Profound Peak lineage to merge with another's power. But if it was a friend of Yehui's, there would be no reason to send them back, and it would only lead to open hostility.

'Yehui would have no more worries. My family would be too busy dealing with the threats from the Wilderness to care about Jiangbei...'

Yehui hadn't done this yet for two reasons. First, he was unwilling to give up the Profound Peak Gate's sect location. Second, he hadn't reached an agreement with the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate and Sword Gate... but that didn't mean it wouldn't happen.

'Has Yehui approached Tinglan? Were Tinglan's words out of goodwill, or a subtle reminder because she hadn't reached an agreement with Ye Hui?'

A chill ran through his heart.

'Regardless, Shanji and the Profound Peak Gate's sect location must be dealt with quickly. But to deal with this sect location, I must deal with the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in seclusion from the Kong clan. Even if I want to slightly ease tensions with Capital immortals Dao to free up my hands for pill refining, I must at least deal with Kong Haiying!'

However, Changxi had said there were three people in seclusion: the guest elder Fu En, his great-grandson Kong Haiying, and the former sect master Kong Tingyun. Li Ximing couldn't be sure that the person who died was Fu En, or even that the few in seclusion were Kong Haiying and the others.

Thinking this far, even Li Ximing, who could understand Changxi's mistrust in his later years, felt a sense of fatigue and quiet anger.

"Hiding things left and right... making it hard even to help. So be it... since Changxi was so calculating, it's impossible that he didn't know that Kong Haiying was a matter of life and death for Profound Peak Gate. I can no longer care about what the others from Profound Peak think... if I don't take over Profound Peak and use the Immortal Mirror to find out the truth, there will be no need to protect it!"

He left the Purple Smoke territory and headed for home, a plan gradually forming in his mind. He appeared on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, and Cui Jueyin descended from the sky, standing quietly beside him.

Li Ximing gave his orders.

"Go and invite the several managers, as well as Que'wan and Chenghui. We'll go on a trip together."

...

The Wilderness.

The sky was dawning, and a humid mist filled the mountains.

Several days had passed since the news of Daoist Master Changxi's final wishes, and Kong Guxi still hadn't fully recovered. He had intended to read scriptures until midnight, but in a daze, the sky had already begun to brighten.

He changed his clothes and came out of the hall. The area outside was empty. The stone steps were unswept, covered in fallen leaves, making him wonder if everyone had gone to join other families.

After wandering for a while, he finally found Kong Yu, who was drinking in the mountains with a flushed face. Kong Guxi bowed and asked,

"Great-uncle, where have Qiuyan and the others gone?"

Kong Yu had been drinking all night but could not get drunk. He was still very lucid. "Xiang has been locked up by you. A group of Capital immortals Dao cultivators arrived in the Wilderness, likely from Shanji Prefecture. I don't know what a mess it has become. Qiuyan has taken people to intercept them."

He paused, emphasizing, "The Li family's people are also there."

Kong Guxi acknowledged this and asked about the whereabouts of Kong Guli.

"Where is my elder brother?"

Kong Yu raised his brows. "Patriarch Chenghui sent someone to ask for our family's soul lamps and life jades. Your elder brother just took him there."

Kong Guxi was speechless. He turned toward the front courtyard, where he heard a commotion on the stone steps. Several large bags were being carried. The sect master of Profound Peak looked up and saw his elder brother, Kong Guli, bringing Fu Yuezi up the mountain.

Kong Guli seemed to have lost his soul, but Fu Yuezi was as composed as ever. He carried his Dharma Artifact and waved at him. Kong Guxi went up to greet him, grasping his elder brother's hands and finding them ice cold. He could only ask,

"I heard Great-uncle say... you just left..."

Kong Guli said forlornly, "I did just leave, but who knew that when the news from a few days ago reached them, the elders on the mountain had already packed the soul lamps and life jades, Dao lineage techniques, and all the other items? They all wanted to run here, so naturally, they came very quickly."

Kong Guxi had no words. He saw streaks of light flying through the air, and the noise on the mountain grew louder. He had only walked a few steps when he saw a group of people descend from the sky. The golden-eyed man leading the group strode with the posture of a dragon. Kong Guxi's heart felt as if it had been gripped by a large hand. He quickly stepped forward.

"Greetings, Patriarch... why have you come?"

Li Zhouwei was as courteous as ever. He nodded and replied,

"My injuries have healed a lot. I have been ordered by the Daoist Master to come and hold the fort in the Wilderness."

Sweat beaded on Kong Guxi's forehead. He nodded repeatedly, but before he could ask for more details, a flash of celestial light appeared before him, and the surroundings suddenly became brilliant. Everyone immediately lowered their heads and bowed.

Above them, a Daoist Master in a white robe with golden patterns was standing, observing them. This sight terrified Kong Guli, who retreated several steps. Kong Guxi was shocked and immediately knelt down. The rest of the Profound Peak Gate members, whether they had seen him before or not, knew he was a Daoist Master. For a moment, no one on the mountain was standing. Only respectful voices could be heard, one after another.

As he knelt, Kong Guxi glanced up. Li Ximing's expression showed little emotion, but the fact that the Profound Peak Dao lineage had just handed over the command to Shanji and the sect location made Kong Guxi feel a deep, baseless fear.

He knelt properly and then heard the Daoist Master speak, his voice neither hurried nor angry.

"Bring me Kong Haiying's soul lamp."

A cold chill ran from Kong Guxi's heart to the soles of his feet. The sect master could not see too much of the struggle between Purple Mansion Daoist Masters and the big picture, but based on the progression of events, he had already sensed too many unfavorable things. He could only bow respectfully and say,

"This junior obeys."

### Chapter 747: Discerning Truth from Falsehood

Below, Guest Elder Wu had already retrieved the items. At Kong Guxi’s nod, the guest elder immediately brought a stand forward, upon which sat two neat rows of soul lamps. They rested on a base of some dark, unknown wood, their faint blue flames flickering gently.

The bottom row held only life jades, clearly belonging to disciples and guest elders of little importance. The row above belonged to Kong Qiuyan’s generation; their soul lamps were already more than half extinguished. Higher still were the lamps of Kong Guxi’s generation, larger and more ornately carved, yet only three of the ten remained lit.

On the next tier, the lamps were almost entirely dark, save for a single flickering flame that Li Ximing recognized as Kong Tingyun’s. One level higher, on a gilded base, another solitary lamp burned brightly. This one, he presumed, corresponded to Kong Haiying.

At the very top rested a single, extinguished lamp on a jade throne inlaid with gold and silver patterns—the lamp of Changxi. Its presence alone made the stand astonishingly heavy, but as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Guest Elder Wu held it steady.

He wore a fawning expression, but the members of the Profound Peak Gate looked away in shame. To see the ancestral soul lamps, which were so revered in the ancestral hall that no one dared even touch them, brought out and presented like a platter of food was a deep humiliation.

But no one paid them any mind. All eyes were fixed on the lamps with a mixture of curiosity and awe. Only a crimson-robed young man standing behind Li Zhouwei kept his gaze fixed on the members of the Profound Peak Gate, his golden eyes sweeping over their faces.

Nearby, Sun Bo was gently patting Kong Guli’s sleeve in a comforting gesture, while Kong Qiuyan stood with her head bowed and eyes closed. Only Kong Guxi, the Sect Master of the Profound Peak Gate, stood at the forefront, his posture one of utmost reverence. Sensing the young man’s gaze, he lowered his head even further.

Li Jiangqian withdrew his gaze and gave a subtle nod to Li Quewan beside him. The woman, dressed in a long skirt of cloud-like satin, also glanced at Kong Guxi and asked through a secret art, “Is that the Sect Master of the Profound Peak Gate? The Daoist Master wants to investigate, so he had best cooperate.”

“Without Kong Guxi, the Profound Peak Gate’s lineage would have collapsed long ago. How else could they have held on until today?” Li Jiangqian replied. “I heard Granduncle Chenghui speak of him once. Let’s see how he handles this.”

The crowd remained silent, though whispers and speculations were already flying through private channels. Li Ximing was aware of this, but simply said, “Sect Master, please, explain.”

Kong Guxi hurried to comply. He stepped forward, lifted a sleeve, and pointed to the brightest soul lamp on the gilded base, the one a tier above Kong Tingyun’s. “This is the soul lamp of my granduncle, Kong Haiying.”

Several people craned their necks to get a better look. Li Ximing remained silent, letting Li Zhouwei speak for him. “Bring forth his portrait.”

Before Kong Guxi could even react, someone from below had already produced a scroll. Li Wen took it and unfurled it, revealing the image of a middle-aged man with a broad forehead and a square jaw. Tucked beneath it were at least a dozen other portraits, all depicting the same man with minor variations.

Kong Guxi knew without asking that they had been painted separately by his own disciples and guest elders to ensure accuracy. He simply lowered his head and said nothing. Guest Elder Wu stepped forward, examined the soul lamp, and announced respectfully, “Daoist Master, though Lord Haiying was often in seclusion, he made an appearance just before his breakthrough. I saw him then. The aura on this soul lamp is identical to his. This is without a doubt his soul lamp.”

It was an undeniable fact that the aura of a soul lamp was identical to that of its cultivator. Several others, including rogue cultivators who had met Kong Haiying, came forward to corroborate the claim.

Only then did Li Ximing sweep his spiritual sense over the lamp, committing the aura to memory.

He could have used the Immortal Mirror to learn the identity of everyone in seclusion, but such a matter had to be handled with extreme discretion. More importantly, of all the Profound Peak cultivators, he had only ever met Kong Tingyun. This meant that even if the Immortal Mirror revealed the faces of those in seclusion, he wouldn’t be able to identify them. Appearances could be easily disguised, and a Purple Mansion cultivator could fundamentally alter their own features. Only one’s aura was immutable.

Now that he had the aura from the soul lamp, he also had his people gather information on Fu En—his aura, cultivation level, and physical description. Though Kong Guxi was puzzled by the request, he complied without question. Fu En was rumored to be dead and thus had no soul lamp, but they managed to find a dharma artifact he had refined with his own blood. His portrait depicted a scarred, brutish-looking man whose features were far from flattering.

With this, Li Ximing was confident he could identify the person in seclusion. But this grand, public display was not merely about identifying an aura. It was about creating a justification for his subsequent judgments and actions. Whether he attributed his knowledge to divination or shamanism, it would prevent others from growing suspicious.

Kong Guxi remained kneeling, his posture unwavering. Finally, the Daoist Master on the seat of honor spoke.

“Do you have any of their personal belongings?”

Without a moment’s hesitation, Kong Guxi replied respectfully, “After several decades, most have been lost. Apart from Fu En’s artifact, which was preserved by chance, most of their other dharma artifacts have changed hands and lost their connection. Fortunately, Lord Haiying has living descendants. As for Lady Tingyun…”

“It matters not. Bring what you can.”

Li Ximing nodded. This whole affair was merely for show, so the details were unimportant. The items from Kong Haiying and Fu En would suffice. At his command, someone went to make the arrangements.

The public part of the proceedings was over. The vague request for “personal belongings” had planted a seed, leaving ample room for the various families to speculate. Now, whatever he did next would seem reasonable. Li Ximing waved a hand, dismissing the outsiders, and kept only Kong Guxi behind.

“I paid a visit to the Purple Smoke Gate and spoke with Daoist Master Tinglan,” Li Ximing said. “Shanji Prefecture cannot be held, and your sect’s mountain will be difficult to protect.”

A chilling cold spread through Kong Guxi’s heart. But Li Ximing quickly added a word of comfort. “Don’t overthink it. The old master foresaw this. It’s possible that neither of them is even within the sect. I am currently seeking a Daoist Master skilled in the divinatory arts to determine Kong Haiying’s exact location. If they are not on the mountain, we can make other plans.”

His words were like a torrent of scalding water, instantly melting the ice in Kong Guxi’s heart. His eyes reddened. ‘That’s right… The Ancestor was meticulous in his planning. He must have anticipated this. I mustn’t despair! I mustn’t despair!’

Seeing that he understood, Li Ximing vanished into the Great Void. Kong Guxi kowtowed deeply before rising and striding out of the courtyard. Though tear tracks still stained his face, his steps were markedly lighter. Li Chenghui was waiting outside the courtyard and spoke a few perfunctory words about confidentiality, but with so many eyes having witnessed the earlier events, secrecy was merely a pretense—a formality that Kong Guxi nevertheless acknowledged with solemn promises.

Once Li Chenghui departed, the entire mountain fell silent. The clamor of moments before seemed like a gust of wind, arriving and departing with equal swiftness. Feeling a bit faint, Kong Guxi exited the hall and saw that the stand with the soul lamps had been left in the courtyard. Kong Guli was staring at it from the steps, lost in thought.

He started to walk over, but noticed that Kong Qiuyan was gone. In the distance, he saw Kong Yu kneeling just outside the courtyard, kowtowing toward the table of soul lamps. Kong Guxi quickly stopped, not daring to approach or interrupt him. He simply called out, “Great-Granduncle…”

Kong Yu continued to kowtow, the sound of his forehead striking the ground echoing with dull thuds. After a full nine prostrations, the old man fell still, his face pressed to the ground. Kong Guxi waited a moment, but his spiritual sense screamed that something was wrong. His expression changed drastically as he rushed forward, crying out, “Great-Granduncle!”

He lifted Kong Yu and was met with a smear of dark blood that dripped from the old man’s nose.

The dark blood trickled like a small stream down the old man’s face, following the curve of his nose and neck. The face that was once so often wreathed in cheerful smiles was now dark and fixed in a rigid expression. The old man’s eyelids were pulled back to a shocking degree, revealing far too much of the whites of his eyes. His lips were twisted from repeated convulsions into a grotesque, mocking smile, and a look of profound terror was frozen deep within his gaze.

Kong Guxi felt a jolt of pure horror. The old man was dead.

His mind felt as though it had been struck by a hammer, and his vision swam with stars. He was paralyzed by a disbelieving terror, and it was only after two or three breaths that he heard Kong Guli shouting from behind him. “Why?” Kong Guxi asked blankly.

He had been prepared for any hardship, but he had never imagined that Kong Yu would take his own life so abruptly. Though the old man was aged and melancholic, he had never seemed suicidal… The situation had been awkward, yes, but it was nothing compared to the deep despair of the day the Ancestor’s last will was revealed. Perhaps this truly signaled the end of their mountain home, but that day had not yet come, had it? Was this necessary?

If it was the work of a divine ability… Li Ximing himself had just been on the mountain. Any such influence would have to have come from the Daoist Master himself. Had someone struck in the few dozen breaths since he left? What benefit was there in harming this old man?

His rational mind was shattered by this incomprehensible turn of events. For a moment, he didn’t even think to lower Kong Yu’s body, not until Kong Guli rushed over to take it from him. Kong Guli and Kong Yu came from two very close branches of the family, neither of which had been highly regarded in the past, and their bond was deep. He wailed as he took the old man’s body into his arms. Kong Guxi stood frozen, his pupils slowly dilating. He soon regained his senses and declared in a mournful voice, “Great-Granduncle could not bear to witness the destruction of the Profound Peak Gate, and so he took his own life.”

---

At the Profound Peak Gate.

Li Ximing tore through the Great Void and landed before the mountain. With a flick of his finger, a jade pendant flew from his sleeve. As it shone upon the grand array, the Purple Mansion-level formation, the Hundred Mountains Concealed Storage Spirit Array, opened on its own. Li Ximing stepped through with ease.

At this stage, the Li family was already in de facto control of most of the Profound Peak Gate’s assets. Only their scripture repository and treasury remained untouched. The grand array was no exception; Li Ximing’s authority within the formation now far surpassed Kong Guxi’s.

His light flared as he appeared within the array. He connected his spiritual sense to the formation’s core, ensuring the Great Void was sealed off. In an instant, every corner of the Profound Peak Gate was laid bare to him. The number of disciples on the mountain was pitifully small; he could scan several peaks before spotting one or two people.

As his thoughts turned, the locations of the various seclusion chambers appeared in his mind. ‘Connected to the grand array… there are five active seclusion chambers… and the one Kong Guxi showed me was separated from the array. That means… there are six in total.’

He adopted a thoughtful expression, but inwardly, he was reciting an incantation. ‘Li clan disciple, Ximing, respectfully petitions the Immortal Mirror: Patrol the unseen, plumb the subtle, pierce the profound, and illuminate all creation. Seize the ghostly, and expose the divine.’

He felt a chill emanate from his Shengyang Acupoint. The world around him, both in reality and in the Great Void, remained unchanged, but the range of his spiritual sense exploded. The entirety of the Profound Peak Gate, in all its truth and illusion, manifested within his mind.

‘As I thought… the chill from the Immortal Mirror doesn’t travel through the Great Void… It’s truly beyond the detection of gods and ghosts…’

He knew that very few things could function over vast distances. Soul lamps, life jades, arrays, secret arts—all used the Great Void as their medium. That was why a battle between Purple Mansion cultivators in the Great Void could often cause them to malfunction. In theory, one could even inadvertently destroy someone’s life jade or cause a small array to suddenly weaken or strengthen… But the chill from the Immortal Mirror, though he knew its source, seemed to appear from nothing, defying all his understanding. The thought sent a shiver down his spine.

He pushed these stray thoughts aside and focused. His spiritual sense found the nearest seclusion chamber and passed through its protective wards as if they weren’t there. Inside the pitch-black chamber, a skeleton sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, surrounded by scattered flecks of golden light.

“A failed breakthrough to Foundation Establishment. It’s Heavenly Gilded Helm.”

This was almost certainly one of the enforcers Changxi had cultivated. He hadn’t made it through the trial, and with the Profound Peak Gate in its current, empty state, no one had been around to tend to his body. It had simply been left in the cave.

Li Ximing withdrew his spiritual sense and moved to the next chamber. He found the stone room completely empty, with only the formation operating on its own.

He checked the remaining three chambers one by one. Aside from another corpse, the other two were also empty. Finally, he arrived at the chamber Kong Guxi had pointed out—the one where Kong Tingyun was supposedly in seclusion.

This place was deliberately hidden, not even connected to the grand array. The gate was forged from Profound-Vein Stone, which isolated the inside from the out and was beneficial for cultivators of the Earth Virtue. Li Ximing’s spiritual sense passed through the stone and found the interior covered in a thick layer of spirit earth. The spiritual energy was incredibly dense, and within it, a cold, star-like point of profundity glimmered.

The cultivator’s physical body seemed to have mostly dissolved into spiritual energy to fuel the breakthrough, and it was shrouded in the dense mist. But the aura was laid bare before him, and in the next moment, Li Ximing recognized it.

“It’s Fu En…”

Inside the seclusion chamber meant for Kong Tingyun… was the guest elder, Fu En!

‘Such dense spiritual qi. The Profound Peak Gate truly provided him with the best conditions… They even used spirit stones to enrich this place. It’s far better than my own setup back on Mount Wu. And this man, though just a guest elder… his cultivation is remarkably solid…’

“But Changxi, oh, Changxi… who was it that died all those years ago?”

With the soul lamps of both Kong Haiying and Kong Tingyun still burning, Changxi’s plan became clear. He knew his sect would inevitably be occupied. He had arranged for those two to be somewhere else entirely, leaving only Fu En behind on the mountain!

As for the one who had perished back then… it was most likely a pawn, a substitute meant to die in his place!

“So… when my Li family can no longer withstand the pressure and is forced to abandon the Profound Peak Gate, the only one who dies will be Fu En. As for Kong Tingyun and Kong Haiying… they are somewhere safe, calmly working on their breakthroughs…”

“In that case… I cannot wait any longer…”

If it had been Kong Haiying or Kong Tingyun—direct descendants of the Profound Peak Gate—Li Ximing might have gritted his teeth and tried to find another way, some way to save them. But the person inside was merely Fu En, a guest elder who had no connection to his family. He could not continue to bear the pressure of holding Shanji Prefecture and the Profound Peak Gate for him…

Li Ximing sighed softly. It was a desperate situation for the person in seclusion—to be in the middle of a breakthrough, only to have their sect become someone else’s property. He could imagine the despair. But he had never considered himself a saint. He had no obligation to make sacrifices for a stranger and invite disaster upon his own clan. He could only offer what help he could without harming his own interests.

‘Since the mountain must be relinquished,’ he thought with a quiet sigh, ‘I will do my best to negotiate with the Purple Smoke Gate. When they send a Purple Mansion cultivator to take over… perhaps they can be persuaded to leave him here to finish his breakthrough. His chances of success are slim anyway. When he eventually perishes, his essence will only enrich the spiritual qi of this place. And in the one-in-a-million chance that he succeeds… he’s still just an outsider… We can discuss it further.’

He organized his thoughts, crafting the narrative he would present.

‘Alright… from this moment on, the soul lamps were tampered with by Changxi. The first to die will be Kong Haiying, who is actually Fu En inside the sect. Kong Tingyun will be declared missing. By relinquishing the mountain this way, I can ease tensions with the Capital immortals Dao and give the Purple Smoke Gate a satisfactory explanation. Whether they believe me or not is a problem for another day.’

# Chapter 748: The Jiangque Generation

A pale golden vessel soared through the skies above the untamed wilderness, gliding on currents of cloud. A man in white robes stood at its center, flanked by Li Jiangqian and Li Quewan who waited in silence. At the stern, Li Wen stood guard, his golden melon hammer in hand.

Li Zhouwei had spent a single night at the Profound Peak Gate's outpost before departing. He rarely wore white, but today was the anniversary of his father, Li Chengliao's, passing. He had changed his robes for the occasion and now stood with one hand resting on the vessel's railing, lost in thought.

The Li family possessed few flying artifacts, and vessels like this were seldom used. The main reason was the sheer number of cultivators under their domain across the Eastern and Northern Yue mountains. The clan had so many members that some had to be sent away to forge their own paths, and many of these poorer cultivators could already fly on their own. For most tasks, providing such equipment was simply unnecessary.

As for the direct descendants and talented outsiders within the prefecture, they were kept on a tight leash. Their days were filled with training and duties, and their responsibilities rarely took them more than a hundred li from their posts. Few would bother acquiring a personal flying shuttle, save for a handful of favored children who received them as gifts from their parents.

Li Jiangqian and his brothers certainly wouldn't dare request one. After all, neither Li Ximing nor Li Zhouwei had requisitioned a flying artifact from the clan during their own training. Since these younger brothers weren't being dispatched to the northern frontier or the Eastern Sea, they had even less of a reason to ask.

The vessel they stood upon, named the _Quhe_, was the first flying artifact the Li family had commissioned after becoming an Immortal Clan. It was the final work of the old West Bank cultivator, He Jiumen. Among artifacts for Qi Refining cultivators, it was of high quality. Unfortunately, He Jiumen came from a humble background and knew nothing of the Dao of Transformations; the spirit vessel could not change its size, making it a far cry from Ning Wan's Ever-Verdant Flowing Cloud Boat. In every other respect, however, it was impressive. And since outsiders wouldn't know of its limitation, it was still a presentable craft.

The vessel cut through the wind, racing toward the Eastern Shore. After Li Zhouwei had stood for some time, Li Wen approached with a dark-colored, handwritten letter. He glanced at it briefly before tucking it into his sleeve.

'Kong Yu has taken his own life…'

Standing behind him, Li Jiangqian noticed no change in his father's expression. The spirit vessel, however, began to slow, coming to a halt in a mountainous region of the Eastern Shore. A moment later, a commotion arose from below as a young man on a black horse with crimson eyes charged forth. Reaching them, he leaped from his steed and onto the vessel.

"Father!" he announced respectfully.

Li Jiangqian recognized him as his third brother, Li Jiangxia, and watched with a faint smile. Their father’s voice was gentle enough.

"It has been some time. Your second brother has also returned from the Profound Peak Gate. Come aboard; we'll return to the lake together."

A wide smile spread across Li Jiangxia’s face. He bowed to Li Jiangqian and Li Quewan. "It has been too long, Elder Brother. I have missed you dearly."

Li Jiangqian had spent a fair amount of time with his second brother, Li Jianglong, but had only met Li Jiangxia a few times. It truly had been a long while.

He returned the smile. "Third Brother, your cultivation has improved. You must practice diligently during the Qi Refining realm. How are your techniques coming along? Your Dao foundation is paramount, so you should seize the time to master some protective arts. It will be a great benefit when you break through to Foundation Establishment!"

Li Jiangxia raised an eyebrow, his own smile unwavering. "The clan's affairs are numerous, and Elder Brother must be exhausted from managing them, yet you still think of me… Thank you for your concern. I will remember your words."

They left it at that. Li Zhouwei had heard the exchange but said nothing. The vessel sped onward, and soon Moongaze Lake appeared on the horizon. Li Quewan, after much deliberation, finally spoke.

"Patriarch… regarding the scrying for the Profound Peak Gate's direct disciples, I'm afraid it will be quite difficult. My shamanic arts are already stretched to their limits when divining for Foundation Establishment cultivators. For those breaking through to the Purple Mansion realm, the task is harder still…"

Everyone present had understood that Li Ximing's earlier talk of personal effects was related to divination. Li Zhouwei, however, knew the Daoist Master had simply used the Immortal Mirror and was looking for an excuse. "Do not worry," he replied. "A Daoist Master will be asked to handle this. You need not trouble yourself."

Relieved, Li Quewan stepped back. When the spirit vessel landed smoothly within the prefecture, Li Jiangqian followed close behind Li Zhouwei into the main hall. As they walked down a corridor, they saw a man in a black robe standing before the hall's entrance.

The man stood with his head bowed, a string of jade tied at his waist. It took Li Jiangqian a moment to recognize his own brother, Li Jianglong.

In the past two years, he had matured. The last traces of his immaturity had faded, his golden eyes and long brows set in a face that held the magnanimity of the Chen clan. His entire demeanor had changed, making him seem far more docile.

Li Zhouwei took the main seat. Li Jiangqian moved to stand at his left and heard his father command, "Bring Liang'er and Nian'er."

Li Jiangqian continued to observe Li Jianglong, who had retreated to a corner and bowed without a word, his gaze fixed on the floor—a stark contrast to Li Jiangxia's cheerful and forthright manner.

Below, Li Jiangxia was already reporting on matters concerning the Eastern Shore. Since these reports had already been submitted to the prefecture, Li Jiangqian listened with only half an ear. He had to admit, his third brother was quite capable. With the full support Li Jiangqian had provided him, along with the dispatch of several of the Li family’s most competent members, the chaotic Eastern Shore had been brought firmly under control. The various families had submitted, and their direct heirs had been sent to the Secret Forest.

Just as he finished his report, Li Jiangliang and Li Jiangnian entered the hall. Li Jiangqian’s appraising gaze swept over them. The one in front, Li Jiangliang, had a pair of golden eyes and a handsome, clever face. He fell to his knees before the throne and respectfully called out, "Father."

There was nothing unusual about his brother's appearance, and Li Jiangqian's eyes merely slid past his fourth brother, Li Jiangliang, to land on Li Jiangnian, who followed behind.

The young man's pupils dilated slightly. For the first time, an emotion other than his usual calm assessment—pure astonishment—flickered across his face. He wasn't the only one. With the exception of Li Zhouwei and Li Jiangnian himself, everyone in the hall seemed to stop breathing for a split second.

The boy's eyebrows were faint, his cheekbones alarmingly high, and his chin sharp, with the skin stretched taut across his face. If Li Jianglong, the plainest of the Jiangque generation, could at least be called kindly-featured, it was difficult to find a single redeeming quality in Li Jiangnian's appearance.

But Li Jiangqian was not one to judge by looks. His attention wasn't on his youngest brother's face at all. With a jolt, his gaze locked onto the eyes beneath Li Jiangnian's lashes, his hand clenching and unclenching at his side.

They were a pair of bewildered, gray eyes.

Li Jiangliang's voice was still echoing in the hall as Li Zhouwei asked him a few concerned questions, but no one was paying him any attention. All eyes were fixed on Li Jiangnian. The child seemed slow to react, completely oblivious to the scrutiny as he watched his brother answer their father’s questions.

After a few more questions for his fourth son, Li Zhouwei finally turned his attention. "Jiangnian, what is your cultivation level now?"

Li Jiangnian's eyes were slightly uneven in size, giving him a somewhat comical look. Nerves made tears well up instantly, and he choked out, "The… the second layer of Embryonic Breathing."

As he had only just begun his cultivation, this was a bit lower than Li Jiangliang's level, but not terrible. Yet a heavy silence fell over his brothers. Li Jiangliang stood properly at the front, the contrast between them painfully sharp. Li Zhouwei looked away.

"I have summoned you today for two reasons," he began. "First, to inquire about your cultivation and see your progress. Second, as I am about to enter seclusion, I have some instructions for you."

Li Zhouwei's cultivation was already at a level where he could attempt a breakthrough to the late stage of Foundation Establishment. With Li Ximing's new arrangements for the Profound Peak Gate and the confirmation that Shanji Prefecture would be abandoned, there was no longer any reason to wait.

He first looked to Li Jiangqian. "Jiangqian, you are at the eighth layer of Qi Refining and already have the confidence to attempt your breakthrough. For now, continue to polish your cultivation and practice your techniques. You will remain in charge of the prefecture. Your Uncle Chenghuai is shifting his focus to cultivation, and Zhouluo has taken charge of Mount Qingdu. The clan has many affairs to attend to, so you and your uncle must consult with each other often."

Li Jiangqian bowed deeply.

His father continued, "Jianglong, your cultivation has progressed these past two years, and you have studied many of the Profound Peak Gate’s techniques. You will go to the Funan territory and take over the positions of Fei Qingyi and Li Anshuo. They will be under your command. You are to report to the elder of Minggong Palace."

At these words, Li Jiangxia let out a quiet sigh of relief. He was currently managing the families of the Eastern Shore under the jurisdiction of the Secret Forest, where he had also established a palace. He was, for all intents and purposes, the forest's superior. His greatest fear had been that Li Jianglong would be given control of the Secret Forest, which would have meant handing over all his hard-won efforts.

Li Jianglong accepted the appointment respectfully, showing no surprise. Li Anshuo's wife was a member of the Chen clan, part of his mother's lineage. He had already dealt with the man and held leverage over him, a fact Li Zhouwei was surely aware of. Since Li Anshuo managed the mundane affairs in Funan, it was only logical that Li Jianglong be sent there.

Having settled the first two, Li Zhouwei's voice grew stern. "Jiangxia will remain in charge of the Eastern Shore. That area borders the wilderness, and its stability is of the utmost importance. Among you brothers, only you have the necessary experience. There is no need for a change."

Li Jiangxia quickly bowed in thanks. By the time he rose, the power within the Li family had been transferred from the Foundation Establishment elders to the younger Qi Refining generation with astonishing speed.

Li Zhouwei surveyed his sons, a faint smile playing on his lips. After a moment's pause, he said, "Zhouluo governs Mount Qingdu, and Li Wen will return to the Jade Court. Only the Secret Forest remains without a master. Do any of you have a candidate in mind?"

Li Jiangqian immediately spoke. "Clan Elder Donghe is worthy of this position."

His words caused little reaction among his brothers. Even Li Jianglong, whose mother was from the Chen clan, remained impassive. The reason was simple: the old man's status was high, and he was impervious to both threats and favors. He was notoriously strict with his own family, to the point that the Chen clansmen feared even mentioning his name, let alone thinking of him as a backer. He would be of no benefit to Li Jianglong.

Li Jianglong, for his part, said, "I have been away for a long time and am unaware of the recent changes in the clan. I dare not make a suggestion. However, this position is crucial. A senior Foundation Establishment cultivator should be appointed to it."

With his refusal, Li Jiangxia did not hesitate. "The position of master of the Secret Forest is too important. It should be held by a family member who is upright and honest. It has long been vacant, and with several elders away, it seems to me that it would be best to leave it empty for now. We could appoint a few respected elders to the palace council. They could handle the affairs of the Eastern Shore. Too many people can lead to disunity, and it would be more convenient for Elder Brother to mediate from the center."

Li Zhouwei was dabbing a vermillion brush in ink, writing out the orders for their appointments. His children's words caused not a single ripple in his composure. He only chuckled softly.

'They each have their own clever schemes.'

Li Jiangqian, in charge of the prefecture, prioritized stability above all else. He didn't want an overly powerful master of the Secret Forest, so a rule-abiding Qi Refining elder like Chen Donghe best suited his interests.

Li Jiangxia's words were pleasant, but his intention was simply to avoid having a direct superior who could interfere with his work. Li Jiangqian was far away at the lake, but the master of the Secret Forest would be right on his doorstep, with power over any personnel sent there. Of course, he preferred the position to remain vacant.

That left Li Jianglong. Stationed far away in Funan, he cared little about the state of the Secret Forest. However, installing a strong Foundation Establishment cultivator would prevent his two brothers from consolidating too much power, which was certainly a good thing for him.

Li Zhouwei saw through them all. "Cui Jueyin is from Chongzhou," he announced, his decision made. "He has a talent for governance, a profound Dao foundation, and is skilled in techniques. The position will be his… Jiangliang, you will also go to the Secret Forest to cultivate. You've spent enough time in the prefecture."

Li Jiangliang quickly bowed. Though clever, he was still young and didn't fully grasp the implications, but he accepted with a smile. Li Zhouwei's gaze then fell upon his youngest, Li Jiangnian, and he let out an almost imperceptible sigh.

"As for Nian'er… he will first cultivate in the prefecture. We can speak of other things when he reaches the Qi Refining realm. You are all dismissed!"

The brothers bowed and retreated. The moment he was outside the hall, Li Jianglong took Li Jiangliang's hand, his face wreathed in a cheerful smile. "Liang'er, you are so bright. That Senior Cui is a direct descendant from Chongzhou. Follow him and learn well."

**Azure Pond Sect, Heaven-Probing Pavilion.**

A spring rain had just passed, leaving the stone steps gleaming. Li Xizhi, draped in a feathered cloak, sat at a table, pouring tea from a jade pot. The liquid shone a brilliant green in the cup, its fragrance sharp and refreshing.

"This is Hundred-Year Spring, brewed with the rainwater," he said with a smile. "You must try it, my lady."

The woman beside him smiled back, her eyes on him as she picked up the cup and took a delicate sip. She watched as he prepared another tea, setting a new cup to the side.

"This cup," Li Xizhi said, his tone more serious, "is Sobering Warmth. It's a graded spirit item, made from authentic Qi Refining-level ingredients. It may not be as pleasant to drink, but it has the effect of calming the heart, quieting the mind, and stabilizing one's cultivation."

Yang Xiao'er took the cup, her gaze still fixed on him. "You were in seclusion for so long," she said with a smile. "I missed you terribly."

"You…" Li Xizhi began. "For us Foundation Establishment cultivators, a few months in seclusion feel like a mere few hours. And you're already missing me again?"

Yang Xiao'er sipped her tea. "And why not?"

Li Xizhi chuckled, then his expression turned serious again. "Your Immortal Foundation, the Treasured Reservoir, is formidable. Do not underestimate it. In its own way, it is as profound as my family's Radiant Origin Pass. The Yang family went to great lengths to acquire such a thing for you; you must focus on your cultivation."

At the mention of the Yang family, she paused for a moment. Just then, a figure came up the mountain path. Dressed in silver-white robes and a neat jade crown, with a magnificent red brocade cloak draped over his shoulders, was a round-faced young man—his head disciple, Quan Yuduan.

The boy was prone to dramatics. "Master!" he exclaimed, rushing forward. "That Dantai Jin has come, and he's brought Si Tongyi with him! Protector Wushao has gone to greet them. They're already on the mountain!"

Hearing this, Yang Xiao'er immediately rose from her seat. Li Xizhi, however, looked exasperated.

"I thought it was something serious," he said, shaking his head. "Yuduan, your temperament is still lacking… and so is your conduct. You do everything based on your whims. You are not the scion of some great house or the direct heir of a Golden Core Daoist Master. Who gave you so many airs? Your junior brother has already left the mountain for his training. Until the day you change this attitude, you are forbidden from leaving!"

Quan Yuduan's expression immediately sobered. He nodded in acknowledgment. The Heaven-Probing Pavilion was dreadfully boring, and he often longed to go out. "Disciple will remember!" he said quickly.

As he retreated, a man in an ornate headdress ascended the path. His cultivation was at the late stage of Foundation Establishment, and his bearing was elegant and otherworldly. A short sword hung at his waist, and his face was a picture of courtesy.

"Greetings, Pavilion Master!" he said with a smile.
