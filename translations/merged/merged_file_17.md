# Chapter 849: Immortal Dao Wall

The Eastern Sea.

The water was a profound, abyssal dark. A long canyon, its bottom lost to sight, was shrouded in gloom. A streak of azure light shot through the depths, weaving through the water like a fish. Yet, there wasn't a single living creature to be seen—only the oppressive, dark sea.

After an unknowable amount of time, the pale gray canyon floor came into view. Layers of fine, light gray debris drifted in the currents, revealing the stark white reef below. The azure light shifted, transforming on the seabed into a man in azure robes.

The man wore fine azure clothing, a golden tassel hanging from his belt. With his handsome face, azure eyes, and long, unbound hair, he stood firm on the seafloor and surveyed his surroundings.

It was Chi Buzi.

***

The seabed near the coast was shallow and rich with spiritual energy; it had all once been land, much like the six great prefectures to the south. But past Green Pine Island and Splitreed Island, the seafloor plunged dramatically, marking the ancient coastline.

This place was not far from Splitreed Island. To reach it, one had to traverse the densest region of spiritual energy, travel near Bamboo Creek Island, and then descend between the earth veins to find this deep canyon and follow it to the bottom.

The inner records of the Azure Pond Sect mentioned that Daoist Master Yuansu had cultivated at the bottom of this canyon for a very long time. The deepest parts here plunged far below the floor of the Vermillion Sea, likely even deeper than the great chasm on Splitreed Island itself.

What made it truly exceptional was the complete absence of spiritual energy within the canyon. It was like traveling through the Great Void. No Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, even if they searched for a hundred or a thousand years, could ever hope to discover this place.

This lack of spiritual energy also made travel treacherous. Even a mighty Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had to rely on their own dharma power to descend, a journey that would take no less than four or five days at their speed. As for a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, they might possess the ability to get down, but they would most certainly lack the power to fly back up in such a null environment.

Chi Buzi stood on the pitch-black canyon floor. He crouched down and, with a push of his dharma power, swept aside the rolling white sand. The movement revealed a flat stone platform, upon which was inscribed a single, simple golden circle.

He formed a hand seal, recited an incantation in his mind, and pressed his palm onto the platform. As he poured his power into it, layers of profound light began to glow. The dark, lightless canyon floor was finally illuminated by faint golden specks.

But Chi Buzi’s expression was grave. He remained perfectly still, not daring to move.

He knew this place was protected by countless layers of restrictive formations. The slightest ripple of power could unleash more trouble than he could handle. The very bottom layer was an immortal formation; if he triggered its defenses, annihilation would be certain.

He waited for a long while before the golden light on the platform finally shifted to white. The circle flared brightly for a moment before dimming, leaving a single, sparkling point of light at its center.

*Shing!*

With great caution, Chi Buzi drew the Dharma sword from his waist. He flicked a mote of azure light from its tip into the glowing point. After waiting a moment, he reached out and drew the light back, confirming there was no ambush waiting for him. Only then did his form blur, transforming into a streak of azure light that shot into the portal.

***

An unknown time later, a dim light appeared before him. He found himself on another seabed entirely.

The first thing he saw was a towering undersea cliff adorned with fields of coral. The area was littered with ruins and rubble. The remains of collapsed, grayish-white stone walls lay at the cliff's base, and the ground was scattered with broken tiles of all sizes that shimmered with faint, colorful light. Sunlight, filtering down from above, dappled the ground like shimmering scales.

Looking up, he could see the glittering surface of the sea, a sheet of brilliant white from his vantage point. The sun was blazing in the sky. He estimated the cliff was thousands of feet high, its peak nearly breaking the surface.

Chi Buzi paused, a little lost in thought. He took a few steps forward. When nothing happened, he retrieved the tripod-shaped spiritual artifact from his robes and began to scan the entire area.

He moved east until he reached the edge of this pocket sea. Though he could still see endless coral reefs stretching into the distance, his hands met an invisible barrier. He followed the boundary, circling the entire area to ensure he was alone before he began his ascent up the cliff.

The higher he climbed, the brighter the sunlight became. Halfway up the cliffside, Chi Buzi discovered a large stone table surrounded by more than a dozen high-backed stone chairs, most of them overturned and scattered. The scene was one of ruin and desolation. On the single intact chair, a white Daoist robe was draped, swaying gently in the unseen currents.

The tabletop was a mess of bronze wine goblets, some standing, some toppled over. A single jade flask sat silently amidst the clutter. There was nothing else.

Chi Buzi had been here many times. The first time was with Chi Wei, and it was here that the first seeds of defiance against Pristine Water had been planted in his heart. The stone table had been here even then, and a suffocating sense of danger arose whenever he drew near.

As before, Chi Buzi carefully skirted the area and continued his climb. At the very peak of the cliff, he finally saw it: a shimmering stone wall. It was about the height of a man and as thick as two palms pressed together. Countless tiny, ant-sized golden characters floated across its surface. Here, he was only a few yards from the surface; it felt as if a single leap would allow him to break through into the open air.

Chi Buzi paid it no mind and slowly sat down.

According to Chi Wei, the space beyond the water's surface was filled with the ancient Golden Crow's Transmuting Radiance. Anyone who dared to stick their head out would be instantly incinerated. Even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would face certain death.

As for the Immortal Dao Wall, Chi Wei and Ning Tiaoxiao had been here. Qiushui and Daoist Master Tianyuan had been here. Even Zimu, who was once hailed as the cultivator with the highest Dao attainment of his generation, had come. Every Daoist Master who had visited this place was a prodigy of their era, yet not a single one could remember a single word written on the wall. The name "Immortal Dao Wall" itself had come from Li Jiangqun.

Whether Li Jiangqun himself could remember its contents, only he knew.

Chi Buzi bowed slowly. With his dharma power, he traced a series of arcane patterns on the ground. His voice was low and resonant as he began to chant.

"I, the humble cultivator Chi Buzi… pray to the Heavenly Officials to ward off disaster and exorcise evil…"

***

In the world within the Immortal Mirror.

Wind and clouds surged across the land. Lu Jiangxian stood quietly inside his snow-swept cave abode, the image of the undersea stone wall swiftly reflected in his pupils.

His gaze lifted slightly, sweeping over the reflection of the Golden Crow's Transmuting Radiance. Golden runes streamed from his eyes, spiraling around his body, growing ever brighter until they coalesced before him into lines of elegant small seal script.

*The Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core*!

As the techniques from his memory surfaced one by one, Lu Jiangxian looked up. Sheets of profound light rained down around him.

The full name of the technique was the *Supreme Technique of the Immortal Dao for Seeking Transformation through the Unified Golden Core*. It shared the same origin as the *Wondrous Technique of True Attainment* he had obtained from the Three-Drum Wall; both were recorded in small seal script.

The difference was that the *Wondrous Technique of True Attainment*, contained within the Dharma Treasure known as the Three-Drum Wall, was an immortal art for cultivating a Golden Core. The *Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core*, however, was a supreme method used by ancient immortals to evade calamities and establish a domain in the azure heavens. It taught one how to hold a Fruition Attainment while simultaneously achieving an Auxiliary Position, or how to gain an Intercalary Position without ever abandoning the first.

The text of this art was concise, yet its variations were infinite, spanning nearly ten million words of detailed explanations for its different permutations. Its primary purpose was to guide a cultivator on how to hold a Fruition Attainment while seeking one of several Auxiliary Positions, and how to achieve an Intercalary Position without relinquishing their Fruition Attainment. The "cultivators" it spoke of were what modern practitioners would call Dao Embryo immortals—beings of whom only a handful existed in the current era.

For now, the art’s primary function was beyond Lu Jiangxian’s reach. At most, it offered some minor convenience in helping him write a Golden Core attainment method for Chi Buzi, but the principles of dual cultivation and achieving an Intercalary Position were not very similar. The art was only helpful due to its incredibly high-level perspective.

But its second function was not to be underestimated: *evading calamities and establishing a domain in the azure heavens.*

This art could erase one's traces from the mortal world, preventing detection by others. It could also use one's personal status to conceal a grotto-heaven and construct an immortal realm.

‘The Immortal Mirror’s status is already incredibly high, so it can erase my tracks by default,’ Lu Jiangxian thought. ‘But the second ability… this is a genuine ancient method for constructing an immortal realm!’

This was no simple matter of hanging a grotto-heaven in the Great Void. In ancient times, when Auxiliary and Intercalary Positions were common, opening a grotto-heaven was simple. Even a spiritual artifact could contain a cave abode. The lowest tier of these were the secret realms opened by ordinary cultivators inside spiritual artifacts or on auspicious lands, known as halls or caves. With the changes in the world, these have all long since collapsed.

Only the secret realms established in the Great Void or anchored to powerful auspicious lands by great sects and factions had a chance of surviving to this day. The imperial clans typically created "palaces," while immortal cultivators favored "halls." If properly sealed, these could still exist. The Great Ning Palace was such a place. However, even these realms could be affected by shifts in the mortal world's spiritual atmosphere, causing them to suddenly manifest or for an entrance to appear.

Among these was a special category: the blessed lands of the Purple Smoke and Hengzhu families. Only after obtaining the *Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core* did Lu Jiangxian truly understand them. Blessed lands were typically the work of Golden Core-level experts. By expending their cultivation and divine abilities, they could link a physical location to a Fruition Attainment. This would cause all sorts of phenomena to occur in the area, making it more favorable for certain types of cultivators, even aiding breakthroughs to the Foundation Establishment Realm, the refinement of divine abilities, or the quest for a Fruition Attainment.

The highest tier of all were the grotto-heavens, created by a True Monarch and anchored to their Fruition Attainment. These were known as "heavens." If the True Monarch was exceptionally powerful and their grotto-heaven vast, it might even be called a "dharma-realm," a domain of astonishing size.

The *Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core* provided a method to construct such a grotto-heaven, a way to partition reality itself. This immortal realm would be anchored to one's status, not to the Great Void or a magical artifact. As an immortal-grade art, it relied on only two things: status, and the user's own dharma power and divine abilities.

With this method, the two effects combined meant he could use his status to open a grotto-heaven and silently create a gateway in the mortal world, allowing people to enter with their physical bodies!

And status was the one thing Lu Jiangxian had in abundance. The Immortal Mirror itself already contained a world! He simply hadn't understood the principles before, which was why he could only pull in souls.

He turned his head sharply, his gaze falling upon the world within the Mirror, which loomed, half-hidden, in the clouds behind him. In that instant, his understanding of this realm soared to its absolute peak.

This world was a creation of supreme skill, anchored to the Immortal Mirror and completely isolated from the Great Void. It was half-real, half-illusory, which was why he was nearly invincible within it. To contact the Great Void from here, one had to go through the Immortal Mirror, and since the Mirror itself was beyond perception, the entire realm remained undetectable.

But this came with a drawback. The Immortal Mirror did not simply draw people in. The only way for an outsider to enter was to come into physical contact with the Mirror's body. Only by using methods like scrying or soul-searching to link a person's soul and destiny to the Mirror could they possibly gain entry.

When Lu Jiangxian had first obtained this world, it was nothing more than a single mountain range under a dreary, gray sky. Even then, he was its master, sealed off from the outside world. As his strength grew, the world within the Mirror had gradually transformed.

This realm was a mix of real and illusory. The Immortal Palace above the clouds was a manifestation of his will, but the mountain range below was tangible and real. Now, with the *Wondrous Art*, he could forcibly create an entrance in the mortal world for others to enter.

Take Chi Buzi, for example. He could now enter this place in his physical body. To him, once inside, there would be no difference between the celestial palace in the clouds and the ruined mountains below; both would seem equally real. However, if he tried to take something out, an object from the celestial palace would dissipate into a mere wisp of Supreme Yin moonlight. But the stones and soil from the mountains below? Those could be brought out into the real world.

‘Real or fake, it makes little difference to them,’ Lu Jiangxian mused. ‘And I would never allow them to take anything out. Even a single pebble from this world could become a fatal poison if it reached the outside!’

As his power continued to grow, he found it increasingly difficult to imagine the terrifying power of the enemy who had shattered the Immortal Mirror. It must have been a being on the level of an immortal. What cataclysmic battles had this mountain range witnessed? What traces remained? He could not afford to be careless.

More importantly, it wasn't just a matter of entry and exit. Lu Jiangxian strongly suspected that the Immortal Mirror contained a complete Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment. If he directly linked it to the outside world, the *Wondrous Art* could hide his tracks, but the response of heaven and earth to the appearance of a Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment could not be faked. Auspicious phenomena would erupt everywhere. Mount Luoxia and the Underworld would be thrown into a panic. Even if they couldn't find him, it would alert his enemies.

But this was the world inherent to the Immortal Mirror. It did not mean he couldn't use the *Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core* to create an entirely new one. The immense status granted to him by the Mirror and the high-quality, unending supply of power he now commanded were the perfect fuel for constructing a domain in the azure heavens!

He raised his hand, his robes fluttering around him as boundless light gathered in his palm. Countless brilliant ideas flooded his mind. Specks of white light appeared in his hand, coalescing into a sphere of pure whiteness.

This sphere of pure white expanded rapidly, yet it had no connection to the Great Void. Shielded by the power of the *Wondrous Art*, earth, water, fire, and wind began to surge within it, releasing waves of profound light.

'I will rely on my own status to forge a new realm—a true Immortal Palace domain. I will use it to interact with the mortal world, to allow the Li clan to enter, to influence the great powers of the world, and to collect the fragments!'

# Chapter 850: Supreme Yang's Transmuting Radiance

A pure white brilliance shot forth from the snow, stirring up a rolling tide of Supreme Yin radiance. It emerged in the heavens like a great vortex, spreading across the sky until it gradually enveloped the vast complex of palaces that stood amidst the ethereal clouds and mist.

The next moment, a pure, golden-red dawn shimmered in the east as the hazy, silver-white light of a bright moon set in the west. The world within the Immortal Mirror, once perpetually dim, hazy, and shrouded in dark clouds, vanished. In its place, the crystal-clear splendor of the sun and moon shone forth.

This newly carved-out grotto-heaven presented the wondrous sight of the sun and moon sharing the sky. The world was vast and boundless, wreathed in clouds and mist—unconnected to the heavens above or the earth below, composed of nothing but layer upon layer of swirling vapors.

Lu Jiangxian manifested his form within it and gauged the world’s size. It was roughly a hundred li across, similar to the Li Clan’s Pingya Island. However, with its vertical dimension, the space felt significantly larger, forming an almost spherical domain.

But this was far from the grotto-heaven’s limit. *The Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core* built a world based on one’s Attainment, using divine abilities and dharma power as its foundation. As he continued to channel his power into it, this realm would expand bit by bit until his Attainment could no longer sustain it.

'Still, like all grotto-heavens, this realm has no connection to the Great Void. It won't generate its own fire or water veins, and it can only contain things aligned with my own Attainment. It can’t be considered a truly complete world…'

'More importantly, a grotto-heaven doesn't naturally nurture spiritual objects. Without a link to the mortal realm, it can barely gather any spiritual energy, relying only on what little it can draw from the Great Void.'

Lu Jiangxian’s grotto-heaven was even more isolated, completely cut off from the Great Void. This meant that if he didn't actively channel his own divine power and Supreme Yin essence into it, the world would be almost entirely devoid of spiritual energy.

"As it stands, the divine power flowing from the Immortal Mirror is endless. In a year, I can add another space the size of Pingya Island. In ten, it could rival Moongaze Lake, and in a century, it might compare to the entire domain of the Azure Pond Sect…"

"That’s not slow at all. Once the Immortal Palace is the size of Moongaze Lake, if I forbid flight and fill it with pavilions and towers, no one would ever be able to tell how large it truly is."

Lu Jiangxian had once entered *Anhuai Heaven*, the grotto-heaven left behind by the renowned True Monarch Tianwu of True Qi. By his estimation, that domain was less than half the size of the Azure Pond Sect’s territory.

He gave a light wave of his sleeve, and wisps of Supreme Yin radiance streamed out, coalescing among the clouds at his feet. They rapidly formed a seemingly endless, pale-white platform. One after another, osmanthus trees sprouted from the ground, and at the very center, a moon-white round table adorned with profound patterns rose into place.

He strode to the table, and with another sweep of his sleeve, an assortment of items appeared upon its surface.

The first things to catch his eye were two small pots. One was formed from the demon body and divine ability of Shaohui; the other held the dharma body and soul of the male peacock. Both contained the concentrated essence of a Purple Mansion Realm demon beast.

He could have used both pots to expand the grotto-heaven, saving himself two or three years of effort. But while his divine power was inexhaustible, the essence of a Purple Mansion Realm expert was not so easily obtained. It would be even more difficult to acquire once Pristine Water returned.

Beside them lay a golden pearl and a azure talisman. The pearl was a vessel for all the karma and fate left behind by Li Xuanfeng—useless for now. The talisman was for Li Zhouwei, intended to help him directly form a second divine ability after he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm.

Finally, there was a faint, finger-sized sliver of silver light.

This was a remnant of the divinatory power he had obtained from Liu Changdie long ago. It was an extension of the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination, a technique that had served him well in his early years. After using most of it, he had kept this thumb-sized piece for reference.

'There's still no trace of the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination…'

After so many years of growth, Lu Jiangxian had a new theory about the talisman’s location.

"It must be like the Immortal Dao Wall, hidden away in some grotto-heaven or secret realm. That would explain why Liu Changdie came into contact with the talisman but left no trail. He must have accidentally stumbled upon the entrance to that hidden domain…"

"His activities were centered around Lixia Prefecture, stretching to Yuebei and Jiangbei… There are only a handful of grotto-heavens in that area. The Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven and Anhuai Heaven can be ruled out. That leaves Wanling Heaven of the Wanling Upper Sect and Donghua Heaven of the Moonlight Origin Mansion."

Although Wanling Heaven was not connected to the mortal realm, it interacted with the Great Void to draw in spiritual energy. Lu Jiangxian knew for a fact it was located in Jiangbei. But the Moonlight Origin Mansion’s Donghua Heaven was a mystery. It might have been completely severed from the Great Void, as he hadn’t been able to find a single trace of it.

'And then there’s another, more terrifying possibility… Based on Li Jiangqun’s memories… his past life was the master of the Moonlight Origin Mansion… So what if the so-called Donghua Heaven… is this very world within the Immortal Mirror!'

If that hypothesis held true, then the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination was likely in Wanling Heaven or some other secret realm hidden within Jiangbei.

He pondered this for a moment before his divine sense flew out of his realm, crossed the Great Void, and descended before the Immortal Dao Wall.

***

Chi Buzi sat with his head bowed and eyes tightly shut, seemingly oblivious to the faintly glowing formation before him. Dazzling light scattered down from the sea’s surface, draping the blue-robed man in its brilliance.

Lu Jiangxian’s gaze swept past him and settled on the vast ocean.

Although Chi Buzi had flown deep into the abyss, this was no longer the bottom of the Eastern Sea. Buried beneath layers of restrictive formations was an even greater immortal-grade formation. And this place was a secret realm, carved out by a powerful cultivator on top of that immortal array.

'Chi Buzi, like the cultivators of the Three Sects and Seven Gates, believes he has passed through the layered barriers and entered the immortal formation itself. He’s wrong… They were transported to a different place entirely… an independent space.'

'It's just that this secret realm happens to connect to the mortal world from within the immortal formation…'

That was why this place had no connection to the Great Void. It was why Li Jiangqun had dared to bring his friends here for open discussion, even boasting that no True Monarch could spy on them.

And this secret realm was unlike any other Lu Jiangxian had ever seen.

This secret realm dared to hang a sun in its sky.

Above the thin layer of seawater at the bottom was a terrifying expanse of Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance. And if one were to pass through that massive, thousand-zhang-tall field of profound light, they would reach the apex of the secret realm—a blazing Supreme Yang star, radiating with boundless light.

The stars in the heavens were not without meaning. In ancient texts, every star was linked to a Fruition Attainment, an Auxiliary Position, or an Intercalary Position. Even the Comet Star, which fell outside the domain of the ancient Time Rulers, was a signifier of Cultivation Transcendence. Although the world was now fractured and the celestial order in chaos, the stars would still respond when a True Monarch acted.

When True Monarch Taiyuan had made his move, the Taibai Star had stirred in the sky. To this day, famous correlations remained, such as Li Fire with the star Yinghuo, and Upright Wood with the star Suixing.

As for the Supreme Yang and Supreme Yin, everyone knew their significance. They hung nakedly in the sky. The Supreme Yang Fruition Attainment pointed to Yingze. Unless one was a True Monarch under that immortal’s command, no one would—or could—hang a sun in their own grotto-heaven. It would be no different from acting directly under that immortal’s watch.

Of the many grotto-heavens Lu Jiangxian knew of, this secret realm was the only one that dared to display a sun. This meant that even if the immortal formation wasn't Yingze’s own handiwork, it was undeniably a creation of the Supreme Yang Dao.

The thousand-zhang pillar of Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance further cemented his conclusion.

Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance was a Golden Core-level phenomenon, a burst of light released from the entanglement of a Supreme Yang Fruition Attainment and its Auxiliary Position. This radiance typically lasted only for an instant before fracturing into eighty-one types of spiritual light, each one a treasure on par with Lustful Merging Fire.

'Forget Chi Buzi. Even if Pristine Water himself were here, if that thousand-zhang torrent of Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance came down on him… Du Qing could just pack it in.'

'This was Li Jiangqun’s true confidence! This is why he dared claim that no True Monarch would dare to look, much less approach!'

The external immortal formations were formidable, but not enough to completely halt a True Monarch. Someone like Cultivation Transcendence could probably bypass them entirely. But the Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance was a true sword of Damocles hanging overhead.

'After all, no one knows the criteria for its judgment. Does it kill any and all intruders, or does it judge based on morality and merit? No Golden Core cultivator would risk their life to find out…'

'In that case, Li Jiangqun’s intention in inviting everyone here is obvious. He wasn't some defenseless fool… This was likely a show of force…'

Lu Jiangxian slowly withdrew his gaze, leaving the Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance untouched. He had his own Supreme Yin Profound Light and had no use for it. He followed a mountain path down to a stone table.

The table was covered in bronze wine vessels, some upright, some toppled, all long since empty. The neat arrangement of some hinted at their owners' personalities. He scanned the table until his divine sense landed on a white outer robe.

The robe was as white as snow, with faint, subtle silver Supreme Yin patterns along the edges. The design was remarkably simple, with a small, crescent-moon-shaped piece of jade at the collar that pulsed with a gentle light.

It was a dharma robe, and a peculiar one at that. Though it emitted not a single trace of spiritual energy, it exuded an almost imperceptible air of nobility.

With just a sweep of his divine sense, Lu Jiangxian knew it must have belonged to Li Jiangqun, who had left the treasure here.

'Li Jiangqun’s death… it’s too suspicious…'

Another item on the table was a jade pot that appeared utterly mundane. Yet Lu Jiangxian understood that this was the reason Chi Buzi dared not approach.

Though it looked plain, the pot was filled with a sea of sword intent, a roiling ocean of power ready to erupt at any moment and annihilate any cultivator who drew near.

This was undoubtedly Li Jiangqun’s sword intent.

As one of the most powerful cultivators in the Purple Mansion Realm, Li Jiangqun's bottled intent was more than enough to instill deep fear in Chi Buzi. For all his strength and his many spiritual artifacts, Chi Buzi was no match for the likes of Li Jiangqun or Duanmu Kui.

Lu Jiangxian observed it for a moment longer before departing. At that same instant, the light from the formation before Chi Buzi finally faded. The green-eyed man opened his eyes a beat later and let out a long sigh.

He lowered his gaze, and with a light wave of his sleeve, he erased the formation he had drawn on the sandy ground. Only then did he rise, bow deeply, and dissipate into a streak of azure light.

***

**East A-Wang Sea**

The East A-Wang Sea was a vast region dotted with numerous islands. The most famous was White Sand Island on its easternmost edge. The island was a local marvel, covered in dense jungles and boiling hot springs, a place where water and fire veins intertwined.

While such scenery was merely average on the mainland, here on the fringe of the outer seas, it was a prime location. It had once been the base of the Kui Ling Sect, the region’s former leader, but now it was bustling with people coming and going.

Past a mixture of old and new cultivation abodes, the grand hall at the island’s highest point finally projected an air of authority. A spiritual formation shimmered around it, and the doors to the cultivation chamber were sealed shut. Inside, a cultivator in white-gold Daoist robes was meditating with his eyes closed.

After an unknown amount of time, he finally let out a long breath. The Profound Light at the center of his brow flashed faintly, illuminating the entire hall.

'Taking that spirit pill really boosted my cultivation!'

Li Ximing had used two major medicinal ingredients—either of which would make numerous Purple Mansion Realm cultivators green with envy—to refine a batch of Supreme Yin Dao spirit pills. He had produced a total of three. Before entering seclusion, he consumed one to advance his cultivation.

The pill was refined from his own essence and used on himself, making its absorption incredibly fast and its effects profound. It had drastically shortened the time needed to cultivate his divine ability. After a period of focused cultivation, his *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was now nearly halfway to completion—an achievement he could call a minor success.

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's first divine ability was meant to be simpler, as it didn’t require building from the immortal foundation up. But Li Ximing's journey had been a series of stumbles, constantly either injured or on the run. This pill had not only made up for the lost time but had even pushed him further ahead.

'It would be best if I had some Bright Yang treasures… Alas, ancient spiritual artifacts are too precious. If Yuanxiu were willing to lend me the Huai River Map, my progress would be a thousand li a day…'

He mentally checked the contents of his storage bag. Although he was in peak condition, he had already used up his Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill. Without any Purple Mansion Realm healing pills on hand, he felt a constant sense of unease.

'I should take a trip out of seclusion anyway, refine some more pills. Besides, the island has been trembling occasionally these past few days. Something might be happening outside. I should check on it.'

Li Ximing stepped out of his cultivation chamber. The hall was silent and empty. A few cultivators stood guard outside, but even as Li Ximing walked right past them, they remained completely oblivious, standing perfectly still.

After Tinglan had left, Li Ximing had found this place suitable and entered seclusion on the spot. He had casually grabbed two or three local cultivators and ordered them to watch over the island, lest another group of demonic cultivators arrived to practice their blood-refining arts.

He had even warned them specifically not to cause trouble using his name. Now, seeing these unfamiliar faces, his expression cooled. With a single step, he vanished into the Great Void.

***

His form dissolved into light and quickly reformed on another high platform, where he saw a group of Qi Refining cultivators gathered, discussing something with grave expressions.

They were being respectful, at least. A fine jade table was set up spaciously, with cultivators of all kinds seated on either side. The grand seat at the head of the table was empty, clearly meant to represent Li Ximing.

Even in his absence, his name was worthy of being hung up as a signboard.

Ignoring the formation on the platform as if it weren't there, he strode in and materialized beside the imposing immortal seat, frowning as he took in the scene.

The sudden appearance of the white-gold figure threw the entire platform into silence. The cultivator at the head of the group stared in shock for a moment, then his face contorted in terror. He fell from his seat as if he’d seen a ghost and began kowtowing frantically.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

That cry broke the dam. The scrape of chairs, the splash of spilled wine, and the frantic shuffle of feet filled the air, soon replaced by the dull thud of foreheads hitting the floor. By the time Li Ximing turned around, he was met with the sight of cultivators prostrating themselves, trembling all over.

Li Ximing’s voice was soft. "Where are the others? I told them not to cause trouble in my name. Did they not understand?"

The white-haired cultivator at the front was shaking so hard he couldn’t stop kowtowing. "Daoist Master," he stammered respectfully, "it’s the cultivators of the East A-Wang Sea… they all heard a Daoist Master was in seclusion on White Sand Island… and they came here on their own to trade. Now… White Sand Island is the largest market in the entire East A-Wang Sea… No one has established a sect…"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. Glancing down, he saw that the buildings were indeed a mix of old and new. The unknown sect from long ago had left behind a massive formation, which the cultivators of the East A-Wang Sea were now using to eke out a living.

"The Kui Ling Sect was destroyed, and the few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the East A-Wang Sea are gone. The demon beasts are rampant… Everyone looks to White Sand Island for safety and has settled nearby…"

Li Ximing understood.

A Daoist Master like him was a figure people would kneel to even on the mainland, let alone in the barren and desolate outer seas. The East A-Wang Sea was already impoverished. When its cultivators heard of such a powerful figure, they stopped their squabbling and, united as one, flocked to him like ants, hoping to borrow a sliver of his protection.

'So this is the mess left behind by the fall of the Kui Ling Sect…'

Li Ximing frowned. Amidst the chaos, he heard an old man being carried up from below. Finally, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator had arrived. Unfortunately, everything below his abdomen had been bitten off. With a face ashen pale, he looked up and said in a broken voice, "Daoist Master… the demon beasts are out of control… We truly had no choice…"

Clearly, the old man knew that using Li Ximing’s name was a deadly gamble and that his seclusion would eventually end. He had been drinking poison to quench his thirst.

'…'

The crowd was silent, trembling in fear. Li Ximing could see at a glance that the man was afflicted with a cold poison and would not live long. He had likely consumed some blood qi just to survive this long. Li Ximing sighed internally, but his expression remained glacial. He glanced at the old man and said with a frown, "Stand and speak."

As the words fell, his Bright Yang divine ability flared. In an instant, the old man’s lower body grew back. The cold poison was incinerated, and the dark cloud hanging over his face dispersed. He covered his face and wept, collapsing to his knees once more.

Li Ximing asked, "Since you borrowed my authority, where did these demon beasts find their courage?"

The old man trembled. "They… they were wary at first, but later they made inquiries. They captured a few cultivators for questioning and even asked the nobles of other seas. After that, they stopped believing…"

The demon beasts knew little of the situation and certainly didn’t know it was Li Ximing cultivating here. Unless they asked the Dragon-kin, their inquiries would have been useless. Annoyed with the hassle, he turned and ordered, "Relay my command. Tell those demon generals to get over here and see me."

He had barely finished speaking when dark clouds swarmed the sky and the waves began to churn violently. A sharp, piercing roar split the air. Everyone looked up to see the sky turn grim and the sea roil into towering waves.

From the high platform, they could see an army of shrimp soldiers and crab generals standing on the waves, surrounding a sinister-looking youth in a dark green robe with long whiskers on his forehead.

"You, with the surname Wu!" the demon beast roared, his voice like thunder. His two whiskers stood proudly in the air as he stood upon the waves.

Just then, the Great Void suddenly ripped open, and a flash of golden light appeared.

*Smack!*

Before the demons could even see what happened, a palm had already struck the demon general’s face. The green-robed youth’s head spun around several times before snapping backwards, leaving the dark back of his head facing the island. His blood-streaked face stared blankly at his own troops, eyelids still twitching mechanically.

Only then did everyone see a man in a white-gold Daoist robe standing before him, his expression grim.

The Profound Light on the man’s brow flashed. With a single glance, the demon beasts on the waves tumbled into the sea like rain. He retracted his gaze, stepped back into the Great Void, and vanished.

*Thud!*

Li Ximing reappeared on the immortal seat on the high platform. He casually tossed the demon general to the ground like a piece of trash. The creature’s life force was tenacious, so it was still alive. It didn't dare turn its head back around, instead lying chest-down, its face pale and lips trembling.

The cultivators felt little joy, only a profound, unspoken terror.

'A late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm demon general… taken down with a single slap…'

Li Ximing had been disturbed several times during his cultivation. Although they were just tremors and he wasn't at a critical breakthrough point, disturbing a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was an offense for which this demon could die a hundred times over and it still wouldn't be enough.

Besides, all he had wanted was to cultivate in peace. Although revealing his presence wasn't as dangerous now, and others wouldn't necessarily know which Daoist Master was here, the fact that this demon had forced the cultivators of the East A-Wang Sea to rely on his name was, ultimately, an annoyance.

On the mainland, a Foundation Establishment Realm demon would only be a general. In a desolate place like this, he was probably considered a Demon King. This one cultivated a Pristine Water art and had the appearance of a shrimp-Flood Dragon. Forcing his patience, Li Ximing managed a smile and asked, "What's your background, to dare disturb my cultivation?"

Seeing that the demon could only beg for mercy and couldn't form a coherent sentence, Li Ximing knew what kind of creature he was dealing with. He kicked the demon in the chest, sealing its cultivation. His heart was cold.

'Practicing a Pristine Water art and a shrimp-Flood Dragon type, no less. You're truly unlucky to have run into me.'

He picked up the demon, preparing to go back and refine it into a pill, but noticed that everyone on the ground was still trembling. Li Ximing watched them in silence for a moment, which only made them tremble more.

The old man, his face now pale from fear instead of poison, approached again. He prostrated himself at Li Ximing's feet, shaking like a leaf in the wind. "Daoist… Daoist Master," he stammered, "thirty-six days ago, the… the Upper Sect from the West Curtain Sea to the west, the Panorama Immortal Gate, sent someone. They said they were here to… to pay their respects to you…"

Li Ximing was slightly surprised. "Their information network is quite impressive," he remarked.

The comment sent the old man into a fit of terrified kowtowing.

"Did they say why they were looking for me?" Li Ximing asked casually. "What is this Daoist tradition’s background?"

The old man shook his head repeatedly, bowed again, and finally said, "They only said… only said that someone had recommended them…"

At these words, Li Ximing’s expression became thoughtful. He released the demon in his hand and sat down on the immortal seat, his gaze on the Flood Dragon on the floor softening considerably.

'Someone recommended them… I wonder who. It's a clear signal that they already know my identity… but they're approaching with friendly intentions… wanting to meet me.'

'In that case, this foolish demon might not have been truly bold and reckless. It's possible the other party had some urgent matter and used a Life Divine Ability to stir the waves, hoping to draw me out of seclusion…'

Li Ximing mulled it over for a few seconds, looking at the creature on the ground, and shook his head internally.

"It must be that the outer seas demon beasts are just brainless. Otherwise, that would have been far too disrespectful."



# Chapter 848: The Calamity of the Exiled Qi

Li Ximing's gaze swept over the crowd of cultivators below, and a frown creased his brow. Too many of them knew he was in seclusion here. It was becoming a liability. Today's commotion could easily become tomorrow's interruption, forcing him out of his meditation. The situation was slipping from his grasp.

'It isn't a matter of mistrusting Xiukui or the people of Nine Mounds,' he mused. 'White Sand Island can remain a point of contact, but I can no longer cultivate here. It's time to find a new sanctuary.'

With that thought, any desire to remain on White Sand Island vanished. He glanced at the motley assembly of cultivators, his frown deepening. 'But if I just wave my sleeves and depart, this place will be plagued by disaster within a few years… Whether it's the immortal gates of the West Curtain Sea or other nearby powers, they might be hesitant for a time, but their probing is inevitable.'

If he remained, the situation would only escalate. It wouldn't just be the Dragon-kin. Even the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour from the neighbouring Peacock Sea would hear of a new Purple Mansion Realm power in the area and would surely send someone to investigate. Those monks were a cunning and troublesome lot; complications were certain to arise.

After a moment's pause, he finally spoke, his voice carrying over the crowd. "I was travelling the various seas when I chanced upon this island. I never intended for you all to gather here, but you did, and you received my protection. Now, I must depart from this sea. Our fated connection has run its course."

Hearing his words, the assembled cultivators breathed a collective sigh of relief, grateful they weren't being held accountable for the disturbance. But their relief quickly turned to fear at the news of his departure. Many began to weep as they prostrated themselves before him.

Li Ximing simply said, "The East A-Wang Sea is plagued by Demon beasts. Since I have come here, I cannot simply turn a blind eye to their misdeeds…"

If Li Ximing were a formation master, the ideal solution would be to upgrade White Sand Island's defensive arrays. Unfortunately, he knew nothing of formations. Gifting them potent pills would only sow discord and lead to infighting. Instead, he drew several jade slips from his sleeve.

These contained several cultivation methods and spell arts from the mainland, far superior to the common fare these cultivators relied on. He tossed the jade slips onto a nearby table and shook his head. "Such a hodgepodge of inferior techniques. It's no wonder you can't contend with a few mere Demon beasts. Circulate these among yourselves. For the next ten or twenty years, no Demon beast will dare to cause trouble here. It will be up to you to rely on your own cultivation to pass down a proper Daoist tradition."

"This Daoist Master will first make a trip to the West Curtain Sea," he declared. "When I return, I shall offer guidance to the few of you who have a chance of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm. After that, I will continue my travels across the seas."

The cultivators were both stunned and ecstatic. The old man at the front crawled forward a few steps, his voice thick with tears. "May we be so bold as to ask for the Old Master's esteemed name? The people of the East A-Wang Sea… will be forever in your debt…"

'My name?' Li Ximing scoffed internally. He had no intention of giving these people a powerful name to misuse, nor did he want any future troubles traced back to him. Could he really expect this ragtag group of rogue cultivators to produce a prodigy who could reach the late Foundation Establishment Realm, let alone the Purple Mansion Realm? It was a fantasy. Leaving his name would only forge a karmic tie and invite future trouble. He turned to depart, saying casually over his shoulder, "What need is there for a name? If you wish to repay me, refrain from using those blood qi arts. That would be thanks enough."

He vanished into the Great Void, leaving the crowd still prostrated, not daring to lift their heads. His final words sent a chill down the spines of more than ninety percent of the cultivators, and their eyes darted toward the man at the front, Daoist Wu.

The old Daoist, however, simply continued to kowtow, his body finally relaxing now that the crisis had passed. ‘Excellent… a crisis averted,’ he thought, a cunning light in his eyes. ‘The younger members of my Wu family are at the perfect age, and that young brat Han has already gone west for his training… In the end, my Wu family stands to gain the most…’

***

The spiritual qi was thin in the outer seas, which made traversing the Great Void exceptionally fast. In just half a day, Li Ximing had crossed several oceanic regions and arrived at the domain known as the West Curtain Sea.

The seabed here was unusually high, averaging less than a hundred zhang from the surface. In the shallower expanses, he saw numerous islanders wading through the water, digging at the reefs. They were a sturdy folk, clearly well-fed. Occasionally, one would slip and drown, their body bobbing to the surface, yet those nearby reacted not with deep sorrow, but with expressions of wistful regret or mild surprise.

To maintain such a standard of living under the rule of the Immortal Dao was no small feat. Judging by the people's demeanour, life under the Panorama Immortal Gate was not one of great suffering. This gave Li Ximing some reassurance. He continued west, and soon, a celestial mountain surrounded by several islands rose from the sea ahead.

He had no need to waste time announcing his presence; the cultivators on the island were already in a flurry of motion, gathering below him.

‘How astute…’ Li Ximing mused, his brow furrowed in thought. ‘This is no ordinary Daoist tradition, nor is it one established by some overseas rogue Daoist Master. Their reaction speed alone rivals that of the great Daoist traditions on the mainland…’

Just as he predicted, several streaks of light shot out from the celestial mountain, rapidly approaching his position. The lights resolved into two young men in elegant, flowing robes. They bowed in unison, their voices respectful. "The Zhao Clan of Jishan greets you, Daoist Master!"

"We do not know what brings your esteemed presence here… but do you have any instructions for us?"

Li Ximing was slightly puzzled, assuming they were a vassal family of the sect he was looking for. "Is the Panorama Immortal Gate located here?" he asked.

The two youths exchanged a look, a flicker of surprise in their eyes. One of them replied deferentially, "Daoist Master, if you seek the Panorama Immortal Gate, then you have found it in our Zhao Clan of Jishan."

Before Li Ximing could respond, a figure emerged from the Great Void. He was an old man dressed in a white feathered cloak over a short, turquoise robe. Though aged, he seemed far from the end of his years, unlike Li Ximing's current appearance. His cultivation was merely at the early stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, not even on par with Li Ximing's.

An elder who had achieved his breakthrough so late in life was naturally polite. He cupped his fist with a smile. "So it is Daoist Master Zhaojing! This humble one is Lin Yi of Jishan. Please, let us speak inside!"

Hearing the man speak his Daoist title, Li Ximing paused, then asked probingly, "Fellow Daoist… you are remarkably well-informed."

Daoist Master Lin Yi immediately chuckled. "It was a Daoist Master from Nine Mounds who gave me your title. I heard you were cultivating in the East A-Wang Sea and went to take a look. When I came across the situation on White Sand Island, I was almost certain it was you."

At the mention of Nine Mounds, Li Ximing's guard lowered a fraction. The reputation of Nine Mounds was far more reliable than that of Purple Smoke or Xiukui. He gave a slight nod. "A nearby place to sit will suffice."

The old Daoist Master understood. The two teleported through the Great Void, landing in a nearby pavilion. It was clear Lin Yi had a favour to ask; he was exceedingly courteous, ordering tea to be served. A serving girl approached with a crystalline tray, upon which sat two small, purple fruits.

"Zhaojing, please…" Lin Yi said with a smile.

Li Ximing, who had not formed a favourable impression of the man, gave a perfunctory nod. "Fellow Daoist, if there is something you need from me, let us speak of it plainly."

The Daoist Master's expression turned serious. "There's no need for Daoist titles. My family doesn't bother with such formalities. Besides, you and I share a common history. My surname is Yan, and my given name is Dushui. You can simply call me Dushui."

Seeing the sincerity in his expression, Li Ximing asked, "And what is this common history you speak of?"

Yan Dushui nodded. "You are a descendant of the ancient Wei, and I am a descendant of the ancient state of Yan. In ages past, our imperial families were joined by marriage. I can still imagine it… the grand procession of carriages leaving the Yan Mountains, stretching endlessly as it travelled south…"

This was unexpected. Li Ximing studied the man anew. "The ancient state of Yan…"

Unsure if he was believed, Yan Dushui looked up with a melancholic sigh. "Yan and Wei were steadfast allies. After Wei unified the north, my Yan state stood guard at the pass, holding back the sixteen barbarian tribes. But later, both our nations were shattered by the Jie barbarians and the Buddhist cultivators. My family fled with what remained of our Daoist tradition, wandering until we finally settled here. It has been hundreds of years since I have met a descendant of Wei… My family constantly reminisces about the past. We've even named these islands and mountain ranges after places in our lost homeland. A great many of our clan members have even changed their surname to Yan in remembrance."

Hearing all this, Li Ximing felt no stirrings of kinship. Instead, he inwardly shook his head. The first half of Yan Dushui's story might have been true, but the latter part rang false. The Wei state had been re-established, after all; descendants of the Wei-Li lineage surely scattered far and wide. It was impossible that he hadn't encountered a single one in all these years. The descendants of Yan were clearly not as close to his line as the Cui clan, and it was likely they resented submitting to Wei's rule back then. Now, with Li Ximing having reached the Purple Mansion Realm and appeared on his doorstep, Yan Dushui had conveniently learned of his identity from Nine Mounds and was rushing to establish a connection. There was little genuine sentiment to be found here.

He merely cupped his fist and said politely, "It is often said that my family are remnants of the Wei-Li, but in truth, we are ignorant of our own ancestry. It was only when my kinsman, Minghuang, achieved his Dao that these speculations began to circulate."

"I understand!" Yan Dushui nodded sagely. "My family is not ostentatious about our past either. When our kingdom was destroyed, we fled with a host of other immortal sects. By the time we reached this place, nearly all who remained were of the royal bloodline. We've borrowed the names of those sects to get by, presenting ourselves to the outside world as the Panorama Immortal Gate…"

The name of Yan clearly carried less weight than that of Wei, which involved far greater karma. It was obvious they had been living cautiously all these years. Seeing Li Ximing fall silent, the old man quickly pressed on. "The reason I have invited you today, an old kinsman, is because I am truly in need of your help."

His expression grew solemn. "My family discovered a certain treasure many years ago. We have been waiting ever since, as we require the aid of a Bright Yang Life Divine Ability to retrieve it. We had previously approached Daoist Master Yangya of the Cui Clan in the Western Sea… but his stance was firm. He said he would no longer meddle in the affairs of the Eastern Sea or the mainland, as he wishes to sever the karmic debts of his ancestors. Since our matter is related to his ancestry, he refused to act."

Li Ximing had heard of this Daoist Master Yangya. He was a member of the Cui clan, but from a branch that had relocated to the Western Sea and had little contact with the main lineage. He hadn't realized the division was so absolute. After a moment's hesitation, he asked, "What is this treasure?"

Yan Dushui's voice dropped to a near whisper. "A wisp of Exiled Qi."

Li Ximing was perplexed. "What sort of treasure is that?"

Yan Dushui paused, then sidestepped the question with a smile. "You would only need to lend a minor assistance, Fellow Daoist. Afterwards, we ask only that you keep this matter confidential. My Jishan clan will reward you handsomely!" He smiled again, adding, "The item grows upon a piece of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. Once our task is complete, I will take the treasure itself, but the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood it inhabits can be yours. We are open to negotiating any other requests as well."

Although Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood was only a Foundation Establishment-level spiritual material, its extreme rarity made it exceptionally precious. It was typically only found within grotto-heavens and mystic realms, with small quantities occasionally appearing in the Southern Borderlands. Its primary use was in crafting soul lamps of the highest quality, which were highly resistant to the divinatory effects of a Purple Mansion cultivator's divine abilities that could otherwise reveal a person's life or death status. This was the very material used for the soul lamps of the three great sects.

Li Ximing recalled that Minghui of the Lotus Temple had once asked him to search for this very material. If he had some to spare, he wondered if the monk would still be interested. However, his general distrust of monks made him cautious. For now, he simply stroked his beard, remaining silent.

After a few moments of silence, Li Ximing spoke deliberately. "I must insist that you explain more clearly, Fellow Daoist. If I am to act without even knowing the nature of this treasure, how can I be sure I won't be entangled in some unforeseen trouble? How could I possibly agree under such circumstances?"

Whatever the people of Nine Mounds had told Yan Dushui, it seemed to have earned his trust. The old man hesitated for a moment before nodding. "Very well," he said in a low voice. "I shall hold nothing back."

"The twelve primordial Qis arose from the 'Clear Qi.' Under the primordial Profound Wind, all other forms of qi were born. Yet, there was one whose Fruition Attainment was entangled at the very moment of its creation, causing it to plummet into the boundless Underworld, where it became a hazy and imperceptible Dao. This is a matter of extreme antiquity. With this Qi bound and its Fruition Attainment lost to the Underworld, its presence in the mortal realm grew increasingly scarce. Only a few practitioners of the ancient Immortal Dao still cultivated it. But as the Qi merged further with the Underworld, it began to nourish that realm in turn. Its presence in the mortal world diminished until its Daoist tradition was completely severed.

"In primordial times, this Qi had a proper name. But as it vanished, the event came to be known as the Calamity of the Yin Exile. Its true name was buried in the scrolls of history. By the time of later antiquity, it was simply called the Qi of the Exiled, and to this day, even those who know of its existence can only refer to it as the Exiled Qi."

His eagerness for Li Ximing's help was palpable as he continued to elaborate, his expression wistful. "The Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood and the Nine-Refined Spirit of today… they are both products of this Qi. One might say they belong to the Immortal Dao, but to be precise, only the faintest traces of its original nature remain… Furthermore, the very principle that allows shattered jade talismans and tokens to serve as warnings can be traced back to the Fruition Attainment of this Exiled Qi… The Calamity of the Yin Exile also provided a shortcut for a certain Revered One to seize another Fruition Attainment, and it touches upon the secrets of several great Daoist traditions. Alas! The entanglements are complex, and the closer they are to the present, the less I can speak of them. Please forgive my reticence…"

Yan Dushui fell silent. Li Ximing then asked quietly, "If that is the case, then Fellow Daoist must possess great fortune to have access to something from the Underworld."

Yan Dushui shook his head with a heavy sigh. "The matter is not so simple. When my ancestors fled to this place, after generations of hardship, they had the good fortune to form a connection with a personage from the Underworld. This treasure was something he left behind when he departed. Unfortunately, my family lacks the means to move it… It was not until I achieved the Purple Mansion Realm that there was hope. I made several pilgrimages to Nine Mounds, respectfully begging for guidance, and was finally granted a method of retrieval. However, it requires either the Bright Yang Life Divine Ability known as World's Radiance, the ancient divine ability Imperial Response, or the aid of the Sheji Daoist tradition. A mere manifestation of the ability is all that is needed."

Li Ximing remained outwardly calm, his initial suspicion abating. ‘If this were a trap,’ he considered, ‘the bait is hardly irresistible. Moreover, it requires World’s Radiance, a divine ability that is still a distant goal for me…’ From this angle, it truly seemed to be a matter of a simple favour.

Still, he smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist, you think too highly of me. World’s Radiance is a profound Life Divine Ability. Not only have I yet to cultivate it, I do not even possess the manual. How could I possibly be of assistance?"

Yan Dushui shook his head, a carefree smile spreading across his face. "The Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven has manifested in the world. Manuals for Bright Yang techniques should be readily available. With a talent like yours, having mastered a divine ability at such a young age, how could World’s Radiance be a distant goal? It matters not. This old man has another century of lifespan remaining. I should live to see that day. If not… then we can discuss alternatives."

Li Ximing instantly understood the source of his confidence. In the old man’s view, it was a certainty that Li Ximing would use the Art of Rebirth; possessing the Foundation Establishment Realm manual was all that was needed. Faced with the three divine abilities of the Purple Mystery Immortal Threshold, it was inconceivable that he would not cultivate the corresponding Life Divine Ability. Therefore, mastering World’s Radiance was merely a matter of time.

After a moment of contemplation, Li Ximing replied, "Since you have already waited for so many years, there is no rush. I have a few pills I have yet to finish refining. How about I first make a trip to Nine Mounds and return to find you afterwards?"

Yan Dushui was not surprised by the request. He smiled and nodded. "That is perfectly fine. I will wait here for your return. As for Nine Mounds… there is no need for you to make such a long journey. Senior Lingdu is nearby. Fly a short distance west, and you will be able to meet him yourself."

"Oh?" A flicker of interest sparked within Li Ximing, and his smile broadened. "Haha… Since the Senior himself is here, it would be terribly impolite of me to run off to refine pills."

The moment Yan Dushui finished speaking, a new suspicion bloomed in Li Ximing’s mind. ‘I’m beginning to think it isn’t Yan Dushui who wants this Exiled Qi,’ he mused. ‘More likely, it’s Nine Mounds… for Senior Lingdu to be here right now is far too convenient.’

Yan Dushui chuckled. "There is a remarkable hidden treasury in the West Curtain Sea. Nine Mounds sends disciples to this region for training every year. This year, the Senior himself is leading the group, and they have arrived at the opportune moment."

Li Ximing smiled and nodded, then took to the air, following the directions. He sighed internally. ‘So, is this the West Curtain Sea of Jishan, or the West Curtain Sea of Nine Mounds? Forcing them to have outsiders come and claim treasures from their own territory… what a grievance.’

It was obvious that while the Jishan clan was not as destitute as the Cui family, they had survived by submitting to a greater power. They had likely been a vassal of Nine Mounds for many years. If not for Yan Dushui successfully breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, their circumstances would surely be far more dire.

‘So the reach of the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition extends this far,’ he reflected. ‘Then again, Daoist Master Yuandao’s lifespan seems practically limitless. Against such a being, what real waves could Yan Dushui or any other vassal ever hope to make?’

He flew onward in silence, and soon, a pillar of light that pierced the heavens came into view. Standing on a flying vessel at its base was an old man with a gentle smile. When he saw Li Ximing, he raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Zhaojing? Fancy meeting you here, Fellow Daoist."

"Greetings, Senior!" Li Ximing called out respectfully.

Li Ximing actually had a rather good impression of this senior, Lingdu. Seeing him now, he temporarily pushed aside his suspicions, bowed properly, and explained, "This junior was entrusted by the Jishan clan with a task to retrieve a certain Qi. They mentioned that the information came from you, Senior, so I dared not act rashly and came to inquire directly."

Lingdu's expression showed immediate understanding. He beckoned Li Ximing aboard the vessel and shook his head. "He pleaded with me about this matter for a very long time. I considered that it would be of great benefit to you as well, so I revealed a tiny bit. I merely mentioned that you cultivate the Bright Yang path. I never imagined the fellow would be so sharp as to piece it all together and find you so quickly."

Li Ximing nodded slightly. Lingdu sighed. "You have met him, then. I imagine he told you quite a sob story. He may seem overly eager, but if he cannot retrieve this item, his descendants will likely have no future to speak of." He glanced at Li Ximing, seemingly understanding his hesitation, and added with a smile, "You must understand, if that item falls into his hands, he truly has no way to deal with it, nor can he publicize its existence. It must ultimately be delivered to my Nine Mounds. But from our perspective, the item isn't going anywhere. It makes no difference whether he retrieves it for us now, or if we retrieve it ourselves in the future."

With those words, everything clicked into place for Li Ximing. Nine Mounds had not known about this treasure before. Yan Dushui's desperate plea had inadvertently revealed its existence. While the item was precious, its acquisition was not an urgent matter for a powerhouse like Nine Mounds. Yan Dushui was old; if he retrieved it, he would dutifully hand it over. If he failed, then after his death, Nine Mounds could simply take it themselves. But for Yan Dushui, the difference between offering it as a tribute and having it seized from his clan after his demise was the difference between survival and extinction.

Li Ximing stroked his beard, nodding slowly as the last of his doubts dissolved.

Lingdu let out another sigh. "We have had dealings for many years, after all. I couldn't bear to see him end up in such a predicament. Putting aside my position in the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition, on a personal level, I truly hoped he could find a path forward. That is why I let slip a hint. I hope you can forgive me for the imposition, Zhaojing."

"This junior understands," Li Ximing replied, his mind clear.

With Lingdu being so transparent, it was clear that he placed a high value on Li Ximing. And by receiving this information, Li Ximing now had a direct understanding of their bottom line. It meant he could ask this powerful Purple Mansion cultivator for assistance, provided his requests were not outrageous.

If Daoist Master Yuandao's previous aid could be seen as a display of Nine Mounds' magnanimity, then Lingdu's deliberate assistance felt far more personal. The Nine Mounds Daoist tradition never spoke of offering aid and disliked deep entanglements, yet their bias toward their own allies was ever-present, sometimes overt, sometimes subtle. This realization filled Li Ximing with a mixture of joy and apprehension.

After all, help from a premier Daoist tradition rarely came without strings attached. Even so, every interaction thus far had been marked by goodwill. He nodded silently and bowed once more to the Daoist Master from Nine Mounds, his voice filled with sincerity.

"Many thanks, Senior!"



### Chapter 852: Unyielding Pride

The windswept expanse of Baiku Prefecture.

A haze of yellow sand and dust swept across the city, rising into the sky on a fierce gale. The air, thick with a corrosive Metal Taint, forced passing cultivators to narrow their eyes and squint.

Through the swirling grit, a white-robed old cultivator rode the wind, a frown creasing his brow as he had to close his eyes against the onslaught. He looked down upon the city below.

'This is strange,' he thought. 'This place is near the Capital immortals Dao, a force of the Purple Mansion Realm, yet they allow the Metal Taint to rage like this? Who knows how many thousands of common folk have died... Truly a failure of governance.'

With a trace of pity, he descended, muttering to himself:

'Then again, it's no wonder. I heard they are facing off against the Moongaze Immortal Clan across the river. The two sides have reached a point of fire, and they no longer care about a little Metal Taint... Hmm... The Li Clan is a renowned righteous power, they wouldn't do something like this. So it must be the Capital immortals Dao deliberately stirring up trouble to force the Li Clan to divert their attention to a rescue...'

'What a tragedy!'

He sighed deeply, hesitating for a moment before finally shaking his head.

'I should go down and take a look... When I followed the General to repel the Buddhist cultivators, we never let the local people suffer so grievously. Now the Immortal Dao flourishes, yet such calamities still exist...'

The old Daoist passed through the clouds, and sure enough, he saw scattered corpses on the streets. Not a soul paid them any mind, as if they couldn't see these mortals. Instead, everyone was flocking toward a teahouse in the city's center.

He halted his Dharma Art and landed on a roof, where he saw a Qi Refining cultivator locked in a fierce duel with an Embryonic Breathing cultivator.

"Ah?"

He stared in disbelief. The Embryonic Breathing cultivator, wielding a Dharma Art sword, was parrying and destroying every incoming attack. Though he appeared to be struggling, he was not only holding his own against the Qi Refining cultivator, but doing so with a surprising, fluid grace.

"Oh!"

The old Daoist took two steps forward, stroking his beard as he watched.

The youth had a few streaks of blood on his face. He stood on the stage, a picture of dignity, his unyielding pride like a sharp sword piercing the heavens. The long sword in his hand danced with increasing ferocity, a sight worthy of high praise.

In stark contrast, the robed young master facing him had a face like thunder and trembling hands, barely able to form his techniques. His eyes were wide and reddened as he roared:

"You... you... what kind of Demon art did you use! How can you stand against my Qi Refining Dharma Art!"

The young man across from him was only at the peak of Embryonic Breathing, yet his demeanor was extraordinary. Despite his torn robes, his expression was tenacious and unyielding as he replied with haughty defiance:

"A frog in a well! Have you never heard that man's will can conquer heaven? I possess a valiant spirit, an unyielding pride, and an ambition that soars to the clouds. With these three alone, even if I were a mere mortal, the greatest divine ability could not harm me in the slightest, let alone a petty Qi Refining cultivator like you!"

"You couldn't do anything to me at the peak of Embryonic Breathing, and now that you've become a Qi Refining cultivator, you're still a worthless wretch!"

"Witness my blade!"

As his words fell, streamers of white energy surged from his sword, not only shredding the incoming Dharma Art but also flying forward to slash the robed young man.

A spray of blood erupted, and the young man fell to the ground with a pale face, writhing in pain. He spat out venomously:

"Why! I've been cultivating for ten years without a single day of rest... Losing to you once was bad enough, but I even paid a countless price to get that one spiritual resource, and barely managed to break through to Qi Refining in three months. Why did I lose to your three months of cultivation!"

The swordsman stepped slowly forward, his blade aimed at the other's throat. His voice was cold and mocking.

"How laughable. You ask me why? Why not ask... why those cultivators with less talent still fall behind you after ten years? Why those cultivators with less family support still fall behind you? Only useless scions like you, who have never tasted the world, would plead for fairness... Tomorrow, a beggar on the street might stumble upon a treasure and with the flick of a finger, turn your ten years of effort to ash! Will you ask 'why' then?"

The scion was struck speechless, dragging his body two inches on the ground, leaving a trail of blood. The people around them stood still as statues, rooted to the spot. The swordsman stepped forward, placing his foot on the scion's face. He let out a light laugh.

"If the world's cultivation depended on effort, the donkey that pulls the millstone would be the top Immortal in the world. I have the ambition to touch the clouds, and six months of cultivation is enough for me to kill you. All you can do is accept it, for you have no other choice."

"You people simply pretend you don't see what you can't change. You should be complaining about spiritual aptitude and fortune, as those are the things that are truly unfair! How many people have you crushed with your family's influence? And now, it's your turn to complain about your own family and fortune, and you feel jealous and resentful..."

The scion's eyes were about to burst from their sockets. He groaned, "I didn't..."

But before he could finish, his expression shifted. The looks of pity from the surrounding crowd turned to disgust, and a look of shame appeared on his own face. The youth kicked him hard in the chest.

*CRACK!*

An unknown number of bones broke, leaving the scion unable to move. The youth slowly lowered his head, staring at him. The defiant look suddenly vanished from his face, replaced by a strange, knowing smile.

"The present world doesn't change according to your wishes, understand? Nothing is unfair. My standing here is the greatest fairness."

The scion didn't understand what he was saying. When he saw the youth raise his sword, his face twisted in terror, and he quickly began to beg for mercy. A look of utter disdain appeared on the young man's face. He sneered:

"Wang Jie! You lose the fight and then kneel to beg for a pathetic life. You have no unyielding pride, no heart for the Immortal Dao, and no soaring ambition. You only possess the demeanor of a groveling rat, wagging your tail for a bit of pity! I spared your life once, but you have still not learned. You deserve death!"

The scion screamed in utter despair, but then a powerful roar came from the sky above.

"How dare you! Harm my son and die!"

A figure appeared in the heavens, a colossal hand descending from the sky with a crushing pressure! The crowd below gasped in unison.

"It's Baiku City Lord, Wang Bakong!"

"Lin Feng is in trouble now!"

Lin Feng stood his ground, completely unafraid. On the other side, an old Daoist appeared, gently catching the man's Dharma Art. The corpses on the ground were swept away, and black blood splattered everywhere.

"This one is Bai Yinzi! I rarely see a genius like this, so I ask that you hold your hand, fellow Daoist!"

Wang Bakong's normally dignified face was twisted with rage. He bellowed, "What kind of rogue cultivator are you! How dare you interfere with my affairs!"

Bai Yinzi had only become a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator by a stroke of luck, and his strength was no match for the other man. But seeing such an unpolished gem, he was unwilling to let go. His scalp tingled, and he quickly scooped up the young man below, riding the wind to escape. He called out, "Your esteemed son is safe, so a simple apology will suffice! Why the need for such a great battle, City Lord!"

The youth stood silently behind him. He cupped his fists and thanked him.

"Thank you, Senior, for your righteous intervention. Lin Feng thanks you!"

"Hey."

Bai Yinzi shook his head, keeping an eye on their pursuer. "It was nothing more than a passing fancy! Let's find a place to land in Jiangbei so we can have a proper talk!"

He had completely forgotten about the Metal Taint problem. Behind them, Wang Bakong's eyes were wide with fury, and he was about to give chase when he heard his son groaning on the ground. The young man, relieved of the pressure, fainted. Wang Bakong had no choice but to stop, his eyes red with heartache. He cried out, "What a malicious trick that little beast used!"

Tears welled in his eyes as he helped his son up. He gritted his teeth and said, "Wang He wouldn't see me... he made me wait at the foot of the mountain for months... which allowed this person to take advantage and cause you such great harm..."

He held his eldest son with a grim expression, a vicious thought in his heart.

'So be it! So be it! I thought that since this place is near the Capital immortals Dao and my line is close with Wang He, we should stay close to the Capital immortals Dao... But I never imagined this man would be so heartless!'

Wang Bakong's gaze swept over the crowd. The people below immediately scattered, muttering among themselves. The two guards on either side of the stage stepped forward, only to be harshly slapped by the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. They fell off the stage, spitting up blood.

'Useless fools!'

He called for someone else, his expression dark. He lowered his voice. "Is that Wang Quwan... also cultivating in the Jiangbei area now?"

A nearby cultivator nodded quickly, whispering, "I heard he's cultivating in this area... I don't know why he hasn't returned to his own clan's mountain... but I've heard that he's refused to see anyone who goes to see him..."

"Got it."

Wang Bakong turned around, holding his son. The unconscious Wang Jie was covered in cold sweat and suddenly stirred, muttering in a trembling voice about unyielding pride and soaring ambition.

*

Moongaze Lake.

Early autumn had arrived again, and the leaves on the trees by the lake were turning red and yellow. The old man rode the wind, speeding toward the main hall. He landed outside and, without stepping over the threshold, bowed from a distance. He could see two figures standing within the hall.

The person at the head of the hall wore crimson robes and was holding a writing brush, lost in thought. The other, wearing a court dress, was dignified and held a small cyan-colored orb in her hand.

Seeing Qu Bushi bow, the man at the head of the hall raised his eyebrows, then spoke to Li Minggong:

"Great-aunt's words make sense. Since Zhuang Pingye is returning to the Great Desert, it's only right to give him a reminder. Tell him to pass on a message to Zhuang Cheng... to tell them not to go to Jiangbei."

He mused, "Tell them that our family's war with the Capital immortals Dao is dangerous and involves Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. It would be best if the Zhuang family didn't come East to avoid any accidents... Zhuang Cheng is a famous person in the Great Desert, so he should listen to the warning... As for how effective it will be..."

Li Jiangqian let out a slight sigh and replied, "That depends on the intentions of those above. If they already intend to get involved, they won't be able to escape no matter how much they try to hide."

Li Minggong nodded slightly. Li Jiangqian then said, "Report."

Only then did Qu Bushi enter the hall to bow. He said respectfully, "My Lord, Wang Jie has been defeated for the second time... I heard this time he almost lost his life. It was only because his father returned in time that he was saved. He intended to seek revenge, but Lord Lin... Lord Lin was rescued... by an old Foundation Establishment Realm Daoist."

Qu Bushi was not foolish. He had been involved in the affairs of the North and was in contact with the Capital immortals Dao. Although he didn't know the full truth, he had already guessed that Lin Feng's identity was extraordinary. When he said "Lord Lin," Li Jiangqian paused for a moment. He didn't correct him, nor did he ask about the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's identity. Instead, he asked with a serious expression:

"Was it done according to my instructions?"

"Your subordinate followed the command precisely! All the information was gathered from casual chats in taverns. It's strange, but perhaps because the story is so entertaining, it's spreading at a startling speed... as if everyone enjoys talking about it..."

Li Jiangqian nodded silently. Qu Bushi continued, "On another matter... the message has already been passed to Lord Gong. He was very grateful and asked me to tell you... that he received news that the Protector Black Rat has figured out the source of the mineral veins and suspects Lord Lin. He has personally gone to Baiku Prefecture and should be meeting with Wang Bakong."

Li Jiangqian waved his hand, dismissing the man. He then looked at Li Minggong and said softly, "The North Shore has always been under the care of Chen Yang. I hear that Fei Qingya's cultivation speed is astonishing. She was only at the fifth layer when she arrived, but she has already broken through to the sixth layer of Embryonic Breathing. She's more talented than most of our direct descendants."

"Daoist Master Tinglan didn't give any instructions on what kind of spiritual resource to give her... and Daoist Master Qiuhu hasn't sent any directions either... so we'll have to decide for ourselves on how to let her consolidate her cultivation."

Li Minggong pondered for a moment before replying, "What's your idea?"

Li Jiangqian smiled faintly. "The River-Center Clear Qi."

How could they miss such a perfect opportunity when the Li family's Great River and Grand Mound Scripture has yet to be unsealed? As long as Fei Qingya takes the River-Center Clear Qi, she will eventually need the subsequent cultivation methods. If she emerges from seclusion within three years, even a slight hint could make it very likely that Lin Feng would solve the problem for her!

A task that a group of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators couldn't accomplish might not be so difficult for a True Monarch!

Li Minggong's eyes lit up, and she nodded repeatedly. Li Jiangqian leaned back in his chair and laughed.

"Protector Chen takes great care of her. He's worried she won't have a good cultivation method, so he will not only give her a portion of the River-Center Clear Qi but also find a suitable matching cultivation method for her..."

"He said... since their cultivation methods are similar, it would be easier for him to offer guidance."

Li Minggong looked at him, shaking her head with a helpless smile. "What can you say? Our Protector Chen is just so warm-hearted."

Li Jiangqian chuckled. "But Protector Chen also laments that the clan's inherited cultivation method is sealed by a secret art, and the method to open it has been lost. It's a great pity that it would take a genius to unlock it!"

With the matter settled, Li Jiangqian put down his brush. He said, "By the way, Protector Chen's family has raised good children. They are now adults and their talent is quite high. They have already reached the Qi Refining stage. The one who came to the clan to report his breakthrough is his second son, Chen Jinxi. He also has a nephew named Chen Jinbao, and both are very promising. According to the Old Master, they're no worse than the An Xuanxin brothers."

Li Minggong was hearing this for the first time. Se looked up in slight surprise and nodded. "The Chen family is very low-key... I only knew that those people existed, but I never knew they could be compared to the two An brothers... What great talent!"

Li Jiangqian nodded silently, stroking the jade cup. "Jiangliang has also entered the Qi Refining stage. It's a good time to assign him a subordinate. The members of the Chen Clan are known to be capable and efficient officials, and you rarely see a useless one among them, so it's a suitable match."

Li Minggong smiled and nodded, feeling a sense of relief.

'How lucky that Zhouwei has so many children. If he had one less, with only Xinghan, Zhoufang, and at most Jiangzong and Zhouda, we wouldn't be able to keep so many geniuses in check...'

Li Jiangqian didn't seem to be thinking about anything in particular. He said casually, "Fei Qing'yi is still quite obedient. He doesn't dare return to the North Shore anymore, and spends his days diligently working in the island. It's as if he wants to make up for his mistakes. He's a bit clumsy, but his attitude is very proactive."

Li Minggong sighed. "How can he not be proactive? The entire Fei family is watching him, terrified that you won't be satisfied."

Li Jiangqian scoffed. "The matter doesn't concern me. The Fei family has good fortune. Whether they are good or bad, Fei Qingyi, Fei Qing'yi, and Fei Qingya, at least these three have managed to continue the family's legacy!"

# Chapter 853: Turmoil

As Li Jiangqian finished speaking, the woman beside him nodded. "Just consider it carefully," she said softly. "I just returned from seeing the Old Master. He also asked about it, and his thinking is... now is not a good time."

Since Li Minggong had put it that way, Li Jiangqian naturally agreed, making a mental note of the matter. He placed two letters on the desk. "There's one more thing," he said quietly. "The situation with Daoist Shouding has been resolved."

When Daoist Shouding had left the Li Clan, he had originally intended to go to the Chen Clan. But Li Jiangqian had intercepted him, sending letters to both the Chen Clan and Mount Jingyi. The replies had now arrived.

"One is from the Yuyang Chen Clan. It's mostly just thanks for our warning. The messenger they sent contacted Shouding and told him that the Chen Clan is also in turmoil. If he were to visit, he should first go to one of their strongholds in the Southern Borderlands."

Li Jiangqian shook his head with a hint of resignation. "Although Daoist Shouding was full of doubt, he could read between the lines and see it was a polite refusal, so he didn't go. The other letter is from Mount Jingyi. They arranged for him to travel through the Southern Borderlands. He had no choice but to head south in frustration."

Li Minggong let out a soft sigh, but Li Jiangqian added with some surprise, "Mount Jingyi is strange, though. The letter was very polite to our clan, but they gave Shouding a thorough dressing-down. It seems they are a Daoist tradition with quite a bit of character."

He joked as he saw Li Minggong out, his mind still turning over their earlier conversation.

The Fei Clan held a degree of autonomy on the North Bank, a situation the Li Clan hadn't touched for many years. There had been no shortage of dissenting voices within the clan. Regardless of the discussions in the main hall, the two major families, the Chen Clan and the An Clan, held firm in their stance: the Fei Clan's autonomy must be curtailed, if not outright absorbed.

'Chen Yang is smart,' Li Jiangqian thought. 'On a sensitive issue like this, the Chen Clan really has no other choice…'

'As for the An Clan…'

The old patriarch of the An Clan, An Zheyan, was still alive. He had once paid respects to Li Tongya, giving him a status comparable to Chen Donghe of the Chen Clan. But the true leader was his son, An Siwei.

This Guest Elder An had once been one of the Li Clan's few protectors at the Foundation Establishment Realm and was heavily relied upon. But as soon as the Li Clan produced a cultivator at the Purple Mansion Realm, his shallow immortal foundation became inadequate. Later, he was captured by enemies. By the time he returned, his position had been usurped by the younger generation. He had kept a low profile ever since, but on this matter, he had spoken out several times, to the point of causing the Fei Clan considerable embarrassment.

As for the other branches, most remained silent. Of the four elders from the Zhou generation—Zhoufang and Zhou Yang—they were too busy securing benefits for their descendants to care about such matters, essentially rubber-stamping whatever the clan decided. Xinghan and Zhouming were even less involved, their voices barely heard.

The sole remaining descendant of the Chengming generation, Li Chenghao, was a stern and eccentric man whose thoughts were usually hard to guess. And while Li Minggong and Li Xuanxuan had never given a definitive statement, their current attitude suggested it was not the time to move against the Fei Clan.

'Fei Qingya… So long as Fei Qingya makes no move, any plans the Fei Clan has are just empty talk… But she will cultivate the River-Center Clear Qi, which makes things difficult with Fei Qing'yi. I’ll have to find some excuse to dismiss him… Strange. Why haven't the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators made any arrangements for her?'

Lost in thought, he heard a light rap on the door, followed by the sound of hurried footsteps. Two figures rushed to the front of the hall. One was stout and honest-looking; he immediately dropped to his knees to kowtow. The other was so agitated he bypassed the courtesy entirely, striding inside with an imposing aura, his face a grim, ashen mask.

"Greetings, Clan Head!"

A flicker of understanding crossed Li Jiangqian's mind. One of the men was Li Wen, a veteran steward of several generations who managed their headquarters at Jade Court. The other was Li Chenghao, the last of the Chengming generation, a Qi Refining cultivator in charge of Qingdu. Li Jiangqian immediately descended from his seat. "What's wrong?"

Li Chenghao's face was pale, his lips bloodless. "Reporting to the Clan Head," he said in a low voice, "Zhouyang's life jade has shattered."

"Second Uncle?!"

Li Chenghao had lost nearly all his own children to clan affairs, and his daughter, Li Xingsai, had also died at the hands of demonic cultivators. He had raised his two nephews, Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang of the Zhou generation, as his own sons.

The two brothers were influential figures within the clan, known for always looking out for their younger relatives. Their high prestige and tendency to favour their kin had made them a thorn in the side of the clan's managers. For that reason, Li Jiangqian had reassigned them to the Eastern shore and brought Li Chenghao back to manage Qingdu. He never expected something like this to happen.

"How could this be!"

Although this elder's talent wasn't top-tier, he was a core member of the direct line and a senior figure of the Zhou generation. His status was significant. A jolt of anger shot through Li Jiangqian. "What about… what about First Uncle? The two elders were on the Eastern shore together… Has there been any word?!"

Li Chenghao shook his head, his stoic face contorted with pain. "No news," he bit out, "but thankfully, his life jade is intact. He's safe."

Li Jiangqian let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding.

Although First Uncle Li Zhoufang and Second Uncle Li Zhouyang had always acted in unison and were close in status and cultivation, their standing in Li Jiangqian's mind was vastly different.

It came down to one simple fact: Li Zhoufang was the father of Li Queyi, who was training with the Purple Smoke Gate, and Li Jiangzong, a rising star within the clan. Li Zhouyang was merely their uncle.

It was a cruel calculation, but a flicker of relief crossed Li Jiangqian's mind, quickly replaced by confusion and rage. He looked at Li Wen, who was still kneeling before the hall. Just then, another set of footsteps approached. Chen Yang, clad in black armour, strode in, knelt on one knee, and presented a letter with both hands.

Li Minggong and Li Xuanxuan entered with him. Li Minggong's expression was merely grim, but Li Xuanxuan looked both pained and furious. Neither of them disturbed Li Jiangqian, standing silently to the side.

Li Jiangqian gave a slight bow, took the letter with a heavy expression, and read it through before passing it to Li Xuanxuan.

As the old man read, Li Jiangqian's voice turned cold. "Today, our clan was engaged in a Dharma Art battle with the Capital immortals Dao in the northern wilderness. A group of Foundation Establishment Realm demonic cultivators secretly entered the area, raided the Eastern shore, broke through two great formations, and killed many of our people. Although Protector Cui arrived in time… it was already too late."

Reading this, Li Jiangqian already understood. The Li Clan's battle with the Capital immortals Dao on the river was at a predictable time and place. A sneak attack would have been easily trapped. This meant they had been set up by someone else.

"First Uncle and Second Uncle were on the Eastern shore today, and they were supposed to be with Protector An. The duties were divided, and today was supposed to be First Uncle's shift. But he had Second Uncle take his place. That one switch saved his life."

Li Chenghao, his heart burning with rage, finished reading and passed the letter to Li Wen beside him. He prostrated himself on the floor, his voice sharp. "The wilderness are teeming with our clan's eyes and ears! For a group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to appear out of nowhere and infiltrate the Eastern shore, they must have had the aid of a concealment-type Dharma artifact! This was no ordinary raid! Someone deliberately plotted against us… I implore the Clan Head to investigate thoroughly!"

Li Jiangqian already knew this. The ones who harmed his clan were no mere demonic cultivators or rogue cultivators. His expression darkened as other doubts surfaced. Li Wen kowtowed and said, "Our clan occupies the western part of the wilderness. To be attacked in our heartland means this group came from the east, downstream. The territories downstream belong to the Capital immortals Dao, the Sacred Writ Gate, and the Xuanmiao Temple…"

Li Jiangqian shook his head. "With a high-quality concealment Dharma artifact, passing through their territories wouldn't be difficult. We must wait for Protector Cui to return and question him."

At his words, Li Chenghao had no choice but to rein in his temper.

The Eastern shore was close. Not long after the life jade at Qingdu had shattered, a commotion was heard outside. Cui Jueyin landed on the central isle and ascended with an uneasy expression.

Following him was Li Zhoufang. The uncle who was always scheming for his descendants had lost all of his usual simple-mindedness. His face was a ghastly shade of green and white. He collapsed to his knees with a thud. "Clan Head…" he stammered, trembling. "You must avenge him! My brother… he worked diligently his entire life, only to be murdered by our enemies… Not even his bones remain! He didn't even have many children!"

He wept uncontrollably, and Li Jiangqian felt the situation becoming increasingly difficult. This was no time for formalities. After calming Li Chenghao and Li Zhoufang, he had Cui Jueyin come forward directly. "Protector Cui," he said, his voice laced with anger, "you saw the demonic cultivators. What were they wearing? Did you uncover any clues about their movements?"

Cui Jueyin hesitated, glancing at Li Jiangqian and then at Li Chenghao. The middle-aged man had just lost a nephew he'd watched grow up; the weight of his grief was unimaginable to the others. Cui Jueyin's hesitation made him lose his patience.

Seeing Li Chenghao's volatile state, Cui Jueyin finally spoke, his expression troubled. "I don't know their exact numbers… but they were all at the Foundation Establishment Realm and wielded Dharma artifacts that seemed particularly effective at breaking formations. The two great formations weren't very sophisticated; they were like paper… broken in an instant."

"Two of them engaged me in a Dharma Art battle. Protector An, Miaoshui, and many other cultivators present saw it… One used 'Converging Water,' his immortal foundation unknown. The other was very obvious… it was 'Sorrowful Southern Water'… He even used some remarkably high-quality talismans to escape… He is definitely not from an ordinary background."

"I pursued them all the way to the Sacred Writ Gate's territory, only to find that they too were fighting a group of demonic cultivators in a fierce battle. I had no choice but to retreat."

At these words, Li Jiangqian frowned immediately, understanding Cui Jueyin's reluctance to speak.

Sorrowful Southern Water!

There was only one Purple Mansion Realm power in the world famous for cultivating Sorrowful Southern Water: the Capital immortals Dao, the very same force facing the Li Clan from across the river.

'How is that possible!'

Li Jiangqian was stunned, but comprehension dawned on Li Chenghao. He fell to his knees with a thud. "It really was the Capital immortals Dao!" he cried out in grief. "They tied up our main forces on the river while secretly sending cultivators to infiltrate the Eastern shore and ambush us! Just as I thought… the Capital immortals Dao… they've been plotting against our clan for a long time!"

Li Jiangqian helped him up. "There are many in Jiangnan who cultivate Sorrowful Southern Water. The Lingu Family does as well. It's just one type of immortal foundation; we can't draw any conclusions yet. Grand-uncle, please take care of yourself…"

But Li Chenghao refused to rise. Li Zhoufang, his face streaked with tears, gritted his teeth. "There may be many who use Sorrowful Southern Water, but there is only one who is our sworn enemy!"

Li Chenghao turned to Cui Jueyin, his voice choked with sobs. "Protector Cui, since you fought our enemies, you must have a sense of their skill! Were their Dharma Arts refined? Was their immortal foundation profound? Surely you can judge their level! If they were from some motley group of Daoist traditions, they would have been no match for you!"

"To escape from your hands without leaving a trace… I fear it could only be that family from across the river that cultivates Sorrowful Southern Water!"

Li Chenghao's hatred ran deep. The death of his daughter, Li Xingsai, years ago was also linked to the Capital immortals Dao. Now, Li Zhouyang's death was added to the tally. How could he not be grinding his teeth in fury?

Though he was typically stern and odd, his mind was as sharp as anyone's. He had immediately grasped the key point, asking the very questions Li Jiangqian and Li Xuanxuan wanted to ask. Cui Jueyin sighed. "The man's cultivation method was very profound, certainly from a reputable Daoist tradition. His spell arts were no weaker than my Cui Clan's. Unfortunately, his cultivation level was lacking. He only escaped by using several high-grade talismans."

With that description, the man might as well have had the words "Capital immortals Dao" tattooed on his face.

Li Jiangqian sighed inwardly. Not everyone was privy to the situation in Jiangbei. From Li Chenghao's perspective, this could only be the work of the Capital immortals Dao. But Cui Jueyin and the others knew of the private understanding between the two powers. Li Jiangqian refused to believe that at a moment like this, Guan Gongxiao would lose his mind and plot against their clan.

'Guan Gongxiao is pragmatic, but he's not a reckless fool. He wouldn't do something like this for such a small, short-term gain…'

He glanced at Cui Jueyin, who clearly looked at a loss, unsure how to explain the situation. After a moment of thought, Li Jiangqian heard Li Xuanxuan let out a long sigh. The old man tapped his cane on the ground and straightened up, his voice aged but clear.

"Chenghao, our clan is in a standoff with the Capital immortals Dao in the north, but it is just that—a standoff. Both sides are holding back, afraid of the consequences, unwilling to make a real move. Now, something like this happens out of the blue, with the undisguised use of Sorrowful Southern Water. Do you not think it's possible some other power is watching with greedy eyes, fanning the flames in secret, hoping our clan and the one across the river will fight to the death so they can be the fisherman who reaps the rewards? That would only bring pain to our loved ones and joy to our enemies!"

"A profound Sorrowful Southern Water technique may be a symbol of the Capital immortals Dao and the Lingu Family, but that doesn't mean it can't fall into the hands of others. If our rivals across the river truly had such capabilities, why wouldn't they use them to launch a sneak attack during the great battle on the river? Why would they go through all this trouble to kill a mere Qi Refining cultivator? Just to spite us?"

His words had a considerable effect. Li Chenghao's expression shifted, a hint of doubt appearing, though the fury in his eyes did not recede. He remained prostrated on the ground. "The Old Master is right. I was reckless… But this happened under the watchful eyes of everyone on the Eastern shore. If we don't react… the consequences will be dire."

Li Chenghao had a point. The Li Clan's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were not often seen. To suffer such a blow, the murder of an influential elder from the direct line, without any response would surely damage their prestige.

But Li Jiangqian only frowned and turned to Li Zhoufang. "First Uncle," he asked softly, "what delayed you by half an hour?"

Li Zhoufang wiped away his tears, no longer caring for appearances. "It's a rather shameful affair, but I must speak of it now. I brought a concubine with me to the Eastern shore, and I discovered signs of her infidelity. I was consumed by rage at the time and spent half an hour dragging out her lover… and because of that… because of that…"

"I understand."

Only then did Li Jiangqian look away, changing the subject. "Did the elder leave behind any personal effects? How shall the incense offerings be arranged? Please have the Qingdu branch handle these matters first. I will send people to make inquiries… there may be an answer. Please rest assured, Grand-uncle, this matter will not be dropped… but to vent our anger, we must first find the true culprit."

"As for the Eastern shore, I will have Chen Yang go and search for clues."

Li Zhoufang immediately kowtowed in thanks, tears streaming down his face. But Li Chenghao was not so easily placated. Hearing no specific timeline, he remained silent, looking up until Li Minggong shot him a glance. He had no choice but to kowtow twice more before leading Li Zhoufang away.

Li Jiangqian had someone close the hall doors. His face instantly darkened. "Which power is so bold…" he said in a low voice, "to dare stir up this kind of trouble in the wilderness at a time like this! They must truly hate our clan to the bone…"

Li Minggong's expression was just as cold. "I think something is wrong on the Eastern shore as well. For Zhouyang to run into them means his position was exposed."

"That's inevitable!" Li Xuanxuan shook his head. "Our own Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are right by the river. Of course there's no need to hide their movements. Who could have expected a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators to appear suddenly from the mountains, their presence concealed?"

"The plan now is to search the Eastern shore and communicate with the Capital immortals Dao."

Li Jiangqian pondered for a few seconds before asking, "Why bother? I believe the Old Master's earlier words were more accurate. Someone wants to see us fight the Capital immortals Dao more fiercely, or perhaps they don't want to see us secretly reconcile…"

Li Minggong sighed. "But following that line of thought, the Sacred Writ Gate, the Xuanmiao Sect, and even the Chengyun Gate are all possibilities."

Li Jiangqian fell silent, a sense of unease growing in his heart.

'Where are Daoist Master Tinglan and Daoist Master Qiuhu? It's one thing for Fei Qingya to be left without arrangements for the Qi she cultivates, but now a group of people has caused chaos in the wilderness, and there's still no reaction from them…'

As far as he knew, Ning Wan was at Lake Xian, so it was understandable she couldn't intervene. But now Tinglan had also vanished. Events in Jiangbei had likely taken a different turn, forcing this Purple Mansion Realm expert to head further north. Li Jiangqian sighed heavily and continued, "Furthermore, I fear a divine ability was involved in this. First Uncle narrowly escaped with his life. Could it be that the mastermind didn't want to involve the Purple Smoke Gate? If so, this is far more troublesome than we thought!"

"Unlikely." Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and shook his head, sighing. "You may not know, but I do. This wasn't a one-day affair. He deliberately had Second Brother take his place so he could hide and observe. A Purple Mansion Realm expert wouldn't set up such a protracted scheme… especially one that began back on the lake. It makes no sense. I think it was just… luck!"

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian's expression actually improved. He nodded. "Then I'm more confident. Putting everything together, I don't think it was the Chengyun or Xuanmiao Sects. They don't have the inclination for this right now… In fact, they probably see that our conflict with the Capital immortals Dao is just an act. Making a move like this would be asking for trouble… needlessly dirtying their own hands."

"As for the Sacred Writ Gate, Daoist Master Zhu Gong is a friend of Daoist Master Tinglan. While she governs with a gentle hand, she isn't so lenient as that. The demonic cultivators under her command wouldn't have the loyalty to start such a fire."

He turned and drew out a sheet of letter paper. "For this matter," he said seriously, "I think we should make inquiries toward the Eastern Sea."

But before Li Jiangqian could elaborate, another clamour of footsteps was heard outside. He had the hall doors opened to let them in. The old man Qu Bushi hurried forward, his face a mixture of shock and bewilderment.

"Reporting to the Clan Head and all the elders… the Hall of the Locust Soul has crossed the Fanyun Territory and… and is fighting the Golden Tang Gate!"

Li Jiangqian was not surprised by the news. He descended from the dais. "The Golden Tang Gate?"

"Indeed!"

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow. "When did this news arrive?"

"Last night, it is said."

Li Minggong had a very poor impression of the Golden Tang Gate. She should have been pleased by this news, but with the death of a direct clan member, her interest was muted. She just shook her head. "They deserve it… The Golden Tang Gate was insufferably arrogant in Jiangbei back in the day. Their time has come. How many people do they even have left in their entire gate? I estimate they truly are no match for that motley crew from the Hall of the Locust Soul."

"What pretext are they using?" Li Minggong asked.

Qu Bushi quickly replied, "To unify the Baijiang Creek region… I heard that not long after the Hall of the Locust Soul was established, the Golden Feather Sect sent representatives to acknowledge their rule in Jiangbei, even mentioning that the Three Rivers region belonged to the Hall."

"The Golden Tang Gate also has territory in Baijiang Creek, so Daoist Bo used this to start trouble. Normally, that territory isn't much, especially since the Golden Tang Gate has sealed its mountain and has few holdings left. They could have just given it up…"

"But the Hall of the Locust Soul didn't just want the territory; they also demanded the nearby spirit mines… The Situ Clan has no other source of income now and relies on those to survive. Naturally, they refused."

Li Jiangqian let out a sigh of relief, shaking his head inwardly.

'I thought I was running out of time, but I underestimated Daoist Bo's greed. He now has fortune on his side, so no Purple Mansion Realm cultivator will use a divine ability to guide him. This is purely his own avarice…'

"What does the Golden Feather Sect have to say?"

Qu Bushi hurriedly explained, "Ever since Daoist Master Tianhuo appeared in person, took the Golden Tang Gate's treasures, and treated their members with utter disdain… the rumours in Jiangbei have faded. The cultivators of the Golden Tang Gate were overcome with shame and anger and no longer dare to speak of friendly relations with the Golden Feather Sect. Daoist Bo… likely saw this as his chance to boldly advance westward."

Li Jiangqian nodded. So much had happened in a single day. He rubbed his temples and suddenly asked, "The Golden Tang Gate still has Situ Ku… he's in our clan's dungeon, isn't he?"

Situ Ku had been imprisoned by the Li Clan for many years, his cultivation sealed, kept under house arrest. Furthermore, the Ding Clan had once been in the Funan territory, and Ding Weizeng had some acquaintance with Situ Ku. Thanks to this connection, the old man's life had been reasonably comfortable.

'The Golden Tang Gate has been abandoned by the Golden Feather Sect. After all, they did their dirty work for so many years that their reputation in both Jiangnan and Jiangbei is rotten to the core. They won't have a good end fighting the Hall of the Locust Soul.'

'This fight will buy the True Monarch time to grow. Once those mines are lost and the Situ Clan is forced to retreat into their mountain, the ascendant Hall of the Locust Soul will be the perfect stage for the main act.'

As for the Situ Clan catching the True Monarch's favour, the chances were slim. The number of Daoist traditions and Purple Mansion Realm experts they had offended in Jiangbei and Jiangnan could be counted on more than one hand. Their reputation stank, and everyone was content to just watch them fall.

Thinking of Situ Ku at this moment, Li Jiangqian's intentions were similarly calculating. The old man was weak-willed and greedy, incredibly easy to manipulate. Crucially, his cultivation was high enough to be significant in the now-weakened Golden Tang Gate…

'The Tangdao Mountain Range is protected by a great formation. The Hall of the Locust Soul is unlikely to break through. The end result will probably be another sealed mountain. Once this is over, Situ Ku will be an important figure. All in all, a good pawn to have.'



# Chapter 854: The Fruit of Vengeance

The last vestiges of autumn clung to Moongaze Lake, painting the mountains in a tapestry of red and gold. The sky was a vast, polished canvas, streaked with crimson clouds as the setting sun bled across the horizon, dyeing the world in its fiery glow.

The sea of clouds churned, and a single point of azure-gold light pierced through, absorbing the radiant splendor of the sun and moon's celestial exchange. Only then did it descend, weaving through the forest to land on the large island in the center of the lake.

The sealed entrance to a cavern estate rumbled, shaking off layers of dust. A sliver of red light shot out, flickering before it coalesced before the grand array. It solidified into the form of a woman dressed in a long, cloud-silk gown. Tied at her waist was a talisman etched with the image of a violet-black mountain ghost, which whispered with the sound of a faint wind as she moved.

She took a step forward, raising a hand to catch the azure-gold light from the sky. With a gentle turn of her wrist, the color dissolved into motes of silver.

'Perfect,' she thought. 'I've finally mastered Scattering White Falling Feather.'

She summoned the wind and soared toward the main hall. She hadn't traveled far when she saw a gaunt, white-haired old man bowing before the entrance. She smiled.

"Guest Elder Qu… what brings you here?"

Qu Bushi, lost in thought about how to deliver his report, jumped in fright. He looked up, his expression a mixture of shock and suspicion. Seeing her, he first stared blankly, then hastily bowed.

"First Lady… you've come out of seclusion?!"

Li Que'wan was the most gifted woman of the Jiangque generation, and it had been Li Qinghong herself who had brought her back to the island all those years ago. In Qu Bushi's eyes, her status was exceedingly noble. The old man bowed again, sighing.

"The Family Head will finally have some help… It's about the matter in Jiangbei…"

Before he could say more, the sound of footsteps echoed from within the hall. A young man in crimson robes descended quickly from the dais and came to the door. His eyes lit up, his face a complex mask of joy and worry.

"Sister, you're out!" he exclaimed with a smile. "Why was there no celestial phenomenon?"

Li Que'wan clasped her hands in a salute. "The transformations of my Dao are rooted in the nature of things," she said softly. "A simple sunset is enough. It isn't a Daoist tradition that needs to announce itself to the world."

"Let's speak inside."

Li Jiangqian gestured her in before closing the heavy doors. Once inside, he leaned back toward the entrance and asked Qu Bushi in a low voice, "What is it?"

Qu Bushi hurriedly reported, "The Golden Tang Gate has been defeated. Those men from the Situ family were all gravely wounded. The Gate Master, Situ Biao, had his eyes gouged out and his organs removed to be refined into… one of Daoist Master Bai's artifacts… The Golden Tang Gate has retreated into the mountains. The Hall of the Locust Soul is returning in triumph, and Protector Black Rat will surely head back to Baiku. There's going to be trouble."

"I understand."

Li Jiangqian dismissed him and turned back into the hall, a smile finally gracing his features. "Congratulations, sister. What kind of marvel have you achieved?"

Li Que'wan cultivated the Golden Book of Houshu. Her Immortal Foundation, the 'Houshenshu,' was built upon the principles of the Whole Pill. Very few legacies of this nature had survived, and most had never even heard the name. She certainly wouldn't dare speak of it openly, let alone inquire about it.

"The Houshenshu," Li Que'wan began to explain, "follows the nurturing path of the Whole Pill. It gathers immortal light and refines golden mercury to evade death and extend life. It allows one to command birds and beasts, to seek immortality through secret arts, and to forge the essences of heaven and earth in the pursuit of longevity."

She paused, a hint of hesitation in her voice. "Fundamentally," she admitted with a shake of her head, "it's a Daoist tradition for secluded cultivation, focused on preserving one's life."

Li Jiangqian listened intently and nodded. "Of the Whole Pill Dao, I've only ever heard of the 'Mibai Gong,' which is quite formidable in combat. The 'Houshenshu' seems to lean more toward escape and refining mercurial medicines… which is fitting."

He offered a faint smile. "You have brothers and uncles in the family; we can always protect you. A foundation like yours… is far more beneficial to the clan than what the rest of us have. My own Immortal Foundation provides little support. On a normal day, I can only consume spiritual woods and herbs to advance my cultivation. It's of no use to our clansmen."

"Brother, I must disagree," Li Que'wan countered with a smile.

"Combat is unavoidable. As the saying goes, one cultivates arts to protect the Dao. When Daoist Master Zhaojing was at the Foundation Establishment Realm, he was renowned for his skill in alchemy, yet his cultivation was still peerless, the first among the four 'Xi' generation talents. I've never heard of him losing a fight."

"Not even Daoist Master Yehui, with his three Divine Abilities, could harm him. In the end, it took a great Daoist Master to force him to flee across the sea… If he only knew alchemy, I doubt he would have reached his current heights."

Li Jiangqian looked as if he wanted to argue but simply nodded.

Li Que'wan continued, "The 'Houshenshu' provides an incredible boost to the transformation of material properties, likely even stronger than the 'Mibai Gong.' It can harmonize the energies of yin and yang and assist in many conversions among the Five Virtues, primarily Water, Fire, and Metal."

"The second aspect is transformation. This Dao can alter one's appearance and form, disguise artifacts and formations, and even conceal one's Daoist tradition. If I break through to the Divine Ability realm, the potential for change will be immense, no longer confined to a human body."

Li Jiangqian nodded silently, lost in thought.

Li Que'wan's expression grew worried. "The Whole Pill Dao fears only three things. First is 'Converging Water,' which can disperse mercury into sand. Second is 'Merging Fire,' a viler threat that burns mercury and melts lead, destroying spiritual essence. The last is 'Primordial Lightning,' which is known today as the Dao of Primordial Magnetism…"

Li Jiangqian sounded regretful. "A pity. The Dao of 'Converging Water' is currently flourishing, making it difficult to avoid. 'Merging Fire' is also a well-known tradition. As for 'Primordial Lightning,' it has faded into obscurity for a long time. I've heard it only exists in the Wu State, so you needn't worry too much."

Li Que'wan nodded in agreement. "Then there is the Scattering White Falling Feather. It's an unheard-of escape art. I struggled to grasp its basics for the longest time, but by harnessing the cohesive power of the 'Houshenshu,' the celestial phenomenon aligned with the principles of transformation, and I finally managed to master it."

The cultivation of the Whole Pill Dao had always been strange. Li Jiangqian was surprised that even the celestial phenomenon of a breakthrough could aid one's training. "Congratulations," he said. "Might I see it? I've never heard of a Whole Pill escape art."

"It would be unwise." Li Que'wan shook her head. "This escape art is akin to a cultivator's blood escape. Using it to flee takes a heavy toll on one's vital energy and cultivation. It's not something to be demonstrated lightly."

As understanding dawned on Li Jiangqian's face, the door opened and Li Xuanxuan entered from a side entrance. Dressed in ink-blue robes, the old man's face was wreathed in smiles, and he carried a small box.

"Wan'er!"

Of Li Xuanxuan's many children, few had amounted to much besides Li Ximing. If Li Zhouming was the apple of his eye, then Li Que'wan was the flesh of his heart. Seeing him now, the two younger cultivators bowed together. The old man placed the box on the table and helped them up, one with each hand. "Congratulations, Que'wan," he beamed. "Take a look at this…"

Li Que'wan accepted the box. It was no larger than a pillow. Inside, nestled on a bed of golden cotton, was a single, silver-grey droplet of mercury the size of a fingernail.

Her gaze was instantly captivated.

"In the northern riverlands," the old man explained, "there's a place called the Tiefu Kingdom, territory of the demonic Helian family. They sent people during the north-south conflict, a man named Helian Changguang. He was slain by Xuanfeng at the Great Ning Palace, and this treasure was found on his body… We couldn't tell if it was a spiritual object or a Dharma Art artifact. It was just this drop of mercury."

"It's an item of the Whole Pill nature, which none of us could identify. The Helian family also has Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, so we never brought it out. We've kept it until today."

"Then, when Ximing broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, I remembered this item and showed it to him. He said it was a Dharma Art artifact, not a spiritual object, and that it could only be unsealed by a Whole Pill Dharma Art."

Li Que'wan conjured a wisp of silver light and let it fall onto the mercury droplet. After a moment of calculation, she picked it up, her face filled with delight. "It is undoubtedly a Whole Pill artifact. It is ancient… one could call it an artifact, but it feels more like a legacy… It truly has an archaic quality."

She closed the droplet in her palm, and as her spiritual energy flowed into it, a silver light flashed. The droplet had vanished, already absorbed into her Sea of Qi.

"The refinement is so fast!"

Li Que'wan closed her eyes for a breath to experience it. "This artifact is a treasure for internal cultivation," she said softly. "It resides within the Dantian and can assist in casting Dharma Arts. It also has the effect of clarifying the spiritual sense and invigorating the mind. When necessary, it can even serve as a medium for Whole Pill transformations."

"It contains a technique called the 'Profound Art of the Blood-Silver Dew.' It's an ancient demonic art that consumes blood essence and uses lead-mercury arts to form a pill…"

The nature of the art was clearly problematic. Li Que'wan sighed. "In terms of lifesaving potential, this art is only a step below my Scattering White Falling Feather. Unfortunately, it is a demonic art. While a few of its spell arts might be usable, the entire Daoist tradition is of no benefit to our family."

"As for the artifact itself, it can be brought out to face enemies or to save one's life… For our family, the artifact itself is what holds value."

Li Xuanxuan sighed. "As long as it's useful. But while the Helian family has declined, they are still surrounded by powerful enemies and have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Just be sure they don't recognize it."

Li Que'wan nodded slightly. The item was stored in her Dantian, not worn on her waist, so it wouldn't be easily identified. Besides, it was uncertain whether the item had belonged to the Helian family or if Helian Changguang had found it himself. She decided to set the matter aside for now and asked about Jiangbei.

Li Jiangqian gave her a brief summary, his brow furrowed. "Regarding Second Uncle's murder, the Capital immortals Dao sent Gongsun Bofan to clarify their position. Guan Gongxiao is extremely anxious about this and has sent several letters professing his innocence. It doesn't seem like the Capital immortals Dao was involved."

"My earlier thought was… it was for the best that you were in seclusion, to avoid being entangled in this mess. But now that you're out, and I've tested that the Talisman Seed is indeed effective, I will tell you."

His expression darkened. "Several months ago, Second Uncle was killed, and Daoist Master Tinglan has yet to appear. I suspect something is very wrong in Jiangbei. You are skilled in shamanic arts, so I wanted your insight."

Having been in seclusion for so long, Li Que'wan barely knew this 'Second Uncle.' She felt a brief moment of sympathy before looking up sharply. "Were his remains recovered?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head grimly. This complicated things. "Does he have any descendants?" Li Que'wan asked. "We could try using their blood essence… but the method is imprecise and can lead to false readings."

At this, Li Xuanxuan immediately stroked his beard. "I will go and fetch some."

As the old man exited through the side door, Li Jiangqian lowered his voice. "Wan'er, act within your limits. Don't injure yourself."

He clearly feared the matter involved the Purple Mansion Realm and could endanger Li Que'wan. Li Xuanxuan valued kinship, so Li Jiangqian wouldn't say such things in front of him. But in the eyes of the Li Family Head, a Purple Mansion Realm prospect like Li Que'wan was paramount. As for the others, mortal or cultivator, if they died, they died. It was merely a question of the magnitude of the loss.

"It's alright," Li Que'wan replied gently. "My shamanic arts is profound. With the Talisman Seed, unless I am trying to scry on a Purple Mansion Realm expert directly, it won't be a problem."

They waited a short while before Li Xuanxuan returned with a small vial of blood essence. Li Que'wan produced three ivory tokens from her sleeve, placing them in a triangular formation with the vial in the center. She contemplated for three breaths, then drew one of the tokens, repeating the process nine times.

When she finished, the spiritual glow around her slowly faded, and her face turned a shade pale. "A ninefold vengeance," she announced gravely. "Consumed by eastern flames, leaving no bones behind."

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian let out a cold laugh.

Li Que'wan elaborated tactfully, "Second Uncle… or someone in his direct bloodline, was incinerated by a fire-virtue Daoist tradition from the east. The nine-for-nine result indicates that this matter is widely known. The consistency of the nine results means no Purple Mansion Realm Divine Ability was involved. It was an act of vengeance, a blood feud to the death…"

The implication pointed directly at Crimson Reef Island. Li Jiangqian slammed a hand down on the armrest of the main seat, the truth crystallizing in his mind. He rubbed the armrest twice. "Widely known," he muttered. "A fine 'widely known.'"

"It has to be Guo Hongjian… Crimson Reef Island made the move, and everyone knows… They were likely allowed to pass through Lake Xian and the Sacred Writ Gate's territory on purpose."

The situation was crystal clear to Li Jiangqian. He sneered. "Our family and Crimson Reef Island are mortal enemies. If I were Guan Gongxiao, no matter how friendly I was with Crimson Reef, I would never reveal our tacit understanding. The news reaching the Eastern Sea would surely be that our two families were locked in battle."

"So that bastard got impatient. He made inquiries on the mainland and found that our families were merely in a standoff across the river, with no major casualties. He grew anxious and secretly killed one of our own to provoke a full-scale war, forcing the Guan family to fully side with Crimson Reef."

"He played his hand well."

Li Que'wan put away the three tokens. "If Second Uncle's ancestors were never killed by Merging Fire, then this result points to him. It was undoubtedly Crimson Reef Island."

Li Jiangqian's voice dropped. "As for your conclusion that no Purple Mansion Realm Divine Ability was involved, you're correct. This area is highly sensitive, after all. However, it's possible several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators tacitly allowed this to happen. They couldn't have been blind to the understanding between our families. Either they thought a real war between us would be better, or… it was some other kind of test."

Li Jiangqian let out a breath and strode quickly toward the entrance, pushing the doors open. "Go and summon Purple Smo—"

Before he could finish, a streak of True Fire descended from the sky. Li Minggong landed hastily before the hall, her tone urgent. "No need."

"Qian Lizi of the Purple Smoke Gate has arrived at the lake," She said grimly. "She is asking to see the Li Family Head by name!"

A knot of dread formed in Li Jiangqian's stomach. He glanced at the others around him. "Show her in."

A few moments after the order was given, a woman of breathtaking beauty in a white immortal robe appeared at the entrance. At her waist hung a bottle of glazed white jade—it was the prodigy of this generation from the Purple Smoke Gate, Qian Lizi, also known as the Treasured Vase.

Not only did this Qian Lizi act as the sect's interim leader, but she was also the master of Li Quexi, a direct descendant of the Li family!

Yet now, her expression was cold, her eyes betraying a hint of desperation. Her gaze locked onto Li Jiangqian. "Family Head," she said in a low voice, "may I have a word in private?"

Her words only worsened Li Jiangqian's feeling of unease. He dismissed the others. The moment the hall doors closed, Qian Lizi took a step forward.

"Family Head," she asked anxiously, "do you have a way to contact Daoist Master Zhaojing?!"

Li Jiangqian hesitated for a second. The woman clearly realized her question was shockingly blunt and impolite. The urgency on her face subsided slightly. "Family Head, please forgive my brashness. My master has gone missing north of Jiangbei and has yet to return. The blessed land has already sent people to the various Supreme Yang Daoist traditions for aid. Daoist Master Zhu Gong and Daoist Master Kui Qi have gone to Jiangbei to search… I hope… your clan's Daoist Master can prioritize the greater situation and return to oversee Jiangbei."

'Something *has* happened in Jiangbei!'

Qian Lizi had humbled herself completely. Within the blessed land, she stood second to only one, above tens of thousands. For a representative of a mighty Supreme Yang Daoist tradition to come here and plead so earnestly showed just how dire the situation was.

But as Li Jiangqian processed her words, a chilling realization washed over him. He stepped down from the main seat. "This… them… the matter of the True Monarch, that was an order from Mount Luoxia!"

Qian Lizi bowed her head and said nothing, as if she hadn't heard him. Li Jiangqian immediately schooled his expression, his earlier suspicions finding a terrifying explanation that struck him like a thunderclap.

'Crimson Reef Island… was their action a test to see if our Daoist Master had returned, or was it a test to see if Daoist Master Zimu had gone missing?!'

He pressed on, "What were Daoist Master Qiuhu's instructions?"

Compared to the news Qian Lizi brought, Li Jiangqian was clearly more interested in what was happening at the Purple Mansion Realm level. At his question, Qian Lizi lowered her head slightly and sighed. "We have received no news from the Daoist Master."

The implications of that statement were vast. Ning Wan didn't have a trusted subordinate like Qian Lizi in the Azure Pond Sect. It was possible that Sect Master Dantai Jin was still completely in the dark!

If Tinglan and Ning Wan left Lake Xian, it meant the affairs on both sides of the river would plunge into chaos. The True Monarch's business at Mount Luoxia would surely proceed, but without a Divine Ability overseeing the region, there was no guarantee the powers along the river wouldn't be drawn into conflict! And with Ning Wan gone, Li Quantao on Lake Xian would be like a small boat in a storm, at the mercy of the raging waves.

"What about the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate?" Li Jiangqian demanded. "And the Hengzhu Immortal Dao?"

A flicker of helplessness crossed Qian Lizi's exquisite face. She shook her head. "The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate… Daoist Master Lingmei gave instructions long ago that the gate would not involve itself in any of Jiangbei's affairs. As for the Hengzhu Immortal Dao… it's better not to speak of them!"

At the mention of Hengzhu, her expression became complicated—a mix of disappointment and anxiety. It was obvious she had suffered some embarrassing setback involving them, and the memory still stung.

Li Jiangqian fell silent. He watched as Qian Lizi's anxiety slowly morphed into suspicion. He knew he couldn't stall any longer. Just as he expected, the woman's voice took on a sorrowful, pleading tone.

"Regarding Jiangbei, my master gave an order long ago to fully protect your clan and prevent the immortal's passage across the river. Now my master is missing under suspicious circumstances. We are not asking your clan's Daoist Master to rescue her, only that he return to take control of the situation!"

"This isn't a matter for my sect alone! Across the river lies Moongaze Lake! We cannot contact either Daoist Master. Without a Purple Mansion expert, all our deployments in Jiangbei are meaningless. How can this be allowed?!"

But Li Jiangqian's mind was sharp. He wasn't thrown off by her barrage of questions. A deep suspicion arose within him.

'The Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition… Jiangnan has so many Purple Mansion Realm experts. Even if Hengzhu won't act, can they not find a single person to go to Jiangbei and take charge? Why must they ask for our Daoist Master to return?'

The Supreme Yang Daoist traditions were incredibly powerful. Any one of their Daoist Masters could stabilize the riverbank situation. Yet this woman had come to ask for Li Ximing. It felt wrong, no matter how he looked at it. He stared at her intently. "Senior Han… the esteemed masters of the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions, are they not able to manage the situation? It is just a disappearance; does it require all the masters to go searching? Please, answer this junior honestly… is Daoist Master Tinglan truly just… missing?"

Qian Lizi froze, taken aback by his question. She re-evaluated the young man before her, then bit her lip. "This… should not be spoken of freely. But since you have asked, I must answer."

"In our blessed land… the soul lamp has dimmed. There must have been a great battle in the north. Daoist Master Zhu Gong and Daoist Master Kui Qi may have to intervene. We do not know what their final condition will be… or if they can return to stand guard. Daoist Master Houfu is stretched thin in the Long region… If your clan's Daoist Master does not return, there will be no one to hold the line."

For such a thing to happen at such a critical time, it was impossible that Mount Luoxia was unaware. Li Jiangqian's face was grim. "What power dares to be so audacious? To ambush a Daoist Master of a Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in the open…"

Qian Lizi's expression grew even more complex, her voice dropping to a near whisper. "I suspect this is the disaster left behind from the 'Qi Wang Profound-Heaven Hearing' incident all those years ago… Back then, it was the Azure Pond and Purple Smoke sects that plotted together, and an elder of your clan was also involved… Now that the two great Daoist Masters have fallen, the north has begun to have ideas!"

Li Jiangqian let out a long, heavy breath.

The woman before him continued, "Furthermore, with no Purple Mansion Realm expert watching from above, are you truly at ease regarding the Fei family matter?"

Li Jiangqian was silent.

A prominent Immortal Clan like theirs surely had a way to alert Li Ximing. He could not possibly fool a well-informed member of the Purple Smoke Gate. He could only reply formally, "This junior means no disrespect. But I am young, and this matter is not for me to decide. I must consult with my elders!"

Qian Lizi stiffened and took a step back. "I implore you to decide quickly!" she bit out.

Li Jiangqian had just taken a step when both of them looked up sharply. A distant tremor had reached their ears. As Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, how could they not perceive such a subtle vibration? They exchanged a look and rushed out of the hall.

Sure enough, a torrential downpour was now lashing the lake. Within the sky-blotting rain clouds stood ranks of cultivators. Li Que'wan and the others were staring north, their faces etched with worry.

In the northern sky, a pillar of golden light shot toward the heavens. Vague plumes of dust and smoke rose into the air as dark clouds gathered and rain began to fall, creating a scene of shocking gloom.

'That's the direction of the Hall of the Locust Soul. A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator has fallen… possibly more than one…'

"Where is Qu Bushi!" Li Jiangqian roared, turning his head.

He then noticed that Qian Lizi beside him was staring blankly at the northern sky. Her fists were clenched, her entire body trembling with what seemed like a mixture of fear and excitement. Her beautiful eyes were locked on the distant horizon, her lips moving in a silent whisper.

Seeing this, a chill ran down Li Jiangqian's spine. He had long suspected her entanglement with a True Monarch was deep, though he hadn't known which one. Now, he hastily took a step back, averting his gaze from her eyes.

"Senior!" he cried out.



# Chapter 855: The Demonic Disciple

Li Jiangqian’s sharp cry jolted Qian Lizi from her trance. The woman paused in mid-air, her face pale as she turned back, as if waking from a dream.

“Someone killed cultivators from the Hall of the Locust Soul!” she announced, her voice trembling.

Li Jiangqian had feared the Purple Smoke Sect’s leader would simply ride the winds north without a second thought. Seeing that she was still clear-headed was a relief, but the meaning of her words quickly sank in. “Someone?” he repeated in a low, questioning tone.

She had said ‘someone,’ not ‘the True Monarch.’ It was possible that Lin Feng wasn't the one who had killed the Hall of the Locust Soul’s cultivators.

But in this day and age, who could kill them? Who would dare?

Seeing the pale, shaken look on Qian Lizi’s face, Li Jiangqian watched as she answered, a mixture of horror and shock in her voice.

“It can’t be this soon… It’s far too early. At this stage, it should be a Qi Refining junior managing to escape from a Foundation Establishment Realm master! How could they have fallen? And more than one of them… Someone else has intervened…”

The stage in Jiangbei had been set by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the other powers along the riverbanks. For something like this to happen now, especially while Tinglan was away, spelled trouble.

‘It’s truly one link in a chain leading to the next,’ Li Jiangqian thought, his expression turning grim. ‘All was calm until it wasn't, and then one move could unleash a cataclysmic storm.’

He lowered his voice and asked, “To move against the Hall of the Locust Soul… Will the north not… object?”

Qian Lizi, her face still ashen, shook her head. She bit her lip. “This… This is of little consequence to the north. The Hall of the Locust Soul was part of our arrangement. As long as the True Monarch is present, there will always be a stage. It hardly matters if it’s built in the east or the west, or which pawn plays the fool… If another power is dissatisfied with the stage we've built, they are welcome to tear it down…”

She continued, “After all, every time the True Monarch graces the world with his presence, new grotto-heavens and mystic realms appear for us to divide. There are always benefits to be had. What's happened now is… someone is fanning the flames and has torn down a corner of the stage.”

Li Jiangqian’s gaze hardened. He understood that the grotto-heaven at Dongli Mountain had been the last ‘benefit.’ He raised an eyebrow. “How will Senior Han… respond to this?”

The situation in Jiangbei was spiraling out of control. With Tinglan gone, Li Jiangqian desperately wanted to avoid having Qian Lizi manage affairs. She was, in all likelihood, one of the women left behind by the former True Monarch. Who knew what kind of hidden dangers she represented? She was a ticking time bomb.

He had no idea what assurances Tinglan possessed that made her confident enough to let Qian Lizi control the Purple Smoke Gate. A thick cloud of suspicion rose in his mind.

‘Strange. Daoist Master Tinglan is a shrewd woman. Is she truly certain that the True Monarch will never meet Qian Lizi?’

As he mulled it over, Qian Lizi quickly regained her composure. “The priority right now is to find out what’s happening in the north,” she said softly. “I must trouble your clan to contact the Capital immortals Dao. I will go to Lake Xian to investigate.”

Without waiting for a reply, the woman turned her magical wind. “As for the matter of the Daoist Master, your clan should make a decision quickly. After I visit Lake Xian, I must return to my blessed land to confer with the elders. If you have any news, you can send a message to the Purple Smoke Gate.”

With a brief farewell, she and the other Purple Smoke Gate disciples on the island flew eastward on the wind. Only then did the Li family members gather around. Qu Bushi finally approached, his head lowered in a somewhat disheveled state.

Li Jiangqian gestured for him to rise. “What news? Have you found out which major figure fell in the north?”

Qu Bushi’s expression was grave. He took a step forward and spoke in a hushed tone. “Nothing on that yet, but this subordinate has received other news. The Buddhist cultivators under Chengyun, the Yaosa Chengmi, have already crossed Chengshui Marsh and entered the territory of Xuanmiao Temple. They are proselytizing their Buddhist cultivation methods far and wide.”

“The Capital immortals Dao did not stop them, allowing the group of Buddhist cultivators to pass through their lands and head toward Baihai Creek. There seems to be some chaos in the region.”

The last sliver of hope in Li Jiangqian’s heart died. If the Yaosa Chengmi were in Xuanmiao Temple’s territory, an entire Capital immortals Dao’s domain separated them from the Hall of the Locust Soul. It was impossible that the two groups had fought each other.

‘Someone else must have interfered.’

Li Jiangqian waved him away and returned to the hall in silence. He relayed the recent developments, and a heavy quiet fell over the room. It was Li Minggong who broke the silence.

“Two Daoist Masters are clashing in the north, a fact our family was unaware of,” he said softly. “Yet Crimson Reef Island deliberately ambushed us to probe our situation. That alone reveals their stance. And since Daoist Master Zhu Gong went north to provide aid, it’s unlikely she was the one who intentionally let them through.”

“Crimson Reef Island…”

Li Jiangqian shook his head. “Guo Hongjian cultivates the Merging Fire. He cannot be judged by ordinary standards. If there wasn’t a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability at play, Guo Hongjian’s probe was likely an unexpected opportunity for all the clans…”

“As for the Sacred Writ Gate, even if Daoist Master Zhu Gong sides with the Purple Smoke Gate, letting Guo Hongjian through to test for our Daoist Master’s whereabouts is understandable… This situation… it’s too complicated. With the Luoxia, Supreme Yang, and Zhao Buddhists involved, and layers upon layers of Purple Mansion Realm powers beneath them, you can’t see the full picture without the right background. I don’t think it would be wise for our Daoist Master to return.”

Though his face was etched with worry, Li Xuanxuan understood the priorities. After listening, he stroked his beard and said, “Indeed. Daoist Master Tinglan was the one managing the situation before. She, a prominent figure of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the Purple Smoke blessed land, was still ambushed and went missing. Now that the other major powers refuse to take her seat, they suddenly think of our family.”

“As for the north, though it is extremely dangerous, our family currently has the advantage of acting first…”

The sky over the north had already opened up, and a torrential downpour now fell upon Moongaze Lake. Li Jiangqian could smell the danger in the air. Beside him, Li Que'wan spoke gently.

“I fear this is a clash between titans. Whether it’s the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition or the forces aligned against it, neither is a power our family can afford to provoke. We should just give her a reply and leave it at that.”

“Agreed.”

Li Jiangqian seemed lost in thought for a moment before he spoke again. “First, let’s observe the situation. I will send someone to the Purple Smoke Gate with our reply. We will say that our family has issued a warning, but when the Daoist Master can arrive—or whether he’ll be intercepted by the Changxiao Gate along the way—is another matter entirely.”

“That is the first step. The second… with our Daoist Master gone, news from Jiangbei is shrouded in mist. The situation there changes in a heartbeat; waiting for news to arrive could take an eternity. We must appease the Capital immortals Dao and use them to observe Jiangbei, especially since Yehui is too selfish to even leave a single message… The Capital immortals Dao’s trust and reliance on our family is currently very high.”

“But what about Crimson Reef Island…?”

“No matter.”

Li Jiangqian picked up a brush. After a moment of thought, he began to write:

“The recent matter has been resolved. The culprit was Guo Hongjian of the Guo clan. He sought to create a rift between our two families to advance his ambitions on the northern shore. I fear this portends trouble regarding the Hall of the Locust Soul. If you have any news, please write to me.”

He read it over twice to ensure no one could discern his family’s internal affairs from the letter. “The Capital immortals Dao and Crimson Reef Island have been on good terms for years,” he said. “We cannot be too direct, lest they think we are sowing discord and become needlessly wary. I will simply link the two events. Let Guan Gongxiao draw his own conclusions…”

The Capital immortals Dao had a representative stationed with the Li family, who could deliver the letter. After folding it, Li Jiangqian immediately had it sent off. He turned to the others, his expression serious.

“I ask you all to keep a close watch on the four lake shores. This is no time for carelessness. If fate is at work and some powerful figure emerges on the shore, we must crush them early!”

“Especially the eastern shore and the wilderness.”

Since someone was sabotaging the stage in Jiangbei, there was no telling what might happen next. While the lake was relatively safe, the eastern shore was now the most vulnerable.

Everyone nodded. Less than half a day later, the long-awaited messenger from the Capital immortals Dao finally arrived. A set of footsteps echoed outside the hall, and the messenger entered, dispelling the illusion masking his face.

“Greetings to the Clan Head!” he said in a low voice.

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow. “Rise.”

The man had thick brows and large eyes, with a mature and steady bearing. A saber hung at his waist. It was none other than the Capital immortals Dao’s Gongsun Bofan.

He dutifully knelt on one knee. “My master has received the Clan Head’s letter. He is deeply aware of Guo Hongjian’s treachery… and despises him for it…”

He offered a string of pleasantries, but they were empty words. Li Jiangqian remained noncommittal, instead carefully observing the man before him.

Gongsun Bofan’s eyes were dull and his face was pale. Faint gray-tinged scars were visible on his face and neck, as if he had just survived a life-or-death battle and had nearly lost his life.

A sense of foreboding struck Li Jiangqian. “Sir Gongsun… what happened to you?” he asked, his tone grim.

Gongsun Bofan was so heavily injured, yet the Capital immortals Dao had sent him to deliver a message across the lake instead of letting him recuperate. A strong sense of danger washed over Li Jiangqian. As expected, the swordsman’s face was etched with bitterness.

“I was wounded by another…”

“Reporting to the Old Master, my master is equally perplexed by the matter you inquired about. The murder of the Hall of the Locust Soul’s cultivators was utterly unexpected, and it happened in their very heartland. My Daoist tradition is overwhelmed and has no resources to investigate.”

“As for the river… there are very few of our people left. I implore your clan to refrain from issuing any challenges, lest it lead to an awkward situation.”

Li Jiangqian feigned shock and anger. “How could it have come to this?!”

Gongsun Bofan had always been a steady figure, a man who had even earned praise from Li Zhouwei years ago. But even someone as composed as him was filled with fear and dread as he recounted the events.

“Clan Head, within our domain… a demonic disciple has appeared. I don't know what kind of inheritance he stumbled upon, but he emerged from a minor clan, suddenly broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, and proceeded to kill a city lord, slaughter the guards, and plunder spiritual treasures…”

“Not all of our cultivators were on the river; several were guarding our territories. When the arrays shattered and Spiritual Talismans flared, they immediately went to provide support. Who could have imagined… they would be killed by this demonic disciple who had just reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!”

Li Jiangqian listened intently, stunned. “And then?”

Gongsun Bofan shook his head, a look of lingering fear on his face. “I was the first to arrive… I never expected him to throw three talismans at me. Their power was terrifying. If I hadn’t diligently practiced Dharma Arts over the years and refined my cultivation, I doubt I would have escaped with my life.”

“Ancient talismans of that caliber would be considered a trump card even for the direct lineage of my master’s clan, yet he used those three as if they were common trinkets, without the slightest hesitation… It allowed him to escape.”

“Our cultivators have now spread out to scour every inch of Baiye Creek to find him. My sect master is short on manpower, so he sent me here.”

Li Jiangqian’s heart pounded as he listened.

‘This must be a key figure brought forth by the True Monarch, and he was already at the Foundation Establishment Realm when discovered… Back then, a single Qi Refining junior like Xu Xiao was enough to cause our family immense trouble. For this one to emerge only after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm is truly deadly!’

‘Worse, we don't know if this person is friend or foe. If he intends to align himself with the True Monarch… the Capital immortals Dao is about to be gravely wounded. They’re in for a world of hurt!’

Looking at Gongsun Bofan’s ashen face, Li Jiangqian was secretly astonished. He knew that the Capital immortals Dao, being situated in Jiangbei, would have more troubles than his own clan, but he had never imagined something so fierce and humiliating. “Then what is your master’s intention?” he asked.

A look of determination crossed Gongsun Bofan’s face. “My master says this person cannot have gone far; he must still be in Jiangbei. If the opportunity arises, he hopes your clan can offer timely aid and lend us a hand.”

No wonder the message from Guan Gongxiao had cursed Guo Hongjian so thoroughly. The Capital immortals Dao was also facing a critical moment. With a demonic disciple emerging from within their own ranks, their presence on the river was as good as non-existent. And Guo Hongjian was over on the other side, provoking the Li family on their behalf! If the Li family truly grew angry and crossed the river to attack, they would be assaulted from both inside and out…

It was a testament to Guan Gongxiao’s usually calm demeanor that he was still able to write letters. A man with a shorter temper would have coughed up blood from the rage.

But this turn of events made Guan Gongxiao’s request for help incredibly awkward. Why would Li Jiangqian want to get involved in this mess? He put on a look of anger and disappointment and sighed.

“I understand that our fates are linked, that we must help each other. But your sect and Crimson Reef Island are as one! How could Guo Hongjian understand that? Now he’s running around with a set of hidden magical artifacts. How can my family dare to let anyone venture out?”

Gongsun Bofan was not a thick-skinned man and looked somewhat ashamed. Li Jiangqian didn’t give him a chance to interrupt, continuing with a regretful tone.

“The moment Guo’s clan appeared in the wilderness from the Eastern Sea, I suspected something was about to happen in Jiangbei. My letter was meant as a warning, but I didn’t expect it to be a step too late!”

He shook his head. “But rest assured, my family has its own share of troubles. We will not take this opportunity to cross the river. You should return for now. Let’s ensure news between Jiangbei and here travels more frequently, so our two families can aid each other at a moment’s notice.”

Gongsun Bofan nodded repeatedly at his words. “Thank you for your understanding, Clan Head…”

With that, he took his leave.

Li Jiangqian saw him out of the hall, watching his figure disappear into the distance as his mind churned.

In truth, Guan Gongxiao wasn’t afraid of the Li clan crossing the river to seize territory. Jiangbei was currently being roasted over a fire; what benefit was there to be had? What he feared was Li Jiangqian acting out of anger and launching an attack. Any casualties on either side could lead to unpredictable consequences.

‘As for sending the heavily injured Gongsun Bofan to deliver the message… I doubt it was because they lacked manpower. More likely, they’re using his arduous journey back and forth as bait to lure out the escaped demonic disciple… a clever scheme, I suppose.’

‘Thankfully… the Capital immortals Dao still has Guan Gongxiao… a man who knows when to bow his head and can maintain some control. Without him, both our families would be in deep trouble right now.’

He had just turned around when a young man in black robes landed in the hall amidst the downpour. His face was grim as he knelt on one knee.

“Clan Head, the Hall of the Locust Soul has crossed the river.”

Li Jiangqian’s head snapped up. He sighed inwardly.

‘As I expected! Trouble has arrived right on schedule!’

He raised an eyebrow and asked urgently, “How many men? Is Daoist Bai leading them personally?”

Chen Yang’s expression was grave. He nodded. “Daoist Bai is leading them across the river. They are currently in the wilderness!”

# Chapter 856: The Dispute

The Wilderness.

A torrential downpour lashed the land. Layers of dark, heavy clouds from Jiangbei drifted south on the wind, unleashing torrential, waterfall-like floods upon the barren hills.

The low-lying structures on the ground vanished beneath the deluge. A scattering of black, ant-like figures struggled for a moment in the torrent before being swept away. Above, streaks of luminous light tore through the sky, cultivators speeding toward the scene.

The leader of the group was a man in a black robe, his aura exceptionally fierce and his eyes glinting with a sinister chill. Riding on wisps of black energy, he came to a halt on the riverbank, his expression grim. A troop of similarly clad cultivators landed close behind him.

At his waist hung the Abyssal Gloom Medallion, an artifact that pulsed with a hazy yet dazzling brilliance. He gave the floodwaters a heavy, sweeping glance before raising the medallion. As he chanted a few lines of an incantation, the token flared with light.

One of the cultivators behind him called out.

“Hall Master! This is already the edge of the Wilderness! Any further south and we’ll reach Azure Pond!”

The warning from his subordinate only darkened the demonic cultivator’s face. The medallion in his hand trembled as he replied, his voice low and menacing.

“There are no traces of light to the south. He couldn’t have flown this fast. According to the Abyssal Gloom Medallion, he must have come down somewhere in the Wilderness. Find him! The medallion can track his position at every moment. We cannot let him escape!”

The cultivators immediately fanned out. The man known as the Hall Master held the medallion aloft, his predatory gaze scanning the land below. The clamor of the storm was soon pierced by the sound of an argument, and a woman rose on the wind to approach him.

She held a simple gray hoop and possessed a striking beauty that made the Hall Master’s eyes light up.

“So it is Hall Master Bai,” the woman said, her voice gentle. “This humble one is Miaoshui. I wonder what urgent matter requires your esteemed presence in our Wilderness?”

Daoist Bai glanced down and saw that his subordinates were being held back by two mere early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. He knew at once that this woman’s background was not to be trifled with. Suppressing his irritation, he raised an eyebrow.

“The Wilderness are ownerless lands. Who is your master?”

If not for a recent stroke of fortune, a rogue cultivator from the Eastern Sea like Daoist Bai would have been inferior to Miaoshui and would have had to treat her with the utmost respect. Now, however, he could put on the airs of a superior. Miaoshui could only grit her teeth.

“While the Wilderness may be ownerless,” she said, her voice tight, “the various clans nearby, large and small, all branched off from our Moongaze Lake. By both sentiment and reason, they are under our protection.”

“Moongaze Lake?”

A flicker of hesitation crossed Daoist Bai’s mind before he pressed on. “Some days ago, an elder of your esteemed clan was also attacked. Now something major has happened on the White River. I fear it was the same group of people. Let us search together.”

He didn’t wait for Miaoshui’s consent. With a casual wave of his hand, his cultivators began to spread out, ignoring the locals.

Miaoshui’s expression changed drastically. “Hall Master Bai, what is the meaning of this?”

Daoist Bai’s followers were a mob of demonic cultivators, with not a decent one among them. How could she let them run rampant in the Wilderness? But she and her companions were hopelessly outnumbered. Crushing a jade talisman in her hand, she issued a cold warning. “You should think this through, Hall Master Bai. Our clan’s cultivators are on the river. It will take them but a moment to arrive. If this triggers a war between our two houses, it will not end well for anyone!”

‘Cui Jueyin and Ding Weizeng are both busy fighting the Capital immortals Dao,’ Daoist Bai thought dismissively. ‘Can they possibly rush back? We sped here at full tilt; the cultivators on both banks of the river must already be aware of our presence. If Moongaze Lake’s people leave their posts, will the Capital immortals Dao just sit back and watch?’

He offered a few perfunctory excuses, but just then, the western sky flared with the light of Li Fire. Several dazzling rays of light arrived one after another, resolving into figures amidst the clouds. The man in the lead had piercing golden eyes and a face devoid of expression.

“Hall Master Bai,” he said, his voice flat. “What is this?”

Behind him, Chen Yang wore a grim expression. The slightly tardy Li Minggong and Qu Bushi stood discreetly among the clouds, observing the scene.

Seeing Li Jiangqian, Daoist Bai grew even more displeased, though he quickly masked it with a smile. “Patriarch Li, someone killed a Protector in my Hall of the Locust Soul and fled into the Wilderness. I’m merely here to conduct a search…”

Li Jiangqian glanced at the motley crew of demonic cultivators below. “Then you’ve wasted your time,” he said dismissively. “Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are incredibly fast. Whoever was going to leave is long gone. What’s the point of searching now? Surely the Hall Master isn’t using ‘catching a fugitive’ as a pretext for some other crooked scheme.”

The bluntness of the accusation made Daoist Bai’s face turn cold.

The old demonic cultivator had little respect for Li Jiangqian. He cursed him silently. ‘I have inherited a Purple Mansion Daoist tradition! I am destined for the Purple Mansion Realm! In all of Moongaze Lake, only Li Zhouwei has a decent shot at that realm, which puts him on my level. A pipsqueak from a junior generation like you, Li Jiangqian, dares to give me a cold shoulder? You don’t know what’s good for you!’

Through years of unchecked arrogance, he had come to equate his own status with that of a Purple Mansion cultivator. As his face darkened, Chen Yang, hand resting on the hilt of his sword, watched him with a vicious glint in his eyes. His thoughts were surprisingly similar.

‘A cur that got by on a scrap of luck, pushed forward to be a scapegoat, and he dares to oppose my family…’

Li Jiangqian would never cede the Wilderness to Daoist Bai. He stood his ground, his calm gaze fixed on the Hall Master. The atmosphere grew taut, thick with unspoken threats. Just then, another group of cultivators flew in from the east, all clad in golden robes. Their leader was all smiles.

“Hall Master Bai, what brings you to the Wilderness!”

Daoist Bai was somewhat familiar with this newcomer. “Ah, Daoist Tian of Xuanmu,” he said with a smile. “I’m searching for someone. He killed one of my men and is heavily injured. He can’t have gotten far; he must have come down here. He stole something important from me. My men can find him by a tracking art placed on him when he killed my subordinate! I ask that you all give me some leeway…”

“Fine, fine.” The cultivator from the Xuanmu Daoist tradition readily agreed, allowing the demonic cultivators to pass. The Hall of the Locust Soul lacked many things, but not hordes of demonic cultivators, and they swarmed toward the ground below.

The Xuanmu Daoist tradition had once been a demonic path, and its internal affairs were still chaotic. Li Jiangqian knew they would never tell their lower-ranked cultivators about matters concerning a True Monarch. Glancing at the group, he saw, as expected, no direct descendants of the Dai family. They were all minor figures. With Zhu Gong gone north, he could only imagine the tension within the Sacred Writ Gate.

Just as Daoist Tian agreed, a stout man in a golden mask standing beside him spoke up, his voice a low rumble.

“Daoist Master, the Hall of the Locust Soul has countless demonic cultivators. If we let them run free, I fear they will harm the common people of the Wilderness.”

The comment put Daoist Tian in an awkward position. A cold light flashed in his eyes. “Since Fellow Daoist Fu Yuezi has such a compassionate heart,” he said with a tight smile, “why don’t you go along with them and keep an eye on things.”

Fu Yuezi was clearly not thriving under the Sacred Writ Gate’s banner, but the man was nothing if not direct. At the command, he actually descended toward the search party. Qu Bushi recognized him and shot him an indignant look. Li Jiangqian frowned, watching the exchange, a premonition solidifying in his heart.

Seeing Li Jiangqian remained unmoved, Daoist Bai raised his medallion again and performed a quick calculation. A look of urgency flashed across his face. He turned to Li Jiangqian.

“Patriarch Li! I will stop beating around the bush,” he said in a low voice. “What this person stole is of utmost importance to my Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition. I ask Moongaze Lake to grant me this favor. If there are any casualties—a few dead peasants—my house will compensate you with the same number of people!”

To these demonic cultivators from overseas, human lives were nothing more than a quantifiable resource. Understanding dawned on Li Jiangqian. He stood firm in the air, a faint smile on his lips. “Hall Master, you should return the way you came. Forgive me, but I cannot let you pass.”

‘No matter what the Hall of the Locust Soul does,’ he thought, ‘they will never be seen as righteous in the eyes of a True Monarch. And this unknown person who escaped from them could be an invaluable asset. Even if this person is no saint, retreating from the eastern shore just to avoid offending the Hall of the Locust Soul would have a devastating impact on the Li family’s reputation and the entire strategic situation. They’ve brought the fight to our doorstep. We have no choice but to intervene.’

As if anticipating his refusal, Daoist Bai’s eyes grew heavy.

In his view, the Li family was internally vulnerable, with all their capable subordinates dispatched to the north. As long as he could hold back the few people before him and rush into the Wilderness, the Li family would be powerless to stop him. The Wilderness were home only to their vassal clans, not Moongaze Lake itself. Did Li Jiangqian really need to make an enemy of a future Purple Mansion expert over a few mortals? Acting like the Sacred Writ Gate was the only logical choice!

And so, the old man in black feigned politeness as he issued his ultimatum. “Patriarch, you should reconsider. Otherwise, I’m afraid I’ll have to ask your esteemed clan for a pointer or two in a sparring match with my Hall.”

At his command, a burly, wide-eyed man stepped forward. His aura was menacing, but he was covered in the stench of blood and filth, making him less intimidating than he might have been. The Hall Master was confident, but the golden-eyed man before him simply laughed.

“Since the Hall Master has put it that way, please wait just a moment!”

Li Jiangqian took a step forward, rummaged in his storage pouch, and pulled out a golden hammer, showing it to his opponents.

“This…”

Daoist Bai stared, dumbfounded. He never imagined Li Jiangqian would erupt so suddenly. In a blur of motion, the golden hammer swung forward, a torrent of apricot-yellow Li Fire trailing in its wake. It smashed toward the burly man’s face like a bolt of lightning.

“What a piece of trash!” Li Jiangqian sneered.

*BOOM!*

The burly man had no time to react before the hammer smashed into his jaw. A visible spray of blood was instantly incinerated into black smoke by the Li Fire. The immense, apricot-yellow flames flowed over him, brilliantly illuminating the violent downpour.

“Aargh…”

A sharp roar of pain echoed through the night. Sent flying high into the air by the blow, his body engulfed in streaming Li Fire, the man frantically tried to extinguish the flames.

“Li Jiangqian! Are you insane?!” Daoist Bai bellowed, utterly blindsided. One moment, the man was smiling, the next he was swinging a hammer, with no transition between the two! How dare the dignified patriarch of an Immortal Clan, a man of noble blood but with cultivation only at the early Foundation Establishment Realm, be the first to attack? He should have retreated and let his subordinates handle the fighting!

Rage flared in the Hall Master’s heart. He had just raised his hand when a second hammer blow was already upon him. The descending apricot-yellow Li Fire made his innate yin qi boil. His own spirit sword was still at his waist, not yet drawn.

Following the hammer was a wave of True Fire that drifted like feathers. Li Minggong had been watching intently, and her reaction was even faster than Chen Yang’s. Below, the cultivators erupted into an uproar. The members of the Sacred Writ Gate watched, stunned.

‘A fight’s already started? With Li Zhouwei away, Moongaze Lake is already strained dealing with the Capital immortals Dao. Are they really adding the Hall of the Locust Soul to their list of enemies?’

But there was no time for deliberation. As Li Jiangqian swung his second blow, he had already transformed into a streak of fire and retreated. Daoist Bai, seething with rage, found himself suppressed by a continuous assault of True Fire that left him breathless.

“Secret Art of the Locust Shade!” he chanted in his mind.

A wave of dark green light surged from his body. Li Minggong merely frowned, placing the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier before her. She pursed her red lips and, borrowing the power of the spiritual artifact, spat out a sheet of True Fire. She had mastered the Slaughter Jun Gate’s Art of Wondrous Transformations, and this breath of flame, amplified by her Pure Feather Li-Fire and the powerful spiritual artifact, was devastatingly potent.

Daoist Bai’s Locust Shade Ghost technique was not particularly formidable to begin with, and its grade was low. Worse, it was completely countered by her True Fire. The dark green light was instantly reduced to ash, and he was violently pushed back, his face flushing crimson with effort and humiliation.

The battle had barely begun. The demonic cultivators who had started to surround the group froze mid-step, shocked by the scene.

‘Huh?’

‘We’ve never heard that Li Minggong was this powerful…’

For Daoist Bai—the great Hall Master of the Hall of the Locust Soul, the acclaimed successor to the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition, who had been acting with such impunity lately—to be so effortlessly pinned down was the height of humiliation.

Even he was dazed, his face beet red. When he had attacked the Golden Tang Gate, its master, Situ Biao, had already been at the end of his life, with no incredible spiritual artifacts to his name. A simple swarm of demonic cultivators had been enough to overwhelm him. Now, facing a true descendant of an Immortal Clan, his shoddy, third-rate skills were instantly exposed the moment his Locust Shade was touched by True Fire. Her flames were exceptionally fierce, and resisting them was an immense struggle.

The display stunned not only the onlookers, but Li Minggong herself hesitated.

‘Is he really this weak? I’d better not injure or kill him. If the forces in the north are short-handed because of this, it could ruin their plans.’

But Daoist Bai, flustered and enraged, hurriedly raised the Abyssal Gloom Medallion. A ghostly light flared, and a man in heavy armor with an ashen face and ferocious features materialized from the artifact, lunging toward the flames. He radiated an intimidating presence, a Geng Metal Qi mixed with a chilling yin aura, his sparse, graying hair whipping about his head.

Just as he charged, Li Minggong eased the pressure of her attack, allowing the figure to break through the flames. She blocked his advance with a wave of her sleeve, using a surge of True Fire to hold him back. Looking closely at his face, her expression grew complicated.

‘Situ Biao…’

This was the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from the Situ family who had covered the retreat from the Golden Tang Gate. He was also the clan’s current master. Daoist Master Tianhuo had confiscated his spiritual artifact and talismans, forcing him to flee in disgrace. To see him again now, reduced to a spirit bound to another’s weapon…

‘Given his status, and the Golden Tang Gate’s current precarious position, he must have been unable to escape even if he wanted to,’ she thought sadly. ‘He could only sacrifice himself.’

Daoist Bai, however, had not come to fight. Suppressing his fury, he seized the opportunity to ride the wind and dive toward the ground. He had barely moved when a brilliant light flared before him, and another figure materialized in his path.

The man had a sharp jaw, a powerful build, and a fierce warrior’s bearing. Clad in red armor, his body glowed with a fiery scarlet light. He held a long staff, and his eyes, seemingly enhanced by some mystical power, pierced like awls, daunting all who met his gaze.

A wave of danger washed over Daoist Bai, and he skidded to a halt. At the same time, another man appeared on his other side—a gentle, refined scholar holding a scroll, his cultivation equally profound. He raised an eyebrow and looked over.

“I hear Hall Master Bai… wishes to ‘spar’?”

Ding Weizeng, however, was not so polite. He shot the Hall Master a cold glare, leveled his long staff, and pointed it directly between his eyes, as if ready to strike him down at any moment. His tone was as cold as ice.

“Son of a bitch!”

# Chapter 857: The Ghoul Corpse

A furious roar, like a clap of thunder, shook the air. The two demonic cultivators who had rushed forward to assist were stunned by the sound. In the next instant, a staff shimmering with crimson light and a dazzling, illusory aura smashed toward them.

Boom!

The two cultivators were lackeys from the Eastern Sea and were completely outmatched. The one on the left, slightly better equipped, barely managed to summon a shield-shaped Dharma artifact. The staff struck it, and with a hiss, yin energy evaporated and the stain of blood qi dissipated. The artifact let out a piercing hum, and the cultivator spat out a mouthful of blood as he plummeted from the sky like a falling star.

The other cultivator was even weaker and didn't even possess a Dharma artifact, yet he had still charged forward to curry favor. The staff struck him square in the chest, punching a hole the size of a bowl clean through him.

He had only come to make an appearance and never imagined his opponent would be so ferocious. As the crimson light of the Palace-Yang Tiger art washed over him, searing his organs with pain, he abandoned all other thoughts and fled into the distance.

Although the bodies of demonic cultivators were resilient and many parts could be sacrificed, two strikes had been enough to wound two Foundation Establishment Realm experts. Daoist Bai gasped in shock.

'This man is terrifyingly strong!' he thought, his heart pounding. 'Such power… I've heard he's an expert with both long and short weapons, and this is just his staff. The legends of Situ Mo and Li Zhouwei can't be much more than this!'

Terrified, Daoist Bai raised a token in his hand. A black-and-white light instantly enveloped him as he began to chant a rapid incantation, desperate to escape.

Fortunately, Ding Weizeng didn't press the attack. He simply held his staff and watched the two demonic cultivators scramble away, making no move to pursue. Instead, he planted himself firmly in front of the Hall Master of the Hall of the Locust Soul.

'This piece of trash… was actually chosen by a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist tradition!'

Ding Weizeng was a natural warrior, his reputation forged through years of battles in the east and purges in the west. He didn't need more than a single glance from his specialized ocular arts to size up the man before him. He was filled with utter disdain.

He had heard that this Daoist Bai was the successor to the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition and was favored by someone from the Purple Mansion Realm, which granted him a certain status. Otherwise, Ding Weizeng would have smashed him to death with his own staff. To be challenged by such a worthless opponent was a deep insult, and his eyes turned cold.

Cui Jueyin, standing nearby, was far more cautious. His attention wasn't on Daoist Bai, but on Ding Weizeng. He feared that his hot-headed companion would cripple the man in a fit of rage, which would jeopardize their affairs in the north. He kept his hands ready, a Dharma seal poised at his fingertips.

In an instant, Daoist Bai's rage and lingering hope were extinguished. He finally understood the gravity of his situation.

'What in the world is Guan Gongxiao's group doing?' he fumed internally. 'This was a perfect opportunity to humiliate the Li family, and they couldn't even delay them on the river? They just let them through! Useless fools!'

The Palace-Yang Tiger, the Eternal Brightness Steps—either one of these arts could suppress his Locust Shade Ghost. Worse, the Eternal Brightness Steps had a binding effect that now posed a direct threat to his life.

'I need to get some distance!'

As a spell art flashed in his hands, Daoist Bai's figure vanished and reappeared a short distance away. But before he could speak, he saw that the battlefield had descended into a chaotic melee.

The puppet crafted from Situ Biao's body had been formidable in life, but its power had diminished significantly after being refined into a Dharma artifact. While its Geng Metal nature was somewhat resistant to True Fire, the yin energy it possessed became a critical weakness. Restrained by the flames, it couldn't advance an inch. This, in turn, freed up Li Minggong to fend off the demonic cultivators on another flank.

Chen Yang had also drawn his sword. He practiced the Jing Dragon King immortal foundation, a foundation well-known in Jiangnan, and had no trouble tying up several enemies. Qu Bushi and An Siwei were less powerful, managing only to fight to a standstill against cultivators of a similar level.

Meanwhile, Li Jiangqian, cloaked in apricot-yellow flames and wielding a golden hammer, relentlessly pursued the demonic cultivators. Whether he could actually defeat them was beside the point; no one was foolish enough to challenge the head of the Li family, and they all scrambled to get out of his way.

Yet Li Jiangqian was not reckless. Though he appeared to be charging about with abandon, he never strayed far from Cui Jueyin. His sharp eyes scanned the crowd, as if searching for someone.

Soon, his gaze fell upon a young man among the demonic host.

The man was dressed in black robes and had only just reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, but the Dharma light radiating from him was not faint. He stood quietly amidst the other cultivators, taking no part in the battle.

Most of the demonic cultivators had achieved their status in the Eastern Sea; nine out of ten were old men who had relied on blood qi to make a lucky breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment Realm. Their various cultivation techniques had left them grotesque and twisted. In this assembly of freaks and monsters, a handsome, youthful figure was impossible to ignore.

Li Jiangqian didn't approach. He noted the young man standing with his sword, then swiftly retreated, committing the face to memory. A sense of caution rose within him.

'The Hall of the Locust Soul is not as simple as it seems,' he thought. 'I must not get entangled here.'

While Li Jiangqian was probing the enemy lines, Daoist Bai had used his spell arts to create an opening. He surveyed the battlefield, his face turning pale with rage.

Although the Hall of the Locust Soul had superior numbers, their quality was appalling. Devoid of loyalty, they simply milled about, slacking off. As a result, almost no one was descending to conduct the search, and a chill crept into Daoist Bai's heart.

'And on top of that, there's Ding Weizeng and Cui Jueyin. With those two here, it's like sending tigers into a flock of sheep…'

However, the thought of the Abyssal Gloom Medallion he possessed eased his fears. Unless a Purple Mansion Realm master appeared in person, his life was not in danger. The sting of Ding Weizeng's insults and the searing heat from his opponent's Dharma light still burned, so he turned his attention to Cui Jueyin and forced a smile.

"We were merely sparring," he said. "We've already exchanged a move or two. Your clan's Lady Minggong is truly a hidden talent! To think she has cultivated her Dharma Arts to such a profound level!"

Ding Weizeng's face remained a mask of stone, his large hands gripping his staff as if he might bring it crashing down at any moment. Cui Jueyin, however, caught a look from Li Jiangqian and clasped his hands in response.

"The Wilderness have been under my family's protection for generations," he stated calmly. "This is no place for you to search. Your Hall should find another way. If our two families come to blows, I fear it will only benefit those with ulterior motives."

"Indeed!"

Cui Jueyin had offered him an escape. Having witnessed the power of Ding Weizeng's staff, Daoist Bai had become much more compliant. He nodded eagerly, shot one last, resentful glare at the ground below, and turned to leave without another word.

The demonic cultivators below were masters of opportunism. They hadn't dared to fly down during the standoff, and now they scrambled to retreat faster than anyone else, following their leader's lead.

They had only gone a short distance when they ran into the cultivators of the Sacred Writ Gate. Daoist Bai was too ashamed to even look up. As he hurried past, a streak of light shot across the river—a disciple in black robes.

The man was covered in blood and looked utterly defeated. He flew before them and cried out in anguish.

"Hall Master! Esteemed sirs! The treasury in Baiku Prefecture… it's been breached! Someone broke in, and all the treasures and Dharma artifacts we've collected over the years have been stolen!"

"The thief was incredibly stealthy and powerful… With all of you away, your subordinate was powerless to stop him!"

The words struck Daoist Bai like a bolt of lightning. "What?!" he roared in disbelief.

Baiku Prefecture was rich in spirit mines and located near the territories of the Midong clans, making it a vital stronghold. Nearly all of their spiritual resources and Dharma artifacts were stored there, guarded by Protector Black Rat himself, one of their eight great protectors. The news sent a surge of shock and fury through him.

"Black Rat!" he bellowed. "Where in the blazes is that useless creature!"

The man in black shook his head, his voice filled with sorrow. "Reporting to you, sir… Protector Black Rat was the first to notice the intrusion. He and Wang Bakong, the County Governor of Baiku Prefecture, gave chase together. But to their surprise, although the culprit was only at the Qi Refining realm, his escape technique was astonishingly fast. He got away!"

Daoist Bai had just suffered a humiliating defeat, and now he had lost his most valuable treasures. His mood, already foul, plummeted. He was so enraged he saw black spots before his eyes. "Worthless trash!" he cursed. "Two Foundation Establishment cultivators! One at the early stage, the other at the mid-stage, and you let a Qi Refining whelp escape!"

"Do you know who it was?!"

Seeing his master's fury, the man trembled. "He's a rogue cultivator from Baiku Prefecture. He assaulted the young master of the Wang family a while back… but was rescued by Bai Yinzi, another rogue cultivator from the great desert. We never imagined those two would join forces and return… to steal everything…"

Hearing that the culprits were merely two rogue cultivators, Daoist Bai erupted. "Find them!" he shrieked. "Return with me at once! I don't care if we have to tear Baijiang Creek apart stone by stone, we will find those two!"

As he roared, the Abyssal Gloom Medallion at his waist pulsed with a soft, iridescent light that shone brightly even in the pouring rain, its glow captivating and mesmerizing.

When his tirade ended, he turned and saw that while the cultivators around him wore expressions of respect, their eyes burned with a renewed, feverish intensity.

The sight, combined with the memory of his encounter with the Li family, caused his frustration to boil over.

'When we were attacking the Golden Tang Gate and looting their mines, they were all tripping over each other in their eagerness, desperate to strip Situ Biao's corpse bare. They even fought amongst themselves over the spoils. But here in the Wilderness, they stand around like wooden chickens, slow and useless! In front of the Li family, they act like meek little grandsons!'

'And now they hear a Qi Refining cultivator has plundered an entire prefecture's worth of treasure, and their eyes are gleaming. It's obvious they're already plotting how to claim it for themselves!'

This mob of demonic cultivators was nothing but a rabble. They would fight when there was profit to be had, but without it, they would do nothing. They were just local warlords. The so-called eight great protectors weren't the strongest among them, merely the ones closest to him…

Today, Daoist Bai finally decided he could no longer afford to be stingy. "Those few who fought by my side just now," he announced in a cold voice, "return to the Hall with me. You will be handsomely rewarded!"

The three cultivators he indicated were overjoyed. The rest of the disloyal horde, as if on cue, began to moan and wail. Some clutched their arms, others their legs, all claiming to have been injured in the fray.

A few, however, stood silently in the crowd, their expressions unreadable. But their eyes kept darting to the Abyssal Gloom Medallion at Daoist Bai's waist, a mixture of naked greed and deep apprehension in their gaze.

'What could that person have stolen?' they wondered. 'What could possibly make him so desperate that he's willing to offend Moongaze Lake… to ignore a power backed by the Purple Mansion Realm and insist on searching their land?'

***

## The Wilderness

Li Jiangqian watched the last of the demonic cultivators retreat. Below, the various families of the Wilderness stared up at the sky. His golden eyes swept over the landscape as he fell deep into thought.

'This person was rescued by our family after crossing the river, and then a battle breaks out in the Wilderness… I wonder what scheme this is a part of… and whether that powerful figure from the north is involved. In any case, we must handle the situation in the Wilderness with extreme care.'

If it was Lin Feng who had killed Daoist Bai's men and taken something of value, then their family had formed a favorable bond. However, Lin Feng remaining in the Wilderness was not a good thing. The more people who came into contact with him, the greater the trouble it would bring to their family. It was best to keep their distance.

But if it wasn't Lin Feng, and some other power was deliberately sowing chaos, or if it was an agent from across the river, then getting involved was even more dangerous. They would inevitably be dragged into the mire.

As he pondered, the other cultivators gathered around him. Ding Weizeng approached, his face grim. "Family Head, now that this matter is concluded, we must return to the river to provide support. Although the Capital immortals Dao has withdrawn due to issues in the north, we must remain vigilant in case they attempt a reckless crossing!"

Ding Weizeng harbored a deep loathing for the Capital immortals Dao and was always on guard against the north. Li Jiangqian seized the opportunity to agree. "I appreciate you making this trip, Protector Ding. Protector Cui, you will remain here. The situation by the river… will require your watchful eye."

Ding Weizeng departed on the wind. Cui Jueyin then stepped closer and spoke in a low voice, "Family Head, the Hall of the Locust Soul has crossed the river, and everyone saw it. The person we rescued is likely still in the Wilderness. How shall we proceed?"

Li Jiangqian exchanged a glance with Li Minggong. He had no desire to get any more involved than he already was. "Let us proceed with caution," he replied. "We don't know who or what he is. It is best we do not delve too deeply into this matter. Let him remain here, but let us not seek him out. That way, we avoid any potential entanglement. We have already done him a favor, and that is enough."

Cui Jueyin acknowledged the order, and the group departed. Before they reached the lake, they saw Li Xuanxuan standing in the rain, stroking his beard with an anxious expression. He looked as if he had been waiting for a long time. Li Jiangqian quickly relayed the events to him before having Chen Yang escort the old man back.

Soon, he arrived at the main hall. Li Que'wan was waiting inside, silently examining several jade slips in her hands.

Upon seeing Li Jiangqian, an anxious look crossed her face. "How did it go?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head. "It's difficult to say. Daoist Bai is astonishingly inept. Aside from that medallion, he is utterly useless, and the demonic cultivators under his command are a chaotic mess. It's a miracle he has managed to hold things together for two years without a single true confidant."

He took his seat at the head of the hall, his expression turning serious. "However, it confirms one thing: that Abyssal Gloom Medallion is no ordinary artifact. By itself, it is at least an ancient Dharma artifact, and who knows what other measures the Daoist Master who created it left within? For all we know, it could contain one or two Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities to save its owner's life."

"The great powers of the north may not fear it, but if we had pushed him into a corner, he might have unleashed it upon our family, which would have been disastrous. That is why I did not press him too hard and allowed him to withdraw."

Li Que'wan breathed a sigh of relief. "It is best to keep him as far away as possible. With no direct family members currently in the Wilderness, we can let them sort out their own mess."

"Indeed," Li Jiangqian sighed. "I noticed a few capable individuals among his followers. I suspect trouble will find him sooner or later. The man is a walking plague; fighting him would only dirty our hands. It was wise to send him on his way."

After hearing this, Li Que'wan's expression grew worried again. She placed the jade slips on the table. They were dark and appeared to be quite old. "While you were out with the protectors and guest elders, someone arrived from the river," she said softly. "He claimed to have been sent by Li Quantao, who is stationed at Lake Xian. He brought these and wished to ask for the family's counsel."

Li Jiangqian's suspicion was piqued. "What did he say? Where is the messenger now?"

"He is still on the island," Li Que'wan replied, a hint of resignation in her voice. "Li Quantao is guarding Lake Xian, which is close to several river mouths. A few days ago, his men spotted a suspicious group. They detained them for questioning, and to their surprise, the group claimed to be from the Hall of the Locust Soul!"

"Naturally, the guards at Lake Xian didn't believe them. No matter how pathetic the Hall of the Locust Soul is, its members should at least carry identification tokens. So they inspected their storage bags to verify their identities, only to discover that these people practice the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition from Xiaoshi Mountain!"

Li Jiangqian listened, deep in thought. Li Que'wan continued, "Only then did the group realize the trouble they were in. They were brought before Li Quantao and, upon interrogation, revealed that they were all descendants of the lost legacy of Xiaoshi Mountain. They had heard that the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition was experiencing a revival, that someone held a token from a Purple Mansion Realm expert authorizing the establishment of a new Daoist tradition recognized by all the major sects. They had come all this way to pledge their allegiance."

Listening to the story, Li Jiangqian felt that something was amiss. After a long moment of contemplation, he asked, "Could they be the real thing?"

Before Li Ximing had broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, there had been three major powers in Jiangbei: the Floating Cloud, Dense Cloud, and Brahma Cloud. In reality, these were false Daoist traditions established by several Purple Mansion Realm masters as bait to lure out the surviving descendants of Xiaoshi Mountain and locate a hidden treasure. The plan had succeeded, drawing out a few individuals and allowing the Chengyun Gate to acquire what it needed for the subsequent events in the subterranean palace.

As he expected, Li Que'wan nodded, sharing his suspicion. "The Xiaoshi Mountain Daoist tradition was scattered far and wide; there was more than just one or two lost branches. The Chengyun Gate only managed to bait a couple of them. There must be others. It seems the major stir caused by that powerful figure in the north has led these overseas branches to believe the rumors. They genuinely think the Hall of the Locust Soul is the true successor to their Daoist tradition, enjoying the patronage of some great power."

The situation was unexpected, yet perfectly logical. Li Quantao, unaware of the history, had become wary. With Qian Lizi away and unable to contact Ning Wan, he had sent the matter to them at the lake for a decision.

'They managed to remain hidden overseas for so many years without being discovered, only to be caught while crossing Lake Xian,' Li Jiangqian thought with a mix of amusement and annoyance. 'For Li Quantao to stumble into a mess like this, he must be getting in over his head.'

His actions were clearly biased; the seals on the jade slips had been broken, meaning anyone could read them. Adding them to the family library would be a gain. But these people had traveled thousands of miles from overseas. What role did they play in the grander scheme of things? Now was not the time to get involved with such unknown factors.

Nearby, Li Minggong picked up one of the jade slips. "Does the Old Master know about this?" she asked quietly.

Li Que'wan seemed puzzled by the question. "The old master was waiting for you all to return outside the lake," she said hesitantly. "So, he doesn't know yet."

Li Jiangqian, however, understood Li Minggong's meaning. The old master already felt a great deal of guilt over the Ning family's manipulation of Li Quantao in their scheme to acquire the Hongxue inheritance. With the Daoist Master now missing and in increasing danger each day, the fact that Li Quantao was still focused on Moongaze would surely sadden him.

He paced back and forth in the hall for a few moments. "What of these cultivation techniques?" he asked.

Li Que'wan's expression was complex. "Most of them are techniques we already possess. However, there is one that is… interesting. It's called the *Huai River Ghost Yin Refining Art*. It uses a cultivator's remains to craft a Dharma artifact. The spell must be cast before the moment of death to preserve the corpse and prevent it from dissolving into spiritual energy. It is a highly sophisticated art, but… it has very specific requirements for one's immortal foundation."

She slid one of the jade slips forward for them to see. "Not just anyone can refine this type of artifact, and an individual can only ever refine one. The finished product is called a Ghoul Corpse. It is best refined by a cultivator of the 'Hurricane Ghost Yin'. Failing that, the next best options are 'Upper Shaman', 'Xiukui', and 'Baleful Qi'. At the very least, one must be from the Ancient Merging Dao Lineage… Most others have no chance of success."

Li Minggong took the slip and glanced at it. Se didn't even need to read it; the description alone was enough. "It sounds thoroughly sinister. This must be the technique Daoist Bai used to refine Situ Biao…"

Li Que'wan nodded gravely. Seeing the look of understanding dawn on Li Jiangqian's face, she continued her deduction, "This proves, at the very least, that Daoist Bai is not entirely without resources. He must possess a number of authentic Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition techniques. The question is, where did he get them?"

Li Jiangqian nodded. "He did annihilate the Brahma Cloud Cave. It's possible he acquired them then. After all, his pretext was that Pingwang Zi was refining infants and had defiled the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition, and that he was merely dispensing justice… it could very well be some kind of demonic art…"

"But what if he didn't get them from the Brahma Cloud Cave…"

Li Minggong thought back for a moment. "I saw Situ Biao's Ghoul Corpse emerge from the Abyssal Gloom Medallion ," she said in a low voice. "Either that artifact is capable of storing such an item, or the Dharma Art itself comes from the Abyssal Gloom Medallion !"

Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan both suspected the latter. Li Jiangqian paused, ensuring no Purple Mansion Realm masters were eavesdropping, before speaking in a grave tone. "If the art truly comes from the medallion, then Purple Smoke Gate must possess a significant collection of Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition techniques. This whole affair, this artifact… it might not have been a hastily contrived plan based on my words, but a meticulous, long-term plot. My casual mention of the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition played right into their hands."

"When you think about it, it's not so strange. The most renowned tradition in Jiangbei is the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition. It has been built up by various Purple Mansion Realm masters over the years. From Foundation Establishment cultivators down to the mortals in the street, everyone knows the name of Xiaoshi Mountain. Even if I hadn't been the one to mention it, anyone looking to raise a banner in Jiangbei would have thought of Secret Diffusion. Only Secret Diffusion has that kind of credibility!"

He lowered his voice further. "In other words… it's likely a consensus was reached on this long ago. It was always going to be Secret Diffusion. Qian Lizi mentioned that each time they arrive, new secret realms and grotto-heavens are left behind. Perhaps this time, it will be the Secret Diffusion secret realm that descends…"

His voice grew deeper, heavy with implication. "In that case… could it be that the Abyssal Gloom Medallion is not some temporary, counterfeit item… but a genuine, paramount treasure capable of opening the lost treasury of the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition!"

Li Que'wan's expression grew taut. Her eyes met Li Jiangqian's, and in that shared glance, four words surfaced in both their minds:

'An Immortal Mirror fragment!'

# Chapter 858: Old Enemies

Years ago, the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven had been thrown into turmoil by Chu Yi, causing it to fall from the Great Void. Countless spirit items and artifacts rained down into the mountains below, flooding the entire Eastern Li Mountain range with a surge of spiritual energy that nourished a generation of cultivators.

The Three Sects and Seven Gates of Jiangnan had profited immensely. The fortunate ones made a fortune, while even the lesser powers managed to get a taste. Daoist Master Qiushui and Daoist Master Yuansu, who had overseen the affair, had undoubtedly acquired an untold number of treasures...

Now, with another grotto-heaven emerging, the Li family had to secure the specific spirit sword they sought. It was a prize they absolutely could not afford to lose. If it came down to it, they would have to cross the river and seize it by force.

'But that won't be easy...'

If Daoist Master Tinglan didn't return soon, there would be no one to command the situation. How could the powers of Jiangbei simply allow the Three Sects and Seven Gates to come and go as they pleased? Even if she did return, her authority couldn't compare to that of Qiushui and Yuansu from Li Jiangqun's era. Qiushui, in particular, had the backing of a Golden Core cultivator. Back then, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had been able to pour into the region, carve out territories, and plunder the grotto-heaven at will.

This thought only deepened his anxiety.

If Daoist Master Tinglan *could* replicate the feats of Yuansu and Qiushui, the chances of the sword falling into the Li family’s hands were slim, though they might be able to trade for it later. But if she lost control of Jiangbei entirely, then who would claim the grotto-heaven’s treasures? The whole situation would dissolve into chaos.

Li Jiangqian picked up several jade slips, ordering someone to make copies and send them to the clan.

Li Que'wan reminded him, "With Daoist Master Tinglan and Daoist Master Qiuhu absent, we still need to answer Li Quantao's query. He has always been a friend to our family. We should try... try to help him if we can."

Li Jiangqian glanced at Li Minggong, who nodded in agreement. "You're right," he conceded. "We have a long-standing relationship. Why don't we reply like this... Advise him to let his people proceed, but tell him the Daoist Masters have not been seen, and that Jiangbei may be on the verge of upheaval. He should watch his words and act with extreme caution."

Naturally, Li Jiangqian had no intention of revealing too much. Before the others could respond, he added, "Did Li Quantao mention that son of his?"

"No," Li Que'wan replied. "Since entering Jiangbei, the young man has been like a stone tossed into the sea, causing not a single ripple. We haven't received any letters from him, though we know his life jade is still intact."

Li Jiangqian listened as he finished writing the letter. "Then it's best not to say more. Let this be our response. Tell him that with the prestige of Azure Pond backing him, the factions in Jiangbei won't dare harm his son. He can rest assured."

Li Minggong, having waited patiently, finally spoke. "I heard something interesting. The former emperor of the northern Eastern Yue, a man named Dili Youjie, came to the lake recently. He said he's preparing to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and hopes to receive the lake's blessing."

"Dili Youjie?" Li Jiangqian frowned. The name was vaguely familiar. "I remember him. He sat on the throne of the northern Eastern Yue for many years to reach this point. His junior, Dili Guang, still serves beside Uncle Zhouluo, a loyal servant. What cultivation art does he practice?"

"The Geng Metal Art."

Li Minggong smiled. "He made some preparations for his technique. It’s crude, but it shows he's put some thought into it, as there are compatible arts within the clan he could switch to. I plan to take him to the clan repository, help him change his cultivation art, and then send him into seclusion."

Li Jiangqian nodded his approval.

"Also," Li Minggong said softly, "I hear the clan's project, the Thirty-two Prefecture Purple-Broad Spirit Needles, is nearing completion. I came to ask you about it."

"I know," Li Jiangqian said with a shake of his head. He had been overseeing the project and knew the details better than anyone. "It is indeed almost finished. The cost of this Purple Mansion Realm formation has been staggering, the largest drain on our inventory in a century. It's nearly depleted our entire stock of related spiritual materials and even drove up the price of such resources across Yuebei by half a percent. We even had to provide a substantial amount of spirit rice to the Purple Smoke Gate as part of the deal."

The Li family's system was different from other clans, making their spirit rice production among the highest of the Purple Mansion Realm powers in the Yue State. But a surplus of spirit rice wasn't particularly valuable, so it was clear the Purple Smoke Gate was doing them a favor.

"The next step is to have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator set up the formation. But with Daoist Master Tinglan missing... and even if she weren't, with her not yet having returned, we can't risk letting an outsider set up the formation alone. We'll likely have to wait two years."

Li Minggong nodded. "The formation isn't urgent. The priority is to finish the project and send the people from the Purple Smoke Gate on their way. The north and south are in turmoil, and the incident with Daoist Cao set a precedent. If more people start coming to the lake to recruit disciples, it will only lead to trouble."

With that, Li Minggong departed, leaving Li Jiangqian to sigh. "The elders have cultivated a fierce spirit over the years. Forged in the conflict between north and south, they've only grown more formidable."

While Li Minggong wasn't as exceptional as Li Chenghui, her cultivation had deepened with age, making her qualified to be a peak master in the Three Sects and Seven Gates. Li Que'wan agreed, then added, "Jiangliang is getting older. It might be time for him to return and visit Qingdu and Yuting. He should make the rounds and prove his worth."

Li Jiangqian nodded thoughtfully but didn't issue any immediate orders. He dismissed her and paced the grand hall alone, gazing north at the dark clouds from which the heavy rain still fell.

'If the Abyssal Gloom Medallion truly was Daoist Master Tinglan's design... which faction is it that doesn't want the Supreme Yang Dao to benefit?'

He strode forward, only to see the rain clouds overhead thicken. A streak of light shot from the distance and landed on the island. Soon, hurried footsteps approached. Chen Yang, clad in black armor, stopped before him and bowed. "Clan Head, a message has arrived from Azure Pond Sect. An elder from the Hengzhu Immortal Dao has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, manifested a divine ability, and taken the Daoist title 'Nanzun'."

"The Hengzhu Immortal Dao?" Li Jiangqian was momentarily stunned, a hint of regret in his voice. "From which generation is he?"

Chen Yang hesitated slightly. "It is said this Daoist Master spent nearly thirty years achieving his breakthrough. However, his seniority is quite high, close to that of Daoist Master Hengxing. His secular name is Bi Chengjuan."

"Bi Chengjuan... I've never heard of him." Li Jiangqian nodded slowly. The name was indeed unfamiliar. "Whether it's the power of their blessed land or some other method, the Hengzhu Immortal Dao is truly fortunate to have added another Purple Mansion Realm expert. It seems they are poised to become the leading Daoist tradition in the Yue State."

He sighed again. "It's just a shame... that Daoist tradition is so eccentric, so incompatible with others. And their feud with the Golden Feather Sect... I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing."

After a moment of thought, he gave his orders. "Propriety demands we send someone to offer congratulations. Also, send a reply to Azure Pond Sect. Inform them that Daoist Master Qiuhu has not manifested her power in a long time, and ask if they can contact her to give Dantai Jin a warning."

***

**Xiaoshi Mountain**

The peaks of Xiaoshi Mountain rose and fell, their slopes sparse and desolate. The rare, torrential downpour only made the landscape seem more bleak as pale yellow rainwater carved channels down the mountainside, washing away what little soil remained. The runoff flowed down into the tributaries of the ancient Huai River, eventually emptying into Baijiang Creek.

Amidst the downpour, the iridescent lights of several divine abilities shimmered within the dark clouds. A man in brown robes stood in the heavy night sky, his eyes a pale grey. With his hands clasped behind his back, he trod upon an ebony aura of power, his gaze sweeping across the mountain below.

Xiaoshi Mountain was once the seat of the Secret Diffusion Sect and the origin of their Daoist tradition. Though it had been occupied by Buddhist cultivators for a time, the crumbling ruins still held an ancient, sorrowful beauty, made all the more poignant by the storm.

After a brief survey, the man brought his hands together before his chest and blew out a stream of dark yellow light that spread across the area. He then focused, channeling his divine ability as if searching for something.

A step behind him stood a woman in red robes. Her face was youthful, and she held her head slightly bowed in a gesture of respect. "Lord Kui Qi," she whispered, "have you found anything?"

The woman was, of course, Daoist Master Zhu Gong. Hailing from the overseas territories, she was a cultivator of Earth Virtue and had once been branded a demonic practitioner. Before a cultivator of the Supreme Yang Dao, she was naturally deferential.

The brown-robed man, his features resolute, kept his eyes fixed on the mountain. "I can't find them," he said, shaking his head. "We'll wait. In any case, the Northern Buddhists can't escape responsibility... and it's not just one of their temples."

Zhu Gong's face filled with dread. She knew this was about the Qi Wang Profound-Heaven Hearing. "What should we do?" she whispered, her voice trembling. "If it really is the Vija, how can two early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators like us possibly stand against them? If something goes wrong, the consequences will be catastrophic..."

"Them?" Daoist Master Kui Qi was far calmer, even frowning with a hint of annoyance. It was clear he held little regard for Zhu Gong and was only being civil for Daoist Master Tinglan's sake. But the situation was critical, so he maintained a patient tone. "It's not just the Vija. They couldn't have done this alone. Back when Senior Zipei seized the Metallic Essence, she took it from the hands of numerous monks, deeply offending a senior Maha named Zhelu. He's already at the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm!"

He continued, "I wasn't present at the time, so I don't know which other temples were involved. If they all act together, that's when we'll have real trouble."

Hearing this, Zhu Gong's heart sank further into despair.

'This Kui Qi may act polite,' she thought, 'but deep down, he has the same arrogance as the rest of the Supreme Yang Dao. He clearly looks down on me. Getting too close to him will lead to no good end!'

She remained wary, but her resolve to rescue Tinglan was unshaken. For now, she had no choice but to follow him.

Kui Qi, sensing her unease, said, "Don't worry too much. Now that we're here, they can't hide for long. At worst, Tinglan and Ning Wan will suffer some minor injuries. These Buddhist cultivators all have their own agendas; they won't risk an open war with our Supreme Yang Dao. Besides, those two are carrying more than enough treasures to protect themselves."

Zhu Gong let out a heavy sigh of relief. Just then, Kui Qi released the glow from his hands as if dispelling some concealment, and began performing divinations with his fingers.

But at that exact moment, the storm abruptly ceased. The sky erupted in a kaleidoscope of light, which coalesced into a colossal curtain that pressed down with overwhelming might. Daoist Master Kui Qi reacted instantly, abandoning his calculations as a bronze sword flew from his sleeve.

The sword, the color of tarnished steel and adorned with a golden tassel, shot skyward, swift as a swallow, to meet the descending light.

**BOOM!**

The collision of ebony and iridescent light lit up the heavens, shattering the surrounding storm clouds. Kui Qi's voice turned to ice. "Which Maha dares to show themselves?"

A rainbow-like blessed land materialized in the sky. Within it sat a solemn, golden-bodied figure. A black serpent was coiled around its body, and atop its shoulders sat a long, horse-like head. Its two large, round eyes were pitch-black voids. It opened its great mouth in a wide grin.

"Daoist Friend Kui Qi! I have long heard of your great name!"

The Maha was hideously ugly. While his appearance might terrify mortals, to a cultivator of the same level, it was merely grotesque. Daoist Master Kui Qi's expression grew even colder with disgust. "So, it is the Maha Taixi. Instead of staying in your wretched hole, have you come to obstruct me?"

The Maha Taixi’s smile didn't waver. "Having heard of your fame for so long, I thought we might spar. Shall we see if your Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword is sharper, or if my Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl is superior?"

As his words fell, a large, smooth-surfaced purple bowl appeared, rimmed in purplish-black. It immediately began to spew forth raging waves of karmic fire.

"Taixi!"

While Kui Qi was well-informed, Zhu Gong had spent most of her years in the Eastern Sea and was unfamiliar with these Buddhist cultivators. Only now, upon seeing the iconic artifact, did she recognize their opponent and finally piece everything together.

'So, another enemy made by Daoist Master Zipei! All those years ago on the river, she deliberately prevented them from claiming a soul's destiny, forcefully protecting that Li Xuanfeng. They lost several Master Monks and a great deal of face. This Maha has held that grudge ever since...'

'That great Daoist Master was too tyrannical in her later years, making far too many enemies. Now that she has passed on, the retribution has arrived!'

A chill ran down her spine. But she saw Kui Qi let out a cold laugh as he drew his sword, unleashing a wave of dark light. His divine ability flared in mid-air. "You dare compare that shoddy Treasured Artifact of yours to a spiritual artifact from my Xiukui Daoist tradition? Let's put it to the test!"

The Xiukui's Daoist tradition was known for its strange and unpredictable methods. Armed with multiple spiritual artifacts, Kui Qi had no fear of this newly advanced Maha. He was even confident he could injure Taixi before resuming his search for Tinglan.

He might be fearless, but Zhu Gong's scalp tingled with terror. She didn't know whether to stay or flee. Before she could decide, figures began to materialize on either side of them, wreathed in white mist. Enormous, three-headed, six-armed golden bodies with countless faces appeared one after another, their arrival heralded by the chanting of Sanskrit.

It was the host of Maha Taixi's Merciful Ones!

These Merciful Ones were not as massive as the golden body in the sky, but each had a unique expression as they emerged from the Great Void, one after another.

"One, two... four, five..."

Five Merciful Ones!

Maha Taixi had only recently advanced. These five were likely the entirety of his forces. For him to deploy all of them now spoke volumes of the hatred in his heart.

And five Merciful Ones, acting in concert, were more than enough to threaten her life.

Zhu Gong stood frozen, staring as the five figures appeared around them. Her face showed none of Kui Qi's bravado, only utter despair as a profound chill washed over her.

'It's over!'



# Chapter 859: Retreat

Five Merciful Ones. That was a formation designed to handle a late-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert. With good coordination, they could stall a Great Daoist Master for a short time, let alone a mere early-stage cultivator like her.

She had no choice but to summon her Divine Ability. Two spots of brownish-yellow light bloomed beneath her feet. She pressed her palms together about a fist's length from her chest, lifted her head, and recited an incantation in her heart:

'Earth of the high scorch, turn to the Wu Light! Reveal the ultimate earth, birth metal and yang!'

In that single instant, a hazy, deep brown radiance rippled out from her body, as thick and steady as the earth itself. It spread out on both sides, enveloping her completely.

The moment the incantation finished in her mind, the five different artifacts of the surrounding Merciful Ones struck the Wu Light in unison. A violent, muffled boom echoed through the clouds. Zhu Gong’s expression shifted; the strain was obvious.

Although the Earth Virtue was formidable, her Wu Earth was not as indestructible as the fabled Manifestations Earth, which could withstand even lightning. Worse, her path to cultivation had been unorthodox; her Wu Earth was impure, tainted by the methods of demonic cultivators.

Under the combined assault of five Buddhist cultivators, the light shield flickered unstably, and faint wisps of dark, abyssal energy began to seep out. Two of the Merciful Ones glared, their eyes wide with fury. One spat a stream of golden sand while the other unleashed a torrent of fire, both crashing down upon the shimmering barrier.

'Damn it!'

She had no experience fighting the Northern Buddhists. Forced to activate her Divine Ability again, her eyes glowed with a kaleidoscopic light. She held one hand to her chest and covered her mouth with the back of the other. Taking a short breath, she shouted:

"Begone!"

The flame-wielding Merciful One beside her had no time to react. He cried out in pain and collapsed, clutching his face like a common mortal. A flaw had appeared in their encirclement. Seizing the opportunity, Zhu Gong channeled her Divine Ability once more, her body dissolving into a streak of light as she broke through their lines.

The Merciful One who had been struck by her spell art remained kneeling on the ground, blood pouring from his golden lips in a panicked flow. But the sand-spitting Merciful One remained composed, his experience showing. He drew his sword and rose, calling out a reminder.

"That was the 'Subjugating Crest' of Wu Earth! Take to the air and do not touch the ground! We are Buddhist cultivators, so the pain is amplified. As long as you don't panic, the wound is not that severe!"

The one who spoke was clearly their leader, his status higher than the others. The injured Merciful One gritted his teeth against the pain and flew into the air as instructed, and sure enough, he felt some relief. Not far away, Zhu Gong’s face was grim. As she prepared another Dharma Art, she cursed inwardly.

'That bald-headed donkey is sharp…'

Zhu Gong had stumbled upon a Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition by chance. The technique she cultivated was indeed the 'Subjugating Crest'. However, due to her ignorant and undisciplined youth, her cultivation was a mix of impurities. Though she had switched techniques before reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, hidden dangers remained. The 'Subjugating Crest' had been instrumental in her repeated victories against stronger foes. To have it seen through so easily was like losing an arm. A Dharma Art flared in her hand.

"Bald donkey! Try this one!" she roared.

She coughed violently, spitting out a mouthful of blood. From between her crimson lips, a globe of Wu Light, tinged with a colorful, hazy mist, shot toward the flame-spitting Merciful One she had just injured. It shrieked through the air. The other two Merciful Ones nearby cried out in alarm and rushed to intercept it.

But Zhu Gong’s shout was a deliberate feint, a classic misdirection. The moment the Wu Light reached them, it dissolved into harmless, colorful mist. At the same time, a tremor ran through the Great Void, and the true attack—a treasure-yellow beam of Wu Light—shot out like a venomous snake, biting at the back of the lead Merciful One's head.

'I have to take him out first! If I can't break one of their fingers, they'll surround and kill me!'

She knew full well she was no match for the five of them together. Her current advantage came from possessing one more Divine Ability than her opponents, a fleeting upper hand. Thus, her strike was utterly ruthless, born of a kill-or-be-killed desperation. A small silver bell materialized in the sky, following the Wu Light in its descent.

For a moment, three of the Merciful Ones were occupied. The leader had no choice but to raise his golden sword and face the treasure-yellow Wu Light head-on. "Hold!" he bellowed.

The sky filled with a brilliant radiance as a phantasm of the Buddhist Land appeared. Layers of treasure light, like countless veils of shimmering gauze, drifted down, attempting to smother the Wu Light with a sizzling sound.

*BOOM!*

But the Wu Light was like a burning coal dropped into a pile of cotton. It tore through the layers of resistance and finally slammed into the Merciful One's Dharma Body. A heart-wrenching scream tore from his lips. The silver bell followed close behind, about to strike him down. But with a final act of defiance, the Merciful One forced his eyes open. Ignoring the gaping holes the Wu Light was boring through his Dharma Body, he clenched his steel-like teeth and caught the silver bell in his mouth.

Trapping a spiritual artifact in one's mouth could only end in disaster. Not even a cultivator with a Body Divine Ability would dare such a thing, let alone a Merciful One. As expected, his eyes instantly exploded into a shower of golden dust, and countless dark-gold cracks spiderwebbed across his Dharma Body.

Seeing this, Zhu Gong felt no joy, only a surge of shock and rage.

The last of the Merciful Ones, who had vanished moments before, had traversed the Great Void. He now appeared behind her, wielding two golden hammers. His three-headed, six-armed Dharma Body simultaneously produced two mirrors and a pair of wooden fish, locking her down from all sides.

'So fast! What a powerful Dharma Body!'

Only then did the Daoist Master realize that this silent attacker was the true combat expert of the group. But her own spiritual artifacts were still deployed, and she couldn't recall them in time. She had no choice but to draw her Dharma Sword and fling a spirit shield from her sleeve to defend herself.

*CLANG!*

Zhu Gong’s spell arts were decent, but her other abilities were clearly lacking. The two spirit shields struggled in the air, emitting plumes of black smoke. As blood-refined artifacts, they were naturally suppressed by the dharma light of the Buddhist cultivators. The shields failed to block the attack completely. The two mirrors unleashed a dazzling golden radiance that shot directly into her eyes.

The 'Subjugating Crest' was a pure spell-based Divine Ability; unlike 'Audience with the Celestial Gate', it offered no enhancement to one’s physical body. How could Zhu Gong’s eyes withstand such a blast? Sparks flew, and in an instant, her eyes were reduced to blackened, smoldering sockets, from which two streams of scorched blood trickled down.

At the same moment, the silver bell burst from the lead Merciful One’s abdomen, blowing him into a cloud of fragments that rained down as golden sand.

*BOOM!*

'Trapping a spiritual artifact with his body... his end was even worse than mine would have been! To think he just returned to the Buddhist Land like that!'

The four remaining Merciful Ones showed not anger, but joy. They swiftly broke through the Great Void and completed their encirclement.

Zhu Gong had rarely fought against the Northern Buddhists, but these five Merciful Ones knew exactly how to deal with cultivators of the Immortal Dao. From the very start of the battle, they had shared a tacit understanding: trade a life for an injury.

Their positions as Merciful Ones were granted by the Buddhist Land. If they died, they died in service to Taixi. They would be compensated with new Dharma Bodies after death. But what about Zhu Gong? How many second chances did she have? A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's Dharma Body was not as critical as it was in the Foundation Establishment Realm, but a major injury sustained in battle could take a year and a half to recover from, if not longer.

As soon as the four closed in, they began chanting scriptures in unison. The sacred words resonated with the lingering power in her eye sockets, causing bursts of golden fire to erupt from the wounds, exploiting the weakness of her Dharma Body to continuously disrupt her.

Zhu Gong finally understood their strategy. A chill ran down her spine. She was now completely surrounded. The piercing pain from her eyes was making it difficult to cast her spell arts, warning her with every throb.

'If I don't leave now, I might never be able to!'

She forced herself to weave another Dharma Art, creating a shield of light around herself that barely held back the four-pronged assault. Her spiritual sense soared upward, seeking out the battle between Maha Taixi and Daoist Master Kui Qi high above.

The Daoist Master from Xiukui, still clad in black with one hand behind his back, looked composed. His Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword danced and flickered, weaving through a myriad of illusions amidst an endless sea of colorful light. Meanwhile, Maha Taixi's renowned Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl was pinned in mid-air by a black cord. Though it struggled to break free, it was always a fraction too slow, completely neutralized.

Daoist Master Kui Qi’s free hand conjured a point of dark light, from which streams of brilliance shot out, layering attack after attack upon Taixi. The horse-faced Maha was besieged by both the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword and the dark light, barely managing a stalemate with his powerful Dharma Body.

It was clear that, compared to her own desperate struggle, Daoist Master Kui Qi was not finding his fight with Taixi difficult at all. Zhu Gong’s anxiety mounted. The longer she held on, the more her confidence waned. As her spiritual energy dwindled and new injuries accumulated on her Dharma Body, she finally caught Daoist Master Kui Qi’s eye.

The Daoist Master saw her plight but showed no surprise. The three Divine Abilities in his hand continued to flow, and his spell arts grew even stronger, slowly forcing a grim expression onto Taixi’s face.

'Daoist friend Zhu Gong! Hold on for just another quarter of an hour, until I can unleash my Divine Ability!' a message entered her mind.

Zhu Gong’s heart sank. Before she could even reply to Kui Qi, the light shield around her dimmed drastically. The Merciful One who had blinded her with the mirrors spread his six arms, his eyes glowing crimson-gold as he activated some secret technique.

Sure enough, after just a few more exchanges, the golden fire in her eye sockets blazed more intensely. With a muffled crack, her defensive barrier shattered into pieces. Zhu Gong gathered her breath one last time, her Divine Ability surging.

"Begone!"

This time, being so close, the shout hit all four of them at once, causing them to collectively falter. The six-armed Merciful One, who was the closest, had golden blood stream from his nose. His eyes widened in rage as he charged again. Zhu Gong’s silver bell flew out to intercept him, but the other three were already upon her.

The burning golden light in her eye sockets and the inherent fragility of her Dharma Body were now glaring weaknesses. The 'Subjugating Crest' was a Divine Ability that excelled in single combat, not group battles. She was completely overwhelmed. She coughed up another mouthful of blood, which dissipated into a shower of golden light.

But what Zhu Gong could never have anticipated was that at this critical moment, a richly patterned demon-subduing lotus staff, glowing with a brilliant golden light, would pierce through the Great Void and strike her undefended back.

*BOOM!*

A massive cloud of mist exploded in the sky, accompanied by the sound of a landslide. The rain dissipated, replaced by a sky full of shattered rock and sand. Zhu Gong reappeared some distance away, her face deathly pale, her form coalescing from a cluster of golden light. A gaping hole in her chest offered a clear view of the scenery behind her—a void in the perfect shape of a lotus flower.

'Taixi! How is that possible!?'

The demon-subduing lotus showed her no mercy. The brilliant gold Treasured Artifact, far more formidable than the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl, instantly broke apart into a storm of razor-sharp petals that descended upon her Dharma Body.

"Hmph!"

Finally, a black cord shot out of the Great Void, blocking the majority of the lotus petals. It then released a dense black light that bound the treasure light hiding within the void. Even so, Zhu Gong was struck by three or five petals. Overwhelmed by dizziness, she coughed up another mouthful of blood.

An endless white mist fell over Taixi, trapping him. Daoist Master Kui Qi had clearly been forced to unleash his technique prematurely. He materialized in front of Zhu Gong, the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword pointed forward, startling the Merciful Ones into retreat.

His gloomy gaze fell upon the dark-gold demon-subduing lotus, and a name surfaced in his mind.

'Zhelu! This is the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions…'

Meanwhile, Zhu Gong, finally given a moment's respite, ignored everything else. The gaping wound on her chest rapidly regenerated flesh and skin as she plunged into the Great Void and vanished without a trace.

High above, Taixi wore a broad, triumphant smile, clearly in an excellent mood. "Daoist friend Kui Qi! You were still one step behind me!"

Daoist Master Kui Qi’s expression was thunderous. He swept his gaze over the assembled monks and nuns, said nothing more, and his face grew cold with disappointment. He, too, stepped into the Great Void and disappeared.

"Haha!"

The horse-faced Maha descended from the sky, immensely pleased with himself. The four remaining Merciful Ones fell to their knees in unison, shouting, "Congratulations, my lord! Felicitations, my lord!"

Taixi’s triumphant expression slowly morphed into a cold, grim look. He glanced at the spot where one of his Merciful Ones had died—a veteran, at that—and felt a pang of regret. "Years of hatred have been partially repaid today," he muttered. "If I weren't wary of that missing old monster from the Purple Smoke Gate, and if I weren't afraid that acting too rashly would provoke the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition into using some ultimate trump card in retaliation… this wouldn't have been so troublesome!"

He slowly suppressed the hatred in his eyes and looked down at the dark-gold, intricately patterned lotus in his palm. His expression was a mixture of greed and regret.

'A pity… such a fine Treasured Artifact, and it isn't even mine.'

"Let's go! Follow me back!"

***

In the Great Void.

Daoist Master Kui Qi strode through the emptiness, his Divine Ability propelling him forward, his face a mask of fury.

After suffering such a grievous wound, Zhu Gong would certainly not show herself again. He and she had no relationship to speak of; she would never expose her heavily injured self to anyone, not even to the man who had just saved her.

This meant that even trying to reason with the Daoist Master from the Eastern Sea was now impossible, which only deepened Kui Qi's gloom. He ground his teeth in frustration.

'The 'Subjugating Crest' is a technique that puts her on par with any Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but all its abilities are geared toward individuals. It's incredibly powerful in a one-on-one fight, but she hasn't mastered it. It’s no surprise she ended up like this against a group of Merciful Ones… but the sudden appearance of that Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions was also a factor!'

As a Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery, Kui Qi naturally knew what kind of Daoist tradition the 'Subjugating Crest' belonged to. The Monastery itself possessed the immortal foundation for it. Kui Qi probably understood her Divine Ability better than Zhu Gong herself!

"Such a fine Immortal Dao Divine Ability, and she trained it into such a mismatched mess… It seems she obtained an incomplete Daoist tradition… How could a Daoist tradition of Wu Earth be so easy to come by?"

After observing her for just a short while, Kui Qi could already deduce the origin of her Divine Ability. He sighed inwardly.

'It looks like a substitute path, not the orthodox one. But a Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition is so powerful that even a narrow path is a highway to the heavens in this age, allowing her to reach the Purple Mansion Realm.'

His expression soon grew heavy. He pinched his fingers together, performing a quick divination, and his eyes narrowed.

"Zhelu is still just testing the waters. He might not dare to push Tinglan and Ning Wan to the brink… But allowing them to be trapped in the north, without enough manpower to make the enemy pay or to reclaim our honor… This would be a great blow to the prestige of the Supreme Yang Dao, and it would only make the Northern Buddhists more arrogant…"

Tinglan and Ning Wan both had plenty of trump cards, but Buddhist cultivators excelled at trapping people with formations. If one was careless enough to fall into their trap, escape was difficult. Daoist Master Kui Qi wasn't truly afraid for their lives; he was afraid this was a deliberate ploy to humiliate the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition.

'I absolutely cannot let this go! The other cultivators are unwilling to interfere in Jiangbei's affairs, but that doesn't mean you Buddhist cultivators can plot against us as you please…'

'It's a shame about Hengzhu. He's still resentful over what happened back then and has grown disillusioned. He refuses to get involved in these matters anymore… Otherwise, we wouldn't be in such a sorry state!'

'The Chen Clan has always been amicable; persuading them shouldn't be difficult. Old Master Yuming is also reasonable, and Daoist Master Shanbai by the coast is on good terms with my sect. They are all reliable. Daoist friend Lingmei is also very likely to lend a hand. If he makes a move, the matter is halfway settled. As long as we can break through Taixi's blockade, Zhelu, though powerful, cannot withstand an attack from both within and without.'

With the reputation of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the relationships they had built over many years, a call to arms against the notorious Zhelu would surely rally many Daoist Masters to their cause.

"But there is one problem. Daoist Masters Yuming and Shanbai are both near Cultivation Transcendence, which was once under the Northern Sect's jurisdiction. The relationship has been awkward for a long time. With the Monarch having gone beyond the heavens and the Yue Cultivating Sect sealing their mountains, it's probably inconvenient for the two of them to travel."

When Daoist Master Kui Qi mentioned Cultivation Transcendence, his tone was complicated—a mix of intimacy and awkwardness. And when he mentioned that True Monarch of the Yue Cultivating Sect, his use of the word "Monarch" was filled with profound respect.

But the Great Void was silent and empty. The thought passed in an instant, and Daoist Master Kui Qi's mind turned to Daoist Master Zhaojing from the lake.

"And of all times, he had to be absent… Every Divine Ability has its purpose. Perhaps in one-to-one combat, Zhaojing is no match for Zhu Gong… but against the Merciful Ones, 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' is far more useful than 'Subjugating Crest'!"

"Tinglan’s idea wasn't wrong. Li Ximing is a Li, after all. Though the entire Li family couldn't make half a ripple under Luoxia… it’s always good to avoid suspicion… But now, in this situation, a fight against Buddhist cultivators… The Li Clan would certainly be willing to lend a hand, which gives us a perfect excuse to bring him back…"

"Moongaze Lake…"

He flew from that spot, traversing the Great Void without a moment's rest, heading straight south. Soon, he emerged from the void and saw the lake being lashed by a torrential downpour.

Faced with such violent weather, the Li Clan was clearly on high alert. The glow of Dharma Arts flickered across the lake's surface, and he could even see many cultivators in the attire of the Purple Smoke Gate. Daoist Master Kui Qi observed for a moment before descending.

He was met by a man in black robes with gray eyes and long eyebrows. The man's eyes widened in shock upon seeing him. He flew up, performed a deep bow with the utmost reverence, and said, "Greetings, My Lord. This humble one is Chen Yang of Moongaze, currently on patrol. I never expected to encounter a celestial presence. If My Lord has any decree, please grace me with your words. This subordinate will surely serve as your steed and deliver your message with his life."

Kui Qi waved his sleeve. "Take me to your clan head," he said casually.

While those words, which showed a measure of respect, the Daoist Master had no intention of flying there slowly. Chen Yang felt the world spin, and in the next moment, he was standing before the main hall. Kui Qi said nothing more, and Chen Yang, taking the hint, went inside to announce him.

Kui Qi stood with his hands behind his back, studying the man's features. His own Divine Ability gave him some insight into such things, and he made a silent assessment.

'This man has a grim look. Bowing, he's a hawk or a hound; standing straight, he could be a man of character. For the Li Clan to have such a servant is as good as having a fine Treasured Artifact. Moongaze Lake gathers talent; its fortune and atmosphere far surpass the southern prefectures.'

The thought had barely passed when a figure in crimson robes hurried out of the hall. With head bowed and eyes lowered, he spoke respectfully, "I was unaware of which Daoist Master had graced us with their presence. This lowly one failed to welcome you from afar. I am filled with trepidation and beg for your forgiveness."

The robed Daoist Master strode inside, admired the hall's decor, and took a seat in the master's chair. He raised an eyebrow.

"Kui Qi, of the Great Xiukui Monastery."

Li Jiangqian had already guessed as much, figuring the situation in the north had worsened. He bowed respectfully in the hall. Kui Qi, however, observed him for a moment, frowning to himself.

'Li Zhouwei truly has some skill. I can't quite get a read on this eldest son either. But then again, few from the main line of the Wei-Li clan are good people…'

He quickly dismissed the thought, his eyes fixed on the teacup on the table. "Where is Daoist friend Zhaojing?" he asked.

Li Jiangqian was unsure of his intentions and had no idea if this man had been sent by Qian Lizi. He revealed nothing, saying respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, the Old Ancestor should still be in the Eastern Sea."

He made no mention of Qian Lizi's request for aid or talk of Zhaojing's return.

Kui Qi simply traced the rim of the teacup with its jade lid. His pale gray eyes darkened. "You must have felt it," he said softly. "Trouble has stirred in Jiangbei. The Buddhist cultivators started it, in retaliation against Azure Pond and Purple Smoke… Purple Smoke's grievances with the Buddhist cultivators have been complicated in recent years, and Ning Tiaoxiao left behind a great deal of trouble."

"As for the current situation in the north, Zhu Gong is seriously injured and will not be showing herself. The one who wounded her was Taixi, the same person who ambushed Tinglan. Do you know of Taixi?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head.

"Li Xuanfeng," Kui Qi stated. "He was the one responsible."

"Right now, Tinglan has been ambushed. I saw that her life is not in danger, so I presume they simply want to keep her out of Jiangbei's affairs. This Daoist Master hopes that Daoist friend Zhaojing will return. Your family cannot avoid this matter."

The Daoist Master stared at the tea, his tone seemingly gentler than when he was talking to Zhu Gong. "I understand your concerns. I am not asking you to manage the affairs of Jiangbei. Quite the opposite. Having Zhaojing strike at the Buddhist cultivators now is to prevent him from being forced to intervene later when Jiangbei spirals out of control. What is needed now is to land a heavy blow on the Buddhist cultivators. On this point, I imagine the Li Clan has hated them for a long time."

Kui Qi looked at the two men quietly. "Whether from the standpoint of personal relations or the larger situation, rescuing Tinglan now is the choice that best serves the interests of Moongaze Lake. It is the choice that allows Moongaze to avoid getting entangled in Jiangbei. If Zhaojing extends a helping hand at this time, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition will certainly remember it."

Having said his piece, he placed the jade cup down. "Moongaze Lake can weigh the importance of this matter for itself," he said softly.

It was obvious. While both he and Qian Lizi wanted Li Ximing to return to Jiangnan, Kui Qi's status and his argument were on an entirely different level. His words laid out the stakes and the benefits, making for a far more compelling case.

More importantly, this Daoist Master Kui Qi was the de facto master of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's Great Xiukui Monastery, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. When he spoke with such gravity, who would dare to say no?



# Chapter 860: The Might of the Supreme Yang

Upon hearing this, Li Jiangqian took a step back and bowed.

"We obey the immortal decree of the esteemed Upper Sect. We will convey your intentions to our Daoist Master at once."

There was no other choice. After what Daoist Master Kui Qi had said, remaining neutral was no longer an option. Even a refusal would have to come from Li Ximing himself.

Besides, the Daoist Master had framed it cleverly. If they helped, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition would remember the favor. But if they stood by and did nothing, their inaction would be remembered all the same.

Having spoken, Li Jiangqian gave an order.

"Go and request the Old Master's presence. And bring out the clan's jade talisman."

The Great Xiukui Monastery was famously aloof, and their Daoist tradition was esoteric and strange. From Houfu a few years ago to Kui Qi now, none of them were mild-mannered. Li Jiangqian deliberately humbled himself, using deferential language like "obey the esteemed decree," which made the Daoist Master chuckle.

"You're being far too polite," he said.

Despite his words, he was clearly pleased. He took a sip of tea and continued, "Moongaze and Zhaojing will not be poorly treated in this matter. Zhaojing has only just reached the Purple Mansion Realm, and his divine arts are still developing. He's one of ours. When we ask him to act, he won't be fighting alone."

Li Jiangqian bowed again. "Thank you, Daoist Master. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition protects Jiangnan, and we are humbled to live under its radiance. I will convey your message with the utmost care and await our ancestor's command."

Kui Qi grunted his assent. Seeing that the man was in a good mood, Li Jiangqian pressed his advantage.

"However, the situation in Jiangbei involves many factions, and Daoist Master Zhu Gong has already retreated after being wounded. Without a Daoist Master of your stature overseeing things, I fear there could be delays..."

"Jiangbei..."

Moongaze Lake was situated right on the river, far closer than the distant Great Xiukui Monastery in the south. Their concern for Jiangbei was natural. Kui Qi paused for a moment before speaking.

"You need not worry about that. They won't cross the river. It's just a few Children of Destiny that have been drawn out. If they had been born in the south, it might have been trouble for you. Before Zhaojing returned, you would have had reason to worry. But now that he's back, at worst, he can just tear open the Great Void and crush them with a single finger."

"Although the south is also eager to get its hands on these Children of Destiny, Tinglan and Ning Wan have both gone north. Who could possibly find them faster than your clan?"

A sense of stability settled in Li Jiangqian's heart. He bowed once more. Kui Qi then rose, his gaze turning thoughtful as he stared at the rain clouds.

'Since these Buddhist cultivators are stirring up trouble, there's no need to show mercy,' he thought. 'I'll return to the monastery to retrieve another spiritual artifact, then head to Tongmo and Yuyang. After that, I'll pay a visit to my friend, Daoist Master Lingmei.'

The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had such profound reserves and vast connections that even the Way of Emptiness only dared to stall their two Daoist Masters, not make a fatal move. Kui Qi had nothing to fear. He looked down and said, "When Daoist Master Zhaojing returns, please ask him to wait for me by the lake. If he grows impatient, he can come find me at the Xiukui Monastery."

With those words, Kui Qi's form dissolved and vanished. The two left behind remained prostrate for a long while before rising. Li Jiangqian shook out his robes, returned to the main hall, and waved a hand. Chen Yang took the hint and discreetly withdrew.

"So it really is the Buddhist cultivators..."

He stood in silence for a moment as footsteps approached from the sides. Li Xuanxuan had received word earlier and was already waiting in a side hall. He now strode forward.

Li Jiangqian frowned. "Old Master, Daoist Master Kui Qi said... the one who killed Lord Xuanfeng was Maha Taixi. Have you ever heard of this name?"

At the mention of Li Xuanfeng, the old man started, then stroked his beard. "I only heard... it was a purple-black treasure alms bowl."

Li Jiangqian let out a breath, finally able to relax. He briefly explained the situation, settled into the main seat, and shook his head. "In any case, with the Daoist Master returning, we won't have to live on edge anymore. It’s not our place, as Foundation Establishment cultivators, to be scheming about the affairs of Purple Mansion experts. With him here, all our plans will have a true master..."

Li Xuanxuan's expression was still tinged with worry, but Li Jiangqian was visibly more at ease. "The Great Void is vast. The journey back from the Eastern Sea could take half a day or a full day, but not much longer. Please summon our sisters and elders. We shall prepare to kneel and welcome his return in this hall."

"As it should be."

Li Xuanxuan had also come to terms with it. Setting all else aside, the prospect of seeing Li Ximing after so many years brought a genuine smile to the old man's face. He shook his head with a helpless sigh. "Zhouming has been confined for so long, it's been torture for him. Once things are settled, we can finally let him out."

"Indeed," Li Jiangqian agreed with a smile, his mind already racing.

'The annual sacrificial rites are also approaching. If the Daoist Master returns and can set up the great formation, we won't have to go through such an ordeal this time.'

But just as the orders were being sent out, Qu Bushi unexpectedly arrived in the hall. He first bowed to Li Xuanxuan before reporting respectfully, "Patriarch, the Capital immortals Dao marketplace was attacked. Its defensive formations were shattered. The Guan Clan lost three direct descendants and suffered heavy losses. Cultivators of all levels were injured. The guardian of the market, Song Yunbai, is severely wounded and missing."

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow. "Such heavy losses? Who did they fight?"

"A group of demonic cultivators," Qu Bushi said deferentially. "It's related to the demonic disciple from before; he was among them. Our sources in the north say the leader is incredibly powerful, at the very peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even Guan Gongxiao was at a slight disadvantage against him... It was a surprise attack. By the time the Capital immortals Dao forces arrived, the demonic cultivators were already retreating."

"While the Capital immortals Dao's losses weren't catastrophic, their morale is shattered. The entire sect is gripped with anxiety."

"Demonic cultivators," Li Jiangqian murmured, frowning in confusion.

Qu Bushi lowered his voice. "It is said the demonic cultivator refined a blood-light treasure mirror with his own life force. Its power is astounding, and it's suspected to be an ancient Dharma tool. The masters in the north sent a warning, telling us to be wary of the Wilderness."

Guan Gongxiao wasn't being kind. His message was a warning that they shared the same fate. But with Li Ximing's return, the Li Clan's position would be secure. Li Jiangqian replied casually, "Go back and thank them for the warning. Tell them we will pay close attention to the Wilderness."

Qu Bushi nodded quickly and departed. As the hall doors opened, more people began to file in.

The news of Li Ximing's return had not been widely announced. Only the core members of the direct lineage had been summoned. If Li Ximing failed to return as expected, it would be an even greater disaster. For this reason, not even Zhouming was allowed to come and greet him.

As dusk settled, spirit lamps were lit, casting a warm glow. Everyone waited in silence. Li Minggong stood solemnly before the hall, the flickering light playing across her face, making her features shift between light and shadow.

They waited late into the night. Finally, a soft, gentle radiance emerged from the deep darkness over the lake. In the utter silence, the ethereal light shimmered and transformed, coalescing into the figure of a man in platinum Daoist robes.

The man had refined features and a medium build. In the center of his brow, a point of Profound Light pulsed with brilliance. His hands were clasped behind his back, and he exuded no overwhelming aura. Instead, as he landed before the hall, he seemed to let out a quiet sigh of relief.

Everyone immediately dropped to their knees, their voices united in a chorus of reverence.

"We pay our respects to the Daoist Master!"

The Daoist Master walked slowly up the steps. He first helped Li Xuanxuan to his feet and had the old man seated before taking the main seat himself. His eyes scanned the room, as if checking for missing faces. He looked at Li Jiangqian, then studied Li Que'wan, and sighed with emotion.

"You two siblings have reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. It seems like only yesterday you were still at Qi Refining, and now you have become pillars of our clan."

The two bowed to him. As the radiant light of the Bright Yang shone down, everyone felt the very ground beneath their feet grow more solid.

The Li Clan was only truly an Immortal Clan of the Purple Mansion Realm when Li Ximing was present at the lake. His presence instilled confidence from top to bottom. Yesterday, they might have been consumed by worry, but the moment Li Ximing returned, even with just a simple question, a profound sense of security settled over them. The entire atmosphere of the clan shifted.

Only then did Li Ximing ask, "Did you encounter some trouble?"

Years ago, Li Ximing had made a pact with Zhouwei, leaving behind several jade talismans, each with a different meaning. Although the one used today was merely a summons for his return, Li Ximing's heart was fraught with worry.

The moment he received the message, he had rushed back without pause, traveling nonstop through the Great Void day and night. Before he even reached the lake, he had used the Immortal Mirror to assess the situation. Only when he saw everyone waiting safely did he relax and reveal himself.

In response to his question, Li Jiangqian stepped forward from the crowd and bowed.

"Daoist Master Tinglan and Daoist Master Qiuhu have gone missing. The Northern Buddhists have made a move. It was a Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition who requested that we summon you back for aid."

"Ning Wan reached the Purple Mansion Realm!" Li Ximing exclaimed in mild surprise, before his brow furrowed in thought. "Tinglan is missing..."

Tinglan had been quite helpful to him during his time overseas and had shown intent to protect the Li Clan during his absence. While the debt wasn't immense, Li Ximing still coveted the World's Radiance in her possession. For now, he only asked, "The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is so venerable. Why would they need my help? To think they would summon me back... Who is the enemy we are to face?"

Li Jiangqian recounted the events in detail. Li Ximing stroked his beard, listening in silence before sighing. "Tinglan, Qiuhu... both are friends of our clan. With Kui Qi making such a request, do I have any reason to refuse? Our home faces Jiangbei and has Jiangnan at its back; we cannot afford to offend the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... It's no wonder you called me back."

He considered the situation. Amidst the helplessness, his eyes gleamed with a faint light as a realization dawned in his mind.

'This is a fateful opportunity to obtain the World's Radiance... The key isn't Kui Qi, but Tinglan and Qiuhu. This is a chance to earn gratitude from three sides at once.'

'No matter how powerful the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is, they have countless trump cards. How could a Daoist tradition left by a True Monarch not have one or two Golden Core-level methods? Immortal cultivators are not Buddhist cultivators. As long as I can ensure a safe retreat and avoid bringing too much trouble upon myself, the potential rewards of this venture are immense...'

He glanced at Li Xuanxuan and declared, "We must remember the grudge of our ancestors. Maha Taixi is now a mortal enemy of our clan. The karmic ties with the eighteen Buddhist Master Monks have been forged, and they can never be erased. Either our clan beats him back to the north, and one day eliminates him entirely, or he will be the death of me. Of this, there is no doubt."

"Furthermore, with my existing relationship with Tinglan and Qiuhu, it's not surprising that he would seek me out."

As he quietly contemplated, Li Jiangqian bowed and said in a low voice, "Precisely. As I see it, this is not a bad thing..."

"Maha Taixi is our enemy. Our clan alone can neither withstand his attacks nor hope to destroy him. And he is not alone in the Way of Emptiness's paradise; there is still Zhelu behind him. The loss of the eighteen Buddhist Master Monks was a blow to the Way of Emptiness. While Zhelu's hatred for our clan may not be as deep as Maha Taixi's, the karmic connection remains."

"And the Way of Emptiness is not the Way of Wrath! This issue has been simmering beneath the surface, but if they were to suddenly strike, persecuting our clan to fulfill what the Buddhist cultivators call karmic retribution, and ultimately give rise to a Merciful One... it is a very real possibility."

"The current situation in the north is a golden opportunity—a chance to tie our clan's feud with the Way of Emptiness to the great tree that is the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition!"

At these words, several people nodded in contemplation. Li Que'wan spoke thoughtfully, "Brother, you mean... if we can heavily wound Maha Taixi this time, this new conflict will overshadow old grievances, intensify the friction between the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the Way of Emptiness, and solidify our relationships with Purple Smoke and the Ning family. This would be extremely advantageous."

"Exactly!" Li Jiangqian bowed. "If the Daoist Master had not returned this time, we would be facing an aggressive Way of Emptiness from the north while having offended the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in the south, destroying friendships on multiple fronts. How could our clan possibly stand independently in Jiangnan after that?"

"What's more, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is proud, and the Great Xiukui Monastery is aloof. Once this matter is concluded, should we face retaliation from the Way of Emptiness, we will have a legitimate reason to ask the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition for help! And when Father achieves his breakthrough, our status will be even more secure!"

Despite Qian Lizi's earnest pleas in the past, Li Jiangqian had remained unmoved. Yet, with just a few words from Kui Qi, he dared to summon Li Ximing back. He clearly had his own calculations.

Li Ximing simply stroked his chin and nodded, thinking, 'I need not fear the disparity in power, only hidden formations and ambushes. Fortunately, I have the Immortal Mirror. Once I reach the north, a single scan with the mirror should reveal many of the Buddhist cultivators' trump cards and traps.'

"Well said." He smiled and asked, "What impact have these events in Jiangbei had on the clan?"

Seeing his expression, Li Jiangqian knew that Li Ximing had been persuaded. He answered respectfully, "Fortunately, there has been no major impact..."

He reported the recent events in full. Li Ximing listened, nodding repeatedly. "You see," he laughed, "the cultivators of the Capital immortals Dao are no match for our Moongaze clan. Look at the state they've ended up in!"

He praised Li Jiangqian, then his gaze swept over the other clan members.

Li Que'wan had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, so her cultivation wouldn't change for some time. Li Jiangqian had clearly made significant progress and could attempt to reach the mid-stage. Li Minggong had only recently reached the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm.

Crucially, none of the people before him should have taken a Talisman Pill yet.

Li Jiangqian was close to the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. If he could break through and then consume the pill, he should quickly reach the cusp of the late-stage without arousing suspicion.

More importantly... Li Ximing had returned with a Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill.

'What unfortunate timing. Minggong has already broken through to the mid-stage. I'm not sure how this pill should be administered after a breakthrough... I'll have to ask Tinglan later. Giving a pill meant for a Purple Mansion cultivator to someone at the Foundation Establishment Realm will certainly result in a massive surge in cultivation. Add a Talisman Pill to that, and we can first raise one of our own direct descendants to the late-Foundation Establishment Realm!'

If Li Chenghui hadn't died, he would undoubtedly be at the late-stage by now. But as things stood, they could only push Li Minggong forward. Consuming such a powerful pill right after her breakthrough was inherently dangerous, but thankfully, the Talisman Pill had no side effects and could even consolidate her cultivation. By taking that first, she could handle the rapid advancement.

He tapped his fingers on the table, having made his decision. "Then it is settled. Have Cui Jueyin come here. He will accompany me to the Great Xiukui Monastery to see how many people Kui Qi can muster. The rest of you, do not leak the news of my return. For now, we will wait and observe."

# Chapter 861: A United Front

## Lin'an Prefecture

The domain of the Great Xiukui Monastery was a secluded world of its own, a rugged landscape of hills nestled between mountain and sea. Temples and shrines dotted the entire region, each a self-governing entity within a Daoist tradition that clung to ancient customs. Though the cultivators here rarely ventured beyond the prefecture's borders, this adherence to the old ways had allowed a hundred flowers to bloom.

The night was pitch-black when a sliver of bright light streaked from the north, gliding toward the central mountain range. Below, a dense forest marked the entrance to the Great Xiukui Monastery. The light, appearing slow but moving with incredible speed, soon solidified before the mountain gate, revealing a man in a white-gold robe. He carried an air of serene confidence. Beside him, a scholarly man stood with quiet respect.

Li Ximing glanced around and saw a stone stele standing before the gate, upon which two large, black characters were carved with wild, aggressive strokes:

[Tiger's Frontier]

The calligraphy bore no signature and seemed dull and lifeless. A young man in a black robe waited at the foot of the stele. Seeing them, he bowed respectfully.

"You must be Daoist Master Zhaojing of Moongaze... my master ordered me to wait here and respectfully greet you upon your divine arrival."

Li Ximing gave a slight nod. Cui Jueyin stepped forward and smiled. "Please!"

The youth led them onward, and only then did they see the characters inscribed at the true center of the mountain gate:

[Supreme Works That Level the Seas]

The foundational pillars of a grand gate remained on either side, but the vertical plaques that should have hung from them were long gone. All that was left were two stone pedestals of extraordinary quality, from which hung a pair of lanterns that cast a dim, golden glow.

Li Ximing took this in, his mind already turning. He had been to the Nine Mounds, where the gate was inscribed with [The Nine Daos of the Supreme Mound]. Seeing these words now, [Supreme Works That Level the Seas], a realization dawned on him.

'Perhaps it's like the Daoist tradition of Comprehending Profoundity, where they love to begin everything with the character for 'profound.' The Supreme Yang and Supreme Yin are one family, so it’s perfectly reasonable for them to claim the character for 'supreme.' '

'But the Azure Pond Sect... I've never heard of them having such a gate... very strange.'

As for what had happened to the missing plaques, it would be an awkward question to ask. He feigned ignorance and followed the youth inward. The path was paved with ancient, unadorned stone bricks that exuded a timeless aura, and Daoist flags fluttered in the wind. Snow began to fall, growing thicker as they ascended. At the highest peak, he was surprised to see several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators chopping firewood, sweeping snow, and tending to fields.

The summit of a Daoist tradition of this caliber should be precious land, every inch coveted for disciples to use for secluded cultivation. Yet here, several tea trees had been planted—ordinary, mortal plants devoid of any spiritual energy.

Upon seeing Li Ximing, the group of cultivators paused their work to bow before immediately returning to their farm chores. A pile of firewood lay scattered on the ground, and two Foundation Establishment cultivators in servants' attire hurried over to gather it.

Cui Jueyin had followed with his head lowered the entire way. Seeing this, he quickly moved to clear the path. They arrived at a hall in just a few steps. There, a Daoist Master in a black robe was brewing tea amidst the falling snow.

"Zhaojing, your timing is perfect!" he said with a smile.

Li Ximing had always known that the Xiukui were proud, but he hadn't realized their pride ran this deep. Cui Jueyin brushed the snow off a seat for him. Li Ximing accepted the tea, sat down, and smiled. "You must be the esteemed Kui Qi. I have long heard of your great name. I hope to benefit from your guidance."

Kui Qi waved his hand dismissively. "Zhaojing, you have come to lend us your strength. It is the Xiukui who should be thanking you. There's no need to speak of guidance..."

Seeing Li Ximing nod, the Daoist Master finally brushed the snow from his own robes and said with a gentle smile, "Some years ago, when the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven fell, my monastery also had some gains. We acquired a treasured pill from within, a Bright Yang artifact. We do not follow that path, so in a few days, I will have it sent to you, Zhaojing, as a small token of our gratitude."

Self-interest has always been the greatest motivator. Kui Qi offered the pill right away, and Li Ximing saw no reason to refuse. "Thank you very much, senior!" he replied with a grin.

The mention of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven's fall was a dagger to Cui Jueyin's heart. His own ancestor's grotto-heaven had been carved up and divided, and the Cui Clan hadn't even been allowed to ask a single question. The bitterness he felt was palpable. He could only stand with his head bowed, silent.

Li Ximing noticed his distress and waved a hand, dismissing him.

"Yes, sir."

Kui Qi's expression turned serious. "That pill was once appraised by Daoist Master Yuandao himself. It is a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm spirit pill. A single one can nourish the dharma body and suppress curse-inflicted wounds. If used for cultivation, it could probably enhance one's divine abilities by a fair amount... It is quite extraordinary. Only a few ancient pills could surpass it."

Evidently, by offering such a pill, Kui Qi was implying that any injuries Li Ximing might sustain in the coming battle could be healed, ensuring his cultivation would not be hindered.

'A fair amount...'

Had Li Ximing heard this a few years ago, he would have been overjoyed. But he had grown accustomed to fine things overseas and had just consumed a pill to advance his cultivation; it wasn't wise to take another so soon. He felt a pang of disappointment.

'Still, it's not bad. The other two spirit pills I have aren't for raising cultivation level anyway. Using this as a substitute saves me from wasting them. As for healing... I have my own methods.'

He sighed internally. Though he smiled on the outside, his lack of genuine excitement did not go unnoticed. A thought flickered in Kui Qi's mind.

'It seems Li Ximing's knowledge of alchemy is quite profound... He's no ordinary, half-baked Purple Mansion cultivator. Spirit pills of this grade won't be enough to move him.'

But whether it moved Li Ximing was one thing; given the stature of the Great Xiukui Monastery, offering the pill was the absolute minimum courtesy when inviting someone to fight for them. He stroked his beard and said, "Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities are difficult to cultivate... Zhaojing... take a look at this."

He retrieved a golden box from his sleeve and casually opened it. Inside rested a disc-shaped treasure. It was a brilliant golden-yellow, engraved with runes in eight directions. The outer edge of its face was encircled by a ring of fine, pale-white sigils that pulsed with a soft, rhythmic light. Its center blazed with a dazzling golden radiance, as if a tiny sun had fallen into the box.

'A Bright Yang spiritual artifact!'

This was something Li Ximing could not remain indifferent to. His eyes burned with desire, and he cursed inwardly.

'What a ridiculously wealthy sect, this Great Xiukui Monastery! I couldn't find a single trace of a spiritual artifact like this, yet he keeps one tucked away in his sleeve like it's a common cabbage... The old, established powers... they truly are different.'

Desire was one thing, but a spiritual artifact was an object of immense value. This Daoist Master couldn't possibly be giving it to him for free. Though his eyes were glued to the treasure, Li Ximing managed to exclaim, "What a magnificent treasure!"

Kui Qi lifted his head slightly, a smile playing on his lips. "This is the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, a first-tier spiritual artifact and a registered treasure in the Xiukui archives. It is a superb instrument, equally adept at offense and defense. We are about to face the Buddhist cultivators in a great battle. Zhaojing, you shall take it with you."

Li Ximing could hardly tear his eyes away. He listened as Kui Qi explained, "You see the face? That is the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Chart. It can unleash a destructive Bright Yang light, led by the Upper Shining Star at its apex. When held upright, its power is limitless. If you spin it downward, with the Upper Shining Star at the bottom and the Yang Extremity Star at the top, holding it inverted will allow you to throw the stars into disarray, to escape peril and overcome danger."

He couldn't help but sigh with emotion. "The ones who forged this compass back then were Su Jun and Chen Xuanli, as a symbol of Ning State's fealty to the Wei court and its adoption of the Wei calendar. For a time, it was the heirloom of the Su family of Jiangbei. After the Su family was destroyed, it eventually found its way into the hands of my Great Xiukui Monastery."

Li Ximing nodded silently. Kui Qi smiled nonchalantly and hinted, "I've heard that this spiritual artifact was inspired by the Crimson Severing Arrowhead and the Sovereign's Perilous Tread. Not only are its abilities formidable, but its aid to one's cultivation is also immense. When the battle with the north begins, Zhaojing, you can experience it for yourself."

He added with a smile, "The Li Fire is a baleful convergence; it neither wanes nor waxes. One who holds the true position of fire makes neither pills nor artifacts. The Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven may have been powerful, but in the Dao of pills and artifacts, they were ultimately inferior to others. Dharma Treasures aside, the spiritual artifacts that fell from the grotto-heaven back then were, in truth, not as good as this one of ours."

Li Ximing simply lifted the spiritual artifact, holding the disc and admiring it fondly. He turned it over. The back was as smooth as a mirror, reflecting the heavy snow falling from the sky.

'If I could just study it for a bit...'

Li Ximing was still a long way from mastering Sovereign's Perilous Tread and Crimson Severing Arrowhead, so how could he not covet a Bright Yang spiritual artifact? But the man had said it was a registered item, making it a difficult topic to broach. He smiled and said, "It is truly powerful! A single word from Senior Kui Qi is more enlightening than ten years of studying Daoist scriptures."

This was no mere flattery. The man's description of the Li Fire revealed his profound understanding. Li Ximing infused the spiritual artifact with his divine ability and thought to himself:

'Once the fight starts, I'll see how magnificent this spiritual artifact is and then test his intentions. If the price is something I cannot afford, I can always try to ask for one of the spiritual artifacts from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. Having a spiritual artifact is better than having none at all.'

Just as he finished this thought, an old man in a gray robe approached through the snow. He had a sword on his back, a gentle expression, and an utterly unremarkable face. He landed on the platform and clasped his hands.

"Daoist friend Kui Qi!"

The man's demeanor was so unassuming that if not for the powerful aura of his cultivated divine abilities, one would never guess he was a person of significance. He first bowed to Kui Qi, then turned. "Daoist Master Zhaojing! It is a pleasure to finally meet you!"

This was none other than Chen Yin, Daoist Master Yushui of the Yuyang Chen Clan, one of the three great Immortal Clans of Yue State!

This Daoist Master was even older than Xiao Chuting and had mastered two divine abilities. His swordsmanship was renowned. Li Ximing quickly rose and offered a respectful salute. "Greetings, senior!"

When Chen Yin had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the Li family were likely little more than minor landlords. The title of "senior" was well-deserved. Chen Yin sidestepped slightly and said with a meaningful smile, "We should have met long ago!"

Li Ximing felt a sense of shared history and nodded. "Indeed... Back when I was breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Chen Xuanyu of your esteemed clan also lent his aid. I have not forgotten this. Our two families have always been on the same path..."

Li Ximing had obtained his Radiant Sky Stone from Wang Fu, and Chen Yin had dispatched Chen Xuanyu to assist at that time. Though it was a matter of competing interests and not necessarily born from goodwill toward the Li family, the Chen Clan was now at odds with the Changxiao Gate, making them a natural potential ally for the Li family.

Hearing this, Chen Yin sighed. "Xuanyu is a rare talent in our clan. He is currently in seclusion and has yet to emerge. Who knows how many years it will be!"

Kui Qi smiled and waited for the two to finish their reminiscences before speaking. Chen Yin's voice grew somber. "I have already inquired. Daoist Master Zhusheng of the Southern Borderlands is not in his estate, but Daoist friend Luo was very enthusiastic and has already gone to Jiangbei."

Kui Qi looked slightly surprised. "It is indeed inconvenient for Daoist Master Zhusheng, likely because of that family on North Dan Island. But this Luo fellow actually dares to come? Fine, fine. It is good that he has the courage. These demonic cultivators are just opportunists, they won't be of any real use."

The way he spoke of him made it clear that this person did not walk a righteous path. In his mind, he was in the same despicable category as Zhu Gong. The Li Clan, with its ancestry tracing back to the Immortal Dynasty's imperial line and its fame as a bastion of the righteous path, having lost generations fighting Buddhist cultivators, was afforded his gentle treatment. What backwater demonic cultivator could possibly earn his respect?

Because of this, even though the man was coming to help, he didn't dare set foot in the Great Xiukui Monastery, instead waiting in Jiangbei. His fear and wariness were plain to see.

After a moment, Chen Yin shook his head. "It's all to curry favor with Daoist Master Qiuhu. He desperately needs the Si family's Daoist tradition. The barefooted aren't afraid of those with shoes. When the time comes, he can just flee south, and there will be nothing the Way of Emptiness can do."

Kui Qi nodded in understanding. Li Ximing couldn't help but ask, "Senior Houfu..."

Kui Qi shook his head. "When True Monarchs fight, the mortal world suffers for it. There is a great drought in Shu, and the demonic cultivators of the Western High Plateau are invading from the east. This matter is not normally our concern, but those demonic cultivators are descendants of the Lesser Yang. Our Supreme Yang Dao split from the Lesser Yang, and we have a duty to defend the Western High Plateau in turns. It is now the Xiukui's turn, and we have strength to spare. Houfu must go, and he cannot be easily moved."

He seemed pressed for time. As soon as he finished, his expression turned serious. "Time is short, so I will be brief. This time, I have invited Daoist friend Lingmei to support us from the rear. Several Daoist Masters from Jiangbei will also assess the situation and lend their aid. Now, take this Xiukui spiritual artifact with you... We must slaughter a few Merciful Ones to consecrate our banner!"

His expression grew progressively colder, his voice a low growl. "When the Buddhist cultivators entered Xu all those years ago, we fought a great battle. The Yue Cultivating Sect beat them so badly they were crying for their mothers. They schemed to eliminate Jingzhan, the most zealous advocate for pushing south, and only then did they behave for a few decades. In the conflict between north and south, a few Mahas suffered setbacks, but no blood was shed. And now they have the audacity to test us."

"If we don't beat the dog brains out of these Buddhist cultivators, they will walk all over the Daoist traditions of Jiangnan!"

He took a step and soared into the Great Void, his face grim. The other two followed closely behind. Li Ximing glanced silently at Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin. The old man's eyelids were drooping, and he seemed to let out an almost imperceptible sigh.

***

## Jiangbei

Dark clouds blanketed the sky, and the torrential rain continued unabated. The storm grew more terrifying, and while Baijiang Creek held, its downstream tributaries, the Baiye and Baihai, had broken their banks and changed course multiple times, killing an untold number of common folk.

Only because the great river flowed east, connecting Lake Xian to the Eastern Sea, did the water levels remain stable enough for Jiangnan to be spared. As the Purple Mansion cultivators flew north, the lands of Baiye Creek were littered with floating corpses. The sight darkened Kui Qi's already grim expression. He stared for a long while before speaking.

"What a tragedy! Jiangbei was once so densely populated, and now one can travel for miles without seeing a single household. Apart from a few great clans, there are no common people left to speak of!"

Neither of his companions dared to respond. When they reached the area of Xiaoshi Mountain, they remained concealed. Kui Qi drew out several ink-black jade talismans, pinched his fingers in a divinatory gesture, and gave a meaningful look to Chen Yin, who then crushed a talisman, evidently summoning the Daoist Master who had come to help.

While performing his divination with divine abilities, Kui Qi seemed to be observing their surroundings. He let out a breath and turned to whisper, "We will certainly encounter Taixi first. I will leave him to Senior Yushui; a sword cultivator is always more efficient against him. The Merciful Ones will be for Zhaojing to handle. Zhu Gong eliminated one, so there should still be four of them."

"Don't even consider that Luo fellow. The Zhelu will certainly send someone, but unless their leader makes a move himself, they are no threat!"

He spoke with grave importance. "There is only one thing you must guard against: the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions. That Treasured Artifact is not what it once was. After years of refinement, even I could fall victim to it if caught unaware. Always hold back a portion of your strength!"

# Chapter 862: Suppression

"Fellow Daoists!"

No sooner had the words been spoken than a figure stepped out of the Great Void. He had a full head of gray hair and wore black robes emblazoned with thousands of brown, eye-like circles that shimmered with a dark light in the emptiness.

This was clearly the Daoist Master Luo who had been mentioned earlier.

He first bowed to Kui Qi, his expression one of deep respect. "Greetings, my lord!" he said with a smile.

Kui Qi nodded, his face a cold mask. He then turned to Chen Yin, with whom he was obviously more familiar, and his expression softened into a smile. "It's been many years. Your cultivation has progressed once again, my friend!"

Chen Yin, unlike Kui Qi, returned the greeting with an amiable smile. Only then did Daoist Master Luo turn his attention to Li Ximing. The eye-like patterns on his robes seemed to ripple as he spoke with effusive enthusiasm. "So this is the renowned Daoist Master Zhaojing! I have long heard of your incredible deeds!"

It was difficult to be rude to someone so friendly, so Li Ximing responded politely, though he found the man's robes unsettling and avoided looking directly at them. Just then, Kui Qi's ice-cold voice echoed in his mind, transmitted via a divine ability.

'Zhaojing, this Luo is also from the Yue State, and he's no good. He consorts with demon beasts in the Southern Borderlands, rules over a shamanic kingdom, and refines any promising barbarian cultivators into that robe of his year after year. Be careful.'

'Still, you needn't worry about him defecting to the Buddhists. The Demon Kings despise him, and he has killed a Merciful One before. Just keep your distance.'

Li Ximing now understood the source of his unease. Observing more closely, he guessed that Daoist Master Luo was an Eastern Yue.

'He has the same habits as Fu Daomu from the lake all those years ago. Fu Daomu refined the Human Head Mountain... For Chen Yin to invite him here... he must have some leverage over him.'

No wonder Kui Qi was so cold. Wearing a Dharma robe like that, how could Kui Qi possibly give him a warm reception? The only reason Kui Qi wasn't already attacking was likely because the victims were barbarians from the Southern Borderlands, which lessened his disgust. Otherwise, a call to arms would have been likely.

'This man is truly testing the limits... dancing on the edge of a blade.'

Despite Kui Qi's frigid demeanor, Daoist Master Luo remained all smiles, his enthusiasm impeccable. When Kui Qi completed his divination, a hazy, colorful light emerged from the Great Void. It was as if a black cloth had been lifted, revealing a vast expanse of gold.

Luo glanced at it and understood. "It's the Wisdom-Void Demon-Subduing Grand Formation," he said in a low voice. "Zhelu is personally suppressing them from within. They must be holding out with the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion or the Rain-Watching Treasure Cauldron."

"This grand formation is anchored by a Maha using a spiritual artifact," he continued. "It can hide within the Great Void, but its formation eyes exist in the mortal world. All we need to do is shake it enough to distract them."

He had mentioned two powerful treasures in one breath. Li Ximing recalled that Tinglan also possessed the Supreme Minister's Gourd and the Immeasurable Water and Fire. If those two were brought out, even a Maha would likely have to retreat. No wonder the men before him were so unworried.

The light in Kui Qi’s hand faded. He turned and instructed, "The few of you here are under the protection of my spiritual artifact. As long as you don't move, those below won't be able to detect you in the Great Void. Wait for the opportune moment to strike!"

Below them, the rain over Xiaoshi Mountain dissipated, revealing traces of the multi-colored Buddhist Land.

"I will go first," Kui Qi said softly.

As his figure materialized above Xiaoshi Mountain, the golden light finally rippled. Before it could react, a horse-headed Maha leaped out, a wide grin splitting his face and revealing large, white teeth.

"Daoist Master Kui Qi!" he called out. "And who have you brought with you today?"

Li Ximing and the other two remained motionless in the Great Void, holding their positions. Li Ximing, however, fixed his gaze on the Maha, a thought taking root in his mind.

'So this is Taixi... my clan's mortal enemy.'

As expected, the moment Taixi appeared, Kui Qi's expression turned savage. He raised his Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, his silence more menacing than any threat.

Suddenly, the void rumbled, and four golden-bodied Merciful Ones appeared, each holding a different Dharma instrument. In that same instant, Chen Yin drew his sword and vanished.

Taixi’s smile froze. His two horse-like ears pricked up, listening intently. A flash of silver light erupted as a slender sword materialized behind him, tearing through the void with a piercing glint.

"Chen Yin!"

Without a second thought, Taixi’s Dharma body swelled dramatically in the air. No longer seated cross-legged, he soared on a colored cloud as a purple-black alms bowl shot out, attempting to block the blade.

But Chen Yin was no ordinary cultivator. The slender sword tapped lightly on the bowl, and the sound of a great flood filled the heavens and earth. The Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl let out a violent hum as a torrent of white rain fell, causing Taixi’s Dharma body to sizzle wherever it struck.

Taixi immediately withdrew, raising the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl to catch the celestial water. He brandished a staff to counter Chen Yin's swordsmanship, his mind racing with confusion.

'Isn't Chen Yin in the Southern Borderlands? Wasn't he at daggers drawn with Daoist Master Zhusheng, fighting over a spiritual artifact? The Changxiao Gate has made no move, so how dares his Chen Clan cross the river?!'

Kui Qi did not fear Taixi, but Taixi was confident he could handle him. The Maha Zhelu had long since deduced that Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin, was on good terms with Hengzhu and shouldn't have intervened. Furthermore, his conflict with Daoist Master Zhusheng of the Shahuan Kingdom in the Southern Borderlands, compounded by pressure from that Daoist Master Luo, gave him the perfect excuse to decline. How could he have crossed the river?

The sword sects were conservative. Although an anomaly like Lingmei had appeared, it was still exceedingly difficult for them to act. The only one with a firm stance was Li Ximing, but he had been driven to the Eastern Sea. And who knew where Changxiao was? How could he possibly show up?

This was why Taixi had been left outside the formation to face their enemies. The sudden appearance of Chen Yin told him that things had gone terribly wrong. He desperately called for aid while urging the others on. "Quickly, stop him!"

The four Merciful Ones froze.

Dealing with Zhu Gong was one thing, but was Kui Qi on the same level as Zhu Gong? It wasn't just a matter of two extra divine abilities. All of Zhu Gong's possessions combined weren't worth a single one of Kui Qi's spiritual artifacts!

Furthermore, Kui Qi was a Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery. His methods weren't simple physical combat. The Xiukui were known as one of the three great ancient shamanic Daoist traditions; fighting them could lead to the utter annihilation of both body and soul!

Yet, the Maha had given an order. How could they refuse? They could only brace themselves and advance, each one looking more timid than the last, as if ready to self-destruct their Dharma bodies and flee at any moment.

As expected, a cold glint appeared in Kui Qi's eyes. He suspected Taixi had other tricks up his sleeve and didn't rush to call out Li Ximing and the others. Instead, he stood his ground, holding the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, and then swung.

Simultaneously, a powerful black wind swept up, tearing the colorful light from the four Merciful Ones' golden bodies. A black chain descended from the sky, striking like a viper from the shadows.

A chill ran down their necks. The leading elder Merciful One had already returned to the Buddhist Land, leaving the others in disarray. Only the six-armed Merciful One, the strongest among them, roared and charged forward, but the black chain coiled around him in an instant, trapping him in mid-air.

The bronze-like Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword flickered in and out of sight within the gray wind. A low shout echoed: "Freeze!"

A point of cold light flared in the black wind. The remaining three Merciful Ones scrambled back, each faster than the last, as Daoist Master Kui Qi's form dissipated and reformed in a sudden, explosive burst of speed.

A massive hand materialized from the black wind, seizing one of the golden-bodied Merciful Ones by the neck. The Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, held in his other hand, plunged down from above, piercing the crown of its skull. With a vicious twist, like a priest slaughtering a sacrifice, he drove it deeper.

Whatever divine ability he used, the Merciful One let out a soul-tearing scream. Kui Qi's expression remained unchanged, though the whites of his eyes grew more prominent.

"A Merciful One who's cultivated for a few decades, leading three worthless novices, and you dare to obstruct me? Do you really think you're all elites like Nuzi or Minghui, sitting at the foot of the Lotus Throne!"

Zhu Gong had no experience fighting the Northern Buddhists, but how could Kui Qi not? He had attacked with his full strength from the start, unleashing two spiritual artifacts and three divine abilities at once!

He kept his grip on the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, letting the Merciful One howl in agony. Pinned by the black chain, it couldn't move. The other three watched in terror as Kui Qi laughed.

"The smart one sacrificed himself early and returned to the Buddhist Land to avoid my Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword! Only you four fools are left waiting to die!"

The impact of his words was immense. Not only did the remaining three Merciful Ones freeze, but even Taixi's expression changed. The one impaled on the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword finally broke, his courage shattered by pain and fear. Why wait for death when he could save himself? Countless golden cracks spiderwebbed across his golden body.

*Boom!*

A magnificent burst of rainbow light filled the sky. Kui Qi had already withdrawn using his Body Divine Ability. He coughed twice, then laughed aloud and cursed, "Fool!"

The Xiukui's Daoist tradition was esoteric, with few direct, fatal techniques in frontal combat. By goading his opponent, Kui Qi had conserved his own trump cards. The remaining three, terrified and confused, hesitated. This gave him the opening to raise his sword and strike at the golden light.

*Boom!*

The sword blow sent shudders through the golden light, as if striking something immense. Above, a faint radiance began to descend, clouds swirling around it. The commotion had clearly alerted those inside the formation.

Taixi’s face was utterly grim. He could only shout one name: "Vija!"

At his call, a shaft of colorful light descended from the heavens. Within it, illusions of men and women sitting in opposition flickered, accompanied by the roars of fighting jackals. A golden figure dropped from the light. One half of his face was a mask of hatred and jealousy, while the other was lost in melancholy, a truly fearsome sight.

'The Way of Great Desire's Vija...'

Kui Qi's expression finally turned serious as he eyed the golden figure.

Taixi had been a second-generation Maha during the North-South war. The Way of Emptiness had benefited from that conflict, and in the years since, he had reached his third reincarnation, making him a formidable opponent. He could hold his own against a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. But the one before Kui Qi now had been reincarnated five times and was far stronger. As that strange half-face looked over, a droning voice spoke.

"Daoist Master Kui Qi! I have no desire to interfere in this matter. We will not endanger the lives of the two Daoist Masters... we only wish to prevent divine abilities from wreaking havoc in Jiangbei and causing needless casualties. If you withdraw now, it would be an act of great merit..."

Hearing this, Kui Qi began to understand.

Vija was clearly reluctant to get too deeply involved. Years ago, Purple Smoke Gate and Azure Pond Sect had joined forces to steal his Qi Wang Profound-Heaven Hearing. He was here now because of that karmic debt. If Kui Qi had passed the Purple Mystery tribulation and possessed four divine abilities to go with his spiritual artifacts, Vija would have turned and fled without hesitation. But as things stood, Vija was strong enough to suppress him, so he had shown up.

Kui Qi merely sneered and shook his head. He raised the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword and said casually, "I have never tested the divine abilities of a five-reincarnation Maha! Today, I shall ask for your guidance!"

Right now, Kui Qi’s only option was to stall Vija. After all, he was the only one present who could contend with this five-reincarnation Maha. He began to feel fortunate that he hadn't revealed himself immediately. If they had all appeared at once, their opponents would have surely sent this Maha to deal with Chen Yin while Taixi tied him down, which would have been a disaster. Fortunately, he had seized the initiative and avoided the worst-case scenario.

'The Chen Clan is on good terms with Hengzhu. Logically, Vija wouldn't want to create such a deep karmic feud... so he will likely focus on me. But one must always be prepared for the unexpected.'

With a solemn gaze, he summoned his spiritual artifact.

Seeing this, Taixi began to gain the upper hand against Chen Yin, forcing him back. "So, this is all a Lin is capable of!" he laughed.

Kui Qi remained silent. But just then, the golden light of the formation flickered, and a small, sinister-looking dagger carved from beast bone descended from the Great Void, smashing into the light and unleashing a shockwave.

At the same time, a man in a white-gold Daoist robe appeared, the Profound Light in the center of his forehead flashing. A beam of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light—brilliant as snow and blindingly intense—shot from the Great Void, trailing purple flames as it slammed into the golden light.

*Buzz!*

The golden light flickered erratically. The three remaining Merciful Ones had just started to move closer when a gray-haired man in a black robe covered in a thousand spotted eyes materialized, holding a small, white jade hammer. He followed close behind the first attack, tapping the handle of the bone dagger.

*Clang!*

Daoist Master Luo was clearly skilled. The golden light shuddered on the verge of collapse, revealing its true form: an eight-spoked Dharma wheel, golden in its entirety, with a hollow center studded with various gems.

But the hammer strike seemed to have triggered something. A chorus of chanting echoed from the Great Void, and three more golden-bodied Merciful Ones emerged from the formation. The one in the lead had a third eye in the center of his forehead, giving him a commanding presence. Their faces were serene as they shouted, "Vile demon!"

An old demon like Daoist Master Luo wasn't about to be caught so easily. He had been prepared. The moment his hammer struck, he dissolved into a gray wind, and the three Merciful Ones lunged at empty air.

Li Ximing was farther away. Seeing three more golden bodies suddenly appear, he immediately flew off, a trail of purple fire shielding him from the shining holy light.

Taixi, who was handling Chen Yin with ease, was still able to observe the battlefield. The appearance of a Bright Yang cultivator stunned and confused him. "Li Ximing!" he cried out in shock.

'He's back from overseas! Where is Changxiao?!'

The gazes of the three Merciful Ones shifted almost simultaneously. Seven eyes on three golden bodies all locked onto him, a mixture of surprise, shock, and even a faint greed in their expressions. In unison, they abandoned the gray wind and gave chase.

"A remnant of the Wei-Li traitors! You dare show your face in the north? Surrender your life!"

Taixi, keeping a close watch on the situation, had been utterly stunned by Daoist Master Luo's appearance. The truth finally dawned on him.

"Damn it! These cultivators are a bunch of actors!"

Fortunately, the retreating Daoist Master Luo was intercepted by his own Merciful Ones, which allowed the Maha to breathe a sigh of relief. He then turned his attention to Li Ximing. But unlike the Merciful Ones' elation, a chill went down Taixi's spine when he saw their expressions.

'He cultivates Audience with the Celestial Gate... Merciful Ones are clumsy by nature, and these three fools haven't even reached the Developing Wisdom throne... yet they're rushing headlong into his trap!'

'Never mind... even if they can't win, it's enough to just tie down that Radiant Pass...'

This was Li Ximing's first time fighting a Merciful One, and he couldn't gauge their true strength. He simply flicked his sleeve and flew on a trail of light and flame. The Profound Light on his forehead pulsed, and the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light flared once more.

The brilliant beam didn't aim for the three-eyed Merciful One in the center, but instead veered slightly, striking like a meteor at the one who was a step slower. The Merciful One raised his sword to block.

*Sizzle!*

Sparks of fire erupted. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, which Li Ximing had cultivated for years, struck the side of the Dharma sword. Instead of dissipating as it usually did, it deflected and shot towards the Merciful One's face.

The Merciful One only had time to squeeze his eyes shut and duck his head slightly, taking the blast on his cheek. The brilliant white light managed to burn a finger-sized hole straight through his left cheek.

With that one exchange, Li Ximing gained a measure of confidence.

'The one in the lead might be trouble, but the two on the sides are clumsy. Without the support of Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities, their Dharma bodies are just a bit tough. They're not even as strong as Fuxia from the lake back then!'

To Li Ximing, these so-called golden bodies were only slightly stronger than a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who specialized in spell arts, similar to himself. If the Wrathful Manifestation hadn't died, Fuxia would have been among the elite of the Merciful Ones, far beyond these three.

His confidence surged. He raised a hand, and a perfectly round bead appeared in his palm, engraved with the image of a tiger looking over its shoulder. It was the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger.

A soft, silken, earthy-yellow light instantly emerged, forming a screen in front of him, just in time to meet the short staff of the three-eyed Merciful One!

*Thud!*

The Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen had been useless against Changxiao, but against this Merciful One, it finally held firm. Though the light dimmed, it had withstood the blow.

Li Ximing seized the opportunity, bringing two fingers to his lips to channel his divine flames. Seeing this, his opponents knew they couldn't let him cast his spell. They attacked from front and back, swinging their weapons.

The Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen blocked one more sword strike before shattering. As the final golden hammer descended with immense force, Li Ximing flickered away on a ray of Profound Light. A faint yellow film covered his body, deflecting the Dharma instrument. His wrist stung, but he was otherwise unharmed!

This was the second wondrous ability of the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger—Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption!

Li Ximing then drew upon his flames, his lips parting slightly to exhale a stream of fire.

The flame was blazing red on the outside, with a white and gold core. It shot out with incredible speed, blossoming in the air into a golden whip laced with red that swept towards his enemies.

The Purple Mansion Realm spirit flame, Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire!

The three immediately leaped back. The one with the hammer had managed to touch Li Ximing, but it had cost him half a second. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire first struck his hammer, engulfing it in a burst of sparks before splashing onto his golden arm.

"Aargh!"

A howl echoed through the air. The Merciful One reappeared some distance away, his arm now being consumed by a purely golden flame that burned countless holes in it. Some were as large as a longan fruit, others like a rash of tiny, writhing black dots.

It was impossible to misunderstand. They instantly realized their mistake.

"We were careless! A Purple Mansion Realm flame... it's a True Fire!"

True Fire, after all, was not Merging Fire or Li Fire. It couldn't cling to its target like a stubborn disease, nor could it burn indefinitely. The wounds it caused were easier to heal. However, its power lay in its instantaneous explosive force, which was truly formidable. Even the golden hammer used to block it had its engravings blurred by the heat, its power clearly diminished.

"This..."

Li Ximing was taken aback, a complex mix of emotions washing over him.

In his few battles after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, his opponents had either been mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters with three divine abilities, or late-stage Great Daoist Masters who had crossed the Purple Mystery threshold—and all of them were disciples of Encompassing Profoundity. They had beaten him so badly he'd barely escaped with his life.

Now, armed with a spirit flame, an improved cultivation, and his trump cards, he was facing Merciful Ones who weren't even a match for an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. The shock of it all sent a jolt of confidence through him, and his eyes lit up.

'If the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire is this effective, what about the Flame of Final Return? And what about the Lustful Merging Fire, which even the Nine Hills Daoist tradition coveted?'

Li Ximing was momentarily stunned, but he couldn't miss this chance. He took a step forward, the light on his forehead flaring again!

The three-eyed Merciful One frowned, clearly finding him to be a troublesome opponent. The closed eye on his forehead snapped open, shooting a beam of golden light to counter the Profound Light from Li Ximing's own forehead. He swung both of his short staves and shouted, "Form the array!"

The other two quickly exhaled, taking their positions on colored clouds. But Li Ximing still had the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass up his sleeve; he was perfectly calm. Flames of intertwined purple and gold ignited in both of his hands.

Sun's Resonant Parting Art!

This was a spell art inherited from Li Jiangqian, one of the best the Li family possessed. Li Ximing had mastered it himself. He unleashed a parting light that blocked their attacks while the earthy-yellow Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen flared up around him once more.

The three-eyed Merciful One remained unfazed. The three of them opened their mouths in unison, spitting out a cloud of golden sand that filled the air.

Did they think he would be afraid of this? Spirit flames refined metal. Unless these monks could spit out Purple Mansion Realm-grade precious metals, none of it could stand up to a True Fire. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire bloomed again, forming a protective barrier that kept the golden sand at bay.

Li Ximing directed his Profound Light and purple fire, once again striking at the hammer-wielding Merciful One.

Unexpectedly, a holy light shone from the Merciful One's body. Although the Profound Light dissolved it and the purple fire burned his torso until golden blood flowed, he stood unshaken, continuing to spit golden sand.

Li Ximing instantly grew alert. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed that the golden sand they were spitting was indeed growing stronger. Looking up, he saw streams of colored light descending from the sky, stretching deep into the Great Void. As they set up their formation, they were channeling the brilliance of the Buddhist Land through the Great Void!

"Heh!"

Li Ximing was not one for pleasantries. He stared for a moment, then let out a cold laugh.

'An array? Fine! How dare you set up this kind of array in front of me! You're courting death!'

With a thought, a golden glint shone in his eyes. A great wind howled as an ornate, brilliant white celestial gate emerged from the Great Void, adorned with rainbow clouds. Banners fluttered as troops in golden armor descended, illuminating the entire mountain range so brightly that even the distant combatants couldn't help but look over.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

The divine ability descended with immense power, drilling out from the rainbow clouds like an ever-expanding mountain range, soaring into the heavens. Its power ground down and suppressed the flow of their own abilities, and the colored light above the three Merciful Ones was instantly crushed.

Not even three breaths passed before a loud crack echoed. The connection of colored light between them was snapped. The three grimacing Merciful Ones were all forced a step back, and the two weaker ones even coughed up golden dust.

*Boom!*

Amidst the swirling rainbow clouds and the clamor of troops, the Audience with the Celestial Gate stood firm. The Daoist Master in white and gold stood atop it. Two colossal, intricately carved white pillars descended, pressing down on the three figures until they were like ants pinned beneath the gate!

In an instant, the tables had turned!

"In all my years of cultivation, I've only ever been the one suppressing others! Who cultivates the Audience with the Celestial Gate—me, Li Ximing, or you three monks? You dare try to suppress me?!"



# Chapter 863: Chiluo

The *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was an art of brilliant and majestic power, a manifestation of the Bright Yang itself. In terms of sheer spectacle, few techniques could compare to its magnificent and radiant display. Now, a mountain-sized Celestial Gate materialized in the sky, casting its light in all directions. To the north, the temple tenants prostrated in worship; to the south, the common folk kowtowed in terror.

The three Merciful Ones felt as if a colossal mountain range was pressing down on them, rendering them immobile. A continuous, grinding pressure descended from the celestial gate, layer by suffocating layer. Li Ximing then raised a hand to his lips.

“Hmph.”

He exhaled a breath of red and white energy that transformed into a torrent of shimmering golden *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire*, which poured down toward the base of the gate. Erupting alongside it was the scorching violet flame of the Bright Yang, instantly turning the area into a sea of fire.

Sweat poured from the three figures as the golden lacquer on their Dharma Bodies began to melt, dripping into the blazing inferno below where it evaporated with a sizzle. This only served to strengthen the divine ability's oppressive force.

Worse still, the sacred light from the Buddhist Land above was severed, causing the protective, life-sustaining iridescent glow around them to weaken significantly. Only the innate Treasure Light of their Dharma Bodies still flickered, offering a feeble defense against the surging flames.

Regardless of the trio's desperate struggle below, Li Ximing sat calmly atop the Celestial Gate, a realization dawning on him.

'So this is why Daoist Master Kui Qi had to call me back,' he thought. '*Audience with the Celestial Gate* is incredibly effective against these Merciful Ones. Its grinding suppression and ability to sever their connection to other powers strike right at their weakest point!'

Every divine ability had its unique strengths. *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was renowned for its oppressive power. While it didn't grant Li Ximing the decisive, enemy-slaying force of Yehui's or Changxiao's techniques, once it gained the upper hand, it crushed its opposition with the inexorable, righteous might of a great mountain. The Merciful Ones, who possessed no divine abilities of their own, were utterly pinned.

As the white celestial gate in the sky pressed down with ever-increasing weight, the two Merciful Ones in the back turned anxiously to their leader. One of them spoke in a low voice, "Master Pingling, we juniors have only recently ascended to the Buddhist Land. Our power is weak and our standing is low. We beseech you to borrow a divine ability from the Buddhist Land to preserve our three Dharma Bodies!"

The three-eyed Merciful One in the lead hesitated. He was faring slightly better than the others. While channeling his own power to help them resist the pressure, he watched them sweat profusely, their golden lacquer melting away in the True Fire. He gritted his teeth and sent a telepathic message.

"This divine ability is bizarre beyond belief. You think I don't want to borrow power? We may have our place in the Buddhist Land, but our pleas can still reach it. The problem is, the light from the Buddhist Land might not be able to descend! I don't serve directly under a Developing Wisdom or a Golden Lotus Seat—how could I possibly have that much Faith Power?"

His two companions, however, looked at him with suspicion. They knew that if this fire kept burning, Pingling might last until reinforcements arrived, but they certainly wouldn't. Realizing he was just trying to avoid shouldering the burden alone, they could only say in low voices, "We are willing to lend you our strength, Master!"

A flicker of delight crossed Pingling's face, but before the words were fully spoken, a brilliant white light shot out from within the flames. Concealed by the radiance of the gate above, it struck like a venomous snake. The hammer-wielding Merciful One barely had time to raise his Dharma Tool before letting out a cry of agony.

"Ah!"

The light struck his metallic eyes, and his left eye instantly exploded into a shower of golden dust. The three Merciful Ones didn't dare hesitate any longer. They formed hand seals in unison, and the three-eyed Pingling began to chant urgently.

"The eight directions are without measure, all is Xuwang. Right and wrong, all are but empty thoughts… Where the Treasure Light shines… for inconceivable merit, only our Buddhist Land seeks verification! This lowly cultivator beseeches a divine ability!"

Li Ximing's *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was growing stronger by the moment. He suddenly looked up, sensing a tremor in the Great Void, as if another world was drawing near. Auspicious clouds materialized in the sky, and a single, five-colored beam of light descended.

The ray of light was only about the size of a person’s head, a lone pillar attempting to reach its target. However, it was halted above the *Audience with the Celestial Gate*, its brilliance shining down upon the technique itself.

The moment the light touched his ability, Li Ximing frowned, feeling a searing pain. The *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* immediately rushed to intercept it, but the colored light passed through unhindered. It was only diminished by the grinding power of the celestial gate, losing more than half its strength before it finally passed through the radiant barrier and landed on the three-eyed Merciful One's head.

As the light entered him, Pingling's eyes shone with a crystalline light, and dense runes lit up across his body. Two more arms burst from his back and pressed against the base of the *Audience with the Celestial Gate*, attempting to heave the massive structure upward.

Li Ximing merely glanced at him, the Profound Light in his brow re-forming. A cold smile touched his lips, and his eyes gradually turned a pale gold. He formed a hand seal, his resolve hardening.

'Well, well, well. Instead of using that power to escape, you actually think you can overturn my *Audience with the Celestial Gate*? Let's see you try!'

Holding nothing back, he circulated his spiritual qi, and the radiance of his divine ability intensified. The light within the celestial gate became blindingly brilliant, washing the world in white.

This sight caused Vija in the sky to look on with surprise and Taixi on the ground to grimace. Daoist Master Kui Qi, however, was not surprised at all; Xiukui was clearly aware of both the True Fire and the *Audience with the Celestial Gate*. He simply exhaled a puff of black smoke.

Taixi's expression was grim. Though he had expected these three idiots to cause trouble, he hadn't thought they would be so thoroughly suppressed so quickly.

His own power was a notch above Chen Yin's, and with the *Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl* to contain his opponent's Water Mansion, he had already gained the upper hand. Seeing the situation, he shook his head inwardly and began to ponder.

'They said Chen Yin and Li Ximing would be too occupied to intervene, yet here they both are. Could it be that Zhelu was never confident and was just tricking me into taking the lead? If that's the case, don't tell me there's a Lingmei waiting in the Great Void as well?'

The political machinations within the Buddhist Land were no less complex than those of the Immortal Dao. Although Taixi and Zhelu were both Mahas of the Way of Emptiness and ostensibly on the same side, there was a clear power disparity. Zhelu had been the one to promote Taixi, so Taixi acted as his subordinate, but he had never let his guard down. His heart sank as a thought took root.

'Zhelu, you have plenty of Merciful Ones under your command, not to mention those who serve the Golden Lotus Seats... yet you couldn't bear to send two of them? Meanwhile, five of my men were deployed, and two have already lost their Dharma Bodies. Dammit... that Tinglan and Qiuhu, they are just in the early Purple Mansion Realm. Kui Qi might need a Maha, but he could also be tied down by a group of Merciful Ones?'

The formation array in the sky that was suppressing Tinglan and the other cultivator belonged to someone else. Taixi couldn't grasp the situation and had no news from Zhelu. A feeling of wrongness crept over him. He stood still, pinching his fingers together in a divinatory gesture. Half of his eye instantly transformed into a sphere covered in dense runes, allowing him to peer through the Great Void toward the Buddhist Land, urgently sending out a call for aid.

Meanwhile, the Merciful One Pingling was in an utterly wretched state. His four arms, straining against the ever-heavier Celestial Gate, flickered in and out of existence. The other two, shielded by his efforts, were finally able to catch their breath, but their expressions were just as grim.

It wasn't that Pingling insisted on a futile last stand; it was that he had no choice. The colored light was a divine ability granted by the Buddhist Land, and there were only a few types available. You got what you were given. He wasn't a Maha who could wield a variety of wondrous abilities at will. Worse, the power had been slashed by sixty percent by that insidious *Audience with the Celestial Gate*. What good could it possibly do?

But their troubles were far from over. Li Ximing wasn't about to wait. A streak of white light shot through the air—the *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light* had returned.

Fortunately, the other two had a moment's respite and hurriedly used their Dharma Tools to block it. The hammer-wielding Merciful One took the brunt of the blow and coughed up a spray of golden dust. But then, a flash of bright light streaked through the sea of fire. The Profound Light flared, and a pale golden sleeve wreathed in golden flames swept out from within!

Li Ximing had planned this strike for some time. While the *Sun's Resonant Parting Art* didn't synergize perfectly with his True Fire, he had personally descended in his Dharma Body. Using the *Valley Wind Guide-Fire*, he had gathered an immense concentration of flames in his palm. Finally, catching his opponent off guard, he slammed it viciously into the hammer-wielding Merciful One's chest.

Li Ximing possessed no Body Divine Ability, so the Merciful One should have had a chance to react. However, one of his hands was occupied blocking the *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light* with his hammer, while another arm had been scorched by the fire. He was a fraction of a second too slow and had no choice but to take the palm strike head-on.

"BOOM!"

An intense burst of True Fire erupted. The Merciful One let out a single howl as a column of Purple Mansion Realm True Fire instantly punched through his chest, sending golden fragments flying. The three-eyed Merciful One's eyes widened in fury. He retracted all four of his hands, absorbing the full force of the celestial gate's pressure, and slammed them down into the flames.

"Pow!"

Li Ximing took the hit, his body dissolving into light and retreating. Suppressed by the divine ability, the three had no way to pursue him and could only watch as he reappeared atop the gate.

The hammer-wielding Merciful One was charred black, a massive wound nearly cleaving his torso in two. Sixty to seventy percent of his aura had vanished. He spat out mouthfuls of golden lacquer and muttered, "What a vicious fire art!"

From their perspective, Li Ximing's palm strike had come without any warning. He must have been secretly chanting, using his divine ability to mask the fluctuations of his True Fire while he slowly gathered its power. It was an undeniably vicious tactic. Li Ximing, having returned to the gate, spat out a mouthful of Bright Yang light. Protected by the *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* and his opponent's rushed counterattack, he had only suffered some internal turmoil. He nodded to himself.

'These monks' bodies are tough... but thankfully, they're clumsy.'

The palm strike had no real divine ability behind it; it was pure True Fire and Talisman Qi. Against someone like Changxiao or Yehui, whose movements were enhanced by their own abilities, such a direct attack would never have landed. But against a Merciful One, it was far easier.

Seeing this, the three below were filled with dread. If this continued, Li Ximing would slowly torture the other two to death. Pingling had to send a hurried, low-voiced message.

'This man is treacherous, a true scion of Wei Li. Every single spell art he cultivates is clearly designed to counter us Buddhist cultivators. He is a true enemy of our path, and his strength cannot be underestimated. We can't delay any longer!'

He delivered the message with urgent speed, and the two behind him nodded in vehement agreement, their faces pale with lingering fear as he brought up the situation inside the main battle.

'The *Immeasurable Water and Fire* is too terrifying. It severs the Great Void. Not only can those inside not perceive the outside world, but they are also afraid of causing collateral damage. We would have been better off facing the enemy out here and simply praying to the Buddhist Land for aid.'

The three of them had actually been relieved when they were sent out. The woman inside, standing atop a purple pavilion and wielding an earthen gourd, was unleashing *Immeasurable Water and Fire* that could only be described as the bane of the Merciful Ones. Other techniques merely severed the Great Void; her fire completely erased it! If even a speck touched you, the Great Void would be annihilated wherever you fled. If you were heavily injured, you wouldn't even be able to die and return to the Buddhist Land!

The *Immeasurable Water and Fire* was troublesome enough on its own, but the *Supreme Minister's Gourd* it was channeled through—a legacy of the Purple Smoke Gate—amplified it to the point where the flames were about to engulf the entire grand array. If not for the personal intervention of the Maha Zhelu, the chaos inside would have been unimaginable.

The three of them were the weakest, so they had been sent out, spared from facing those terrifying flames. But now, trapped under Li Ximing's suppression, it was only a matter of time before their Dharma Bodies were ground down, and all their cultivation wasted.

Just then, the eight-armed Dharma wheel in the sky finally lit up. A red-skinned, green-eyed monk emerged, riding a short-furred tiger whose coat burned like flames, giving it a majestic and imposing air.

He stepped through the air, a hint of relief still lingering in his eyes, though his expression was somewhat grim. His gaze swept across the Celestial Gate spanning the heavens, and he froze for a second before a look of delight appeared.

"A remnant of Wei Li!"

He strode forward and grabbed at the air, pulling out a crimson pagoda. His eyes bulged with fury as the pagoda shot out a beam of light. The red-faced Merciful One roared, "You still dare to act so presumptuously!"

An intense sense of crisis washed over Li Ximing; he knew this newcomer was no simple opponent. He whirled around, the Profound Light from his brow shooting forward to meet the attack. A deafening explosion echoed in the sky. As the smoke cleared, the red-faced Merciful One was already upon him, riding his tiger, his iron-like palms crashing down toward Li Ximing's face.

The *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* flashed into existence, only to be shattered by the palm strike. The tiger beneath the Merciful One let out a sudden roar. A great chanting of sutras filled Li Ximing's ears, causing his spiritual qi to stagnate and forcing him to retreat.

Unexpectedly, this person's Dharma Body was incredibly powerful. He didn't pause for an instant. A red light flared in his eyes, and he opened his mouth to spew a rain of crimson flames.

Although the Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption couldn't evade fire, Li Ximing's *Audience with the Celestial Gate* bolstered his Dharma Body, granting him greater resistance to flames. Furthermore, standing upon the gate itself, he was shielded by its Profound Light. He took the brunt of the fiery attack with only a slight pain in his chest and no serious injury. But the flames clung to him. He immediately brought two fingers together and spat out his own *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire*.

The red-faced Merciful One fought fiercely, his strength clearly on another level compared to the three below. But he knew he would still struggle against an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, so he remained on high alert. He was merely scorched back a single step, using his pagoda to block the attack.

The pagoda was forged from Geng Metal. While all fires could refine metal, and it was thus vulnerable to True Fire, Geng Metal was the most fire-resistant of the three major types. The newcomer, Chiluo, was also a master of flames, allowing him to temporarily suppress the fire.

With the *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire* redirected, the flames at the base of the celestial gate finally died down, and the great gate began to tremble.

Li Ximing sighed internally. He used a divine ability to extinguish the flames on his chest. Facing the red-faced Merciful One's advancing pagoda, the *Audience with the Celestial Gate* finally lifted from the ground. He dropped into its center, using the technique's power to shield himself.

Having been roasted by the True Fire for so long, the other three were finally free. The Treasured Artifacts of the sword and hammer wielders were slightly warped from the heat. They flew up into the air and respectfully said, "Our thanks, Lord Chiluo!"

"It's nothing!"

The red-faced Merciful One had eyes only for Li Ximing and had no time to waste on them. His eyes flashed as he shielded the three from the descending Profound Light. He recalled his pagoda to block the *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light*, his mind racing.

'I must devise a plan to kill this man!'

Li Ximing stood unshaken, his hand hovering near the spiritual artifact hidden in his sleeve.

If this battle concerned his own interests, he would have continued to pin down the three without hesitation, clashing head-on with Chiluo. He would have held on, at least until the two weaker Merciful Ones were beaten to the point where they could no longer fight. That would have been the best way to defeat all four of them.

But this battle was someone else's problem. To fight so fiercely and allow Chiluo to get into close quarters would inevitably result in injury. Whether that pill he had could heal him was one thing; after so many years of struggle, he knew how much time and energy it took to recover from a single wound, and he had no desire to waste any more.

Besides, his opponents couldn't surround him with a formation, and the *Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass* gave him a means of escape. There was no need to fight these four to the death. He stood quietly, observing.

'Every one of these Merciful Ones who sees me is filled with greed. They won't let this go easily!'

Just as he predicted, Chiluo was already forming hand seals for a new technique, with the other three protectively surrounding him. Li Ximing's gaze hardened, falling once more on the hammer-wielding Merciful One, whose body was already battered and broken.

'First, I'll send this fool on his way!'



# Chapter 864: The Lethal Force of Bright Yang

As Li Ximing’s thought flashed by, the rainbow light in the sky broke free from the suppression of his Divine Ability, *Audience with the Celestial Gate*, and swelled back to its original, brilliant size.

The three-eyed Merciful One finally received the full empowerment of its own divine ability. It grew two more arms, for a total of four, and in each hand, a phantom golden weapon materialized—a saber, a spear, an axe, and a club.

Chiluo was still casting his spell. He saw Li Ximing's *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire* hurtling toward him, followed closely by the *Audience with the Celestial Gate* Divine Ability. With grim resolve, Chiluo withdrew the pagoda he had been using to suppress the fire, recalling it to protect himself and leaving the three figures before him completely exposed.

From this single move, Li Ximing knew the old cultivator was no fool.

*Audience with the Celestial Gate* was a Divine Ability that suppressed artifacts. Buddhist cultivators were not known for their skill in artifact refinement, so Chiluo's pagoda was certainly no match for a proper spiritual artifact. If it were pinned down, he could forget about ever retrieving it.

But this retreat left his allies exposed to the menacing Li Ximing. The three-eyed Merciful One, though it had just been scorched by True Fire, was now empowered and charged forward to meet the threat. Just as it raised its four arms to defend, the Profound Light of *Audience with the Celestial Gate* coalesced into a gateway as tall as a man and slammed toward the group.

The three-eyed Merciful One was clever. It took a step forward, positioning itself before the heavily injured, hammer-wielding Merciful One who had yet to recover, intending to meet any attack head-on. To its surprise, *Audience with the Celestial Gate* bypassed it entirely and shot straight for Chiluo.

Chiluo was halfway through casting a Dharma Art, clearly trying to invoke his own divine empowerment. Seeing the gate coming for him, his expression turned cold. Unwilling to sacrifice his pagoda to finish casting, and even less willing to have his connection to the empowerment severed and be trapped, he aborted the Dharma Art. Enduring the bone-chilling Profound Light, his body dissolved into fire and scattered.

The three-eyed Merciful One, Pingling, instantly realized he had been tricked and moved to help. But none of them wanted to be trapped under the gate, sacrificing themselves for another's benefit. Pingling’s four arms swung in unison, its golden weapons striking only at Li Ximing's Dharma Body.

The discord among the Buddhist cultivators gave Li Ximing an opening. His *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* flared to life as he suddenly turned his head, and a beam of Profound Light burst from the center of his brow.

He braced himself against the four golden weapons, determined to ensnare the fleeing Chiluo with his *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light*. Meanwhile, *Audience with the Celestial Gate* soared high into the air, poised to descend and suppress Chiluo from above. The red-faced Merciful One’s expression grew darker by the second.

Now, the other two Merciful Ones had no choice but to act. If they held back any longer and Chiluo escaped to the Buddhist Land, he would surely report them. Since Chiluo served under the Golden Lotus Seat, they would face dire consequences.

After a brief exchange, the two were forced to traverse the Great Void to intercept the *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light*.

Under the assault of Pingling's four golden weapons, Li Ximing's *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* shattered. Immediately, the brownish-yellow light of his *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* flared up in its place. This wondrous ability had limited uses—it couldn't defend against the twelve essences or fire-virtue attacks—but it held firm against the golden weapons.

Sparks flew with a deafening clang as the rainbow clouds in the sky trembled. A surge of pale white Bright Yang energy erupted from his position, followed by a gush of violet Bright Yang fire. But Li Ximing himself had vanished.

The two Merciful Ones who had gone to intercept the *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light* had just reappeared when a chill shot down their spines. The *Audience with the Celestial Gate* that had been chasing Chiluo had stopped precisely above them. It fell like a golden mountain, crashing down on their heads.

*BOOM!*

The stunning blow lit up the sky, shattering their protective auras in an instant. Their knees buckled with a sickening crunch, and the Dharma Power within them stagnated. The next moment, a rift opened in the Great Void beneath the gate. A hand as white as jade shot through the Profound Light, aiming for one of their faces.

The palm landed squarely on the forehead of the majestic, golden face.

Stripped of the protection of its aura and the rainbow light, the head, harder than any artifact, held for only a moment before exploding. A tsunami of golden flames and violent purple fire erupted along with it. The rest of the body was blown to smithereens, raining down as a shower of golden gems and precious stones.

At the same time, a vision of a beautiful, prosperous celestial domain filled with countless golden figures flickered at the edge of the sky. It seemed to receive a sliver of rainbow light before vanishing.

Stones flew everywhere on Xiaoshi Mountain, a dazzling, deadly spectacle. A Merciful One had fallen, its essence returning to the Buddhist Land.

*BOOM!*

Immediately after, the *Audience with the Celestial Gate* hanging in the sky trembled violently. Pingling, having been thoroughly played, was now seeing red. Its four arms pushed against the outside of the gate, shaking the Celestial Gate relentlessly.

Being outside the gate was a world of difference from being trapped beneath it. Moreover, Pingling now had the full empowerment of its Divine Ability, and each of its shoves sent tremors through Li Ximing's technique. Li Ximing ignored the sword-wielding Merciful One cowering in a corner. With a light flick of his sleeve, he slipped free, allowing the majestic Celestial Gate to dissolve back into Profound Light. He stood upon the rainbow clouds, panting slightly.

The fully empowered Pingling was not to be underestimated. Although Li Ximing's *Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger* wasn't used for direct combat, its derivative abilities, the *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* and *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption*, were still highly effective. The Dharma Power roiled within him but quickly stabilized. He had escaped with nothing more than a slight gash on the shoulder of his Dharma Body.

Pingling's face was so red it looked as if blood might drip from it. Just then, a laugh echoed from mid-air.

"Excellent!"

It was clearly Kui Qi's voice. He was at a slight disadvantage against Vija, but his opponent was hesitant to press him too hard, leaving him the leisure to observe the wider battle.

Li Ximing laughed inwardly.

'This method really works. Changxiao taught me well.'

His ability to inflict such devastating damage in a flash, instantly killing a Merciful One, was primarily because his targets had just emerged from the Great Void. They had no time to react before *Audience with the Celestial Gate* stunned them, shattering their protective auras. His success was twofold. First, *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was incredibly effective. Second… he had learned this entire strategy from Changxiao.

Back then, he had been naive and ignorant of how to properly fight with Divine Abilities. Changxiao possessed the uncanny talent of predicting where one would emerge from the Great Void. Every time Li Ximing had traversed it, he would be met with a Dharma Art, nearly getting himself killed within dozens of exchanges. Now, it was his turn to overwhelm others with superior tactics. Though he couldn't predict their exact exit point, by attacking a target they were forced to save, he could anticipate their general position, suppress them by surprise, and unleash his *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire* to achieve a miraculous victory.

Li Ximing had only a moment to catch his breath. Before he could celebrate, the rainbow light in the sky finished descending. Chiluo appeared, now with six arms holding two spears, two shields, and two swords, all gleaming gold. Four sharp eyes glared from his face as he rode a winged tiger, striding furiously through the air.

But this Merciful One clearly felt no camaraderie for his fallen companion. Li Ximing saw that while Chiluo's face was a mask of rage, his actions were exceedingly cautious. He held his Treasured Artifacts ready, a powerful flame gathering in his mouth.

Chiluo, after all, served the Golden Lotus Seat. He was at the pinnacle for a Merciful One, with the only differences between his peers being specific Dharma Arts and the possession of Treasured Artifacts. Li Ximing commanded his Celestial Gate to face Chiluo, who then opened his mouth wide.

*BOOM!*

A blast of intertwined lightning and fire shot out as a beam of spiritual light. Startled, Li Ximing solemnly raised his Divine Ability to defend. The beam struck *Audience with the Celestial Gate* with a flash of crackling energy, erupting in a cloud of black smoke.

Li Ximing felt a slight sting. His Divine Ability trembled, and the black smoke dissipated. Fortunately, while the beam was powerful, its lightning element was far weaker than its fire. The fire had the flavor of Li Fire, though crudely refined. Since Li Ximing's Bright Yang was closely related to Li Fire, he wasn't significantly harmed.

But the attack had served its purpose. Chiluo closed the distance to the gate, meeting Li Ximing's *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire* head-on with his pagoda. Two long spears appeared in his hands, thrusting through the curtain of fire toward Li Ximing's Dharma Body.

Meanwhile, the three-eyed Merciful One wasn't idle. While still trying to shake the gate, it was using the eye on its forehead to gather radiant light again. A thick, white glow had already accumulated there, its other two eyes locked onto the figure in the white and gold Daoist robes, waiting for the right moment.

Li Ximing activated his *Sun's Resonant Parting Art*, transforming it into two beams of purple flame that shot out to bind the incoming spears. He then swept his sleeve, releasing a wave of Profound Light that exposed the sword-wielding Merciful One who had been stealthily approaching.

Unfortunately, Chiluo's empowered Dharma Body was far superior to any he had faced before. The *Sun's Resonant Parting Art* was not yet profound enough; it held the golden spears for only a moment before they broke free. The winged tiger roared and lunged, snapping its jaws at his robes.

Li Ximing had no choice but to retreat into his Celestial Gate, using the Divine Ability to block the spears. With a loud crack, his face paled. *Audience with the Celestial Gate* trembled again, seeming to buckle under the pincer attack from Chiluo and Pingling.

His weakness—a lack of proficiency in spell arts—was finally exposed. He had too few methods to counter his enemies. His *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire* was clearly overwhelming the pagoda, yet he was forced to recall the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual fire to push Chiluo back, buying a precious moment. He channeled all his remaining Dharma Power into the disk-shaped spiritual artifact hidden in his sleeve.

The sword-wielding Merciful One, though caught in the Profound Light, pressed forward. Li Ximing had to turn and release his *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light* at it, a sense of foreboding rising in his heart.

As expected, Pingling did not miss such a golden opportunity. The white light that had been gathering in its third eye shot forth. Chiluo was a veteran; his eyes lit up, and with a furious roar, he joined in shaking the Divine Ability. The white light pierced through the Profound Light and descended upon Li Ximing.

The *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* and *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* lit up simultaneously. The silken screen, which had served him well, was shredded by the radiant light. It only weakened the glow slightly before it struck Li Ximing's sleeve. To his astonishment, the brownish-yellow *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* was useless against the white light, offering no resistance at all. As the radiant light fell, he only had time to detonate a cluster of purple flames in a brilliant flash.

'This is… the orthodox radiant light of the Buddhist cultivators! Its source is the twelve essences! Their radiant light truly is one of them—the Radiant Essence !'

In that instant, Li Ximing recalled what Changxi had said before his death and what Li Zhouwei had once mentioned about Bai Rong and the Radiant Essence. A searing red burn appeared on his wrist. Affected by the injury, his *Audience with the Celestial Gate* finally dimmed.

He endured the stinging pain and surged his Dharma Power once more. Chiluo, however, had shaken off the *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire*. His two golden spears pierced through the Profound Light, stabbing viciously toward Li Ximing's chest.

At this critical moment, despite his miscalculation and injury, Li Ximing gave a cold smile. A brilliant golden object fell from his sleeve.

The *Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass*!

The eight directional runes carved into the compass now shone with blinding intensity. The fine, pale-white incantations circling its edge were layered so densely they had become almost pure white. At its center, a dazzling golden radiance pulsed, hovering before his chest. He had been secretly channeling Dharma Power into it for so long, enduring injury without wavering. Now, the golden light split into four stars, forming a '匚' shape slanted toward the north. The leading point of light radiated an overwhelming authority that froze the two incoming golden spears in place.

The Upper Shining Star, held in ascendance—the lethal light of Bright Yang!

Chiluo's empowerment gave him some divinatory skill. He received a premonition of danger—a frigid chill spread through him, and a burning pain erupted in his chest. His two shield-bearing hands retracted to block his front.

The lethal light of Bright Yang descended from the *Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass*. It made no sound, like opening a skylight in a dim attic. A beam of golden-white brilliance fell, striking the two golden shields Chiluo had just managed to raise.

The shields were unceremoniously reduced to ash, not even leaving behind molten gold. The lethal light dimmed slightly before gently landing on Chiluo's arms.

The dense golden runes covering his arms all lit up, shining with ultimate brilliance before exploding into black smoke. The next instant, the arms themselves turned to ash. Chiluo's pupils filled with molten gold, which streamed down like tears. He staggered back two steps and cried out, "Aiya!"

Li Ximing's face was pale, his spiritual qi rapidly draining. He was forced to recall the Divine Ability, freeing the three-eyed Merciful One. The *Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass* in his hand was scorchingly hot. Seizing the opportunity, he sent his *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire* surging after the wounded Chiluo.

Chiluo had taken a direct hit at point-blank range. Not only were his arms destroyed and his radiance scattered, but his eyes were also seared by the Profound Light, tearing up uncontrollably as a wave of dizziness washed over him. Yet his reactions were incredibly fast. With no time to recall his pagoda, he managed to pull a round alms bowl from his waist and release its protective glow.

If his *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* hadn't failed, Li Ximing would be in much better shape. Still, he smashed a ball of fire onto his opponent's Dharma Body, rallied his energy, and summoned his Divine Ability. *Audience with the Celestial Gate* materialized once more and came crashing down.

Chiluo's alms bowl shot upward, ignoring its master's defense, and slammed violently into the bottom of the Celestial Gate. The bowl, which must have been nourished for countless years, instantly exploded, releasing an intense, radiant light.

Chiluo's choice was undoubtedly the correct one.

After being caught off guard, he absolutely could not allow himself to be suppressed beneath the Celestial Gate. If the empowerment from the Buddhist Land weakened while he was so severely injured, he might never escape. It was better to sacrifice the Treasured Artifact. Since the artifacts of Buddhist cultivators were generally inferior, there was a high chance he would never get it back if it was captured. Better to detonate it and prevent it from falling into enemy hands.

Chiluo was truly worthy of serving the Golden Lotus Seat. Even in such a dire situation, he made a series of perfectly correct decisions, instantly cutting his losses and even causing Li Ximing's Divine Ability to waver.

But in doing so, he left himself wide open. The unimpeded *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire* now poured down over him, exuding a terrifying, heart-stopping aura.

# Chapter 865: Flying Snow at the Purple Pavilion

A torrent of golden flame poured down, cascading over Chiluo’s golden body. The protective treasured light around him, already fractured by a blast of Bright Yang energy, had only a moment to flicker back to life before the scorching True Fire incinerated it completely. He let out a blood-curdling roar.

Li Ximing countered the descending pagoda with Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, but his own divine ability, Audience with the Celestial Gate, wavered violently from the blast of his opponent’s Treasured Artifact. He was forced to retract it, pulling the shimmering gate back to shield himself just as two more assailants closed in, ready to smash into the weakened ability.

At that critical moment, a disc reappeared in Li Ximing's palm—an artifact of brilliant gold, etched with runes of the eight directions.

The three-eyed Merciful One was the quickest to react. He instantly abandoned his Treasured Artifact and retreated, shielding himself with a wall of spiritual energy. The sword-wielding Merciful One, however, had no time to pull back. He could only brace himself and slam his full power into Li Ximing's divine ability, triggering an explosion of Profound Light.

Yet Li Ximing’s Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass remained dark, emitting no radiance at all. He was merely holding it. How could he possibly have the energy to power such a precious spiritual artifact?

'Damnation...'

The Merciful One's clumsy momentum, which had been his undoing, now ironically became his saving grace. His desperate, all-out gamble paid off. Audience with the Celestial Gate shattered into scattered Profound Light. Li Ximing’s vision swam, his divine ability dimming as his already frail state worsened. Fortunately, one of his opponents had managed to pull back. He fumbled at his waist, popping a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill into his mouth.

Though he hadn't suffered any major injuries, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass had drained his reserves. Compounding that with the forced use of a divine ability and the backlash from his enemy's final, desperate attack, his spiritual energy was in chaos, the Profound Light around him thin and weak.

But his opponent, Chiluo, was in no better shape. The Merciful Ones were relentless, and the successive impacts from the Bright Yang light, the Audience with the Celestial Gate, and the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual fire had taken their toll. More than half of the runes covering his body had been burned away, leaving his form a wretched patchwork of black and gold.

Seeing his two companions fail so spectacularly, Chiluo was so furious he could have laughed. If even one of them had a shred of experience, they wouldn't be in this mess. If he could trade these three for a single Five-Eyed Merciful One from the Golden Lotus Seat, Li Ximing would already be grievously wounded.

Chiluo had not underestimated Li Ximing from the start, but he had never anticipated the existence of the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. He had taken the last blow almost completely undefended. Even now, chaotic Profound Light ravaged him from within while True Fire licked across his skin. His eyes burned crimson as he bellowed, "You fools! Use your treasured light on him!"

Just as he'd suspected. After only a brief exchange, Chiluo had already identified the weakness of the Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption. At his command, the three-eyed Merciful One, Pingling, began to gather a white brilliance between his brows. The sword-wielding Merciful One surged forward, determined to give Li Ximing no time to recover.

Li Ximing cursed inwardly. He raised the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen, which was already showing signs of fatigue, and met the attack with the Sun's Resonant Parting Art. The advantage of a golden body became apparent at close range; his foe remained a potent threat, tying him down for the moment. Although Li Ximing’s spiritual energy was rapidly recovering, he couldn’t risk summoning a major divine ability to suppress him just yet.

As the white light on Pingling's forehead grew ever more intense, Li Ximing was forced to tear his gaze away and assess the wider battlefield.

Kui Qi had clearly played some kind of trump card. Black energy spewed from him, his face veiled in a gray mist, and he had fought Vija to a standstill. But he wouldn't be free to help anytime soon.

Chen Yin was faring much worse against Taixi. His Water Mansion divine ability seemed to be completely neutralized by the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl. If not for the threatening, razor-sharp chill of his sword keeping his opponent wary, he would likely be injured by now.

As for Daoist Master Luo, he was proving to be just as useless as Kui Qi had predicted. He was entangled with three Merciful Ones—and these three didn't even have a Golden Lotus Seat powerhouse like Chiluo leading them. Yet they fought him to a standstill. It was impossible to tell if he was simply incompetent or holding back his strength, but either way, he was accomplishing nothing.

His survey brought no good news. Worse, the eight-spoked dharma wheel hanging in midair began to flicker erratically before a golden body leaped out from its center.

This new figure was magnificent, a full size larger than Chiluo, and radiated a dazzling light. Its face was a mask of savagery, and it clutched two charred, broken clubs.

'What now?!'

Li Ximing was stunned. The three he was already facing had pushed him to his limit. If another one joined the fray, his life would be in genuine danger. He swept his spiritual sense over the newcomer and frowned, his feelings a mixture of relief and dread.

The new arrival, for all its ferocious appearance, was wreathed in flames and howling in agony. The fire coiled around its golden body in two distinct layers: one of deep azure, the other a vibrant blue.

The moment he saw those flames, Chiluo looked as if he might leap out of his skin. His face turned ugly. And if others could see it clearly, how could Li Ximing not? He had wielded that fire himself—it was Tinglan's Immeasurable Water and Fire!

His heart filled with both joy and worry. He was glad that Tinglan seemed to be holding her own inside the formation, but he was deeply concerned that this powerhouse of a Merciful One was now his problem.

The hulking creature’s face was ashen, but as it took in the battlefield, its eyes fell upon the man in white and gold. After a brief pause, it kicked off the air and transformed into a storm of golden sand, hurtling toward him.

'He knows a movement technique... completely different from Chiluo.'

A chill shot down Li Ximing’s spine. Ignoring the turmoil in his spiritual energy, he forced his power. Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light and his Purple Mansion Realm True Fire erupted forth as he re-manifested his divine ability, suppressing the churning in his core. The Bright Yang rose high, and he finally reseated himself within its light.

But before Audience with the Celestial Gate could fully stabilize, the treasured light from Pingling shot toward him. Pingling might not have been the strongest, but he had the keen eyes of a Merciful One. He had waited for the precise instant Li Ximing manifested his ability to strike.

This time, however, Li Ximing’s Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass was already glowing. The thick ring of white runes around its edge spun, separating into four distinct circles. As the outermost ring dimmed, he inverted the compass. Four points of golden light detached once more. Though dimmer than before, they formed an inverted celestial image: Heavenly Radiance above, the Yang Pole below.

The brilliant light in the sky instantly converged. Audience with the Celestial Gate dissolved into a shimmering, colorful haze. The sky flashed as four golden stars rose, dragging trails of light behind them. They drew in all the surrounding Profound Light, plunging the world into an artificial twilight.

The treasured light from Pingling’s third eye slammed into the four stars and was halted for a barest fraction of a second. The stars pulsed, as if taking a breath, and then detonated.

*Clang!*

A cascade of Profound Light, fluid as water, poured down. While it lacked the overwhelming force of the Bright Yang's destructive light, it carried a limpid, binding quality that swept across the field. It not only forced the hulking Merciful One out of his sand form but also brought all four of his attackers to a stunned halt.

Li Ximing flickered, reappearing a short distance away. Before he could even think of summoning Audience with the Celestial Gate again, he sensed a change. His gaze hardened as he stared at the space before him.

A single, small, eight-sided snowflake drifted down, spinning gently in the air.

He raised his eyes. Snow was falling across the entire mountain range, slowly blanketing the landscape in white. A wave of pure terror washed over him, his mind going blank for a second before realization flooded back.

'No pine scent! Thank goodness, no pine scent...'

Across Xiaoshi Mountain, every cultivator looked up, their faces etched with surprise. The eight-spoked dharma wheel in the sky, finally unable to bear the strain, emitted a series of sharp cracks. A bitter cold swept across Xiaoshi Mountain, carried on a howling wind.

The dharma wheel dimmed to its faintest point before erupting in a violent torrent of white snow. The deluge escalated at a terrifying rate, becoming an avalanche that formed a towering pillar of light and snow. A final, sorrowful cry echoed through the air.

*Crack!*

The radiant light of the formation was suppressed and scattered. From within the snow, a soaring killing intent, born from Cold Qi condensed to its absolute limit, surged forth. The sky filled with countless iridescent clouds, and a towering golden body manifested—a majestic Dharma Body covered in a dense pattern of innumerable eyes.

"Zhelu!"

The foremost master of the Way of Emptiness, a true Buddhist cultivator who had attained the rank of Maha and sat upon the Buddhist Land, had appeared. His presence was immense, his power overwhelming. He was clearly unharmed. As he manifested, an infinite rain of lotus blossoms fell around him, followed by the appearance of one Merciful One after another.

Beneath Zhelu's golden form, nestled in the falling snow, stood a small purple pavilion. Inside, a celestial maiden with a tight frown and blood at the corner of her lips held a sword pointed toward the sky.

The sword was pure white. It had a long blade and a short, square, unadorned hilt that was barely thicker than the blade itself. One side was etched with the emblem of Profound Snow and the Supreme Yin ascending the cosmos; the other depicted the scene of autumn yielding to winter, a harmony of heaven and earth. As its light pulsed, an indomitable killing intent soared into the heavens.

'A Purple Mansion Realm spirit sword!'

Seeing this, how could Li Ximing not guess the sword's origin?

'That's the Azure Pond Sect's legendary blade, Great Snow's Severing Edge! She must have used its power to shatter the formation from within!'

When Great Snow's Severing Edge first became famous, the Li family hadn't even settled at Moongaze Lake; his ancestors were still wandering who-knows-where. Back then, the sword had a different name, but it was already known as the Azure Pond Sect Master's ultimate treasure, one of the most renowned spirit swords in the world. Legend said that after the chaos at Moongaze Lake, it had gained some immense benefit, unlocking countless new wonders, and was thereafter known as Great Snow's Severing Edge.

By the time the Li family rose to prominence, the sword hadn't been seen for years, yet its legend persisted throughout the lands of Wu and Yue. Even common rogue cultivators knew its name.

This was the first time Li Ximing had ever seen the spirit sword. The sheer killing intent and spiritual snow radiating from it told him this was an incredible spiritual artifact, perhaps the finest he had ever witnessed. But he was no sword fanatic. Instead of getting lost in admiration, his eyes darted around at the growing number of Merciful Ones, some in good shape, others battered. He immediately turned his attention back to the immediate threat.

In the midst of the chaos, he saw Chiluo’s eyes light up with feverish greed. The Merciful One’s gaze swept the field and landed on a new golden body descending through the snow. This one had three eyes on its face and two more on its chest. Its numerous arms were arranged around its body like the petals of a lotus, and the light fortifying it was exceptionally potent. Its aura seemed even a fraction stronger than Chiluo's.

His eyes gleamed. He let out a great roar.

"Five-Eyes! Quickly, join me! We'll kill this remnant of the Wei-Li!"

The situation was now painfully clear. With the Wisdom-Void Demon-Subduing Grand Formation broken, and with Tinglan and her companion wielding the Immeasurable Water and Fire, the Buddhist cultivators wouldn't dare press them to the point of death and risk them unleashing the full power of their Supreme Yang heritage. Even in their weakened state, escaping would be easy for them.

For the Merciful Ones, the most valuable and most vulnerable target on the field was now, without a doubt, Li Ximing.

The newly arrived five-eyed Merciful One, his hands arranged like a wondrous lotus, had just set foot on the ground when he heard Chiluo’s cry. He looked up, stunned, his gaze falling on Li Ximing in the distance. He felt as if he’d been struck by lightning. His legs went weak.

'Oh, gods... it's him! The one from the Immortal Clan at Moongaze Lake!'

Ever since he’d been captured by that Immortal Lord, he, Five-Eyes, had been living the life of a rat. For centuries, he had done as he pleased on his own territory. But now? Now he couldn't even leave his temple! He was too scared to even collect rent from his tenants.

He was keenly aware of the sins his disciples had committed over the years and had started finding any excuse to execute them, leading everyone to believe he'd become unpredictable and cruel. He spent his nights tossing and turning, unable to find a moment's peace.

'Who? Li Ximing? He wants me to kill *Li Ximing*?! That animal! If he wants to get himself killed, fine, but he wants to drag me down with him?!'

He was beside himself with rage and panic, a storm of emotions churning within him. His face twisted into a mask of furious, bulging-eyed savagery. It was genuine, heartfelt rage, but Chiluo mistook it for a display of divine power. Thrilled to have found a kindred spirit, he cried out, "Excellent!"

Li Ximing had been watching the entire exchange. With the Merciful Ones just arriving and still disoriented, and with his own escape secured by the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, his first instinct was to flee into the Great Void.

These new arrivals were every bit as dangerous as Chiluo. If they surrounded him, he wouldn't just be injured; he could be targeted and finished off by Taixi and the others. But most of them were still afflicted by the Immeasurable Water and Fire. As long as that flame burned on their bodies, entering the Great Void would be suicide. They would never be able to follow him.

But the moment he slipped into the Great Void, before he even had a chance to recover, his vision filled with light.

A middle-aged man stood there, clad in Daoist robes, his hair and beard streaked with gray. He held a sword to his chest, his gaze as sharp as its edge. A black talisman was tied to his waist, shrouding him in a dark, cloying mist that made him nearly impossible to detect.

'Senior Lingmei!'

Li Ximing was overjoyed, but he saw at once that the kindness and courtesy the Daoist Master of the Sword Gate had shown him in the past were gone. His eyes were now filled with killing intent. He shook his head slowly at Li Ximing, one hand already gripping his sword's hilt, waiting.

Only an instant passed before a magnificent, multicolored light pursued Li Ximing into the void. It expanded dramatically, crossing the roiling expanse of the Great Void to reveal an enormous golden body. Its long, horse-like face and black, empty eyes were especially terrifying in this empty space.

It was Taixi... and judging by his speed, this had been planned all along.

The shimmering, golden-tinged light seemed to have eyes of its own as it descended directly upon Li Ximing, revealing within it a densely patterned, demon-subduing lotus.

The Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions!

From start to finish, Taixi had been playing his own game, his focus clearly fixed on Li Ximing all along. He had wanted him dead from the beginning. Now, with the battlefield in chaos, the Maha hadn't waited for the other Merciful Ones. He had lain in wait within the Great Void, his Treasured Artifact fully charged.

*Clang!*

At that exact moment, Lingmei, positioned behind Li Ximing, finally let out a cold sneer and flicked his wrist. A surge of golden energy and a lattice of cold light erupted. As if in response to the falling snow and the purple pavilion in the mortal world, a vast, stark-white tide of sword light flared to life in the Great Void.

The Sword Gate was the foremost offensive branch of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and Lingmei was the Sword Gate’s greatest swordsman. Though worldly affairs in his youth had prevented him from mastering sword intent, his skill with sword arts and divine abilities was second to none. He had been preparing this strike for who knows how long. Li Ximing's vision was consumed by white light as a crisp, clear, and melodious sword hum filled his ears.

*Omm...*



# Chapter 866: Return to the Mountain

"Five-Eyed! What in the world are you doing!"

Chiluo could have never imagined this. The Merciful One before him, whose back shimmered with hands like a blooming lotus, stood frozen in the air, a furious expression on his face but utterly motionless.

The Immeasurable Water and Fire on Five-Eyed had long been extinguished, and his aura was at eighty or ninety percent of its peak—he was in the best condition among all the Merciful Ones present. Yet the old fool refused to move a muscle.

"You—"

Before Chiluo could finish his curse, the Great Void trembled. A deafening roar, like a clap of thunder, exploded by his ear.

"ROAR—"

On Xiaoshi Mountain, the assembled Buddhist cultivators looked up. The sky was tearing apart, riddled with black fractures of all sizes that connected to the Great Void. Dazzling golden qi mixed with a treasured glow shot forth, transforming into swaying pink lotuses and a fine shower of golden sand as it entered the mortal world.

A bright golden streak of light escaped from mid-air. Amidst the scattering petals and sand, the intricately patterned Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions circled with a sorrowful cry, its form especially stark against the white snow. Chiluo stared, dumbfounded, and cried out in horror, "Taixi is wounded!"

That single streak of light seemed to signal the collapse of the entire battlefield. The purple immortal pavilion floating in the sky grew brighter. A middle-aged man with salt-and-pepper hair stood upon it, positioned just in front of the Autumn Lake Fairy, Ning Wan.

And the Purple Mansion Realm spirit sword—snow-white, its body etched with the profound snows of the Supreme Yin, its surface depicting the passage of autumn into winter—was now in the middle-aged man’s hand.

‘Lingmei!’

Daoist Master Lingmei of the Sword Gate! Lingmei, wielding the Great Snow's Severing Edge!

The difference between the Great Snow's Severing Edge in Ning Wan's hands versus Lingmei's was like that between heaven and earth. The Buddhist Land in the sky vanished almost instantly. The rainbow lights, the treasured thrones, the golden bodies—they all fled faster than they had arrived, leaving behind nothing but the gently falling snow.

Only now did Chiluo belatedly understand Five-Eyed's inaction. Lingmei must have used Li Ximing as bait, wounding Taixi and his Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions with the very first strike. If he, Chiluo, had been the target, he might not have even had the chance to escape back to the Buddhist Land!

For centuries, he and Five-Eyed had been at odds, yet today, he owed his life to the other's caution. A complex feeling washed over him as he fled into the Great Void.

‘How cunning. They say the old fool has been moody and unpredictable lately, even harming his own disciples. This is hardly the behavior of a senile man… he’s only getting craftier… He must be plotting for the next Maha position in the Way of Emptiness…’

He didn't know that Five-Eyed was just as terrified, his limbs weak with fear. Not daring to look back, his mind racing with scattered thoughts, he scrambled into the Great Void. The other Merciful Ones scattered like startled birds, each fleeing for their lives.

Who would dare to stay? Hadn't they seen Zhelu dissipate his own Buddhist Land? That Maha only remained to prevent the complete annihilation of the Merciful Ones from the Way of Emptiness! Otherwise, against a Supreme Yang Daoist tradition Daoist Master of the Metal Virtue, wielding a famous Purple Mansion Realm spirit sword with a reputation built over centuries, it would likely cost several Golden Lotus Seats their lives to appease him.

At the same time, the grim, black-robed Daoist Master Luo was also fleeing in terror. The moment he saw Lingmei, he felt half his life drain away. Pushing his divine abilities to their limit, he abandoned all thoughts of claiming credit and simply ran.

The snowfall intensified. The Maha Zhelu was now clearly on guard. The thousand eyes on his body blinked in unison as pink and golden light converged. Daoist Master Kui Qi’s expression relaxed as he landed beside the purple pavilion, standing with his sword cradled in his arms.

Zhelu was obviously different from Taixi. His golden body was profound and majestic, reaching to the heavens. His voice, like thunder, boomed down from the heavy clouds.

"So, it is fellow Daoist Lingmei. Seeing such a divine ability of the Sword Dao, this one mistook you for Lou Xing."

Lingmei remained silent, but golden qi began to gather on his blade. The Great Snow's Severing Edge hadn't been in the hands of a supreme sword cultivator for many years, and it now pulsed with a faint light, as if trembling with excitement.

At the mention of Lou Xing's name, a cold glint flashed in Daoist Master Kui Qi's eyes. He was not a patient man. How could he possibly restrain himself? He opened his mouth and cursed, "Old bald donkey, who do you think you're fooling! If my Great Daoist Master were here, would you dare show even half of that shiny head of yours? If you’re going to scram, then do it!"

"Back when my Great Daoist Master roamed unchallenged with his sword, did you, Zhelu, dare to even breathe a word against him? My Great Daoist Master goes into seclusion for a few years, and suddenly you crawl out to bark!"

A sneer spread across Kui Qi's face as he spoke fearlessly. "If you push us southern cultivators too far, I’d like to see if it’s your golden body that shatters first!"

Kui Qi’s tirade was cathartic. Lingmei’s brow relaxed, and even Ning Wan, who had been besieged within her formation for days, felt a sense of relief despite her usually reserved nature. She silently consumed a medicinal pill.

Li Ximing emerged from the Great Void and supported Chen Yin, who was hovering in mid-air. The Chen Clan ancestor's face was ashen; his injuries were clearly not light. Without hesitation, Li Ximing retrieved a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill from his sleeve, pressed it into Chen Yin's hand, and said in a low voice, "Rest easy, elder. This pill was refined by the Pristine Water lineage and excels at healing injuries and regulating qi… it’s a perfect match for your divine ability. Take it quickly."

Though both were Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters, Chen Yin's lack of quality pills was obvious compared to someone like Li Ximing. The others were from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and certainly didn't lack for good things. In truth, he was in the most dire straits, and he quickly accepted the pill with a word of thanks.

High above, Zhelu remained unperturbed by the verbal assault. His tone was calm, clear, and resonant. "Though this one is no match for him, I would be endlessly grateful and overjoyed for the opportunity to receive pointers from fellow Daoist Lou Xing…"

Daoist Master Lingmei had, after all, not yet crossed into the Purple Mystery. Though Zhelu was wary of him holding the spirit sword, he certainly didn't fear him as he would the Great Daoist Master Lou Xing. Lingmei regarded him with cold eyes and said softly, "There's no need to trouble my elder. I will be your opponent."

The moment his words fell, Zhelu had already vanished into the Great Void. Kui Qi on the purple immortal pavilion disappeared at the same instant. The radiance over Xiaoshi Mountain faded, and dark clouds once again blanketed the sky. The world grew dim, leaving only a thick layer of snow on the ground.

The spectral light of the Great Snow's Severing Edge pierced the Great Void, shifting into myriad forms. Soft moonlight and chilling radiance instantly submerged the absolute blackness.

The Great Void was supposed to be empty, yet now even the darkness receded like a tide. Zhelu's golden body was terrifyingly massive. A thousand arms extended from his back, each with an eye in its palm, creating an image that was at once regal and grotesque.

The thousands of eyes opened in unison, each pupil a shade of bluish-black. With the slightest movement, they shot out streams of pink light, fanning out like a peacock's tail in a dazzling display.

Daoist Master Lingmei unleashed but a single sword strike.

The strike flowed with white snow and reflected the autumn light, surging upstream against the endless river of pink radiance, aiming straight for Zhelu's face. In an instant, the Great Void thundered, exploding in a flash of infinite brilliance.

With such a great battle erupting in the Great Void, feedback rippled across the mortal world. Layers of golden snow drifted through the air, dissipating before they could touch the ground. The few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators present all wore looks of astonishment.

‘What magnificent sword light!’

Being so close to the Buddhist cultivators from the north was already extremely dangerous. With Lingmei and Zhelu fighting in the Great Void, the others naturally had to leave quickly. Li Ximing glanced around before flying his light closer. Aboard the purple immortal pavilion, Ning Wan coughed twice, spitting up some blood, which caused a light snow to fall once more over Xiaoshi Mountain. Color, however, gradually returned to her cheeks; she was clearly much better.

Seeing Li Ximing approach, Ning Wan raised a delicate eyebrow and said softly, "Greetings, Zhaojing… Thank you for your help this time."

This was the first time Li Ximing had met her. He politely cupped his hands in response. "It was my duty."

Just then, the purple immortal pavilion at their feet finally transformed, its light scattering until it shrank into a palm-sized replica. Daoist Master Tinglan at last appeared, holding the miniature pavilion in her hand.

The woman's divine abilities and spiritual energy were dim, her face pale and utterly exhausted. Most critically, her foundation seemed to have been shaken. Purple qi bled from her body, and her divine ability flickered unstably. Compared to her, Ning Wan's injuries seemed minor.

Seeing Li Ximing, Tinglan forced herself to rally. Looking somewhat surprised, she exhaled, "We've troubled you all… a special trip all the way from the Eastern Sea for one such as me…"

Li Ximing was more familiar with her than with Ning Wan. Seeing her state, he bowed and replied, "You were trapped, fellow Daoist. It was only natural that we come to your aid!"

Chen Yin was clearly not acquainted with either woman. He simply nodded without a word. The four of them fled into the Great Void, crossed the river, and were escorted all the way to the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. Tinglan consumed another pill and said with her head lowered, "I won't offer empty thanks. My injuries are severe and cannot wait. I will remember this assistance. Allow me to stabilize my divine ability first… I'll leave matters in fellow Daoist Ning's hands for now…"

She took a round, gray-gold formation plate with purple markings, along with a jade slip, from her sleeve and passed them to Ning Wan. Only then did she offer Li Ximing a faint, strained smile. "Regarding your clan's grand formation… do not worry. Daoist Master Ning's talent in the Dao of formations is astonishing. Unlike my own half-baked efforts, her skills will soon surpass mine. Her ideas are more inspired. It is best to entrust it to her."

Ning Wan nodded silently. Having faced death together, she felt a much closer bond with Tinglan and said gently, "I will handle whatever arrangements you've made, sister. Please focus on your recovery."

Tinglan simply held the purple jade pavilion, seemingly using the item to temporarily suppress her injuries, and transformed into a streak of purple qi that flew into the depths of the Blessed Land.

Li Ximing felt a knot of tension loosen in his chest. He figured the matter was more or less concluded.

Without the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, Li Ximing's task would have been incredibly difficult, and injuries would have been certain. Thankfully, the Great Xiukui Monastery had been generous. The only real danger had been Taixi, but that Maha had been driven back by a single slash from Lingmei, allowing Li Ximing to emerge unscathed.

Yet, thinking back on it, he still found it unbelievable. Others might not know, but he, Li Ximing, had witnessed it firsthand.

‘Just one slash…’

Taixi had attacked with his full power, using the renowned Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions. Yet Lingmei's strike had first damaged the Treasured Artifact itself, scarring it and stripping away its radiance, then shattered Taixi's protective aura before delivering a final, decisive blow that sent the Maha fleeing for his life.

Although Lingmei had charged his attack in advance and had the element of surprise, Taixi's Treasured Artifact had also been borrowed. If not for the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions, he probably would have lost his horse-like head…

"Daoist Master Lingmei truly possesses the might of a sword immortal…"

Li Ximing would never believe that the person who unleashed such a strike possessed no Sword Intent. As he voiced his thoughts, Chen Yin, also a sword cultivator, sighed, "Elder Lingmei's cultivation in the Sword Dao has reached the pinnacle of perfection. Even without Sword Intent, his power is enough to command respect. Even the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal of Qize from the Wu State often comes to pay his respects, admitting his own inferiority, and has never gained an advantage in a duel against him."

"To have the might of a sword immortal without possessing Sword Intent… if he were to ever attain it, his current sword light would become… incomparably more terrifying."

Li Ximing nodded in amazement, but a doubt arose in his mind. As they rode the wind over the lake, he asked, "I'm a bit confused. After Sword Origin comes Sword Intent… without achieving Sword Intent, how can one attain Sword Might, which is even higher? It must be that the Sword Gate's sword arts are simply that incredible…"

Chen Yin nodded slightly, apparently sharing the same speculation. Ning Wan, however, had a complex expression, as if she hadn't fully recovered from the siege up north. Hearing Li Ximing's question, she answered listlessly, "Sword Intent must come before the achievement of a Body Divine Ability. Once the Body Divine Ability is formed, no matter how high one's cultivation in the Sword Dao… Sword Intent becomes unattainable… unless one uses that technique from the ancient texts, 'Nurturing the Azure Aether'…"

‘'Nurturing the Azure Aether'… the same technique as the young Sword Immortal King of old…’

Li Ximing finally understood. Pondering this, he continued toward the lake. The three of them emerged from the Great Void and landed on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The mountain was covered in gardenia trees, and pillars of white jade stood or lay scattered about, just as they had been. The ground, however, had been swept clean. The round table and stools were just as he'd left them.

The jade pot had even been filled with fresh, clear water, ready for his return at any moment.

It had been years since Li Ximing had been back. Seeing the familiar scene filled him with emotion. With a wave of his sleeve, he said, "My home is humble. I hope you two don't mind."

The two didn't stand on ceremony and took their seats. As Li Ximing began to brew tea, Ning Wan looked a little uneasy and said with her gaze lowered, "This time… I was only spared serious injury thanks to Senior Tinglan's full protection. But the matters by the river… they are now my responsibility. I'm afraid I will have to trouble Zhaojing for assistance."

"But of course."

Li Ximing still felt a lingering unease. He had played it safe this time and the situation hadn't turned dire, so he was unharmed. But seeing Tinglan's state… even with the Purple Smoke Blessed Land's potent spirit medicines, she would be unable to act for some time. He asked, "How did things escalate to such a point?"

Ning Wan shook her head. "There was unusual activity on Xiaoshi Mountain. Tinglan suspected someone was making a move, but we never thought fate would fall on the side of the Northern Buddhists. We were tricked and ambushed by the Way of Emptiness… We didn't expect the Buddhist cultivators to be able to track our movements, so we were careless."

"Fortunately, we had the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion. A Dharma Treasure of its caliber has profound abilities to defend against enemies. Zhelu was also wary of the trump cards we might hold… and I had the Great Snow's Severing Edge. We originally planned to break out… but Tinglan was worried other Mahas might be waiting outside, that we would be suppressed again immediately after breaking the formation, so we held our position."

"Later, the formation shook several times, and we noticed that many of the Merciful Ones' traces had vanished. We knew reinforcements had arrived, so we finally steeled ourselves and broke through…"

Chen Yin clearly understood the situation and added, "Elder Lingmei was also waiting for the right moment… If he had acted rashly, not only would it have been difficult to ensure our safe retreat, but he would have had a hard time explaining it to his sect… With Daoist Master Ning and the Great Snow's Severing Edge appearing, he had a valid reason to intervene…"

Li Ximing mulled over his words thoughtfully.

Ning Wan said, "I've heard the Sword Gate is exceedingly traditional… Those old masters genuinely wish to withdraw from the world. Unfortunately, the other cultivators can petition Chenghua Hall to use the Sword Codex to restrain them. If Elder Lingmei hadn't stabilized the Cheng family beforehand… he wouldn't have had this much freedom today."

Chen Yin was not part of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, so he remained silent. Li Ximing said even less, simply pouring her tea. After a while, Chen Yin set down his cup and finally spoke.

"Daoist Master Luo from the Southern Borderlands also contributed this time. However, he was fighting a Merciful One just now and may have been injured… He also doesn't trust us very much, so he left first."

Since Chen Yin had invited him, he was obviously entrusted to speak on his behalf. He clearly didn't want to get too involved, but he had followed them all the way to the lake, evidently just to say this.

As expected, Ning Wan frowned, a flicker of doubt in her eyes. "Daoist Master Luo… I have not heard of him…"

Though Chen Yin had to mention him, the man was not a virtuous character, and he was speaking to members of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. He made no effort to cover for him. "You need not worry, Daoist Master Ning. He is no old friend of the Azure Pond Sect. His Daoist tradition is simply incomplete, and he needs to supplement it. He coveted a certain something within the Azure Pond's secret archives, which is why he offered his help."

Ning Wan seemed to be contemplating this. Chen Yin then rose to his feet and said politely, "Now that I have left the Chen Clan and shown myself by the river, there will surely be villains plotting against me. I must return quickly to handle the changing situation, so I will not impose any longer…"

Seeing that he was about to leave, Li Ximing hesitated slightly and asked, "What about Senior Lingmei…"

"No need to worry. Even if that Daoist Master Cheng is focused on his cultivation and hasn't appeared in a long time, he would surely be present for an event of this magnitude… His swordsmanship and cultivation are inferior to Elder Lingmei's, but he is still a high-level cultivator of the Metal Virtue. No harm will come to them…"

Ning Wan also looked up and reminded him, "Among all the sects, the Buddhist cultivators fear the Sword Gate the most. No matter how strong other Daoist traditions are, leaving behind contingencies is not easy. Some predecessors can't even leave anything behind… But Sword Intent can be passed down within a sword, generation after generation… Their hidden reserves are the greatest of all the major powers…"

"Our methods might at most destroy one of his golden bodies. But if the Sword Gate is pushed too far, killing a Maha is not out of the question… and it wouldn't even significantly deplete their foundation."

Chen Yin nodded, sighed, and hurriedly departed with a bow.

With him gone, Ning Wan relaxed considerably. She leaned on the jade table, a trace of exhaustion showing on her face, and said softly, "The Li family hasn't had it easy all these years. If junior brother Chejing were here, he… would be a top figure by now… The Chi family got what they deserved… I warned them long ago. I didn't expect Heyuan to be lost as well."

She was reminiscing. As for whether the Chi family deserved their fate, perhaps Ning Wan thought so, but Li Ximing didn't particularly agree. If Chi Buzi were still in the sect, the Chi family would be living just as freely as before, and he, Li Ximing, would still have to bow his head to Chi Buzi… He replied, "Their luck ran out and their power waned, which coincided with the retaliation from those they ruled. The Ning family is also free now…"

Ning Wan smiled, took a small box from her sleeve, and placed it on the jade table. "It was a lot of trouble for you to make this trip. I'm not very familiar with Senior Chen Yin, so I'll have to pay him a formal visit to thank him later. But between our two families, there's no need for such ceremony… I've delayed your cultivation, making you travel thousands of miles from the Eastern Sea. I must compensate you."

"This is a cultivation resource called the 'Surging Li Treasure Leaf.' It came from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, from a spirit flower that grows beside the Ancient Origin Flower. It is a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation resource of the Li Fire lineage…"

She opened the box. Inside lay a single, long, crimson leaf, curled up within. Its purple-black veins glowed faintly. How could Ning Wan, who had only recently reached the Purple Mansion Realm, have so many fine things? It must have been a legacy from the Ning family's Daoist Master, Yuansu.

‘A Li Fire resource?’

Li Ximing had once received a Horn Wood resource as a gift from the Sword Gate. Purple Mansion Realm resources were not as valuable as true spirit objects, as they were often non-essential parts of Purple Mansion-grade spirit items, but they were still not easy to come by. For Ning Wan to offer this specifically left Li Ximing stunned.

Rescuing Ning Wan was indeed a small favor, but Kui Qi had initiated the effort and had even paid him to help. Ning Wan's gesture was a clear attempt to deepen their ties. She said softly, "Li Fire conflicts with my cultivation, so this item is useless to me. Since Zhaojing is skilled in pill refinement, it will only show its true worth in your hands."

The box felt a little hot in Li Ximing's hands. He could only say, "Thank you for your kind intentions, fellow Daoist, but I cannot accept such a valuable gift. Let us say you've entrusted it to me. If I ever succeed in refining it into a pill, I will send one to you."

After all, anything related to Li Fire was quite valuable to the Li family. Not only did Bright Yang have connections to Li Fire, but Li Jiangqian also cultivated it. There was no way Li Ximing would return it. Ning Wan clearly took his words as polite pleasantries. She nodded slightly and replied, "The situation between the north and south is troublesome right now, and the Buddhist cultivators are trying to interfere. We cannot delay the Purple Mansion Realm grand formation. If we don't establish it, things will become even more difficult later."

"I read the jade slip on the way here. Elder Tinglan's design is ingenious. The most difficult part is these thirty-two Profound Nails. Give me three days. Once we set these thirty-two nails into the island and connect them to the earth veins, we can proceed."

Li Ximing was eager for her to begin. His divine ability was still somewhat turbulent and required slight regulation, but he had already taken a pill, and these things would recover over time. He couldn't be bothered with that now and said seriously, "No matter. I have the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. I can handle connecting to the earth veins. You should restore your spiritual energy first. I will set these Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails!"

For the first time since they'd met, a genuine smile touched Ning Wan's lips. "There's no need to rush, Zhaojing. Sister Tinglan determined the locations several years ago. If the earth veins have shifted at all in that time, the key points will be inaccurate… We should also wait a few days for the two Daoist Masters to arrive. It's best that we all meet."

Ning Wan was clearly quick-witted. After a small laugh, she added, "Besides… Senior Kui Qi also has very high attainments in the Dao of formations. The Great Xiukui Monastery and Hengzhu have complete inheritances; their pills and formations are both strong… That's knowledge from an Immortal Mansion. Just asking him a single question could bring great benefits to your family's formation!"

"Rest assured, I don't need to show him the formation plate. I'll just ask him about the earth vein nodes from his perspective. Once Tinglan's Profound Nails are in place, the earth veins will shift and merge into the formation. We won't have to worry about leaking any secrets…"

Li Ximing nodded inwardly. The woman was very considerate. She was clearly explaining it in a way she assumed a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with little knowledge of formations would understand. He simply nodded as if he understood perfectly.

He then sat cross-legged on a jade pillar. As light and darkness intertwined around him, he could feel the spiritual artifact from the Xiukui, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, in his sleeve. It radiated a faint Bright Yang glow, making his Audience with the Celestial Gate technique even more active.

# Chapter 867: Zhaoguang Xuanzi

Time flowed by on the lake. Li Ximing was merely refining his Divine Abilities, but the hours passed in a flash. When he opened his eyes, Li Jiangqian was already standing in the mountain clearing, his voice respectful.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, the esteemed seniors have arrived together. They are waiting on the island and request your presence."

Li Ximing knew this meant Kui Qi and the others had returned. Beside him, Ning Wan opened her eyes at the same moment. Her expression was gentle as she spoke to him.

"Your clan's upbringing is quite remarkable. The so-called righteous path… it must begin with an upright body before it can lead to an upright heart."

It was only then that Li Ximing remembered Daoist Master Qiuhu cultivated the Serene Listen ability, a Life Divine Ability of Cold Qi. She must not have heard a single disrespectful thought from Li Jiangqian to offer such a compliment. 'But who knows if the Talisman Seed played a part in that?' he thought, not daring to mention it.

He quickly smiled and said, "You flatter me. We shouldn't keep the two seniors waiting."

The two of them transformed, one into a flash of bright light, the other into a swirl of cold qi, reappearing in the island's main hall in the blink of an eye. The once-empty space now held two figures, both of them at the Purple Mansion Realm.

The man in the lead was, of course, Lingmei, his hair and beard streaked with white. He cradled a snow-white spirit sword in his arms as if it were the most precious of treasures. A faint smile touched his lips, his aura was steady, and his Daoist robes flowed as he spoke.

Behind him stood Daoist Master Kui Qi, dressed all in black, nodding slightly. The black cord they had seen before was now tied around his waist. Had one not witnessed the spiritual artifact in action, it would be impossible to guess it was such a precious treasure.

With the arrival of Li Ximing and Ning Wan, the small Pingya Island now hosted four Daoist Masters.

Seeing Li Ximing, Lingmei smiled. "Zhaojing," he said softly, "it has been a long time."

Li Ximing quickly bowed in respect. "Greetings, Senior. I returned from the Eastern Sea in such a hurry that I haven't had the chance to visit the Sword Gate to express my gratitude. Regarding my kinsman, Zhouwei, my clan is endlessly grateful for your sect's timely rescue. If there is ever anything you need in the future, any pills that require refining, you have only to ask."

"You're too polite," Lingmei said, waving his hand dismissively.

Li Ximing gestured for him to take a seat. Kui Qi, however, spoke with a note of regret. "It's a pity. Zhelu has clearly benefited from his gains over the years. His Divine Abilities have grown more refined. We failed to wound him severely this time, only managing to injure a few of his eyes."

Lingmei stroked his beard and picked up the thread. "Although I wield the Great Snow's Severing Edge, challenging him as a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator was pushing my limits. If Senior Lou Xing had been here, empowered by his Sword Intent and wielding this blade, only then could we have truly inflicted a grievous blow upon that man."

The sword cultivator then raised an eyebrow. "Daoist Master Qiuhu… how is Tinglan?"

Ning Wan gave a brief and concise summary of the situation, which seemed to satisfy Lingmei. Meanwhile, Li Ximing reluctantly fiddled with the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass tucked in his sleeve. It wouldn't do to have them ask for such a valuable item directly; that would be unseemly. He took it out, a smile on his face.

"Now that the matter is settled, this spiritual artifact should be returned to its rightful owner."

As he produced the golden compass, Kui Qi nodded with a smile, accepting it. "Zhaojing, you truly are formidable," he praised. "No wonder you could escape from Changxiao's grasp so calmly. But it was only after witnessing your Bright Yang True Fire execute the Merciful One that I understood the true extent of your power."

Li Ximing replied humbly, "I only had the advantage of the Audience with the Celestial Gate suppressing him. I cannot compare to you two seniors."

Kui Qi shook his head, having already formed his own judgment. "Tinglan will be unable to act for some time," he said, his tone serious. "But the situation in the north still needs to be resolved. That being the case, let us all travel to my Xiukui's Tiger's Frontier Mountain and settle this matter first."

He paused, turning his head slightly toward Li Ximing. "It will also be a good opportunity to give you the pills from our vaults."

Ning Wan took the chance to add, "Speaking of which, Sister Tinglan had promised to help the Li clan construct a Purple Mansion Grand Array. The foundations were just laid when this incident interrupted everything. Before she returned to her sect, she entrusted this task to me. Moongaze Lake is near Jiangbei, so this is an urgent matter. I lack the strength to complete it on my own… I was hoping you might take a look, Senior."

"Oh?" Kui Qi chuckled upon hearing this and shook his head. "Of course. We've just returned from a trip to the north; it's only natural that we lend a hand now that we are back at the lake."

Under normal circumstances, hiring Kui Qi would have cost a fortune. But the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was proud, and Xiukui was prouder still. Having just returned from battle as allies, they would never bring up the matter of payment. Ning Wan simply took out a jade slip, sketching the terrain in the air with it as they began a detailed discussion.

"Zhaojing, wait a moment and chat with our senior."

Both of them were highly skilled in the art of formations—one from a deep Daoist tradition, the other a rare talent. As their discussion grew more animated, both found they were gaining insights. No longer content with diagrams, they nodded to Li Ximing and soared into the air to survey the land, seemingly forgetting he was even there.

This left him feeling both flattered and unsure whether to laugh or cry. Lingmei, who had seen it all, sighed with a smile. "Kui Qi sees you as one of his own. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is initially very warm toward its members. If the other sects hadn't strayed from the righteous path over the years, hurting the hearts of Xiukui and Hengzhu… things would not have become so strained."

Li Ximing nodded silently. He had seen Kui Qi's attitude firsthand—he had shown no courtesy even to Daoist Master Luo, who had refined living people, let alone to Azure Pond in the past. It was no wonder their alliance had crumbled.

At this point, a suspicion began to form in Li Ximing’s mind. "Hengzhu…" he asked in a low voice, "was it because of Murong Xia's campaign to the south all those years ago? But why did it escalate to such a degree?"

Lingmei's expression grew complicated. He shook his head. "Zhaojing, you have reached a standing where I can speak freely. Regarding Murong Xia… while Luoxia never issued a direct decree, both Jinyu and Azure Pond gave their approval. The division of Jiangbei was settled… there was no going back. As for Hengzhu… alas…"

The topic clearly agitated Lingmei, causing him a degree of pain. He stroked his beard, unwilling to continue, and changed the subject with a sigh. "Right now, everyone in the north is trying to guess Lou Xing's whereabouts, which is bound to stir up trouble. Although they failed this time, our enemies got a clear look at the full strength the Supreme Yang can muster at a moment's notice. And their only losses were a few of the Merciful Ones. Incidents like this will not cease. Your clan's foundation is not as deep as theirs. Always keep something in reserve, so you can protect your own when the time comes."

For a cultivator of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, Lingmei's words were already a great show of favor. Li Ximing nodded in thanks. "Senior, I will remember your earnest advice. I was wondering, might there be a chance for my clan's disciples to enter your mountain to cultivate?"

The sword cultivator stroked his beard. "The customs of my Sword Gate are deeply ingrained," he said softly. "We can make small changes, but we cannot alter our fundamental principles. If your clan sends a disciple to learn the sword, my gate will welcome them. However… the child must be sent to us at the age of six and must sever all worldly ties, making the pursuit of virtue their highest duty."

This was tantamount to sending one of his clan’s disciples away forever. They might even receive fewer resources due to the sect's customs, and the family sending spirit items to the sect would be a source of gossip. Li Ximing was naturally unwilling. After a brief pause, he smiled and nodded in acknowledgment just as Ning Wan descended from the sky.

She first bowed to Lingmei, then smiled at Li Ximing. "Zhaojing, the thirty-two Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails have been positioned. Come and take a look."

Overjoyed, Li Ximing immediately soared into the air. He looked around and saw towering pillars of purplish-gold erected all over Pingya Island. Each one was as thick as a house, reaching for the heavens and shimmering with an intertwining purple and yellow light.

It was morning, and a white mist was rising. The pillars, near and far, were half-hidden in the hazy dawn, creating an ethereal sight. The Li clan cultivators standing on the island were all struck with awe. One or two of the bolder ones had already taken to the air, flying around the forest of colossal purplish-gold columns.

The intricate, purplish-gold patterns on the pillars shone in the air, their light casting down on the immortal pavilions below and making them seem small and insignificant. The serene atmosphere of Pingya Island was transformed by the presence of these profound pillars into something mysterious and majestic. Its former immortal air was now imbued with a solemn, noble, and enigmatic presence.

Even before the formation was complete, the mere sight of the thirty-two pillars standing tall earned Li Ximing's sincere admiration.

Ning Wan’s voice was gentle. "Of these thirty-two pillars, sixteen are on the island, and sixteen are in the surrounding lake. The ones on the island are currently resting on the surface. They are one hundred and eighty *ren* tall, but once driven into the ground, their heights will vary. The tallest, at the island's center, will have one hundred and sixty *ren* exposed. The surrounding pillars will be progressively shorter, their height also adjusted according to the earth veins. The overall light of the formation should form a protective dome."

"The remaining sixteen are in the surrounding lake, enclosing a large portion of its surface, with most of them visible above the water. These thirty-two Profound Nails are the focal points where the Purple Mansion Grand Array will gather spirit qi. In the future, you can also build pavilions and other structures upon them."

"Your clan is on an island rather than a mountain, so Sister Tinglan's design is especially precise. It's rare to see such a perfect dome shape… it's a specialty of her Purple Smoke sect."

The Purple Smoke's own Blessed Land was not built on a mountain, making its layout somewhat similar to Pingya Island. Li Ximing knew he had made the right choice in seeking out Tinglan. Of course, his island's area and especially its height couldn't compare to a true Blessed Land. Pingya Island was quite flat, with only a slight rise in the middle. The addition of the one-hundred-and-sixty-*ren* pillar would give it a total height of about one hundred and twenty *zhang*.

This was a respectable, if not exceptional, height—roughly one-fifth that of Xiaoshi Mountain in the north. Although Li Ximing felt it was a little low, it was to be expected since he didn't possess a true immortal mountain. He nodded repeatedly in satisfaction.

Ning Wan then said, "The pillars in the lake have already been driven down, and the earth veins on the island have been mapped. Senior Kui Qi is holding the pillars in place with his great power. As soon as you give the word and the people on the island are evacuated, we can set the formation!"

Li Ximing was amazed at the efficiency of the two Purple Mansion cultivators. He immediately summoned Li Jiangqian and told him to clear the island. He nodded to himself. 'Good thing the existing arrays on the island were simple placeholders with little defensive power. That's why our people have been cultivating in seclusion at Qingdu. Otherwise, this impact would have caused some serious problems for them.'

Seeing the Li family members evacuating with a mixture of excitement and trepidation, Li Jiangqian returned to report. Ning Wan smiled. "I'm afraid your previous formations are about to be smashed to pieces."

Li Ximing couldn't care less about those old things now. Besides, there was no sense in making Kui Qi hold the pillars aloft while he sent his own people to dismantle the old arrays. He waved his hand dismissively. With a flick of her sleeve, Ning Wan sent a plume of Cold Qi shooting toward the heavens.

High above, Kui Qi formed a seal with his hands and then released it. The thirty-two pillars instantly erupted in a dazzling display of purplish-yellow light. The earth veins opened, and torrents of black Baleful Earth qi surged skyward. But just as they appeared, the thirty-two behemoths crashed down.

**BOOM!**

The tallest Profound Nail in the center of the lake burst with an incandescent purplish-yellow light. A dome of purple expanded outward from the center, covering the sky in every direction before descending with a thunderous roar. Simultaneously, threads of yellow light spread like the veins of a leaf across the inner surface of the purple dome, swiftly illuminating the node corresponding to each Profound Nail.

The connection between the Great Void and the mortal world was gradually severed. The profound mechanisms of the Purple Mansion Grand Array activated, separating the space within from the space without. The mystical canopy of purple and yellow flashed to its brightest point before finally fading to transparency.

*Crash...*

With the shift in the earth veins, all the independent formations within the pavilions and courtyards failed. The houses and courtyards on the island shattered like paper windows in the face of the tremor, leaving only the sky-piercing Profound Pillars standing, emitting a soft, dusky yellow glow.

'The Purple Mansion Grand Array is complete!' Li Ximing's heart surged with excitement and awe.

Ning Wan listened to the gasps of wonder and cheers of joy coming from the shores, a gentle smile gracing her lips. She bowed. "Congratulations, Zhaojing!"

"Congratulations, Zhaojing!" Kui Qi descended from the sky with a hearty laugh, the magical radiance around him slightly dimmed, a clear sign of his exertion. After all the work they had put in, Li Ximing quickly returned the bow with a smile. "This is all thanks to my two fellow Daoists!"

Ning Wan smiled back at him. "This formation… Sister Tinglan never gave it a specific name. Please, Zhaojing, name it yourself."

Li Ximing was in high spirits. He pondered for a moment, gazed around, and then stroked his beard. "Let it be called… the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array."

The name was not chosen at random. The grand arrays of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition all had four-character names, followed by the words "Spirit Array." He saw no need to deviate. Soaring into the air, he landed on the platform atop the highest pillar.

The platform was covered in dense, gray-gold runes. The array core had clearly been integrated into these sigils, irretrievable to anyone below the Purple Mansion Realm. With a slight wave of his sleeve, Li Ximing used his Divine Ability to refine the grand array, making it his own.

Ning Wan spoke softly. "The array core is on this tallest Profound Pillar. If you need access tokens, you can inscribe them yourself. The array has the fundamental ability of a Purple Mansion Grand Array to isolate a space from the Great Void. Following the custom of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, it is divided into two layers, an inner and an outer, which are not connected. The inner array is no larger than a single palace chamber, suitable for storing treasures. The outer array is for the disciples to use."

"The array itself has two mystical functions. The first is Mountain's Anchor, which can stabilize the earth veins and gather spirit qi. Because of its powerful control over the earth veins, the thirty-two separated pillars can be used to create thirty-two different kinds of treasured grounds for cultivating disciples."

Li Ximing knew exactly where this function, so incompatible with Purple Qi and Bright Yang, had come from, and he sighed inwardly.

Ning Wan continued, "The second is Purple Visage. The thirty-two pillars can release their spirit light in concert, drawing upon the reserves in your treasury and the spirit qi on the island to create the Broad Valley Purple Visage Light for defense. As for its power… it is decent, but not exceptional."

She added thoughtfully, "This function was modified by Sister Tinglan. She followed her own inclinations… and had some very creative ideas for several of the nodes. But while it gained the Broad Valley Purple Visage Light, these changes also meant sacrificing a number of other defensive abilities."



# Chapter 868: Shichuan

When Li Ximing had first designed the grand formation with Tinglan, he had proposed modifying Profound Peak's own formation disk. The brilliant display before them was clearly Tinglan’s handiwork. Changxi's grand formation belonged to the Earth-elemental path, specializing in defense; it would never have produced such a radiant spectacle on its own.

Ning Wan must have noticed that the modifications didn't perfectly align with the original Earth-elemental patterns on the disk. A glimmer of understanding crossed her face, but she knew better than to comment on it. Instead, she answered, “There’s a main command token refined by Tinglan within the formation. Zhaojing summon it with your divine ability.”

Li Ximing understood perfectly. He gently raised his hand, and a lattice of golden light flickered into existence across the sky. A moment later, a purple token with yellow patterns, about eight inches long, descended into his palm.

He was quite satisfied with the formation. As he took out a jade talisman and began engraving it with his divine ability to communicate with the array, he mused to himself.

'Changxi's gate was a poor one, built from nothing. Its only real asset was its unique dharma arts, which allowed it to accumulate some wealth. The most valuable thing in all of Profound Peak was the mountains they moved, year after year… Their formation disk was never very good to begin with, and it certainly couldn't compare to those of the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions. This current state is passable enough.'

After all, when Yehui had come knocking all those years ago, the Profound Peak Gate's grand formation had shown no reaction whatsoever, let alone emitted any kind of spiritual light.

Li Ximing's mood was excellent. He then noticed Kui Qi slowly surveying the area from mid-air before giving a slight nod. This Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery was more direct than Lingmei and Ning Wan. He offered few congratulations, instead saying softly, “Zhaojing, if you ever need to construct another grand formation, you can come find me at Tiger's Frontier.”

All over the island, the Purple Gen Broad Valley Pillars now pulsed with a faint glow. The sky above seemed clear, yet it held the surrounding cultivators in place, preventing them from taking a single step. Li Ximing finished carving the jade talisman, encoding it with permission to enter and exit the formation’s perimeter. He then summoned Li Jiangqian and casually handed it to him.

“For now, I'm leaving matters on the lake to you. These pillars are protected by the power of a Purple Mansion Realm grand formation to prevent internal sabotage, making them difficult to approach. Your first task is to plan the layout of the surrounding area. I will be back soon.”

Although Pingya Island was a ruin, such matters could be left to Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan without further instruction. He couldn't keep the other Daoist Masters waiting. Li Ximing made a gesture of invitation, and the four of them pierced through the Great Void, flying toward the domain of the Great Xiukui Monastery.

Traversing the Great Void with Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities was astonishingly fast. Even with Jiangnan’s vibrant spiritual energy making the Great Void more perilous, their speed was incredible. They landed among the temples and palaces atop the Tiger's Frontier summit, where several Foundation Establishment Realm disciples were sweeping snow from a long staircase winding up the white-blanketed mountain.

The snowfall seemed to quicken in Ning Wan’s presence. Li Ximing glanced down the long steps on the mountainside and saw Cui Jueyin still waiting at the bottom. The man stood respectfully amid the vast whiteness, likely not having moved for days, a mere thumb-sized black dot among the great mounds of snow.

“Zhaojing!” Ning Wan called out.

Li Ximing took a seat and accepted a cup of tea. Kui Qi, with his sharp eyes, had obviously noticed the scene below. He shook his head with a chuckle. “After all these years, the Cui family is still the same… It’s a pity. After crossing the sea several times, their courage was slowly broken. You rarely see anyone from the Purple Mansion Realm on Chongzhou Island anymore. After all, they all seek the path of Bright Yang. How can one attain such a righteous Dao when they harbor guilt and fear toward it? They might as well cultivate something else…”

Li Ximing sighed inwardly, unsure how to respond. Kui Qi’s words were perhaps just a passing lament, but Lingmei sensed Li Ximing’s awkwardness. He inverted the Great Snow's Severing Edge in his hand and passed it to Ning Wan.

“I was fortunate to hold such a fine spirit sword,” he said. “My thanks to Daoist Master Qiuhu.”

Though Ning Wan hadn't feared that Lingmei would keep the sword, she felt a wave of relief as her fingers closed around the hilt. She accepted it with thanks. Kui Qi gave a few quiet instructions to an attendant, dismissing them, before his expression turned serious.

“The situation in Jiangbei is our most urgent concern. With Tinglan injured, the Purple Smoke blessed land cannot be mobilized, and Zhu Gong's whereabouts are unknown. Daoist Master Qiuhu, I’m afraid we must rely on you to oversee matters along the river.”

“After all, Serene Listen is a Life Divine Ability. For now, you are the only one we can depend on.”

Ning Wan seemed to have anticipated this. “I don't mind shouldering the responsibility,” she replied softly, “but I haven’t possessed my divine ability for long. It will be difficult to influence events on the other side. If the north plans any schemes, I won’t be able to hold out for long on my own.”

“Those monks and their undying ambitions!” Kui Qi sighed, a flicker of displeasure finally showing. “Zhelu won't dare cause trouble for a while. Be cautious when you are alone, and don’t venture too far. There’s nothing those bald donkeys can do then. With Zhaojing here on our side of the river, reinforcements are always ready.”

He then turned specifically to Li Ximing. “Zhaojing, you need not get too involved. You have only just returned to the mainland, and you must be wary of others plotting against you. Stay out of the True Monarch’s affairs; just keep an eye on the Northern Buddhists’ movements.”

“Besides, your Audience with the Celestial Gate is incredibly useful. Should anything happen, we will arrive quickly. Just be sure not to stray too far from Jiangnan.”

“Understood!” Li Ximing had no intention of meddling and agreed without hesitation.

Lingmei’s expression was placid. He took a sip of tea and added quietly, “The Azure Pond Sect still has the Great Konghai Temple to contend with in the Southern Sea. Although Daoist Master Zhusheng and that Snow Ridge Listening Pine Fox have managed the situation, Daoist Master Qiuhu is stretched thin. Zhaojing, if you are able, lend them a hand to prevent any mishaps.”

Ning Wan’s voice was gentle. “If it’s possible… that would be for the best. I have already sent a sliver of my divine ability there.”

Li Ximing looked up, a hint of confusion on his face. Lingmei explained in a low voice, “The Great Konghai Temple seized the Southern Sea before Daoist Master Qiuhu could intervene. Two Daoist Masters from the Southern Borderlands stepped in, acting out of their respect for Daoist Master Yuanxiu. One cultivates ‘Jade True,’ which can make illusions real, while the other, a demon, cultivates Cold Qi, which blocked that Baoqing. When the Maha sensed something was amiss, he immediately retreated.”

“The master of the Konghai Temple was satisfied with taking the Southern Sea. But Baoqing has both a fated connection and a personal grudge with the Three Yuans. He will certainly return for revenge…”

Lingmei seemed lost in thought. “Although that demon beast’s words were harsh, this fated connection cannot be so easily severed…”

The sword cultivator’s expression grew complex. “You have only seen Yuanwu in his decrepit old age,” he said softly. “In his youth, he was the very picture of arrogance. As the eldest disciple-brother of the Three Yuans, he wore iron-winged silver robes, carried the All-Encompassing Pagoda, and wore boots of embroidered black silk. In front of hundreds of cultivators at Shitang, he stomped on another man’s face, trying to force him to admit that the Shi were inferior to Immortals.”

“Yuansu and Yuanxiu were already at loggerheads then, on the verge of becoming enemies. Baoqing had the misfortune of stumbling into him at that moment. Yuanxiu even made the jest, ‘One Talisman is Enough,’ before using his golden talisman to smash Baoqing to death. If the master of the Konghai Temple hadn't personally come to the rescue, with Yuansu also there, Baoqing wouldn't have even had the chance to reincarnate.”

Beside them, Kui Qi’s brows were tightly furrowed, but he could only sigh. “Though I dislike Yuanwu, that act was truly satisfying. My master, Great Daoist Master Lou Xing, even praised him for it. I suppose arrogant men are kindred spirits; it’s why Yuanwu ended up associating with Situ Tang.”

Li Ximing’s memories of Yuanwu were faint, mostly connected to his subordinate, Yu Muxian. In those days, Yuanwu and the Tang family had placed immense pressure on the Li Clan. He never imagined the man had been so brazen in his youth. “Year after year,” he sighed, “so many geniuses rise and fall.”

Kui Qi glanced aside, where a woman was ascending through the snow, carrying a black treasure box.

He took the box and placed it in front of Li Ximing with a smile. “This is a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, a treasure from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. It is the same spirit pill that Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm cultivators once took. My ancestor examined it and confirmed that this pill can repair one’s Dharma body, suffusing it with light. It is exceptionally useful for comprehension, healing, and cultivation.”

“However, this pill focuses on gentle nourishment. Its strength lies in its steady, continuous effect, making it unsuitable for use during combat. Zhaojing, you must be mindful of this.”

Li Ximing nodded eagerly. He was not lacking for combat-oriented pills at the moment and was overjoyed by the gift. He gently took the box and opened it to find three golden pills resting inside. Each was traced with white, qilin-like patterns. Though many years had passed, they had been so well-preserved that they still brimmed with spiritual energy, looking quite extraordinary.

“The alchemy of Eastern Fire was truly remarkable… It possesses a unique magnificence…”

As Li Ximing spoke his admiration, Ning Wan, having seen Kui Qi present the pills, paused for a moment before adding softly, “Speaking of which… I heard from my ancestors that within the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, there grew a spirit flower known as ‘Yearly it blooms and withers, its fallen petals become armored insects.’ It was obtained by Daoist Master Qiushui and is now in the possession of the Golden Feather Sect. There is also an alchemical text, the ‘Radiant Qilin Refining Art,’ which I believe corresponds to this very Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill.”

Li Ximing listened with rapt attention. The fall of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven had scattered countless extraordinary Bright Yang treasures, yet his clan had not received a single share. He couldn't help but ask, “There were many Bright Yang spiritual artifacts in the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. Do any of you know how they were divided? Which sects ended up with them? I still lack a suitable spiritual artifact since my breakthrough and should acquire one.”

Kui Qi seemed to have anticipated the question. “During the Eastern Fire incident, I was in the Great Void protecting my comrades and did not participate personally, so I received little,” he said softly. “The main beneficiaries were the Golden Feather and Azure Pond Sects. Mount Changhuai, the Purple Smoke Gate, the Chunyi Dao Gate, and the Chen Clan also gained something. Profound Peak and Crimson Reef Island controlled a few of the sea entrances, so they collected some scraps.”

Most of the names were expected, but the inclusion of the Chunyi Dao Gate and the Chen Clan gave Li Ximing pause. Ning Wan, who knew more about the matter, clarified, “The Three Sects and Seven Gates all sent disciples to claim a share, but they only took non-essential items. The true treasures were the portions left over from the main peak after the True Monarch took his fill, as well as several important side peaks.”

“Three spiritual artifacts and two spirit embryos were recovered. The spiritual artifacts were divided among Mount Changhuai, the Azure Pond Sect, and the Golden Feather Sect. As for the spirit embryos, one went to the Chunyi Dao Gate, and the other is in the hands of the Purple Smoke Gate.”

'In the hands of Azure Pond?'

At the time, Yuanxiu had been in seclusion, which meant the representative from the Azure Pond Sect had been Daoist Master Yuansu. That meant the spiritual artifact had fallen into the hands of the Ning family. Li Ximing's eyes lit up, though a question arose in his mind.

'Tinglan has one as well? And she never mentioned it.'

The treasure in the Azure Pond Sect’s possession was a completed spiritual artifact, whereas the Purple Smoke Gate’s was a spirit embryo that still required nurturing—a significant difference in quality. Although a spirit embryo refined by the Cui family would undoubtedly be superior to anything Li Ximing could create himself, a finished spiritual artifact was surely better. “That spiritual artifact…” he began eagerly.

Ning Wan shook her head with a touch of embarrassment. “My ancestor obtained that Bright Yang spiritual artifact, but it was ill-suited for him and incompatible with my Cold Qi. He traded it to King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou in exchange for the protective treasure I now possess.”

Spiritual artifacts were, by nature, secretive things. Ning Wan didn't elaborate, but as the inheritor of Yuansu's legacy, she was certainly not lacking in treasures. She paused, then added, “Although Sister Tinglan’s spirit embryo is excellent, it is not of the Bright Yang path. The Purple Smoke Gate had the first choice, and they naturally selected the one most suitable for them. The one left for the Chunyi Dao Gate, however, is of the Bright Yang path.”

Li Ximing felt no disappointment. Yuansu had been nearing the end of his life and must have made arrangements for everything, not keeping a spiritual artifact for himself. In any case, it was simply a matter of a trade. As long as he knew its location, it was manageable. He murmured to himself, “So, it's one of three: the Golden Feather Sect, Songzhou, or the Chunyi Dao Gate…”

The Golden Feather Sect possessed a wealth of treasures, but Li Ximing doubted he had anything that could persuade them to part with one. The items held by Songzhou and the Chunyi Dao Gate seemed more attainable. “This King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou,” he asked, “what sort of person is he? What Daoist tradition does he cultivate?”

At his question, Lingmei stroked his beard. “I know of him,” he answered. “A mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, the Supreme King of Songzhou. His power has expanded dramatically in recent years, making him a dire threat to Thunder-Hearing Island. If not for the fact that he cultivates the path of Shamanic Talismans, which is somewhat restrained by the Miao Family's lightning arts, Thunder-Hearing Island would have already been destroyed. You could start your inquiries there.”

“As for the Chunyi Dao Gate,” he continued, “they consider themselves the orthodox lineage of the Supreme Yin and are bound by strict rules. A Bright Yang artifact would be of little use to them, and a spirit embryo is less valuable than a full spiritual artifact. In my opinion, that one might be even easier to obtain.”

The network of a Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was far beyond what a solitary cultivator like Li Ximing could muster. An introduction from Kui Qi and the others would greatly improve his chances. Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. “Then I must trouble you all.”

He paused before adding politely, “If a spirit embryo proves unattainable, do any of you fellow Daoists have an ancient Bright Yang Dharma artifact that I might study?”

Li Ximing had already made his plans. He had acquired the *Refining in the Fiery Pavilion* from Changxi, and the ritual platform by the shore was complete. Regardless of the outcome with the spiritual artifact or the spirit embryo, it was never a mistake to begin refining one himself. For that, he would need to seriously consider a base, and an ancient Dharma artifact was the ideal choice.

His request seemed to surprise them. Cultivators from the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions typically selected an ancient Dharma artifact during their Foundation Establishment Realm and carried it all the way to the Purple Mansion Realm. Li Zhouwei, for instance, could begin refining his Grand Ascension Halberd into a spirit embryo the moment he broke through.

But as soon as the words left his mouth, all three nodded. Kui Qi raised an eyebrow and smiled. “Huiyu, bring the ancient Bright Yang Dharma artifacts from the treasury!”

A black-robed Daoist wiping a Dharma sword on the highest step immediately rose and bowed. Kui Qi nodded back. “We have a stock of ancient Dharma artifacts. My family should have the most—three in total. Zhaojing, pick one. Please, don’t be polite!”

With Kui Qi’s swift offer, Ning Wan and Lingmei could say no more. But ancient Dharma artifacts were not like their modern counterparts; their numbers were finite. They were not items to be given away lightly, even among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Li Ximing was stunned. “I cannot accept a gift from the Xiukui for nothing…” he said, shaking his head.

Kui Qi laughed heartily and rose to his feet, a look of pleasure on his face. “Since all our fellow Daoists are present, I will be direct. I will not treat you unfairly. Not only may you choose an artifact, but I will also gift you a spiritual extract, a resource for the Bright Yang path…”

A sharp glint flashed in his eyes as he stated his price. “My Xiukui… wants Fei Qingya.”

The words hung in the air, and Li Ximing finally understood. By association with the True Monarch, the Li family had acquired Fei Qingya. She was a liability now, but once the True Monarch departed, she could become an invaluable asset. The Great Xiukui Monastery was clearly tempted!

As realization dawned on Li Ximing, he saw that Lingmei was unsurprised. Ning Wan, however, having only recently reached the Purple Mansion Realm, did not grasp the full implications and looked on thoughtfully. Kui Qi smiled. “I thought if she didn't cultivate Cold Qi, she would cultivate ‘Purple Qi.’ I never expected that with you two trapped in the north, fate would intervene, and she would end up cultivating Pit Water. And with Xiao Chuting in the Northern Sea… this fine seedling, it seems, is destined for my Xiukui!”

The Great Xiukui Monastery oversaw many subordinate monasteries, which cultivated not only the ‘Xiukui’ arts but also ‘Pit Water’ and ‘Shamanic Talismans.’ Li Ximing’s mind raced, weighing the possibilities.

If he didn't kill Fei Qingya, keeping her within the clan would be inconvenient. She currently held a favorable opinion of the Li family, but she was still a Fei, with the potential to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. The Fei family also had ties to the Sima Family's troubles. Once her cultivation advanced, there was no telling what complications might arise.

More importantly, the memory of Xu Xiao was still vivid, and Li Ximing remained wary. His Talisman Seed and Immortal Mirror were his greatest secrets. If an outsider from another clan reached the Purple Mansion Realm under his roof, too much would be exposed. And should the Fei family develop ambitions of its own, they could vacillate between ally and enemy, or even break away entirely.

He had considered arranging a marriage, but she was the True Monarch’s woman. Marrying her to a Li family member would be a direct insult to a True Monarch—a historically unprecedented act of foolishness.

Sending her to a Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, on the other hand, could forge an alliance with a future Daoist Master. His only fear was that if she achieved great power at Xiukui and the Fei family sought her aid, the trouble stirred up by a major Daoist tradition would be far more lethal. Despite his reservations, Kui Qi had made his offer plain. Li Ximing could only sigh. “It is not that I am unwilling… I simply fear that her worldly attachments will prevent her from focusing on cultivation, and she will end up wasting your esteemed sect’s resources.”

Kui Qi caught his meaning. “Zhaojing, you can rest easy on that score,” he smiled. “My Dao has ways of initiating one into a monastery, of clarifying the heart and proving one’s path through an oath not to let clan matters interfere. As for the Fei family… my Linhai prefecture is vast and mountainous. There is certainly room for another clan. When the time is right, we can move them to Linhai and, following precedent, establish them in the deep forests with their own monastery.”

It was clear that although the Great Xiukui Monastery's primary Daoist Masters were surnamed Lin and their clan dominated the region, the numerous monasteries scattered throughout were not merely for show. Li Ximing nodded, choosing his words with care. “That would be best. However, she is originally from Moongaze Lake. My family sends her an annual stipend of resources, as is our custom. Does your esteemed monastery have any rules that would prevent her from accepting them?”

For the Li family, this was a gesture to maintain goodwill, but it was also a way to gauge the importance the Great Xiukui Monastery placed on Fei Qingya. Kui Qi simply raised an eyebrow and replied cheerfully, “Not a problem!”

Li Ximing surmised that the Lin Clan already had its own pillars of strength, making Fei Qingya a welcome but not essential addition. He relaxed considerably as the black-robed Daoist returned, carrying a jade plate upon which rested three treasures: a ring shimmering with Profound Light, a long and elegant spear, and a ruler of azure jade.

The Daoist presented the three ancient Dharma artifacts with a respectful bow. He first indicated the ring, which was made of golden jade and bore three points of brilliant light. “This is the Outer Frontier Ring,” he said reverently. “It is an ancient Dharma artifact that the Great Daoist Master acquired from the Northern Buddhists in his youth. It dates to the early Liang dynasty. It can dissolve Dharma power to escape as a beam of light, and its three bright points can unleash three streams of Profound Light to strike down foes.”

The ring was both ornate and versatile, clearly an auxiliary Dharma artifact once worn by a noble scion of the Wei imperial family. The Daoist then picked up the spear. “This is the Heaven-Measuring Bright Spear. It was recovered from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. Its age is unknown, but it predates the Liang dynasty, from sometime after Emperor Gong. The spear can transform into light to pierce and wound enemies. It is immensely powerful but demands skill in weaponry.”

Finally, he gestured to the jade ruler. It was over a foot long, carved with intricate patterns of mountains and rivers, and exuded a warm, gentle aura. “This is Shichuan,” he said. “It also came from Eastern Fire and is even older, likely predating Emperor Gong of Wei. It can summon projections of mountains and rivers to cover a battlefield, empowering its wielder and allowing them to walk on Profound Light. It can also be used to sense an enemy’s movements.”

Li Ximing surveyed the items. As expected of the Great Xiukui Monastery’s collection, none were ordinary. The Daoist had provided only a brief summary, but each artifact possessed deeper mysteries. As a cultivator of the Bright Yang path, a single glance allowed him to grasp most of their functions.

'The ring is likely the most valuable. Its functions are comprehensive and would be immensely useful to a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. But I have already mastered a divine ability. Even if I were to refine it into a spirit embryo, I can already replicate many of its functions myself. It isn’t an exceptional choice for me.'

'The spear is a purely offensive weapon, but it relies on martial skill rather than mystical spell arts. I don’t mind practicing Dharma Arts, but I’ve had no affinity for spears or swords since childhood. To start learning now, at the Purple Mansion Realm… my divine ability grants me clarity, so I might not be worse than an ordinary cultivator, but it would be laughable among my peers.'

'This ruler is well-rounded, yet grand. Its abilities have some overlap with the wonders of my Audience with the Celestial Gate…'

He considered them from his lofty Purple Mansion Realm perspective, his standards exacting. Hearing Ning Wan’s soft exclamations of praise, he knew that even the Azure Pond Sect’s offerings could not surpass these. He reached out and picked up the Shichuan.

Kui Qi sipped his tea and explained casually, “The Shichuan is of an exceedingly high grade. It was likely a plaything of an imperial descendant qualified to contend for the throne. That is why it is more refined than it is powerful. Once you supplement it as a spirit embryo, it will be quite formidable.”

“It is one foot two inches long, eight-tenths of an inch thick, and one and two-tenths inches wide. The material is Stork River Azure Jade, a substance now lost to time. It is exceptionally fine. The tail is engraved with ‘Yang Extreme,’ the head with ‘High Radiance.’ It depicts mountains and rivers, but no deities, putting it only a single step below the specifications for an artifact of a Wei crown prince.”

He was clearly intimately familiar with the treasures of his sect. He gazed at the Shichuan with a touch of wistfulness. “When I was being punished by guarding the treasury, the Shichuan was on the third platform to my left. I often found myself wondering if its owner ever took that final step… The master of such an elegant artifact ought to have brought a long era of peace to the Wei state.”

Li Ximing nodded. No wonder the ruler felt so unexpectedly heavy. Since its material was superior to the other two, its potential was also greater, making it the most worthy candidate for a spirit embryo. This realization swept away any lingering hesitation. Content, he smiled and said, “Many thanks, fellow Daoist, for making this possible!”

Kui Qi smiled and waved his hand dismissively, then turned to give an order. “Go and bring the spiritual extract.”

The black-robed Daoist departed at once. Li Ximing caressed the warm, smooth surface of the Shichuan, growing fonder of it by the moment. The Wei style tended toward one of two extremes: either domineering and fierce, or calm and majestic. The Shichuan was undoubtedly the latter, and he found it difficult to put down.

'This will be my first Purple Mansion Realm spirit embryo!'



# Chapter 869: The Viewing Pavilion

As Li Ximing considered the implications, the black-robed Daoist approached. This time, the jade tray held a round, ink-black stone column, no bigger than a palm, with a concave center that shimmered with a brilliant light.

This was the primary reward from the Great Xiukui Monastery for taking Fei Qingya.

Kui Qi nodded. "I acquired this myself some time ago in the Southern Sea. It was originally a spirit stone called the Shield of White Sun, but it was damaged during the fight to claim it. A corner broke off, and its essence began to leak away rapidly…"

"When I brought it back, I watched it weaken day by day. I had no choice but to have it refined, combining it with numerous spiritual materials to stabilize it. In the end, I obtained a pool of spirit extract. This is a portion of it," he explained. "It can be considered a spiritual resource and retains many of the original stone's properties. Beyond its conventional Bright Yang divine abilities, it is one of the rare Bright Yang materials that can be used to inscribe talismans. The only Bright Yang resource with superior effects in this regard is likely the Radiant Sky Stone."

He paused, adding a pointed reminder. "Zhaojing will need Bright Yang resources when he returns to refine his spirit embryo. He can make good use of this."

Li Ximing was in no position to be picky. He noted the generous portion, nodded repeatedly, and stored it away with a flick of his wrist. After the three of them had discussed the Dao for a while and finished the pot of tea, they prepared to depart.

Li Ximing summoned Cui Jueyin, who bowed to the four Daoist Masters before taking his place behind him. Lingmei, being the highest in status, spoke in a gravelly voice.

"Qiuhu has just been rescued, and Zhaojing has only now returned. We all have territories to govern, and I cannot be away from my Sword Gate for long. If there is any news, we can gather again at Tiger's Frontier."

Kui Qi smiled and bowed, seeing the three of them off. As their figures vanished into the vast expanse of white snow, he let out a sigh of relief. He turned to the black-robed Daoist, his voice low.

"The Black Spider Grotto is suffused with dark energy. Although it is suppressed by Mount Buding… the other grottos can see it. Has there been any reaction?"

The Daoist replied in a hushed tone, "None… However, we received word today that the Lingu Family has come asking about Lingu Lanying and Lingu Rao…"

Kui Qi sighed, a touch of regret in his voice. "I warned Lingu Rao back then. The next few decades were not suitable for a breakthrough. He was determined to press on, so there was nothing to be done… Send his remains back to the Lingu Family."

"For now, we will see what Lingu Lanying can do," he continued. "One can look down on the Northern Buddhists as individuals, but not as a power. If she succeeds, we will have another card to play…"

"Yes!" the black-robed Daoist, Huiyu, replied with his head bowed. "Lingu Lanying is of a close bloodline and greatly resembles the Lady from back then, which is why the Great Daoist Master favors her. He did grant her a spiritual item, after all. I also heard that the Great Daoist Master once held her hand and taught her the wonders of various spiritual artifacts. And the painting he made during his conflict between the north and south… he has been nurturing it all this time, and it, too, is for her."

"I understand," Kui Qi said, a shadow of melancholy crossing his features. He paced a few steps in the snow and sighed. "Master is a sentimental man. Otherwise, he wouldn't have watched over the Lingu Family for hundreds of years, elevating them to their current status. It reached the point where, worrying about his own dwindling lifespan, he resolved to raise a Purple Mansion expert for them…"

"Lingu Rao was doomed to die when he entered the grotto-heaven back then; it was Master who intervened to save him. In the end, that one proved useless. Now, only Lingu Lanying remains."

As the foremost figure of the Great Xiukui Monastery, Lou Xing had traveled a thousand miles to that grotto-heaven just to save a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator of Eastern Yue blood. The extent of his favoritism was clear. The two men exchanged a silent, knowing look, leaving their other thoughts unspoken.

‘The Lin family has plenty of Purple Mansion cultivators, yet he rarely sees them. Meanwhile, he has propped up one member of the Lingu Family after another, and is finally about to succeed in creating a Purple Mansion expert. But will this new Purple Mansion belong to the Azure Pond Sect or the Great Xiukui Monastery?’

The Daoist traditions of the Supreme Yang Dao were deeply interconnected. The Great Xiukui Monastery was teeming with talent and at the height of its power. Kui Qi, a man of integrity, wasn't overly concerned about one Purple Mansion expert ending up with the Azure Pond Sect—it might even be a good thing. But from what he understood of Lou Xing's intentions, the Great Daoist Master, who had grasped Sword Intent… would likely hand over a significant number of spiritual artifacts to the Lingu Family…

For the Great Xiukui Monastery, this would be a devastating blow, cutting to the bone! A conservative and steadfast man like Kui Qi could not sit by and watch it happen.

Not only did Kui Qi have to worry about Lou Xing's lifespan and secretly search for life-extending treasures, but he also had to manage the favoritism of this Great Daoist Master, who grew more willful and indulgent of his whims with age. And the worst part was, he couldn't speak a word of his troubles to anyone, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.

If he, Kui Qi, were truly ruthless, Lingu Lanying would certainly fail her breakthrough the moment Lou Xing died. But out of respect for his master and his own pride, he buried these thoughts deep within, letting out only a sigh.

‘It’s common for the elderly to show favoritism… But… but… Lingu Lanying… she has no attachment to Tiger's Frontier. Once she gets the spiritual artifacts, she’ll be even more wary of us. She will definitely stay with the Azure Pond Sect… Even if Ning Wan were willing, why would the Lingu Family, or she herself, give up the rich lands of Simin and the Azure Pond Sect? Why would she abandon her autonomy to come here and submit to us…’

***

Li Ximing and Ning Wan traveled north, with Cui Jueyin following quietly behind. They crossed into the territory of the Azure Pond Sect. Having cultivated a divine ability, the foremost beauty of the Azure Pond Sect was now breathtakingly beautiful with every glance and gesture. She sighed.

"The spiritual atmosphere near the shore feels strange… I just hope nothing has happened to the Great Daoist Master."

Li Ximing had heard of this Great Daoist Master Lou Xing many times; even Yuandao had expressed concern for him years ago. He naturally offered words of comfort.

"If something were truly wrong with the Great Daoist Master and his time was short, Zhelu would never dare to provoke you. It is precisely because the Great Daoist Master is fine, merely pressed for time to cultivate his divine ability and unable to risk injury, that Zhelu feels bold enough to make a move."

There was sound logic in his words. A dying Great Daoist Master was the most terrifying foe. From the way Yuandao had spoken, he had not seemed overly anxious, making this the most credible assessment. Ning Wan nodded and smiled.

"Senior Kui Qi is a warm person, but he is also very meticulous. Though Zhaojing is not deeply versed in the Dao of talismans, the spirit extract from the Shield of White Sun can be used to forge your spirit embryo. You can find a Daoist Master of refinement or even do it yourself. It will be very useful."

Her expression flickered slightly as she added, "After all, the sooner it’s forged, the better."

As soon as Ning Wan said this, Li Ximing understood her meaning. He now stood on the side of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Kui Qi's repeated warmth, even sharing information about Bright Yang spiritual artifacts so freely, was clearly aimed at raising Li Ximing's strength as quickly as possible.

This spirit embryo was part of that plan. The Great Xiukui Monastery might not have any Purple Mansion-grade Bright Yang spirit treasures, but with the legacy of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, they surely had no shortage of Purple Mansion-level Bright Yang cultivation resources. So why specifically choose the spirit extract of the Shield of White Sun? Was it for drawing talismans?

If it was for talismans, wasn't that a specialty of the Great Xiukui Monastery? They would surely cherish something they excelled at. Why give it to him?

It had to be because the spirit extract of the Shield of White Sun was better suited for enhancing a spirit embryo! The sooner his spirit embryo was forged, the stronger he would become. This was a method that would yield results in a short time, unlike cultivation resources, which would take at least a decade or two to show any effect.

Li Ximing signaled that he understood. Though he was not skilled in refinement, he possessed the *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*. Adding the spirit extract of the Shield of White Sun meant he wouldn't have to trouble Jinyu or Hengzhu, which was a great relief. He smiled.

"I hear the Ning Clan has a guest elder named Chu Minglian, who also cultivates Li Fire. I have constructed a ritual platform to forge this spirit embryo. When I am not present, I will need a master skilled in refinement to oversee it."

Ning Wan understood immediately. "I will send him over," she said softly.

Li Ximing thanked her. He had rarely encountered so much good fortune since reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, and a smile remained on his face. After crossing the Wilderness, he and Ning Wan exchanged communication jades for emergency alerts, and she departed toward Lake Xian.

Li Ximing rode the Profound Light back with Cui Jueyin. Flying over the lake, he could feel the joy and awe of the cultivators below. They chattered in hushed tones, and smaller local families had sent representatives to offer their respects, their eyes filled with envy and wonder.

Groups of people flew about on streaks of light, dotting the sky above the lake. Li Ximing, however, traversed the Great Void, appearing silently and unnoticed on the edge of a high formation platform. Only then did he get a chance to properly examine the formation array before him.

‘Broad Valley Purple Visage Light.’

He gently raised his hand. Strands and wisps of purplish-yellow light descended from the sky, most no larger than willow leaves. They swirled and gathered in his palm. Behind him, Cui Jueyin felt a suffocating pressure, as if a single touch from one of those tiny beams of light could incinerate him completely.

‘Its power is impressive,’ Li Ximing thought. ‘It has an entangling, imprisoning quality, and it feels relentless. Though it can't compare to the killing power of a Bright Yang light, it's superior to most spell arts. If a Merciful One were caught off guard by this, he would be injured. As for dealing with other Purple Mansion experts… it can only be used for containment… I can’t rely on it to kill.’

‘A pity. This is a Purple Mansion-grade grand formation, after all. With its help, the Foundation Establishment cultivators can defend against other Purple Mansion experts when I am absent. But without the ability to traverse the Great Void, they can't use this profound light offensively. It’s even questionable whether they can control such a marvel properly.’

The gulf between the Purple Mansion and Foundation Establishment realms was a heavenly chasm, difficult to cross. Li Ximing casually dispersed the light and turned. "Have the Foundation Establishment cultivators on the lake meet me at the Viewing Pavilion Platform."

With that, he dissolved into Profound Light and vanished.

The Viewing Pavilion Platform stood below the Inherited Clarity Gate, composed of one main stage and twelve auxiliary towers. It was the foundation for the *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*. The construction had been an immense undertaking and had been completed years ago, heavily guarded and fortified with formations. No one had ever set foot upon it.

Li Ximing traversed the Great Void and appeared at the apex of the main stage. It was dawn, and a cold wind blew. The black and red banners on the twelve surrounding towers fluttered. In the center of the main stage was a celestial altar. He walked up its steps, from where he could perfectly see the pavilions on the distant lake.

‘The Viewing Pavilion Platform… the name is quite fitting.’

In that brief moment, Li Jiangqian and the others had already sped over. They bowed from the stage, their faces alight with joy, and said in unison, "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing scanned the crowd, counting the numbers. His eyes fell upon a very excited Ding Weizeng kneeling at the front, and he nodded. He then saw Li Que'wan, Xia Shouyu, and the others, feeling a stir of emotion.

‘To think I have so many Foundation Establishment cultivators under my command now.’

But the matter of the spirit embryo was urgent; the sooner it was forged, the sooner it could be used. Li Ximing wasted no more time and immediately began to make arrangements.

The *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire* required twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators, corresponding to the twelve auxiliary towers. They would be divided into two alternating groups of six for the ritual forging. Of course, if manpower allowed, twenty-four towers could be built to speed up the process even more.

He began to call out the names. "Li Wen of 'Jade True', An Siwei, White Ape of 'True Qi', Cui Jueyin of 'Bright Yang', Li Minggong of 'True Fire', Ding Weizeng of 'Hengzhu', Sun Bai of 'Horn Wood', and Xia Shouyu of 'Blazing Fire'."

A quick survey showed that, aside from his two Talisman Seed successors who shouldn't spend their time here, he had eight cultivators whose arts did not conflict with Bright Yang, and in fact, would even benefit from the process. Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then asked, "What is the status of the two Foundation Establishment cultivators from back then, Wen Yi and Wen Shan?"

Wen Yi and Wen Shan were demonic cultivators from the Eastern Sea who had been captured by the Li family. Li Ximing had subdued them with his divine ability and locked them on the west bank, forcing them to refine artifacts with their dharma power day after day. Many years had passed. Li Jiangqian answered respectfully, "The two brothers are just grateful to be alive. They have been docile and diligent all these years."

"Then bring them over for now…"

The two of them were of 'Asura Ridge', not a perfect match, but they would suffice to make up the numbers, bringing the total to ten. For the remaining two, Qu Bushi was needed to gather information in the north. After some thought, Li Ximing could only choose Fei Qing'yi of 'Cold Qi' and Miaoshui of 'Converging Water'.

Although these two were not ideal and their effects would be less than the others, he needed to assemble all twelve. The secret technique specified that besides a few types like 'Veiled Yin', 'Pit Water' was also unsuitable, which meant Chen Yang could not participate.

With their orders given, the Foundation Establishment cultivators took their positions on the platforms. Li Ximing reached into his sleeve and drew out the Shichuan.

The Li family actually possessed several other treasures. One was the Sun Seeker Ring, whose grade was unknown. But since it had once caused the Immortal Mirror to resonate, the family had never dared to bring it out again, leaving it locked away at the bottom of a chest.

The second was the ancient magical artifact, the Profound Pattern Vase, which could manifest different effects based on different Daoist traditions. It was incredibly wondrous, but whether it could be forged into a spirit embryo was another question. Its ability to produce different wonders with different dharma powers didn't seem very 'Bright Yang'. If it were forged and then couldn't be nurtured, it would be a huge embarrassment. In any case, Li Zhouwei had taken it, so it wasn't here.

After considering everything, the safest and best option was the Shichuan.

Under his Bright Yang divine ability, the Shichuan had long been refined. Now, it emitted a soft Profound Light as it descended gently onto the central celestial altar. Li Ximing then flicked a finger.

"BOOM!"

Flashes of red and white erupted as gleaming golden flames mixed with Bright Yang purple fire, boiling into a spherical ball of light on the altar. The intense heat made the Shichuan blaze with dazzling brilliance. The twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators channeled their arts in unison, and twelve ley lines lit up on the main stage, stabilizing the flames.

With the platform activated, six of them could wait their turn to rotate, ensuring the manpower wasn't stretched too thin. Li Ximing first used the Profound Light from between his brows to measure and calculate the required amount and timing for the Li Fire and Baleful Fire Qi over the next three days. He handed a jade slip to Li Minggong, who had flown down, and gave her some instructions. "I'm leaving this Viewing Pavilion Platform in your care. Among everyone here, you cultivate True Fire and have some understanding of refinement. You can manage the timing and replenish the Li Fire and Baleful Fire Qi. For now, you will be in charge."

Once Chu Minglian from the Ning family arrived, Li Ximing could almost wash his hands of the matter entirely.

‘Although Minggong cultivates True Fire and can attempt refinement, her talent is not high. Chu Minglian has had a connection with our family for many years. Perhaps this time, he can gain some insight into our Daoist tradition…’

Having arranged matters for the spirit embryo, he rode the light with Li Jiangqian and the other towards Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

In the span of a few days, the Li family had erected a grand formation and begun forging a spirit embryo. The clan's atmosphere was completely renewed. Li Jiangqian seemed to have something to say but held his tongue due to the rapid succession of events. He first bowed.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master… the Viewing Pavilion Platform requires a great deal of manpower, drawing nearly all the Foundation Establishment cultivators from the lake. May I ask how many years this forging will take?"

A spirit embryo was less troublesome and demanding than a spiritual artifact, as it required constant nurturing to maintain its Purple Mansion-grade status after being forged. Li Ximing estimated that even a Purple Mansion expert without a relevant Daoist tradition could forge one in a few decades, albeit of lower quality. The *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire* was an ancient technique, and with twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators, the time should be reduced to under eight years.

More importantly, there was the spirit extract from the Shield of White Sun that Kui Qi had given him. Although he hadn't used it yet, the fact that Kui Qi had specifically mentioned it suggested it would be of great benefit to the spirit embryo.

As for Li Fire and Baleful Fire Qi, Gardenia Scenery Mountain had no shortage of them, and with the boost from his own Purple Mansion True Fire, Li Ximing simply replied, "Wait a while. It will take a few years at most. Bring out the family's Bright Yang resources so we can finish it as soon as possible."

Li Jiangqian acknowledged the order. Li Que'wan then said softly, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, the sixteen pillars of the island have been demarcated. The earth veins have shifted, and the original spirit fields and spiritual energy flows are completely different. The immortal caves and palaces can no longer be used. We are currently remeasuring the spiritual and earth veins to design new residences."

Li Ximing nodded. Li Jiangqian then reported on the cultivation progress of several family members, mentioning that Li Xinghan, Li Zhouda, and his own two younger brothers, Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia, were all in seclusion for breakthroughs. Li Ximing was pleased.

"The secrets of the Essence Gathering Pills are no longer hidden from our family, and the quality of our direct bloodline is improving. The probability of reaching Foundation Establishment is high, but we must exercise restraint. For Foundation Establishment, quality is more important than quantity. Supporting them is a huge expense, whether in spiritual energy or resources. Each step forward requires a vast amount… and it's even more pronounced for those with poor aptitude."

"Our family has sixteen prefectures and two mountains. Gardenia Scenery Mountain can barely support my own cultivation. Even with the vastness of the Milin Mountains, our territory can comfortably support thirty Foundation Establishment cultivators at most. Once the number of direct descendants at Foundation Establishment is sufficient, the bestowing of Essence Gathering Pills must be done with great care."

In truth, Li Ximing had deeper worries. The Li family's strength was expanding too quickly, which wasn't necessarily a good thing. The number of factions and branches beneath them was also growing. He said softly, "Let's wait for them to come out of seclusion… then we will discuss it further."

He flicked his sleeve and asked, "What is the situation at the Riverbank?"

Li Jiangqian reported respectfully, "The changes have been drastic. First, in Jiangnan, Daoist Master Zhu Gong has disappeared, and her soul lamp has dimmed. The Sacred Writ Gate was a poorly organized group to begin with, and with this incident, not only are the lower ranks in disarray, but conflicts have also arisen among the direct lineages. They are nearly paralyzed. Tensions between the various factions are high; I hear they are on the verge of fighting."

Li Jiangqian had never thought much of the Sacred Writ Gate. Sure enough, with Daoist Master Zhu Gong gone, they were one step away from drawing blades on each other.

"As for the Capital immortals Dao… the counties and cities under its rule are in a state of panic. They are being run in circles by an unknown group. Guan Gongxiao has been sending letters almost every other day. Now that he's heard we've erected a Purple Mansion-grade grand formation, he has likely guessed a few things and has sent several more letters, pleading for our help."

Li Ximing nodded noncommittally. "Continue."

"And then there's the Hall of the Locust Soul… their situation is even worse. We received news some time ago that the Black Rat Daoist was killed, which is normal enough. But I just received word this morning that Daoist Bai… has been murdered! Even the legendary secret token has vanished without a trace. Although his Dharma Protectors immediately locked down the news, the organization is as leaky as a sieve. Everyone knows by now!"

"Daoist Bai is dead prematurely!"

"Indeed… It's said that before he died… his soul scattered. It seems all his dharma power and vital energy were completely drained, without even the slightest phenomenon appearing. If not for his fluttering robes and fallen magical artifact… the members of the Hall of the Locust Soul would have thought he had simply departed quietly…"

Li Ximing was stunned. He frowned. "Hah… the Purple Smoke Gate's stage has been utterly smashed…"

With this, a sense of unease began to grow in Li Ximing's heart. Ning Wan's personality and her circumstances were different from Tinglan's. If he were in Ning Wan's position right now, aside from maintaining the situation and not crossing the river, he probably wouldn't be able to intervene much either.

‘As for the True Monarch… I wonder what his cultivation level is now… With the Hall Master of the Hall of the Locust Soul dead, I wonder on whom this karma will fall…’

"Wang Quwan… has any news come back?" Li Ximing asked.

Li Jiangqian silently shook his head. Seeing Li Ximing deep in thought, and assuming that concluded their business, Li Jiangqian quickly added, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, there is some good news. We heard about Father's whereabouts some time ago. He was spotted in the market of the Purple Smoke Gate. At that time, we only knew he was safe and sound in the Eastern Sea, which was a relief."

"Now that news of the Daoist Master's return has reached Zongquan Island, we have received a reply. It turns out Father was cultivating a secret technique in seclusion near Zongquan, and his location was kept hidden. Now that he has emerged and heard of your return, he sent a message home… He is preparing… to enter seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Li Jiangqian's words finally made Li Ximing's eyes light up. "It's about time we had news of him!"

Li Zhouwei hadn't said much in his message, but how could Li Ximing not understand? There was no need for Li Zhouwei to reveal his location to the family unless he wanted to see Li Ximing before entering seclusion!

The Li family was not what it once was. Back then, they needed Xiao Yuansi to toil away at alchemy. Now, Li Ximing could easily prepare all the resources Li Zhouwei needed to advance his immortal foundation to the Shengyang Acupoint! And the experience Li Zhouwei had gained from cultivating his secret technique would be incredibly valuable.

Moreover, as the two core figures of the Li family who had been out of contact for so many years, they desperately needed to meet.

‘I should have suspected it! The Eastern Sea is the safest place for him. Besides, Zongquan Island is the territory of the Dragon Prince Dingjiao, and we have our own island there. It couldn't be a better location.’

He thought it over, slightly worried that Changxiao might try to intercept him. Although the Li Ximing of today was no longer the newly-ascended, inexperienced Purple Mansion cultivator he once was, a man like Changxiao would not underestimate him.

‘As long as I use the Immortal Mirror to scout, no matter what grand divine ability Changxiao uses or how precise his calculations are, he can forget about ambushing me!’

Without a moment's hesitation, Li Ximing took out another jade talisman and handed it to Li Jiangqian. "I should have met with the clansmen to celebrate the completion of the formation, but this matter is urgent," he said in a grave voice. "I must make a trip to the Eastern Sea immediately. Traversing the Great Void is fast; I will be back before long. If there is any news, crush this jade talisman to notify me!"

# Chapter 870: The Meeting

Zongquan Island.

The waters of the Vermillion Sea shimmered, an iridescent blend of azure and crimson beneath the sapphire sky. It was exceptionally beautiful. Two fishing boats drifted quietly on the water, their pale yellow sails raised, gliding toward a patch of ocean where seagulls wheeled and gathered.

A bright light converged at the zenith. A man in a platinum-gold Daoist robe descended with the light, materializing before the island’s great array. The common folk on the island looked up, their faces filled with curiosity.

Zongquan Island had known peace for many years. The people lived and worked contentedly. Thanks to their relationship with the Huiyao, the fishermen even dared to sail the surrounding waters freely. Consequently, they held little fear of cultivators. Li Ximing swept his gaze over them before passing through the array and into the main hall.

Inside, an old man in white robes, his face a web of wrinkles and his hair sparse, was slumped over a desk. His head hung low, seemingly overcome with exhaustion. Not until the bright light materialized within the hall did the old man startle as if waking from a dream. He scrambled to his feet, threw himself to the floor, and trembled like chaff in the wind.

"Greetings, Divine Ability! Greetings, Daoist Master!"

This was Zong Yan, the administrator of the island and one of the earth-nurtured children at the Qi Refining level. He was ancient now. Having grown up on Zongquan Island and experienced the terror of having no protector, he held high-level cultivators in profound awe, to say nothing of a Daoist Master. He remained pressed firmly to the ground, kneeling rigidly.

Li Ximing merely retrieved the main family’s token from his sleeve, tossed it to the man, and ordered, "Go and summon the Heir."

Zong Yan scrambled to his feet, grabbed a jade talisman from the desk, and crushed it. He immediately returned to his kneeling position. Li Ximing asked, "How is Zongquan faring these days?"

Zong Yan hurried to answer. "Thanks to the main family’s blessings, we produced two cultivation seedlings. They were sent to the Lake for advanced training. We are just... just waiting to see if one of them is willing to return in a couple of years..."

Although Zongquan Island was much improved, compared to Moongaze Lake, it was still a desolate backwater. Unless the Lake dispatched a direct descendant to stand guard, no cultivator was willing to come here. In all these years, the few talented individuals they had managed to produce were all sent to the Lake’s Jade Court, and none had ever spoken of returning.

These seedlings were ashamed to even mention Zongquan, and since the Li family had not publicly acknowledged the island, they continued their cultivation at the Lake. Li Ximing listened to this and shook his head. "Don't worry," he replied. "They will all return."

In truth, Zongquan Island was actually safer for Li Zhouwei than Moongaze Lake. If he achieved his breakthrough here, the island itself would undergo a heaven-and-earth-shattering transformation. The spiritual veins would certainly become incomparably richer. This is why Li Ximing spoke with such confidence.

However, Zong Yan completely misunderstood his intent. He kowtowed hastily, terrified. "That... that wasn't a complaint! The children... they are very good to their families here..."

Li Ximing paused, then chuckled and shook his head, deciding not to mention Li Zhouwei. He chatted idly with the old man for a while, listening to him ramble on about how Li Yuanjiao had saved Zongquan all those years ago. Finally, another bright light descended from the sky and landed before the hall.

The light dissipated, revealing a youth with golden eyes, clad in golden-white scale armor, a Profound Pattern Vase hanging from his waist. As he reached the hall entrance, his eyes lit up, and he bowed deeply. "Minghuang greets the Daoist Master! Congratulations on the advancement of your divine abilities..."

Seeing him, Li Ximing let out a long breath of relief. He walked quickly toward the youth, shaking his head with a smile. "Look at you... why all the formality? Come, come..."

Zong Yan tactfully excused himself, closing the doors behind him as the array isolated the hall. Li Ximing knew Li Zhouwei must have used the Immortal Mirror to scan the area before approaching Zongquan, so he felt safe to speak freely. He sighed.

"Stop with this 'Daoist Master' talk. You were the one who fought your way out of the Lake and managed to kill Situ Mo, eliminating that great scourge. I, on the other hand, had a wretched journey... If Changxiao hadn't been intercepted midway, I would have already dissipated into a patch of Profound Light, scattered across the outer sea."

"But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. After scrambling around out there, I managed to heal my injuries, and my cultivation didn't fall too far behind. I even obtained a wisp of Purple Mansion True Fire and forged a connection with Nine Mounds..."

Li Zhouwei repeatedly insisted he didn't deserve the praise. Even so, seeing Li Ximing safe and sound—and having clearly gained significant benefits—he finally relaxed. He respectfully presented a jade box with both hands. "The Daoist Master is the one who preserved the clan. This junior merely benefited from that protection and was lucky to escape. But... without performing the proper rites or sacrifices, I presumptuously used the clan's treasured spirit sword. This junior requests punishment..."

Li Ximing knew it contained Qingchi. He accepted it gently. "Nonsense!"

But Li Zhouwei wasn't finished. He waited until Li Ximing had secured Qingchi before continuing, "As for Changxiao being intercepted... it was Lady Qinghong who took action."

Li Ximing had never expected to hear Li Qinghong’s name. He froze, a mixture of shock and joy flooding him. "Aunt? Aunt Qinghong has reached the Purple Mansion Realm? No wonder... no wonder the rainstorms were so violent that day, the thunder incessant. Changxiao was so sinister and powerful... did she escape unharmed? Is she... Dragon-kin?"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his voice low. "Exactly. In the duel within that Lightning Dao Grotto-Heaven, Lady Qinghong slew all her peers skilled in lightning laws, ascended to the absolute peak, and transformed into the Thunder Body that devours lightning. She is now a Purple Mansion spirit cultivator, the same as Dongfang Heyun."

"Unfortunately, she cannot move freely. She has marked out a territory for herself beyond Crimson Reef Island, calling it the Lie Sea, where she guards the Thunder Pool. At that time, the Daoist Master was battling Changxiao all across the outer sea, and their fight passed near her territory, so she intervened!"

Li Ximing was speechless. He closed his eyes, his voice catching slightly as he whispered, "I... I can finally give the Old Master an answer."

The news about Li Qinghong was unquestionably the greatest news since his own breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. Li Zhouwei also smiled, giving Li Ximing a moment to absorb it before speaking softly again. "Thinking back, Dongfang Heyun formed a connection with our family so early on. It’s hard to say if he knew something like this would happen in the future... wanting to foster good relations with a colleague... After all, that man shares the same lifespan as the Dragon Monarch. Don't be fooled just because most of the Dragon-kin can order him around. He holds many secrets."

Hearing this, Li Ximing was struck by a chilling realization. "If that's the case, then Aunt is already deeply involved in the machinations behind the lightning-devouring incident that the Dragon-kin are participating in. She certainly can't extricate herself... No wonder she can't contact the family. If our family got entangled in that... it would mean total annihilation."

Li Zhouwei’s voice grew quieter. "As for that senior in Jiangbei... it is the Great Ancestor."

"Great Ancestor?!"

"Li Qianyuan!"

Li Zhouwei’s expression was grim as he recounted everything Dongfang Lieyun had told him. Li Ximing was utterly horrified. He stood stunned for a long time before understanding finally dawned. "No wonder..." he muttered, his gaze distant. "No wonder Tinglan told me not to return, despite all the trouble in Jiangnan... No wonder the Great Xiukui Monastery warned me not to interfere! It had nothing to do with the Supreme Yang dominating things. It was simply because our family’s identity is toxic!"

One event after another flashed through his mind. His face darkened. "Is the Great Ancestor truly without consciousness? But the Bright Yang Dao places heavy emphasis on hierarchy and bloodline. Even if he lacks awareness, how could a mighty Golden Core expert be completely oblivious to his own descendants?"

"Chen Yang... Chen Yang also has Li blood! His lineage is actually very close to the source. When he went to the riverbank, the True Monarch immediately saw him as prime material. Could that also be related? A natural, inherent favorability..."

After hearing this analysis, Li Zhouwei frowned. "If that’s the case... all the other major powers are watching. I fear this has already become collaborating evidence for those trying to deduce the truth."

Li Ximing's thoughts grew increasingly tangled and complex. "Our family must avoid suspicion," he whispered. "No wonder everyone I met warned me not to touch this... I fear there is no telling how many Daoist Masters, or even True Monarchs, are currently watching our family."

Li Zhouwei nodded grimly. Li Ximing’s thoughts, however, were growing clearer. "The karmic debt between the Buddhist cultivators and our family has reached such proportions—even the fundamental cultivation method of the Buddhist Land was derived from the Wei Li family. How could they *not* want to eradicate us to settle the cause and effect? From Lord Tongya to Lord Xuanling, and then to Lord Xuanfeng... I fear many of them are hoping to 'convert' our family into the Buddhist Land, just like that Undefeated King of Brightness!"

The memory of how those Merciful Ones had looked at him like frenzied zealots was still vivid. If Lingmei hadn't been there to suppress them, Li Ximing would likely have been injured again. He recounted these recent events, his expression turning cold. "The Northern Buddhists are our greatest enemy. This karmic destiny is inescapable. Even I am in grave danger!"

Li Zhouwei was deeply worried. "That is exactly why. I feel I cannot wait another day, especially after hearing about those Maha... Every day I reach the Purple Mansion Realm sooner is perhaps one fraction more leeway we will have."

Li Ximing took his words to heart, feeling the weight of the threat even more keenly. He gradually calmed his emotions. There was more to discuss, but what he most wanted to know right now was the progress of Li Zhouwei’s secret arts. With considerable anticipation, he asked, "The *Radiant Essence Scripture*. The secret arts within it are difficult, but they shouldn't be much of an obstacle for you. Counting the time since you left the Lake... you've had perhaps three solid years of stable cultivation. How many have you completed?"

When he mentioned this, a bright smile finally crossed Li Zhouwei's face. "Reporting to the Daoist Master: my cultivation base was sufficient, so I tested all nine secret arts first. Among them, the [Imperial Command] is already complete. As for [Myriad Arms Prefecture] and [Great Fissure], I... already have cultivation in them..."

'Already has cultivation in them? Meaning he didn't even need to train them; they were already complete?'

Li Ximing looked like he wanted to speak but stopped himself, his expression complicated. Li Zhouwei continued, "On my way here from the Hetian Sea, I cultivated both [Myriad Arms Prefecture] and [Great Fissure] concurrently, and both have been successfully mastered..."

"Ah?"

That single sentence struck Li Ximing like a bolt of lightning. He stared in disbelief. "Cultivated [Myriad Arms Prefecture] and [Great Fissure]? You can cultivate two arts *simultaneously*?"

Li Ximing recalled his own youthful arrogance. Before attempting [Primal Yang], he had sensed the difficulty and estimated he could finish all nine arts within a century. But after spending several years just to complete [Primal Yang], he discovered that the secret arts *repelled* one another. Cultivating them grew exponentially harder. He abandoned the idea of finishing in a century; it wasn't just impossible, he found he couldn't make any progress on the subsequent arts at all.

But if they could be trained simultaneously... Why had he wasted so much effort tackling them one by one? Wouldn't cultivating them sequentially just hinder each other? If he had trained them all together, waiting for all nine to complete at once, wouldn't it have been vastly more efficient? He asked urgently, "Since you can cultivate them simultaneously, don't tackle them one by one! The secret arts conflict with each other; your progress will inevitably slow down. Even with your abnormal talent, by the time you reach the sixth or seventh art... it will probably take years for each one. If you cultivate eight, or even seven, arts concurrently and complete them all together, the total time spent will be drastically reduced!"

Li Zhouwei nodded. "The Daoist Master's thinking is sound. This junior was also worried early on that since [Imperial Command] was already complete, it would vastly increase the difficulty of the remaining arts. My estimates were extremely conservative. However, following your instructions, I first cultivated [Heavenly Lamp] to increase the training speed of the others... yet I discovered... there is no repulsion between the arts at all. In fact, they seem to complement each other. The more I train, the faster I get..."

Li Ximing froze, speechless. Only then did the realization hit him. "No wonder you can train them concurrently."

Li Zhouwei let him process this for a moment before continuing. "This junior completed [Imperial Command] and [Myriad Arms Prefecture] sequentially and noticed a difference. Among the other six arts, [Imperial Command] commands [Great Fissure] and [Primal Yang]. [Myriad Arms Prefecture] links [Heavenly Lamp], [Jewel Steps], and the [Art of Returning Fold]. They actually boost one another..."

"As a result, my cultivation speed became divine. With these two systems completed, I have now mastered seven secret arts. Only [Golden Qilin] and [Red Cicada] remain untouched."

"Seven arts?!"

"Correct."

Li Zhouwei said gravely, "[Imperial Command] is immensely useful. This junior estimates... if I hadn't been inherently born with those arts linked to [Imperial Command], it would have been significantly harder. By my calculations, if I had started cultivating from the Way of Emptiness, it would have taken a full ten years to reach this level of progress."

And Li Ximing, whose talent in the Bright Yang Dao was considered exceptional even among Purple Mansion experts, had spent more than ten years completing just three...

Li Ximing’s expression was indescribably complex. Li Zhouwei came with three arts innately mastered. Even if one counted those as being completed on the road from the Hetian Sea, he had still managed to master four *more* arts in just three or four years... He let out a long sigh. "This... is the destiny of one born and nurtured by heaven and earth!"

"Then, the remaining two..."

At Li Ximing's question, Li Zhouwei replied thoughtfully, "That is precisely why I sought out the Daoist Master. Those remaining two are completely different. Not only are they extremely difficult to inscribe onto the Immortal foundation, but I also feel a significant resistance from them. While I estimate I could complete them if I spent several more years, that is far too long to delay... So, I sought you out. I intend to abandon the remaining two arts and break through to the Purple Mansion Realm immediately!"

Li Ximing stroked his beard, quickly recovering from the shock. He nodded slightly. "However... we currently have no Bright Yang Purple Mansion spiritual objects available. Fortunately, I have a few high-grade Bright Yang pills meant to assist a Purple Mansion breakthrough. They are relatively gentle. They should be able to help you push your Immortal foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint."

As he spoke, he retrieved a small box from his storage bag. Placing it in his palm, he opened it gently, revealing three immaculate white pills that looked as if they were covered in fine scales. They were precisely the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill.

"When I broke through, I used a single pill derived from two Bright Yang treasure medicines. By the time I reached the Juque acupoint, I was on my own. One of these pills should be more than enough for you. I will leave you two, just in case."

This was a Purple Mansion-grade spirit pill, infinitely better than the one Li Ximing had used. Using it would likely waste much of its medicinal potency. Li Zhouwei frowned and tried to refuse, but matters of a Purple Mansion breakthrough allowed for zero negligence. Li Ximing pressed it on him firmly. Li Zhouwei finally relented, accepting only one pill and insisting it was enough.

He then said seriously, "I will give the Daoist Master a stone talisman. If my breakthrough is successful, I will crush it immediately as a signal. Then... I will proceed to the Lake."

He took out the talisman, then retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, handing this back to Li Ximing. Before he could speak, Li Ximing saw the slip and immediately looked awkward. "Oh... this... this thing..."

This was the very jade slip upon which Li Ximing had enthusiastically written over a hundred thousand characters detailing his insights into [Primal Yang]. Looking back now, it seemed like utter nonsense.

Li Zhouwei, however, said gravely, "My own insights from this cultivation session have already been written down and recorded in the latter half of this slip, merging our notes into one volume. Please, Daoist Master, keep it safe. Let it serve as part of our clan’s heritage."



# Chapter 871: Yan Hu

Li Ximing accepted the jade slip. A quick scan revealed only about a hundred thousand new characters had been added. He turned his head and asked:

"If you enter seclusion at Zongquan, the spiritual veins will still be insufficient. Fortunately, I have a [Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill]. Seal it within a spirit formation and use spirit stones and other resources to catalyze its spiritual energy. That should suffice for your needs."

Li Zhouwei acknowledged this and replied in a low voice, "Zongquan is, after all, territory of the Zhu South Water Mansion. With our connections to both Dingjiao and the Thunder Pool, it is the safest possible location. Daoist Master, please rest assured."

Having considered this, he untied the Profound Pattern Vase from his waist and placed it in Li Ximing’s hands. "This spirit artifact has been refined for many years, and its power is immense," he explained. "In the hands of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, any opponent it strikes—even a direct disciple of the Three Great Sects—will be left dead or crippled. It would be better to entrust it to Jiangqian and Li Que'wan for their protection."

"Good."

Li Ximing was perhaps the only person who understood the true source of the vase's power. The materials of the Profound Pattern Vase were astonishing, but only his Valley Wind Guide-Fire ability could continuously enhance its might. He accepted the item without further comment.

Li Zhouwei mulled it over and added, "Regarding our two direct descendants at Purple Smoke: Li Quexi's cultivation technique is superior, so she receives more attention. Although Li Queyi is the elder sister, her personality is gentle, and she cultivates the Jade True technique. Purple Smoke inevitably overlooks her somewhat, which worries the family."

Li Ximing listened, recalling a vague impression of the situation. He watched Li Zhouwei salute and depart. As the great formation closed, Li Ximing transformed into a streak of light and flew away, sighing internally.

'That settles one matter. But this Profound Pattern Vase... I must be careful. If I continue refining it indefinitely, I can no longer conveniently gift it to someone else.'

The Profound Pattern Vase was, after all, inscribed with the name 'Li Qianyuan.' The Li family knows it is a powerful artifact. If Li Ximing keep refining it until a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator can wield power approaching the Purple Mansion Realm, it will undoubtedly attract unwanted attention.

'The other great families are sharp-eyed; I cannot underestimate them. Either I stop enhancing it at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm and then bestow it, or I keep it for my own use. After all, such power is far less dangerous—and appears far more reasonable—in the hands of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.'

As his own strength increased, the efficacy of his Valley Wind Guide-Fire grew exponentially. It was largely thanks to this ability that Li Ximing's alchemy skills advanced at lightning speed, free from worry. His profound fire control techniques were now likely known even within the Supreme Yang Dao, and this growing reputation conveniently served to mask the truth of the Profound Pattern Vase.

'Since it must coordinate with Talisman Qi, acquiring a Purple Mansion spiritual flame is also critical to increasing my strength. But with the flourishing of water and fire elements, spiritual flames are certainly no cheaper than spiritual artifacts. Some of the rarest ones are worth even more.'

He traversed the Great Void above the Eastern Sea on his way back. Wary that Changxiao might intercept him mid-journey, he skirted the coastline of the Eastern Sea until he reached Lin'an Prefecture. From there, he cut through the territory of the Great Xiukui Monastery, bypassed Tiger's Frontier, and soon the Purple Smoke Blessed Land came into view.

He still had alchemy-related questions for Tinglan, but he estimated she was still in seclusion and could not be disturbed. Since no one else in the sect possessed her specific legacy, he couldn't ask anyone else. However, since he was already here, he might as well show his concern.

Secondly, his clan's two direct descendants were cultivating in this blessed land. Li Ximing felt he should at least see them. He brought two Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pills with him, stopping at the blessed land intending to pay a visit.

As expected, the one who came to greet him was Qian Lizi of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. She was exceptionally beautiful in her purple dress, flanked by cultivators who bowed deeply. In Qian Lizi's eyes, Li Ximing had rushed back specifically for the sake of Purple Smoke. Deeply grateful, she thanked him twice before saying, "The blessed land will forever remember the Daoist Master's aid. Please, take the seat of honor!"

Li Ximing nodded. Following them inside, he indeed saw a young woman waiting amidst the Purple Smoke. She possessed a refined beauty and a tranquil, detached aura. A sword was fastened at her waist, and she wore a round, gold-backed, pale blue artifact around her neck. Her eyes were bright as she bowed and said softly, "Li Quexi pays respects to the Daoist Master."

Li Ximing glanced at her, reasonably satisfied. As expected of the Supreme Yang Dao, the artifacts Li Quexi wore were vastly superior to those of the descendants back at the lake. "Your cultivation is fast," he remarked. "You have already reached Qi Refining."

Qian Lizi signaled, and Li Quexi moved to wait respectfully by Li Ximing’s side. "Reporting to the Daoist Master," she said deferentially, "this junior consumed the [Purple Smoke Cloud-Cliff Qi]. I have now received the peak's secret talisman and have entered the area beneath the Purple Terrace to cultivate."

This was treatment reserved for inner disciples of the Purple Smoke Gate, most of whom were already Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. For Li Quexi to enter while only at the Qi Refining stage was clearly a gesture of goodwill resulting from Li Ximing's intervention.

Li Ximing nodded, saying nothing more. Instead, he looked directly into her eyes and asked, "Where is your sister?"

The Profound Light in his eyes was penetrating. Even Qian Lizi hesitated, daring not to interject. Li Quexi respectfully replied, "Sister Queyi is cultivating in the Eastern Sea. My Eldest disciple-brother is also there. According to his reports... Sister Queyi's cultivation is progressing well. She is already at the sixth level of Qi Refining."

Hearing this, Li Ximing nodded silently. He immediately understood that the two sisters were not close, and he sighed inwardly. 'It makes sense... After a long separation, even blood brothers grow distant, let alone Li Quexi, whose very name implies she was brought to the Island much later. I cannot expect the two of them to be perfectly united...'

Qian Lizi quickly interjected, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, my Daoist Master is waiting for you on the platform..."

"Oh?" This genuinely surprised Li Ximing. He said no more, ascending the steps and vanishing into the swirling Purple Smoke.

Qian Lizi remained where she was. After a long moment, she sighed, leading Li Quexi back. "Sixth level is sixth level. Why did you have to mention your disciple-brother? It only highlights that you sisters do not correspond and have grown estranged."

Li Quexi bowed in apology. "Master... The Daoist Master possesses divine abilities. I answer what he asks; I say what there is to be said. The clan gave me life, the sect raised me; I hold gratitude for both. He is a Daoist Master, after all. There is nothing I should hide from the Daoist Master."

Qian Lizi could only shake her head helplessly. "You and your Eldest disciple-brother perhaps share the same mentality, yet your actions are diametrically opposed. Very well, go. Return to your cultivation..."

...

The purple mist drifted ethereal.

When Li Ximing stepped onto the Purple Smoke platform, Tinglan was indeed standing there. She was not wearing her usual autumn-yellow dress, having changed into loose-fitting purple robes that lent her an ethereal air. More importantly, her complexion was ruddy; she looked completely unharmed.

But when Li Ximing looked using the Profound Light between his brows, he faintly perceived a purple token. He knew instantly that the Tinglan before him was an apparition reliant on a spiritual artifact, not her true body.

Even so, such a wondrous technique still astonished Li Ximing. "What an incredible spiritual artifact!"

Tinglan smiled, making no effort to hide it. "This is the [Transit Token]," she said openly. "It is a spiritual artifact gifted to our sect's founder by that eminent figure from Cultivation Transcendence. It now qualifies as an ancient spiritual artifact. While it possesses no offensive capabilities, it can project a likeness across distances. As long as the Great Void remains stable, it can manifest this double from a hundred li away."

'So it does have a distance limitation...'

Given that transmitting one's voice was currently more difficult than at any other point in history, this spiritual artifact would be unbelievably useful if it lacked a distance restriction. But as Li Ximing considered it, he realized something even more profound. "Fellow Daoist, this means you are healing..."

"Correct." Tinglan's attitude was much warmer than when they first met. She spoke softly, "With this spiritual artifact, I can simultaneously heal, read scriptures, and manage the sect. The only thing I cannot do is actively cultivate."

"How remarkable!" Li Ximing nodded in amazement. He retrieved the Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pills from his sleeve. "You are injured, after all. I was worried, so I brought some medicine. These two were refined using Pristine Water; the effect is quite potent..."

Tinglan accepted them and chuckled. "You are too courteous. Is there something you need my help with?"

Li Ximing sighed. "It concerns that treasure pill, the [Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill]. Your alchemy records are profound. I learned much from refining that pill, and I was considering refining similar pills myself. Although I lack a treasure like the [Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness], I can attempt similar elixirs. That is when I recalled what you said long ago."

"You mentioned it should be consumed when breaking through to the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. I am unsure why... and I wondered if there is an auxiliary method involved..."

"Ah, so it was about this." Tinglan smiled. "Wait here."

She dispatched someone, who returned from the repository with a jade slip. She handed it generously to Li Ximing. "This is the method that accompanies the pill formula. It's a consumption technique summarized by our predecessors; there are different ways to take it at different stages. It isn't *required* that one takes it at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough, it's just that this specific stage ensures the least medicinal power is wasted, and the foundation is not yet so rigid that it cannot be altered. Zhaojing just needs to follow the variations described within."

The [Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill] came with its own specialized method for improving one's immortal foundation. Normally, the Purple Smoke Gate would never give such a thing away freely. This was, he assumed, repayment for his previous favors.

Li Ximing was indeed planning to improve Li Minggong's Dao foundation, and he possessed more than one [Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill]. He thanked Tinglan. The woman replied, "I heard about the matter in the north. The Great Xiukui Monastery cannot lower itself to intervene directly. Things having reached this point... this is the only outcome."

Li Ximing now understood that the "one in the north" was Li Qianyuan. He dared not say much, only replying, "I apologize for troubling Fairy Qiuhu. I must refine a spirit embryo in the coming years, and I also have new insights requiring seclusion. I cannot participate in the affairs of the north..."

He considered this carefully. Recalling his earlier thoughts about the spiritual flame and feeling the pinch of resources, he decided it would be a waste not to ask while he had the chance. He deliberately mentioned, "Here in Jiangnan, it is hard enough just to find treasure medicines. Where would one find natural Purple Mansion-level spirit items? ...Even Foundation Establishment-level materials are difficult to obtain. If I need Purple Mansion resources and spiritual flames for alchemy... I don't know where I would even begin to look."

"Since I achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, I have never once discovered Purple Mansion resources, which makes alchemy very inconvenient..."

Tinglan shook her head. "That is indeed a troublesome matter. Purple Mansion resources and spiritual flames cannot be found in ordinary places. Although Jiangnan has abundant spiritual qi, it is also teeming with cultivators. Any location with decent spiritual veins or earth veins was claimed for cultivation long ago. How could anything have the time to mature?"

"If you wish to acquire Purple Mansion items, there are only two places nearby: the Eastern Sea and the Southern Borderlands. The Dragon-kin are tyrannical and difficult to negotiate with. The Southern Borderlands, however, are covered in countless mountains."

"Furthermore, the Southern Borderlands extend continuously to the southwest, following the coast to the nation of Shendu. If you cross the gorge there, you will find a vast, uninhabited jungle, easily the size of the Wuyue region. This all belongs to the territory of the Southern Borderlands Demon Kings. Most of the Daoist traditions in Wuyue maintain contact with the Southern Borderlands. They rely on them to scrape together Purple Mansion spirit items—after all, humans are masters of a hundred crafts, making trade convenient for both sides."

She added a reminder, "Isn't Quanwu Mountain very close to my blessed land? The demon races call it the 'Mountain of Exiles.' Many of the Demon beasts inside fled from the Southern Borderlands. Find a useful one. Have him go to the Southern Borderlands to gather information and facilitate trades for you. It won't be efficient, but year after year, you are bound to gain something."

This advice caused sudden realization for Li Ximing. He nodded repeatedly. "That is a truly brilliant idea. It is the Southern Borderlands, after all. No matter which human I send, they won't have the convenience of a Demon beast. And because they would be native to the region, they will already understand the customs and the Demon Kings..."

"Exactly," Tinglan said casually. "Especially in recent years. The northern Southern Borderlands border Jiangnan, and they are jointly influenced by the current spiritual aura—the [Inward Heart Surging Profundity]. The twelve lucid qis are causing the virtue of fire to swell. Whether it's spirit materials or spiritual flames, this is the most flourishing time for them. The aura in the southern Southern Borderlands is influenced by Shitang; it is the [Jia-Yi Configuration] of the Upright Wood spiritual aura. There will be no shortage of spirit medicines either!"

After saying this, Tinglan added a warning, "This spiritual aura will only last for so many years. Right now is the perfect time for your needs. Send someone to inquire as soon as possible. Every day you wait is one less day of collection time!"

Li Ximing nodded emphatically. 'It's a good thing I asked. If I had waited until something happened involving the True Monarch, or the Great Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery fell, or someone else broke through, the spiritual aura would shift. I would have missed this opportunity entirely!'

He indicated that he understood. Tinglan saw him out, her expression fraught with worry, clearly still preoccupied with the affairs in Jiangbei.

Li Ximing, however, did not delay. He traveled as a streak of light, passing the Purple Smoke Blessed Land and calculating the route. It was only a short jump to Quanwu Mountain, located in the center of Yue State.

The number of Demon beasts on Quanwu Mountain had increased significantly in recent years, most of them refugees from the Southern Borderlands. Although they were primarily Foundation Establishment-level demons, most possessed some skill. This place, which had once been the backyard where Azure Pond vanquished demons, was now neglected. Looking down from above, one could see demonic smoke rolling everywhere.

Most Demon beasts in the Eastern Sea had powerful backings, and the outer-sea demons kept their heads down. Only Azure Pond had access to such a treasure trove. Li Ximing himself was running low on Essence Gathering Pills and also needed materials for sacrificial rites. He descended as a beam of light, landing on the mountain range's peak.

Black light flickered from the highest Demon Cave. It appeared two Demon beasts were in the middle of a vicious fight. Amidst the roiling black smoke, a dog demon cultivator, his hair and beard standing on end, was locked in a desperate battle with a Bei demon that had taken human form.

Li Ximing assessed them in a glance. The dog demon was faring poorly; the opposing Bei demon had the upper hand and was still maintaining its human shape. Its bloody aura was horrific, a clear sign it had devoured countless humans. Li Ximing materialized as the Profound Light, standing firm within the surging black wind.

Both demons paled. Li Ximing wasted no words. He raised his hand and casually lifted. The Bei demon was instantly forced back into its true form, falling into his grasp, immobilized. The dog demon immediately became as docile as a chicken. "Milord!" it yelped. "We were instructed by Great King Hu! We have not eaten any humans!"

Li Ximing didn't care about some 'King Hu' or 'King Mao.' He asked casually, "Oh? This senior lackey you speak of... did he flee from the Southern Borderlands?"

The dog demon scrambled to reply, "Milord's divine abilities are all-knowing! Great King Hu did indeed flee from the Southern Borderlands. He was guided by a great personage from Moongaze Lake, and thus renounced his evil ways! He occupies a peak on this mountain, accumulating merit and protecting the common people..."

'He's using my family's name!' This was no small matter. Li Ximing paused, his interest finally piqued. A faint smile touched his lips. "Good, good. Which peak is he on?"

The dog demon had been speaking without confidence; few demons on Quanwu Mountain actually believed the tiger king's claims. It only hoped to escape. Hearing the question, it sold out its great king without hesitation, pointing in a specific direction. But before it knew what was happening, the world spun, and it was instantly transported to the location it had indicated.

A dark void lay ahead, lit only by two points of light. Clearly, they hadn't just arrived *on* the peak; they were already deep inside the Demon Cave.

'A divine ability... This is the Purple Mansion Realm...'

Li Ximing glanced at the cavern door and lifted his chin. The dog demon, dripping sweat, hurried forward, pushed the door open, and immediately knelt to the side. A cold voice barked from within: "Why do you enter without announcing!"

Seated on the central throne was a broad-faced, black-haired middle-aged man. His features were domineering. He wore dark robes, and a pure white long spear stood beside him. His dark pupils glared from beneath furrowed brows.

The iridescent light of a divine ability instantly reflected in those dark pupils.

In the next instant, the middle-aged man tumbled heavily from his throne. He rolled several times across the ground, his robes falling away and the white spear clattering beside him. He shuffled forward on his knees, his voice dripping with subservience. "This lowly demon... this lowly demon Yan Hu pays his respects to the Daoist Master! Respects to the Divine Ability! This one failed to welcome you; this one is too ashamed to rise!..."

Yan Hu recognized the Demon beast dangling from the cultivator's hand at a glance. He had fought that rival for decades. Not only had Yan Hu been unable to defeat him, but he had also been pushed into increasingly dire straits. Yet now, in the blink of an eye, that rival was utterly finished!

The Daoist Master before him swept his gaze over Yan Hu, and the mere look caused the demon to ache with phantom pain. His life rested on this person's whim. Terrified, Yan Hu forced the bitter words out: "This lowly demon... this lowly demon has some dealings with a master from Moongaze Lake... This one has never eaten humans! Please, Daoist Master, for their sake, spare this lowly life..."

The Daoist Master in the white and gold robes chuckled. "Do tell... I was unaware that anyone from *my* lake was interacting with you."

This sentence plunged the cavern into silence. The Demon beast finally realized the truth: 'This is Daoist Master Zhaojing!'

The tiger demon broke out in a cold sweat. Racking his brain, he kowtowed repeatedly. "Years ago... years ago, Daoist Qinghong from the lake came to Quanwu and offered this lowly demon guidance in combat! This demon benefited immensely, grateful beyond words, and offered a [Blood-Dawn Fruit] in return... But the master did not leave a name, only claiming to be from the north and that we might meet again... This lowly demon yearned for that day, but never knew the master's origin..."

"Later, the master's reputation shook the world, and thunder pealed over the river. Only when I heard the news did I realize it was the Daoist from the lake... Since then, I have waited day and night, diligently awaiting the master's return..."

'Blood-Dawn Fruit...' Li Ximing actually remembered the name of that spirit fruit.

Back when the Li family had not yet risen and was still destitute, they had sought to connect with Li Encheng—father of Li Quantao of the Wei Li branch—using exactly this rare Jiangnan [Blood-Dawn Fruit]!

And that [Blood-Dawn Fruit] was what Li Qinghong had obtained from this very Yan Hu, given to Li Xizhi, and ultimately exchanged for Essence Gathering Pills...

'So this is where that strand of karma began!'

Li Ximing knew this Demon beast was glossing over the details, speaking vaguely, and only trying to latch onto this connection now that he was in the Purple Mansion Realm. Still, his family *had* taken the spirit fruit from this creature back then, which must have felt like a sudden disaster for the demon. Amused, Li Ximing asked, "Do you still regret losing the [Blood-Dawn Fruit]?"

The Demon beast peeked at his expression, then kowtowed rapidly, weeping. "If not for offering that fruit and gaining a sliver of immortal protection, this lowly demon would have been captured and refined into a pill ten years ago! How could I have survived to this day..."

Li Ximing rarely encountered such a smooth-talking Demon beast. He sat upon the throne and appraised him. "What offense did you commit that made you flee to this Mountain of Exiles?"

The tiger demon hurried to explain. "This lowly one was a patrolman in a region of the Southern Borderlands. One time, I mistakenly delivered the wrong ingredients, displeasing General White Macaque... I knew I had messed up. It just so happened my own King was fighting a great war and killed the White Macaque, so I escaped calamity and gained my freedom. But who knew his younger brother, Black Macaque, would take his place! In desperation, this lowly demon gathered the spirit items he was transporting and fled overnight to the Mountain of Exiles..."

"Now... seventy years have passed." He lowered his head. "The matter is in the past, but I can never dare return... Those spirit items I seized the chance to steal were either used to aid my cultivation or were extorted by passing human cultivators... They were used up many years ago..."

Li Ximing listened to this trivial history and asked casually, "It has been seventy years. Are you still familiar with the Southern Borderlands?"

Yan Hu's eyes lit up when he heard this, sensing an opportunity. He nodded frantically. "Though this lowly one left, I am still familiar with the Five Ranges north of Shahuan! If I just have some spirit items... integrating myself back in would be extremely simple..."

"Enough." Li Ximing nodded. "We said back then we would give you an opportunity, and my family does not go back on its word. I need a Demon beast to carry messages to the Southern Borderlands. You will follow me."

Yan Hu was instantly overcome with ecstasy. He scrambled forward from the floor and kowtowed respectfully, crying out, "This one is willing to die for the Daoist Master!"

Yan Hu knew his life here was precarious, surviving day to day. He had survived this long only by being strong, groveling, spending his wealth, and borrowing the reputation of others. How much longer could he last? But if he submitted to a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, even a peak Foundation Establishment demon general would have to respectfully call him 'Sir.' He could walk with his head held high in the Southern Borderlands while on orders... He had definitely seen what those demons who served as dogs for Purple Mansion cultivators looked like when they came to the Southern Borderlands!

He practically wept with joy. Li Ximing lifted him up with a beam of light. The dog demon nearby watched, stunned. 'Th-th-this... He really *did* have a connection! Then why was he squatting here suffering all this time?'

Yan Hu, trembling with delight behind them, couldn't be bothered with the dog demon, hoping only that it wouldn't try to tag along. Li Ximing, meanwhile, had his own considerations.

It was true that he and Yan Hu shared a strand of karma, but karma alone wasn't enough to warrant taking this demon in. First, the Demon beast's turbid aura was weak; clearly, he had not dared to eat humans all these years. Second, this Demon beast was quick-witted and experienced, which would make handling matters more convenient.

There was one other key point. This Demon beast possessed the [Hurricane Ghost Yin] foundation.

'I have obtained several Myriad Secrets Daoist traditions—be they spell arts or escape techniques—but I currently have no cultivator aligned with the [Hurricane Ghost Yin]. Although Demon beasts of these common bloodlines are generally considered inferior, this demon cultivator's cultivation isn't bad. He is already in the late Foundation Establishment Realm. If he trains in these techniques, he can still be put to good use.'

Flying into the Great Void, Li Ximing raised an eyebrow and said quietly, "When the time comes, I will send you to the Southern Borderlands. You will bear the imprint of my divine ability and visit the various demon clans. You are to inquire about spirit items and spiritual flames on my behalf. Do you understand?"

Yan Hu nodded quickly and said respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master! This servant witnessed such things back in the day... I have some understanding. I will absolutely not disappoint the Daoist Master!"

"Mm." Li Ximing glanced at him. "You will be representing my family, after all. When we return to the lake, you will receive my Island's Six Dams Secret Technique. You will also learn one or two escape techniques and movement skills. I will find someone to outfit you with armor, and *then* I will send you to the Southern Borderlands."



# Chapter 872: Crimson Light

Yan Hu stood in the light, gazing at the pitch-black Great Void, which he had never seen before. He couldn't help but worry:

‘According to my fellows, being captured by a Daoist Master means being forced back into your original form to serve as their mount... If I maintain this human body, am I being disrespectful?’

‘But this person’s movements are unpredictable. I’ve never heard of him before, so I don’t know if he already has a mount... If I’m ridden back, I might offend a others before I even reach the lake...’

He knew he wasn't irreplaceable, which only made him more cautious. He glanced around nervously. The Profound Light beneath his feet didn't even seem large enough for his true form to stand on. Yet, in the time it took for these thoughts to cross his mind, they had already broken through the Great Void, and a shimmering lake surface appeared below.

In the middle of the lake was a great island—Pingya Island. Pillars of purple-gold, covered in intricate patterns, stood upon the land. They varied in height, projecting an air of solemn dignity. Cultivators flew back and forth across the island, creating a bustling scene.

Li Ximing's spiritual sense swept the area. The island's main hall was currently under construction. He flew directly toward the Viewing Pavilion Platform.

Spiritual flames raged upon the Viewing Pavilion Platform. Golden and purple fires intertwined. A ceaseless torrent of Li Fire and Baleful Qi poured into the conflagration, causing it to surge in violent waves. Six Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators sat cross-legged on the platform, circulating their dharma power to refine the spirit embryo.

Witnessing this magnificent sight, Yan Hu, standing to the side, shrank his neck. He felt the suffocating pressure radiating from the flames and dared not make a sound.

As Li Ximing expected, Li Jiangqian was there. Seeing Li Ximing arrive, he stepped forward and bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master! Reporting to the Daoist Master... Senior Chu has arrived at the Viewing Pavilion Platform!"

Chu Minglian was old, but his arms were powerful, and his build likely rivaled Ding Weizeng's. He wore red robes, with iron tools hanging from his waist. He walked to the front and bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Chu Minglian was truly an old senior of the Li family, having seen several generations pass. In the past, when they met on the river, Li Ximing would have had to call him senior. Now that Li Ximing was a Daoist Master, it was naturally Chu Minglian who bowed to him.

Li Ximing simply used his divine ability to lift the man. "Old sir, there is no need for such courtesy."

Chu Minglian seemed overcome with emotion. He spoke softly, "When I was young... I forged artifacts right here on Pingya Island. I never thought that after more than a hundred years, the world would be turned upside down. Divine abilities mastered, capable of shifting the tides... and yet, when I return to this lake... it is still to forge artifacts!"

Li Ximing smiled in response. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve—one recording the concepts he had formulated long ago—and handed it to the old man.

"Old sir, please take a look at this first."

This was naturally not *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*. That text was far too difficult for the Foundation Establishment Realm. Instead, this slip contained Li Ximing’s own calculations. He signaled Li Jiangqian over, casually handing the wolf-demon to him.

"Send the twelve people over... This Tiger Demon is one I brought back from the Quanwu Mountains. He will be of great use later. Use the Six Dams Matched Life Method to secure him first, and give him some spell arts to study."

Li Jiangqian immediately nodded and led the Tiger Demon away. Li Ximing turned back, speaking softly:

"I invited the old sir here this time for this spirit embryo. Others may not be familiar with the Chu clan’s artifact forging techniques, but my family understands them well. They are the finest we have ever seen... Back then, Daoist Master Tianque ...also had He Ting forge his spirit embryo. Since the old sir's skills are even greater, I trust there will be no issues."

Besides that point, the spirit embryo Daoist Master Tianque had forged was complex. He began refining it right after he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm. It was nurtured by the immortal foundation of forty-five Daoist traditions plus a century of time from a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. In the end, it even consumed He Ting himself. This showed how much effort was invested... They were the Golden Feather Sect, after all. It was clearly not something a technique like *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire* could compare to. The difficulty of the Li family's current endeavor was naturally much lower.

Chu Minglian stroked his beard while reading the jade slip, nodding silently.

"Daoist Master, the ingenuity of this platform's design... leaves this lowly one utterly astounded... If it is a matter of refining Li Fire and adding Baleful Qi, this lowly one can manage those tasks... But this Bright Yang spiritual essence... I fear I am not competent to handle it."

Li Ximing nodded. "This part will naturally be handled by my divine ability. However, I do not understand artifact forging; I am relying on the mysteries of the ancient method and the augmentation of this high tower. You will remain nearby, adding the fire and baleful qi, guiding the tempering process. I will assist you with my divine ability. Together, we will perfect the spirit embryo."

Chu Minglian visibly relaxed. Although he had accumulated significant wealth over the years, he could not afford to compensate them if the spirit embryo was ruined. Li Ximing, however, was full of anticipation. He rode the light upward and took the ink-black, jade-like round stone from his sleeve.

Within the round stone was a swath of brilliant golden color. Li Ximing explained its origin to Chu Minglian. The old man was stunned at first, then sighed deeply. Unexpectedly, he replied:

"May the Daoist Master not laugh... This old man... saw the Shield of White Sun in my early years... I have some experience with it."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing reacted quickly, understanding immediately. He thought:

‘Chu Yi... That’s right. This old master is the same as Qian Lizi... They are both part of the legacy left behind by the previous generation's 'Great One'. When the various families divided the spoils, Purple Smoke took Qian Lizi, and this old master was acquired by the Ning family...’

This was a significant matter. Li Ximing nodded, listening as he continued:

"That 'Great One'... his weapon at the time was... forged using Celestial Yang Radiant Copper as the body, integrating both Radiant Sky Stone and the Shield of White Sun, and etched using White Dew Blood..."

"In the very beginning, it was just a piece of spirit copper. He acquired a piece of the Shield of White Sun about the size of a fingernail and asked me to merge it... At the time, I was shocked by his profound fortune, but I did not know the true extent of it."

Li Ximing had heard from Li Zhouwei that Chu Yi was also the Wei Grand Ancestor. He was inwardly alarmed, but since both Qian Lizi and Chu Minglian had been employed by their respective families without issue, he listened in silence.

Chu Minglian merely smiled. "He has gone to Mount Luoxia now... There has been no news for so many years. I understand he wishes to sever his mortal ties and does not want to see us. If the Daoist Master happens to see that Great One anywhere, I beg you to ask after his cultivation. If you could just give this lowly one a single word... how many divine abilities has he achieved? When this lowly one offers incense to the ancestors... it would add to the joy..."

Li Ximing remained silent, answering in a low voice: "He is, after all, a 'Great One' of Luoxia, one of the figures at the very pinnacle. I fear I will not have the opportunity to meet him..."

Chu Minglian waved his hands hastily. "My apologies... My apologies."

Li Ximing lightly tossed the ink-jade stone in his hand. The brilliant light within flowed like water, falling into the flames. Layers upon layers of Profound Light emerged. The twelve auxiliary towers lit up, and the guest cultivators who had been channeling their power were instantly cut off and forced to withdraw.

The fire was momentarily suppressed, revealing the artifact-ruler within.

Even when used only for nurturing, the power of a True Fire could not be underestimated. Yet the Shichuan was indeed of exceptional quality. After being nurtured by the True Fire for so long, it was only glowing faintly red. As the spiritual essence landed on the ruler, it emitted a sizzling sound.

Immediately, multicolored clouds ascended, shimmering with golden light. The sounds of cicadas chirping and beasts roaring echoed across the sky. Li Ximing felt a pang of heartache watching this:

"I can only hope that consuming such a precious spiritual essence does more than just increase its speed!"

Chu Minglian pressed two fingers together, spitting out his own True Fire. Li Ximing glanced at it, then used his divine ability to wield the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire. He advanced with it, joining the artifact refining. The twelve Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the auxiliary towers also took their seats and began circulating their dharma power.

"RUMBLE!"

Only because the spirit embryo existed in a state between a dharma artifact and a spiritual artifact could they utilize such a shortcut. Instantly, streams of golden runes materialized, landing upon the Shichuan and embedding themselves into it, one by one.

Chu Minglian’s skill was truly profound. Though he spoke humbly, his ability was obvious the moment he acted. Augmented by Li Ximing’s divine ability and True Fire, he was like a fish in water, drawing the runes with complete mastery and zero hesitation.

As light and shadow flickered across the platform, the runes on the jade ruler solidified one after another. Li Ximing released his control and retreated. Chu Minglian remained in the air, directing the dharma power of the others, focusing intently on the nurturing process. The Li family members had long prepared ample Bright Yang spiritual items and Baleful Fire Qi, sending them up along with pills to restore dharma power.

These spiritual items weren't priceless, but some were extremely difficult to find. Only a family as deeply rooted as the Li, with connections to all the surrounding houses, could acquire them so quickly.

Li Ximing brushed his sleeves. Just initiating this process had cost him the better part of half a month, but the gains were significant:

‘Chu Minglian’s status is different, after all. His techniques far exceed my expectations... Coupled with the spiritual essence, and assuming the lake provides sufficient resources... it might not even take two years... The quality will be even better than I originally estimated!’

"In a few more days, we can pull the people back and resume rotating between two shifts."

He entrusted the Viewing Pavilion Platform to Chu Minglian, feeling greatly relieved. He turned and rode his light back toward Qingdu.

Li Ximing had originally come to deliver the good news to Li Xuanxuan. He landed on the Talisman Peak at Qingdu, only to hear the sound of laughter. Raising an eyebrow, he saw a young master dressed in red robes standing outside the courtyard.

This young master held an ornate fan, striking a refined and dashing pose, though his face was powdered, and his posture affected. He was bowing with both hands, calling out:

"Old Master! Old Master! Please listen..."

Li Ximing glanced over and recognized this grandson of his. After all, when the various Li family members had recounted the events of the past years... this kid had helped Zhouluo out once, earning Li Ximing’s rare approval. He wasn't in a hurry, so he paused to listen.

Li Xuanxuan stamped his way down the stairs, holding a staff. "Going to the flower boats again! I told you yesterday, age sixty is a life-and-death threshold! You must cultivate these last few levels of Qi Refining, whether you want to or not. You absolutely must break through!"

Zhouming’s talent wasn't exceptional, about on par with his older brother Zhoufang. Zhoufang had already stagnated, but Zhouming could still cultivate. That he didn't treasure this opportunity truly made Li Ximing frown. He paced forward silently, listening as Zhouming tried to curry favor:

"Not at all... not at all! Old Master, you misunderstand. There is a new play being performed on the painted barge, it’s about Yu Mugao... It’s rare to see such a bold drama! The family isn't short on those few talismans today! I invite you to watch it, sir. It's much better than just sitting stiffly in the courtyard..."

Li Xuanxuan was about to rebuke him when he suddenly spotted Li Ximing. His face lit up with joy, and he descended the steps. Zhouming, realizing his mistake, hurried forward to support him, only to hear a respectful voice call out:

"Grandfather!"

A platinum-gold figure had already moved first, supporting Li Xuanxuan down the steps. Zhouming immediately dropped to his knees with a thud, kowtowing.

"Greetings to the Daoist Master!"

Li Xuanxuan’s eyelids twitched, terrified that Li Ximing would become angry. He took a step forward and snapped, "Get back down and cultivate!"

Li Ximing watched with his hands clasped behind his back, showing no particular temper. He walked inside with Li Xuanxuan, and they sat down in sequence. But Zhouming refused to give up. Having finally gotten a rare chance to see Li Ximing, he shuffled forward on his knees, kowtowing at the courtyard entrance.

"Daoist Master... The Daoist Master's movements are unpredictable, you are so rarely seen... This junior waited at Gardenia Scenery Mountain for a long time, but the Daoist Master never appeared. Father... Father has not seen the Daoist Master in so very long!"

At the mention of Li Chengzhi, his eldest son who lacked a spiritual aptitude, Li Ximing’s demeanor turned cold. A servant brought tea. He accepted the cup, set it down, and said only, "What matter are you begging me for?"

Li Xuanxuan sighed, folding his hands into his sleeves. Zhouming began to weep.

"Father... Father’s health has been failing recently... He relies only on cultivators to extend his life, and I fear he does not have many years left. When the Daoist Master leaves, it is always for three or five years at a time. This junior... this junior only hopes that the Daoist Master might grace him with his immortal presence, to see my father just once!"

Li Ximing seemed to associate this with something else. He shifted his gaze away, staring down at the steps, and sipped his tea. Li Xuanxuan, however, softened considerably. He waved his hand.

"You are dismissed."

The boy retreated unwillingly, his red robes disappearing into the mountain pass. Li Xuanxuan said, "Even if that child is deficient in ten thousand ways, he is at least filial. His mind is also firm and decisive. He’s likable, and with you around, no one below dares to slight him..."

But Li Ximing shook his head. "Who *isn't* decisive? Look sideways, there is Li Chenghao. Look down, there is Zhoufang. There are many children in the primary branch; they all have their own opinions... What is difficult is maintaining one heart. Furthermore, occupying such a position, if he doesn't even have the chance to assail the Foundation Establishment Realm, then there is no need to indulge him."

"He was right about one thing, however. Grandfather, you should indeed watch some plays, listen to some songs, and labor less."

He seemed unaffected by the news of Li Chengzhi. He recounted the recent events, causing Li Xuanxuan to jump to his feet and sit back down repeatedly. Finally, the old man slumped into his chair, weeping tears of joy, his old tears streaming.

"The ancestors are truly protecting us! If not for Qinghong, I fear our family would have just become an Immortal Clan... only to fall straight to the bottom..."

The old man stroked his beard for a long time before finally composing himself. He said solemnly, "Only a few people need to know of this. It is not suitable for a wide announcement."

Li Ximing stood up and paced the courtyard. He hesitated for a long time. Ultimately, feeling that the lake was too close to the north, he decided against mentioning the True Monarch. Just then, a loud clap of thunder erupted, and a storm began to howl outside.

He sensed something. Taking a step forward, he gazed far to the north. He discovered that the gloomy weather was confined only to Jiangnan. The sky over Jiangbei was bright, glowing with a hazy red.

This red light shot straight to the heavens, scattering faint crimson radiance, like blossoms falling. The sound of thunder grew louder and louder. In an instant, Li Ximing’s form dissolved into Profound Light and reappeared on the northern bank.

He remained cautious, not even approaching the riverbank proper, yet he could see the hazy red light enveloping the entirety of Jiangbei. It stood in stark contrast to the violent storm over Jiangnan. A youth cloaked in flame stood in the clouds, emitting boundless radiance.

He held a longsword, pointing it arrogantly toward the firmament. The black-robed cultivator before him was trapped, immobilized by the roiling crimson light. A thunderous roar echoed through the sky:

"Hall of the Locust Soul! I truly have you to thank for this! I have achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, and for all the humiliation I suffered before, I will repay it a hundredfold today!"

Hearing these words, a suspicion Li Ximing had long held was finally confirmed. He sighed heavily in his heart:

‘To make such a vicious vow just upon achieving Foundation Establishment Realm... To demand hundredfold repayment from the Hall of the Locust Soul all by himself... Who else could it be but that Great One?!’



# Chapter 873: The Real and Fake Abyssal Medallion

Li Ximing had only just halted in mid-air when a flurry of rain and snow began to fall. Ning Wan, robed in white, materialized beside him. Her willow-like brows were knitted in worry. She bowed to Li Ximing and said softly, "Daoist Friend Zhaojing... it is the Great One, establishing his immortal foundation... Judging by this celestial phenomenon, it is 'Blazing Fire'."

Li Ximing now understood her concern. Mount Luoxia must have influenced the Great Ancestor to *not* cultivate 'Bright Yang'. If he mastered his own innate divine power, Luoxia probably wouldn't be able to suppress him, even with a thousand methods.

'Back then, 'Chu Yi' was closer to cultivating 'Li Fire'. Now, he cultivates 'Blazing Fire'. Although it's of the fire attribute, it's not as compatible as Li Fire. It's a standard, conventional choice... they've successfully led him astray...'

The two Daoist Masters watched from afar. As the shout from Jiangbei echoed through the air, several figures shot up from below, radiating killing intent. The leader was a burly man with a vicious expression, wielding a large, jet-black hammer. He roared, "You, surnamed Lin! What colossal nerve! We are of the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition! How dare you be so arrogant! If our Hall Master weren't in closed-door cultivation, do you think you'd have succeeded?!"

With Daoist Bai of the Hall of the Locust Soul dead, no one below knew if the so-called "favors" owed by the various Purple Mansion Realm Daoist traditions still counted. These men were terrified but already in too deep. They were trapped; they didn't dare abandon their territory, nor did they dare let the news leak. They all kept it a tightly guarded secret, putting on a false front.

Li Ximing and the others, of course, knew the truth and watched the performance with cold detachment.

Nearby, the flames enveloping Lin Feng finally receded, revealing his appearance. He wore pale white armor that shimmered with hazy colors, a longsword in his hand. Two flames, one pale white and one light red, spiraled around his body, giving him an imposing, majestic aura.

Li Ximing didn't look closely, listening to the voice that boomed through the sky:
"Ridiculous! A gathering of demonic cultivators dares to call itself an inheritor of the Immortal Dao's Daoist tradition? If not for that charlatan Bai, would you lot have the chance to be so impudent!"

He sneered.

"Why don't you show everyone the [Abyssal Gloom Medallion], good sir? That would surely convince us!"

He spoke with absolute confidence. The surrounding crowd was unbothered, assuming it was just a taunt. But the two Daoist Masters on the horizon both froze. They exchanged a look, seeing the helplessness in each other's eyes.
'It seems it really did fall into the Great One's hands!'

The burly man from Jiangbei instantly fell silent. He raised his twin hammers, activated his immortal foundation, and struck with sudden violence!

Although his opponent was a high-level cultivator at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, the youth showed no fear. He raised his longsword, aiming straight for the man's face, and stated coldly, "Pathetic tricks!"

A surge of pale red flame soared into the sky. They clashed several times in just a few breaths. The young man's defiant voice echoed across the heavens:

"If you won't act now, when will you!"

In response, several beams of light erupted from within the ranks of the demonic cultivators below. They struck their own supposed comrades, scattering the black energy and revealing surges of white light. The scene descended into absolute chaos.

"Wu Gui, Tian Fu... you... you traitors!"

"The Song family! You... how dare you side with this bastard while the Capital immortals Dao is occupied!"

Lin Feng stood proudly. As expected, a woman rode the wind to land beside him, wrapping her arm around his. Her eyes were filled with adoration. She smiled, "You brat... you really reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

This woman was none other than Song Yunbai of the Capital immortals Dao, who had been missing and presumed injured for a long time!

"Hahahaha!"

The young man stood with his sword held horizontally, the roaring flames burning the enemy's black qi to cinders. He slowly raised his other hand, palm up, releasing an intense, swirling black and white light.

He was holding an intricately patterned, profound medallion. It pulsed with waves of black and white radiance, so bright it eclipsed the flames in the sky. The crowd of cultivators that had gathered below stared, dumbfounded. A collective, shocked cry rose up:

"[Abyssal Gloom Medallion]!"

This sight made every demonic cultivator on the field freeze. They instinctively scattered. The burly man was even more flustered, roaring, "That's a fake!"

He grit his teeth and finally pulled a medallion from his own sleeve. A brilliant light burst forth, black and white colors swirling together once more. It was another [Abyssal Gloom Medallion]!

"The Great One sees me as his confidant! He entrusted this to me before entering seclusion! All cultivators of the Hall, listen to my command! Surround and kill this man!"

The light from the two medallions clashed in the air. The one in the burly man's hand was more resplendent, its shimmering glow overshadowing the other. In contrast, Lin Feng's medallion looked mottled and damaged, lacking the same grandeur.

Furthermore, the one the man held had most likely come from Daoist Bai, who had been acknowledged by the various great families. Naturally, it held more credibility. The battlefield instantly dissolved into confused chaos. The few who had been turned by Lin Feng quickly gathered around him, forming a protective circle.

Li Ximing watched in silence. Ning Wan sighed softly.

"The Great One is truly formidable... He actually obtained it."

Li Ximing prompted her, and Ning Wan explained in a gentle voice:

"This Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition... does indeed have a profound medallion. We had only seen images of it in ancient books. This one," (the fake) "was commissioned by Sister Tinglan from a friend. Although it matches the descriptions perfectly and uses many elements from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition... well, it's ultimately not the genuine article."

"The original plan was... the Great One's innate status is exceptionally high. Even if the item in his hand was fake, with the blessing of fate, we thought he could at least uncover clues and find a way in, even if he couldn't fool the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition..."

"Who would have thought... whether the original medallion fell from the Great Void long ago, or someone delivered it to the Great One, it seems he's had it ever since he was in the Qi Refining realm..."

Li Ximing nodded. The ancient, original medallion wasn't created to be dazzling, so it naturally wouldn't look as impressive as the contemporary one Tinglan had forged to deceive people. A sliver of hope rose in his heart. "Then, this Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition..."

Ning Wan's voice was tinged with regret.

"It will be very difficult to control the situation now... We cannot influence the subsequent changes in the Secret Diffusion inheritance. We can only watch for now. It shouldn't spread to the south."

Ning Wan didn't have strong feelings about the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition, but Li Ximing, who had seen the mirror fragment in the grotto-heaven, was extremely reluctant to miss this opportunity. Yet, knowing what he knew about the north, he didn't dare act rashly or reveal his thoughts. He could only nod slightly and say impassively, "That would be best."

As they spoke, the great battle in Jiangbei intensified. Li Ximing's brows furrowed as he watched the spiritual qi surge across the sky. After a while, a vast plume of black qi billowed into the heavens, a clear sign that someone had fallen.

Soon, the red light retreated, fleeing westward. The cultivators from the Hall of the Locust Soul were in a state of panic. They actually stopped to rest where they were, not giving chase, allowing the group to retreat in full view.

Ning Wan gazed into the distance and let out a long breath.

"Fortunately, the Great One has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. Unlike the Qi Refining realm, he can't just disperse his cultivation and start over. And now that he has cultivated the 'Blazing Fire' Dao, he has received its divine essence and is set upon that corresponding path of power. He is no longer as terrifying as before."

"His fate is still strong, and no one can stand against him, but he no longer possesses that divine ability to seize a Fruition Attainment from afar and overturn the world with a single thought."

This was valuable information. Li Ximing listened intently, pondering.
'Could it be that because he forged a Blazing Fire Dao foundation, he has deviated from the path of Bright Yang, and that's why this change occurred? Otherwise... given how he could seize a person's spiritual soul with a single glance before... who would ever dare approach him?'

But more important than this news was Luoxia's attitude in the north. Li Ximing felt a deep unease.

"Still... now that the Great One has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, I fear he will come to my lake to pick up Fei Qingya. Are you aware of this, Daoist Friend? We must also inform Xiukui."

No matter how much Li Ximing coveted that Secret Diffusion fragment, he understood that the True Monarch coming south was a perilous event. If it wasn't handled perfectly, it could lead his own clan to eternal damnation.

Li Ximing raised his sleeves and bowed.

"I may need to make a trip to the Southern Borderlands. What are the arrangements from Daoist Master Qiuhu... Is there anything I can do..."

Ning Wan nodded. She hesitated a moment before finally asking, "The Southern Sea has been restless lately. If you have the time, Daoist Friend, I was hoping you could go in my stead..."

"I remember." Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. "Senior Kui Qi mentioned it some days ago. You mean the Great Konghai Temple at Shitang in the Southern Sea, and that Baoqing Maha. I have kept it in mind..."

The Profound Light between his brows flashed. He suddenly added, "He has a subordinate, that Merciful One named Zhuzhen... He even attacked my elder brother."

Zhuzhen was not a formidable figure. Ning Wan wasn't trying to sow discord, only to warn Li Ximing against a potential ambush. She said tactfully, "Zhuzhen is actually afraid of you, so he secretly held back. It ended up enhancing Li Xizhi's reputation."

"That's not a good thing. There's no reputation to be 'enhanced.' A tall tree attracts the wind. Worse, it's a reputation built upon the Buddhist cultivators, and they also say our family is descended from Wei and Li. That karmic connection has been forged. Who knows what variables it will bring in the future!"

Li Ximing shook his head, a faint, cold smile on his face.

"But it's good that he was afraid. If something had actually happened, I would not be having this conversation with this attitude today."

The smile was faint, but the killing intent within it was anything but.

Who was Li Xizhi? Of the 'Four Xi' siblings, only Li Ximing and Li Xizhi remained. Li Ximing had been held in this brother's arms since he was a child. Although they had been separated for many years, and their bond wasn't as deep as with Li Xijun, whom he grew up with, it was not to be underestimated...

The matter with Li Xijun was not a righteous one. When Xiao Chuting came to ask personally, Li Ximing had given his answer, and he could only bury his hatred for Crimson Reef Island in his heart. Now, another offense was added to the tally. If Zhuzhen had killed Li Xizhi, he would have forged a blood feud with both Azure Pond and the Li clan... And Baoqing did not have the divine powers of the original Great Konghai Temple master to protect him!

Ning Wan nodded. "If you go to the Southern Borderlands, Daoist Friend, you could meet with Daoist Friends Zhusheng and Xian Chan. They are, after all, contacts left by Senior Yuanxiu, and they also have a poor relationship with the Great Konghai Temple."

"Good."

Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back, appearing unbothered, but he sighed inwardly.

He understood. From the moment Kui Qi had sought him out, the subsequent arrangements were already set. Whether the matter with Azure Pond in the Southern Sea was urgent was secondary; the key was to send himthis Wei-Li descendant and Bright Yang cultivatoraway.

The various houses had no idea how much control Luoxia truly had over this Great Ancestor. Perhaps Luoxia held the Li clan in utter contempt. Perhaps Luoxia cared for no one except Li Zhouwei. Perhaps if Li Ximing stated his case to Lin Feng's face, he would explode into a cloud of gore before he even finished speaking... But the Li family served at least one obvious purpose: to see who was harboring thoughts about the Great Ancestor.

Clearly, Luoxia's prestige throughout the north, and even the entire mainland, remained at a terrifying level. For now, only the Dragon-kin had made a move. And even though the relationship between Luoxia and the Dragon-kin had never been good, they were still forced to hide and scheme in the Eastern Sea.

Li Ximing, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and even the Golden Feather Sect, could not afford to take such a risk.

As his thoughts reached this point, Li Ximing's understanding crystallized.

'I'm afraid that even without this business with the Northern Buddhists, I would have to return to Jiangnan right now. During the time the True Monarch is visiting the lake, whether I'm a guest at Purple Smoke or staying at Tiger's Frontier, I must be under their watch!'

'Although the True Monarch is just coming to the lake to pick up a woman, and his impression of my family is already good, and his capacity for harming the innocent has lessened since reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm... there is always a 'what if'. What if something goes wrong?'

'If the True Monarch becomes displeased and does something at Moongaze Lake, they must also restrain me immediately, to prevent me from losing my head and rushing to the rescue... That would only cause a disaster and interfere with the plans on both sides...'

'The arrangements the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition has made these past few days, the benefits they've given me, both overt and subtle... a large part of it is probably in hopes that I will follow their plan and not stir up trouble... If I make things ugly for everyone, it will also mean a loss of combat strength for Jiangnan.'

Li Ximing, from before and after his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, had experienced far too much. He was no longer the same person he was back then. He raised his hand slightly.

"I must still make arrangements for my clan. I will depart in the morning!"

Ning Wan was relatively at ease with him. She nodded and watched him leave, then turned her gaze back toward Jiangbei.

"He broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm so casually, without any fuss... It seems it will be very difficult to get a piece of that Secret Diffusion secret cache... I had best see if there are any promising young cultivators instead!"

...

The lake's surface was dazzling. The first thing that caught the eye was the purple-gold profound pillar, radiating a solemn and dignified aura. A bit further off, the Viewing Pavilion Platform projected a pillar of golden-red light into the sky, casting a golden reflection on the water.

Li Ximing pondered as he descended, passing through his clan's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Great Array. Beneath the tallest profound pillar, a hazy purple light marked the inner array.

The inner array originally had buildings, but they were all ruins. Li Ximing had been in a rush to set up the array and hadn't set foot inside. He had spent the last few days dealing with the spirit embryo. After finally getting a moment of peace, he had rushed to Zongquan Island to see Li Zhouwei. This was the first chance he'd had to fly inside.

Passing through the hazy purple light, he saw a stretch of pale yellow, glossy ground, smooth as glazed glass and covered in shallow purple patterns. It was clearly a transformation wrought by the great array's dharma power. Looking up, he saw it was a circular area, no more than a *li* across.

'The spiritual qi is quite good. Since the great array was established, the spiritual qi on the Island is slowly rising, and there's no sign of it stopping. Inside the inner array, it has already reached the level of Gardenia Scenery Mountain... It's enough for Purple Mansion Realm cultivation...'

The area was not small. The Li family's palaces had never been grand; the main hall for handling affairs was only three hundred-some feet wide. This was more than enough space to erect many buildings.

For now, the ground was flat and empty, the ruins clearly having been carted away. All one could see was the yellow, glazed-glass-like ground and the hazy purple canopy of the array. A few cultivators, all at the Qi Refining realm, were busy constructing halls and pavilions. He swept his gaze over them and, as expected, saw Li Jiangqian standing with his hands behind his back. When Li Jiangqian saw Li Ximing, his face first lit up with joy, then revealed a trace of worry. He bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master! The north..."

Li Ximing and the other Daoist Masters had been high in the sky, using their powers to perceive the news from the north. But the battle had just concluded; his family here was clearly unaware. He first scanned with his Immortal Mirror. No one else was spying from the Great Void. Only then did he say with a serious expression:

"Jiangqian, you should have the arrangements in place. Not a single person from our family's direct line on the north shore is to go. Just let him take her. As for the matter of the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture... it was just a passing mention. If it happens, it happens."

"The Great One has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm and will be here soon. Send someone to prepare immediately!"



# Chapter 874: The Secret Diffusion Spirit Sword

"That master has already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, so his influence isn't what it once was. Let Chen Yang go without worry."

Li Ximing didn't say more. That single sentence was enough to make Li Jiangqian’s expression turn serious. He bowed and said:

"This junior understands..."

Li Ximing nodded at him and said softly, "I still need to make a trip to the Southern Borderlands. Qiuhu will watch over things at home, but I am leaving matters in your hands for now. Remember one thing: do not, under any circumstances, let any direct descendant interfere."

Even knowing Li Jiangqian was cautious, Li Ximing reminded him yet again. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, placed it in Li Jiangqian's hand, and waved him off.

"Go immediately and retrieve these spirit objects. We also have a 'Drum-Mystery Treasure Flower' and a 'Golden Obedient Flame Fruit' in our stores. Take them all out and have Minggong deliver them here."

Li Jiangqian left at once. Soon, Li Minggong was seen arriving within the formation. She prostrated herself and said respectfully, "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing helped her up and said in a low voice, "You have worked hard these many years... You have been with the family since our humble beginnings and have always been diligent. It's just that we had nothing good in the early days, and you were held back in terms of cultivation methods. I obtained a Purple Mansion Realm spirit pill from the Eastern Sea that can purify one's Dao foundation... It is perfectly suited for you."

Hearing it was a Purple Mansion Realm spirit pill, Li Minggong was first shocked and overjoyed. But she quickly frowned, bowed again, and said softly, "I am deeply grateful for the Daoist Master's consideration... But my aptitude is dull. The path beyond this Foundation Establishment Realm is a dead end for me... I am also old. Even with a perfected Dao foundation, it would just be a waste..."

"I only hope the Daoist Master will bestow it upon Jiangqian or Que'wan... Only then would its potential be fully used."

Li Ximing shook his head and replied, "Their contributions do not match yours, so it is not appropriate for them to receive such a great pill. That is the first reason. The second is... the cultivation methods they practice are of a very high grade. If not for my being at the Purple Mansion Realm, we would not be considered an Immortal Clan and wouldn't dare reveal such things. This spirit pill's effects are extremely limited; the improvement would not be significant for them. It is, however, perfectly suited for your immortal foundation."

Li Jiangqian had already presented the jade box. Li Ximing took out another freshly copied jade slip, placed it in her hand, and instructed, "Follow the cultivation art within this jade slip to achieve the best effect. All the spiritual resources have also been prepared. As for the treasure medicines for your True Fire, the family has not only prepared them but also procured an extra one, just in case. Go and use them."

Li Minggong could only accept it with thanks, her eyes brimming with tears as she replied, "It is a pity... my brother... he would have been the most suitable one."

Li Ximing waved his hand in silence, patted Li Minggong’s shoulder, and nodded to Li Jiangqian. He then transformed into a streak of Profound Light and departed. He flickered briefly over the island, paused, and then veered towards the roof of a mansion.

The Li family's direct line had seen their quality of life improve dramatically after moving to the Island. Li Chengzhi had lived in this mansion for the latter half of his life, earning more respect as he aged. Even with all the hurried construction across the island, this residence had been one of the first completed.

Large red lanterns hung before the gates, glowing faintly. Li Ximing gathered his sleeves and then reached out to knock.

*Creeaak...*

The door opened quickly, revealing an old man holding a lantern. He had no cultivation. He peered out, his gaze somewhat vacant, and stammered, "You... you are... the Daoist Master..."

Li Ximing did not answer, but the faint pulse of Profound Light from his brow said everything. Even if the servants had never seen him face-to-face, who on the lake didn't know of his prestige, riding the heavenly glows and commanding the Profound Light?

*Clang!*

The lantern immediately smashed onto the ground, rolling several times. Pale yellow oil and flickering flames spread quickly. The steward cried out, dropped to his knees, and began to kowtow desperately, his old hands braced on the ground.

The mansion's tranquility was shattered. A woman with elegant eyes and slender brows, dressed in a crimson, white-flowered skirt, hurried down the steps. "Uncle Dou?" she called out, puzzled. "What is happening?"

Li Ximing said softly, "Shouyu."

The voice sent a chill straight up Xia Shouyu's spine. Even after all these years since returning from overseas, Xia Shouyu still felt a mixture of terror and reverence for this voice, which had altered her destiny with a single word.

'Daoist Master!'

She rushed forward to greet him, but the Daoist Master in white-gold robes passed through the front courtyard like a beam of light, appearing directly before her.

"Take me to see Chengzhi."

She immediately lowered her head, bowing submissively, and led the Daoist Master forward. They had just passed through the central hall and were heading toward a room when they saw it was brightly lit. The faint sound of sighing could be heard, and a young man in red robes was kneeling silently on the floor.

Li Ximing gently waved his hand, stopping Xia Shouyu beside him. He gazed up at the portrait of the Daoist Master hanging high in the central hall, standing silently nearby, just as he had on that late night so many years ago.

Li Chengzhi was already very weak. A mortal's lifespan was merely sixty or seventy years; only those who reached Embyronic Breathing lived to one hundred and twenty. They had invited Sun Bai to see him, and with the help of a few cultivators, his condition was currently stable.

"The Daoist Master... The Daoist Master soars high in the heavens. What is it you are begging for? The Old Master has spoken to me several times... You must cultivate diligently. Reach the Foundation Establishment Realm first... That is more effective than any words. You are the direct grandson of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator... If you achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm, you will immediately be among the highest echelon..."

Li Chengzhi coughed twice. Li Zhouming’s voice, however, was firm, lacking the grievance it held back on Mount Qingdu.

"The Old Master thinks only of my well-being, but I know my own limitations. My hopes of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm are slim. If the Old Master hadn't constantly given me resources, I would be stagnating in the late stages of Qi Refining like my eldest brother... And Father only has so much time left. If I go into secluded cultivation again, I won't even be able to see him in his final moments. I might even force Father to see me off. There is no reason for 'Ming'er' to go into seclusion..."

"You... You just don't have the temperament for cultivation..."

Li Ximing lowered his gaze and finally pushed the door open. The room was thrown into chaos. Li Zhouming was first terrified, then overjoyed. The old man on the sickbed struggled to sit up and pay respects.

Li Ximing gently flicked his sleeve, sending both Li Zhouming and Xia Shouyu out of the room. He sat down in a nearby seat and seemed to let out a breath, looking at Li Chengzhi on the bed. His eldest son stared at him blankly.

"Father."

Li Ximing sat properly to the side. The two remained silent for a long time before the Daoist Master spoke in a low voice, "A long time ago... I used to think that if I had a son, it would be best if he was skilled in artifact refining. If not artifact refining, then the path of formations would also be fine... These are very important for the family."

"Later, you were born a mortal. I could only wish you a life of peace."

Li Chengzhi was very surprised by his arrival, so surprised he had nothing to say. He stared blankly at the Profound Light on his father's brow. After a long while, he finally said, "Thank you, Daoist Master."

"With a child like Zhouming, your son can die without regret."

The light in the room flickered. Father and son, brought together by the grandson's wishful thinking, sat like strangers. There were no sobs, no sighs of emotion. The Daoist Master waited for a quarter of an hour, then pushed the door open and left.

The central hall was pitch-black and gloomy. The opening of the door faced the portrait in the hall directly. Li Zhouming was kneeling in front of the room, this profligate's forehead pressed to the ground, waiting in silence.

Li Ximing stood quietly on the steps. His gaze, however, passed over the couple and settled on the hall's interior. The portrait of the Daoist Master was stirring faintly in the breeze. The small point of Profound Light, painted with gold lacquer, seemed to glow dimly in the darkness.

The Daoist Master in the painting was high above, his eyes indifferent, as if he had never changed. It suddenly struck Daoist Master Zhaojing with a sense of familiarity—a familiarity that silenced him.

An unknown amount of time passed. Li Zhouming waited and waited. Finally, his peripheral vision caught the corner of a white robe sweeping past him, and a command drifted to his ears:

"Go and cultivate in peace."

Li Zhouming raised his head. The Daoist Master had already departed as a streak of light. The profligate kowtowed three more times before scrambling to his feet and rushing inside. He looked toward the bed; his father was lying with his head tilted to the side, seemingly asleep.

Outside, the sound of rapid footsteps and the clash of weapons erupted, a noisy clamor. A voice shouted, "By order of the Family Head! The great formation is being adjusted today. The four direct lines, major and minor branches alike, are all to remain in their courtyards! No one is to take half a step outside!"

...

The Great River.

Night had fallen. The river surged, exceptionally beautiful under the clear moonlight. The air was slightly cold. From Jiangbei, several streaks of light flew over, landing one by one on the riverbank.

The leader was an imposing figure, dressed in white and red armor with a pale red cape billowing behind him. A sword hung at his waist, giving him an air of dominance and charisma.

This person was, naturally, Lin Feng.

But unlike the time of the great battle on the riverbank, his equipment was completely new. His cape shimmered with light. He had clearly reaped another great harvest and upgraded his gear. His original dharma sword was gone, replaced by the one at his waist—a long, elegant blade that glowed a brilliant, fiery red.

He was flanked by a woman on each side. A step behind them stood two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators as escorts: one, an old man in gray robes, the other, a young man in black robes. Neither appeared to have a high cultivation.

"This is far enough."

The man gave the order. The white-robed woman beside him looked aggrieved and whispered, "What kind of stunning beauty is she, that you must personally cross the river to receive her..."

This woman was none other than Song Yunbai of the Capital immortals Dao. Despite being a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, she only dared to complain tactfully to this man. Who would have thought that a charming girl in a blue skirt would step out from the side and snap, "Brother Lin is going to pick up my sister! What does that have to do with you?! You're nothing but a pretty mouth... you sure know how to use it!"

This charming girl was, of course, Fei Qingfei. She was merely a mortal, yet she dared to curse at a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. It was an extremely awkward situation. Song Yunbai could only lower her head in grievance, playing the part of the submissive.

"Alright, alright."

Lin Feng waved his hand. Song Yunbai departed reluctantly. Fei Qingfei was still complaining, muttering, "Honestly... one after another. We finally got rid of that Wang Xiaoxiao, and now there's this woman named Song. There are so many women in this world, and they all covet my family's man."

Lin Feng chuckled, paying little mind to her complaints. He gave an order, "Wu Gui, you have been to this Moongaze Immortal Clan before. You will lead the way... to the Fei family on the north shore."

"Yes!"

The four of them sped along, quickly reaching the Hanyun area. Wu Gui had only been to the island before and wasn't very familiar with the north shore. As they slowed down, an old man happened to be riding the wind nearby. Seeing the four of them, he called out joyfully, "Young master Feng!"

"Uncle Cai!"

The newcomer was none other than Fei Tongcai, the man who had escorted Fei Qingya back to the lake that day. He looked much more prosperous now, and his cultivation had improved considerably. He laughed, "I've been cultivating downstream, searching for a spirit material these past few days. I decided to travel upstream in my spare time. What a coincidence! Tsk... you've already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm! You're here to pick up Qingya, aren't you!"

Lin Feng nodded. Fei Qingfei leaned in affectionately. Fei Tongcai didn't even bother to announce them, leading the group straight up the peak. Fortunately, the patrolling cultivators had already been instructed and bribed, so they let them pass.

With Fei Tongcai leading the way, they soon landed on a peak. A commotion was coming from a courtyard where a woman with a cold, aloof temperament was standing. Across from her, another woman in Fei family robes was sneering, "My, how lofty we've become. How come your cultivation hasn't increased? People said you only got onto this peak through connections, but you refused to believe it. If the Family Head hadn't broken through, how could a minor figure from Jiangbei like you return to the peak to cultivate? Instead of being grateful, you claim your lover is here to take you away."

Someone nearby immediately tugged at her, whispering, "Stop talking..."

"Why can't I say it? She eats the family's food and uses the family's resources. We finally managed to support her to the Qi Refining realm, and now she says she's leaving for the north with her lover! She can do it, but I can't talk about it?"

Fei Qingya said in a low voice, "When I get to the north, I will naturally repay every one of these things. It's none of your business."

"None of my business? This..."

Lin Feng could listen no longer. With a cold laugh, he kicked the gate open. A torrent of flames surged out, instantly suppressing all other sounds. He roared, "Slut!"

"Brother Lin!"

Fei Qingya’s eyes lit up, and she rushed into his arms. Lin Feng wrapped an arm around her and said coldly, "The great Fei family... actually has a wretched woman like you!"

He thrust his palm out, and flames raged. Lin Feng was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator; how could a mere Qi Refining practioner withstand his attack? The woman instantly spat blood and collapsed. The courtyard erupted in cries of alarm. Wu Gui broke out in a cold sweat and looked at the black-robed Daoist beside him.

'This is Moongaze Lake!'

The Fei family might be insignificant, but the Li family was behind them! You have to see who the master is before you beat the dog. Moongaze Lake was not something the rabble from Jiangbei could compare to...

Fortunately, though Lin Feng was enraged, he retained some reason. The woman had collapsed to the ground, spitting blood and in great pain, but she was not dead. Fei Qingya was also stunned. The two guardians hadn't even had time to help before a loud announcement cut through the air:

"Protector Chen has arrived~"

'This is bad. We've been caught in the act!'

Wu Gui's heart pounded, but he saw that Lin Feng had actually calmed down. He looked at the black-robed young man descending from the sky and smiled.

"Protector Chen, long time no see!"

Chen Yang laughed as he landed, his expression one of pleased surprise. "Excellent! My friend, you really reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

As his feet touched the ground, he finally noticed the woman on the floor. "This is..."

Wu Gui quickly stepped forward and sighed. "My master just arrived and happened to overhear her hurling insults. He is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, after all, and couldn't tolerate such disrespect. He merely acted to discipline her a little..."

Chen Yang shook his head. He helped the unconscious woman up, using his dharma power to protect her heart meridian, preventing the smoldering Blazing Fire from slowly extinguishing her life force. He sighed, "How could ordinary people recognize a piece of unpolished jade like Qingya! Arguments are common, but she shouldn't have directed her words at you."

Lin Feng nodded slightly, glanced at Fei Qingya, and frowned. "This... the cultivation method Qingya is practicing is..."

Clearly, in Lin Feng's eyes, the "River and Stream One Qi Art" was worse than trash; it was an eyesore. Chen Yang, however, just laughed and replied, "This is a cultivation method from my family, one I specifically sought out for Qingya. It shares the same origin as my own Foundation Establishment Realm method... If the opportunity arises, she might be able to use my method... With Qingya's talent, I fear she won't stop at the Foundation Establishment Realm..."

"Oh?"

Lin Feng glanced at Chen Yang, a faint red light flashing in his eyes. He was clearly using some kind of ocular art. He nodded thoughtfully, a hint of pleasant surprise in his voice. "If it can connect to your esteemed family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method, it would save me the trouble of searching everywhere... I could just trade your family for a copy."

Chen Yang, however, let out a long sigh and shook his head. "If we had it, that would be for the best... It's just that the method to unlock my family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivation art was lost many years ago... It is said that only a cultivator of sufficient genius, profound, fortunate destiny, and who meets the criteria of the ancestors can open it. Because of this, it has remained untouched in our hands for all these years. It is very difficult to take it out for Qingya right now..."

"I see."

Lin Feng laughed heartily and raised an eyebrow. "Then let's forget it... I won't trouble your family for the cultivation method. I have my own means."

Fei Qingya, however, shot a quick glance at Chen Yang. Her arm, held in the man's hand, tightened slightly. She said tactfully, "Since we're already here... why not bring that cultivation method out for a look? If we can unlock it, not only will it save trouble later... it would also be a fortunate event."

Lin Feng smiled, covering her hand with his own, and replied, "Since you've said so, we'll have to trouble Protector Chen to bring it out. It will be a bit of entertainment, if nothing else."

Chen Yang had thought the chance was lost. He hadn't expected that a lover's whisper was indeed the most powerful persuasion. His help toward Fei Qingya during this time had truly paid off, prompting her to speak up at this critical moment. He hurriedly sent someone to retrieve the item.

Lin Feng turned his head and said gently to Fei Qingya, "You have suffered these past few years. From now on, you'll be with me. You will lack neither cultivation resources nor dharma artifacts. If you have any request, I will go to Secret Diffusion and get it for you."

Beside them, Fei Qingfei said indignantly, "Yes... yes, sister! I can't cultivate, so I can't get any of those things from Secret Diffusion. It all just benefits those other women. You should take one or two extra items, so it's not all a freebie for them!"

As soon as these words were spoken, Fei Qingya understood immediately. She asked suspiciously, "Them?"

Fei Qingfei, overflowing with jealousy, continued, "Who else? That Song Yunbai from the Song family, and that Wang Xiaoxiao from the ridge... they're both involved with Brother Lin right now..."

Fei Qingya's expression immediately darkened. She turned her head away, sullen. Chen Yang couldn't care less about their drama; he was just waiting for the jade slip. When it arrived, he had it presented. Lin Feng, feeling extremely awkward, seized the opportunity to change the subject. He nodded and said, "Xiao Yuan, you cultivate the water virtue. Your talent is not weak, and your fortunate destiny is not shallow. It's a perfect time for you to examine this item."

The black-robed young man at his side appeared taciturn, with a rather cold and aloof aura. He nodded, stepped forward, and took the jade slip. After studying it for a moment, he replied, "It truly is flawless, like an inert object... It's just... the aura on Qingya and Senior Chen... I seem to have encountered it in the east. I believe Su Yan, from the Capital immortals Dao territory, also cultivates this path... It's called the 'Jing Dragon King'..."

Chen Yang nodded repeatedly. "Precisely."

Before Xiao Yuan could speak again, Lin Feng replied thoughtfully, "He threw the Capital immortals Dao into chaos; he can be considered a top-tier figure. If your predecessor's cultivation method truly does choose its successor, perhaps we should let him try. The only problem is that he's hard to find."

He quickly shook his head with a smile and continued, "Setting that aside, I must thank Senior Chen Yang for taking such good care of Qingya all these years. Otherwise, who knows how much she would have suffered in a place like the Fei family."

Lin Feng stylishly retrieved a long box from his storage bag. He opened it gently, revealing a pure black Foundation Establishment Realm dharma sword lying within.

The sword appeared simple, entirely pitch-black with no ornamentation. Its form was a single straight line. Though shockingly simple from hilt to tip, it possessed an extreme spirituality. It was clearly no ordinary item.

The moment the box was opened, a plume of sword qi shot skyward. Its quality was definitely not low among Foundation Establishment Realm items. It possessed a degree of spirituality, and most precious of all, it was wreathed in an aura of 'Pit Water'. It had clearly been chosen with great care.

"This is a fine sword I acquired. I obtained four of them at the time: 'Black Creek', 'Falling Cassia', 'Sea-Parting', and 'Heart-Piercing'. They correspond to 'Pit Water', 'Supreme Yin', 'Converging Water', and 'Li Fire', respectively. All of them came from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition!"

He seemed casual, as if these items weren't particularly valuable to him. He gestured to the red dharma sword at his own waist and smiled. "'Heart-Piercing' is the one I wear, though I plan to give it to Yunbai. 'Falling Cassia' I gave to Senior Bai Yinzi, and 'Sea-Parting' went to fellow Daoist Han Li. 'Black Creek' I specifically saved for you, Senior!"

Dharma swords were sought after by everyone, to say nothing of a spiritual treasure like 'Black Creek', which no ordinary dharma sword could compare to! Yet from his mouth, they sounded as common as cabbages by the roadside, one after another. The Li family had many sword cultivators over the generations, accumulating their collection bit by bit, yet their entire arsenal was less than what he had just listed in a single breath!

Setting aside all else, Chen Yang himself practiced the sword. Moreover, this blade was a perfect match for his immortal foundation. Faced with such a temptation, he couldn't tear his eyes away.

Fei Qingfei, however, spoiled the mood by muttering, "All the swords from that Daoist tradition look the same. There's nothing special about them..."

Fortunately, Chen Yang was desperately restraining himself, otherwise he would have started cursing in his heart. He stared at the sword, mesmerized, and sighed, "This item is far too precious. How could I let you go to such an expense... I cannot accept it."

Lin Feng laughed and shook his head, but Fei Qingfei said proudly, "This is hardly precious at all! Brother Lin has a Geng Metal sword-shaped spirit embryo that has gained spirituality. *That* is truly precious! Right now, he even has to use a special dharma artifact to seal it, to prevent it from being exposed to the Great Void and seen by some Purple Mansion Realm cultivator... or from being drawn away by some Metallic Essence and escaping..."

"Aside from that spirit embryo, everything else is mediocre... Perhaps it's good to you, Senior, but to Brother Lin... it's already obsolete!"

Fei Qingfei was a mortal and had no contact with cultivation. Her words were clearly tactless. Although spoken with pride, they still made Fei Qingya frown in discomfort. She thought to herself, 'My sister has truly been spoiled rotten by him... She blurts out everything...'

Lin Feng, however, didn't mind. He stood with his hands behind his back, looked at Fei Qingya, and comforted her in a low voice, "Don't worry... I have the true Profound Order. They won't bully a junior to seize this spirit embryo from me."

"A spirit embryo?!"

Chen Yang's face was filled with shock. Lin Feng just smiled and said modestly, "It was just good luck... Secret Diffusion is not a Daoist tradition famous for the way of the sword. Although Xiaoshi Mountain was very famous back in the day, its main assets all came from the Wanling Upper Sect. I searched the entire Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition and only found this single sword-shaped spirit embryo. There were no other, more powerful spirit swords."

"Just this one..."



# Chapter 875: Preparations

Since Lin Feng had offered it, Chen Yang didn't dare refuse. He let out a long sigh and said, "A treasure like this... it's worth more than all the wealth I've amassed in my entire life. All I did was lend you a small hand that day, and now I receive such a reward... Truly, heroes rise from the younger generation. I am utterly convinced!"

Fei Qingfei clearly enjoyed the flattery, nodding in satisfaction. Lin Feng, however, waved his hand, clearly intending to leave. "I have many affairs to deal with and cannot linger," he said casually. "Now that Qingya has been retrieved, we will return north. I must help her recover the cultivation progress she missed over the years. We won't impose any further."

"As for Uncle Tongcai and Uncle Tonglu, you should come with us for a visit. After all, Fei Qingfei hasn't seen you in years and misses you terribly!"

Lin Feng had befriended these two Fei family brothers back when he was only at the Embyronic Breathing Realm. Fei Tonglu was, after all, the Fei sisters' father, so Lin Feng naturally held him in high regard. Chen Yang was more than happy for them to leave. "Of course, of course," he said hurriedly. "Neither of you is particularly valued in the Fei family anyway. Go and have your reunion. I'll report it to the lakeside authorities and assign you two a nominal task to serve as a cover."

The Fei family's talent pool was dwindling. Fei Tongcai had once been a core figure, but after a trip north, the person inhabiting his body was no longer him. He had been relegated to the riverbank, fading from the family's sight. Because of this, both men were eager to go north and nodded repeatedly in agreement.

With Chen Yang smoothing the way, Lin Feng's group was satisfied. Even Fei Qingfei's incessant chatter finally ceased to be unpleasant. Prodded by Lin Feng, she cupped her hands in a respectful farewell. He mounted the wind and soared into the air, leading his entourage northward at extreme speed until they vanished over the horizon.

Chen Yang remained where he stood, cradling the long jade box.

Before he could even react, the scent of pine resin filled the air. A figure in white robes materialized on the peak. Ning Wan, cradling a sword, stepped silently into the courtyard. The sight terrified Chen Yang, who immediately dropped to his knees. "Greetings, Daoist Master!" he stammered.

The Fei family woman cowering in the corner, along with the other bewildered family members, all bowed deeply. Chen Yang hurriedly held up the long box. "Daoist Master, please inspect this!"

Ning Wan nodded faintly. She picked up the sword, Black Creek. She examined it meticulously from tip to pommel but found nothing amiss.

She sighed softly. "It is truly from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition. It has the distinct aura of the Wanling Upper Sect from the late ancient era..."

Only a few breaths passed before several streaks of light descended upon the peak. Li Jiangqian arrived, accompanied by the Fei family's own Fei Qing'yi. Both bowed deeply in greeting. "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Ning Wan exhaled, appearing much more relaxed. "Congratulations," she said. "This is a boon, not a curse. Has Zhaojing gone to the Southern Borderlands?"

Although Ning Wan was asking a question to which she likely already knew the answer, it was a necessary formality. Li Jiangqian replied, "Thanks to the Daoist Master's blessed protection, our Old Ancestor has already departed for the Southern Borderlands. Before he left, he gave explicit orders: all matters on the riverbank are to be handled according to the Daoist Master's decree!"

Ning Wan inclined her head. "Your family's Daoist Master may be absent, but Fei Qingya's future is now settled. I expect that with 'his' support, she will be bordering on the Foundation Establishment Realm by the time she returns. The Great Xiukui Monastery will come for her personally, so your esteemed family need not be troubled."

She continued softly, "I know that yours is a family of Sword Immortals. Of those people and their swords... some must be set aside for you."

Li Jiangqian simply nodded in acknowledgment.

Ning Wan sighed. "Heart-Piercing is with Song Yunbai. That 'Cheng Yun' fellow is somewhat interesting, so it would be improper to seize his Dharma Sword. Bai Yinzi is a lost cause; who knows how many days he has left? Falling Cassia should be easier to acquire. Sea-Parting is in Han Li's possession, but his movements are extremely secretive..."

She seemed to be pondering 'his' earlier words. "He has already scoured the entire Daoist tradition..." she murmured, lost in thought.

Hearing her mutter, Li Jiangqian was struck by the exact same doubt.

Years ago, when Daoist Master Changyun met Li Ximing, he had specifically mentioned this Daoist tradition! The surrounding Daoist Masters didn't covet Secret Diffusion for a few mere dharma artifacts; they knew the tradition definitely contained Ancient Spiritual Artifacts!

If the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition held Ancient Spiritual Artifacts, then Lin Feng's so-called trump card was far more than just that Geng-Metal spirit embryo. He had to possess one or more Spiritual Artifacts, or even Ancient Spiritual Artifacts.

Ning Wan's thoughts mirrored his, but from her higher vantage point, she could predict more of the future.

'With this interference on the northern stage, 'he' is the only one who can enter or leave the Secret Diffusion secret realm. He has surely plundered it clean. We can't expect it to just fall into our laps...'

'He has also stayed in Jiangbei long enough. Once he cultivates to the late Foundation Establishment Realm, he'll head north to seek his breakthrough, likely having to punch through a blockade of Buddhist cultivators to do it.'

'But when he leaves, he's bound to distribute treasures among his comrades and lovers. This isn't just about saving one person. The Ancient Spiritual Artifacts are a lost causehe'll certainly keep those. But if that Daoist tradition held enough Spiritual Artifacts, he will definitely leave one or two behind... That will trigger another battle! I fear even the overseas powers will get involved.'

Ning Wan was deeply concerned. She looked at the Li family members, her expression conflicted. "The Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition is a great prize," she said quietly. "Another conflict is inevitable. Choose what you desire ahead of time... lest you end up with nothing for all your efforts."

As she finished speaking, she seemed to sense somethingfighting had apparently broken out again in Jiangbei. With a gentle wave of her hand, she dissolved into flurries of wind and snow.

"Thank you for the reminder, Daoist Master!"

How could Li Jiangqian fail to grasp her meaning? Despite the Jiangbei group's current prominence, the moment Lin Feng left, every last one of them would be fish on the chopping block.

He waited until the last flurry of snow had dissipated before rising to his feet. His gaze remained fixed on the Black Creek.

The Dharma Sword was simple yet elegant. The guard was precisely the same width as the blade, a feature that instantly captivated him.

'It's so similar... just too similar...'

Maintaining a neutral expression, he picked up the pitch-black sword and examined it closely, as if admiring its unique craftsmanship. "So this is the Secret Diffusion style of sword-making..." he remarked.

The Azure Pond truly possessed only one Spiritual Sword that could be called a Purple Mansion Realm weapon: the Great Snow's Severing Edge. However, Jiangnan had many sword cultivators, and their Way of the Sword differed from other paths. The "Spiritual Swords" or "Immortal Swords" they spoke of often referred to any blade that had been tempered by a proven Sword Intent and had thus given birth to its own spirituality. Thus, the words "Purple Mansion" were often added to Great Snow's Severing Edge to emphasize its unique status.

This Black Creek before him had already developed spirituality, making it exceptionally valuable. As Chen Yang relayed the information he had, Li Jiangqian listened, slowly sinking into contemplation.

'Four Dharma Swords, scattered to different parties, plus one Geng-Metal spirit embryo in the Great Void... I wonder which one it is.'

Li Jiangqian still held the memory of that gray sword from years ago. He turned Black Creek over. The pommel was completely unadorned. A sliver of hope rose in him as he studied it.

'This sword is bound to be used in combat. If a major battle breaks out in Jiangbei, the spirit embryo might be revealed. Then I'll know.'

'Before that happens, I must quickly gather descriptions or images of the other Dharma Swords!'

Li Jiangqian glanced around and commanded, "Bring Qu Bushi up here!"

Fei Qing'yi, who had been listening intently, was now, after hearing Ning Wan's warning, utterly convinced of the excuses Li Jiangqian had fed him earlier. He hurried off at once to summon the man.

The old man soon landed, riding the wind. "Any news?" Li Jiangqian asked quietly.

Qu Bushi bowed. "Reporting to the Family Head: that Yaosa Chengmi was pushing its luck in Xuanmiao Temple's territory. Now, the Daoist Master from Xuanmiao Temple has also vanished. I hear their marketplace was breached, and many valuables were stolen."

It didn't sound like a major issue to Li Jiangqian. "The Daoist Master has already warned us that these individuals are all chosen prodigies," he said evenly. "You and Chen Yang coordinate. Track down information on them by name, and get portraits drawn of each."

"Yes!" Chen Yang bowed.

Only then did Li Jiangqian add, as if it were an afterthought, "And find out everything you can about their clothing and dharma artifacts."

...

The Grotto-heaven was shrouded in mist.

A pale white platform stretched to the horizon, dotted with gently swaying osmanthus trees. In the sky, the sun and moon shone simultaneously, their brilliance competing. Above them both, at the very zenith, the sky turned a translucent gray, revealing a glimpse of another world beyond.

That distant heaven was dim, populated by massive, shifting silhouettes that cast faint, complex layers of light down upon the pale world below.

Lu Jiangxian stood within his Grotto-heaven, gazing into the distant Great Void.

The splendor emanating from the Great Void above Jiangbei was clearly visible even from the northern bank. He was certain more than one True Monarch was observing. To be cautious, his true body hadn't even crossed the riverbank, remaining concealed on Moongaze Lake.

'Who knows what methods Great Ancestor Wei has,' Lu Jiangxian mused. 'But judging from the Metallic Essence within the Sun Seeker Ring, that man is likely deeply entangled with me. Not to mention... the current Li family also bears the name Li.'

The moment Lin Feng crossed Moongaze Lake, the Metallic Essence within his Immortal Mirror became agitated. It tried several times to burst free and fly to Lin Feng. If it were still in the Sun Seeker Ring, it would have undoubtedly broken free and returned to its original master.

Fortunately, the Immortal Mirror's hierarchical power was immense, and it firmly suppressed the Bright Yang Metallic Essence, keeping it stable.

And in the Great Void... Ning Wan was not the only observer.

He sighed, and a new scene manifested. Above Cold Cloud Peak on the northern bank, the Great Void was still. A cultivator was standing there.

The man wore practical robes of black and gray, with a white-edged straight collar and a large right-side flap. He wore a Daoist crown and had a small gourd tied at his waist. His long beard was jet black. He stood utterly silent in the Great Void, shrouded by some profound concealment technique that left Ning Wan completely unaware of his presence.

The man had a long face with slightly high cheekbones, but this was offset by a pair of sharp phoenix eyes that gave him a dignified, righteous appearance. His eyes seemed to contain light as he gazed quietly at Moongaze Lake from within the Great Void.

Although his cultivation was masked by profound techniques, it couldn't escape Lu Jiangxian's divine sense. The man had reached the very peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, having perfected five great Divine Abilities!

Behind this Great Daoist Master, six sharp, three-foot-long flying swords stood vertically like a screen, their pommels aligned. A faint, colorful radiance pulsed from them, containing a terrifying, suppressed power.

'Mount Luoxia!'

A Great Daoist Master of this caliberone who could be considered peerless in all of Jiangnanwas here merely to supervise matters across the river on behalf of a True Monarch.

He paid no attention to the Li family members, nor did he spare Ning Wan a second glance. He didn't even seem to notice Lin Feng. This cultivator from Mount Luoxia was supremely confident, his gaze locked entirely on Moongaze Lake.

With his hands clasped behind him, his expression was melancholic. His gaze drifted over the cultivators below, as if he were mourning the Moonlight Origin Mansion that had once ruled this land.

When his gaze returned, Fei Qingfei was chattering incessantly, bragging about her "Big Brother Lin." The Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia showed no disdain, no arrogance; he simply watched with placid calm.

Only when Lin Feng returned to Jiangbei, re-entering the "game," did the man turn to leave without a trace of reluctance. He dissipated into a haze of colorful light, clearly having been eager to depart.

From start to finish, this Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia had never once shown the slightest regard for the Daoist traditions of Jiangnan.

'Mount Luoxia...'

From that single glimpse, Lu Jiangxian perceived the chasm between them.

'Those six blades behind him are not swords for the Way of the Sword; they are 'focus' swords for casting techniques. But all six are Ancient Spiritual Artifactswhat cultivators in Jiangnan commonly call Spiritual Treasures.'

'A True Monarch doesn't even need to intervene. As long as that man is in Jiangbei, unless someone uses a Golden Core-level trump card, the entire Supreme Yang Dao could be wiped out, and they still wouldn't be able to lay a finger on Lin Feng.'

'This... this is the real power of Wu Light's Mount Luoxia!'

Knowing full well the enemy's terrifying power, Lu Jiangxian had been biding his time, waiting for the True Monarchs to depart. Several of them were looming in the Great Void right over Jiangbei, perilously close to the lake. Although his Grotto-heaven was safely hidden within the Immortal Mirror, he couldn't predict what sort of reaction it might provoke if a Li family cultivator suddenly vanished into it.

But right now, the Immortal Mirror fragment was even more important!

He had already inspected Lin Feng. A long sword was hidden on his person. It was slightly longer than Black Creek and also possessed a long, slender hilt. The blade was sealed by layer upon layer of a black, cloth-like dharma artifact, and it was locked deep within his Sea of Qi.

'A Geng-Metal, sword-shaped spirit embryo...'

There were five swords in play. Four were Foundation Establishment-level Dharma Swords that had been given away. The fifth was the spirit embryo. If Lin Feng was telling the truththat he had scoured the entire Secret Diffusion Daoist traditionthen the fragment was almost certainly in one of those five blades.

The Geng-Metal spirit embryo was sealed, submerged in the Sea of Qi, and shrouded in that black cloth, making its aura completely indiscernible. Lu Jiangxian, wary of triggering an unforeseen reaction, did not dare to probe too deeply into the Sea of Qi.

Furthermore, the glimpses that Lu Jiangxian and the other Li family members saw through their unique connection were only visualthey carried no aura. But they did provide one crucial piece of information: the blade's proportions.

'Even wrapped in cloth, the fundamental shape of the sword won't change much. Based on its length, this is probably not the fragment I saw all those years ago.'

'Therefore, ruling this one out, the fragment must be in one of the remaining Foundation Establishment-level Dharma Swords.'

This discovery brought a small measure of relief to Lu Jiangxian.

The Immortal Mirror fragments were not useless; each had a purpose, but their nature was deeply concealed. Ordinary cultivators, even those at the Golden Core realm, couldn't discern a fragment's function. Their divine sense would sweep right over it, registering it as a mundane object.

This opened up many possibilities.

'Lin Feng never specified the total number of Secret Diffusion Dharma Swords, only that he'd acquired four. It's possible the fragment is an accessory hanging from the hilt of one of those four. It's also possible... that particular Dharma Sword was never removed and is still inside the Secret Diffusion secret realm!'

'This counts as good news. A Dharma Sword is inherently less valuable. No matter how difficult it is to obtain, it can't possibly be more difficult than prying that spirit embryo from a True Monarch's Sea of Qi!'

Lu Jiangxian's mind eased considerably.

'Let Li Jiangqian investigate first. The moment those True Monarchs leave and the board in Jiangbei is clear, Li Ximing will depart!'



# Chapter 876: The Treasure Elephant

Southern Borderlands.

In the past, the Azure Pond Sect was attacked by the Great Konghai Temple, costing them the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang and, consequently, North Dan Island. They had since retreated to the coastal prefecture of Hezhou, only a few dozen miles from Beidan.

This location was in the Southern Borderlands; it faced North Dan Island to the north, while its back was to Hengzhu and the Azure Pond's main territory. Because it was established as a temporary line of retreat, its defensive forces were not strong; they were, in fact, quite weak.

After all, Hezhou was not a strategic pass. Further north, past Hezhou, Yi Mountain City stood as the true first line of defense for the Southern Borderlands. Seizing Hezhou would be useless to the Great Konghai Temple, and might even provoke Hengzhu into action.

Both sides understood this. The Azure Pond Sect would not normally have needed to guard this location, but the western edge of the Shitang territory hugged the Southern Borderlands' coastline, stretching far inland. Along this narrow strip of land lay the Shahuan Kingdom, which called itself the "South of the Southlands."

The local Daoist Master Zhusheng was an ally of the Azure Pond Sect and a close friend of the Si family. With the fall of Shitang, his kingdom was left completely exposed to the claws of the Great Konghai Temple. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, fearing a domino effect, felt it was critical to have someone watching over the Southern Borderlands.

Li Ximing arrived from the north, riding his Profound Light. Following close behind was Yan Hu, clad in black robes and holding a spear. They landed, and a quick glance revealed that the cultivator guarding Hezhou was an acquaintance: an Eastern Yue cultivator named Fei Luoya.

When this old Eastern Yue saw the Daoist Master, he immediately hurried over and bowed deeply.

"Fei Luoya pays his respects, Daoist Master! Congratulations on the unification of the Lake, and congratulations to the Immortal Clan!"

This old fellow was indeed the same Fei Luoya who had been a disciple of Mount Wu all those years ago. He had actually managed to survive until today, and by the looks of it, had achieved a respectable status.

When Duanmu Kui died, his disciples scattered to the winds. Some immediately joined the Azure Pond Sect, but Fei Luoya laid low, choosing instead to befriend the Li clan. As expected, the Chi family had no real respect for those Mount Wu cultivators. After seizing their cultivation methods and spell arts, they used them all as cannon fodder.

Fei Luoya quickly realized the Lake was no place to linger. He scrambled for options and finally managed to get a position in Yi Mountain City. Later, when Chi-Ning took charge of the Azure Pond Sect, Fei Luoya, with his keen political instincts, managed to flourish and earn considerable merit.

Now, this Eastern Yue had finally made something of himself. He had several Azure Pond Sect disciples following him, all showing him great respect. Li Ximing watched, nodding and suppressing a laugh, as the old man spoke, his voice thick with emotion:
"Seeing you today, Daoist Master, is like gazing upon the bright sun in the heavens. It reminds me of my past association with Senior Tongya, who was like a towering mountain. The memory fills me with such melancholy..."

Li Ximing, however, had read the clan history and had even met this fellow in his youth. Back then, Fei Luoya had been far from polite; the Li clan ancestors had been forced to humor him and tread carefully. Now, after being tempered in the mortal world, his words had certainly become much smoother. He was clearly just trying to latch onto their prestige. Li Ximing simply waved his hand.
"It's good that you're here. I've come to the Southern Borderlands on behalf of Daoist Master Qiuhu to stand guard. I need to pay a visit to the Shahuan Kingdom. You can lead the way."

Li Ximing had not come all the way to the Southern Borderlands for nothing. Since he was here, he naturally had to make arrangements for Yan Hu and inquire about the Great Konghai Temple. But most important of all was the Bright Yang Spiritual Artifact held by Songzhou's King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou!

This was information he had obtained through the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's connections. He was already in the Southern Borderlands, and Songzhou was just across the Shitang Sea. To pay a visit and inquire about the Spiritual Artifact—that would make this journey truly worthwhile.

Fei Luoya quickly stepped onto the Profound Light. Li Ximing activated it, traversing the Great Void as they flew south. Below, he saw dense forests, sparse farmland, and long, narrow mountain ranges—a landscape quite different from that of Yue State. Li Ximing glanced down and asked:

"What people live here? They look like foreigners."

Fei Luoya replied with a sigh:
"The Shahuan people are also barbarians. In ancient times, they were called the Jiaozhi. They're probably even less orthodox than my Eastern Yue... It's only because a Daoist Master cultivates here that they've managed to become somewhat respectable."

Li Ximing nodded silently and finally asked the question that concerned him most:
"This Daoist Master Zhusheng... is he a Shahuan native?"

This was not a simple question. Although the north and south were fragmented and the Celestial Dynasty was no more, the dividing line between the civilized heartlands and the "barbarian" territories was still stark. Even an Eastern Yue who reached the Foundation Establishment Realm was considered inferior everywhere he went. If this Daoist Master Zhusheng was a Shahuan native, his culture and customs would likely make him difficult to deal with.

Fortunately, Fei Luoya shook his head quickly and lowered his voice. "This Daoist Master's surname is Liu. His family is quite famous. Years ago, when the Chu State unified Jiangnan, it declared itself the Southern Dynasty in opposition to the north. They sent an army to pacify the Jiaozhi, fighting all the way south to the Zhan State. They established the Annan Military Governorate, which comprised seven prefectures and fifty-six cities. The Military Governor at that time was surnamed Liu, and his name was Yi."

"This Governor was a Daoist Master who had achieved divine abilities. He fell when the Chu State collapsed. Daoist Master Zhusheng is his descendant, and his ancestral home is the Mushroom Forest Plains."

Li Ximing nodded, impressed. 'So he's the scion of a famous house,' he thought.

'His strength must be considerable. And he also has a Snow Ridge Listening Pine Fox... He cannot be underestimated.'

'But... his surname is Liu, and he was a Chu State Governor. The imperial surname of the Chu State was also Liu. When you really think about it, his background is likely far from humble. His family's situation might be quite similar to my own...'

'In its later years, the Chu State's government was chaotic, with right and wrong inverted to a terrifying degree. The throne was unstable, and in the end, the Xiao-Wu faction usurped it. The entire imperial clan was overthrown, their fate even more tragic than that of the Wei-Li clan. But karma was swift; the new Wu State eventually lost its eastern territories and was forced to retreat to the Shu region.'

They flew over the Shahuan people below and soon spotted an immortal mountain. A cultivator wearing the tall hat and wide robes of a scholar flew up on the wind to greet them, bowing respectfully. "Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing. My master has been awaiting your arrival. Please, descend and rest."

Li Ximing descended on his light.

Compared to Nine Mounds or Xiukui, Daoist Master Zhusheng's immortal mountain was a clear tier below. It looked rather ordinary, and it lacked the vast expanse of Moongaze Lake. As they descended, they saw a pavilion from which flames blazed, a sign of active artifact refinement.

A cultivator in Daoist robes was lounging lazily beneath the pavilion. He looked quite young and remarkably handsome. Meditation cushions were scattered around him in disarray. Only when he saw Li Ximing did this Daoist Master finally stand up, a smile on his face.

"Greetings, Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing's gaze swept the area. On a small table sat several wine jugs and a single longsword, lying flat. Everything looked quite ordinary.

'Early Purple Mansion Realm, with two divine abilities... What a free-spirited character.'

This Daoist Master Zhusheng cultivated the Dao of Jade True, making him a direct beneficiary of True Monarch Shangyuan's ascension. He had an ethereal, transcendent air, and though his robes were disheveled, it only made him seem more casual and natural.

"Please!"

The two sat at the table. Daoist Master Zhusheng poured wine and smiled. "You've come all this way south, Daoist Friend. I must thank you. This is, after all, aid from a thousand miles away."

Li Ximing offered a polite platitude. "It was nothing. I was simply amazed by your and your friend's profound transformation art. To deceive a Maha to his face... it truly broadened my horizons."

"Ah." The Daoist Master's voice was clear and bright. He turned his head and called out with a smile, "Go and invite Daoist Master Xian Chan, the King of East Ridge."

After giving the order, he turned back, his expression turning serious. "It is the nature of Jade True, after all. It's also known as the 'Jade True Six-Nine Void,' the Dao of Transformations between illusion and reality. Among the Three Shamans, its transformations are the most realistic, the most enduring, and the closest to the Immortal Dao. After the True Monarch achieved his Dao using jade, imitating the ancient immortals and pushing Jade True closer to the Immortal Dao, its transformations also became even more authentic."

He took a drink of wine. "Furthermore, Xian Chan cultivates Cold Qi, and Ning Wan had just broken through. Since no one had seen her new cultivation, it was easy to pull off the deception."

"As for why you've sought me out this time..."

Li Ximing connected the dots. Hearing this, he figured Ning Wan must have had her own arrangements in sending him here. Since the Buddhist cultivators had always been at odds with his family, he was more than happy to help if it was within his power. He smiled.

"It's about the Great Konghai Temple, isn't it?"

Zhusheng laughed heartily, his tone casual. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing is a perceptive man. The problem with the Great Konghai Temple... is mainly their Abbot. He's a formidable sixth-generation Maha, a major threat. Now, with Baoqing's success, the Shitang has fallen into their hands..."

He picked up the sword from the table and set it beside him, his voice quiet. "I am not one who enjoys being coerced. I will always choose to strike first."

As soon as Zhusheng finished speaking, a frigid wind howled. A youth in white robes descended from the sky as if stepping on the snow. He had a round face and long, narrow eyes. He took a seat at the table, brimming with excitement.

"Now we're all here!"

This must be Daoist Master Xian Chan, the Demon beast whose true form was a Snow Ridge Listening Pine Fox. Li Ximing gave him a slight bow. Daoist Master Zhusheng's expression turned serious again.

"Maha are skilled at divination. Although my divine abilities are shielding us, we must act decisively and without delay, just in case. Since Daoist Friend Zhaojing is here, I will be blunt."

"Very few factions are pleased with the Great Konghai Temple's recent actions, from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition to the various houses of the Southern Sea. They are simply wary of the Temple's Abbot."

"Daoist Friend Miao of Thunder-Hearing Island has spoken with me, as has Songzhou's King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou. The arrow is nocked; we have simply been waiting for you, Daoist Friend, to be our 'eastern wind.'"

Li Ximing was here representing Ning Wan, so he was expected to contribute. However, he had no desire to get dragged in too deep, and even less to get injured. After a moment's thought, he asked softly, "And your arrangement is...?"

Daoist Master Zhusheng and the Demon beast beside him exchanged a glance. "The Merciful Ones are too numerous," Zhusheng said. "We probably can't reclaim all of Shitang this time; it will likely be carved up by the various factions. However, severely wounding Baoqing is imperative. He operates under the assumption that Daoist Friend Miao and the Azure Pond Sect are at odds and will never ally. He believes that King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou is immobilized, just like the Great Konghai Temple's Abbot. What he *doesn't* know is that the Southern Songzhou Luoshe faction now has a second Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. And he certainly never expected *you* to be the one to arrive!"

"We don't need you to join the main fight. We just need you to travel east of Lufang, stand guard over the sea, and intimidate a certain white elephant. As for the rest, whether we succeed or fail, you won't need to make a move. When the time comes, just crush the jade talisman we give you, and you are free to leave."

Li Ximing stroked his beard and nodded, realization dawning. 'This group of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators has planned this well... It seems Kui Qi arranged all of this long ago. A man as proud as him was bound to be resentful about the Shitang incident. He's been plotting this in secret. Asking me to come was a specific move—it was just more important that I be *away* from Moongaze Lake when it happened.'

With the Immortal Mirror in his possession, he had no fear of ambushes or other dangers on the road. He was already tempted. 'Even though I'm acting on Ning Wan's behalf, and there's no immediate, tangible reward... the chance to strike a blow against the Buddhist cultivators is satisfying in itself. What's more, the Southern Songzhou Luoshe faction has that Spiritual Artifact. Contacting them after this operation will be perfectly natural and above suspicion.'

He nodded and smiled. "I will certainly do my part. However, I also came on this trip... to meet with the King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou. I intend to try and trade for that Spiritual Artifact."

To his surprise, Zhusheng nodded and smiled. "Daoist Master Qiuhu already mentioned this. The King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou is awaiting your visit. After the battle, the rest of us will likely need to retreat and heal our wounds. You can proceed directly to the Southern Songzhou Luoshe lands as you please."

Hearing this, Li Ximing nodded in satisfaction. Their interests were aligned, so there was no need for further ceremony. He accepted the jade slip and talisman from Zhusheng and was about to depart on his light when the Daoist Master called out, "Daoist Friend, please wait!"

He took a small box from his sleeve. Taking a wisp of Li Ximing's divine ability, he formed a hand seal and cast a Dharma Art, sealing the wisp's spiritual signature into the box. "This is a minor marvel from an Upper Shaman Dao Spiritual Artifact," he explained. "It can conceal your cultivation. It's not as effective as it once was, but it's more than enough to fool that stupid demon, who only possesses a spell-art-based divine ability. As long as you don't actively manifest your own abilities, the concealment will last for three days."

Li Ximing nodded in understanding and departed on the wind, leaving the man and the demon alone on the mountain. Zhusheng shouldered his sword. "It seems Zhaojing has powerful backing. Changxiao won't dare make a move on him."

The Snow Ridge Listening Pine Fox shook his head. "Hard to say. The Li clan is getting closer and closer to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Who's to say he hasn't already coordinated with Hengzhu? There could be a whole group of Daoist Masters lying in ambush in the Great Void, just waiting for Changxiao to show up!"

"That makes sense." The sword cultivator summoned a cloud and rose into the air. "That demon beast probably won't dare to fight. And even if he does, Zhaojing's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' is more than enough to tie him down. It's time. Signal the other houses to make their move!"

***

The Great Void.

Li Ximing left Shahuan and flew through the Great Void until he was over North Dan. He saw a brilliant, multicolored light protecting the island below. It was a traditional defense of the Buddhist cultivators—a sky full of dazzling, five-colored splendor. He had no idea how powerful it truly was.

The Great Konghai Temple's main headquarters surely had a grand formation, but given the Buddhist cultivators' general skill in the Dao of formations, it was highly unlikely they could have erected one on North Dan Island so quickly. This light had to be a projection from the Buddhist Land itself.

He frowned to himself. 'Impressive, in its own way. The Buddhist cultivators are skilled at using their Merciful Ones to form a conduit. Drawing down this power is an effective means of protection, and far less trouble than constructing a full Purple Mansion Realm grand formation. The only drawback is that when the casters disperse, the formation breaks...'

But that was not his problem. He took a detour, flying all the way to Lufang. Following the directions in the jade slip, he stopped at the edge of the Si Sea. Peering through the Great Void, he spotted a small island below. Demon beasts flew to and fro, and he could occasionally see a few monks moving about.

The island was protected by only a single Foundation Establishment Realm-level formation. He couldn't see the target demon elephant, nor was there any sign of a Purple Mansion Realm formation's aura in the Great Void. Clearly, this Demon beast was dirt poor.

He used his Immortal Mirror to scan his surroundings. Only after confirming there was no ambush in the Great Void did he relax. With a final glance below, he drifted down, emerging from the Great Void to manifest above the island. His appearance instantly caused a commotion. Li Ximing didn't stand on ceremony. With a single thought, he activated the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. The sky immediately filled with a vast, yellow-brown aura. Colorful clouds of spiritual energy appeared, only to be instantly dispersed by the surging, baleful qi.

The demon beasts below were terrified. The sea began to churn, and a thunderous roar echoed across the water. The surface exploded in a spray of white foam as a burly man in white armor strode out, walking upon the waves. His expression was wary. He started upon seeing Li Ximing, then frowned and shouted, "Which Daoist friend honors me with their presence?"

Li Ximing held the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, its white pearl glowing with a brilliant light. His gaze swept over the armored man, and he laughed. "Just an overseas rogue cultivator. I happened to be passing by and thought I would pay a visit to a fellow Daoist."

"A rogue cultivator?" The Demon beast was immediately suspicious. He looked Li Ximing up and down, but just as Zhusheng had predicted, he couldn't see through his cultivation. Still, Li Ximing had the bearing of a Daoist Master, so the beast maintained a civil facade. He waved his sleeve. "Then please, come ashore!"

This Demon King truly was dirt poor. Despite being at the Purple Mansion Realm, the sight of Li Ximing casually holding a Spiritual Artifact made his own presence diminish slightly. He led him onto the island and asked tentatively, "Daoist Friend... do you cultivate Earth Virtue?"

Li Ximing hadn't revealed his own divine abilities, only the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, so his aura naturally resembled that of Earth Virtue. While covertly using the jade talisman to signal the group to the west, he replied with an air of indifference, "You live in the Eastern Sea, Daoist Friend. I imagine Earth Virtue cultivators are not a common sight here."

The white elephant frowned, deep in thought. He led Li Ximing to the peak, quickly cleared some Buddhist scriptures off a table, poured him tea, and began in a low voice, "I wonder..."

Li Ximing cut him off. He shot the demon a glance, his posture radiating superiority, and launched a preemptive strike. "And just who, Daoist Friend, do you serve under?"

The white elephant was a Purple Mansion Realm Demon King, however; he wasn't so easily bluffed. His face darkened, and his eyes narrowed. "This Demon King cultivates in the sea. I am a good friend of the Abbot of the Great Konghai Temple. My name is Tuodu. And just who... are you?"

Since Earth Virtue had been mentioned, Li Ximing threw out a name casually. "Have you, by chance, heard of the Xu Xiang Daoist tradition?"

Demon King Tuodu stared at him intently, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Senior Sumian?"

Li Ximing hadn't expected to be connected to the Xuanmiao Temple so quickly. His family had no feud with them; if a fight broke out and his cover was blown, he would have offended Sumian for no reason. He laughed and shook his head. "Not at all."

Internally, however, he was puzzled. 'Sumian is famous and has many friends, unlike a new Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master like me. Even if this demon beast has never met him, he shouldn't be mistaking me for him...'

Hearing his denial, the white elephant's eyes flashed with renewed suspicion. But at that exact moment, a speck of colorful light flared in the distant sky. Demon King Tuodu startled and tensed, about to rise. Yet the man before him reacted even faster. He was already on his feet, hands clasped behind his back, staring at the demon with a cold gaze.

"Daoist Friend, I'd stay put if I were you."

At that instant, Demon King Tuodu finally understood. Li Ximing, however, gave no ground, his voice turning to ice. "I have no wish to harm you. If you remain here, you and I will have no quarrel. But if you insist on intervening, Demon King, you are more than welcome to try!"

The light from the west flared brightly. The Demon King's face twisted with shock and rage. He hesitated for only a second, then his mouth ripped wide, stretching to his ears. Two massive tusks shot out as his body swelled exponentially. "You dare to harm my friend, Daoist Baoqing!" he roared. "How dare you!"

His voice was a clap of thunder rolling through the clouds, causing every monk and demon beast on the island to look up, their faces filled with terror and righteous fury.

*BOOM!*

The sea surged as a colossal, white-skinned treasure elephant, as massive as a mountain, launched into the sky. Its forehead was draped with a golden blanket, and its two tusks gleamed like twin peaks of white jade. Its enormous mouth was blood-red, and it let out a deafening, earth-shaking roar.

A furious gale erupted, yet Li Ximing remained standing calmly by the table, the tea in his cup undisturbed. He shook his head and sighed, "How unwise, Daoist Friend."

Even as he spoke, a pair of elephant feet, so large they blotted out the sky, descended. A massive shadow instantly enveloped the entire peak as the two feet stomped straight down.

Faced with the mountain-sized limbs, Li Ximing's expression was odd. He didn't activate a divine ability, nor did he deploy the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen. Instead, he simply took a single, light step forward.

In that instant, he vanished into the Great Void.

The elephant's feet, however, did not stop, smashing heavily into the mountain peak. A violent cloud of dust and a terrifying explosion instantly engulfed the entire island. Demon beasts and monks rained from the sky, severed limbs scattering in all directions.

Li Ximing stood silently in the Great Void, utterly baffled. He didn't know what to say.

'I haven't even made a move... and he's already destroyed his own base.'

Tuodu, however, seemed unsatisfied. He stomped furiously several more times, his rage still burning as he roared to the heavens, "Where do you think you can run!"

After completely leveling his own island, the Demon King reverted to his human form, hefted a massive stone pillar, and stepped into the Great Void, leaving behind a land of wailing and ruin.

'Not good!' Li Ximing's heart lurched. 'He's going west to provide reinforcements!'

Li Ximing held back no longer. His Bright Yang divine ability flared as he moved to intercept. But the demon beast paid him no mind, instead diving straight down into the depths of the sea.

How could Li Ximing fail to understand? The light in his hands dimmed, his expression turning peculiar.

'This demon beast... he really doesn't want to fight, does he?'

But anyone who reached the Purple Mansion Realm was likely cunning. Li Ximing didn't dare let his guard down. He followed close behind, launching beams of Profound Light from his brow, forcing the demon beast to keep dodging, pushing him to fly faster and faster.

After about the time it takes an incense stick to burn, they had reached the deep-sea region of the Great Void, the territory of the Dragon-kin. Li Ximing grew wary. The demon beast, however, simply stopped, turned around, and called out, "This Daoist friend!"

Li Ximing wasn't here for a fight to the death. He smiled warmly. "Daoist Friend Tuodu, you have truly broadened my horizons today."

Demon King Tuodu waved his hands frantically. The murderous aura from before had vanished, replaced by the simple, earnest look of an elephant. He sighed. "Many thanks for your understanding, Daoist Friend..."

With a wave of his hand, he led Li Ximing out of the Great Void and back into the physical world. He materialized a table and chairs on a sea reef, looking utterly refreshed and cheerful. "So, it's Bright Yang you cultivate! You must be Daoist Friend Zhaojing, then? That's a fine Spiritual Artifact you have there; I couldn't see through your concealment at all!"

"My apologies, my apologies!"

Li Ximing opened his mouth, then closed it. Tuodu just waved his hand dismissively. "Baoqing had it coming. Let him suffer his bad luck. Even the Temple Abbot is ignoring this, so let him reap what he sows! By successfully tying up a Purple Mansion Realm-level opponent, I've already done more than enough for the Great Konghai Temple!"

He seemed like a completely different person from moments before, wearing a mask of simple honesty. Li Ximing remained noncommittal; he didn't believe a word of it. Since when was any Demon King of the sea a good person? He was clearly just posturing because he wanted to avoid a mutually destructive fight.

After all, the demon clearly misunderstood, thinking Li Ximing possessed at least two Spiritual Artifacts. He was also likely worried that the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was standing behind him. Otherwise, why would a local tyrant of a Demon King, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, be acting so subservient?

While the demon king sighed and lamented his situation, Li Ximing, happy for the quiet, sat down and remarked casually, "It seems you have no real intention of helping Baoqing. The Great Konghai Temple only has two Mahas, yet it seems to be rife with internal schemes."

"Hahaha!" Demon King Tuodu beamed, appearing completely amiable. "The Great Konghai Temple's Buddhist Land is nothing like that of the Northern Buddhists! The internal politics are a tangled mess. Neither you nor I are the main players in this battle. We're just here to put on a show. Why should we get in the way of one another's cultivation?"

Li Ximing watched him silently, saying nothing. Under the passive scan of his Immortal Mirror, a dark and heavy aura was circling the base of the reef. Clearly, another Purple Mansion Realm-level helper was hiding in the water below.

'This Tuodu is truly cunning,' Li Ximing thought. 'That "enraged" stomp earlier was just an excuse to kill those monks on his own island under the cover of a battle. He puts on the air of an irritable treasure elephant, but that viciousness... it's far from ordinary.'



# Chapter 877: Tian Sanglin

Li Ximing settled himself at the table. He could naturally tell this demon elephant was not simple. He waved his hand and said, "Most of the sea's demon beasts are under the command of the Dragon-kin, especially those at the Purple Mansion Realm. Yet, Daoist Friend, you seem entirely unrelated to the Dragon-kin. You are on good terms with Buddhist cultivators, yet you do not appear to cultivate their heart-methods. This is truly rare."

After all, Buddhist cultivators were known for their fondness for so-called 'spirit beasts'. Any demon beast they encountered, if it could be captured and taken to the Buddhist Land as a mount, would not be spared. The demon beasts, in turn, despised them for this; it was impossible for them to be on good terms.

This demon elephant was both a helper to the Buddhist cultivators and yet showed no sign of practicing their ways. When Li Ximing asked, he sighed.

"Naturally, it is because of my ancestors!"

Li Ximing remained noncommittal. 'Given this one's temperament, resources, and predicament, it's highly unlikely he's related to any great figure. He's just borrowing a name.' He feigned surprise.

"And who might that be?"

The demon beast glanced at him, hesitated, and then sighed.

"Since Daoist Friend has asked... it would be rude to refuse. My ancestors served under the Qi State. Later, we lived in the Great Desert. I broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm twenty years ago, left the north, and drifted here. The Qi State has been destroyed for who knows how many years; there is no backing to rely on. The Dragon-kin aren't willing to bother with me... but I was fortunate to find a place to cultivate."

"I practice in the Si Sea area, and I don't get along with Thunder-Hearing Island. On most days, I stay close to the Great Konghai Temple, but only for support."

Li Ximing found this strange.

The four northern dynasties were Wei, Qi, Liang, and Zhao. The Qi State was founded when the Jie clan invaded and replaced Wei, only to be slaughtered later by the Tuoba family. 'My own family is often called the Wei-Li. We certainly aren't on friendly terms. No wonder he was so tense.'

'It's a good thing he isn't a Buddhist cultivator, or he would be obsessed with this karma.' Whether the elephant's words were true or false, Li Ximing didn't much care. He nodded and said, "You reside overseas, so close to the Buddhist Land. Isn't that like striking a bargain with a tiger? Are you not afraid of losing your independence and being absorbed into the Buddhist Land?"

Tuodu noted his calm tone and the absence of any intent to attack. The tension in his heart eased slightly. "What choice is there? Fortunately, the one at the Great Konghai Temple cannot move easily. He sends monks every day, which is extremely annoying, but it's far better than being forced to flee for my life."

"After all... not everyone is as reasonable as you, Daoist Friend. The Tuoba family still remembers me. There are several others eager to 'enlighten' me, and even that Chunyi Dao Gate..."

He stopped abruptly, shaking his head. Li Ximing understood. He sized up the elephant and asked cautiously, "In that case... do you cultivate Radiant Essence?"

Radiant Essence could dispel Bright Yang. 'Luckily, this Daoist tradition is just as rare nowadays. I have never seen it. If he cultivates the Qi State's Radiant Essence, this could be troublesome.'

Tuodu shook his head repeatedly. "I have no such fortune... I cultivate whatever my ancestors did. At present, it is Baleful Qi."

Li Ximing felt a sense of relief and stroked his beard. "That is also rare."

'If this Tuodu cultivated Radiant Essence and then fell to the Buddhist Land, he would undoubtedly become a great enemy.' Seizing the opportunity, he asked, "What was the name of the Qi Emperor?"

"The Qi Great Ancestor, Qiji Tanluo, whose court name was Shi Chang."

Though clearly a descendant of the Qi State, the demon beast spoke of the founding emperor with marked casualness. He looked at Li Ximing with some confusion and said hesitantly, "Daoist Friend should be more familiar with this than I. Qiji Tanluo defeated the Wei Crown Prince, Li Xunquan, and granted the Hetao region to the Helian family, establishing the Tiefu Kingdom. After generations of rise and fall, it is still on the border of the Zhao State."

Li Ximing was in Jiangnan, and news from the north was almost completely cut off by the Buddhist cultivators. It was rare to meet someone from there, so he took the chance to sit down and ask, "What is the current situation in the north?"

At this topic, the demon beast's expression became animated. It was clearly not the first time he had explained this to someone. He sneered and replied, "What could it be? Ever since Fu Qiyan fell, the Zhao State has become a plaything. The Seven Dao are above it, the Four Kings control the regions, and the court is full of eunuchs cultivating Veiled Yin. It's nothing but an empty shell. Fu Qiyan thought he was invading to become an emperor; he never imagined his descendants would become puppets."

"The Liangqiang in the west are in total chaos. The Yan State in the east is just the Murong family. A little south of them is the Gao family's King Bolie, who has already unified the former Qi lands. You could call him the King of Qi and it wouldn't make a difference. Above them, you have the Tiefu Kingdom and the Tuoba family... officials, the court, nobles, and the Maha are all tangled together. It is far more chaotic than the south!"

The demon beast's expression finally held some sincerity as he let out a deep sigh. "This chaotic world... it's no place to make a name for yourself. Even after I reached the Purple Mansion Realm, all I can think about is fleeing further and further away. If you don't have a True Monarch at your back, a Golden Core ancestor above you, or a Daoist Master for a father, how can you dare to stand out in this mess?"

"And what's more... there is still a Mount Luoxia."

Li Ximing was stunned. He knew the situation in Zhao was suffocating, but he had not imagined it had reached this point. The white elephant, having tested him enough, felt Li Ximing bore him little malice and quickly added:

"Daoist Friend Li... I have heard of your reputation... They say your Alchemy Dao is unmatched. My Baleful Qi has formed a divine ability, but my core is flawed and malformed. I cannot even nourish a spirit embryo for a Spiritual Artifact..."

"Most cultivators on the mainland follow the Supreme Yang Dao... They all look down their noses at people. The few factions around here ignore me, and the Great Konghai Temple is full of Buddhist cultivators... I was hoping that if there is a chance in the future, I could trouble Daoist Friend to refine some pills for me..."

They were strangers who had met by chance. Li Ximing was extremely cautious, especially since Tuodu was aligned with the enemy, which could lead to many unnecessary misunderstandings. He frowned. "We will speak of this later. Daoist Friend, you should focus on your own situation. If you fall to the Buddhist Land, the next time we meet, we will be enemies."

The two sat at the bottom of the sea, talking for some time. The demon beast tactfully inquired about Spiritual Artifacts, spirit pills, and spirit formations, while Li Ximing subtly fished for information about the north. It was a tacit understanding. Finally, a jade pendant in Li Ximing's sleeve flashed. The situation to the west was resolved.

"Farewell!"

Li Ximing waved his sleeve, wasted no more words, and vanished into the Great Void. The demon beast also let out a deep sigh and returned to his island, a hint of schadenfreude on his face.

When Li Ximing emerged from the Great Void above the sea, he saw the western horizon flashing with magnificent light. The radiance of the Buddhist Land shimmered in a vast expanse of pink. Zhusheng and the others had succeeded.

'These cultivators from the Southern Sea and the Southern Borderlands are reliable... As expected, picking a side and putting on a show is much easier than fighting oneself.'

Feeling quite at peace, Li Ximing summoned his light and flew straight toward Songzhou.

The islands of Songzhou were many, varying in size, with archipelagos stretching on endlessly. The main body, however, was divided into three parts. Southern Songzhou Luoshe was at the far southeastern corner, directly south of his current position and very close. Li Ximing rode his light across the strait and arrived.

As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, he was already near the apex of worldly power. It was common for such experts to carve out a small Island for themselves and rule as a king. As he descended, he noted the land was covered in dark forests and low mountains. Large swathes of territory were sectioned off but devoid of people. Only when he reached the very center did he see densely packed black palaces.

'This faction does not look virtuous.' Li Ximing carefully guided his light downward. His gaze swept over the palace roofs built around the central hill, revealing heavy chains and a pervasive black qi.

It was said the Southern Songzhou King Luoshe had a mid-Purple Mansion Realm cultivation and practiced the Dao of Shamanic Arts and Talismans. He was naturally not to be trifled with. Li Ximing paused in the air and projected his voice with his divine ability:
"I am Li Ximing of Zhaojing, here to visit Southern Songzhou Luoshe. I humbly request the Great King to grant me an audience!"

A Purple Mansion Realm expert from Southern Songzhou Luoshe was supposed to have joined the fight against the Buddhist cultivators, which meant one should still be on the island. Regardless of which one it was, Li Ximing addressed him as 'Great King'. After a moment, a cultivator in black armor rose on the wind.

"Daoist Master, please come in!"

Li Ximing descended, passing through the heavy layers of black qi. Atop the mountain stood an enormous dharma throne, easily the size of a courtyard. A massive dharma body sat upon it, one hand holding a flower, the other forming a mudra. It was as tall as a mountain, with eyes as large as carriages, looking like a world-ending demon amidst the black qi. On its knees, palms, and fingertips, black-robed cultivators sat cross-legged, meditating in silence.

Li Ximing's Profound Light, though brilliant, seemed insignificant before this dharma body.

'What a powerful Purple Mansion Dharma Body...'

'He doesn't cultivate the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, so I can't count his divine abilities. But Daoist Master Lingmei mentioned his strength is at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm. I fear most of that power resides in this dharma body.'

'From this one glance, I suspect this dharma body is no weaker than that of any Maha.'

A black light coalesced before him, forming an old man in black robes with a white beard. He nodded. "Please!"

This was a body condensed from a divine ability. Li Ximing had a request, so he naturally nodded with a smile, adopting the attitude of a junior as he followed. Once inside the palace, the old sorcerer spoke. "This King was just using my dharma body to observe North Dan from the Great Void, in case a great war breaks out in the west. My apologies for the poor reception."

"Not at all!"

The place was gloomy. They passed through dark palace halls lined with high-backed jade thrones. Li Ximing took a seat as motioned. The old man spoke in a low, ethereal voice:

"This King's surname is Dilu Tian, and my common name is Sanglin. I was originally one of the Eastern Yue from Yue State. Traveling abroad proved inconvenient, so I took the 'Tian' from my name. You may simply call me Tian Sanglin."

"Your esteemed clan's reputation... I heard of it long ago. Jiao Zhongzi and Huo Luo'e both cultivate on my island. I knew of your Li family even back then."

Li Ximing was stunned. The names were extremely familiar, and then it hit him.

'When Duanmu Kui died, the Mount Wu group scattered. The strongest among them was Jiao Zhongzi. When the Li family campaigned west against the Eastern Yue, Jiao Zhongzi vanished, having gone off to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. By the time we had fought our way to the westernmost territory of the Eastern Yue, the only remaining Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Mount Wu, Huo Luo'e, had also fled and disappeared.'

'The Li family has encountered many factions and visited many places over the years, but we never heard any news of those two. We assumed they had fled to the Sea's Cape to live freely. I never expected them to be here at Southern Songzhou Luoshe.'

"You are also from my Yue State!"

After this thought, Li Ximing hesitated slightly and asked, "Senior Duanmu... was..."

Tian Sanglin said flatly, "I received a favor from Senior Duanmu. Although he cultivated the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, his mastery of shamanic arts could be called the greatest of all time. In my early years, I often visited him on the mountain. Jiao Zhongzi and Huo Luo'e are a bit younger; they didn't know someone like me existed."

"However... I had a junior, Dilu Tianfu, who cultivated on Mount Wu and was good friends with them. He told them of this escape route. So, when disaster struck Mount Wu, those two came to visit me, one after the other. Ironically, it was my own junior who perished on Mount Wu while attempting his breakthrough."

"So that's how it is!"

Li Ximing nodded inwardly, a realization dawning.

'Back then, Master also visited Mount Wu once, specifically to retrieve Dilu Tianfu's belongings. It probably wasn't out of any friendship with Xiao Chuting. Rather, this man couldn't go to Mount Wu himself and entrusted Daoist Master Xiao to retrieve the items for him!'

'That means the [Bone-Carving and Skin-Shedding] technique we obtained also came from Southern Songzhou Luoshe...'

But as soon as his doubts were resolved, a chill ran down his spine. He asked, "The cultivator from Southern Songzhou Luoshe who recently broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm... is it Jiao Zhongzi?"

A harsh, grating laugh came from the old sorcerer's throat. He looked up slightly and replied, "Correct!"

Li Ximing's heart sank.

'It's exactly what I was afraid of...'

'The Li family's relationship with the Eastern Yue was far from amicable. Seizing their territory means nothing to a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but Jiao Zhongzi had left a subordinate and a mount behind on Mount Wu. It's possible he had some attachment to them. This... this doesn't look good.'

Li Ximing's brow locked in a deep frown. But Tian Sanglin made a sound and said softly, "He has already severed his former karma. The affairs of Mount Wu no longer have anything to do with Jiao Zhongzi. He cannot accept that karma, and he does not dare to."

Li Ximing understood. The only thing a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would not dare to touch... it had to be that immortal book from back then. Duanmu Kui had received it directly from an immortal, so he could be reckless. But who after him would dare touch that thing? Who would dare touch the Daoist tradition of Mount Wu?

Li Ximing sighed. "Business is business. My family did offend him in the past. I will offer two spirit pills as compensation to show my sincerity."

As they were speaking, an old man walked up carrying a jade tray, bowing respectfully. "Your Majesty... the treasure has been brought from the palace!"

Li Ximing's heart leaped. He looked over. The jade tray was as large as a desk, colored a deep cyan-green. In its center rested a golden halberd.

The halberd had a long handle, about three chi in length. The two corners of the blade curved like a crescent moon. It did not look crude; on the contrary, it appeared exquisite and delicate. Qilin-beast patterns rippled across its surface, which glowed with a heavy, thick, bronze-gold color that faintly reflected a shimmering silver light.

'A Spiritual Artifact!'

'These overseas cultivators are far less formal than those in Jiangnan. On the mainland, we would have had to exchange pleasantries, I would state my purpose, and only then would he have brought it out. The Southern Songzhou King Luoshe was chatting casually while already having someone send it over!'

Li Ximing examined it closely. Apart from the beast-shaped Qilin carvings, the weapon was devoid of other patterns, save for two small, simple star charts etched on its flat faces. The lines were shallow, as if not to disrupt the heavy, powerful aura of the surface.

He was extremely familiar with this diagram. It was the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Chart. The two charts were inverses of each other, one on each side, indicating this Spiritual Artifact was meant to be hung and had a distinct front and back.

Li Ximing was deeply moved and asked, "Senior... may I ask the name of this Spiritual Artifact?"

Tian Sanglin leaned back on his throne, his voice ancient. "The Radiant Sun King's Halberd. It is an artifact of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. It shatters evil and corruption, punishes the disloyal, illuminates the rivers and mountains, and watches over the people. Its divine ability is the 'Crimson Rupture Cluster'. It can bear the weight of an empire and sweep away all calamities."



# Chapter 878: Radiant Sun King's Halberd

The old man holding the tray stepped forward, presenting the Radiant Sun King's Halberd to Li Ximing with both hands. Li Ximing took it gently. A scalding heat met his grasp, and the patterns across the weapon's surface pulsed, flickering between light and darkness.

Tian Sanglin inspected it closely before continuing:

"This item was suspended in the top pavilion of the Fubei Peak in the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. According to Ning Tiaoxiao, the grotto-heaven's master was named Li Guangfu. He was not wealthy or extravagant; he had fallen on hard times. When the various families stormed the grotto-heaven, the estate was almost completely empty."

"The master had packed everything away, leaving behind only the Radiant Sun King's Halberd—a symbol of power and glory. The Cui Family respected him deeply; it seems no one ever dared to take the Radiant Sun King's Halberd."

Li Ximing listened intently. Tian Sanglin dismissed the old man with a wave and said:

"The body of the halberd should be made from 'Sun-Extending Grace Copper', smelted with the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual materials 'Li-Light Origin Essence' and 'Celestial Shade Stone'. That is why it possesses the glow of Li Fire."

"When Ning Tiaoxiao retrieved this item back then, he considered that it was unsuitable for Ning Wan's Cold Qi. However, Bright Yang and Li Fire are aligned, which was perfect for helping me refine my dharma body..."

Li Ximing nodded slightly and asked:

"Senior, to be honest, I only recently reached the Purple Mansion Realm and have been without a suitable weapon. This time, I entrusted the Supreme Yang Dao to communicate with you about this item, hoping to arrange a trade."

After all, Li Ximing was here specifically to find a good Spiritual Artifact. If the other party was unwilling to trade, or saw no need for it, then no amount of words would matter.

Tian Sanglin heard this and nodded.

"Zhaojing, do not overthink it. Since Ning Wan asked me about this, and I agreed to let you see it, I naturally have my own intentions."

Li Ximing smiled and nodded, and the other man began to explain:

"Bright Yang is, after all, tyrannical and overbearing. And this is a king's halberd. After I finished refining my dharma body, I found it wasn't very compatible with my Dao of Shamanic Arts and Talismans. Its uses are rather unconventional, and it's a bit cumbersome in combat. It's already difficult to use against enemies, but you absolutely cannot let it miss. If an attack fails to connect, it will instead damage your own Divine Ability and dharma power."

When Li Ximing heard this, he understood that this Spiritual Artifact could coordinate with his own Divine Ability. When his Audience with the Celestial Gate suppressed an enemy, he could follow up with a strike from the halberd. He suspected that without a Body Divine Ability, it would be nearly impossible to dodge.

'As expected, one's own Divine Abilities and one's own Spiritual Artifacts have the best synergy...'

Li Ximing had seen so many Merciful Ones recently, and the worry in his heart grew heavier by the day. Seeing such a Spiritual Artifact now, it was impossible not to be moved. He stroked his beard and said:

"I wonder, what does Senior require?"

Tian Sanglin rose from his throne and clapped his hands.

"First, this king wants the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury!"

This declaration made Li Ximing fall silent, clearly hesitant.

The Nine-Colored Profound Mercury had been obtained from the siege that killed Wang Fu. A prestigious Purple Mansion Realm spiritual object had fallen into the Li family's hands. It was only because Hengzhu valued their reputation and upheld the righteous path that they had preserved it for the Li family. If it had been any other Daoist tradition, even if they didn't seize it outright, they would have likely forced a trade for it long ago.

Later, when Li Ximing reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the item was sent to Moongaze Lake. It had always been reserved for Li Que'wan to use for her Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough. He had never considered touching it...

But if it could be traded for a Bright Yang Spiritual Artifact, Li Ximing wouldn't hesitate for long. His priority was to increase his own strength and stabilize the situation before Li Zhouwei broke through. If any changes occurred in the upcoming matter of the True Monarch, a Spiritual Artifact would be far more useful than the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury collecting dust in the treasury.

'As for Que'Wan... she is still far from the Purple Mansion Realm. We can wait until Zhouwei comes out of seclusion and make new plans then.'

But Tian Sanglin wasn't finished. He turned his head and continued:

"Besides that item, I also want a spirit pill, the 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill'. It comes from the Great Ning Palace. It is not in your hands, but the Si Family has some, Gao has some, and even the Three Sects and Seven Gates have a portion..."

But even after saying this, he still didn't stop.

"And without this Spiritual Artifact, the foundation of my Southern Songzhou Luoshe will be weakened. I will need at least one spirit embryo to compensate. Naturally, this means you will trade one Upper Shaman spirit embryo to my Southern Songzhou Luoshe as part of the price."

Li Ximing had been hoping Tian Sanglin would ask for help suppressing a Maha. After all, he was already mortal enemies with the Buddhist cultivators; at worst, he'd get injured, but the Spiritual Artifact would be a concrete gain. Unfortunately, the Southern Songzhou Luoshe was already firmly rooted in Songzhou and had no mortal enemies, leaving no such opening to exploit.

Every condition was a major loss. He frowned, deeply dissatisfied. In short, not only did the Southern Songzhou Luoshe want to rake in both a spirit pill and a spiritual object, they *also* demanded a spirit embryo as compensation!

'This price is truly too high...'

He slowly sat up straight and said softly:

"Senior, the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury is already an exceptionally rare spiritual object in this world, especially in this age where the Whole Pill is elusive. Demanding that is one thing, but you also want the Supreme Yang Dao's 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill' and an Upper Shaman spirit embryo."

"If this junior had that much influence, I wouldn't have needed to come to the Southern Sea. I could have just sought out some friends and had a Spiritual Artifact refined myself. Wouldn't that be better!"

Li Ximing maintained a pleasant expression and smiled.

"If this item were Xiukui's Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, this junior wouldn't say another word. I would throw in the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger I have on hand without a moment's hesitation. ...But as Senior himself said, this Spiritual Artifact is quite cumbersome, not some extraordinarily profound object."

Tian Sanglin was old, his gaze sharp and venomous. He didn't budge an inch, shaking his head.

"That's not right. The Nine-Colored Profound Mercury is precious, but are 'Li-Light Origin Essence', 'Sun-Extending Grace Copper', and 'Celestial Shade Stone' any less so? The difference in value is merely being covered by one pill and one spirit embryo! It is already a very appropriate offer."

He laughed loudly and said:

"I don't know whether to call you lucky, fellow Daoist. Anyone else... would only know this item is cumbersome. Even if you got your hands on it, it probably wouldn't be much better, aside from having some novel effects when paired with your Divine Ability. ...But I have some worldly knowledge. I have actually seen another King's Halberd!"

"Precisely because it is a King's Halberd, in the hands of the strong, it can look down upon the world; in the hands of the weak, it is a source of disaster. Once this Spiritual Artifact falls into the hands of a cultivator whose Bright Yang Divine Ability has reached great completion, it reveals an entirely different bearing!"

Tian Sanglin truly did not look like a good person. He already had the appearance of a demonic fiend, and now his gaze was laden with deep meaning. His smile was even more sinister.

"Therefore, I know what I'm looking at. This item... is a truly fine thing in the eyes of your clan..."

His attitude was absolute and left no room for negotiation. In his heart, Li Ximing actually knew that while the demands stung, they weren't entirely excessive. Still, he sighed:

"I have some methods for refining a spirit embryo. Although I am not versed in the path of the Upper Shaman... I can still ask Xiukui for guidance. But this 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill'... spirit pills are so valuable. I will have to expend an unknown amount of resources and favors..."

Tian Sanglin said nothing, merely sipping his tea from the head seat. Li Ximing's eyelid twitched as he watched. He was just about to speak again when a gray wind swept in from outside the hall, coalescing into a young man at the entrance.

The man was tall and thin, dressed in black robes and black boots, looking every bit the part of a demonic cultivator. He had a red mark on his glabella, gray strips of cloth tied around each sleeve, a jade token at his waist, and a large bow strapped to his back. His face was slightly sallow, giving him the appearance of a hunter.

He entered the main hall and strode forward. Upon suddenly seeing Li Ximing, his pupils widened slightly, as if he recognized him instantly, revealing a trace of shock.

The demonic cultivator concealed his emotions in an instant. His eyes held a peculiar light as he first bowed to Tian Sanglin.

"Greetings, Great King!"

Tian Sanglin nodded. The young man quickly turned, his voice surprisingly gentle as he spoke.

"I am Jiao Zhongzi. Greetings, Daoist Friend Zhaojing."

Li Ximing saw him enter from outside the hall, head held high, chest out, and bow on his back. He was momentarily lost in thought and cleared his throat.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist..."

Li Ximing was slightly embarrassed and replied:

"Regarding past events... I apologize for any offense."

Jiao Zhongzi waved his hand dismissively and sat down to the side, smiling.

"I heard from the Miao Family that a cultivator had come to the Southern Songzhou Luoshe to trade for a Spiritual Artifact. So it was you, Daoist Friend Zhaojing. You must be here for the Radiant Sun King's Halberd!"

He was clearly a practitioner of shamanic arts and talismans, yet a flame flickered faintly on his glabella. Li Ximing noted this discreetly and said with a wry smile:

"Indeed. It's just that my lake is poor, and I'm afraid I cannot satisfy the Senior's demands."

"Oh?"

Jiao Zhongzi acknowledged this, glancing silently at Tian Sanglin at the head seat. They seemed to exchange a look, and Jiao Zhongzi smiled.

"It seems we must trouble you to refine a spirit embryo. This isn't my Great King trying to make things difficult for you. My Dao of Shamanic Arts and Talismans is not like the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. We don't have methods for refining spirit embryos. You could say we should just nourish one slowly, but we lack the corresponding Daoist tradition. Only you Purple Mansion Golden Core cultivators have cultivated the Upper Shaman path, so we can 'borrow' it for a bit..."

This Jiao Zhongzi was clearly much more eloquent than Tian Sanglin, and his attitude was surprisingly amicable. He smiled.

"My Great King has one for himself, but I have not had a spirit embryo since my breakthrough. So I was hoping you could help... Whether you need a specific type of dharma artifact or any materials, feel free to ask."

The implication had changed completely. Tian Sanglin had demanded he *provide* a spirit embryo, but from Jiao Zhongzi's mouth, it became *helping to refine* one. That was a far easier task. Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He glanced over; Tian Sanglin was still silent, seemingly giving his tacit approval.

Li Ximing was immediately tempted. He nodded, while remaining inwardly vigilant:

'Could this old one and this young one be playing good cop, bad cop, setting an exorbitant price only to negotiate down?'

But just as Jiao Zhongzi smiled, satisfied, and was about to say more, Tian Sanglin spoke up, his voice raspy.

"If you agree, fellow Daoist, the matter is settled. If not, then please return... There is no precedent for 'lending' a Spiritual Artifact."

Li Ximing stood and bowed.

"Thank you for your understanding, Senior. It's just that, first, the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury is back at the lake. Second, this junior is unfamiliar with the 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill'. I must ask a friend about it before I can agree."

Tian Sanglin frowned slightly, but Jiao Zhongzi stood up, smiling.

"That is only proper!"

He turned to Tian Sanglin and said respectfully:

"There is no need to trouble the Great King. Why don't I take the dharma artifact and the Spiritual Artifact and accompany Daoist Friend Zhaojing on his trip? If the deal is feasible, we can exchange the Spiritual Artifact on the spot and I will bring the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury back for you. With the Supreme Yang Dao as a witness, all subsequent matters will be easy to handle!"

Li Ximing understood immediately.

'This Southern Songzhou Luoshe King is actually very tempted by the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury...'

This proposal was exactly what Li Ximing wanted, and it also smoothed Tian Sanglin's furrowed brow. He nodded, gave Li Ximing a brief signal, and dissipated into black smoke.

Li Ximing thanked the young man before him, and they stepped into the Great Void together. He felt a little emotional and tested the waters:

"I had thought there was still some misunderstanding between us. I must thank you for helping this come to fruition!"

"Helping?"

Jiao Zhongzi chuckled and turned his head.

"Not at all... If I missed this opportunity with you, who knows how long it would be until the King finds a spirit embryo for me. I am naturally the most anxious one. After all, we are not on good terms with Xiukui, and it's difficult to find help elsewhere."

"And since this spirit embryo is destined for my pocket, its efficacy, its wondrous properties, and which type suits me best—these are things only I truly care about!"

His candid explanation made Li Ximing nod, though he remained half-convinced. They headed toward the mainland together, and Li Ximing smiled.

"What happened with Baoqing?"

"Him?"

This Eastern Yue man showed a hint of schadenfreude.

"The Temple Master of the Great Konghai Temple didn't lift a finger. So, naturally, Baoqing obediently discarded his dharma body and fled to the Buddhist Land. Shitang has now been carved up by the various families. You could say it was a happy ending for everyone."

He and Tuodu had discussed this at sea. It was easily the sloppiest battle Li Ximing had fought since reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. He strongly agreed with the assessment and felt new doubts about the Great Konghai Temple's strategy. He probed:

"Baoqing seized Shitang, catching Azure Pond off guard. But without the prestige of the Supreme Yang Dao, he could never have held it for long."

Jiao Zhongzi clasped his hands behind his back and smiled, shaking his head.

"Not so. Zhaojing, you must understand, that Temple Master, Jinghai, has not reincarnated in a hundred years. Not only has he not reincarnated, he cannot even leave the Buddhist Land!"

"Why hasn't the Master of the Great Konghai Temple reincarnated after all these years? Is it because he doesn't want to? It's because his temple lacks a dharma-image at its peak, and his position is unstable! This expanse of Buddhist Land absolutely requires someone to sit amidst the heavenly rain of mandara flowers and preside over it."

"So, for all these years, Jinghai has been in an extremely awkward position, having to tear down the east wall to repair the west wall. He finally managed to secure a position, but after long consideration, he wouldn't give it to anyone. He gave it to Baoqing, who has a blood feud with Azure Pond... This was purely out of fear..."

"After all, the moment he leaves, he must vacate the position of presiding over the Buddhist Land. He is terrified that someone will steal his position in the future, so he had to find a Maha who would be forced to rely on him."

Jiao Zhongzi sneered.

"And look at the result. Not only did Baoqing return heavily injured and unable to move, barely maintaining the Buddhist Land, he also made mortal enemies of nearly every surrounding power. What can he dare to do? He can only continue to be Jinghai's dog!"

Li Ximing understood at once. The lingering doubts in his mind about the Shitang affair vanished. The conversation stopped there, but he quickly formed another conclusion:

"Since Jinghai achieved his goal, it was actually Azure Pond that suffered the greatest loss. In the end, it was the other families who carved up Azure Pond's territory in Shitang."

The two traveled through the Great Void for a while and soon arrived at Lake Xian. Jiao Zhongzi stopped, wary. The flame on his glabella flickered faintly as he said softly:

"Daoist friend, please go retrieve the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury."

Li Ximing nodded. He rose up as a beam of light, moving a short distance away. He felt slightly uneasy. He used the jade talisman at his waist to contact Ning Wan and waited a moment, sending a call of light through the Great Void.

Only a moment passed before wind and snow gathered, and Ning Wan arrived, riding the blizzard. She smiled upon seeing Li Ximing and said gracefully:

"Congratulations, Zhaojing, on your safe return! The Great One also sent a sword over and has already taken Fei Qingya away. Her future affairs have been entrusted to Xiukui."

Li Ximing let out a sigh of relief and offered his thanks. Ning Wan smiled politely and asked:

"The Southern Songzhou Luoshe... did the negotiations go well?"
Li Ximing replied:

"More or less settled. They just want one 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill'. They said the Supreme Yang Dao has a share... Do you know what it is? Is it considered precious?"

Ning Wan thought for a moment.

"That item should be from the Great Ning Palace. It's a spirit pill from the 'True Qi Dao' and has been lost for many years. Back then, three pills were left stored in a great cauldron. There were four cauldrons in total, for twelve pills. The Si Family obtained one cauldron; it was Xuanfeng who retrieved it."

"This 'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill' was a red-hot commodity in ancient times. It was a great treasure used by the Ning State to unite the various families. It was said to 'Support the Nine Qi, Equalize and Ancientize, Condense Talismans, and Embellish Divine Abilities.' I don't know how those heretical paths use it, but for our Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, it can slightly assist a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in catalyzing their immortal foundation into a Divine Ability!"

Li Ximing nodded, and Ning Wan continued:

"Of the Si Family's three pills, Senior Yuanxiu has certainly used one. The remaining two are in Si Yuanli's hands, but he is currently in seclusion... If he succeeds, you can trade with him for one. If that fails... there's still Gao or Xiukui. With your skills in alchemy, fellow Daoist, obtaining one shouldn't be too difficult."

Li Ximing now had a plan. Honestly, if he were a bit shameless, he could just stall, since Si Yuanli was still in seclusion. Once the Spiritual Artifact was in his hands, saying he was "waiting to trade with the Si Family" was a perfectly plausible excuse.

'But... my reputation precedes me. Since I'm taking their item, it's best to do my utmost to get the pill for the Southern Songzhou Luoshe. Making friends is always better than making enemies.'

"Thank you, fairy!"

He bowed in farewell and headed for the lake. He passed through multiple layers of formations, activated a hidden mechanism, and retrieved a small, silver-white casket from within the array before returning to Lake Xian.

Jiao Zhongzi was waiting patiently at Lake Xian. Seeing Li Ximing arrive on his beam of light, he asked with anticipation:

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing?"

Li Ximing flipped open the silver-white casket, revealing an inch of bright, flowing light within. He had sealed it with his Divine Ability to prevent it from transforming. He asked with equal anticipation:

"Fellow Daoist, please take a look?"

Jiao Zhongzi paused for a breath and then smiled.

"It is indeed the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury! And in excellent condition! Thank you, fellow Daoist!"

At this point, Jiao Zhongzi finally relaxed, looking much more at ease. He sighed.

"My Southern Songzhou Luoshe has been lacking this one Whole Pill... We searched so hard for it. To make matters worse, Daoist Master Qiushui's Divine Ability has been growing more perfect, so the Golden Feather Sect has been buying up most of the Whole Pill Purple Mansion Realm spiritual objects from the last few decades at high prices... We couldn't find one anywhere! It's only because Hengzhu is on bad terms with the Golden Feather Sect and wouldn't do business, and because he also preserved it for your noble clan instead of using it, that this one portion remained..."

Li Ximing had already figured it out. The other spirit pill and the help refining the spirit embryo were just side items. They had been coveting the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury for a long time. Otherwise, why would they hand over the Spiritual Artifact first? They just knew the values weren't equal, feared he would raise the price, and were in a hurry to trade for the spiritual object. He couldn't help but laugh.

"It is merely a change of fate. It is your opportunity, as well as my own."

"Well said!"

Jiao Zhongzi clapped his hands and sighed. He fumbled in his sleeve for a moment and took out a short knife with an ivory blade and a jade hilt. He smiled.

"This is the 'Gleaming Edge'. It's an ancient dharma artifact I acquired by chance. Its quality is excellent. I'll give it to you, fellow Daoist. When you have news, just send a jade slip to the Southern Songzhou Luoshe."

Li Ximing accepted it solemnly. Only then did the other man retrieve a jade box from his sleeve. He opened it with his Divine Ability, revealing the Radiant Sun King's Halberd inside. A deep, golden-yellow light shot out. Li Ximing received it with both hands, feeling the weight settle in his palms. His eyes burned with desire. The bone-deep exhaustion from rushing around had finally dissipated.

"This truly wasn't easy!"

This was a heartfelt sigh. Li Ximing's obsession with Spiritual Artifacts ran deep. Whether fighting Yehui or Changxiao, he had been suppressed by his opponent's Spiritual Artifact and suffered greatly. Later, when he held the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, he was practically unwilling to let it go.

Since then, Li Ximing's obsession with Spiritual Artifacts had only grown. He had traveled all over the Southern Sea, rushing from place to place, even giving away his most treasured spiritual object. Now, holding the heavy Radiant Sun King's Halberd in his hands, he felt a sense of peace. Though it was only the length of his forearm, its heavy, iridescent gold mixed with a faint, silvery, sandy light was deeply reassuring.

As Jiao Zhongzi released his spiritual sense and erased his imprint, ownership of the Spiritual Artifact transferred. A potent Bright Yang Divine Ability surged up the long, round haft, instantly dyeing the qilin-scale patterns gold. Hidden runes beneath ignited one by one. The Spiritual Artifact seemed to come alive, shining with brilliant rays of light.

After several hundred years, this Radiant Sun King's Halberd was finally being infused with a Bright Yang Divine Ability. It began to tremble with spirituality, emitting clear, metallic chimes.

*Clang, clang, clang...*

*BOOM!*

The Profound Light flared. Li Ximing slightly relaxed his grip, and the Radiant Sun King's Halberd immediately shot up, assuming the posture of High Radiance. It hovered silently before him. An oppressive weight instantly filled the air, causing the Great Void to grow murky and the spiritual qi to fluctuate.

The Spiritual Artifact, now suffused with the Audience with the Celestial Gate Divine Ability, released an immense pressure, causing Jiao Zhongzi, who stood before him, to stagger. Faintly, the sound of cicadas could be heard within the Great Void.

Li Ximing couldn't help but close his eyes, communing with the Spiritual Artifact.

The Eastern Yue Purple Mansion Realm cultivator took a step back, watching calmly. He waited until Li Ximing exhaled a pale purple flame. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd then fell from the sky like a shooting star and was absorbed into the Profound Light at his glabella.

A faint golden, halberd-shaped sigil flashed and vanished behind Li Ximing's back. Stimulated by his Divine Ability, two sparks of fire lit up on Jiao Zhongzi's glabella before being quickly suppressed. He was clearly seeing the Spiritual Artifact display such profound power for the first time. He let out a deep breath and sighed.

"Congratulations, Zhaojing. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd has finally found its proper use."

Li Ximing felt the overwhelming urge to stop and test his new Spiritual Artifact. He was in an excellent mood, and even the Eastern Yue man before him looked agreeable. He smiled.

"Thank you, fellow Daoist!"

The flame on Jiao Zhongzi's glabella had only flashed for an instant, but Li Ximing was extremely sensitive to fire. He immediately sensed that the flame was extraordinary and offered praise:

"I didn't realize you were also a master of fire, fellow Daoist."

"Oh?"

Jiao Zhongzi raised an eyebrow and smiled. Layers of reddish-brown flames surged from beneath his feet, climbing up his robes. The young man grinned.

"I have heard of your Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, fellow Daoist. This humble one wields the Lesser Yang's 'Shaoshang Minister Fire'. If we have the chance in the future, we should certainly spar!"

He cupped his hands in salute, then erupted into flames and soared south, leaving a faint streak of light behind.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, the future is long. We will have many opportunities to meet again."



# Chapter 879: Secluded Cultivation

Moongaze Lake.

The sky was hazy, but the lake was bathed in light. On the Viewing Pavilion Platform, the Li Fire surged, sending a column of flame into the sky. Li Ximing strode across the light, his gaze sweeping over the platform. The refinement of the Shichuan was progressing well; Chu Minglian was presently observing it, carefully deciding when to stoke the flames.

He was in high spirits. Nodding to himself, he stepped onto Gardenia Scenery Mountain and sat at the table. The Profound Light between his brows stirred, and he summoned the Radiant Sun King's Halberd.

"A Bright Yang Spiritual Artifact."

While both Spiritual Artifacts and spirit embryos served as weapons for the Purple Mansion Realm, they were worlds apart. A spirit embryo couldn't compare in combat, and a Spiritual Artifact was a treasure that could be passed down for generations. As Li Ximing refined the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, he realized just how different this weapon truly was.

Compared to the meager three abilities of his Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd boasted a full five!

Two of these abilities, its primary functions, had been mentioned by Tian Sanglin. The first was [Splitting Light], described as a power that "Shatters evil, punishes rebellion. It is not lightly granted, and when it moves, it kills."

This [Splitting Light] was the halberd's sole offensive ability, imbued with the foe-shattering might of the Bright Yang. Its one weakness was its speed—it was incredibly slow to strike. If it missed, the next attack would be severely weakened, even if the same amount of dharma power and divine ability was channeled into it.

According to Tian Sanglin, [Splitting Light] was derived from the Bright Yang divine ability Crimson Severing Arrowhead, which was likely the source of this limitation.

The second ability was [Radiance]. Its purpose was to "illuminate the land and its people." When the Spiritual Artifact was raised high, it could bestow a blessing upon allies.

Li Ximing examined it briefly. For a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, the ability was decent but not spectacular. When attached to his dharma body, it was like a weaker version of his Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption, though fortunately, it came with far fewer restrictions.

'The crucial part is that Earth-elemental and Bright Yang don't conflict,' he thought. 'This means I can use both blessings simultaneously. It'll make fighting the Merciful One much easier.'

After all, Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption couldn't defend against the Twelve Qis or Fire Virtue—its limitations were too severe. It wouldn't offer much of an advantage against Immortal cultivators. Thus, Li Ximing's reflexive "hypothetical enemy" was, naturally, the Buddhist cultivators.

Beyond these two combat abilities, the remaining three were far more interesting. Tian Sanglin hadn't mentioned them, likely because they could only be activated by catalyzing them with a Bright Yang divine ability. The one Li Ximing valued most was called [Mandate].

"Strong, it dominates; weak, it invites disaster. It bears the weight of an empire and sweeps away all obstacles... That wasn't just empty rhetoric. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd's power is truly influenced by my Bright Yang divine abilities. Right now, its power is merely average. But the more Bright Yang abilities I master, the stronger it will become. With Purple Mystery as the threshold, anything less than three abilities is actually a weakened state. Once I achieve grand completion in Bright Yang and unite all five abilities, this weapon... it might not be any weaker than the Ancient Spiritual Artifacts."

Li Ximing felt a mix of envy and bitterness. He hadn't even crossed the threshold of the Purple Mystery; achieving grand completion in Bright Yang felt like a distant fantasy. For now, he pinned his hopes on Li Zhouwei, which felt like the right move.

The last two were minor abilities: [Flame-Spitting] and [Improper Bestowal].

[Flame-Spitting] was clearly just a small perk. When the Radiant Sun King's Halberd was summoned, it would grant Li Ximing a mouthful of Li Fire to spew, slightly more potent than the kind found in Juque Palace, but not a significant boost.

"Used together with my Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, I suppose it's a nice little bonus."

Having familiarized himself this far, Li Ximing was thoroughly satisfied. The only exception was [Improper Bestowal], which he found rather exasperating.

'The Mandate cannot be improperly bestowed; once given, it signifies it cannot be controlled.'

This ability, [Improper Bestowal], had only one function: it prevented the Radiant Sun King's Halberd from being casually lent to others.

Normally, be it a dharma artifact or a Spiritual Artifact, as long as the owner agreed and opened their spiritual connection, it could be temporarily lent. This was how Li Ximing had been able to use Kui Qi's Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. Kui Qi remained the artifact's true master; he had simply lent it to Li Ximing.

By doing this, even though Li Ximing couldn't wield it with perfect proficiency and spent more dharma power to use its abilities, the ownership never changed. This avoided the messy business of imbuing it with his own divine abilities and mitigated many other risks. For instance, if Kui Qi desperately needed it, he could summon the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass to traverse the Great Void and return to him. And if Li Ximing refused to return it, not only would it take him much longer to refine, but Kui Qi could also use their connection to track him down.

But the halberd's ability completely eliminated this possibility. Once this weapon was given to someone, it *had* to be returned voluntarily. Otherwise, the Spiritual Artifact would be lost for good, like a stone sinking into the ocean.

'An ability like this actually exists... No wonder Tian Sanglin said it couldn't be lent out...'

He weighed the Spiritual Artifact in his hand, immensely satisfied. In terms of both its abilities and its raw power, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd was on a completely different level than the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger.

The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger's Geng Tiger Evasion ability had certainly played a vital role when he was fleeing for his life, but on a normal day, it felt rather useless. He mused internally:

"It's not just the difference between the Spiritual Artifacts. It's probably also because I'm not an Earth-elemental cultivator."

As for the halberd's other miscellaneous functions—like being stored within his Profound Light or emitting a bright glow—these were just minor abilities tied to his divine abilities, nice extras but nothing more.

He absorbed the Spiritual Artifact into the Profound Light between his brows and began to meticulously nourish and refine it with his divine ability. By the time he finished, day had turned to night outside. He finally rose and summoned Li Jiangqian.

Soon, Li Jiangqian arrived, ascending the mountain with a jade box in his hands. He bowed and said, "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing smiled and mentioned his acquisition of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. Li Jiangqian looked up, pleasantly surprised, and offered repeated congratulations. Li Ximing simply waved him off, not wishing to dwell on it, and motioned for him to begin his report.

Li Jiangqian opened the long jade box, revealing a pure black Dharma Sword nestled within. The moment Li Ximing's eyes fell upon the sword's shape, his expression flickered, and he shot to his feet.

He first used the Immortal Mirror to ensure they were alone. Only then did he take the Dharma Sword and scrutinize it. "It truly is," he murmured, his eyes narrowing, "the resemblance is uncanny."

Li Jiangqian nodded deeply. He reported all the details surrounding its discovery before continuing:

"During the time you were away, my lord... I sent out orders to investigate the four Dharma Swords. Besides our Black Creek, the other three—Falling Cassia, Sea-Parting, and Heart-Piercing—are in the possession of Bai Yinzi, Han Li, and Song Yunbai, respectively."

"The Converging Water sword is held by a cultivator named Han Li. We don't know where he came from; I've only ever heard you mention his name. We have no other information on him. Acquiring that one will be difficult."

"The Li Fire sword, Heart-Piercing, is with Song Yunbai. This one should be the easiest to acquire. While Song Yunbai isn't in Capital immortals, her family resides within the Hall of the Locust Soul's territory. We've already managed to obtain an illustration of it."

He retrieved a scroll from his sleeve and gently unfurled it. It revealed a masterful painting of a crimson Dharma Sword. It had more intricate patterns than Black Creek and was slightly longer.

"Not only was the color wrong, but it also lacked any ornament on the pommel. It was clear: this Heart-Piercing sword can be ruled out."

"Bai Yinzi's Falling Cassia is of the Supreme Yin attribute. After parting ways with you, my lord, he appeared in the great desert. We sent men to make inquiries and received word from the Zhuang family. They said he was traveling due north, toward the great river."

"As for his sword... Zhuang Cheng reported that the blade was sheathed, so he couldn't see its form. However, a part of the hilt was visible, and it was gray. Unfortunately... he also said... he did not see any ornament attached."

Li Ximing's gaze darkened. "The lack of an ornament means little," he said quietly. "He might have simply stored it. After all, the fragment looks like a common trinket. Bai Yinzi would have no way of knowing its true purpose. He probably just tossed it into his storage pouch."

"This man... must be watched closely!"

"Since he passed through the desert, the Golden Feather Sect likely has news of him. But if he's heading north, he's bound for the Golden Tang Gate's territory... We should ask the Golden Feather Sect about that sword. Fortunately, since it's a Dharma Sword, our family has a legitimate reason to inquire about trading for it."

"Your junior sent a few people to investigate, but I dared not be too conspicuous. If it weren't a sword, I wouldn't have dared send anyone to even look..."

Li Jiangqian cupped his hands. "Regarding the north, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from the Hall of the Locust Soul fell yesterday. It's clear you've already made your move, my lord. The Capital immortals Dao also lost another Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator a few days ago. Guan Gongxiao has pulled his forces back, and the demonic cultivators have now secured their foothold."

He retrieved a small letter from his sleeve and said in a low voice, "Guan Gongxiao is requesting aid again, hoping our family will intervene."

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal grunt.

Years ago, Yehui had plotted against his family on Changxiao's behalf, holding back his strength and harboring ulterior motives. Li Ximing had barely escaped with his life. Though he had no fondness for the man, he had always instructed his family to maintain stable relations with Capital immortals.

Yehui, for his part, also seemed unwilling to completely sever ties. He had kept his peace during the years Li Ximing was away. But that didn't mean he was weak. The man had obtained the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition and possessed several Spiritual Artifacts. He was not someone to be trifled with.

Since Li Ximing still didn't know Changxiao's whereabouts, he decided it was best to show some goodwill to Capital immortals. The fact that Li Jiangqian had brought this message to him directly suggested he felt the same. "Send word back to him," Li Ximing said.

"Tell him I have given my word. He is to hold his mountain gate. He only needs to wait a while longer."

Li Jiangqian bowed and nodded. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. "Three years have passed since that personage reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. The Hall of the Locust Soul has little strength left to resist him. He intends to travel north and will likely depart within a year or two. Pay close attention to the sword. I just hope it isn't that spirit embryo."

Li Jiangqian acknowledged the order. He then said softly, "There is one more matter to report, Daoist Master. Uncle-Grandpa Li Chengzhi... he passed away some time ago."

Li Ximing's fingers tightened on his jade cup. He finally let out a sigh. "I know," he said quietly.

Given Li Jiangqian's control over the clan, he naturally knew Li Ximing had already seen Li Chengzhi. He immediately lowered his head and shifted the topic. "On a better note..."

"Fortunately... after Uncle Zhouming finished handling your affairs, he took the pills the family had prepared and successfully broke through to the eighth level of Qi Refining. We are now preparing to have him consume that Talisman Pill to reach the ninth level, so he can attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Good."

Li Ximing nodded, then asked, "How are the family's sacrificial rites? You did not request a talisman, I trust."

"I did not."

Li Jiangqian bowed. "Now that the Purple Mansion Grand Array is in place, we conducted the rite with incense and obtained three Talisman Pills. As for Talisman Seeds... most of the children in the family are not yet of age. Although our Jiangque direct line has many cultivators, fertility has been poor... My younger brothers remain unwed."

He offered the three pills to Li Ximing, smiling. "Some time ago, I considered receiving a talisman to better help the family, but we lacked a grand array for concealment... Now, there's no rush. After all, this junior is only in the early Foundation Establishment Realm, and my cultivation speed is still fast. I can either wait to receive a talisman after I break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, using the Talisman Qi to enhance my divine abilities... or, at worst, I'll seek it during the middle or late stage of my current realm."

"Therefore, the Old Master presided over the rite this time. I did not participate."

Li Ximing nodded and sighed. "That's wise. The world is full of cultivators trapped in the later stages of Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment Realm, grinding away for countless hours. It's only when you reach the Purple Mansion Realm that you realize *divine abilities* are the real bottleneck... No miracle pill, no matter how potent, adds more than a tiny fraction of progress..."

Speaking of which, Li Jiangqian offered a reminder. "Since you have already broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Daoist Master, you can consume a Talisman Pill again. The 'Sacrificial Rites Method' states that the pill can break barriers and advance one's cultivation. It should be effective for divine abilities as well."

Li Ximing fell into thought. "I have considered this," he replied. "I'm still weighing it. Since you brought it up, you can speak your mind."

"I did acquire and consume many spirit medicines during my time overseas. My Audience with the Celestial Gate has already reached the minor completion stage, and I still have two spirit pills left. By stacking all these, I'm not far from grand completion... I was thinking it would only take another five or six years of effort anyway. Better to save the Talisman Pill... and use it for my *next* divine ability."

Li Jiangqian understood perfectly. He bowed low. "My lord, once you head north and return to the mountains, Jiangbei will erupt in conflict. There will be many great battles, and not just with the Daoist Masters of the Immortal Dao. I fear the Buddhist cultivators from the north will also intervene... When that time comes, it will not be simple."

Li Ximing rose, clasping his hands behind his back. "You're right... My urgent search for Spiritual Artifacts is for this very reason. It won't just be mainland Daoist Masters. I expect cultivators from both the mainland and overseas will come to spectate. Even if they can't get a piece of the Child of Destiny, someone like Fei Qingya is practically a supreme spirit medicine in their eyes. Besides, that personage is generous. After all these years, do you think people like Fei Tongcai or Bai Yinzi haven't received any benefits? And that's not even counting those who will simply try to fish in troubled waters..."

His expression was calm, but his tone was firm. "Now that we have a lead, everything else is secondary. The fragment absolutely cannot be lost. I can't afford to gamble. I will write a letter to Ning Wan, and then immediately enter seclusion. I'll use the Talisman Pill to force my divine ability to grand completion."

"Regardless of when the True Monarch departs for the north, he is set to return in six years and six months. That group will only make their move once his return is confirmed. We have more than enough time."

Li Jiangqian nodded. With his hands still behind his back, the Daoist Master continued, "Fortunately, with the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven in existence, there is no shortage of Bright Yang spiritual items and Spiritual Artifacts in the world. They are far easier to acquire than those of other Daoist traditions. Once this is done, I must continue the search for more Spiritual Artifacts!"

"For now, focus all your efforts on tracking Bai Yinzi!"

He dismissed Li Jiangqian. After writing the letter to Ning Wan, he sealed the grand array, took out the Talisman Pill, enveloped it in his divine ability, and consumed it.

Since breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Li Ximing had taken spirit pills on several occasions. Even the very best of them had only managed to make his divine ability stir faintly, inching it forward like a starved donkey turning a heavy millstone. But the moment he consumed the Talisman Pill, the divine ability within him seemed to connect with some profound aura, and it instantly began to seethe.

A powerful rumble echoed within him. The raw spiritual energy provided by the Talisman Pill was a drop in the ocean for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, yet it felt as though it had unlocked a hidden gate. His divine ability began to circulate spontaneously. Overjoyed, Li Ximing immediately consumed a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill. His internal dharma power surged, supporting the divine ability as it erupted in boundless light.

# Chapter 880: Chunyi

Splitreed Island.

The Azure Pond Sect's garrison on Splitreed Island had rotated several times. The tall pillars Ning Hejing had erected years ago were long gone, melted down and replaced with replanted forests. The high peaks were now covered in pine groves, dotted with graceful pavilions.

A young noble in dark robes stood within one such pavilion, sword in hand. The blade was gleaming gold, and six rays of golden light trailed long streamers as they spiraled around him. He raised an eyebrow, facing the radiant setting sun, and let out a long breath.

"A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... is truly different."

This was none other than Li Zhouluo, who had recently arrived on Splitreed Island. He had already emerged from his seclusion, having successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and formed his 'Golden Beast Plume'.

He had left Moongaze Lake behind, and he now radiated a vibrant, confident energy. He waited in the pavilion, and soon, a woman in green robes walked up the path, holding a swaddled infant.

"Yunqing!"

Li Zhouluo turned and nodded to her.

The woman gave a quiet smile, walked to the table, and handed him the child. She then took out a jade pot and poured him tea.

Li Zhouluo took the child from her, said his thanks, and turned to look at the baby. The green-robed woman sat quietly at the table, her gaze following his.

This woman was Pang Yunqing. She was the match Li Xizhi had found for him after several searches, the one he had finally agreed to. She hailed from the Pang clan of Bamboo Creek Island, a family under the governance of the Chunyi Dao Gate, and was currently cultivating at the Azure Pond Sect.

His father, Li Chenghuai, had not played a significant role in the marriage. The Daoist Master had returned to Moongaze Lake, emerged from his own seclusion, and then traveled to this island. After taking a medicinal pill, he immediately entered seclusion once more. By that point, Li Zhouluo's major life events—both his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm and his marriage—had already been arranged.

Li Xizhi had vetted many potential matches for Li Zhouluo, from families in both the Northern Sea and the Southern Sea. Countless families were eager to form an alliance, and there was certainly no shortage of beauties. Some of these families were in dire straits, grasping for a lifeline; others were simply meetings between peers, a chance to size each other up. Yet, after reviewing all the options, Li Zhouluo ultimately chose Pang Yunqing.

There was nothing particularly dramatic about their union. The Pang clan of Bamboo Creek had been under the Chunyi Dao Gate for generations, possessing a stable heritage. Pang Yunqing herself was a new disciple, accepted by the Azure Pond Sect only after the Ning clan took control. Her master was a Ning family confidant, Lin Wuning. She was quiet and unassuming. Li Zhouluo found her to have a good temperament, the families were a suitable match, and so the engagement was finalized. They later moved to Splitreed Island and were blessed with a rare child—the eldest grandson of the Fourth branch, Li Jiangchun.

Even though they had a child together, Li Zhouluo and Pang Yunqing shared few words. She was naturally taciturn; when she wasn't caring for the baby, she was racing against time to cultivate, leaving no opportunity for casual conversation.

While quiet, she was dedicated to her own path of cultivation and had little mind for other things. If he offered a few words of affection, she would just grow embarrassed and stammer. In the end, their relationship resembled that of fellow Daoists, their conversations limited to matters of cultivation.

Now that Li Zhouluo was out of seclusion and practicing his Dharma Arts, it was his turn to look after Li Jiangchun. This was their established routine. Pang Yunqing waited only a moment longer before murmuring an apology. With a dip of her lovely brow, she excused herself, clearly eager to seize the time for her own secluded cultivation.

'I suppose... nine out of ten cultivator couples from prominent families are just like this.'

Li Zhouluo was long used to it. He lifted Li Jiangchun in his arms and paced the courtyard. When he saw a middle-aged man in black robes approach, he quickly looked up and said:

"Uncle Wushao... What is it?"              

The years had left few marks on Li Wushao; he looked the same as ever. He offered a respectful bow and said in a solemn voice,

"The Pavilion Master requests your presence!"

Li Zhouluo stood up immediately. He looked left and right, but there was no one else around. He had no choice but to hand the child to Li Wushao, replying,

"I'll go at once!"

This startled Li Wushao so much he nearly jumped. He frantically took the infant, freezing on the spot, utterly bewildered. The baby immediately started to wail, making Li Wushao feel like his head would split in two, but Li Zhouluo was already striding quickly away.

Li Zhouluo made his way to the summit, where a man with a dignified, noble aura sat wearing a feathered robe. Li Zhouluo quickly performed a salute and said respectfully,

"Greetings, Grandfather."

Li Xizhi raised an eyebrow and smiled, speaking softly,

"Come."

He invited Li Zhouluo to sit before he began to speak:

"You must have heard the news from the Southern Sea last March. Several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators besieged the Maha, Baoqing. If the Buddhist Land hadn't intervened, and with the abbot of the Great Konghai Temple watching from the side, he would have been denied even the chance to reincarnate."

"That battle claimed one Maha and five Merciful Ones. Only three of those Merciful Ones survived. Although Baoqing escaped, he was critically wounded and is no longer a threat. The great families have since carved up the Southern Sea."

"Daoist Master Qiuhu has now stepped in to coordinate. After detailed negotiations with Daoist Master Zhusheng of Shahuan, they have managed to trade for the return of North Dan Island. Even though it no longer includes the original Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, it remains a crucial strategic outpost."

Li Xizhi said softly,

"Daoist Master Qiuhu needs someone to assume command there. Dantai Jin, for his part, recommended Clan-Uncle Yuanqin. At the same time, he resigned as Sect Master, using his seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm as an excuse. The position is now vacant, and many factions are voicing their opinions."

"Daoist Master Qiuhu asked him who should fill the vacancy, and Dantai Jin strongly recommended me."

Hearing this, Li Zhouluo looked up and said quickly,

"Grandfather, your strength and reputation are unmatched. No one in the sect would object. There were already rumors... Dantai Jin..."

Li Xizhi waved his hand, cutting him off.

"Dantai Jin's words are flattering, but it's impossible for me to take the Sect Master position. I replied to Daoist Master Qiuhu and suggested Tongyi instead. The Daoist Master is perceptive and will not press the issue. However, once Tongyi becomes the Sect Master of the Azure Pond Sect, people like Qin Xian and Lin Wuning are certain to rise to powerful positions."

"Yunqing is Lin Wuning's disciple. I've had him arrange a transfer to the Mushroom Forest Plains. It's not far from Moongaze Lake. You and your wife can cultivate there, and you'll be close enough to assist the family if needed."

Li Zhouluo quickly bowed in acceptance and asked,

"What about Father and you, Grandfather...?"

Li Xizhi shook his head.

"By my estimation, your father will emerge from seclusion soon. With the resources from the Yang family and the preparations I've left behind, he can focus on his cultivation in peace. Sending you away now is also due to the shifting situation... I no longer intend to remain on Splitreed Island."

"Ah?"

Li Zhouluo was stunned for a moment. He asked,

"Grandfather, you mean..."

Li Xizhi sighed softly.

His cultivation had been stalled at the peak of the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm for a very long time. His mastery of spell arts had improved steadily over the years, but it had hit a plateau and slowed. Without a greater catalyst, he feared he could not advance any further.

He was unwilling to take the seat of Sect Master, and the benefits from Splitreed Island were diminishing. He felt he was essentially doing free labor for the Azure Pond Sect. After so long in one place, he grew restless. Staring at his stagnant cultivation, Li Xizhi finally decided to leave.

Li Ximing had also written to him over the years. Although the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had clearly stated that paths within the Heavenly Glow Daoist tradition were exceedingly rare, with few legacies even among the most ancient Daoist traditions, what cultivator did not aspire to the Purple Mansion Realm? Especially one like Li Xizhi, who was only a single step away?

As news of one person after another entering seclusion to assail the Purple Mansion Realm arrived, Li Xizhi naturally couldn't remain sitting idly on the mountain.

"The Heavenly Glow Daoist traditions in this world originate from two places: first is Luoxia, and second is Mount Duan. If I am to find my path to the Purple Mansion Realm, I fear I must travel to Mount Duan, the territory of the Dragon-kin. Whether it was Lingu Xia or the Daoist who created the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique, both of them lacked a complete method at the end. They achieved their breakthroughs by forcing it in the vicinity of Mount Duan... There must be a clue there."

"This is my third rotation guarding Splitreed Island. Any other cultivator in this position would have already earned a fortune. A year ago, I requested to be relieved of my duties here, asking for leave to visit home. Daoist Master Qiuhu granted it."

He took a sip of tea and continued,

"I've already sent a letter home. The Daoist Master Zhaojing has entered seclusion, so I will ride the Dawn Rayfish back to the lake to check on things and consult with him. After that, I will leave the mainland and journey across the Four Seas to find my own Heavenly Glow Daoist tradition."

In truth, Li Xizhi still had a worry. He needed to ask Li Ximing in person about the meaning of that fragment. It was something that could neither be spoken of to outsiders nor written in a letter.

Hearing this, Li Zhouluo could only bow and say,

"I can only wish you a safe journey, Grandfather."

Li Xizhi waved his hand, rising with his hands clasped behind his back. He cut a dashing figure as he replied,

"Once matters for you and Chenghuai were settled, my greatest worries were resolved. When my father sent me to the sect, his only wish was for me to protect our clan. I already considered leaving when the Daoist Master achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, but the family was still unstable and I had lingering concerns. I stayed on this island simply to watch over and help..."

"Now that the clan is stabilizing, it's time for me to go back and see."

...

Chunyi Island.

Waves crashed, and reefs stood firm against the spray.

Chunyi Island was actually an archipelago. In the beginning, it was just a single immortal mountain rising from the sea. Through generations, the Daoists of the Chunyi Dao Gate had moved mountains and filled in the ocean, painstakingly reclaiming land. It had slowly expanded until it was now seventy percent the size of Crimson Reef Island.

From a distance, the immortal mountains and islands looked orderly and harmonious. A crescent-shaped pool on the main island glittered brightly. Cultivators refining the Supreme Yin soared on clouds, a sight of profound grace.

The island was not far from Crimson Reef Island, which in turn bordered the Sword Gate. Relations between the three powers had deteriorated significantly in recent years. The battle at the Green Pine Temple had been particularly brutal—so many cultivators had fallen that the spiritual motes and items transformed from their remains had yet to be fully recovered.

The Chunyi Dao Gate projected an aura of peace and serenity. Yet, a streak of azure light suddenly pierced this calm, shooting in from the north and flashing across the islands. It halted before the central immortal mountain, resolving into the figure of a man.

He wore azure robes, his features youthful, and his sleeves fluttered in the wind. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes a pale azure. The cultivators patrolling the area passed by as if he were invisible. Only the grand formation on the immortal mountain rippled, and a figure flew out to meet him.

This person was dressed in white robes, embroidered with patterns of waves and crescent moons, and wore a pale silver jade belt. His features were striking, with a high-bridged nose, but his eyes were filled with vigilance. He stopped a good distance away, carefully scrutinizing the visitor.

"I am Che Hong. Greetings, Great Daoist Master. Dare I ask if I am addressing Daoist Master Buzi?"

The man in azure was indeed Chi Buzi. His expression was perfectly relaxed as he replied:

"Che Hong... The Chunyi Immortal Dao has truly been blessed with talent lately. In just a few short decades, it has gained two Daoist Masters from your line—both grandfather and grandson. Is Senior Yuanshang present?"

"A friend from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition comes to call, and he can't even get past the gate?"

As soon as he heard this, Daoist Master Che Hong's expression turned cold and distant. He clearly recognized him. However, wary of the man's immense cultivation and famed Divine Ability, he did not turn hostile outright, only replying indifferently:

"Great Daoist Master must be joking."

This Daoist Master Che Hong of the Chunyi Dao Gate was blunt, all but stating outright: 'Does the demonic Azure Pond Sect count as part of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition?' Chi Buzi, however, remained completely unbothered. He said casually,

"The Chunyi Dao Gate now has four Daoist Masters, your strength rivals that of Hengzhu, and you have Daoist Master Yuanshang himself presiding. Surely you aren't afraid of me, all alone?"

Daoist Master Che Hong's expression was frosty. He replied,

"Great Daoist Master, do not jest. If you have no business here, I will not see you out."

Chi Buzi laughed. He raised his hand, palm up. A mass of grayish-black energy appeared, swirling in his palm and coalescing into a sphere the size of his hand.

"Take a look. What is this?"

This sphere of gray, thread-like water was unmistakably a highly condensed Divine Ability. Daoist Master Che Hong's own clan possessed this very legacy; he didn't need a second glance to recognize it. It was the Divine Ability, Chou-Gui Hidden Form!

Daoist Master Che Hong frowned. He had long known that Chi Buzi had broken through to the late-stage Purple Mansion Realm. This Great Daoist Master wouldn't travel so far just to show off. He remained silent, considering the implications.

But as he observed it closely for a moment, a bad feeling arose. His heart leaped as a sudden, intense familiarity struck him:

'This *is* our clan's Divine Ability!'

Chi Buzi said casually,

"I cultivated this from my own comprehension, yet I managed to manifest your family's Divine Ability. Don't you think Senior Yuanshang might want to take a look?"

At these words, Daoist Master Che Hong did not reply, but simply stared intently at Chi Buzi. The azure-eyed man continued,

"Some things cannot be said out here. I must enter the formation, must I not?"

Che Hong finally wavered, hesitating.

The formation on Chunyi Island was no trivial matter. If Chi Buzi intended to cause trouble, he would be severely suppressed within it. Furthermore, with four Daoist Masters in attendance, his willingness to enter the array was, by any measure, a sign of sincerity.

'Che Hong, let him in.'

A voice, carried by a Divine Ability, echoed in his mind. Though still reluctant, Daoist Master Che Hong had no choice but to step aside and bid him entry.

The two flew into the grand formation and were immediately greeted by swirling snow. A platform on the summit held a round, crystal-clear jade pool. The water within was a snowy white, tinged with moonlight, appearing as much like liquid as it did like piles of fresh snow. Nearby tables and chairs were buried. A middle-aged man in white robes stood at the pool's edge.

Chi Buzi finally adopted a more serious expression. He clasped his hands and said,

"So it is Daoist Friend Fuxuan. Senior Yuanshang is not here?"

"Master has not been fond of moving about in recent years. He no longer emerges from seclusion."

This middle-aged man, Fuxuan, did not seem to share the strong prejudices of his fellow Chunyi Dao Gate cultivators. He nodded slightly, inviting Chi Buzi to sit by the pool, and spoke in a low voice,

"You truly live up to your name as the great hope of the Chi family. If you had not defied Chi Wei's wishes, the Azure Pond Sect, and perhaps the entire Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, would look very different today."

Chi Buzi gave a noncommittal smile.

"Daoist Friend, you saw it yourself. I had a fortunate encounter and obtained an ancient cultivation method, allowing me to master the Chou-Gui Hidden Form. I suspect this art is one and the same as your clan's 'Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method.' I have come today to seek verification."

He raised an eyebrow and smiled, adding,

"The 'Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method' was a boon bestowed upon the Xi clan by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. As far as I know, they were the only ones to receive it. This very Daoist tradition has now fallen into my hands. Where this 'fortunate encounter' came from, and *which* Daoist tradition it belongs to... I trust I don't need to elaborate."

Daoist Master Fuxuan had allowed him inside, obviously having understood the implications. The Divine Ability in Chi Buzi's palm was genuine. Whether he had truly cultivated it from 'his own comprehension,' however, was uncertain. Fuxuan merely raised an eyebrow and said,

"Daoist Friend claims to have cultivated this from his own comprehension. Why not step under the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror? It would allow us to take a proper look at this Divine Ability."



# Chapter 881: Acquiring the Item

Chi Buzi heard this and was entirely unsurprised. He replied with serene composure:
"Please."

Daoist Master Fuxuan, seeing his calm demeanor, was already seven-tenths convinced. Suspicion bloomed in his heart:

'The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror is a Spiritual Treasure left by the Ancestor to suppress the Daoist tradition. Because of the Ancestor's failed breakthrough and subsequent fall... it possesses a unique divinity far beyond ordinary Spiritual Treasures. Since Chi Buzi is this confident... it's likely he truly cultivated it himself!'

Even if Chi Buzi was now a Great Daoist Master who had mastered countless divine abilities and secret arts, deceiving the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror—a treasure intimately bound to the life of a direct disciple of the Supreme Yang and the Chunyi Ancestor—was absolutely impossible.

At this thought, his heart pounded.

'Could he truly have found a Daoist tradition cache left behind by the Ancestor?'

Daoist Master Fuxuan raised an eyebrow.

"Che Hong, go and retrieve the Spiritual Treasure!"

Che Hong bowed and departed. Daoist Master Fuxuan turned back to Chi Buzi, his expression far more complex. He said softly:

"It is an artifact of the Ancestor, after all. We cannot move it without proper ceremony. Che Hong must first burn incense and bathe. I must ask the Great Daoist Master to wait for three days."

Chi Buzi waved his hand dismissively, raising an eyebrow.
"It has been many years since I last saw Daoist Friend Fuxuan. I have missed you dearly since we parted ways at Songfang Mountain."

Daoist Master Fuxuan stared at him intently and replied:
"You missed one occasion, Daoist Friend. I came to your gates to plead on behalf of the Chen Taojing brothers. But Chi Wei refused to see me and sent you down the mountain to turn me away."

This was clearly an unpleasant memory, explaining why Chi Buzi had received such a cold reception. Fuxuan pressed on, "As for Songfang Mountain, or Yu Yuxie later, or even Li Chejing at the end... we gave our counsel. For the Azure Pond to have fallen to its current state, it has only itself to blame."

"Not so."

Chi Buzi did not agree. "The Chi, Tang, Ning, and Si... what a sight they were back then. The Three Yuans were magnificent. Under Tang Yuanwu, there was Tang Shecheng and Yu Xiuxian. In the younger generation, Chi Zhiyun, Ning Wan, Si Yuanli... which of them wasn't a Purple Mansion Realm seed? Tang Shecheng was even compared to me. Everyone believed the next generation would continue the Azure Pond's golden age."

"Back then, we only worried that we had too many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and not enough Spiritual Artifacts to divide among them. We felt outsiders who reached the Purple Mansion Realm couldn't be trusted; if they lived too long, they'd become a liability. Who needed them? Who could have predicted that Yu Xiuxian would be killed by Guo E, or that Tang Shecheng would perish while assaulting the Purple Mansion Realm? Just look at Yuanwu Peak—they then tried to nurture Tang Shejun, and he perished all the same. Finally, there was Yu Muxian, who was killed by Yuansu supporting the Li family."

He shook his head slightly, sighing.

"The blame cannot be placed on one man. Would it truly have been a good thing if we had a few more Daoist Masters named Yu or Li back then?"

Daoist Master Fuxuan fell silent. "The Azure Pond is, after all, *his* domain. Even if he doesn't care and won't show his face, his style of conduct is similar. You, Daoist Friend, are a seeker of the Dao. The Pristine Water path is locked... it cannot be easy for you."

Chi Buzi watched him quietly. Here, at the Chunyi Dao Gate, he was unwilling to say more. He only said:

"Seeking the Dao... this is not the only path before me. My lifespan is long. The celestial might of a True Monarch is unfathomable. Perhaps if I wait one or two hundred years, the True Monarch will ascend to a new height. The qi of the Purging Dew might become harvestable, and a path will naturally open."

"And if that opportunity never comes, if I cannot become the  True Monarch's subordinate, I am now diligently accumulating connections and spiritual resources. The path of reincarnation is also a valid way forward."

He seemed broad-minded and at ease, having clearly accepted this. Fuxuan nodded internally, opening his mouth to say:

"That is the only way. Speaking of subordinates, I heard a Daoist Master from the North Ring Sect is attempting to reach Golden Core and hopes to become a subordinate of 'Blazing Fire'. His chances are said to be high. I wonder if he will prove his Dao in this world, and what method that entity will use to assist him... I wonder if we will have a chance to witness such a spectacle."

The two quickly fell silent. Though these two Daoist Masters had known each other since youth, they were, in the end, different kinds of people. Their Daoist traditions were in conflict. The brief topics they could discuss were nothing more than idle chatter.

Fortunately, to Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, three days passed in the blink of an eye. Daoist Master Che Hong, now dressed in immaculate white robes, came forward. He held a jade tray, upon which rested a mirror.

The mirror's face was eight inches across and snow-white. Its surface was like a perfectly still lake, clear and bright. The top was adorned with auspicious clouds supporting a moon, while the back was etched with dense, coiling Hornless Dragon patterns and feather-like silver lines that glittered and shifted.

Chi Buzi, merely sitting in its presence without even facing it directly, felt a terrifying sensation. His Life Divine Ability throbbed, sending waves of crisis warnings from that direction.

'The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror!'

"As expected of a Spiritual Treasure bestowed by the Supreme Yang Dao lineage and personally designated by an Immortal... Its power is likely the absolute zenith of all Spiritual Treasures."

Chi Buzi understood how terrifying this item was. Ninety percent of the reputation of the Chunyi Dao Gate's Ancestor, "Jiequn," was built upon the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror. This was no joke.

When Jiequn received this item, the master had personally said it had the potential of a Dharma Treasure and to nurture it well. Jiequn bound his life to it, nourishing it day and night with his divine abilities. Although the Ancestor later perished, failing to break through to Golden Core, and the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror was forever barred from becoming a Dharma Treasure, in any situation where Dharma Treasures were absent, this mirror's power was likely number one in the entire Supreme Yang Dao lineage.

Daoist Master Fuxuan rose respectfully, bowed, and only then took the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror in his hands. Chi Buzi glanced at it and saw its surface ripple like water, revealing a world within—a faint, hazy image of a zither, an incense table, and a bamboo forest behind it.

Fuxuan held the Spiritual Treasure aloft. Chi Buzi cautiously took a step back, and without hesitation, four streams of divine ability—intertwined grey and azure, rippling green and white—flared to life in his hand. Fuxuan, meanwhile, secretly sensed the mirror's reaction, his expression growing grave.

'How can this *not* be our Daoist tradition? The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror not only detects no taint, no trace of abnormality, but it's even emanating a faint sense of intimacy. If not our Daoist tradition, what else could it be?'

The Xi clan's Pristine Water Daoist tradition, the Chou-Gui Hidden Form, originated from the Ancestor Jiequn, who had received it via oral transmission from the Immortal. After Jiequn perfected his cultivation, he specifically extracted this Dao and left it for his descendants. Later, after Du Qing achieved the Dao, no one in the Xi clan cultivated Pristine Water anymore. There was no reason for it to have ever been leaked.

'Chi Buzi has already mastered it, so he must have the manual. If he'd obtained it from some past senior, he would never walk right into my hands. This so-called "fortuitous encounter" must be real.'

Fuxuan's heart was torn between joy and worry.

This was a Daoist cache related to the Ancestor Jiequn!

Despite confirming that the other party possessed his sect's Daoist tradition, Fuxuan's expression remained largely unchanged. He said casually, "Daoist Friend has great fortune and great character. It is clearly self-cultivated. But this item..."

Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow, his voice cutting straight to the point.

"Is it, or is it not, your esteemed gate's Daoist tradition?"

Chi Buzi's question was sharp, leaving Fuxuan no room to evade. Fuxuan had to clench his jaw and nod.

"It is!"

Chi Buzi lowered his gaze, saying nothing. Fuxuan smiled bitterly in his heart. The sect's Daoist tradition could not be allowed to circulate externally. He had to say:

"This fortuitous encounter..."

Chi Buzi looked up cautiously, his eyes narrowing.

"My acquiring this encounter was not as simple as just taking an advantage."

He glanced at Fuxuan and said coolly, "This Daoist Master does indeed require the Chunyi Dao Gate's assistance. I need a member of your direct bloodline to help me willingly. However, the location of the encounter... I absolutely cannot tell your gate's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

Fuxuan frowned. Chi Buzi stated flatly:

"Your gate possesses the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror. If I reveal the location and we go together, you will undoubtedly use the Spiritual Treasure to ambush me. I do not wish to be injured, nor do I wish to perish."

Fuxuan opened his mouth, but Chi Buzi continued:

"I know, however, that the most precious item within this hidden cache is a Supreme Yin spiritual object. How about this... your clan sends one direct-line cultivator to accompany me. I will leave a Spiritual Treasure in your clan's hands as collateral."

"Once the cache is opened, I will retrieve the spiritual object. I will then use other items from within to trade back for my Spiritual Treasure. The direct-line cultivator who accompanies me can witness the contents, and we can then divide the spiritual items fairly."

Fuxuan's brow was tightly knit. He remained silent, seemingly unable to find a major flaw in the proposal. The Xi family had many direct-line cultivators, and no shortage of those whose Dao paths were already severed. He wasn't afraid of Chi Buzi harming one...

He pondered for a long time. He understood that Chi Buzi feared the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror and would never allow one of his sect's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to go. The so-called reputation of the orthodox path was useless in front of such a suspicious man...

After an unknown amount of time, he finally nodded slightly, his voice soft:

"One Spiritual Treasure is not enough... Our person will bring the sect's Pagoda Heart-Clarifying Talisman. They will not fear spiritual confusion."

Chi Buzi hesitated, then said reluctantly:

"I will add one Spiritual Artifact. No more. This isn't some grotto-heaven secret realm..."

Fuxuan nodded, thinking to himself:

'First, I'll ask him for his copy of the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method*. Since he got it from a chance encounter, it might be more complete than our version! I'll examine it carefully. It's a double guarantee!'

But before he could speak, Chi Buzi waved his hand.

"Daoist Friend... what you say may be true, but I am not a member of your Chunyi Dao Gate. I cannot see the changes in the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror. You and your people understand what it means, but the opportunity is in *my* hands. How can I not be on guard?"

"What does Daoist Friend mean by that?" Fuxuan frowned, clearly confused.

Chi Buzi said, "The opportunity only states it requires a bloodline descendant who cultivates this path. How do we know that this Chou-Gui Hidden Form is the same as the one in your Chunyi Dao Gate's possession? Who knows if your Chunyi Dao Gate even has that much face? What if it's not? I bring your man over, we fail to open it, and return empty-handed. Your gate could immediately renege on the deal. It's just the death of one minor direct-line cultivator, but you'll have swallowed my Spiritual Treasure and Spiritual Artifact. Wouldn't that be a massive profit!"

"Hsss..."

Fuxuan finally understood. He sucked in a breath of cold air, as if the possibility of such a scheme had only just occurred to him. He felt a chill, but also a sense of marvel. He cursed with a laugh:

"That is something only you, Chi Buzi, could cook up!"

He turned and ordered:
"Che Hong, go and fetch the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method*."

Daoist Master Che Hong, who had been listening all along, was now full of anticipation. He hurried off. Chi Buzi calmly sipped his tea. After a moment, the Daoist Master returned, holding a golden jade slip. He opened it with a secret art and handed it to Fuxuan.

"Please!" Fuxuan said, full of confidence.

Chi Buzi took it, frowning as he read it from beginning to end. A quarter of an hour later, having seemingly read it over and over without finding any discrepancies, he said with considerable relief:

"Indeed, it is correct!"

The moment he said this, the two Daoist Masters beside him secretly sighed in relief.

Chi Buzi handed it back. "My thanks. Please send the person up. Old is fine, just not so old they can't travel... I can't have them falling apart on the way."

Clearly, sending an old man near the end of his lifespan was better than sending a cultivator whose path was merely severed. Fuxuan gestured to Daoist Master Che Hong, who soon returned with an old man. The man bowed to the three.
"Xi Jiankuan greets the three Daoist Masters..."

"Why him?" Fuxuan seemed reluctant.

Che Hong whispered, "Many are cultivating the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method* right now, but he is the eldest. When we told him of the matter, he insisted on coming. He said he doesn't have many years left anyway and wanted to make one last contribution to the sect."

"Hah!" Fuxuan waved his hand, replying via a divine sense message:
'Based on this man's words and his divine ability, this matter is likely true. It's just a single trip... but it's a needless hardship for an old man...'

Chi Buzi looked entirely unconcerned, sipping his tea and glancing at Xi Jiankuan on the floor. He wasn't surprised. A man as shrewd as he had long since investigated and calculated this. This was the most likely candidate.

'He only has a few years left anyway. By the time he perishes, Du Qing have returned from the Outer-Heavens. Can a dead man from the Xi bloodline speak? Even if he could, and you tried to turn the Xi clan upside down... let's see if Taiyi would tolerate it!'

The thought flashed through his mind, but his face remained serene, a secret smile playing on his lips.

'The Chunyi Dao Gate... Fuxuan and Che Hong... they aren't fools, but they are traditionalists, bound by rules and reverence for the past. How can they possibly outplay me? It seems I'll have to part with that Supreme Yin spiritual object, but the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method* is now in hand!'

Everything Chi Buzi had done, all the maneuvering, was for the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method*. Even if he had to pay with a spiritual object from the heavens, it was a worthy trade. Seeing the man brought before him, he gently flipped his hand, and two items appeared on the jade table.

One was a small, azure cauldron shrouded in gray light. Runes swirled around it, and the moment it landed, an aura of damp, falling rain filled the air.

'The Rain-Watching Treasure Cauldron.'

The other was a string of dark, bluish-black prayer beads. Each bead was like a condensation of deep pool water—round, glistening, and looking as if it would burst at a single touch.

'The Motang beads.'

Fuxuan looked like he wanted to say something. He glanced at the Spiritual Swords used for spell arts at Chi Buzi's waist and sighed.

"You have picked the Azure Pond clean!"

Chi Buzi smiled lightly. Having obtained the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method*, his mood had clearly improved. "What is mine," he said coolly, "I will not leave a single piece behind. What is not... I will not touch at all."

...

Moongaze Lake.

The hot sun hung high in the sky, illuminating Gardenia Scenery Mountain. This was the place where Daoist Master Zhaojing had his breakthrough. The mountain was covered in gardenias that bloomed all year round. Now, with every flower on the mountain blooming simultaneously, it was as dazzling as new-fallen snow.

Amidst the gardenia petals drifting down like rain, a white-robed Daoist Master sat cross-legged atop a jade pillar. The Profound Light of the entire mountain range brightened and dimmed with his every breath. From time to time, purple flames would circle him, yet they never burned the white flowers drifting past.

After an unknown time, the Daoist Master suddenly exhaled. A fierce wind instantly tore across the mountain. The sounds of horses neighing, armor clashing, and war drums thundering rang out as golden-armored figures marched across the slopes in a brilliant display.

Li Ximing slowly opened his eyes, the Profound Light at the center of his brow gradually receding.

"Audience with the Celestial Gate is perfected!"

Perfecting Audience with the Celestial Gate had increased its power. Its suppressing and grinding force was more potent than ever. This was the specialty of this Divine Ability, and now, with a single reverberation of the gate, perhaps not even Chiluo could escape.

The power of its golden-armored figures was also much stronger. But their application was too specific; no one would ever use Foundation Establishment Realm-level summons to besiege a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. It remained useless, except perhaps against an opponent like Yehui, who could also create thousands of bodies with his Sorrowful Southern Water.

Aside from that, the power of the Divine Ability's purple flames had finally improved. But Bright Yang was not a fire-based Dao, after all. It still couldn't compare to the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire and was doomed to be a mere accessory.

But these were minor points. What mattered was that Li Ximing had mastered this Divine Ability to its absolute limit, fully refining and storing it within his Shengyang Acupoint. He could now begin cultivating his second Divine Ability: Sovereign's Perilous Tread!

His spiritual sense sank into his Shengyang Acupoint. He saw the Profound Light representing Audience with the Celestial Gate tucked into one corner, leaving more space to refine other abilities.

In the center, the Talisman Seed hovered softly, emitting a faint, cold light. Though far weaker than Audience with the Celestial Gate, it possessed an unshakeable, piercing might.

Li Ximing swept his gaze over it and withdrew from his Shengyang Acupoint. He looked down. Outside his seclusion, one large and six small jade talismans were hanging, indicating that one year and six months had passed. There were no other alerts. It seemed the clan had been peaceful.

He set his mind at ease and retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve.

*Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*!

This was only a fourth-grade cultivation manual. While it would be considered a core text for a direct disciple in an immortal sect, it was nothing special for the current Li family, let alone the mighty Wei-Li Celestial Dynasty of the past. The name alone suggested it was not a key manual for the imperial family, but rather one for generals garrisoned at remote border passes.

Li Ximing had read it long ago. True to its purpose, the *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass* lacked the imposing, suppressive majesty of an imperial art. Instead, it was filled with the desperation of life-and-death struggle, of being trapped in hopeless situations, of asserting one's will through pure martial might.

Li Ximing's understanding of Bright Yang was considerable. Although he had never seen what a true imperial manual should look like, he could still discern many things. The *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass* leaned heavily toward injuring others rather than protecting oneself. He nodded inwardly.

'It's for border generals, after all. Their duty is to charge forward and kill. Why would they need so many defensive measures? A general must be willing to trade death for death.'

'Fortunately, it's a Body Divine Ability, so it's not bad. I already have Audience with the Celestial Gate for suppression. An offensive, charging focus is a good complement.'

He paused, retrieving a jade box from his sleeve.

Inside was the "Xuanguan Crimson Fire Qi."

This strand of Spiritual Qi had to be harvested from a "Xuanguan" (Profound Pass) personally established by a Bright Yang Dao cultivator. Furthermore, the pass itself had to be two hundred years old. The Cui family had been unable to cultivate this art in their early years. It was only after they constructed such a pass on Chongzhou Island that they slowly began to practice this manual.

The requirements were harsh. A Xuanguan took up a large area and was not easy to build. The Cui family didn't have much of this qi; they barely had enough for themselves. They had given Li Ximing one portion when they gave him the manual. The Li family had no surplus, which was why no one in the clan had been seen cultivating this art.

For a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had already formed one Divine Ability, forging a new Immortal Foundation was less complex than it was during the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The Embyronic Breathing stage required six rounds of cultivation. Now, his Dharma-body was clear of any foundation, and he could condense one at will. Moreover, guiding qi was not as troublesome as it was in childhood. By Li Ximing's calculations, what took three to five years during Embyronic Breathing would now take only three to five *days*.

Once these six rounds were condensed, he could consume the Spiritual Qi and easily break through to Qi Refining. The journey from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment Realm was not so simple, but with his Purple Mansion Realm Dharma-body, he could take pills as he pleased. He estimated it would take two to three years.

After that was Foundation Establishment Realm. With the help of his existing Divine Ability, it wouldn't be difficult. Although there was a chance of failure, by taking the tailor-made Essence Gathering Pills, the Immortal Foundation would form instantly!

The process of cultivating the Sovereign's Perilous Tread Immortal Foundation would likewise be much easier, similar to Qi Refining. It would likely take five to ten years. Once the Immortal Foundation was perfected, he just had to move it into his Shengyang Acupoint and follow the manual to forge the Divine Ability.

'Theoretically, this entire process, from foundation to Divine Ability, could be completed in under ten years!'

This was, without a doubt, a terrifying speed. Yet, Li Ximing had rarely heard of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator forming a new Divine Ability in just ten years. Even the fastest seemed to take twenty. The difficulty lay in the fact that the Shengyang Acupoint *already contained* a Divine Ability. Pushing a new Immortal Foundation into it was exponentially harder. If he failed... although his Purple Mansion Realm body wouldn't be seriously injured, the Immortal Foundation would be completely destroyed.

"That's equivalent to ten, or even more, years of work... all down the drain."

Although with every failed attempt to push the foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint, the residual divinity would adjust the position of the original Divine Ability, helping them adapt to each other and perhaps increasing the chance of success on the next try... failing time and again was a torturous ordeal.

As Li Ximing considered this, another realization struck him:

'If I suffer a grievous injury during this period, if my sea of qi is pierced... even if I can reform it easily, the Immortal Foundation within it would likely be destroyed by the attacker. No wonder these Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are so reluctant to fight, preferring to resolve matters through schemes...'

'And people like the Purple Mansion Realm rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea... they might spend decades, even a hundred years, just failing to forge a new Immortal Foundation...'

'If a second Divine Ability is this difficult, what about a third or a fourth? It must be astronomically hard! No wonder some Purple Mansion Realm cultivators get stuck at one bottleneck for a hundred years...'

He lowered his gaze, a name flashing in his mind:

'Art of Rebirth!'

'The person who devised this method was a twisted genius!'

'No wonder everyone covets it! This is a massive convenience for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators! You cultivate the Immortal Foundation in your own body, while simultaneously raising a "genius medicine person" on the side. When it's time to break through... you refine them into a pill and consume it. It's equivalent to getting a free, extra chance to birth a Divine Ability!!'

'That's a saving of ten or twenty years of effort... Who wouldn't be tempted? Who *couldn't* be tempted? Even if you weren't tempted at first, after being stuck at a bottleneck for ten, twenty, or even a hundred years... how could you possibly resist?!'



# Chapter 882: Luoxia Becomes the Mountain

Li Ximing’s heart tightened as he fell deep into thought.

'According to the rumors, one must cultivate a "medicine person" for years, nurturing them with one's own aura. That might be a challenge for rogue cultivators at the Purple Mansion Realm, but for a major sect? It would be laughably simple. They could prepare eight or ten candidates at once. It's easiest if they come from a poor background, but even a disciple from a prominent family... When the time is right, the sect just issues a notice. "Transferred overseas," or "Dispatched to the Southern Borderlands." Partway through the journey, they tear open the Great Void, consume the person, and simply don't return for years. Who would ever find out?'

'Even if this wondrous technique has limitations preventing them from grooming ten people at once, just having one or two... It's not their own cultivated power, anyway. They can use it to attempt a breakthrough, and at worst, it's an extra layer of insurance.'

'But using the Art of Rebirth to achieve a new divine ability... what's the underlying principle?'

Li Ximing didn't possess the Art of Rebirth to examine. At his current level, he could only speculate on the benefits of seizing another's immortal foundation to advance his own cultivation. But all of that assumed one already possessed a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method. Without one, what good was forcing that stolen foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint? You'd just be stuck.'

'The true "rebirth" aspect of the technique... there must be another crucial component. Just as Daoist Master Yuansu said all those years ago, it likely requires numerous Purple Mansion Realm-level spiritual items to assist... Only then could it truly work as intended.'

'Besides, the Art of Rebirth... every faction has its own version. Changxi claimed he was too principled to use it in his early years, but I doubt that. It was likely just a ploy to build rapport with me. The truth is, he probably didn't have a decent method to begin with.'

Li Ximing remembered Changxi's exact words: 'I know nothing of this art, I've had no success with it at all... I could only take him in as a guest elder.'

'Those were his words. Yet Chi Wei used the technique freely. In Changxi's hands, it was a century of failure... That's the difference a Daoist tradition makes.'

'That must also be why Chi Wei sought out Can Lufu for alchemy.'

'Back then, Changxi's Daoist tradition was in ruins, so of course he had no good techniques. The only two worth mentioning, Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire and the Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra, both ended up with my family.'

Li Ximing had no intention of seeking out the Art of Rebirth, nor would it be easy to obtain. If he stumbled upon it by chance, he might give it a passing glance to satisfy his curiosity, nothing more. He sighed inwardly, carefully reviewing his memories.

'Daoist Master Yuansu died before he could, so he certainly never used it. Yuanxiu definitely didn't use it in his early days, though it's hard to say what he did for his final divine ability in his later years. As for Yuanwu... I've heard no rumors.'

At this thought, Li Ximing's brow unfurrowed. He finally understood, and the pieces of his theory fell into place.

'No wonder... Yehui managed to attain three divine abilities, and Changxiao became a Great Daoist Master.'

Nine out of ten rogue cultivators in the Purple Mansion Realm have incomplete Daoist traditions. The Art of Rebirth is incredibly effective at shortening breakthrough times, but even if they had a brilliant version of it, they still lack the Purple Mansion Realm cultivation methods. They're like Zhu Gong: to break through, they *must* rely on the technique's path-continuing effect. But the subsequent cost of doing so is astronomical, far beyond what most could ever gather.

However, cultivators from well-established, resource-rich lineages like the Jiangnan Supreme Yang Dao are different. They either have exacting standards for their divine abilities or hold to a righteous path. They live stable lives, face no imminent threats, and have others defer to them. They are unwilling to take shortcuts or stoop to using someone else's immortal foundation. Often, it's not until their later years, after becoming a Great Daoist Master and still lacking their final one or two divine abilities, that they finally feel the need for such a technique. This, paradoxically, makes their progress appear slower.

Of course, the Supreme Yang Dao also produces people like Chi Wei. The inevitable result is that Azure Pond earned the reputation of a demonic sect.

It's only the overseas rogue cultivators like Changxiao, Yehui, and Guo Shentong—those who stumbled upon a complete Daoist tradition *and* might also possess a potent version of the Art of Rebirth—who act with true impunity. Their cultivation speed simply skyrockets!

'Everyone called them geniuses back in the day. But looking back from the Purple Mansion Realm, it's clear it wasn't just fate. There were concrete reasons.'

He exhaled. He was about to begin his cultivation cycles, but after a moment's thought, a lingering worry kept him from settling. He slowly closed his eyes, and his spiritual sense pulsed.

A moment later, a courtyard guard ascended the steps, bowed respectfully, and said, "Congratulations, Daoist Master! The Family Head left instructions that he wished to see you the moment you emerged from seclusion."

"Send him up," Li Ximing instructed.

He had been concerned about the Shichuan on the Viewing Pavilion Platform. Fortunately, he had already refined the ancient dharma artifact. The distance wasn't great; using his Bright Yang divine ability to connect with the Great Void, he made a quick calculation. The Shichuan's refinement was nearly complete, with only a tenth of the process remaining.

He was overjoyed at this. He had been about to summon Chu Minglian for a detailed report, but since Li Jiangqian had already sent someone, he would hear him out first.

Soon, Li Jiangqian ascended, bowing before the steps. "Congratulations, Ancestor, on the great success of your divine ability!" he said respectfully.

Li Jiangqian, of course, had no way of knowing if he had actually succeeded. They had simply discussed beforehand that this seclusion was for perfecting a divine ability. Every time Li Ximing emerged, someone was there to congratulate him on his "great success." They were just pleasantries, and he was used to them. The crimson-robed young man continued concisely, "Grand-uncle Lord Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow has returned from overseas. He is currently on the lake and requests an audience with the Daoist Master!"

"Zhi-ge'r is back!" Li Ximing was overjoyed. He shot to his feet. "What are you waiting for? Invite him in! No, forget it... I will go and greet him myself!"

The Daoist Master dissolved into a streak of light, traversing the Great Void. In the blink of an eye, he emerged above the lake. Looking ahead, he saw the brocade-robed Pavilion Master approaching, riding a cloud of mist. Li Ximing hurried forward, grinning. "Zhi-ge'r!"

Li Xizhi smiled and clasped his hands. "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing grabbed his arm and guided him toward the mountain, sighing. "Daoist Master, Daoist Master... what Daoist Master? It's Daoist Masters who are supposedly devoid of emotion. We are brothers. Third Brother, there's no need for such formalities. It makes us sound like strangers."

Li Xizhi landed beside him. Even after all these years, he still possessed that same air of noble grace, though his long tenure in a high position had added an effortless authority to his presence. He smiled. "You have achieved a divine ability, after all. As your brother, no one is happier than I am. I call you Daoist Master with sincere willingness. It gives me confidence. Saying the title reminds me that our family has its own Purple Mansion Realm expert."

Li Ximing laughed heartily. He had been rushing about for so long, he hadn't even had time to visit his brother in years. He was deeply moved. "Did something happen at Splitreed?"

Li Xizhi shook his head. "After all this time, what could happen? No, it's just... my cultivation has been stagnant for years. I'm thinking it's time to make a move."

"I cultivate the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique. While it's part of the Azure Pond Daoist tradition, it was actually left behind by a member of the Chi family—or rather, obtained by one of their ancestors. It was remarkably complete even then. And though it has been refined over the last five centuries, the core techniques remain unchanged from what its creator first passed down."

"This Daoist's name is lost, but he cultivated in the region of Mount Duan. That cultivator from the Lingu Family all those years ago, Lingu Xia, also practiced this technique. I asked the Lingu Family—he, too, went to Mount Duan and vanished. He's either off searching for an opportunity or already in seclusion, attempting his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm."

Li Ximing nodded grimly. He filled a teacup from the pot on the table. "Heavenly Glow Daoist traditions... I asked both the Supreme Yang and Nine Mounds factions about this when I was in the Eastern Sea. I'm afraid it won't be easy to obtain."

Li Ximing had indeed looked into this for Li Xizhi's sake. He had specifically asked about it back on Nine Mounds. Both parties—one from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, the other from the overseas Nine Mounds—became extremely guarded when the subject was raised. Lingdu was at least tactful about it; Houfu simply gave a flat refusal.

He relayed this to his brother, speaking somewhat cryptically. "The impression I got from both Daoist traditions is that... while the two places seem different, they are both, in fact, the territory of a single entity."

This referred to Mount Duan and Luoxia. One was the resting place of the Heavenly Glow, the other its origin and terminus. According to both major Daoist traditions, both locations were the domain of Wuguang Xiexia.

Li Xizhi hesitated for a moment before replying, "I know. The truth is, the Heavenly Glow fills the sky; there's nowhere that isn't its domain. I couldn't leave before, partly because I was worried about the family. But also, while there was no great war in the Eastern Sea, Daoist Master Qiuhu kept me there in preparation for the Southern Sea. Now, the Southern Sea has been carved up by the various families, the Buddhist cultivators have withdrawn, and I'm not really needed... If I don't go now, I might never get another chance."

"My status... is, after all, rather sensitive."

Li Ximing fell silent. His brother was right. He was, ultimately, a cultivator of the Supreme Yang Dao Daoist tradition and not his own master. The fact that Ning Wan was willing to let him leave to seek his breakthrough was already a gesture of respect for Li Ximing. If any new situation arose, Li Xizhi, lacking a Purple Mansion Realm method, would be forced to toil for the Supreme Yang Dao indefinitely, with no end in sight.

Li Xizhi was not like Li Queyi. His current good relationship with the Supreme Yang Dao and Ning Wan was a subtle thing. If the political winds shifted... or even if they didn't, Li Xizhi was a pawn that could be used, perhaps without him even realizing it, to forcibly drag Li Ximing into their conflicts.

Seeing that Li Ximing understood his implication, Li Xizhi nodded discreetly and changed the subject. "Furthermore, there is the 'Rainbow Cloud' path. It stands independent of Yin-Yang and the Five Virtues, separate from the Twelve Qi and the Ancients. Primordial Magnetism and lightning cannot stir it; blood-fiends cannot breach it. It abides between the world's zenith and the realms of water and fire. Where it stands, neither Bright Yang nor Profound Light can perceive it; neither Upper Shaman nor star-gazer can hear it. Its power is immense, its mysteries profound. So why do so few cultivate it?"

Li Ximing listened silently as his brother continued. "First, the cultivation methods are exceedingly rare, far beyond the reach of rogue cultivators. Second... even for those who obtain one, like Azure Pond, whichever family holds it refuses to practice it themselves. At most, they'll toss it to a minor outsider. And even then, they worry that if that outsider reaches the Purple Mansion Realm and later falls, the power will become uncontrollable."

"Back then, not one of the four great families of Azure Pond would touch it. Nor would the Yuan, Yu, Yang, Xiao, Eastern Yue, or Lingu Family before them. When I asked our Master for this Daoist tradition, it was for the sake of absolute security. And now... this is the price for that security."

"After all, Master never imagined I would one day touch the threshold of the Purple Mansion Realm. Without that foresight, the 'Rainbow Cloud' path seemed the safest, most proper choice."

The middle-aged man's expression was complex. He set down his jade cup. "Wu Earth... on the ground, it forms mountains; in the sky, it forms clouds. The so-called Heavenly Glow is, in fact, Wu Light. Wu Light was originally just one of many lights, alongside Heavenly Light, Magnetic Light, and Treasure Light. But now, it hangs isolated in the sky, perpetually, year after year..."

Li Xizhi stopped there, as if daring not to say more. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, placed it gently on the table, and lowered his voice. "I have been at Azure Pond and Splitreed for many years and have read countless Daoist scriptures. None of them were great treasures, but after reading thousands of texts, one is bound to learn something."

"I've acquired many techniques and even refined several Dharma Arts to a level beyond my predecessors, but they are of little use to the family. Except for one. It's a technique called the «Wondrous Art of Splitting Wu Cloud». It was an ancient spell art that I acquired at the same time as the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda."

"When I got it, I realized it was a spell art as profound as the famed 'Art of Merging Streams'. Its limitations were just too severe. I have spent years slowly modifying it, and this is the result..."

"This art... is designed to refine light into Wu Earth. To bring it from heaven to earth. To make Luoxia become a mountain."

Li Ximing was visibly shaken. "Is this a chance for liberation?"

Li Xizhi laughed and shook his head. "I don't have that kind of power. If I had that level of attainment, I wouldn't be agonizing over my own situation. But this spell art should be useful to you. It can turn Luoxia into Wu Earth. The Heavenly Glow in the world is abundant, and spiritual items from it are not rare, but their applications are very limited. With this, you can try to convert them into Wu Earth spiritual items."

Li Ximing felt little joy. His expression was conflicted. The brother before him clearly had ambitions for the Purple Mansion Realm, but he had been trapped on Splitreed Island for far too long. He met Li Xizhi's eyes, then looked down in silence for a moment. "Brother, if you go to Mount Duan, do not be reckless. Without a proper cultivation method... be cautious about attempting to break through."

"I understand." Li Xizhi smiled and shook his head. "There is one more thing. The Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda. When I obtained it from those cultivators, it wasn't simply to add to the family's reserves. There is something more important inside it."

Li Ximing immediately shot him a questioning look. His brother continued, "Daoist Master Yuanxiu examined it. By then, he already knew his death was certain and had given up hope that you would join Azure Pond. He wished to accumulate some good karma, but he couldn't find any trace of you, so he secretly bestowed this favor upon me instead."

"He left one instruction: the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda itself is not important. The key is the spiritual items within. They appear to be mere Foundation Establishment Realm materials, but at the very bottom, there is a Purple Mansion Realm-level spiritual item!"

"The item is a 'Heavenly Rampart Stone,' a material that is now extinct. If the family ever falls on truly desperate times, you can shatter the dharma artifact to retrieve it."

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He let out a long sigh. "Brother..."

Li Xizhi shook his head and said quietly, "Senior Yuanxiu's hope was that... one day, if Si Yuanli manages to break through and finds himself in trouble, our family might be able to lend him a hand."

"There was no written record, no oath. It's not a binding obligation. A Purple Mansion Realm item is incredibly precious, after all. I was afraid of an accident on the road, so I never spoke of this to anyone. I just wanted you, Daoist Master, to be aware."

Li Ximing nodded. Li Xizhi sipped his tea, then looked up. "The Yang clan's ambitions are vast, far beyond a single sect... I don't know what the future will look like. Li Chenghuai and his mother are safest and in the best position remaining at Splitreed. As for Zhouluo... he can serve as a minor pillar, but he is not the one to bear the weight of the family. Just let him live his life in peace."

He set down his cup. Li Ximing then hesitantly explained the situation with the Dharma Sword. Li Xizhi sighed. "I have troubled the family with these matters."

With that, he stood up and smiled. "These cultivation methods and spell arts I've researched... I will leave them with the family, just in case. But it is my hope that our descendants will never again have to cultivate the Heavenly Glow."



# Chapter 883: Golden Qi Soars to the Heavens

The Heavenly Light shone brilliantly. Atop the Viewing Pavilion Platform, flames raged, and at their center stood the red-robed Chu Minglian. His expression was one of intense concentration as he manipulated the billowing Li Fire.

In his lifetime, Chu Minglian had refined countless dharma artifacts. Even Li Xuanfeng's famous weapon, White Lightning, was his original creation. Although its subsequent upgrades had relied heavily on "Please Lord Take This Golden Talisman", the achievement had still brought him great renown.

This particular spirit embryo, however, was in a league of its own—an unprecedented creation that already transcended the very definition of a dharma artifact. For a cultivator who prided himself on refinement, forging it was an immense honor, one that demanded his absolute, unwavering focus.

After seeing his elder brother off from Moongaze, Li Ximing descended in a ray of light, landing on the platform. Chu Minglian immediately bowed.

"Congratulations..."

Li Ximing cut him off with a wave of his hand. He peered into the flames at the spirit embryo and asked: "How is the Shichuan progressing?"

Chu Minglian hurriedly offered his congratulations again. "Congratulations, Daoist Master! Everything is proceeding as planned. Although my humble skills are lacking, and I cannot claim to refine such an item effortlessly, the spiritual essences you provided are exceptionally potent. They have more than compensated for my shortcomings and have even elevated the spirit embryo's foundational quality to a new level."

Li Ximing nodded in acceptance. While he was no master refiner, he possessed the *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*. This allowed him to see through any dharma artifact at a glance. He observed the magnificent, pulsing crimson light within the flames and nodded again. "You have worked hard."

Chu Minglian humbly demurred. As he did, Li Ximing glanced over. A female cultivator in white robes, a sword strapped to her back, was descending onto the platform.

Her features weren't conventionally stunning, but she possessed an exceptional bearing. Her skin was as smooth as fine cream, and the absence of makeup only enhanced her clear, elegant beauty. She bowed to Li Ximing, her voice as clear and crisp as melting snow.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing looked at her, slightly surprised, and nodded. "Good! Your breakthrough was impressively fast."

This was none other than Li Xinghan, who had just emerged from seclusion after her breakthrough.

Li Xinghan had entered seclusion around the time the Hall of the Locust Soul was founded, over four years ago. It was indeed a rapid advancement. Li Ximing only needed a moment's thought to understand why.

'Xinghan cultivates the Jade True path. With the True Monarch having returned to their station, the world's jade energies are at an unprecedented peak. She also encountered the Inward Heart Surging Profundity, an event that benefits both the ancient paths and the Immortal Dao, especially for those in seclusion. Her breakthrough is no surprise at all!'

She was likely here at the Viewing Pavilion Platform to take over the watch. A pleased expression on his face, Li Ximing beckoned her closer. His gaze fell on the treasured sword she carried as he rose into the air on a ray of light, sighing.

"Good, good, good. The Old Master mentioned it long ago. With the return of the Jade True, several of the younger generation went into seclusion. He said you were the one he worried least about, but seeing you in person finally sets my mind at ease!"

"Among the Zhou generation, aside from Li Zhouwei, there really isn't anyone else who can shoulder the family's burdens. If only there were just one more with outstanding strength..."

Li Xinghan simply smiled and bowed. "This junior cultivates the *Jade Dao Unity True Art* and has achieved the 'True Dao Unification' foundation. There is a point of white brilliance in my Qi Sea that allows me to grasp the true essence of spell arts and pursue the pinnacle of any technique. It benefits my understanding of talismans, pills, and artifacts, as well as the arts of the sword and saber. When I cultivate a Dharma Art, I find it's especially effective if it's a movement technique or one cast through a dharma artifact."

"With the blessing of my Immortal Foundation, this 'True Dao Unification' allows me to enter an optimal state as a battle progresses. My eyes become clear enough to pierce illusions and perceive the smallest details..."

"Now that True Monarch Shangyuan has achieved Fruition Attainment, my 'True Dao Unification' has been greatly enhanced. It's completely different from the version the Yu family had. But..." She suddenly revealed a trace of confusion. "There is just one thing I still don't understand, and I wished to ask you, my Lord. My Immortal Foundation has another, stranger property. If I use a transformation art, the duration is not only greatly extended, but it's also far more difficult for others to see through... It sounds almost like... the Shamanic Talisman Dao."

Li Ximing led her further up the mountain, nodding slightly. He had, in fact, learned a fair bit about this from Zhusheng.

"'Jade True', although it has drawn closer to the Immortal Dao due to the Great One's breakthrough, is still, at its root, the 'Six-Nine Jade True,' one of the three great shamanic lineages. Transformation is a natural part of its power."

He smiled. "As for transformation arts, Que'Wan knows a few. They are far from useless. Furthermore, the old Eastern Yue Kingdom was infamous for its practitioners of shamanic arts; they were exceptionally fierce. Although a century of being... tamed... has left them as docile as sheep, their shamanic arts techniques are still stored in our vaults. If you have time, looking through them might prove beneficial."

"I will remember the Daoist Master's teachings!"

Li Xinghan affirmed. Since he was here, Li Ximing took the opportunity to ask, "I've been in seclusion for over a year. How are things with the family?"

Li Xinghan quickly replied, "It's not just this junior who broke through. Jianglong's breakthrough was even faster. He entered seclusion later than I did, but I had only just emerged when he broke through as well. He recently left for the Eastern Shore with Protector Chen."

"The Eastern Shore..."

As Li Xinghan spoke, she dutifully poured him a cup of tea. A theory immediately formed in Li Ximing's mind.

'That's not surprising. The Great One in the north is currently tempering himself in the mortal world. He even paid a visit to the lake. It's very likely he provided some assistance.'

He wasn't as familiar with Li Jianglong as he was with the young woman before him. Of all Li Zhouwei's children, only Li Jiangqian had met him more than a few times. Li Ximing quickly changed the subject.

"Our family still bears the title of a Sword Immortal Clan. Years ago, that name carried weight, but in the last decade or two, it's rarely mentioned. Very few of the younger generation even practice the sword. You are a rare exception. This legacy cannot be allowed to die. You must guard it well."

Li Xinghan accepted the charge. Li Ximing continued.

"I asked you some years ago... have you mastered the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon?"

Li Xinghan quickly replied, "The Sword Immortal's legacy is profound and difficult to fathom. After many years of study, this junior finally made some progress and managed to learn it a few years ago."

Li Xinghan drew the chilly blade from her back. With a gentle pull, a cold glint flared. A swath of sword light, as bright as moonlight on snow and as large as a ship's sail, flashed into existence. It shimmered for a brief instant before vanishing, immediately followed by three nimble streams of light, like shooting stars. With no target, they simply danced along the body of the blade.

Although her Way of the Sword already surpassed that of most sword cultivators, it still seemed amateurish compared to Li Ximing's two brothers. Her execution of the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon was precise, almost textbook-perfect, but it was too technical, lacking a spiritual edge.

Li Ximing silently watched the sword light fade. He glanced at the blade, *Hanlin*, in her hand, then lowered his gaze and took a sip of tea.

"Good... After all these years, the *Hanlin* has finally tasted the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon again."

His tone shifted. "However, I made you a promise. I said that if you mastered the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon, I would have a Dharma sword forged for you, one suited to the Jade True path. I will not go back on my word. The *Hanlin* is an extraordinary blade, but it is ultimately not a perfect match for your cultivation."

Li Xinghan quickly bowed in thanks. Li Ximing retrieved a jade box from his sleeve.

"Coincidentally, Chu Minglian is on the lake, and the spirit embryo is nearly complete. This is a Foundation Establishment Realm spiritual item, a Luminous Essence Flower. Take it to the clan treasury and exchange it for a treasure of the Jade True attribute. Then, ask the Old Master to retrieve the broken sword left by Yu Mujian after he surrendered to the Buddhists. With those, your new sword can be forged."

He didn't wait for Li Xinghan to respond, taking another sip of tea before asking abruptly, "I heard... Zhuang Cheng has a legitimate son... who seems rather taken with you. What is the situation now?"

Li Xinghan shifted, slightly uncomfortable.

"Actually, when I was on the verge of my breakthrough, he sent over a very valuable spiritual item of the Jade True attribute. I declined it. He is still on the Eastern Shore, and he often seeks me out to discuss sword techniques. Other than that... I haven't accepted anything else of value from him."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"What are your thoughts on him? Do you like him?"

Li Xinghan didn't seem to care much about marriage one way or another. "He seems to be deeply infatuated with me," she replied evenly. "And the family also feels he is a suitable match. As for whether I 'like' him... I can't really say. But he is exceptionally good to me, so it's difficult *not* to have a favorable impression. Since I certainly don't dislike him, and things have reached this stage, the rest seems to be a matter of course."

"After all... it's not right to keep him waiting indefinitely."

Li Ximing sipped his tea, giving her a surprised look. For a moment, he wasn't sure what to say. He had heard from Li Xuanxuan that this Zhuang Pingye was of top-tier appearance and bearing, with considerable talent as well. He mused for a moment.

"This isn't an overly serious matter. If, after a long time, you find you are incompatible, it can be... addressed then."

He poured more tea. "Since your mind is made up, I will have Jiangqian send them an implicit message."

As a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, Li Ximing didn't need to concern himself with Zhuang Cheng's opinion. A single command was all it would take. The Li family would relay the message, and Zhuang Cheng, despite being a famous figure in the Great Desert, would have to travel personally from the west to the foot of Gardenia Scenery Mountain and bow in gratitude to Li Ximing.

Li Xinghan quietly thanked him. "Cultivate well," Li Ximing said. "Don't let it weigh on your mind."

He picked up a brush, personally penned a few lines of instruction, and ordered Chu Minglian to prepare the spirit embryo for Li Xinghan's new weapon. Only then did he dismiss her. Li Jiangqian, who had been waiting at the foot of the mountain, then came up.

Li Jiangqian bowed deeply. "Reporting to the Daoist Master. During the year of your seclusion, the Great One has fully consolidated the north. He has hunted down and killed nearly every cultivator from the Hall of the Locust Soul. For the past year, strange omens have appeared in the sky almost monthly... The Hall has been utterly exterminated, root and stem."

Li Ximing wasn't surprised. "It seems both sides coordinated well. All those cultivators, unable to escape, were forced to remain and be slaughtered by the Great One."

Li Jiangqian said respectfully, "The Daoist Master is correct. Once the last of their leaders were dead, the Great One's anger finally subsided. The survivors at last scattered, fleeing toward the Eastern Sea. The Great One did not establish his own faction, instead choosing to elevate a few of the local clans... He also granted his most capable subordinates mountains of their own."

"The Great One declared himself the true heir of Secret Diffusion and distributed countless dharma artifacts and spiritual items. Song Yunbai and Xiao Yuan, among others, benefited greatly. More recently, someone has appeared under Xiao Yuan's command... using a false name. It is rumored they are connected to Li Quantao."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. Li Jiangqian continued his report. "As for the surrounding powers... the Capital immortals Dao has suffered heavy losses. Guan Gongxiao himself was nearly killed. The territories of Xuanmiao Temple were almost completely ruined by that Yaosa Chengmi... By the time the Great One arrived, Yaosa Chengmi had already fled to the far north. It's said the Great One is now considering a trip north himself..."

"It's also said that with no one left to lead the Situ family of the Golden Tang Gate, the sect has fallen into chaos, run by low-level cultivators. They've apparently been colluding with some Buddhist monks and have even invited them into their mountain gates."

Hearing this, Li Ximing shook his head and sneered. "None of the great families will bother with them now. It's just a gaggle of ignorant junior cultivators. The only question is whether Golden Feather will intervene."

He then asked the question that concerned him most. "What about Bai Yinzi?"

Li Jiangqian lowered his voice. "This junior searched for a long time without finding any trace. I repeatedly questioned the Zhuang family and investigated several groups of rogue cultivators. We mapped out several mountain ranges and searched them one by one. Finally, we found a range where local rogue cultivators recognized the description. The location should be west of the Tangdao Mountain Range and about a hundred li north of the riverbank."

"I am almost certain he is there!"

Li Ximing nodded, satisfied. This wasn't a discovery made through divine abilities or dharma power, but through pure intelligence gathering and manpower. It had saved him a great deal of effort.

"Such a large-scale search has naturally attracted the attention of watchful eyes. Fortunately, his quarry holds a Dharma sword, which makes our interest perfectly justifiable."

He presented a jade slip with both hands. "His suspected current location, along with several other locations we investigated and ruled out, are all recorded within. Just in case."

Li Ximing accepted it. After hearing a few more updates on family matters, he returned to his jade pillar, preparing to resume his cultivation.

But Li Ximing had barely settled when the spiritual energy of the entire Gardenia Scenery Mountain began to heave like a great tide. His eyes snapped open, revealing profound shock.

His spiritual sense, connected to both the Great Void and the spiritual energy of the real world, was usually calm and tranquil. Even a nearby Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough would barely cause a ripple in the Great Void...

But now, the Great Void was reeling as if from massive, repeated impacts. It roiled like a stormy sea, surging southward, cresting into towering peaks one moment and collapsing into deep troughs the next.

'What is this... Are the earth veins themselves turning over?'

The fluctuations in the mountain's ambient energy might have been subtle, but what Li Ximing perceived through the Great Void was anything but!

*BOOM!*

A deafening, thunder-like roar echoed across the heavens. Li Ximing instantly traversed the Great Void, reappearing on the North Shore and gazing northward.

In the next instant, a colossal pillar of pure golden, iridescent light erupted, as thick as a mountain, tearing straight into the sky. The entire northern horizon was instantly consumed by this pure, golden qi.

*BOOM!*

An absolutely terrifying tremor and roar echoed from the north. The golden qi existed for only a second; it collided with the clouds above and dissolved into a sky-full of autumn dew that began to patter down. But the source of the golden qi did not stop. The earth itself shook, and the Great Void continued to heave, sending one violent shockwave after another from the north.

Riding his Heavenly Light, Li Ximing was in utter disbelief.

'A Purple Mansion Realm expert has fallen? No, that's not quite right...'

He took a step forward, crushing a jade talisman in his hand. Nearby, he quickly found Ning Wan, who was also staring north, her gaze filled with the same stunned astonishment.

Seeing Li Ximing, Ning Wan's eyes lit up. "Congratulations, Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing waved her off, his expression full of questions. "This is..."

Ning Wan's expression was complex. "This phenomenon is... extraordinary. The soaring golden qi is incredibly pure; it must be related to the Purple Mansion Realm. And with the simultaneous tremor of the earth veins... I'm afraid... something has happened at the Golden Tang Gate."

"The Golden Tang Gate?"

Li Ximing had never considered that sect. Only now, connecting the tremor of the earth veins with the sky-filling golden qi, did he realize with dawning horror, "The Golden Tang Gate's Purple Mansion-level Grand Array?!"

"Exactly!"

Ning Wan seemed disconcerted. She stared at the scattered autumn rain falling from the north, clearly at a loss. This event had obviously surpassed her predictions. "The Golden Tang Gate's Purple Mansion Grand Array has shattered," she whispered. "The Sect-Guarding Spirit Array that Situ Tang established all those years ago... along with the one or two priceless treasures that served as its core... they've all just... sublimated. It first shook the earth veins to break the array's foundation, and then vaporized into that pillar of golden qi."

"Three generations of the Situ family, father and son both reaching the Purple Mansion Realm... they were once the preeminent sect of the Xu State. The glorious, unassailable Golden Tang Daoist tradition... Today, it is extinguished."

(End of this chapter)



# Chapter 884: Heavenly Beard

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow, his gaze drifting north where the strange autumn dew continued to fall, drop by drop. He exchanged a look with Ning Wan, then said hesitantly, "Should we go take a look?"

Ning Wan nodded. "Agreed. With a disturbance this massive, both the Sword Gate and Xiukui will have seen it. They're bound to arrive sooner or later, so we don't need to worry about being the first ones there."

The Great Void itself was trembling, roiled by waves of thick, heaven-piercing golden qi. It was no safe path for travel. Since Tangdao Mountain wasn't far, the two simply activated their divine abilities, crossing the distance in moments to arrive at a vantage point overlooking the mountain.

Tangdao Mountain, its rugged peaks rolling as the main summit thrust toward the sky, was now completely enveloped in golden qi. The zenith was a thick, white expanse—not cloud, not mist, but something more like roiling, sandy smoke. It billowed and churned, clinging to the air, refusing to disperse.

Any clouds in the sky had long since been dissolved, preventing the golden qi from condensing and falling as autumn dew. The qi was gushing forth far faster than it could diffuse, and this white-golden miasma only grew thicker, punctuated by deep, rumbling booms.

Faint, colorful lights pulsed within the sky. Huge, gilded figures—golden bodies—loomed and vanished within the white qi and falling dew. Periodically, flashes of light would erupt from the ground below, ascending to the Buddhist Land.

Li Ximing stared, his expression growing troubled. "It's the Buddhist cultivators, no doubt," he murmured. "Is Golden Feather... really just going to ignore this?"

'The Golden Tang Gate has been annihilated. Golden Feather must know. In fact, given Golden Feather's current power and prestige, the Buddhist cultivators would *never* have dared to dismantle the Golden Tang Gate without a word... unless it was an order from Luoxia.' How could Li Ximing not understand the implication? 'They must have sold the sect out for a very good price.'

Ning Wan fell silent, only speaking after a long moment. "Situ Huo once promised to give the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope to Golden Feather. My family's elders intervened and stopped it. But later, after your duel with Changxiao, they must have reached some secret agreement, because Golden Feather ended up with the Spiritual Artifact anyway... Judging by Golden Feather's attitude, it's clear the Golden Tang Gate's usefulness had already run out by then."

"Now they've handed the entire mountain over to the Buddhist cultivators. A perfectly good Purple Mansion-level formation... they just left it for these monks to shatter. And these Buddhist cultivators... a Purple Mansion formation is an incredibly precious thing! Even if they couldn't use it themselves, couldn't they have sold it to someone else? Why destroy it like this..."

With Ning Wan's words, the implication was clear. Li Ximing understood immediately.
'What other motive could there be? This golden qi floods the heavens and shrouds all of Jiangbei. The prize they're after... it can only be the spiritual essence.'

The Golden Feather Sect rarely involved itself in scrambles for spiritual essence. They possessed their own Grotto-Heaven, presided over by True Monarch Duijin, a master of Metal Virtue. Any cultivator following Golden Feather's orthodox Metal Virtue Daoist tradition could simply break through within that Grotto-Heaven. Why would they ever need to cause such a commotion in the outside world?
'This current spectacle... perhaps it's all for the Golden Feather Sect's Daoist Master Qiushui.'

But while Li Ximing was lost in thought, Ning Wan's expression grew complicated. "But... the Inward Heart Surging Profundity was already exceptionally rare and powerful," she said softly. "To have Tangdao Mountain thrown into such chaos... this is not a good thing."

Li Ximing frowned at her. Ning Wan, however, began to move closer, her feet seeming to tread on snow as she advanced. Li Ximing followed close behind. When they were about ten li from the mountain, the colorful lights and the outlines of the Buddhist Land became sharp and clear. Only then did Ning Wan halt.

One sweep of his gaze, and Li Ximing realized something was wrong.

A black, roiling tide of baleful qi was surging from the mountain range, cresting over the hills like dark waves. The golden qi trapped in the sky, which had nowhere else to go, now seemed drawn by an invisible force. It began to fall, not as dew, but as long, silken threads of white, all being pulled from the heavens down into the earth.

Ning Wan caught a lingering drop of the autumn dew. "Metal Virtue cultivators have a maxim," she said, "known as 'Sinks Upon Encountering Balefulness.' The golden qi is trapped above the mountain. With no clouds or mist, it cannot manifest as the purifying qi of autumn and winter. Instead, it is drawn down by the Baleful Earth and sinks. And this very act of sinking... it refines the Baleful Earth into Primordial Magnetism."

"The great formation of Tangdao Mountain is shattered, completely uprooted. It's so broken, it can't even collapse into a stable forbidden zone. All that's left are the perforated, bleeding earth veins. This is the perfect moment for the Baleful Earth to surge outward. The instant it meets that metal qi, it transforms into Primordial Magnetism."

Her expression was tinged with confusion as she turned to Li Ximing. "This is the source of one of the three great lightnings... Primordial Lightning."

Li Ximing froze.

His own junior, Li Que'wan, cultivated the 'Whole Pill' path! He'd known for some time that this specific path had three great fears: first, Converging Water; second, Merging Fire; and the third... Primordial Magnetism!

'This sheet of golden qi, carrying the full three-hundred-year accumulation of the Golden Tang Gate, is sinking into the mountain. It's enough to transform this entire place into a treasure land of Primordial Magnetism... The earth veins and spiritual essence of all Jiangbei will be irrevocably altered!'

'If this was truly for Daoist Master Qiushui's breakthrough, why would the Golden Feather Sect go to such lengths? Wouldn't this new environment be detrimental to them? They'd be asking for trouble!'

He quickly understood Ning Wan's confusion and doubt. "If... this *isn't* the Golden Feather Sect's doing," he reasoned, "then... why hasn't a single Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect appeared to stop it?"

The golden qi to the north began to sink *en masse*. The earlier descent of silken threads connecting sky and earth transformed. It was as if a hole had been torn in the white expanse above. The qi began to cascade down like a torrential waterfall, all of it burrowing deep into the earth veins.

Even from such a distance, Li Ximing could sense a new power flashing within the mountains—an intermingling of dark-iron black and flashing silver. A strange, new aura began to rise. The very ground beneath their feet thrummed, and they could feel the metal and stone of the earth itself trembling.

"This is the power of Primordial Magnetism..."

The instant this new aura arose, the entire sheet of golden qi still floating in the sky shattered. As if seized by an irresistible pull, it collapsed all at once, bathing the entirety of Tangdao Mountain in a blinding, brilliant white.

Ning Wan still saw no sign of any cultivator from the Golden Feather Sect. But beside her, dark qi coalesced, and Daoist Master Kui Qi descended on a divine ability, his black robes stark against the light. His expression was grim. "It's useless now, even if Qiushui herself were to come," he stated. "Unless a True Monarch intervenes, no one can touch this place."

After speaking, his gaze drifted down to the mountain range shrouded in white qi. "It matters little that the Golden Tang Gate is gone," he said. "But what Situ Tang acquired back then was the Daoist tradition of the ancient Heavenly Beard Gate. That cannot be lost. Even though the Buddhist cultivators have the jade slips, and it won't be difficult for them to open... it's unlikely to remain a secret. Still, it must be retrieved."

With Kui Qi's appearance, the colorful lights to the north finally stirred. A stream of illusory radiance detached itself and descended, condensing nearby into a golden body.

This golden body possessed six arms and four feet, and its head had three faces. One was snarling, another was weeping in sorrow, and all were adorned with wondrous patterns. Four of its arms brandished a staff, a club, a saber, and a sword, while the remaining two hands were pressed together at its chest. Its voice was benevolent. "Nuzi greets the three fellow Daoists!"

Li Ximing frowned inwardly, but Kui Qi was already sneering. "You old fossil. After dawdling for so many years, the Way of Great Desire finally found a seat for you? We just saw Vija, and now you've shown up... The Way of Great Desire and the Way of Emptiness... you two have certainly gotten cozy these past few years."

'The Way of Great Desire again...'

When Li Ximing and Kui Qi had rescued Ning Wan, they had clashed with Zhelu and Taixi of the Way of Emptiness. That faction had wanted him dead, and it was Vija of the Way of Great Desire who had interfered and stirred up the situation. Now, this Nuzi had appeared. This was the context for Kui Qi's remark.

This Nuzi was clearly a Maha who had risen through the ranks during the North-South conflict. Though from the same generation as Taixi, he looked far older, as if he had been waiting for this promotion for many years. He showed no anger at the jibe, merely replying calmly, "I have only lived a few more years and was fortunate enough to be promoted. I now cultivate under Lord Vija. He heard I have had significant contact with the southern cultivators, so he dispatched me."

"Our two paths, the Way of Great Desire and the Way of Emptiness, act under the command of the Dharma Master to exterminate the blood-refining, flesh-eating Golden Tang Demon Gate. Do the esteemed Daoist Masters have any instructions for us?"

He spoke with righteous conviction, striking the pose of an orthodox cultivator, bearing no trace of the insidious manner usually associated with the Ways of Emptiness and Great Desire. Li Ximing knew Kui Qi wouldn't tolerate this. Sure enough, the black-robed Daoist Master's expression turned even colder. "Utterly shameless. When Situ Tang was at the height of his power, you didn't say a single word. Now that the Golden Tang Gate is reduced to just a few survivors, you raise a commotion that fills the sky with golden qi and scourges the land with this dew, needlessly wounding the climate, and you have the gall to call it 'demon extermination'."

Nuzi pressed his palms together. "In any case, we are eliminating a scourge for the people."

Although Ning Wan still harbored deep resentment for the two paths, she hesitated, seeing that a battle was imminent.

This affair damaged the Golden Feather Sect's interests. If Golden Feather had been willing to take the lead, Ning Wan and her allies would have gladly lent their strength. But Golden Feather remained silent, and no one knew what secret bargain had been struck. Without their lead, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had no legitimate reason to intervene...

Ning Wan had no choice but to speak, her voice cold. "Our 'Lord' has already gone to the north, yet your Buddhist Path still finds the energy to come south and stir up chaos... Regardless of its actions, the Golden Tang Gate was once a part of the Immortal Dao's Daoist tradition. What gives you the right to annihilate it without a word?"

"It was, at least, an immortal sect's Daoist tradition. Situ Tang held the legacy of an ancient cultivator. That legacy cannot be allowed to be lost to the outside world."

To her surprise, Nuzi laughed aloud. "We have already taken that into consideration for the Immortal Dao!"

He waved his sleeve. From the north, led by a being with the title of Merciful One, a group of Master Monks flew over on rainbow light. They used their dharma power to levitate clusters of near-naked, shivering men and women, who clutched infants in their hands and under their arms.

As they drew near, the leading Merciful One—burly and broad-shouldered, clad in shining golden armor—was revealed. His face was sternly handsome, but his four eyes were savage. He bowed. "Reporting, my lord! The entire Situ Clan has been brought!"

Li Ximing looked down. He saw a crowd of Situ family members, their cultivation levels varying, though most were mere mortals. As they drew close and saw the three Daoist Masters, a desperate hope flared in their eyes. They burst into tears, wailing and begging for mercy, kneeling on the rainbow light to kowtow frantically.

Ning Wan sighed, deeply unsettled. Kui Qi, however, frowned heavily, his anger barely concealed. Whatever their crimes, the Situ family were descendants of a Purple Mansion Realm expert. To be captured was one thing, but to be stripped and humiliated like livestock... If not for the fact that the Situ family had been rotten for generations, Kui Qi likely would have exploded in rage.

Nuzi raised his sleeve again. The cuff billowed, expanding instantly, and poured out a cascade of items. Jade slips and dharma artifacts, large and small, tumbled out, forming a small mountain before the captives. The Maha Nuzi chuckled. "We didn't take much. It's all here, handed over to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition!"

His expression turned serious. "This is, after all, a command from the Dharma Master. We cannot afford any mistakes. We sincerely hope the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition will not interfere. If a conflict arises over this matter, we *will not* be able to retreat."

In truth, even with their True Monarch gone north, it would be incredibly difficult for the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition to cross the river and wage war on this mountain, especially against the Buddhist cultivators allied with the Ways of Great Desire and Emptiness. Unless Lou Xing of Xiukui personally intervened, they would never make such an impulsive move.

Yet the Buddhist cultivators still delivered the Daoist tradition and the captives. This showed just how desperate they were to avoid any mistakes, and how resolute their decision was to hold Tangdao Mountain...

'The Dharma Master's will? Is this move targeted at the Golden Feather Sect?'

Kui Qi did not reply. He simply raised two fingers to his lips and blew softly. A grey wind descended from the heavens, passing over the heads of the Situ family cultivators. As it passed, it transformed into pure black Daoist robes, which settled upon their naked bodies, covering them.

Seeing that the three were ignoring him, Nuzi tactfully waved his hand. The surrounding Master Monks, led by the Merciful One, rose on the wind, and the entire group, including Nuzi, dissolved into rainbow light and retreated to the north.

Li Ximing descended slightly on his divine ability. He guessed that any of the Situ Clan below who'd had any backbone were already dead. The survivors seemed to compete in their terror of him, kowtowing endlessly. Some even dragged the robes from their women and pushed them forward, crying, "Daoist Master... Daoist Master, spare our lives!"

"It was all Situ Mo's doing in the past! It has nothing to do with us!"

Li Ximing watched in silence, an indescribable feeling rising within him. 'The Situ family of old... the Situ family where a single direct descendant, merely passing over a lake, could wipe out ten thousand others... has been reduced to this.'

He stood there, motionless. A Situ family woman with a fair, tear-streaked face crawled before him, kowtowing. She reached out, wanting to grasp the hem of his robe as if it were a lifeline, but her hand froze halfway, suspended uselessly in the air by her terror.

The fleeting moment was lost. She was instantly dragged backward by her own kinsmen, kicked aside, and replaced by another person who scrambled to the front, weeping and kowtowing.

"Zhaojing?"

Ning Wan's gentle voice broke his reverie. Li Ximing looked up, shaking his head with a strained laugh, as if brushing his thoughts aside. "This group of Situ family clansmen... what should be done with them?"

Kui Qi descended on his divine ability, his gaze sweeping over the captives. "The Situ family's elite were few to begin with," he said softly. "Now, they've either been slaughtered or 'welcomed' into the Buddhist Land. The ones left here are mostly from branch families or are of illegitimate birth. Even if there's a direct descendant or two among them, they're clearly not the valued ones. Zhaojing, do you have any thoughts?"

Situ Mo and the Li Clan had a deep feud. As a cultivator from the Great Xiukui Monastery, Kui Qi clearly didn't want to see Li Ximing slaughter them all; his tactful words were a rare occurrence. Li Ximing sighed. "I don't have any strong feelings. Those monks from the north are treacherous. If any of these people truly mattered to my family's grudge, the monks would never have let them go—they'd already be in the Buddhist Land. They were sent here deliberately, hoping I *would* slaughter them all. It would give them the perfect karmic pretext to 'enlighten' the Situ family members they *did* keep."

"Correct."

Ning Wan smiled and produced a jade slip from her sleeve, handing it to Li Ximing. "This contains the Situ family's secret methods for bypassing restrictions. It should open most of them. I heard Situ Mo made some secret modifications in the last two years, but the core members of his direct line likely know the new methods."

Ning Wan was clearly giving this to Li Ximing because he held Situ Ku. The old man had been a prisoner of the Li Clan for years, and having him under control now proved to be a great convenience.

Li Ximing nodded. "Once I have sorted through these techniques, I will send a copy to both your families."

Kui Qi raised his sleeve and, with a wave, neatly divided both the people and the pile of items into three equal portions. He collected one portion. "My Lord has already gone north," he said softly. "There isn't much time left. The various sects should begin placing their pieces for the game ahead. As long as those... specific individuals... are not harmed, nothing else is a major concern."

Li Ximing nodded. He hesitated briefly before asking, "I wish to refine an 'Upper Shaman' spirit embryo. I was wondering if Senior could offer me some guidance..."

He was not underestimating the connections of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and Kui Qi, in turn, did not seem surprised. He waved his hand calmly. "If Zhaojing is sincere, you may come to Tiger's Frontier for a visit... after my Lord has departed."

With that, he rode the wind, dissolving into a grey gust and departing.

Once he was gone, Ning Wan's expression turned grave. She turned to Li Ximing. "Zhaojing, did you happen to notice that 'Four-Eyed Merciful One' beside Nuzi?"

Li Ximing was slightly surprised. "I glanced at him."

Ning Wan's expression was serious. "That man is named Bashan. My family has known of him for some time. An elder told me that back when Nuzi was still just a Merciful One, this Bashan was an Arhat under his command. He was born with divine strength and incredible talent, so he was promoted rapidly. Now that Nuzi has attained the rank of Maha, Bashan has taken his old place as a Merciful One!"

Her voice lowered. "He must not be underestimated. His divine strength is likely on par with Xuanfeng's. In terms of future prospects, Nuzi might not even be his equal. Years ago, Nuzi even tried to make a move on Xuanfeng, hoping to gather a 'pair' of them. He only gave up because the Great Ning Palace suddenly made contact with Anhuai, and the Metallic Essence was revealed..."

Li Ximing frowned and nodded. Ning Wan continued, her voice fraught with worry, "The Golden Feather Sect is sitting idle... and Jiangbei is beyond our reach. The North-South conflict has already destroyed most of the networks we'd pushed north. Now, with the loss of the critical point at Golden Tang, the Buddhist cultivators can bypass our eastern flank. This is not a good development, no matter how you look at it."

Li Ximing sighed internally. "I know you still have Situ Ku," Ning Wan continued. "There aren't many direct descendants of the Situ family left, but their enemies are numerous. As for Situ Huo, who is still at large... many people consider him a thorn in their side."

She added frankly, "That includes me. That's why I hope you'll keep this man. When this business in the north is finally over, and the opportunity arises... we can use his bloodline to divine Situ Huo's location. Getting rid of him would be for the best."

Li Ximing nodded and parted ways with her. Behind him, the Situ family members, still suspended by the Heavenly Light, could only huddle together, weeping silently as they watched Li Ximing descend on his light toward the lake below.

More than a year had passed, and the construction within the great formation was complete. Most of the new structures were built around the massive, profound pillars, with various cultivation pavilions spiraling upward, nestled between them.

He scanned the area and landed on a platform. In the center stood the Wanling Flower Tree, its canopy spreading like a lush parasol, adorned with blooming red flowers. The area was heavily guarded. White Ape was resting beneath the tree.

Upon seeing Li Ximing, White Ape rose to bow. Li Ximing set his group of captives down and offered a greeting. Then, his spiritual sense swept out, searching for his subordinates.

Soon, Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan arrived in the courtyard, one after the other, both bowing in greeting. Li Ximing's expression was grave. "Go and bring Situ Ku here," he commanded.

Li Jiangqian immediately dispatched someone. A moment later, Ding Weizeng, clad in crimson armor, appeared, hauling an old man with him. Ding Weizeng's gaze was fervent as he bowed before the hall.

Ding Weizeng had once been a cultivator under the Golden Tang Gate's jurisdiction and had some history with this old man. It seemed he was here to see him off. Li Ximing nodded at him, signaling for him to remain, before turning his gaze to the old man on the ground.

Situ Ku had actually been treated decently by the Li family all these years. Though his cultivation was sealed, he had been well-fed and cared for in the dungeons. The moment he looked up and saw Li Ximing, he trembled violently. "Greetings, Daoist Master!" he stammered.

Li Ximing stated casually, "The Golden Tang Gate was annihilated by the Buddhist cultivators. The Situ family is wiped out. Only a few branch families are left. I brought a batch of them back."

Situ Ku stared blankly for a second, then tears streamed down his face. He kowtowed. "I... I will do whatever the Daoist Master commands!"

The Li family had kept him alive this long precisely because he was so pliable. Li Ximing wasn't surprised by the reaction. With a light wave of his sleeve, rows of jade slips—the ones from Nuzi—appeared neatly stacked to one side. Li Ximing pointed. "Unlock them."

Situ Ku opened his mouth, then hesitated. Li Ximing tossed Ning Wan's jade slip in front of him. The old man scrambled to pick it up. Li Ximing turned his head to Ding Weizeng, a smile touching his lips. "Your cultivation has advanced quickly."

"It is all thanks to the Daoist Master's blessing!" Ding Weizeng bowed his head respectfully. "This lowly one also had a child a few years ago. A girl. We named her Ding Yujing..."

"Good." Li Ximing turned back. "Is there one named Ding Mu, still cultivating at Purple Smoke?"

Li Jiangqian quickly interjected, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, yes. The family has supplied him with cultivation resources all these years. He brought his mother back for a visit a few years ago. He was very cordial and expressed his gratitude repeatedly..."

Li Ximing nodded, satisfied. From the other side, Li Que'wan approached, holding a pale golden jade slip. She bowed. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, this is the Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra."

Of all the legacies of the Golden Tang Gate, this was unquestionably the most precious. Situ Tang's line producing three Purple Mansion Realm experts was certainly related to talent, but the Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra had played no small part!

Li Ximing held it up and scanned its contents.

The technique was indeed impressive. As the foundational text of the Golden Tang Gate, it was a fifth-grade sutra containing two secret methods. Successful cultivation led to the 'Engraved Stone', which was known in ancient times as the 'Golden Beast Plume'. The sutra itself claimed to be the Heavenly Beard Daoist tradition, founded by a Daoist Master Tianxu, a cultivator from the Xu State

The sutra mentioned little else of its origins. The only other notable part was a warning at the very end, reminding cultivators to be "cautious with one's edge." However, some later cultivator had added an annotation:
'The Engraved Stone is about perseverance, about being sharp and without regret. It is like the Gleaming Gold Feather-Beast: it can only ascend, never descend. To descend is to fall to earth, to be trapped and killed by the Baleful Earth. If one's cultivation stagnates, how is that any different from being trapped and killed by the Baleful Earth?'

'To annotate a Purple Mansion-level sutra with such arrogance... that must have been Situ Tang himself,' Li Ximing thought, shaking his head. 'He only cared about cultivating his divine abilities, doing as he pleased without restraint. He never cared what happened to the Golden Tang Gate.'

Although the sutra was precious, the Si family, the Ning family, and Golden Feather almost certainly had copies already. It would be a good addition for the clan's juniors. Li Ximing stored it away and began inspecting the other techniques. He looked down on most of them, simply adding them to the family's repository.

Only one, the *Sublime Method of the Vast Profound Magnetic Light*, was unique. Though only a third-grade technique, it was a cultivation method of the Primordial Lightning path, designed to establish the 'Baleful Lord's Rite' as one's Immortal Foundation.

Li Ximing gave it a second look before storing it. He then commanded, "The Golden Tang Gate is gone... Que'Wan, divine if any of these captives are from the direct Purple Mansion Realm bloodline."

Li Que'wan nodded. She took a drop of Situ Ku's blood and began forming hand seals around a jade token. Li Ximing turned to Li Jiangqian. "What are your plans for them?"

'It would have been cleaner if they had all died at the hands of the Buddhist cultivators,' Li Jiangqian thought. He had little desire to deal with the Situ family survivors, but their bloodlines were admittedly decent. He replied, "If this junior is to handle it, they will be absorbed into the Seven Clans of Xizhang. Their family names will be changed, severing their past ties. From that point on, they will have no relation to the Situ name."

Li Ximing glanced at Situ Ku, who was trembling at his feet, and then at the somber-faced Ding Weizeng. With a light flick of his finger, a spark of divine ability flew into the old man's brow, sealing his Shengyang Acupoint. "As for you, Situ Ku," Li Ximing commanded, "if I release you, you'll just be captured by the monks and used as cultivation fodder. Out of consideration for Weizeng, you will remain by his side and perform odd jobs. Patrol the shores. That will be your contribution."



# Chapter 885: The Situation is Set

When Ding Weizeng heard this, his eyes immediately reddened. He dropped to his knees, his voice thick with emotion.

"Weizeng kowtows in thanks, Daoist Master! Years ago, the Ding family cultivated under the rule of the Golden Tang Gate. Situ Chen was a tyrant who persecuted us relentlessly. We only managed to survive because Senior Situ Ku navigated the situation for us... While my parents were alive, they constantly reminded me... I must never forget this debt of gratitude."

"He... he just failed to grasp the situation and opposed those on the lake. In the end, he was captured by Your Excellency. All Weizeng could do was offer him aid in secret... Daoist Master, you have allowed my Ding family to fulfill its obligation... I don't know how I can ever repay this kindness!"

The old man, Situ Ku, kowtowed alongside him, his back drenched in a cold sweat. In truth, this 'navigating the situation' had been the Ding family bribing him with extravagant gifts. Back then, plenty of families had tried to buy his favor, and the Dings hadn't even offered the most. But they had been the most reliable and obedient, which was why he'd chosen to protect them.

Of course, none of this could be said aloud. Situ Ku just mumbled his thanks obsequiously. However, the main reason Li Ximing had spared him was Ning Wan. He spoke:

"Enough. Consider his life spared by his own good fortune. The Situ family has no shortage of enemies. You keep a close eye on him."

Ding Weizeng nodded respectfully, rising to his feet and helping the old man away. Situ Ku clearly hadn't imagined he would be allowed to live after so many years as a captive of the Li family. Overcome with joy, he wept as he was led away.

Li Ximing turned to Li Que'wan, who was just putting away a talisman. She reported:

"Daoist Master, there are no direct descendants of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators here. I found only one or two female relatives with close blood ties... The men were likely either taken away or slaughtered."

"Handle the arrangements."

Li Ximing gave the order casually to Li Jiangqian. The Li Family Head nodded and added a reminder:

"It's just... This junior fears the collection of cultivation methods here is incomplete. The Golden Tang Gate was famous for techniques... far beyond just the *Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra*."

"Mm..."

Li Ximing nodded, his gaze resting on the pile of jade slips. There were many techniques, but the quality was wildly inconsistent.

"At the very least, the 'Smoldering Shadow Qi' is missing. If not world-famous, that technique was at least infamous. After all, Situ Tang didn't just acquire the Tianxu Daoist tradition; he also visited the Mirrored-Mirrage Grotto Heaven. Either those monks didn't hand everything over, or the last gate master of the Golden Tang Gate, Situ Mo, tampered with the collection and moved the valuable texts elsewhere."

Li Jiangqian bowed and said:

"Since it belongs to the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition, it stands to reason that the Golden Feather Sect took it beforehand. They were likely afraid it would seem unjustifiable to take *everything*, so they at least left the Tianxu Daoist tradition behind."

Li Ximing had seen the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition that Changxiao possessed. It was on a completely different level, leaving both his family's arts and those of the Buddhist cultivators in the dust. While the power of a Dharma Art ultimately depends on the user and their cultivation base, a superior technique is not to be underestimated.

"As for the dharma artifacts..."

The Golden Tang Gate had left behind a considerable number of dharma artifacts and pills. But for a sect in such decline, their pills couldn't possibly compare to those of the Li family, who boasted a Purple Mansion Realm alchemist. Thankfully, the pile of dharma artifacts was large, and most were still imbued with dharma power. It was impractical to have the others refine them one by one. Li Ximing simply flicked his finger. A streak of Bright Yang light swept over the collection, instantly refining every dharma artifact on the ground in a single pass.

"Merely average."

It was impossible to know if the Golden Tang Gate's truly powerful dharma artifacts had already been looted, or if Situ Tang and his "filial" descendants had sold them all off. Li Ximing's standards were high, and he couldn't help but frown at the selection. Fortunately, there was an abundance of feathered robes. The two best—a pair of Foundation Establishment Realm-level Metal Virtue robes—were of no use to Li Jiangqian or Li Minggong. Li Ximing gave one to Li Que'wan and had the other sent to the clan's treasury, to be awarded later based on merit.

Li Jiangqian rummaged through the items with some interest and managed to find a single fire token. A closer look revealed it was for 'Merging Fire'. While this Daoist tradition was disdained by most, it was undeniably useful in combat. He commented:

"The Golden Tang Gate specialized solely in Metal Virtue and didn't dabble in other paths. Any of these miscellaneous techniques were likely stolen. That 'Smoldering Shadow Qi' you mentioned also has a trace of Merging Fire's aura. It must have been stolen from some Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition."

"The Golden Feather Sect is a True Monarch Daoist tradition of Metal Virtue, yet they also cultivate 'Dawn Qi', Fire Virtue, and Ancient Merging. Who walks only a single path!"

At the mention of the Golden Feather Sect, Li Ximing's expression grew complicated.

"This current situation..."

Although the Buddhist cultivators claimed to occupy the north, they only had a few Dharma Masters. They were always deferential when facing Mount Luoxia. This business with the Golden Feather Sect... even if Mount Luoxia didn't order it, they were certainly informed. And Luoxia's silence was, without a doubt, tacit approval.

This incident with the True Monarch revealed that the Golden Feather Daoist tradition is, in fact, subordinate to Mount Luoxia. Possessing a True Monarch merely granted them a degree of autonomy. But now, with this affair involving the monks, it was clear the relationship between Luoxia and Golden Feather wasn't one of perfect harmony from the top down...

'This is an awkward business. Everyone tacitly agrees this is an internal entanglement of the Luoxia faction. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition has no grounds to interfere. After all, even in their usual skirmishes with the Buddhist cultivators, neither side dares to invoke Mount Luoxia's name... The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition may be noble, but this is no longer the era of the Six Scions of Green Pine.'

He felt the great pressure of his family's 'Wei-Li' title, a burden he couldn't seem to shed. As he sat silently, a bright light suddenly flared in the sky, causing him to raise an eyebrow.

Li Que'wan sensed it first. After a moment's judgment, she smiled.

"Jiangxia is out of seclusion!"

Li Ximing turned, glanced at the bright light in the sky, and nodded.

"Tell Li Jianglong... have them all come. I recall you have two younger brothers. One cultivates 'Li Fire'... and the other 'Jade True'. How are they doing these days?"

Li Jiangqian sent someone to fetch them and reported:

"Fourth Brother, Jiangliang, has grown into a dashing young man, but he's restless by nature... He's more or less mastered the Dharma Arts Protector Cui taught him. When I told him to start learning a trade, he refused. Now we barely see him. He's forbidden from going north, so he just wanders south. Sometimes he escorts spiritual goods from the lakeside market to the various markets around Azure Pond... He'll disappear for three or five days at a time."

He sighed heavily, looking guilty.

"Fifth Brother, Jiangnian, is the complete opposite. He holes up in his immortal's cave year after year and never comes out. If you ask, the answer is always the same: he's in seclusion and cannot be disturbed... It's my failing as their older brother. I haven't been able to teach them to settle their minds."

Li Ximing shook his head as he listened.

"Cultivation and practical experience are both good things. We didn't have the luxury for it before. Now that Azure Pond is relatively safe, it's good for him to get out and move around."

Beside them, Li Que'wan added with a hint of regret:

"It's just that our two brothers, Li Jianglong and Jiangxia, have never really gotten along, even as children. Thankfully, neither of them lets it interfere with important matters. But... you'll never see them act particularly close."

Li Ximing wasn't particularly concerned. He was, after all, in the Purple Mansion Realm, and his perspective on such things was vastly different from those at the Foundation Establishment Realm. He said softly:

"It doesn't matter if they don't get along. The family is large and its interests are vast. You can't expect perfect harmony everywhere."

Li Jiangqian cupped his hands in acknowledgment. Just then, the Bright Yang light in the sky flared, and a man descended from it.

The man was tall and clad in armor, holding a short spear in each hand. He had long eyebrows and striking golden eyes, and his entire bearing radiated a bold, cheerful energy. He landed in the courtyard with a rush, scanned the area, and immediately bowed.

"Jiangxia pays respects to the Daoist Master!"

He was tall, not quite as large as Ding Weizeng, but comparable to Li Wen. Li Ximing's eyes lit up, and he gave a slight nod. Just then, an attendant announced another arrival. A man in a feathered robe entered, wearing a jade crown and a sword at his waist. His features were less striking than Jiangxia's. He first bowed to Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan before finally bowing to Li Ximing.

Seeing the two emerge from seclusion one after the other, Li Ximing smiled.

"Now we have people to put to use."

He then turned to Li Jiangqian.

"You've been stalled at the early Foundation Establishment Realm for long enough. It's perfect timing. Your two brothers are out, and I am also out of seclusion to oversee things. Set aside your current duties and go focus on your breakthrough. The family's affairs can be left to Li Jianglong and Jiangxia for the time being."

Li Jiangqian seemed to have anticipated this. He reported:

"I will obey the Daoist Master's command."

He turned back to his brothers and smiled.

"Then I'll have to trouble you two."

Jiangxia stepped forward, his voice resonant and powerful as he voiced his assent. Li Jianglong was far more reserved, merely offering a bow. Seeing Li Jiangqian's ready acceptance, Li Ximing added one more instruction:

"Jiangxia spends his years on the eastern shore; he's more familiar with it. Have him oversee that area. The affairs here on the Island will be left to Li Jianglong."

Neither man showed any change in expression, bowing in thanks. Li Ximing proceeded to test their cultivation, finding both of their foundations to be very solid. Li Jiangqian then spoke quietly:

"Since both my brothers are here, I have some news to report."

Li Jiangqian retrieved a letter from his sleeve, his expression growing somewhat grim.

"Daoist Master, please look at this!"

Li Ximing took the letter. It was from Wang Quwan, written in his own hand.

"Wang Quwan..."

Li Ximing vaguely recalled what Wang Quwan looked like all those years ago. He was a famous cultivator in Jiangbei now. Unfolding the letter, he saw the tone was as respectful as ever.

In it, Wang Quwan inquired after the well-being of the lake territories and mentioned a certain woman.

'Wang Xiaoxiao of the Jiangbei Wang family.'

Li Jiangqian waited for him to finish reading before speaking, choosing his words carefully.

"This Wang Xiaoxiao is, as suspected, a very close blood relative of Wang Quwan. Furthermore, from what I've gathered, not only is she one of the Great One's people, but she even brought the Great One to meet Wang Quwan personally."

"Oh?"

"The Great One gave Wang Quwan several dharma artifacts as a betrothal gift for Wang Xiaoxiao, and he accepted all of them. What's more, this happened quite some time ago. We don't know the exact date, but the letter states, 'We have been in contact for many years, but out of awe, I dared not speak of it, much less send word to the lake.' This has clearly been going on for a long time."

Li Ximing's expression became unreadable, showing neither pleasure nor anger. He gave a noncommittal grunt and passed the letter to the two men beside him. As they read it, Li Jianglong frowned, and Jiangxia's face paled. Li Jiangqian continued:

"That's the first point. Second, when the True Monarch departed, someone—we don't know who—suggested he designate territory for the Wang family. They were given land bordering the north. This was *after* the True Monarch nearly eradicated Wang He's faction... Finally, the letter's most crucial claim: a member of the Wang family apparently accompanied the True Monarch across the river and into the north. We cannot confirm if this is true."

Li Jiangqian's intelligence network was certainly not as fast as Ning Wan's. Li Ximing himself had only just learned of the True Monarch's departure from her. Yet, by the time he reached the shore, Li Jiangqian already knew. That was remarkably fast. It meant Wang Quwan must have sent this letter the very instant Lin Feng left.

He casually put the letter away and asked:

"Who delivered it? Did they leave a message?"

Li Jiangqian replied respectfully:

"It was Wang Quyu. He's already at the Foundation Establishment Realm. He delivered it to the shore and left immediately."

Li Ximing sat down in the courtyard. He didn't say much, simply replying:

"The Great One is gone. Send a reply. Tell him our family is interested in those Dharma swords. Wang Xiaoxiao has likely seen them. Have him send over diagrams of every sword."

Li Jiangqian nodded repeatedly but still offered a respectful reminder:

"Yes... But about Wang Quwan. I fear we must make preparations."

Li Ximing knew this, of course. Li Jiangqian had likely been wary of Wang Quwan for a long time. With a placid expression, he asked:

"What are your thoughts?"

Jiangxia looked displeased. He had the most straightforward personality among the brothers, but also the most domineering. He hated hearing anything that went against his grain. He answered in a cold voice:

"This junior has never met Wang Quwan, but I've heard Lord Ding speak of him with high praise. From the sound of it, he has no intention of remaining on the lake. He's the type who only bows on the surface. We must guard against him."

Li Jianglong's expression was somber. He agreed without hesitation, his voice low:

"Third Brother is right. Wang Quwan has never held any true loyalty to our family. He was merely cautious and discreet, forced by circumstances to lower his head. He is not the sort of man to willingly serve under another; we have never underestimated him in that regard. However, he also values his reputation. The Daoist Master did him a great service. And while the Jiangbei Wang family is beyond our reach, he will still defer to us. Sooner or later, he will have to return to the lake."

"But who knows what benefits he received? The benefits the Great One gave him... even if he does return, it might not be a good thing for our family in the long run."

"In this junior's opinion, a man like that will never truly submit. Even if he returns, we can only suppress or appease him because he is at the Foundation Establishment Realm. If he ever breaks through to the Purple Mansion Realm, he will become a disaster. Why bother? We would just be acting as his shield. It's like cutting off our own flesh to feed an eagle—letting him shelter under our roof only until the day he's strong enough to soar away."

Li Jiangqian glanced at his two brothers. His expression remained respectful, his tone even, as he spoke:

"Exactly. The Jiangbei Wang family has been fractured for years; it's a quagmire. But he cares deeply for his kinsmen. It is better to leave him in Jiangbei. Let him remain with the Jiangbei Wang family, forced to struggle against his circumstances, fending off attacks, scrambling to curry favor between Capital immortals and the Chengyun Gate. Let the hostile environment wear down his fortune and drain his energy. Let his clan be chaotic and disunited. Let him toss and turn day and night, unable to cultivate in peace."

"All the while, the debt he owes our family will hang over his head. How can he erase that? Even if, by some miracle, a phoenix rises from the ashes and he reaches the Purple Mansion Realm in that desolate land, he will still have to respectfully call you 'Senior' when he sees you, Daoist Master. Is that not far better than him cultivating to the Purple Mansion Realm *within* our family, only for us to be forced into a bitter separation, where the bonds of blood and gratitude are twisted into accusations of betrayal?"

"And besides, there is Wang Xiaoxiao. She is also extraordinary. How can we underestimate her?"

He smiled.

"If Wang Quwan joins our family, he has the entire Jiangbei Wang family behind him, looking to him as their pillar, proud of him. But if he tries to establish his *own* clan in Jiangbei, he will be forced to unify the fractured Jiangbei Wang family. That is a completely different matter. He might just end up being hated by everyone."

Li Ximing remained silent, his gaze fixed on the Wanling Flower Tree in the east. His eyes seemed to drift, wandering along the distant horizon.

Li Que'wan stood behind Li Ximing, a chill creeping into her heart as she listened to their discussion. Her almond-shaped eyes flickered up, following Li Ximing's gaze for an instant before she lowered her head just as quickly. She heard the Daoist Master in front of her finally speak:

"The situation is already set. When the Great One returns to his mountain, I have other arrangements. I must retrieve the Dharma swords first, which means I cannot go to retrieve Wang Xiaoxiao. That woman will inevitably fall into someone else's hands. Do not think on it further."



# Chapter 886: Forged

Li Ximing made his decision. The three cultivators before him nodded in agreement. He passed medicinal pills to Li Jiangqian, then gestured for Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia to choose their dharma artifacts.

The dharma artifacts from the Golden Tang Gate, both Dui Metal and Geng Metal types, were laid out. At the very least, these Metal Virtue items wouldn't conflict with their Bright Yang cultivation. Li Jianglong selected a golden ring, accepting it with a word of thanks. Li Jiangxia, however, showed no such courtesy. He hefted one weapon after another, weighing them, before finally picking out two golden spears of nearly identical shape and weight.

"You are all dismissed. Que'Wan, stay behind."

Li Ximing waved his sleeve. The three brothers departed, while Li Que'wan walked from behind him to stand nervously at the front.

"Sit."

Li Ximing's voice was soft. "There was something I couldn't say in front of Jiangqian just now. Wang Quwan is under our clan's protection. If he succeeds in reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, it will be impossible to hide many of the clan's secrets from him. As for sending him to Jiangbei, that is a matter of his own destiny."

"It's just... his brothers. I must trouble you to help smooth relations between them."

Li Que'wan replied quickly, "The young masters all understand the greater good. Their insight and experience are far beyond my own... I should be the one learning from them."

Li Ximing’s expression turned serious. "Jiangliang and Jiangnian. What is your assessment of those two?"

Li Que'wan hesitated for a moment before answering. "Jiangliang was taught by Senior Jueyin and is quite intelligent, but his heart has long been set on leaving. From what I've seen, he's already made friends in the outside world. His mind truly isn't on the lake. As for Jiangnian... I've only met him a few times, but his temperament is kind and gentle, not at all like his brothers."

"Forget it..." Li Ximing shook his head. "The Li family has no shortage of daughters, yet none have emerged with the character of my aunt. Minggong is obedient but lacks resolve and courage. The moment Chenghui fell all those years ago, I knew we were in for trouble."

"As for the Zhouxing generation, the Old Master discussed them with me. Zhouming is incompetent. Zhouluo has the Yang family backing him and feels little attachment to the lake; our family has never been one to force anyone. Zhouda is still in seclusion, and his success is uncertain. Xinghan has talent, but her parents are minor figures in the clan. They lack the knowledge to guide her and will only hold her back. Besides, her own temperament is nothing to boast about."

Li Ximing sighed. "It is often said that the North-South conflict broke the spine of the great clans. Those words are true. Our family is considered one of the fortunate ones, yet we still suffer the consequences of that era. Aren't those two from Purple Smoke in the same predicament?"

He let out another breath. "And as for Jiangqian's brothers, they all have their own ambitions—far too many ambitions. It's only manageable because Zhouwei and I are here to keep them in check. And what about the outside? In the North and the South, there are countless eyes fixed squarely upon them!"

As Li Ximing finished his lament, his thoughts drifted to the matter of shaking Great Ancestor Wei, Li Qianyuan's, Fruition Attainment. His mood darkened.

"Take this copy of the Sublime Method of the Vast Profound Magnetic Light," he instructed. "Study it well. Understand your enemy. We will not dwell on these other matters any longer. Shichuan is nearly forged, and the Great One still has more than a year."

He said no more, stepping into the Great Void and traversing space to arrive at Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

'Just over a year...'

Li Ximing calculated on his fingers. A year wasn't nearly enough time for any significant cultivation. He could practice the six cycles of Embyronic Breathing, but at most, he would only absorb a single stream of qi for his second divine ability.

'But Bai Yinzi's location is a problem,' he mused. 'It's on the other side of the river, and the Buddhist cultivators will likely interfere. If a fight breaks out and I'm badly injured, this entire year of cultivation will have been for nothing.'

Just as he thought this, another realization struck him. 'If that happens... I'll also end up wasting a strand of Xuanguan Crimson Fire Qi. Then I'll be forced to make a trip to the Cui clan's Chongzhou Island.'

Considering this, Li Ximing changed his mind. 'This year is perfect for practicing spell arts. It might seem like I'm sharpening my spear at the last minute, but it's the right choice. With Jiangqian in seclusion for his breakthrough, the family is short on defenders anyway...'

He sat in quiet contemplation.

Spell arts had always been Li Ximing's weak point. He was completely confident in his alchemy, but in combat, he lacked Li Zhouwei's skill with the halberd. His early years had been divided between practice and refinement, so it was no wonder his spell arts were lacking. Now that he had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, it was time to shore up this deficiency.

'I don't possess the kind of profound Dao attainment that can turn decay into magic. Spell arts usable at my realm must be at least fourth-rank. The absolute best spell arts in all of Jiangnan are no higher than sixth-rank. Right now, I only have a basic foundation in two: the fourth-rank Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, and the fifth-rank Sun's Resonant Parting Art.'

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was an orthodox Bright Yang technique. It resonated with the Heavenly Light between his brows, and its power was respectable. It was fine for fending off opponents, but landing a killing blow was difficult. Furthermore, pushing its power any higher was nearly impossible. The Sun's Resonant Parting Art, however, was a higher rank and the spell art he had mastered fastest. After practicing it by the sea for several years, it was finally presentable.

'But the Dharma Arts bestowed upon Jiangqian back then were far more than that. There was the fifth-rank movement technique, Tread on Flames; the fifth-rank escape art, Crimson Sun's Heavenly Parting; the sixth-rank Dharma Art, Great Parting's White Brilliance; and the fifth-rank Dharma Art, Parting Essence Wall.'

To put it bluntly, that inheritance was enough to establish a Daoist tradition on par with Crimson Reef Island. The only issue was that they were all Li Fire spell arts, making them exceptionally difficult to learn. They would have been easier if they matched his core cultivation method, but for a Bright Yang cultivator, it was bound to be troublesome.

Li Ximing had studied them before. Aside from Great Parting's White Brilliance, which required Purple Mansion Realm Li Fire, only the Sun's Resonant Parting Art had felt natural. Now, with his divine abilities perfected, he read them again. He squinted, studying them for a long time, completely torn. Finally, he selected Tread on Flames.

Compared to the other arts, Tread on Flames made the least use of 'Li Light' and didn't require profound Dao attainment. It was similar to the Sun's Resonant Parting Art in that its requirements for flame were higher. For Li Ximing, this was undoubtedly the easiest one to begin.

'When I'm wielding the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, my movements are bound to be clumsy. Audience with the Celestial Gate can strengthen my body, but it's still better to master a proper movement technique.'

He had also recently acquired a new palm strike. It wasn't based on deep Daoist theory, but it utilized Talisman Qi and its power was impressive. Tread on Flames was a fifth-rank movement technique. If he could just gain a basic mastery, it wouldn't be enough to handle Changxiao, but it would be perfect for close-combat against someone with little real Dao attainment, like the Merciful One.

He took out the two manuals and began to read.

'Li Fire resides in the heavens, a brilliant and clashing star... it presides over inauspicious conjunctions. Thus, escape arts are difficult. Only the movement art of treading on flames is suitable...'

The Sun's Resonant Parting Art and Tread on Flames sprang from the same source. Studying them together proved mutually beneficial, as each filled the gaps in the other. Aided by his Talisman Qi's ability to guide fire and manipulate energy, his progress was barely passable.

Light and shadow intertwined. Time flowed like a river. Flames surged, a crow cawed, and a rustling sound filled the air as purple embers spiraled upward.

"Ding-ling..."

A wind chime on a nearby jade pillar chimed softly, untouched by any breeze. Only then did Li Ximing awaken as if from a dream.

He felt as though he had only been pondering for a moment, manipulating flames and practicing the two Dharma Arts. Yet, someone was already ascending the mountain to report. He looked down and realized the ground was covered in a nearly three-foot-deep blanket of gardenia blossoms. A few stray sparks danced upon the petals, slowly winking out as his focus returned.

He calculated the time. More than half a year had passed.

'No wonder most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators seem so indifferent and detached... This half-year felt like less than a month. If I truly entered deep seclusion, what would I even remember of the world...'

"Come up!"

Li Ximing savored the lingering sensation of his practice, silently deepening his comprehension, as an old man climbed the steps. A red robe was draped loosely over his burly frame. It was, of course, Chu Minglian.

When he reached the top of the stairs, he stopped. Seeing the ground covered in blossoms and the pristine jade pillars, he hesitated, afraid to trample them. Li Ximing's heart leaped with joy. In an instant, he flickered through space and appeared directly in front of the old refiner.

"Congratulations, Daoist Master! The spirit embryo is complete!"

"Haha!"

Delight spread across Li Ximing's face. With a flick of his brow, the Heavenly Light shot out, wrapped around Chu Minglian, and pulled him across the Great Void. They materialized on the Viewing Pavilion Platform, where a large crowd of cultivators immediately dropped to their knees. Chu Minglian bowed deeply beside him.

"Congratulations, Daoist Master!"

The shouts from below were like a tsunami. Refining the spirit embryo had required the assistance of many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators working in rotating shifts, so the news hadn't been a secret. For a time, voices of congratulations echoed from every direction.

Li Ximing beckoned lightly. A dense, twofold radiance of azure and yellow light rose from the platform's center. The azure light was ethereal and winding; the yellow light was majestic and heavy. They swirled together, a beautiful, chaotic mix like two colors of fine sand poured into one.

"Clang!"

Luminous, azure-and-yellow patterns of mountains and rivers erupted from the Viewing Pavilion Platform. A sound like a tidal wave crashed over the assembled cultivators, sending them staggering. It was followed by the crushing pressure of the Heavenly Light, as oppressive as a cage.

Li Ximing smiled and waved his sleeve. In an instant, all the phenomena vanished, retracting into the dharma artifact as its true form was revealed.

It was a ruler. Its body was a bright yellow, shot through with flickering silver motes. Expansive, intricate patterns in the color of azure jade depicted mountains and rivers. It was over a foot long, about an inch wide, and robustly thick.

The treasure possessed an elegant grace. It seemed to have shed some of its former heft, appearing more slender and refined. It floated quietly in the lingering azure-and-yellow light, casting a tiny, palm-sized reflection of rolling hills and surging rivers beneath it, as if it were being presented on a priceless jade stand.

Li Ximing took it gently. It felt surprisingly heavy. After the refinement, Shichuan was slightly thinner but a couple of inches longer—about the width of six fingers.

'In my hand, it feels more like a thick-backed short blade.'

He couldn't help but admire his new spirit ruler. When he released his grip, the ruler obediently flipped over and fastened itself to his waist. Li Ximing scanned the crowd, their eyes all fixed on the new treasure. He smiled and commanded:

"Dismissed!"

The Heavenly Light flared, enveloping Chu Minglian and carrying him back toward Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The old man's gaze remained glued to Shichuan. As a weapons refiner, how could he not be moved when facing a spirit embryo he had played such a large part in creating? Tears of pure excitement welled in his eyes.

Li Ximing sat at a table. The gardenia blossoms on its surface dutifully scattered. He held Shichuan in his hands, infusing it with his Bright Yang divine ability.

'The tail is carved with the Yang Cusp, the head with High Radiance. It is painted with mountains and rivers, not inscribed with gods or spirits.'

Kui Qi had once mentioned that Shichuan was made from Stork River Azure Jade, a material that had long since vanished. Although Jade True had returned and jade stones were flourishing, he had heard of no one else obtaining this specific type. Jade was beautiful on its own; enhanced with Bright Yang spiritual extract, it was now utterly captivating. As his Bright Yang divine ability flowed through it, he steadily gained mastery over the artifact.

Shichuan's primary function was, fittingly, 'Reveal River'. When activated, it summoned a domain of mountain and river patterns in a radius of roughly forty-nine zhang—about the size of a large palace hall. Within this domain, he could push and entangle his enemies. The closer they were, the stronger the effect.

Its second ability was 'Monarch's Balance'. Shichuan contained a trace of discerning power. If an enemy's Dharma Art entered the domain, Shichuan could "measure" it, identifying its true power and dispelling any illusions.

The mountain and river patterns also had minor uses: following their flow as a shortcut, moving against them as a winding path, aiding cultivation, and seeing through an enemy's defenses. This power wasn't immense, and it overlapped somewhat with the abilities of the Heavenly Light between his brows, but one could never have too many wondrous abilities.

'Compared to the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, Shichuan is obviously inferior. Kui Qi was right: it has an excess of wondrous effects but a lack of true power. This isn't a primary weapon of the Imperial Clan. It's more of a ceremonial piece, meant to display their dignity, prioritizing elegance above all else.'

Although Shichuan was broadly classified as a Spiritual Artifact, it was still fundamentally a spirit embryo. He couldn't expect too much from it. The final result, however, left Li Ximing very satisfied.

'It was enhanced with a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual extract, after all. It won't be mediocre.'

He inspected it carefully, calculating on his fingers. A spirit embryo required constant nourishment from its cultivator's divine ability and mental effort. If it was separated from a Purple Mansion Realm master for too long, it would slowly lose its powers and degrade back into a mere dharma artifact.

Li Ximing had long suspected that many of the incredibly wondrous dharma artifacts from antiquity were actually degraded spirit embryos from fallen cultivators. His calculations now confirmed it. Thanks to the Purple Mansion Realm Bright Yang spiritual extract, if Shichuan were stolen and cut off from his divine ability, its power would wane, but it would take five full years to degrade completely. Even then, it would remain a dharma artifact far more wondrous than its original form.

Still, the loss would be disastrous. If he ever managed to retrieve it after that, refining it again on the Viewing Pavilion Platform would be useless. Unless he found another Bright Yang spiritual extract, even ten or twenty years of work would never restore it to its current power.

"So, the spirit embryo is complete. I borrowed connections, incurred debt, spent a priceless Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item I'd treasured for years, ran countless errands, and paid the price of standing by idly when the True Monarch came to the lake... But finally, my strength has taken another step."

This incredible leap in power in such a short time was partly due to his own luck, but also due to the intentional aid from the Supreme Yang Dao Daoist tradition, led by Kui Qi. When he thought about it, during the crisis where the Supreme Yang Dao Daoist tradition was ambushed by Buddhist cultivators and scrambling to contain the fallout in Jiangbei, he, Li Ximing, had secretly profited the most.

Shichuan could not be absorbed into his Heavenly Light like the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. He simply had to release his hand, and the spirit embryo of azure jade and bright yellow would fasten itself to his waist. Li Ximing felt a deep sense of satisfaction. He looked up at Chu Minglian.

"Senior Chu, you have worked hard these past few years. Setting aside the reward, both you and Qiuhu have done a great service for Moongaze!"

Chu Minglian had been sent by Ning Wan, so Li Ximing naturally couldn't forget Fairy Qiuhu. But Chu Minglian was even more emotional than he was, tears streaming down his face. "To have such an achievement in my lifetime is all thanks to Daoist Master seeing it through! How could I dare speak of payment!"

Li Ximing laughed heartily. They exchanged a few more pleasantries, and he was relieved to hear that Li Jiangqian had already prepared the reward. He dismissed the old refiner and sat back down, completely content, but his thoughts immediately returned to the north.

'Less than a year remains. I must continue my secluded cultivation of Dharma Arts. The fragment in the north absolutely cannot be lost. No matter who comes to claim it, no matter what injuries I suffer, no matter the cost... I *must* get my hands on it.'



# Chapter 887: Please

Shanghuo County, in the Youxiang Prefecture of the Zhao State.

Bitter winter had arrived, blanketing the world in a vast expanse of white. Youxiang Prefecture had once been under the jurisdiction of the Qinling Temple. However, the temple fell into ruin, leaving the region ungoverned for a time. Eventually, a Great Master Monk returned from the south after attaining his enlightenment and became a Merciful One, finally re-establishing the Qinling Temple.

This Merciful One, Liaokong, had peculiar beliefs. He held that intentionally seeking suffering, without also studying the scriptures, was an ineffective way to accumulate blessings for the next life. Consequently, the people of Shanghuo County no longer worked themselves to exhaustion or died from self-mutilation. Instead, they read scriptures and chanted holy names. This also meant they were spared the winter ritual of bathing in the wind and swallowing snow to prove their piety.

Of course, the number of people in Shanghuo County ascending to paradise had also decreased in recent years. The commoners dared not blame the Buddhist cultivators; they could only assume they themselves were not pious enough. If someone accidentally crushed a finger or broke a leg, they would be ecstatic, believing this unexpected suffering would surely accumulate blessings.

Into this peaceful land, streaks of colorful light suddenly split the sky. Over ten Master Monks descended, riding the wind, flanked by numerous other cultivators. Their leader shouted a stern command:

"He fled here! Find him immediately! Don't let him escape!"

The colorful lights immediately dispersed as the group of Master Monks and cultivators descended, searching everywhere. Though their robes were varied, showing they were clearly not from the same Daoist tradition, they had set aside their differences to corner their quarry.

After a short while, a brilliant golden light erupted with a tremendous roar, followed by an ear-piercing snarl:

"He really is here!"

In an instant, all the colorful lights in the sky converged on one spot. A large, shimmering array materialized out of the empty snowfield. Within it stood a long-bearded man in Jiangbei attire, clutching an array disc.

His expression was grim, his panic barely concealed as he stood rooted within the array. "How could they be so fast? Young Master Lin just entered seclusion..."

But the assembled Master Monks would not let this chance slip. They immediately surrounded the array, and their leader spat with hatred:

"Good... good! You fiend! All along your path, you destroyed mountains, felled temples, and ruined our legacies and monasteries! This is retribution! Fate has allowed us to corner you here!"

"We may not be from major sects, but we will not tolerate such humiliation! Fellow Daoists, attack together!"

Instantly, golden light flashed and white qi surged as all kinds of dharma artifacts hammered the array, creating a deafening boom. The man inside staggered, frantically pouring his dharma power into the disc. But alone, his dharma power was meager. How could he possibly resist the combined assault of more than a dozen cultivators?

'Han Li mentioned this,' the man thought, panic rising. 'This array's strength is its concealment, its ability to be deployed instantly on any terrain... It was never meant for defense!'

Despair washed over him. His name was Wang Changyan, and he hailed from the Wang Clan of Jiangbei. Years ago, his parents had traveled north to gain experience, but they had vanished without a trace.

As Wang Changyan grew, his own talent became apparent, and he was hailed as a local genius of the Wang family. This lasted until Lin Feng swept through Jiangbei. He, along with the rest of his family, had then submitted to Lin Feng's command.

When he heard Lin Feng intended to travel north, he was overjoyed. He had always wanted to search for his parents but lacked the strength to make the perilous journey alone. Now, he had seized the opportunity to follow Lin Feng, serving him faithfully.

But the journey felt cursed. They were constantly ambushed by demonic cultivators and other cultivators alike, all of whom Lin Feng summarily killed. After battling their way to this place, and seeing their enemies only increase in number, Lin Feng had decided to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm to make the rest of their travels easier.

"But there are too many of them, and they came too fast!"

Only fifteen minutes had passed, but the array disc in his hand was already flickering erratically. A web of fine cracks spread across its surface, and the disc grew scalding hot.

*BANG!*

The precious array disc finally succumbed to the strain, exploding into a thousand pieces. The shimmering array vanished, revealing Wang Changyan to his enemies. The leading monk, his face contorted in fury, stared at the lone man and roared:

"Only you, you whelp? Where is that fiend?!"

Wang Changyan knew Lin Feng was in seclusion in the cultivator's abode directly beneath his feet. He refused to speak. The monk didn't attack immediately. Instead, his expression filled with sorrow, and he spoke, tears streaming down his face:

"Ever since the Maha fell and the great lineages scattered, our small temple branch has had no desire to contend with others. We remained in these mountains seeking only to preserve our Daoist tradition. Who would have thought that you bastards would barge in, murdering our people and destroying our temple for no reason! What justice is there in that?!"

The others nearby were grinding their teeth in hatred. One cultivator stepped forward and snapped:

"Enough talk! Force the fiend's whereabouts out of him!"

He strode forward and, in a few swift moves, seized the dharma power-depleted Wang Changyan. But just as he was about to strike, the heavy snowfall abruptly ceased. The snow on the ground instantly melted, replaced by creeping, reddish flames.

"Who dares!"

A torrent of red flames erupted from the abode below, engulfing the crowd. The assembled Buddhist cultivators and cultivators could not withstand the divine ability. They all collapsed, their knees shattering, their bodies rupturing from the sheer pressure.

A man in red and white armor emerged, commanding the fire. He tilted his head back and let out a long roar that blasted the very snow from the sky, leaving only his proud, defiant silhouette.

"A swarm of ants dares to block my path!"

He pressed two fingers together, unleashing a jet of flame. In an instant, all the cultivators below were incinerated. The wailing monk, the vengeful cultivatornot even ash remained. The fire consumed them all and scorched the fertile, snow-covered earth beneath, burning away all moisture, turning rich soil to sand, transforming the land into a barren desert.

"Young Master Lin!"

Wang Changyan wept with joy. But then he saw dark clouds gather overhead, and a massive golden body gradually emerged. Its upper half was veiled in brilliant light, its feet resting on the clouds, trampling a mountain of fiends. Behind it, a thousand hands each gripped a long staff. A jade crown glowed upon its head, and nestled within that crown was another human head, its face contorted in rage.

This primary face had a jade-like complexion and a slightly open mouth. But upon its tongue rested another facepink and delicate, with two bulging, bloodshot eyes. This second mouth opened and bellowed:

"Demonic disciple! How dare you commit mass slaughter here!"

"I am the Maha of the Way of Wrath! I have descended from the rain of myriad blossoms specifically to subdue you, demon!"

Wang Changyan nearly fainted from terror. 'What kind of Maha is this?! It's hideous! A head growing out of another head... even a true fiend couldn't be this monstrous!'

The grandiose spectacle made even Lin Feng frown. He studied the being, unable to suppress a visceral disgust. A throbbing anger surged within him, a deep-seated loathing, as if he recognized this creature from a time long past. He replied:

"Maha my ass."

He immediately summoned a long, red-glowing saber. Gripping it tightly, he pointed it directly at the massive entity in the sky. Red flames billowed from his feet as he shot into the air.

"Flames, come!"

As expected of a person of his stature, he had summoned a Spiritual Treasure right away. The Maha in the sky was so terrified it almost dropped its illusory form and fled. But, having accepted this task, it could only brace itself, summon its own Treasured Artifact, and roar:

"Fiend, you still dare to act so presumptuously!"

The garish, multi-colored Treasured Artifact lasted only a single breath against the raging flames of the Blazing Fire Spiritual Treasure. It held on only because of the Maha's vastly superior cultivation and dharma power. But as the corner of Lin Feng's mouth curved into a smirk, the artifact emitted a tormented screech and exploded.

"Vicious disciple!"

The Maha didn't have time to mourn its artifact. It transformed into a streak of light and fled toward the horizon. Lin Feng, seeing it was all bark and no bite, laughed loudly and gave chase, shooting north at extreme speed. He left only a patch of lingering flames and a single sentence behind:

"Changyan, wait here! I'll be right back!"

The flames drifted down, enveloping Wang Changyan in a protective barrier. Filled with relief, he sat down cross-legged, overwhelmed with emotion.

'Incredible... That Maha was terrifying, yet Young Master Lin is chasing it down like prey...'

He sat for a while, his heart gradually calming as the wind and snow resumed their fall. Then, he spotted a small black dot moving through the blizzard. As it drew closer, he saw it was an old man leaning on a staff, walking slowly toward him.

At first, Wang Changyan worried for the old man in the cold. But as the figure drew closer, he saw the ordination scars on his head. He was a monk. Disgust immediately filled Wang Changyan. The old monk stopped, his staff planting itself firmly in the snow. He pressed his palms together and sighed.

"Fellow Daoist, you are here searching for your family, are you not?"

Wang Changyan assumed the monk had used some divine ability to discover this. He remained wary and silent. But the old monk continued:

"Your disciple-brother and disciple-sister came from the south all those years ago. They achieved sudden enlightenment and are now quite famous in the dharma-realm. Now, you too have been called by karma, traveling a thousand li to be here. You have opportunely borrowed this Great One's momentum to arrive. It is truly wonderful."

"Fellow Daoist... it is time for you to return to the Buddhist Land."

Wang Changyan stared at him warily, but the old monk simply smiled faintly.

"I am the abbot of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. Following the guidance of karma, I have come to receive you, Fellow Daoist."

In that instant, the wind and snow ceased, and a brilliant light flashed.

*

The snow over Shanghuo County flickered in and out of existence, but Lin Feng was already far away, having crossed one snow-covered prefecture city after another. Monks below would occasionally look up as he passed, but soon the terrain grew higher. The monks disappeared, and the air grew thick with immortal energy, wreathed in white mist.

After a long chase, Lin Feng pulled a small flask from his sleeve. He blew on it, and a jet of reddish flame leaped out. It swelled in the wind, instantly vaporizing the snow and cracking the earth below.

The Maha, having already lost one excellent Treasured Artifact, dared not block the attack with its dharma body. It desperately tossed out several more common Treasured Artifacts, but these flames were extraordinary. The fire curled in the air, instantly melting the artifacts into molten slag. This only seemed to fuel the blaze, which lunged for the Maha's back.

The Maha prepared to traverse the Great Void, but a sudden chill prickled its brow. The Spiritual Treasure saber was already there, waiting in the void, ready to drop on its head the moment it crossed over.

"Dammit..."

Choosing the lesser of two evils, it channeled its dharma power, streams of golden light pouring from its brow to form a shield against the inferno at its back.

But the Way of Blazing Fire was unique. A single drop of the flame touched the golden shield and instantly expanded, sapping the Maha's dharma power as if it were a karmic flame. Its dharma body began to crack all over, paralyzing it.

The shield was pierced like paper. The Maha's dharma body, renowned for its toughness, melted like wax where the fire touched. A large hole was burned clean through it. The entity flashed with brilliant light and howled in agony.

'They said Foundation Establishment Realm and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators weren't as terrifying as they used to be... What bullshit! What kind of Purple Mansion Realm cultivator pulls out two Spiritual Treasures and hunts someone down like this?!'

Despite its grievous injuries, the Maha's escape light never wavered, and it finally bought itself a moment's respite.

But the respite was brief. Lin Feng drew closer, the scorching flames almost licking the Maha's back. The spiritual energy in the air was growing denser here. The Maha stopped trying to weave through the Great Void and was now burning massive amounts of dharma power to flee in the real world, barely maintaining its distance.

Soon, as the terrain grew more complex, the Maha suddenly dropped its massive form, using the maneuver to dodge the flames. It transformed into a young monk with snow-white skin. He looked wretched. A large, smoldering hole was burned through the back of his robes, the edges blackened and red.

He even retained his mortal habits, sucking in sharp breaths against the pain as he hiked up his robesrevealing calves wrapped in white clothand stumbled onward.

They had reached a deep forest, and the faint song of a woodcutter drifted through the trees. Lin Feng felt something was wrong and stopped. He suddenly noticed two Daoists on a large rock up ahead, chatting and laughing.

The younger of the two, who looked middle-aged, stood beside the rock. He had a long face, phoenix eyes, and was dressed simply, with only six small, antique-looking decorative swords at his waist. He was bowing respectfully to the other.

The older one wore purple-black Daoist robes. Though his face was wrinkled, he exuded the transcendent aura of an immortal. He smiled as he gazed forward, seeming both amiable and approachable.

Lin Feng stopped. The fleeing monk collapsed to his knees with a thud, kowtowing frantically at the feet of the two Daoists. The middle-aged Daoist stepped right over the monk, approached Lin Feng, and smiled.

"Sir, please."

Lin Feng frowned slightly and took a step forward. The old Daoist hopped down from the rock and cupped his hands in greeting.

"Senior, please!"

...

Jiangbei.

This mountain range in Jiangbei was sparsely vegetated and covered in a thin layer of snow. It faced a small set of hills to the north and was only a few dozen li from the Golden Tang Gate. One only had to look up to the east to see Tangdao Mountain and the colorful, glowing Buddhist Land that reached into the clouds. Many monks had already begun building temples in the area, marking their territory.

There were no famous mountains here, and the Great Void was calm. Li Ximing rode his Heavenly Light, its colors muted, as he waited quietly in a corner of the void.

The Great One's time in Jiangbei was set at six years and six months. The disturbances in the north were significant, but too distant to discern clearly. The appointed time, however, was fixed. For the past month, Li Ximing had been out of seclusion, waiting here anxiously.

His greatest worry was the Buddhist Land to the east.

Bai Yinzi's cultivation spot was actually well-chosen: neither too close nor too far from the major sects, with only the Golden Tang Gate nearby. He himself was an old man, well past his prime, so when the various factions were vying for talents, he was naturally far less desirable than prospects like Xiao Yuan.

But then the Buddhist cultivators conquered the Golden Tang Gate and pressed south over the mountains. Suddenly, Bai Yinzi's location became extremely awkwardit was now right on their doorstep. This made Li Ximing, waiting in secret, deeply anxious.

'It was hard to tell before,' Li Ximing thought, 'but for the last month, a Merciful One has been active nearby, making a big show of it. Apparently, the Buddhist cultivators value this old man more than I anticipated.'

Bai Yinzi's path on the Immortal Dao was a dead end. His cultivation from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment Realm was based on laughably poor methods; he had reached his current realm almost entirely by luck. But the Buddhist cultivators didn't care about that. His old age was irrelevant. Once he entered the Buddhist Land, his lifespan would be greatly extended. They had time.

'Luckily, they only seem to have dispatched a single Merciful One. One is nothing to fear. I'll just grab the man and leave. No need for entanglement.'

With two great treasures in his possession, his confidence was high.

He waited silently for another moment, then recited an incantation to consult the Immortal Mirror. His sea of qi roiled, and his heart trembled.

"It really is Bai Yinzi!"

Bai Yinzi's abode was shallow and crude, more like a small hovel dug into the mountaintop. The old man was sitting inside, cultivating. Beside him lay a golden-sheathed sword.

Li Ximing almost jumped, but a closer look revealed the gold was just the scabbard, apparently crafted from some cheap, gilded metal. It was an insulting sheath for the dharma sword within.

Peering past the gaudy exterior, he could see the gray longsword resting within, exuding the clear, cold light of the moon. It was a complete mismatch for the old man and his crude surroundings.

'Falling Cassia!'

To put it bluntly, if you sold Bai Yinzi and all his worldly possessions, it wouldn't be enough to buy the raw materials for this blade. Yet this precious Secret Diffusion Supreme Yin longsword was just lying casually by the bed, like some common trinket.

'Unbelievable...'

Li Ximing saw it clearly. This was the exact sword that had appeared in everyone's minds back then!

"Excellent!"

His gaze shifted, focusing on the pommel. It wasn't bare. A Qi Refining-level treasure was tied to it, a tassel woven from glittering golden silkworm thread.

The discovery made Li Ximing's breath catch. He pulled his gaze away, a theory already forming.

'It's definitely the sword. Logically, the fragment should have been hanging from the hilt. When the Great One retrieved the sword, he would have taken the fragment with it and given them both to Bai Yinzi...'

'So... it's highly likely Bai Yinzi received it, put the original fragment away for safekeeping, and then ran off to commission this gaudy scabbard. He must have thought the original tassel was too crude and plain, so he replaced it with this flashy golden thread.'

'Rogue cultivators are frugal. Since he stored the fragment, it's almost certainly in his storage bag.'

He immediately scanned the Great Void again. He wasn't alone. Two Merciful Ones and a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master were also positioned near the mountain, motionless, just waiting.

"What a lively gathering..."

Thanks to the Immortal Mirror, Li Ximing knew the exact positions of all three. He calculated quickly. From his current position, if he descended now, he would arrive at the exact same moment as the old nun. He was fast enough.

The cold snow fell. As he pondered, a red glow rippled on the distant horizon, flashing once. At the same moment, a jade pendant in his palm suddenly shattered, disintegrating into fine powder.

"The Great One has gone to Luoxia!"

The breakthrough phenomenon appeared, and the pendant shattered at the same instant. It was the signal from Ning Wan!

He didn't know where she was, and she was likely fighting for her own resources, but she had still remembered to send the signal.

Li Ximing's mind cleared. Without a second thought, he strode through the Great Void. A brilliant Heavenly Light erupted from the mountainside, appearing at the exact same instant as the distant phenomenon on the horizon!

Bai Yinzi's defensive array was a child's toy. Traversing it through the Great Void was instantaneous. The heavy, sealed stone door was a joke, utterly useless against a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Li Ximing materialized directly inside the abode.

As expected, the abode was dim, shabby, and poor, lit only by a single, bean-sized flame. It contained nothing but a stone bed of the crudest make.

The old man, Bai Yinzi, was hunched over, cultivating cross-legged on the bed, completely unaware.

*BOOM!*

A brilliant Treasure Light erupted, no slower than Li Ximing. On the other side of the tiny abode, an ancient, frail-looking nun materialized. She wore gray robes, held a long string of prayer beads, and had a compassionate face, but her eyes were icy cold as they locked onto him.

"Fellow Daoist, wait!"

Both he and the nun lunged for Bai Yinzi at the same instant. Li Ximing's heart was in turmoil.

'When a Merciful One and a Purple Mansion Realm expert clash, Bai Yinzi will be killed in the crossfire. The nun is strong, and she's here for the man. Her first move will be to protect him with all her dharma power, even if it means letting me take the Falling Cassia dharma sword.'

He sighed. In that final instant, his Heavenly Light flickered, dodging the nun's divine ability and latching onto the sword's hilt, snatching Falling Cassia from the bed.

He was undoubtedly stronger than her. If they were alone, he could have used his Spiritual Artifact to suppress her and take both the man and the sword. But with two other "orioles" waiting in the hiding, Li Ximing had to take the sword first.

There was no other choice. Many eyes were on Li Ximing. The Li family had, under public scrutiny, received news of this sword from a True Monarch and had been publicly searching for it with a drawing, a search that had led them straight to Bai Yinzi.

Everyone believed the Li family's entire all-consuming searchthe reason Li Ximing had even abandoned Wang Xiaoxiao's familywas for this Supreme Yin dharma sword. That could be explained by the connection between the Celestial Moon Sword Codex and Supreme Yin. But if he *didn't* take the sword, and instead lunged for a storage bag? Forget the assembled cultivators, Merciful Ones, and Mahaseven an idiot would know something was amiss.

The resulting trouble would be endless; the others would fight him to the death for the *real* prize. If he took the sword, however, there would be plenty of opportunity to negotiate for the man later.

He had no choice but to feign ecstasy as he secured the sword, watching as the nun's divine ability enveloped Bai Yinzi. But even with this "concession," the old nun looked surprised. She stared at him coldly.

"Oh... the Li clan even abandoned Wang Xiaoxiao for this. There must be something truly special about this Supreme Yin dharma sword!"

Li Ximing wasn't the least bit afraid. He watched her calmly, determined to get what he came for. A thick killing intent rose in his heart as he said softly:

"You can't take him alone. Everyone else, come on out."

This statement was meant to justify his taking the sword. The old nun's face showed a trace of apprehension. She said nothing, but her hands immediately formed a seal. The prayer beads began to spin, releasing a massive amount of golden light.

"Just you?"

Li Ximing stood unmoved. The blue-and-yellow spiritual ruler at his waist floated up, spinning slowly. A two-colored, ripple-like pattern of mountains and rivers spread outward, obliterating the abode's array, stone door, and walls. The entire hovel exploded from the inside out like a firecracker, kicking up a massive storm of dust and pulverized rock on the mountaintop.

*BOOM!*

The overlapping pattern of mountains and rivers bloomed across the snow-covered peak like a mysterious, blue-and-yellow flower. The Daoist Master in his white-gold robes stood upon his Heavenly Light, his voice like thunder and brimming with killing intent:

"Do you really think you're one of the Lotus Seat's elite?!"



### Chapter 888: Golden Halberd

Azure and yellow patterns, like mountains and rivers, rippled into view, instantly sweeping aside the billowing clouds of dust and grit. The old nun could no longer maintain her disguise. She erupted in brilliant light, revealing her true form.

"The Buddhist Land lies to the east. You are bold indeed, Daoist friend!"

It was a female visage, overflowing with dazzling light. Behind her, a hundred slender arms fanned out like an ornate screen. Her primary, normal-sized hands were pressed together before her chest. Her eyes glittered with golden light, her expression solemn as she sat upon a pink lotus pedestal, hovering in mid-air.

The moment she appeared, the Heavenly Light between Li Ximing's brows flickered as it discerned her true nature. His heart settled instantly.

'This thing is barely stronger than those newly-advanced Merciful Ones who served Chiluo. At least she has something to sit on, though it looks like an inferior Treasured Artifact. I wasn't afraid of their kind back then, so why would I be today?'

'Still, its appearance is formidable. All those hands clearly set her apart from Chiluo's subordinates. She's likely one they've invested heavily in... otherwise, she wouldn't have landed this plush assignment as a guide.'

His Heavenly Light completed its probe. In the air, Reveal River spun, flashed, and suddenly erupted with light.

The power of Reveal River was directly related to proximity. The closer an opponent was to Li Ximing's body, the stronger its wondrous entangling and pulling force became. To fight him for Bai Yinzi, the old nun had been right in his face. And though she had retreated a couple of steps, she was still only a few yards away!

The old nun felt as if she had plunged into a swamp. The azure and yellow light layered beneath her feet, forming illusory mountains and rivers that clung and pulled, weighing down her dharma body. The light she had summoned to retreat was dragged apart and dissipated. For a crucial moment, she was held fast. Hatred flared instinctively.

'Damn this demonic cultivator... capturing people daily to refine artifacts, yet he possesses such an incredible treasure! From the looks of it... it must be modeled after the *Imperial Observation of the Origin* mentioned in the scriptures.'

How could Li Ximing waste such a perfect opportunity? At this range, whether he used True Fire or a Dharma Art, she had no chance to escape into the Great Void. His fingers were already pressed to his lips.

Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire!

The True Fire was blazing red on the outside, its core a brilliant white-gold. It bloomed in the air, erupting into a wave of pure golden flame, streaked with purple, that washed over the old nun.

The old nun instantly formed a hand seal, her first instinct to defend and retreat. But guarding against the True Fire cost her a fraction of a second—just enough time for a brilliant light to shoot toward her.

'Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!'

The old nun knew of Li Ximing's Divine Ability and had heard he'd refined a spirit embryo; that was why she had been so wary. She hadn't anticipated the sheer range of Reveal River, but she was not without her own resources. The hundred slender arms behind her glowed as one, casting a brilliant golden-yellow light.

This golden-yellow spell art had clearly been prepared in advance, stored within her many arms. It manifested with incredible density, momentarily holding back the flames. Simultaneously, the lotus pedestal beneath her feet emanated a pink glow, rising to block the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.

But no matter how dense the golden light, a Purple Mansion Realm True Fire was not so easily denied. It burned with a sharp sizzle, rapidly thinning the defense. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light focused on a single point, causing the pedestal's pink shield to flicker between light and shadow.

'That damned spirit embryo...'

She had never expected such a relentless barrage of attacks. Worse, she had been caught by Reveal River from the start. One misstep had led to a cascade of failures. Unsure if the artifact was just stronger up close, she was consumed by the urge to flee and spat a mouthful of brilliant light.

But it all happened in the space of a single breath. While she was pinned by the True Fire and the Hidden Light, the Daoist Master in the white-gold robe appeared before her. He extended a palm, deceptively simple and unadorned.

"Not good!"

How could she dare take that strike? The most unassuming attacks were often the deadliest. Forgetting that the light in her mouth was still gathering, she sprayed it forth to block, simultaneously trying to twist away.

"Boom!"

The brilliant light was instantly overwhelmed by the dense flames. Li Ximing felt a brief sear on his palm as it grazed past her dharma body, striking the pedestal's pink shield and shattering it into nothing.

The old nun's face burned with heat. Though she had dodged the palm, the azure-yellow patterns of Reveal River surged again like an ocean tide, their power even greater than before. She tried to retreat, but the dragging force held her, allowing her to move only a few yards.

The old nun finally understood why the spirit embryo's power kept increasing.

'It's stronger the closer it is!'

She had always cultivated in the north, where Merciful Ones were plentiful and Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters were rare. The few times she had encountered one, there had been no need for conflict. Now, in her first true battle with one, she finally understood why Merciful Ones were always considered a step below.

'He hasn't even used *that* Divine Ability... We already have one less Divine Ability than they do, and our Treasured Artifacts are leagues behind their spirit embryos and Spiritual Artifacts. How can we possibly win a duel? It's always said that only by sitting on the Golden Lotus Seat and receiving the full blessing of the Buddhist Land can we make a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator hesitate. Without a truly precious Treasured Artifact, what else can we do!'

Li Ximing felt no regret. The palm had been difficult to land; its true purpose was to stop her from escaping into the Great Void. In that, it had succeeded, and her retreat had rendered the lotus pedestal useless.

The white light between Li Ximing's brows still shone brightly. Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was still active!

"Boom!"

The Heavenly Light finally struck her chest. Billowing, bright-white smoke erupted with a shower of sparks, and the creature spat a mouthful of golden blood.

While Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light wasn't his most powerful attack, its righteous nature was perfectly aspected against her, amplifying its effect. If not for the inherent resilience of a Merciful One's dharma body, that single blow would have been devastating.

By now, her golden defensive light had been burned away. The massive cloud of True Fire churned above, ready to descend. If that fire touched her, the pain would be unbearable, to say nothing of protecting Bai Yinzi. Losing her composure, she shrieked:

"Nu Yan!"

As her cry faded, a hearty laugh echoed from the heavens. Another golden body emerged from the Great Void, this one as large as a palace. It had four arms, each grasping a glittering golden artifact. A brilliant light flashed between its brows, reinforcing the failing Dharma Art that held back the True Fire. Its voice boomed like thunder:

"Nu Xiao, still trying to claim all the glory for yourself? You're about to be beaten to death!"

Li Ximing glanced toward the Great Void—the other Purple Mansion Realm expert was still observing. A faint golden light began to glow in his eyes as he fixed his gaze on the newcomer.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

Instantly, iridescent clouds churned as Heavenly Light pierced the sky. The Celestial Gate materialized, its illusory golden-armored figures and flowing robes more brilliant than ever. Banners snapped and fluttered in the clouds as two massive, bright-white pillars descended from above.

Nu Yan was clearly far stronger than Nu Xiao. Although the increased power of Audience with the Celestial Gate made his eye twitch, he merely raised a hand, unleashing a beam of pink light and shouting:

"Come!"

A small kasaya robe flew through the air with astonishing speed, descending on a beam of light from the Buddhist Land. It enveloped Bai Yinzi, whisking the child from Merciful One Nu Xiao's grasp. Nu Yan's body erupted in golden light; he had clearly been prepared to channel the Buddhist Land's power all along, waiting for the perfect moment to intervene.

But the Celestial Gate didn't target Nu Yan. The surging Heavenly Light smashed down toward Nu Xiao instead, attempting to sever her connection to the Buddhist Land. Li Ximing himself shot directly at Nu Xiao, completely ignoring Bai Yinzi.

'Hmph!'

Seeing that his opponent truly didn't care about Bai Yinzi and was instead focused on killing one of them—relentlessly pursuing Nu Xiao before she could be reinforced—Merciful One Nu Yan felt forced onto the back foot. He had no choice but to raise his hands to intercept the descending Radiant Pass.

'If Nu Xiao is crushed, her dharma body will be destroyed. The master will think I let her die on purpose to steal Bai Yinzi!'

He sighed inwardly:

'He really abandoned Wang Xiaoxiao, abandoned his entire family, and ran all the way to the west... just for this one Dharma sword. It seems he sensed something. A pity, a real pity. This just got much more complicated.'

'He's already gotten what he came for. Bai Yinzi is useless to him. He just wants to kill us, and getting rid of Nu Xiao is his top priority.'

The Great Desire and Way of Emptiness paths had been watching Daoist Master Zhaojing for a long time. In past years, he either stayed out of major conflicts or hid overseas, making it difficult for the two covetous paths to act. But now, he had flagrantly sided with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. A Wei-Li cultivator practicing Bright Yang... how could they not be tempted?

The Buddhist cultivators were not unaware of the Li Clan's search for Bai Yinzi. However, they also had agents in the Wang Clan and knew Wang Quwan was a Li operative, so they dismissed it as a feint. The Wang Clan, after all, had two individuals blessed by fate and possessed multiple Ancient Dharma Artifacts—the two sides were incomparable. Their forces elsewhere had even brought an Enlightened Artifact, lying in wait for Zhaojing. With the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition lurking, killing him was unlikely, but heavily wounding him would be an excellent outcome.

But Zhaojing had come here instead. While not entirely unexpected, it was certainly a disappointment.

'This place is too close to the Buddhist Land. He won't dare overextend himself. We just need to let him retreat.'

With Bai Yinzi secured, Nu Yan wasn't afraid. Thankfully, he had arrived in time. He managed to hold back the Audience with the Celestial Gate, and under the suppressing light of the Buddhist Land, the gate's power was diminished by sixty or seventy percent as it began to close. Still, the force made his body sink, and he grimaced.

'Audience with the Celestial Gate plus a Purple Mansion Realm True Fire... It's truly unfair!'

Fortunately, his own abilities were extraordinary. All four arms pressed together, forming a spherical golden shield. An imposing, brilliant light, mingled with golden flames, surged upward, trying to topple the Divine Ability.

"Crash!"

As expected, the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire followed, surging into the base of the Divine Ability and pinning him completely. Even though Merciful One Nu Yan was himself a master of fire, the heat seared his entire body.

Seeing this, Merciful One Nu Xiao actually breathed a sigh of relief.

'With his most dangerous weapons, the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire and Audience with the Celestial Gate, both occupied... he's a tiger without its fangs!'

The light of Reveal River still flickered. Li Ximing sat ethereally in the air, formed a simple hand seal, and waves of Li Fire infused with Supreme Yang light descended. Merciful One Nu Xiao glanced at the attack; its power was clearly inferior. But having learned her lesson, she dared not be careless. She used the momentary lull to try and escape Reveal River's range.

But Li Ximing wouldn't let her go. He instantly pursued her on a beam of light. Her lotus pedestal was for self-augmentation, not flight, and with Reveal River constantly dragging at her, escape was impossible.

Fury and hatred began to build in Merciful One Nu Xiao. The thousand slender hands behind her lit up, and she spat in a low voice:

"What more do you want!"

Before her voice faded, Li Ximing's figure vanished.

Merciful One Nu Xiao went on high alert. Ignoring the waves of Li Fire and Heavenly Light, she prepared the brilliant light in her mouth and charged her escape technique. As expected, the Great Void flickered, and from within the searing Li Fire, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light shot out again.

She remained vigilant, certain he was trying the same trick. She extended two fingers, casting a Dharma Art to temporarily block the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, while the golden light protecting her back held firm, guarding against Li Ximing's reappearance.

But the Heavenly Light before her rapidly dispersed. Amidst the scattered Li Fire, there was no one.

Her confusion lasted only an instant. She snapped her head to the east—where Nu Yan, trapped beneath the Divine Ability and engulfed in True Fire, suddenly looked horrified.

"Not good!"

Almost simultaneous with his thought, the searing True Fire parted, and the Daoist Master in white-gold robes appeared before him.

His expression was glacial. The azure-yellow ruler by his side—Reveal River—unleashed its mountain patterns, covering the area. The power of the Divine Ability already crushing Nu Yan intensified, becoming utterly unbearable.

But what truly captured Merciful One Nu Yan's attention was his hand.

He was holding a three-foot-long golden halberd. The corners of its blade curved like crescent moons, and embossed beast-patterns rippled across the heavy, bronze-gold surface, reflecting a terrifying spiritual light.

A dense Bright Yang aura clung heavily to the golden halberd, so weighty it seemed to make Li Ximing stagger. Utter horror crept onto Merciful One Nu Yan's face as a single term echoed in his mind:

"Spiritual Artifact!"

The Radiant Sun King's Halberd in Li Ximing's hand felt as heavy as the world. Audience with the Celestial Gate locked Nu Yan in place, and the True Fire seared him. Merciful One Nu Yan still had trump cards, but his heart plunged into an icy abyss, a cold that pierced his very bones.

'A Spiritual Artifact? Where did he get a Spiritual Artifact?'

He hadn't feared being trapped, because he believed his opponent lacked a decisive weapon that could truly harm him. Now, everything was reversed. Seared by the True Fire, he could only part his golden-red lips and forcefully spit out a round pearl.

The pearl was smooth, bright, and translucent, its surface awash with flowing runes. It was clearly a life-saving Treasured Artifact, one he had refined for many years.

A golden light simultaneously flared between his brows and poured into the pearl. His eyes widened, staring in horror as the short distance seemed to stretch into an eternity. The Spiritual Artifact finally struck.

"Peng!"

The pearl Treasured Artifact took the brunt of the impact.

The Treasured Artifact collided with the fully-charged Spiritual Artifact. A blinding light erupted at the point of impact, exploding in a shower of sparks. The Divine Ability and dharma power Merciful One Nu Yan had frantically poured into the pearl evaporated instantly. As if struck by a colossal club, the Treasured Artifact was blasted away at imperceptible speed.

The Radiant Sun King's Halberd still glinted coldly. While the impact had momentarily dimmed its light, the defeated Treasured Artifact released a flash of radiance as it was sent flying, which the halberd seemed to absorb. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd flared with light, its power seemingly restored.

A vast, overwhelming golden light filled Merciful One Nu Yan's pupils.

"Clang!"

An impossibly dense wave of brilliant light, entangled with Bright Yang, shot skyward. It surged up the white pillars of the Celestial Gate, climbing past layer upon layer of runes like a golden torrent rushing into the heavens.

The Divine Ability Audience with the Celestial Gate, hovering above, began to shake violently. It dissolved into a golden cloud that stretched to the horizon, and from it, sand and stone began to rain down.

"Crash..."

Sand and stone cascaded down Merciful One Nu Xiao's golden form. Her face was bathed in the golden radiance, and the guiding Buddhist light from the sky above flickered precariously. A deep, profound dread filled her heart.

"A purely offensive Spiritual Artifact! One that resonates with Bright Yang!"

"There is no way he found that on his own... We've been set up by the Immortal Dao!"



# Chapter 889: Breaking the Flame

'Splitting Light.'

'It vanquishes evil, punishes the disloyal, is not lightly entrusted, and kills when moved.'

Li Ximing stood firm amidst the roiling sandstorm, long halberd in hand. The aura that had peaked around him began to recede. At his side, the Reveal River pulsed with azure and yellow light, and in an instant, the raging sands were stilled.

The four-armed, golden-skinned Merciful One remained in its original spot, but its body trembled violently. It was covered in a web of fine cracks. Sand and gravel streamed from the fissures, cascading down its form. Alongside the debris, brilliant, sacred light escaped in threads and wisps from the fractures in its body.

Its imposing, gilded head had already disintegrated into a golden storm of light that rushed to the sky. Its neck had been pulverized along with it. A deep gash marked the center of its collarbones, and a spiderweb of impact fractures spread across its entire chest, reflecting a shimmering white light.

Before it, Li Ximing was but a tiny speck of light, yet he did not pause. His eyes turned a pale gold. Pressing two fingers to his lips, he suddenly exhaled a gout of flame.

The flame was a faint purple, resonating with his Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire and imbuing that True Fire with a pale violet halo.

Flame-Spitting!

The moment the Radiant Sun King's Halberd was brandished, a mouthful of Li Fire materialized, surging forth with the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire in a torrential downpour.

Above, the Celestial Gate flickered. Vicious flames crept up along the cracks. The massive, headless dharma body stood sluggishly beneath the Radiant Pass, casting a vast shadow upon the land. Suppressed by the Celestial Gate and scorched by the True Fire, its radiant light fled ever more frantically. The dharma body itself showed rapid signs of melting.

The Nu Yan Merciful One had dared to receive *Audience with the Celestial Gate* with its physical form, so its dharma body was naturally extraordinary. But now, pinned beneath the Divine Ability and scorched by True Fire, it couldn't move a single step. Severed from the light of the Buddhist Land and caught off guard, its dharma body had absorbed ninety percent of the halberd's strike. Even though the blow hadn't banished it back to the Buddhist Land, it was nearly incapacitated.

Only now did the Nu Yan Merciful One begin to recover. Its headless body groaned under the pressure of the Celestial Gate. A dim, round pearl offered what little support it could. Two eyes opened upon its chest, releasing a protective light just as the Nu Xiao Merciful One sped onto the scene.

Radiance overflowed from *Audience with the Celestial Gate* as the Divine Ability pulsed. Li Ximing's expression remained calm, but he had already detected a subtle fluctuation in the Great Void. The glow of the Buddhist Land was intensifying. He frowned inwardly.

'Another Merciful One has arrived... It's probably not from the Way of Great Desire. It's just observing from the Great Void.'

Under the Immortal Mirror's illumination, a new Merciful One was visible, standing in the Great Void. Its radiant light shot to the heavens as it stood upon a golden cloud. It had three eyes on its face; the one in the center of its brow held a deep, purplish-black color, its light contained but shockingly potent. Two more bright white eyes had opened on its chest. This was no ordinary being.

'This must be one from beneath a Golden Lotus Seat! Its cultivation looks profound!'

Although this Five-Eyed Merciful One sat serenely in the Great Void, its two main eyes slightly lowered, remaining perfectly still with no intention of intervening, Li Ximing grew vigilant.

'I can't drag this out any longer!'

As Nu Xiao rushed over, he merely turned his head to the side. This Merciful One's many arms formed hand seals in unison, then thrust forward and upward, releasing countless golden lights shaped like lotus leaves. The Merciful One then split into three, each holding a saber, spear, or sword, and hacked toward his dharma body.

The golden light looked ordinary, seemingly lacking in power. But when the Heavenly Light between Li Ximing's brows shone upon it, he sensed a hidden sharpness and knew it was not as simple as it appeared.

'Looks like she's pulling out all the stops!'

The Reveal River before Li Ximing brightened, assuming its upright form. Azure and yellow patterns rippled outward like water as the two seals at its head and tail lit up simultaneously.

Monarch's Balance!

Before the three figures could even get close to the azure-yellow landscape patterns, the myriad lotus-leaf lights rained down. A clear beam shone from the profound Monarch's Balance, instantly revealing a single, tangible, radiant petal hidden among the dense barrage of golden light.

The Radiant Sun King's Halberd's Splitting Light was too slow to deploy; he naturally wouldn't dare try to block the attack with it. Instead, Li Ximing gently turned the Radiant Sun King's Halberd to a vertical position.

Radiance!

A pale, iridescent light immediately enveloped his body. But Li Ximing's preparations didn't end there. First, the bright fire of the Sun's Resonant Parting Art appeared. From within it, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger manifested, and the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen cascaded down.

The rain of golden petals hammered against the brownish-yellow Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen, making the barrier tremble. As the single, hidden, radiant petal struck, the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen shattered into pieces.

The patterns on the Reveal River wavered. Li Ximing himself didn't hesitate for a second. In a single step, he closed the distance and appeared directly in front of the Nu Yan Merciful One!

The Nu Yan Merciful One's dharma body was already on the verge of collapse. It was only surviving under the Celestial Gate by relying on its painstakingly refined treasure pearl. Even so, the scorching True Fire was still climbing its body. How could it possibly have a chance to move?

It could only glare at Li Ximing with blazing eyes, its gilded pupils filled with venomous hatred.

In that brief respite, it knew Nu Xiao was useless and that the Five-Eyed one in the Great Void was just watching the fire from the other shore. Its only option was to raise the kasaya robe in its hand high. It abandoned its shattered dharma body, which dissolved from top to bottom into a surging column of sacred light, flying upstream to assault *Audience with the Celestial Gate*!

If the Nu Yan Merciful One had abandoned its dharma body at full strength to attack *Audience with the Celestial Gate* while he was pincered, Li Ximing would have certainly been injured. But it had already taken a direct hit from Splitting Light and lost seventy or eighty percent of its power. Its remaining radiance merely forced *Audience with the Celestial Gate* to rise, transforming into light and flying back to Li Ximing's hand, forcing him to retreat a step, his face paling slightly.

The Nu Xiao Merciful One's attack arrived immediately after, striking Li Ximing's shoulder. The Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption failed instantly under the attack. Only the Radiance Divine Ability glowed faintly. With a sickening crunch, Heavenly Light flared, and the faint glint of iridescent bone was exposed.

Although the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen wasn't powerful, its strength lay in being repeatedly summoned at will with minimal cost and high speed. With the screen having blocked the worst of it and the Radiance's protection, the injury was not severe.

But his gaze was locked onto the kasaya robe flying through the sky. At the same time, his Immortal Mirror scanned the area, revealing three streaks of golden light already speeding in from the eastern Great Void!

'They're starting to catch up!'

The old man, Bai Yinzi, was wrapped tightly in the kasaya, unable to move, reduced to a mere human shape. The robe, empowered by the Nu Yan Merciful One's dying dharma power, glowed with golden light as it tried to escape!

Li Ximing immediately gave chase, daring not show his excitement. The Sun's Resonant Parting Art in his hand transformed into a chain of Li Fire and shot out in pursuit.

The Nu Yan Merciful One must have known where the Five-Eyed Merciful One was. It also knew Nu Xiao couldn't protect the prize. Even in death, it wouldn't allow the item to be lost. The three newcomers were still too far away, so its only choice was to send it toward the Five-Eyed Merciful One.

'But there's still one other person!'

As expected, the kasaya never had a chance to get far. A massive hand suddenly reached out from the Great Void. Divine Ability flowed around it as it clamped down on the robe, seizing it.

The newcomer wore a Daoist robe of dark patterns on an azure background. He had a youthful face and a slight smile. A vermilion dot adorned his brow, and a bottle decorated with dark clouds and silver sparrows hung from his waist. He caught the kasaya with one hand and chuckled.

"Good little monk!"

Seeing him appear, Li Ximing actually relaxed. After a brief moment weighing the pros and cons, he waved his hand to dismiss his Dharma Art, but kept his halberd ready, his expression focused.

"How dare you!"

Just then, four shafts of light appeared nearby. The imposing Five-Eyed Merciful One sat in their midst, its expression grave. Behind it stood three other Merciful Ones, all looking furious. They roared in unison, their voices like thunder in the sky.

Li Ximing acted as if he hadn't heard a thing. The newly arrived Daoist Master merely sneered, an odd look on his face. Both he and Li Ximing turned to look at the Nu Xiao Merciful One, now caught between them.

'Oh no!'

The joy on Nu Xiao's face had only half-formed before it turned to sheer terror. Scared out of her wits, she couldn't care about anything else. Her radiant light evaporated like steam as she fled into the Great Void in a single breath, clearly terrified.

Li Ximing took a small step forward. With a silent understanding, both men stepped into the Great Void and vanished.

"Five-Eyed! You... you... Just sitting on the mountain watching the tigers fight! The item is lost now. Let's see how you explain this!"

Nu Xiao reappeared, her eyes full of rage. She hurled the accusation, only to see the Five-Eyed Merciful One's expression remain perfectly calm. It replied coolly:

"Ignorant! While you were brawling here, Xuanyi in the Great Void had his eyes locked on me. If I had moved, wouldn't I have alerted the snake in the grass? Your reinforcements were so slow. You should be asking what's wrong with your Way of Great Desire, not questioning me!"

"I already tied down one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. It's your Way of Great Desire that failed!"

...

The Great Void.

Although Li Ximing had entered the Great Void, his senses remained locked on the other man. With a group of Merciful Ones present, the two of them naturally retreated together. If the other man had snatched Bai Yinzi and fled, the happiest parties would undoubtedly be the Buddhist cultivators.

The Daoist Master was all smiles. Without giving the Merciful Ones so much as a glance, he drew closer, and they proceeded south together. He praised,

"Fellow Daoist Zhaojing, what skill! This one is Xuanyi. I've long heard of your name!"

"I've also long heard of your great reputation!"

This man was none other than Daoist Master Xuanyi of Mount Jingyi!

His reputation was considerable; Li Ximing had heard his name countless times. Back when the Chunyi Dao Gate had besieged them, this Daoist Master Xuanyi had also suffered. As a result, they had never met. Now, they finally stood face to face.

Li Ximing discreetly glanced at the black-cloud-and-silver-sparrow bottle at Xuanyi's waist. Nu Xiao had clearly recognized Xuanyi, and their relationship was obviously terrible. That made him a potential ally—all the more so since Bai Yinzi was in his hands.

He smiled and said,

"This place is dangerous. After you!"

There was no enmity between them; in fact, they had several connections, and Li Ximing's side even owed him a small favor. Since they had seized the prize, they would certainly have to divide it. Li Ximing wasn't worried about what came next.

Daoist Master Xuanyi was surprisingly young. Whatever he was like on the inside, his outward appearance was at least dashing and unrestrained. He chuckled.

"I didn't do it on purpose. I never expected you to be here, Fellow Daoist, or that we'd run into each other like this... I'm afraid I've caused some offense!"

'In this situation... snatching food from the tiger's mouth, right in front of the Buddhist cultivators... I really have this Daoist Master Xuanyi to thank.'

Li Ximing had genuinely been prepared to suffer heavy injuries to capture Bai Yinzi. Although Xuanyi had been the one to snatch Bai Yinzi in the end, Li Ximing had known he was watching from the sidelines all along. He wasn't surprised. He had even factored Xuanyi into his calculations.

He had already snared Bai Yinzi with the Sun's Resonant Parting Art, but if Xuanyi hadn't appeared, he would have had to fight his way out and would have lost half his life in the process!

Moreover, if they hadn't snatched the prize and it had ended up in the Five-Eyed Merciful One's hands, a truly hard battle would have ensued. The two sides would never have sat down to divide the spoils... That Five-Eyed Merciful One was likely worth two of Nu Yan. Having Xuanyi force the Five-Eyed Merciful One to give up the chase was a much better outcome.

This was also why Li Ximing had let Xuanyi take it. The Buddhist cultivators already hated him enough. If they had truly fought over it and the prize ended up in his hands, the situation would have become very difficult.

'After all, we are facing the Buddhist Land.'

The two traversed the Great Void. Tremors came from all directions. Clearly, conflicts were raging all across Jiangbei, and the various battles were reaching their conclusions. Li Ximing asked,

"There are still other spoils to be had. Aren't you going to take a look, Daoist Master Xuanyi?"

Daoist Master Xuanyi waved his hand, his tone placid.

"Showing my face once is enough. Chunyi is also in Jiangbei. No matter where I go, there's a risk of them catching me. I might not win a fight against them, and as long as I get tied down, things will become troublesome."

Daoist Master Xuanyi was an overseas cultivator and had been matching wits with the Chunyi Dao Gate for many years. He clearly had his own code of survival. Li Ximing nodded to himself. He had even less inclination to fight for other treasures. He led Xuanyi to Gardenia Scenery Mountain, where they materialized beneath the jade pillar.

Xuanyi's azure robe with its dark patterns was surprisingly well-matched with the gardenias covering the ground. He cast an appreciative glance at Gardenia Scenery Mountain and said,

"What a fine view!"

He placed the kasaya on the ground and nodded amicably at Li Ximing, smiling.

"Regarding Shouding's matter, I must trouble your clan. He is ignorant of the ways of the world, reckless and negligent. I was unable to split my attention. It's all thanks to your clan's mediation. Please accept my thanks."

"It was nothing!"

Li Ximing laughed heartily and waved his hand, taking the initiative in the conversation. He calmly poured tea, careful not to appear too eager, and replied,

"Let's check on Bai Yinzi first. We mustn't let the Buddhist cultivators pull a fast one."

"Well said."

Xuanyi nodded and crooked a finger. The kasaya wasn't a powerful artifact to begin with, and his Divine Ability had been wearing it down the entire trip. It trembled and fell apart, and the old man, Bai Yinzi, tumbled out in a daze, crying,

"Aiyo!"

Li Ximing suppressed his excitement and watched calmly. The old man scrambled to his feet, recognized Li Ximing at a glance, and his eyes immediately reddened. He kowtowed repeatedly.

"Thank you for saving my life, Daoist Master! Thank you for saving my life!"

Xuanyi's Divine Ability was still swirling around him. Li Ximing smiled and said,

"Actually, it was this Daoist Master Xuanyi who saved you."

Xuanyi held his cup, looking at Bai Yinzi with a broad smile. He said,

"Your storage bag."

Bai Yinzi quickly presented his belongings. Xuanyi took the bag, and with a sweep of his Divine Ability, it was forcibly refined. It exploded with a *bang*, and all its contents clattered onto the ground.

This act, performed in front of Li Ximing, was Xuanyi's way of proving he wasn't hiding anything. Li Ximing's gaze was casual, but his peripheral vision instantly scanned the pile of miscellaneous items. Among the bottles, jars, talismans, and spiritual objects, he spotted a small, bright white spirit stone!

It was tossed among the other spiritual items like trash, only half-visible, discarded like an old shoe. Meanwhile, two brownish-yellow Qi Refining spiritual items were carefully packed in translucent jade boxes, sitting right on top of it.

The Talisman Seed in Li Ximing's sea of qi throbbed incessantly, releasing waves of cool energy. His blood surged with excitement, but his face remained impassive. He merely relaxed his brow.

He wasn't the only one; Daoist Master Xuanyi across from him also relaxed his brow. But Xuanyi was pleased by the dharma artifacts from Bai Yinzi's bag. He laughed and asked,

"Fellow Daoist Zhaojing, will you pick first, or shall I?"

He completely disregarded the feelings of Bai Yinzi, who was kneeling to the side, asking the question so brazenly. The old man, for his part, just kept kneeling, his gaze somewhat vacant.

Li Ximing's gaze swept lightly over the items. The various jade bottles and boxes disintegrated, revealing spiritual items of varying value. More importantly, four dharma artifacts lay in the main pile, all glowing brightly and looking quite fine. There was also a small box among them that had not been destroyed by the Divine Ability's touch. It was pure white with golden patterns, clearly an extraordinary item.

He smiled faintly and replied,

"My family doesn't need much, and he likely doesn't have it anyway. Let's take a look first..."

Xuanyi nodded with a smile. He flicked a finger, and the pure white box with fine golden patterns popped open, revealing its contents.

Inside were five small, shimmering silver leaves. Each was no bigger than a fingernail and had a "fuzzy" appearance. Every tiny, dense hair on the leaves' surfaces emitted a faint, ethereal glow. A rich pulse of spiritual energy washed over them, refreshing the mind and spirit.

Li Ximing only gave it a single glance, but under his spiritual sense's probe, it felt familiar. After a moment's thought, he faintly sensed a profundity related to the way of the Capital Guard.

"So, it's a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource."

Xuanyi casually lifted the jade box and brought it into his hand to examine. Although he didn't ask for it, his interest was obvious.

Li Ximing saw his opportunity. Putting on a look of sudden understanding, he activated his Divine Ability. The rest of the valuable items rose up one by one and landed on the table. The remaining miscellaneous junk tumbled to the floor. With a casual wave of his sleeve, he swept all that "junk" into his robe.

'Got it!'

He celebrated inwardly, nodding silently. Because he had already spread all the spiritual items out for inspection with their spiritual senses, Xuanyi naturally had no objections. He simply inclined his head and smiled.

"Fellow Daoist, do you recognize this item?"

(End of this chapter)



# Chapter 890: Heaven and Earth

Li Ximing glanced at the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual material before him. Although the item was precious, his heart remained calm. He merely said softly:

"It's from the Capital Guard path, isn't it? I have crossed blades with Yehui."

Daoist Master Xuanyi gave an imperceptible glance and nodded.

"Correct! This item is called Shangxiang Silver. Its origins are ancient. The Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition only possesses it because it was inherited from the Wanling Upper Sect."

"His other dharma artifacts are fine, but they mean little to me. Furthermore, fellow Daoist, you control an entire lake on the mainland; you certainly aren't lacking for resources. He had many treasures on him, but none compare to this box of spiritual materials."

Li Ximing had already secured the item, so he was naturally more at ease, but that didn't mean he would ignore the potential benefits right in front of him. He nodded.

"I know. The Capital Guard path is nearly extinct. The only one known on the mainland or beyond is the Capital immortals Dao. The Yehui I fought was quite skilled. This item is indeed precious."

"The Capital Guard..."

Xuanyi's expression turned faintly mocking as he replied:

"The various Immortal Dao paths may not always have the upper hand against Buddhist cultivators, but it is extremely rare for a Daoist tradition to be completely suppressed. Don't be fooled by Yehui's impressive display. When his Capital Guard path encounters a monk, the fight is... uncomfortable for him."

"Oh?"

The Capital Guard were almost extinct; this was the first Li Ximing had heard of such a weakness. Xuanyi seemed intent on adding fuel to the fire, lowering his voice.

"After Su Xikong attained the Dao, the temples of the Nine Provinces wept, and the Capital Guard Daoist tradition withered. It never prospered again. Several large sects submitted to Encompassing Profoundity Mountain. Later, when Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty ascended the great throne, he claimed to purge the mainland, felling mountains and destroying temples, completely severing the Capital Guard path. If Yehui hadn't obtained the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Treasury, this path would still be unknown today... In truth, this Profound Qi is also a sore spot for him."

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He offered his thanks, then watched as Xuanyi's expression turned serious.

"These four dharma artifacts all belong to Secret Diffusion. If fellow Daoist is willing, I will take three pieces of this spiritual material, leave two for you, and give you all the dharma artifacts as well... It's just..."

Xuanyi paused and sighed.

"It's just... I hope Bai Yinzi can pay a visit to my Mount Jingyi."

From the very beginning, his divine ability had been focused on Bai Yinzi, never releasing him for an instant. The young man appeared calm and breezy, but the flickering light of the "Black Cloud Silver Sparrow Bottle" at his waist revealed his master's determination.

'He is determined to have Bai Yinzi.'

Bai Yinzi, still on the floor, kept his head pressed tightly to the ground. He didn't move or speak, but his hands trembled where they lay. Even now, he couldn't understand why a group of Merciful Ones had fought to capture him, or why this man insisted on taking him by name.

Li Ximing fell silent for a moment before asking quietly:

"My family and Bai Yinzi are acquaintances. When we were gathering qi in the great desert, we stayed in his temple. Although we aren't deeply connected, I must still ask... How does Daoist Master Xuanyi plan to treat him?"

Daoist Master Xuanyi laughed. He lifted his robes slightly, revealing a pair of dark boots with silver-black patterns. He unfastied the Black Cloud Silver Sparrow Bottle from his waist and announced:

"This Corner-Cleansing Merit Bottle was passed down by my Master. It is a treasure of my Daoist tradition, but it is very heavy. If one's fate is not strong enough, holding it is a death sentence. I originally came to the mainland this time to find an disciple to carry the bottle."

A corner of his mouth twitched into a smile.

"This person can't be without cultivation... But as for talents like Su Yan or Xiao Yuan, first, I couldn't win a fight for them, and second, having them just carry a bottle would be a great waste. Bai Yinzi is at the Foundation Establishment Realm, at least. If I can't find a young disciple, an old man will have to do."

Li Ximing didn't fully believe him. He offered a meaningful reminder:

"Bai Yinzi doesn't have much lifespan left."

Xuanyi gave a noncommittal grunt. Li Ximing looked down at the old man.

"What about you?"

Only then did Bai Yinzi raise his head. His face was covered in sweat, his expression one of utter confusion.

Xuanyi came from a long line of Eastern Sea cultivators. He was only willing to say this much because of the Li family's reputation as pillars of the Righteous Path, and because Li Ximing was present. Did he truly care about Bai Yinzi's opinion? He let out a chuckle and said mockingly:

"You old fool, you don't know what's good for you. This is a great opportunity! Daoist Master Zhaojing said you don't have long to live. What's the point of struggling through these next few years? Follow me. I'll feed you a spirit medicine or two, and before you die, I'll find a new path for you. That's better than sitting around waiting to die, isn't it?"

"If you walk out of here today, you will certainly die. How can a Daoist Master follow you around day after day? Wouldn't that just be troubling him? Only by following me day after day will you find a path to survival!"

His words were half-truth, half-lie, spoken for both his listeners. Bai Yinzi began to kowtow forcefully, his head thudding against the floor.

"Thank you, Daoist Master! This lowly one understands!"

Li Ximing silently held his tea. Bai Yinzi's words had actually diffused much of the awkwardness. Since the old man had decided, Li Ximing didn't want to complicate matters. He asked:

"Senior Changxi made many arrangements before his death. Does Mount Jingyi know anything about them?"

Xuanyi waved his hand dismissively and drank his tea.

"Nothing major. Just protecting that Kong Gumo for him. Zhu Gong, on the other hand, went and rounded up his entire family. It makes things rather awkward for me. If Kong Gumo ever amounts to anything, won't she be the first one he hates?"

He seemed to have a good relationship with Daoist Master Zhu Gong, showing a "hating iron for not becoming steel" kind of frustration. He kicked up his boot.

"She hasn't had much contact with Buddhist cultivators, letting them just swallow her weapons... Ai, let's not talk about her. Thank you, Daoist Master Zhaojing, for your help!"

He hadn't finished speaking when he saw snowflakes drifting down from the sky. His expression immediately sobered, and he uncrossed his legs. "Qiuhu is here," he sighed. "It truly has been a long time!"

Li Ximing, of course, knew Ning Wan had arrived. Regardless of whether Xuanyi had reasons to avoid her, Ning Wan's arrival at his door was more important than this Eastern Sea cultivator. He immediately rose to greet her.

The celestial maiden, cloaked in wind and snow, landed on the platform. She swept her gaze across the scene, her eyes landing first on Li Ximing. She praised him:

"Daoist Master Zhaojing, you are formidable! Although I didn't go to Wang Xiaoxiao's location, Senior Kui Qi did. I heard the Merciful Ones all came up empty-handed. I never expected you to go for that Supreme Yin Dharma Sword!"

Li Ximing paused, stunned for a moment, then instantly understood. A chill ran through his heart.

'So those bald donkeys were all waiting for me there! No wonder there were so few people in the west!'

Although he had the Immortal Mirror to protect him, the situation in Jiangbei was chaotic, and countless eyes were watching. If he had really gone to the Wang family's location, while he might not have been seriously injured or killed, he certainly would have returned empty-handed.

Upon seeing Ning Wan, Xuanyi's demeanor became very proper. His former casual air vanished, replaced by a rather serious expression. He said formally:

"Daoist Friend Ning!"

The two had clearly met before. Ning Wan returned the salutation.

"Greetings, Brother Qu."

Xuanyi immediately shot to his feet, appearing somewhat hurried.

"Since Daoist Friend Ning has returned, the affairs in Jiangbei must be mostly concluded. I must depart quickly, lest I be cornered!"

With that, he secured the Corner-Cleansing Merit Bottle at his waist, divided the items, and spoke quickly:

"That fellow Sumian from Xuanmiao Temple... he puts on the appearance of a good person, but he's actually bent on throwing in his lot with the Demonic Path. And he has some resources, too. He got quite a few of Changxi's good things. Daoist Master Zhaojing, be careful. Don't let that old fox scheme against you."

Li Ximing shook his head inwardly.

Old Daoist Master Sumian of Xuanmiao Temple had spoken ill of Mount Jingyi long ago. And now this Xuanyi, for all his carefree demeanor, was just as merciless with his words.

'Which one of them can I trust? I'm afraid I can't trust either!'

The Daoist Master finally left in a whirlwind. The tremors from the north had also subsided. Ning Wan turned back, smiling.

"Congratulations, fellow Daoist... Seeing you unharmed is cause for celebration. After all, Five-Eyed leading a group of Merciful Ones is a real problem..."

"And that Nu Yan... he and the recently ascended Maha Nuzi are disciple-brothers, so his seniority is quite high. You sent him back to the Buddhist Land as well. Both Nu Xiao and Nu Yan were far more formidable than those subordinates of Taixi who couldn't even cast a proper Dharma Art. In my fight, I saw at least three Treasured Artifacts and four Dharma Arts. Those earlier opponents couldn't muster that much combined... It just shows... the foundation of the Way of Great Desire is much deeper than that of the Way of Emptiness!"

A worried look crossed Li Ximing's face. Ning Wan shook her head and sighed.

"Indeed... The situation with Bai Yinzi was relatively minor. On my side, at Xiao Yuan's location, not only did several cultivators from under the Golden Lotus Seat appear, but Vija and Nuzi also took action. Even the Lord of the White Victory Dao from the West High Plateau came..."

She paused, seeming to want to say more, but in the end, she only sighed.

"Houfu and Kui Qi are both in Jiangbei. If there weren't so many Buddhist cultivators, a massive battle would have been unavoidable."

The two spoke in detail for a while longer before Ning Wan finally said:

"Fei Qingya has been retrieved. The battle in Jiangbei hasn't stopped, but thankfully most of us have already withdrawn. I came back to find you mainly to check on your injuries. I'm heading to the riverbank to observe the situation. There might still be an opportunity. Do you want to come?"

Li Ximing had no heart to join her, using his injuries as an excuse. Ning Wan also had to see to the aftermath in the north, so she rode the wind and departed.

With Radiance and the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen, the injuries left by Nu Xiao were not serious; they would heal in a month at most. But he couldn't wait. Feigning calm, he didn't even examine the dharma artifacts he had received, nor did he spare a glance for the Shangxiang Silver tucked in his robes. He flew directly back and landed within his own Zhaoguang Profound Purple Great Array.

Palaces had already been constructed within the inner array. They were simple, spanning several levels. The highest main pavilion was naturally reserved for Li Ximing. The workers had already withdrawn, leaving few people behind. Li Ximing summoned Li Que'wan and instructed:

"Lock down the great array and stand guard outside. If anyone comes to visit, tell them I am in seclusion healing my wounds and cannot see anyone. If it is truly urgent, crush this jade talisman."

Li Que'wan knew exactly what her Daoist Master had been doing. She had been worrying on the island for a long time. Understanding completely, she quickly withdrew.

As the great array sealed, Li Ximing descended into the pavilion and shut the doors tightly. All the lights were extinguished, leaving only the purple-gold patterns of the inner array swirling overhead.

Li Ximing reached into his sleeve and took out the pure white spirit stone.

In the dim room, the spirit stone emitted no special light. It looked dull and lifeless, like a mundane object, utterly unremarkable. Li Ximing closed his eyes and began to chant in a low voice:

"Li Clan disciple Ximing, respectfully summons the Immortal Mirror. Patrol the unseen, probe the subtle, pierce the profound, illuminate all directions, capture ghosts and examine spirits..."

*Om...*

As his incantation finished, layers of bright white patterns spread through the air. A trace of the pitch-black Great Void appeared within them, as if a small tear had opened, shining with a clear, bright light.

The light fell upon the spirit stone, refracting into a myriad of colors. It instantly transformed from pure white to crystal clear, and then, in the next moment, the translucent stone vanished from before him, leaving only darkness.

The surroundings were utterly silent.

Li Ximing let out a soft sigh, feeling a sense of loss. But suddenly, something changed.

*BZZZT!*

His expression changed drastically. A cooling sensation spread through his Shengyang Acupoint Mansion. He saw a flash of white light rise up from beneath the layered radiance of his Bright Yang divine ability, forcing the divine ability itself to retreat and revealing a glowing white pellet.

The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed!

The white pellet bloomed from the inside out, expanding infinitely as if being inflated. It filled his entire Shengyang Acupoint from within, then leaped out to envelop the Shengyang Acupoint Mansion itself.

"Here now is a Li Clan disciple, spirit calmed and nature aligned, ascending to divine ability. Through his allotted years, he shall perfect his virtue, enabling him to ascend to heavenly fate, be recorded in the profound register, and attain his true name... Roam the five shadows, walk the Great Void, open the profound brightness, and renew the work of the Dao..."

*DONG!*

He felt his body shrink to an infinitesimal size. Before his eyes, an ancient bronze mirror spanning the Great Void suddenly appeared. Its surface reflected an entire world, with roiling clouds and mist, like a paradise.

Immediately, a chill spread from the back of his head, as if he had fallen into an ice cavern. The cold pierced him, and his spiritual sense blurred. He felt as if he were being drawn deep into the endless Great Void, his mind and form rising infinitely, floating, unaware of his location.

Following that, a two-colored light of yin and yang surged forth. A magnificent world unfolded. He saw a vast land covered in white snow, with clouds towering like mountains. Jade-white immortal palaces stood in neat rows. He also saw an immense, glittering golden lake, its water flowing like liquid gold, shimmering amidst the clouds. It was supported by layers of spiritual light, and across it lay twelve long, graceful bridges.

The world spun, and everything vanished. Finally, his feet touched solid ground. Li Ximing looked up. The floor beneath him was a glowing, jade-white surface. He found himself standing in a brightly lit pavilion.

This was no longer Moongaze Lake!

'What kind of technique is this!'

Li Ximing was terrified, but he didn't dare dwell on it. He quickly observed his surroundings.

The pavilion was a hundred feet square, exceptionally large for such a structure. It was built from grey stone and white jade. The ceiling bore no carvings, just a smooth, translucent white surface. A stone pillar lamp niche stood to his side, casting a gentle glow.

The place was neat and orderly, fully furnished with tables, chairs, tea tables, and meditation cushions, all arranged simply in the corners. It looked as if no one had been here for a long time.

The pavilion was silent, filled with a faint, diffuse light. Li Ximing stood by the wide-open window. He could see a boundless sea of clouds outside and the wondrous sight of the sun and moon shining together, one on the left and one on the right, high in the sky. Far off in the sea of clouds, other pavilions rose and fell, appearing and disappearing in the mist.

As the sea of clouds churned, an incredibly dense wave of Spiritual Qi washed over him, making Li Ximing catch his breath. He watched his surroundings with wary vigilance, not daring to move. His heart pounded.

"This is... This is!"

He had heard the chant clearly: "ascend to heavenly fate," "open the profound brightness," "renew the work of the Dao." Besides the immortal artifact his family had guarded for generations, could some True Monarch be playing a prank on him? Recalling what he had just seen, his heart throbbed with a new realization.

'To think I, a divine ability cultivator, could be moved to another place without even realizing it... Could it be... Could I be inside the world within the Immortal Mirror?'

The Li family's Talisman Seeds all eventually returned to the mirror's body. In ancient times, there were cases of grotto-heaven secret realms being attached to Spiritual Artifacts or Dharma Treasures. As for whether a world existed inside the Immortal Mirror, it was his family's only such treasure, so Li Ximing had no way of knowing.

But years ago, when he was overseas, the Talisman Seed had been triggered, and he had vaguely glimpsed a world just like this. He had been suspicious ever since, and now, he was almost certain.

He hesitated for a long moment before finally stepping forward slowly. He walked to the jade table in the center. Its surface was bright and clear, carved on both sides with patterns of osmanthus flowers and the bright moon. A porcelain-white vase sat in the middle, next to a strange, purplish-black wooden slip.

The items looked as if they had been placed casually. Suspicion grew in Li Ximing's heart, and he didn't touch them. He circled the pavilion once and spotted a token resting on one of the meditation cushions.

The token was about the length of his forearm, pure white, and engraved with beautiful silver-white Supreme Yin patterns. In the center was a flat, circular space, engraved with a simple, ancient seal script character. The moment Li Ximing saw it, he understood.

'Li.'



# Chapter 891: The Heaven Where Sun and Moon Shine as One

Li Ximing lowered his gaze to the token, his pupils widening. He studied it for a long, heavy moment, his heart suspended over a deep abyss, feet dangling, utterly at a loss for words.

'There seems to be no Great Void here... and I can't ride the wind. There must be a restriction... My spiritual sense is also suppressed, limited to my immediate surroundings. I fear there's an extremely terrifying array in place.'

He closed his eyes and first prayed to the Immortal Mirror. After reciting the incantation, he received no response. This only strengthened his suspicion. He dared not move, nor did he dare to leave. He hesitated for a long while before taking a step back and bowing respectfully. Only then did he reach out to take the token.

The token was ice-cold in his hand, its surface smooth and delicate. It was impervious to divine abilities and impenetrable to spiritual sense, just like every fragment of the Immortal Mirror from the past century—and the Immortal Mirror itself. It felt like a common, mortal thing.

Li Ximing held the object, but no strange phenomenon occurred. He carefully cupped it in his hands, turned, and walked to a jade desk within the pavilion. After a moment's thought, he finally picked up the jade bottle to examine it.

The jade bottle's design was unlike those common in Jiangnan. Its neck was slightly elongated, and it lacked any sort of stopper or lid. The body of the bottle was a pure, clean white, faintly inscribed with several vertical lines.

His spiritual sense, naturally, could not penetrate it. He could only set the bottle upright and peer in from the top. Inside, layer upon layer of mist swirled, sinking and floating, suffused with a vivid, hazy-blue color.

Li Ximing focused, sensing it carefully, and was surprised to detect a trace of familiarity. He closed his eyes slightly, a jolt passing through his heart.

"Talisman Qi..."

Although he had never seen it in this form, the feeling was intensely familiar. Li Ximing hesitated for only an instant. The various incantations of the Sacrificial Method flooded his mind, followed immediately by an electrifying jolt, a realization that struck like thunder.

'A Purple Mansion Realm Azure Talisman!'

Li Ximing had considered this possibility long ago, but Purple Mansion Realm Demon beasts were incredibly difficult to find. To this day, the Li family had only encountered that one white elephant, and it was treacherous and cunning. They had yet to find a single Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast that was an easy target.

'With this, could Li Zhouwei's Talisman Qi problem finally be solved?!'

Although Li Ximing himself had received his talisman before reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, he had since experienced the agonizingly slow pace of cultivating divine abilities at this new stage. He had long grown nostalgic for his Foundation Establishment Realm days, when a single strand of Talisman Qi could boost him an entire layer. He couldn't use this, but Li Zhouwei was currently in seclusion, breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. This Azure Talisman could finally turn their theoretical plans into reality!

With the bottle right in front of him, he could only suck in a sharp, excited breath, his hands nearly starting to tremble. He observed it minutely, terrified he might somehow taint the spiritual object just by holding it, and quickly placed it back on the desk.

His gaze-reluctantly pulled away from the porcelain-white bottle. Only then did he turn to the purple-black, sandalwood-like wooden slips. He gently opened them. They were completely empty, revealing only a smooth, blank surface.

Li Ximing quickly set the slips down. After careful consideration, he picked up only the token. Growing bolder, he began to search the pavilion, opening every long cabinet, small chest, and ornate box, leaving no corner unexamined.

However, he found nothing. He did find one small coffer at the bottom of a cabinet, which contained a half-full set of five bottles filled with an unused, pale greenish-white gas. He didn't know what it was, but when Li Ximing probed it with his spiritual sense, he determined it was some form of Spiritual Qi, not a cultivation resource.

He carefully put the coffer back. After circling the room one last time, he returned to the white jade lampstand, studying its cold, moon-like radiance. He hesitated for a moment, but ultimately didn't dare lift the lampshade to see what kind of oil fueled it. Feigning casualness, he strode past it and arrived at the pavilion door.

Through the crack in the door, he could see a long, covered corridor beyond the courtyard. It was lined with six white jade lamp pillars, each emitting that same cold radiance. The far end of the corridor split into two paths, both vanishing into overlapping banks of clouds and mist.

"Creeaak."

Li Ximing pushed the door open and stepped out. The movement swept aside the mist near the doorway, revealing gray stone steps. In the silent immortal palace, the sound of the door echoed, reverberating through the mist before finally dissipating into the dense, folding clouds.

'It's so quiet.'

"Tap."

He took a step down, his gaze sweeping low over the gray stone. He noticed barely perceptible array patterns etched into the steps. They were dim and lightless, and he couldn't tell if they were active, though a faint white light pulsed within them.

The sound of his footsteps echoed. The corridor was not particularly long. As he walked, another pavilion emerged from the mist. It was similar in design to the first but taller, perhaps three stories high, with sharp, high-peaked eaves. A plaque hung above the entrance, bearing two characters:

High Firmament

Li Ximing pushed the door open and entered. The first floor was completely empty, save for a white jade lamp in each of the four corners and a single stone pedestal in the center.

The pedestal was no higher than his waist. It was carved with images of the Supreme Yin, a setting moon, and patterns of undulating clouds. A rectangular socket was recessed into its center, glowing with a soft, clear light in the dim pavilion.

A staircase at the side led to the second floor. Li Ximing ascended, his mind heavy with thought.

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's eyesight was sharp. He could easily see traces of restrictive arrays on the staircase leading to the second floor, but for some unknown reason, they were inactive, lying dormant.

The second floor was nearly identical to the one below, only slightly smaller. It also had an open window, which let in a little more light. Li Ximing gave it a cursory glance and continued upward.

The highest floor was smaller still. The light from the four lamps crisscrossed in the space. In the center, there was no pedestal; instead, a blue-green jade meditation cushion rested on the floor. In front of it sat a square bronze incense burner, containing a shallow layer of old ash.

As soon as he arrived, the token in Li Ximing's hand began to glow faintly, as if it had finally found what it was looking for.

Li Ximing hurried forward. The surface of the blue-green jade cushion was covered in densely packed, minuscule characters that looked like a decorative pattern from afar. Although the script was ancient, the moment his spiritual sense touched it, the meaning flooded his mind.

*The Art of the Talisman Grotto and Immortality*

Immediately, the contents of the cultivation method surged into his mind. The very first section was the Dharma Art he had read so long ago:

The Initiation Method.

This Dharma Art, used to seek a Talisman Seed, flashed by in an instant. It was naturally followed by the art used to seek Talisman Qi: the Sacrificial Method.

As this Dharma Art swept past his mind's eye, a third and final part unexpectedly emerged:

The Ascension Method!

This spell art was unlike anything Li Ximing had ever seen. It primarily described how to use this very jade cushion to elevate one's Talisman Seed, "open the Profound Radiance," and ascend to the heavens. Once there, one had to report one's duties and be judged on merits at scheduled times, all in pursuit of the Dao...

'Talisman Seed... This is undoubtedly the art bestowed by the Immortal Mirror!'

Li Ximing had only scanned it for a moment, but he understood from the spell art's description that its cultivator must not only possess a Talisman Seed, but must also first "Inscribe the Profound Register and Ascend the True Name." Only then could one "open the Profound Radiance" and travel to the "heavens" as a soul to make contact with the various wondrous and ineffable Great Daos.

Li Ximing was extremely familiar with this requirement. He himself had "Inscribed the Profound Register and Ascended his True Name" before even coming here. This meant he was currently capable of using the final technique of *The Art of the Talisman Grotto and Immortality*—the Ascension Method.

'The immortal art inheritance that my family has relied on to rise... it must have originated from this very place!'

He immediately dropped to his knees and kowtowed deeply before the cushion, performing the rites due to a master. He held the bow for a long time before finally rising.

He had been hit with too much information at once. He took a moment to steady his mind, then turned his complicated gaze to the incense burner. On the side of the square bronze vessel, a few small characters were engraved:

'Secret Vault Profound Seven Pavilion of the Saintly Purity Palace'

Li Ximing began to ponder.

'This place should be the High Firmament Pavilion. I wonder what its relationship is to the Secret Vault Profound Seven Pavilion of the Saintly Purity Palace. Or perhaps this incense burner simply came from there... It's likely related to the 'heavens' this art speaks of...'

Li Ximing studied the burner for a moment, a connection forming in his mind. As if struck by a realization, he descended to the first floor of the High Firmament Pavilion, pushed open the door, and stepped out. He returned a moment later, this time holding the purple-black wooden slips.

He unrolled the slips. They formed a perfect rectangle. He held them up, comparing their shape to the socket, and nodded to himself. He placed the wooden codex into the recess on the pedestal. It was a perfect fit, seamless.

The pedestal and the slips, both of which had felt like mortal objects, finally changed. The instant his spiritual sense touched them, a torrent of information streamed into him. Li Ximing closed his eyes as a veritable ocean of scriptures flooded his mind.

'*Song of Cleansing Snow*, *Floating Cloud Heart Sutra*, *Profound Geng Sword Art*... *Cang River Source-Seeking Art*, *Pheasant Fire Endurance Art*...'

Li Ximing's eyes snapped open in realization.

"These are all Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation methods!"

An innumerable, truly shocking number of cultivation methods flashed through his mind. Li Ximing reviewed them all and noticed a detail.

"These names are either bright or dim... It seems there's a difference."

He experimented, first focusing his intent on a dim title, the *Song of Cleansing Snow*. As expected, nothing happened. He then shifted his focus to a shining one, the *Profound Geng Sword Art*.

Immediately, bright golden characters materialized on the wooden slips embedded in the pedestal. The core tenets of the sword art appeared, flowing across the surface like liquid light.

Li Ximing didn't dare waste time reading it. His heart thumping with excitement, he immediately retrieved the slips, bounded up the stairs to the second-floor pedestal, and embedded the purple-black codex into its socket. He plunged his spiritual sense into it.

"Bzzz!"

An equally vast number of cultivation methods surged forth, but far fewer of them were illuminated. Almost instantly, Li Ximing spotted the very art he himself cultivated: the *Radiant Essence Scripture*!

"It really did come from here! The immortal arts, the cultivation methods... all of them originate from this High Firmament Pavilion!"

Appearing alongside it were Li Jiangqian's *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun* and Li Que'wan's *Golden Book of Houshu*. Although most of the cultivation methods on this level were dim, apart from these three arts used by the Li family, there were quite a few other Purple Mansion Realm methods.

'The Purple Qi art, *Heavenly Cultivation Purple Scripture*... the Jade True art, *True Jade Union with the Void*... the True Qi art, *Huai River Deity Transformation Book*...'

Li Ximing scanned the list. In addition to these Purple Mansion Realm cultivation methods, he even found several spell arts!

'They're fifth-rank spell arts... It seems only spell arts of the fifth rank and higher are considered Purple Mansion Realm-level. That matches what we know in Jiangnan.'

Overseas, Purple Mansion Realm cultivators generally only use fourth-rank spell arts; only a few of the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions possess fifth-rank ones. He wondered if seventh-rank spell arts even existed, as it was said the highest-ranking spell arts in all of Jiangnan were only sixth-rank.

He let out a long breath. Observing them, he noted that these standalone spell arts were all of a nature that wouldn't easily conflict with other Daoist traditions. There was even one extremely rare spell art for Pure Qi.

Li Ximing couldn't help but ponder:

'Fifth-rank spell arts are too difficult, and I don't have the Dao attainment or talent to master them all. When I have the chance, I'll master one or two, and use fourth-rank ones to fill the gaps... I should just get *one* to use first. After all, not even all overseas Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have a full set of fourth-rank arts.'

Thus, he didn't spend any more time examining the spell arts. He paused, turned, and exited from the first floor of the High Firmament Pavilion. Back in the corridor, he walked past the pavilion and, as he expected, found a path leading downward.

As he descended the steps, the mist began to thin. He soon realized he was on a mountaintop, bathed in the simultaneous light of the moon and the morning sun. He gazed at the terrifying, alien sight of both sun and moon hanging in the sky, then quickly lowered his head.

At the base of the path was an immortal courtyard, with four side-buildings enclosing a central patio. Faint array patterns were visible everywhere, and a formation seemed to be operating silently. Li Ximing walked all the way to the main courtyard gate before he finally scented a trace of danger.

He stopped short, sensing the air carefully. The dangerous aura felt strangely familiar. An instant later, he realized why:

"A Great Prohibition Array! One that's above the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Li Ximing quickly retreated a step. He looked up, his gaze sweeping from the phenomenon of the sun and moon in the sky to the faintly flickering patterns on the immortal pavilion itself. He finally understood.

"This entire world is under the shroud of a Great Prohibition Array! The only reason I was safe and completely unaware of it was because this immortal pavilion's own array is constantly running, protecting the area within it and allowing movement!"

Although the sense of danger from just beyond the gate felt heavy rather than lethal, Li Ximing knew exactly what this place was. His heart pounding with lingering fear, he quickly retreated.

'This territory isn't small, and the spiritual essence is incredibly rich... Pingya Island's Spiritual Qi is already considered passable, but it's nothing compared to this. If I could cultivate here, coming and going as I please, my progress would be doubled with half the effort!'

'And I must remember, the "heavens" mentioned on the jade cushion isn't this place where the High Firmament Pavilion is. Rather, one must be in this "Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance," where the pavilion is located, *in order* to reach the "heavens"!'

'And this High Firmament Pavilion is completely empty. It's probably a Grotto-Heaven. The outside is locked by a Great Prohibition Array... Doesn't that mean it's here for my family to use?'

'A world within the Mirror... If disciples could travel back and forth... storing secrets... it would be so convenient for the family...'

Hope surged in Li Ximing's heart. But hope was one thing; as the initial joy receded, a deep-seated unease grew thicker.

It was simple. Although the spiritual essence here was rich, it was strangely and completely cut off from the Great Void, like a cage. Li Ximing had been pulled into this place with no way out. The outside world was in turmoil! Was he, Li Ximing, supposed to just stay here forever?

He searched the area several times, eyes tightly closed, trying repeatedly to contact the Immortal Mirror, all to no avail. He had no choice but to return to the High Firmament Pavilion. He bowed before the jade cushion once more and stared at its text.

'Open the Profound Radiance, ascend to the heavens, report duties and merits on schedule, to seek the Dao...'

'Right now... it seems the only path left is to activate the Ascension Method...'

He steadied his mind. He lifted his sleeve, withdrew three sticks of incense, and planted them in the bronze burner. With a wave of his hand, he lit them, then settled himself cross-legged onto the jade meditation cushion.

As he chanted the incantation and formed the hand seals, the jade cushion beneath him began to glow. A golden light flowed over the tiny characters, transforming them into golden runes that detached and began to dance around his body, emitting a hazy, elegant light.

Compared to the violent, world-spinning, bone-chilling sensation of first *entering* this Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, Li Ximing felt relatively little. An entire stick of incense burned to ash. The golden runes surrounding him grew more and more numerous, then suddenly surged as one into his Shengyang Acupoint. At the exact same moment, he finished the final line of the incantation. He felt a blinding flash of light, and his soul was pulled free, flying into an infinite void, drifting weightlessly.

His vision went dark and then brightened again, revealing a world of swirling clouds.

"This..."

This time, Li Ximing was truly standing on solid, thick clouds. There was no pavilion, no sun or moon, and certainly no mountain peak. As far as he could see, there was only a boundless white expanse beneath his feet.

He glanced down and saw his legs half-submerged in the mist, flickering in and out of view with a translucent quality. All his divine abilities, his dharma power, and even the solid, physical sense of his body had vanished. All that remained was his soul, standing alone in the clouds.

'It really ignored the Shengyang Acupoint and just snatched my soul... Right now, if even a Qi Refining cultivator showed up... a single spell art could kill me... In the current world... besides the Underworld, who else has this power over souls...'

He forcefully suppressed the terror rising in his heart and peered into the distance. Only then did he spot pavilions, faint and flickering in the distant cloud layers, seemingly built upon the mist itself. Looking even further, he could see a familiar, heaven-piercing golden light.

'So those immortal-realm-like vistas... *this* is the "heavens"!'

Li Ximing [Early Purple Mansion Realm] [Purple Mansion Realm Alchemist]



# Chapter 892: Registering the Name

Grotto-heaven.

The Moon Laurel swayed gently, faint silver light echoing beneath the tree. A bone-chilling wind swept across a white jade platform suspended between heaven and earth.

Lu Jiangxian slowly raised his hand, projecting the reflection of an ancient bronze mirror from the Great Void.

The mirror was no larger than his palm, encircled by a dark, metallic border. Intricate patterns converged at its base, where a gemstone as bright as a star was inlaid.

'This piece from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition... it's not a mirror fragment.'

The gemstone from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition was actually part of the mirror's body. It was called the Name Ascending Stone. Inlaid upon the mirror, they were originally one and the same. This was the origin of the saying: "Inscribed on the Profound Register, registering the True Name"!

The command Li Ximing had heard didn't come from nowhere. It was precisely because this treasure had returned, causing the Immortal Mirror's divine power to surge, that a new change had occurred.

The Name Ascending Stone had a pleasant name, but its function was extremely tyrannical. If someone relaxed their mind and was struck by its profound light, a trace of their True Spirit would be registered upon the Name Ascending Stone, never to be erased. If they possessed a Talisman Seed, they could then use this to ascend into the World within the Mirror.

But if a person's True Spirit was registered on the Name Ascending Stone *without* them having received a Talisman Seed, they would not only be bound just as tightly, but they would also lose all control over their thoughts, life, and death. They would be completely at the mercy of the Immortal Artifact's master, all while receiving none of the Talisman Seed's benefits.

And though such people could fly into the World within the Mirror, they had no choice in the matter. The moment they were summoned, they would lose their soul, slamming headlong into the Name Ascending Stone.

Of course, even if a person was unwilling to relax their mind, it made no difference. So long as their physical body was destroyed in the presence of the Immortal Artifact—exposing their Shengyang Acupoint—and they attempted to reincarnate using methods like the Diverse Mansion or Buddhist Attainment, their True Spirit would be exposed for a brief instant. In that moment, the Name Ascending Stone's profound light would capture it. The end result was the same.

And if a person's soul and body entered the mirror willingly, it was like walking straight into a trap. They would be instantly bound to the Name Ascending Stone, with no hope of washing the mark away.

'How tyrannical... I can't tell if this is an Immortal Artifact or a Demonic Artifact...'

Lu Jiangxian reviewed these divine properties one by one. Thinking of the abilities of the Talisman Seed and the Talisman Pill, he realized they truly stemmed from the same source. He couldn't afford to relax his guard for a moment.

'If this Immortal Artifact were introduced to the world, the Talisman Seed could be given to capable subordinates, while everyone else could be registered with the Name Ascending Stone. Couldn't one raise batch after batch of loyal manpower that way?'

As he pondered this, a doubt arose.

'If that so-called "past life" of mine had this ability, why would he have complained that the cultivators under the Moonlight Origin Mansion were not united? Why would he even *need* them to be united? Just register their names, draw their souls into the mirror, and all their little schemes would be useless...'

It wasn't just that. His doubts about the Immortal Mirror were growing.

"The Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition's legacy comes from the Jiangbei Wanling Upper Sect. But the Wanling Upper Sect's Daoist tradition was already broken back when the Moonlight Origin Mansion still existed in the world... Doesn't that mean this thing fell into the hands of the Wanling Upper Sect long ago? How could the Immortal Mirror in the hands of my 'past life' have been complete?"

The master of the Moonlight Origin Mansion definitely had this Immortal Mirror. He was said to be an unrivaled master of formations and talismans, with few opponents in the world. If not an Immortal Lord, he must have at least reached the Dao Embryo realm!

"The Immortal Mirror can sense its own fragments. With his power, wouldn't entering and exiting the Secret Diffusion Grotto-heaven have been child's play? He could have just taken it... This means... I am still within a plot he laid."

Lu Jiangxian could only fall silent, studying the mirror.

'The Name Ascending Stone has a limited range and also relies on the Talisman Seed. The range of one's divine sense is a given, but for anyone outside that range to register their name in the mortal world, their soul must connect upward or downward with the Name Ascending Stone. This requires a Talisman Seed to act as a receiver, preventing detection by others. After all, only the Talisman Seed has this kind of responsive power. This part isn't difficult. I have a surplus of Talisman Seeds right now, and it's not like one person occupies one slot. It just needs to respond and connect at the right time. Placing a few inside should be more than enough!'

Lu Jiangxian currently had twelve Talisman Seeds. Eight were with the Li family, leaving four in his hand. His supply was dwindling, but it was still sufficient. He could place a minimum of one inside and still have three available for use.

He stretched out his hand. Four white pellets connected end-to-end and flew into the Name Ascending Stone for its use. Only then did he turn his gaze back to the Great Void.

'The Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition... was actually preserved...'

Because the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was ambushed by Buddhist cultivators, the platform Tinglan had established in Jiangbei had also collapsed. The old scene of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition swarming in to carve up immortal resources within the Grotto-heaven was no more... To put it bluntly, in past years, it was a trade with Luoxia. The Grotto-heaven's descent was Luoxia's compensation to the Supreme Yang. Now, they were just running errands for Luoxia for free. They had suffered casualties and gained almost no benefits.

Now, the True Monarchs in the Great Void had departed, and Jiangbei was not as dangerous as before. Lu Jiangxian observed this, sensing that something was wrong.

'What's more, although the Golden Feather Sect is under Luoxia's jurisdiction, many within it have dissenting hearts. In the past, they constantly flirted with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, trying to curry favor. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was also eager to stabilize the Golden Feather Sect. But now, they've blatantly abandoned the Golden Tang Gate, breaking their tacit understanding with the Azure Pond... It seems Jiangbei is still turbulent with hidden currents...'

He waved his hand, dispersing the phantom image. With a flick of his wrist, the Name Ascending Stone flared with brilliant light. Several white talismans drifted out from it, each moving as if it had a spirit of its own, hanging themselves on the branches of the Moon Laurel.

'Jinlian, Five-Eyed, Buzi...'

The white talisman for Jinlian flipped over, revealing Dangjiang on its back. Although that Maha Jinlian had only come once and had his soul split, this trace of his True Spirit couldn't escape. His connection to the World within the Mirror was now even deeper than the others'.

Although Jinlian had healed his physical injuries, the damage to his soul was not so easily mended. He must have used some unknown spiritual medicine in secret, as he no longer looked like someone suffering from a missing part of their soul.

'I don't need any restrictions now. With a single thought, be it Five-Eyed or Jinlian, they have well and truly fallen into my hands.'

Lu Jiangxian took advantage of the situation, opening up a pavilion in the Grotto-heaven for the Li family to use. His mind settled, he thought:

"I'll use this opportunity to establish contact and pass down the method for acquiring cultivation arts, along with that immortal's abode."

...

Secret Vault Profound Seven Pavilion of the Saintly Purity Palace.

Clouds of mist drifted through a bright courtyard where ancient trees stood tall. A youth with pale turquoise eyes leaned against a branch, a token hanging from his waist. He held a scroll in one hand, reading intently, while sipping from a silver flask in the other, appearing completely at ease.

At the base of the tree, two attendants waited, stacks of books in their arms, standing as still as statues. After a while, the light on a jade table nearby began to flicker, emitting a low hum.

The youth shot up like a startled cat, leaping from the tree in an instant. With two quick movements, he landed by the table, tossing the silver flask aside with a loud clatter. Overjoyed, he shouted:

"Which fellow Daoist has come to visit!"

With Immortal Official Liu having descended to the lower realm and no word from Chi Buzi, life these past few years had been miserable for him, Dangjiang. He immediately bolted, kicked open the door, and strode out. He didn't even bother closing the courtyard gate, taking several large strides forward until he was among the clouds, where he squinted, searching intently.

Standing in the clouds was a Daoist in pale golden robes. His features were regular, though not handsome. If not for a small, bright mark flickering between his brows, he would not have seemed special at all.

The youth hurried forward and smiled.

"This humble one is Dangjiang. Greetings, fellow Daoist! Might I ask which Immortal Palace you hail from?"

Li Ximing, suddenly faced with this person, did not dare to be disrespectful. He quickly moved to greet him and replied:

"This humble one is... Zhaojing..."

As for which Immortal Palace, Li Ximing naturally couldn't answer. But just as he said this, he suddenly remembered something, and his expression changed. He thought:

'...Dangjiang...'

'Dangjiang? The Immortal Official of the Dangjiang River Palace, serving under the Immortal Lord!'

When Chi Buzi left the Li family all those years ago, the family had heard this name. Li Qinghong later met Chi Buzi again and heard that this Dangjiang was supposedly already dead. He didn't know if this was the same person...

'It can't be that this Dangjiang *is* Chi Buzi, can it...'

Li Ximing hadn't been present when Dangjiang was at the Li estate; he had only heard secondhand accounts. Now, meeting him face-to-face, Li Ximing didn't dare assume, and Dangjiang certainly didn't recognize Li Ximing. The youth was simply crying tears of joy.

"Finally, another living voice!"

Dangjiang looked Li Ximing up and down, asking enthusiastically:

"Fellow Daoist, are you... a soul?"

Li Ximing quickly cupped his hands and replied:

"Reporting to the Immortal Official, this junior received guidance in the lower realm and ascended to the Heavens. I am currently completely bewildered and cannot make sense of my surroundings..."

"Someone from the lower realm?!"

Dangjiang's expression changed instantly. Although he was only a Collator, this entire area was managed by Shaohui. Something major must have happened. His gaze burned with intensity as he replied:

"How rare! Why don't you come with me to see the Lord!"

He then smacked his forehead, as if suddenly realizing.

"My apologies, my apologies. I must find a body for you first."

He led Li Ximing back into the courtyard. The two attendants came forward to greet them. Dangjiang nonchalantly grabbed one and held him fast, grinning.

"This attendant has an empty body; his soul isn't present. His Dharma Body isn't weak, either. He's the most suitable!"

Li Ximing examined him closely, but his heart was filled with doubt. A physical body was not something to be taken lightly. If this was a trap, the loss would be fatal!

He secretly called out to the Immortal Mirror, intending to probe the attendant. But who could have known? The moment he uttered the incantation, streams of white light burst forth from his soul. A Profound Pearl Talisman Seed appeared out of thin air. A shock like a bucket of cold water washed over him as the Talisman Seed *actually transformed* into a physical body.

This body was identical to his own. Even the pale golden Daoist robes materialized from nothing, draping over his form.

He stood firm in the courtyard, feeling his various divine abilities re-attaching to his Dharma Body. He finally felt solid, grounded. His Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities had returned.

"Huu..."

He let out a breath, his confidence returning. Dangjiang's eyes darted, sensing something unusual. He exclaimed in admiration:

"Fellow Daoist, you actually have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation... No wonder you have such bearing! May I ask which territory in the lower realm you come from, and which family?"

Li Ximing bowed slightly. He sensed an object in his sleeve. Focusing his mind, he saw that the token from the pavilion was now tucked inside his cuff. He replied:

"This humble cultivator's surname is Li. I cultivate on a small lake."

The moment he finished speaking, Dangjiang's expression changed dramatically. His eyes went wide, his face a mask of disbelief and sudden joy. He stammered:

"Do you have... a token? A token of identity?!"

Li Ximing lifted his sleeve and took out the token. When Dangjiang saw the character 'Li' on it, his eyes immediately reddened. His lips trembled as he cried out:

"It really is Li... Fellow Daoist, you've made me suffer!"

He had been grumbling about 'Immortal Official Li' for who knows how long, and now someone with the surname Li had finally arrived. He began to pour out his grievances:

"Lord Li went down to the lower realm to reincarnate and face his trials, leaving me to manage all the affairs of this palace! How can I possibly handle it all? The scrolls and books are piled up like mountains..."

"Thankfully, Lord Liu... has taken good care of me, giving me an errand or two to keep me entertained. Otherwise, I would have worked myself to death!"

Hearing this, Li Ximing's mind buzzed.

'Reincarnation? What reincarnation? Could it be... me?'

The Li family had long speculated about the Immortal Mirror's origins. Now that the Immortal Mirror also contained a Grotto-heaven secret realm, its background seemed even more profound. The Supreme Yin Moon Radiance that had gushed forth every night back then pointed directly to that revered Immortal Mansion!

The person Dangjiang spoke of was undoubtedly the Immortal Mirror's previous master. Hearing the words 'reincarnate and face trials,' Li Ximing almost immediately locked onto a suspect.

'It must be Li Jiangqun, who was besieged and killed by the great families all those years ago! That pavilion, that small courtyard... they must have been left by him. And the Moonlight Origin Mansion inheritance he obtained is probably inextricably linked to the heavens!'

He looked at Dangjiang, who was sighing with deep resentment, and immediately cupped his hands.

"I'm afraid the Immortal Official is mistaken. My family has worshiped an Immortal Artifact for generations, which is how we gained the opportunity to walk the Daoist path again. We don't know any Immortal Official. I myself am just a minor cultivator."

The joy that had just ignited in Dangjiang was extinguished in an instant. He froze for a moment.

"It's not you..."

Logically, the person before him had no reason to lie. Dangjiang's heart sank as he mused inwardly:

'If it's not you... it must at least be your family. Some ancestor, someone from the heavens. They get to go down to the lower realm and have fun, while I'm stuck here toiling like an animal!'

His gaze then fell on the aura of Bright Yang on Li Ximing, and he finally realized.

'He cultivates Bright Yang... It seems he's similar to Chi Buzi. Chi Buzi is trapped beneath the Pristine Water, but this one is in an even more awkward position...'

'First, there was a Chi Buzi, and now a Bright Yang Zhaojing... Whose Fruition Attainment are they trying to shake? The great lords in the heavens... they are playing a very big game!'

He felt a cold, sharp thrill at his own deduction and, for a moment, forgot to speak. Just then, a stream of light flowed through the clouds. A streak of color shot down and materialized in the courtyard as an Immortal General.

The Immortal General was clad in silver-white armor and wore a sword at his side. His presence made Dangjiang forget everything else and immediately kowtow. The Immortal General, however, stopped when he saw Li Ximing and smiled.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. As he looked, he found the general's sharp eyes and brows intensely familiar. He was so taken aback he almost cried out.

'Such a strong resemblance!'

Fortunately, he had excellent control over his emotions and showed little reaction. He followed suit and bowed, returning the greeting. The Immortal General smiled.

"I am the Supreme Yin's Luminous Immortal General, Zhengao. Congratulations, fellow Daoist! I received an order from the Supreme Yin Immortal Palace. It said an Immortal Official's command token had activated, signaling a return to position. The Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance has reopened, so I came to meet you."

Li Ximing quickly bowed. Dangjiang remained kneeling, motionless. Zhengao turned and led Li Ximing away, speaking softly:

"The Immortal Palace has been sealed, and the heavens never interfere in the affairs of the mortal world; everything is decided by the Immortal Artifact. We should not have brought you up here. However, the Immortal Order for the High Firmament Pavilion contained a remnant left by Immortal Official Li, which you have now received. That is why this trip was necessary."

"That Immortal Order for the High Firmament Pavilion has already been registered in the heavens. When you return, fellow Daoist, you will be able to freely enter and exit the High Firmament Pavilion."

Joy sparked in Li Ximing. The benefits of a Grotto-heaven were immense; no family would ever have too many, but he hadn't dared to hope for it. He expressed his thanks, but before he could say more, Zhengao continued:

"The Immortal Palace has not yet manifested in the world. After these seven days, it will be sealed once more. Since you were fated to inherit this Immortal Order, it contains the Immortal Merits you all have accumulated over the years. It also corresponds to the Profound Seven Pavilion. If you require cultivation arts, you can request them from the High Firmament Pavilion."

"This Immortal Order holds three hundred and fifty-seven Immortal Merits. It has already been used to exchange for several Purple Mansion Realm-level spell arts, which you can view. As for sacrificing demons, eliminating devils, and suppressing divergent Daos—all are sources of Immortal Merits. For those in the lower realm, this is a significant opportunity."

Li Ximing quietly breathed a sigh of relief. He listened as Zhengao said:

"Just be careful. When the heavens close, this token means you are occupying Immortal Official Li's position. Do not let anyone at the True Monarch level see it, or it will cost you your life."

Li Ximing had experienced too much in one day. For a moment, he didn't know what to feel, as if he were in a dream. He only lowered his voice and said:

"I will obey the revered Immortal's command!"

Zhengao finished and said sternly:

"One last thing: the affairs of the heavens must not be leaked. You must all strive hard in the lower realm. If the day comes when you ascend to Fruition Attainment and become a True Monarch, you will have the chance to ascend as an immortal and we shall meet again."

# Chapter 893: Tianhuo

Li Ximing didn't believe any talk of achieving the True Monarch realm or forging a Golden Core. If anyone had a chance, it was Li Zhouwei or Li Que'wan. He'd be burning high incense just to reach the Purple Mystery realm.

He just bowed and said, "I dare not hope for the Golden Core. I only wish for this junior to have some promise, so as not to lose our inheritance."

Hearing this, Zhengao paused, a hint of melancholy in his eyes. He turned away, silent for a moment. In the distance, a palace maid hurried over, holding a jade box.

He sighed. "There are many good things left in the High Firmament Pavilion. He also left items behind, entrusted to the heavens. Take them all back with you. Consider it accepting this karmic connection."

As the items were presented, Li Ximing bowed again and again, thanking him profusely, but he did not rise. He bowed and asked, "This junior has merely received an ancestor's legacy. Might I ask if that immortal official was Daoist Master Donghua?"

The Li clan had obtained the Immortal Mirror long ago and had harbored this suspicion. Now, he finally voiced it, his heart pounding. He watched from the corner of his eye and saw that at the mention of this name, Dangjiang, who was also kneeling, was already weeping, his sobs unstoppable.

A chill went down his spine. 'It must be him... This Immortal Official Dangjiang toiled day and night for Daoist Master Donghua. Daoist Master Donghua even recorded his pavilion's name on the censer. Now, just hearing the name, Dangjiang is overcome, tears streaming down his face. Daoist Master Donghua must have had significant standing in the heavens! That must be why... this immortal general, who clearly holds a high position, came to greet me personally!'

Dangjiang's heartbreaking sobs made even Zhengao sigh.

'Can I even say no?' he thought. 'It's not like I can point to anyone else for you. Am I supposed to say it was your Ancestor Mutian?'

So, Zhengao put on a solemn expression and sighed deeply. "Cherish it well."

With that, he waved his sleeve, and Li Ximing dissolved into a stream of light. Zhengao turned, exasperated. Dangjiang was a wreck, stretching out his hands and crying, "It has been so long since I've seen you, milord! I have missed you dearly! I have kept your teachings in mind. These hands have not stopped transcribing cultivation manuals for a single day!"

That's what he said, but in his mind, he was chanting:

'Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun... Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun... It really was you... Still no news, and I still have to work like an ox. My life is bitter!'

Zhengao's head buzzed from listening to his thoughts. Frustrated, he maintained his imposing demeanor and offered some comfort. "I know your hardship. You have always been the one managing Immortal Official Li's affairs. It is a good sign that someone from the Lower Realm has arrived. It means the restrictions on the Immortal Residence are gradually lifting..."

"Immortal Official Li's position has remained vacant. This Zhaojing won't be able to ascend for many days, and he may not have the chance in the future. But his old position—exterminating Demons in the Lower Realm and policing unorthodox paths—could be of great benefit to you!"

Dangjiang looked up, overjoyed, but his face was still tear-streaked.

"This lowly one is not greedy, nor am I complaining! I am only grateful that milord always remembers me. I will never forget! I will redouble my efforts..."

To his credit, he was indeed diligent. While he couldn't transcribe Purple Mansion Realm-level scrolls like Lu Jiangxian, he hadn't slacked off on Foundation Establishment Realm or Qi Refining texts. His breadth was far greater than Shaohui's, who specialized only in Lesser Yin.

He (Lu Jiangxian) now comforted him, "This place is also harsh. If you need anything... feel free to ask Shaohui."

Lu Jiangxian had just finished speaking when he heard the man's irrepressible inner voice:

'Are there... are there any immortal cows in the heavens? I'm dying for some milk...'

The thought was so jarring that Lu Jiangxian immediately dispersed into the wind, utterly exasperated.

'I should have known he was like this... He brought Jinlian's bad habits to the heavens! Still thinking about boiling milk to drink!'

***

High Firmament Pavilion.

The four high lamp pillars blazed. The Daoist Master in the white-gold robes slowly opened his eyes.

Li Ximing felt the world spin. He was back in the High Firmament Pavilion. The celestial sights vanished like a dream, his soul returned to his Shengyang Acupoint, and only the sun-and-moon light of the High Firmament Pavilion remained.

The three incense sticks in the censer had just burned out, their ashes drooping inside. A jade box sat directly in front of him.

'It was like a dream... It truly was Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun.'

'But even if he was a Sword Immortal, even if he alone could suppress any Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in Jiangnan and was on good terms with every young cultivator of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... he was still besieged and killed at Moongaze Lake. My clan is nothing compared to him. We must be even more cautious.'

He rose and picked up the jade box, studying it. It was unadorned, pure white as snow, and felt as if it might melt in his hand at any moment.

He opened it gently, and a wave of frigid air rushed out, plunging the pavilion into a sudden chill. He looked inside and saw a scroll and a small, fingernail-sized pearl.

The scroll depicted a white sparrow, wings spread as if about to take flight, startlingly lifelike. Six large characters were written beside it:
*Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity*.

Li Ximing examined it closely. The base of the painting was filled with densely packed text describing a cultivation method and its associated spell arts. He probed it with his spiritual sense. The *Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity* was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method of the Lesser Yin attribute. It allowed one to condense the 'All-Fragrance Sinks' Divine Ability and came complete with spell arts, movement techniques, and escape arts.

Although the *Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity* was written by Shaohui, Shaohui had once been a Demon King from beyond the seas. Some of her habits and techniques were bound to be noticed. Lu Jiangxian had modified it after receiving it. It now radiated an ancient air, reminiscent of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao in its nascent form.

Li Ximing nodded in delight. He placed the scroll back in the box and then looked at the token in his hand. It was indeed glowing with a silver light.

'From now on, this place is my clan's treasure trove. Talisman Pills, clan histories, spell artifacts, and incredible cultivation methods... I'll hide them all in here.'

He put the scroll away and took out the small, fingernail-sized pearl. As he sensed it, a scene gradually appeared in his spiritual sense.

He saw familiar, churning vermilion-green seawater, a narrow strait, and rolling mountain ranges. Li Ximing studied it.

'It seems to be somewhere in the Strait of Ten Thousand Isles... near Lulai Island...'

As his perspective sank, a deep blue glow emerged, revealing a cave residence hidden within the earth veins. Its gates were sealed tight, showing no sign of life.

'A Purple Mansion Grand Formation... It must be someone's cave residence.'

Li Ximing memorized the location, stored the pearl back in the jade box, and headed to the next floor.

'There are still Purple Mansion Realm cultivation methods and spell arts here!'

He took out the wooden slips again, inserted them into the stone platform, and began to browse.

He didn't browse randomly. After a careful search, he found a Purple Mansion Realm method for the World's Radiance lineage. The lowest-level one was the *Clear-Through Eternal Celebration Scripture*, but its name was greyed out.

'According to the token's description, as long as the clan's disciples make offerings, new cultivation methods will eventually be bestowed. But to request a *specific* one, you must first pray by the censer in the High Firmament Pavilion and send a talisman to the heavens. You then have to wait for a response. With the heavens sealed, who knows how long that would take, or who would even respond...'

'Besides, it's too expensive. Purple Smoke already has the World's Radiance Daoist tradition, so it would be more reasonable to get it from her. No need to go through all this trouble. I should focus on exterminating Demons, see how many immortal merits I can earn, and exchange them for something else.'

After his experience in the heavens, Li Ximing understood that most of the lit-up  Arts here had been exchanged by that Immortal Official Li. Of the fifth-rank spell arts, aside from the *Water-Guiding Transformation Scripture* of the Pit Water attribute, which he was not skilled in, three remained: the Pure Qi art *Profound Vastness Art*, the True Qi art *True-One Severing Yi Radiance Art*, and the Azure Manifestation art *Nine Dams of the Azure Ram Mountain*.

Among the three, Azure Manifestation favored Earth Virtue and had always held an ambiguous position among the arts. In contrast, Pure Qi and True Qi were the least restrictive and could be used by almost anyone.

Li Ximing glanced at the *Profound Vastness Art*. It was a spell art that used the Dharma body to cultivate Pure Qi, entrusting it to the Great Void to be nurtured and transformed. It required the Dharma body to be "unblemished and unharmed." Unblemished meant at least the Purple Mansion Realm, and unharmed meant having no injuries.

Normally, when cultivating this art, if the Dharma body was damaged, the Pure Qi entrusted to the Great Void would sense the breach and pour out. The *Profound Vastness Art* used this principle to repair the Dharma body or strike at enemies in an emergency.

But its most important use wasn't just that. It seemed most of the text was just a foundation for accumulating Pure Qi. Once the art was mastered, if the body was suddenly destroyed, the excess Pure Qi would envelop the Shengyang Acupoint and escape into the Great Void.

'Pure Qi arts truly are profound...'

At the Purple Mansion Realm, although one couldn't act as wantonly as the Merciful One or Maha, the destruction of the Dharma body was not the end. Only when the Shengyang Acupoint shattered was one truly considered fallen.

However, Purple Mansion cultivators had no Buddhist Land to entrust their core to and escape thousands of miles in an instant. If the Dharma body was shattered, it was simple for an enemy to seize the Shengyang Acupoint. Only with a rare Spiritual Artifact or spell art could a precious few escape with just their Shengyang Acupoint.

The *Profound Vastness Art* looked difficult. Li Ximing scanned it and moved on to the *True-One Severing Yi Radiance Art*. This True Qi spell art was one of those rare arts nurtured within a weapon, which naturally made it hard to cultivate. He noted them both down for now.

He had been cultivating the *Tread on Flames* technique recently, and after nearly two years, he had only just passed the introductory stage. He wouldn't overreach. He immediately went down to the lowest floor, activated the stone platform, and began picking fourth-rank Bright Yang spell arts.

This time, there were many more arts available, and the difficulty was much lower. Li Ximing wasn't lacking for offensive methods at the moment. After a careful look, he picked out two.

'A fourth-rank Bright Yang escape art, the *Arranged-Mansions Celestial Yang Escape Art*, and a fourth-rank binding art, the *Radiant Celestial Wave Art*.'

As an Immortal Dao cultivator, his selection of arts was already richer than that of Buddhist cultivators or Demon cultivators. Now, he had his free pick. Movement techniques, spell arts, escape arts... each had its merits. It was tempting to take more, but he knew not to bite off more than he could chew. He settled on these two.

'First, neither is too difficult. Second, they are both closely related to the *Audience with the Celestial Gate* ability, so I should be able to master them faster.'

'This has its drawbacks, of course. When I cultivate other Divine Abilities like the *Eternal Brightness Steps*, these arts won't be complementary and will likely be replaced. But who knows if I'll ever reach that stage? Speed is all that matters. I need to increase my strength as quickly as possible.'

Satisfied, he put them away and went to his residence in the pavilion, storing the jade box in a chest.

During his fight with Nu Xiao and the others, Li Ximing had sustained a minor shoulder injury. It wasn't visible now, but it would take a few months to heal. He had no patience to wait. Taking advantage of the rich spiritual energy here, he retrieved a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill from his sleeve. He pinched the skin and flesh of his shoulder, pushed the pill inside, and let it dissolve, allowing it to heal on its own.

But he had just finished dressing the wound, not even having time to cultivate, when he heard a crisp *crack!*

Li Ximing looked down quickly. The jade talisman at his waist was trembling, fine cracks spreading across its surface.

"There's news from the lake!"

He quickly closed the jade box, grabbed a pale green-white jade bottle from the cabinet, and turned to the window. He didn't spare a glance for the wondrous scenery outside as he secretly communicated with the token.

*Shhh...*

His form instantly dissolved into Heavenly Light. The silver-white token hovered in the air for a moment before floating down to rest on the table.

***

Lake Island, Inner Formation.

Li Ximing waited a moment. His surroundings stabilized into a purple-and-yellow light barrier. His form materialized in a dimly lit hall where long curtains swayed in a faint breeze, casting pale shadows.

His spiritual sense swept out. Li Que'wan was waiting for him just outside the main hall, looking calm. He relaxed.

'It seems nothing bad has happened. It's probably just a Purple Mansion Realm visitor.'

The timing was awkward. The major battles in the north were still raging. If Li Ximing hadn't been protecting his treasures, he too would be out seeing if he could pick up any scraps instead of returning so early to hide.

Nothing in front of him had changed since he left, but his state of mind was completely different. He let out a breath, his mood excellent, and bid the girl enter.

Li Que'wan entered the hall, bowed formally, and reported respectfully, "Daoist Master, Daoist Master Tianhuo of the Golden Feather Sect is here to pay a visit. He is on the lake... with a cultivator from Jiangbei... I informed him you were healing, and he said... there was no rush..."

"Tianhuo?"

Hearing it was someone from the Golden Feather Sect, Li Ximing's feelings were complicated. But for a figure of this level to visit, he couldn't just let him wait. The Golden Feather Sect had been monitoring Bai Yinzi; they certainly knew what injuries he had sustained and how severe they were.

"I will go greet him."

Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then, as he walked out, he added as if suddenly remembering something, "The clan has a Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda. It has space inside to hold people. Move it from Mount Qingdu, have someone repair this hall, and install it right here in the main hall!"

Li Que'wan didn't have time to ask questions; she just nodded in assent.

Li Ximing passed through the formation and went out onto the lake, where he saw a Daoist Master in golden-yellow robes. The Daoist Master's robes were embroidered with golden flames, and his cuffs depicted golden rocks and wind-blown sand. They were exceptionally ornate. He stood seven feet tall, with handsome brows and sharp eyes—a man of graceful bearing. A small, gleaming silver sword-shaped accessory hung from his waist. He stood on the water's surface, gazing into the distance.

Standing respectfully nearby was a young man in blue robes, so nervous he was sweating profusely, not daring to speak. From his appearance, it had to be Su Yan, the one who had caused such a commotion in the Capital immortals Dao that Guan Gongxiao had repeatedly called for help.

Seeing Li Ximing approach, the golden-robed Daoist Master turned, his eyes shining. "Greetings, Zhaojing! I am Tianhuo of the Golden Feather Sect."

Li Ximing returned the courtesy. "Let's speak on the mountain."

If Azure Pond had always been a greedy wolf in the Li clan's history, always trying to bleed them dry, then the Golden Feather Sect was the smiling tiger licking its fur nearby. Although they were rumored to be on good terms with the Li clan, their attitude was mostly one of indifference.

'If that was all, it would have been fine.'

But the incident back then with Situ Mo of the Golden Tang Gate had needlessly cost the life of Li Chenghui of the Chengming generation. This was a deep pain for Li Ximing. More than one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had schemed against the Li clan in that affair. Fearing retaliation from a young Purple Mansion cultivator like himself, even more had opportunistically fanned the flames and struck cheap blows. The Golden Feather Sect's indifference was simply allowing others to borrow the "knife" that was the Situ clan.

'As for whether they actively supported it... who knows.'

Li Ximing couldn't pin all the blame on the Golden Feather Sect. In fact, it was impossible to count how many Purple Mansion cultivators had been involved. The more one guessed, the more dangerous it became. He could only sigh inwardly. 'It has always been this way... How can it ever be made clear? I can only hope that Zhouwei remains safe.'

Despite this past, Li Ximing led him up the mountain. Daoist Master Tianhuo seemed unfazed, merely smiling. "Zhaojing must have gained much this time. I heard the Buddhist cultivators came up empty. I arrived halfway through, and Wang Xiaoxiao was taken in by Chengyun Gate."

This outcome was about what Li Ximing had expected. If he was going to take Bai Yinzi, someone else was bound to take Wang Xiaoxiao. He couldn't expect them to just wait. So, she had fallen into Chengyun's hands.

Tianhuo took a seat, waving for Su Yan to wait outside. Then he smiled. "I just sparred with one of the Five Bright Ones from the White Victory Dao and ran into members of the Helian clan. Only then did I learn that the Helian clan has grown very close to the Way of Emptiness... They were dead set on capturing that Yaosa Chengmi and nearly came to blows with the Lotus Temple."

Li Ximing regarded all of them as trouble; it would be best if they did fight.

'I still have that kasaya that was wrapped around Bai Yinzi. Anything used specifically to protect him can't be ordinary. But I have no use for a Buddhist cultivator's item... I'll have to find a way to sell it.'

Tianhuo, oblivious to his thoughts, paused slightly. His eyes fixed on Li Ximing. "The Helian clan was once glorious. They've been struggling for many years and now finally have a chance to breathe. Like the Way of Emptiness, they are resented by both the Gao clan and the White Horse Monastery. Whether due to the situation or their relationship, they had no choice but to side with the Way of Emptiness. But who knew that the Way of Emptiness, which twice rushed to Jiangbei and stirred up the conflict between north and south, was only doing so out of its own desperation? They are not a safe ship to board."

"Now they're relying on Secret Diffusion to catch their breath, so they roped people in to ambush Purple Smoke. And look... how little did they get for all that effort!"

'What's that supposed to mean? *How little* did they get?'

His words carried a hidden barb. Li Ximing was stunned, caught off guard. He probed lightly, "I can't say for sure. Perhaps the Helian clan had its own reasons for siding with the Way of Emptiness. I heard their territory is in Hetao, where they face the Northern Di and Demon beasts. They aren't at peace either."

"Indeed..." Tianhuo lowered his gaze slightly. Li Ximing's heart thumped as he heard him continue, "I hear you've been on good terms with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition lately... That's rare. It must be because you, Zhaojing, are of imperial descent and upright character that you have this fortunate connection. My clan is just a mountain away. If there's any way we can help, it would be best for us to interact more..."

Li Ximing quickly replied, "I wouldn't dare trouble the Immortal Sect without reason."

"But I *do* have a favor to ask!" Tianhuo smiled. "Now that the spoils are mostly divided, I was taking Su Yan back when I suddenly thought of the *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture*. I came here to borrow it."

He said with regret, "The *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture* has never met its destined owner and has sat empty all these years. Duanyan came once, thinking to activate it, but he didn't find a suitable candidate. This time, I have Su Yan, so I made the trip."

Seeing him with Su Yan, Li Ximing had already understood his purpose. He sent a mental command and smiled. "This is a good thing. The *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture* is just collecting dust in my clan's vault. If the Immortal Sect has a use for it, please take it! If an opportunity arises one day, just send a copy back to the lake, and we'll consider the favor returned."

Tianhuo immediately stood up, his voice heavy. "What nonsense is this! My Golden Feather Sect will absolutely not renege on a favor owed! We cannot simply take something from the lake for free. This is a debt *I* owe you."

Li Ximing met his smiling gaze, feeling a slight unease. He sighed, "It's just one cultivation method..."

"Ah... the Situ clan's was *also* just one cultivation method, yet it still required the Supreme Yang cultivators to make a trip..."

He waved his hand, having brought up the Situ clan. Li Ximing hesitated, then finally asked, "The Golden Tang Gate... their fate was truly tragic. Even though my clan was always their enemy, I couldn't bear to see an immortal lineage humiliated like that. A few collateral branches survived; they were sent to my clan."

At this, Tianhuo's smile didn't fade, but he avoided Li Ximing's gaze and deftly dodged the topic. "Oh... the Way of Emptiness is building a temple on the Tangdao Mountain Range. I hear it's called the 'Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple'. Quite the display!"

As he spoke, he shook his head with a laugh, but his hand rested on his tea cup, unmoving. Finally, he saw Ding Weizeng hurrying in from outside the mountain, holding a jade box.

Ding Weizeng placed the box on the table, opened the lid, and removed the golden silk cloth covering the *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture*.

"Good..."

Li Ximing handed it to Tianhuo. The Daoist Master took it with a smile, his expression turning serious. "I will remember your clan's righteous act. In recent years, our Clan Sister Qiushui has been in seclusion, cultivating a grand art of spiritual division and preservation. She has no mind for sect affairs. The sect... is managed by myself and Tianque. Just send any letters to the Golden Feather Sect."

He said a few more words, flicked his sleeve, and stood. Then, as if just remembering, he asked, "Your clan's 'qilin child'... I presume he has also entered seclusion by now!"

Li Ximing met his gaze briefly but did not answer.

The young man understood. He smiled and vanished into the Great Void as a flash of colored light.

Ding Weizeng kept his head bowed, but Li Ximing's expression was frozen. He remained silent for a long time, one hand still resting on the table, motionless.

The man knew his place and clumsily began to clear the table, collecting the jade box, tea, and cloth. He was about to take Daoist Master Tianhuo's cup when Li Ximing shook his head.

"Daoist Master..."

The Daoist Master waved him off. "Leave."

Ding Weizeng quickly bowed and retreated. Li Ximing stepped forward, staring at his own eyes reflected in the teacup.

'When a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator feels strong emotion, their divine ability manifests externally, interacting with all things. When Changxi died, his final letter was so heavy a mortal could not lift it. When he spoke of the Golden Tang Gate affair, he was seething, grinding his teeth in hatred, yet he dared not voice his anger, suppressing his emotions and his power, which resulted in that...'

This cup had absorbed Tianhuo's rage. It weighed over a thousand pounds. If Li Ximing hadn't been here, the jade table would have instantly collapsed and shattered.



# Chapter 894: Signs of a Southern Push

'The Golden Tang Gate has been in decline for years. After the Azure Pond faded, they survived by relying on the Golden Feather Sect's mediation. But after they acquired that Situ family's spirit rope... the Golden Feather Sect stopped managing their affairs. Primordial Magnetism is determentail to Whole Pill, and it's common knowledge that Qiushui is trying to break through to Fruition Attainment. Tianhuo's rage is understandable.

'Perhaps wiping out the Golden Tang Gate was something the Golden Feather Sect tacitly allowed, or was even powerless to prevent. But for the Tangdao Mountain Range to transform into a treasure land of Primordial Magnetism... that was likely beyond their calculations.

'The northern powers are a tangled mess. Is this a warning strike from Mount Luoxia, or just the petty meddling of the Emptiness Dharma Master and the Great Desire Dharma Master? Or perhaps... both?'

Li Ximing stared quietly at the jade cup. He'd had his doubts, but from Tianhuo's perspective, the Golden Feather Sect had been utterly humiliated. The lesser cultivators might not grasp the full picture, but which of the assembled Purple Mansion Realm masters lacked insight? Even if they didn't perceive the subtle shift in the gilded qi, they all saw the effect that the surging Primordial Magnetism had on the world's spiritual aura.

'It's like an Immortal sent a servant down the mountain, and the servant immediately stepped on a tiger's tail. But seeing the servant was acting on orders, the tiger couldn't pounce. Instead, it's left to wonder if the Immortal is trying to prevent its own cub from growing up.'

Li Ximing sighed. The Golden Feather Sect, despite its Golden Core backing, was forced into silence. Firstly, the current situation was restrictive; True Monarch Taiyuan was likely still beyond the heavens. Secondly... while the Golden Feather Sect had many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, unless they had Daoist Master Qiushui herself make a move, they probably couldn't force the Emptiness, Great Desire, and Helian factions to retreat.

But with True Monarch Taiyuan absent, would the Golden Feather Sect really allow Qiushui to intervene? And if she did, how would they manage the fallout?

Tianhuo departed, seething with rage, but Li Ximing's expression only grew darker.

'They're building a temple on Tangdao Mountain. The Golden Feather Sect's message is clear: they're washing their hands of it.'

The implications of that were profound.

The Way of Emptiness hadn't just destroyed the gate and left; they were building a temple on Tangdao Mountain. With the Golden Feather Sect refusing to intervene, this incident had escalated far beyond simple plunder. Would the Buddhist cultivators really stop there? The balance between north and south was already fragile. What if they continued their push southward? The fall of the Golden Tang Gate meant the western gateway of the Xu State was compromised. Beyond those mountains lay the Brahma Cloud region, and just past that... they would be right at the doorstep of his Moongaze Lake.

The Golden Tang Gate was hardly a righteous sect, but there was a reason it had managed to cling to life for so long. Its sudden annihilation was an embarrassment for the Golden Feather Sect, but for his Li family, it felt like a dagger pressed to their backs.

'No wonder Tianhuo came to me...'

Li Ximing had long known the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's position was precarious. But his family was on the riverbank; what other path could they take? He sighed, using his own divine ability and dharma power to disperse the lingering traces of power on the cup. Just then, he heard Ding Weizeng report that Jiangxia and Li Que'wan were requesting an audience.

Li Ximing waved them up, his mind still elsewhere.

Li Que'wan entered first, followed by Jiangxia, who strode forward with the confidence of a predator. They bowed. Li Ximing got straight to the point.
"What is the situation in Jiangbei?"

The woman spoke, her expression fraught with worry.

"The Buddhist cultivators wouldn't touch Chengyun Gate, so they crossed the mountains through the former Golden Tang Gate lands. They've seized the entire territory and established the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple. Now, they've crossed the creek and entered the Brahma Cloud Territory. All the local powers, great and small, are terrified. It looks like they're ready to surrender at the first sign of trouble."

"In the east, Su Yan has joined the Golden Feather Sect. The demonic cultivators infesting the Capital immortals Dao's territory have fled, but the Daoist tradition itself was still grievously wounded. We hear that Merciful Ones are still active in the territory, acting with utter arrogance, but there's been no sign of Daoist Master Yehui."

'They really crossed the mountains!'

A headache bloomed behind Li Ximing's eyes. "That damned Yehui," he muttered. "Still hiding, even now. Past Midong is his own territory. Is he just going to abandon his Daoist tradition?"

Cursing was one thing, but ruthlessness had its merits—a path Li Ximing himself couldn't walk. South of the Brahma Cloud Territory lay Funan and Midong, regions the Li family had long monitored. The two juniors had clearly come to ask about them. Jiangxia stepped forward, his voice ringing with conviction.
"Daoist Master! Give the order, and we will lead a contingent. With all our Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators advancing as one, we can take Funan and Midong in less than an hour!"

Funan was just across the river, on the north bank. The Li family had always treated it as their buffer against the north; it couldn't be abandoned. But the situation was growing more critical by the moment. Li Ximing stood and flicked his sleeves.

A colorful light flashed, and four dharma artifacts materialized on the desk.

All four dharma artifacts emanated an ancient aura: a saber, a spear, a feathered fan, and a precious pearl. Their designs were simple but refined, each one a high-quality piece. The best among them was the Azure-Pure Pearl. It pulsed with the Dao of Purple Qi, shining like a bright star. Its quality surpassed Li Minggong's Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier and nearly rivaled Li Zhouwei's Grand Ascension. It was impressive enough to make Li Ximing pause and admire it.

"This Azure-Pure Pearl is without a doubt an ancient dharma artifact," he said, impressed. "Unfortunately, no one in the family has made significant progress in the Purple Qi Dao. I'll hold onto it for now."

His own cultivation technique, after all, relied on Purple Smoke. Taking this pearl was the right move. The other items—the Circlet Spike, the Cloud-Parting Fan, and the Bright-Flame Saber—were all of a quality comparable to the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier. They would be excellent additions for the Li family members.

Li Ximing's expression turned serious. "These are not normal times. We're facing the Buddhist cultivators from the north. Distribute these items, then go to the north bank and await my command."

"Yes, Daoist Master."

They replied in unison, bowing before they departed. Li Ximing had no time for further arrangements. He transformed into a streak of bright light and vanished.

Outside Moongaze Lake, the distant Great Void shimmered. The power of Primordial Magnetism from the north was still in flux, silently warping the Great Void. Clearly, the fallout from the Tangdao Mountain Range incident was worsening. Following a spiritual guide, he soon found Ning Wan within the Great Void.

The Lady of Qiuhu greeted him, her voice gentle.

"Greetings, Zhaojing. Your timing is perfect. I was just about to find you."

Li Ximing's expression was grim. He cut straight to the chase.

"The Buddhist cultivators are showing signs of pushing further south. Qiuhu, what are your plans?"

The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's territory was concentrated along the coast. The eastern half of Jiangbei was shielded by Chengyun Gate, Capital immortals Dao, and Xuanmiao Temple. But the Golden Tang Gate, the western gateway, was gone. The only thing south of it was his Moongaze Lake. Ning Wan naturally understood the stakes. She couldn't afford to alienate him now. Hearing his direct question, she replied in a low, serious tone, "Rest easy, Zhaojing. I've already sent word to Xiukui and the Sword Gate. If the Golden Feather Sect won't act, *we* cannot sit idly by."

She was clearly focused on this matter. "Are you aware," she continued, "that a certain Helian Wumeng from the Helian family has also arrived from the north? He's involved with the Way of Emptiness, and he is unquestionably a demonic cultivator. For them to arrive with such momentum... this is no simple matter."

Li Ximing wasn't sure if the Golden Feather Sect had already contacted her, but he felt a small sense of relief. "Whether we fight or negotiate," he replied, "we must draw a line with the Buddhist cultivators. We will need the help of all our allies. I will make a trip to the Capital immortals Dao. If the seniors arrive, tell them to find me there."

Li Ximing wasn't acting out of kindness. Even if Yehui didn't return, the Capital immortals Dao was trapped, just like the Li family. Everyone in the Capital immortals Dao would be a potential ally, united by a common enemy. If a war truly broke out, a flood of Master Monks pouring south could shield one flank and absorb pressure. At worst, he couldn't let the Buddhists destroy them for free. If the Capital immortals Dao fell, the Wilderness would be next.

'Guan Gongxiao and his people can still fight. I must prepare for the worst.'

As for the Brahma Cloud region, it was impossible to know how dangerous it was now. Li Ximing was certainly not willing to go alone. If he projected his senses into the Great Void, he had no idea how many Mahas or Merciful Ones he might find. He would only expose his own abnormalities. It was better to do the opposite and head to the Capital immortals Dao.

Ning Wan understood his thinking. Even if Li Ximing didn't go, she would have to rally them anyway. She nodded. "Agreed. Even if Yehui doesn't return, we can't let the cultivators of our Immortal Dao die for nothing. Daoist Kui Qi and I will join you there."

Her expression turned slightly helpless. "As for Xuanmiao Temple," she said, changing the subject, "I saw Senior Sumian. He revealed himself and took Fei Qingfei away. I thought it would be Chengyan, but it was him. Old Qi used a divine ability to mask it, and while clever, it couldn't fool my Serene Listen."

Ning Wan had cultivated a Life Divine Ability, and her own Daoist tradition and Spiritual Artifacts were exceptional. Although Sumian had inherited a portion of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition, he was ultimately no match for Ning Wan and had silently revealed his presence.

Perhaps Xuanyi had mentioned something, or perhaps the Li family's relationship with her was simply much better than Xuanmiao Temple's. Now that they were in the same boat, she was being completely transparent. This made Li Ximing sigh.

'Fei Qingfei is just a mortal... Why would Sumian take her? What could he possibly want with her?'

...

The gates of the White Ye Immortal Sect.

Brilliant golden light flickered in the sky. A golden-bodied effigy with a crimson face and sharp fangs bestrode a crimson tiger, looming on the horizon as large as a mountain. Its blue-red eyes blazed with fire, and its voice was a rolling thunder, loud enough to make a crying child fall silent.

"I wonder where Senior Yehui might be? This humble one is Chiluo, and I wish to meet the Senior!"

The voice scattered the clouds. Above the sect gate, a halo of purple light rippled with violent waves. The Purple Mansion Realm grand array was clearly operating at full power, sealing off the Great Void with an imposing show of force.

Chiluo, of course, couldn't actually break the Purple Mansion Realm array. But he delighted in watching the people inside panic at his display. He roared with laughter, the sound shaking the heavens.

He appeared to be reveling in the chaos, but the flames burning behind him flickered incessantly, forming a wheel that pulsed without pause. It seemed to be calculating changes in the Great Void and the mortal world, ready to flee at a moment's notice.

After all, Yehui was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master with three Divine Abilities.

Inside the grand array, the black-robed Sect Master's face was so dark it looked like it might drip blood. He watched the giant outside battering the array like a drum. Below, cultivators stumbled and fell, blood trickling from their ears. He was furious, but he knew his own Daoist Master was not going to appear.

'It's not just this Chiluo. Reports say... there are at least three or more Merciful Ones in our Capital immortals Dao territory...'

Guan Gongxiao had been worried sick these past few years. Demonic cultivators were running rampant inside, causing chaos, but he had to be wary of the Great One taking notice and couldn't act freely. He finally waited until that person left, only to turn around and have a Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect descend and take Su Yan away.

*Boom!*

Golden light streaked in from both sides. Guan Gongxiao's heart sank. He saw one new Merciful One holding a sword and another a saber. Both were enormous and looked dangerous, just not as ostentatious as the one riding the tiger.

The purple light of the array rippled violently. Guan Gongxiao began to panic. 'Two over there, two over here... even the Purple Mansion Realm grand array can't withstand this kind of assault!'

Just then, iridescent clouds gathered in the sky, shimmering with light. Chiluo snapped his head up, his expression wary. The markings on his face flickered and twisted as if in anger. He cursed:

"Li Ximing! You dare show your face!"

*BOOM!*

A brilliant light tore through the sky, splitting the dark clouds. Two shining pillars of a Celestial Gate emerged, banners fluttering in their wake. Golden phoenixes accompanied them, descending from the heavens trailing radiant flames.

'This thing again!'

None of the three Merciful Ones dared to remain below. Not one of them dared to receive the attack. They dissolved into qi and fled, scattering in different directions. A torrent of Heavenly Light rolled out, sweeping the area and forcing all cultivators to retreat. A Daoist Master in white-gold robes descended, standing atop the Celestial Gate, his expression icy and his tone equally sharp.
"Friends, you cause chaos in the territory of my Immortal Dao, making life miserable for the people. Are you perhaps eager to return to the Buddhist Land?"

Chiluo was genuinely wary. He had no desire to fight Li Ximing in this dangerous territory. It was still a mystery whether Yehui was present or not. If he got pinned down by the Audience with the Celestial Gate and a three-ability Yehui suddenly emerged... Chiluo could just close his eyes and wait for death.

'I was just here to probe for Yehui's location and test the reaction of the surrounding Daoist traditions... That's why I made such a scene. I can't afford to lose this dharma body.'

He didn't dare advance. Instead, he summoned the light of the Buddhist Land from afar, laughed loudly, and shouted, "What? Has Daoist Li come to play the hero? We are spreading the true dharma, promoting the sacred path. What business is it of yours, all the way from the south? It's not your place to interfere!"

The Buddhist Land was not far from here, and the cultivators from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had not yet fully assembled. Although Li Ximing knew he was only facing these three, he was in no hurry to start a major battle. He hovered the Celestial Gate above the Capital immortals Dao's main gate, confronting the three and said calmly, "Then come up and promote your 'true dharma'."

Chiluo saw he was unmoved, not budging an inch. His Buddhist Land network was well-informed; he knew Li Ximing possessed both a spirit embryo and a Spiritual Artifact, a far cry from the man he used to be. Why would he risk his own dharma body to test that blade? Moreover, since Li Ximing was here, Ning Wan and Kui Qi couldn't be far behind. He wheeled his tiger around and retreated, but he was secretly observing, judging their strength.

Li Ximing wasn't afraid of a stalemate. He had a perfect grasp of the surrounding Great Void. He watched as Guan Gongxiao rode the wind, flying out of the protective array, and cried, "Daoist Master, your righteousness is profound! This lowly one has received your grace... I am endlessly grateful!"

Li Ximing couldn't tell how complex the man's emotions truly were. But in this world, shared interests were the strongest bond. This was true for the Golden Feather Sect, and it was true for the Capital immortals Dao. The Capital immortals Dao's ambiguous stance had always been precisely because of this.

Li Ximing kept his expression cold. "I just can't stand Buddhist cultivators," he said flatly. "Where is Yehui?"

Guan Gongxiao bowed deeply. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, my Daoist Master found a fortunate opportunity and has been traveling overseas. We do not know his current whereabouts, nor when he will return..."

Guan Gongxiao's emphasis on a "fortunate opportunity" was twofold. First, it implied Yehui *could* return, the only question was whether it was *worth* returning. Second, it implied Yehui wasn't injured or in seclusion, but his strength was intact—still a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master with three Divine Abilities.

He quickly added, "My Daoist Master spoke with me several times in the past. He said that Moongaze Lake and our sect are natural allies. It's just... he had a weakness held by Daoist Master Changxiao, which forced his hand in the Profound Peak matter. He felt great shame over it... Now... now... everyone in the Capital immortals Dao... we all owe the Daoist Master a debt of gratitude!"

He began to weep with emotion. Li Ximing glanced at him, not caring how much was real and how much was an act. He just frowned.

"Recall him. Now. The Buddhist cultivators are at your gate. If he doesn't make a move, all he'll find when he returns are your corpses!"

As he gave the order, his heart sank.

'Xuanyi mentioned that Yehui struggles when fighting Buddhist cultivators... but surely not to *this* extent!'

At this thought, Li Ximing slowly turned his gaze back to Guan Gongxiao.

'The Daoist Master isn't here, but didn't he leave his direct disciple behind? He must cultivate the same techniques. I can judge the master by observing the student.'

He studied the man and asked in a low voice, "Have you clashed with the Buddhist cultivators? What are your impressions?"

# Chapter 895: The Sword that Pacified Three Heads

Sweat beaded on Guan Gongxiao's forehead. He was terrified, and he hurried to explain.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, we have already engaged them. Those Buddhist monks and Master Monks can neutralize my Dharma Arts. They often just shine a Buddhist light or a colored light, and it’s like pulling the foundation from a tall building. My arts collapse, dissipate, and I'm forced to bow... They are not easy to deal with."

"However, these fellows are vulnerable to dharma artifacts. Although their bodies are tough, they are unarmed. When it comes to a real fight... they aren't *too* difficult to handle."

Guan Gongxiao couldn't possibly be unaware of his own Daoist tradition's strengths and weaknesses. He probably knew long ago that the Capital Guard's methods were ill-suited for fighting Buddhist cultivators. Now that Li Ximing was asking, he was being very clear.

'Dharma Art nullification... I've never heard that Yehui possessed as many Dharma Arts as Changxiao. He just had a pair of Spiritual Artifacts on him that could create flames and lightning. The Capital Guard... it's often said their methods are those of ghosts, spirits, and mountain spirits. It's normal for them to be countered and suppressed by Buddhist techniques.'

As he finished speaking, the cultivators from the Capital immortals Dao had already approached, trembling with fear. At their head was the saber-wielding Gongsun Bofan. He came forward, bowed, and said respectfully.

"Greetings, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing glanced at him and asked:

"How is the Song family?"

Bringing up the Song family was really just asking about Song Yunbai. Among the Great One's lovers, she had the highest cultivation. Guan Gongxiao's expression dimmed, and he replied in a low voice.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, she was already taken away by a Daoist Master. We did not see his face, but judging by his clothes and the clogs on his feet, we estimate... he is a cultivator from... Qize in the south of the Wu State."

The Song family were supporters of Capital immortals, but having a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator taken away without a sound was definitely not a good thing. It was just like the Fei family of Moongaze Lake; Fei Qingya, who wasn't even that important, had left, and Li Ximing had wanted to throw the entire Fei family into Tiger's Frontier. How could Song Yunbai, who was one of the Song family's primary decision-makers, be any different?

Furthermore, Qize was the largest marsh in the south, and most of the cultivators there lived under the shadow of Mount Changhuai. Only a few Daoist Masters and that one Sword Immortal, Duo Ling, were rogue cultivators. She had most likely attached herself to the Wu State's number one hegemon, Mount Changhuai!

'This Mount Changhuai is even stronger than the Golden Feather Sect... Geographically, it dominates its own corner of the world, calling itself the Changhuai Daoist tradition, and all its vassals treat Changhuai as the orthodox line. No wonder he's so nervous.'

Li Ximing, enjoying the drama, listened idly. Only then did he see several streams of light cut across the sky.

Leading them was naturally the current head of the Great Xiukui Monastery, Kui Qi. He had a long face and fine eyebrows, still wearing that same black robe, a black-cord dharma artifact tied at his waist. He carried the green-patina-mottled Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword.

With him was Tinglan, who had been in seclusion for many years healing her injuries. She looked to be in good spirits and was frowning as she spoke. Perhaps because the occasion was formal, she was no longer wearing her favorite autumn-yellow robe, but was instead dressed in purple, holding the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion.

Behind them, on one side, was Houfu, a cloth bag tied at his waist. He had dealings with Li Ximing overseas and nodded in greeting from a distance. On the other side was the gentle and beautiful Ning Wan, holding the Great Snow's Severing Edge.

These four were the Daoist Masters of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition who roamed Jiangnan. Not counting those who disliked or were unwilling to show themselves, these four alone could decide the fate of more than half of the Yue State.

At their side, Guan Gongxiao prostrated himself, not daring to look up. The cultivators around him nearly collapsed to the ground. Chiluo, who had been in the Great Void, had naturally fled long ago. Li Ximing casually instructed,

"Take your people and guard the west. When the fight starts in the south and the people on the lake move north, you will also lead your forces and come west."

With that, he withdrew his Divine Ability, rose on a beam of light, and was the first to bow in greeting.

"My deepest thanks to all you fellow Daoists!"

The four Daoist Masters returned the courtesy. Kui Qi's demeanor was the most magnanimous. He extended one hand in a welcoming gesture and said in a clear voice:

"Zhaojing, you are too kind. We shall proceed together. We cannot let the Seven Ways linger and defile the lands of Jiangbei."

Li Ximing expressed his thanks, took a step, and moved forward with them. He saw the Great Snow's Severing Edge in Ning Wan's hands, which was etched with a scene of the Profound Snow and Supreme Yin rising in the cosmos, and sighed inwardly:

'The sword cultivators of Jiangnan would probably die without regret if they could just touch this blade...'

Houfu saw him looking at the Great Snow's Severing Edge and just smiled:
"This sword is one of a kind. Apart from Daoist Master Donghua's Bili, this is the only one. Compared to it, Situ Huo's long saber Blood-Omen Tower, which he wishes he could use as a pillow, is just scrap metal. Guo Shentong's Arrogant Waves would also be inferior, weaker by thirty percent."

As he finished speaking, Tinglan smiled from the side.

"You can't just compare them like that. What kind of people are *they*..."

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators pressed forward using their Divine Abilities. Kui Qi listened to Daoist Master Houfu's idle chatter, his tone relaxed, but one hand rested on his sword, rubbing it. He sighed,

"There's no comparison!"

Although Daoist Master Houfu seemed relaxed as he chatted, Li Ximing still sensed Kui Qi's faint hesitation, as if he was anxious and worried about something.

'After all... they have to face the Way of Emptiness's Zhelu and Taixi, and the Way of Great Desire has at least Vija and Nuzi present. Although we don't know what losses the Buddhist cultivators suffered in the earlier conflict or how many remain, there is still a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Helian family on the sidelines... and that's not even counting the Merciful Ones within the Buddhist Land.'

Although a Merciful One's strength was less than a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's, they were troublesome enough in groups of three or five. It was even more trouble if there were two or three Golden Lotus Seat disciples mixed in, who knew some Dharma Arts and had experience fighting Immortal cultivators.

He followed the group forward and soon saw the radiance of the Buddhist Land in the sky. Golden clouds gathered over Tangdao Mountain, and Primordial Magnetism flashed.

The mountain itself was already impossibly tall, a mass of jagged rock. Now, two enormous golden statues stood there. One was covered in ten thousand eyes, terrifying to the extreme. The other had twelve arms and three heads, wreathed in rainbow light. Its eyes were like stars above the clouds, glittering with light; its hands were like suspended mountain peaks, wreathed in crimson clouds. They were truly as large as mountains.

These two Golden Bodies were only a head shorter than the highest peak. They used Tangdao Mountain as their high-backed immortal throne, sitting firmly upon it. One faced west, one faced east, and they were surrounded by Merciful Ones, looking magnificent under the thick, colorful light.

Before these Golden Bodies, the Daoist Masters were no larger than ants. Yet, their arrival caused the colorful clouds to pause. The Merciful Ones, who had been sitting or standing on either side, immediately flew up on the wind and clasped their hands in greeting.

"Esteemed Daoist Masters, what leisure brings you to visit our Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple!"

Li Ximing recognized at a glance that the two on either side were the sixth-generation Zhelu of the Way of Emptiness, who presided over the Buddhist Land, and the fifth-generation Vija of the Way of Great Desire!
He was no stranger to these two Mahas. They had been the main force in the ambush on Tinglan and Qiuhu all those years ago, and were only forced back by Daoist Master Lingmei of the Sword Gate. For these two to be personally guarding this place... it seemed the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple that the Way of Emptiness and Great Desire had established on this mountain was, as expected, of the utmost importance!

Daoist Master Kui Qi's expression was grim. Seeing the two Mahas in the mountain putting on a false show, sending only a Merciful One over without a word, he was naturally furious. He said coldly:

"The Northern Buddhists have occupied Tangdao Mountain and taken on these giant forms. Do you intend to cross the mountain and come to Baijiang Creek next?"

"Back then, the True Monarch wielded his sword and nearly slew the Sea of Desire's Maha, Liangli, forcing him to swear a great oath not to cross the river for three hundred years. Do you intend to break that oath today?"

Li Ximing understood. Vija was not like Zhelu; he was not the number one. Behind him was the Maha Liangli of the Sea of Desire, who presided over the Buddhist Land, and his cultivation was likely even higher...

'So he was once struck down by True Monarch Shangyuan.'

Vija seemed very calm when this was mentioned. His twelve hands stretched out behind him, and his voice rumbled:

"My Great Desire's Liangli sought instruction from the Jade True and benefited greatly. He is very grateful and will naturally not break his oath. It is just that the Way of Emptiness is moving south, so I came to lend a hand."

Li Ximing, however, was silently pondering.

'I've never heard of this incident... Could it be because a Dharma Master from the Way of Great Desire intervened to save someone?'

He hesitated slightly, but this guess seemed very likely. After all, True Monarch Shangyuan was a Jade True Sword Immortal; anyone who died by his hand was truly dead. It wasn't impossible that this had provoked a Dharma Master to intervene. And if a Dharma Master had acted, it was possible that the impact of the event was suppressed, even if someone had witnessed it. Besides, True Monarch Shangyuan was not one to boast...

Kui Qi couldn't be bothered to argue with him. He just rested his hand on his sword and said,

"There is nothing more to say. The Golden Feather Sect has no say over Tangdao Mountain, but Baijiang Creek is the territory of our Immortal Dao. If you all insist on crossing the river, then we will settle this today."

A voice finally spoke from within the mountain. It was Zhelu. His thousand eyes blinked, and his voice was chilling,

"The Great Snow's Severing Edge is heaven-shakingly powerful, truly formidable. In Lingmei's hands, it is even more so. But the matter of Baijiang Creek will not be clear until we have fought a match."

"As for you, little girl, I fear you are not in your true body!"

His words were aimed squarely at Tinglan!

"Your sect's Migration Token... We of the Buddhist Dao have seen it before!"

If Tinglan was indeed a decoy formed by the Migration Token, and her injuries were not yet healed, then they would be short one person...

The moment this was said, Li Ximing knew this could not be resolved peacefully. But Tinglan, at his side, acted as if she hadn't heard, smiling at Zhelu. At that moment, the entire sky flashed with brilliance, and two more Golden Bodies appeared in the heavens on either side!

Taixi and Nuzi!

But it was far from over. Baleful Qi surged from the earth, and ground-flames erupted, soaring into the air. They streaked through the sky and quickly transformed into a middle-aged man dressed in pure white feathered robes, adorned with Lapis Lazuli.

The man was handsome, holding a long-handled pole-blade that was entirely pitch-black, looking like neither a saber nor a spear. His snow-white feathered robes billowed in the wind. His hair was unbound, and eighteen Lapis Lazuli beads hung at his waist. He raised his eyes and smiled.

"So this is what a Southerner looks like. Nothing special!"

Li Ximing could tell just from his appearance that this was an expert in weaponry. He heard Ning Wan sigh beside him.

"Helian Wumeng."

The sky was filled with Buddhist fiends, their presence overwhelming. Yet, the reaction from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's side was muted. The Daoist Masters in the front at least bothered to look, but Houfu just lowered his head, admiring the Baleful Qi beneath his feet.

Strangely, although the enemy's posturing was immense, no one on their side rushed forward either. Only a few Merciful Ones flew up, preparing to form a defensive array. Perhaps they, too, were waiting for Lingmei.

Kui Qi gazed at the Golden Bodies from afar, then turned slightly to reveal Ning Wan behind him.

A rift tore open in the Great Void. Ning Wan stood respectfully, holding the sword, as a man materialized before her.

This man was eight feet tall, thin but upright, dressed in robes of black and white. A single gourd hung from his waist. His brow bones were full and sharp, and his hair and beard were neatly bound up in a topknot. His hands were clasped behind his back, and his eyes were calm, fixed on the Golden Bodies.

His aura wasn't particularly outstanding. If not for the thick glow of Divine Ability around him, he might have passed for a village schoolteacher. But when he stood before the group, all the Supreme Yang Daoist Masters bowed together and said respectfully,

"We respectfully welcome the Great Daoist Master!"

This man was the Great Daoist Master of Xiukui, a contemporary of Zipei and the Three Yuans, the Sword Immortal renowned for his prowess in combat: Lou Xing!

Back when the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was a dazzling constellation of stars, with the Three Yuans standing side-by-side and the Two Purples shining brightly, this very Daoist Master Lou Xing was famous even then for his skill in battle!

One had to remember that even Daoist Master Zipei of the Purple Smoke Gate, who was known for her cultivation base and *not* for combat, was still able to make the Buddhist cultivators shrink back in her dying moments. How much more, then, this man standing before them?!

In an instant, the clouds in the sky froze. The rainbow light and Treasure Light paused. The wary Helian Wumeng extinguished his Baleful Qi. Taixi and Nuzi were so terrified they stopped their transformations. Seeing that fair hand grip the sword, no one dared to make the first move.

'He's here! He actually came in person! The battle hasn't even started... We haven't seized a single piece of land in Jiangbei, only the insignificant Golden Tang Gate, and the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition has already summoned their Sword Immortal?!'

The Sword Immortal raised his eyebrows, his gaze lifting. His entire aura changed instantly. His Spiritual Sense had already locked onto all the cultivators, pressing down like Mount Tai, immovable and vast. His voice was level,

"You have all wanted me to come to Jiangbei for a long time..."

He held the Great Snow's Severing Edge, seeming to savor it.

"That monk was right. Nothing will be clear until we have fought. I knew you were trying to force my hand. Since that is the case, you must all bear the price of my appearance."

The moment he spoke, Zhelu, on the mountain, practically exploded. He ignored the sense of crisis warning him that a single move would bring a blade down on him. His entire body bloomed with radiant light, his thousand hands and thousand eyes simultaneously emitting a pink glow. The others, seeing someone else taking the blow, felt as if they'd been granted amnesty. Who cared about Zhelu now? They turned to flee!

But a Sword Immortal's strike takes but an instant.

The sharp, snowy momentum of the sword surged. The emblem of the Profound Snow and Supreme Yin rising in the cosmos, the scene of autumn yielding to winter as heaven and earth merged—all of it appeared at once. After several hundred years, the Great Snow's Severing Edge finally displayed the pinnacle of the union between the divine and Sword Intent before the cultivators. Lou Xing's Way of the Sword and his cultivation pushed its range to the absolute maximum!

'Unless Jingzhan or Murong Xia were here, who could face this sword strike without spitting blood, without feeling utter despair!'

The falling snow scattered, resonating with his perfected Divine Ability. In an instant, every cultivator present was suppressed, unable to even open the Great Void. The thousand-eyed Maha, Zhelu, whose soul had nearly fled his body, leaped into the air, only to suddenly freeze.

The sword light was sharp, and it lanced his Dharma Body, creating cracks all over it, but it wasn't aimed at him!

Instead, it was Vija, who had just turned to leave, whose expression didn't even have time to change. He had no time to defend. He stared at the terrifying sword light that was rapidly expanding before him, locking onto both his soul and his Dharma Body, and terror pierced his heart.

"Ah?"

Wind and thunder churned in the sky. The sword strike landed. The several Mahas and that fiend could finally connect to the Great Void. The thousand-eyed Maha on the mountain, having narrowly escaped death, had no intention of helping. It was every man for himself. He immediately released an infinite, illusory brilliance and instantly fled.

And the Sword Intent, like light, instantly vaporized the Merciful Ones who had the misfortune of being in the sword's path, turning them to ash.

"Krr-chak..."

Next came the sound of the Maha's trump cards and Treasured Artifacts being shattered, the sound of Lapis Lazuli breaking vibrating endlessly from within the Great Void, rising and falling.

In an instant, the pink light and the sword light vanished together. The light of the cold moon retracted. The Maha's main body disappeared, and the Sword Immortal was also gone. A rain of brilliant, pink light fell from the sky. Three massive heads, trailing dust and smoke, tumbled from the sky, smashing toward the ground amidst the flashing Primordial Magnetism. They blotted out the sun, their Treasure Light like stars, their black aura like night!

The dozen or so Merciful Ones nearby still hadn't reacted, frozen in place by the falling snow, which made the descending heads look like blazing meteors. Li Ximing shot forward on his beam of light, hearing Kui Qi's sharp roar.

"Seize this opportunity!"

The Maha was gone, but there were still Merciful Ones in the sky, suppressed by the sword light and unable to escape!

Although Li Ximing didn't know where Vija and the Sword Immortal had gone, it was clear Vija had lost half his life. He could see the golden opportunity before him. How could Lou Xing have acted just to kill one person? This sword strike hadn't consolidated its power on a single point; it had scattered its Sword Might to suppress the entire Tangdao Mountain. Wasn't it precisely to create this situation?!

He was overjoyed.

'Every one we kill now lessens the pressure in the future!'

Almost before his thought had faded, Tinglan's avatar in the sky dissipated. Instead, her true body appeared at the highest point of the horizon, her robes fluttering, holding a small, greyish-white gourd.

The Supreme Minister's Gourd!

The lid was already open, and a ball of flame immediately leaped out. It was a shimmering, two-toned radiance of cyan and blue. The long-prepared Immeasurable Water and Fire poured out, turning into a rain of fire that filled the sky.

The Immeasurable Water and Fire was a special Spiritual Fire that severed connections to the Great Void! Empowered by the Supreme Minister's Gourd, who knew how long it had been accumulating in the Great Void. In an instant, it released thousands of fiery streams, raining down on the head of nearly every Merciful One.

But Immeasurable Water and Fire was, after all, a Spiritual Fire, not suited for quick victories. Even enhanced by a Spiritual Artifact, it was still a step slower than a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. The range of the shattered Great Void rapidly expanded. The four Supreme Yang Daoist Masters attacked in unison. A purple pavilion soared, white snow scattered, a black cord bound, and radiance descended!

"RUMBLE!"

Li Ximing's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' descended from the sky, trailing a glorious radiance. Seizing the perfect moment, it smashed down onto a golden platform at the foot of Tangdao Mountain!

Three Merciful Ones had been sitting cross-legged there. Suppressed by the terror of the Great Snow's Severing Edge, they had only just managed to fly up. Only one of them, with four arms and two heads, was stronger and farther away, and he barely managed to shift his position.

"BOOM!"

Purple flames and Heavenly Light flashed together. The other two had no time to move at all and were simultaneously pinned beneath the celestial gate. A bright plume of energy erupted as the ground cracked open, and the cliffs on either side shattered and came crashing down.

The four-armed, two-headed Merciful One beside them finally reacted to the lightning-fast turn of events. He had narrowly avoided the celestial gate, and a chill ran down his spine.

'If I get pinned by that right now, I'll definitely lose this Dharma Body!'

But the despair was far from over. His desperate dodge had barely avoided the gate, but it left him no time to escape into the Great Void. That two-toned radiance of cyan and blue was already right in front of him.

'Disciple-brother Huakong!'

Following the desperate shouts of his two disciple-brothers from within the array, all traces of the Great Void vanished from the four-armed, two-headed Merciful One's Spiritual Sense as the fire arrived...

'Damn it... this Immeasurable Water and Fire again!'

The power of the Immeasurable Water and Fire was spread too thin, and most of its power had been spent just reaching him. It wasn't actually a threat to Huakong. The problem was that it severed his connection to the Great Void, which was utterly disgusting!

Fortunately, Huakong knew two Dharma Arts. He slammed his two palms against his chest and instantly split into three illusory Golden Body phantoms, all identical, lifelike, and moving in different directions.

The Supreme Minister's Gourd was not without the ability to distinguish a true body, but it was simply too far away, and the area it was affecting was too large. It was overextended. Confused by the two decoys, the fire could only slip harmlessly through the gap in the middle and drift away.

This Merciful One, Huakong, felt the heat on his face but not a shred of relief. He looked up in despair. The man in the white-gold Daoist robes had, as expected, abandoned the celestial gate and was already stepping through the light to stand before him. A ripple of blue-green light spread out. His Dharma Body, which had been perfect and complete, suddenly felt heavy, as if sinking into a swamp.

The range of this mountain-and-river pattern was enormous. It not only bound him, but his two disciple-brothers, trapped in the bright light, were also struggling against the blue-green glow!

'Zhaojing Li Ximing!'

The light of Reveal River rippled in the air. The Merciful One's heart seized with panic, but he felt a wondrous power responding.

Monarch's Balance!

The blue-green light of Reveal River paused for the briefest moment. But as the Spiritual Ruler hesitated in the air, the Merciful One's two phantoms vanished like snow under a hot sun.

Huakong wanted to spit blood. He brought two hands together in front of his chest and summoned two golden hammers with his other two hands, smashing them directly at the Daoist.

But the Daoist in the white-gold robes just pursed his lips. A jet of red-and-white interwoven flame immediately shot from his mouth, crossed the distance in an instant, slipped between the two hammers, and descended as a brilliant golden-yellow.

Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire!

At the same time, both his hands ignited with a bright white Li Fire. The Sun's Resonant Parting Art activated, coating his palms. He raised his hands and caught the incoming golden hammers.

"CLANG!"

The 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' enhanced his Dharma Body, resonating with the Sun's Resonant Parting Art, and he was further augmented by Reveal River. The two hammers, which his opponent had swung in haste, only managed to explode in a burst of white Li Fire against his palms. Their momentum was greatly slowed, and he held them fast.

But the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was already pouring down like molten rock, streaming down the Merciful One Huakong's cheeks, searing him and making him scream. A thick, golden-lacquer-like liquid dripped down his chest.

"Wmm..."

In the sky, the greyish-white Supreme Minister's Gourd finally stopped spouting flames. This highly sentient Spiritual Artifact was faithfully executing its master's orders. It scanned the mountain range, and, whether out of anger or because it still recognized Li Ximing, its mouth once again aimed at the four-armed Merciful One who had dodged the fire but failed to escape into the Great Void.

The four-armed Merciful One felt a chill shoot up his spine.

'You damned plague!'

Li Ximing naturally seized the opportunity. In an instant, a brilliant light shot from between his brows. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light lanced out, striking at point-blank range, open and righteous, sweeping toward the man's face.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light followed the path of Radiance. In such a direct, face-to-face confrontation, its power was amplified. The Merciful One before him could only cry out in grief.

"This is bitter! I've fallen for his scheme!"

The vast and mighty Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light passed straight through the brilliant glow he desperately spat from his mouth to block it, striking him squarely on the brow, which was already dripping with golden lacquer from the Purple Mansion Realm True Fire.

"Pfft!"

With a muffled sound, his head was pierced through. His heart went cold. Only one thought remained in his mind.

'Self-detonate!'

He had been hit by two Spiritual Fires and one Hidden Light, all striking him where he was weakest. The Immeasurable Water and Fire had cut off the Great Void, making it impossible to communicate with the Buddhist Land. If he was hit by that fire again, he would truly perish!

"BANG!"

He was incredibly decisive. Almost in the same instant as the Hidden Light struck, a dense golden light exploded outward. The two-toned cyan and blue fire streaked across several miles, arriving a moment too late, adding fuel to the fire as it landed on the empty Dharma Body left behind.

Li Ximing sighed inwardly.

This aspect of the Buddhist cultivators was truly annoying. Unless they were ambushed in advance, even with a unique Spiritual Artifact like the Supreme Minister's Gourd and its Immeasurable Water and Fire, as long as they had the slightest intention to die, they were incredibly hard to kill. At most, they would just lose a Dharma Body...

'What a pity!'

"Shhh-laa!"

With Huakong's body destroyed, a pink radiance mixed with brilliant light shot into the sky, transforming into a cascade of pink flower petals that burned to nothing in the dazzling flames, leaving not a trace behind.

As the flower-rain drifted down, Li Ximing swept his gaze over it, then pulled back, landing atop the celestial gate. He stamped his boot on the gate, and his Divine Ability and dharma power surged into it, stamping the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate', which had just started to waver, firmly back down. Then, he pointed two fingers, sending the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire under the gate.

Li Ximing hadn't been personally driving the Divine Ability; he had been dividing his attention to suppress it. It wasn't impossible for these two Merciful Ones to break free. If that four-armed Merciful One hadn't been so unlucky, he wouldn't have perished in one go, and Li Ximing would have been forced to return to suppress them.

As a result, these two Merciful Ones, who had just begun to shake the gate, felt a heavy weight settle on their shoulders, and their hearts turned cold. Streams of red, white, and golden flames rushed in.

'Disciple-brother Huakong... was slain by him just like that!'



# Chapter 896: Settling the Mountain

'Well, what do we have here? A pair of golden hammers!'

Li Ximing waved his sleeve lightly, plucking two golden objects from the pink haze filling the sky. They were the pair of golden hammers from the Buddhist cultivator he had just slain, each one nearly half the size of a man.

Though large, the hammers were of clearly inferior quality, far worse than the monastic robe he had previously confiscated. Li Ximing didn't understand Buddhist arts, but he could still discern quality. With a flip of his hand, he stored them away.

'Agony!'

Pinned by Li Ximing's Audience with the Celestial Gate and scorched by a blast of True Fire, the two Merciful Ones below had no thought to spare for their fellow disciples. They were in dire straits. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual fire, and his 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' was at the perfection stage. They were instantly immobilized.

'They're already suppressed. There's no hurry to kill them. In fact, I mustn't let them become too desperate. If I force them to abandon their dharma bodies and self-destruct to return to the Buddhist Land, that would be a poor outcome.'

Thus, he deliberately varied the pressure, sometimes light, sometimes heavy, feigning that his divine ability was unstable. Although the flames remained fierce, the power of the celestial gate overhead gradually weakened, filling them with wild joy.

After all, the two of them held low status among the Merciful Ones. If they lost their dharma bodies and barely managed to return to the Buddhist Land, no one would help them. They would have to seize the bodies of their own subordinate Master Monks to refine as new vessels—a grievous loss!

Although the Immeasurable Water and Fire was potent, the Supreme Minister's Gourd had already flown into the distant Daoist Master Tinglan's hands after releasing the flames. It wasn't directly upon them, so they still had time to react.

'Self-destruct right now? No, better to stall for time...'

With this thought tempting them, they continued to silently push back against the celestial gate. They knew the man in the sky was likely holding back, but they played along, waiting for some variable to change, for any chance to escape.

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow and scanned the battlefield.

The entire mountain range was enveloped in multicolored light. Daoist Master Kui Qi was leading the charge. A black cord whipped through the air as he held a bronze sword plunged straight through the skull of one golden-bodied cultivator, immobilizing it. His other hand brandished a small, unfamiliar bell that radiated blinding light, hovering phantom-like behind another Merciful One's head.

The strongest of the Merciful Ones, wreathed in Immeasurable Water and Fire, stood upon several golden rings, blocking Kui Qi's path with a grim expression. His once-smooth, translucent golden body was now crawling with dark spots, and several feathers had even sprouted from his armpits.

'I wonder what kind of art he was hit with.'

Tinglan's injuries hadn't fully healed, so she was mainly using the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion for support and suppression. Ning Wan was without her Great Snow's Severing Edge and couldn't quite hold a front by herself. Aside from Kui Qi, the most imposing presence was, naturally, Houfu.

The Daoist's robes billowed as he held his hands high, pressing down on a golden-bodied cultivator. His grey, pouch-like Spiritual Artifact hung high above, its mouth gaping open. It unleashed torrential blasts of Supreme Yang radiance, a brilliant, soul-shaking light that hung between the peaks like an intense waterfall.

Beneath this radiance, two Merciful Ones were thrown into disarray, suppressed by the Supreme Yang brilliance. They could neither summon their flames nor ride the gales. Though not in immediate mortal danger, they clearly had the air of lambs waiting for the slaughter.

Li Ximing had seen this item before, back at the Peacock Sea. It was the very thing that had forced Yu Guang to retreat. His insight, however, was on a completely different level now. As he examined it, he sighed inwardly.

'This bag is undoubtedly a Spiritual Treasure from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. How extravagant. I wonder how many transformations such a powerful external treasure possesses.'

To put it bluntly, with that one Spiritual Treasure deployed, Houfu likely wouldn't even have to lift a finger to give a Purple Mansion Realm demonic cultivator or an Eastern Sea Daoist Master a world of trouble. It was probably no weaker than Tinglan's life-saving Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion. No wonder he dared to preside over an entire region at such a young age.

He watched for a moment more. Suddenly, the Supreme Minister's Gourd vanished from the sky. A ripple stirred the Great Void beside him, and Tinglan, clad in purple, materialized silently beside his celestial gate, smiling faintly at him.

Li Ximing started, his spiritual sense sweeping out.

'Her true body is clearly still on the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion!'

'It's a Traversal Token...'

He understood in an instant. The celestial gate wavered and suddenly lifted, opening a gap. Below, amid flashing light and raging flames, the two golden-bodied cultivators were overjoyed and lunged for the opening.

Tinglan, however, presented the Supreme Minister's Gourd. She tilted its mouth, and a torrent of azure and blue dichromatic flames surged through the gap.

'What a brilliant maneuver!'

'A clone from a Traversal Token naturally has no divine abilities. But its marvel, compared to other clones, is that it's nearly equivalent to the true body. It even has its own sphere of spiritual sense. And though it lacks divine abilities, it *can* activate Spiritual Artifacts!'

Tinglan's cultivation base was profound. Whether by some divine ability, Dharma Art, or artifact technique, she had made this clone completely undetectable. Now, as the raging Immeasurable Water and Fire poured in, the two cultivators inside were momentarily stunned.

Li Ximing finally had his opening. He transformed into a streak of light, shot through the gap, and drew his halberd!

"Boom!"

The Merciful One took the full blast of the Immeasurable Water and Fire to the face, and in the next instant, the light of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd cleaved down. His golden body was mediocre; it could block common divine abilities and Dharma Arts, but already wounded by True Fire and spiritual fire, it stood no chance against this assault.

His entire dharma body shattered, disintegrating from the crown of his skull. It broke apart into a cascade of fragmented, glittering shards, scattering like brilliant, broken glass.

A surge of pink light erupted, but the celestial phenomenon of his fall was blocked by the celestial gate, momentarily preventing it from rising. Li Ximing had already turned, his gaze locked on the other, stupefied Merciful One.

The brilliant radiance of Splitting Light flared, but Tinglan did not press the attack. Instead, her clone dissolved and vanished, already moving to another target.

The reason was simple: this band of Merciful Ones was already a flock of startled birds. If several of them fell in succession, this survivor—who had dodged the Immeasurable Water and Fire but was now trapped—would inevitably self-destruct to escape.

While destroying his dharma body was a significant victory and a huge loss for the Way of Emptiness, if they could kill him outright, wouldn't that eliminate a future threat for good?

The other three cultivators in the sky attacked in perfect concert. Instantly, the heavens filled with overflowing radiance and a storm of pink light.

***

By the time Li Ximing retracted his divine ability and flew up, the True Fire had refined the ground below into a glassy, golden slag. The death phenomena had been suppressed, unable to spread, and were instead condensed by the True Fire, melting into the earth. As the pressure lifted, a final diffusion of pink light scattered.

He rode his bright light forward. The rain of flowers in the sky, now mixed with fine snow, had reached its zenith, falling in a dense flurry.

Snow drifted down. Three massive heads, like low hills, lay quietly in the snow. Their faces were frozen in expressions of shock, fury, and defiance, with ferocious brows and wide, staring eyes.

"Truly a great victory..."

Li Ximing observed, his expression thoughtful.

At least for him, Li Ximing, this was a great victory that perfectly suited the interests of his Moongaze Lake. As for who truly won or lost in the greater conflict between the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the north, and which side had suffered more... that was a matter of perspective.

Daoist Master Kui Qi strode across the void toward them. His expression was solemn. Despite the celebratory rain of flowers, his mind was clearly heavy, and he showed little joy. He asked softly,

"Tinglan... I see the Primordial Magnetism here has stabilized."

Daoist Master Tinglan, in her purple robes, gazed at Tangdao Mountain, now covered in snow. The slopes were a ruin of shattered walls, littered with toppled, broken statues. She sighed.

"It could not be helped. Now that we have reclaimed this place, it falls to us to defend it."

Li Ximing landed near Ning Wan, overhearing Daoist Master Kui Qi say softly,

"Daoist Friend Hengxing!"

The Great Void fluctuated, and a field of crimson light emerged. A woman in austere robes appeared, cradling an umbrella. Her expression was placid.

"Congratulations, everyone."

'Hengxing...'

'This must be Daoist Master Hengxing, of the Hengzhu Dao!'

The Hengzhu Dao and the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had grown increasingly distant in recent years. Her appearance now made the situation awkward. Li Ximing said nothing, standing silently as if he were invisible.

As soon as Hengxing appeared, the other cultivators tensed with awkwardness, uncertain what to say. Fortunately, the umbrella-holding woman spoke first, her voice soft.

"I was unable to persuade my disciple-brother. He insisted on chasing after the Great Daoist Master and that band of Buddhist cultivators. I never expected to encounter you all. This is truly a great victory."

Her words were laced with detachment. Even so, Daoist Master Kui Qi was extremely polite, even showing a trace of guilt. He said in a heavy tone,

"The Hengzhu Dao considered the greater good and still came to Tangdao Mountain. This Lin, on behalf of the Xiukui Daoist tradition, offers his sincere thanks."

It was rare for a man as proud and stubborn as Kui Qi to speak so amicably. But Hengxing was not appeased. She smiled.

"Naturally. The 'greater good' always comes first, and morality second. Isn't that how things are calculated every year? It's just that my Dao is ignorant. We calculate too little, and we don't get along with Golden Feather, so we rarely come north. Best to avoid causing trouble for you all."

Li Ximing's heart pounded as he listened to the barbed exchange. Beside him, Ning Wan sent a voice transmission:

"I've already ordered the Azure Pond cultivators to move in. You should have your people from the lake and the Capital immortals Dao... come as well to take over Baijiang Creek and Tangdao Mountain. Guarding from here will be far more tenable than from the riverbank."

Li Ximing nodded discreetly and crushed a jade talisman. At that exact moment, the heavy snow across the world suddenly ceased. A Daoist with a gourd at his waist returned, stepping on the clouds and cradling a sword. His clothes were immaculate, his eyes half-closed beneath sharp, prominent brows.

"Greetings, Great Daoist Master!"

Seeing him appear, Kui Qi visibly relaxed, the worry that had clouded his mind finally dissipating. The entire group bowed. Even Daoist Master Hengxing, so cold moments before, showed clear respect for a sword immortal of Lou Xing's caliber, bowing deeply and formally.

The Great Snow's Severing Edge in his arms pulsed with white light, circulating with images of profound harmony. It seemed to be thrumming with excitement; clearly, this outing had allowed the Spiritual Sword to finally display its might, and it was overjoyed.

The sword immortal, however, seemed unconcerned. With a light toss, he sent the Great Snow's Severing Edge flying into Ning Wan's arms.

"I had thought there might be a character on par with Jingzhan or Helian. I didn't expect the north to be filled with such filth."

His aura seemed entirely undepleted. He was, after all, a cultivator of one of the Three Shaman Daos. Li Ximing could see no sign that his lifespan was nearing its end. He looked to be in the vigorous prime of his life.

Ning Wan scrambled to catch the sword. Houfu chuckled.

"Daoist Master, with the Great Snow's Severing Edge in hand, your swordsmanship is unrivaled across four hundred years!"

Lou Xing stepped forward, casually deflecting the praise.

"Ridiculous. Look ahead, and there are True Monarchs. Where do four hundred years come from? I wouldn't even dare claim forty."

It seemed the Great Daoist Master was far more amiable with this junior, Houfu, than with Kui Qi, the nominal leader. While everyone else was reserved and respectful, only Houfu dared to offer such smiling, blatant flattery.

But modest as his words were, the three heads lay on the ground. The power of his sword was plain for all to see. If one discounted Shangyuan, claiming it was unrivaled across four hundred years was no exaggeration.

Lou Xing's return should have been a moment of celebration, but Hengxing simply bowed. "This junior takes her leave," she said quietly.

Lou Xing did not stop her, merely watching as she dissolved into light and departed. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back. Kui Qi looked as if he wanted to speak but held his tongue, his expression frustrated. The sword immortal spoke.

"All of you, return to Tiger's Frontier."

The sword immortal led the group back toward Tiger's Frontier. Li Ximing had his own spirit embryo to refine, and in any case, it would be improper to leave halfway. They soon arrived at the small, snowy courtyard on the mountain at Tiger's Frontier. It was just as he remembered: blanketed in white, bustling with busy cultivators.

They heard the Great Daoist Master at the front click his tongue in annoyance.

"Fwhoosh..."

A grey wind instantly descended, scouring the mountain clean of snow and revealing the grey-brown flagstones beneath. The blast swept all the bustling cultivators clear off the peak, leaving only an empty temple with incense smoke curling into the air.

The sword immortal said,

"Sit."

Everyone took their seats. They watched as Lou Xing straightened his sleeves, retracting the sharp, sword-like aura from his body.

"This incident with the Northern Buddhists is only the beginning, not the end. The reason I went to slay Vija and not Zhelu is precisely this."

"Zhelu is the one presiding over the Way of Emptiness. Whether it's Dharma Master or Wu Light, to make use of him, they need him alive and active. He's not the one to kill. If they were to succeed, it would merely be a repeat of the Way of Great Desire incident. But unlike them, I have no True Monarch at my back."

"Vija, on the other hand, was from the Way of Great Desire, meddling in this affair to get a piece of the pie. He made his wager and lost. Nothing surprising there."

He accepted the cup of tea Kui Qi offered him and continued quietly,

"They wanted to test me. Since I had to reveal myself sooner or later, striking early was a way to cut our losses."

Daoist Master Kui Qi bowed respectfully, listening as the Great Daoist Master spoke again.

"This business with Hengzhu... it was Golden Feather's doing, wasn't it."

"Reporting to Master..."

Here, only Kui Qi dared to take responsibility and speak. He said in a low voice,

"Yes... The... benefits that Azure Pond and Golden Feather agreed upon... it was a matter suspected to involve a True Monarch. We did not dare interfere. Still less could we ruin things for Golden Feather, who is wavering in the middle... The Supreme Yang and Golden Feather Daos have been covertly supporting each other for a very long time."

Hearing Kui Qi's explanation, the sword immortal laughed.

"If Yanque were still alive, both you and Qiushui, every last one of you, would get a vicious tongue-lashing. He would have charged out and forced that Murong Xia to spit up blood."

Kui Qi bowed his head in acknowledgment. He felt guilty, but clearly, he had no regrets.

"Sword Gate adheres to the ancestral laws, and the lessons of the past are fresh. If Azure Pond had never agreed, that would be one thing. But they *did* agree. By the time I came out of seclusion, so many... had already been consumed. If we had driven them off then, Azure Pond would have broken its oath, Golden Feather would have suffered grievous losses, and we would have let the Buddhist cultivators walk away with full pockets. The north would have been overjoyed. Would that not have been even more foolish?"

"Now, we can only hope for an opportunity to sit down and resolve this misunderstanding..."

This made Lou Xing laugh. The sword immortal, who had been famous for his fiery temper in his youth, now seemed perfectly calm. He rose and turned his back to them.

"The Three Profounds, the Four Daos, the Immortal Clan, the Imperial Scions... eventually, they all part ways. The Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition will be no exception. Those whose Daos differ cannot plan together. There is no need to force it. Three hundred years from now, the Great Xiukui Monastery might not even exist."

His voice echoed with perfect clarity in the empty temple.

"I have cultivated to this day, but I have failed to comprehend the Purple Mystery, and my divine abilities are lacking. I no longer have any hope of Fruition Attainment. In the two or three years I have left, I will serve the sword until the end."

"When my time draws near, I will go to Luoxia to see Xueyang. I will walk the final leg of my Way of the Sword and settle that old dispute—the one between the sword technique and the sword of intent. I will go... and see his sword."

The sword immortal spoke with a faint smile.

"Perhaps without the Great Snow's Severing Edge, my own sword light will not match the strike I made today. But this Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... I leave it to you."

Everyone rose from their seats and bowed deeply. They watched as he floated up, transforming into a faint wisp of dark vapor before vanishing completely. The white snow began to fall upon Tiger's Frontier once more, drifting through the empty courtyard.




# Chapter 897: Pushing North

The sword immortal vanished in a streak of light, leaving the others standing alone on the mountain. Kui Qi's voice was heavy with sorrow.

"We respectfully see Master off!"

Everyone bowed as one.

"We respectfully see the Great Daoist Master off!"

'Green Pine Supreme Yang…'

Li Ximing sighed to himself. He didn't know the full depths of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, but their power level was plain to see. With Lou Xing's departure, who among them could ever match the presence of such a sword immortal?

The group resettled. Daoist Master Houfu looked melancholic, busying himself by pulling spirit tea from a storage bag and beginning to brew it.

Daoist Master Kui Qi spoke, his voice grave. "Today, we slew thirteen of the Merciful Ones, while six of them perished. This is a great victory. We have blunted the ferocious advance of the Buddhist cultivators and severed the grasping hand of the Way of Great Desire. By securing our position on Tangdao Mountain, we can now consolidate our efforts."

Hearing this, Tinglan spoke softly. "The Way of Emptiness was already weak. That one Dharma Master transcended his self-attachment all at once, refusing to preserve even a single mote of his True Spirit. There has been no word of him since. That event caused the simultaneous fall of two Mahas from the Kosa Temple, and the Buddhist Land itself was nearly lost!"

"If the Maha from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm hadn't intervened, 'Emptiness' would be indistinguishable from 'Wrath'. It's a shame the other aspects propped each other up, muddied the waters, and pushed their influence here into Jiangbei."

"A true pity."

As Li Ximing listened to them, Ning Wan interjected.

"Primordial Magnetism is surging on Tangdao Mountain. We must set up an array. It will serve to both gather the mountain's Primordial Magnetism and to defend against the Buddhist cultivators. This mountain seals the pass to the south. With Golden Feather to the west and Chengyun to the east, securing it will make our rear safe."

Ning Wan was the Azure Pond Sect's genius of array daos, and Tinglan also had her own legacy. Kui Qi, who was in charge, was also well-researched in arrays. This point should have been an early consensus. Kui Qi nodded.

"That makes sense. We don't need to overdo it. A temporary main array with ten or twenty sub-arrays will cover the mountain tightly. There's just one problem."

He looked up, his expression turning serious and troubled. "We don't need to design a special formation for this mountain; it would take three to five years to complete. We can just build a few array nodes and deploy the Purple Mansion Realm array disks I have stored at Xiukui."

"The three of us are more than enough to handle it. However, given Tangdao Mountain's spiritual veins, only Primordial Lightning is truly suitable. Other Daoist traditions would be easier, but the Three Lightning Dao... it descends from the Northern Palace and is part of Encompassing Profoundity. We are completely ignorant of it."

"And where can one even find a respectable Primordial Lightning Daoist tradition today?"

Tinglan replied, "Since it's a Daoist tradition of Encompassing Profoundity, we should inquire with the Northern Sea. The Lightning Dao may be obscure, but the Xie family and the North Ring Sect still exist... Furthermore... could we perhaps ask Mount Changhuai and the True Dao Unification Gate?"

Mount Changhuai in the Wu State was one thing, but the True Dao Unification Gate was the sect established at Azure Jade Cliff by Nian Yi, a disciple of the Yue Cultivating Sect who had inherited True Monarch Shangyuan's Daoist tradition. Hearing this, Kui Qi's expression turned grim.

"We can ask," he cautioned, "but don't count on it. We'd best prepare to use my Xiukui's Black Wave Piercing Sea Spirit Array. Borrowing what we need won't be easy this time."

The other two fell silent. Tinglan quickly shook her head and changed the subject.

"Then there's the Sacred Writ Gate. Zhu Gong is severely wounded and has vanished. Her subordinates are fighting uncontrollably. I sent someone with orders to make them stop, but the situation is still a complete mess."

At the mention of Zhu Gong, Kui Qi sighed with a trace of helplessness.

"She left the moment my back was turned. She clearly doesn't trust me. Try to use whatever profound abilities you have to contact her. Tell her to come back. Whether it's Zhaojing's alchemy or our own Daoist scriptures, anything we can offer is better than her struggling alone in the Eastern Sea."

With the discussion settled, Tinglan bowed.

"Qiuhu and I will head into the mountains first. We'll survey the terrain and spiritual veins, and also stand watch in case anyone with ill intentions tries to tamper with the area."

"Go," Kui Qi said, dismissing them.

The wind and snow on the summit intensified. Li Ximing, having waited patiently, finally found his chance to speak.

He sighed. "I've been entangled in so many matters recently... I was hoping to ask about..."

Kui Qi, of course, knew what he wanted to ask. He waved his hand dismissively.

"You're asking about the spirit embryo. I've already given it some thought. I also saw your Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire. I recognized it at a glance as something from the Comprehending Profoundity dao. In artifact refinement, that path often seeks external spiritual items and the nourishment of others' dharma power to rapidly forge an artifact."

"Our Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, however, does not use such spell arts for refinement. We have no fondness for sacrificial methods. We rely on internal refinement and nourishment from our own divine abilities. Even the spirit embryos of the Upper Shaman dao are typically forged by a cultivator using their own abilities."

'So Changxi's Daoist tradition truly does stem from Comprehending Profoundity…'

Li Ximing bowed. "It was my oversight..."

But Kui Qi shook his head.

"It's not a problem. I know you're refining this spirit embryo for Dilu Tian Sanglin of the Southern Songzhou Luoshe. I'm not sure which of his descendants it's for... In any case, I remember there is a Daoist Master in Qize who cultivates the Upper Shaman path. He can refine it for you."

Daoist Master Kui Qi was clearly being very helpful. Li Ximing was overjoyed and was about to offer his thanks, but the Daoist Master held up a hand and smiled.

"Don't thank me yet. I want to discuss this matter with you."

"The Buddhist cultivators to the north have not given up their ambitions. This Daoist Master from Qize possesses rare skills, but he refuses to get involved, making it difficult to secure his help. When he comes to the lake, you should arrange for him to visit Mount Wu. If the discussion goes well, you can then try asking him. Persuading him would be the ideal outcome."

"After all, this doesn't concern just one family."

Li Ximing nodded, realizing the implication. 'He suspects that because my family occupied Mount Wu so early, we might have discovered some powerful shamanic artifacts or legacies within the ruins. Something that could be used to move this Daoist Master.'

He agreed to the arrangement, but sighed. "The only issue is that when my family occupied Mount Wu, it was already a desolate ruin. It had been picked clean by countless Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. I fear there is nothing impressive left to show him."

The two exchanged a few more pleasantries before Kui Qi gestured to the tea, politely dismissing him. Only after Li Ximing transformed into a ray of light and departed did Daoist Master Houfu speak.

"The Li family is a mortal enemy of the Buddhist cultivators. At this critical moment, they fear a southern push far more than we do."

Kui Qi nodded. "Exactly. That's why I pulled him in early. Whether it was the matter of the Sichuan or this great array, we're looking out for him. By helping him succeed, we distribute the pressure from the Buddhist cultivators. It's not every day you find a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who is wholeheartedly on your side. We can't just let him perish. As for the Li Zhouwei situation... we'll adapt as it develops."

He brushed that matter aside. With Li Ximing gone, there were things they could finally discuss. A look of cold resentment crossed his face.

"In the end," he said in a low voice, "the Grotto-Heaven never descended. In years past, when the Great One made a move, even the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven couldn't resist. And now? Secret Diffusion didn't even open!"

Kui Qi's voice grew sharp and cold. "Have we ever been greedy enough to ask for Wanling Heaven? But Secret Diffusion is different! It's a Mystic Realm! A Mystic Realm listed in the Seventy-Two Grotto-Profoundity Scrolls! The mountain itself was a gift from Wei! The original master of Secret Diffusion of the Seventy-Two Grottoes was named Li! And they dare claim there's no trace of the scroll? That the Mystic Realm won't open?! This is utterly humiliating!"

A cold glint flashed in his eyes as he raged. "So they sent the token over early, deliberately opened the gate, and then, while 'stabilizing' the Grotto-Heaven, they condescended to toss down three or five swords and a dozen dharma artifacts. Then they immediately kicked everyone out! No trace of the Treasure Rhyme Gourd! The Sui Gengchen is in the Great One's sea of qi! And not a single clue about the Stargazing Bronze Sparrow! After a full search, not even one Mihua Spirit Elixir was found! Good. *Good.* Their desire to humiliate our Supreme Yang is painfully obvious!"

Houfu had obviously been suppressing his own rage. His expression darkened as he spoke, his voice cold.

"It's true. What happened in Anhuai Heaven, with its Metallic Essence, was chaotic but perhaps understandable. But they started their scheming back during the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven! The Elucidation of Chongyuan's Supplemental Law vanished. The Supreme Yang Glazed Pagoda was snatched away, leaving behind a mere ritual vessel. If Senior Yuanxiu hadn't been so profound, we would have lost the Huai River Map in Anhuai Heaven as well!"

"And even before that! They claimed Guo E killed the Tang family. How could he possibly have done it? It was all for the Sun Seeker Ring! In the old days, with several Great Daoist Masters present, they never went too far. Now, they are utterly shameless!"

After they spoke, the long-suppressed anger vented, but they still had to face reality. Kui Qi remained silent. Houfu turned and sipped his tea.

'And what if it is?…'

Houfu looked out at the suddenly empty courtyard. "Martial Uncle, the courtyard is certainly peaceful now."

The Great Xiukui Monastery had a tradition of "hard labor." Based on the principles of embracing nature and understanding mortal life, it was the one arduous duty required of all cultivators. Every few years, they had to perform this labor, a testament to the sect's ideal of seclusion and detachment from worldly affairs.

When his Martial Uncle Kui Qi took charge of the sect, he changed the location. He gathered all the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators obligated to perform this duty and had them tend to tea fields and farms on the mountain summit, all with great fanfare.

Others didn't understand, but Houfu knew his Martial Uncle's intent. It was simply to show the Great Daoist Master how this rule wore down the cultivators, all in the hopes of having it changed.

Now, the sword immortal had brushed them all away with a sleeve and departed, leaving a perfect opportunity to change the ancestral rules.

"It should have been changed long ago," Kui Qi said. "It's nothing but a waste of cultivation time. You and I both went through it. Farming is just farming. Those who can find enlightenment in it would find it anyway. As for those who can't, you could make them farm the entirety of Tiger's Frontier and it would be useless."

Houfu savored his tea, finally daring to speak. "Martial Uncle," he ventured, "the Great Daoist Master may not have liked your intentions, but he understood them. It's just... I haven't been back in a while. About the Lingu family..."

Kui Qi said nothing, remaining silent for a long moment. At last, he spoke. "It's not proper to discuss. Go... go ask the Northern Sea."

...

Jiangbei.

Li Ximing crossed from the riverbank and headed north. He passed Baiye Creek and saw that the Baijiang Creek area was orderly and well-demarcated. Li Jiangxia was descending on a ray of Heavenly Light to greet him.

At his side, a half-step behind, was the dao-robed Guan Gongxiao, following respectfully. On the other side, Ding Weizeng clutched his weapon, clearly out of place with the Capital immortals Dao cultivators. His expression was stiff, only softening when he saw Li Ximing.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master," Li Jiangxia said. "The three Secret Diffusion territories have been pacified. The various cultivators have been driven off, and the local families have submitted. Only the Wang clan members have gathered north of Fanyun, with Chengyun at their backs. We have not sent anyone to engage them."

"Hn."

With the Li family's current power, it would have been strange if Li Jiangxia *hadn't* been able to pacify the White River area instantly. From the current arrangement, it was clear the Capital immortals Dao hadn't dared to claim a single scrap of land, yielding everything.

Li Ximing descended as Li Jiangxia continued his report.

"The various Daoist Masters and Buddhist cultivators who intervened captured many people. The local powers are terrified. As for the remnants of the Hall of the Locust Soul, they have all but vanished. Only a few who were sheltering under Xiao Yuan remain, and we've gathered them on the mountain."

"I was concerned there might be close confidants of Xiao Yuan among them, so I have not been overly harsh. I've sent a few people to question them. We should have clarity in two or three days."

Li Ximing listened impassively. "What of Wang Quwan?"

Li Jiangxia lowered his gaze. "He and Wang Xiaoxiao were taken to Chengyun Gate and have not yet returned. Wang Quyu sent a letter. It's clear he's in a difficult position, but the letter is still filled with empty pleasantries."

He held the letter up with both hands. Li Ximing merely glanced at it, not bothering to read it. Since his family members had already entered another's sect, Li Ximing naturally wouldn't trouble them further.

"Send a reply. Tell him there is no need to write again."

"Yes, sir."

The man immediately retracted the letter. Guan Gongxiao, standing to the side, bowed respectfully.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master... all cultivators of Capital immortals Dao are present and await your orders."

Guan Gongxiao's feelings were undoubtedly complex, even bewildered, but Li Ximing paid him no mind.

"We have pacified Tangdao Mountain," Li Ximing said lightly. "The Buddhist cultivators will not let this go easily. We will have to hold it for some time."

"If this mountain is breached, we will be forced to retreat to the riverbank. The other families have Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to protect them; their fate is unknown. But your Daoist Master is not present. Your Capital immortals Dao will be the first to be annihilated."

Guan Gongxiao broke into a cold sweat and bowed deeply. "Capital immortals Dao would not dare to do anything but serve you to the death!"

Li Ximing waved his hand, dismissing him.

Once the Capital immortals Dao's sect master had flown off, Li Jiangxia lowered his voice.

"Daoist Master, we also found two or three... dharma artifacts... but they had already fallen into the hands of rogue cultivators and local clan cultivators. These people did not flee; they remained in the mountains and came to pay their respects the moment our men arrived. We found quite a few cultivation manuals, but we are still tracing their origins. We only have one manual in hand that is worthy of your attention."

"They are clever, at least," Li Ximing noted.

Li Jiangxia pressed on. "My thought was... we should not pursue the matter of one or two dharma artifacts. We can use this to demonstrate our family's impartiality."

Li Ximing recognized that Li Jiangxia was likely seeking his confirmation before reporting back to Li Jianglong on the island. He saw through it but simply gestured for Li Jiangxia to handle it himself.

"Where are Li Quantao's people?" Li Ximing asked, changing the subject. "And that group of Secret Diffusion remnants, the cultivators who were released into Jiangbei?"

Li Jiangxia replied respectfully, "Li Quantao and his son were urgently recalled to the Azure Pond Sect... we have no news. Fei Tonglu and Fei Tongcai have vanished, perhaps taken by someone during the chaos. As for the few who walked right into our net by returning to Jiangbei... most were killed by the local clans. We have located two survivors and brought them here."

His expression turned strange. "It is said... these two are no longer who they were."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He saw the old man, Qu Bushi, escorting a man and a woman forward. They were dressed differently from Jiangbei cultivators. The man's eyes were wide with fury, and the woman's face was etched with resentment.

'I can tell with a single glance they've been influenced by a True Monarch. They must have met him long ago. No wonder Jiangxia didn't dare to handle this.'

After so many incidents in the north, Li Ximing had gained experience. This was why True Monarchs were more terrifying to those at the Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining stages—their minds could be subtly influenced. By the Foundation Establishment Realm and Purple Mansion Realm, while still terrifying, they wouldn't just casually seize control of one's mind.

The moment the seal on the man's mouth was released, he began to scream, "Lord Lin is the reincarnation of Secret Diffusion's True Monarch! How dare you! All the clans in this land are protected by the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition! You actually crossed the river... Shameless! Utterly shameless!"

No one on site paid the man any attention. Li Jiangxia respectfully offered a jade slip. Li Ximing scanned it with his spiritual sense and saw three words:

"Feathered Adept's Chant."

This was indeed the Feathered Adept's Chant from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition. He had obtained half a copy from Wenhu years ago; this one was complete, from beginning to end, without a single omission.

'The Great One's legacy is rich indeed.'

This protective manual, The Feathered Adept's Chant, was at least 5th-Grade. It was undoubtedly a significant gain, the kind of benefit one gets from seizing territory. Others couldn't take away these scattered things. But this was likely all there was.

Only the man was still screaming, an image of unyielding loyalty.

Li Ximing swept his gaze over him. The man's talent wasn't bad; he was already at the ninth level of Qi Refining, a step away from the Foundation Establishment Realm. Before Li Ximing could react, the man cursed again.

"And you, Li Zhaojing! Unworthy of the title Daoist Ma—"

He didn't know Li Ximing's True Name, so he used his Daoist title. The moment he spoke, the faces of everyone present changed. Li Jiangxia was shocked and furious. Qu Bushi looked like his very soul was about to scatter. But before the "Master" could even leave his lips, the man's entire body flashed white-hot. Like a scrap of cloth, he exploded into a cloud of Heavenly Light.

*Bang!*

The man was annihilated on the spot. The woman's face turned ashen. Before she could even open her mouth, she dissolved from head to toe into mist, joining her companion in death. Everyone present dropped to their knees in terror, begging for forgiveness.

Li Ximing was unconcerned. He put away *Feathered Adept's Chant*. The Daoist Masters who had plundered the area had taken anything good. The fact these two were left behind spoke to their quality. They hated his family with a passion and were doomed to die. A death at his hands was a quick release.

"Thoroughly investigate all the cultivation manuals scattered in this territory. I am heading north."

He waved them away, stepped into the light, and soared toward Tangdao Mountain.

He arrived to find the mountain covered in heavy snow. The ruined walls had been mostly torn down, revealing bare slopes dotted with cultivators flying back and forth.

But looking around, there were not many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the green robes of the Azure Pond Sect. The majority were the purple-robed disciples of the Purple Smoke Gate, many of whom he recognized from his visit there years ago.

'The Azure Pond Sect suffered a grievous blow. They are clearly still far from recovered.'

He swept his gaze across the scene, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. He stepped through the air and materialized beside a woman in red.

It was Li Minggong. She had already reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Dressed in a red skirt, she stood atop a column of flame, apparently using a spell art to manage the fire. Seeing Li Ximing, she quickly bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow, noting her consolidated cultivation and the natural aura of her abilities. She had clearly benefited greatly. "Good... That spirit pill was not wasted."

Li Minggong bowed again. "I just emerged from seclusion when I encountered two Daoist Masters passing over the lake. They ordered my family's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to bring people here, but our forces are in Jiangbei. As my cultivation is the highest, I came ahead on my fire and brought a few people."

Li Ximing nodded, offered a word of praise, and vanished in a streak of light.

He reappeared before Tinglan, who was riding in the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion suspended in mid-air. He wasn't sure if this was her true body. She stood upon a cloud of Purple Qi, the Supreme Minister's Gourd hanging from her waist, looking simple and unadorned.

Li Ximing had not sought her out without reason. As the pressure from the northern Buddhist cultivators mounted, he grew increasingly anxious. He had set his sights on her 'World's Radiance'.

Whether he could even transcend the Purple Mystery was unknown, but he knew his next two divine abilities had to be the Body Divine Ability and the Life Divine Ability. It was just a question of which came first.

'If the day comes when Jiangbei can no longer be defended and the Buddhist cultivators pour south, survival will be all that matters! It will be hard enough to protect my own life, let alone the lives of the children in my family!'

His own close-combat abilities were already formidable. With the Life Divine Ability in hand, his own survivability—and that of his clan's disciples—would take a qualitative leap. With the Buddhist cultivators looming, Li Ximing had to prepare for the worst.

As for Tinglan's advice to cultivate his second divine ability before tackling the Life Divine Ability, Li Ximing had guessed from her hints that it was likely related to the stability of his mind. Since he possessed the Talisman Seed, he naturally had an extra layer of protection.

Seeing Li Ximing, Tinglan smiled. "Zhaojing, your cultivation... it has truly progressed immensely..."

Li Ximing laughed and demurred. "It's been too long, Daoist Friend. How are your injuries?"

"I still have some time to endure," Tinglan replied, her expression dimming. "I was nurturing an immortal foundation within my sea of qi," she said softly. "After this incident, I must cultivate it all over again. But that's secondary. My 'Purple Qi' dharma body is difficult to nourish. Damaging it is a grievous blow to my vital energy."

"If there are any medicinal pills you need, please don't hesitate to ask me."

Li Ximing offered some words of comfort, then adopted a worried expression. Tinglan noticed his unease.

"What is troubling you?"

He sighed. "I was planning to continue refining a divine ability, but after hearing your words, I've grown concerned. After all, a great battle with the northern Buddhist cultivators is inevitable. That Body Divine Ability I'm working on... I only have a single wisp of its qi left. If I'm injured in the coming battle and have to start cultivating it all over again, it would be a terrible setback."

Li Ximing's worry seemed well-founded, and Tinglan nodded. He continued, "That's when I remembered your sect's 'World's Radiance'. How does one gather the qi for it? If it's more convenient than my current path, that would be for the best."

Tinglan's expression was complicated. "It is certainly much more convenient," she said softly. "Our Purple Smoke Gate has a stockpile of the Luminous Heart Origin Qi required. It isn't difficult to collect, and almost no one in the sect cultivates it. I... I can give it to you."

Li Ximing immediately waved his hands in refusal.

"I cannot accept a reward I have not earned. This is a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation art, and a Life Divine Ability that continues a Daoist tradition at that. There is no reason for me to receive it for free."

Seeing her hesitation, Li Ximing pressed gently, "I only have one question. When I asked you before, you told me to complete my Body Divine Ability before cultivating this one. What was the reason for that?"

Tinglan replied, "It's not a strict limitation. It's just... this Life Divine Ability is somewhat unorthodox. I was hoping you would refine more abilities, grow older, and gain a more profound mastery over your powers. Cultivating it then would be better."

"Secondly... I visited the Great Daoist Master back then and specifically asked about this. His cultivation is profound, and he resolved my doubts... He said that 'World's Radiance' should come at the *end* of all Bright Yang techniques. It is the pinnacle of the Bright Yang path, the final divine ability one should use to seek Fruition Attainment. Cultivating it at any other stage... simply does not provide the same immense benefit to one's Golden Core."

When Li Ximing heard this, he was overjoyed. Why would he fear such a thing, so long as there was no cultivation conflict or negative impact on his next divine ability?

'In any case, there is no way I am saving 'World's Radiance' for last. These three abilities are set in stone. This is just a reminder for Zhouwei. As for whether he confronts... how he handles the matter of Emperor Wei... that is all up to him.'

He laughed heartily and shook his head.

"I have no such lofty ambitions! In all of Jiangnan, how many truly aim for the Golden Core? I just want to protect my life and save my family!"



# Chapter 898: Consolidation

Just as he finished speaking, a cold wind gusted. Ning Wan arrived, riding a flurry of snow, and landed nearby. She seemed slightly surprised to see Li Ximing but nodded in greeting.

Tinglan gave her an extra glance before composing herself. "Since Zhaojing has already decided," she said softly, "I will not say more. I shall explain it to you here."

"My Purple Smoke Gate was once known as the Purple Smoke Abbey, just a minor abbey in this region. We had our own small Daoist tradition and were loosely affiliated with the Wanling Upper Sect. During the age of the Immortal Mansion, Jiangnan was relatively peaceful, and our cultivators often traveled the mortal world."

"Later, our founder, Taixu, returned from his studies. His divine abilities shook heaven and earth, and he established the Supreme Yang orthodoxy for the Purple Smoke Gate. However, the 'World's Radiance' lineage we possess is not a remnant of the Supreme Yang. Its origins are far older. The cultivation art is literally titled 'World's Radiance,' not 'Luminous Heart.' It was left behind by an ancient cultivator of the Li clan who fled south during a calamity."

Li Ximing listened intently as she continued.

"The required Spiritual Qi must be gathered daily from the very first bright ray of dawn. During the collection, it is supplemented and refined with various spiritual items to produce it. This is different from the common techniques in Jiangnan; it uses the Method of Pure Light. It is suitable for all four seasons, and the collection time is not long."

"Our sect has three portions prepared. Even if we needed a few more, it wouldn't take long. As for what Purple Smoke wants in return..."

Tinglan sighed softly. "In this current situation, it's complicated. Although Purple Smoke possesses this cultivation art, it is tied to an old rebellion. No one cultivates it anymore; just keeping it is taboo. We would rather exchange it for a different Purple Mansion Realm art. That would at least provide another path for us."

Li Ximing nodded to himself. The two parties were allies and had to face the situation in the north together. It was natural they wouldn't create complications for each other. This was, without a doubt, the most sensible arrangement.

He hesitated for a moment. His family didn't have many arts they could trade. Even as allies, the *Radiant Essence Scripture* was not something to be given away. The only Purple Mansion Realm arts they could publicly offer were the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra*, the *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*, the *Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra*, and the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra*.

'The *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass* was from the Cui family. Azure Pond and Xiukui already divided the arts from the Golden Tang Gate; Purple Smoke likely received a share as well...'

Sure enough, Tinglan spoke softly.

"The *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* belongs to the 'Jade True' lineage. I heard that after the Jiang family was destroyed, it ended up on the lake. The Yu family of that era entered Yuanwu Peak. I've overheard seniors discussing it; back then, word was that the lineage's qi had been severed. One could only sigh in regret."

"Now, however, the 'Jade True' path is experiencing a great resurgence. I hear your esteemed clan can already cultivate it... and has even developed a method for gathering its specific qi..."

Li Ximing smiled.

"That part isn't difficult. The only issue is that Courtly Red Dust Qi is scarce. Even with the auxiliary methods my family employs, the next available portion won't be ready for over two years. If you give me a portion of the Luminous Heart Origin Qi now, I will have that portion of Courtly Red Dust Qi delivered to Purple Smoke when it is ready."

Tinglan naturally understood how rare Courtly Red Dust Qi was; its value was far greater than that of the Luminous Heart Origin Qi, and it was just as difficult for the Li family to acquire. If it weren't, Li Queyi, who was currently cultivating at Purple Smoke, would have started practicing the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* long ago. Who would pass up a complete Purple Mansion Realm Daoist tradition? She understood his offer of one portion now implied a larger, ongoing exchange, so she simply nodded, settling the matter.

Ning Wan had been listening quietly the entire time. As a cultivator from Azure Pond, she was well aware that her sect had a hand in the Jiang family's destruction. Although Azure Pond's disciples couldn't practice this art, a copy was almost certainly hidden away in their Daoist repositories. She simply kept silent, not wanting to spoil the trade.

With the deal struck, Tinglan rode off on the wind to retrieve the art. Li Ximing had already memorized the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra*, so he didn't need a physical copy; he could just transcribe it from memory. He took this brief opportunity to voice the question bothering him.

"I noticed Tinglan was extremely guarded... That rebellion must have been a major affair."

At this, Ning Wan's expression turned regretful. She replied:
"You can't blame her. The matter is incredibly complex and difficult to speak about... I know a few vague details, at least. I can try to explain."

"The 'World's Radiance' lineage is passed down by Ziqi Peak. Back then, Ziqi Peak was at its zenith and had held the inheritance for a long time. One of their disciples achieved the rank of Daoist Master, taking the Daoist name Ting Qian."

"When this Ting Qian... became a Daoist Master, his own master, Daoist Master Yuanjing, was guarding the sect and in closed-door cultivation. The other two Daoist Masters, Zipei and Zimu, were away on personal matters. One had fled to the Eastern Sea, and the other... had vanished without a trace. This unexpectedly left Ting Qian in charge."

Ning Wan seemed hesitant to continue, her voice dropping.

"At the time, Ziqi Peak was poised to become the foremost peak. This Daoist Master Ting Qian was not only powerful, but he also had a disciple under him... who was also exceptionally talented. But when he attained his divine ability... he let his base nature take over. He acted perversely, forcing her and several other disciples to dual cultivate with him... And within the entire Purple Smoke Gate, not a single person spoke out."

Her voice became almost inaudible. She turned her head away, sighed, and continued.

"When Daoist Master Yuanjing emerged from seclusion, he was initially joyful to hear a new Daoist Master had appeared, but he was immediately struck speechless by the situation. He summoned the disciples for questioning. Naturally, they all claimed it was consensual, weeping uncontrollably. But with his Life Divine Ability in play, who could tell if they were sincere? They even brought in one of Xiukui's Spiritual Artifacts, but unexpectedly, this particular Life Divine Ability was somewhat insidious. The investigation became a tangled mess and only brought more scandals to light."

"The scandal was public for a time, but what happened next was kept from the outside world. We only heard that Ting Qian was executed, and the female disciple committed suicide in indignation. Daoist Master Yuanjing was devastated and never recovered, eventually perishing in the west. After that, the matter was never spoken of again."

Li Ximing was shaken by the story, his brow furrowed deeply.

Apart from Chi Wei, who had become corrupt in his old age, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's moral standards were undoubtedly higher than those overseas. The lower ranks were debatable, but at least they maintained appearances. And in earlier eras, the rules were even stricter. This, however... this was truly difficult to comment on.

'Daoist Master Chengyan of the Changxiao Gate did far worse... and it only earned him a few jokes. A Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, if he truly wanted dual cultivation partners, wouldn't need to be so extreme... Ning Wan probably understated the situation. That female disciple must have been an important direct descendant of the Kan and Wen families.'

'This rebellion likely caused a generational gap in the Purple Smoke Gate. It directly cost them two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and one promising candidate. Otherwise, the Great Daoist Master wouldn't have needed to go all the way to the lands of Qi to recruit Tinglan, an outsider who started her cultivation late, as a disciple.'

They both fell into a strained silence, wary of the taboo topic. After a long while, Tinglan returned, riding a stream of Purple Qi. She appeared much calmer as she passed a jade slip and a jade bottle from her sleeve to Li Ximing.

"Here you are."

Li Ximing accepted them calmly. He swept his spiritual sense over the jade slip and saw the title written within:

*Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart*

This cultivation art was indeed fourth-grade, on par with the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra*. Li Ximing stored it away and offered his thanks. The two Daoist Masters then turned the conversation to the situation in the mountains. Ning Wan spoke first.

"The Way of Emptiness has retreated, but they will certainly return. The Way of Great Desire was hit hard, so they probably can't dispatch any experts for a while. But the powers *behind* the Way of Emptiness have gauged our strength. They won't give up. They will eventually come again."

"It's just that with their retreat, the north is now desolate. The temples are empty. Monks and Master Monks alike, not a single one remains. There is nothing... except for masses of common people, slowly migrating north. These people... are difficult to manage."

"We absolutely cannot send our own people to occupy that territory; it would just stretch our forces thin for no gain. But if we ignore them, there are many demonic cultivators in the north. Countless people will die... Yet if we try to bring them to Jiangbei..."

Ning Wan looked worried. "These people are all fervent followers of the Buddhists. They don't even fear suicide. I'm afraid bringing them here would be inviting trouble. We would only end up adding to the slaughter."

Li Ximing understood her anxiety. The Baijiang Creek region was sparsely populated, so he asked.

"Daoist Friend, your Life Divine Ability... could it save them?"

Both women shook their heads. Ning Wan answered.

"This has nothing to do with divine abilities. They genuinely believe in suffering in this life to enjoy bliss in the next, and that falling to the demonic path means certain hell. They aren't being influenced by any power; this is their true faith."

Hearing this, Li Ximing realized just how thorny the problem was. When comparing the Immortals and the Buddhists, the Immortals were far behind in winning the 'hearts of the people.' He sighed internally and said.

"Then our only option is to send ten or twenty people to guide them to the territory of the Lotus Temple. Otherwise, having hundreds or thousands slaughtered at the foot of our mountain... it reflects poorly on us."

"That is one way to handle it."

It was undeniably absurd. They had just driven back the northern forces, and now they had to send the refugees *to* them—even if it was to the Way of Joyful Bliss's Lotus Temple. It was an extremely uncomfortable solution. Tinglan's expression was grim, but given the circumstances, she could only concede.

"After all, the Lotus Temple hasn't made any hostile moves so far. That 'Jinlian' in particular has an ambiguous attitude. For now, we should try to keep that Daoist tradition stable. It's best if we don't give them a reason to get involved."

Tinglan then took a jade talisman from her sleeve and handed it to him. "The situation in the north could change at any moment," she reminded him. "If something urgent happens, I will use this talisman to alert you. When that time comes, I must ask you to come north immediately to help us resolve the crisis."

Li Ximing, with his divine abilities and Spiritual Artifacts, might not be able to confront Maha, but he was unquestionably the best choice for suppressing the Merciful One. He had experience, and the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition clearly needed him. Li Ximing, however, naturally wanted more time to prepare. He quickly cupped his hands.

"I happen to be on the verge of mastering one or two Dharma Arts. Since you two Daoist Friends will be guarding the mountain, I will return to my seclusion!"

This was, after all, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's home turf, so Li Ximing didn't overstep. His objective achieved, he agreed to their request, transformed into a ray of light, and departed, landing back at the lake.

With the Li family's forces all stationed at Baijiang Creek and Tangdao Mountain, the lake estate felt deserted. He flew into the main hall and found Li Jianglong listening to a report from a man in white robes.

The white-robed man was strikingly handsome and carried himself with an elegant air; it was, of course, Fei Qing'yi of the Fei family.

'Right, the Fei family. I need to send them to Xiukui soon. Fei Qing'yi himself, however, can stay for a bit. Tangdao Mountain is short on manpower, after all.'

Seeing Li Ximing materialize from a flash of light, Fei Qing'yi dropped to his knees with a thud. Li Jianglong also rose from his seat and bowed deeply to the Daoist Master.

"Greetings, Lord!"

Without needing a gesture from Li Ximing, Li Jianglong spoke respectfully.
"The family's second contingent of cultivators, led by Guest Elder Fei, is preparing to depart as reinforcements for Jiangbei. After the handover is complete, Jiangxia will lead his people and transfer to Tangdao Mountain to defend against the north."

Li Ximing waved his hand, dismissing Fei Qing'yi. His gaze fell on a youth standing to the side. Li Jianglong immediately introduced him.

"This is my clan cousin, Li Jiangzong. He is a talent from the first branch and used to follow Lady Minggong. He is currently on the island, managing affairs in Qingdu. Among the brothers of the first branch, he is the most promising."

"Mm."

Li Ximing had heard of him. He saw the young man's expression was respectful and calm, and he nodded inwardly. He wasn't exceptionally brilliant, but in these times, one couldn't ask for too much. Talented and obedient was good enough.

He didn't expect much from Li Zhouming, anyway. The family had four branches, and for the first branch to produce someone like Li Jiangzong was already fortunate. He smiled.

"You've been working hard."

"It is this junior's duty!"

Li Jianglong bowed again, speaking deferentially.

"It's just that... a few months ago, my wife conceived, and I am overjoyed. But I have long been unable to settle on a name. Now that I see you, Daoist Master, I was hoping you might bestow a name, to let the child be blessed by your spiritual grace!"

'Clever. Seizing every opportunity.' Li Ximing thought, smiling and shaking his head. Still, it was good news. He pondered for a moment and replied.

"...This is truly a name your father should choose. But since you have asked me, I will oblige. A great war is imminent, chaos is rampant, and so many have gone north. We should choose an auspicious name. Let us designate the name 'Huan' (Return)."

"Li Suihuan."

Li Jianglong immediately prostrated himself, tears streaming down his face as he spoke with profound respect.

"This junior thanks the Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing glanced over and saw Li Jiangzong, standing behind Li Jianglong, looking thoughtful. He nodded to himself.

'He may not be as shrewd as Jianglong or Jiangxia, but at least he understands what just happened.'

One had to understand that of all Li Zhouwei's children, only Li Jiangqian had a name (Qian - 迁) that used the 'movement' radical (辶). The others—Jianglong, Jiangxia, Jiangliang—did not follow the generational naming convention. There was even an implicit intent in the clan law to exclude them. For Li Jianglong to have a son now, naming him was a major political issue!

Li Jianglong seizing the opportunity, insisting that he, the Daoist Master, provide the name, and immediately prostrating himself—it was all because he didn't dare make such a presumptuous move himself. He was just asking for a name, but it was *which* name that mattered.

Faced with this little scheme, Li Ximing felt rather complicated. He just waved his sleeve.

"Things are difficult for the family right now. You may also have to go north. Be careful."

To put it bluntly, aside from Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan, everyone was expendable in the current struggle against the north. Yet even as Li Ximing wanted to keep those two by his side on the island, he worried. If they never experienced real combat, never struggled on the brink of life and death, they would never be properly tempered.

'Reaching the Purple Mansion Realm isn't just about talent. Without my master, without my brother Xijun, without all those years of suffering and setbacks our family endured, how could I possibly have passed that threshold?'

'Jiangqian is doing better, but Que'wan... she's had it too easy. She's been protected too well all these years. Just letting her cultivate peacefully isn't right.'

He remained silent for a long time before his body dissolved into a stream of light and floated away. He reappeared in the center of the island, where he found Li Que'wan. As expected, she was cultivating, practicing her arts. Her cultivation base was solid, only a single step away from the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. Li Ximing bade her rise and spoke softly.

"Go into seclusion for now. You don't need to polish your cultivation base any further. In the events to come, you will be required to face the enemy."

Hearing this, Li Que'wan's expression turned solemn. She bowed and immediately withdrew.

The inner sanctum of the island fell empty and silent. Li Ximing felt a wave of hesitation.

'I can't rest easy sending them out for 'experience' if I have to watch over them constantly. Forget it... I'll just have to take it one step at a time.'

It used to be that several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators would discuss the Li family's major affairs. Li Ximing was just a junior then; he didn't have to lead, just fill in the gaps. Now, he was a Daoist Master with a divine ability, the *only* Daoist Master. Those beneath him were full of their own thoughts but dared not speak. And there was certainly no one left who dared offer him advice...

'Even Grandfather speaks to me with veiled caution now... How can I expect anything from anyone else?'

He finally made his way to the main hall. He saw the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda standing there, having reverted to its true form. Within it, one could faintly see the roiling energies of water, fire, wind, and thunder.

He transformed into a ray of Heavenly Light and flew into the pagoda, sealing the entrance behind him with his divine ability. He landed directly on the highest level, the Pavilion of Northern Palace Thunder. He wrapped the jade talisman Tinglan had given him in his power and suspended it within the lightning, setting it so that it would shatter at the slightest disturbance. Only then did he close his eyes. His spiritual sense soared upward, reaching for the Talisman Seed within his Shengyang Acupoint.

Tinglan would use the talisman to alert him, but his family was large and had many affairs. If a guest arrived or trouble brewed while Li Que'wan was in seclusion, his family members would come to the pagoda and find no one. That would be a problem. This setup was to prevent that.

'If I had a Traversal Token, this wouldn't be so complicated... Still, it's good that I've obtained the information on the Life Divine Ability.'

In an instant, the scenery before him shifted. He had arrived in another realm, and an incredibly dense wave of Spiritual Qi washed over him. He sat down within a field of pristine light and took out the *Tread on Flames* manual.

'I've been practicing these Movement techniques for years... I've already gained some insights. With one more push, I'll have fully mastered *Tread on Flames*.'

'Let the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition deal with Tangdao Mountain. If Tinglan never calls for me, I can continue studying the *Radiant Celestial Wave Art* and the *Arranged-Mansions Celestial Yang Escape Art*. One more completed spell art means fewer injuries when the time comes!'
