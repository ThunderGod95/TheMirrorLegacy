# Chapter 425: News From The Yu Family

Li Qinghong, having waited for some time at the northern peak of the Yuan Family's Mushroom Forest Plain, was met by their descendant. Intimidated by Li Qinghong's formidable presence, the young representative barely dared to speak and instead stayed in one corner like a timid quail.

For Li Qinghong, delivering Spirit Stones to Yuan Huyuan was just an ordinary trip. However, the mirror that was in her chest pocket stirred slightly. Lu Jiangxian extended his divine sense outward, covering the entire northern expanse of the Mushroom Forest Plain.

He scanned the area with his divine sense, revealing various immortal peaks. Most were occupied by minor Embryonic Breathing Realm clans under the Yuan Family's control. Although the family's main peak was away from here, Lu Jiangxian still managed to detect over ten cultivation techniques.

"Secret notes... One set of alchemy and one set of forging... Cultivation techniques... seven Embryonic Breathing, five Qi Cultivation, and two Foundation Establishment realms..." he murmured.

The Mushroom Forest Plain, a region controlled by major clans for centuries, had a more detailed categorization of cultivation methods compared to Moongaze Lake.

While Moongaze Lake's methods were either for Embryonic Breathing or Foundation Establishment realms, Mushroom Forest Plain included a division between Qi Cultivation and Foundation Establishment realms. This division was believed to be a strategic measure employed by the Yuan Family to maintain control over the minor clans under their rule.

Lu Jiangxian set aside the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation techniques for future study and began to examine the two Foundation Establishment Realm techniques.

A Grade Three manual, Azure River Seeking Source Technique, and a Grade Four manual, Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique...

The Azure River Seeking Source Technique, which could form the Dao foundation Grieving River Departure, was the Dao Partner of Boundless Ocean. Practiced by both the Xiao and Yuan families, it was regarded as a decent and somewhat miraculous method of cultivation.

Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique was a Grade Four qi gathering method. Due to changes in the natural world, it had become obsolete. It appeared to be a remnant from a former immortal sect in the south that required the Long Marcing Pheasant Flame spiritual qi.

"The Yuan Family has quite a number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators on their territory. All of them practice various techniques and utilize the unique aspects of their immortal foundations to develop numerous cultivation sites..."

From the various immortal peaks and their treasures, Lu Jiangxian acknowledged that these established clans, with over a hundred years of history, possess considerable hidden treasures. In contrast, the Li Family, still on the rise, had much to catch up on.

As Lu Jiangxian scanned the immortal caves and fire veins on each immortal peak, he nodded in quiet approval. These established prestigious clans with over a century of history had indeed amassed considerable wealth and hidden treasures. In contrast, the Li Family, which had only recently risen to prominence, still had much to do.

Satisfied with his findings, Lu Jiangxian retracted his divine sense into the mirror. As Li Qinghong drew closer to the Li Residence, his view of Moongaze Lake slowly grew clearer.

"It seems the devil cultivators are assaulting all of Moongaze Lake..."

The shores of Moongaze Lake were shrouded in a blood-red light, which also extended to the territories governed by the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of Mount Yue and Daoist He. Despite the ominous glow, these cultivators made no response but continued their silent cultivation on the mountains.

"It appears that the devil plague is either linked to these Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators or they have been warned... The Azure Pond Sect must be planning something big with all these devil cultivators running amok in the region..."

————

Milin Prefecture was a fertile region with few mountains and forests, featuring only eight or nine small peaks. Five among them had the strongest earth veins that had the richest spiritual energy. The mountains were peppered with many cave dwellings, and most visitors were young cultivators in the early stages of the Embryonic Breathing or Qi Cultivation realms.

The usually bustling prefecture was now desolate. Mana light clashed with devil qi and blood qi in the sky, causing thunderous roars. Jade Smoke Mountain, the dharma artifact, flew here and there, causing loud cries of pain in its wake.

Although the Yu Family had inherited the Jiang Family's legacy, they lacked a competent cultivation technique. The Jiang Family's ancestral secret techniques had long been lost, leaving only a collection of undecipherable jade slips. The Yu Family must rely solely on their dharma artifacts to fend off enemies.

Yu Mugao, observing the dwindling number of his clansmen, assessed the situation. With only six devil cultivators left, he knew they would not be able to breach their family's grand formation.

"There's no need to waste any more time. Disengage and return to the formation!" he commanded.

Yu Mugao was now a late-stage Qi Cultivator and the strongest in his clan. Although he was not a particularly good fighter, having the Jade Smoke Mountain dharma artifact in his possession significantly enhanced his combat capabilities.

With loyal clan members and external cultivators he had personally trained, Yu Mugao faced the demon cultivators. They charged from all directions, exploiting the demons' weaknesses to defeat them one by one. Despite being at a disadvantage in terms of strength, they fought with fierce determination and resolve.

Having expended two Foundation Establishment Realm talismans, Yu Mugao observed that most of the devil cultivators had begun to retreat with severe injuries. With the majority of cities and counties in Milin Prefecture saved, he deemed it unwise to continue fighting and decided to withdraw, heading toward the mountain.

Just as he was about to land in the mountains, his path was blocked by the formation that had just been activated. His loyal clan members behind him began to panic as Yu Mugao froze in his spot.

The formation plate at home has my seal... Why can't I enter the formation?!

His heart pounded with dread. "Open the formation at once!" he demanded urgently.

Yu Mugao's children were among the cultivators guarding the mountain. His seventh and youngest son, Yu Chengyi, recognized his father's voice instantly. He jumped in surprise and was about to open the formation when he was halted. Several elders intervened, holding the formation plate.

"The Family Head's spiritual sense seal is on this plate... There's no reason why he can't open the formation! That must be a devil cultivator impostor!" they said.

Yu Chengyi had always been timid. He hesitated and was quickly overpowered by the authoritative words of his elders. Not only did he not open the formation, but he also did not dare snatch the formation plate from their hands.

Outside, Yu Mugao's voice grew more urgent as he demanded, "Chengyi, open the formation right now!"

The voice was isolated outside the formation. Although Yu Mugao could not see the elders inside the formation, he immediately understood the situation.

To think I'd actually perish at the hands of those juniors! he thought in anguish.

Meanwhile, inside the formation...

Smoke billowed outside and the air was filled with the haunting echoes of miserable screams. The Yu Family's cultivators inside the formation shivered as they watched the man standing at the edge of the formation.

One of them asked nervously, "Master Lu, what should we do...?"

The guest cultivator observed the bloodshed outside with a smirk and reassured them with a smile, "No need to worry... The devil cultivators can't breach the formation. Just wait it out. The situation will resolve itself."

The group huddled in the mountains and waited for several hours. Eventually, the black devil qi began to dissipate, and everything outside the formation soon became visible. One of the Yu Family members came forward and said, "Master Lu, please go out and assess the situation!"

Master Lu nodded. He rode the wind and flew out of the formation to search among the fallen bodies on the ground for a while. Eventually, a big smile appeared on his face. He drew his sword and severed the head of a corpse on the ground, laughing as he made a loud proclamation.

"Rejoice, elders! Yu Mugao is dead!"

He raised the severed head high above his head as if it were a trophy and declared, "The tyrannical lord is dead! The officials and nobles in the prefecture no longer need to live under his oppressive rule! Congratulations, elders!"

Yu Chengyi's face immediately paled as he slumped to the ground, finally realizing the severity of the situation. However, no one paid him any further attention. Amidst the mixed emotions of the crowd, someone called out, "Present the head quickly!"

Another voice shouted in excitement, "Where is the jade seal? Where is his Jade Smoke Mountain?"

Jade Smoke Mountain was a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact that had gained sentience. Only members of the Yu Family's direct lineage could wield it effectively; for anyone else, the jade seal would be as unyielding as a real mountain. Since these demon cultivators were only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, it was unlikely they could take it away.

Master Lu quickly returned with the severed head and handed it to that elder.

"The Jade Smoke Mountain is too heavy for me to lift. It is still at the foot of the mountain," he informed.

The elder examined the severed head closely. Yu Mugao, now over eighty years old, had graying hair and his cunning eyes were slightly open. His hair and beard was long, and his face was all bruised and bloodied from the devil cultivator's attacks.

Those eyes locked onto the elder's greedy and gleeful gaze, causing the elder to gasp and throw Yu Mugao's head away, his face paling in shock.

Another member of the group picked up the head, still unable to believe that Yu Mugao was truly dead. The elders exchanged uneasy glances, and one of them spoke with a tremble in his voice, "Although this man was cruel and unkind, he wasn't much of a fighter... It was no surprise he got killed..."

"Yes, but... Yu Muxian is still in the sect. I-If... If he finds out that we have secretly erased the seal from the formation plate... Master Lu! What should we do now?!"

It turned out that several of the elders were brothers of Yu Xiaogui. During his lifetime, Yu Xiaogui had feared that his eldest son, Yu Mugao, might slaughter the clan after his death, so he used various means to secretly protect them.

Yu Mugao had been aware of this but was concerned that any rash actions might expose news of Yu Xiaogui's death. He had planned to frame and eliminate them one by one.

However, these elders were shrewd and had been feigning ignorance.

Yu Mugao did not anticipate encountering devil cultivators, and everyone was rescued by guest cultivator Lu. His descendants, being too weak to make decisive moves, ended up getting him killed.

Master Lu shook his head and replied, "Yu Mugao died due to the devil plague... Yu Muxian won't investigate with a Clarity Talisman. As long as we hold our ground, we can manage this situation!"

The elder nodded silently, whispering, "We'll put our trust in you, Master Lu!"

The guest cultivator nodded with a smile.

The old man turned around and addressed the terrified crowd.

"With Yu Mugao dead, all his rules are nullified. We'll abolish his public fields, inspections, collective punishments, and commercial taxes... We'll restore the clan's tribute system, the clan slaves... All laws enacted by Yu Mugao will be revoked in favor of the ancient clan system!"

Instantly, the Yu Family members erupted in joy and cheers. Yu Mugao's head, now fallen on the ground, lay in the rain, his beard and hair drenched and matted.

The chorus of voices chanted, "Remove the tyrants and restore the clan system!"

The face that had been drained white due to devil cultivation qi turning dull, now lying alone under the rain, eerily resembled An Jingming's head that had been preserved with a spell for decades in the Yu Family's vault.

————

Li Yuanping sat at the high seat, now nearing thirty with gray sideburns that he no longer bothered to dye. People on Mount Dali usually got gray hair at thirty and passed away at fifty. Therefore, Li Yuanping could now be referred to as an Old Master.

The storage pouches left behind by the two devil cultivators were no ordinary items. Li Yuanping had them exchanged for three pouches suitable for the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, and with the remaining twenty-plus Spirit Stones added to the family's vault, his mood had lightened considerably.

The newly acquired storage pouches were given to the brothers from the An Family and the orphan from the Tian Family, as a gesture to win over their favor.

He was currently preparing for the upcoming tribute submission. He had learned that Eldest Senior Brother Yu Su from Yuanwu Peak, notorious for his greed and audacity, would be collecting the tributes this time. As such, it was essential to prepare a bribe.

While he listed down all the items that needed to be prepared, someone entered the hall and presented a letter.

"Family Head! A report from our Yu Family's spy!"

Li Yuanping skimmed through the letter. His eyes widened in disbelief as he read it again, more carefully this time.

He then exclaimed, "Yu Mugao is dead?! Is this true? What kind of scheme is that person plotting now?"

He pondered for a moment, realizing that the current situation of the three families made it unlikely that the Yu Family would fake a death—it would only cause unnecessary turmoil.

The three families had an agreement before. The Li Family moving north at this time would only provoke trouble.

On the other hand, the Yu Family, with its vast territory, had been plagued by even more devil cultivators. Yu Mugao's death seemed plausible under the circumstances.

"Send someone to investigate further," he instructed.

Still feeling uneasy, Li Yuanping sent another person to confirm the news. After a moment, he put down his brush, a muffled laugh escaping his lips. He turned to those around him, joyfully announcing, "With one less starving wolf at my side, I can finally sleep in peace!"

As he held the small letter, Li Yuanjiao descended into the front yard. He had been accumulating progress all this while and spent only several days breaking through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Yuanping rose from his seat and greeted him with a smile.

"Big Brother, take a look at this!" he exclaimed gleefully.

Li Yuanjiao nodded and read the letter carefully. He exhaled deeply, both relieved and satisfied.
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

"I guess he was fortunate to die an easy death," he commented.

Li Yuanjiao and his siblings still harbored resentment toward the Yu Family due to Li Yuanxiu's death. They had always wished so badly to end that cunning pair of father and son from the Yu Family. Yu Xiaogui had been slain by Li Tongya, who passed away shortly after that. Now that Yu Mugao had been killed in the devil plague, they could finally have peace of mind.

Li Yuanping raised his head and murmured, "Considering all the enemies of my family, even though Yu Mugao might not compare to the likes of Jianixi, he was still a formidable figure... Now that he is dead, his lifelong good governance and clan system has been in vain. The Yu Family can no longer compete with my family for supremacy... This is a blessing for my Li Family!"

Li Yuanjiao chuckled in response.

"The Yu Family spent a century usurping Jiang's territory, I still remember when they hosted a banquet and invited all the families to impose tributes on them. It has only been eighty years since then, and now their influence has crumbled. Even the last beam of their roof has been broken."

"Don't forget about Yu Mujian... We still haven't heard any news about him, so it's unclear whether he's alive or dead," Li Yuanping reminded him.

As the two brothers enjoyed their conversation, Dou Yi approached and reported, "Family Head! With Yu Mugao dead, their elder, Yu Xiaomian, is supporting Yu Chengyi, the seventh heir, as their new leader. Meanwhile, the other peaks, controlled by Yu Mugao's other descendants, have split into four factions. The situation is currently at a standstill."

Li Yuanping considered this information thoughtfully but could only say, "It's a pity that Yu Muxian's oath prevents us from intervening in the Yu Family's affairs or entering their territory... Otherwise, we could take advantage of this situation to expand north and annex half of the Yu Family's land."

"We might not be able to annex it directly, but we could certainly do something about it..." Li Yuanjiao suggested.

Li Yuanping then took the letter presented by Dou Yi and said, "All four regions around the lake have been struck by the devil plague, and the Fei Family has activated their Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation. Without any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators among the devil cultivators, they were unable to breach it and quickly withdrew."

As the two brothers were deep in discussion, a commotion erupted in the front hall. Two young Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators hurried in with tears staining their cheeks. They rushed forward and fell to their knees as they cried out, "Please... save our families!"

These cultivators were from the Rui and Pu families on the eastern shore, both of which paid tribute to the Li Family. They had come to the Li Family to cultivate spirit fields and were now pleading desperately.

"Family Head, the families on the eastern shore are in utter chaos! Many devil cultivators of the Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realms are running amok there... We've exhausted all our means of seeking help. Please, we beg the main family to save our families...!"

Li Yuanping and Li Yuanjiao exchanged a glance, their faces lighting up with sudden delight. Their eyes were drawn to the densely packed families on the map.

"Families on the eastern shore!"

These Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realm devil cultivators are easy prey... We could use this opportunity to gather several Embryonic Breathing Realm families and increase the tribute we receive. It's a perfect chance to kill two birds with one stone!




# Chapter 427: Advancing To The Eastern Shore

Written on the twenty-eighth day in the twelfth lunar month: It's snowing heavily at the lake. Enclosed with this letter are a hundred and twenty-two Spirit Stones. Everything is well at home. Your Great Granduncle Tian has fallen, slain by a devil cultivator.

In light of this, you are required to dress in mourning garb and abstain from alcohol for three months. Study hard in the sect. Focus intently on mastering immortal recipes, engaging in profound discussions, and perfecting the art of cinnabar creation. Should you find yourself in need of additional resources, do not hesitate to write home.

From Father Jiao.

Li Xizhi looked at the small pile of Spirit Stones stacked on the desk before him. He remained silent, reading the letter in his hands over and over again. After poring over it more than ten times, he held the paper tightly, lost in his thoughts.

Li Yuanjiao was never good with words—even his writing was stiff and concise, devoid of emotion. It was almost as if he was unwilling to spare an extra word for his son. Li Xizhi pursed his lips tightly as he read the letter repeatedly, blinking back his tears.

If the delivery of this letter had not been delayed by the Yuan Family, his family actually took less than a month to collect a hundred and twenty Spirit Stones. Li Xizhi dared not wonder how they managed to even achieve this feat. He carefully hid the letter in his pocket and then stepped out of the courtyard to find Yuan Tuan.

"Master, Xizhi is ready to buy the Dawn Colored Qi," he informed.

"How much more do you need?" Yuan Tuan asked softly, cradling a tabby cat in her arms.

"I have all one hundred and twenty Spirit Stones," he replied.

Upon hearing this, Yuan Tuan raised an eyebrow and remarked, "Li Yuanjiao is really a problem solver... I didn't expect him to be able to scrape together all one hundred and twenty Spirit Stones! Your family has only risen to prominence not long ago... This must have been quite a challenge for them."

Her calm voice took on a somewhat mournful tone as she murmured, "If only my family had remained as united and harmonious sixty years ago... Perhaps I wouldn’t feel so aggrieved."

Taking the Spirit Stones from Li Xizhi, Yuan Tuan rode the wind away without further delay. An hour later, she returned to the peak with a frosty demeanor, holding a small jade vial in her hand.

"Here's the Dawn-Colored Qi. I spent a long time searching in Xieqi Peak's vault; this bottle is the purest, extracted over eighteen years ago through the proper qi gathering method. You can tell by its red and gold hues."

Her aura undulated and she had a faint green light flowing around her, probably from a recent conflict with another cultivator on Xieqi Peak. Her expression remained frosty as she continued, "The people on Xieqi Peak are becoming more presumptuous! I have already tolerated their steep demand of a hundred and twenty Spirit Stones, yet they dared to try and deceive me... They mistake my kindness within the sect for weakness, thinking I can be easily bullied!"

Li Xizhi noted her distinctly icy demeanor, and with a respectful bow, he first expressed his gratitude before responding.

"Xieqi Peak is among the direct lineages... it was only natural for them to make things hard for us. To think that they dare to treat Master this way when you hail from a prestigious clan from the Mushroom Forest Plain! If I were to handle this alone, I doubt I'd even make it up the Xieqi Peak."

Yuan Tuan nodded thoughtfully, then, as if struck by a sudden thought, she smiled gently and asked, "Xizhi, you're seventeen this year, aren’t you? Yet, you haven't found yourself a wife and started your family... It's unwise to delay such matters for too long. Have you taken a liking to any girl from the peaks? If so, I'll approach her on your behalf."

The abrupt change in topic took Li Xizhi by surprise, momentarily freezing him to the spot. Before he could articulate his objections however, realization dawned upon him.

I am my father’s only son, and Azure Pond is a perilous place. Should anything befall me, would it not leave my father without an heir? It seems selfish of me to reject this suggestion...

With this thought in mind, he could only reply somewhat glumly, "I'll leave it to you, Master."

Yuan Tuan nodded as if she had already anticipated this response, then said warmly, "Matching you with a member of the Qi Cultivation Realm family could indeed be tricky, especially given your family’s recent mourning. Engaging with an unknown clan brings uncertainty about their intentions... Perhaps I should approach the Yang Family at Imperial Cloud Peak on your behalf."

This suggestion was unexpected, as Li Xizhi was expecting her to suggest someone from the Yuan Family. Nevertheless, he bowed his head in silent agreement.

Yuan Tuan continued, "In the past, the King of Yue formed marriage ties with many clans, and although the old system has dissolved, transforming Azure Pond into its current form, political marriages still occur occasionally, following old precedents."

"Thank you for your consideration, Master," Li Xizhi said respectfully while Yuan Tuan chuckled.

"Back in the day, Yang Tianya used that jade seal to muster his forces through Lixia Road and quell uprisings on my Mushroom Forest Plain. The Yuan Family has maintained ties with the Yang Family since then, so arranging this should be easy."[1]

————

The families on the eastern shore were diverse, comprising dozens of small families. Some were bound to the sect through deep-seated alliances or marital bonds, while others were vassals of the Xiao Family in their ore mining ventures.

These families regularly paid tributes to the neighboring clans. However, the situation shifted when the marketplace on Cloud Crowned Peak was destroyed, leading to a decline in the Xiao Family’s influence in the west. Following the downfall of the Yu Family, these eastern shore families finally found themselves able to lead somewhat easier lives.

However, the arrival of the devil plague shattered their newfound tranquility abruptly, thrusting all the families on the eastern shore back into a nightmarish reality. Clouds of malevolent qi billowed across the land as blood flowed freely in the streets, as well as being accompanied by cries and howls of despair.

In the Rui Residence...

Li Qinghong's jade armor glinted and glowed warmly. Her spear discharged dazzling purple electricity, striking down a fleeing devil cultivator at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Her weapon moved like a dragon, piercing through her foe effortlessly.

The purple lightning obliterated the devil cultivator swiftly, and with a smooth movement of her spear, Li Qinghong plucked a storage pouch from the gory remnants.

With a graceful flick, the pouch fell into her waiting hand. Turning, Li Qinghong saw her elder brother, Li Yuanjiao, grinning widely.

However, Li Xuanxuan stared at the corpse with a pained look on his face as he lamented, "That devil cultivator wore robes made of Purple Cloud Brocade... Qinghong's electricity has ruined it completely and we can't use it anymore..."

Li Qinghong lowered her weapon and suppressed a giggle as she said, "All right, all right... It's my fault."

Li Yuanjiao waved off Rui Qiongcuo, the head of the Rui Family, who was bursting with gratitude and urged his group onward.

The external cultivators were not only weak but also required Li Yuanjiao to share any spoils with them and provide compensation for casualties. Hence, Li Yuanjiao chose to bring only his own family members into battle—himself, at the eighth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm; Li Qinghong and Li Xuanxuan, both at the seventh heavenly layer; and the old monkey wielding a jade mortar and pestle, at the fifth heavenly layer. Together, they swept through the region, clearing it of the devil cultivators.

The devil cultivators they faced were not particularly strong, yet Li Yuanjiao remained cautious and maintained tight control over his group to prevent ambushes, opting for thoroughness over efficiency.

However, as they ventured deeper, they encountered increasingly formidable devil cultivators. Among these foes were local cultivators who had turned, now practicing the Blood Dharma Manual. While these enemies were not overwhelmingly strong, their expertise in evasion proved troublesome, significantly slowing the Li Family's progress through the area.

1. Yang Tianya was mentioned briefly in Chapter 44. Nothing much is known about him, except that he was a cultivator in the Foundation Establishment Realm who led a brutal campaign to the east against Mount Yue. ☜

Clutching eight or nine storage pouches in his chest pocket, Li Yuanjiao murmured, "We’ve slain many Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators so far... If we continue at this rate, I fear the more powerful devil cultivators will have escaped."

He discreetly consulted his mirror, scanning the blood-soaked landscape with its help, and immediately glimpsed blood and fires in his vision.
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝚠𝚎𝚋𝗻𝗼𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝚘𝐦

"To the southeast! Let’s catch the big fish first!" he commanded decisively in a grim tone.

As they flew onward, accompanied by the monkey, they soon spotted three Qi Cultivators hovering in the sky. They were manipulating a spell that glowed crimson. On the ground, they saw a large formation drawn with blood, linking it to those three Qi Cultivators above.

Li Xuanxuan glanced behind him—the distant smoke from the towns along Guli Road was still visible, so they would not miss any signal for help from their family.

Li Yuanjiao murmured, "Two at the middle stage of Qi Cultivation Realm and one at the late stage..."

Devil cultivators varied greatly; those who wielded white qi were notably more formidable. Observing that these three were merely shrouded in a faint blood light, Li Yuanjiao nodded firmly to his group.

Li Qinghong caught on immediately, her fine eyebrows arching as she clasped her hands together and conjured a dense purple glow between her palms—the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique.

The devil cultivators, engrossed in completing their formation, were caught off guard by the direct assault. Scrambling, they raised their dharma artifacts in clumsy defense. With a wave of her slender hand, Li Qinghong sent a lightning-charged talisman hurtling right toward them.

If only we were closer, the ambush would have been more devastating!

Due to their heightened spiritual senses, the Qi Cultivators rarely fell prey to sneak attacks unless their enemies employed a unique dharma artifact that could conceal their presence. Li Qinghong closed the gap swiftly, further reducing the time for her enemies to react. She smashed a thunder talisman into the face of the weakest cultivator.

Boom!

The impact sent the mid-stage Qi Cultivator flying backward and spitting a mouthful of blood, his dharma artifact scorched. Seizing the momentum, Li Qinghong followed up with a spear attack. The other members of the Li Family swiftly engaged and tackled the remaining two enemies.

The attack took a very noticeable toll on the devil cultivator. Fortunately, his rich experience in combat allowed him to diffuse most of the talisman's power with his dharma artifact, avoiding serious injury. His gaze turned vicious as he cursed at Li Qinghong.

"Such resilience!" Li Yuanjiao exclaimed, slashing his longsword across his opponent's chest, leaving a bloodied scar. Yet, he noticed that the three Qi devil cultivators seemed unnervingly composed, and were even smirking confidently.

A bad feeling rose in Li Yuanjiao's heart as he urged the others, "Let's finish this quickly!"

Mana surged within him as he twirled his gleaming sword, engaging another mid-stage Qi Cultivator in battle. Leveraging his powerful River One Qi Technique, he attempted to tackle two enemies simultaneously.

Li Xuanxuan, catching onto his intentions, coordinated with the old monkey and Li Qinghong to converge on the wounded devil cultivator.

The late-stage Qi devil cultivator in black robes sneered, rebuking sharply, "How bold... Are you seriously treating us like mere rogue cultivators from some lowly families?"

The dharma artifact in his hand came whistling through the air while the other hand performed a spell that cast a chilling blood light. As he aimed to strike Li Yuanjiao, the gray-robed devil cultivator at the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm seized the opportunity and closed in to attack Li Yuanjiao as well.

Li Yuanjiao swiftly clapped his storage pouch, conjuring a large, earth-colored oval shield. The six overlapping barriers glowed with mana light, blocking the incoming attacks and unleashing a burst of white light against the crimson light.

As the Six-Stone Cloud Plate, a mid-grade dharma artifact, flared to life, the mana within Li Yuanjiao surged like a tidal wave, defending him against the assault from his attackers.

"Ah, so you have a dharma artifact to rely on!"

The mid-stage Qi devil cultivator sneered, performing hand seals with his hands before breathing golden flames that slammed ruthlessly against the Six-Stone Cloud Plate.

With his mana reserve quickly depleting, Li Yuanjiao was forced to retract his dharma artifact. He drew back and unsheathed his sword, leaping into the air and executing a Celestial Moon Slash, forcing the two attackers back momentarily. A fleeting touch of red light from earlier left the tip of his nose chilly.

The devil cultivator was in a worse state. His body was engulfed in black smoke with wounds marring his body, and panic took over as he shouted, "Our reinforcements are coming! You should run while you still can!"

The other two cultivators merely threw a few vicious glares at him but said nothing. Devil cultivators were selfish. Both of them were only thinking about stalling the Li Family without any concern for their ally's fate.

Cornered by Li Qinghong, who had thwarted all his attempts to escape, the wounded devil cultivator could not think of anything else other than trying to convince his enemies to leave.

"It is my possessions that you all covet, right?! Killing me serves no purpose! You guys won't survive once our reinforcements are here! Spare my life, and I assure you, you will receive what you desire!" he yelled out in desperation.

He swiftly grabbed the storage pouch at his waist while enduring the barrage of assaults from his attackers. As blood spilled from his lips, he mustered the strength for one last spell. The storage bag shot away like a meteor as he descended to the ground.

Having borne the brunt of multiple spells, a trail of blood leaked out from the corner of Li Yuanjiao's mouth.

"Let's go."

Li Qinghong snagged the pouch with her electricity, then deactivated the spell that drained her mana. Her face paled, but she managed to still summon a wisp of purple lightning to employ her secret technique.

"Trying to escape?" the late-stage Qi devil cultivator in black growled, swinging his dharma artifact fiercely at Li Yuanjiao's retreating figure.

"Fool! Don't chase him!" the wounded devil cultivator, who relinquished his storage pouch, cried out as his comrade surged forward. The black-robed cultivator was momentarily taken aback.

Li Yuanjiao sheathed his sword and extended his spiritual sense into the mirror. The devil cultivator, feeling a sudden chill down his spine, found his hairs standing on end. In a desperate bid to escape, he performed a secret technique, causing his form to blur like flowing blood. With a violent push of energy, he managed to swiftly retreat several feet away.

Refraining from using the Supreme Yin Profound Light publicly, Li Yuanjiao simply intimidated the devil cultivator before seizing the opening to fly away in another direction. The anger in the devil cultivator’s eyes had completely dissipated, now replaced by a deep-seated terror.

As the gray-robed mid-stage qi devil cultivator tried to give chase, Li Qinghong’s thunder talisman struck him hard. The devil cultivator was forced to deploy his dharma artifact in defense, barely managing to shield himself as he watched his targets disappear into the smoke and dust.

Employing his secret technique to flee had severely depleted the mana reserves of the late-stage qi devil cultivator, leaving him visibly pale. He hovered in midair, momentarily dazed. From below, the devil cultivator who had lost his storage pouch rose into the air with a chilling laugh.

"The two of you should be grateful that I saved your lives just now!"

The mid-stage qi devil cultivator in gray shot him a cold look. The leader of their group, who was dressed in black, looked relieved.

"Fellow Daoist, given your experience in the sect, you must be quite knowledgeable. What insights can you offer?" he asked humbly.

Despite losing his storage pouch, the other cultivator replied with a grateful tone, "I've reviewed our sect’s catalog before. That man in black wields the Qingche Sword, there's no doubt about it! That's the weapon of a Sword Immortal... Imagine the power of the sword qi hidden within it!"

"None of us, not even our lord, could withstand that sword qi without spending seven to eight years to recover from the injury. The sword's intent is no laughing matter," he added solemnly.

The black-robed cultivator sighed deeply, his previous fear now explained. The gray-robed cultivator, though secretly relieved, remained outwardly stubborn.

"You may have a profound origin, but it changes nothing. You're just another wanderer like us now. If you want to brag about your achievements, you should have stayed in the sect and strove to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm instead of turning to devil cultivation!" he snarled coldly.

The black-robed cultivator waved his sleeves and quickly intervened.

"That's enough... Let's wait for our lord to come and collect all the blood qi from Moongaze Lake. We'll leave quickly after that and head to the Golden Feather Sect."

Moongaze Lake was shrouded in mystery. Aside from the sword immortal clan, there was also talk of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator concealed on the opposite shore. There were also rumors about another Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator surnamed Jiang hidden among the families in this region.

"What a dreadful place!"




# Chapter 429: Slaughter Jun Kui Light

The members of the Li Family swiftly departed on the wind. Li Yuanjiao's face was slightly pale, but after consuming a Cold Dispelling Antidote and a pill to replenish his true essence, his complexion improved significantly. Beside him, Li Qinghong, who had also exerted considerable energy, took the same pill and regulated her breathing.

Despite his slight injuries, Li Yuanjiao maintained a smile on his face. The storage pouch in his hand glowed with runes, suggesting that it was no ordinary item.

He chuckled and said, "That devil cultivator seems different from the other minor devil cultivators we usually encounter... He's likely one of the core figures like Zhang Huaide and Qiu Ji. I expect we'll find something of value in this pouch."

However, Li Yuanjiao did not open the storage pouch but instead played with it in his hand.

Li Xuanxuan looked at him in concern and asked, "Jiao'er, how are your injuries?"

"It's nothing serious. I'll get Guiluan to help me recover for a couple of days, and then I'll spend the next few months stabilizing my cultivation. After that, I should be able to break through to the ninth heavenly layer," he replied, hinting that he would be using a talisman pill.

Since the old monkey flying behind them, Li Yuanjiao did not want to talk about the talisman pill openly. The four of them flew on for a while until Li Yuanjiao suddenly halted and whispered, "Found it!"

Below them, a minor Embryonic Breathing Realm family was being ruthlessly attacked by a devil cultivator. Li Yuanjiao descended, drawing his sword to strike.

Soon, he returned with a captured Embryonic Breathing Realm devil cultivator, whose limbs had been cleanly severed. The devil cultivator's eyes widened in fear as he pleaded for mercy.

Li Yuanjiao stared at him emotionlessly, then threw the limbless devil cultivator onto the ground before tossing the devil qi cultivator's storage pouch on him.

"Open it with your spiritual sense," he ordered.

The Embryonic Breathing Realm devil cultivator complied instantly, and the pouch's contents spilled out. There were no visible traps or seals.

Li Yuanjiao, not interested in finding out whether the devil cultivator had been marked for revenge, ignored his pleas for mercy. With a swift motion, he crushed the devil cultivator's skull under his foot and incinerated the remains with a fire spell, then picked up the storage pouch and its contents.

All of this happened in a matter of breaths. Meanwhile, Li Qinghong, who was meditating with her spear in hand, remained detached and seemingly unaffected by the scene. Li Xuanxuan, however, frowned and interjected, "A single slash would have sufficed... There was no need to sever his limbs and make such a bloody mess."

"It's better this way. At least, there's no need to worry about him using any talismans," Li Yuanjiao replied with a laugh.

With that, they soared into the air. Li Yuanjiao examined the contents of the storage pouch as they flew and in no time, they had arrived at the border of the Yu Family's territory.

Yu Family's Milin Prefecture was engulfed in smoke and fire. Spells and streams of mana light clashed in the air, leaving marks of battle and ruin on the ground.

Li Xuanxuan paused to observe for a moment and then remarked softly, "There are only four generations from Yu Yufeng to Yu Chengyi. To think that the situation of their family has deteriorated so much that recovery seems impossible..."

Li Qinghong, who was holding her spear and watching the bright flames engulf the prefecture, commented, "When clans are founded, their ancestors are either exceptionally gifted and cunning, generous and resourceful, or cautious and ruthless. The first generation built their foundations, and the second maintained them but were less successful than their predecessors... The descendants indulge in comfort and focus solely on cultivation, detached from the hardships of the world. They attain the Foundation Establishment Realm and suppress the other clans, or they risk planting the seeds of future troubles if they don't."

Li Yuanjiao rested his hand on the sword at his waist and murmured, "From our family's high ancestor, Li Mutian, we have seen four generations... The current generation of Xi and Yue is the fifth."

He turned and asked suddenly, "Is there any descendant comparable to the high ancestor?"

Li Qinghong, caught off guard by his serious tone, quickly laughed and said, "Each generation faces its own circumstances. There's no need to compare, Big Brother."

Li Xuanxuan listened silently to the discussion between Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong without saying a word. Upon returning to Lijing Town, he ascended the peak to draw talismans, while Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong landed in the central hall to divide the spoils with Li Yuanping.

There were ten spirit pouches of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. After filling the vault with dharma artifacts and spirit items, the remaining forty Spirit Stones were added to the clan account. This replenished the gap left by the Spirit Stones for Li Qingxiao's lineage from Mount Yu.

When they poured out the savings from the Qi devil cultivator, there were twenty Spirit Stones, not accounting for the rest. Li Yuanjiao handed them over to Yuanping, only to see him frown and say, "You should keep some for yourselves too, Big Brother and Big Sister. If you give everything to the clan, you two won't have anything left for your own cultivation. Big Brother is on the verge of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm... You should think more about yourself."

The siblings exchanged glances with each other briefly, then decided to split the Spirit Stones among themselves. They also took a few bottles of useful pills for themselves. Li Yuanjiao sifted through the remaining devil techniques for a while before his eyes finally lit up.

"There's a Grade Four technique!" he exclaimed in delight.

Most of the widely circulated manuals in the Wu and Yue States were of Grade One and Two. Grade Three and Grade Four techniques and spells were generally kept secret by clans, while those beyond that grade were monopolized by the immortal sects.

Upon hearing this, everyone gathered around him eagerly. Li Yuanjiao read the manual carefully before remarking, "How rare! This is a Grade Four spell from the Slaughter Jun Gate, a minor sect in the Wu State! It's known as the Slaughter Jun Kui Light, requiring different types of cold qi or cold water in its practice. To learn this spell, nine different cold qi or three types of cold water are needed. To master it, one would need nine different cold qi and nine types of cold water to make eighty-one variations!"

"Typically, these cold qi and water are to be absorbed into the left index finger... On the battlefield, a hand seal can be performed to unleash the Slaughter Jun Kui Light. This can obstruct an enemy's mana circulation. Once mastered, it could freeze even Qi Cultivators," he continued explaining.

Once Li Yuanjiao finished his explanation, Li Qinghong took the manual and examined it. With a regretful sigh, she said, "I can't use this. Thunder is associated with fire, and this spell relies on the cold. It's unsuitable for me, especially since the cold must be absorbed into the index finger..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded. His family practiced the River One Qi Technique and Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual, both of which were compatible with this spell. The Cold Pine Snow Qi, gathered by the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual, could even be used to cultivate this spell.

The Earth Fiend's Cold Spring spirit water at home could also be used.

"Slaughter Jun Gate..." Li Yuanjiao repeated the name, feeling a sense of familiarity with it.

"I think that old monkey used to train in this sect... The White Monkey's Travel Notes described the cultivation techniques of this sect as gloomy and cold. The ancestors of the sect were wealthy and possessed several secret techniques. This gate was later destroyed by the devil cultivators, which is why this manual has ended up in our hands."

The spell required numerous types of cold qi and cold water, with nine varieties needed just to begin. Given the difficulty of starting the cultivation itself, Li Yuanjiao decided to set it aside for now. He planned to gather cold qi from other families before attempting to cultivate it.

Li Yuanjiao spent half a year in seclusion to stabilize his cultivation. With the aid of a talisman pill, he successfully broke through to the ninth layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and could finally see the hope of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Now that he had emerged from seclusion, he inquired about the situation at home and found that most of the clan's cultivators had also retreated into seclusion.

The situation with the devil plague clan had eased, and many overdue clan wages were settled. Some had made progress in their cultivation, while others had saved enough to purchase pills to aid in their breakthroughs.

Li Qinghong had improved significantly after a period of combating the devil plague. However, she was still accumulating her cultivation in the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and had yet to break through to the eighth heavenly layer.

As soon as Li Yuanjiao left his seclusion, he received a letter from Smoke Valley Temple. Chen Donghe had finally managed to gather a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin spiritual qi, which brought Li Yuanjiao great joy. He requested Li Qinghong to oversee the family and set off westward personally.

However, upon crossing Mount Xiping and arriving at Smoke Valley Temple, Li Yuanjiao's joy quickly turned to dismay.

The ancient city wall, which had once stretched for thousands of li, had collapsed in several places, leaving it fractured into three or four sections. The remaining portions of the wall were now mottled and cracked.

Chen Donghe flew toward him and greeted him. His face was still pale and he seemed to have gained fresh wounds before his old wounds had even fully recovered.

Li Yuanjiao pointed at the damaged wall and frowned in silence. Chen Donghe quickly explained, "It was the work of those devil cultivators. Many frequently crossed the border this year. While most were just passing by, some grew greedy and besieged Smoke Valley Temple... During the battles, the ancient city wall was repeatedly impacted, leading to its current state."

Chen Donghe sighed and continued with a tinge of sadness evident in his voice, "This was also why the progress of gathering the Golden Yang Radiant Origin spirit qi had been delayed by half a year. The wall, which used to be able to support three people for qi harvesting, can now accommodate only two."

Li Yuanjiao felt a headache coming. Repairing the wall would not resolve the issue; the Golden Yang Radiant Origin required the presence of an ancient pass. Further repairs might just jeopardize this qi gathering location.

Should I send people to protect this place?

Li Yuanjiao was aware that there were only very few people in the main family who could fight. Sending more people to protect this place would only further delay their cultivation and expose them to danger.

"This place is too dilapidated; the qi gathering efficiency is very low. We may need to send someone to search for another suitable site," Li Yuanjiao concluded, taking the jade box from Chen Donghe.

He opened it gently, revealing the flowing red and golden light within, and nodded in pleased approval. He then asked, "Does Auntie know about Granduncle's situation? He's her uncle. Perhaps both of you should take a trip back to the clan to pay your respects."

Chen Donghe understood Li Yuanjiao's intention. Taking a trip back to the clan implied that they still had to return here and continue gathering the Golden Yang Radiant Origin spirit qi.

Despite this, Chen Donghe replied, "I'll have to trouble you to escort her back to the clan to pay her respects. It's becoming increasingly difficult to gather qi here... I'd better seize the opportunity to gather more, so I won't be returning with her."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement, then sent someone to fetch Li Jingtian. Shortly afterward, the messenger returned to him and informed him that Li Jingtian refused to return home. She would, however, offer distant respects and put on a mourning garb as a gesture of courtesy.

Chen Donghe sighed softly, then bowed slightly to Li Yuanjiao in apology.

Li Yuanjiao understood the gesture and left behind several medicine pills and resources before riding the wind and departing into the smoky sunset, vanishing into the yellow haze alone.

As Li Yuanjiao disappeared from view, Chen Donghe straightened up. He took a seat and leaned against the city wall, staring at the slowly setting sun. He suddenly felt a pang of loneliness.

At sixty years old, with Tian Youdao gone, he had one person less to reminisce about the past with.

"The sunset is blood red, the earth veins are stirring... It seems the fire veins have erupted again," he mumbled quietly to himself.

There were many fire veins in this desert, making it an inhospitable place for mortals. Li Jingtian's health had been declining and she had grown stubborn. When she was younger, she never left Li Yuanjiao in such a difficult position.

Xiao'er... I wonder how she's doing these days...

Chen Donghe, who practiced the River One Qi Technique, should ideally remain near water or the lake. Due to years in the desert, his cultivation had stagnated. He did not seem to mind though. Sitting silently on the gray-white city wall, he hummed a few lines of songs from his hometown.

Li Yuanjiao returned home in a gloomy state and sat on a rock for two hours, gradually regaining his composure. Just as his mood began to lift, he received word that Li Xijun had arrived.

"Have him come up," Li Yuanjiao instructed.

After a brief wait, Li Xijun appeared in a brocade robe. The dharma artifact, Glazed Dusk, had been carefully embedded into a jade ring that hung from his waist, swaying with his every movement like a beautiful pendant.

"Greetings, Second Uncle," Li Xijun greeted, cupping his fists in a respectful yet relaxed manner.
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝘦𝓌𝑒𝑏𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝘭.𝒸𝘰𝑚

Li Yuanjiao assessed him with his spiritual sense and noted, "I see you've condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and reached the Fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... Jade Capital Wheel. You've certainly worked hard."

At sixteen years old, Li Xijun was at the height of his potential. His talent, while impressive, was slightly inferior to that of Li Ximing, who was also nearing the Jade Capital stage at the Xiao residence.

Li Xijun responded humbly to his second uncle's praise. Li Yuanjiao, knowing he had come to request a talisman pill, retrieved a jade bottle from his storage pouch and handed it over.

Li Xijun and Li Ximing would reach the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm after taking this talisman pill. However, there was only a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi available.

After carefully choosing his words, Li Yuanjiao said warmly, "Jun'er, we only have a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi at home. Given the issues with the qi source in the desert, it may be over ten years before we can acquire another portion..."

Li Xijun nodded, mildly surprised to find himself in a similar situation that his elder brother, Li Xicheng, had previously faced. However, his personality was completely different from Li Xicheng. He merely responded respectfully, saying, "Xijun will obey the elder's commands!"

He did not give Li Yuanjiao an easy way out, so Li Yuanjiao fell silent. Li Xijun lowered his gaze and waited for two breaths until he could no longer bear watching the guilt on his elder's face.

He smiled and continued, "Xijun is rather fond of the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique. It's cold and ethereal, suitable for swordsmanship. That Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual sounds like an overblown show of wealth and lacks appeal."

Li Xijun's attempt at joking did little to lift Li Yuanjiao's spirits. The Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual was only a Grade Three cultivation technique, while the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual was a rare Grade Four ancient technique. Consuming the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi would determine one's path for the next century.

This was a serious matter that impacted the lives of all the precious descendants of the Li Family, not a joke that one could simply laugh and forget about. Li Yuanjiao was overwhelmed by emotions and frustrations, yet found himself unable to articulate them. In the end, all he could do was sigh.

"Once you stabilize your cultivation after the breakthrough, you can retrieve the Cold Pine Snow Qi from the foot of the mountain and prepare for the next step," he said.

He then retrieved the Slaughter Jun Kui Light manual and handed it over to Li Xijun apologetically. In an unusually gentle tone, he said, "This is the latest Grade Four spell our family has acquired... Study it carefully first before you begin practicing it slowly. Return to me when you're able to absorb cold qi and cold water."

Unlike the Cold Pine Snow Qi, the bottle of Earth Fiend's Cold Spring at home was a limited resource. Initially, Li Yuanjiao was hesitant to use this spell. However, after carefully reviewing the manual and discovering that only a small amount of spirit water was required, he decided to provide it.

"Thank you, Second Uncle!"

Li Xijun nodded calmly, then accepted the manual and carefully read its contents. After swearing the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, he cupped his fist and took his leave.

After he departed, a thought struck Li Yuanjiao. He wrote a letter, which he handed to a subordinate and instructed, "Go to Xianyou Peak and find out Ximing's cultivation progress. See if he has broken through to the Jade Capital stage then return quickly."

"Wait."

He retracted the letter and added something to it, then said, "Have him request to come home; I'll fetch him myself."




# Chapter 431: Stripped of Clothes and Crown

A stream of light emerged from Xianyou Peak and streaked across the sky. After bidding farewell to the Xiao Family, Li Yuanjiao took Li Ximing home.

The youth stood with hands clasped behind him. Clad in a Daoist robe and a medicine pouch at his waist, he gazed down at the mountains below. In front of him, Li Yuanjiao, dressed in his usual black robe, steered through the wind.

"Only a portion of the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi has been gathered. Xijun has decided to take the Cold Pine Snow Qi instead," he said in a solemn voice.

"I see, I'm sorry that he has to go through that..."

Li Ximing's robes fluttered in the wind as he nodded, his fingers caressing the jade beads—Azure Manifestation— around his wrist. The corners of his mouth drooped, hiding a myriad of unspoken thoughts. Yet, he maintained a stoic expression.

Li Yuanjiao was a perceptive person. As he read Li Ximing's expression, discomfort flickered through him as he could not tell what was going through the younger man's mind.

They flew in silence until Mount Lijing loomed below.

Despite being away for several years, Li Ximing still found the mountain familiar. Upon entering the cave dwelling, Li Yuanjiao handed him the jade box containing the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi and a talisman pill.

"You can get the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual from your father," he said.

Li Ximing nodded and respectfully replied, "Ximing won't let everyone down."

As Li Ximing slowly withdrew, Li Yuanjiao remained seated in a daze, his brows knitting tightly together. After a long while, his expression finally softened as he exhaled.

"You've certainly grown up... So grown up that you hide even your mind from your family. If I can't read your thoughts, how can I entrust the Li Family to you?" he muttered with some sadness in his voice.

When they were all but children, I've always thought that Ximing was the affectionate one, while Xijun was the cold one... Now that they've grown up, they both seem impassive, though Xijun shows at least a touch of human emotion.

Li Yuanjiao had discussed the children from the generation of Xi and Yue with Li Yuanping on multiple occasions.

Li Xijun had the best character, and though Li Ximing was capable, he often appeared overly rigid, lacking any notable qualities and occasionally appearing distant.

If Li Ximing had not been the most gifted, blessed with innate talents in alchemy and born of Changhu's lineage, they might well have chosen to entrust the Li Family to Li Xijun instead.

Yet, seeing the brothers' harmonious relationship, they ultimately decided on Li Ximing since he was a gentle and reasonable child.

Now, observing his demeanor after years away, seeming distant even from his own kin, Li Yuanjiao unfastened his black robe, feeling a weary resignation as he approached the small well in the cave dwelling.

The water shimmered, showing the reflection of fierce eyes that seemed like it was about to pick a victim to be devoured, under eyebrows that were too close to each other.

Li Yuanjiao squinted as he stared at himself in the water for a while.

When I was little, I was Father's least favorite child... I guess he must have been frightened by my appearance.

He eventually looked away, settled down cross-legged, and began to cultivate in solitude.

————

Li Ximing descended the mountain and walked in silence. The spiritual qi of Mount Lijing paled in comparison to that of Xianyou Peak. Reflecting on his age, he realized he was already sixteen.

I'm at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... After taking the talisman pill, I'll reach the sixth stage. It'll take another two or three years to break through, so I should be reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm by eighteen.

Xiao Yuansi had reached the Qi Cultivation Realm at twenty, yet it took him nearly forty more years to break through to the next realm, at the age of sixty. Li Ximing understood the delay all too well.

It's definitely because the Xiao Family requires him to constantly produce pills.

Ancestor Xiao Chuting had been a Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist himself. Even with such a precedent, Xiao Yuansi was still severely hindered. Being a gentle person by nature, Xiao Yuansi dutifully refined pills without complaint.

What about me, then? I'm the only alchemist in the family. As soon as I ignite the Pill Flame, I can start bringing in profits to the family. Even if my family cares about me, I probably won't have much time to cultivate... And on top of that...

Li Ximing had received the letter from home as soon as he had just broken through to the Jade Capital stage and ignited the Pill Flame to refine pills. He tried not to be suspicious, but this timing still chilled his heart.

As he continued walking, he noticed a figure ahead who was standing with a sword in his arms. His eyebrows were sharp like blades and his eyes were bright as the stars—it was Li Xijun.

Li Xijun had already taken the talisman pill and reached the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, making his strength a level higher than Li Ximing. He approached with his sword and said softly, "Brother, it's been too long since you came home. Why the long face?"

Li Ximing looked at him blankly, then suddenly took out a jade box that had flowing golden patterns from his storage pouch. He handed it over with a sigh of relief and said, "I think you should take this."

"The Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi?!"

Li Xijun was stunned, unable to find his voice for a while before he erupted, "Li Ximing! Have you lost your mind?!"

Li Ximing looked much more at ease and explained, "I've given it much thought. Our family needs a steady supply of pills and medicine, so I'll inevitably be spending a lot of time in alchemy. It'd be a waste for me to practice that Grade Four cultivation technique, so I was thinking of letting you have it instead. I'll use a less impressive technique and focus on alchemy. You should be the one overseeing the family."

He paused, then added, "I've observed many alchemists in sects and families being hindered by their craft. Achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm is rare among them... Perhaps I should follow the path my grandfather did. He specialized in drawing talismans instead of chasing after the Foundation Establishment Realm..."

Li Xijun sneered and shot back, "I see, you've thought this through... But your grandfather only focused on drawing talismans because he had no hope of attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm! You, however, clearly are more talented than the rest of us, yet you choose to dedicate yourself to alchemy?!"

He could feel a rising frustration as he continued, "How can a Qi Cultivation Realm alchemist even be compared to a Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist?!"

Gritting his teeth, he continued bluntly, "You're just scared, Li Ximing! The family has pinned so much hope and expectations on you, believing you could be another Xiao Chuting. Yet here you are, overthinking things and trying to escape from all of it!"

Li Ximing, stung by the accusation, flushed and retorted, "So what if I'm trying to escape? It all falls on me, everything depends on me... You speak without feeling the weight! Do you truly think everyone can become like Xiao Chuting? It's impossible to maintain such a pace of cultivation progress while mastering alchemy simultaneously! The world doesn't work that way!"

"I fear I can't juggle alchemy and cultivation simultaneously! What if I die trying to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm? All this precious spiritual qi would be squandered in vain! In that case, I wouldn't even make it as a Qi Cultivation Realm alchemist!" he added, his voice thick with distraught and frustration.

Li Xijun had said what he wanted to say. He shoved the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi back into Li Ximing's arms and said, "Fine! You'll accompany me up the mountain. We'll tell Second Uncle about this and let him decide!"

Li Ximing slumped onto the ground, clutching the jade box in his arms, and fell silent. Li Xijun let out a long sigh and softened his tone.

"Brother, you shouldn't stress yourself out like this..."

"How can I not?" Li Ximing retorted weakly.

He caressed the jade box on his lap, his voice soft and wistful as he said, "Our high ancestor remained a mortal for twenty years before ultimately achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm. Likewise, our three great ancestors were amazing heroes too. Whenever I read our family history, I just find them so amazing... As a child, I always heard the elders say you are most like them. You are calm, composed, thoughtful, and ruthless," he spoke softly.

Li Ximing lifted his head and continued, "I tried feigning composure as well, but I've done poorly. Unlike you, I'm just a fox trying to act like a tiger... When I was ten, my father asked me to kill someone, and I did it. I knew what he expected me to become. I was terrified at the time but didn't dare to show it.

"Later, when I went to the Xiao Residence, I was led astray by the temptations of wine and women multiple times whenever I descended the mountain. Master Xiao had warned me repeatedly... I thought being a member of the Li Family would shield me from such temptations, but..."

Li Ximing's voice was muffled as he confessed, "In truth, I feared the Clan Affairs Courtyard. I'm worried about tarnishing my father's reputation. With the elders looming over us, I have to behave myself. If I could get away with doing all that, I would have caved and given in to those temptations already..."

His demeanor was flustered, nearly panicked.

Li Xijun was taken aback, his expression shifting dramatically before he could no longer contain himself and interrupted anxiously, "Y-You've... broken your Yang Essence already?! With someone from the Xiao Family no less! Our fathers took extensive precautions and planned everything meticulously, yet you..."

"Did you father any children?" he asked suddenly.

Li Ximing shook his head silently, tears streaking his face as he replied, "I don't know."

"You don't know?" Li Xijun stood up abruptly, gripping his sleeves tightly with an unreadable expression on his face.

Finally, he flung his sleeve and said coldly, "You don't know?! No wonder... No wonder!"

Li Ximing snapped his head up as if he had been kicked, and pleaded, "Xijun! I...I am... No, please listen to me..."

He scrambled on the ground, standing abruptly, losing his composure momentarily as he blurted out, "I've had many discussions with Brother Cheng. I'm different from you. The words I shared with my father were often guided by my mother and grandmother. I am not the talent meant to carry the Li Family to success..."

Gazing at the silent Li Xijun before him, Li Ximing felt a surge of regret and fear as he thought to himself, Ah, it would be better to be honest with him! At least, I wouldn't have to keep up this pretense...

"You!"

Li Xijun looked at Li Ximing's expression, memories of their night discussing clan affairs on the mountain surfacing. After some reflection, he realized Li Ximing had always cleverly agreed with him. Since they had been close as brothers, he had never really paid any attention to this until now.

"No wonder you were so eager to drink that night. I thought it was your first time drinking and you couldn't handle the alcohol. It turns out you wanted to get drunk quickly to avoid exposing your true self! They shouldn't have sent you to the Xiao Family!"

Looking at the expression on Li Xijun's face, Li Ximing suddenly calmed down. He waved his hands, the Azure Manifestation on his wrist clinking softly. With a gentle, resigned tone, he said quietly, "Xijun... not everyone can be like you."

Li Xijun closed his eyes, his demeanor turning frosty. After a long silence, he said, "Don't make any excuses. Come with me to the mountain and report everything. Let the clan make the decision."

"Fine."

As Li Ximing uttered his agreement, he was suddenly struck across the face, sending stars flashing before his eyes. His robe and jade crown were torn away, leaving his hair in disarray.

The jade crown lay shattered on the ground, his medicine pouch and its contents scattered around him. He was clad only in a thin layer of white undergarment.

Li Ximing finally registered what happened. He touched his nose and found it bloody. He then heard Li Xijun's icy voice break the silence.

"Stay stripped of clothes and crown while you wait for your punishment!"

————

Buzz...

The golden bowstring hummed softly. The middle-aged man lowered the longbow adorned with mysterious runes in his large hands.

In the distance, an eagle lay in a pool of blood, its innards crushed. Two men approached him from behind and showered him with words of flattery.

"General, you've truly earned your title as the Golden Bowstring! That shot was swift and masterful...!"

They were from the Ning Family, sent by Ning Hejing. Despite their flattery, Li Xuanfeng remained stoic. As the cultivator below dragged the slain beast closer, he responded gruffly, "Flattery breeds complacency, do not speak of it again."

Since the flattery did not work, the flatterers quickly shifted the conversation to something else. They looked at the person presenting an eagle egg and exclaimed, "Congratulations, General! This Foundation Establishment Realm beast has left behind an offspring!"

Li Xuanfeng accepted the egg casually and then soared into the wind. He slung his bow over his back, then fished out a jade pendant from his storage pouch to enter the city.

Ning Hejing has credited me with more than ten small merits... Together with my recent hunts, I should be able to redeem an Essence Gathering Pill without any issue.

Considering the timing, Yuanjiao is likely about to establish his foundation. If only I could get Liu Changdie to bring it out with him...

As soon as he landed in the city, a crowd gathered around him, chanting, "General!"

Li Xuanfeng offered a small smile and exchanged a few pleasantries with the crowd when a woman descended gracefully onto the city wall.

She was clad in the green outfit that the cultivators of the immortal sect typically wore. The gold embroidery on her sleeves indicated her status as a peak master. Her eyebrows arched softly above her warm eyes, and she appeared to be in her twenties.

The gathered clan cultivators fell silent and swiftly dispersed. Li Xuanfeng cupped his fist respectfully and said, "I am Li Xuanfeng. May I ask which peak master graces us today?"

"Greetings, General. I am Ningwan from Moon Lake Peak," she replied.

Ning Wan was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator who had refined the Pine Forest Wind into the immortal foundation known as Clear Hearing. She exuded a subtle pine fragrance—refreshing yet bitter.

Bathed in moonlight, she seemed almost ethereal.

Li Xuanfeng bowed his head as Ning Wan continued softly, "I have been waiting a long time... I did not expect the General to be so devoted to his duties. Please bathe and change your clothes; you have been summoned by a Daoist Master."

Li Xuanfeng was slightly taken aback. He remained solemn, despite feeling puzzled.

Daoist Master Yuan Su...? What is this about?

He nodded then retreated to change his attire, stowing his bow in his storage pouch before exiting his cave-dwelling. Ning Wan was still waiting outside the courtyard, idly toying with a string of jade beads.

Upon seeing Li Xuanfeng emerge from the cave, she nodded slightly before both of them took to the wind.

Ning Wan suddenly asked, "When did your clan move to Moongaze Lake? The great war back then devastated the southern shore, extinguishing all life there. I'm guessing it must have been within the last three hundred years."

Caught off guard by her abrupt question, Li Xuanfeng replied, "According to my clan's records, it was indeed three hundred years after that great war. The spiritual energy of the southern shore was cut off for more than two centuries, deterring any visitors, forcing us to live as mortals for those three hundred years."

"Ah."

Ning Wan smiled gently, her eyebrows arching playfully as she softly remarked, "Mortals with spiritual orifices and three generations of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... Fellow Daoist, you must be jesting. Such tales, if shared with the Daoist Master, might lead to serious consequences."

Her words, soft as the breeze, reverberated in his ears like thunder. Li Xuanfeng suddenly looked up, locking eyes with Ning Wan's soft gaze.

Ning Wan, renowned as the most beautiful woman of Azure Pond and nicknamed the Fairy of the Autumn Lake even before she established her foundation, indeed had captivating eyes. However, Li Xuanfeng was not in the mood to appreciate them.

Is she trying to warn me? Why? My family has no ties to her, so why would she offer help?

What is Yuan Su trying to do...? Are they trying to unearth my family's secrets?




# Chapter 433: Li Of Wei

Daoist Master Yuan Su's cave dwelling was modest, constructed from ordinary rock and devoid of lavish decorations, save for the coiling bronze statue of a beast that was neither a wolf nor tiger at its entrance.

Ning Wan led the way as they entered the cave dwelling together. Inside, Daoist Master Yuan Su sat elevated, absentmindedly staring at a small, light golden seal in his hand.

This was Li Xuanfeng's first meeting with a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Daoist Master Yuan Su had a round face and lacked any imposing presence, appearing to be a man in his early twenties. He sat with a hand resting on his knee, looking rather relaxed.

The air was thick with white mist that was swirling endlessly with exceptionally rich spiritual qi. In fact, it was potent enough that one could likely grasp a handful and refine it into Minor Pure Spiritual Qi. The chill Li Xuanfeng felt around his ankles suggested that the source of the mist was likely a type of spirit water.

Yuan Su wore light leather armor with a halberd lying beside him, both shimmering in light golden hues.

He looked up.

"Li Xuanfeng greets the Daoist Master!"

"Junior greets the Daoist Master!"

Daoist Master Yuan Su merely grunted in acknowledgment.

The green walls were inscribed with lines of text, obscured by the thick spiritual qi that had condensed into mist. Although Li Xuanfeng could not read them, he could tell that they had been frequently altered due to the varying depth of the characters.

Yuan Su did not keep them waiting for long. After a brief pause, he said, "Wan'er, the light in the void has faded. The person in question must have reincarnated, possibly somewhere between Yufu Prefecture and Lin'an Prefecture. Have someone keep an eye on those regions and prevent any conflicts from erupting."

"Junior understands," Ning Wan replied with a slight nod.

Yuan Su continued with his instructions, "Make the necessary arrangements for those returning from the north from purging evil to protect the Dao. Ensure the Metallic Essence he is connected to remains intact and just see him back safely."

Li Xuanfeng remained silent, absorbing the information from their conversation. Yuan Su then turned his gaze to him, asking gently, "Did Li Mutian ever establish an immortal foundation? Of what nature was it?"

Despite the sudden shift in topic, Li Xuanfeng was not caught off guard. Throughout his journey here, he had pondered this question often and replied calmly, "My grandfather was a mortal man; claims about him being a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator were merely baseless rumors. During times of vulnerability, our family let this rumor spread to leverage some advantage."

Yuan Su nodded and asked, "It's quite extraordinary that three of the four sons of a mortal man possess spiritual orifices... Do you know why?"

With the most important question finally voiced, Li Xuanfeng, well aware of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's methods, nodded and chose his words carefully.

"Truth be told, our family has often pondered about our ancestral lineage as well. We've even heard rumors of an heir to the immortal mansion bearing the surname Li and wonder if there might be a connection between us."

This direction of this conversation was nearly taboo to speak of, causing Ning Wan to cast a worried glance his way. Yet, Li Xuanfeng maintained his composure, speaking calmly as though he was discussing something as trivial as the weather.

"Oh?"

Daoist Master Yuan Su chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement as he responded, "You speak of Donghua Li Jiangqun? Such audacity!"

Waving his hand, he continued, "Most Li and Cui families trace their origins back to Wei State. The most probable lineage would be from the Li Family of Wei State, followed by the Li Family from Mount Tan of Wu State. The Li Family was distinguished back in the days, leaving behind many lineages."

"As for Daoist Master Donghua..." Li Xuanfeng's voice trailed off.

Daoist Yuan Su's gaze lingered on Li Xuanfeng's gray eyes for a moment before he smiled and replied, "Daoist Master Donghua was a capable cultivator who hailed from Ning State. Were your family truly connected, your circumstances would be markedly different."

Pausing, he beckoned gently, "Come forward."

As Li Xuanfeng moved closer to the man, Yuan Su placed a hand on his shoulder, and with the other, he performed a hand seal to cast a spell. A colorful light appeared in his hand as a sharp pain pricked Li Xuanfeng's fingertip, drawing blood.

The blood swirled within the radiant light, transforming into a golden gleam. Yuan Su murmured, "Hmm, Li of Wei indeed... Though the Dao lineage has long since been severed..."

As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it was a surprise that he would spend so much effort to find an answer to this question. Yuan Su dispersed the spell with a flick of his wrist and confirmed, "Your family is descendants of the Li of Wei..."

He paused, his expression clouded with contemplation. Moments later, clarity seemed to dawn on him, his face brightening with a triumphant smile as if he had just solved a puzzle that troubled him for a long time.

"I've always wondered why those bald donkeys had persistently antagonized your Li Family... Now it all makes sense! After the Jie people conquered Wei State and took control of the north, they destroyed the Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion. That definitely explains the blood feud! Surely, you must be the descendant of the main Li Family from Wei State!"

Yuan Su, who was centuries old, had experienced most of life's pleasures and was no longer easily impressed.

However, the revelation of such an elaborate scheme has left him visibly pleased, and he exclaimed with a broad smile, "That's a clever ploy! Even those monks might never unravel why fate has conspired with you! The Wrathful Maha only knew he had to kill the whale, but did not know the origin of it."

"Were it not for my seemingly trivial intervention, who would have realized this? Employing the Bright Yang Metallic Essence to weave a plot over a millennium—this is truly the work of a great cultivator! Such is the art of a Golden Core Realm cultivator!"

Li Xuanfeng, though only partially comprehending, felt relieved to have averted a crisis. Yuan Su, caught up in his enthusiasm, paced excitedly. He suddenly paused, reflecting with a hint of regret, "It's no wonder Xiao Chuting plays chess the way he does... If that old thing didn't redo his cultivation, he would have been a truly formidable junior!"

Ning Wan, equally taken aback by Yuan Su's rare display of emotion, recognized snippets of the larger narrative.

Is he talking about the Wrathful Maha's incident?

A partial understanding often carried the most profound impact. Chills ran down Ning Wan's spine as fear gripped her.

So, these are the capabilities of a Golden Core Realm cultivator... Even if besieged and killed, he still managed to devise a contingency plan to kill the Ninth Maha Reincarnate a millennium later!

She was chilled to the core, feeling utterly powerless against the Pristine Water Origin Talisman True Monarch above her.

Who else could possibly thwart the schemes of the three True Monarchs of Yue State then?

Li Xuanfeng remained silent, absorbing the revelations, piecing together fragments of the truth. However, the Daoist Master seemed like he had no desire to say more as he had affirmed Li Xuanfeng to be the descendant of the Li Family from Wei State.

He patted Li Xuanfeng's shoulder and suggested with a grin, "Li Xuanfeng, since you are unmarried, why don't you consider taking a bride from my Ning family?"

Li Xuanfeng was taken aback by the suggestion but before he could respond, Daoist Master Yuan Su added with a teasing smirk, "Don't even think about Wan'er. She has the potential to reach the Purple Mansion Realm, but your path is fraught with challenges."

"Hemian would be a good match. Act swiftly and waste no time," Yuan Su said.

Recognizing the finality in Yuan Su's tone, Li Xuanfeng knew refusal was not an option.

Meanwhile at Li Residence on Mount Lijing...

The small courtyard atop the mountain was eerily silent, bathed in moonlight so white it resembled frost.

Li Ximing, who was dressed in white, kneeled quietly on the ground. His cheeks were swollen, bruised with patches of purple and red.

Li Yuanjiao sat in the high seat before him with a dark face. His naturally fierce face was filled with anger, and he looked as if he were on the verge of devouring someone alive.

Unlike his granduncle, Li Tongya, whose anger was silent and brooding, Li Yuanjiao's wrath blazed visibly in his eyes. When his face tensed, malice was clearly etched across his features.

Li Qinghong was present from the beginning and she stood silently at the side, her expression as cold as frost. Li Ximing dared not lift his gaze.

After a prolonged tense silence, the sound of hurried footsteps approached from outside. Li Yuanping pushed the door open, his expression grim. He stood at the side of the room in silence despite his heart aching for his child.

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes, trying his best to suppress his rage as he asked dangerously calmly, "Brother Ping... is this the work of Man On Creek?"

Li Yuanping's face was pale. The frail man kneeled and bowed deeply, answering the question solemnly, "He has no reason to.... Besides... Ximing has a talisman seed in him."

Li Yuanjiao slowly shook his head, his upset evident. He had just retreated into seclusion not long ago, only to be abruptly interrupted. The sight of his junior in such a state only deepened his dismay.

He lamented internally, I can only blame myself for being so engrossed in cultivation that I failed to observe the younger ones closely. I always thought he was a disciplined one, so I rashly sent him to the Xiao Family... This is my fault!

Uncertainty about any descendants in the Xiao Family weighed heavily on him.

Shattering his Yang Essence is no great sin; youthful indiscretions are not unheard of... But what if he leaves behind an heir out there...

Ximing is the eldest son of the Changhu's direct lineage... the first lineage! Any child of his would follow in that lineage. Without future offspring, that child will be the last of Changhu's lineage. Even if Ximing does leave behind a child out there, there are still clan rules and laws to consider...

A profound silence fell over the courtyard. Li Yuanping slowly sat down and said softly, "Why not..."

Before he could finish, Li Yuanjiao interrupted him with a wave of his hand. He cast a glance at Li Ximing and suggested, "Let's discuss this inside."

The three moved to the backyard, where Li Yuanping continued in a hushed tone, "Why not strip this child of his status in the clan system and expel him from the main family, just as a precaution?"

"No!"

Li Yuanjiao looked at him and continued, "He is your only son. Doing so will end the first lineage!"

"This can be solved with an adoption," Li Yuanping suggested.

Li Ximing was his biological son, yet his words were ruthless. His face betrayed no emotion, save for his slightly trembling hands.

Li Yuanjiao shook his head and said, "He's just a young man lured by pleasures... We shouldn't be too harsh. Since he has shown genuine remorse, we'll revoke only his title as the future young family head; all else will remain unchanged."

Shadow enveloped Li Yuanjiao's face as he continued in a deep voice, "This matter should not be met with harsh punishment, but handled with leniency. He worries about having to balance cultivation with clan duties, right? Let him receive the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi as planned, and before he establishes his foundation, we will not burden him with too many responsibilities in alchemy."

Li Yuanping listened to the lenient sentence, slowly lifting his head to ask, "And who shall be the future young family head?"

"We'll try Xicheng."

As soon as Li Yuanjiao finished speaking, Li Yuanping's expression shifted rapidly, and he whispered urgently, "Brother... This could lead to chaos!"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head, gritting his teeth.

"This is the only path forward for now."

Li Yuanping's face reddened, his voice deepening, "What happens after Xicheng? Will the second lineage continue ruling the family or will it revert to the first lineage? You should know that this decision could start a crack in the family!"

Li Yuanjiao's response was hoarse.

"What do you want then? Turn Ximing—a prodigious alchemist of our family—into a bitter enemy...?"

Li Yuanping's expression hardened and he replied ruthlessly, "If it comes to that, I will cripple his cultivation with my own hands!"

Tears streamed down Li Yuanping's face, having already lost his voice at this point. Li Yuanjiao rose from the shadows, his face illuminated by moonlight.

"Ximing has received a talisman seed and read the Internal History!" he reminded his younger brother sternly.

Both men fell into a heavy silence. After a long pause, Li Qinghong finally spoke.

"How about this: we claim he was led astray by an enemy's divine ability, which will spare him excessive self-blame and calm the public's unrest. It's unwise to punish him too harshly. Let's set this accusation aside for now and pretend nothing happened. We'll explain to Ximing that he was under the influence of a divine ability."

Li Yuanping's anger ebbed slightly as he whispered, "So, you want us to pretend nothing happened... But we can't be certain what the Xiao Family thinks. Moreover, given what has transpired, how can we still rely on him?"

Li Qinghong replied thoughtfully, "Using him might be better than not. He is still a descendant of the Li Family. Perhaps he's only confused momentarily, but not forever... Let's wait and see. Xicheng used to be stoic but now he's a benevolent and kind person. Who can predict the future? People can change."

"We can't say for sure he will give up on his debauchery ways after this, but my brother and I are still in our prime. With the Profound Light's protection, the family isn't in immediate danger," she added.

Exhaling softly, she continued, "When Grandfather was still around, he was always cautious, never sowing seeds of disaster over uncertainties. It's wiser to act prudently."

Li Yuanping cupped his fist and calmly urged, "I still think it is better to remain vigilant, brother and sister. My days are numbered, I fear I cannot avert the inevitable."

After bowing deeply, he departed.

Li Qinghong watched him leave, then turned to the silent Li Yuanjiao and sighed.

"Yuanping is being too extreme! Although Ximing has made a mistake, he doesn't deserve to be punished so harshly... Brother, you should've intervened!"

The recent quarrel between the two brothers was apparent. Though Li Yuanjiao appeared to defend Li Ximing, his suggestions subtly pushed Li Ximing toward peril, prompting Li Yuanping's outcry about crippling his own son's cultivation.

Yet, Li Yuanjiao was still dissatisfied and wanted to push further. Li Qinghong listened to the entire exchange, feeling chilled to her core, and knew she had to intercede to put an end to it.

Li Yuanjiao stood under the moonlight, listening to her as he clutched his sword tightly.

"I can't bear it either. Yuanping's harshness stems from a deep affection for his son... Otherwise, he'd never allow leniency," he commented softly.

He understood the immense effort Li Yuanping had invested in his only son and how much hope he had for him. Li Yuanjiao murmured, "Brother Ping's talents are limited by his root bone. His only hope lay in this boy. Since he had high hopes for him, his disappointment is great."

"His child has truly let him down..." Li Qinghong commented, emotionally torn.

Li Yuanjiao sighed and instructed, "Don't let them meet for the time being. Send Ximing to Mount Yuting to cultivate! We must prevent Yuanping from saying something that might fracture their bond. Young men are quick to anger, and too much blame could bring trouble."

With those words, he departed from the rear courtyard in silence. Li Ximing was still kneeling at the entrance, accompanied by Li Xijun. However, now Li Xicheng was also kneeling beside them quietly.

As Li Yuanjiao emerged, Li Xicheng began, "It's my fault for not guiding my brothers properly. Please..."

Li Yuanjiao, already irritated, interrupted him with a dismissive gesture. He soared into the sky and gazed at Moongaze Lake from above, clutching his sword tightly.

"Ancestor! I've never hesitated to vanquish foes and slay demons. Yet I find myself utterly drained when it comes to upholding justice and fairness..." he murmured softly with a burdened sigh.

He stood in the air, feeling the northern wind blowing against his face. After a long, contemplative sigh, he repeated the familiar words solemnly.

"Jiao dares not forget."




# Chapter 435: The Separation of Immortals and Mortals

Li Yuanping returned to the town, his heart still aching with anger and sorrow. His eyes were bloodshot as he entered the main hall which was dimly lit, with two small flickering lamps barely illuminating the space.

Dragging his exhausted body along, he sat on the highest seat and picked up a document, only to find himself unable to focus. Frustrated, he coughed twice, swallowing the blood that rose in his throat.

Dou Yi hurried in, climbing the steps quickly. Li Yuanping spoke in a low voice, "Prepare the ink."

Dou Yi obediently ground the ink, and after finishing, Li Yuanping waved him away. Taking up the brush, Li Yuanping gradually calmed down, taking some time to think through his thoughts carefully.

The position of family head required balancing the external branches of the clan, managing the spirit fields, and distributing the clan's stipends. It involved managing the benefits of nearly the entire clan, from those in the Embryonic Breathing Realm to those in the Qi Cultivation Realm. Ever since Li Xuanxuan became the family head and established the four lineages, the rule of single succession had been set.

Now, with the Li Family firmly under the control of the main family endowed with the talisman seed, the family head could be appointed arbitrarily, with the wise ruling and the foolish obeying.

But once this precedent was set, future descendants of the main family, whose bloodlines would become more distant and whose backgrounds would differ, might begin to support different lineages, leading to internal strife.

"If it comes to that, the position of family head will become a tool for power struggles among the talisman seed-bearing cultivators, used to exploit the family... Moreover..."

As Li Yuanping's emotions settled, his thoughts became sharper, and he mused, "Seeing how things are with Ming'er, he is ultimately not fit for great responsibility. If the Li Family were handed over to him, how could he suppress the external branches? How could he control someone like Li Jiman?"

The hall was silent, with only Li Yuanping sitting high above in the dim light, his gaze fixed on the flickering lamps. His voice was low as he continued solemnly, "In the end, the family lacks a figure of great power to maintain order. Foundation Establishment Realm may be achievable, but the Purple Mansion Realm is far beyond reach. Without significant fortune, the family is destined for decline or division..."

He stared blankly ahead of him as the first light of dawn slowly crept into the hall. His elder brother, Li Yuanjiao, stood quietly at the entrance, unnoticed by Li Yuanping, who was deep in thought.

As the morning light climbed the steps of the main hall, Li Yuanping spoke in a muffled voice, "The current clan law was established by our great-grandfather. In those days, the family had only a few in the Embryonic Breathing Realm... how could he have foreseen today's situation? Simply following the old laws may not be the best approach..."

Only then did Li Yuanping notice Li Yuanjiao standing before him. His gaze was sharp as he spoke softly, "Brother, if I were to die, who in the family should take the lead, suppress the external branches, command Mount Yue, and manage the clan while nurturing the younger generation?"

Li Yuanjiao hesitated before answering slowly, "At present, only Xijun is capable of such a task. Aside from him, Xicheng is too kind, and Ximing is..."

"It is indeed difficult to pick among those in the generation of Xi and Yue! They are all highly talented. By right, none should be singled out to lead. But if their generation passes without a strong leader, and the next generation lacks a dominant figure, what then?" Li Yuanping asked.

Li Yuanjiao vaguely understood the meaning behind his words and replied, "If that happens, it cannot be helped."

"Brother, I intend to reform the clan system."

He suddenly stood up and declared, "The authority of the family head is far too great, a system established during the time of Lord Xiangping... But how many in the clan can match him? This method centralizes power and benefits, but it is truly too difficult to manage. Our descendants cannot always produce individuals with exceptional cunningness but moderate talent. What happened with Ximing may seem coincidental, but in truth, it reveals that our family can no longer sustain such a system of governance. Sooner or later, something will go wrong."

Li Yuanjiao looked at him intently, saying nothing for a long time. Finally, he replied gently, "Do what you must. I will support you."

Li Yuanping seemed to have fully recovered from his disappointment in his eldest son, but there was a lingering sense of melancholy as he said in a deep voice, "First, we'll measure the spirit fields, record everything... and begin to decentralize power!"

————

For prestigious clans, it was nearly impossible to fully account for privately held spirit fields. Even the Azure Pond Sect couldn't accurately assess the spirit fields of the clans under its jurisdiction, having to rely on a rough estimate based on the number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators when collecting tribute.

The reason was simple: as long as an illusionary formation was in place, a small piece of land could easily blend into the vast mountains and seas, making it virtually impossible to detect unless by sheer chance or a sweep of one's spiritual sense.

Although the Azure Pond Sect had specialized techniques for breaking formations, it was unrealistic to inspect every cun of land thoroughly, so they had to rely on estimations based on earth veins and spirit veins.

This same reason explained why so many remnants of the Immortal-Devil War still existed within the sea, with their protective formations so advanced that even if one were to bash their head against them, they still would not be able to find the entrance.

However, when Li Yuanjiao summoned the mirror, he was able to see every cun of the Li Family's land clearly. He could immediately identify which prominent families had secretly built small courtyards and demarcated spirit fields, as they were all exposed before his eyes.

"Indeed..."

This situation was inevitable. Every prominent family under the Li Family's rule had privately developed spirit fields. In the barren lands that the Li Family had deemed worthless, they had secretly enclosed courtyards and set up illusionary formations to plant spirit paddies.

This was considered the lesser offense. Over the years, as more external cultivators joined the family, they had come into contact with many cultivation methods from rogue cultivators. Not all children with a spiritual orifice were sent to the Li Family; some external cultivators even ventured out to seek other opportunities, never to return.

Li Yuanjiao's gaze swept over the area, noting that even some minor sect cultivators of the Xi and Yue generation were involved. He sighed quietly.

"These lands may be barren, but they are still free! After all, no matter how good the family's lands are, most of the yield still has to be handed over. It is far more satisfying to grow and harvest for oneself."

The family had inspected these spirit fields twice before, and those remaining were within the allowed regulations. Li Yuanjiao carefully documented everything and returned to the hall, where Li Yuanping had been writing furiously for some time.

When Li Yuanjiao returned, Li Yuanping took the map he had drawn and circled several immortal mountains. After pondering for a moment, he spoke softly, "Brother, I have carefully studied the old methods from Lixia Prefecture and the current practices of the Yuan Family... Take a look at my plan."

Li Yuanjiao lowered his head to examine it, and at the top were large letters: Dual Clan System, Peak and Town Counterbalance.

Li Yuanping, his face pale but eyes bright, explained, "Now that our family has more cultivators than ever, I want to separate the clan system from the sect system, placing the clan above and the sect below, separating immortals from mortals. Cultivators would join the peaks and form the clan, while mortals would descend the mountain and form the sect. Unless specifically assigned for demon extermination, none are permitted to descend the mountain.

"When an external or clan member develops a spiritual orifice, they will be sent to the main peak of Mount Lijing to cultivate, where our family cultivators will carefully guide them. Those with high aptitude will continue their cultivation, while those with lower aptitude will be sent to other peaks.

"Each immortal mountain will establish its own office, dispersing the descendants of the four lineages into them. They will have a peak master, an enforcer, and a clan chief... All spirit fields below the mountain will no longer be individually assigned but managed by the respective immortal mountains.

"The cultivators of each immortal mountain will rotate and be reassigned regularly. The collected spirit resources will be sent directly to Lijing and delivered to the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche. As for the family head... the head will handle promotions and assignments, while the clan chiefs and enforcers will monitor the clan's affairs. With the mirror in the family, any embezzlement of spirit resources is almost certain to be exposed!"

Li Yuanping's eyes gleamed brightly as he went on, "Looking at today's situation, many of the external and branch cultivators are stealing spirit paddies, searching for treasures, transporting spirit resources, and seeking the Dao outside because there are no other paths to take within the family aside from cultivating spirit paddies. Without the opportunity for advancement, there is naturally no loyalty."

Finally, he concluded, "Under this new system, not only would our family no longer need to find large talentless direct descendants to manage the family and maintain stability, but it would also create positions and ranks that would attract people to align with our family..."

Li Yuanjiao read through the detailed regulations. Naturally, Li Yuanping had included much more than he had mentioned verbally. The plan was filled with various checks and balances, cultivation restrictions, and measures to curb corruption and rebellion.

"If this is the case, the Clan Affairs Courtyard will need many more personnel for oversight, and the various ranks will require clan stipends to maintain integrity..." Li Yuanjiao frowned as he read, realizing that while Li Yuanping's plan could indeed appease most cultivators, it would significantly increase the Li Family's governance costs. He hesitated, weighing the potential benefits against the losses.

However, Li Yuanping smiled confidently and responded readily, "Cultivating immortality and seeking the Dao is inherently one of the most greed-driven pursuits. Our family will soon be able to produce elixirs. Once these are tied to the ranks, many will flock to them! Besides, the desire for power is one of the Nine Calamities; when combined with other incentives, few can resist."

He added in a low voice, "As long as the external and branch families are eager to climb the ranks, they can be used by us. We will not need to rely on producing a genius every generation who can suppress and command them; even ordinary people will suffice. Even in normal times, we could promote people at will based on the lists provided by the Clan Affairs Courtyard... This would allow us to manage the family even in the midst of cultivation."

Li Yuanjiao gradually became intrigued, picking up where Li Yuanping left off, "This way, our family would not need to constantly monitor the external families. As long as we keep an eye on a few outstanding individuals and marry them into the family, the mirror will keep everything under control, allowing us to secure our position on the immortal mountain..."

"Exactly."

Li Yuanping agreed and continued, "Even if we have to distribute more clan stipends, so what? Brother, you are about to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm; the family will soon be very different."

Li Yuanjiao finally nodded in agreement, saying, "But in the end, it is because we descendants are unworthy, unable to concentrate power in one person, so we must delegate power and benefits to maintain stability. I just wonder... I just wonder how we will face our ancestors."

Li Yuanping nodded silently, comforting him, "Maximum benefit does not always mean maximum stability. As our family continues to expand, division of power will become inevitable... We cannot afford to lose."

Li Yuanjiao spoke with him for a while, feeling heavy-hearted, and then set off for Mount Wutu, intending to spend some time stabilizing his cultivation before entering seclusion to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.

————

Mount Yuting.

The snow on Mount Yuting remained pristine and bright. Li Xijun opened his eyes, exhaling a breath of white mist that collided with the longsword in his hand, forming a thin layer of frost.

"The Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual is indeed a Grade Three technique, cloaking me in dew and snow, allowing me to ride on cold winds."

His white robes fluttered as his power reached the first heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. His true essence was as pure as frost which was swirling all around him, and combined with the sharp blade in his hand, he appeared untouched by the world.

In just over two years, three members of the Xi and Yue generation had broken through in succession, adding three Qi Cultivators to the Li Family's main lineage.

Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong had both gone into seclusion one after the other, and both the main lineage and external branches of the family had made significant progress. The number of minor sect cultivators in the Yuan and Qing generation was few, but with the Xi and Yue generation, the minor sect cultivators, mainly from the first and second lineages, had begun to take charge of the spirit fields.

According to the Li Family's ancestral laws, most of the descendants of Li Mutian's illegitimate brothers had gradually transformed from minor sects into side branches due to the rarity of spiritual orifices, slowly fading from history.

With the restraint of offspring by the two major sects of the Xuan and Jing generation, Li Xuanling and Li Xuanfeng, it was not until the third generation that the minor sects of the four lineages in the Li Family began to flourish, led by the minor sects formed by the illegitimate sons of Li Xuanxuan and Li Yuanyun, who took over the power of the previous generation.

Of course, Li Xijun saw this as a favorable development. It prevented the emergence of hundreds of mortal elders of his father's generation, but brought the estranged minor sect closer to the center of power and thus resolved many conflicts.

"Young master."

An Siming, with a sword at his side, approached and cupped his fist respectfully.

Li Xijun, who had been in seclusion for a year and a half, suddenly noticed that An Siming's spirit and demeanor had changed. He seemed more hopeful in life and was more motivated. Li Xijun could not help but laugh at this observation and ask, "Have you taken a wife?"

An Siming was taken aback, shaking his head repeatedly before continuing, "You must be joking, young master! Young Master Xicheng is already waiting at the foot of the mountain."

Li Xijun descended gracefully to the foot of the mountain, where his elder brother, Li Xicheng, had been waiting for some time, clad in leather armor. He looked more mature now, seeming to be around twenty-six or twenty-seven years old.

Li Xicheng was also at the Qi Cultivation Realm, practicing the River One Qi Technique. He had married a woman from the Tian Family and taken concubines mostly from the An Family, so he had many children, most of whom were two or three years old.

As a father to so many children now, Li Xicheng had grown a beard and tied his hair, exuding a dignified presence. He greeted Li Xijun with a warm smile, saying, "It has been a long time, brother."

Li Xijun nodded slightly and landed beside him. A nearby horse snorted, eyeing him warily.

Li Xijun scanned the area with his spiritual sense, noting that the sides were filled with cultivators, primarily his illegitimate brothers and external branches of humble origins, all standing respectfully on either side.

As a youth, Li Xicheng had loved to protect his kin and befriend cultivators. Those who had benefited from his kindness now flocked around him.

Li Xicheng waved his broad hand, and the crowd dispersed right away. The two brothers strolled along the stone path, and Li Xicheng, in a warm tone, said with a smile, "This past year, while you and Ximing were in seclusion, there have been significant changes in the family. The family head has reformed the clan system; it is no longer as it was before."

He then recounted all the events of the past year and a half. Li Xijun frowned as he listened, and when Li Xicheng finally finished, he added, "Now, the changes have taken effect easily. Several immortal mountains have been restructured, and the construction of grand palaces is in full swing. All the cultivators are cooperating, contributing their money and effort..."

"They would naturally cooperate!"

Li Xijun thought it through quickly and understood the situation clearly. His expression darkened, and he said coldly, "The clan has given them power and stipends. They are not fools; of course they are pleased!"

Li Xijun spoke these words, but inwardly he pondered to himself, No wonder the spiritual qi on Mount Yuting has diminished significantly. It turns out that cultivators have entered the mountain! The family should start building a spirit-gathering formation so as not to delay the cultivation of the main lineage.

Li Xicheng quickly smiled, trying to smooth things over, "They are not taking it for free. The clan has assigned them various tasks, and now they are out there working—even bringing in some extra income for the family!"

Seeing that Li Xicheng still did not understand, Li Xijun looked around, saw no one nearby, and sighed as he spoke his thoughts.

"Brother, our elders have reluctantly divided their power. As juniors, we should feel ashamed, not proud..."




# Chapter 437: Yufu's Affairs

Li Xicheng suddenly choked up, shaking his head helplessly. He took out the jade slip containing the sect system from his sleeve and handed it over to Li Xijun, then said softly, "The new system has just been established, and most of the positions are still vacant. However, Uncle Ping can still manage the family affairs for now. We should hold on to the current personnel... They will be reassigned eventually. You can see for yourself."

Li Xijun looked at his older brother in surprise, then took the jade slip and examined it closely.

"The Dual Clan System..." he murmured softly.

As he continued reading, he understood the peak and town counterbalance system described at the end. Going back to the front, he carefully read about the Dual Clan System again.

After a long silence, he remarked softly, "Clan Uncle... He's splitting the four lineages and planning to establish a government on a peak... Is this still a family?"

Li Xicheng, alarmed by what he perceived as a bold remark, asked in a deep voice, "What are you trying to say?"

Li Xijun's face turned gloomy as he replied, "With this approach, we'll become the Lijing Sect instead of the Li Family of Lijing! The harmony of a family is maintained through generational continuity... If the members are scattered among the various peaks, how can it still be considered a family?"

Li Xicheng cast a glance at him and asked quietly, "What do you propose?"

"Just a few modifications to be made," Li Xijun replied, looking again at the jade slip, feeling that something was amiss.

"This one only details the sect system, not the clan's system. External cultivators and those from the branch family can be distributed among the peaks, but not the major and minor sects," he added.

He swung his sleeves and rode the wind toward the central hall.

Meanwhile on Mount Lijing...

Li Yuanping had worked tirelessly for over a year, finally setting up numerous systems in place. As his workload gradually reduced and his efforts began to show results, he felt a sense of relief.

Big Brother has been cultivating in seclusion. I wonder how much longer before he'll emerge again and how confident he is to achieve a breakthrough...

Just then, a commotion erupted in front of the central hall. Li Xijun, who was dressed in white, hurried into the hall with a frown. He kneeled and bowed deeply, speaking in a solemn voice.

"Nephew greets the Family Head!"

He's here!

Li Yuanping had been waiting for him for a long time. With his current influence in the family, no one could contest the new law. Only the younger generation dared to voice objections, so he smiled and asked, "What do you think, Jun'er?"

Li Xijun's bright eyes met his clan uncle's gaze. He was not about to criticize the plan outright and embarrass Li Yuanping. Instead, he took a different approach to the matter.

"I have a request to make!"

"Go on," Li Yuanping encouraged him and listened attentively.

He enjoyed conversing with this nephew of his tremendously. Li Xijun always managed to voice his objections tactfully, without causing discomfort to anyone.

"My request is to rebuild the Snake Demon Cave Dwelling on the lake, fill in the lake to create an island, and establish a department there. We should move the direct lineage of the family, along with the most talented minor sect members, to this island to cultivate and use it as the headquarters of the Li Family."

He added softly, "Jun'er understands your vision. What I mean to say is... the Dual Clan System should not turn our family into a sect."

"Li Family on the lake and offices on the shore of the lake..." Li Yuanping smiled slightly and nodded.

Li Xijun then stepped forward, pointing to the map, and explained, "The lakeside will serve as a base for managing matters related to external cultivators and protecting the mortals. Meanwhile, the lake itself will house the cultivators from the four direct lineages of the family and the talented members of the minor sect...

"One day, when Moongaze Lake is unified, we can then move to the heart of the lake, where the marketplace ruins are. From then on, we'll become the exalted immortal clan of the lake, and the areas around the lake will become a prefecture..."

Li Xijun's ambition was evident in his firm gaze. Li Yuanping listened with growing excitement.

Li Xijun continued, "I have explored the cave. Although it is not suitable for growing paddies, it's quite spacious and rich in spiritual qi, making it ideal for cultivation! There's no formation protecting the cave, so our people have gradually withdrawn since the ancestor's death. Isn't it nice to be able to put it to use again?"

After making his point, Li Xijun lowered his gaze and added, "This is just my humble opinion..."

Li Yuanping shook his head with a smile and assured, "Humility is not needed here! My father has already sent word to Shanji Prefecture in the east and asked the cultivators of the Profound Peak Gate to move the mountain and build the island. He just wanted to keep it a secret to avoid any ambushes!"

Li Xijun was momentarily taken aback before he sighed in relief.

"So, clan uncle has had this plan all along... I was overthinking and speaking ignorantly!"

Li Yuanping laughed and asked, "Do you remember the Rui Family?"

He pulled out a vermilion brush, circled a spot on the map, and explained, "The earth vein of this mountain is weak, but the water vein is rich, and there is a spirit spring. I intend to ask the members of the Profound Peak Gate to move this mountain and place it on the lake to serve as our family's main peak!

"We can eliminate the influence of the Green Essence Copper and utilize this spirit spring directly, saving the family from having to purchase one. Not only that, isn't it wonderful to have another peak?"

The Li Family had acquired a Vein Searching Technique from the An Family years ago, known as the Earthly Court Detection Technique, which allowed them to thoroughly investigate the earth and water veins.

Li Xijun listened to the explanation and replied, "Can the earth and water veins still be used after the move? Will the spirit spring disappear? It's best we request the people from the Profound Peak Gate to assess whether these resources will remain viable after the relocation first."

Li Yuanping smiled and replied, "It's not really a big problem. Currently, twelve families on the eastern shore have pledged allegiance and are paying tribute to us. We can select the most suitable one and offer them some compensation for the relocation... It won't cost much."

Li Xijun sighed with relief, a smile spreading across his face. He stood up and said, "Uncle, you are wise! It seems like I was worried for nothing."

Li Yuanping's expression grew serious. He sighed and said softly, "Jun'er, there's something I would like to tell you... Your father passed away early, and the generation of Xi and Yue has more members in the minor than major sect. If anything were to happen to me, the family would rely on you. Xicheng is your elder brother, so I can't speak ill of him... Ximing has let us down too. As an elder, this is the best I can do for my family."

Having worked tirelessly for years, Li Yuanping's complexion had deteriorated, and his smile was no longer as warm and pleasant.

He continued in a subdued tone, "After this matter is settled, I will gradually step back from family affairs. You will need to take charge."

————

On Mount Yuting...

Li Ximing sat cross-legged. The true essence of the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Technique flowed around him, casting hues of gold and red in the dim room.

He slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a wisp of golden qi.

Perhaps due to lingering doubts about the divine abilities of the Man on Creek, the elders had imposed a surprisingly light punishment—just confinement. Everything else remained unchanged. He was still eligible to receive pills and resources from the family but he was no longer burdened by family affairs.

Although he was confined to this lonely little courtyard, any resources he required were promptly sent to him at all times. Li Xijun also visited him occasionally.

Li Ximing felt as though a heavy weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Feeling much at ease, his cultivation progressed rapidly too.

"This is the best," he murmured to himself.

He practiced diligently every day and studied alchemy texts in his spare time. Considerate of his needs, Li Xijun frequently sent spirit items for him to practice with and aptly named his residence the Alchemy Pavilion.

Free from the clan's affairs, Li Ximing focused solely on refining pills and cultivating, channeling all his guilt into his work.

Li Ximing had poor mental fortitude. Under intense pressure in his youth, he often fantasized about becoming a Dharma relic—one entirely devoted to cultivation and pill refinement, calmly sitting atop the fire vein.

As long as he could continue to contribute tirelessly, he would not have to worry about disappointing his father.

I guess I'm pretty much living my childhood dream right now!

Li Ximing tapped his storage pouch lightly, causing a furnace to emerge and land on the ground with a thud. It was pitch black and supported by three legs, adorned with intricate patterns of waves and beasts and engraved with the name—Furnace In The River.

He retrieved a white and yellow wooden block, an Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit item known as Precious Pearl Wood.

Bringing his palms together, he summoned a pale golden Pill Flame.

Li Ximing nodded with satisfaction.

As expected of a Grade Four cultivation technique, the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual is truly remarkable. Since its true essence is pure yang energy, the Pill Flame it conjures surpasses the original.

"To refine the Yangqing Pill, I should use the Precious Pearl Wood with Blazing Sun Tri-Nine Technique."

This was the knowledge Xiao Yuansi had accumulated over time. Li Ximing placed the wooden block at the bottom of the furnace and took out a jade box. Using his mana, he picked up the Yangqing Fruit and added it to the furnace.

He slowly extracted the essence, then added a few supplementary medicinal ingredients, one after another.

Finally, he used the Pill Flame to continuously refine the mixture. After about an hour, six pale red spirit pills emerged from the furnace.

"Yangqing Pills, Embryonic Breathing Realm... complete!"

These six pills could sustain six Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators for several months, but it had only taken him an hour to refine. Li Ximing stored them with a special method, feeling a deep sense of satisfaction within him.

"Father... Ximing has not failed his elders."

Had his Yang Essence not been broken, he would definitely have had a chance to refine an extra half of the pill. Reflecting on this, he bowed his head silently, then took out more spirit items from his storage pouch, and prepared to refine another batch.

————

Having relocated from Xu State, Profound Peak Gate had settled in Shanji Prefecture.
𝗳𝚛𝚎𝚎𝘄𝕖𝕓𝕟𝕠𝚟𝚎𝕝.𝗰𝕠𝐦

The gate's sole guardian was Daoist Master Changxi, and most of its members cultivated earth elemental profound techniques. Since Shanji Prefecture was quite large, there were many members in the Profound Peak Gate.

The Profound Peak Gate was relatively modest, with only a few Foundation Establishment cultivators and disciples who were not particularly arrogant.

While Li Xuanxuan's arrival was being reported, he was warmly entertained by two outer disciples. Being the weakest of the seven gates, Profound Peak Gate had only a handful of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and its disciples were quite humble.

Li Xuanxuan waited at the foot of the mountain with the old monkey until a cultivator came down to meet him.

Dressed in white, the cultivator's good looks were spoiled by the moles on both cheeks that somewhat diminished his temperament. Adorned with various jade ornaments, he smiled and said, "Greetings, fellow Daoist from Lijing! I am Kong Yu of Profound Peak Gate. May I ask for your name?"

Despite being a peak Qi Cultivator, Kong Yu was very courteous. Surprised by his humble demeanor, Li Xuanxuan quickly replied, "I am Li Xuanxuan from the Li Family."

Kong Yu smiled and asked, "And the Celestial Moon Sword is...?"

"He's my second uncle!"

Upon learning of their close relationship, Kong Yu nodded approvingly and added, "Our Daoist Master was present when Senior Tongya slayed the Maha with his sword. He praised your esteemed family's swordsmanship, noting that even within the Wanyu Sword Gate, the Li Family's sword skills are exceptional!"

"Senior is too kind," Li Xuanxuan replied modestly.

Kong Yu sighed and continued, "If it weren't for the devil plague and the ongoing conflicts between the Wanyu Sword Gate, Chunyi Dao Gate, and Crimson Reef Island over the Green Pine Temple Ruins, someone would have sought guidance from your family already. It's a pity that Senior Tongya missed his chance for greater fame!"

Li Xuanxuan thought to himself quietly.

Pity, huh? The current top swordsman in our family is Jiao'er, who is comparable to Xuanling from back then... But he can't possibly match Second Uncle, who had already grasped sword qi when he was only at the Jade Capital Stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Without the rise of the Devil Plague, his reputation might have faded long ago...

Seeing that Li Xuanxuan was not interested in discussing this matter further, Kong Yu got straight to the point.

"Are you here to discuss changing the earth vein and relocating the immortal mountain, fellow Daoist?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded and replied, "I've heard that your immortal gate is reputed to be the best in Jiangnan when it comes to this sort of thing. After all, Mount Changxi was moved from Xu State and earned the acclaim of Profound Peak. I wonder if I could enlist one or two fellow Daoists to assist us..."

Kong Yu nodded. His gate was indeed specialized in such tasks, and while being hailed as the best in Jiangnan might be an exaggeration, being the best in Yue State was certainly well-deserved.

"Of course, we can assist you! The cost will depend on the earth vein, I'll need to inspect the land to determine the price. Once you decide, I will retrieve the dharma artifact immediately," he said.

Li Xuanxuan nodded in understanding and Kong Yu left to retrieve his belongings. Shortly after, he returned, hurrying down the mountain with a string of golden ropes around his waist.

"Let us be off then!" he exclaimed excitedly.

Kong Yu was an affable person. As they rode the wind together, he laughed and said, "Fortunately, my senior and junior brothers aren't here... Otherwise, this job might have been taken by someone else. Being stationed at the peak is a tough assignment! Nothing compares to enjoying the scenery and earning cultivation resources."

Li Xuanxuan chuckled. He had appreciated a lot of scenery and could agree that it was a nice change of pace compared to staying in the clan. He responded warmly, and Kong Yu let out a sigh.

"I have to say, Brother Xuanxuan, you and my eldest senior brother are quite alike. He governed the gate in his early years but was later killed by monsters... Seeing you, I'm reminded of him."

Li Xuanxuan offered some words of comfort, but Kong Yu seemed indifferent. Noticing that Kong Yu was heading west, Li Xuanxuan asked, "Why are we not passing through Yufu Prefecture? There are fewer devil cultivators there... Although you're from the immortal gate and quite powerful, there's no need to take unnecessary risks..."

Many disciples from the three sects and seven gates had fallen victim to the devil plague. Kong Yu shook his head at Li Xuanxuan's suggestion and replied, "We can't go through Yufu Prefecture. The gate has imposed a ban on it for the next three years. Trust me, if you go there, you might face dire consequences!"

"What?"

Li Xuanxuan's face paled. Having come from Yufu Prefecture with the old monkey, he found the area calm but was now deeply concerned and asked, "Why is that? I just came from Yufu Prefecture... Am I in trouble now?!"

Kong Yu took several steps back in the air. His face was filled with fear, and his voice trembled as he asked, "Did you linger there...? Did you say anything? Did you save someone's life?! I heard that Senior Li Tongya was closely associated with Daoist Master Chuting... How could you not have heard the news?!"

Li Xuanxuan shook his head and replied, "No... No, I just passed through. When I left home, the ancestor was still..."

"Then you should be fine!" Kong Yu sighed in relief, and a smile slowly returned to his face.

He assured, "Don't worry, as long as you haven't made any connections in the prefecture and haven't spoken a word there, you aren't implicated. There's nothing to worry about. If you get involved, it could be disastrous."

"Not knowing the details could lead to the destruction of your family though," he added.

He stepped forward, causing the jade pendants and jade buckles on his body to jingle, and he said mysteriously, "I've heard that even the Azure Pond has withdrawn its forces from Yufu Prefecture. The three Daoist Masters—Yuanwu, Yuansu, and Yuanxiu—are all focusing on sending this disaster out of Jiangnan and back to Mount Luoxia!"

Li Xuanxuan, still puzzled, asked, "Could you explain in more detail?"




# Chapter 439: Story

"Let's talk while we ride the wind."

Kong Yu, anxious and fearing that his opportunity to earn might be snatched away by his seniors or juniors, could hardly stay at the foot of the mountain gate for even a moment longer.

He soared through Shanji Prefecture as he explained, "According to my master, someone from an immortal gate of the Dao lineage on Mount Luoxia in the north has descended to undergo a tribulation. I'm not sure who he is, but his plan is to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm in nine months, establish a foundation over three years, find a beauty, dismantle clans, eliminate devil cultivators, and enjoy all the benefits of wealth... then return to the north..."

"T-That's..."

Li Xuanxuan, though skeptical, could not refute it and simply muttered under his breath, "If that's the case, it shouldn't be a problem for us to just pass through there..."

Kong Yu's face showed a flicker of terror as he responded in a low voice, "Fellow Daoist, you probably only think that he's nothing but a genius because you haven't encountered someone like him before. When you meet someone with fate or even Metallic Essence, you'll understand!"

"Senior Tongya should be aware of this as well... you might want to ask him," he added.

After saying this, Kong Yu fell silent and refrained from revealing more details, leaving Li Xuanxuan to infer what he would.

The two shifted the conversation to other topics, and by the time they left Shanji Prefecture, night had fallen. Kong Yu took out a jade box and placed it on his palm. He puffed his cheeks, blew out a black cloud, and explained, "Fellow Daoist, this Night Cloud is a dharma artifact that can provide concealment. Given the dangers on this road, you and your spirit beast should join me in this."

"Alright!"

Li Xuanxuan accepted his offer without hesitation. Despite Profound Peak Gate's current desolation, it still had a rich legacy. Naturally, as the descendant of Daoist Master Changxi, Kong Yu possessed many treasures.

With devil cultivators rampant and the two unable to pass through Yufu Prefecture, they were forced to navigate hills and forests filled with wild temples and rogue cultivators, where countless devil cultivators might lie in ambush. It was indeed perilous.

They had to pause their journey to cultivate during the day and resume at night. Kong Yu, who was both talkative and knowledgeable in the way of talismans, compared his notes with Li Xuanxuan, and both found the exchange extremely fruitful.

One day, as they flew toward the junction of Yue State and Xu State, they witnessed a devil cultivator fleeing on the wind, streaking across the night sky like a stream of golden light. A figure behind him, wielding a golden ring, pursued him relentlessly.

The scene was all too familiar, and they typically avoided such conflicts. Given that both the immortal and the devil were peak Qi Cultivators, provoking them was unwise.

Kong Yu stopped and whispered, "Those are people from the Golden Tang Gate... The Situ Family has some engagements with my Kong Family, so it's not right for me to just stand by. I'll lend him a hand."

As soon as Kong Yu finished speaking, he summoned a jade seal and hurled it directly at the devil cultivator. Li Xuanxuan sighed and began casting spells, using talismans to assist in restraining the devil cultivator.

Boom!

The devil cultivator, who was already exhausted, was overwhelmed by the combined assault from both parties. With two disciples from the immortal sect pressing on his tail, his several life-saving escape techniques proved futile. He met his end after only a few dozen exchanges.

The disciple from the Golden Tang Gate, wielding a golden ring that glowed with a hazy golden light, captured the devil cultivator's body and drew it toward him. It was clear he intended to claim the spoils for himself.

"Who are you?" he asked bluntly.

Li Xuanxuan didn't feel like answering him so he moved behind Kong Yu, pretending to be his lackey. Kong Yu frowned and replied, "I am Kong Yu from Profound Peak. It's been a while since I've seen anyone from the Golden Tang Gate. I'm not here to share in the spoils but rather to repay the favor of the past... I'm helping you out of gratitude."

"Oh," the young man replied indifferently, giving Kong Yu the cold shoulder.

"Oh? I see that you're a really friendly person, fellow Daoist," Kong Yu remarked sarcastically. Feeling a mix of embarrassment and anger, he swung his sleeves and turned to leave.

The young man, however, sneered and said, "And here I was, wondering who you are... It turns out you're from the One Stick of Incense Clan!"

Kong Yu's face flushed with rage instantly. His Dharma artifact flew into the air as he shouted, "How dare you, junior?!"

The young man remained unfazed, disdain evident on his face as he said, "Let me remind you that Kong Nuanmeng married Situ Li, who was already eliminated by my Situ Mo's lineage. If the Kong Family dares to mention past favors again, it'll be no different from challenging my family!"

Kong Yu's face turned into a mix of amusement and anger as he gritted his teeth and spat, "Fool! How did a great man like Situ Tang raise imbeciles like you?!"

With that, he turned and left, ignoring the shocked and furious expression of Situ Mo, the direct descendant of the Golden Tang Gate. He quickly took to the wind, with Li Xuanxuan hiding in the clouds. Li Xuanxuan let out a long sigh of relief when Situ Mo did not pursue them.

"Why provoke him, fellow Daoist? The Golden Tang Gate is known for its offensive cultivation techniques, and this Situ Mo seems like a legitimate heir. That golden ring he wields is quite formidable... Angering him could spell trouble for us."

Even if a fight did occur, Kong Yu, an old man who had failed to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm despite nearly a hundred years of effort, knew he would not be in immediate danger. However, the outcome might not be as favorable for Li Xuanxuan, who was merely a talisman crafter. Naturally, he feared for his life.

Kong Yu sighed and murmured, "In the past, Daoist Master Changxi visited Mount Golden Tang and helped the Golden Tang Sect move several mountains, which led to an alliance through marriage... I never imagined that time would fill the Situ Family with such arrogant descendants."

Golden Tang Gate had been in turmoil for so long, naturally, Kong Yu was aware of the changes within the Situ Family. The branch of the Kong Family that had married into the Situ Family had been wiped out long ago.

The Kong Family, being weak and unwilling to make enemies, had opted to focus on maintaining their alliance with the Golden Tang Gate rather than seeking retribution. However, Situ Mo's harsh words earlier had only chilled Kong Yu's heart.

"Clan that lasted only the duration of a stick of incense" was definitely an insult that left an impression on Li Xuanxuan. Despite his curiosity, he held back his questions and offered a few words of comfort while waiting for Kong Yu to explain further.

Unlike a sheltered disciple who had grown up on the immortal mountain, Li Xuanxuan was an astute man, having mingled with the secular world for decades.
𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

Given how Kong Yu brought up his deceased senior brother and past favors, Li Xuanxuan realized that Kong Yu was someone who struggled to hide his grief and tended to wallow in self-pity.

After a brief silence, Kong Yu finally spoke, as expected.

"To be honest, the Kong Family has suffered greatly due to the incident in Yufu Prefecture. My grandfather perished in this affair. While searching for spirit items near Jishui Prefecture in Xu State, he lost his senses and acted like a madman. Everything would have been fine if he had found a small tavern to rest, but instead, he insulted a young man.

"The young man sneered and walked away. Six months later, he attacked our clan and killed my grandfather... Despite being a top immortal cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm, my ancestor allowed a mere Qi Cultivator to escape!"

Li Xuanxuan felt as though he was listening to a storybook.

"How is that possible..?" he exclaimed in disbelief.

"How is it not possible?"

Kong Yu's face darkened, gritting his teeth as he continued, "The ancestor's son was killed before him, yet in his confusion, he ended up playing a game with that boy about holding on for the duration of an incense stick! He even lost and became a laughingstock! Funny, isn't it?!"

Kong Yu laughed bitterly, then continued softly with a pained expression, "The people we sent out lost their minds and became fools to be consumed as mere fodder by the enemy. Ultimately, even our ancestor, who was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, also fell to that boy. He desecrated our family's immortal mountain, dismantled the Kong Family, and eventually returned to the north."

"Where was Daoist Master Changxi?" Li Xuanxuan asked, his throat dry from listening to the story.

Kong Yu replied softly, "Daoist Master Changxi did eventually break through and return. However, within three years, our Kong Family was scattered and nicknamed the One Stick of Incense Clan. Terrified, Daoist Master Changxi relocated from Xu State, leading to the founding of Profound Peak Gate."

The story left Li Xuanxuan's back drenched in a cold sweat. He sighed as realization dawned upon him.

No wonder Profound Peak Gate is in its current state of decline—most of their cultivators have perished, and they have yet to recover from this incident...

Kong Yu continued with a sorrowful expression, "The disaster that befell my Kong Family is a tale of utter helplessness. I can only imagine how much despair my ancestor must have felt when faced with such calamity. This incident stirred up a sensation in Xu State, and the surviving clan members who scattered among various families were well-known."

Li Xuanxuan asked curiously, "Do you know the name of that person back then...?"

Kong Yu spread his hands and smiled wryly.

"A name? I dare not utter it."

Li Xuanxuan was momentarily at a loss. After hearing the story, he sensed that something was amiss.

"If you are so wary of offending him, why persist in publicizing this? It won't benefit your family. It might even save future generations by letting the matter be forgotten..." he commented carefully.

Li Xuanxuan thought to himself, Isn't spreading this story everywhere just sending a message to that person that the Kong Family is still resentful of what happened...?

Kong Yu gazed at him and replied, "I dare not comment, resent, or forget this matter. Even if I speak of it, I will tell the entire story—not for any other reason but to spread it far and wide, hoping to appease that person and ensure our survival."

"After all, it is a tale painstakingly crafted by that person. As long as the story is widely known, the Kong Family will stand as a monument to their efforts, and that person may be less inclined to see us perish."

"If even the villain of the story has forgotten this story, how can the audience still find it engaging?" Kong Yu added in a deep voice.

Li Family...

As the year drew to a close and snow began to fall, the day for collecting tributes approached.

Li Yuanping meticulously reviewed the records. The Li Family now governed five peaks and eighteen towns, supporting 320,000 people. With the additional 280,000 from Eastern Mount Yue, the total population reached 600,000.

This population growth was due to the efforts of the three brothers, Li Yuanxiu, Li Yuanjiao, and Li Yuanping, who had relocated people from the densely populated Lijing and Huaqian areas to the newly acquired Mount Huazhong and Yuting. Additionally, the devil plague had driven families on the eastern shore to seek refuge with the Li Family.

"600,000 people!"

The Li Family's wealth, with its five peaks, was second only to the fertile fields of Milin and far superior to the deep mountains and old forests of the Fei Family. Supporting 600,000 people was already at the limit of their capacity.

Despite having only a handful of Qi Cultivators, the Li Family boasted the largest number of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators among all the families. The establishment of the governance system overnight on the five peaks dramatically increased the number of registered Embryonic Breathing cultivators this year from nearly 200 to over 300.

Li Yuanping understood the dynamics well. Prominent families saw the financial benefits and quickly integrated their cultivators into the Li Family. Similarly, it also attracted other rogue cultivators to join.

"Money is certainly motivating!"

Li Yuanping sneered, his pale face reflecting his disdain.

The prominent families and external cultivators probably still keep more than half of their Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators to themselves, fearing that I, Li Yuanping, might cheat them!

He glanced over the lists and muttered, "Once you've registered... you'll no longer have a say!"

"Get everyone to come in!"

At his command, Dou Yi went to deliver the order.

A procession of cultivators soon entered, led by An Zheyan and Tian Zhongqing. The An and Tian families had made significant contributions, so they naturally took the lead, followed by representatives from the Chen, Xu, Ren, and other families.

Li Yuanping addressed the assembly, "The Tian Family made the greatest contribution to combating the devil plague this time. Tian Zhongqing, you will be assigned as the Peak Guardian of Mount Huaqian."

Tian Zhongqing was not surprised by Li Yuanping's decision.

Li Yuanping's administrative system had three key positions—Peak Manager, Peak Guardian, and Peak Overseer.

The Peak Overseer would be one of the direct descendants of the Li Family, responsible for overseeing the formation plate. This role did not require an exceptionally powerful member, as the main responsibility was to periodically inspect the formation plate. The rest of the time, the Peak Overseer could cultivate in peace.

The Peak Manager would be assigned to an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. Their responsibilities included overseeing taxes, general affairs, and inspections. Additionally, about ten other Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators would assist the Peak Manager. Although it was a labor-intensive role, it was not a suitable position for Tian Zhongqing.

The Peak Guardian would be a Qi Cultivator responsible for guarding and defending against demons and devils. This role required the strongest cultivator but was also the most relaxed, making it an ideal position for Tian Zhongqing, who, at forty, was in his prime for enhancing his cultivation.

"Xu Gongming will be the Peak Guardian of Mount Yuting, Xu Shumu the Peak Manager of Mount Huazhong, Xu Gongyu the Peak Manager of Mount Wutu, and Shamoli will also be stationed on Mount Wutu as the Peak Guardian..."

Li Yuanping only promoted seasoned veterans and officials who had distinguished themselves during the devil plague. Each peak is now governed by one Qi Cultivator, three various unrefined Qi Cultivators, and dozens of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators. Most of these Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators were assigned to farming and other chores rather than remaining on the mountain.

With the major positions filled, Li Yuanping skipped the rest.

The other cultivators looked at him with anticipation, only to see him lower the document in his hand and say, "There's still a shortage of cultivators. Until the peaks are adequately staffed with Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, I will promote those who have shown merit."

Li Yuanping observed their bewildered expressions and smiled as he said, "There are only limited positions at each peak. Based on cultivation and merit, each position comes with dharma artifacts, elixirs, and cave dwellings, which are burdensome for the clan to provide."

At the mention of dharma artifacts and elixirs, the eyes of the guest cultivators, prominent families, and branches grew intense. In a world where devil cultivators were rampant, venturing out could be perilous. Hence, dharma artifacts and elixirs were highly coveted.

The Li Family's resources were scarce, and the cultivators under their rule were impoverished. Although the positions at the peaks came with dharma artifacts, these were expected to be returned upon resignation. Nevertheless, many other families lacked even a single dharma artifact.

Moreover, elixirs and cave dwellings were critical for cultivation. The opportunity to improve one's abilities and extend one's lifespan is hard to resist...

Noticing the greed and ambitions in everyone's eyes, Li Yuanping nodded and dismissed the assembly.

The Snake Demon Cave Dwelling is larger than I anticipated... The direct lineage won't have to worry about having a cave dwelling to cultivate. These caves on the mountain are surplus, the dharma artifacts are simply lying around. The only costs we have to worry about are clan stipends and elixirs...

Li Yuanping sighed, reviewed a few reports, and prepared to expand the Jade Court Guards and Clan Affairs Courtyard.

"Salary increases... Spirit Paddies, Spirit Stones, and elixirs... There's a shortage of everything. The spirit resources at the bottom of Moongaze Lake are simply too scarce! It would be ideal if we could gain access to Mount Dali freely..."




# Chapter 441: Rui Family's Peak

Moongaze Lake...

In winter, Moongaze Lake took on a light blue hue, its waters clear with floating ice fragments. A streak of light cut through the air and plunged into the lake.

"Snake Demon Cave Dwelling... I wonder what it will be renamed to..."

Li Xijun performed a hand seal and cast a Water Avoidance Spell before diving into the lake and landing on the dark yellow lakebed. The Snake Demon Cave Dwelling, located on the lake's shore, had a shallow entrance and a simple formation set up by the Li Family themselves.

Upon performing another hand seal to enter the formation, he found himself in a spacious mansion. The sky above was a light blue color, and the floor and the walls around him were smooth and white.

The mansion was divided into several small courtyards, with more than a dozen cave dwellings created in the surrounding stone walls. Most of these caves were dim and empty.

In the center stood a massive icy blue column with a roughly polished surface. It supported the cave, linking the upper and lower earth veins and maintaining the spiritual qi at forty percent higher than the atmosphere outside.

The cave dweling's illumination came from this column. The Li Family identified it as Shuling Jade, a common material mainly used for crafting jade slips.

Though not particularly valuable, such a big piece of this size was certainly rare. Since it maintained the spiritual qi levels, the Li Family had no intention of mining it.

Li Xijun flew to the high platform in the center where Li Wen, who was wielding two maces, enthusiastically greeted him.

"Young Master!"

The Li Family's branch now boasted nearly ten thousand members, including many Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators who had mostly moved to the peak to work. Li Qiuyang was the only unrefined Qi Cultivator, while Li Wen was the sole Qi Cultivator who could be considered a genius.

"Already reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm at thirty-five... That's impressive."

Li Wen found little use for his skills due to the recent restructuring of the clan and had been assigned here to cultivate in peace. Ever since Li Xicheng became the clan chief, they rarely saw each other.

Only a few people remained in this cave dwelling. Li Yuanjiao was still in seclusion on Wutu, but Li Qinghong had moved here. The other two promising disciples from the minor sect—Li Chengyou and Li Chengchu—were also cultivating here.

Li Xijun visited the courtyard of the two younger disciples and offered them some guidance. As he activated his true essence, white snowlight seemed to swirl around him, giving him an ethereal appearance that filled the disciples' eyes with admiration.

"That's amazing, Eighth Uncle!" they exclaimed excitedly.

These disciples were expected to achieve the Qi Cultivation Realm and eventually become the Peak Guardians, replacing the external cultivators. As such, it was only natural for Li Xijun to invest in their development. He took out two pills, intending to gift one to each of them.

As he pondered this, a purple light suddenly illuminated one of the cave dwellings in the wall. Li Qinghong emerged and landed beside Li Xijun.

"Uncle Xuanxuan is back!" she announced softly.

————

Li Xuanxuan and Kong Yu arrived at the Li Family's territory.

Kong Yu looked around in surprise and remarked, "I heard that Moongaze Marsh was once the premier dojo in Jiangnan. However, the great battles had damaged the earth veins and depleted its spiritual energy... I never imagined it would still be so beautiful!"

Kong Yu, whose lineage was known for moving mountains, immediately assessed the landscape. He praised it enthusiastically before pointing to Mount Yuting and saying regretfully, "That mountain has been damaged before... Otherwise, it would have made an excellent immortal mountain!"

"You have a keen eye, fellow Daoist!" Li Xuanxuan exclaimed.

The Li Family had only risen to prominence less than a century ago, so it was no surprise that Li Xuanxuan was oblivious to Mount Yuting's history. The revelation was certainly eye-opening, and the two continued their conversation.

Shortly after, Li Xijun and Li Qinghong approached to greet them.

"This is the granddaughter and great-grandson of our old ancestor," Li Xuanxuan proudly introduced.

Kong Yu observed the pair for a few moments as they glided over, then remarked softly, "I can't help but be captivated by seeing both of them. They have certainly inherited the immortal grace of Li Tongya, the Celestial Moon Sword..."

This old man certainly knows how to flatter.

Li Xuanxuan chuckled inwardly.

In his opinion, Li Tongya exuded a heroic presence, while Li Xijun had a more ethereal, immortal grace, resembling Li Chejing more closely.

Li Xijun and Li Qinghong responded differently. Li Qinghong merely nodded politely, while Li Xijun offered a slight bow and said softly, "Senior possesses a majestic physique that lives up to the reputation of Profound Peak."

His voice was clear and composed.

Since Kong Yu's compliment was meant to be flattery, he could not help but look at Li Xijun again and joked, "It would be a disaster if a descendant as promising as Xijun were as mean and ungrateful as Situ Mo!"

Li Xuanxuan smiled wryly, never expecting Kong Yu to be such a petty man. He quickly shifted the conversation to the earth vein. Li Xijun flew closely behind them, listening intently.

Li Xijun's striking appearance, a divine gift he had been proud of since childhood, was something he skillfully leveraged. With just a single sentence, he had managed to elevate the Li Family's status in Kong Yu's eyes and made his elders feel proud.

Everyone in this world is shallow, Li Xijun reflected in disappointment, amused by his own tendency to exploit his advantages.

As they descended on the lake, Li Xuanxuan circled the area and asked, "Fellow Daoist, what do you think? Would it be appropriate to move the mountain here?"

Kong Yu looked around, cast a few spells, and then flew to the shore. He scooped up several handfuls of mud before returning with a smile.

"I see it now, fellow Daoist. Your family has a cave dwelling at the bottom of this lake and it's spacious... Moongaze Lake is truly an excellent location!"

Li Xuanxuan, not one to shy away from compliments, laughed and responded, "Your vein searching technique is truly remarkable, fellow Daoist. Securing this cave dwelling was no easy task for my family!"

Kong Yu nodded and continued seriously, "I've examined it closely. The earth veins here are shallow, but the water veins are abundant. We can't move a large mountain here, it would not only disrupt the spiritual qi of the cave dwelling but also cause the mountain to erode into sand and stone within a hundred years.

"Additionally, the water veins in this cave are cold and yin, which suits serpent dragons. Therefore, the mountain we move here cannot contain fire veins. You won't be able to perform alchemy or forge weapons on this mountain..."

Li Xuanxuan expected no less of Kong Yu's skill, given that the Profound Peak Gate was renowned for its expertise in moving mountains. Kong Yu meticulously outlined the potential issues and concluded, "To move a mountain here, it will likely require at least fifty Spirit Stones and twelve Qi Cultivators."

"That won't be a problem!" Li Xuanxuan said as he waved his hand. With ample manpower and resources at their disposal now, the Li Family agreed readily.

A smile broke across Li Xijun's face as he watched on from behind the group.

Uncle Yuanping's heart will probably ache soon!

"Excellent," Kong Yu replied.

Together, they surveyed the mountains near the eastern shore. It took a long time to examine each one thoroughly. Naturally, the dozen or so families on the eastern shore did not dare to interfere and allowed the inspection to proceed without protest.

By the time Kong Yu resumed his flight, dusk had settled. He reviewed the map, eliminating large mountains and those with fire veins as well as complex earth veins, and then declared, "The remaining options are all suitable. Choose whichever you prefer!"

The three of them were immediately delighted and landed on the Rui Family's mountain. Rui Qiongcuo, the head of the Rui Family, bowed and opened the formation, following respectfully behind. The two elders entered the mountain to inspect the earth vein.

Meanwhile, Li Xijun addressed Rui Qiongcuo warmly, "Apologies for the intrusion. If the Rui Family's mountain is chosen, the family head will offer your family a position on the peak with various compensations, including spirit fields and Spirit Paddies. Additionally, the children of your family will have the opportunity to study with us..."

Rui Qiongcuo nodded in agreement. Though the subsidies from the Li Family might not match the value of the immortal mountain, the chance to leave their current location and gain favor was a significant opportunity. He could only weigh the benefits in his own mind.

While Li Xijun reassured the head of the Rui Family, Li Xuanxuan, in the mountain, pointed to the spirit spring and asked Kong Yu, "This spirit spring has been affected by the Green Essence Copper and is freezing cold, it cannot be used to irrigate spirit fields. If we move this mountain, will there be another spirit spring that can nourish spirit plantations?"




# Chapter 442: Qingdu Peak

"It's definitely Green Essence Copper," Kong Yu confirmed.

"It must be nearby... Your family is really lucky to discover such rare spirit ores," he added, scooping up a bit of spring water and using a spell to analyze it.

After a few moments, he nodded in approval and said, "If we move this mountain, the shift in the earth vein will cut off the flow for about seven years. After that, the spring water will return, and the cold yin qi will be gone."

"Good!" Li Xuanxuan replied in delight with a nod.

Seven years isn't too long... the Li Family can wait!

He then continued, "This ore vein actually belongs to the Xiao Family, the immortal clan. Its production and reserves are meticulously recorded on Xianyou Peak. It has nothing to do with my Li Family..."

"That's unfortunate," Kong Yu replied with a regretful smile.

"Green Essence Copper can neutralize yang heat and enhance quality. I guess people like Daoist Master Chuting must have probably been aware of this years ago and snatched it up," he added.

Li Xijun, who had approached just in time to hear Kong Yu's remark, raised an eyebrow. Li Xuanxuan was also slightly taken aback but quickly responded, "You must be joking, fellow Daoist. The families on the eastern shore were all guided by the Xiao Family. There's no such thing as snatching... All the tributes my family collects are also reported to the Daoist Master..."

While saying that, Li Xuanxuan silently wondered, Why did he say that? Is he testing the relationship between my family and the Xiao Family?

Kong Yu was stunned by the response before smiling and saying sheepishly, "Please forgive me for speaking without thinking."

With the mountain selected, a group of cultivators from the Li Family gathered around. Kong Yu then produced twelve formation flags, handing them out to An Zheyan and the others.

He positioned each person around the lake and gave a single instruction.

"When you see the golden light, activate the formation."

Back on the shore, the Jade Court Guards had already moved the Rui Family members from the mountain. Kong Yu then retrieved a long, wide, white talisman from his robe. It was half a person's height, with something written in red ink on it.

"This is a pile of gravel, not a mountain."

At the end of the talisman was a small, bright red seal. Kong Yu explained, "This is the seal of Daoist Master Changxi, used specifically for moving mountains. It can deceive the earth vein, making the relocation process much easier."

Kong Yu stuck the talisman atop the mountain and then retrieved a handful of soft soil from his sleeve. He handed it to Li Xuanxuan while instructing, "When the earth vein begins to gush, infuse your mana into this Wuxi Sand and use it as a plug."

"If there's some leakage of Earth Vein Baleful Qi during the move, the Profound Peak Gate will handle it for your family," he added with a reassuring smile.

Li Xuanxuan took the spirit soil and replied, "Yes, please... fellow Daoist."

Kong Yu nodded and then untied the long golden rope from his waist. He carefully folded it and coiled it between his fingers, then began flying around the mountain and waving it around while chanting an incantation. Soon, the entire mountain and surrounding area was enveloped in a golden glow.

One by one, the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators of the Li Family ascended the mountain. Over a hundred of them took their positions, gripping the golden thread and sitting cross-legged, all channeling their mana into it.

Having completed the necessary preparations, Kong Yu breathed a sigh of relief and shouted, "Let's go!"

Immediately, sand and rocks were hurled into the air as a thick black mist enveloped the surroundings, and eerie wails echoed loudly as the sky darkened. Rui Family's peak, once lush with trees, trembled and vanished amidst the surging Earth Vein Baleful Qi.

"You call this some?!" Li Xuanxuan exclaimed in horror, having been caught off guard by the onslaught of black qi.

As the thick Earth Vein Baleful Qi surged forth, Li Xuanxuan hurriedly channeled his mana into the Wuxi Sand, throwing it into the chaotic scene.

"Go!" he yelled.

The spirit soil met the dark energy and expanded rapidly. Black rain began to fall, transforming the soil into mud upon contact with the ground. It rolled on the ground, gradually plugging the damaged earth vein.

Clouds of black baleful qi still lingered in the sky. Li Xuanxuan looked back to find that the Rui Family's Peak had disappeared, along with Kong Yu and the others. The landscape was now barren, revealing only gray-white rocks and soil.

"How miraculous!" Li Xuanxuan exclaimed in awe.

As he soared over the lake, he saw a new peak standing amidst it. The once verdant summit was now stripped of trees, with huts and structures reduced to rubble.

An Zheyan and the other Qi Cultivators sat cross-legged on the shore, their faces pale from exhaustion. More than a hundred Embryonic Breathing cultivators lay sprawled on the ground, their mana depleted and energy spent.

Kong Yu's face was as pale as paper, but he pushed through, not daring to pause for a second to even catch his breath. He took out a white jade bottle, soared into the sky, and used his dharma artifact to gather all the baleful qi. Once he was done, he landed with a sigh of relief.

Taking a moment to catch his breath, Kong Yu exhaled deeply and opened his eyes, then said to Li Xuanxuan, "This Earth Vein Baleful Qi belongs to the Profound Peak Gate. The remaining payment shall be sixty Spirit Stones, covering the costs for the Mountain Moving Talisman, Wuxi Sand, and labor fee... What do you think, fellow Daoist?"

I see, these people have had an ulterior motive all along!

Li Xuanxuan realized that the Profound Peak Gate's enthusiasm for relocating the mountain stemmed from their interest in harvesting the leaked baleful qi, which was likely very valuable for their alchemical techniques.

Reflecting on the baleful qi that had surged earlier, Li Xuanxuan wondered how many Spirit Stones it might be worth.

"Fellow Daoist Kong, you're quite the negotiator!" Li Xuanxuan said with a sigh, while Kong Yu responded with a shameless grin.

"The land left by the Rui Family will be barren for a hundred years. With the earth vein damaged and the spiritual energy depleted, it can only support some mortals," Kong Yu explained.

Moving mountains was extremely harmful to the earth vein and consumed vast amounts of mana. Fortunately, the lake was not far from the eastern shore, or it would have been impossible for the few Qi Cultivators to handle the relocation.

Li Xuanxuan had already expected all those consequences after seeing the baleful qi surging out from the earth vein earlier. Since this area was not his family's territory, he was not overly distressed. Nevertheless, he feigned anger and countered, "Why didn't you say so earlier? Fifty Spirit Stones!"

Kong Yu was momentarily taken aback and grumbled internally, Why the distress over this? It's not even your family's territory!

After some back-and-forth, Li Xuanxuan conceded and provided fifty-four Spirit Stones. Kong Yu accepted them with satisfaction.

Their relationship warmed considerably, and Kong Yu said with a grin, "Despite my modest cultivation, I've been moving mountains for fifty years and have mastered the craft, Brother. Based on my experience, the lake bed will naturally rise in a few years. Once the mountain's peak is raised, you'll see three or four small peaks forming around it due to the earth vein.

"Good!" Li Xuanxuan replied with a nod.

He arranged for Kong Yu to stay in the courtyard to recover. Meanwhile, the Rui Family had no place to live and was forced to stay in Yuting Town. Rui Qiongcuo remained silent, spending his days at Mount Yuting.

With no other options, Li Yuanping sent a letter to the Xiao Family, requesting that they absorb the Rui Family. The Rui Family's mining operations were naturally handed over to the Xiao Family as well.

Kong Yu stayed for several months to ensure the mountain remained stable before finally departing. As he left on the wind, he called out, "Brother Xuanxuan, if you need anything in the future, come visit me at Profound Peak Gate!"

Li Xuanxuan saw him off and then returned to the immortal mountain, which was now bustling with activity. The Li Family had cleared the fallen trees and constructed courtyards and pavilions, giving the area a lively atmosphere indeed.

Li Xijun and the others had been summoned to the mountain by Li Qinghong. Although Li Yuanjiao was still in seclusion, Li Qinghong insisted that they first decide on a name for the mountain and its cave dwelling.

After much deliberation, Li Yuanping and Li Xuanxuan proposed names like Four Lineage Peak and Li Lake Peak, but Li Qinghong was unimpressed and unsure how to respond to those names.

After further discussion, Li Xuanxuan decided on Celestial Moon Peak and Celestial Moon Cave Dwelling. He sighed and remarked, "It's a shame there's already a Moon Lake Peak in Azure Pond; otherwise, this name would have been perfect."

"I think our family should avoid names related to the moon," Li Xijun suggested.

The group exchanged thoughtful looks and agreed. Li Yuanping then proposed, "How about we combine the names of our Foundation Establishment dharma artifacts—Qingche Sword and Duruo Spear? We'll call it Qingdu Peak! The water of Moongaze Lake is always light green, and we can plant some white irises on the mountain... It'll be a perfect name!"[1]

Li Qinghong's Duruo Spear glowed faintly and she smiled.

"Finally, a good name."

"Qingdu Peak and Qingdu Cave Dwelling. From now on, this will be our family's main peak," Li Xuanxuan reaffirmed with a sense of satisfaction.

With the name settled, they received a letter from the Xiao Family. Xiao Guitu's response was swift and clear. Li Xuanxuan read it carefully and nodded in approval.

"Xiao Guitu truly handles matters efficiently," he commended.

The letter conveyed that the Rui Family, though once enlightened by the old ancestor of the Xiao Family, had no direct connection with them now. The Xiao Family would manage the mining of the Green Essence Copper themselves, so there was no need to trouble the Li Family.

"They're concerned that our family might mishandle the copper essence and create trouble," Li Yuanping said as he reviewed the letter. The Xiao Family's high regard for Green Essence Copper made him reluctant to get involved, preferring to avoid any potential issues.

One party was unwilling to concede, while the other was hesitant to intervene. This somewhat contentious situation was eventually resolved. As they were discussing the matter, the Jade Court Guards arrived with a report.

"My Lords, the monk has taken up residence on a small island nearby and built a thatched hut to cultivate."

"Kongheng? He's still around?!" Li Qinghong exclaimed as she frowned slightly. This monk, Kongheng, had appeared uninvited and had helped during the devil plague by intercepting two devil cultivators from Zhao State. His intervention had prevented significant casualties.

Since the Li Family owed him a favor, it was difficult to drive him away, so they had no choice but to allow him to stay on the lake.

"Yes, I've gathered quite a bit of information over the years. Kongheng initially wandered around Huaqian, collecting herbs and aiding people. He later moved to Yuting, and now he's here on the lake. He doesn't preach or cause any trouble, so we can't kill him... We can only send a few people to keep an eye on him," Li Yuanping said with a shrug.

————

For half a month, the lake remained tranquil. When the Dawn Cloudliner arrived as scheduled, Li Qinghong had to make the journey to submit the tributes since Li Yuanjiao was still in seclusion.

This time, the senior cultivator from Yuanwu Peak of Azure Pond, known as Yu Su and nicknamed Brocade Dark Mouse, had a reputation of greed. To avoid giving anyone cause to criticize her, Li Qinghong set off for Milin Prefecture early.

Despite numerous covert attempts by various parties, the internal strife within the Yu Family had remained unresolved. Though they appeared as a unified entity, the Yu Family had actually fractured into four distinct factions, deeply affected by the failed reforms initiated by Yu Mugao.

As a Qi Cultivator of the eighth heavenly layer, Li Qinghong flew directly over more than half of the Yu Family's territory without encountering any obstacles. It was only when she neared the Yu Family's peak, where she was to pay tribute, that a middle-aged man approached to meet her.

The man had a weathered face, a mature demeanor, and a tall stature, but his cheeks were tense, and he appeared somewhat nervous. With a spear slung over his back, he hurried over and stared at Li Qinghong in speechless surprise.

Li Qinghong, who had broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm early, now appeared to be only in her early twenties.

"Fellow Daoist, you're..."

The middle-aged man was taken aback, his face paling. After a moment of silence, he cupped his fist and greeted, "Fei Tongxiao of the Fei Family. Greetings, fellow Daoist!"

"Oh... it's you!"

Li Qinghong finally recognized him. Their last meeting had been many years ago, and reminiscing about the old times seemed rather awkward so Li Qinghong quickly shifted the topic.

Noticing the true essence around Fei Tongxiao, she frowned and asked, "Why...?"

"Oh!"

Fei Tongxiao understood that Li Qinghong was referring to the changes in his own cultivation and true essence.

Years ago, during the turmoil in the Fei Family, Fei Wangbai was beheaded by a sword, and since then, Fei Tongxiao decided not to practice the Long Brocade Heart Sutra for his foundation establishment. Unwilling to give up, he dispersed his cultivation and started anew.

With the full support of his elder brother, Fei Tongyu, Fei Tongxiao had spent over a decade reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm and had just recently broken through.

No matter how quickly he progressed, it had taken Fei Tongxiao thirty years to become a Qi Cultivator, having passed through the Embryonic Breathing Realm twice. Despite being considered a genius in his family, he found himself nearing forty before achieving this level. Beyond his deep sense of disappointment, the lines of age had begun to show on his face.

Seeing Li Qinghong, who remained as heroic, radiant, and beautiful as in her youth—clad in jade armor and wielding a spear—having already reached the eighth level of Qi Cultivation, Fei Tongxiao found it difficult to articulate the emotion he was feeling at the moment.

He had been so decisive in the past, ready to sacrifice everything and disperse his cultivation, but the consequences of his choices had left him with a pale face right now.

Nevertheless, he managed to say, "Are you here to submit the tribute too, fellow Daoist?"

Although he did not provide any explanation, Li Qinghong managed to figure it out by connecting the dots. She looked at him guiltily and replied softly, "Yes..."

The conversation fell into silence. On the peak, with only the two of them standing in the cold wind, Fei Tongxiao's face gradually calmed. After several failed attempts to speak, he finally said with a bitter smile, "Things are unpredictable. The situation changed so quickly back then that no one could have imagined..."

Li Qinghong responded softly, and as the glory of Dawn Cloudliner began to rise in the sky, more people gathered. The cultivators from various families stopped respectfully, greeting Li Qinghong as a senior before continuing on their way.

Fei Tongxiao remained pale, his head bowed, saying nothing. Although he should have addressed Li Qinghong as a senior, he simply could not bring himself to do so and remained silent.

After a while, the Dawn Cloudliner landed on the peak, and a group of cultivators descended. The leader, dressed in a brocade robe rather than his usual uniform, had a short beard, dark yellow skin, a thin face, and sparkling eyes.

He was Yu Su, the senior brother of Yuanwu Peak, also known as Brocade Dark Mouse!

Yu Su stepped off the cloudliner and glanced at the assembly, then asked softly, "Where are the Yu Family's members?"

A representative was pushed forward—Yu Chengyi, the seventh son of Yu Mugao. He dropped to his knees with a thud and exclaimed, "Greetings, immortal envoy of the upper sect!"

Yu Su glanced at him, then shook his head and said, "My junior brother has made a specific request, so I'll attend to that first before discussing anything further with you."

At the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, Yu Su was the highest-ranking cultivator anyone on the lake had seen. His brocade robe fluttered as if moved by an invisible wind, and his presence was commanding. His words left everyone in awe.

Unfamiliar with such grandeur, the assembly could only nod in agreement. Yu Su then took out a small, exquisitely crafted golden cage from his sleeve. Although bright and ornate, it was empty inside.

1. Qingche Sword literally means Green Ruler Sword while Duruo Spear means White Iris Spear. ☜




# Chapter 444: Xijun

The golden cage Yusu held was no larger than a human head, and it had seventy-two vertical bars. The small door on the front was ajar.

Placing the cage in his palms, Yu Su opened another small door on the side and then pointed at Yu Chengyi, who was prostrated on the ground.

With a sinister smile, he said, "This person has five brothers... Please help me collect their heads, fellow Daoist!"

Li Qinghong, Fei Tongxiao, and the others felt a cold breeze blowing against their faces, causing their robes to flutter. Given Yu Su's authority, none of them dared to assess that golden cage with their spiritual senses. They could only wait in tense silence.

Murmurs began spreading among the crowd.

"Could that be a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact? Such artifacts exist...?"

"Who knows? It might even be a Purple Mansion Realm dharma artifact... The Frosty Absolute Sword isn't the only artifact in the Azure Pond! The Purple Mansion Daoist Masters have been quiet for too long... Perhaps it belongs to one of them..."

As the whispers continued, a gust of wind delivered five bloody heads which fell from the sky and tumbled into a grisly heap. Li Qinghong, using her spiritual sense, detected a vortex of wind retracting into the cage, much like a whale sucking in water.

A monster? Or the effect of that dharma artifact?

Yu Su waited for a few moments before shutting the cage and frowning at the severed heads, with surprised and dismayed expressions frozen on their faces. He frowned and then said, "With this... the Yu Family should be able to consolidate their power now, right?"

Yu Chengyi stuttered, unable to form a coherent sentence. Nudged by the guest cultivator behind him, he snapped back to his senses and managed to stammer, "T-Thank... Thank you, Exalted Immortal."

Yu Su's gaze lingered on him momentarily as he remarked, "To think that Muxian has a cousin like you..."

He returned the golden cage back to his sleeve, then extended his hand and commanded, "Jade Smoke Mountain!"

His words caused the expressions of those from the Yu Family to change. Yu Chengyi, panic-stricken, took two trembling steps forward while kneeling and desperately pleaded, "Senior! The Jade Smoke Mountain is the prized treasure of my family! Please, I implore you—"

"Give it to me now!"

Impatience flashed across Yu Su's eyes. With a swing of his sleeve, he pushed Yu Chengyi and he was sent tumbling backward. Suppressing the urge to beat him to death, Yu Su snapped, "Stop wasting my time, dog! Bring that dharma artifact to me! Rather than wasting it on your household, Muxian will make far better use of it."

That's right... In the eyes of Azure Pond, these people are no different than dogs...

As soon as Yu Su spoke, sadness fell over the other families. They realized that although Yu Su appeared courteous, he regarded them as inconsequential, mere grass beneath his feet. Witnessing Yu Chengyi's tearful plight, nobody dared to speak up.

Someone from the Yu Family presented the Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, Jade Smoke Mountain. Yu Su accepted it and lifted it high up, scrutinizing the artifact for a few moments.

The Jade Smoke Mountain was snow-white and translucent, about the size of a fist, and exquisitely carved. The various cranes and trees on it were impeccably detailed, bringing them vividly to life. However, a shallow line on the mountainside emitted a faint green light.

Yu Su frowned as he observed this, murmuring to himself, "It really left a mark... Li Tongya was truly formidable. This thing is made of Supreme Radiant Profound Jade..."

After looking at it for a while, he lifted his head and said bluntly, "All matters are settled. Bring forward the tributes, everyone."

The families nodded, quickly bringing their tributes. Yu Su stood by as his attendants sorted through the tributes, dismissing inadequate ones and demanding replacements.

It was well known around Moongaze Lake that Yu Su was opportunistic, exploiting others for gain. The families complied in silence. After inspecting the tributes, Yu Su gently swayed the golden cage in his hand and advised, "If there are no significant changes in the future, I will return here again in due time. Be better prepared next time, so no adjustments will be necessary."

With that, his disciples lifted into the air, boarding the Dawn Cloudliner. Yu Su, standing at the bow, surveyed the crowd below once more before the ship eventually vanished into the horizon.

The mood among the families soured immediately after Yu Su's departure. Although a few prestigious clans managed better, most faces were marked by discontent.

As the Dawn Cloudliner left, families along the eastern shore who had allied with the Li Family gathered to plead for leniency and share their grievances.

"Senior! Please consider a lighter tribute this year!"
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝐰𝚎𝕓𝐧𝚘𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝕞

The head of the Pu Family, over eighty but still in the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, wore plain clothes and lacked even a basic dharma artifact. He respectfully addressed Li Qinghong, his face etched with a troubled expression.

"Senior, the peaks of the Azure Pond rotate their residency every seventy years, and we're only halfway through... Over thirty more years of hardship await. What are we to do?"

His land, affected by Green Essence Copper, scarcely supported the growth of Spirit Paddies. While the Rui Family had found relief by pledging loyalty to the Li Family, the remaining four families remained deeply troubled, as they were among the poorest on the eastern shore.

He looked to Li Qinghong with earnest hope for a favorable word.

Rui Qiongcuo, standing behind Li Qinghong respectfully, could not help but secretly rejoice at the misfortune of their former competitors.

Although his Rui Family was independent on the surface, they were technically under the Li Family. Yet, they lived comfortably. To him, the modest tribute from the Embryonic Breathing Realm family was a trifle.

The clamor of voices grew until Li Qinghong, forced to assert control, slammed her spear onto the ground.

The clang silenced them instantly.

Knowing Yu Su's greed, Li Qinghong had wisely left her Duruo Spear at home, carrying only a low-grade Qi Cultivation dharma artifact with her today. Yet, even this was enough to shatter the stone bricks on the ground.

"If you face financial difficulties, please consult with my family head directly. The Li Family does not intend to ruin anyone merely for tributes... We have our ways to address such matters," she stated firmly.

With Li Yuanping at home to handle these issues, Li Qinghong was free to depart without concern, confident that the matters would be resolved appropriately.

————

The forest path near Lijing Town was shrouded in darkness, yet it buzzed with activity as several figures in white armor galloped past. Leading them was Li Xicheng, astride a spirit horse.

Li Xicheng rode along the dark path near Lijing Town, illuminated by fireflies that floated silently beneath the leaves of the trees around them.

Zhongsuo, his loyal companion, galloped on without a word. Li Xicheng, now head of the Jade Court Guards, had to maintain a cautious distance from his brothers to avoid any suspicions.

Trailing close behind him was Chen Mufeng, the highest-ranking guard in the Jade Court Guards. His talent rivaled that of Chen Donghe, but his slightly superior cultivation technique used during the Embryonic Breathing phase had allowed him to advance faster, achieving the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm—a rank mirroring Li Xicheng's own.

Though Li Xicheng was the eldest by about ten years, he was considered the least talented among his siblings. Nevertheless, he managed to attain the Qi Cultivation Realm at thirty, thanks to a Grade Three technique he practiced during the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

Under the cover of night, one man rode on horseback while the other rode along the wind. Li Xicheng held a jade slip and spoke softly, "During this patrol inspection, two individuals in Huaqian were caught hiding Spirit Paddies... They've been arrested as per the rules. What did the Clan Affairs Courtyard say?"

Chen Mufeng, a man around his age and deeply trusted, responded, "They have been brought to justice, but... one of them belongs to a minor sect of the second lineage... The eldest son, Li Chengchu, is practicing at Qingdu's main peak. This..."

Li Xicheng shook his head, replying softly, "It doesn't matter... Everything should follow the rules. The family head will decide their fate. Likely, he'll impose a severe or minor punishment and reassign him to a less critical role."

Chen Mufeng nodded as they continued along the river. Observing the verdant growth around them, Li Xicheng smiled and remarked softly, "Mufeng, our family is flourishing, with all lineages united. The external cultivators and those in the minor sects are emerging like bamboo shoots after rain. It's a golden era for us; truly a cause for celebration!"

Chen Mufeng smiled in agreement, replying, "The main family is the clouds in heaven, and we are the vines on earth. We're a single entity. Naturally, hearing this brings joy to my heart!"

Switching the jade slip to his other hand, Li Xicheng suggested warmly, "I have a concubine-born sister, Yunying, who isn't married yet. She's quite the catch for any promising Qi Cultivator. Are you interested in taking her as your wife? Perhaps I can arrange a meeting between you two soon. If you fancy her, it could be a wonderful union between our families, don't you think?"

Chen Mufeng was immediately overjoyed. He had remained unmarried since his wife's passing precisely for an opportunity like this! Now that he was finally given the chance to become part of the Li Family's second lineage, he nodded enthusiastically and happily replied, "Thank you, my lord!"

The two conversed for a while longer. Chen Mufeng, now working under Li Xicheng, felt a newfound closeness to him. His speech grew more relaxed as he leaned in and whispered, "Mufeng has been serving you for many years, yet a doubt still lingers in my heart."

"Speak," Li Xicheng encouraged, nodding slightly.

"My lord..." Chen Mufeng began, but just then, a cold wind descended from the sky, cutting him off mid-sentence.

A young man in white, with a sword at his waist and sharp eyes, rode the wind toward them. His gaze briefly met Chen Mufeng's before settling on Li Xicheng.

"Brother!"

"Brother Jun! Come, come..." Li Xicheng greeted as he warmly grasped his younger brother's hand, pushing Chen Mufeng's words to the back of his mind.

Li Xijun chuckled and suggested, "This is not the place to talk. Brother, why don't we ascend the mountain?"

"Of course!"

Together, they soared upward and landed in the small courtyard on Mount Qingdu.

Li Xijun pushed the door open and entered. With a wave of his sleeve, the room lit up instantly. He fetched two pots of wine and placed them on the table, then filled the cups.

He then said, "Brother, you're quite the figure these days... I've heard the Jade Court Guards are more efficient than the Clan Affairs Courtyard in overseeing the six peaks!"

"Nothing like that..." Li Xicheng chuckled, humbly dismissing the flattery.

Li Xijun chuckled as well and continued, "I've also heard that the impoverished families and branches you've assisted have reformed admirably. They've joined the peaks and even the Clan Affairs Courtyard and Jade Court Guards. Everyone speaks highly of you."

"You're exaggerating!"

Though the tale was well-regarded within the clan and Li Xicheng privately took pride in his foresight, he quickly adopted a modest tone in response to his brother's words.

Li Xijun waved his hand and added, "Our second lineage has nurtured many talents who now hold significant positions across various peaks... Having spent years in seclusion on the mountain, I rarely manage family matters. These successes are undoubtedly linked to your diligent training and leadership..."

Li Xicheng's frown deepened as he took a sip of the wine handed to him by Li Xijun. A realization dawned on him, prompting him to say in a stern voice, "I have never shown the slightest favoritism! These people have earned their positions through talent and hard work. If you, Brother Jun, suspect me of such, it severely underestimates me!"

"Brother, there's nothing wrong with what you've done."

Li Xijun, seemingly anticipating this response, shook his head. "If I believed otherwise, I wouldn't be so respectful towards you," he said with a comforting warm smile.

He raised his eyebrow as he continued in a cooler tone, "You can promote talent, forge alliances through marriage, influence the Yuting and two courtyards, and cultivate confidants among the peaks..."

Pausing, Li Xijun fixed his gaze on his brother.

"However, these are not actions befitting the eldest son of the second lineage... nor what Brother Ximing should be doing."

He set down his jade cup and squinted at his older brother.

"Big Brother, do you realize what you're doing? You're building your own support base and calming the masses. You're proving you're more capable than Brother Ming... forcing the family head to reconsider Ximing's leadership..."

At this, Li Xicheng's usually gentle face grew serious as he replied slowly, "There's no such thing as forcing. If any, it is the family forcing Ming'er, who clearly has no interest in these matters. You're misinterpreting my intentions... I'm merely acting in the family's best interest."

"The succession issue isn't settled yet!"

Li Xijun's expression tightened, his voice lowering, "Ximing can still father children! Even if he lacks the desire, his offspring could lead!"

Li Xicheng sighed gently, asking softly, "What do you think then, Brother Jun?"

This question left Li Xijun speechless. Torn between a brother stripped of power by his own action and an elder brother poised to reveal his ambitions, Li Xijun closed his eyes, unable to respond.

The elders in the family are probably allowing the situation to turn into this...

Unable to think of something better to say, Li Xijun then spoke in a subdued tone.

"I too bear responsibility for Ximing's plight... Since he was confined, the entire second lineage has been pushing you to act. Pressured by so many people, I guess you have no other choices either... I have no right to criticize you, Big Brother."

Li Xicheng nodded thoughtfully as Li Xijun's stern expression softened, and he continued, "However, those you have promoted, many have risen only through your favor and by leveraging your prestige, gaining support across second lineage... You must be cautious in how you utilize them."

"I understand," Li Xicheng acknowledged, prompting Li Xijun to cup his fist respectfully and say gently, "From now on, we two brothers will lead the generation of Xi and Yue. I trust you will act with prudence."

With a decisive sweep of his sleeves, he turned to leave. His white robe fluttered as he approached the door. Li Xicheng watched his tall figure, murmuring words barely audible, "Why didn't you ask if Uncle Yuanjiao has instructed me to do these things, Brother Jun?"

Li Xijun paused briefly, then took to the wind.

Li Qinghong emerged from three years of seclusion on Qingdu Peak after having spent some time stabilizing her powers at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation. Preparing to take a pill on either the first or last day of the month to break through to the ninth heavenly layer, she never expected Li Yuanping's sudden arrival.

Li Yuanping reported strange phenomena at Mount Wutu—surging clouds above the cave dwelling, faint sounds of dripping water within, and clear water bursting forth from the ground.

Even the weather at Mount Yue had grown erratic, with downpours ending as abruptly as they had begun, leaving the skies clear and the local fauna, including fish and turtles, scrambling ashore.

The Li Family had been through Li Tongya's breakthrough previously. When Li Qinghong heard these accounts, she realized that her brother, Li Yuanjiao, was nearing a critical breakthrough in his foundation establishment.

"Geez... Breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm is a life-and-death trial... How can he attempt it without telling me first?" she grumbled.

Although annoyed, Li Qinghong flew to Mount Wutu hurriedly and took up a vigilant watch outside the cave dwelling.




# Chapter 446: Li Fire Spear

Li Qinghong had just arrived at the courtyard when she noticed a female cultivator standing quietly there, holding the hand of a little girl. Her face was veiled with spirit gauze. Upon seeing Li Qinghong, she greeted him with a warm smile.

"You're here, Qinghong!"

The woman, Xiao Guiluan, appeared to be in her twenties despite her actual age being over forty. It was no surprise as the Xiao Family was an immortal clan and she was at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

"Hello, Sister-In-Law," Li Qinghong replied with a gentle nod as a smile involuntarily appeared on her face. The generations of Yuan and Qing were all very close to each other. Xiao Guiluan, both tactful and capable, had always maintained a harmonious relationship with her in-laws.

The little girl, Li Yuexiang, was Li Yuanjiao's youngest daughter. She affectionately hugged Li Qinghong and called her auntie sweetly.

"Have you been studying well, Yuexiang?" Li Qinghong asked gently.

Xiao Guiluan turned to Li Qinghong with a smile and asked, "You've reached the eighth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm at just forty-two or forty-three, right?"

"That's correct," she responded with a nod.

"You might establish your foundation by fifty then... you truly are a prodigy," Xiao Guiluan praised.

The later stages of Qi Cultivation demanded substantial time, often at least five years. Unfamiliar with talisman pills, Xiao Guiluan estimated that Li Qinghong would reach the Foundation Establishment by fifty. However, Li Qinghong herself believed that she could achieve it by forty-five.

The women conversed for a bit before Li Qinghong frowned and said, "I don't understand why my brother went into seclusion without saying a word... It's unlike him."

Xiao Guiluan shook her head and began, "In the Xiao Family history, out of 376 Qi Cultivators breaking through to Foundation Establishment, 170 did so abruptly, without prior notice. When one's spiritual energy is ripe, unless suppressed by secret techniques from immortal sects, it's often best to break through immediately."

Li Qinghong furrowed her brow, prompting further explanation from Xiao Guiluan.

"Our elders are baffled too. After years of investigation, they learned of a rumor circulating among the three sects that may be tied to the activity of Metallic Essence. Within the same Dao lineage, it's common for several members to establish the same immortal foundation within a few years. Yet, curiously, after some more years, several among them may fail..."

Li Qinghong nodded gently, her keen intellect evident as her eyes lit up. She then spoke thoughtfully, "Mastering the activities of Metallic Essence could significantly enhance the chances of our disciples' breakthroughs. If one could cultivate Metallic Essence effectively then that means..."

They could control the Dao lineage at will? To determine who achieves breakthrough...

She suddenly fell silent and looked at Xiao Guiluan, only to notice a subtle shift in her expression. The two exchanged a silent, knowing look.

No wonder the prestigious clans of the Xu State were decimated by a reincarnated being... Just the sight of a hint of Metallic Essence instills terror in anyone...

The two stood quietly in the courtyard, listening to the soft flowing sound of spring water flowing nearby. Xiao Guiluan continued in a gentle voice, "Those are probably just false rumors... In the ancient texts, no sect within the first three hundred years has mentioned any Dao lineage that could control foundation establishment."

Looking at the shimmering water ripples in the cave dwelling while engaging in their speculative conversation, they were startled by a sudden loud explosion.

BOOM!

The sky outside the courtyard burst into a brilliant display, with clouds turning a radiant gold. Streams of light danced through the air as numerous mana lights streaked across the sky. Li Qinghong looked up and swiftly ascended, riding the wind upward.

The golden lights in the sky merged into the distant red hues of sunset and the brilliance in the east shone intensely for several moments before gradually fading away.

More mana lights appeared, belonging to cultivators of various sizes and colors, all converging toward the east.

Li Qinghong hovered and observed for a moment before a cultivator in the early stages of the Qi Cultivation Realm approached. Li Qinghong stopped him with her spear raised, prompting a look of annoyance from the man. However, upon recognizing her advanced cultivation realm at the eighth heavenly layer, he quickly softened his tone.

"What assistance may I offer, fairy?" he asked.

"If I may inquire, fellow Daoist... What is happening in the east?" Li Qinghong asked.

The cultivator, impatient yet respectful, responded swiftly, "Senior must have been in seclusion for a long while. This spectacle marks the collapse of a grotto heaven, likely the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven in Yufu Prefecture that has been the recent talks. If you're heading there, perhaps you could bring me along."

"Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven?" Li Qinghong pondered aloud.

Li Xuanxuan often relayed the news from Kong Yu to everyone in the family. When Li Qinghong learned that the disturbance originated from Yufu Prefecture, she shook her head slightly and quickly made up an excuse.

"This sounds too good to be true! The three sects and seven gates have probably claimed everything... As long as the grotto heaven's forbidden mechanisms remain intact, we are just pawns being used as scouts."

The rogue cultivator shook his head and replied, "You must be joking, Senior! How could we simply enter the grotto heaven? The spiritual energy released upon its fall scattered various essences like spiritual qi, spirit water, and spirit fire across Mount Dongli. There's plenty to go around for those who simply wish to gather spirit materials and depart."

Li Qinghong frowned slightly but allowed him to pass. Xiao Guiluan caught up and gazed toward the east, then explained, "It must be Chu Yi, the Li Fire Spear, who opened the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven... That incident had indeed caused quite a stir. Judging by the date, this was expected."

Puzzled, Li Qinghong asked, "Where did this Li Fire Spear come from? I've never heard of this Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator."

For someone like Li Qinghong who had a passion for spears, it seemed improbable that she would be unaware of a notable spear-wielding Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

Xiao Guiluan explained, "You may not know, Qinghong, but this person only rose to fame recently. He received the legacy of the Dongli Sect at a young age and achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm by thirty-one and is considered a top-tier genius."

"Chu Yi was originally a rogue cultivator from Yufu Prefecture. After his legacy was exposed, he was framed by the Han Family of the local clans. Within just a few years, he achieved a breakthrough and eliminated two Foundation Establishment Realm ancestors in Jiangnan. His reputation has resonated throughout the region, earning him the nickname Li Fire Spear."

She paused briefly before adding, "Now, all of Jiangnan is aware that he has the legacy of Dongli Sect... It's also widely rumored that he will soon enter the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven."

After absorbing this information, Li Qinghong mused internally, Such a genius! He must be a True Monarch...

As she contemplated this, an elderly man with a wrinkled face and white hair ascended hastily. His expression was anxious as he called out, "Hong'er, you must not go!"

Li Qinghong flew toward him and smiled reassuringly.

"Uncle, you worry too much! Qinghong is not one to be blinded by greed," she replied.

Xiao Guiluan also approached, respectfully greeting the man.

"Father!"

Li Xuanxuan sighed softly and said, "Indeed, you are not one to act rashly, but you'll never know if any divine ability is at play. I fear you might be led astray, just like Yu Yufeng was."

With concern on his face, he continued, "The moment I heard Chu Yi is Li Fire Spear, I was shocked. Despite all the news we've received, we never dared to interrupt your seclusion..."

The three then descended and seated themselves in the courtyard. Xiao Guiluan brought Li Yuexiang away as Li Xuanxuan continued speaking.

"As Guiluan mentioned, this Wander Fire Spear, Chu Yi, is likely the True Monarch awaited by the Azure Pond Sect. The Han Family's actions are merely a repeat of what the Kong Family faced."

"Outside of the three sects, seven gates, and a few immortal clans, most other families remain in the dark, clueless about the current state of affairs..." he added after a brief pause.

Li Qinghong stared at the mana light streaking across the sky, shaking her head skeptically.

"You're saying those are disciples from the three sects and seven gates that are heading there? Those lights seem enhanced by their escape spells... I don't think there are so many clans practicing escape spells..."

Li Xuanxuan paused when she said this, observing intently. Realizing that Li Qinghong was right, he grew puzzled too.
𝒇𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝙚𝒃𝒏𝓸𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝒎

"But Kong Yu didn't look like he was lying," he said with a frown.

Li Qinghong reflected a moment before saying, "Kong Yu mentioned that disciples from the three sects and seven gates were barred from entering for three years... Now, those three years have elapsed."

Li Xuanxuan exhaled, grasping the unspoken implications, and responded, "You mean... Chu Yi is most dangerous before completing his foundation establishment...? Once he completes it and opens the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven, things will stabilize...?"

Li Qinghong nodded slowly, adding softly, "I've considered Kong Yu's story. I find it hard to believe that this reincarnation is merely the Golden Core True Monarch's amusement... Just consider the Daoist Masters of Jiangnan—all of them are insightful and cunning. Do you think the Golden Core True Monarch, above the Purple Mansion Realm, would truly descend to the mortal world for amusement? Isn't such a reincarnated form inherently fragile?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded thoughtfully as Li Qinghong continued, "From a Qi Cultivator's perspective, things may appear one way, but from the vantage of the Purple Mansion or even the Golden Core Realm, it's entirely different..."
𝘧𝓇ℯ𝑒𝓌𝑒𝑏𝓃𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝒸ℴ𝓂

"Although there are Purple Mansion Realm immortals, none established sects. Why was the Kong Family destroyed overnight, allowing Daoist Master Changxi to swiftly establish the Profound Peak Gate and secure a position in Yue State?" she added.

Chills ran down Li Xuanxuan's spine as he stammered, "Could it be Changxi... T-That's..."

Li Qinghong replied softly, "This situation is a disgrace in the eyes of the Kong Family... How do you know if it isn't Daoist Master Changxi's maneuvering?!"

Li Xuanxuan broke out in a cold sweat but urged, "Carry on..."

Li Qinghong hummed in response and continued softly, "I suspect that although the meteoric rise of the Li Fire Spear is portrayed as the True Monarch's reincarnation among the mortals, he's actually orchestrating something beneath the surface. The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven likely serves as the reward he promised to the three sects... Meanwhile, the seven gates are merely kept informed, privy to the knowledge but not the power."

Li Xuanxuan nodded in realization and sighed.

"As for the rogue cultivators, they only see the surface, believing it to be Chu Yi's genius ascent... Had Kong Yu not informed me, my family would also remain oblivious..."

After piecing together their thoughts, Li Qinghong pursed her lips and added, "As for why Kong Yu confided in you, uncle... it seems he was extending an olive branch to our family. The Kong Family of Profound Peak Gate clearly harbors favorable intentions toward us."

Li Xuanxuan hesitated before whispering, "But still... Is there any way for our Li Family to profit from this?"

————

Meanwhile at the Azure Pond Sect...

The bamboo forest on Qingsui Peak swayed gently in the breeze. Standing amidst it, Li Xizhi's true essence radiated a faint purple-red glow, casting its hue on the bamboo shoots around him.

He practiced the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique, a Grade Four technique including six spells and three secret arts, ranging from the intricate footwork of Dawn Imperial Movement to the powerful spell Gold In Cloud, along with other escape spells and various techniques.

Although it had only been two years since Li Xizhi broke through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, he was already capable of beating three or four early-stage rogue Qi Cultivators single-handedly.

"So, this is the foundation of the three sects..."

Chuckling to himself, he re-read a letter from home.

"My family is prospering this year; they've even moved a mountain and named it Qingdu Peak. Surely, it wasn't Father who chose the name! I wonder when I'll be able to return to see it..."

As he mused on, a voice from the forest interrupted his thoughts.

"Senior Brother!"

Turning around, Li Xizhi saw a young lady dressed in black looking at him. She appeared to be seventeen or eighteen years old, with a warm smile on her delicate face. Li Xizhi cupped his fist and greeted her.

"Junior Sister Yang..."

This was Yang Xiao'er, a match made by Yuan Tuan from the Yang Family for Li Xizhi. With Imperial Cloud Peak's master, Yang Tianya, in seclusion, their planned meeting never materialized. In the end, she was sent over.

Her talents were modest and her looks were ordinary. She was usually quiet, but during the few times they met, she spoke warmly and adorably. As Li Xizhi often secluded himself for cultivation, they did not get to spend much time with each other.

Li Xizhi's response was tinged with unfamiliarity, but Yang Xiao'er seemed unperturbed. She continued smiling and said, "Senior Brother often cultivates in seclusion... It's rare for Xiao'er to see you."

Li Xizhi nodded slightly in agreement.

Yang Xiao'er stepped closer, saying, "Recently, there have been disturbances outside the sect. Have you heard about the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven?"

Li Xizhi's eyebrows rose in surprise the moment he heard this.

"Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven? Well, I've heard a little about it. There's talk of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator named Chu Yi the Li Fire Spear... Is this real?"

Yang Xiao'er nodded gently and replied, "Chu Yi must be a truly remarkable genius to be able to turn Yufu upside down as a rogue cultivator! My father warned that this man is quite unusual and should not be provoked, suggesting he must carry a special fate on him."

Li Xizhi nodded as he thought about writing home to his family about this matter.

Yang Xiao'er continued, "When the immortal gates of Wei State fled south, one of them established the Dongli Sect. The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven is well-known, and its recent appearance has alarmed the cultivators of Wu and Yue States. The three sects and seven gates have already secured the grotto heaven, poised to break through its formations and enter... Yet, Chu Yi has already accessed it using secret techniques..."

As Li Xizhi sat quietly on the rock, listening to Yang Xiao'er's stream of news when she suddenly paused and asked, "I wonder how many of us from Qingsui Peak are here?"

After a brief calculation, Li Xizhi replied, "Probably just you and me."

"I see..." Yang Xiaoer said as she nodded, her expression turning resolute as she gazed directly at him.

Though not particularly striking, Yang Xiaoer had made an effort with her appearance, managing to look quite pretty. She raised her eyebrows and spoke with a hint of nervousness, "Senior brother, being from the sword immortal clans, you are handsome and talented. Xiao'er fears she isn't a suitable match for him. Although I've considered it... I don't wish to waste time."

Taken aback, Li Xizhi listened as she continued softly, "Xiao'er has been on this peak for two years... Senior Brother has never truly seen me... My talents are modest and my looks are plain. If Senior Brother is interested, I will dedicate my life to supporting him. If not, I will ask my father to annul our marriage."

Li Xizhi, surprised by her frankness, stared at her in silence before responding in a serious tone, "Xizhi is not such a person. Since we have shared our wedding wine, we are bound as husband and wife for life, with no second thoughts. The past two years were solely to strengthen our cultivation..."

He smiled shyly and added, "Moreover, I feared you might think... I was too frivolous."

Yang Xiao'er had braced herself for a range of reactions, but she had not anticipated such a response. Stunned for a moment by his sincerity, she stepped forward and kissed him on the cheek.

Without hesitation, she pulled a white dharma robe with black patterns from her storage pouch and offered it to him.

"This is the robe I requested from my clan. It can protect my life in critical moments. Please accept it, Senior Brother..."

Li Xizhi's face was tinged red and before he could recover from the surprise, a snowy white robe was presented to him.

"How could I possibly accept such a lavish gift... and this is a mid-quality Qi Cultivation Realm feather robe?!"

Feather armors were rare treasures. The Li Family possessed only one piece of Embryonic Breathing Realm jade armor, which was long since bestowed upon Li Qinghong as a treasured heirloom.

Now, holding such a precious dharma robe, Li Xizhi felt as if he was clutching a fortune in Spirit Stones.

This is worth two hundred Spirit Stones! No... possibly three hundred?

Yang Xiao'er gently pushed the robe into his hands and said with a smile, "This was part of my dowry from my father..."

"You..."

Li Xizhi looked into her eyes, which sparkled with joy, yet he felt a pang of melancholy.

She's so innocent and genuinely devoted to me...




# Chapter 448: Serpent Dragon's Water Wisdom

"Can my family benefit from this?" Li Xuanxuan asked, his heart pounding with anticipation. He was wary of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' schemes but also intrigued by the potential gains.

"The Dongli Sect was once a prominent immortal sect. Putting aside the treasures inside the grotto heaven, even the spirit water, spirit fire, and spiritual qi outside it are all exceedingly rare," he remarked softly.

"Could we send a few guest or external cultivators to the area around the cave to compete with the rogue cultivators? If we manage to obtain one or two of the treasures, it would greatly benefit our family's future development!"

Li Qinghong, listening to his proposal, raised an eyebrow.

"It's difficult to say. If you really want to involve our family, whether you send guest or external cultivators, it's essentially the same as sending our direct descendants," she replied.

She continued, "Moreover, these guest or external cultivators who acquire some spirit water or spirit fire won't simply hand it over. They'd more likely escape with it..."

Li Xuanxuan was at a loss for words until Li Qinghong added, "Of course, we shouldn't risk our family members' lives. Even though Chu Yi has entered the grotto heaven, who can guarantee the rest could leave safely after harvesting the resources outside? They might be dead upon reaching Mount Dongli... The rogue cultivators don't have much to lose; they're simply looking for a chance. But...our family is a different story."

After a few moments of thought, Li Qinghong spoke softly, "While our family can't afford to risk entering Mount Dongli, there are plenty who are willing to take the risk. If hawks can't risk it, perhaps we can benefit from the sparrows."

She pulled out a map from her storage pouch and pointed to Mount Dongli.

"Mount Dongli is located on the border of Yufu, surrounded by large prefectures to the northwest. Fleeing there would be unwise. If the rogue cultivators find the treasure and leave the mountain, they will likely head east, not northwest.

"East is the best direction to flee, toward the loosely controlled territory of the Purple Smoke Gate. Given that the Purple Smoke Gate is weak and preoccupied with dividing the treasure in the grotto heaven, their territory is sparsely guarded due to a shortage of manpower..."

Li Qinghong concluded confidently, "If I were a rogue cultivator with the treasure, I would definitely flee east, leave the Purple Smoke territory, and travel along the edge of Shanji Prefecture. I'd hide my identity in the Eastern Sea and establish a Dao lineage..."

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and fell silent for a moment before whispering, "Are you suggesting we ambush them in the territory of the Purple Smoke Gate?"

"No," Li Qinghong replied with an excited smile, "It's better to position ourselves at the mouth of the river. The Purple Smoke Gate is too close to Mount Dongli, it's too dangerous there. I'll use the mirror to scout the river. With its ability to see thousands of miles away, no Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator will be able to catch me, and no Qi Cultivator will be able to defeat me."

"Right now, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' attention is focused on Mount Dongli. The entrance to the sea is winding and difficult under the rule of the Yue Cultivating Sect. We can wait nearby. If we're lucky, we'll profit. If not, it's no great loss—just a matter of waiting for a few days."

The plan seemed reasonable to Li Xuanxuan, but his advanced age and frailty had drained his courage, worn thin by past trials. He tried to speak but remained silent.

Understanding his hesitation, Li Qinghong pursed her lips and refrained from speaking further.

Uncle Xuanxuan is quite old and has faced death several times. He must be weary and likely has little desire for further risks...

Li Qinghong thought for a moment before Li Xuanxuan finally spoke.

"Jiao'er is in seclusion, and his fate is uncertain. If something were to happen, it could spell disaster for the family. Moreover, it may not be wise to use our family's resources for such a distant venture."

"Alright, I will heed your advice," Li Qinghong replied, smiling with disappointment.

"But there's no rush. I've heard that the grotto heaven hasn't been opened yet. Many are still waiting..." she added while cupping her fist. Just as she was about to withdraw, the calm surface of the courtyard's clear water suddenly rippled. A wind swept in, dispersing the dark clouds overhead.

Rumble!

A muffled sound resonated from the clear sky, and the sky darkened abruptly. The water in the courtyard leaped up from the ground, disappearing into the cracks and fissures.

"Brother! Big Brother has made a breakthrough!"

Li Qinghong was momentarily stunned as the cave's stone door swung open with a gust of strong wind, stirring up a grayish-green water mist. Li Xuanxuan stood up with excitement and moved forward a few steps.

Indeed, a young man in black emerged from the gray mist, carrying a sword on his back. He stepped forward with a beaming smile, his face radiant with joy.

"I have formed the Boundless Ocean!"

Li Yuanjiao's voice was unusually cheerful. The emotions he had suppressed for years finally surfaced, and he felt a surge of confidence this time.

Looking at his father and younger cousin in the courtyard, he smiled and announced, "I have established the immortal foundation and am now a cultivator in the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

Li Xuanxuan laughed heartily. He stepped forward and said with genuine happiness, "Of course, I knew it was only a matter of time before Jiao'er established his foundation! With this new strength, there are many things we can now attempt that we previously avoided!"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head slightly, his face showing a hint of relief. Reflecting on the trials he had faced during his seclusion, a cold sweat broke out on his back. He replied, "Father, you speak lightly, but it wasn't easy. I narrowly escaped death... If not for my good fortune and youth, I might not have survived this life-or-death ordeal."

Li Xuanxuan had seen several elders establish their foundation relatively easily and assumed that Li Yuanjiao's success was assured. He had not expected his son to look as though he had survived a great trial.

He responded, puzzled, "How could it be so difficult? If even you faced such challenges, how many in the family could hope to establish their foundation?"

"Not many," Li Yuanjiao replied as he continued, "Father, never underestimate the difficulty of establishing a foundation... Just look at how many from the Fei and Yu families died trying to achieve it."

Li Qinghong, who had been listening, appeared unfazed. She smiled at her brother and asked, "How does it feel, Brother? How different are you from my grandfather back then?"

Li Yuanjiao's smile faded, and he became serious.

"That's exactly what I'm wondering..."

With that, he slowly extended his hand. His black robe fluttered gently in the wind as the immortal foundation within him began to resonate and the sound of a rushing waterfall filled the air.

Splash!

The gray spring water surged from between the floor tiles and rock crevices. It spiraled around the feet of the three, wrapping around Li Yuanjiao's robe. The water swiftly transformed into a serpent dragon that bared its fangs and claws, its scales clearly defined as it coiled beside him.

Li Yuanjiao murmured, "The immortal foundation I formed doesn't possess the ability to condense talisman water, but I've acquired another ability known as Serpent Dragon's Water Wisdom...

He continued, his expression unusual, "This ability allows me to communicate with water beasts, befriend underwater monsters, control clouds, and rain, and activate water veins..."

Li Qinghong was momentarily stunned as a word suddenly popped into her mind. She exclaimed suddenly, "Jing Dragon King?!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded approvingly and replied in a deep voice, "I agree. Jing Dragon King seems to fit better than Boundless Ocean. However, everyone knows that this is just another name for this immortal foundation... Jing Dragon King is the ancient name for Boundless Ocean..."

He then furrowed his brow and voiced his main concern.

"I've also compared it with Grand Uncle's description from back then. After condensing Boundless Ocean, I don't feel the improvements he had described. The recovery speed of my true essence and the qi is only half of what my granduncle's was..."

Li Tongya's impressive suppression power wasn't solely due to the Law of Celestial Moon but also his extraordinary recovery speed of his true essence.

Even the fact that he could take Huashang Fruit, the treasured panacea

without dying, was due to the profound power of Boundless Ocean...

With his different ability and effect compared to Li Tongya, Li Yuanjiao's excitement waned. After a moment of contemplation, he sighed.

"Perhaps this is Jing Dragon King after all... It is different from the Boundless Ocean."

"Could it be due to the pill..?" Li Qinghong asked softly, and the three fell into silence.

Seeing Li Yuanjiao emerge from his seclusion, Li Qinghong felt renewed confidence in her plan. She outlined the changes within the family, shared the previous plan with a smile, and then asked, "What do you think, Brother?"

Li Yuanjiao nodded and responded softly, "The plan is feasible, but divine abilities are mysteriously strange... How can we determine if one's action is under the influence of one or if it comes from the heart?"

Li Qinghong hesitated for a moment before answering with uncertainty.

"With the talisman seed we have... we should not be affected..."

"Not necessarily," Li Yuanjiao countered thoughtfully.

"In my opinion, the talisman seed can resist divine ability but only if it's triggered through divine ability itself. If it's triggered by fate, it might be unstoppable. If this weren't the case, why did Granduncle always say that he was led by a divine ability? Why did Uncle Xuanling inexplicably wish to go to Mount Luoxia? It must be related to fate!"

Li Yuanjiao, having broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, now saw many things with a new perspective. Mysteries that had eluded him before became clear now in his mind.

Li Qinghong frowned and asked, "If fate controls everything, how can anyone dare to act in this world?"

"I know right... If the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators truly wielded such formidable divine abilities, the Xiao Family wouldn't have been able to exist. My family has suffered twice at their hands, making it hard not to be apprehensive."

Li Qinghong glanced at both men and gritted her teeth.

"Anyone who can't become a Purple Mansion Realm is destined to be an ant in the grand scheme of things!"

Li Xuanxuan sighed, his face growing more despondent with age. Li Yuanjiao, having just achieved Foundation Establishment Realm and freed from long-held frustrations, gently touched the sword at his waist and reassured, "Don't let fear overwhelm you."

Li Qinghong turned to him, and Li Yuanjiao added, "Offer a sacrifice to the mirror to clear your mind. If it confirms our path, then proceed."

Li Xuanxuan, though listening, struggled with his anxiety. His hands trembled, haunted by memories of the market's flames and devil qi.

He sighed heavily.

The catastrophe in the market had drained him physically and mentally. He had been trembling with fear for years, often dreaming of Li Tongya and Li Mutian, waking up with a racing heart from his meditation.

After watching the two juniors perform the ritual and receive guidance from the mirror, Li Xuanxuan sat down wearily and made a decision.

"Qinghong will stay behind. Jiao'er, you'll go alone."

————

Mount Dongli, located in the north of Yue State, was a rare mountain covered predominantly with maple trees. At this time of year, streams of lights interspersed with the mountain's red foliage, creating a picturesque scene.

The mountain was sparsely populated with demonic creatures. A hundred years ago, the Azure Pond Sect surrounded it, and when the Dongli Sect was destroyed, many forbidden formations were left behind. It became a favored spot for the three sects and seven gates to train their disciples, with even peak master-level figures occasionally searching for spirit items.

Prior to the grotto heaven's fall, numerous rogue and devil cultivators had already begun roaming the area. Streams of light were periodically seen entering the mountain to explore the forbidden formations.

The sky above Mount Dongli was clear and cloudless. A figure descended from the great void, clad in light golden armor and holding a large halberd, with a jade seal hanging from his waist.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator hovered in the air for a moment before another figure appeared. This person wore a golden robe, and though the robe was loose, it was clear that the figure was a woman. She was veiled, with white gauze obscuring her face.

The Purple Mansion Realm female cultivator called out, "Tiaoxiao."

Yuan Su turned around and glanced at her calmly before saying, "Ah, Master Qiushui. Congratulations on your mastery of the divine ability and breakthrough to the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm."

The female cultivator remained silent.

The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stood quietly, their gazes fixed on the grotto heaven floating in the great void.

Yuan Su spoke softly, "Senior Dongli has been hiding it for so many years, but it still came to light in the end... After all, it is Mount Luoxia. Among the visible Daoist sects, Luoxia is the only leader..."

The Purple Mansion female cultivator listened in silence and succinctly added, "The local Daoist sects."

The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators conversed casually as the Azure Pond Sect's Dawn Cloudliner broke through the heavy clouds and slowly descended onto Mount Dongli, casting shimmering light all around it.

Li Xizhi stood on the large vessel, watching the cultivators below. He murmured, "Another bloody storm has passed... I wonder how many cultivators have fallen to the devil plague. Given the current state of affairs, how many are left in Yue State?"

Yang Xiao'er, who was standing beside him, smiled and replied, "Brother Zhi, you may not know this, but for the three sects and seven gates, rogue cultivators are plentiful. The Eastern Sea is vast, and as long as the coast's guardians relax even slightly, hundreds of Eastern Sea cultivators, lured by Yue State's wealth, will rush in as rogue cultivators."

Yang Xiao'er glanced at those around them and transmitted with her divine sense, "Once cultivators in Yue State obtain the treasure and leave, without suppression from the three sects and seven gates in the Eastern Sea, it's natural for them to establish their own sects. The Eastern Sea cultivators are used to being impoverished and will be eager to come in. After all, not every place could grow Spirit Paddies..."

Li Xizhi nodded and responded softly, "I've heard that Changxiao Gate was relocated here only in the past two hundred years. The seven gates can be moved or dispersed, but never the three sects."

Yang Xiao'er seemed to suddenly recall something and asked in confusion, "But... Brother Zhi's ancestor... is Li Mutian, right? It is said he followed my ancestor to conquer Mount Yue..."

The alarm in Li Xizhi's heart blared. However, he remained calm and replied nonchalantly, "That's correct."




# Chapter 450: Lying In Wait

Yang Xiao'er smiled as she stepped closer and quietly replied, "My family's ancestor also praised him, saying he was a heroic, kind, and amiable man... It took him only thirty years to establish his foundation, and all four of his sons are remarkable talents..."

Yang Xiao'er spoke with unmistakable respect, perhaps influenced by her affection for Li Xizhi which in turn fostered her positive impression on the elders of the Li Family.

Li Xizhi, however, was surprised as he listened.

How is this possible? I-It's... been nearly a hundred years... My great ancestor was merely a mortal! How could Yang Tianya possibly remember him...? What is the meaning of this?!

Li Xizhi had read the Internal History before and knew all the truths.

Although it was not surprising for her to say that great grandfather was talented... What did she mean by kind and amiable? It would be a better compliment to say that he was cunning and bold! Not many in my family are kind and amiable... Yang Tianya... This Yang Tianya!

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Li Xizhi could only laugh and say, "He was not as accomplished as Old Ancestor Tianya who... after his recent breakthrough, must be nearing the peak of Foundation Establishment, with the Purple Mansion Realm soon within reach!"

"It won't be that easy," Yang Xiao'er simply muttered, her gaze drifting toward the distant sky as she added softly, "The Lixia Immortals are coming."

Li Xizhi followed her gaze and spotted a large gray boat in the air. A middle-aged man who was clad in snow-white fox fur with slightly elongated eyes stood calmly at the bow against the breeze.

"Man on Mount Feather, Xiao Yongling!"

Xiao Yongling carried an unassuming aura and did not appear particularly exceptional, yet he commanded respect and admiration. After all, he had fought three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators alone in Yuyuan Market, preserving the most prosperous hub for the Xiao Family and earning himself a formidable reputation throughout Yue State.

This battle had left Xiao Yongling gravely injured, but thanks to the Xiao Family's treasured panaceas, not only was he saved, but his strength also greatly increased.

Now standing at the bow of the boat, he offered a light nod and smile to Li Xizhi, who hurriedly returned the gesture while Yang Xiao'er cupped her fist respectfully.

She mused, Rumor has it that Man on Mount Feather and Celestial Moon Sword knew each other for a long time and were close... So it must be true then!

After a brief wait, cultivators from the three sects and seven gates arrived. As Daoist Master Yuan Su and Daoist Master Qiushui stepped out of thin air, colorful lights of their divine abilities began to rise. Above Mount Dongli, a gap soon appeared in the sky, revealing collapsed pavilions and mountain peaks.

The disciples moved in an orderly procession through the gap, disappearing swiftly into the skies. From Mount Dongli, rich spiritual qi poured forth and spiritual energy surged powerfully. Streams of spiritual qi descended from the void, causing the spirit water to churn and the spirit flames to flare. This disturbance roused the rogue and devil cultivators, who had been lying in wait on the mountain, into action.

An hour later, the air was filled with dust, debris, and fragments of pavilions raining down as the rogue cultivators erupted into cheers.

"The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven has fallen into the sea!"

————

Meanwhile on Mount Qingdu...

Li Yuanjiao emerged, riding the wind as Moongaze Lake celebrated his breakthrough with rainfall. He navigated through the mist, shrouding the lake in mist. He glided through it, feeling free and unrestrained.

As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Li Yuanjiao enjoyed a noble status. Such a breakthrough would leave anyone beaming with joy, and he had not felt this proud in many years. Soaring above the Fei Family's territory, he gazed at the bright stars, having left Yue State and arrived in Xu State.

This area, governed by the Yue Cultivating Sect, was considered very safe. Beyond it lay the wild hills—a far more perilous route avoided by most cultivators. Given the dangers near Mount Dongli, Li Yuanjiao preferred to take a longer detour.

The night deepened, yet he did not dim his mana light. He was secretly hoping to encounter some devil or rogue cultivators to rob, thereby replenishing his dwindling storage pouch.

In such a wilderness and armed with the mirror, Li Yuanjiao was naturally eager for such encounters.

Unfortunately, the cultivators in the mountains were mostly of the Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realms—who were wise enough not to provoke a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. After an uneventful flight that lasted several days, Li Yuanjiao finally arrived at the territory of Profound Peak Gate.

The mountain gate of Profound Peak loomed like a giant bear hibernating in the morning sun, intimidating yet awe-inspiring. Reflecting on Daoist Master Changxi's achievements of moving the mountain all the way from Xu State, Li Yuanjiao felt a flicker of yearning for the Purple Mansion Realm.

How many more years must my family wait before we produce someone of such caliber...?

As he prepared to ride the wind around the mountain, a female cultivator dressed in a light-yellow dharma robe soared into the sky and halted him in his flight. She cupped her fist respectfully and asked softly, "Kong Tingyun from Profound Peak greets fellow Daoist... May I ask which peak you represent?"

Her discerning eyes immediately recognized the extraordinary nature of the Qingche Sword behind Li Yuanjiao. Coupled with his Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit, he appeared rather majestic amidst the clouds and fog, leading her to assume he was a cultivator of high standing from one of the three sects and seven gates.

Li Yuanjiao returned the gesture, responding in a deep voice.

"I am Li Yuanjiao of the Li Family from Lijing... Pleased to meet you, fellow Daoist!"

"Ah, the Sword Immortal Clan," Kong Tingyun noted with admiration, then added softly, "What brings you to our territory? I'd be happy to assist in any way I can."

Knowing it was imprudent to reveal his true intentions, Li Yuanjiao simply stated, "I seek passage to the estuary of the Great River... I wonder if Profound Peak could facilitate this...?"

Upon hearing his request, Kong Tingyun chuckled softly. Her eyes glinted as she responded, "If Brother Jiao has come here seeking the treasures of Dongli, I'm afraid you'd be disappointed!"

"Hmm?"

Li Yuanjiao maintained his composure though his motives were quickly discerned by this woman, and simply smiled.

"Why do you say that?" he asked.

Kong Tingyun explained, "Brother Jiao is smart enough to think of navigating the Profound Peak's territories to reach the sea, but each family's land here is well-fortified. Wherever rogue cultivators descended, they fall under the jurisdiction of that sect."

"Not just in Profound Peak, but also among the Sword Sect, Red Reef, and Snow Ji. All Dao lineages are united and have set up ambushes. No rogue cultivator would be able to slip through," she added.

She continued gently, emphasizing, "The Dongli Sect has left behind many valuables, including dharma relics and the Dao lineage of Daoist Master Cui Mu of Dongli. Even if they decay, they will do so within the confines of Yue State—it's absolutely impossible for them to reach the eastern sea. Two groups have already come seeking these treasures, and both were turned away by Profound Peak..."

Upon hearing this, Li Yuanjiao chuckled self-deprecatingly and shrugged as he replied, "It seems the world is full of clever people... small schemes are indeed laughable."

Observing his unruffled demeanor, Kong Tingyun's regard for him grew. She smiled faintly and offered a word of advice.

"This matter is highly confidential. While I can't divulge too much, Brother Jiao should know that the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven is under close watch...

"Don't be fooled by the joy of the rogue and devil cultivators. Anything they touch, anyone they meet, and all traces they leave within three days of departing Dongli are monitored. The ordinary items will be overlooked, but nothing of the Purple Mansion Realm will be able to slip through..."

Li Yuanjiao felt a chill down his spine as he nodded slowly. Kong Tingyun, mistaking his reaction for prior knowledge, exclaimed, "Forgive me for flaunting my knowledge, I have forgotten about the close ties between the Xiao and Li families!"

Li Yuanjiao reassured her repeatedly, and Kong Tingyun, looking at his Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, hesitated briefly before saying, "Actually, there is a small matter for which I might require Brother Jiao's assistance..."

"What is it?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

Kong Tingyun explained, "I was guarding one of the estuaries a few years ago and once encountered a Foundation Establishment Realm demonic creature in Lake Xian that is linked to the sea... Unfortunately, I wasn't strong enough to vanquish it alone. I am the only Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator on Yunyue Peak so... could I hire Brother Jiao to assist me?"

Li Yuanjiao's suspicions arose, and he replied tactfully, "Your sect has many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... Why not seek their help?"

Kong Tingyun pursed her lips and answered, "There are many factions within the sect, and not all get along harmoniously... I have always stayed neutral and don't want to be seen as favoring any particular peak..."

This explanation slightly alleviated Li Yuanjiao's doubts. With the mirror in his possession, he felt confident in his abilities, and besides, knowing Profound Peak Gate's good reputation, he could not help but ask, "What kind of demonic creature is it?"

Kong Tingyun looked up with bright eyes and explained, "It is a Hooked Serpent that resides at the bottom of Lake Xian. It fled there after losing a battle to the Azure Water Serpent Dragon of Wave Island in the sea... I wish to obtain the two hooks on the snake's tail."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, then answered with a smile, "I do have time to assist, but I must visit an old friend along the way first."

Kong Tingyun nodded slightly and said softly, "That's fine! I await your arrival in Profound Peak."

After a brief chat, Li Yuanjiao departed on the wind. Kong Tingyun watched him disappear into the sky and paused among the clouds, musing to herself.

"What a cautious person he is..."

————

Leaving the Shanji Prefecture of Profound Peak Gate, Li Yuanjiao found a deserted mountain in a remote area and landed there. Reluctant to use his Qingche Sword, he summoned his mana to form a cave dwelling. After setting up a simple Embryonic Breathing Realm formation around it, he settled down and began to cultivate in silence.

He had no old friends in the northern Yue State; he had only mentioned that to Kong Tingyun as a precaution—to let her know that someone knew of his whereabouts, should he meet an untimely end.

Sitting in the cave, he thought to himself, Although the estuary is currently under the control of the Profound Peak Gate, that doesn't mean I can't intercept someone midway... Even if it's not as busy as the estuary, catching one or two passersby would be worthwhile.

I'll spend some time cultivating on this deserted mountain path and see if I'll find one or two trying to escape... If it's a devil cultivator, I'll take them down with a palm strike, and if it's a rogue cultivator... I'll assess the situation further.

After waiting a day, the distant surge of spiritual qi and energy signaled the fall of a grotto heaven. Estimating the time it would take for those from Mount Dongli to reach here, Li Yuanjiao then closed his eyes and cultivated for over a day before taking out the mirror. He invoked it, activating its ability that allowed his consciousness to travel between heaven and earth.

Xianjian's current range of vision was vast, covering an entire county's land. It encompassed not only the large area from Yufu Prefecture to Shanji Prefecture but also the border city of Yufu Prefecture and a considerable portion of Shanji Prefecture.

The range of the immortal mirror now spanned an entire prefecture, covering a vast expanse within Yufu Prefecture and Shanji Prefecture. In fact, it even provided clear views of Yufu Prefecture's border town and half of Shanji Prefecture.

With a quick scan, Li Yuanjiao detected three mana lights and seven blood lights weaving through the chaotic wilderness mountains. Without further hesitation, he emerged from the formation and flew toward the nearest devil cultivator.

As soon as he crossed over a mountain, sure enough, he spotted two devil cultivators cautiously flying close to the ground, attempting to conceal their presence. However, they were starkly exposed under the scrutiny of the immortal mirror.

One late-stage and one early-stage Qi Cultivators...

Li Yuanjiao suppressed his aura and approached stealthily, his sword in hand. When he was within the range of the cultivators' spiritual senses, he suddenly leaped up and executed the River Crossing Torrential Step, launching an attack.

The devil cultivator barely managed to exclaim "Who?!" before Li Yuanjiao was upon him. He was a middle-aged man wielding a skeletal dharma artifact.

"A Foundation Establishment cultivator?!" he exclaimed in shock.

The greenish-gray serpent dragon coiling around Li Yuanjiao's body surged forward, striking the face of the early-stage female Qi Cultivator fiercely. His Qingche Sword unleashed a greenish-white sword aura that left the man dazed.

Clang!

The Law of Celestial Moon was a lethal move combined with the ambush. The man could not even manage to cast a spell or reach for another dharma artifact in his storage pouch in time. Within moments, his head was sent flying and his body exploded.

Li Yuanjiao collected the man's storage pouch in the shower of blood before stepping forward to crush the severed head aside and casually cast a fire spell, reducing the man to ashes without giving him a chance to defend himself.

Turning around, he saw that the dragon serpent had devoured half of the female devil cultivator's body. Her face was pale—clearly lifeless. Li Yuanjiao frowned, activating his immortal foundation to make the serpent dragon spit her out. After collecting the storage pouch from her body as well, he destroyed the corpse with a spell.

These two bear a resemblance... they must be father and daughter.

The devil cultivator's severed skeletal dharma artifact that had been destroyed by his sword aura continued spewing resentment and blood qi. Li Yuanjiao swiftly picked it up and flew to the next blood light.

Arriving at the destination, he found it eerily empty, despite the mirror's earlier detection of a devil cultivator. He happily speculated, "A dharma artifact that can conceal presence...?"

As soon as Li Yuanjiao voiced this thought, the cunning devil cultivator soared upward, hurling a jade bottle with intricate patterns at the distant ground. From his other sleeve, he flung a blood-colored talisman.

Li Yuanjiao sneered as the serpent dragon coiled around his body and sprang into action, swiftly capturing the jade bottle lying on the ground. With a swift wave of his sleeve, he obliterated the blood-colored talisman in front of him and went in pursuit of the fleeing devil cultivator.

The devil cultivator produced another jade bottle in desperation and exclaimed, "Senior! This is the Profound Yang Li Fire!"

He smacked the bottle, sending it flying to the ground while simultaneously tossing his storage pouch aside. Without wasting another moment that would allow Li Yuanjiao to unsheathe his sword, he quickly clasped his hands together and performed a hand seal to cast a spell.

Profound Yang Li Fire!

Li Yuanjiao caught the jade bottle with one hand and drew his sword with the other. However, the devil cultivator had already unleashed his secret technique, transforming his entire body and facial features into blood. Surging blood flames enveloped his ghostly pale head as it flew away at a speed surpassing that of typical Qi Cultivators.

Clang!

Green and white sword arc from Li Yuanjiao's Celestial Moon Slash technique whistled through the air, blowing the man's head up. The blood flames had fizzled into black smoke before pieces of the poor man's head could even touch the ground.

How ruthless... You could have escaped if your opponent were any other early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator!

Li Yuanjiao marveled at his own decisive actions, grateful for the supremacy of his sword which had narrowly prevented the cultivator's escape.

"Drat!"

While he was engaging with the man, the remaining devil and rogue cultivators had long fled. None of them were visible through the immortal mirror. Li Yuanjiao landed to collect the discarded storage pouch, stashing it swiftly into his chest pocket.

Without further delay, he soared on the winds, tracing the predicted route of the fleeing cultivators. Soon enough, he spotted a rogue cultivator flying cautiously on the wind.

"Excellent!"

Pleased, fog swirled on his face, concealing Li Yuanjiao's face as he descended in front of the man and bluntly made his demands.

"Storage pouch."

The rogue cultivator jumped like a frightened bird. After scanning with his spiritual sense, his legs buckled as he landed, hastily untying the storage pouch from his waist with a pitiful plea.

"Senior, s-spare me! Everything I have is here!"

Noting the kneeling rogue cultivator's shaky voice but stable hand on the ground, Li Yuanjiao chuckled. He took the pouch, laughing hoarsely as he mocked, "No mediocre cultivator could escape from Mount Dongli. Drop the act... You're just afraid I'll kill you."

The rogue cultivator's heart pounded as he repeatedly pressed his forehead to the ground. Li Yuanjiao peered into the pouch, finding only a Yang Nourishing Technique—a cultivation method from Dongli Sect, a portion of Fire Baleful Qi, and nothing else useful save for a bunch of insignificant items owned by the rogue cultivator.




# Chapter 452: Respective Benefits

Li Yuanjiao carefully stowed away the two items before tossing the storage pouch back to the rogue cultivator, who was still bowing while kneeling before him. Observing the man, Li Yuanjiao discerned that despite his ragged appearance, the man practiced a proper Qi cultivation method. His hands were unusually soft and fair, showing that he was likely versed in the arts of immortal cultivation.

This aroused Li Yuanjiao's suspicion.

"Are you a rogue cultivator?" he asked.

Recognizing that Li Yuanjiao was no easy target to deceive, the rogue cultivator secretly thought to himself, This man is cautious and didn't kill me outright... Surely, he isn't a devil cultivator! Perhaps he belongs to one of the three sects or seven gates, or a prestigious immortal clan... These people are knowledgeable; deceit would surely backfire...

Adjusting his strategy, the rogue cultivator lifted his head, shedding any previous semblance of cowardice, and explained in a respectful manner, "I was once a cultivator from Wu State. My sect was destroyed by devil cultivators, forcing me to seek refuge in Yue State..."

Li Yuanjiao, impressed by his composed tone and demeanor, contemplated recruiting him, thinking to himself, If I treat him with kindness, perhaps I could acquire the secret techniques of Wu State and an ally for my family...

However, Li Yuanjiao was inherently distrustful. Sensing the man's true essence for a brief moment, he felt an unnerving familiarity. A chilling thought flashed through his mind suddenly, causing him to mutter in shock, "Slaughter Jun Gate?!"

Startled at being recognized so quickly, the rogue cultivator immediately pressed his forehead to the ground again. Realizing that he could no longer conceal his identity, he replied solemnly, "Yes... May I inquire who Senior is...?"

Li Yuanjiao recalled the old monkey and the Slaughter Jun Kui Light technique he had acquired years ago.

He mused to himself, Such a coincidence! How could we dare to involve ourselves with them right now? The Slaughter Jun Gate was devastated during the devil plague... Who knows they might be scheming?!

Besides, this man is no ordinary character; he might be a serpent dragon with a significant fate!

Deciding against taking advantage of the situation, Li Yuanjiao dropped the damaged dharma artifact from the devil cultivator onto the ground and emptied his storage pouch.

Several bottles of the devil cultivator's blood pills, over a dozen Spirit Stones, and a couple of low-quality dharma artifacts, along with the Fire Baleful Qi and Yang Nourishing Technique manual came tumbling out.

After a brief inspection of the manual, he hastily repacked them and said, "I have received favors from Slaughter Jun Gate... Consider these items as repayment. Take them and sell them after you leave!"

For the first time in their conversation, the rogue cultivator's composure wavered, now stricken with genuine shock. After a stunned silence, he hurriedly asked, "Senior, may I ask for your name?"

Already riding on the wind, Li Yuanjiao simply replied, "This is not the time to talk, leave quickly!"

The rogue cultivator's eyes reddened slightly, managing only to call out, "Tu Longjian will never forget the kindness you have shown him today! I shall repay you generously in the future!"

Eager to avoid trouble, Li Yuanjiao swiftly departed. Once he landed safely back in his cave dwelling, he breathed a sigh of relief, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders.

He mused quietly, "I don't really care about the repayment, I just hope he won't bring danger to our family... Given that demon cultivators have the backing of an immortal sect, there must be more to the Slaughter Jun Gate incident than meets the eye, just like the mystery surrounding the Xiao Family... My family has received the two legacies with fear. Only those who have lost their minds would involve themselves with those from Slaughter Jun Gate..."

Li Yuanjiao had briefly examined the Yang Nourishing Technique in Tu Longjian's possession. It appeared to be a method for converting one type of spirit fire into another, but it required numerous spirit items and extensive knowledge. However, the manual was thick with a lot of content. Cautious of potential traps, he dared not delve too deeply into it.

After thinking for a moment, he decided that it should be safe to examine the storage pouches, so he took out the three of them excitedly.

The storage pouches from the father and daughter were ordinary, but the final pouch from the daring demon cultivator seemed of superior quality. Li Yuanjiao looked at it for a bit and grew suspicious again as he mumbled, "I'll have someone open this back at home rather than risking it myself..."

He had handed over the dharma artifacts from the father and daughter to Tu Longjian, so there was little left in his possession—only two jade bottles.

One was left by the fleeing demon cultivator. It was slender, about two fingers wide, and adorned with silver patterns. Although small, it looked exquisite. Li Yuanjiao channeled his true essence into it, watching as colorful brilliance danced across its surface before it released a white mist.

The mist continued to rise, gradually creating a faint veil of concealment around him. Under its cover, his body seemed to vanish, leaving the cave dwelling suddenly empty.

The mist, perhaps attuned to the Jing Dragon King immortal foundation, seemed to resonate intimately with him, swirling around him protectively. It was only then that realization dawned upon Li Yuanjiao.

This must be the dharma artifact that the demon cultivator used to conceal himself! I wonder where he got it from... The patterns on the bottle are definitely unusual. They're nothing like what I've seen before.

He inverted the bottle and immediately heard the sound of rain before a stream of crystal-clear spring water poured out like flowing silk, weaving through the air like a snake.

Li Yuanjiao peered closer, intrigued.

Engraved at the bottom of the bottle were the words—Li Qianyuan from the Li Family of the Wei State.

"Wei State... So the Li Family still existed in the ancient Wei State..."

No wonder I couldn't detect that demon cultivator; this artifact is a Foundational Establishment Realm dharma artifact... He was decisive, cautious and even had such a prized item in his possession.

The Profound Patterned Bottle not only concealed one's figure but also served as a protective dharma artifact when inverted. The mist within could ward off spells and enhance wind control, making it a truly versatile artifact.

"Excellent! I'll name it the Profound Patterned Bottle."

Acquiring this artifact made Li Yuanjiao's journey worthwhile. The Azure Manifestation, a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, was a generous gift from Yuan Tuan when she visited the Li Family. Although such artifacts were easily obtainable for peak masters of the three sects and seven gates, they were treasures to clan cultivators.

Another jade bottle contained a spirit fire known as the Profound Yang Li Fire. Li Yuanjiao was unfamiliar with this bright golden-red flame, but he could feel its intense heat painfully searing his spiritual senses.

Gazing toward the sky, he left the cave dwelling on a gust of wind, activating the Profound Patterned Bottle, and flew amidst the mist toward the Profound Peak Gate.

Meanwhile in the Li Family...

Although Li Yuanjiao had been away for some time, news of his breakthrough had spread across the six mountains. The cultivators at home rejoiced, and a few guest cultivators breathed sighs of relief and could finally rest easy.

Li Tongya had been absent for over a decade, raising suspicions among the guest and external cultivators. However, given his formidable reputation, none dared to inquire further.

After all, he was Li Qiuyang and Chen Donghe's mentor, and could subdue even An Zheyan. His penetrating gaze, having once swept over everyone, still lingered vividly in their memories even after more than ten years.

Li Yuanjiao's breakthrough further solidified everyone's confidence. Several families sent congratulatory gifts, masking any jealousy with outward expressions of congratulations.

In the old central hall, Li Yuanping calculated the family's finances meticulously, occasionally writing something on his desk. Li Qinghong stood at his side with her spear. Having consumed a talisman pill, she now radiated the aura of a Qi Cultivator at the ninth heavenly layer.

Li Yuanping reviewed the ledger, carefully explaining the details to Li Qinghong, who was listening attentively.

"With this new system, our family's surplus this year has decreased by seventeen or eighteen Spirit Stones," he reported.
𝚏𝕣𝐞𝗲𝐰𝕖𝐛𝐧𝕠𝕧𝚎𝚕.𝐜𝚘𝗺

The Li Family's most productive territory was Mount Yue's Wutu Mansion. With seventy Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators working tirelessly, it generated twenty Spirit Stones annually. After accounting for seven to eight hundred jin of Spirit Paddies as salaries, a surplus of fourteen Spirit Stones remained.

Next was Huazhong Mansion, which earned sixteen Spirit Stones and after paying out six to seven hundred jin of Spirit Paddies as salaries, and a surplus of about ten remained.

The remaining Lijing, Huaqian, and Yuting were less fertile, each yielding only seven or eight Spirit Stones. With fewer workers, these mountains managed a surplus of two to three Spirit Stones each, totaling eight altogether.

"The annual profit was a mere thirty-two Spirit Stones, totaling only one hundred and sixty over five years," Li Yuanping continued thoughtfully.

Fortunately, with the Peak Guardians appointed, they could be sent to the remote areas of Mount Dali to gather qi. With monthly rotations, this yields an additional seven Spirit Stones annually.

"With the inclusion of the gathered qi, the total comes to one hundred and ninety-five Spirit Stones, just about ten to twenty away from the required tribute amount," he added with a satisfied nod.

The gap of only three or four Spirit Stones annually was manageable. Since most talismans crafted by his father, Li Xuanxuan, were distributed as rewards, covering the deficit was relatively straightforward.

"Conversely, with the new system implemented, our control over our own territory has more than doubled. The number of personnel at our disposal has increased tenfold, significantly enhancing our influence over the neighboring families and those on the eastern shore..." he continued.

These developments—distributing benefits, stabilizing the cultivator groups under their command, and securing the populace's loyalty—were all within Li Yuanping's expectations. Just as he was pondering how to further capitalize on these changes, someone approached him.

"Seventh Uncle, Ximing is getting ready to break through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm," Li Xijun reported, bowing slightly.

Li Yuanping nodded silently, offering a smile but then gently asked, "Have you considered taking a wife, Jun'er?"

At the age of twenty-one, Li Xijun's early advancements in Qi Cultivation Realm made him appear youthful. However, he was still at the first heavenly layer, highlighting the growing gap in talent with his brother, Li Ximing, who was advancing even faster.

Li Xijun occasionally brought joyous news to Li Yuanping, hoping to bridge the gap between the father and son. However, Li Yuanping seemed uninterested and instead posed a personal question to him.

"I've met the daughter from An Family...but I don't think it'll work out," Li Xijun replied truthfully.

Li Yuanping sighed, but did not ask if it was the girl or just that his nephew was not interested in the relationship. He simply murmured, "You'll have to decide for yourself... I hope you'll at least leave an heir.

Li Xijun shook his head gently.

"Big Brother has many heirs, and the second lineage already has successors. Xijun will leave it all to fate. Retaining Yang Essence and practicing certain secret techniques could also prove advantageous."[1]

After chatting briefly, Li Yuanping watched his nephew depart on the wind back to Mount Qingdu to focus on either his cultivation or swordsmanship.

He could not help but remark, "This child excels in many areas... He's sharp, diligent, and always dedicated to his swordsmanship day and night. However, he's emotionally reserved and harbors an inherent pride that makes it difficult for others to relate to him..."

Li Qinghong, standing nearby, pursed her lips.

"It's partly my fault. When Jun'er was young, his father, Brother Yun, faced hardships. As a result, he was exposed to many two-faced people. This inevitably shaped his reserved and cautious nature..."

"With his remarkable appearance, innate talent, and early experiences that taught him to see through people, it comes as no surprise that he's prideful. Considering everything, I think he's fine... he could have turned out to be way worse."

As Li Qinghong concluded, Li Yuanping stared into her almond-shaped eyes and suddenly chuckled.

"Jun'er truly takes after you. You're really his aunt," he remarked.

Li Qinghong was taken aback, but as she saw Li Yuanping's pale face breaking into a strained smile, he hoarsely added, "Someone in the family has also chosen to remain unmarried for life, even sacrificing her lifespan to pursue the dao. She has a remarkable appearance, innate talent, wits, and pride too... Yes, I'm talking about you, Li Qinghong!"

————

Meanwhile, at Mount Dongli...

The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven was approximately the size of a prefecture. This once-majestic realm, filled with immortal mountains and sprawling structures and pavilions, now lay in ruins. Vibrant spirit fires were spreading in every direction amidst billowing black smoke.

Yuan Tuan, accompanied by Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er, landed on a modest hill. The peak assigned to Yuan Tuan was notably smaller and less impressive due to Qingsui Peak's declining power. It appeared that little of value could be found in this unassuming location.

Li Xizhi stepped into a small courtyard on the mountain. Yuan Tuan remained mounted on a deer as she instructed gently, "Go and search. Bring back Qi Cultivation and Foundation Establishment Realm items to the peak. Items of the Purple Mansion Realm should be submitted to the main peak. Ensure pill recipes, cultivation and secret manuals are archived within the sect. Do not disseminate them widely, and avoid trying anything funny. Remember, the grand formations are watching us."

Yuan Tuan, lacking strong backing within the clan, knew better than to aim for the central peaks, where the most valuable treasures were likely kept. Instead, she chose not to vie for access, avoiding unnecessary conflicts.

The courtyard was littered with broken bookshelves and various spirit items scattered on the ground, shimmering with spiritual energy. Yuan Tuan scanned the place with her spiritual sense, then reached out to pick up a shimmery fragment from the ground.

With a tone of regret, she remarked, "A fine Crying Blood Stone... What a pity... Chu Yi's greed has devastated the grotto heaven, destroying at least thirty percent of the spirit treasures within..."

Inside the courtyard, Li Xizhi sifted through the debris of collapsed medicine cabinets and found several stacks of prescriptions. Upon closer inspection, one was prominently labeled—Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill, written by Cui Niexiang.

Dongli Sect preferred to use durable spirit cloth for their records to minimize damage. Li Xizhi swiftly scanned the information with his spiritual sense. Continuing his search, he found yet another prescription—Two Ways of Refining Renewal Spirit Pill, written by Cui Er.

It contained two methods of refining this spirit pill, one for the Qi Cultivation and the other for the Foundation Establishment Realm. This delighted Li Xizhi as he thought to himself, Ming'er is a skillful alchemist. This recipe will surely benefit our family!

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao'er approached, holding a stack of documents, looking as though realization had just dawned upon her.

"Brother! The Cui family of the Dongli Sect indeed originated from the north, and their heritage is deeply tied to the ancient Wei Kingdom. It's no wonder they use Yang and Li Fire as their emblems..."

Li Xizhi immediately recalled the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual back home, authored by Cui Mu of the ancient Wei State. A surge of hope filled his heart as he wondered, Could this grotto heaven hold the key to my family's destiny? If I can find the Purple Mansion Realm part of the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual here, it could revitalize Brother Ming's Dao!

His heart raced with the possibility, but anxiety soon crept in. The three sects and seven gates had long divided this grotto heaven among themselves. How could he possibly find an opportunity there? He'd probably be killed by disciples of the same sect as soon as he left this peak...

Despite his concerns, he mused aloud, "I wonder if there are any Grade Five or Grade Six cultivation techniques hidden in this grotto heaven... Securing one would certainly be a remarkable feat."

Yuan Tuan, overhearing him, shook her head slightly and murmured softly, "Don't get your hopes up. Aside from Chu Yi, the Li Fire Spear, no one else can unlock the Dongli Dao Collection."

After their brief exchange, they swiftly plundered the main courtyard atop the mountain before descending to continue their scavenging, as instructed by Master Yuan Tuan.

As Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er made their way down, Yuan Tuan's brow furrowed in contemplation.

Yang Tianya claimed that Li Mutian truly existed... Could it be that there was really a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator named Li Mutian in Yang Tianya's forces? How did he meet an untimely end though? The clan seems oblivious to this, and their records mention only three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in their family...

What was Daoist Master Yuan Su thinking when he chose Ning Hemian as Li Xuanfeng's wife... Whose pawn is the Li Family..?

The deeper Yuan Tuan delved into these thoughts, the more bewildering the situation seemed. Meanwhile, down the mountain, Yang Xiao'er called out to Li Xizhi warmly and excitedly, drawing Yuan Tuan's gaze downward.

Watching Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er, she reminisced about her senior brother who had long left the sect and was never to return, leaving her behind. Her eyes reddened slightly at Yang Xiao'er's affection for Li Xizhi.

Regardless of the turmoil outside, my immediate priority is to protect the young ones at our peak.

1. Big brother here refers to Li Xicheng, and Yang Essence here refers to virginity. ☜




# Chapter 454: The Hooked Serpent

Within the world of the mirror...

While Li Yuanjiao journeyed through the desolate mountain temples to Shanji Prefecture, Lu Jiangxian had read 131 manuals on Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques, 36 on Qi Cultivation Realm, and two on Foundation Establishment Realm.

All these manuals were piled on the desk in front of Lu Jiangxian, forming a small mountain before him.

Two more Foundation Establishment Realm techniques: Yi Wood Talisman Technique and Mountain Mist and Sea Technique, corresponding to the Dao foundations of Yi Wood Wholeness and Mist Yin Reversion...

The scrolls before Lu Jiangxian had already formed a small hill. He was carefully reading the Yang Nourishing Technique from Tu Longjian, which was the longest secret technique he had come across, truly broadening his horizons.

This is the first time I've encountered someone naturally endowed with fate...

Li Yuanjiao had spared Tu Longjian, largely because Lu Jiangxian had not intervened, allowing Li Yuanjiao to be swayed by his thoughts and let the man go.

Under the illumination of the mirror, Tu Longjian's aura was a bright crimson, his presence incredibly formidable. Though Li Yuanjiao could not see it, Lu Jiangxian observed it clearly.

If Tu Longjian had died at Li Yuanjiao's hands, thus disrupting the flow of fate and the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator traced it backward, it could have caused significant problems...

Lu Jiangxian had his fair share of encounters with many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. He knew they could not foresee every change in the world, nor could they monitor everyone constantly. However, having mastered the Life Divine Ability and formed alliances, they had a general sense of the forthcoming situation.

Li Yuanjiao was not supposed to discover this person. It was only because fate was no match for the immortal mirror that he did. If he had killed Tu Longjian and taken the Yang Nourishing Technique, it could have potentially ruined important plans of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

Though the alliance between the Xiao and Li families might lead the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to suspect Xiao Chuting, Xiao Chuting would naturally suspect the Li Family. However, Xiao Chuting was already walking on thin ice. Lu Jiangxian feared that the old man would not be able to withstand the pressure, and he also feared that some in the Purple Mansion Realm might directly suspect the Li Family.

But what exactly is this fate thing... it's vastly different from divine abilities, affecting others without leaving a trace!

Lu Jiangxian had watched as the crimson fate behind Tu Longjian swirled, transforming Li Yuanjiao's intent from one of murder to one of recruitment. Even Li Yuanjiao's own aura was later also tinged with crimson, but due to his growing suspicion, he forcibly changed what could have led to his family's ruin into a situation where they merely suffered financial loss to avoid greater disaster.

There's a hint of Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit here, almost like... two fates compromising with each other... But if Li Yuanjiao also has fate on him, why have I never seen it?

Is fate manipulating people, or are people manipulating fate..?

————

Li Yuanjiao flew leisurely on a cloud, the mist swirling around him as he traveled. He had recently acquired a new treasure, and he was so enamored with it that he could not bear to part with it. While he was carefully exploring its wonders, he had flown into the territory of the Profound Peak Gate without realizing it.

His mood was light and carefree, and he felt an inexplicable sense of relief, as if he had narrowly escaped disaster. This only strengthened his belief that Tu Longjian was indeed endowed with fate. He halted before the gate's formation and put away his artifact.

A few moments later, Kong Tingyun came out to greet him. She had changed into a set of pale yellow feathered robes, appearing much more formal than when they had last met. She smiled and greeted, "Brother Jiao has arrived! Tingyun has been waiting for quite some time."

Li Yuanjiao returned the gesture with a cupped fist, and Kong Tingyun said, "Fellow Daoist, come with me to Lake Xian; we can talk on the way."

The two of them ascended into the air, and Li Yuanjiao was the first to ask, "How did your faction fare at the sea entrance?"

Kong Tingyun smiled, her eyes curving as she replied, "We had a bountiful harvest for once. In such a major event as the division of the grotto heaven, even the crumbs that fall from Azure Pond's fingers are enough to satisfy us!"

Seeing no unusual expression on her face, Li Yuanjiao nodded, looking ahead at the vast, dark lake that reflected spots of golden light under the blazing sun. Kong Tingyun continued, "I fought with the Hooked Serpent once; it was difficult to deal with. It feared the immortal sect backing me, so it did not dare to go all out and quickly fled a hundred li away to settle in a new location... I was afraid of scaring it away, so I did not pursue it further."

"We should search separately. The Hooked Serpent has a family and is not hard to find. It will only take half a day of searching, but we must be cautious not to alarm this creature," she suggested.

Li Yuanjiao responded, "That won't be necessary."

He shook his head and descended onto the surface of the lake. Instantly, the water began to surge, and the faint movements of a serpent dragon could be seen beneath the waves, occasionally revealing half of its black scaly claws.

Before long, a dark blue crayfish jumped out of the water, curled up in fear, trembling as it was held aloft by the waves. Li Yuanjiao asked in a low voice, "Where is the Hooked Serpent?"

After listening closely, Li Yuanjiao tossed the crayfish back into Lake Xian and said with a smile, "Seventy-two li to the east, there's a desolate mountain in the middle of the lake... The Hooked Serpent is in seclusion there."

"I almost forgot about the abilities of your Boundless Ocean!" Kong Tingyun praised in awe.

The two of them ascended into the air again, and Li Yuanjiao asked, "You mentioned earlier that the Hooked Serpent was driven away by the Azure Water Serpent Dragon... What kind of creature is this Azure Water Serpent Dragon?"

Kong Tingyun replied, "I inquired about it at Crimson Reef Island overseas. The Azure Water Serpent Dragon is not particularly strong, but it was sent by a certain serpent dragon palace under the sea. It has a profound background and drove the Hooked Serpent away..."

Li Yuanjiao, still thinking about the nature of Foundation Establishment Realm creatures in the sea, asked in confusion, "Are there many creatures in the sea like this Hooked Serpent with no significant background?"

Kong Tingyun nodded and answered, "There are countless demonic creatures in the sea, and the Eastern Sea is full of demon dens... Not to mention the Eastern Sea, even Lake Xian has quite a few. The Hooked Serpent is simply the weakest among them."

As they conversed, the desolate mountain soon came into view in the distance. Kong Tingyun performed a hand seal, clouds and mist began to rise beneath their feet.

Li Yuanjiao whispered, "I have an aura restraining artifact."

Kong Tingyun's eyes lit up as she nodded in understanding and replied, "I will go first, and Brother Jiao can follow."

Li Yuanjiao watched as she rode the wind into the water, then activated the Profound Patterned Bottle to scan the surroundings. After ensuring there were no hidden people or creatures lying in ambush, he too descended into the lake.

The waters were already churning, with various fish and shrimp scattering in all directions in a desperate bid to escape.

Li Yuanjiao caught sight of the emerald-green formation plate before him and could not help but feel a twinge of envy as he thought to himself, As expected of the three sects and seven gates; even the formation plates they use are of the Foundation Establishment Realm...

He slowly approached with the formation trembling incessantly.

This woman is unlikely to collude with the demonic creature to kill me... With the mirror in hand, I'm not afraid.

And thus, he used the Profound Patterned Bottle to release a mist, concealing himself as he infiltrated the formation. There, he saw a massive, dirty serpent body, about two zhang thick and as large as a water tank with scales gleaming brightly, each as big as a palm.

The Hooked Serpent's voice trembled as it lamented, "I have cultivated for many years and was fortunate to consume several spirit beasts to achieve my current Dao foundation. I came to Lake Xian only to feed on spirit creatures and had no intention of offending anyone... Could you consider the difficulty of my cultivation and spare my life, my lady? I will leave immediately and never return to Lake Xian!"

Kong Tingyun, knowing that Li Yuanjiao had entered the formation, remained silent and maintained her efforts. Li Yuanjiao quietly advanced. Seeing that it could not persuade her, the Hooked Serpent growled harshly, "How arrogant you are, little girl! Do you think you can kill me with this formation? I might as well eat you and then flee to the depths of the Eastern Sea! Can Changxi really chase me down from thousands of li away to seek revenge?"

As the serpent spoke, Li Yuanjiao moved to within a zhang of the massive snake. Any closer and he might alarm the creature, so he gripped his sword and prepared to strike, waiting for the serpent to raise its head high before unleashing a sword arc.

Roar!

A flash of sword light flickered underwater, suddenly creating a burst of blood as it left a massive wound at the serpent's vulnerable point.

Kong Tingyun was momentarily stunned, then sighed and she marveled to herself, "What a brilliant sword technique..."

The black serpent dragon coiled upward, entangling itself with the Hooked Serpent. The serpent no longer had time to hate its opponent's treachery as Kong Tingyun's spells and Li Yuanjiao's sword qi continued to rain down on it, battering it repeatedly.

The Hooked Serpent, unsure of what immortal foundation the attack stemmed from, spat out two green beams of light. The two venomous hooks on its forked tail also sprang up right away.

Kong Tingyun laughed lightly and chirped, "I have been waiting for this!"

From her sleeve flew a small pale-gold pearl which wobbled as it flew over, releasing waves of golden light that pinned the serpent's tail in place. The two green beams were also blocked by her shield-shaped dharma artifact.

Kong Tingyun then said, "I will leave the rest to you, Brother Jiao!"

Using her artifact to immobilize the serpent's most threatening twin tails and fend off the creature, Kong Tingyun gave Li Yuanjiao the opportunity to move in closer with his sword.

The serpent was in dire straits, and as a last resort, it opened its mouth and spat out a pearl.

The pearl whirled around, emitting a stream of cold, white mist that froze the surrounding area, causing shards of ice to form. However, Li Yuanjiao's expression turned slightly strange.

He subtly curled his finger, activating his Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit, and instantly absorbed a small portion of the cold qi into his hand. He burst out laughing as he said, "What a fine serpent pearl! Too bad you do not understand techniques and can only use cold qi to defend yourself... It is quite amusing!"

With both hands cupped together, the cold qi continuously flowed into his hands, causing the white pearl to lose its rotation and gravitate toward him. A storm of white qi surged into his hands, leaving a narrow ice pillar in the water.

Disciples of immortal sects indeed possess many immortal techniques...

The Hooked Serpent, now in utter despair, had lost its serpent pearl.

Kong Tingyun threw out a golden mountain which pressed down on the serpent, further weakening it.

The serpent, now near death, cried out desperately, "There is only one portion of Nascent Origin True Water in the mountain's depths... How do you two plan to divide it?"

Hearing this, Kong Tingyun's expression changed dramatically, a slight hint of anger crossing her face. She performed a hand seal, causing the golden mountain to shine even brighter, crushing the serpent further until it coughed up blood.

The female cultivator scolded, "Stop spouting nonsense!"

Li Yuanjiao, noticing her reaction, immediately understood the situation. He took a few steps forward and seized the serpent pearl in his hand, then severed its connection with the creature and stored it in his storage pouch. He then said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoist, dispel the formation quickly."
𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝑐𝘰𝑚

As soon as these words left his lips, he was already standing in front of Kong Tingyun with one hand on his sword, his face full of vigilance. Kong Tingyun pursed her lips and dispelled the formation while Li Yuanjiao, without hesitation, grabbed the formation plate in his hand, finally letting out a small sigh of relief.

I fear she might let greed cloud her judgment and try to trap and kill me here. Although she certainly wouldn't stand a chance against me, offending Profound Peak Gate would be a major issue.

Li Yuanjiao quickly landed in front of the mountain and sealed the Hooked Serpent's Dao foundation. Only then did he turn back, speaking in a deep voice, "Care to explain, fellow Daoist?"

Kong Tingyun put away her pearl and golden mountain artifacts, saying apologetically, "I did indeed deceive you... Although the hooks on the serpent's tail are also something I need, the real goal was this Nascent Origin True Water."

She explained softly, "Profound Peak Gate has a secret method. Years ago, I noticed changes in the water veins and realized that a spirit water would soon be born here. Fearing it would be taken by someone else, I secretly concealed the water veins, intending to retrieve it later. This place was later unexpectedly occupied by the Hooked Serpent. I just wanted to find someone to help remove this demonic creature so I could obtain the spirit water..."

Li Yuanjiao, being well-versed in deception himself, did not feel particularly angry. After all, everyone relied on their own abilities. He nodded and said, "So, in truth, you never fought the Hooked Serpent. You already knew it was here, and all those previous actions were just to disguise this desolate mountain... And as for not seeking help from your fellow disciples, I assume it is because you were afraid they would see through your method of concealing the water veins?"

Kong Tingyun smiled and nodded, replying, "Exactly. Who would have thought that this demon serpent would also discover the spirit water? My efforts were in vain..."

The two exchanged glances, and Kong Tingyun spoke in a serious tone, "The Tail Hooks and the Nascent Origin True Water are both things I must obtain! I hope you can part with them, fellow Daoist..."

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly, lifting the weakened Hooked Serpent from the lake as he replied, "I want the Hooked Serpent and the serpent pearl, and I will need another portion of spirit water to compensate for my efforts."

Kong Tingyun shook her head and said, "You ask for too much, fellow Daoist. I do not have any other spirit water... Please, consider another reward..."

Li Yuanjiao pondered for a moment and then responded, "Does your gate have anyone who can cultivate a fire vein? I ask that you help my Li Family cultivate one."

Kong Tingyun smiled slightly and said, "We do have such people! My senior brother has already gone out, and when he returns in some time, he can visit your clan to cultivate a fire vein. But... Why are you so confident that I will not go back on my word?"

With this, Kong Tingyun's tone became slightly cunning as she blinked her large eyes and smiled at him.

Li Yuanjiao shook his head, pulled out a green formation plate from his storage pouch, and calmly said, "Your Foundation Establishment Realm formation plate is still in my hands, and I am sure it is worth much more than a fire vein."

Kong Tingyun was taken aback. She had not expected that he had already thought several steps ahead when he made his first move. She bit her lip as she glared at him, but then could not help but laugh, saying, "Li Yuanjiao, you are indeed the most cunning person I have ever met!"

Li Yuanjiao retrieved the formation plate, already calculating in his mind how he could maximize the benefits by borrowing this formation for a while. He responded, "You flatter me. Under Azure Pond's governance, those who are not cunning or ruthless are long dead."

Kong Tingyun smiled faintly, forming a hand seal as she silently searched for the spirit water. Li Yuanjiao took the opportunity to ask, "What kind of treasure is this Nascent Origin True Water?"

Kong Tingyun seemed to be in a good mood, humming a tune as she replied with a smile, "Brother Yuanjiao, this Nascent Origin True Water is a top-grade spirit water. You are cunning and decisive; I am actually afraid that if I tell you its use and value, you might turn around and rob me of it... With the formation still in your hands, this little girl is really quite scared."

Li Yuanjiao was momentarily taken aback, then backed off with a somewhat sheepish expression. Kong Tingyun glanced at him and asked softly, "Does your clan have any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators? Perhaps someone with a similar temperament as you and has not yet married into the Xiao Family?"

Li Yuanjiao was baffled by this question and frowned.

"None."

Kong Tingyun sighed slightly, lowering her gaze as she began to lament, "I spent years in seclusion during my youth, and in the blink of an eye, more than forty years have passed. It is difficult to find a kindred spirit within the gate, and the few Foundation Establishment Realm male cultivators are really quite unremarkable..."

Li Yuanjiao immediately understood and offered some advice, "Choosing a Dao companion is something that must be done with great care. It is better to wait a little longer. The Dao is full of dangers, and if you choose a fool, it could bring disaster for three generations and ruin for a century—it is not something to take lightly."

"You're right," Kong Tingyun said as she bit her lip and continued softly, "The ancient times are distant and their records are lost; even in more recent history, there have been Dao Embryos who were harmed by the Dao companions in their family... How could we, mere small cultivators, claim to understand such matters? Perhaps remaining alone is the more prudent choice..."

Li Yuanjiao remained silent, which only deepened Kong Tingyun's worries. She continued to cast her spell wordlessly, holding the jade bottle in the air until a light green spirit water emerged from the ground, bringing some joy to her face.

After erasing all traces in the lake, Li Yuanjiao bade her farewell and left. Kong Tingyun watched him as he flew away, carrying the massive Hooked Serpent, until finally he disappeared on the horizon.

"What was I even thinking..?"

Kong Tingyun sighed. She patted her forehead with a wry smile and rode the wind back to face the gate's internal affairs alone.




# Chapter 456: Returning With The Serpent

Li Yuanjiao carried the half-dead Hooked Serpent away from the southern shore of Lake Xian at Profound Peak Gate. With the help of the Profound Patterned Bottle, the air was filled with water mist. The Hooked Serpent continued squeaking futilely, begging for mercy.

The creature was enormous, and the mist from the Profound Patterned Bottle could barely conceal it. Li Yuanjiao had only reached the shore when he was forced to land with a frown.

It's too conspicuous... This demon creature is also incredibly heavy. Putting aside the drain on my mana, it's impractical to fly over the wilderness and temples like this.

He swiftly changed course, flying north for a while, intending to go upstream of the river flowing into Lake Xian, pass through the safer territory of the Yue Cultivating Sect, and then only return to Moongaze Lake's northern shore via Xu State.

The travel journals left by Uncle Ling mentioned that the surging river aids those cultivating the Boundless Ocean, so this seems like a good opportunity to explore that.

Li Yuanjiao's Jing Dragon King was a serpent dragon of the lake, which allowed him to dive effortlessly into the water. Submerged, the weight of the Hooked Serpent lightened considerably due to natural buoyancy.

He first summoned several crab demons to inquire about the power dynamics at the lake's bottom and the locations of the demon kings. After planning his route, he dragged the Hooked Serpent slowly forward while pondering Kong Tingyun's recent words.

The Profound Peak Gate could be useful as an ally. I wonder how strong Daoist Master Changxi is... He appears to have a backing.

This could be a good opportunity to form a connection... Too bad my family lacks a suitable cultivator. Otherwise, things would be so much better with a strategic ally to watch over Mount Yue.

I wonder if this is truly Daoist Master Changxi's intention... Whose pawn is he?

As Li Yuanjiao mused on, he ignored the demon creature's chatter. The Hooked Serpent, observing his cautious demeanor, grew despondent and fell silent. After a lengthy pause, it sighed.

"Every demon said that the land is treacherous, yet I was skeptical. I coveted spirit items, only to face the fate of becoming serpent soup!"

Li Yuanjiao glanced at it and asked, "What is your Immortal Foundation?"

"Those at the Demon Palace call it Morning Cold Rain... I'm not sure what you all name it. I cultivate a feathered serpent while you cultivate a serpent dragon. I doubt I'm fit for consumption... If you desire so, I can find a serpent dragon for you, Exalted Immortal," the Hooked Serpent offered.

Li Yuanjiao listened quietly as he walked along the riverbed.

"You worry too much, fellow Daoist. I am neither from a demon den nor a dragon palace capable of binding spirits, nor am I from a temple with the means to purify demonic natures. How can I trust you? Once freed, you would surely flee."

The Hooked Serpent, fully aware of its predicament, curled up listlessly.

Li Yuanjiao pondered as he walked.

Although we subdued the Hooked Serpent in just a few moves, we've mostly relied on external power. The Qingche Sword and Profound Patterned Bottle, being Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts, played a part, not to mention Kong Tingyun's golden mountain and pearl, coupled with that powerful formation—all of which helped suppress this Hooked Serpent.

He observed the serpent's forked tail now without the hooks, unsightly from where Kong Tingyun had cut it.

I wonder if Senior White Banyan Fox is still beneath that tree... There's no need to rush to sacrifice this serpent demon. It might be wise to consult it first.

As he continued along the river, the water shifted between darkness and light, revealing lavish demon palaces, towers made of shells, and white caves.

Encountering two Foundation Establishment Realm demon generals patrolling the area, they were so intimidated by the sight of Li Yuanjiao dragging the Hooked Serpent that they did not dare to even lift their heads before quickly scurrying away.

Li Yuanjiao did not encounter the river's turbulent waves that Li Xuanling spoke of nor did he receive any cultivation enlightenment. Observing the river's wide and lengthy expanse, he mused to himself, "The rivers are broad and long... there should be many treasures here."

Reaching the territory of the Yue Cultivating Sect, Li Yuanjiao emerged from the water with the Hooked Serpent. A cultivator in white, with a sword on his back, stood before him, appearing to be deducing something. Nevertheless, he did not seem to be upset by the interruption caused by Li Yuanjiao.

"Nian Yi from Yue Cultivating Sect greets Senior! Congratulations on capturing the demon general," he said.

Despite Nian Yi being a mere Qi Cultivator, Li Yuanjiao treated him with respect and said, "Apologies for the disturbance, fellow Daoist. I am just passing through your sect's territory."

Nian Yi nodded, then grasped a wisp of spiritual qi and slowly closed his eyes, resuming his deduction.

Traveling southward, Li Yuanjiao observed that Xu State was peaceful—a stark contrast to the chaos of years past. There were no signs of devil cultivators, and the cultivators flying about seemed open and unguarded.

The rogue cultivators he encountered were also courteous, congratulating him on capturing the formidable demon.

"Yue Cultivating Sect is truly different," he sighed in amazement.

Li Yuanjiao pressed on until he finally returned to Moongaze Lake. Several Qi Cultivators from the Li Family came to greet him, led by Li Xuanxuan who looked visibly relieved and greeted him warmly, "Jiao'er, you've returned safely!"

This journey proved quite fruitful, and Li Yuanjiao could not help but laugh as he deposited the Hooked Serpent on the shore. He swiftly reinforced several prohibitions, and soon, Li Family cultivators swarmed the area, sealing and setting up a formation to secure the demon.

Returning to the mountain, Li Yuanjiao laid out the treasures acquired from his expedition. Li Qinghong and the others could barely contain their joy and excitement.

The Profound Patterned Bottle and Profound Yang Li Fire were exceptional finds, and capturing a Foundation Establishment Realm serpent demon was indeed a significant achievement. Li Qinghong picked up the Profound Patterned Bottle carefully, admiring it while wistfully thinking, Too bad Big Brother has already named it. It's such a magnificent Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, yet its name sounds like an Embryonic Breathing Realm qi gathering bottle... I guess we'll just have to accept its basic name...

While the group examined the two treasures, an old man came in. He appeared to be over ninety years old, his frame stooped with age. The cultivators kneeled and bowed deeply to him.

Li Qinghong quickly stepped forward to support him while Li Xuanxuan introduced the newcomer.

"This is rogue cultivator Qian... he's ninety-eight years old."

Handing over three storage pouches to the old man, Li Xuanxuan said, "As agreed before, please proceed, Elder."

Old Man Qian nodded and began to inspect the first pouch. He extended his spiritual sense into it, causing the shimmering treasures inside to spill out onto the floor.

Relieved, he opened the second pouch. After verifying its contents without encountering any traps, Li Xuanxuan handed him a Spirit Stone and a smile crossed the old man's face.

Li Yuanjiao observed the proceedings with keen interest, his eyes narrowed slightly as Old Man Qian reached for the third pouch—exceptional-looking and black, previously owned by a daring devil cultivator.

As soon as the old man's spiritual sense reached into it, a burst of black gas erupted. Li Yuanjiao had already anticipated this and readied a spell to counter it. Old Man Qian could only scream in agony before he exploded, now reduced to a mere puddle of blood.

Li Xuanxuan swiftly cast a spell to remove the gruesome remains from the cave dwelling and called out in a calm voice, "Please get Elder Ding in here."

Li Yuanjiao murmured thoughtfully, "It appears to be a shamanic spell or blood art, devised by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... It's capable of eroding both spiritual sense and the body. No wonder an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator couldn't even withstand it for a moment!"

Li Qinghong, who was standing by, shook her head solemnly and asked, "How much for his pension?"

"Three Spirit Stones to be sent to his son. We'll also secure a position for him at the peak."

While Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong conversed, another elderly man approached from below. With a confident expression, he cupped his fist to the three Li Family members and extended his spiritual sense into the delicate black brocade bag. With that, the contents within it finally spilled onto the ground.

Old Man Ding was taken aback.

"I thought it was protected by a shamanic spell!" he exclaimed.

Li Xuanxuan handed over a bag of Spirit Paddies and two clan soldiers promptly escorted the elder away.

Li Qinghong frowned, remarking, "That rogue cultivator's eldest son has attempted to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm with unrefined qi twice, but both attempts ended in failure. He's now pinning his hopes on a single pill."

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao had sorted through numerous items, setting aside the devil cultivator's cultivation technique manuals and pills. He gathered all the spirit items and dharma artifacts of the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms into a storage pouch.

There remained fifty-two Spirit Stones, most of which were looted from the devil cultivator. With a decisive wave, Li Yuanjiao deposited all into the family's vault and gave the leftover items another look, but found them notably unremarkable.

"These trinkets are hardly useful to me now that I've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm," Li Yuanjiao mused, shaking his head as he distributed them away.
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝙤𝓿𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝙤𝓶

With my advancement to Foundation Establishment Realm and the Profound Patterned Bottle to conceal my presence, I needn't fear detection by that pig demon... I can finally venture into the outskirts of Mount Dali and visit the White Banyan Fox.

————

At the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven, atop the tallest Li Fire Peak, a formation was still activated, radiating a golden brilliance as countless mysterious runes continued flowing around. The gathered cultivators from various sects and gates remained silent.

"Attack!" Chi Zhiyun commanded, who was standing at the center in his shining green Daoist robe, his sword emitting a white glow.

At his casual order, disciples from three sects and seven gates immediately unleashed their spells and activated their dharma artifacts against the grand formation.

The formation was already fragile and the efforts of numerous Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators soon brought it to the brink of collapse. It withstood their assaults for another hour before finally releasing a blinding golden flash and dissolving completely.

As the cultivators erupted into cheers and prepared to swarm forward, a figure emerged from the formation. Wearing a red Hornless Dragon mask and wielding a long spear, the imposing figure laughed heartily.

"Thank you for aiding in the destruction of this formation, fellow Daoists. I shall gracefully accept this Dongli Dao Collection as a gift!" Chu Yi declared, his politeness tinged with unmistakable ridicule.

With a flick of his hand, he unleashed a talisman as someone from below shouted, "Purple Mansion Realm Talisman, Void Origin Escape Talisman!"

With a booming laugh, Chu Yi vanished into the void, leaving the crowd of stunned cultivators behind.

The cultivators were furious, feeling betrayed, yet they also questioned why the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had not intervened. Chi Zhiyun, outwardly seething in the center of the group, secretly sneered after the man departed.

Why didn't the Daoist Masters act? If Yuansu and Qiushui had coveted this Dao Collection and attempted to intercept him, not only would they risk offending Mount Luoxia, but they might also fail to stop him. Suffering humiliation and departing with crushed pride are the best outcomes for them... If the True Monarch of Mount Luoxia took offense, it wouldn't be beyond him to strike down the Daoist Masters on the spot!

Chi Zhiyun then rose on the wind, directing people among the three sects and seven gates to enter in their pre-arranged order.

He landed atop the mountain and gazed at the deserted attic, thinking to himself, The Dongli Sect... The two peak Daoist Masters of the Purple Mansion Realm from Dongli's Eastern Fire Heaven Grotto ended up dying with their sect destroyed... with their Dao lineage absorbed by Luoxia.

In the great void, Daoist Masters Yuan Su and Qiushui watched him depart but did nothing to stop him. They remained silent, watching him leave and until the crowd in the grotto heaven thinned.

"That's enough," Yuan Su finally said, feeling the fluctuations in the great void subside before stepping out and entering the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven. Daoist Master Qiushui followed and remarked softly, "True to his Metallic Essence, Chu Yi is barely holding on after just three years... Judging by his appearance, he's likely to burst and die soon."

Yuan Su quietly agreed, his gaze lifting to the sky, which seemed veiled in a layer of gray mist. Dark light drifted about, and scarcely a figure was visible.

The atmosphere within the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven grew increasingly somber, and the disciples from various sects, having profited, withdrew one by one. Only the two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the immortal sects remained aloft, observing the dim world below.

"Chu Yi has taken the Dongli Dao Collection," Daoist Master Yuan Su remarked calmly, poised in the air. The golden spring water beneath his feet continued to surge, its brilliance muted by his dim surroundings.

"What a pitiful man," Daoist Master Qiushui added quietly, but Yuan Su responded with a wry smile and said, "We are not in the position to feel sorry for a True Monarch. Cui Mu gambled and miscalculated, ruining the Bright Yang Dao Lineage... He brought this end upon himself."

Daoist Master Qiushui's sleeves fluttered gently as she responded softly, "Mount Luoxia has oppressed Bright Yang for five hundred years, and now it has seized Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven. If this continues for another five centuries, perhaps it will be Huangtian of Ancient Wei that falls next, paving the way for Mount Luoxia to nurture another True Monarch—or even an Exalted Immortal. Everyone in the region merely watches... isn't anyone going to do something about this?"

Daoist Master Yuan Su listened, his expression a mix of both amusement and contemplation as he toyed with a small golden seal. Smiling, he teased, "Wasn't your Golden Feather Sect most loyal to them, even referring to them as the Luoxia Upper Sect? Yet... your remarks don't align with your sect's loyalty. Your ever-changing stance is truly vexing!"

"Tiaoxiao!" Qiushui sighed, her face colored with slight embarrassment as she continued, "Immortal or mortal, no one finds servility appealing... No need to take it too seriously."

Yuan Su shook his head and replied, "I know, I know... I only say that to you."

Daoist Master Qiushui waved her slender hand, causing the golden spring water on the ground to splash up into her grasp. She said softly, "You and I need not concern ourselves further with this. Let's head north to Yue Cultivation Sect and Lotus Temple; let them handle the rest."

"Once this is over, the yang will fade from heaven and earth, and yin will find its balance, ushering in the Profound Balance Atmosphere. It will soon be time for Shangyuan's breakthrough. By then, you and I will have much to do."

Daoist Master Yuan Su stood with his hands clasped behind him as he watched her gather the spirit water before speaking again.

"Buzi has journeyed to the Eastern Sea, Yuan Xiu to the southern border, and Yuanwu is focusing on his own opportunities. What you suggest about troubling Junior Brother sounds fine in theory, but how many Purple Mansion Realm artifacts has Yuanwu Peak actually produced? I haven't seen him contribute anything substantial. I'm the only one who has my cultivation severed and is busy running around."

Daoist Master Qiushui smiled slightly and responded, "I'm pretty sure you will be rewarded for all this trouble!"

A flicker of irritation crossed Yuan Su's face as he replied, "It's only here in Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven that I can speak freely... Those in Azure Pond Grotto Heaven are used to ordering others around. Whether their approach is effective is debatable, but one thing is for sure—their methods lack purity."




# Chapter 458: Return For A Visit

Liu Changdie soared through the skies toward Mount Dali, fully propelled by the wind. However, a beam of light from the south intercepted his path before it could reach Mount Qingdu, forcing him to come to a sudden halt.

An Zheyan, who had been patrolling for some time, stopped Liu Changdie by the lake. "Who goes there?" he called out.

Although An Zheyan was a Qi Cultivator of the eighth heavenly layer and capable of handling most rogue cultivators, the aura of this person made him feel rather uneasy.

The man in question had an unassuming appearance but was at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Despite his youthful appearance, looking no older than thirty, his clothes were of fine quality. He cupped his fist, channeling his mana, and replied respectfully, "Liu Changdie has come to visit. Please..."

But before he could finish, a clear, melodious voice interrupted them.

"Daoist Changdie?"

Liu Changdie turned to see a striking figure—a heroic face with a pair of bright almond eyes, clad in jade armor and wielding a silver spear. He was momentarily stunned, then quickly cupped his fist again.
𝕗𝕣𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝚋𝚗𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹.𝚌𝕠𝚖

"Ah... it's you, Daoist Qinghong!"

As he lowered his head, he thought to himself, She is truly a beauty... I never had the chance to see her in my previous life. I only heard she had committed suicide on Mount Yuting. With such demeanor and appearance, it's no wonder she caught the eyes of the Lotus Temple's Master Monk.

Li Qinghong, familiar with the strange reputation of this visitor, was not at all surprised by his reaction. Smiling, she said, "Follow me into the mountain, fellow Daoist!"

An Zheyan allowed him to pass, cupping his fist before quietly retreating.

Liu Changdie followed her into the mountain. In the hall, two figures awaited—one old and frail, the other middle-aged but pale.

Li Yuanping was discussing clan affairs with his father, Li Xuanxuan, and greeted Liu Changdie warmly.

Liu Changdie responded with a respectful nod, his face lighting up as he thought, It's a relief to see both Li Qinghong and Li Yuanping still alive. At least Yuanjiao won't be alone on Mount Wutu... drinking by himself all the time as he did in my previous life!

Li Xuanxuan smiled, inviting him to sit. After a brief conversation, he leaned in and whispered, "How much do you know about the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven?"

Liu Changdie sighed deeply and replied, "It's a dismal place. Soon, more rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea will be able to enter... Striving for it is merely laboring to the benefit of the three sects and seven gates!"

Liu Changdie, having lived two lives now, had only seen the true nature of the three sects and seven gates just before his death in his previous life.

Naturally, he was averse to the idea of going to the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven.

"Fellow Daoist, you have keen insight!" Li Xuanxuan said approvingly and then asked, "Do you know if the Dao Collection from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven has been leaked?"

Li Xuanxuan was deeply concerned about this. The Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual in their clan was closely related to the ancient Wei Kingdom, and since Dongli Sect was also a descendant of the Wei Kingdom, he was particularly anxious to know about the matter.

Liu Changdie, lacking specific information, relied on his memories from his previous life and replied gravely, "The Dongli Dao Collection had been taken by Chu Yi. There is nothing particularly good or bad about it, just that the Grade Two and Three external cultivation techniques from the Dongli Sect, mostly related to the Golden Yang, had been dispersed out there. They might be useful to the rogue cultivators though."

Li Xuanxuan was pleased with this news. "Good, good!" he said with an approving nod.

He had been worried about being unable to explain the origin of his family's Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual. Now that the Golden Yang-related techniques had been scattered out there, it could hide their family's Radiant Origin Pass immortal foundation better.

Since none of the three sects obtained the Dao Collection, they likely did not possess Purple Mansion Realm cultivation techniques. Naturally, there were no disciples practicing such techniques, let alone pose a threat to his immortal foundation.

Moreover, in the future, we might be able to collect more techniques from this lineage, allowing for mutual verification and further advancement in cultivation.

Perhaps one day, the mirror might bestow upon us Purple Mansion Realm cultivation techniques... Once a Purple Mansion emerges from our family, this type of cultivation technique will come in handy!

With these promising prospects ahead, Li Xuanxuan felt quite pleased.

————

Li Yuanjiao rode the wind toward Mount Dali, flying past many mountains until a majestic white banyan tree appeared beneath him. He descended gracefully among the trees before landing on a soft carpet of grass and stowed away the Profound Patterned Bottle.

The area was devoid of any demonic presence. Golden sunlight filtered through the treetops, casting a warm and inviting glow all around the place.

He squinted slightly, surveying the clean slope that lacked even a single fallen leaf. Aware that the fox might be hiding nearby, he cupped his fist and called out respectfully, "Yuanjiao of the Li Family has come to pay his respects to the senior... Please reveal yourself!"

Li Yuanjiao waited patiently until a reddish demonic wind finally swirled into existence, revealing a fox half the height of a man. It stood not far from him, its dark eyes fixated on him warily.

Though much smaller now, the fox was at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist respectfully again and said, "Congratulations on your cultivation progress, Senior."

The fox lowered its head slightly and replied from a distance, "This progress is nothing compared to yours. Establishing a foundation in just a few decades is quite remarkable, even among humans."

Li Yuanjiao responded modestly to the praise, noting the fox's wariness toward him. He set down a bag of Spirit Paddies and continued humbly, "I've come to seek your advice on a matter, Senior."

"I've captured a Hooked Serpent. First, I wish to know if it's possible to tame this demon creature for my family's use... Second, I've heard that the Hooked Serpent is a sea demon. Does it have any significant background?"

The fox scrutinized him closely before replying, "The art of spiritual control is a closely guarded secret of the Demon Den. If you wish to tame it, you'll have to seek help from the Demon King of the Demon Den. However, you should perish the thought..."

"As for the Hooked Serpent, to trace their background, we'd have to delve into the primordial era. The tales of this creature are well-known, though they could only be regarded as mere stories."

The fox continued, "In the primordial era, the Hooked Serpents had a Demon Palace in the Eastern Sea. They followed the ways of Feathered Serpents and disregarded Serpent Dragon's commands. Eventually, the palace was destroyed by the Converging Water True Hornless Dragon... Their kind then wandered the sea, and thus, they lack a significant background."

Li Yuanjiao listened intently as the fox relaxed slightly and added, "In that battle, the Pristine Water Feathered Serpent was devoured by the Hornless Dragon. Seven years later, it gave birth to nine sons, who in turn devoured Hornless Dragon... The Pristine Water and Converging Water had been locked in conflict ever since. Presently, Pristine Water resides in the inland sea while Converging Water is out there, bringing a fragile peace."

Eager for more information, Li Yuanjiao was met with silence. The fox merely concluded his story by saying simply, "In short, the Hooked Serpent is not particularly formidable, and there are many such creatures in the seas."

Li Yuanjiao pressed on with a few more questions, but the fox remained tight-lipped. Reluctantly, he shifted topics.

"Senior, can we do something about the Foundation Establishment Realm pig demon in the mountains?" he asked.

The pig demon had been entrenched near the Li Family's territory for a century, and Li Yuanjiao had never forgotten about it. With the formation plate now in his possession, he began to have a few ideas formulating in his mind.

"That stupid big guy..."

The fox demon seemed like it wanted to comment more but stopped itself before saying, "You can kill it as long as you lure it out of Mount Dali. It's not a big deal if it dies outside. You can gather some spirit items and Spirit Stones, and I'll handle the den for you. Everything will be fine!"

"My only concern is it being a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. If you fail to kill it, it might return to the den and bring reinforcements which could spell trouble for your family."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, understanding the situation. He asked a few more questions, but seeing that the fox demon was disinterested, he cupped his fist and took his leave.

As Li Yuanjiao departed on the wind, the fox demon sighed with relief, reclining lazily under the tree.

That child is exceptionally talented, cautious, and a bit more ruthless than Tongya... Less generous, too. Tongya probably made a good choice handing over the clan to him...

The fox demon then took out a piece of white quartz from its fur and murmured softly,

"Li Yuanjiao has established his foundation!"

Li Yuanjiao flew out from Mount Dali with a plan already in his mind.

This senior fox demon is an ally of my family, so it probably won't deceive me. I bet it's no ordinary fox demon, given how knowledgeable it is!

When he descended on the mountain earlier, he had activated the Profound Patterned Bottle. That should have allowed him to remain undetected by even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, provided he kept his distance. Yet, the fox had detected him early and gone into hiding, leaving not even a trace beneath the banyan tree.

A Qi Cultivation Realm fox demon managed to detect me so quickly and escaped without leaving a trace... What was that all about? That felt too deliberate... Was it trying to warn me?

He stroked his chin and speculated, "This must have something to do with the Demon Den of Mount Dali!"

I wonder how the ancestor became acquainted with this demon fox... Xiao Chuting is convinced that my family has a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Perhaps it's related to Mount Dali's attitude...

Li Yuanjiao turned these thoughts over in his mind but had no solid clues. His focus then shifted back to the pig demon. Upon returning to the peak, he saw Li Qinghong conversing with another cultivator.

As Li Yuanjiao approached, the cultivator quickly rose and greeted him with a smile.

"Brother Yuanjiao! It's been a long time!"

Li Yuanjiao was momentarily surprised before a smile appeared on his face.

"Ah, It's you, Brother Changdie!"

Liu Changdie, now at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, continued smiling warmly.

"I haven't seen you in years, Brother. I never expected you to establish your foundation so soon!" he said.

Secretly, Liu Changdie felt a pang of disappointment.

I did not expect that Yuanjiao's cultivation would progress so rapidly in this life... Even if I started a new life, I wouldn't match his speed. How can the gap between two humans be this enormous?!

Li Yuanjiao responded modestly to his praise but his mind was preoccupied with the formation at Qingdu Peak.

The formation at Qingdu Peak hasn't been set up yet. Now that Liu Changdie is here, we can finally get it done! Uncle Xuanfeng hasn't been back for so many years now, this is also a good opportunity to ask for his news...

The two men settled into their seats, and Li Yuanjiao began with a smile, "I heard you went to Yi Mountain City. Have you heard any news about my uncle, Li Xuanfeng?"

Liu Changdie cupped his fist and replied, "Of course! Congratulations, Brother! Senior Xuanfeng and fellow Daoist Ning Hemian have married and are now highly respected. Their reputation in the city is soaring!"

As soon as Liu Changdie spoke, Li Yuanjiao was taken aback and Li Qinghong looked stunned, while Li Xuanxuan frowned. However, it was not appropriate for them to discuss anything in the presence of an outsider, so the room fell silent.

Li Qinghong quickly recovered and exclaimed, "This is indeed great news! Thank you for sharing it with us, fellow Daoist!"

Liu Changdie dared not comment anything and remained quiet. As someone who had lived two lives, even he could sense that something was amiss. With a smile, he retrieved a storage pouch and a letter from his chest pocket, explaining, "This is what Senior asked me to bring back..."

Li Yuanjiao thanked him and took the items, setting them aside before asking, "With your current cultivation, are you able to set up a Foundation Establishment Realm formation, Brother?"

The Li Family's legacies now encompassed formations, talismans, and alchemy. However, their expertise was limited to setting up formations at the Embryonic Breathing level. While they possessed numerous Qi Cultivation Realm formation diagrams, setting up one was challenging, especially when compared to Liu Changdie's proficiency. Consequently, setting up a Foundation Establishment Realm formation was far beyond their current capabilities.

The most highly skilled talisman crafter was Li Xuanxuan. Unfortunately, his disciples and clansmen only succeeded in making Embryonic Breathing Realm talismans which frustrated Li Xuanxuan to no end.

The arts of Immortal Cultivation required considerable talent, and within the main family, only Li Xuanxuan and Li Ximing exhibited notable skill.

Liu Changdie nodded, looking slightly embarrassed, and replied, "I have made significant progress in restoring formations in Yi Mountain City over the years. If there is a formation diagram, I can give it a try, though it will be costly if I fail..."

Foundation Establishment Realm formations were rare, and Liu Changdie, being an average formation master, would find setting up one a rare opportunity.

He added eagerly, "If your esteemed clan can offer me this opportunity, I can contribute some materials myself! The cost would be around four or five hundred Spirit Stones."

That's ten years worth of tribute...

The price left everyone stunned. The Li Family's maximum annual revenue was only forty Spirit Stones, barely covering the tribute they had to submit. Their savings came primarily from the Ebony Mine and Wanglin Blossoms, accumulating to only thirteen or fourteen Spirit Stones a year.

If they proceed, it would take forty to fifty years to afford the formation.

Although the recent defeat of the devil cultivators brought in significant income, the family still has only fifty to sixty Spirit Stones in reserve, and that is not at all enough for such an expenditure.

Everyone fell silent. Liu Changdie, realizing the situation, shrank back and remained quiet.

After a pause, Li Yuanjiao responded, "That's quite expensive... My family can't afford it right now. It might be better to use a Qi Cultivation Realm formation for the time being."

Liu Changdie nodded quickly and said, "I will check the earth vein and spiritual energy distribution in the mountains and set up the formation in a few days."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement. He exchanged a few more words with Liu Changdie, and then watched him leave.

"Jiao'er!"

As soon as Liu Changdie departed, Li Xuanxuan looked uneasy as he wondered aloud, "What is Yuan Su plotting against our family...?"

There was no such thing as a free lunch in this world. Li Xuanfeng's sudden promotion and marriage into Daoist Master Yuan Su's family raised concerns. The old man muttered for a while and asked, "W-What is Xuanfeng thinking?!"

Li Yuanjiao took out the letter brought back by Liu Changdie, decrypted it using the family's secret technique, and read it carefully.

He soon frowned in puzzlement and murmured, "Li's bloodline of Wei?"

Handing the letter over to the others, Li Yuanjiao pondered its contents. The letter mentioned Yuan Su's attitude toward the family and his own speculations of a few things he had heard there. The letter was ten pages long.

Everyone read the letter carefully. Li Qinghong vaguely felt it was good news and shared her views.

"Since Yuan Su mistakenly believes our family to be of the Li Family of Wei, we might be able to cover up the matter of the spiritual orifice. However, it seems he may want to do something with his own bloodline."

Initially, Yuan Su had only casually promoted Li Xuanfeng. Upon learning that they were the descendants of the Li Family of Wei State, he decided to form an alliance with the Li Family through marriage. This led the four of them to speculate that his intention might be related to their bloodline.

Li Yuanjiao thought deeply but had too little information to make a definitive guess. He reviewed the storage pouch, noting that Li Xuanfeng had sent back thirty Spirit Stones and an Essence Gathering Pill.

Li Yuanjiao took out a jade bottle and poured its contents out. It was a gray pill with intricate patterns on it.

"I knew it'd be a blood pill..." he said with a sigh.

Although Li Qinghong was preparing to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, this blood pill was unsuitable for her.

Li Yuanjiao considered for a moment and concluded, This pill may not be usable, but it's still extremely valuable. Selling it at a great price could be as beneficial as using it for further cultivation!




# Chapter 460: Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique

Liu Changdie had long been immersed in the art of formations. Despite only performing two rounds of assessments, he could clearly discern the distribution of the earth veins. His eyes shone with a perceptive light, revealing his clarity and insight.

This perception technique, known as the Spirit Eye Perception, was from the Li Family, though no one within the family had yet to master it.

Liu Changdie possessed a wealth of formation skills that allowed him to earn plenty of Spirit Stones with them. Even without a family to support him, he traveled across the state, searching for spirit water, and it took just over a decade for him to master this perception technique.

After a thorough study, Liu Changdie chose the Green Ox River Embrace Formation, a recent addition to his repertoire. This formation, which he developed in Linghai Prefecture, harnessed the power of the lake water around Mount Qingdu, combining it with the earth and water veins to repel enemies.

Breaking this formation would be a prolonged endeavor without the power of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would struggle to breach it within an hour, making it a superior Qi Cultivation Realm formation indeed.

Formations from Linghai Prefecture often incorporated shamanic spells, adding offensive capabilities to their defensive functions. The Green Ox River Embrace Formation was no exception; it could summon a Green Ox with mana to attack intruders.

Li Yuanjiao was pleased with the formation and inquired further. The Green Ox River Embrace Formation required a substantial amount of Ebony Ores, which the Li Family conveniently possessed, thus saving them some Spirit Stones. Ultimately, the cost would amount to only a hundred Spirit Stones.

"Brother Changdie, you're too generous!" Li Yuanjiao said, frowning. If the cost were truly fixed at a hundred Spirit Stones, his family would owe Liu Changdie a favor. So, he insisted on giving Liu Changdie 115 Spirit Stones which Liu reluctantly accepted.

Liu Changdie stayed for several months while the formation was set up on Mount Qingdu. Kong Yu had mentioned that small peaks would emerge near Qingdu Mountain over the next few years, so Li Yuanjiao made sure the formation's coverage was huge enough to accommodate those peaks as well.

After a drink to celebrate the project's completion, Liu Changdie stayed for another half a month before heading north to the Yue Cultivating Sect's territory to continue his study on formations and seek breakthroughs.

Despite Lu Changdie's eagerness to remain with the Li Family as a guest cultivator, Li Yuanjiao was hesitant to let him stay permanently due to the mysteries surrounding him. Handling the situation diplomatically, Li Yuanjiao, along with Li Qinghong, escorted Liu Changdie out of their territory.

Liu Changdie, reluctant to leave, bade his goodbyes to Li Yuanjiao though he was sighing inwardly.

Alas, we have been together for more than ten years, and the Li Family still doesn't fully trust me given how wary they have always been...

With a heavy heart, he flew out of Moongaze Lake, heading north.

After seeing him off, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong flew over the lake but were approached by a monk with narrow eyes. He clasped his hands together and said to Li Yuanjiao, "Congratulations on establishing your immortal foundation, fellow Daoist."

This monk was none other than Kongheng, who had aided the Li family during the devil plague and continued his cultivation on the lake. Though his motives were unclear, the Li Family remained grateful to him.

Li Yuanjiao replied warmly, "Thank you, Master."

Kongheng nodded, then addressed Li Qinghong.

"When I was traveling the world, I heard of a peak on the Mushroom Forest Plain named Heavenly Thunder Peak. If you're looking to make a breakthrough, you might find it helpful to cultivate in seclusion there."

With that, Kongheng excused himself and floated back to the lake. He rolled up the ends of his trousers and lowered his bald head, then began digging for lotus roots on the shore. His technique was unusual and the fact that he was rarely cultivating in seclusion suggested that he might be facing a bottleneck.

The siblings were puzzled and continued on their journey. Li Qinghong whispered, "What is that monk trying to say?"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head, skepticism evident in his voice as he replied, "Who knows?"

Li Qinghong paused before suggesting, "Let's send someone to investigate. If it's feasible, it might be worth a try."

"Mushroom Forest Plain is within the Yuan Family's territory. If what the monk said is true, we should speak to the Yuan Family. A breakthrough on that peak could be beneficial..."

The two of them returned to the peak and dispatched someone to inquire with the Yuan Family. While Li Qinghong went off to cultivate and meditate, Li Yuanjiao took out the Foundation Establishment Realm formation plate from his storage pouch and began to contemplate the situation with the pig demon on Mount Dali.

Eliminating this demon would allow us to request the white talisman for Ximing and Xijun, as well as free up the northern foothills for qi and herbs gathering, thus improving the family's situation.

Li Yuanjiao waited several days before finally receiving a reply from the Yuan Family. In fact, Yuan Huyuan came in person himself.

Yuan Huyuan, a peak Qi Cultivator, had a complex expression on his face. It was tinged with a hint of shame as he gazed blankly at Li Yuanjiao and mumbled, "You've actually reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

Li Yuanjiao was puzzled by his huge reaction and simply replied slowly, "Yuanjiao greets Senior..."

He could not fully grasp the depth of Yuan Huyuan's shock.

When Yuan Huyuan first arrived at Moongaze Lake, Li Chejing was only at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and Li Tongya had not even broken through the Jade Capital Stage.

When Li Chejing became a sword immortal and Li Tongya established his immortal foundation, Yuan Huyuan was already amazed. The sight of Li Yuanjiao, a junior, now reaching the Foundation Establishment, left this old man astounded.

After several attempts to call Yuan Huyuan's attention, the elder finally came to his senses and sighed.

"I've hesitated too long... I kept waiting for the right opportunity, wasting years, and ended up like this!"

With renewed determination, Yuan Huyuan quietly resolved to himself, I shall attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm once I return!

Having made up his mind, Yuan Huyuan's demeanor shifted. He smiled, cupping his fist as he said, "Congratulations on your breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, fellow Daoist!"

After exchanging a few words with Li Yuanjiao, Yuan Huyuan said, "I have investigated as you requested. There is indeed a peak on the Mushroom Forest Plain named Heavenly Thunder Peak. The peak is struck by lightning annually due to a thunder mine located there, and as a result, the entire mountain has been scorched black."

"There are very few thunder cultivators in Jiangnan, and my family hadn't considered that location until now. Otherwise, we would have informed you sooner..." he added.

Though Yuan Huyuan's words were courteous, Li Yuanjiao did not take them too seriously. He nodded in agreement and resolved the matter in his heart.

Once we deal with the pig demon, I'll send Qinghong to the Mushroom Forest Plain to cultivate in seclusion!

After Yuan Huyuan had explained everything, he presented a few modest spirit items as a gesture of goodwill. Li Yuanjiao naturally understood his intention and responded warmly. The two exchanged a few more words before Yuan Huyuan smiled and said, "You're too kind, junior. It's reassuring to see your family thriving."

As Yuan Huyuan prepared to leave, Li Yuanjiao escorted him out and thought to himself quietly, This pig demon is at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm... I can't handle it alone. I need to find a helper.

Li Yuanjiao initially wanted to delay this until Li Qinghong successfully completed her breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Then, he planned to invite another person to join them in dealing with the demon.

However, it was hard to find a Foundation Establishment Realm formation plate and he had no idea when Kong Tingyun would send someone to retrieve it. Without the formation, even four or five people might struggle to subdue the pig demon.

After some contemplation, Li Yuanjiao considered asking the Xiao Family for assistance. However, he was reluctant to appear overly dependent on them.

Uncle Xuanfeng also requested an Essence Gathering Pill. Although it's refined with humans and we have sworn not to consume it, it could be used to recruit help! There might be room for further negotiation for additional items as well.

Glancing at Yuan Huyuan, Li Yuanjiao inquired cautiously, "Senior, are you planning to attempt breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm?"

"Your guess is correct," Yuan Huyuan replied with a soft smile as he continued, "At my age, being ridiculed by the younger generation is unbearable... I must try for the Foundation Establishment Realm before this life ends!"

Li Yuanjiao continued asking further in concern, "Senior, do you have any special techniques or pills to aid in your breakthrough...?"

Yuan Huyuan hesitated for a moment before nodding slowly and replying, "Yes, the Yuan Family does. We have special secret techniques, formulas, and pills that complement each other, making it possible to achieve the breakthrough with only half the required effort."

As a century-old prestigious clan, the Yuan Family was naturally wealthy. Li Yuanjiao listened and nodded.

"I've heard that the Essence Gathering Pill can aid in achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm. Does your clan have it prepared?" he asked with a serious look.

Yuan Huyuan sighed softly as he raised his eyebrows, then replied vaguely, "Essence Gathering Pills are not ordinary pills..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly. Sensing that Li Yuanjiao seemed to know something, Yuan Huyuan decided to speak frankly.

"Ordinary pills wouldn't allow Golden Feather and Azure Pond to maintain control for so long. There are various ways to refine Essence Gathering Pills... Some can assist in achieving breakthroughs with less than just half the effort. Unfortunately, my family does not possess it."

"If you need it, my family can provide one."

Li Yuanjiao offered, transmitting his voice with his mana.

Yuan Huyuan was caught off guard. His expression changed drastically, and he hesitated for several breaths before asking slowly, "Qinghong is preparing for a breakthrough too... won't she need it?"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head with a smile and replied, "You worry too much, Senior. My family has already made arrangements for her."

Yuan Huyuan, tempted by the offer, nodded thoughtfully and asked nervously, "May I see the quality of the pill?"

Feeling confident enough to handle a peak Qi Cultivator like Yuan Huyuan if something went awry now that he was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Li Yuanjiao produced a jade bottle. He inverted it and a pill floated out from within it.

The pill was white with gray patterns on it, emitting a captivating aroma. Yuan Huyuan's eyes sparkled at the sight of it as he exclaimed, "Excellent! Truly excellent!"

He quickly asked, "What do you want in exchange, fellow Daoist?"
𝙛𝒓𝓮𝙚𝔀𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Li Yuanjiao considered the options but could not think of an immediate need for his family, so he simply responded, "What can you offer in return, Senior?"

Yuan Huyuan was pleased to see that Li Yuanjiao was not being fussy. He patted his chest and assured, "Cultivation techniques, medicine, dharma artifacts...my family has plenty. I can also help you acquire any of them through our sect connections if needed!"

Yuan Huyuan struggled to determine Li Yuanjiao's needs and requirements since he refused to speak. Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes, thought for a moment, and then asked, "Are you able to obtain Heavenly Pure Essence, fellow Daoist?"

Heavenly Pure Essence was a highly prized spirit water. Not only was it an excellent healing medicine, but it could also purify true essence, alter Dao foundations, and elevate various unrefined Qi Cultivators to proper Qi Cultivators.

The Li Family did not have unrefined Qi Cultivators who needed this spirit water, but since Li Qinghong's secret technique formed the Profound Thunderpool, Li Yuanjiao wanted to find this essence to further enhance her Dao foundation.

After making this request, Li Yuanjiao remembered that the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique was also modified. Altering her Dao foundation might severe her cultivation path.

Yuan Huyuan shook his head and replied, "Fellow Daoist, you overestimate my capabilities! Heavenly Pure Essence is a water essence of the Purple Mansion Realm... Only the three sects might have it. If any of the ancestors had acquired such a purifying essence, they would have used it themselves rather than leaving it for future generations."

Li Yuanjiao could only abandon the request and inquired, "Does your family have a method to capture and subdue spirit beasts or demon creatures then?"

Li Yuanjiao was still considering the Hooked Serpent, which was a rare Foundation Establishment Realm combat force. Taming such a creature without significant backing was appealing, and the cold qi it released could assist those cultivating the Slaughter Jun Kui Light, making it a tempting prospect.

Yuan Huyuan was taken aback by the unusual request and asked, "Is it for a small demon or a demon general?"

Li Yuanjiao was excited to see that Yuan Huyuan seemed to have a solution and responded eagerly, "A demon general! A Foundation Establishment Realm demon!"

Yuan Huyuan thought carefully before saying, "My family does have a method, but it's quite difficult."

"Oh?"

Li Yuanjiao's curiosity was piqued instantly.

Yuan Huyuan explained, "My ancestor once traveled far to the north and inherited a legacy from a temple known as the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique. It's a Grade Four technique capable of suppressing demons and controlling spirits... However, this method has two major drawbacks."

Yuan Huyuan shook his head and continued, "First, this method is very costly to use. It requires six types of precious spirit items for the ritual. In the past, this cost ninety Spirit Stones for a single casting, but now, with the materials being more expensive due to the distance from the north, you might need up to a hundred Spirit Stones."

"Second, the method requires a life-matching object, which must be significantly more powerful than the demon. Otherwise, not only will the spirit items be wasted, but the life-matching object will also be consumed."

Yuan Huyuan then added, somewhat awkwardly, "My family can't obtain the Purple Mansion Realm spirit medicine, so we had to use a Foundation Establishment Realm panacea instead. It took two pieces to succeed, costing a total of about seven or eight hundred Spirit Stones. Since then, my family has lost interest, and only very few still use this method for taming demons."

If the Li Family were not also a prestigious clan with whom they had a strong relationship and expected many future exchanges, Yuan Huyuan would not have been so honest. He would have just handed over the technique and called it a day.

"I see," Li Yuanjiao said, putting on a troubled look on his face. Although his heart raced with excitement, he deliberately lamented on, "Oh... Why must it be so difficult to tame a demon?"

Yuan Huyuan shook his head, sharing the sentiment.

Secret techniques are unlike elixirs or dharma artifacts. Once given, it's no different than leaking the family's legacy. It won't be easy to get the ancestor's approval, so it might be better to make him give up on this idea.

Noticing Yuan Huyuan's expression, Li Yuanjiao decided to push forward. With a resolute look on his face, he said, "My home is close to Mount Dali... Finding a treasured panacea won't be a significant issue. I'll trade this pill for that secret technique!"

Yuan Huyuan had no choice but to nod.

Li Yuanjiao then added, "But this secret technique alone is not enough."

Yuan Huyuan, looking troubled, asked, "What else do you need, fellow Daoist?"

"Two methods for collecting cold qi, different from the method used in my family," he answered.

Yuan Huyuan shook his head and said, "We can only provide one. Qi gathering methods are clan secrets. We can give you one that is not rare, but we can't offer more than that."

"Understood!" Li Yuanjiao smiled and continued, "However, I will need your help to arrange for a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from your family to assist in capturing a Foundation Establishment Realm demon so I can use this secret technique."

Yuan Huyuan was slightly taken aback but, upon seeing Li Yuanjiao's sincere expression, he nodded in agreement.

"That won't be a problem. I'll have a cultivator from my family assist with that."




# Chapter 462: Muyun of Mount Yu

Li Yuanjiao followed Yuan Huyuan to Mushroom Forest Plain. Yuan Huyuan led him to the mountain's summit, then excused himself to return to his clan to discuss the trade.

Li Yuanjiao waited on the summit for a while. During this time, he conversed with a direct descendant of the Yuan Family, a Qi Cultivator. The decent-looking young man was a good conversationalist, but Li Yuanjiao's responses were distracted and vague as his mind was preoccupied with skepticism.

Hooked Serpent...unique life matching technique from north...

He tapped lightly on the table with his fingers, feeling uneasy. Noticing Li Yuanjiao's preoccupation, the Yuan Family member fell silent, not daring to interrupt his thoughts. Li Yuanjiao took the time to piece together his thoughts with a rather unpleasant look on his face.

With the Purple Mansion Realm's divine ability and tangled fates, everything seems suspicious... I need to thoroughly understand the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique before returning to investigate the Hooked Serpent again.

When Yuan Huyuan returned, Li Yuanjiao greeted him with a forced smile and asked eagerly, "Senior, how did it go?"

Yuan Huyuan swung his sleeve and replied with a grin, "All good."

Yuan Huyuan, being from the same lineage as Yuan Tuan, held significant sway within the Yuan Family. Despite being a Qi Cultivator, he had long overseen the family's affairs.

He presented two jade slips, explaining, "This is the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique. Read through it carefully, fellow Daoist! The other slip contains the required cold qi gathering method. Let me know if you already have this at home."

Li Yuanjiao examined the jade slips. The core content was sealed with a secret art, leaving only the information in front and at the end of it accessible. After reading it for a moment, he began, "Senior, I have a few questions."

Yuan Huyuan, who was lost in thought, was startled by Li Yuanjiao's intense gaze and responded quickly, "What is it?"

"The Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique only mentions the loss of the spirit items if the spell fails, but not the fate of the demon creature. Since your esteemed family has performed this ritual many times, do you mind sharing it with me?"

Yuan Huyuan was taken aback by the question and then offered a rueful smile as he replied, "At best, it might be injured and suffer a shortened lifespan; at worst, it could result in death..."

Li Yuanjiao's smile faded slightly as he remarked, "This technique is indeed quite... costly to use."

Li Yuanjiao appeared slightly displeased on the surface, but inwardly, he was both relieved and satisfied.

The technique appealed to him greatly, not merely because of the Hooked Serpent it could tame. While the prospects of having a Foundation Establishment Realm ally were indeed enticing and the cold qi gathering method was useful for his family, these were only secondary concerns.

In Li Yuanjiao's view, the primary benefit of this technique was its ability to conceal his family's frequent captures of live demon creatures. The Li Family had long sought after a similar technique for this very reason.

After all, we often capture monsters alive for sacrifices. They disappear after being brought to the mountain, which might be alright once or twice, but if it becomes a pattern, it will be difficult to avoid suspicion if someone decides to investigate.

With this spell, we can openly capture monsters and bring them back to the mountain. After the sacrifice, I can simply claim that the ritual failed...

Moreover, Li Yuanjiao understood that the Yuan Family had failed several times in the past because they could not find a suitable Purple Mansion Realm spirit item, and resorted to using Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items.

Putting aside the seemingly endless supply of Supreme Yin Moonlight of unknown grade, the secret chamber at home was also filled with golden-white osmanthus and moonlit orchid grass when the immortal mirror reacted to Yu Muxian's presence in Moongaze Lake.

Though the Li Family could not identify the grade of these spirit items, they still collected and stored them away. Despite their lack of knowledge about proper preservation methods which caused the item to gradually deteriorate, there were still many pieces left in the Purple Mansion Realm jade box.

With confidence in his heart, Li Yuanjiao immediately asked, "What is the origin of this technique, Senior? If it is some secret technique of unknown origin or an offensive nature, I wouldn't dare to use it."

Li Yuanjiao had a guess in mind, but Yuan Huyuan, noticing his expression, felt guilty for withholding certain information and looked rather awkward. Upon hearing Li Yuanjiao's question, Yuan Huyuan quickly answered, "This Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique was acquired by my ancestor from the northern Yanyang Temple. After obtaining this legacy, he rose to prominence and eventually established the Yuan Family. That was approximately..."

Yuan Huyuan counted on his fingers and finished his sentence, "I would say 1,600 years ago."

1,600 years?!

Li Yuanjiao repeated this number incredulously in his heart.

Yuan Huyuan then elaborated, "My ancestor was fortunate enough to establish a Dao lineage, but it was a dark age. The ancient Wei State had fallen, the Jie people migrated south, and Metallic Essence demons were rampant. Although he was a Daoist Master, he was only able to protect himself..."

"Later, my family was displaced and migrated south. Unfortunately, the Daoist Master was captured and consumed by Metallic Essence demons. The surviving members fled in all directions, and much of the Dao lineage was lost. My branch eventually settled in Xu State six hundred years ago, with only two Qi Cultivators remaining."

Yuan Huyuan spoke with a touch of pride and continued, "My ancestors continued south, clashing with the Chi Family's ancestors many times. They eventually settled in the Mushroom Forest Plain. As descendants of the Purple Mansion Realm, they had Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators among them. After more than a hundred years, the Azure Chi Sect was founded, and my family became a member... At that time, four of the twelve peaks were occupied, and the sect flourished for a period."

Li Yuanjiao continued to listen intently as Yuan Huyuan suddenly smiled awkwardly and spoke in a low voice, "It's a pity my family failed several times in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and we've gradually declined..."

Li Yuanjiao could easily sense his desolation. The Jiangnan of today was not the same as it was hundreds of years ago. Back then, cultivators were rare, spirit items were abundant, and the Immortal Mansion had just retreated from the world.

At that time, the Yuan Family's strength was not much different from what it is now. They were still prominent back then, so it was understandable that they now felt the frustration of being in decline.

Yuan Huyuan sighed deeply and said, "Back then, Purple Smoke was just a small temple, and the Kong Family was scrambling for a minor county magistrate position. Wanyu Sword Gate was under the rule of Dongli Sect. Chen Family of Lingyu Gate rented a cave dwelling on my family's territory and had to lower their pride over thirty Spirit Stones. The combined territories of those four sect and gates couldn't even match the size of my family's market... And now... now..."

In an era where snake dragons turned into pure dragons, the Yuan Family squandered their opportunities bit by bit. This has always been a source of pain for many of the Yuan Family's elders. Yuan Huyuan could only sigh repeatedly, unable to finish his sentence.

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly. The Yuan Family's luck had indeed been average, which eased his suspicions somewhat.

At least the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique itself isn't a trap. This technique has a longer history than Azure Pond...

He moved on to the next technique provided by the Yuan Family, which could be used for gathering the Forest Dark Cold Qi. Stowing away both jade slips, he took out the pill and said softly, "Please send a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to assist me with capturing the demon creature, Senior. Once the task is completed, I'll hand over this pill, and you'll help me unlock the secret techniques on the jade slip."

Yuan Huyuan quickly nodded and replied, "Sure. Please wait a moment, I've already invited a cultivator from the clan to join us."

After a brief wait, a strong bearded man with thick eyebrows landed in the yard. He gave Li Yuanjiao a quick look, then cupped his fist and greeted respectfully, "I am Yuan Chengdun. Greetings to Clan Head and fellow Daoist!"

Yuan Huyuan introduced him, "This is my clan nephew, Yuan Chengdun. His immortal foundation is Sprawling Azure Mountain and he's skilled in subduing demons. With him, capturing the little pig demon will be an easy task."

Yuan Chengdun was quite renowned during the devil plagues. Li Yuanjiao had heard of him before and was thus very pleased. He stepped forward and cupped his fist respectfully, returning the gesture.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist!"
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

Yuan Chengdun, carrying two short sticks on his back, was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. He seemed like a reserved man, offering only a slight nod in response.

Li Yuanjiao asked a few casual questions before leading him to the lake.

Li Family...

Li Yuanping sat in the central hall with a young man standing beside him. He was tall with broad shoulders and thick eyebrows.

It was Li Xicheng.

Those in the generation of Xi and Yue were all quite talented, except for Li Yuexiang, whose talent was yet to be determined. Li Yuanjiao had fathered this daughter in old age, and she was not even six years old yet.

Li Xicheng was over thirty now and had reached the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

"...The issue at the mine has been resolved...It was a rat demon...We've sent Uncle Qiuyang over..." he informed respectfully.

Li Yuanping listened to his report carefully and said patiently, "Cheng'er, the Ebony Mine has the most output, so we must handle matters with our own hands. You've done the right thing to send Uncle Qiuyang... All the disturbances in the mine must be carefully investigated. Maybe someone is using the demon to fill the holes left from stealing from the mine..."

Li Xicheng lowered his head, then nodded thoughtfully.

"Junior understands."

"Good," Li Yuanping nodded in approval and continued, "Go to Mount Yue. I've found Li Jiman for you. Have a heart-to-heart talk with him. Mount Yue produces a lot..."

Li Xicheng nodded in response and Li Yuanping continued, saying, "Now that I think about it, most of those from the generation of Cheng and Ming should already be of age. There's quite a number of them, are there any outstanding ones?"

Li Xicheng replied, "The children of the major and minor sects are all talented. Two concubine-born sons are brought back to the major sect because their children have spiritual orifices. Now there are eleven people in total, all practicing in the mountains. As for the outstanding ones..."

Li Xicheng paused and continued softly, "Each of them has the talent to become Qi Cultivator, but whether they are exceptional in terms of innate talent and character... that remains to be seen."

Li Yuanping did not seem to be in a rush and merely responded gently, "With the implementation of the new system, the four lineages are much closer. These children have been eating and living together since they went up the mountain. As long as they are loyal to the family and become Qi Cultivators as well as the backbone of the family in the future, they need not be overachievers. "

Li Yuanping glanced at Li Xicheng beside him, who still seemed a little worried, prompting him to explain in further detail, "All the direct descendants of the family and those in the major and minor sects are going up the mountain to cultivate so that they can get to know each other and be sent out to govern the peaks in the future. As for Mount Qingdu, with you brothers in charge, there won't be too many problems."

The uncle and nephew were both deep in discussion when a servant approached and announced respectfully, "Family Head, Xiao Muyun from Mount Yu is here to visit!"

"Xiao Muyun?" Li Yuanping was momentarily surprised but then smiled warmly and instructed, "Hurry up and bring him in!"

A teenager, no more than twelve or thirteen, soon entered. He was dressed in black, exhibiting the calm composure of someone far beyond his age. He kneeled, bowed and respectfully greeted Li Yuanping.

"Muyun greets Uncle!"

This boy was none other than Xiao Muyun, the son of Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian, now the young master of Mount Yu. Li Yuanping quickly approached to help him up, taking a closer look at the boy. He noted Muyun's calm demeanor and bright, intelligent eyes and could not help but praise him, "Good... very good! You have an excellent bearing and appearance."

Xiao Muyun simply cupped his fist humbly. Reaching the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at the age of twelve or thirteen was already an impressive achievement. Li Xicheng stepped forward with a smile and said, "Ah, so you are my younger cousin!"

The Li Family had rescued Li Qingxiao and Xiao Muyun, so their bond was naturally strong. Li Yuanping asked warmly, "How are things at Mount Yu? Your second uncle has already established his foundation... If you need anything, our family will support you!"

Xiao Muyun was visibly moved and replied, "Uncle, my father and grandfather passed away together back then, but it was our family that saved us. We traveled to many places, and with the Spirit Stones and talismans we received, I was able to retain my position as the head of Mount Yu. Now, my mother and I oversee Mount Yu... Only a few old stubborn men still remain. I came this time to return the seventy Spirit Stones we borrowed."

He took out a storage pouch from his chest pocket and handed it over to Li Xicheng.

"If the family ever needs anything, the Mount Yu lineage will definitely come to your aid!" he promised sincerely.

Li Yuanping sighed and shook his head.

"Mount Yu is still in the hands of the Xiao Family. Excessive contact between us might give others a reason to criticize. Your focus should be on cultivation—breaking through to the Foundation Establishment as soon as possible would be the greatest help you could offer," he said.

"Yes!" Xiao Muyun replied earnestly.

Li Yuanping then turned to Li Xicheng and suggested, "Take your cousin for a walk and introduce him to his other cousins."

Li Xicheng cupped his fist in response, and the two departed. Afterward, Li Yuanping opened a storage pouch to find eighty Spirit Stones. Along with the ten extra stones, he also saw a small letter written by Li Qingxiao. Every word on it was sincere and heartfelt.

With these eighty stones, the gap left by the construction of the family's formation is finally filled.

Li Yuanping felt a sense of relief as the burden that had weighed on him for so long was finally lifted. He put away the storage pouch, savoring a rare moment of contentment.

Just as he finished making some arrangements, a clan soldier entered the hall swiftly and spoke in a low voice, "Family Head, the elder is asking if the clan has any spirit items that could calm qi."

The elder in question was none other than Li Xuanxuan. The Li Family had suffered heavy losses, and he was the only one left who could be referred to as an elder.

Li Yuanping hesitated before replying softly, "If it's truly necessary, I can send someone to Qingdu Peak to inquire."

Li Xuanxuan, though only seventy years old, had used life-shortening techniques multiple times and had suffered three or four severe injuries. He had aged significantly but spent year after year stubbornly toiling away at drawing talismans instead of taking it easy.

Li Xuanxuan had no hope of further advancement. His current cultivation was the result of numerous fortuitous encounters. Now, as he delved deeper into talisman crafting, his suspicions grew more and more intense.

Whenever he meditated, countless illusions plagued him. He faced mental obstacles and relied on Tranquility Pills to find some semblance of calmness.

The old man could no longer even draw talismans with precision. He had been taking Tranquility Pills at home, but whenever he did, he felt guilty for wasting the family's Spirit Stones and would furiously throw himself back into talisman crafting.

Li Yuanping closed his eyes and sighed. Li Xuanxuan was now the eldest in the family, and no one could persuade him to take a break.

Li Yuanping sighed internally.

The pills are not a major concern... I only fear that...

The Li Family had consulted with experts who deduced that Li Xuanxuan should have another eighty to ninety years left to live. Despite only being halfway through his expected lifespan, his current madness made it seem like it could shorten his lifespan by another dozen years.

While Li Yuanping was lost in thought, he felt a chill settle over him and began to cough. He took a sip of medicinal tea made from spirit flowers and suddenly realized...

I don't have many years left either.

Feeling dizzy, he sank back into his seat, silently tapping the table with his fingers.

Eleven people... all with the potential for reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm... Sister Hong is about to establish her foundation too. Ming'er should also be able to achieve his foundation in thirty years, and then we'll have fifteen or sixteen direct descendants in the Qi Cultivation Realm...

For some reason, Li Yuanping thought of the Yu Family from the past, and his heart sank slightly.

Prosperity is fragile... I wonder if Xicheng will manage the family well...




# Chapter 464: Setting Trap

While they hurried to Mount Dali, Li Yuanjiao relayed the crucial information about the pig demon to Yuan Chengdun, who listened intently with a frown on his face.

"Do you have a plan to trap this pig demon?" Yuan Chengdun asked with a serious expression, "While my Immortal Foundation is adept at eliminating monsters, it's not suited for pursuit. I doubt the two of us alone will succeed."

Li Yuanjiao retrieved a green item from his storage pouch and replied, "I have a Foundation Establishment Realm formation plate. Trapping the monster isn't the issue; it's getting it out of the mountain that concerns me."

Yuan Chengdun's face lit up as he assured, "Don't worry, fellow Daoist. Leave that to me."

He surveyed the mountain with Li Yuanjiao before eventually descending into a small valley.

"Does this demon eat humans?" Yuan Chengdun asked.

"Yes," Li Yuanjiao confirmed.
𝕗𝗿𝕖𝐞𝐰𝗲𝕓𝐧𝕠𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝐨𝚖

A smile spread across Yuan Chengdun's face as he replied, "Perfect. This will be easy."

He pulled a jade bottle from his pouch and whispered, "The taste of human flesh is unforgettable. Once it's had a taste, it'll come looking for more."

Yuan Chengdun tipped the jade bottle, spilling some dust onto the ground that eventually formed a small mound of red soil. He then took out another jade box and opened it carefully.

Inside lay a small white flower, with white petals on top and green sepals on the bottom. It was about the size of a palm and looked quite ordinary though it was on the verge of blooming.

Yuan Chengdun planted the flower in the red soil and performed a spell. The flower instantly bloomed, its pretty petals now dripping with a reddish liquid. Soon, a peculiar fist-sized skull emerged on the top of it.

Li Yuanjiao looked at him with concern and asked, "Do you think this method will work, fellow Daoist? If the fragrance is too potent, it could attract all the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm demons in the mountain and cause a huge commotion."

Yuan Chengdun responded calmly, "The Ancient Head Flower isn't that potent, it will only attract a few demon creatures. Just wait and see."

While performing his spell under Li Yuanjiao's gaze, Yuan Chengdun remarked with a smile, "The demon creatures in Mount Dali are nothing like those on the southern border. Most of them are quite foolish, having lived in comfort for so long that they've forgotten how to defend themselves."

Li Yuanjiao asked, "Does the Demon Den not care about this?"

Yuan Chengdun shook his head and replied, "Don't be fooled by the ostentatious display of demon generals outside the Demon Den. In reality, the outer areas are clearly marked. If any peak master from the three sects or seven gates wants to tame or collect these demons, they could do so anytime."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, feeling like a lot of questions in his heart had been answered.

Yuan Chengdun continued, "To those Purple Mansion Realm foxes, these pigs, dogs, snakes, and wolves are nothing more than livestock, much like cattle and sheep raised by mortals."

After chatting for a while, two Embryonic Breathing Realm demons approached. Yuan Chengdun dispatched them with a single palm strike and continued, "Those in the Demon Den kill just as many demons as those outside. In fact, apart from a few species, the ones in the den are even more brutal. There's no restraint among them—it's natural for wolves to prey on deer and foxes to hunt rabbits."

"It's said that immortals and demons in Jiangnan coexist in harmony, which is why the region is so renowned. However, the immortals they refer to are the immortals of the Purple Mansion Realm, and demons are those of the Purple Mansion Realm. What happens among those beneath the Purple Mansion Realm is of no concern to anyone," Yuan Chengdun added with a sneer.

Just then, a demon mist rolled in from the distance. A hoof was still visible through the black mist, and a loud demonic laugh echoed around their surroundings.

"Hahaha... Seems like I've found a treasure today!"

It turned out to be a sinister-looking black deer demon. The demon had just devoured the Ancient Head Flower and was trying to assimilate this newfound power.

Yuan Chengdun and Li Yuanjiao took cover and waited until the demon had fully digested the flower before making a move.

BAM!

Yuan Chengdun struck again with a powerful palm strike. The black deer demon, cultivating in the mid-air, was caught off guard and instantly went lifeless. It plummeted and crashed into the ground with a loud crash.

Pointing at the fallen demon, Yuan Chengdun explained, "This deer demon ate the Ancient Head Flower, so its flesh and blood will be particularly flavorful. We'll just have to drag it back and use it as bait to lure the pig demon out."

Li Yuanjiao understood his plan. Yuan Chengdun's trap was straightforward and likely sufficient for dealing with ordinary demons. However, given his understanding of the pig demon in this mountain, Li Yuanjiao doubted that such a simple trap would work.

Although it was just a dumb pig, it was cautious enough to hide from Li Tongya for years. Hence, Li Yuanjiao believed that it would not be fooled so easily.

Li Yuanjiao cupped his hands and said softly, "That pig demon is cleverer than it seems... I don't think this is enough to make it risk its life."

Yuan Chengdun thought Li Yuanjiao might be overly cautious but was willing to consider his opinion.

"What do you propose, fellow Daoist?" he asked.

"I need to leave for a bit, but I'll be right back," Li Yuanjiao replied then flew into the mountain to look for the White Banyan Fox.

————

In the Vermilion Cave...

The demon den was dim and oppressive, with several blood pools. A burly man was seated in the middle of one of them, and was cultivating in silence.

Each blood pool required the blood of a thousand people to fill, which was a terribly daunting task. Even though it was a demon general of the Foundation Establishment Realm, it had been a long time since it had enjoyed such luxury.

With the Li Family at the foot of the mountain back then, he had to venture into neighboring prefectures to kidnap humans for the sake of his cultivation. However, that was a dangerous endeavor.

Fortunately, the devil plague in recent years had driven down the price of blood qi, easing his plights.

"Which one has died?" he demanded, furrowing his brow.

The pig demon before the blood pool reported, "Great king! I went out of my way to investigate and found that the black deer at the foot of the mountain is dead. No one dared approach... I came here to inform you as soon as I received the news!"

The burly figure rose from the blood pool, anger flashing in his eyes as he yelled, "Where is the corpse?! Don't tell me someone has eaten it without my permission?!"

The pig demon quickly presented the remains of the deer, trying its best not to drool as it replied, "Great king! The black deer must have eaten something... Its corpse smells really delicious!"

The lesser pig demon hauled up the black deer's remains with two of its hooves bitten off.

The Foundation Establishment Realm pig demon paid no mind to this and eagerly devoured it, causing blood to splatter everywhere messily as he bit into the flesh.

"It's truly delicious, but I can't tell what it ate... Send someone to investigate," the burly man ordered, his voice reflecting his satisfaction.

Another demon approached, reporting urgently, "Great king! The White Banyan Fox from the south has sent a message. It claims that a cultivator has died in the mountains and is requesting your assistance in locating him!"

The demon general was taken aback by the news. Ever since the White Banyan Fox had come to his domain, it had been distant and aloof. He was unsure of its background in the den and had only accepted its tributes ceremonially, wary of making direct contact.

Now that the fox had come seeking his help and hinted that it might be a direct descendant of a great demon from the den, the demon general's joy was palpable. Securing such a relationship would alleviate his fears of being overpowered by intruders in the future.

His excitement caused his demonic power to surge, and his face, which had been maintaining a human appearance, reverted to its pig-like form.

Smiling broadly, he exclaimed, "No wonder it tasted so exquisite! It turns out it had consumed parts of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator! Where did you find the black deer? Bring me there immediately!"

Eager to investigate, he quickly conjured up a demonic mist, and, with his subordinates in tow, swiftly flew toward the area outside Mount Dali.




# Chapter 465: Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual

Li Yuanjiao and Yuan Chengdun waited for a while. A fierce demonic wind blew in from the south, causing sand and pebbles to swirl in the valley. A black demonic mist surged from the horizon, and at the forefront stood a burly man wielding a white bone hammer.

Behind him were several demonic creatures, all of various strange appearances—a wolf and a deer flanked a pig demon in the center as they descended to the ground. Hidden in the Profound Patterned Bottle's mist, Li Yuanjiao performed a hand seal.

BOOM!

The group of demons joyously landed, triggering the Foundation Establishment Realm formation. A green light barrier rose around them, completely isolating them from their surroundings.

The Foundation Establishment Realm demon barely managed to keep its composure while the lesser demons, still in the Qi Cultivation Realm, were terrified. Some stumbled, and others tried to flee.

This Foundation Establishment Realm formation was from an artifact carried by Kong Tingyun, a direct disciple of Profound Peak Gate.

The lesser demons were instantly thrown into disarray. As they struggled in confusion, Yuan Chengdun silently emerged from the black mist, removing the two short rods from his back and delivering a heavy strike without uttering a word.

Golden-blue light flickered around him as his immortal foundation Sprawling Azure Mountain activated. With a heavy stomp on the ground and a swing of his two short rods, Yuan Chengdun shattered the bones of the wolf demon, breaking it into pieces seemingly effortlessly. The other rod struck the deer demon, causing its head to shatter into fragments, its blood splattering everywhere.

They would have made good Qi Cultivation Realm sacrificial offerings!

Seeing Yuan Chengdun kill two demons so swiftly, Li Yuanjiao feared he might continue the slaughter. He quickly maneuvered through the black mist, extending his hand to draw the Qingche Sword from its sheath, the sharp green-white blade gleaming menacingly.

Yuan Chengdun also rushed forward, his short rods gleaming with golden light as fine golden patterns emerged on his face. With a cold expression, he attacked the Foundation Establishment Realm pig demon which was shrouded in dark mist, angrily muttering and raising its bone hammer to block his attacks. The clash with Li Yuanjiao's sword arc produced a harsh, grating sound.

Yuan Chengdun ignored the demon's resistance, his short rods carrying formidable power as he skillfully executed his strikes.

The pig demon, caught between two formidable opponents, was in dire straits. It opened its mouth wide and unleashed a wave of demonic mist, hoping to fend off Yuan Chengdun's assault.

"What crude demonic art! You dare show this off?!" Yuan Chengdun laughed as the golden light of Sprawling Azure Mountain easily dispersed the mist. His rods then struck the pig demon's chest, causing it to spit blood and struggle to maintain its form, its body beginning to swell as it reverted to its original form.

Li Yuanjiao was about to intervene when Yuan Chengdun called out, "No need to interfere, fellow Daoist! It has been a while since I have had the pleasure of pummeling such a clumsy and thick-skinned pig demon... Let me savor this!"

Li Yuanjiao paused for a moment before smiling and stepping back, allowing Yuan Chengdun to continue in his pleasures.

In the dark mist, a golden light shone brightly as the pig demon transformed into a massive creature the size of a grand hall, its black fur-like armor with its green eyes glowing ominously.

Yuan Chengdun remained unfazed, wielding his short rods like hammers. Despite their relatively small size compared to the pig demon, he struck with full force, and the demon, using all its strength, barely managed to block the attacks while shouting loudly, "Sprawling Azure Mountain?! What did I do to offend your Yuan Family that you traveled so far to ambush me?!"

The pig demon noticed Li Yuanjiao but did not associate him with the Li Family. After all, if the Li Family wanted him dead, Li Tongya would have come, and the pig demon would have already been chopped into pieces. There would be no need for such elaborate schemes.

Yuan Chengdun simply replied with a grin, "How many man-eating demons have fallen to my short rods? Whether you offended our family or not, it does not matter!"

The pig demon, with its tough skin and thick hide, could not escape and was beaten relentlessly, crying out in pain and spitting blood.

Sprawling Azure Mountain truly lives up to its reputation, Li Yuanjiao thought to himself.

Yuan Chengdun's way of wielding the rods was unusual, holding them by the ends as if they were short hammers, striking with resounding force. Li Yuanjiao watched closely, noticing the skill in Yuan Chengdun's technique, and could not help but advise, "Hold back a bit, fellow Daoist! Do not kill it!"

As he spoke, a spring of grayish-green water gushed from the ground beneath his feet as a black water serpent coiled and spread out, capturing all the Qi Cultivation Realm demons trembling within the formation.

This rod technique is more than meets the eye... Li Yuanjiao thought as he observed more closely.

Yuan Chengdun's rod technique was likely a legacy passed down from the Yuan Family's connection with Yanyang Temple in the north and was at least a Grade Four technique. It was ancient and powerful, easily beating the pig demon into wailing submission.

Sprawling Azure Mountain must be an immortal foundation similar to Jade Court General, enhancing the body and excelling in combat arts...

After watching for a while, Li Yuanjiao heard the soft sounds of water as the Jing Dragon King returned, dragging along a few Qi Cultivation Realm demons.

"One at the late stage of Qi Cultivation Realm, and two at the early stage..."

The difference between the Foundation Establishment Realm and the Qi Cultivation Realm was like that between mortals and immortals. Li Yuanjiao glanced at them briefly and lost interest, focusing instead on the pig demon that was still howling in pain.

"My commander is of the demon den's direct lineage, sent here on a mission! You better know your place... Ah!"

The pig demon was struck a few more times as its eyes reddened with fury, and its aura surged as it opened its mouth wide, spewing a blood-red torrent filled with countless skulls and bones that all rushed toward Yuan Chengdun.

Yuan Chengdun remained unperturbed, flicking his finger to release a large, crystalline hide. With just a flick, it captured the blood-red river, causing it to crash to the ground like a dead snake, writhing for a moment before going still.

Yuan Chengdun continued his onslaught, switching through several rod techniques as the pig demon, beaten within an inch of its life, collapsed to the ground.

"In just the time it takes for an incense stick to burn... Your rod technique is truly impressive, fellow Daoist!" Li Yuanjiao praised.

Yuan Chengdun, slightly perspiring but in high spirits, replied, "My immortal foundation disperses demonic essence, leaving it unable to cast spells or perform techniques. Its body and artifacts are inferior to mine, and with the formation blocking any escape, it naturally met this fate."

Li Yuanjiao descended lightly, sealing the acupoints and Dao foundation of the pig demon. The black serpent dragon surged, binding all the small demons together before he stowed away the formation plate.

Yuan Chengdun smiled slightly, just about to take his leave when both of them suddenly fell silent.

A man stood just outside the formation.

He appeared to be a middle-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation in his late thirties or early forties. He wore a mismatched Daoist robe, his skin slightly tanned, and his pupils were vertical slits like those of a serpent dragon, emitting a reddish-brown glow as he quietly observed the two men.

Li Yuanjiao and Yuan Chengdun immediately became vigilant. The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator spoke in a hoarse voice, "A member of the Li Family?"

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and nodded.

"And you are..?"

The man, wary of Yuan Chengdun, softened his tone, "An old acquaintance from Mount Yue... I am Fei Luoya. How is Daoist Tongya doing these days?"

"Ah, it's you, Senior Fei Luoya! I am Li Yuanjiao."

Li Yuanjiao immediately understood. This man was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator left from Mount Wu and a close neighbor of the Li Family, the Mount Yue cultivator Fei Luoya.

Years ago, this person appeared when the Li Family made Eastern Mount Yue their vassal. Granduncle Li Tongya, borrowing the reputation of the sword immortal upheld by the families of Xiao and Fei, deterred him. Later, they even traded valuable medicines with him. They had some dealings in the past.

Having been fighting on someone else's territory for quite a while, it was no surprise that this Mount Yue cultivator had come to investigate. Li Yuanjiao apologized a few times, but Fei Luoya waved it off, saying in a low voice, "And this is?"

"Yuan Chengdun of the Yuan Family from Mushroom Forest Plain," Yuan Chengdun replied steadily, "I was sent by the elders of my clan to assist the Li Family in slaying demons."

Fei Luoya nodded in understanding, his hoarse voice continuing, "As it happens, I have something I wish to discuss with you."

Yuan Chengdun cupped his fist and tactfully announced, "Now that this matter is resolved, I shall take my leave."

With the mirror in hand and a good sense of the character of the people of Mount Yue, Li Yuanjiao had no fear of letting him go.

Fei Luoya began, "Daoist Tongya's fame for slaying the Maha is truly impressive. Although I live in this poor and remote place, I have heard of it as well. I wonder..."

Li Yuanjiao had avoided this topic once before, but seeing that Fei Luoya was fixated on it, he replied, "The ancestor is currently in seclusion."

Fei Luoya raised an eyebrow. His eyes, made more terrifying by his special cultivation method, stared at Li Yuanjiao as he let out a strange laugh.

"Slaying a Maha with a sword must have left Daoist Tongya gravely injured..."

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly, but before he could respond, Fei Luoya added, "To provoke a Maha... He must have done that under someone's orders, right?"

Li Yuanjiao, sharp as ever, quickly pieced it together and thought to himself, Granduncle must have used some Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's name to protect himself back then!

His expression shifted as he said, "I see now that Senior shares a deep connection with my granduncle! I apologize for my earlier rudeness."

This comment made Fei Luoya pause in surprise while Li Yuanjiao continued, "Though we are protected from above, there are certain orders... we must follow."

Having spent years doing dirty work under Duanmu Kui, Fei Luoya naturally empathized with this. He had always harbored a favorable impression of Li Tongya and welcomed Li Yuanjiao's attempt to befriend him.

He then said, "Do you know when Li Tongya will leave seclusion? I have a business proposition for him."

Li Yuanjiao responded, "Please tell me, Senior."

"Naturally, it involves killing someone," Fei Luoya said as he paused, his voice turning serious, "I have a peer from the same faction named Fu Daimu, a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to my south. We have never gotten along. Recently, I heard that his Dao companion is about to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. I sense that this spells trouble for me, and more likely than not, he will come to kill me."

Fei Luoya shook his head as he continued in a graver tone, "Since he might try to kill me, I might as well find someone to kill him first. I have already enlisted the help of another peer from the same faction, but it is still not enough. I was hoping Daoist Tongya could lend a hand; with his help, success would be almost certain."

Li Yuanjiao did not want to be inexplicably dragged into a conflict between Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, so he gently shook his head.

However, Fei Luoya, with his crimson eyes glowing, waved his hand dismissively and said, "If Daoist Tongya does not act, I will have to abandon this place and leave. In the future, if there is a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm shaman of Mount Yue lurking near your clan, life won't be easy for you either."

Li Yuanjiao raised his eyebrows and looked at the man. Fei Luoya's expression was somewhat indifferent as he slowly continued, "Fu Daimu has a dharma artifact, Mountain of Human Heads, that requires blood qi for sacrificial refinement."

Li Yuanjiao exhaled lightly and asked, "Do the high shamans still have any connection with Azure Pond Sect? I am afraid Fu Daimu might have backing."

Fei Luoya rasped, "How could I, a down-and-out Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, know such things? Your clan has deep connections, so naturally, it falls on your Li Family to investigate this."

Seeing Li Yuanjiao remain silent, Fei Luoya's expression grew serious as he continued, "I did not come here to provoke, but rather to urge your clan to prepare in advance. I, Fei Luoya, simply do not want to leave my homeland and swallow this bitter pill, but your clan cannot afford to relocate either!"

The Mount Yue cultivator paused and lowered his voice, saying, "I am sure you understand the way of the world—without the protection of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are just pawns... I have had enough of being tossed around, living in darkness, unable even to step outside my own mountain gate!"

"I have practiced shamanic spells for many years and consider myself to be rather courageous. Please put in a good word for me with that person, fellow Daoist. If we can work together in the future, it'll indeed be a wonderful thing."

After leaving these words, Fei Luoya cupped his fist and took his leave, leaving Li Yuanjiao standing there in silence.

Inwardly smiling wryly, he thought to himself, You're not the only one—even my family is tired of being pawns too... We also long for the protection of a Purple Mansion Realm master of our own!"

————

Within the mirror world...

The jade slips piled high on Lu Jiangxian's desk had formed a small mountain, with the accompanying stone stool also overflowing with them. The floor beneath his white robe was similarly cluttered with various jade slips, rolling around and leaving no room to step.

"Li Yuanjiao's journey running all over the place this time has yielded quite a bounty!" Lu Jiangxian joyfully remarked.

Li Yuanjiao had truly ventured deep into the core of the Yuan Family's territory, even venturing into the regions of the Yue Cultivating Sect, rogue cultivators, Profound Peak Gate, and various prefectures. He even traveled upstream along the Great River, reaching the borders of the Shen Family, a Purple Mansion Realm immortal clan under the Yue Cultivating Sect's governance.

At present, 668 Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques, 98 Qi Cultivation Realm techniques, 21 Foundation Establishment Realm techniques, and 15 miscellaneous arts had been recorded. Lu Jiangxian materialized them one by one, piling them up on the mountaintop.

Gazing at the vast collection of jade slips, Lu Jiangxian felt a deep sense of security. He slowly reached out, and a glowing blue jade slip materialized in his hand, the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual—a Grade Six cultivation method, directly leading to a Purple Mansion Realm immortal technique!

This was the first time Lu Jiangxian had acquired a Grade Six cultivation method, and it was also the first complete series of Purple Mansion Realm immortal techniques he had obtained.

This was a legacy that the Yuan Family had secretly safeguarded for 1,600 years, hidden beneath Mount Yuan in their territory, protected by seven layers of restrictive formations that even isolated the great void, making it inaccessible to even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

Of course, under Lu Jiangxian's divine sense, whether it was seven layers or seventy layers of formations, they were useless. The formations that could isolate the great void only caused him a slight pause before he effortlessly bypassed them.

As the Yuan Family's treasured legacy, the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual was naturally encrypted with secret methods. Unfortunately for them, the jade slip containing the encryption was hidden beneath a memorial tablet, which Lu Jiangxian had also discovered.

After carefully studying this Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique for a while, Lu Jiangxian was lost in thought.

The Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual centered around the Dao foundation known as Profound Goat, which could be cultivated all the way to form a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability.

This Grade Six cultivation method was the core, accompanied by four related immortal foundations for the Foundation Establishment Realm. Once these were cultivated after breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, they could lead one to the peak of the realm.

These primary immortal foundations were Azure Crest Manifestation, Sprawling Azure Mountain, Almighty Crag, Abyss Observer, and Profound Goat.

They were all aligned with a single metallic essence, known as Azure Dam Divine Mountain Sprawling Essence.

At the end of the manual, there was an appendix that included a supplementary method, cultivating an immortal foundation called Lower Yang Essence, specifically prepared for cases where a particular immortal foundation could not be cultivated. This could substitute one of the immortal foundations in Azure Dam's Metallic Essence to form the metallic essence.

"Indeed, this is a complete legacy; they even prepared a lower-level substitute Dao Partner... It seems the Yanyang Temple was once a decent Dao lineage..." Lu Jiangxian mumbled softly.

Yuan Huyuan had claimed that much of the legacy from Yanyang Temple had been lost, but now, seeing the completeness of the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual, it was clear that this was merely a lie to keep things under wraps.

"But the Yuan Family clearly possesses a Purple Mansion Realm immortal technique... so how could they fail to produce a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for over a thousand years?!"

Lu Jiangxian studied the technique for a while longer before identifying the issue: it lay in the core immortal foundation, Profound Goat, which required a specific form of Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth known as Variant Goat Profound Qi.

"Refined Yang Profound Qi had to be gathered from Azure Variant Mountain Stone exposed under the scorching sun. It took a year to gather a single wisp, and ten years to obtain a sufficient amount of Azure Variant Qi. Then, using a demon transformed from a sacrificial goat, the qi is repeatedly refined for ten years..."

Lu Jiangxian reviewed the refinement technique meticulously.

The method of gathering this Variant Goat Profound Qi was followed by a dense collection of attempts, all failed attempts to replace the required spiritual qi that were added by later generations.

"Ah, this explains everything... The Yuan Family, after migrating from the north, lost their source of Variant Goat Profound Qi long ago. Their stored spiritual qi gradually dwindled as one Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator after another failed to break through, leading to the decline of the technique...

"As a result, the supplementary Dao foundations became more commonly used by the Yuan Family... But no matter how much they practiced, they could only reach the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, with no path forward," Lu Jiangxian concluded.

Holding this Purple Mansion Realm immortal technique in his hand, Lu Jiangxian carefully read through the section on divine abilities, feeling a sudden enlightenment. He now had some ideas for the Purple Mansion Realm section of his Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, which had been stalled.

"However, with so many cultivation methods, I cannot just hand them out freely. If the Li Family were to practice the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual, it might lead to a conflict with the Yuan Family and attract unwanted attention..."

Lu Jiangxian reconsidered his options.




# Chapter 467: Li Wushao

Fei Luoya finally departed, and after waiting for a few moments, Li Yuanjiao saw a man flying in from the distant valley. It was Yuan Chengdun, with his two short rods strapped to his back. He landed beside Li Yuanjiao who cupped his fist in greeting.

"Thank you, Fellow Daoist!"

Yuan Chengdun laughed heartily and replied, "I could not stray too far without securing the pill! If that fellow had any ill intentions and something happened, I would have no way to explain myself."

Understanding his point, Li Yuanjiao took out the Essence Gathering Pill and handed it over. Yuan Chengdun then revealed two jade slips, saying warmly, "These are our clan's secret techniques... Please ensure they are used only within your clan and not disseminated indiscriminately."

"Of course," Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement, adding, "In a few days, my younger sister will come to Mushroom Forest Plain. I'll have to trouble your esteemed clan to look after her."

Impressed by Yuan Chengdun's formidable strength, Li Yuanjiao had kept the earlier events in mind. He recalled Fei Luoya's words, and with a smile, he said, "Your strength is truly remarkable... I greatly admire you. If I encounter any difficulties in the future, might I call upon you for assistance, fellow Daoist?"

Yuan Chengdun nodded steadily and replied, "Your son is a disciple under my aunt's tutelage, and our families have been allies for many years. There is no need for formalities; just call on me if needed. A good fight followed by sharing the spoils is always welcome."

"Great! Many thanks in advance, fellow Daoist!"

Li Yuanjiao now recognized Yuan Chengdun as a generous and honorable man, a rare genius of the Yuan Family. They exchanged a few warm words, leaving each with a favorable impression before parting ways.

As Li Yuanjiao flew onward, he thought to himself, This man has a grand bearing, a true hero! To have broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm at thirty-seven is indeed quite impressive.

Reflecting on Yuan Huyuan's complaints, he sighed, "What a pity though. Had he been born five hundred years earlier, the Yuan Family might have secured a place among the three sects and seven gates... But having been born five hundred years late, he can only protect them for a period of time."

As Li Yuanjiao flew on, he carefully reread the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique manual, noting that the last part referenced the Daoist Master Profound Goat which eased some of his doubts.

In the end, with Yuan Su, Xiao Chuting, and possibly Mount Dali supporting us, the balance of power is maintained... The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are unlikely to harbor ill intentions toward us as long as we pick our immortal foundation carefully.

Instead, it is the Buddhist cultivators manipulating fate that are the real danger.

In this grand chessboard of Purple Mansion and Maha, the moves of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were visible and could be guarded against. But when Maha wanted to kill, it was nearly impossible to defend against them once one's fate was sealed.

Ultimately, it's just a concealment technique... nothing too earth-shattering.

He then took out the storage pouch from the pig demon and sifted through its contents before finally letting out a sigh.

"A poor pig indeed..."

The pouch mostly contained various spirit materials with very few Spirit Stones—only thirty-two in total, leaving Li Yuanjiao speechless.

"My family is not part of the three sects and seven gates. The pig demon's belongings had already been promised to the demon fox to smooth things over with the demon den, leaving little for anything extra..."

Dragging the Foundation Establishment Realm pig demon back to the mountain, Li Yuanjiao sealed the creature as usual and handed it over to the clan's cultivators for safekeeping. He then descended to the riverside where his spiritual sense swept over the area, quickly locating the Hooked Serpent.

The Hooked Serpent had an enormous iron shackle forged from ebony ore around its neck with iron chains piercing its body. Its originally dark scales were now caked with mud, appearing black and brown as it lay in the muck like a fallen giant tree.

An Zheyan was sitting cross-legged in midair and was surrounded by the Jade Court Guards, who were the elite among those at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Each of them was holding a metal chain in hand, standing quietly.

"Ancestor!"

An Zheyan quickly rose to his feet when he saw Li Yuanjiao approaching.

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and asked, "You have reached the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm... Do you have plans to establish your foundation?"

Since the fall of the An Family, An Zheyan had been cultivating with increasing diligence, following the guidance of his wife, Li Feiruo, and had settled comfortably within the Li Family. Over the past twenty-four years, he had attained the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Hearing Li Yuanjiao's question, he sighed and replied, "I am already one hundred and nine years old... Though I have made considerable progress over the past decade, I know my limits. I'm not made for Foundation Establishment Realm. I do not wish to risk my life either; I only seek a peaceful old age."

"Hmm."

Li Yuanjiao's gaze moved from An Zheyan to the Hooked Serpent. The snake demon opened its massive, human head-sized black eyes, and with a clattering of the ebony chains, it moved its head closer in a fawning manner and said, "Exalted Immortal! You're here, Exalted Immortal! This humble demon has been waiting for so long... What are your orders?"

Li Yuanjiao asked, "This Dao foundation of yours, Morning Cold Rain... Which type of metallic essence is it associated with?"

The Hooked Serpent hesitated for a moment, fear flashing across its face.

"I-It's... It's... of the Water Mansion system," it finally said.

Water Mansion?

Li Yuanjiao's interest was instantly piqued, but the Hooked Serpent cried out in terror, "Spare me, Exalted Immortal! Small serpents like me number in the hundreds, if not thousands, in the Eastern Sea. My Dao foundation is impure and unfit for consumption... it would only fetch a low price!"

Seeing the serpent's fearful demeanor, Li Yuanjiao suddenly recalled something Xiao Yuansi had once said—

Dao foundations of the same system can be consumed by one another, but it will sever the path to the Purple Mansion Realm... However, it offers a unique advantage over the ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. No wonder this Hooked Serpent is so terrified... it fears I will sell it to an immortal cultivator of the Water Mansion system!

This serpent hails from overseas and is a demon. Without the three sects and seven gates withholding information to maintain better control over their cultivators, there's much knowledge I can extract from it!

Feeling a sudden surge of excitement, Li Yuanjiao quickly asked, "How many metallic essences exist in the water system? What are their names? How many of them are incomplete?"

The Hooked Serpent, eager to please, quickly responded with a smile, "According to what I have heard from the Serpent Dragon Palace... this type of Golden Core Fruition Attainments is collectively known as the Water Virtue, consisting of what is referred to as the Five Waters—Pit, Valley, Pristine, Converge, and Mansion. Currently, only Pit Water and Water Mansion have yet to be claimed. Exalted Immortal, your dragon serpent belongs to the Pit Water system... consuming me won't do you any good."

"I see!"

Feeling enlightened, Li Yuanjiao realized, Pit Water... that's the metallic essence Xiao Chuting was looking for!

He continued his line of questioning, asking, "If that is the case, where are the Valley, Pristine, and Converge Waters located?"

The Hooked Serpent quickly answered, "Pristine Water had been claimed long ago by a True Monarch from the Azure Chi Devil Gate. Converge Water has always belonged to the Serpent Dragon Palace, but as for Valley Water... this lowly demon does not know. I only know that the position is occupied..."

"Good."

Li Yuanjiao was pleased to uncover such secrets and pressed on, "Do you know the full names of these metallic essences?"

"This humble one lacks a strong background and only knows bits and pieces... I am only aware of the five Fruition Attainments of the Water Virtue. There are also five Fruition Attainments for the Fire Virtue..."

The Hooked Serpent continued stammering, "I-I have heard rumors that within the mainland, there are Three Gold with Fruition Attainments fully realized, leading to the flourishing of the Golden Stone system. Ebony Copper Essence and cold metal are now abundant, their Sharp Qi so potent that even common folk can afford to use iron tools and armor..."

Upon hearing this, a figure in white suddenly flashed in Li Yuanjiao's mind, and he was startled.

"That Wang Xun from back then... so he's truly the descendant of a Golden Core Realm Immortal!"

Back in the day when Wang Xun had visited the Li Family, he mentioned that the Wang Family's ancestor was the leader of the Mainland's Three Gold. Li Yuanjiao had only been half-convinced and skeptical, thinking that only three Golden Core Realm cultivators were left on the mainland.

But now, upon reflection, these Three Gold were not three Golden Core Realm cultivators, but rather referring to the three Golden Stone Fruition Attainments!

The Azure Pond Sect alone had a Golden Core Realm cultivator overseeing it, and counting Wu and Yue States, there could be as many as ten Golden Core Realm cultivators on the mainland.

"Good... good!" Li Yuanjiao nodded slowly, his thoughts turning over in his mind.

Suddenly, he leaned closer to the Hooked Serpent and whispered, "Oh? Since you say that the Golden Stone system's Fruition Attainments had been fully realized, then why are there five Fruition Attainments in the Water Virtue, but only three in the Golden Stone?"

The Hooked Serpent was taken aback, having never thought deeply about this before. Caught off guard, it mumbled, "That is true... why is that? Five Waters, Five Fires, yet only Three Golds..."

Finally, it responded, "This lowly one truly does not know! May the Exalted Immortal discern the truth!"

After several rounds of intense questioning, it was clear the Hooked Serpent had no more valuable information to provide. Li Yuanjiao silently observed the serpent for a few moments, his gaze making the creature's scales bristle with fear.

Knowing that this was a moment of life and death, the Hooked Serpent flicked its tongue nervously and pleaded, "This lowly one has struggled to cultivate for a hundred years just to gain sentience. I entered these lands only to seek spirit waters, with no intent to harm anyone. My spirit water, twin hooks, and serpent pearl have all been taken by the Exalted Immortal... Now, I only beg for my life to be spared..."

Li Yuanjiao, deep in thought, considered the matter.

The matter of the Hooked Serpent was entrusted by Kong Tingyun, who is connected to the Profound Peak. They've shown goodwill to our family many times; the situation should be manageable...

He lifted the serpent and said in a low voice, "I can spare your life, but you must serve my family for the rest of your days. I have borrowed a secret method, and you must cooperate in relinquishing your spirituality... Are you willing?"

The Hooked Serpent, relieved to see a way out, quickly responded, "Yes! I am willing!"

Li Yuanjiao adjusted his sleeves as Li Xicheng arrived with a group of Jade Court Guards. Stepping forward, Li Xicheng respectfully greeted, "Second Uncle."

Li Yuanjiao then asked, "How many Spirit Stones remain in the family?"

Li Xicheng quickly replied, "The family's Spirit Stones are primarily reserved for tributes, leaving only fifty extra. The Green Ox River Embrace Formation cost one hundred and fifteen, with eighty sent from Mount Yu to cover the shortfall, leaving a surplus of fifteen Spirit Stones."

Li Yuanjiao fell silent for a moment.

The materials needed to tame this serpent were worth around ninety spirit stones. The family had three of the necessary items, but the rest would have to be purchased from other families.

He took out fifty Spirit Stones and instructed, "These are from my personal savings along with what we gained from slaying the demons. Gather sixty-five more... that should be enough. Bring them to me in a few days."

After a short pause, he added, "Your aunt is going to Mushroom Forest Plain to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Send a few people to accompany her."

Li Qinghong was somewhat apprehensive of the prospect, but Li Yuanjiao had full confidence in her.

————

Snow fell regularly over Moongaze Lake. Qingdu Peak stood tall in the lake's center and was surrounded by several small hills. The blackish-brown stone peaks stood silently as the green formation barrier activated, isolating the area from the outside world.

The Hooked Serpent coiled its deep-black body atop one of the small stone peaks, raising its head and exhaling a series of white breaths that surged upward toward the mountain.

Li Yuanjiao had warned it several times that if the technique failed, it would suffer severe injuries, and the Li Family had no extra elixirs to spare. The serpent, naturally anxious, continued to exhale white breath.

Before long, a beam of white light rose from the mountaintop and pierced through the sky, then imprinted itself on the serpent's head. It was as large as a carriage. A white mark soon appeared and a portion of its spirituality was extracted, which flew toward Li Yuanjiao who was waiting on the mountain patiently.

Li Yuanjiao descended slowly, the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique smoothly functioning as expected. The Hooked Serpent, far from showing signs of weakness, was instead brimming with energy and continuously exhaling cold qi, clearly having benefited from the ritual.

"It seems this truly is a spirit material of the Purple Mansion Realm..." Li Yuanjiao mumbled in awe.

The six points of the Six Dams Life Matching formation naturally corresponded to the six types of spirit materials recorded. At the center, Li Yuanjiao placed a Supreme Yin Osmanthus Blossom, filled to the brim with Supreme Yin Moonlight, though much of it had dissipated wastefully.

With a flick of his hand, the Hooked Serpent's Cold Jade Serpent Pearl shot out and into its gaping maw. The serpent's aura surged dramatically, its scales deepening in color, once again exuding the presence of a demon general.

The Hooked Serpent continued exhaling cold air for an hour, its massive eyes flickering with a cold white light for three full breaths before finally calming down. The snake coiled around the mountain, its body shifting, causing a cascade of rocks to tumble down with a series of sharp, cracking sounds.

It took to the air, casting a shadow over the ground, and upon landing, its form shifted into that of a young man dressed in black, with a dark and fierce demeanor. His eyes were narrow, his clothing tight and practical as he cupped his fist and bowed.

"This subordinate greets the master!"

Li Yuanjiao noticed that the serpent's twin tails were still bare and asked, "Can the hooks on your tail grow back?"

The Hooked Serpent's venom was infamous. Even Kong Tingyun needed to borrow an artifact in order to restrain the serpent's tails. Without those poisonous hooks, its strength would be significantly diminished.

The young man in black shook his head repeatedly and answered, "Master, unless I consume some treasured panacea or spirit water, it will take decades for my hooks to regrow..."

Li Yuanjiao frowned and said, "I will keep an eye out for them. Have you ever taken human form before?"

"Never. In the Eastern Sea, such things are not practiced," the young man replied meekly, "I only broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm about ten years ago and spent most of those years in seclusion at Lake Xian..."

Li Yuanjiao squinted at him. The young man's dark, fierce features made him look vicious and threatening, as if he could devour a person at any moment. Li Yuanjiao remarked, "Why do you look like a villain, just like me?"

The young man seemed taken aback by this comment, pausing awkwardly before replying, "My spirituality is in your hands... so it's only natural there's a resemblance."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, feeling pleased that he had gained a Foundation Establishment Realm ally. His mood lifted as he let out a laugh, saying, "Since you have taken human form, it is time to give you a proper name... We cannot keep calling you Hooked Serpent all the time."

The fierce young man lowered his head in acknowledgment. After a moment of thought, Li Yuanjiao said, "You resemble a black branch... Since you have joined my Li Family, I will name you Li Wushao.[1]"

Li Wushao cupped his fist and respectfully replied, "Thank you, Master!"

Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily, thinking to himself, It's better to borrow names from others; otherwise, Qinghong will complain about my naming sense and secretly laugh at me.

With a Foundation Establishment Realm demon cultivator on his side, many things would now be easier to manage. Feeling a sense of relief, Li Yuanjiao instructed Li Wushao, "Go and meet with Xicheng. Let him introduce you to the family members, so you will not mistake friend for foe in the future."

"Yes!" Li Wushao responded, taking flight right away and heading downward. Li Yuanjiao turned and entered the courtyard, picked up a brush, and began writing a letter to Qingsui Peak.

"I will ask Zhi'er about this Fu Daimu and whether he has any backing... If this can be done, I will enlist Yuan Chengdun or Senior Yuan Si to join us, and we will eliminate him with a five-person ambush..." Li Yuanjiao mumbled to himself as he formulated a plan to deal with Fu Daimu.

"This fellow has been in that region for so long; he must have collected quite a few valuable items—treasured panacea, shamanic spells, and even a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact. Killing him would not only remove a threat but also win over Fei Luoya..."

A rare, genuine smile appeared on his face as he thought to himself, Zhi'er... It has been years since his engagement with the Yang Family's daughter. I wonder if they have any children yet... I must ask him about that.

1. "Wu" means black, "shao" means the tip of a branch. ☜




# Chapter 469: The Meng Father and Daughter

Moongaze Lake was a thousand li away from Mount Azure Pond. Even a Qi Cultivator flying at full speed without rest would need two days and two nights to make the journey. Including time spent in meditation and resting, it would take about six to seven days for a round trip, meaning half a month would easily pass by.

Moreover, the Azure Pond Sect's territory was far from peaceful, with many large mountains that had to be avoided. Li Yuanjiao's letter was entrusted to the Yuan Family to deliver, and it took more than a month to receive a reply.

The Yuan Family valued the Li Family greatly. Since Yuan Huyuan was in seclusion, the letter was delivered by his eldest son. He respectfully handed it over, exchanged a few polite words, and then took his leave.

"...Handwritten on the evening of the 28th of Spring. Congratulations to Father for breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm... Does the family know about the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven? If you have acquired items from there, those below the Foundation Establishment Realm can safely be used, but any Purple Mansion Realm spirit medicines, secret techniques, or manuals must be sent to Azure Pond without delay...

...I have benefited greatly from the Eastern Fire. Yesterday, I reached the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Brother Ming is still young, so I hope Father will not be too harsh on him... I have also obtained several pill recipes in the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven, which I am enclosing with this letter. The family can profit from them, but do not spread them outside the family...

...As for Brother Jun's Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual, I have asked the Yang Family, and they said that there is no Purple Mansion Realm legacy of this technique in Yue State. However, there are some traces in the far northwest of Wu State, so he can continue his cultivation with peace of mind without worry."

After reading the letter, Li Yuanjiao exhaled deeply, a hint of satisfaction appearing on his face.

"Zhi'er has already investigated and found the answer before I could even ask about Xijun's matter. With this information, Jun'er can cultivate that technique without any worries."

Attached to the end of the letter was a small bead containing several pill recipes. The bead was crystal clear and quite beautiful. Li Yuanjiao examined it thoughtfully, musing to himself, Azure Pond's methods are indeed impressive... This bead is much more convenient to carry around than a jade slip.

He then channeled his spiritual sense into the bead and saw two pill recipes—Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill and Two Ways of Refining Renewal Spirit Pill, both of which were extremely difficult to refine and highly valuable.

Li Yuanjiao put the items away, thinking to himself, I should help Ximing break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm first and then study these two recipes... Azure Pond's spiritual qi is abundant, and Zhi'er is highly talented. With focused cultivation, he has even surpassed Ming'er.

With that thought, he leaped into the air, passed through the formation on Qingdu Peak, and descended toward the lake.

The weather was cold, and the dark green waters of the lake were still covered with pieces of floating ice. As he approached the lake's surface, waves surged and the dark green water rose, sending the ice crashing together with a crackling sound.

A large black serpent's head, as big as a carriage, slowly emerged from the water. Demonic qi surged, and spiritual light flashed as Li Wushao transformed into a black-clad youth, cupping his fist in greeting.

"Wushao greets Master!"

He bowed his head, exuding a powerful aura, and respectfully reported, "As per your orders, I have swept the five peaks along the shore and tamed three Qi Cultivation Realm demons and twenty-five Embryonic Breathing Realm ones, collecting twenty-six types of spirit items."

The demon lightly clapped his hands, stirring the water with his mana as he called out, "Come out, all of you!"

With that, the dark green waters split open as three demons flew out, clumsily standing upright in midair, suspended by demonic wind.

Li Yuanjiao glanced at them—a pair of fat green fish demons, one large and one small, were at mid and early stages of Qi Cultivation Realm respectively, and there was also a black lake turtle at the early stage of Qi Cultivation Realm, hovering nervously in the air.

With a casual wave of his hand, the three demons were dismissed with great relief. Li Wushao cupped his fist and continued, "Your servant has scouted the lake near the eastern shore and found no Foundation Establishment Realm demons. I have already sent some underlings to search deeper into the lake."

"As for the matter Family Head mentioned, Wushao has already identified several areas along the lake with strong spiritual energy. I have also sent the two green fish demons to seek out spirit juvenile fish that can channel spiritual energy for cultivation..."

Li Wushao continued, "I have also scouted the lakebed twice with An Zheyan and identified three locations with underground spirit veins that may contain mineral deposits. I have sent a group of lesser demons to dig and investigate; news should arrive soon."

"Good!" Li Yuanjiao nodded with satisfaction.

It had not been easy to tame a Foundation Establishment Realm demon, and to use Li Wushao merely as a bodyguard would have been a waste. Water creatures naturally admired strength and loved to gather in groups, and a Foundation Establishment Realm demon like Li Wushao held significant influence around the lake. Previously, the lake had only been a source of spirit items, but now, it could finally be fully developed.

Breeding spirit fish, collecting spirit items, mining veins, and gathering intelligence... These Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realm demons are different from human cultivators. They don't need to rely on Water Avoidance Spell to move freely on the lakebed, making them very efficient workers.

A small smile appeared on Li Yuanjiao's face.

And most importantly, there's no need to pay these demons a clan stipend!
𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

Li Wushao noticed that Li Yuanjiao appeared to be in a good mood and secretly breathed a sigh of relief before saying, "These little ones have already become my subordinates, but they lack any protective talismans. Whenever rogue cultivators pass by the lake, they often catch one or two of them on a whim..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded and instructed, "Go to the Jade Court Guards and retrieve some identification jade tokens. Distribute them to the creatures of the Jade Capital Stage for protection. For those below the Jade Capital Stage, organize them into groups. Passing rogue cultivators will give our family some respect and no longer cause trouble."

"Understood!" Li Wushao responded promptly.

Li Yuanjiao then asked, "Since the demons in the lake are difficult to track, in your opinion, are there any Foundation Establishment Realm creatures near the sea entrance of Lake Xian that we could capture?"

After recruiting Li Wushao, the Li Family now had one fewer Foundation Establishment Realm creature to offer as a sacrifice for Ximing and Xijun's talisman qi. Li Yuanjiao had sent Li Wushao to search the lakebed for a while, but the demons there were quite cunning and elusive. As a result, Li Yuanjiao decided to turn his attention to the Eastern Sea.

Li Wushao replied, "In my opinion, aside from that Azure Water Serpent Dragon, the others near the sea entrance are all mediocre. If you wish to capture one, I am afraid..."

Li Yuanjiao shook his head, and Li Wushao immediately understood.

"With the formation plate in your hand, the creatures in the lake won't be an issue, Master. To kill or capture them is merely a matter of your will."

Li Yuanjiao nodded.

"In that case, capture a creature quickly before Kong Tingyun comes."

As Li Yuanjiao and Li Wushao flew eastward, Li Qinghong went to Mushroom Forest Plain to enter seclusion, leaving Qingdu Peak rather empty. Li Ximing spent his days cultivating in the courtyard, with only Li Xijun guarding the mountain.

As the cold had not yet receded, Qingdu Peak, being quite tall, still had some snow at its summit. Li Xijun, who cultivated the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique, had taken advantage of the heavy snowfall in the previous months to break through to the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Having just come out of seclusion, he had not touched his sword for some time and was eager for a duel. He went around the mountain looking for opponents, eventually dragging Li Wen out of the Qingdu Cave Dwelling to spar with him.

Although Li Wen had reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, he was no match for Li Xijun in combat. His pair of heavy mace were particularly cumbersome while Li Xijun's sword technique was swift and agile, leading to his repeated defeats.

Dressed in white, Li Xijun wielded his sword, parrying Li Wen's two heavy maces to either side and then lightly tapping his sword against Li Wen's chest. He won three matches in a row, giving the burly man a good thrashing.

The burly man muttered a word or two under his breath, unable to come up with any words of flattery. He simply dropped his maces and fell to the ground, then said, "Young master... you are truly formidable."

Having just broken through to the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, Li Xijun's eyes sparkled with vitality.

"Brother Wen, your cultivation is commendable. Among the family branches, you are the only outstanding one. I hope you will continue to cultivate diligently and not fall behind," he said warmly.

The Li Family did not have many members in the Qi Cultivation Realm. Besides Li Xuanxuan, Li Xicheng from the foot of the mountain, Li Xijun himself, and Li Ximing in the alchemy room, Li Wen was their most trusted member.

Li Wen practiced the rapid cultivation method, Guardian of the Courtly Path, and became a Qi Cultivator before the age of thirty. While progress slowed down after reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm, his straightforward mind and diligent pursuit of the Dao allowed him to reach the third heavenly layer. He was on par with some of the external cultivators like Chen Mufeng.

Li Xijun had a positive opinion of this honest and loyal man, often seeking him out to practice combat techniques. Li Wen, in turn, did not disappoint, making significant progress over the past two years.

Li Wen nodded as he listened, his voice a low hum.

"I understand, young master."

Li Xijun smiled faintly as he sheathed his sword, and mentally calculated the days, thinking to himself, Ximing spends his days refining pills, yet his cultivation hasn't fallen behind much. At twenty-three years old, he's already at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. If I give him the white talisman from the pig demon, he might reach the fifth heavenly layer. If he reaches the eighth within seven years, with the help of talisman pills, our family could have a genius achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm in his thirties!

Thinking of this, Li Xijun mumbled to himself, "Perhaps I should ask Uncle Ping to relieve him of some more burdens..."

As he pondered these thoughts, Li Xijun walked for a while on Qingdu Peak, eventually arriving at the Alchemy Pavilion. He paused at the entrance, his expression turning strange when he heard moanings and grunting coming from within.

"My dear..."

After some time, the woman in the courtyard withdrew, and only then did Li Xijun step inside. He saw Li Ximing looking very relaxed while holding a jade slip, a satisfied expression on his face.

"Brother Ming," Li Xijun called out.

Li Ximing, seeing Li Xijun enter, put down the jade slip and tightened his belt, then smiled.

"What brings you here today?"

Li Xijun, who was naturally restrained in his behavior, frowned slightly, feeling the urge to reprimand him. However, seeing that Li Ximing was in a rare good mood, he decided not to spoil it and instead asked tactfully, "Where did that woman come from?"

Li Ximing replied, "She's a concubine from the Dou Family. It is difficult for cultivators in the Qi Cultivation Realm to have children... So, in my leisure time, I..."

Li Xijun let out a long breath as he noticed Li Ximing's anxious expression, and could not help but laugh.

"You are quite the lover of pleasures... I wonder who you take after."

Li Ximing forced a smile and said awkwardly, "Please, do not tease me."

Seeing that his brother's cultivation had indeed progressed with a growing aura, Li Xijun could not resist asking, "How long until you break through to the fourth heavenly layer?"

"About a year and a half," Li Ximing replied as if it were a matter of course.

Li Ximing had already broken through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and Li Xizhi was at the fourth heavenly layer. Li Xijun sighed, "Your talent is truly enviable."

Li Xizhi was five or six years older than the two of them, so his higher cultivation level was expected. But with Li Ximing, who was of a similar age, it was different. He spent his days refining pills, occasionally reading alchemy texts, and in his leisure time, invited performers to listen to music, and was truly living a carefree life.

Li Xijun, on the other hand, spent his days diligently cultivating and honing his swordsmanship, yet he was still overshadowed, falling further behind with each step.

The cultivation gap between them was growing.

Fortunately, Li Xijun had a strong will and despite his frustrations, he maintained a calm demeanor. Although the two brothers had once had a big argument, Li Xijun, feeling guilty, could not stay angry for long. Meanwhile, Li Ximing, who had thoroughly enjoyed himself, felt comfortable, and there was no lingering resentment between them.

As Li Xijun pondered, Li Ximing shook his head thoughtfully and said, "Actually, every time I engage in such intimate acts, I feel an improvement in my cultivation. The radiant essence within me becomes more active, like a blazing fire... Perhaps that is why I have been able to break through to the third heavenly layer so quickly."

"Is that so?" Li Xijun was slightly taken aback, looking at him skeptically. "Are you sure you are not just making excuses to indulge yourself?"

Li Ximing feigned anger. "What are you talking about!"

The two laughed for a while, but then Li Xijun suddenly gazed into the distance, noticing two beams of light approaching from the east. They were intercepted by the Jade Court Guards as they neared the boundary and hovered in the air for some time.

"I'll go take a look," Li Xijun said softly before taking to the air. Due to the nature of his cultivation technique, the wind he summoned was cold and biting. In the lingering chill of the weather, he traveled swiftly and reached the Jade Court Guards within just two breaths.

The Jade Court Guard in front of him was from the Chen Family. Having just broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, he cupped his fist in salute upon seeing Li Xijun and reported in a steady voice, "My lord, these two claim to have been sent by the Xiao Family. They say they are here to see the ancestor and have a letter personally written by the Xiao Family's ancestor."

Li Xijun swept his spiritual sense over the two individuals, observing that one was an older man and the other a young woman. The old man had a dignified face with thick eyebrows and large eyes, and had reached the ninth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm. The woman, with fair skin and good looks, was only at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She stood slightly to the side, glancing at him discreetly.

Seeing that the old man was at the ninth heavenly layer of his cultivation, Li Xijun subtly increased the distance between them before asking, "I am Li Xijun of the Li Family. May I ask which elder of the Xiao Family you have been sent by, and what is your purpose?"

The old man cupped his fist in response, saying, "I am Meng Taizhi, merely a rogue cultivator. Many years ago, while cultivating around the vicinity of the sword gate, I befriended ancestor Yuansi. Since my daughter's cultivation progress was lacking, he recommended that we come to the lake to find a place to gather the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth."

He then gestured to the young woman beside him. The woman, well-mannered and composed, bowed respectfully and said softly, "I am Meng Zhuoyun... Greetings, Senior."

Li Xijun accepted the letter handed to him by the Jade Court Guard but did not open it immediately. Instead, he used his mana to inspect it and, upon recognizing the familiar style of it, believed their story a little more.

"Please wait here for a moment. I will consult with my elders."

He then pointed out a place within the town for them to settle temporarily, instructing the Jade Court Guards to keep an eye on them before flying toward Lijing Town.

As a cultivator of Qingdu Peak, Li Xijun held a high status within the clan. He passed through the central hall where his uncle Li Yuanping sat at the head, with Li Xicheng listening beside him attentively.

By the time Li Xijun finished reporting the situation, Dou Yi had already unfolded the letter and presented it to Li Yuanping.

"...The Meng father and daughter have come to gather spiritual qi under the favor of our family's connection. They intend to stay for approximately twenty years. You need not treat them as guests out of regard for me, but they may be treated as guest cultivators and placed as you see fit. After twenty years, they may stay or leave at their discretion...

Daoist Taizhi is skilled in refining mineral essences, while his daughter, Zhuoyun, has trained under an alchemist overseas. They can both greatly contribute to your clan..."

Li Yuanping scanned the letter, confirming it was indeed written in Xiao Yuansi's handwriting. He then said, "Since it is at the request of ancestor Yuansi, send someone to ask the Meng father and daughter what they require and find a suitable place for them to get settled in."

Li Xicheng nodded in agreement, saying, "I will first test their abilities, then report back to the clan head."

Li Yuanping nodded. Xiao Yuansi's intention was clear—this was a mutually beneficial arrangement for both the Meng Family and the Li Family, and it was a kind gesture. While the Li Family might not urgently need these two, it was a rare opportunity to repay Xiao Yuansi's favor, and they should respond appropriately.

He coughed twice, frowning as he added, "Remember to have someone keep an eye on them."

Li Xicheng agreed, respectfully saying, "The family's sacrificial ritual has already been arranged, awaiting only the return of Second Uncle and Senior Wushao."




# Chapter 471: Generation of Xi and Yue Receives Talisman

Li Yuanjiao returned from the Eastern Sea after nearly half a year, standing atop the pitch-black Hooked Serpent and holding a massive white crucian carp demon that was the size of a house. Together, they made their way back from the north.

It was the height of summer, and the air was thick with the stench of fish. Li Yuanjiao tossed the white crucian carp demon into the lake and instructed Wushao to keep an eye on it before heading up the mountain.

Dressed in flowing white robes, Li Xijun rode the wind to meet him. The ever-stoic Li Yuanjiao had spent months chasing this demon fish with the Hooked Serpent across the vast Eastern Sea. At long last, they had captured the beast.

"The Eastern Sea is truly boundless! If one dives deep into it, even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator might not be able to find their way about," Li Yuanjiao remarked.

If not for Li Wushao's familiarity with the sea and the fact that they had prepared well with formations to seal their target, catching this demon would have likely taken much longer. If Li Yuanjiao had gone alone, he would have likely been worn down to death by the endless swarms of sea creatures.

Li Yuanjiao then reflected, "Even with my Jing Dragon King Dao Foundation, it was an exhausting effort... No wonder so few cultivators venture to the Eastern Sea."

After hearing this, Li Xijun softly reminded him, "Second Uncle, since we have captured the demon, should we not inquire about the Water Virtue matters to confirm whether Senior Wushao's earlier claims were accurate, just in case?"

Li Yuanjiao nodded, understanding his concerns.

"I have already questioned the demon. What Wushao mentioned aligns closely with the sea's common knowledge."

He continued, "On this journey, I encountered a disciple of the Wanyu Sword Gate. He's a carefree swordsman named Cheng Gao. He had aided me greatly by pointing out several harmful demon dens. You should remember this to treat any members of the Sword Gate with respect in the future."

"Understood," Li Xijun replied.

Li Yuanjiao then asked, "How many people know that our family sought the secret method for capturing spirituality from the Yuan Family?"

Li Xijun responded, "Anyone passing through and encountering Senior Wushao will likely inquire about it... Word should spread soon enough."

"Good." Li Yuanjiao nodded in satisfaction.

Li Xijun then reminded him, "Fei Luoya has visited twice already, urging us to deal with Fu Daimu as soon as possible. He mentioned that he would visit again in about a month."

Li Yuanjiao waved his hand, signaling that he was aware. He thought to himself, In these next few months, I will take care of this matter once and for all. Better to handle it now than let it fester and become a future threat...

Li Xijun smiled and added, "Everything is prepared within and outside the peak for the dual sacrificial rituals. We are only awaiting the offerings."

"Good, good. It is commendable that you younger ones can manage everything so well." Li Yuanjiao nodded, smiling.

"That is due to elder brother's efforts in overseeing everything. I dare not take credit," Li Xijun responded humbly, then pulled out a letter from his sleeve as he continued, "A letter from the Azure Pond Sect—most likely about Brother Xizhi's efforts in handling the Fu Daimu matter within the sect."

————

"The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion year upon year... Observing the three yuan festivals and six regular festivals, we maintain reverence—ensuring to pay timely respects... Through the smoke of our offerings and the blood of our sacrifice..."

The prayer proceeded as usual.

Blood qi and incense surged into the mirror, transforming into flowing talisman qi. This was the first time the Li Family had offered such a large number of sacrifices. Lu Jiangxian gathered the talisman qi into a mass in his hand, intending to insert a few cultivation techniques into it.

In the past, talisman qi did not come with attached cultivation techniques, but now Lu Jiangxian had amassed a mountain of cultivation methods, enough to bestow upon them for the next five hundred years—if not more. He expected there would only be more in the future.

The recipients of the talisman qi were naturally Li Ximing and Li Xijun. However, holding the talisman qi in hand and with so many techniques to choose from, Lu Jiangxian found himself at a loss as to what to include.

Lu Jiangxian weighed his options thoughtfully.

The Li Family right now isn't really lacking in various techniques... While there are many Foundation Establishment Realm techniques to choose from, gifting them might go to waste.

With Li Yuanjiao's breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment Realm, along with the addition of the Hooked Serpent and Li Qinghong as formidable assets, the family now had strong backing. Furthermore, Li Ximing, Li Xizhi, and Li Xijun also had the potential to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm. In another twenty to thirty years, these three could achieve their breakthroughs, finally solidifying the foundation of a prestigious clan.

The next goal of striving for the Purple Mansion Realm will likely be much more difficult...

He originally intended to perfect the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual and use it to cultivate a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. As there was no established Dao lineage for it in Jiangnan, he would not have to worry about external interference.

However, the current situation was fraught with uncertainty. Although Lu Jiangxian now knew many secrets about Purple Mansion Realm matters, his understanding was still hazy, making it difficult to gauge the temperament of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan. It would likely require multiple approaches.

"If a new Purple Mansion Realm family were to emerge, the Purple Mansion immortal clans of Chen and Xiao would probably welcome it... They'd be eager to see more Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to help alleviate the pressure on them. As for the three sects and seven gates, each has its own hidden agenda, making it difficult to predict the situation..."

His gaze shifted over the map of Yue State in front of him, eventually resting on the northern Yue Cultivating Sect.

"At the very least, neither the two sects nor the seven gates would want to see Shangyuan reach the Golden Core Realm. Though the Yue Cultivating Sect has always kept a low profile, Shangyuan has a righteous temperament. Which of the two sects and seven gates does not have some kind of shady dealings...? Another Golden Core Realm cultivator with a fierce sense of justice is not something they would welcome... As for the Buddhist sects, they'd be even less thrilled..."

Lu Jiangxian surveyed the surroundings and could not help but sigh.

"Shangyuan really is beset by enemies on all sides. No wonder there has been no movement; they are likely still engaged in behind-the-scenes power struggles and bartering interests."

Looking over the various cultivation techniques, Lu Jiangxian dismissed the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual—after all, the Yuan Family was still an ally of the Li Family, so gifting it would be pointless. Among the remaining options, the best was Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique, a Grade Four manual, but it lacked the essential spiritual qi.

Long Marching Pheasant Flame was a type of Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth, and the original qi gathering method required locating a type of spirit flame called Long Marching Fire Essence. Only by using this fire essence to gather yang qi could one acquire the Long Marching Pheasant Flame. However, such flames were exceedingly rare in Jiangnan, making it difficult to extract the necessary qi.

"That should not be too difficult..."

Lu Jiangxian suddenly had an epiphany.

Li Yuanjiao still possessed a portion of Profound Yang Li Fire, which could be transformed into Long Marching Fire Essence through the Yang Nourishing Technique. Although this would be costly, the Li Family had changed considerably in recent years, and gathering the necessary resources should no longer be an issue.

"I am just not sure if this technique has any corresponding Dao Partners..."

Lu Jiangxian had studied many records from the ancestors of rogue cultivators, gradually piecing together much about the Purple Mansion Realms of the three sects and seven gates.

The Azure Pond Sect mostly followed the Water Virtue Dao, the Golden Feather Sect focused on metal, stone, sand and smoke, while the Yue Cultivating Sect practiced techniques involving true jade and cloud smoke.

Among the seven gates, only a few practiced the Fire Virtue Dao. Hengzhu Dao Gate to the south was the only one known for its mastery of fire techniques and blessing arts—placing it among the stronger of the seven gates.

"While the Hengzhu Dao Gate has a good reputation, the Azure Pond Sect is fully capable of sending a Foundation Establishment Realm clan under their governance to Hengzhu Dao Gate if they wanted to..."

For a moment, Lu Jiangxian felt a headache coming on. He set aside Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique for now, allowing the Li Family to explore the matter themselves. He then sifted through the heap of techniques and found a secret technique's manual—Chilling Snow Series.

Lu Jiangxian discovered this secret technique manual in a demon den while Li Yuanjiao was traveling along the Great River. It was a collection of three gathering methods for cold qi and a technique for searching for spirit water.

Though one of the cold qi collection methods overlapped with what the Li Family already possessed, it still provided an opportunity to help cultivate Slaughter Jun Kui Light to its entry level.

With the talisman qi carefully chosen, Lu Jiangxian refocused his efforts on completing the Purple Mansion Realm section of the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual.




# Chapter 472: Eliminating Fu Daimu

Mount Qingdu.

Li Ximing left his courtyard for once and stood on the green altar with Li Xijun. He still did not dare to face his father, Li Yuanping, and kept his gaze lowered in silence.

Li Yuanjiao had just slaughtered the two demon creatures with the jade knife. He waited quietly until the auras of the two on the altar surged and only let out a sigh of relief when they finally sat down, cross-legged.

After all, the immortal mirror talisman was the one choosing its recipient. The two Foundation Establishment Realm monsters would be wasted if no talisman qi were provided. There were still more than ten Talisman Pills at home, which was enough to last them for now.

The Talisman Pills have the ability to aid in breaking through realms... Though not as effective for the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators as Qi Cultivators, they could be taken when breaking through to the late stage. When the Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill can be refined, the chances of reaching the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm will be greatly increased, and the process will be significantly expedited.

Li Yuanjiao mused to himself as he waited.

After meditating for a while, Li Xijun took a deep breath and opened his eyes first.

His eyebrows were sharp, highlighting the depth and intensity of his handsome eyes. Surrounded by a white mist, he exhaled a breath of white qi before standing up, announcing respectfully, "I have obtained Radiant Snow Pine Ridge and broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm!"

He paused, his demeanor calmer than before he received the talisman. Any hint of arrogance had faded, leaving a more composed and stable presence.

"With this talisman, my heart is as still as water, dispelling illusions and discerning details. My true essence and mana are like frost and snow, allowing me to cultivate twice as effectively even with only half the effort."

Smiling and nodding, Li Yuanjiao looked at him with approval.

Meanwhile, Li Ximing radiated golden-red light which circulated between his Shenyang Mansion and Juque Court. He opened his eyes and murmured softly, "I have broken through to the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Layer and obtained Valley Wind Leading Fire, which could use fire to attract qi and refine true essence."

He briefly introduced the skill and added with some surprise, "Not only did I break through, but I also acquired Pheasant Flame's Long March, which is a Grade Four cultivation technique."

"Cultivation technique...?" Li Yuanjiao repeated as he delightfully took out a blank jade slip.

Li Xijun, standing beside him, added, "I obtained a secret technique known as Chilling Snow Series."

Li Yuanjiao was very pleased and instructed them to record the details. He took out yet another jade slip and handed it to Li Ximing, saying, "This is the Yang Nourishing Technique I learned from Tu Longjian. I have reviewed it thoroughly and memorized it. Since you'll be working with fire to attract qi, it will benefit you to study this carefully."

He also presented a green jade bottle and explained, "This is Profound Yang Li Fire. You should take it and make use of it."

Li Ximing quickly accepted the items, then read the jade slip carefully, and replied with great enthusiasm, "I've heard that the immortal sect possesses a method to cultivate spirit fire internally... It allows one to draw the spirit fire of heaven and earth into their Shenyang Mansion, where it can be used to refine pills internally or expelled for defense. With Valley Wind Leading Fire, I'll be able to use it to refine pills too!"

"Profound Yang Li Fire is too volatile and intense for pill refinement. I plan to convert it to Long Marching Fire Essence, which is more suitable for refining pills and practicing the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique," he added.

Li Yuanjiao smiled with satisfaction, nodding repeatedly as he said, "That's exactly my intention!"

Li Ximing sighed in regret and continued, "It's a pity that this technique requires Long Marching Fire Essence rather than Spring Sun Spirit Fire. The Yang Nourishing Technique Manual lists over a dozen types of spirit fires. Spring Sun Spirit Fire is like the gentle spring sun, warm and nurturing, making it ideal for alchemy... It would be perfect if we had both types of spirit fire..."

"Hahahaha!"

In good spirits, Li Yuanjiao patted his shoulder and reminded him, "Fortunately, we acquired the Yang Nourishing Technique and the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique manuals through the immortal mirror, which is beyond our destiny. If we could also have the best spirit fire for alchemy, I would suspect this is a trap set up by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!"

Li Xijun had been standing close by, holding the Chilling Snow Series thoughtfully. Noticing Li Yuanjiao's smile, he said, "I'll descend the mountain to find someone to gather the necessary spiritual qi and cultivate this."

Li Yuanjiao nodded and addressed Li Ximing, "Don't worry about the spirit fire for now. Gathering the required spirit items will take some time... I'll send someone to look for them. You two should focus on stabilizing your cultivation in the meantime. There's no need to rush things! Stay in seclusion on the mountain for a few years and find an excuse for the changes in your cultivation."

Li Ximing and Li Xijun both cupped their fists and replied in unison, "Understood! We will follow your command."

————

Li Yuanjiao had been cultivating on Mount Qingdu for over a month when Fei Luoya arrived as scheduled.

Fei Luoya called out in front of the green mountain gate. Li Wushao emerged from the lake and, upon seeing Fei Luoya, called out loudly, "I am Li Wushao... What brings you here, Senior?"

"Hooked Serpent...?"

Fei Luoya, who was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, had bloodshot eyes that made him look rather intimidating.

He immediately recognized Li Wushao's true form and replied, "Eastern Sea demon tribe... It is indeed a blessing for you to be part of the Li Family."

Fei Luoya, hailing from Mount Yue, usually spoke in an authoritative and somewhat arrogant manner. He only softened his tone when addressing Li Tongya.
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝒆𝒘𝙚𝓫𝙣𝙤𝒗𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

Li Wushao nodded and praised, "Senior, you have sharp eyes."

Li Yuanjiao soon approached and cupped his fist, and greeted the man politely. However, Fei Luoya wasted no time and asked directly, "What news do you have? Can Li Tongya be of assistance? Shall we proceed with eliminating Fu Daimu immediately?"

Li Yuanjiao replied, "I've checked with people in the sect. Fu Daimu had a close friend who joined Azure Pond but died in the devil plague and has no significant backing. However, he does have a certain partnership with the peak master of Fuchen Peak among the thirty-six peaks."

Surprised to hear that the guy actually had connections with people in the Azure Pond Sect, Fei Luoya hurriedly asked, "What should we do then?"

Li Yuanjiao replied softly, "My son has looked into it. Their relationship is strictly transactional and Fuchen Peak doesn't want anything else to do with this person. After you and I deal with him, we can send some precious panacea to this fellow Daoist as a gesture of goodwill and forget about the whole thing."

Fei Luoya was delighted and exclaimed, "Thanks to the connections of your esteemed family, we now have many options!"

Li Yuanjiao smiled, already planning the next moves in his heart.

Fuchen Peak's master, Li Encheng, also known as Water Wall Pearl, is one of the few middle-class alchemists in the Azure Pond Sect and has been at the peak of Foundation Establishment Realm for many years. He will dismiss this small issue as he only views this person as a pawn for selling treasured panaceas.

Who knows, when we have Xizhi send a treasured panacea over, it could open up beneficial connections for him! If this young man has more influence in the sect, it will be advantageous for us too.

Most people from Mount Yue were fierce, and since Fei Luoya was eager to kill Fu Daimu, waiting for another day was no different than torturing him. He wanted to act immediately and urged anxiously, "What are we waiting for then, fellow Daoist? Let us set off immediately!"

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and explained, "Elders in the family are not permitted to act impulsively. We'll have to wait for another Daoist friend with Sprawling Azure Mountain."

Fei Luoya had no choice but to wait patiently. After more than a day, he saw a red light shooting through the sky. Yuan Chengdun arrived in a red jade boat which he slowly docked in front of the mountain.

He disembarked and stowed the boat away, smiling apologetically as he said, "My apologies for being late, I had to go to Helin Prefecture before coming here."

"No problem!"

Li Yuanjiao looked at the two men. Li Wushao, who had been hovering above the lake, also flew over and stood behind him.

Li Yuanjiao then nodded and said, "I have a powerful formation in hand. Fu Daimu won't be able to escape."

They all took off with the wind as Fei Luoya said, "Zhu Xian, my subordinate at the early stage of Foundation Establishment Realm, is keeping watch on Fu Daimu.

"With three in the early stage, two in the middle stage, and Yuan Chengdun's particular strength along with this formation, we won't fail!" Li Yuanjiao assured.

However, in his mind, he thought to himself, Even if this person were to change sides and ally with Fu Daimu against me, with Yuan Chengdun and the formation at my disposal, I would be well-positioned enough to advance or retreat without any issues.

————

Mount Wu was where Duanmu Kui used to cultivate. He was a peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had an immortal book in his possession, and his strength put him among the greatest Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan. Any Mount Yue cultivators who received pointers from him could become a formidable force.

Duanmu Kui never took these matters too seriously. He merely cultivated on Mount Wu where his disciples and descendants multiplied. He had been in seclusion there for over two hundred years, and there were twenty-nine Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from Mount Yue under his command.

When Duanmu Kui died suddenly, he left nothing for his disciples and descendants. The Mount Yue cultivators scattered like birds and beasts. Fu Daimu, Fei Luoya, and other powerful figures divided the territory of Mount Yue. The strongest among them, Jiao Zhongzi, took over Mount Wu, while Fu Daimu established himself in Great Jueting.

Fei Luoya, who was still riding the wind, explained, "Fu Daimu and I have had many conflicts over Mount Wu... He dislikes me and is far stronger. I've been secluding myself in my territory these years, ready to escape at any moment. But in today's world... who knows what's happening outside? I figured I should eliminate him as soon as possible."

The group chose a landing spot. Fei Luoya's subordinate, Zhu Xian, also arrived on the wind. He looked like a pure Easterner with nice facial features, and he was holding a rattan whip in hand.

"Zhu Xian greets fellow Daoists," he greeted while cupping his fist respectfully.

Li Yuanjiao returned the greeting along with others and then proceeded to set up the formation plate.

Fei Luoya then said, "We still need to lure him here. Please come with me, Daoist Yuan. That guy is cautious, and if we're not equally strong, he'll be suspicious and won't dare to chase after me."

Yuan Chengdun nodded in agreement.

"You and I will engage him in combat for a while, and Zhe Ledai, in the early stage of Foundation Establishment Realm, will definitely act. We'll pretend not to know and lure the enemy into the trap..."

As he left, his conversation with Fei Luoya gradually faded.

Li Yuanjiao watched them depart, narrowing his eyes slightly. He discreetly activated the Profound Patterned Bottle and followed from a distance. When he saw bursts of shamanic spells and mana light flashing in Great Jueting as well as Fei Luoya's yell of feigned surprise and anger, he retreated.

Soon after, two mana lights pursued him. Fu Daimu, in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, appeared as a wrinkled old man with a strong build and a long halberd. Zhe Ledai looked strong too, cursing as he wielded his dual swords with pride.

As the four men entered the formation, a green light quickly enveloped them and their expressions changed suddenly. Fei Luoya laughed wildly, and Fu Daimu, looking around, sneered at Zhu Xian.

"Junior brother...? I fear you've made a grave mistake!"

Zhu Xian, holding his long whip, replied calmly, "Thank you for your concern, Senior Brother. I came here today seeking additional resources for my cultivation."

Fu Daimu did not argue but instead glanced at Li Wushao and remarked, "You've even found a Hooked Serpent! Two at the early stage, two at the mid stage, and a major formation... It seems you're well prepared!"

Confident in his trump card, Fu Daimu entered the formation with no fear, laughing as he said, "Too bad, you've underestimated us!"

Zhe Ledai, wielding two swords, showed no change in his expression. He engaged Zhu Xian and Li Wushao directly, using his swords to block their oncoming attacks with steady precision.

Meanwhile, Fu Daimu fought against Yuan Chengdun and Fei Luoya. The clash was intense, filled with golden light and the scent of blood, and it was creating a huge commotion.

Li Yuanjiao, concealed by spirit mist, silently approached. Compared to the other three, Li Wushao's group seemed more mediocre. Despite being Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, they were more like three rogue cultivators that were still wielding Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts.

Zhe Ledai and Zhu Xian seemed unfamiliar with powerful spells, relying instead on their immortal foundations to test each other's strength. Although Li Wushao used to be formidable, he had grown weaker after losing the hooks on his tail.

Gradually, Li Yuanjiao closed in on the three men. He unsheathed the Qingche Sword, its green-white light flashing brightly. Zhe Ledai's expression changed as he raised his sword to block instantly.

"Not good!"

The Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact in Zhe Ledai's hand proved inadequate against the Qingche Sword. Li Yuanjiao had been gathering power for a long time, and the sword arc of the Celestial Moon Slash technique blazed brightly, striking Zhe Ledai's swords with such a powerful impact that it shattered them with a loud crack, sending sword fragments flying everywhere in all directions.

As Zhe Ledai struggled to defend himself, Li Wushao's snake tail sliced through the air powerfully, and Zhu Xian attacked relentlessly. The combined assault forced Zhe Ledai to spit blood, and he struggled to fend off yet another deadly strike from the Qingche Sword.

At that moment, Zhe Ledai felt a chill at his neck, a sense of dread filling his body completely. With a horrified cry, he realized as he exclaimed out loud, "Oh no... It's Jing Dragon King!"

His blood qi surged as he activated his shamanic spells. His true essence glowed a bright red as he glanced back, just in time to see a massive bluish-gray serpent dragon hurtling straight toward him. He raised his sword in defense and shouted, "Senior Brother! Hurry up!"

As a newly promoted Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Zhe Ledai's strength was formidable. He blocked Zhu Xian and Li Wushao with his two swords impressively. If Li Yuanjiao had to face him alone, it would definitely have been a challenging battle.

However, the ambush was sudden. Li Yuanjiao's attack was immediate and extremely powerful, catching Zhe Ledai off guard. However, he was not seriously injured.

Fu Daimu, noticing Zhe Ledai's struggle, knew that despite his best efforts, he could not force Yuan Chengdun's immortal foundation out of its position. With a frustrated sigh, Fu Daimu raised his sleeve, releasing a black and red artifact.

"Mountain of Human Heads!"

The dharma artifact expanded rapidly, its black and red surface covered with thousands of human heads. They stared, drooled, and howled. Their long black hair fluttered in the air, creating chilling gusts of wind.

Fei Luoya waved his hands and unleashed two streams of mana light, sneering as he said, "You went to the Jiang Family to seek cultivation methods, observed the Jade Smoke Mountain three times, and ended up making such a grotesque imitation of it?"

Despite his mockery, Fei Luoya remained vigilant, activating his Immortal Foundation Untraceable Presence, and vanished from plain sight.

The Mountain of Human Heads loomed menacingly, its filthy, eerie sounds filling the air.

Yuan Chengdun remained calm as the shadow of the enormous dharma artifact enveloped him. Holding his short rods tightly, golden patterns began to crawl up his face.

"Beast! Absurd! You dare use a demonic mountain to suppress me?"

With a burst of golden light, Yuan Chengdun activated his Sprawling Azure Mountain. He struck the massive mountain forcefully with his two rods, so fast that they turned into a golden blur.

RUMBLE!

The impact caused black smoke to billow from the Mountain of Human Heads. The human heads on it all screamed in unison, creating a loud cacophony. Yuan Chengdun continued with his relentless assault, his short rods smashing the dharma artifact with increasing speed, causing it to continue rumbling loudly.

Meanwhile, Fu Daimu, having just rescued Zhe Ledai, swept Li Yuanjiao and the others aside with a wave of his sleeve.

His face turned pale as he looked back, stunned.

"Sprawling Azure Mountain?! You're Yuan Chengdun!" he exclaimed in shock.

Yuan Chengdun's reputation was built by eliminating adversaries one after another.

Back when devil cultivators ravaged Mushroom Forest Plain, he defeated three-figure devil cultivators single-handedly. Three Foundation Establishment Realm devil cultivators even attempted to ambush him within a formation, yet he overcame them effortlessly and escaped unscathed.

In comparison, Xiao Yongling, the Man on Mount Feather, also fought against three opponents simultaneously. Although he emerged victorious, he sustained serious injuries, and his reputation never reached the heights of Yuan Chengdun's.

Fu Daimu recognized him from afar and, now with fear evident in his voice, called out, "You're... Daoist Yuan! Please reconsider your actions, I have backers within the sect!"
𝚏𝕣𝕖𝚎𝚠𝚎𝚋𝚗𝐨𝐯𝕖𝕝.𝕔𝐨𝕞

Li Tongya had slain the Maha with his sword, shocking the world, and became a renowned figure in Jiangnan. Yuan Chengdun's Sprawling Azure Mountain placed him among the top ten Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the last hundred years, so it was no wonder why Fu Daimu was momentarily thrown into disarray.

Yuan Chengdun did not respond, and only shook his head with a small smile. The Yuan Family had far more connections within the sect than the Li Family, so how could they not see through the trick? At that moment, he was just amused by Fu Daimu's threat.

Sprawling Azure Mountain excels at attacking and subduing evil, and this person's rod technique can be considered high-grade...

Fu Daimu's face darkened. Despite his surging mana, he was contemplating to escape. However, with the opponent's large formation and physical prowess, the success rate of his escape remained uncertain. His Dao Companion was still making breakthroughs in Great Jueting. Even if he could escape this time, they would still ambush him next time.

The odds stacked against him were just too high.

Li Yuanjiao and the others had no intention of giving him a chance to catch his breath, and various spells and sword techniques bombarded him relentlessly. Once again, Zhe Ledai lifted his broken dual swords to defend himself.

"Senior Brother, where did Fei Luoya find so many allies? I'm afraid we won't be able to get away today..." he said grimly.

Fu Daimu's spiritual sense continued to patrol the air, trying to locate Fei Luoya who had disappeared. With a surge of black qi in his hand, he smashed the incoming sword qi with his palm.

"I've underestimated this Fei Luoya! On one hand, he's begging for forgiveness; on the other, he's planning an ambush on me... If I had known, I wouldn't have trusted him!"

His expression grew more somber as he squeezed these words through his gritted teeth.

Zhe Ledai remained fully focused, gathering mana light as he held his swords up in front of him, blocking the maw of a lunging serpent dragon.

"Senior Brother! This is getting out of hand, it'll be difficult for both of us to escape alive. You have the Profound Light Escape Technique, please go quickly! I will stop them here for you," he transmitted his voice through mana.

Fu Daimu's subordinate was known for his calm demeanor and high talent. Promoted and recommended by Fu Daimu to train on Mount Wu, Zhe Ledai had always been loyal to him. And at this moment, he was already prepared to sacrifice himself.

Fu Daimu gritted his teeth and shook his head. On the other end, Yuan Chengdun continued striking the Mountain of Human Heads relentlessly with his rods as if it were a drum. As Fu Daimu was about to speak, a stream of red light suddenly appeared before him, shocking him into clasping his hands together in terror.

At that moment, Fu Daimu activated his immortal foundation, Descending Souls, his body releasing black light that enveloped his entire body like a veil or mist. A shrill whistling sound echoed, momentarily stunning the few early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in their places.

Clang!

Fu Daimu's hands radiated black light as he pressed them against Fei Luoya's dharma sword. The flowing red light from the dharma sword scorched his hands, causing black smoke to rise from the contact. He spat out another stream of black light from his mouth, forcing Fei Luoya to retreat, and only then could he finally catch his breath.

Although Fei Luoya was highly talented, he was still a rogue cultivator. Aside from Mount Wu's shamanic spells, he had only learned a few Grade Two spells which were not very powerful. Hence, he could only rely on his immortal foundation to challenge Fu Daimu. At that moment, instead of being defeated, he chose to withdraw and disappear.

Zhe Ledai breathed a sigh of relief as he fended off Li Wushao's attack, whispering urgently, "Senior brother, hurry up and go!"

Fu Daimu realized he could not afford to linger here any longer. He performed a hand seal to cast a spell, causing the black light of the Mountain of Human Heads to blossom intensely, briefly overshadowing Yuan Chengdun's golden light. With his other hand, he unleashed three talismans which illuminated a golden light as he activated the shamanic spell.

As Fu Daimu performed a series of maneuvers, Zhe Ledai's body also radiated a surge of blood-red light. His life essence burned, and his dual swords shimmered with dazzling light. Shifting into a guarding stance instead, he attacked ferociously like a tiger.

Fei Luoya suddenly reappeared, the dharma sword in his hand dancing as red light erupted around him. He quickly shouted, "He's going to use an escape technique! Don't let him escape!"

During the plague, a devil cultivator had also used a similar escape technique, transforming into a red light and zooming away. The Li Family had no way to stop it and could only allow him to escape at the time.

The escape spells differed from escape techniques. Most escape techniques only enhanced speed, whereas most escape spells involved changing forms and shuttling back and forth, crossing dangerous lands and large formations. However, they were very difficult to cultivate.

Li Yuanjiao saw Fu Daimu using defensive talismans and almost simultaneously guessed his intention. He pressed forward, calling out to the others, "Keep Fu Daimu from leaving!"

Allowing a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm Mount Yue cultivator from Mount Wu to escape would spell disaster for the Li Family in the future.

Those from Mount Yue had nothing to lose, but Li Yuanjiao and Yuan Chengdun had families to consider. Hence, the two were most nervous about letting their enemies slip away.

Yuan Chengdun bellowed angrily as he summoned the strength to topple over the Mountain of Human Heads. The strain caused his face to turn red, but he dared not catch his breath and quickly flew to Li Yuanjiao's side.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao pressed on, meeting the defense of a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman head-on. He activated his Jing Dragon King, conjuring a grayish-green serpent dragon that exploded into a series of mana water splashes upon colliding with the talisman.

Being quite versed in talisman cultivation, the three Foundation Establishment Realm talismans Fu Daimu had unleashed were powerful.

The series of attacks from Li Yuanjiao and Fei Luoya only managed to penetrate two layers of Fu Daimu's defense. Holding his ground, Fu Daimu seized this opportunity to cast his spells.

Fei Luoya's face paled as he clenched his teeth, biting off a piece of his tongue. Puffing up his cheeks, he spat out a blood arrow, shaking the golden light shield.

Seizing the moment to act, Li Yuanjiao sprang to his feet and thrust his Qingche Sword forward with ferocious intensity.

Rumble!

A ball of blood light exploded in the air. Despite being an early Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Zhe Ledai relied on his own strength to repel both Li Wushao and Zhu Xian. Still possessing enough power to counterattack, he drove his dual swords into Li Yuanjiao's back with all his might.

Li Yuanjiao was unwilling to give up on the rare opportunity he had been waiting for. As he seemed on the verge of surrender, the Six-Stone Cloud Plate suddenly appeared behind him.

Amidst the earth-yellow glow, the Profound Patterned Bottle released a profound spirit mist, effectively blocking the incoming swords.

Clang!

The Qingche Sword pierced through the remaining spell shield. The greenish-white sword light surged directly toward Fu Daimu's face.

Pfft!

Fu Daimu caught the Qingche Sword firmly with his hand but the sharp sword qi pierced through the back of his hand. The old man from Mount Yue was furious, his eyes reddening even more as the spell in his hand had been interrupted.

Li Yuanjiao was also taking a beating as he had concentrated all his mana and true essence into the Qingche Sword. Although the Six-Stone Cloud Plate and Profound Patterned Bottle were still activated, Zhe Ledai's dual sword penetrated them easily, causing Li Yuanjiao to spit out fresh blood with the vibration of their mana.

Fu Daimu's heart filled with rage. After such a delay, Yuan Chengdun, having toppled over the Mountain of Human Heads, had already arrived in front of him. His murderous aura was intense as he swung the two golden rods that were aimed directly at Fu Daimu.

The outcome has been decided.

Li Yuanjiao stepped back as he took a healing pill, and quietly observed the ensuing battle.

Zhe Ledai was already in a dire situation under the siege of Li Wushao and Zhu Xian. Fu Daimu was retreating from Yuan Chengdun's relentless attacks, and he also had to guard against Fei Luoya. The tide had clearly turned against him.

We'll just have to watch out for any desperate counterattack in his final moments.

Li Yuanjiao advanced with his sword, a profound spirit mist enveloping his body as he hovered on the edge of the battlefield, silently waiting for his opponents to exhaust their strength.

Zhe Ledai was already using secret techniques. Being surrounded by the three adversaries, he was soon covered in wounds and bloody holes, wilting under the assault. Li Wushao transformed into his true form, crushing Zhe Ledai's lower body with his tail while Zhu Xian lashed out with a rattan whip, tearing off his opponent's head.

"Junior Brother!!"

Fu Daimu had been his friend for over a hundred years. At that moment, tears welled up in his eyes and he nearly lost his mind from the grief. He had pushed the spell in his hand and his immortal foundation to its limit, yet he still could not escape.

Yuan Chengdun's power had grown increasingly formidable, and each strike he delivered was enhanced by the power of his immortal foundation. Unable to unleash his spell, Fu Daimu began showing signs of despair and madness.

Li Yuanjiao watched Fu Daimu's expression change repeatedly as if he were fighting for his life. He stood back in the air, secretly praying that this Old Mount Yue man would not break the formation as he could not afford to pay for it.

Fortunately, Kong Tingyun's formation plate was exceptionally durable, being a jade heirloom that could maintain a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm defense in any environment. In this battle, he lost only five or six Spirit Stones and more than a dozen jade stones. Li Yuanjiao was very delighted and yearned to possess this formation plate.

I wonder how many Spirit Stones this formation plate costs... If it's accidentally destroyed, I might really have to empty our family's vault.

While Li Yuanjiao was preoccupied with his thoughts, Fu Daimu had enveloped himself in a blood mist while fighting desperately.

Li Yuanjiao withdrew and continued waiting amongst the spirit mist. He did not have to wait long before a gust of blood wind swept past him.

The old Mount Yue man's head had been crushed into pieces.

"Brother Jiao, are you all right?"

Although Yuan Chengdun had depleted a significant amount of true essence in this battle, he still managed to fly toward Li Yuanjiao out of concern. Li Yuanjiao nodded and thanked him, then put away the formation plate.

As soon as the large formation was undone, they saw white insects filling the surrounding mountains, densely swarming with nowhere to land.

Fei Luoya nodded with a satisfied smile and remarked, "They are definitely dead! This is the phenomenon of Descending Souls."

Li Yuanjiao drew his sword and declared, "Now that the evil has been eliminated, I'll stay here to defend this place for a while. Great Jueting still has remnants—go and quickly eliminate them. If anyone hears of this, they'll definitely retaliate."

Fei Luoya nodded and threw Fu Daimu's storage pouch toward Li Yuanjiao, who took it with a nod and said simply, "We'll divide the spoils after we're done."

————

Great Jueting was an ancient, majestic city, once filled with a population of a hundred thousand at its peak. Fu Daimu had only ruled it for decades, but now fewer than ten thousand remained, mostly women dedicated to childbearing.

The fertile soil and abundant water of Jiangnan nurtured the land effectively—seeds scattered today would germinate tomorrow, and an acre of land could easily support a family. People settled down here, cultivating crop after crop. Fu Daimu had been cultivating here for decades, reaping significant benefits.

The boulder was polished smooth and flat with a few Mount Yue soldiers scattered atop it, standing in silence. A group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators flew past, and all the mortals kneeled and bowed in submission.

In Great Jueting's royal court, only a few hundred large copper pillars stood tall. On top of them were sporadically tied individuals, most reduced to desiccated corpses, with a small number of them still breathing.

All of them were Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators.

Li Yuanjiao and the others swiftly entered the hall, breaking the formation and searching for several secret chambers. One by one, they opened each chamber until they found Fu Daimu's Dao Companion in the deepest part of the palace. To their surprise, it was an old woman who was sitting cross-legged. Fei Luoya marched into the room and twisted her head off.

Fu Daimu was highly attentive; the indoor shielding formation was exquisitely crafted, so much so that when the group arrived, the woman remained unaware of their presence. She had a smile on her face, likely because her cultivation had reached a critical point.

In front of her lay a collection of evil, bloody objects. Li Yuanjiao glanced over them, knowing that all of them were gathered by Zhu Xian.

The group dispersed to search further. Fu Daimu had not established a Dao lineage; instead, he kept all his shamanic spells and secret techniques memorized in his mind, much to Fei Luoya's dismay. They only found a few spells in Zhe Ledai's secret chamber, which was better than nothing.

They opened the storage pouches of the Mount Yue men, spilling spirit items across the ground. Most of the items were common, but among them were five treasured panaceas and five glittering jade boxes that would make anyone's eyes gleam with greed.

The group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators returned to gather together. They first exchanged a few small secret arts and recorded them down, then laid out what they had obtained.

All their gazes were then drawn toward the Mountain of Human Heads, which after suffering considerable damage, had shrunk to the size of a human skull. The smaller human heads on it were densely packed, looking extremely terrifying.

Although Fu Daimu was not particularly skilled at refining weapons, his cultivation was built on this dharma weapon, sacrificing around eighty to a hundred thousand human lives which could threaten Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Even in the face of Sprawling Azure Mountain, it managed to hold out for the time it took for a stick of incense to burn... What a powerful weapon...

"This object should no longer be used. I will take it back to the clan to refashion it," Yuan Chengdun remarked casually as he picked up the item.

Having dealt the most damage during the siege, Yuan Chengdun naturally had the right to make the first pick.

Fei Luoya merely cupped his fist and said, "Brother Jiao, please go ahead!"

Li Yuanjiao accepted the invitation. He swept his eyes over the items, then said, "Let's take out a few types of treasured panaceas first. These are needed to establish connections with those on Fuchen Peak in the sect. If the Peak Master needs treasured panaceas in the future, I'll have to trouble you two, fellow Daoists."

"Of course."

Zhu Xian and Fei Luoya nodded in agreement, while Yuan Chengdun seemed thoughtful.

Li Yuanjiao collected three treasured panaceas, after making it clear that these were for building connections. He then took a Clear Cloud Elk Fruit, which could be used to solidify true essence and regenerate severed limbs.

Watching Li Yuanjiao take the fruit, Li Wushao finally breathed a silent sigh of relief. Since he would be the last to pick the spoils, he knew he would not be able to secure any treasured panacea.

As long as this panacea is in the master's hands, there's still hope of obtaining it... maybe I won't need to spend decades repairing my tail hooks... he thought quietly to himself.

Fei Luoya took the last treasured panacea, the Wall Mountain Essence Flower, which could assist in cultivation and increase mana. The remaining miscellaneous items were split equally between Li Wushao and Zhu Xian. Although their value was not high, at least they did not return empty-handed.

Yuan Chengdun had managed to obtain a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, and Fei Luoya's territory had doubled, leaving them in high spirits.

They rode the wind and departed, and Yuan Chengdun bade farewell to everyone with a bright smile before leaving. Fei Luoya stared at Great Jueting's remains in satisfaction.

Li Yuanjiao, fearing he might follow Fu Daimu's example, reminded him, "Fellow Daoist... don't follow Fu Daimu's path if you intend to align with us. That person in my family... abhors that path. Please be very mindful."

Fei Luoya was slightly stunned and hurriedly replied, "Of course! I understand."




# Chapter 476: Meng Taizhi

Li Yuanjiao and Fei Luoya exchanged a few words, both clearly in high spirits as they left the Great Jueting with smiles on their faces. Zhu Xian and Li Wushao, their followers, trailed behind.

Li Yuanjiao noticed Fei Luoya surveying the surroundings with keen interest and asked, "What plans do you have for the stretch of lush forests and fertile lands between Great Jueting and Eastern Mount Yue?"

Fei Luoya's slit eyes met Li Yuanjiao's gaze sharply as he replied, "When Fu Daimu was still around, all I could think of was running away at a moment's notice... I've never thought of overseeing Mount Yue. However, now that I have such a huge territory, I'll have to appoint several of my men to help gather spirit items, hunt demons, cultivate Spirit Paddies, and earn a certain amount of Spirit Stones annually..."

Li Yuanjiao chuckled and suggested, "My family excels in these endeavors. Why don't we share the land? Since the territory is yours, my family will manage the operations for you. I'm confident that in ten years, we'll see profits exceeding twenty Spirit Stones annually."

"Oh?"

Fei Luoya nodded slightly then asked a few more questions before subtly shifting the topic toward the Azure Pond Sect's Fuchen Peak. Noticing Fei Luoya's disinterest in a partnership, Li Yuanjiao exchanged a few more pleasantries before taking his leave.

Li Wushao, who had been silent, spoke only after they had flown a hundred li.

"Master, how severe is your injury?"

When Li Yuanjiao endured a dual sword strike from Zhe Ledai, Li Wushao feared for his life. Since his spirit was bound to Li Yuanjiao, any harm that befell him would spell the end for Li Wushao too.

Li Yuanjiao waved dismissively as he replied, "I'm fine. Once we return to the peak, you should enter seclusion and take the Clear Cloud Elk Fruit to regrow the two hooks on your tail."

"Thank you, Master!"

Li Wushao expressed his gratitude repeatedly, to which Li Yuanjiao simply responded, "You're part of the Li Family now; there's no need for such formalities."

Just then, a handsome young man in white approached them. With a sword slung across his back, he cupped his fist and greeted Li Yuanjiao.

"Congratulations on your success in exterminating another evil, Second Uncle!"

This young man was none other than Li Xijun.

Li Yuanjiao, eyeing him suspiciously, asked, "Is something amiss at home? What brings you all the way out here?"

Li Xijun replied softly, "I feared that Fei Luoya might attempt deceit or worse, so I couldn't help but watch from afar."

Li Yuanjiao turned to him with a puzzled look and asked slowly, "We were more than a hundred li away from here within a grand formation... You can see all the way over there?"

Li Xijun nodded, the frost and snow qi in his eyes swirling densely. He replied, "Thanks to the Radiant Snow Pine Ridge I received, my vision is exceedingly sharp, capable of dispelling illusions and discerning details. Even through formidable formations, I can glimpse the flowing mana lights and thus gauge the situation."

Li Yuanjiao's face lit up with pride as he nodded in approval.

"Excellent! You must try cultivating the Spirit Eye Perception when we return. With such a talent, you might be able to master it easily and wield it effectively."

As Li Xijun nodded in agreement, Li Yuanjiao continued, "Fei Luoya refuses to let our family intervene even though his territory could yield significant profits with our manpower..."

Li Xijun paused thoughtfully before realizing something and said, "Uncle, do not worry! Fei Luoya does not grasp the complexities of governance... He is alone; how will he manage every aspect by himself? He may think appointing a few Qi Cultivators will suffice, but when reality hits, he'll soon realize that he needs our help."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, adding, "Exactly. The ways of Mount Yue are entrenched—greed and fearlessness run deep. In Eastern Mount Yue, it took two Qi Cultivators and twelve Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators at Jade Capital from the Jade Court Guards enforcing strict discipline day and night to achieve what we have... Fei Luoya has no experience in these things and will definitely struggle."

The uncle and nephew conversed for a while before descending on Qingdu Peak. Upon landing, Li Xijun, with a solemn tone, said, "Clan Uncle! Our family has settled into Qingdu. Rogue cultivators now refer to us as the Li Family of Qingdu, thus solidifying our position. The old suffix Lijing no longer suits us... perhaps it's time for a change."

Whether Qingdu or Lijing, Li Yuanjiao was not concerned with titles and replied with a tone of indifference.

"As you wish, set it as you see fit."

As the group landed on the peak, a little girl squatting in front of the courtyard sprang up, smiling and running toward them.

"Father! Brother!"

"Xiang'er," Li Yuanjiao greeted. His daughter, whom he cherished deeply, had seen him rarely due to his years of seclusion and breakthroughs. This distance had caused some estrangement, and her bond with her cousin was evidently stronger, given how she grabbed Li Xijun's hand happily.

Observing them, Li Yuanjiao remarked with a chuckle, "Jun'er seems much more mature now."
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝙤𝓿𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝙤𝓶

With a warm smile, Li Xijun replied, "Uncle, Xiang'er will be tested for her spiritual orifice next year. I wonder if she will have one..."

Li Xijun wore a gentle and doting expression on his face. It was at this moment Li Yuanjiao realized that Li Xicheng and Li Ximing also had a gentle and subdued demeanor, which was strikingly different from his own fierce nature.

This generation is becoming more and more like those from the other prestigious clans out there... Li Yuanjiao mused silently with pride.

The Li Family's rapid ascent from humble beginnings to prominence meant they lacked the necessary wealth and connections. Due to various insecurities, the members of the first three generations were far from saints.

However, members of the generation of Xi and Yue, particularly Li Xicheng at the foot of the mountain, displayed a generosity and calmness typical of members from prestigious clans.

Li Xicheng, along with Li Xizhi and Li Ximing, were approachable and easy to converse with, but Li Yuanjiao was still uncertain as to whether this was their strength or weakness.

Yuan Chengdun and Xiao Ruyu also carry an air of submission, thanks to their substantial family backgrounds and influential connections... This made them adept at forming alliances and maintaining harmony.

These younger members had been fortunate to receive training in both cultivation and politics from an early age. It was only natural that they found the world to be sweet as honey, given that others deferred to them, showing respect to avoid conflict. They were also lucky to have the guidance of elders to keep them disciplined.

It's hard to determine whether being easygoing and generous or ruthless and cautious is better. Life is full of uncertainties, and it's challenging to make definitive judgments. As for Xijun...

Li Yuanjiao's thoughts trailed off as he turned his narrow gaze toward Li Xijun and suddenly called out to him.

"Jun'er."

Li Xijun lifted his head, his face noticeably more handsome than Li Yuanjiao. Frowning slightly in confusion, he tilted his head to express that he was waiting for him to continue.

Li Yuanjiao said softly, "It's often wise to keep a low profile. There's no need to be perfect. Make minor errors, suffer small setbacks..."

Li Xijun grew even more confused as he stared at his uncle, only to hear him say, "Even Ximing and Xicheng make mistakes, but I never worry because they always correct themselves. Yet you... I noticed that you have never faltered, and even hold a disdain for the world."

For the first time, Li Xijun felt the shock of being thoroughly understood. He could only stare back blankly, wordlessly.

Li Yuanjiao continued hoarsely, "My Big Brother was also a bright and gifted child since birth. He had only made one mistake in his life—picking up that thunder pearl. Good fortune often punishes the bold... Never underestimate this world."

The tragic fate of Li Yuanxiu served as a life lesson for all of them. His error had since introduced numerous troublesome rules to the Li Family and had shaped Li Yuanjiao into the skeptical and anxious man he was today.

Li Xijun bowed deeply, acknowledging his uncle's advice.

"I shall heed your wisdom, Uncle."

After imparting his advice, Li Yuanjiao felt a sharp pain in his back and tightness in his chest, and was reminded of the wound Zhe Ledai had inflicted on him. He knew he needed to address it urgently.

"I've sustained a minor injury and must recuperate. The seclusion of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator is long, and so I might be unavailable for a few years. Manage the family well in my absence, your brothers will follow your lead. Always consult with your seventh uncle on any matter."

Li Xijun nodded thoughtfully and, as Li Yuanjiao left, he lifted Li Yuexiang from the ground, saying softly, "Come. Big Brother will take you on a walk."

————

On Mount Lijing...

Dressed in brocade fur, Li Yuanping sat at the end of the hall as usual. Despite his pale face and slightly sunken eyes, he looked in better health after consuming a talisman pill, which had aided in his breakthrough to the Jade Capital stage recently.

This is as far as I can go...

Though the talisman pill had facilitated his breakthrough, it was but a fleeting reprieve. His cultivation still hung in a precarious balance, and another attempt at advancement could hasten his demise.

Setting aside the letter he had been reading without any apparent change in his expression, he motioned for Li Xicheng at his side and whispered, "Is Meng Taizhi and his daughter around...?"

Li Xicheng cupped his fist and replied, "Meng Taizhi had ventured out to gather qi and has only just returned. I have already sent someone to summon them."

As soon as he finished speaking, an old Qi Cultivator at the ninth heavenly layer, with a dignified demeanor, entered the hall. He came up, cupping his fist as he greeted, "Rogue cultivator Meng Taizhi greets Family Head."

Li Yuanping acknowledged him with a wave of his hand and then got straight to the point. "No need for such formality, Elder Meng. I heard that you can craft Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts... Is that true?"

Meng Taizhi nodded and replied confidently, "I have some expertise in crafting artifacts and am quite skilled with Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts. If you wish, I can craft such artifacts for your family to offset the cost of gathering Qi."

Li Yuanping smiled and inquired further, "Refining artifacts is no small feat, Elder Meng. How much time can you dedicate to this task?"

Meng Taizhi responded with a bow, "Should your clan provide the materials, producing one artifact every two months is feasible."

Li Yuanping nodded thoughtfully and remarked, "That's sixty artifacts over ten years... That's quite an impressive number."

The Li Family typically acquired dharma artifacts by looting or purchasing them at a high price. These artifacts were crucial for distributing power within the peak's hierarchy and rewarding the younger members. If they could secure this batch of artifacts, it would greatly ease their future endeavors.

Our family possesses Ebony Ores, which are ideal materials for crafting Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts... With these, setting up new offices on future peaks will be more convenient!

Yet, he harbored suspicions about Meng Taizhi's seemingly generous offer and wondered about his ulterior motives. Clutching Xiao Yuansi's letter, he speculated, Meng Taizhi and his daughter could gather qi themselves... Their willingness to assist us might be concealing deeper intentions.

Li Yuanping was reluctant to owe anyone a favor. Glancing at Li Xicheng beside him, he offered a diplomatic smile and said, "It would be improper to trouble you, Senior, especially after your long journey. Fortunately, my family still has some reserves. Perhaps we could commission your services for now and offer some compensation, Elder Meng."

Meng Taizhi cupped his fist and replied, "You're too kind, Family Head. Assisting with such a modest task is hardly a problem. However..."

Having already anticipated the "however" from Meng Taizhi, Li Yuanping waited for him to continue.

"My daughter possesses the talent to conjure core flame necessary for refining pills, but alas, as a lowly blacksmith, I lack the skills to guide her further..."

He bowed deeply and added, "At the age of one hundred and eighty, my years are numbered. My greatest concern is my daughter's future, particularly in securing an alchemy legacy to establish herself... Should we acquire your family's alchemy legacy, we promise to maintain secrecy!"

"Refining a dharma artifact for your family is merely one way to express our gratitude. I'll be happy to help in any way I can, as long as it is within my capabilities!"

So this is his intention!

Feeling a sense of clarity, Li Yuanping placed the letter he had been holding on the desk and spoke calmly, "Elder Meng, there is nothing else my family needs right now. I understand your urgency to secure the alchemy legacy, however, I must consult with the ancestor of my family first."

"Yes, Family Head!" Meng Taizhi said right away, thanking him several times. Li Yuanping inquired about a few more details, discussed unrelated matters briefly, then dismissed him.

Li Xicheng, who had been observing quietly, stepped forward and suggested, "Family Head, given that Elder Meng and his daughter possess unique talents and skills, why not consider recruiting them into our family? Once Meng Zhuoyun attains the status of an alchemist, Brother Ming's burdens will be significantly alleviated..."

"Hmm," Li Yuanping murmured thoughtfully. He gathered the small letters scattered on the desk, sliding them to the corner, and then said, "Take a look at these."

Li Xicheng approached the desk and began to read through the small pile of letters.

"I have reached the Crimson Reef Island Market of the Eastern Sea... there is no alchemist surnamed Meng here... nor have anyone heard of any by that surname leaving the area..."

"I am now at Chunyi Island of the Eastern Sea..."

"I am now at Bamboo Creek Island of the Eastern Sea..."

After Li Xicheng finished reading all the letters, Li Yuanping explained, "I've already sent people to each of the islands to trace the origins of Meng Zhuoyun and other spirit items, but there's no record of any cultivator surnamed Meng skilled in crafting artifacts, nor any recent departures of such cultivator from the Eastern Sea."

"Even the locations Meng Taizhi mentioned led nowhere," Li Yuanping added, tapping the desk.

"His background remains a mystery, making it difficult to trace his origins. Without definitive information about his past, can we just simply recruit him into our family?" he asked, prompting his junior to think.

Seeing the contemplative look on Li Xicheng's face, Li Yuanping continued, "There's no rush. We have a decade to investigate this matter thoroughly. Just stay vigilant and patient, and we'll eventually uncover the truth."

"I've arranged for a team to assist you once you assume leadership of our house. They will methodically follow up on these leads," he said.

Li Xicheng nodded, feeling the weight of his responsibilities. Having observed Li Yuanping navigate similar challenges over the years, he now understood the difficulties his cousin, Li Ximing, had faced.

Although he had only taken over the restructured Li Family, he could already imagine how much harder it must have been for Li Ximing to handle everything in the past.

Just then, a clan soldier approached to report that An Zheyan and his two sons had returned from their survey of the ore vein on the southern shore.

"Excellent! Bring them in immediately," Li Yuanping responded, his spirits lifted as he coughed lightly.

Soon, three men entered the hall together, led by a Qi Cultivator with a shiny shaved head, who was at the ninth heavenly layer.

He cupped his fist and greeted, "An Zheyan greets Family Head!"

Li Yuanping nodded.

Despite looking like a strong bear, An Zheyan's tone was deferential as he continued reporting, "I have completed my investigation on the fourteen anomalies along the southern shore, two were ore veins and seven water veins of high value. Congratulations are in order, Family Head!"

"Two ore veins?!" Li Yuanping exclaimed, rising quickly to his feet.

"What type of ore veins are they?"




# Chapter 478: Li Encheng

An Zheyan offered his congratulations and said, "I discovered two mineral veins in the lake. One is Radiant Spirit Lead, an Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit ore, with reserves of about four hundred thousand jin. The other is Ni Water Frost Iron, at the Qi Cultivation Realm, with around two hundred thousand jin."

His face was filled with excitement as he continued, "These two veins are quite substantial, enough to last us for several hundred years!"

Li Yuanping was visibly shaken by the news, and an expression of sheer joy flashed across his face. He immediately grasped the key point and continued to ask, "Radiant Spirit Lead and Ni Water Frost Iron are not like Ebony Ore, which can be used immediately after extraction... They probably need to be refined first, right?"

An Zheyan nodded and replied, "Radiant Spirit Lead is a spirit material often used in crafting. It takes one hundred jin of ore to extract a finger-sized amount of powder, but even that can sell for a single Spirit Stone!"

He took out two pieces of ore from his chest pocket. One was earthy yellow with grayish hues and covered in circular patterns, while the other was quite beautiful, covered by blue and white patterns, looking almost like a gemstone.

Handing them to Li Xicheng, he continued, "Ni Water Frost Iron is more valuable. Though the vein is a bit poor, two hundred jin of ore can still yield a fist-sized piece of Frost Iron, which is worth several Spirit Stones."

"Good!"

Li Yuanping nodded after hearing this. Manpower was currently the least of the Li Family's concerns. In fact, the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators from the various mountains were quite free. With these two mineral veins, the refining work could be arranged, saving those cultivators from idleness.

He then added, "You have also met Li Wushao. With the help of these demonic creatures, how much ore can be mined each year?"

An Zheyan replied, "About a thousand jin of Radiant Spirit Lead. As for Ni Water Frost Iron, it's harder to mine and requires Qi Cultivators to personally dig it out. If we could extract two hundred jin a year, that would already be impressive."

An annual income of more than ten Spirit Stones, nearly a hundred in five years... that is quite good!

Li Yuanping smiled slightly. Radiant Spirit Lead was fairly common, as most Embryonic Breathing Realm artifacts could use it. Selling it would not be an issue, but Ni Water Frost Iron was extremely valuable, so it would be best to save it for the family's use.

Having made up his mind, he arranged for the Jade Court Guards to accompany An Zheyan, and said to Li Xicheng who was by his side, "Go and summon Li Wushao. If we are going to command the demons at the bottom of the lake to mine, we will need the Hooked Serpent's help."

Li Xicheng nodded and withdrew, while Li Yuanping calculated carefully, "In a few years, the spirit fish we are breeding will gradually yield returns. The two types of minerals will produce at least a dozen Spirit Stones annually. This way, Xicheng will not need to worry about the finances of the household in the future."

If it were not for the need for Spirit Stones, Li Yuanping would not have been willing to sell these minerals. Once they produced their own weaponsmith, the price difference between selling raw materials and selling finished artifacts would be worlds apart.

The Li Family did possess a few smithing techniques that were acquired from rogue cultivators, but they were not easy to use. They required fire veins to barely forge Embryonic Breathing Realm artifacts, and the cost was enormous. Since the family did not have any fire veins, they had to abandon the idea for now.

Li Yuanping silently calculated, "I wonder if we can obtain Meng Taizhi's smithing legacy... From the looks of it, he seems to be able to craft artifacts without fire veins. The old man does not have many years left; getting my hands on the legacy should not be too difficult..."

He recalled Meng Taizhi's words and expressions earlier and could not quite figure them out.

————

The lakeshore.

Meng Taizhi descended from the air, riding the wind back to the shore. The small cabin by the lake was still lit, and he pushed open the door to enter. Inside, Meng Zhuoyun was silently cultivating.

"Yun'er," Meng Taizhi called out.

Meng Zhuoyun, with her delicate features and skin fairer than snow, appeared rather young. She was meditating on the bed.

When she saw Meng Taizhi enter the room, she quietly asked, "How is the Li Family? Although Xiao Yuansi has ties with grandfather, he is a lord from a prestigious clan, unacquainted with the harshness of the world..."

Meng Taizhi shook his head, speaking in a deep tone, "The Li Family may be a rising power, but their discipline is strict. The Li Family's ancestor is probably an old-fashioned traditionalist, keeping everything under tight control and governance. And with the Xiao Family ancestor's letter, they surely will not harm us."

Meng Taizhi pondered for a moment before continuing, "I have not met Li Yuanjiao yet, but Li Yuanping is quite a figure. Unfortunately... his face seems pale and his breath is weak. He's likely gravely injured. I'm afraid he does not have many years left to live."

Meng Zhuoyun furrowed her brow slightly, puzzled as she asked, "How could a sword immortal clan like the Li Family have such a frail clan head? There must be something wrong... Devil cultivators have run rampant for years; I refuse to believe they do not have secret techniques!"

Meng Taizhi shook his head, stroking the long beard on his chin as he responded thoughtfully, "The Li Family is ruthless toward cultivators, but they have a peculiar compassion for mortals. Bound by worldly morals, they refuse to use secret techniques to save their own kin. They merely stand by and watch such individuals die. It is truly a pity..."

After a pause, the old man continued, "Perhaps it is for the best. That man is highly skilled, and if he were to take control of the family, we would still feel ill at ease even if we did not harbor any ulterior motives toward them."

Meng Zhuoyun, now confused, asked, "Seriously? The lives of a hundred unrelated mortals versus a capable, trustworthy brother—how could anyone not see the difference? It's hard to believe that a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator like Li Yuanjiao cannot tell which is more important. It has been a thousand years since the great war between the immortals and devils, yet such families still exist... I'd heard rumors in the Eastern Sea of conservative sects and families clinging to outdated ways, but I never thought it was true!"

"Best not to speak too much!" Meng Taizhi cautioned, then said, "I have made things clear with Li Yuanping. Gaining the alchemy legacy should not be an issue, but Li Yuanping still does not trust me, and he has not shown any intention of taking me in. When I die, I am afraid you will be forced to wander the Yue State."

A look of regret crossed his face as he continued, "I had hoped the Li Family, now flourishing, would be the best option. Li Tongya is a renowned sword cultivator, and Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong are incredibly gifted, with more talent emerging in their lineage. If I could pledge allegiance to this family, it would be ideal. But sadly, he does not trust me."

Meng Zhuoyun remained silent, and Meng Taizhi sighed as he continued sorrowfully, "If Li Yuanping still does not trust me when my time is almost up, I will stop holding back. I will offer all my smithing knowledge to the Li Family, asking only that you learn a few alchemy secret techniques from Li Ximing. At least that way, you will have something to rely on for your future. The Azure Pond Sect's territories are much like the Eastern Sea. You should head for the Golden Feather Sect instead... It is safer there."

As Meng Zhuoyun listened, she tightened her grip on a dark golden, bronze mirror and said softly with a sigh, "It is a shame that my husband was killed by that rogue cultivator. If not for that, with his abilities, I would not have to live such a life of constant wandering."

"It's pointless to talk about that now... "

Meng Taizhi let out several deep sighs, his face filled with despair as he continued, "Who could have predicted such a thing..? That a cultivator at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm would be slain by a mere early-stage Qi Cultivator? On top of that, he actually died at the hands of a rogue cultivator during his journey!"

The old man raised his white-haired head, tears streaking down his cheeks as he lamented, "I regret everything... We should not have provoked Tu Longjian! It has led us to this downfall!"

But Meng Zhuoyun's expression remained cold as she spoke softly, "I have no regrets. I'll kill him sooner or later."

Azure Pond Sect.

In the bamboo forest atop Qingsui Peak, a young man clad in feathered robes sat cross-legged. As a gentle breeze stirred, he opened his eyes, a smile slowly spreading across his face.

"I've mastered the Dawn Imperial Movement!"

The Dawn Dew Gathering Technique was a cultivation method perfected over five hundred years by the Azure Pond Sect. It came with a complete set of techniques and was considered one of the best among Grade Four techniques. Li Xizhi was one of those who practiced it, particularly the levitation technique it included.

Unfortunately, this method could only be cultivated to the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Every disciple of the Azure Pond Sect aspired to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. Since this technique offered no benefits in alchemy or smithing, very few chose to practice it.

Li Xizhi had often been looked down upon by his peers for following this path, but he never took it to heart, focusing only on his cultivation.

Rising to his feet, a six-colored aura of vibrant energy swirled beneath him, lifting him into the air. Clad in a black feathered robe gifted to him by Yang Xiao'er, he truly appeared like an immortal.

Flying above Qingsui Peak for a while, he felt quite satisfied with himself.

With the River Crossing Torrential Step for quick movement and the Dawn Imperial Movement for levitation, even a peak Qi Cultivator would have a hard time killing me. Once I master the Six-Colored Essence Evasion, I will hardly have to fear any danger while traveling outside with a few talismans on hand.

Looking at the swirling six-colored qi beneath his feet, he sighed regretfully.

Everything about this technique is excellent, except for its brilliance. It is far too conspicuous... Anyone can tell it is a mystical technique at a glance—definitely not discreet enough.

Li Xizhi chuckled at his own dissatisfaction and descended on the wind, only to see Yang Xiao'er flying toward him, holding a tiny storage pouch in her hand.

At the start, she had been anxious, but Li Xizhi had always treated her kindly, and over time, the girl had grown more at ease in his presence. She was now smiling radiantly, her eyes filled with affection for him.

"My dear, there is news from home!" Yang Xiao'er announced happily.

Li Xizhi quickly took the pouch, probing it with his spiritual sense. He found three jade boxes sealed within. After reading the small letter tucked inside, he fell silent.

Yang Xiao'er stepped forward and asked softly, "What does it say?"

Li Xizhi led her back down to the bamboo forest, taking her hand and speaking in a low voice, "Things at home have gone well. It seems I will need to make a trip to Fuchen Peak and see if I can make a connection there... After all, that person is a peak Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist."

Yang Xiao'er pursed her lips and said, "Li Encheng has a strange temper and has never aligned himself with any faction... Making amends is one thing, but it will not be easy to build a connection with him. You might end up humiliated instead..."
𝐟𝐫𝕖𝗲𝘄𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝕧𝐞𝚕.𝕔𝕠𝐦

The Azure Pond Sect was a grand sect with a five-hundred-year history and a colossal presence in Yue State. It dominated the southern two prefectures and the Azure Pond Mountain Range, influenced the five gates to the east, and suppressed the thriving Changxiao Gate to the west. In border regions like Moongaze and Lixia, it maintained control through heavy taxes and bloodshed. Every territory was strictly governed, and the sect's stability was unrivaled.

However, within the Azure Pond Sect, factions flourished. The Yuan Xiu and Yuanwu factions were the largest, but many smaller factions existed as well. Peak masters, elders, and Daoist Masters were locked in constant power struggles, with Sect Master Chi Zhiyun barely managing to maintain a precarious balance.

"No, I still have to try."

Li Xizhi thought carefully and responded, "The Chi Family's numbers are dwindling within the sect. They have been relying on the Ning Family to control the various peaks, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to face the Yuanwu faction. Furthermore, the recent imbalance in the distribution of resources from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven has only led to more provocations from Yuan Xiu's side... Chi Zhiyun has been sidelined for the most part and cannot manage everything."

With a slight pause, he continued, "If I want my family to have a foothold in Yue State through the Azure Pond Sect, I need to build a few connections here. At the very least, I want us to be seen as dogs, not just fodder. This is a great opportunity—I cannot afford to miss it!"

Yang Xiao'er gazed at him with concern, her ordinary features brought to life by the tenderness in her eyes.

"But... Master's Yuan Family belongs to the Daoist Master Buzi's lineage. My family's status is delicate; we have never dared to form alliances. If you go through with this..."

Yang Xiao'er hesitated and the rest of her words were left unspoken.

The Yuan Family's ancestor made a mistake in his youth and was exiled from the sect. His time is almost up now, and their influence within the sect weakens by the year. If there were any favors left, Master would have already introduced me to the people of Tianzi Peak!

Li Xizhi understood her concern. Yuan Tuan had hinted at this multiple times in private, but it was not something he could say aloud. Instead, he simply assured, "Do not worry. Master is also on the peak."

Hearing this, Yang Xiao'er realized that Yuan Tuan must have had a hand in this as well, so she said nothing more and simply nodded in agreement.

Li Xizhi flew off from Qingsui Peak, his thoughts running through everything twice over. "Granduncle has gained the favor of a Daoist Master in Yi Mountain City, and he already has the Ning Family backing him... But Daoist Master Yuan Su always keeps to himself in Yi Mountain City, never meddling in sect affairs..."

Li Xizhi knew that the Ning Family held his own family in high regard, but he still did not consider relying on them as the best option.

If I can establish a relationship with Li Encheng, everything will fall into place. My family needs a voice of its own in the Azure Pond Sect. Afterward, we can align with the Ning Family in a cooperative manner, rather than becoming their vassals...

He understood the vast difference in status between them. After drifting in the clouds for a while, he descended in front of Fuchen Peak. A young Daoist boy from the peak approached and asked, "May I ask if the immortal seeks pills? What guidance do you require?"

Li Xizhi dared not act with arrogance. He cupped his fist and said softly, "Li Xizhi of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake, I am here to pay my respects."

He did not mention Qingsui Peak but instead came under the name of the Li Family, subtly implying that if he could not even get past this gate, he might as well give up and leave.

The Daoist boy went up to report, and soon the clouds and mist of the formation parted. Li Xizhi landed on the peak and saw the ground covered in a crimson hue, not knowing how many fire veins lay buried beneath it. Jagged boulders were scattered about, and the palace ahead stood tall and proud, resembling a massive cauldron.

He entered the great hall respectfully. Seated at the head of the room was a tall, thin old man in white robes, his frame gaunt. He was holding a white jade wine jug, drinking to his heart's content.

Upon seeing Li Xizhi, the old man frowned deeply and spoke bluntly, "The Li Family..? I have never had dealings with your clan. What business do you seek with me?"

Li Xizhi noticed the man's impatience and his heart sank. Still, he kept his tone humble and deferential as he said, "Xizhi greets Peak Master. I have heard that a Mount Yue cultivator from Moongaze Lake often gathered precious herbs for you..."

Li Encheng paused for a full breath, then finally remembered, "Ah, yes... that is true."

Li Encheng's thin cheeks twitched as he frowned and drank. Li Xizhi continued, "That Mount Yue cultivator recently broke through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm and became quite arrogant. A few days ago, he intruded upon my family's territory and was slain by my family in alliance with the Yuan Family. I have come to inform the Peak Master of this matter."

"And I thought it was something important!"

Li Encheng had nearly forgotten about this person. The smell of alcohol hung heavy around him as he waved his hand dismissively and said, "So, he is dead. It makes no difference, really. At most, it will just take a bit more time to find more herbs. You did not need to make this trip... Now, go back!"

Li Xizhi quickly responded, "My family feels deeply remorseful and wishes to make amends to the Peak Master..."

"Oh?"

Li Encheng then took a slow sip of wine, his eyes narrowing into a smile as he asked, "How do you propose to make amends?"

Li Xizhi kneeled and respectfully replied, "My Li Family resides by the lakeside, with Mount Dali behind us, the great desert to the west, Xu and Zhao States to the north, and the sea to the east. We have many opportunities to acquire various spirit treasures. If the Peak Master has any needs, my family would be honored to handle them on your behalf!"




# Chapter 480: Arrival of the Kong Family

Li Encheng sat still, studying Li Xizhi's expression for a while before replying calmly, "I have my own people to handle this. Your family is an esteemed sword immortal clan, I can't possibly have you do such a thing. I'm merely looking for a sample of the Blood Sun Fruit on Mount Yue, and that Mount Yue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator named..."

He paused for a moment, as if unsure what that Mount Yue cultivator's name even was. Fortunately, Li Xizhi stepped in, reminding Li Encheng of his name.

"Ah yes, Fu Daimu. He somehow found out about this and approached my manager at Xuanyuan Market and brought him there. In any case, it is not a big deal. I will have someone else continue the search, there's no need to trouble your esteemed clan!"

"As for the others..."

He narrowed his eyes slightly, lowering his voice before continuing, "I have no desire to cultivate friendships with any peaks. Please return to where you came from, back to Qingsui Peak."

"Understood," Li Xizhi replied. He offered an apology, then exited the hall without a change in his expression. As soon as he reached the steps outside, a middle-aged man approached him.

It was Li Encheng's second disciple. The man attempted to say something nice to Li Xizhi on behalf of his master, to which Li Xizhi smiled in response before leaving with the wind.

The middle-aged man entered the hall and saw Li Encheng sipping from a wine cup at the top. He lowered his voice and said, "Father! This is..."

Li Encheng shot him a glare, prompting the middle-aged man to close the door hastily and activate an isolating formation before continuing.

"This Li Family is our own, and it is very weak—merely a name at this point. They are just what we needed right now! The Azure Pond has had a firm hold over our people for so long and you've been thinking this for quite a while... Why drive them away?"

Li Encheng shrugged dismissively and replied, "Why does it matter? I've told him everything necessary. It doesn't matter whether my tone is harsh or not. Don't confuse Yuan Tuan and Li Xizhi with Si Yuanbai... Even Xiao Yuansi has his own agenda."

The middle-aged man recalled Li Xizhi's expression and nodded hesitantly.

————

Qingsui Peak.

Li Xizhi rode the wind back to the courtyard, closing the door behind him. Yang Xiao'er then asked, "What did Water Wall Pearl say?"

"It's settled."

Li Xizhi nodded with a smile. He then picked up a brush from the table and began writing a letter.

"... Have our prominent clans find the Blood Sun Fruit... Send it to the Azure Pond's sect manager at Xuanyuan Market. This person is Li Encheng's subordinate..."

Li Encheng was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator; how could he not remember a name? Moreover, Li Xizhi had clearly mentioned Fu Daimu's name. Li Encheng's behavior seemed intended to downplay this person's significance which was an unmistakable hint of his willingness to forge a connection with them.

He had also made his requests clear—first, to acquire the Blood Sun Fruit, and second, to contact him through his man at Xuanyuan Market, rather than return to Fuchen Peak.

"This person has kept to himself in the sect for many years; he certainly has his own reason..." Li Xizhi mused.

After a moment of contemplation, he set down his brush and turned to Yang Xiao'er.

"Xiao'er, I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you to head to the Imperial Cloud Peak to investigate what transpired before and after Li Encheng joined the sect... whether he offended anyone, and why he might feel silenced even in his own peak."

Although Li Encheng was a master alchemist, he was entirely at the mercy of Yundan Peak. Most of the favors he sought were funneled through them. He poured effort into refining pills and elixirs, only for the majority of the credits and benefits to be claimed by Yundan Peak.

His behavior had always been peculiar, leading others to believe he was indifferent. But now, Li Xizhi found this odd and did not want his father to act impulsively—he planned to uncover the truth first.

Yang Tianya must have covered for my family; he likely has ties to us or some connection to the Xiao Family. Going to Imperial Cloud Peak can help us gather real information without revealing our intentions.

He put aside his brush and took out the jade slip titled Six-Colored Essence Evasion. The senior who created this escape spell was obviously a vain person as the jade slip was colorful and engraved with intricate patterns.

When it comes to the brilliance of true essence, the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique is truly top-tier...

Li Xizhi spent the entire night studying the slip until Yang Xiao'er eventually returned with a frown.

"Li Encheng... has indeed offended someone!" she said seriously.

"Who?" Li Xizhi asked, looking up quickly.

He noticed the strange expression on Yang Xiao'er's face as she whispered, "Chi Wei!"

"Chi Wei?!"

Li Xizhi was taken aback, disbelief flashing across his features as he continued asking, "How is that possible?!"

Yang Xiao'er carefully checked the doors and windows, then used a secret technique to transmit her voice.

"Chi Wei was still at the Foundation Establishment Realm when he went out with Li Encheng, and they discovered an alchemy legacy in a ruin. Li Encheng, tempted by profit, injured Chi Wei and locked him in a secret realm to seize this Dao for himself...

"He never expected that Chi Wei would gain significant benefits in the secret realm and later return to the sect. Li Encheng was apprehended for interrogation, relying solely on the backing of Fuchen Peak's Master, who defended him. Chi Wei, in a show of generosity, chose not to pursue the matter.

"The two reached an uneasy peace, and from that point on, Li Encheng never left the sect again. He spent his days refining pills on the peak, trying to atone for his past misdeeds..."

Li Xizhi shook his head upon hearing this and murmured, "I see, so that's why..."

Yang Xiao'er added, "Now that Chi Wei is dead, Li Encheng has become a cash cow for the sect. They've erased this part from the records and no longer mention it. It was the ancestor who informed me."

Li Xizhi nodded and reflected, "That certainly explains why Li Encheng rarely leaves his peak... It may not be that he's unwilling to go out, but that he dares not."

He retrieved a jade slip from the shelf and examined it closely before realization dawned upon him.

He whispered, "Ah, there's a brief record here. It was an alchemy legacy from the Mifan Sect... So that's the backstory of this legacy."

Yang Xiao'er nodded, reminding him, "This happened a very long time ago. Except for a few elders in the Purple Mansion Realm, most peak masters and disciples in the sect today are unaware of it, so we should be safe. My ancestor was just a lowly disciple back then. No one knows how much of what transpired in that secret realm according to the sect is true... We should just take it with a grain of salt."

Li Xizhi nodded thoughtfully, then picked up his brush to add a few more words to the letter before silently folding it. After sealing it with his family's secret technique, it was ready to be sent out.

The three treasured panaceas he received from Li Yuanjiao remained unused. Although his father had stated in the letter that if there was no hope of forming connections, he should keep them for his own use, Li Xizhi hesitated to pocket them all.

After considering his options, he carefully extracted one of the Cloud Vine Spirit Peppers, planning to have the Yundan Peak refine them into a batch of pills. As for the other two he set them aside, placing them in a small bag to be sent back home along with the letter.

Qingdu Peak.

Li Ximing sat by the furnace, a golden flame flickering across his face. With a light gesture, he drew the Profound Yang Li Fire to the tip of his finger.

The spirit fire was usually explosive and challenging to control, yet in his hands, it danced gracefully like an obedient spirit. Originally, it was a great spirit fire for combat, but unfortunately, they had only a portion at home and it had to be transformed into Long Marching Fire Essence.

As Li Ximing played with the fire, feeling its raw power and heat, a sense of regret washed over him.

He had received a talisman seed and having reached the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, Li Ximing was just one step away from the sixth heavenly layer.

After a four-month seclusion, he had easily broken through, breathing smoothly and effortlessly.

Talisman qi is indeed wonderful; it's a pity I can only take one dose. It would be wonderful if I could take several...

As soon as he emerged from seclusion after two months, Li Ximing felt restless. He called the servants from outside the courtyard and ordered, "Get Dou and the others here."

The servant, familiar with his intentions, was about to bow and take his leave when Li Ximing quickly stopped him, "Wait! Someone is coming."

The courtyard door creaked open, revealing a young man in a white robe. With sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, his true essence radiated a chill that was as cold as snow. He smiled and said, "What a coincidence! You've emerged from your seclusion, Ximing!"

Li Xijun, now also at the fifth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation, had received a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman alongside Li Ximing. After a series of breakthroughs, both were a level above Li Xizhi in the sect and firmly established themselves as mid-stage Qi Cultivators. Only Li Xicheng, who was at the foot of the mountain, remained at the second heavenly layer.

The two brothers sat down. Li Ximing still felt slightly awkward, but Li Xijun did not address it directly; instead, he shared everything that had happened during Li Ximing's seclusion, including details about two ore veins.

Li Ximing listened, genuinely pleased.

"That's great news!" he exclaimed.

Li Xijun continued, "Second Uncle has been in seclusion to recover from his injuries. I spent the last two months gathering qi and practicing the Slaughter Jun Kui Light. I visited two markets and bought all the spirit items and spirit herbs you need for the Yang Nourishing Technique."

He then produced an array of items from his storage pouch—A spirit stone with a phoenix tail pattern, a warm jade bottle, and a red spirit herb among them.

"This is the Phoenix Tail Stone, this is Dark Gray Smoke, and this is Yang Essence Spirit Herb..." he explained, handing them to Li Ximing one by one.

He noticed Li Xijun's travel-worn appearance and quickly thanked him, placing the items on the table. Feeling shy about expressing more, he only managed to convey his gratitude.

Li Xijun waved his hands, dismissing the formality.

Now that his cultivation had improved, Li Xijun had begun practicing Spirit Eye Perception. His eyes shimmered as if he could see right through people.

He spoke softly, "Granduncle has been looking very exhausted lately. He must be haunted by his inner demons, though he refuses to say a word about it. You should refine more pills that can help to relax him. I'll try to ask a few people to go to the southern prefecture to search for other similar medicines... It just so happens that I need to find a type of spirit water, so I can handle both tasks together while I'm at it."

Li Ximing heeded the instruction with a nod. Li Xuanxuan was his grandfather, and he should have been the one most concerned for him. Yet, he had been practicing in seclusion, wasting precious time.

Feeling a pang of shame, he replied, "I'll get to work right away and be more attentive to Grandfather's needs in the future so you don't have to worry about it."

Li Xijun smiled and nodded. Curious, Li Ximing asked, "Is the Slaughter Jun Kui Light really that difficult to practice? We already have cold water and cold qi at home, and also obtained one from the Yuan Family. With three cold qi from the Chilling Snow Series and a method for finding cold water... Do you really need to go out?"

"The only thing missing now is the cold water. My Radiant Snow Pine Ridge excels at using spells, and Slaughter Jun Kui Light is exceptionally powerful in my hands," Li Xijun replied with a smile.

He extended two fingers. Positioning his thumb at the base of his index finger, he began to chant the incantation. Suddenly, strands of white cold light scattered from his fingertip, glowing brightly in the air.

Li Ximing felt a chill wash over him, causing the hairs on the back of his neck to stand up. A layer of white frost quickly formed on the ground beneath him, and the flow of true essence within his body soon became sluggish.

Since there were spirit materials on the table, Li Xijun suppressed his power and only demonstrated a fraction of his power before waving his hand to dispel the spell.

"Slaughter Jun Kui Light is not just cold; it's also infused with Yin energy. Once I acquire the spirit water, I can elevate my abilities further. By then, even if my opponent's cultivation is significantly higher, they'll still suffer terribly if caught off guard during battles."

Li Ximing looked on enviously and remarked, "It's a pity that my skills are rooted in the Golden Yang lineage and I can't practice that... While the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual is excellent, it lacks compatible spells and escape techniques."

As they conversed, a delicate shout resonated from outside Mount Qingdu's formation.

"Kong Family of Profound Peak Gate has arrived as promised. Please open the mountain gate!"

The two brothers exchanged surprised glances and swiftly flew upward.

Outside the formation stood a graceful woman in plain clothes, adorned with a golden pearl at her waist and two curved blades hanging by her side. She was accompanied by an ordinary middle-aged man who remained silent.

What a beautiful woman!

Li Ximing had a calm demeanor. Although he still felt attracted to beautiful women, he was not so lustful as to lose his composure. Recognizing that she was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, he lowered his gaze and dared not look directly at her.

Li Xijun cupped his fist and asked, "Are you Senior Kong Tingyun?"

"Yes, and you are...?" Kong Tingyun glanced at him, secretly impressed, and explained politely, "I have once promised Brother Jiao to establish a fire vein for your esteemed family, and I've come as promised."

Splash...!

Suddenly, the dark green surface of Moongaze Lake broke open, and a young man in a black robe soared into the air. He silently stared at Kong Tingyun, his gaze lingering on the two curved blades hanging at her waist. His face darkened, and he stood there in silence.

Kong Tingyun cast a glance at him and felt a sense of familiarity. The next moment, she exclaimed in surprise, "You're that Hooked Serpent?!"

Li Wushao took a deep breath and replied humbly, "The Hooked Serpent is dead. I am Li Wushao of Qingdu... Greetings, Exalted Immortal."

Kong Tingyun's response was somewhat awkward. The long-buried doubts in her mind began to resolve by themselves.

So that's why Li Yuanjiao brought this Hooked Serpent back to the Li Family without any complaints... It seems he has a way to control demonic creatures. Given their family's proximity to the north, it's not entirely surprising.

Although it was awkward that the Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts at her waist were made from the Hooked Serpent's tail hooks, she had to be courteous toward the serpent who was now a member of the Li Family.

She silently stowed the dharma artifact in her storage pouch and replied, "Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak greets fellow Daoist."

Li Wushao's expression visibly improved as he quietly retreated to stand behind Li Xijun.

With Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong in seclusion, this responsibility naturally fell on Li Xijun.

He informed politely, "I'm afraid you will have to wait for a bit, Senior. My elders are currently cultivating in seclusion and unable to come out to greet you..."

Kong Tingyun waved her hand dismissively and did not seem to mind as she said, "I don't need to meet Li Yuanjiao. You can just show me the way to the mountain so I can open the fire vein for you. Once that's done, return the formation plate to me, and I'll take my leave. I don't have much time to waste here."

After a brief pause, Kong Tingyun asked with some concern, "Is Li Yuanjiao hesitant to see me because he has damaged the formation plate? That's a valuable item. If it's damaged, I expect a huge compensation from your family!"

"Don't worry, Senior. The formation plate is still in perfect condition," Li Xijun assured her.

The fire vein's location had been planned by the Li Family, specifically chosen at Mount Wutu.

Changes to the fire vein would affect the surrounding spirit fields. While the other peaks had large spirit fields, Mount Wutu was isolated in the mountains and forests, making it the only viable choice.

Kong Tingyun signaled, and the middle-aged man at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm flew toward Mount Wutu. Li Xijun and his brother followed suit, watching from the air.




# Chapter 482: Releasing Kongheng

Kong Tingyun stood in the air.

The townspeople at the foot of the mountain bustled about, looking up at her with little fear. She glanced around and asked, "Your territory may not be large, but your population is prosperous... I noticed that there are many Embryonic Breathing Realm and unrefined Qi Cultivators."

Li Xijun nodded and said a few words in response, but Kong Tingyun reminded him, "Having many people and cultivators isn't always good, you'll still need to control them."

Kong Tingyun's tactful reminder was made in good faith. Li Xijun nodded again, replying softly, "Thank you for your reminder, Senior. My family has been selecting spiritual orifices... It's rare for ordinary talents to enter my family."

While they were speaking, the middle-aged man from Profound Peak Gate had completed his survey and returned with the wind. His tone was calm as he reported, "Peak Master, this place has a good fire vein! A flat baleful fire can be obtained if drawn out from the earth. It can be used to craft tools and pills, but gathering qi will be slow."

The middle-aged man stepped back and Kong Tingyun remarked, "Pretty good... considering it is by a lake. If there are no issues, we can proceed to draw out this fire vein."

Li Xijun bowed and replied, "I'll leave it up to you, Senior."

Kong Tingyun tilted her head slightly, instructing her subordinate to proceed. The middle-aged man received the order and got busy right away. Meanwhile, Li Xicheng stepped forward and asked a few questions, then bowed to Kong Tingyun and joined the middle-aged man.

Li Xijun could not keep Kong Tingyun waiting around, so he politely led her to Mount Qingdu. As soon as Kong Tingyun took a seat, she remarked, "I heard that there's a female thunder cultivator in your family... I wonder if I might have the chance to meet her."

"Aunt Qinghong is currently cultivating in seclusion to break through to Foundation Establishment Realm, Senior," Li Xijun replied respectfully.

Kong Tingyun sighed softly before replying, "What a pity. In recent years, several thunder techniques have emerged in the world. The Proud Peak heard that the Yu Family also has a thunder cultivator."

She paused and smiled before continuing.

"I made a bet with the others from my gate that the Li Family's thunder cultivator would be the first to establish her foundation... It seems like I'll likely win."

Li Xijun listened intently, not daring to comment further after her statement.

Kong Tingyun continued, "The destiny of Buzi from the Azure Pond must have arrived. He has been wandering around in the Eastern Sea for the past few years and rarely returns to the sect. The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven is now being overseen by the Golden Feather Sect. The Azure Pond Grotto Heaven probably couldn't bear it any longer and declared that they would send a late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator named Daoist Master Suiguan to guard the sect."

Li Xijun was secretly surprised by this news despite maintaining a calm exterior. He nodded and asked, "Late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator huh...? The upper sect is truly powerful."

"Of course," Kong Tingyun replied, curling her lips as continued softly, "Every ten years, two or three cultivators successfully establish their foundations among the thirty-six peaks of Azure Pond. In the past five hundred years, four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators that are not surnamed Chi have emerged. Although Azure Pond Grotto Heaven is about the size of a prefecture, it is filled with opportunities... Can you imagine how many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are in there?"

"I'm sure it's an impressive number," Li Xijun praised, lowering his head then saying nothing more. Meanwhile, Kong Tingyun leaned back and played with her golden pearl.

After a moment, Mount Wutu shook powerfully.

"The fire vein has begun to move. My senior brother will stay here to manage the earth vein for a year and a half and watch over it for three years. Since Li Yuanjiao won't emerge from his seclusion for a while, I'll take my leave now," she remarked simply.

She then stretched out her delicate hand and asked, "Can you return my Emerald Jade Plate to me now?"

It was only at this moment that Li Xijun finally knew the formation plate's name. He took it out and handed it to Kong Tingyun, albeit reluctantly.

"Senior, can I rent this formation plate?" he asked respectfully.

Kong Tingyun saw the hope in his eyes and smiled gently.

"Tough. The sect has ordered me to go to the Eastern Sea, and I'll be moving around... Besides, when I get to the island, I also need this formation plate to protect myself and fight the enemy, so I can't lend it out," she said with a slight shrug.

As she put away the formation plate, Li Xijun apologized for making the troubling request before escorting her out of the Li Family's territory.

When he returned, riding on the chilly wind, a large clearing had been created on Mount Wutu. Many light red lines were engraved on the smooth ground, and a large hole in the middle of it was spewing out thick smoke.

Li Ximing was holding a jade gourd by his side. As soon as black smoke rose from the hole, it was immediately sucked and absorbed into it. The middle-aged man stood beside the pit, performing hand seals to control the formation.

The man from Profound Peak Gate looked like he was so done with life as he stared at the fire in his hand, not caring about anything else. When Li Xijun landed, his expression changed slightly as he said hoarsely, "Kong Gusun from Profound Peak greets fellow Daoist."

"Li Xijun of Qingdu," Li Xijun answered in a friendly manner, and Kong Gusun nodded as he continued working with the fire vein.

Li Ximing, who was standing by, also had the ability to control fire. He was tempted to try but did not want to expose his talent, so he held back. Li Xijun watched for a while but could not understand what the middle-aged man was doing.

It was at this moment Li Xicheng arrived on the wind. He stood a head taller than his younger brother and had nice facial features, though he always wore a serious expression.

"Jun'er, that monk is leaving!" he informed in a small voice.

He was over a dozen years older than his younger brothers, and could practically be old enough to be their father. Li Yuanyun did not care about the family, and he had been the one to raise Li Xijun, so he called him by his nickname.

Since Li Qinghong heeded the monk's advice to cultivate at the Heavenly Thunder Peak, Li Xijun had sent people to keep a close watch on the monk. Upon hearing the news, he asked hurriedly, "Did you stop him?"

"We did, but the monk refused to obey," Li Xicheng replied helplessly.

Li Xijun immediately dragged his brother along and flew out to the lake together. As expected, he saw a ball of golden light on it, surrounded by several cultivators from the Li Family.

Xu Gongming was fighting within and wielded a pair of short halberds. Half of his face was masked to cover the injuries he had sustained during the devil plague. In recent years, he had made great progress and reached the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Behind him were two talents—An Siming and An Siwei—one holding a spear and the other holding a sword. They were both Qi Cultivators, protecting Xu Gongming's left and right flanks.

An Zheyan did not accomplish much, but he had talented sons. Although these two brothers were not as gifted as An Jingming, they were also around twenty-five and twenty-six years old, very sensible, and always humble.

Surrounded by the crowd, Kongheng squinted his narrow eyes, holding the monk staff in his fair hands and speaking softly. Li Xijun had good eyesight and managed to read his lips.

"Why are you stopping me?" he asked.

Li Xijun sighed and thought to himself, He has appeared a bit early and has not been around for a few years.... It's hard for him to explain himself.

He pulled the hem of his older brother's clothes and whispered, "Big Brother, please get all of them to leave and bring Kongheng to Mount Qingdu."

Li Xicheng was stunned for a moment, then realized that Li Xijun beside him had already reached the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He felt both happy and surprised, and followed his orders while Li Xijun then flew back to the mountain.

He found a small forest on Mount Qingdu, set out a stone table and a few chairs, and then quietly brewed tea.

The Li Family had come to understand Kongheng's personality over the years, so Li Xijun was not worried that he would not show up. After waiting for a while, sure enough, Kongheng arrived at the mountain as expected.

The monk was slightly stunned at first, looking at him in disbelief. After saying two long honorific titles, he added, "Your cultivation progress is improving rapidly, my friend."

"I am just lucky," Li Xijun replied. He and Kongheng had only met a few times many years ago. Kongheng quickly changed the subject and requested politely, "I have to go out for a while; please let me go, fellow Daoist."

Li Xijun had already grasped his character. Staring straight into his eyes, he said solemnly, "Master Monk cultivates the true art of Buddhism... I only ask Master Monk one question—are you going to Heavenly Thunder Peak?"

Kongheng was stunned for two breaths before finally nodding with a bitter smile. Li Xijun continued calmly, "My elder is breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm there, as suggested by Master Monk... If you can't state your reason for going there now, I'm afraid I can't let you go."

Kongheng sighed softly and had no choice but to say, "I practice an ancient technique and the opportunity for a breakthrough is there. Since you trust me, I hope you can help me and let me go, fellow Daoist. I will only build a hut at the foot of Heavenly Thunder Peak to cultivate."

Li Xijun looked into Kongheng's sincere eyes and gritted his teeth in frustration. He was in a true dilemma.

"It's not that I don't want to help Master Monk, but it's difficult to tell if you speak the truth or lie. Xijun can't afford to gamble."

After saying that, he pressed his hand on his sword and asked again, "Must you go, Master Monk?"

Kongheng stared at him with his narrow eyes and nodded.

"Yes."

As soon as he finished speaking, the Green Ox River Embrace Formation on Mount Qingdu suddenly activated, and nine green lights rose up and intertwined with each other instantly. Li Xijun then drew his sword and pointed it directly at Kongheng.

"Master Monk, I suggest you perish the thought!" he declared softly.

Kongheng's body also radiated golden light, and the rings on his staff jingled as he blocked Li Xijun's sword light with a solemn face.

"If I dare speak a word of deceit, my cultivation shall be destroyed!" he swore.

Li Xijun swung his sword, unleashing several white sword qi. However, every single one was blocked by Kongheng's monk staff with great ease. A huge patterned green ox appeared behind Kongheng. It raised its two front hooves and was about to stomp on his back.

Within the formation, Kongheng could not even leave by riding the wind; he could only pull out his staff and turn to block the attacks. The impact from the ox's kick pushed him back several steps, causing him to lose momentum and forcing him into a passive stance.

Li Xijun had completed performing his hand seal. A cold light emitted from his hand as several white threads flowed out of it, wrapping around Kongheng.

"Does Master Monk have other intentions? My family does not want to provoke anyone from the Buddhist Sect either... If you can tell me, I will spare your life and even let you go north!"

As Li Xijun said this, a bright white light shone in his eyes. He looked carefully at Kongheng's face to detect changes in his expression, only to see his face paling from the cold.

Seeing that the green bull was about to hit him, the monk gritted his teeth and still insisted firmly, "Kongheng is sincere and never lies!"

BAM!

As soon as he finished speaking, the spell, green ox, and sword qi in front of him all dissipated in the blink of an eye. Kongheng staggered, and Li Xijun quickly helped him up, whispering, "Xijun dares not believe your word easily, I hope Master Monk can understand... My family has suffered greatly due to the Wrathful Maha and we truly can't weather through another storm like that..."

Kongheng could not react for a moment and just stared at him blankly. Li Xijun then added, "Please wait outside the formation, Master Monk... I'll get Senior Wushao to escort you!"

Kongheng was overjoyed, his expression faltering due to the sudden change of events.

"Thank you for your help, fellow Daoist! Thank you!" he said repeatedly.

Regaining a lost opportunity and hope for a breakthrough after a near-death situation shattered the tranquility of the monk's heart. He could not restrain himself and said seriously, "If your esteemed family has any requests in the future, Kongheng will make sure to assist personally! If Brother Xijun has a request, Kongheng will not refuse even if he has to risk his life!"

Kongheng was very sincere, knowing he truly owed Li Xijun a favor this time. After reassuring Li Xijun again, he happily rode the wind out.

When he disappeared into the distance, a young man in black slowly emerged from the shadows. Li Xijun said softly, "Senior, please go and keep an eye on him. The Yuan Family is also watching him. If there is any unusual activity, let them know first."

"Understood."

Li Wushao looked at him with lingering fear in his eyes but still also rode out on the wind, leaving Li Xijun alone. His face changed several times as he glumly threw the sword in his hand onto a branch.

The sword lodged in the pine wood, still shaking and buzzing from the impact. Li Xijun rubbed his temples and murmured, "If anything happens... I will never be able to redeem myself!"

Li Xijun had always been very accurate in judging people. Among the Li Family, he was the one who trusted Kongheng the most and held the best impression of him. He had gone to great lengths to test Kongheng only for the sake of reassuring himself.

The monk was very sincere, and his eyes were full of gratitude before he left. In order to do him a favor, Li Xijun let him go easily.

"If Kongheng really keeps his word, I can trust him a little more in the future..." he murmured to himself.

Despite saying that, Li Xijun felt all the pressure on him now that Kongheng was gone. Although he was confident, sweat broke out on his cheeks because the stakes were far too high.

He called over a person and asked tiredly, "Has the ancestor emerged from his seclusion yet?"

Li Yuanjiao had secluded himself this time to heal himself instead of cultivating as usual. If this was not the case, Li Xijun would have called him out when Kong Tingyun arrived, instead of not daring to disturb him and feeling as uneasy as he did now.

Seeing his confidant shake his head, Li Xijun let out a long sigh and said to himself, "I-If... anything happens to Aunt Qinghong, I'll never be able to atone for this sin even if I kill myself..."

He did not dare to think about it and sat on the stone bench in the forest in a daze. After several breaths, he saw Li Ximing fly toward him in a hurry and exclaimed urgently, "What's going on? Why did you open the formation?"

Li Xijun opened his mouth but could not find his voice. Li Ximing was even more indecisive than he was. If he told him about this, it would only cause one more person to worry and make things worse.

He only sighed and assured, "Everything is under control... Just focus on your cultivation and leave the rest to me."

————

It was snowing in Yi Mountain City for once. Everything was covered in snow and Li Xuanfeng stood quietly on the city wall, dressed in golden armor with a longbow in hand.

He had finally mastered Spirit Eye Perception after practicing it for decades. The mana light in his eyes flowed strongly as he swept through the snow. By just standing quietly on the city wall, his presence alone could intimidate the demon creatures outside, causing them to retreat in fear.

Li Xuanfeng might not be that well-known in Yue State, but he was renowned in the southern border. Every time the bowstring of his golden bow sounded, the arrow he let loose would either kill or seriously injure his opponent. The number of demon generals he had already killed had reached double digits.

Li Xuanfeng looked on absent-mindedly, unmoving. The years had not left many traces on his face, but they had ravaged his mind and thoughts. He could no longer display the wild attitude he once had.

After a moment, a clear light came from the north and fell beside him—it was a woman wearing a black-patterned flowing dress. Her slender waist was tied with a white sash made of gauze.

She had a somewhat melancholic look in her eyes as she whispered to him softly.

"My dear..."




# Chapter 484: The Madam

Snow fell heavily. The sound of the words my dear rang sweetly in the air, catching Li Xuanfeng's attention as his gaze lingered on the soft, graceful figure before him. He responded politely, "Hemian, is the Daoist Master looking for me?"
𝗳𝚛𝚎𝚎𝘄𝕖𝕓𝕟𝕠𝚟𝚎𝕝.𝗰𝕠𝐦

Ning Hemian gave a brief nod then shook her head, saying, "Someone from the grotto heaven has arrived. The Daoist Master has already returned to Azure Pond Peak to pay his respects."

Ning Hemian had been married to him for five or six years now. Initially, Li Xuanfeng had reluctantly agreed to the marriage, but in the blink of an eye, those years had passed. They had always treated each other with mutual respect. Ning Hemian's mind was mostly on her cultivation, so their relationship was pretty harmonious.

Li Xuanfeng slung his bow over his shoulder and walked alongside her. Ning Hemian was always courteous toward him. After all, they had shared the same bed for several years. To say there were no feelings at all would be untrue, yet there was always something unresolved between them.

Li Xuanfeng harbored deep resentment toward the Azure Pond Sect. The deaths of many of his close relatives were tied to the sect. His wife and child had also perished in a deal between the Azure Pond Sect and Golden Tang Gate.

Originally, after seeing Chi Wei's death, Li Xuanfeng had thought that the Azure Pond Sect was in trouble, with an outsider Purple Mansion Realm cultivator proving too powerful for them to handle. He had secretly encouraged himself, sensing an opportunity, as Yuan Su seemed disdainful of the Chi Family and eager to act. His mind was filled with calculations.

However, a few months ago, Yuan Su had summoned him. He was informed that the Daoist Master would be leaving Yi Mountain City to pay respects to another Daoist Master named Suiguan, sent by the Azure Pond Grotto Heaven.

Another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Azure Pond Grotto Heaven... What is this?

The news that the grotto heaven had sent someone to the sect—a late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, no less—left him feeling dejected. This meant that there were likely more of them in the grotto heaven. For ten consecutive days, he vented his frustrations on demons atop the city walls, pacing through the snow in silence.

His mind raced with countless thoughts as snow continued to fall from the sky. Beside him, Ning Hemian followed quietly. After a moment's pause, Li Xuanfeng decided to ask, "Hemian, do you know the origin of this grotto heaven?"

Ning Hemian nodded and, with polite formality, replied, "My family knows a bit about it. I can tell you about it but you mustn't spread it out, my dear."

Seeing Li Xuanfeng nod in agreement, Ning Hemian softly went on to explain, "My father once accompanied the Daoist Master inside. Outsiders call it Azure Pond Grotto Heaven, but that is not quite accurate... Its true name is Pristine Cadence Heaven. Very few people have entered, and there are hardly any people inside."

She hesitated slightly, as if pondering something, then continued, "The True Monarch who created the grotto heaven had strange intentions back then. There is no sky, no land, no sun, and no moon inside—only endless turquoise waters. To be honest... it is not truly the property of the Azure Pond Sect."

"Oh?" Li Xuanfeng was taken aback by this and asked, "Then whose treasure is it?"

Ning Hemian smiled reluctantly and lowered her voice, "Whose..? Perhaps some True Monarch's. In this world, Golden Core Realm cultivators are already immortal. Maybe he is hidden somewhere within the grotto heaven, or perhaps he has left to seclude himself in the heavens beyond. In any case, the Azure Pond Sect cannot fully control Pristine Cadence Heaven..."

Ning Hemian continued, "Moreover, it is impossible to stay long inside Pristine Cadence Heaven. It is not just mortals—even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who stay for a few days will dissolve into blood. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who stay for a year or two will lose their minds, their divine abilities will be exhausted, and they will turn into mortals."

Ning Hemian's expression grew more worried, her voice softening further as she continued, "Occasionally, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the sect makes a trip there on order. My father once entered due to his unique cultivation method... but there was no one inside. Yet, someone suddenly stepped out of such a grotto heaven, wearing fresh clothes, claiming to be Daoist Master Suiguan, bearing the surname Chi."

Li Xuanfeng pondered this deeply, feeling a chill down his spine. Ning Hemian whispered, "My cousin also saw this Daoist Master Suiguan. He could not tell which lineage or family he belonged to, nor did he mention any ancestral ties. He said his surname was Chi, and Chi Zhiyun would not dare question him."

Li Xuanfeng stared at her, dumbfounded, "Are you saying..."

Her smile seemed hollow as she spoke, "Every move the Azure Pond Sect makes comes from orders within the grotto heaven. I used to think they could not come out, but now it seems they simply did not want to."

Ning Hemian's voice dropped as she added somberly, "Perhaps the grotto heaven is not the property of the Azure Pond Sect. Maybe... the Azure Pond Sect is the property of the grotto heaven."

Li Xuanfeng opened his mouth, but before he could respond, Ning Hemian pulled him into the house. She shut the door tightly, and the barrier formation activated automatically. As she helped him out of his robe, she whispered softly, "I am telling you all this in secret because, truthfully, I have my own selfish reasons..."

Ning Hemian paused briefly and continued, "My dear, I have come to sense certain things after sharing a bed with you for so long... The Azure Pond Sect is a colossal force that brings despair, clinging to the void itself... Please, let go of your hatred..."

Li Xuanfeng sat down on the couch as Ning Hemian nestled into his arms, undoing her clothes as her eyes brimmed with tears.

"I know you hate it... My Ning Family did not have it easy in earlier years either. If it were not for a Daoist Master's achievements, I don't know how miserable things would have been for us now."

"Does the Yang Family not hate the Azure Pond Sect? What about the Deng Family? Or the Yu Family? Azure Pond once had only sixteen peaks... Now, it has thirty-six. The younger generation of these families take great pride in identifying with Azure Pond."

Ning Hemian observed his expression, trying to guess his thoughts, and continued, "The Deng Family endured such hardship, yet only a few direct descendants hold resentment. Does Chi Zhiyun not know this? He simply does not care... Among the Deng Family, who does not identify themselves with Azure Pond? Who truly represents the Deng Family?"

Li Xuanfeng clenched his teeth as he held her, watching as her delicate face flushed with a shade of pink. Ning Hemian's eyes were filled with affection as she looked at him, speaking softly, "Do you think that Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er's children will hate Azure Pond for some long-past grievance involving Li Chejing from generations ago? I may not know how you managed to deceive your family's ancestor, but I doubt everyone in the Li Family possesses such abilities..."

Ning Hemian continued, "Today, the Yang and Yu families could be the target, and tomorrow the Li Family. Otherwise, it could be the Qi or Deng families. This scheme of Azure Pond can break down family bonds, turn enemies into allies, or assimilate them into the sect..."

Li Xuanfeng's palm was so hot that it left a red mark on her pale arm. Ning Hemian gazed at him lovingly, but the man's sharp eyes burned with intensity as he stared at her.

"Those within the sect are not necessarily friends, and those outside it are not necessarily enemies," he said.

Ning Hemian chuckled softly, resting her head against his chest as she whispered, "My Ning Family is a friend of your esteemed clan. As for who the enemy is... you and I both know that well."

Li Xuanfeng let her nestle in his arms for a long time, his passion already stirred. Finally, he lifted her with a growl, grumbling, "Stop talking about 'my Ning Family'... You are already married to me—now we are one. No more talk of two separate families!"

"Mm!" Ning Hemian responded gently. For the first time, the distance between their hearts vanished. She lifted her head and smiled affectionately.

Qingdu Peak was once covered in white irises, but now, in the depths of winter, heavy snow had fallen, blanketing the entire peak in white. As the snow ceased, the sun shone brightly in the clear sky.

Xiao Guiluan was in her quiet chamber cultivating, her elegant phoenix eyes giving her a charming look. She wore a simple black dress.

Xiao Guiluan had reached the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. She possessed considerable talent and had advanced steadily over the years. Though she could not keep up with her husband, Li Yuanjiao, she had made remarkable progress.

Xiao Guiluan did not particularly like the color black, but since Li Yuanjiao favored dark, black-patterned robes, she followed his preference and dressed accordingly.

In the Li Family, Xiao Guiluan had always maintained a low profile. If Li Yuanjiao had been the clan head, her influence and status would undoubtedly be much greater. However, understanding that her husband disliked ostentation, she quietly focused on her cultivation atop the mountain.
𝘧𝘳𝘦ℯ𝓌𝘦𝒷𝘯𝑜𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸𝘰𝓂

As she exhaled a breath of pure qi, Li Yuexiang entered from the courtyard. Glancing at her mother, she asked, "Mother, where is Father?"

For as long as Li Yuexiang could remember, she had very few opportunities to spend time with her father. Although this wasn't ideal, Xiao Guiluan understood his reasons and raised Li Yuexiang on her own.

They were chatting and laughing together when the cave dwelling's doors suddenly creaked open. Li Yuanjiao strode out, looking relaxed, his cultivation seemingly having advanced.

"My dear!"

Xiao Guiluan joyfully approached him.

Li Yuanjiao embraced her, equally pleased after their time apart, though his first words were still the same.

"How are things at home?"

Xiao Guiluan replied, "Kong Tingyun has arrived as promised. She opened the fire vein on Wutu and left someone from Profound Peak Gate to guard it... The formation plate has been taken as well."

Although Li Yuanjiao had anticipated this, he still felt a pang of regret. After carefully inquiring about the details, he sighed and said, "What a pity! If I had not been injured by that Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Mount Yue, capturing a demon from the Eastern Sea would have been no problem! The timing would have been perfect."

All of this had been within Li Yuanjiao's expectations. He then asked, "Anything else?"

In the two years of his seclusion, several significant matters had arisen. Xiao Guiluan lowered her voice and said, "Madam Lu failed to break through the Qi Cultivation Realm years ago and lost much of her lifespan... She is nearly seventy years old now... There is no chance for her to advance any further. Just a few days ago, word arrived—she has passed away."

With an air of melancholy, Xiao Guiluan continued, "She died on her bed, holding a meal box and two jade chopsticks. She had been cultivating in seclusion in the forest, with only two elderly servants by her side."

"Madam Lu...?"

Li Yuanjiao paused, momentarily stunned, before recalling that Madam Lu's full name was Lu Wanrong, the widow of Li Xuanling. She had lived alone in the mountains for many years.

Li Xuanling had been killed by the Maha, and Lu Wanrong, devastated by grief, had nearly taken her own life. She had remained stuck at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm for ten years.

With the potential to break through to Qi Cultivation Realm, those ten years of stagnation had effectively cut off her cultivation path. Later, her youngest son, Li Yuanyun, died in the market, pushing her to the brink of despair.

Although her daughter, Li Qinghong, had shown some promise, Lu Wanrong had lost all hope, retreating to the mountains to await her end.

Upon hearing this news, Li Yuanjiao could only sigh sadly.

"Qinghong will probably need another year to break through. I fear... she will not make it in time. Let Xijun and Xicheng see her off."

Xiao Guiluan nodded and, after carefully considering her words, added softly, "Your mother... likely does not have many days left either."

The mother she referred to was not Madam Dou, but instead Li Yuanjiao's birth mother, Mu Yalu, a concubine of Li Xuanxuan. She had married into the family from Mount Yue many years ago and was now approaching seventy.

"What?!"

The words struck Li Yuanjiao like a bolt from the blue, his face turning pale as he struggled to contain himself. Without a second thought, he soared into the air, riding the wind swiftly toward the town.

Xiao Guiluan followed closely behind, offering a few words of comfort, but Li Yuanjiao could not register them. He quickly descended into the courtyard of the large estate. An elderly servant, holding a basin, surprisingly still recognized him and called out, "Young Master!"

Li Yuanjiao waved at her and hurried inside. An old woman was lying on the bed.

When Mu Yalu had married into the Li Family, she was in her prime, but now she had grown frail and aged. Although she was a mortal, her high status and careful maintenance had allowed her to live more than ten years beyond the average lifespan.

She had been lying listlessly on the bed, but upon seeing Li Yuanjiao enter, her spirit visibly lifted. She struggled to sit up, speaking urgently, "Jiao'er... I heard you were injured by a Mount Yue cultivator... Are you alright?!"

Despite Li Yuanjiao's ruthless and gloomy nature when dealing with the outside world, he could no longer hold back upon hearing her words. He collapsed to his knees in front of her, choking back tears, "Mother! I'm fine!"

Mu Yalu smiled as she gazed at him, studying his expression and demeanor.

To others, Li Yuanjiao was always associated with suspicion and ruthlessness, and even his appearance had earned him a reputation as someone untrustworthy. But in Mu Yalu's eyes, he was exceptional. She grasped his hand, laughing constantly.

Xiao Guiluan ushered the servants out and closed the door. It was only then that Li Yuanjiao noticed another person sitting on a chair nearby—so emaciated that he looked like a piece of dead log draped in gray clothing, silently leaning against the side.

"Father."

Li Xuanxuan opened his eyes and nodded, his gaze lingering on Li Yuanjiao. Over the years, he had struggled with hallucinations, and he was squinting as he stared at Li Yuanjiao, as if trying to recall something.

The atmosphere between the three of them was unbearably heavy. Li Yuanjiao, not one for warm words, simply kneeled there in silence, watching as Mu Yalu's breath grew more labored.

Mu Yalu smiled at him the whole time, seemingly having no more to say, or perhaps having said it all. Eventually, her lips grew cold, her limbs icy, and her arms turned dark and bruised.

Li Xuanxuan silently smoked a pipe, the thin white smoke wafting through the air as the three sat in silence. They watched on quietly as Mu Yalu's breathing became shallower, her life force gradually slipping away.

"Hack!"

Li Xuanxuan coughed and stood, as if preparing to say something, but Li Yuanjiao only held his mother's lifeless body and walked out of the room, leaving him alone inside, surrounded by the haze of smoke.

The midday sun was at its peak, its harsh light filtering through the windows and illuminating his haggard face. Li Xuanxuan's expression was blank, but his trembling hands betrayed the deep turmoil within him.

After coughing twice more, he approached Xiao Guiluan, pulling three stacks of talismans from his storage pouch. The patterns were complex and colorful, representing a wide variety of talisman types. He then said loudly, "Guiluan! These are the talismans I drew this year!"

Xiao Guiluan, still stunned, took the talismans. Li Xuanxuan, muttering to himself, rode the wind and flew off, heading toward Mount Lijing to fetch more blank talisman paper.

For a moment, Xiao Guiluan stood there alone, not sure whether to hold onto the talismans or put them away. Her heart ached with grief and agitation. After placing them on the desk, she hurried off to follow Li Yuanjiao.

————

Xiao Guiluan soared through the sky, searching for her husband, and finally found him.

Li Yuanjiao stood before Li Tongya's grave, his expression already calm and devoid of sorrow. He rested his hand on his sword, gazing silently ahead.

The grave behind him was his older brother's, Li Yuanxiu. The headstone was covered in ash, and its edges had been worn smooth over time by years of touch. Many of the graves in the Li Family cemetery were cenotaphs, and this one was no different.

Li Yuanjiao exhaled slowly, glancing briefly at Xiao Guiluan before asking, "Is there anything else at home?"

Xiao Guiluan nodded, unsure of his current state, and after a hesitant pause, she said softly, "Kongheng... the monk, has left."

"Did he now?"

Li Yuanjiao showed no surprise, simply replying, "Did he return to the north or head for Heavenly Thunder Peak? And what of Li Xijun?"

Xiao Guiluan quietly replied, "He went to Heavenly Thunder Peak."

"Heavenly Thunder Peak huh...?"

Li Yuanjiao's expression darkened slightly. He spoke in a low voice, "Let us go. We will return to Qingdu Peak and ask Xijun about it."




# Chapter 486: Breakthrough

Li Yuanjiao waited for only a short while before Li Xijun arrived on the wind. He had been consolidating his cultivation during this period. Since he often had to go out, he was not in a hurry to break through and remained at the fifth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation, mostly practicing swordsmanship and spells.

"Second Uncle... my condolences."

Upon seeing Li Yuanjiao, Li Xijun bowed and offered a few words of comfort.

Li Yuanjiao nodded and asked in a serious tone, "You let Kongheng go, huh?"

Li Xijun took a deep breath and replied respectfully, "I have faith in my decision. Kongheng is practicing ancient Buddhist techniques... and isn't that strong. Although he is a Master Monk, his strength is only at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm... Furthermore, he is an open-hearted person..."

Li Yuanjiao could no longer listen and his face contorted with slight anger. Without drawing the Qingche Sword, he struck Li Xijun on the back with it, causing him to stagger from the impact.

"How can you wager on something like this?!" he shouted.

Li Xijun bowed again and said, "Please have faith in me, Second Uncle. Kongheng is a good person. Xijun is certain about this! He has been caring for the people and curing diseases for many years at the foot of the mountain, waiting for this opportunity..."

Li Yuanjiao frowned and replied coldly, "What does Kongheng's opportunity have to do with me? Whether he lives or dies has nothing to do with my family! Why should my family take the risk?"

"I don't care how long he has waited for this opportunity... Buddhist cultivators are people who devour lives! You may have a good personal relationship with him and are willing to help him, but not me!"

Li Xijun raised his head meekly and replied, "If Kongheng can break through, even if he is a Master Monk, he will still be very powerful compared to Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... Since he has received great favor from us... he will become a powerful ally to us!"

He quickly continued, "I understand the resentment Second Uncle feels toward them, but there are many Buddhist cultivators now in our region. You can easily find six of them among ten people. My family has made enemies with the Wrathful Dao lineage and can no longer go north. Must we offend another orthodox sect like the Liao River Temple...?"

"That's your aunt breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm!" Li Yuanjiao reminded him angrily.

Li Xijun kneeled and assured softly, "Uncle! Aunt will definitely be fine and succeed in establishing her foundation! No matter who wants to use, consume, or manipulate fate..."

He raised his head and continued, "They'll only do it to those who have already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm! If Kongheng were possessed by a Maha, he couldn't possibly evade the eyes of the Yuan Family and Senior Wushao! If he were a Maha, he would wait for Aunt to break through before eating her life. He would have already discussed this with all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators; our family wouldn't be able to escape this tragedy!"

"Besides, if he intended to harm her, what difference would there be between Moongaze Lake and Heavenly Thunder Peak?" he challenged.

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes at him and asked coldly, "How do you know for sure?"

In that moment, he seized Li Xijun, sealed his cultivation, and then forcefully flew him to the ancestral hall. He pushed open the wooden door with a creak, threw Li Xijun into the hall, and commanded in a deep voice, "Kneel here while I bring Kongheng back!"

Li Xijun lowered his head and nodded. Li Yuanjiao turned to leave, riding the wind down the mountain. Realizing his intention, Li Ximing chased after Li Yuanjiao hurriedly, wanting to dissuade him, only to be stopped by Xiao Guiluan.

"Madam! Nothing even happened on Heavenly Thunder Peak... There is no need for him to be that angry!"

Li Ximing tried to reason with her, but Xiao Guiluan shook her head helplessly and urged softly, "Just go back... Those two are just putting on a show for Kongheng. You shouldn't get involved."

"Ah!"

Li Ximing was taken aback for a moment and realization dawned upon him. Though less disciplined, he was no fool; he understood the situation and decided to return.

After persuading Li Ximing to return, Xiao Guiluan landed on her peak and picked up Li Yuexiang with a sigh, who had come to greet her.

My husband still resents Buddhist cultivators...

————

The central hall of Lijing Town.

An old man kneeled at the bottom of the steps. His hair and beard were entirely white, and he was at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He looked very solemn as he bowed respectfully and spoke in a deep voice.

"Thank you for all the kindness you have shown my daughter and me over the years, Family Head. The Meng Family is grateful. Now that I am old, I fear I can no longer refine dharma artifacts for your esteemed family. Hence, I would like to offer my legacy!"

"Offer your legacy?"

Li Yuanping frowned as he looked at the old man before him.

"Elder Meng, you must be joking. My family does not covet your legacy," he explained.

Meng Taizhi lowered his head and replied, "I believe I have only a few years left. I plan to enter seclusion and attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. This is a desperate move—a gamble before death. I only hope to find a way forward for my daughter... I am willing to exchange my legacy for your protection."

Li Yuanping was still perplexed by the man's actions and shook his head slightly.

However, Meng Taizhi continued, "My legacy comes from the Eastern Sea's Jiaozhu Gate, and it's definitely not an ordinary thing. Please listen to me first, Family Head..."

The old man kneeled on the ground and explained respectfully, "The legacy I received is from Jiaozhu Gate, which has been destroyed for a thousand years. All grudges are long gone, leaving no cause for concern. You can use it with confidence."

"Furthermore, this method involves nine refinements and six castings, which makes it an extraordinary casting technique. As long as you have the talent in this dao and practice diligently, you will surely achieve significant achievements and be able to craft Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts, or maybe even Foundation Establishment Realm artifacts," he added.

"Oh?"

Li Yuanping looked at him quietly and asked, "What do you want in exchange, old man? Are you hoping to marry your daughter off?"

Meng Taizhi bowed again and humbly replied, "I wouldn't dare... My daughter was married to a hero in the Eastern Sea. Unfortunately, he was later killed and she was injured by mana light. Our lineage is pretty much severed..."

Li Yuanping nodded, his expression softening slightly. Meng Taizhi then continued, "I only ask for two things. First, I hope my daughter can learn alchemy from your family, so she can make a living and defend herself."

"Second, I hope your esteemed family can offer this sole daughter of mine some protection after my death. Once she becomes stronger, she will stop troubling your family and seek her own way in life."

Li Yuanping looked at him and asked, "Since you come from the Eastern Sea, did you encounter some kind of trouble...?"

Meng Taizhi shook his head and replied frankly, "My family members are merely rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea. We were later destroyed by devil cultivators. My ancestors had some connections with the Xiao Family and went to them to seek refuge... but only my daughter and I were left along the way. Even my son-in-law died during the journey..."

"I see," Li Yuanping replied indifferently as he continued, "But I investigated and found no trace of blacksmiths surnamed Meng in the Eastern Sea or any leaving that area recently."

Meng Taizhi smiled bitterly, shaking his head.

"My family was originally guest cultivators of a minor sect on Yuanting Island. After we were destroyed by the devil cultivators, we found ourselves wandering outside. You can verify this, Family Head; the Xiao Family knows the truth," he explained patiently and humbly.

Li Yuanping nodded and asked again, "Why not pass this legacy to the Xiao Family? Wouldn't it be better to have a Purple Mansion immortal clan protect it? My family is just a normal clan, we can't compare to them."

Meng Taizhi shook his head helplessly and replied with a wry smile, "Of course, I have approached them, which is why I had the opportunity to come to the lake. But what can a minor connection from hundreds of years ago do? I can't even step into the threshold of the immortal clan."

Li Yuanping stared at him and nodded.

"Since you have entrusted the legacy to me, you may send your daughter up the mountain, old man. I will contact the Xiao Family."

"Thank you! Thank you, Family Head!"

Meng Taizhi felt relief wash over him as he smiled in gratitude, then hurriedly retreated. Li Yuanping then called over Li Xicheng and said, "Have Ximing write a letter to Senior Yuansi to inquire if this is true. If it is, take this legacy."

Li Xicheng hesitated for a moment, looking concerned.

"But Brother Ming... is easily swayed by beauty... If he develops feelings for this woman from the Meng Family... It could lead to trouble, especially if these people from the Meng Family had kept their troubled past a secret from us."

"Let's not worry about this first and confirm with Senior Yuansi. As long as this person's explanation is correct, then all is well. Meng Zhuoyun is naturally not a problem, and she will leave in a few years," Li Yuanping replied.

Li Xicheng hesitated and said, "I'm only worried that when the time comes, Brother Ming will be reluctant to let her go and will want to keep her..."

Li Yuanping sneered and replied, "What kind of feelings can this bastard have? He is extremely heartless. He had fooled around with several girls in the Xiao Family and might have even left a few children behind... Do you think he ever cared? He has many concubines, but have you ever seen him say a word to any of them?"

He shook his head and concluded, "The most important thing in that kid's heart is his own dao. Women are merely a pastime. Everything else must take a backseat to his ambitions... After raising him for so many years, I know him well."

Li Yuanping coughed twice and bent down in pain. Li Xicheng hurried to support him, channeling some true essence into him. After a moment of rest, Li Yuanping slowly recovered.

He then said calmly, "Let him do what he wants. That girl from the Meng Family can't have an heir anyway. Whether they are close or involved in an affair, let him do as he wishes. When the time is right, let that girl leave."

Li Yuanping looked calm as he spoke with a fatherly certainty.

"He is more heartless than anyone else and will not hesitate to cut ties."

————

Li Yuanjiao had always been cautious while riding the wind. Wrapped in the spirit mist and blessed by Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit, he moved with remarkable speed.

The greatest benefit of Li Yuanjiao's Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit was the increase in his cultivation speed. Although he had never matched Li Qinghong's rapid progress since childhood, this talisman had allowed him to catch up significantly.

Xijun... really trusts this monk, huh?

As he flew amidst the mist, Li Yuanjiao was preoccupied with his own thoughts.

He had inquired extensively with the Xiao Family about Kongheng and had also spoken privately with several fellow Daoists. In ancient times, there was a saying among Buddhist cultivators about overcoming tribulations; if several Mahas from the north were to incarnate, it would not escape the immortal mirror's notice.

Despite this knowledge, Li Yuanjiao still felt a flicker of anger though he was only acting. It was not directed at Kongheng, but rather at Li Xijun's insistence on protecting the monk.

Your grandfather and great-grandfather died at the hands of a Buddhist cultivator! How could you protect a Buddhist cultivator like this?!

Li Yuanjiao understood what kind of person Kongheng was, but Li Xijun's actions were still difficult for him to fully accept. With a sigh, he landed on the Mushroom Forest Plain.

The Mushroom Forest Plain has fertile soil, and was lush with green forests. Beyond the trees, dark peaks loomed on all sides, dotted with caves of various sizes.

The ores in these mountains were purple and black and were faintly crackling with energy, and thunder struck down from time to time, creating violent roars. A protective formation surrounded the mountain, and Li Qinghong must be among them.

As Li Yuanjiao landed at the foot of the mountain, a man hurried over. The Qi Cultivator, appearing slightly nervous, said respectfully, "Senior, this is my Yuan Family's territory... How may I assist you?"

Li Yuanjiao waved his sleeve and replied solemnly, "I am Li Yuanjiao of Qingdu."

The Qi Cultivator from the Yuan Family immediately understood and said, "Please proceed up the mountain, Senior. Senior Wushao is in the yard."

Li Yuanjiao nodded and flew upward, cloaked in the mysterious spirit mist that concealed his figure. From a distance, he heard a roar.

"Stupid monk, what are you reciting again?"

The corner of Li Yuanjiao's mouth twitched slightly. Li Wushao typically appeared fierce and brooding, so it was rare to see him lose his composure like this. Looking up, he spotted a young man in black standing against the courtyard wall with anger etched on his face.

"Fellow Daoist Wushao... this is called Respected Cultivator's Subduing Words. The seven Daos of the north excel at using this sutra to subdue demons. Please listen closely; it will prepare you for the future."

Kongheng stood in the courtyard, bare from the waist up, smiling peacefully as he held a golden light in his hand. Li Yuanjiao was slightly stunned; in less than three years, this person had already become a Master Monk!

Li Wushao gritted his teeth and appeared to be suffering from a terrible headache. Kongheng then remarked in a peaceful tone, "Remember to calm down and concentrate your mind, fellow Daoist... I will teach you a few ways to resist this."

"Fuck you," Li Wushao cursed, but he did not lash out physically. Instead, he listened obediently. Kongheng proceeded to recite hundreds of words, and Li Wushao memorized every single one of them.

"Monk, I've heard that Buddhist cultivators in the north enjoy capturing and taming demonic creatures, making them lose their minds... Is that true?" he asked curiously.

"Of course," Kongheng replied as he frowned and continued in a serious tone, "Once controlled by this spell, the affected are not comparable to spiritual beings... They lose themselves and completely transform into what is referred to as a spirit beast."

Li Wushao shook his head, visibly shaken by this piece of information. He then asked further, "Then don't you also want to capture demon creatures?"

"No," Kongheng said firmly, shaking his head, "Spells and techniques are meant to change yourself, not others. Using them to confuse people's minds is an evil Dao and one cannot become a Revered One on that path."

Li Wushao glanced at him, then nodded with a smile.

"You truly are an ancient cultivator. No wonder you say that the River Temple is declining day by day... But it's so difficult to practice and break through. If you have a spell but can't use it, you naturally can't compete with others."

"That's right," Kongheng agreed, appearing unconcerned about his own Dao lineage. He sat cross-legged and remarked thoughtfully, "I hope Xijun won't be in trouble because of me..."

Li Wushao, who was still sitting nearby, offered him some advice.

"If you ask me, since you've just broken through, you might as well return early and avoid causing trouble here. I've already sent news about your breakthrough back."

Kongheng insisted softly, "I'll keep watch here. If anything happens, I can take care of her. I'm a Master Monk and I can deal with a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator by myself."

After hearing this, Li Yuanjiao flew down and revealed himself, startling both Kongheng and Li Wushao. The latter jumped up in surprise and nearly reverted to his true form.

"Wushao greets Master!" he exclaimed.

Stealing a glance at Li Yuanjiao and noticing that he appeared normal, he breathed a sigh of relief. Kongheng looked at him with a hint of unease and replied softly, "This humble monk greets fellow Daoist."

"You are too polite, Master Monk," Li Yuanjiao said calmly.

"Since you have successfully broken through, why not return with me?"

"Sure," Kongheng responded respectfully.

"My temple's secret technique required the activation of the Supreme Void Yin Thunder. I made use of the Profound Thunderpool condensed by Daoist Qinghong while she was establishing her foundation. Since I have already made my breakthrough, I believe Daoist Qinghong will succeed soon as well."




# Chapter 488: Li Qinghong of Qingdu

"Qinghong will succeed soon?"

Li Yuanjiao felt a surge of quiet delight upon hearing this though he maintained a composed exterior, merely nodding as he said softly, "Master Monk, please return with me."

While Kongheng was quite talkative in front of Li Wushao, he only nodded in Li Yuanjiao's presence, rising to join him. Together, they ascended into the air, riding the wind back along the path Li Yuanjiao had come.

The journey was silent. Kongheng, surrounded by a golden glow, held his monk staff which emitted a mana light, giving him an ethereal appearance.

Li Yuanjiao shot him a glance and inquired, "Now that you've made a breakthrough, what are your future plans?"
𝑓𝘳𝘦𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝘯ℴ𝘷𝘦𝓁.𝑐𝑜𝑚

Kongheng lowered his head slightly and replied, "If your esteemed family has any requests, I will do my utmost to fulfill them. Otherwise, I will continue cultivating peacefully at Moongaze Lake."

Upon reaching the peak, Kongheng excused himself and settled down to meditate, while Li Yuanjiao stood contemplatively in the forest instead of resuming his cultivation in seclusion.

After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, an urgent call came from outside the formation—it was Kongheng's voice ringing with eagerness.

"I wish to see Benefactor Yuanjiao! Please open the formation!"

When the monk descended before Li Yuanjiao, he pleaded, "Senior! I can't possibly let Xijun suffer because of me! It's my fault that I was focused solely on the secrets of my cultivation secrets and refused to disclose much... Now that I have succeeded, I must express my gratitude to your esteemed family for their support."

Kongheng spoke at length, defending Li Xijun. Li Yuanjiao merely glanced at him and remained silent. Having been with the Li Family for over a decade, Kongheng's character was well-regarded by all.

Although Li Yuanjiao was not fond of Buddhist cultivators, he recognized that the strength of such a skilled individual should not be wasted.

After hearing all this, perhaps he can really be an asset to our family...

"This is my family's affair, Master Monk. Do not trouble yourself with it. Once I have finished punishing him, he will be released," Li Yuanjiao stated simply and decisively.

Kongheng shook his head and was about to interject when Li Yuanjiao asked, "You are a Master Monk who cultivates authentic technique from Liao River Temple; what makes you different from typical Buddhist cultivators from Zhao State? I'm guessing your current strength is no lesser than a standard Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, right?"

Kongheng responded with a shake of his head, "Benefactor does not practice Buddhism; it's very complicated. I can't fully explain it, but I can only say that it is comparable to the Foundation Establishment Realm of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. However, compared to the seven Buddhist Dao of the north, it falls a bit short."

Li Yuanjiao, having once encountered the ancient immortal cultivator Wang Xun from the Wang Family, had assumed ancient Buddhist cultivators would be much stronger.

"You're saying that ancient techniques are not as effective as today's techniques?" he asked in surprise.

"Indeed."

Kongheng sighed deeply, then explained, "Master Monk and Maha of Buddhism Dao correspond to the Foundation Establishment and Purple Mansion Realm. Master Monk practices internal cultivation techniques, seeking clarity and insight... However, today's Buddhist cultivators in Zhao State have taken a shortcut.

"Master Monk doesn't cultivate but venerates Maha and Dharma Master, reciting their names daily to borrow divine abilities and share Metallic Essence for constructing a giant statue, which aids in their cultivation. Hence, their strength is considerable, surpassing that of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators."

Li Yuanjiao listened intently to this seldom-shared insight. Kongheng continued, "This path bypasses self-cultivation, resulting in the creation of the Merciful One—pretty much a stronger version of Master Monk. But without any divine abilities, Merciful Ones are thus weaker against the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!"

"Conversely, the Mahas, less constrained by the Heavenly Dao and able to reincarnate freely from life to life, turn what was once a perilous existence into a stable one, and are stronger than Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

"I see!" Li Yuanjiao exclaimed, his long-standing confusion about the strength of these Buddhist cultivators finally cleared. His expression soon relaxed as Kongheng sighed deeply.

"Because those Master Monks from Zhao State derive their power from Mahas, their methods are particularly mystical. They can beguile and ensnare their targets, performing all manners of deceptions. Both monk soldiers and commoners are brainwashed and controlled by these Master Monks, who themselves are under the control of the Mahas' influences. Everyone in Zhao State obeyed readily; none dared to act out or express their discontent.

"The Master Monk commands from above and below, and the people comply joyfully; acts of violence are seen as justified, even cannibalism is welcomed, with elders eagerly awaiting their turn, and children wishing only to grow up faster to reach this so-called ultimate bliss..."

Tears welled in Kongheng's eyes as he whispered quietly, "Such a world... and all Master Monks call it the Buddhist State On Earth."

Kongheng looked rather lost as he murmured, "The Buddhist ancestors once envisioned a utopia—a world free from evil and sorrow, without killing or strife. They've achieved it and the people of Zhao State live in happiness and joy every day."

At these words, Li Yuanjiao felt a suffocating sense of foreboding and asked in a deep voice, "Then... What about the Emperor of Zhao State?"

"Those Jie people..." Kongheng lowered his head and continued, "A thousand years ago, the Jie people invaded the state with formidable power, blessed by heavenly fate and bearing the emperor's visage, aspiring to reign for generations. Zhao Zhaowu Emperor Fu Qiyan[1], who had been suppressing Buddhism forcefully, died suddenly overnight. His descendants lasted only a hundred years before falling under Maha's sway."

"After offering up the Metallic Essence and welcoming Maha to the capital, the current Emperor of Zhao State behaves like a mere slave... kneeling and worshiping the Maha!"

Li Yuanjiao then murmured in silence, "No wonder it is said that Zhao State will never be successful... and that the Emperor will die achieving nothing. His mind is not his own; how could he possibly ever achieve greatness?"

Kongheng sighed softly.

"Forgive me for losing my composure, Benefactor. My Dao lineage originates from the north, and though Zhao State's Buddhism conflicts with ours, I have always grieved for Zhao State."

"Who can say who is right or wrong? Night after night, people under my Liao River Temple's rule flee and smuggle themselves into Zhao State. Some even accused my temple of being an evil sect," he said sadly.

Kongheng paused, as though he was at the peak of his emotion. Li Yuanjiao asked a few more probing questions, then waved his hand and dismissed him.

Kongheng was a reasonable monk. Although he wished to continue appealing for Li Xijun, he ultimately sighed softly and remarked guiltily, "Xijun has indeed suffered because of me."

With that, he rode away on the wind, leaving Li Yuanjiao standing alone with his hand resting on the Qingche Sword.

"Second Uncle!"

While Li Yuanjiao was lost in thought, Li Ximing approached, riding the wind from behind him. He cupped his fist and bowed respectfully before saying, "Congratulations on your achievement in cultivation, Second Uncle! May you achieve the Purple Mansion Realm soon!"

This was his first time meeting Li Yuanjiao after he emerged from seclusion. Li Ximing had come to pay his respects, his tone earnest as he continued, "I believe Xijun has his reasons for what he has done..."

"Sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm... not bad."

Without responding to his remark, Li Yuanjiao assessed Li Ximing's cultivation with a hint of satisfaction and continued, "It seems you're not far from breaking through to the seventh heavenly layer. You should be ready to attempt establishing your foundation by the age of thirty."

Li Ximing shared everything about his cultivation journey, both significant and minor. Li Yuanjiao listened intently, then pressed him on with a question, his tone thick with incredulity and disbelief.

"You're saying that... bedroom activities can aid in cultivation?!"

Li Ximing, visibly embarrassed, nodded. Li Yuanjiao, however, was not one to gloss over such details. He pulled out a jade slip from his storage pouch, studied it intently, and finally said in a deep voice, "It seems there is some truth to this! While I'm not familiar with which Metallic Essence is used in the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, it is related to the Radiant Yang, so it makes sense."

With a nod, he dismissed the topic.

"I understand now... you may go."

Watching Li Ximing depart, Li Yuanjiao picked up a small letter on the desk. It had arrived early that morning from the Azure Pond Sect. Li Xizhi had always been reliable and managed to extract much information within the sect.

"Blood Sun Fruit."

Li Yuanjiao had never heard of this spirit medicine before, so he had to dispatch his men to gather more information about it. As for acquiring it, it seemed likely that a deeper expedition into Mount Yue would be necessary.

"I shall cultivate in seclusion first and address this matter when Qinghong returns after her breakthrough!" he decided.

1. Emperor's name is Fu Qiyan, Zhao Zhaowu Emperor is his posthumous title. ☜

Li Ximing returned to the courtyard and opened the lid of the blackened furnace, revealing the medicinal liquid inside. It was crystal clear, slightly gray, and somewhat sticky.

"Phew! It's still alright!"

The process was quick, and the elixir in the furnace had not yet solidified enough to ruin this batch—proof of Li Ximing's high talent and the teachings of Xiao Yuansi. Since returning home, he had yet to spoil a single batch of elixir.

After completely refining the pills, six emerged successfully from the furnace. Li Ximing stored them in a jade bottle when he was suddenly interrupted by two knocks at the door.

Li Ximing frowned slightly as the door creaked open and a person entered, respectfully announcing, "My lord, there's a female cultivator outside who was sent by the family head. She is seeking guidance."

"Seeking guidance...?" Li Ximing echoed. Despite being a bit startled, he commanded softly, "Bring her over."

The attendant retreated, and soon after, a woman entered the courtyard.

This woman appeared no older than twenty, with a graceful posture and fair skin, and was dressed in a green gown. With an innocent blink of her eyes, she bowed and said, "Meng greets Senior."

Li Ximing regarded her quietly and replied softly, "Ah, so you're from the Meng Family."

Meng Zhuoyun, sensing Li Ximing's slightly inappropriate gaze, maintained her respectful demeanor and explained, "I was ordered to seek Senior's guidance on the dao of alchemy... The family head has approved this arrangement."

"Good," Li Ximing replied, observing her with an intrigued expression before instructing, "Call forth your core flame so I can examine it."
𝚏𝐫𝚎𝗲𝕨𝐞𝐛𝕟𝚘𝐯𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝗺

His conversation with Li Yuanjiao had just concluded when Meng Zhuoyun arrived, arousing his suspicion.

Unsure and a bit cautious, Li Ximing thought to himself, Could it be that the Meng Family is ready to join our family, using this woman's charms as a tactic? She's close to breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm... She could be quite beneficial to my cultivation.

Meng Zhuoyun was a beauty with soft skin and fine features. It was no surprise that Li Ximing had no immunity against her. While he shared the secrets of alchemy, his mind was preoccupied with something else.

Meng Zhuoyun was no longer a naive girl; her sharp mind was already at work.

This Li Ximing seems different from the rest of the Li Family. I've heard he's quite taken with beauty... If I can endear myself to him, perhaps I could secure a better position within the Li Family.

Both harboring their own motives, they exchanged glances that were filled with unspoken intentions, their voices softening as they spoke.

————

Li Xijun did not have to kneel in the ancestral hall for long. He was allowed to resume his cultivation after just a few days.

Yet, Kongheng, concerned, visited often to check on him.

The Li Family operated smoothly until the arrival of spring. When the snow had melted, mana light hurriedly approached from the west amidst clouds and fog.

It halted at the boundary of the Li Family's territory. Xu Gongming, a mid-stage Qi Cultivator, immediately flew out to greet the visitor, cupping his fist as he began, "Fellow Daoist..."

The figure within the light materialized, revealing a burly man with an intense glare who was fully dressed in leather armor. He barked, "Is this the Li Family of Lijing?"

Xu Gongming, clearly taken aback by his tone, corrected him, "It's known as Li Family of Qingdu..."

The burly man's eyes reddened with intensity as he demanded, "I don't care whether it's Qingdu or whatever! I want to know if your family has the Wanglin Blossom!"

Realizing the man was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Xu Gongming was shocked and stammered hastily, "M-My family does possess this item... May I know why you're looking for it, Senior...?"

The burly visitor was delighted by the response. He grabbed Xu Gongming by the collar and said forcefully, "Bring it to me quickly... or I'll make you miserable!"

Captured in his grip, Xu Gongming felt intense pain shooting through his limbs. His lungs felt like they were on fire as he barely managed to gasp out, "Please wait a moment, Senior... I'll inform the elders!"

The man reluctantly released him and urged, "Go, go, go!"

Xu Gongming wasted no time, quickly descending to alert the family. The Jade Court Guards had already noticed the commotion and gathered around.

Li Xicheng arrived, propelled by the wind, demanded in a stern voice, "What's going on here? Why is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from another clan here?"

After Xu Gongming explained the situation, Li Xicheng frowned and said, "What nonsense is this! We're due to submit our tributes next year... The recent harvests of Wanglin Blossoms had long been sold to other clans. There's none reserved for him."

"Although we have kept a few for personal use, they are stored in the old ancestor's cave dwelling, and he has long retreated into seclusion!" he added.

While the two men were still discussing, the burly man above interrupted impatiently, "Enough talking! Does your family have the flower or not? Don't waste my time!"

His urgency was palpable as he stepped forward, reaching out commandingly. A group of cultivators, sensing a potential threat, rushed to surround Li Xicheng protectively.

Chen Mufeng, who was standing nearby, called out, "I'd advise you to think carefully before you act, Senior!"

The burly man halted abruptly. Though anxious, he was rational. With a stern look, he gritted his teeth and demanded, "Then bring out the flower, quickly!"

Li Xicheng was equally nervous as he commanded, "Go to Qingdu and summon the old ancestor immediately!"

As soon as he had finished speaking, thunder rolled, echoing across the heavens and earth, drowning out the rest of his voice with its resonant boom.

Rumble!

Dark clouds amassed from the south, accompanied by thunder that had been suppressed throughout the long winter. As the first thunderclap of spring reverberated, a brilliant purple light surged forward from the south.

"Fellow Daoist, you seek favor yet act so imperiously... It seems you hold little regard for my family!"

From the south, a Foundation Establishment Realm female cultivator in jade armor arrived amidst the storm, her heroic presence commanding respect. Her fine eyebrows above her beautiful almond eyes knitted together, conveying her warning.

Her long black hair fluttered in the wind, accentuating her delicate ears. Strands of purple electricity flickered through her hair, casting silver-white halos that captivated everyone present, rendering them speechless.

Holding her silver-white lance upside down, Li Qinghong descended valiantly before them.

"Auntie!" Li Xicheng exclaimed joyously, overwhelmed with emotion. He was visibly excited and failed to contain his laughter.

Li Qinghong nodded slightly, her gaze softening as she looked at her family members. She stepped on the rolling thunder and lightning beneath her feet, closing the distance between them.

Behind her, Li Wushao stood in awe, bowing slightly as he respectfully retreated a step. His clothes seemed scorched and tattered, as if he had been beaten up not long ago.

The previously belligerent man was initially offended, yet when his gaze landed on her, he was struck by her stunning presence.

His confidence waned slightly as he asked in a softer tone, "And who might you be?"

Li Qinghong was dressed neatly, her appearance heroic and unadorned by makeup. The lively purple lightning around her lent an air of majesty and invincibility to her already commanding presence.

With dense purple electricity flickering in her eyes, she announced her name proudly.

"Li Qinghong from the Li Family of Qingdu."




# Chapter 490: Cry

The burly man in front of Li Qinghong was momentarily stunned before recalling his purpose. Realizing the tough stance she had taken, he could only humble himself and soften his tone.

"I was indeed rude and offensive before... I wish only for a Wanglin Blossom! Please help me, fellow Daoist!"

Seeing him relent, Li Qinghong pulled a jade box from her storage pouch and replied kindly, "Saving lives is important. You can take it first."

The burly man's face lit up instantly with joy. Without pausing to express his gratitude or discuss any rewards, he nodded vigorously and took the flower, then dashed away like the wind.

Once he was gone, Li Qinghong lowered her spear and descended to the ground. Purple lightning flickered all around her, and below, Li Xicheng beamed with joy.

"Congratulations, Auntie!" he exclaimed, beaming.

She chuckled softly, ruffling Li Xicheng's hair.

"When I entered seclusion on the mountain, you were still a boy who dropped his spear because of thunder... Now, in the blink of an eye, you're already thirty years old. I can hardly recognize you!"

Li Xicheng also chuckled and could barely contain his happiness.

"I'm just glad you broke through successfully, Auntie!"

"Where's Brother Jiao?" Li Qinghong asked as she tightened her grip on the spear, "Now that I've finally reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, I'm itching to challenge him!"

"Hahaha..."

Laughter echoed from afar as a man in black rode in on the wind, his expression full of pride.

"You've really succeeded, Qinghong!"

"Greetings, Ancestor!"

It turned out to be Li Yuanjiao, who had been summoned by the person whom Li Xicheng had sent to summon him. All the cultivators bowed in haste.

Li Yuanjiao rarely showed such joy, laughing heartily.

"This is great!"

With a wave of his hand, he dismissed the external cultivators. He then looked Li Qinghong up and down, and upon seeing her gentle smile, praised, "I expected no less of an ancient method like the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique. The thunder and lightning you can harness, along with purple light flowing around you, give you a more powerful aura than me."

Li Qinghong laughed and replied, "I've achieved the Profound Thunderpool immortal foundation. I've transformed my sea of qi into a thunderpool, with purple and silver qi rising and thunder crackling everywhere around me—it's quite impressive."

With that, she brushed her hair back with a satisfied smile on her face.

"I've studied several spells at home, and the Profound Thunderpool is unsophisticated yet amazing. It was likely created at the same time as the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. However, there are some differences compared to today's immortal foundations."

She extended her hand, summoning purple thunder that coalesced into a deep purple rune. It shimmered with a radiant purple light, bobbing lightly above her palm.

Li Qinghong had clearly expended considerable energy to form this Thunder Rune, as her face turned slightly pale. She then went on to explain, "This is the Secret Origin Profound Thunder. It's extremely effective for killing and banishing demons and can be supplemented by the thunder of heaven and earth. Combined with the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique from the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, its power is astonishing!"

"This Profound Thunder is difficult to preserve; the only way to store it is in my sea of qi's Thunder Pool using the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique. I can then unleash it during battle, catching opponents off guard and posing a significant threat."

The Profound Thunder emanated a menacing aura, making Li Wushao gulp nervously as he thought quietly to himself, When the fairy first emerged, the thunder in her hands repelled me. I assumed it was incredibly powerful, but I didn't realize she still had the Profound Thunder in reserve... In a life-and-death battle, I could easily be caught off guard and easily be killed in just two strikes.

Li Yuanjiao's eyelids twitched with excitement, and a look of delight sparkled in his eyes.

"The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique may be challenging to master, but it's worth it! With this secret technique and the methods to supplement it, it significantly enhances combat power."

Li Qinghong clasped her palms together, returning the Thunder Talisman to the Thunder Pool.

"The Profound Thunderpool also can create an altar for spellcasting, allowing communication with heaven and earth to summon heavenly thunder."

Her fine eyebrows suddenly knitted slightly as she hesitated.

"However, I've heard that heaven and earth are different now compared to ancient times, so I'm uncertain if this spell will still work..."

As they spoke, Kongheng appeared out of the blue, riding the wind with a smile on his pale face. He lowered his gaze and addressed Li Yuanjiao before the woman.

"Kongheng greets Benefactor. Congratulations on establishing your immortal foundation too, Benefactor!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded politely, while Li Qinghong responded with a quick nod.

"Master Monk, you've also made significant progress in your cultivation. Congratulations to you as well," she commended.

"Yes... yes..." Kongheng replied, lowering his gaze as he chanted a sutra under his breath diligently, excusing himself as he continued his descent.

Li Yuanjiao observed Li Qinghong's furrowed brow and explained everything to her. After listening thoughtfully, she replied, "My technique comes from Thundercloud Temple. It seems to have some origins in Liao River Temple... but I still have a lingering doubt."

Tilting his head, Li Yuanjiao prompted her to continue her train of thought.

"This Thundercloud Temple is clearly associated with ancient Buddhist cultivators, yet the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique belongs to the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao! It makes no sense that it doesn't require reciting Dao scriptures while tapping on a wooden fish."

Li Yuanjiao frowned in confusion. After contemplating for a while, he still could not find an answer and decided to note it down.

"I'll ask Kongheng about it one day," he affirmed.

Li Qinghong nodded, then descended the mountain with her brother. She then asked, "How did an extra demon general find its way to our home during my absence?"

Li Wushao, who had been hiding behind them, finally seized the opportunity to speak.

"I'm Li Wushao, a lesser demon born in the Eastern Sea. I mistakenly entered Lake Xian and was fortunate to be taken in by the master to join Qingdu..."

Li Yuanjiao's mouth twitched as he sighed and interrupted him, "Where did you learn to sugarcoat things like that? That's not what happened. The Kong Family from Profound Peak Gate requested my help to eliminate this demon. Our family happens to be in need of Foundation Establishment Realm combat power, so I asked for a suitable technique to tame it."

"I see," Li Qinghong replied with a nod.

Li Wushao chuckled awkwardly, but Li Qinghong scrutinized him and teased, "Can't you transform into someone better looking or at least one that will make others feel at ease? You don't look trustworthy right now, so you can't blame me for being cautious when I first saw you."

Both Li Yuanjiao and Li Wushao paused. Li Yuanjiao shook his head helplessly at his sister's teasing smile.

"Do you have to always make fun of me?" he sighed.

Li Qinghong grabbed him, her eyes sparkling with excitement as she urged, "Come on, let's spar!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded, and the two of them soared into the air. Li Qinghong, not in a hurry to draw her spear, summoned a purple thunderstorm in the middle of her palm. With a flick of her wrist, a brilliant purple light surged forth.

A grayish-green serpent dragon coiled around Li Yuanjiao. Since his cultivation progress had improved in recent years, the serpent dragon looked even more vivid and fierce this time, its claws and fangs bared as its scales shimmered. With a roar, it leaped into action.

Boom!

The purple thunder struck the serpent dragon, causing it to roar in pain. Deep green water splashed down like rain, drenching their surroundings. Li Yuanjiao then advanced, wielding his sword under the protection of his immortal foundation.

The Jing Dragon King was unique; not only did it possess strong true essence, but it could also control water. When combined, it formed a water serpent dragon; and when separated, it transformed into snakes, shrimps, crabs, turtles, swords, axes, and halberds. This meant Li Yuanjiao did not need to bear the brunt of Li Qinghong's thunder, as he could simply leap away.

Despite his slight advantage with his immortal foundation, Li Yuanjiao did not let his guard down, and treated it as though he were facing a formidable opponent.

Others might underestimate his sister, thinking that getting close to a thunder cultivator like her would force her to defend herself and refrain from casting spells. However, Li Yuanjiao knew better. He had not seen Li Qinghong's spear skills in years now, and he was uncertain of her current prowess.

Sure enough, Li Qinghong smiled and drew her Duruo Spear. A pale purple light erupted from it as she thrust it fiercely forward at the speed of lightning. The spear turned into a blur, darting toward him successively like birds.

Clang!

Li Yuanjiao unleashed a dazzling green-white sword light. However, instead of clashing directly with him, Li Qinghong pivoted, using a deflection to redirect the force. She spun her spear and struck heavily to the side.

Oh no, she has read our family's sword techniques before and is very familiar with the Celestial Moon Slash technique!

Li Qinghong's talent with weapons far surpassed Li Yuanjiao's. With a thrust, a lift, and a swing, the purple lightning scattered. Li Qinghong retreated quite a distance but her pale purple spear shadow moved in direction, attacking Li Yuanjiao relentlessly.

Years of training had refined her skills. No longer limited to the Wing Clipper Spear Technique and Dragon Reflection, she wielded both spear techniques and spear energy with ease. Understanding that Li Yuanjiao relied heavily on a single, powerful sword strike, she closed the distance.

Li Yuanjiao's vulnerabilities were becoming evident. He struggled to keep up, using only his sword qi defensively. With each of Li Qinghong's attacks, the pressure intensified, forcing him to retreat.

His expression darkened as the sword light in his hand flowed like water, splitting into three pure white streams of light—sharp and agile.

"Threefold Moonlight!" he yelled out fiercely.

The three sword qi condensed, moving autonomously like spirits, each glowing with a bright white light. Li Qinghong recognized the technique and a grin broke out across her face as she twirled her spear in excitement.

"Brother, you've mastered it!" she exclaimed.

Li Yuanjiao did not respond. Instead, he seized the moment to sheath his sword, then drew it again to execute another Celestial Moon Slash technique. Li Qinghong danced with her spear to defend herself, but the three streams of light flowed and flew toward her forehead.

Her eyes ignited a fierce purple as the spear in her hand crackled with silver-white and dark purple lightning, roaring violently through the air. With a sweeping motion, she struck out, shattering the sword light before her.

Two pure white sword lights sprang from the rising lightning, landing on her wrist before abruptly dispersing.

"If you keep fighting, you'll bleed!" Li Yuanjiao warned with a smile.

Li Qinghong lowered her weapon, sighing with some regret.

"I've underestimated the Law of Celestial Moon! I guess it's impossible to overcome a Grade Five sword technique with brute force!"

"No need to be so modest, Qinghong. You might have been able to withstand those two sword lights. I've only just mastered it, but my strength has increased significantly. If you had returned a month earlier, I doubt I would have been able to hurt you at all," Li Yuanjiao replied, shaking his head.

"This time I got lucky. If you had unleashed the profound thunder as soon as you arrived or used the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique when I approached, I would have been in serious trouble. I would be injured before the fight even started and wouldn't even stand a chance against you," he added.

Li Qinghong put away her spear, offering a respectful bow.

"In the past, I was able to focus on practicing secret techniques and spearmanship because Brother Ping and you managed the household... Now that I've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, I can share your burden!"

"It's great that you feel this way, but we can still manage for the next few years," Li Yuanjiao replied, looking at her warmly.

"Perhaps you can look into the Blood Sun Fruit and... spend more time with Brother Ping," he suggested.

Li Qinghong bowed her head silently and responded with a soft hum, understanding her brother's unspoken concern.

Suddenly, someone approached, announcing respectfully, "Report to the ancestor, we have news from the desert in the west!"

"From Uncle?"

It was rare for Chen Donghe to bring news, and Li Yuanjiao quickly calculated the time. Realizing that it had not been long enough for Chen Donghe to finish gathering a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin spiritual qi, he felt a sudden unease in his chest.

Sure enough, the man bowed again and continued, "It's news about a death..."

————

Smoke Valley Temple.

The weather in the desert was perpetually dry. Chen Donghe had been living here for over ten years now and had long grown accustomed to it. One early morning, he called out softly, but there was no response.

His keen eyesight as a Qi Cultivator allowed him to see the frail figure of the old woman even in the dim light—seemingly lifeless, like a pile of firewood on the bed.

He stood frozen for a moment in silence.

"I suppose it's time to go home..." he murmured quietly to himself.

He gathered his belongings from the table and the wall, storing them in his storage pouch.

Carefully, he lifted Li Jingtian from the bed and stepped out into the yard. The sand scorched his feet, and he recalled how Li Jingtian always wanted to be carried.

"It's pretty cloudy today. It's rare to get such good weather in the desert... What a pity."

As he carried her on his back, he thought of how Li Jingtian had longed for a place with more rain, only to have passed away during the night in this barren landscape of yellow sand.

"Fellow Daoist Donghe!"

Bai Yinzi, the master of Smoke Valley Temple, had come to see him off. The man had tears glistening in his eyes as he whispered softly, "My condolences... My condolences..."

Chen Donghe maintained a stoic expression as he bid farewell to everyone. The cultivators of Smoke Valley looked at him with sorrowful pity, and he offered polite nods in return, carrying his wife on his back as he made his way through the wind.

It took several days to traverse the desert. Chen Donghe stopped midway to wipe the dew from Li Jingtian's face. Her skin felt stiff where he touched it, as hard as cowhide, and even frostbitten. She looked terrible.

Li Jingtian had been gone for a long time, yet no one had noticed.

Chen Donghe had ventured out during the evening, hoping to gather energy at sunset, but he had missed her critical moment. When he returned, he found her clutching the sheets at the edge of the bed, with a pained look on her face yet already devoid of breath.

Tian'er...

While Chen Donghe was lost in thought, he found himself at Mount Xiping. The earth veins here were thin, and the spiritual energy felt cut off. Although clouds and mist enveloped the mountain, and the sunset glow painted the sky beautifully, it was ultimately just an ordinary mountain.

No one would choose to linger in such a place. No matter how steep and towering Mount Xiping stood, how it blocked the southeast water veins and shaped the Smoke Valley Desert with its presence, it remained unrecorded and overlooked.

However, Li Jingtian loved this mountain.

Chen Donghe landed on the mountain and navigated it with familiarity, pushing aside the bushes and trees on the summit. There, he found two small black rocks and engraved them, making them into two stone tablets. They stood out remarkably against the mist and moisture of the mountain fog. Tilting his head, he gazed down at the endless sea of clouds and fog swirling beneath him.

From this vantage point, he could see the entirety of Moongaze Lake, several renowned immortal mountains, and even Mount Lijing and Mount Qingdu, looming hazily in the distance.

This was a spot Li Jingtian often visited, but the long journey back and forth took several days, and Chen Donghe could not always find the time to accompany her. Every visit brought her immense joy as if they were celebrating a festival together.

He gently laid her down on one of the stone platforms, exhaling softly, and leaned back against the stone wall wearily. Resting her head on his shoulder, they both stared into the distance in silence.

The wind howled around them, and the mountain felt cold and lonely today. Chen Donghe had always been quiet. He never spoke unless Li Jingtian did.

In the distance, the vast white clouds gradually transformed into a golden and red ocean under the morning glow, rolling and surging into various shapes.

The clouds flowed from afar, and the dark cliffs began to vanish into the whiteness, along with a pale, stiff corpse and an old man.

Sob...

A cry broke the silence, echoing from the boundless white clouds.

It was the heart-wrenching wail of an old man, choked with grief.




# Chapter 492: Deer Demon's Invitation

When news of Li Jingtian's death reached their ears, the Li Family entered a period of mourning. Although she was merely a mortal, she was still the daughter of Li Xiangping, the sister of Li Xuanfeng, and one of the family's oldest members.

Chen Donghe hurried back, carrying his wife's frail body in his arms. He seemed normal, and Li Yuanjiao received him at the border solemnly. Together, they walked back to the residence in silence.

Chen Donghe was seventy years old. Since he had only begun his Qi Cultivation at thirty, he retained his appearance in his early fifties. Nevertheless, he was still an elder in the family and stood tall at the funeral.

Li Qinghong had just learned of her mother Lu Wanrong's death, and now the body of her aunt Li Jingtian was being returned to the Li Family. With two relatives lost in such quick succession, she was engulfed in grief. The happiness on her face from the afterglow of her breakthrough was now overshadowed by sorrow.

After a busy period of six months, everything was finally settled. Since Li Qinghong was affected by grief right after her breakthrough, she needed another period of seclusion to stabilize her cultivation, leaving Li Yuanjiao to look after the family.

————

On Mount Qingdu.

Li Yuanjiao guided Chen Donghe into Mount Qingdu. Observing his uncle's steady demeanor and good health, he felt relieved and began politely, "We've caused you a great deal of trouble all these years, Uncle... Now that the younger generation has grown, you don't need to stay in that desolate place. You can leave the qi gathering task to them and focus on your cultivation."

"It's no trouble," Chen Donghe replied, bowing politely. He sighed before continuing, "Who do you plan to send there?"

Li Yuanjiao responded, "An Zheyan has two sons, both married to the daughters of the Li Family. They're mid-stage Qi Cultivators now—reliable and loyal. I plan to have them take turns gathering qi."

Chen Donghe nodded and responded, "I will write a letter to Bai Yinzi, then."

He paused shortly, then added, "Bai Yinzi is keen to form connections. He can send a few of his people to help us. Within twenty years, they should become our family's wings and pawns in the desert."

"Yes," Li Yuanjiao agreed readily. With a quick scan using his spiritual sense, he noticed that Chen Donghe had already reached the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Politely, he said, "Uncle has worked hard for many years, so I must reward you... I have a secret Barrier Breaking Pill at home. If you take it, you could break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm."

"That... I'm already an old man. It hardly seems worth it to take such a precious pill! It would be better to save it for Ximing or Xijun," Chen Donghe replied with a frown on his face. He spoke sincerely, not out of politeness.

"I'm over seventy years old! What difference does it make whether I break through to the ninth heavenly layer now or later? It's better to give it to the younger generation," he emphasized.

Li Yuanjiao could only force the pill into his hand and assured, "I've left enough for the children. How can you inspire confidence in others if you don't take this?"

Reluctantly, Chen Donghe accepted the pill, mumbling a few words of the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath before heading off to find a place to cultivate in seclusion.

Li Yuanjiao sat on a stone bench, gazing at the old books that Chen Donghe had brought back which were now piled on top of the table. These were all collected and annotated by Li Jingtian while she was still alive. He sighed softly as he put them away.

"Auntie... what a pity..." he murmured quietly.

He sat for a while in the courtyard before a tall man entered and bowed.

"Xicheng greets the ancestor."

Li Yuanjiao hummed in reply, raising his hand to help Li Xicheng up with his mana. Li Yuanping's health had gradually declined over the past six months, and most of the family's affairs were now in Li Xicheng's hands.

Li Xicheng cupped his fist and reported, "The family's output is increasing. The first batch of spirit fish raised through the demon beasts in the lake has been harvested and sold for seven Spirit Stones. In the future, we expect even more income—at least an additional four or five Spirit Stones every year."

"As for the two ore veins, they've been deeply excavated, but not many ores have been found yet. However, we should see output in a few years," he added.

When Li Yuanping took over the Li Family, it was facing annual deficits, and the family was in a state of financial turmoil. By the time it was handed over to Li Xicheng, the family had turned over a profit of over ten Spirit Stones each year. Li Yuanjiao nodded in approval at the news of the increased income.

"In recent years, the family has welcomed three new Qi Cultivators and five unrefined Qi Cultivators, replacing several Embryonic Breathing Realm members among the five peaks."

The Li Family was now showing signs of becoming a real clan with unrefined Qi Cultivators springing up like mushrooms after rain, alongside many pure Qi Cultivators. Li Xicheng himself had also reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

"An Zheyan is the strongest Qi Cultivator at the ninth heavenly layer. Chen Donghe and Uncle Xuanxuan are both in the late stage, while Tian Zhongqing, Xu Gongming, White Monkey, Chen Mufeng, Li Wen, and others are in the mid-stage. In addition, there are eleven early-stage Qi Cultivators from other families and the Jade Court Guards, making a total of twenty-seven pure and forty-one unrefined Qi Cultivators."

"As for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, there are four members—Second Uncle, Aunt Qinghong, Senior Wushao, and Master Monk Kongheng. The Li Family has now caught up with the former Yu Family and has become the overlord of the lake!"

With a sigh, Li Xicheng continued, "Our family now oversees more than 450,000 people, but our spirit fields are limited and we've done our best to manage them. Since we're bound by the oaths among the three families, we can't move north. Otherwise, we could sweep through Moongaze, Milin, and Glacial Cloud... The Fei and Yu families wouldn't be able to stop us!"

The Li Family was thriving with newly promoted Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, as well as increasing numbers of pure and unrefined Qi Cultivators. However, as the seats of authority on the five peaks were gradually filled, a situation akin to that of 'too many monks and too little porridge' began to emerge.

Li Yuanjiao listened to Li Xicheng before nodding slightly and replied, "If we want to move north, we must first eliminate Yu Muxian, secure a position in the Azure Pond Sect, and make Moongaze Lake subordinate to Qingsui Peak to achieve success. Azure Pond rotates its management every seventy years, and Yuanwu Peak only has twenty years left."

Li Xicheng responded with a hum, prompting Li Yuanjiao to continue, "Now that our family has four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, we should consider setting up a branch overseas. Most of the local Foundation Establishment Realm demon generals already have some background, making it unwise to capture them. Moreover, establishing a branch out there will allow us to communicate with the outside world, obtain spirit items, and absorb the population."

Li Xicheng listened intently, waiting for his uncle to make a decision. However, Li Yuanjiao remained concerned and mumbled to himself, "Most of the large and small islands overseas already have owners, making it difficult to find a safe and spacious place to settle. Additionally, we need at least two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to maintain a foothold. Whoever we send out... might not be appropriate."

Li Wushao was the local power in the Eastern Sea and would be the most suitable choice for this task, but the excavation of the mine in Moongaze Lake had just begun. Without a demon general to oversee it, the demons might not follow anyone else's orders. If Li Wushao were to leave for an extended period, problems could arise.

As Li Yuanjiao calculated in his mind silently, An Zheyan hurried in, reporting respectfully, "Ancestor! A fox sent a letter."

"Huh..? Bring it here quickly!"

Upon hearing that it was from a fox, Li Yuanjiao eagerly responded, knowing that it must be a letter from the White Banyan Fox. An Zheyan wore a strange expression on his face as he nodded and exited.

Not long after, An Zheyan returned, gliding in on the wind while cradling a pillow-sized red fox in his arms. The fox had striking green eyes and held a jade slip in its mouth, appearing quite well-behaved.

"Oh, it's an actual fox... not a fox demon," Li Yuanjiao mumbled upon this realization, accepting the jade slip and reading it carefully.

"...The den has already sent a demon general... It's a deer demon... at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. It has prepared a gift... and wants to speak with our family..."

So, a new demon general has been appointed... The demon den's response is surprisingly slow!

Li Yuanjiao nodded in understanding, then handed over the jade slip to Li Xicheng who quickly read through it and wondered aloud, "This deer demon... is it afraid of our family?"

"How can it not be afraid?" Li Yuanjiao laughed as he went on to explain, "The previous generals died at our family's hands, and the White Banyan Fox has handled everything quietly. That's typically how the three sects and seven gates operate!"

"Since this new demon general is forced to guard this place, it naturally wishes to negotiate with us. Otherwise, it'd just be sitting there, waiting for us to take its life."

Li Yuanjiao turned his gaze to the obedient little red fox before him and added softly, "Let's see what kind of creature this deer demon really is."

Li Xicheng nodded slightly, allowing An Zheyan to take the fox away. He then reminded, "Ancestor... Uncle Xuanxuan's inner demon is growing stronger with each passing day. Although the old man doesn't speak of it... we can't just stand by and watch."

Li Yuanjiao's expression turned grim as he heard this. He shook his sleeves and replied in a deep voice, "Xijun has mentioned it to me several times... I've been inquiring about it for a while now. I've heard that the Hengzhu Dao Gate has a way to resolve it. Find someone to take him there!"

With that, Li Yuanjiao turned away and left indifferently.

Li Xicheng stood stunned for a moment, then smiled bitterly as he watched his ancestor float away, murmuring to himself, "But... it costs a lot, and Uncle Xuanxuan will probably refuse to go!"

Caught in a dilemma, he glanced at the Jade Court Guards standing silently beside him. After a moment of contemplation, he then said softly, "I can only ask Brother Jun!"

————

Ancestral Hall.

Li Xijun spent another half a year on the mountain. Since many assumed he had been grounded, no one dared to disturb him. He focused on his training with his sword and spells during this peaceful period and was able to improve significantly in both.

When news of Li Jingtian's passing arrived, Li Yuanjiao visited him several times to chat. Even in the ancestral hall, Li Xijun was dressed all in white. He was still worried about Li Xuanxuan.

"The old man hasn't been mentally healthy... I wonder if he can bear this news."

After another half month of cultivating in the ancestral hall, Li Xijun planned to leave once his three-year term was up. Just then, Li Xicheng rushed in with news, and Li Xijun found it difficult to sit still.

Both sides are unwilling to give in...

Concerned about Li Xuanxuan, he learned that Li Qinghong was in seclusion and Li Yuanjiao had left yet again. Unable to contain himself, he finally exited the ancestral hall and flew to the Alchemy Pavilion.

Upon arriving at the entrance, he noticed a woman standing quietly by the door—a fair-skinned and beautiful Qi Cultivator. As her gaze fell upon him, she said respectfully, "Greetings, Senior."

"Ah... it's you, Meng," Li Xijun replied, his tone distant. He then went on to knock on the door before him.

Inside, Li Ximing was manipulating a vermillion flame—Long Marching Fire Essence. With a push of his hands, six pills flew out, and he stored them away while asking simultaneously, "Who is it?"

Li Xijun waited until Li Ximing had put away his pill flame before entering the hall, pleased to receive a guest when he was focused on his alchemy.

"You've holed yourself up for a year and are finally willing to come out?" he asked with a teasing smile.

Li Xijun shook his head and inquired, "Let me ask you... how many pills did Uncle take this year? Is it a normal amount?"

Li Ximing's expression soured as he replied softly, "That's a difficult question. He's taken many of them—Tranquility Pills, Jade Ice Pills, and Turning Cloud Pills, but their effectiveness is diminishing... I'm afraid we can't delay it any longer. Grandfather refuses to speak of his trouble and Second Uncle rarely inquires..."

Li Xijun gently shook his head and said, "Second Uncle has come several times to the ancestral hall, waiting for me to bring this up. Although the two of them may not seem very close, they are still father and son."

Li Ximing felt a wave of sadness as he remarked, "He just can't set aside his pride and speak up..."

His words were unclear, leaving Li Xijun unsure of whom he was referring to. Li Xijun simply looked at him, shaking his head with a sigh.

Having carefully reviewed the Family History in the ancestral hall over the years, Li Xijun could only say, "There's a gap between father and son, and the only uncle[1] who could resolve it died early. And so... they continue to drift apart. Uncle Xuanxuan can't swallow his pride, and Uncle Jiao can't bring himself to express his feelings. Yet, both of them are hurting inside..."

Li Xijun took a jade slip from his robe and added softly, "Uncle Jiao may not say it, but he's obviously worried. He has sent someone to inquire about a cure some time ago. Uncle's condition can no longer be cured by ordinary pills and medicine... There's a calming spell at Hengzhu Dao Gate that should be able to help."

"I know that too, however, that spell requires many spirit items and costs forty or fifty Spirit Stones each time. Grandfather is used to being frugal; how can he agree to that?" Li Ximing asked helplessly.

"That's easy—we'll just do it without asking for his opinion. I'll trick him into coming along under the pretense of looking for spirit water. Once we reach Hengdong Prefecture, I'll invite the people from Hengzhu Dao Gate. By then, Granduncle will have no choice but to comply," Li Xijun whispered.

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly, rather excited by the plan.

"Good idea! But with so many devil cultivators around now, I'm afraid something might happen if only both of you were to travel south..."

"Don't worry, Kongheng will accompany us there. He's an orthodox Buddhist cultivator and excels at calming the mind and nurturing qi, so there shouldn't be any issues along the way," Li Xijun reassured him.

He winked at Li Ximing with a smile and said, "I shouldn't be the one making this suggestion. You'll need to present it as your own idea to Uncle Jiao."

Li Ximing nodded and replied, "I understand."

With that, Li Xijun said nothing more. He nodded, then flew directly to the cave dwelling on the mountain to invite Li Xuanxuan.

Left sitting in the Alchemy Pavilion in a daze, Li Ximing was soon interrupted by Meng Zhuoyun, who gently pushed the door open and said softly, "Brother Ming..."

Li Ximing breathed a sigh of relief and led her inside. The two exchanged glances, and Meng Zhuoyun sat beside him. Both of them had spent more than a year together, and having already done the deed long ago, there was no longer the need for formality between them.

Li Ximing skillfully pulled open the collar of her white robe and caressed her smooth, delicate shoulders, but his mind was elsewhere.

His gaze lingered on Meng Zhuoyun's beautiful eyebrows, and he noticed the dark blue osmanthus hairpin in her hair. It appeared to be a dharma artifact that complimented her white attire wonderfully.

Meng Zhuoyun seemed to sense his gaze and spoke softly, "This was what my father left me before he passed away. He spent several days crafting it."

Li Ximing's heart sank.

"Elder Meng has passed?! When did it happen?"

"Last night," she replied quietly, "He didn't know his limits and died after only three months of secluding himself to attempt a breakthrough."

Li Ximing immediately released her shoulders and comforted her.

"My condolences..."

Meng Zhuoyun chuckled softly and asked tenderly, "What? You don't want to do it today?"

Li Ximing murmured, "It's a pity for Elder Meng... Alas, life and death are like this; there's nothing we can do. He lived for over 190 years, longer than many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Not many can live to two hundred years old..."

As Meng Zhuoyun listened to his endless rambling, she could not help but find it rather amusing. Tears filled her eyes as she leaned in and kissed him, biting his lower lip.

Li Ximing tasted saltiness on his lips, realizing it was her sadness. He tried to console her, but she finally stopped pretending, her tears flowing freely as she cried out loud, "Are you going to do it or not?"

He looked at her in confusion, then pulled her into his embrace as she broke down completely.

"Think about how many can live to two hundred years old..." he repeated with a long sigh.

Meng Zhuoyun cried and laughed through her whirlwind of emotions. After a long moment, she finally let out a soft sigh.

1. Referring to Li Yuanxiu, Li Yuanjiao's big brother who is dead. ☜




# Chapter 494: Luken

Li Yuanjiao rode the wind along the northern foothills of Mount Dali, the mountains and rivers passing swiftly beneath him. Spirit mist poured out of the Profound Patterned Bottle, shrouding him as he flew onward with his hands clasped behind his back, his expression calm and composed.

Xijun should be able to manage it... Although the old man is stubborn, he is aging and in poor health. A little tact might coax him out.

Li Yuanjiao's face darkened. He had always felt dissatisfied with Li Xuanxuan's neglect of his own health.

He really likes dragging things out...

Li Yuanjiao suddenly recalled a moment from his youth when his mother, Mu Yalu, had sat with him alone in the yard. She was still young then, with her flowing silky hair draping over her shoulders.

She always told him gently—"Your father... is a very boring man. He loves only one thing in this life—the Li Family. Even Xiu'er barely made it to the list. Li Xuanxuan doesn't even love himself, maybe he's even disappointed in himself. He never takes care of himself and looks down on himself, thinking that his life is probably worth less than a few pieces of Spirit Stones."

At the time, Li Yuanjiao still did not understand what she meant, but now, witnessing his father's state, the truth finally dawned upon him.

Among all the members of the Li Family, he only looks down on himself. After the old ancestor's death, he has lost all interest in living. He keeps drawing talismans day and night, longing for death yet afraid to embrace it.

Li Yuanjiao felt a pang in his heart, but yet could not bring himself to say those words out loud.

Before his mother drew her final breath, she refused to look at Li Xuanxuan. He never shed a tear for her either. Li Yuanjiao stood between them at the time, feeling a mix of both sadness and anger.

"Forget it," he mumbled.

Not wanting to dwell on it further, he pushed his thoughts aside and continued flying through the mountains.

Soon enough, he spotted two brown deer demons flying toward him, their smooth, delicate fur glistening in the light. They stood together and spoke earnestly, "Greetings, Exalted Immortal!"

These two deer demons were both late-stage Qi Cultivators, bowing so low that their heads were nearly buried in the clouds. They dared not look directly at him, only glancing nervously at his Qingche Sword.

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, and the deer demon on the left explained hurriedly, "I serve the demon general. The general has specially prepared a banquet and would like to invite the Exalted Immortal to join us!"

Their politeness caused Li Yuanjiao to grow suspicious. He quietly tightened his grip around the hilt of his sword. Although the White Banyan Fox was a guarantor, he was not certain of the deer demon's strength. If they harbored ill intentions, a peaceful resolution could be difficult.

He had not brought the mirror with him this time, but fortunately, the Qingche Sword retained a sword intent within it, so dispatching a deer demon would not be a problem.

Since I've asked the White Banyan Fox to introduce me, they shouldn't ambush me. If they do, I'll have no choice but to use my sword intent.

When he rode the wind closer, Li Yuanjiao noticed that both sides were lined with demons bowing their heads in respect. Most were deer species, their fur similar in color and perfectly symmetrical, having fully adopted the ways of the human race.

As he rode along, he spotted three tables set up beneath a massive white banyan tree. The White Banyan Fox lounged comfortably on the table at the front, munching on a spirit peach.

Next to him stood a middle-aged man with brown hair and black eyes. His long hair cascaded past his shoulders, over a large shield that he carried on his back. Li Yuanjiao sensed that he was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm Cultivator and guessed that he was the demon general.

The tables were filled with an array of peaches, apricots, fruit wine, and fresh flowers. As soon as Li Yuanjiao landed, the middle-aged deer demon approached him with a polite greeting.

"Luken of Mount Dali greets fellow Daoist," he said.

Luken had a small face, round eyes, and a rare yellowish-brown hair color—remnants from his transformation. His clear eyes held no trace of bloodlust or cruelty.

"Li Yuanjiao of Qingdu."

Li Yuanjiao observed Luken, noting the clear aura between his eyebrows, which set him apart from the pig demon before. Having a better impression of him, Li Yuanjiao bowed respectfully to the White Banyan Fox.

"Greetings, Senior."

Although he had witnessed the White Banyan Fox's abilities in the cave, the friendship between the fox and Li Tongya alone compelled him to show respect. Despite his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he remained humble and courteous.

The fox nodded, flipped over, and slid behind the table.

"I've taken care of the pig demon's issue. Since his background was lacking, I added a few more Spirit Stones and invited this Daoist friend to join us."

Pointing to the deer demon, it continued, "This is Luken, a kind demon and my friend from the den. You can interact freely with him in the future."

Li Yuanjiao thanked him and quickly retrieved ten Spirit Stones from his Storage Pouch to offer to the White Banyan Fox. The fox accepted six pieces and tucked them away, reaching for another spirit peach to munch on while saying, "Carry on, both of you; I have some other matter to attend to."

With that, he took off. Luken then turned to Li Yuanjiao and said, "When I was cultivating on the southern foothill, I'd already heard about your esteemed clan. Now that I see you, it's clear you are indeed exceptional."

Li Yuanjiao merely nodded in acknowledgment. Luken then led the others to sit down, producing a jade box.

Presenting it with a smile, he said, "This is the Qianyan Radiant Fruit, a treasured panacea. It's a gift for you. I'll be cultivating in the northern foothills from now on and I would appreciate any guidance you might offer..."

Li Yuanjiao opened the jade box to find an orange-red stone bead inside. It had no distinct smell, and its light was faint.

Luken quickly explained, "Don't be fooled by its unassuming appearance, fellow Daoist! This fruit is highly beneficial for cultivators practicing earth and stone techniques. It can aid in cultivation and breakthroughs, and it has many miraculous effects when used to craft dharma artifacts. If consumed, it can also stop bleeding and prolong lives."

Li Yuanjiao shook his head slightly and replied, "Fellow Daoist, you must have been cultivating for quite some time to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. It's quite rare to find any earth and stone cultivators in Yue State, aside from those in the Profound Peak Gate. This treasured panacea... it's not particularly useful to me as I also have a Wanglin Blossom at home, which is also quite well-known... It can also be used to prolong lives."

Luken's expression fell slightly as he lowered his head. He rummaged through his sleeves and pulled out two large deer antlers that resembled small trees rather than twigs.

He said warmly, "I didn't mean to present such a meager gift! These antlers were shed when I reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. They're substantial enough to be made into weapons or dozens of Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts."

Though Luken had kept these antlers all this time with the intention of crafting them into dharma artifacts for himself, he reluctantly offered them instead.

Li Yuanjiao had no desire to embarrass him. Since the White Banyan Fox had made it clear that the deer was its friend, he had to be courteous toward the deer too and instead asked, "Fellow Daoist, do you know anything about the Blood Sun Fruit?"

"Blood Sun Fruit? That sounds unfamiliar," Luken replied with a slight frown.

However, he visibly relaxed when he received the request from Li Yuanjiao.

"While I haven't heard of that treasured panacea, you've come to the right person. I'm older and hold some sway among the other demons. I'll ask around for you—it's no trouble at all!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded and described the Blood Sun Fruit as outlined in the letter from Li Xizhi, detailing its appearance and characteristics for Luken to note. He then inquired, "How old are you, fellow Daoist?"

Feeling reassured after receiving clear instructions, Luken replied, "I am over five hundred years old. If we count from when I gained intelligence, I've been around for more than four hundred years."

"That's pretty impressive!" Li Yuanjiao responded.

Although Luken was over five hundred years old, he still appeared middle-aged and in his prime, suggesting a lifespan of around a thousand years—something many would envy.

Luken sighed and said, "Fellow Daoist, you're correct. Despite our long lifespans, few of us live to see a full life. Many without backing are captured or killed early on, and even those with backgrounds are often treated as commodities with clear price tags."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in understanding, thinking to himself, It seems that most of these demon generals are quite aware of their circumstances, yet they remain powerless to change their situation.

Luken smiled and continued politely, "When I was still uncivilized, I cultivated alongside other deers in the Mushroom Forest Plain. Azure Pond Sect had just been established at that time, and the Yuan Family had only been based there for a few decades. When the Yuan Family later destroyed the Mushroom Forest Demon Den, I moved to Mount Dali.

"I had a close friend in the Dali Demon Den, and he had kept me safe for hundreds of years. Unfortunately, he failed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm and perished. After that, I was released to become a demon general, and I've held that position for several decades now."

Though this deer demon had lived for a long time, he spent most of his time cultivating in the forest. He did not seem to be a cunning person and was rather pleasant to talk to.

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and remarked, "It seems like you have quite a strong background in the demon den, fellow Daoist."

Luken shook his head and quickly replied, "Nothing like that! Forgive me for saying this, fellow Daoist, but the sword immortal of your esteemed clan also served Azure Pond... did the sect take care of him? It's the same with the demon den but even more ruthless. If I hadn't requested to leave the den, I would have been eaten sooner or later."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in understanding. His interest was piqued after hearing that Luken was five hundred years old.

"Fellow Daoist, do you also know about... the war four hundred years ago?" he asked carefully.

"Of course I do! It was a significant event. My old friends died one after another, and now there are only a few who know of it."

Luken nodded, looking at Li Yuanjiao's expectant gaze, then continued, "The Golden Feather Sect and Azure Chi Gate surrounded Li Jiangqun and killed him; the sun and moon darkened and the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators formed a formation to block the supreme void. The Azure Chi Devil Gate had been established for five hundred years, but this battle drained its strength and shook its foundation."

Li Yuanjiao frowned and asked, "Wasn't it the three sects and seven gates?"

"Three sects and seven gates..?"

Luken was taken aback before saying, "Of course not! Yue Cultivating Sect and Snow Ji Gate were never involved... Profound Peak Gate and Changxiao Gate weren't established until later. Apart from Lingyu Gate on Li Jiangqun's side, only the Golden Feather Sect and Azure Chi Devil Gate joined forces with Hongxue, Lichi, and Wuzhu Gates."

"Please elaborate, fellow Daoist!" Li Yuanjiao urged.

Luken nodded and continued, "It was an intense battle. The Golden Feather Sect and the Devil Gate were better off. Most of the Daoist Masters from Hongxue, Lichi, and Wuzhu Gates were killed by Daoist Master Donghua... One of the Daoist Masters from Wuzhu Gate managed to escape thousands of li to the Eastern Sea, but he still vomited blood and died in the end, which was great for the Eastern Sea cultivators."[1]

"The surviving Daoist Master of Hongxue Gate obtained the immortal sword of Daoist Master Donghua, but he also died on the way back. Since then, the immortal sword has been missing, and the cultivators of Jiangnan and Jiangbei have searched for it everywhere. Imaginations roamed."

Luken then lowered his voice and whispered apprehensively, "Although Daoist Master Donghua is dead, he managed to wipe out the three Dao lineages single-handedly. Those from Azure Pond Sects and Golden Feather Sects lived in fear for a hundred years... He was truly a genius!"

Li Yuanjiao processed the information and asked softly, "But... Why did they have to kill Li Jiangqun?"

Luken shook his head, confusion etched on his face as he replied, "No one knows. Li Jiangqun cultivated on the lake by himself, and The Golden Feather Sect and the Devil Gate would even occasionally seek his help. Daoist Master Donghua had always assisted them... He was praised for his contributions but then the sects suddenly turned hostile overnight! They wanted him dead no matter what!"

The deer demon sighed.

"The thoughts of Purple Mansion and Golden Core Relm cultivators are beyond the understanding of others. Just like this devil plague... Jiangnan's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators only watched without intervening. Who knows what their true intentions are?"

Li Yuanjiao nodded, considering this. He then asked casually, "What dharma artifact did Daoist Master Donghua use?"

"What else could it be?" Luken smiled before answering, "A sword, of course..."

"Just one sword...?" Li Yuanjiao asked again.

"Only that one sword," Luken confirmed with a nod.

"One that could kill a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator and dispel his divine abilities. It caused leaves to fall from Mount Dali like rain and raised the water level of Moongaze Lake by three chi. I was still at the Qi Cultivator back then but I remember everything vividly," Luken said, gazing off into the distance.

Luken paused, seemingly lost in his own memories.

"Daoist Master Donghua had already reached the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, yet he died overnight. For three nights, no moon was sighted in the region; the sky was as black as ink. I couldn't cultivate for those three whole nights. I hid in the cave, gripped by only fear."

No moon...

Li Yuanjiao felt a sense of relief mixed with regret as he remarked, "This phenomenon showed that he must have been close to achieving the Golden Core Realm."

Although that was what he said, he pondered inwardly to himself, Daoist Master Donghua had only a sword... So the immortal mirror isn't Lu Jiangqun's dharma artifact! If it belongs to the Moonlight Origin Mansion... who else could it belong to if not Li Jiangqun?

After a few more absent-minded exchanges with Luken, Li Yuanjiao reminded, "Fellow Daoist, about the Blood Sun Fruit—please help me locate it. If you find one, my family will reward you generously!"

"Rest assured..." Luken replied readily.

Li Yuanjiao nodded then added, "Please do your best then. My family needs more than one, so don't worry."

Luken understood his implication and nodded repeatedly. With that, Li Yuanjiao departed on the wind.

As he flew away on a cloud of mist, Luken sighed with relief and returned to his seat. He glanced at his bewildered subordinates and waved his hand.

"You're all dismissed!"

The lesser demons bid farewell. Luken eyed the untouched fruit wine that Li Yuanjiao had left behind, poured it back into his jade cup, and took a sip. Just then, the White Banyan Fox approached on demonic wind and landed gracefully before him.

"Greetings, young master!" Luken said, bowing hurriedly.

The White Banyan Fox shook his head indifferently.

"I'm no longer a young master. Since my adoptive father died, neither of us has any backing... We're just lingering here..."

Luken replied in a hushed tone, "As long as you break through to Foundation Establishment Realm, you'll earn the surname of the fox clan and return to the demon den once again. Don't underestimate yourself..."

The White Banyan Fox did not respond to Luken's remarks but instead lay down under the tree with its legs propped on the table, and changed the subject.

"How do you find Li Yuanjiao?"

Luken pondered for a moment before answering, "I've seen many demons, but I rarely interact with humans. This one reminds me of a serpent dragon—unwise to offend... and being targeted would be even more troublesome. It's best to stay on good terms with him."

The White Banyan Fox flicked its tail and replied, "Fortunately, you don't eat people and with my favor, he won't trouble you... Once I go into seclusion, just take care of yourself and cooperate more."

Luken nodded as the White Banyan Fox yawned and murmured, "My cultivation has improved rapidly over the past ten years. I can choose a day to enter seclusion soon... It would be great if I could break through. If I fail, you should just join the Li Family as long as your spirit remains intact..."

With that, the fox dozed off, leaving Luken to sit at the table alone, sipping the fruit wine and lost in his own thoughts.

1. Recap: Daoist Master Donghua is Li Jiangqun's title. ☜




# Chapter 496: Generation Of Cheng and Ming

Mount Qingdu had been here for nearly ten years now. The earth vein had shifted, and three small peaks had emerged on either side, varying in height. The tallest of these mountains rose about a hundred ren, reaching halfway up the main Qingdu Peak, while the shortest stood at fifty to sixty ren. Many houses had been constructed on these slopes. [1]

The highest secondary peak was Talisman Peak which was reserved all year round for Li Xuanxuan, along with several apprentices that were practicing the Talisman Dao.

As for the lower peaks, they were occupied by the brothers from the minor sect of the Li Family—Li Chengchu and Li Chengyou.

By now, those two brothers had successfully condensed the Jade Capital Chakra. They had been working alongside Li Xicheng to manage family affairs and were considered reliable.

Xicheng conducts himself well... The two brothers have been raised in Qingdu Cave Dwelling since childhood as well; they are both loyal and dependable.

Li Yuanjiao rode the wind and landed back at Mount Qingdu. The cave entrance atop the mountain was brightly lit, and guarded by two men. The stone steps he descended led to a huge cave dwelling.

The former Snake Demon Cave Dwelling was now known as Qingdu Cave Dwelling, having been renovated by the Li Family over the decades. The holes in the walls were neatly arranged, and though the spiritual energy here was not particularly strong, it was extremely spacious and capable of accommodating several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Supporting Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators was a challenge for many prestigious clans. Thanks to Li Tongya's foresight in claiming this site years ago, the Li Family faces no shortage of space even with an increasing number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators now.

The fire vein on Mount Wutu has been developed, and Kong Gusun of the Profound Peak Gate is still overseeing it, ensuring its stability. Ximing has started to relocate there... Qinghong is in seclusion again; no wonder it feels so deserted here.

As he was observing the scenery before him, Li Xijun approached on the wind and bowed respectfully.

"Greetings, Second Uncle."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in response and asked, "When do you plan to attempt a breakthrough in seclusion?"

Although Li Xijun had always been dependable when it came to work, he had lingered at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm for some time now, accumulating his cultivation. Given the majestic aura he now possessed, he seemed ready for a breakthrough.

"Probably within these few days," he replied respectfully.

Li Xijun and Li Yuanjiao wandered around the Qingdu Cave Dwelling for a while when a faint sound suddenly caught their attention.

Li Yuanjiao remarked, "Ahead is..."

"Most of the children of the Cheng and Ming generation are cultivating in this cave dwelling," Li Xijun replied.

It was only at this moment that realization dawned upon Li Yuanjiao.

"More than ten years have passed without us noticing, and the children from the generation of Cheng and Ming have grown up..."

The two of them rode the wind forward and found a group of teenagers gathered in the courtyard, sparring with each other in excitement.

These boys and girls were, of course, the children of the Cheng and Ming generation in the family.

This was the first time Li Yuanjiao had seen this group of children. He gently observed them, concealing his presence. Since these children had yet to reach the Jade Capital Stage, he could easily hide himself without using the power of his Profound Patterned Bottle.

Li Xijun had been in seclusion for several years, dedicating himself to rigorous cultivation with little time to spend with family, so he had only seen the children a few times before. He too performed a hand seal to conceal his presence, then stood among the clouds and watched them.

The youngest among them was only six, while the oldest was about fifteen or sixteen. Their cultivation levels ranged from the first to the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

"No wonder Brother Cheng said there's no one who particularly stands out... Most of these children can only be considered slightly above average."

Li Xicheng, the least talented among the Xi and Yue generation, had already reached the Celestial Whirl Stage at fifteen. Although the generation of Cheng and Ming was flourishing, most of its members in the major sect were promoted from the minor sect. Li Xicheng and a few cultivators of the Xi and Yue generation were yet to have children, leaving no one with extraordinary talent.

Li Xijun's gaze lingered on the group in the courtyard. While none was particularly outstanding, the oldest boy was tall and spoke with an air of confidence.
𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝑐𝘰𝑚

With thick eyebrows and sparkling eyes, he held a spear in his hand and stood in the center of the courtyard, managing his younger brothers and sisters, who all seemed to respect him.

Li Xijun observed him closely as he organized the matches among the children, instructed his younger siblings, and helped the injured ones. He found him rather interesting.

Li Yuanjiao, focused intently on the scene below him, noticed the boys and girls chatting together and felt a swell of happiness as he floated down.

————

"Brother Liao!"

Li Chengliao, now sixteen, was the oldest among the children. With thick eyebrows, he appeared unremarkable but commanded attention as he stood with a sword in hand. He had just finished training with the other disciples and invited them to sit together.

Once they were seated, Li Chengliao took a central position. One of the younger disciples asked, "Brother Liao, what are you discussing today? Immortal Foundation?"

Li Chengliao replied, "You all come to me for answers, but there are only a few paths to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm in our family. If you want to find out how miraculous it is, you should just cultivate it yourself."

"Big Brother, you're being unreasonable!"

The girl beside him smiled, her round eyes sparkling and her eyebrows gracefully arched.

"Not many in our family managed to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. You're a direct descendant with exceptional talent, capable of succeeding in anything you cultivate. We may not be as gifted as you, so we listen for fun... How can we realistically hope to achieve it?" she remarked.

The other boys and girls nodded in agreement glumly. However, a child in the corner piped up, his voice clear and assertive.

"Sister Gong, what you said isn't necessarily true. My father told me that our great-great-grandfather didn't break through to Jade Capital Stage until he was over twenty, and he still managed to establish Boundless Ocean! Foundation Establishment isn't just about talent."

For this group of teenagers, achieving Foundation Establishment was a rare feat, a mark of a great master. The miracle tales of the immortal foundations were passed down through generations, growing more enigmatic with each retelling. Naturally, they all aspired to establish one.

Li Chengliao nodded, adopting the tone of an elder.

"Chenghui is right! Everyone should cultivate diligently. We're all disciples of the major sect and have entered Qingdu. Even if we cannot achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm, we must at least become Qi Cultivators at all costs. We cannot disgrace our lineages!"

The disciples responded with murmurs of agreement. Although a few teenagers exchanged competitive glances, the overall atmosphere among their generation remained harmonious.

Li Chengliao smiled at his brothers and sisters and continued, "I heard our clan has a new method called the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique, a Grade Four cultivation manual. After consuming the Long Marching Pheasant Flame spiritual qi, one would be able to establish an immortal foundation known as Pheasant Li March."

The girl named Li Minggong eagerly asked, "What's so special about it?"

"How should I know?" Li Chengliao replied, somewhat annoyed. The teenagers erupted into laughter, their eyes filled with longing as they began discussing the technique. Meanwhile, Li Chengyu fell into deep thought.

Standing beside Li Yuanjiao, Li Xijun remarked softly, "Not bad, they all conduct themselves properly... At least they've grown up in Qingdu Cave Dwelling and receive teachings every day."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly. His nephew, who was still standing nearby, added with a touch of regret, "It's a pity that although these children are far more talented than their parents, they still seem mediocre. Their chances of achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm are slim."

Li Xijun's words were tactful. However, without encountering any opportunities, these children were unlikely to reach even the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Yuanjiao hummed softly, a rare tenderness filling his eyes as he smiled and said, "In the past, my granduncle was also the most mediocre among his three surviving brothers, with only the hope of reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm. Who would have thought he would become so famous in Jiangnan today? As long as one possesses a spiritual orifice, there is always hope."

He paused before remarking, "It's a pity that the immortal mirror has never favored these children. They can be pillars of support, but never leaders."

Li Xijun lowered his gaze in silence. With a smile, Li Yuanjiao suggested, "Let's go down and have a look."

1. Ren is an ancient Chinese measurement unit. 1 ren = approximately 1.6 meters. ☜

Li Chengliao was busy picking up wooden weapons scattered on the ground when the lively chatter of his brothers and sisters suddenly fell silent. The quietness was so profound that one could hear a pin drop, with only Li Minggong's nervous voice breaking the stillness.

"Brother Liao... Brother Liao..." she called.

Li Chengliao looked up and saw a young man standing before him, dressed in white with a sword at his back, exuding an extraordinary aura.

The teenager's eyes immediately sparkled with excitement as he nervously exclaimed, "Liao'er greets Youngest Uncle!"

Li Xijun was momentarily taken aback, only now realizing that this child was the eldest son of Li Xicheng. He had seen him before, though the boy had not been named at birth. A decade had passed, and he could hardly recognize him.

"Your name is Li Chengliao?" he asked, slightly embarrassed before quickly introducing Li Yuanjiao. In a gentle voice, he said, "Come, Liao'er... Meet your granduncle."

Li Chengliao then noticed a middle-aged man standing beside Li Xijun. He had eyebrows that were close to each other above his sharp eyes and was clad in a simple black robe with a sword at his back.

Granduncle?!

Who else could be referred to as granduncle by Li Xijun so respectfully?

Upon seeing Li Yuanjiao's attire, Li Chengliao felt a surge of awe and excitement. He kneeled and bowed deeply, trembling slightly.

"Chengliao greets... Granduncle!"

The other teenagers, who had just raised their gazes, lowered their heads again, not daring to make eye contact. They bowed together and said in unison, "Junior greets Granduncle!"

Li Chengliao's gaze was fanatical, forcing Li Yuanjiao to look away slightly. He raised his palm gently, gesturing for everyone to stand up.

If Granduncle Tongya were here, these kids would be so overjoyed they'd lose their minds!

Despite his inner thoughts, Li Yuanjiao had always regarded his family members with kindness.

"Which lineage of the major sect are you all from?" he asked gently.

"Li Chengliao, eldest, directly from the second lineage!"

Li Chengliao spoke first, and the girl next to him, Li Minggong, the eldest girl in the group, added respectfully, "Li Minggong, the eldest sister, and granddaughter of Yuanwan from the first lineage."[1]

"Li Chenghui, grandson of Yuanyun from the second lineage."[2]

The twelve children introduced themselves in order of age. Li Yuanjiao nodded, calculating their ages. The most talented, Li Minggong and Li Chengyi, were about the same as Li Xicheng.

He gently encouraged them, "Cultivate diligently. There are many cultivation techniques available in the clan. Aside from a few that require spiritual qi that are too difficult to gather, you can read through them and choose the techniques you wish to practice."

The teenagers responded eagerly.

Li Yuanjiao glanced at the weapons scattered on the ground, which were mainly spears and swords, with very few bows.

"You can practice with any weapon you like; you don't have to limit yourselves to these three. We wish to have people wielding all sorts of different weapons. The clan can also acquire specific cultivation techniques for you from the market," he added.

"Have any of you ever killed anyone? Have you ever slain a demon?" he asked.

When he saw all the children shake their heads, Li Yuanjiao formulated a plan in his mind. He turned to Li Xijun and said, "Inform Xicheng that there are many Qi Cultivators in the family now. Tell the others not to kill the Embryonic Breathing Realm demons caught in various prefectures and towns... Send them over for the kids to train with."

"Understood," Li Xijun replied with a smile. The generation of Cheng and Ming did not seem scared; instead, they all looked eager for the new experience.

Li Yuanjiao paused before saying, "As for killing people... there will be plenty of opportunities for that in the future. There's no need to rush into it so early..."

Putting aside the direct descendants of the Li Family who had perished, there were now more than fifty guest cultivators who had died—some by demonic beast attacks, others at the hands of rogue cultivators and devil cultivators.

Although Jiangnan was calmer than the Eastern Sea, incidents of killing and robbery were still prevalent.

Li Yuanjiao instructed the children on their cultivation. Under Li Xijun's excited persuasion, he also reluctantly demonstrated the Jing Dragon King to the younger generation.

At first, Li Chengliao and the others cheered, but when the grayish-green serpent dragon bared its fangs and claws, fear gripped them instantly. They dropped their weapons and slumped to the ground with pale faces.

Rejecting Li Xijun's suggestion to divide his immortal foundation into snakes, shrimps, crabs, and fish to torment the kids from the Cheng and Ming generation, Li Yuanjiao departed with Li Xijun. They flew on clouds and mist, disappearing over the cave dwelling.

The children took a long time to calm down after the two left, but they were now more envious of the power of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

Li Chengliao's heart raced as he looked at his brothers and sisters beside him, all of them visibly excited.

"Come on, let's cultivate!" he urged.

Li Yuanjiao, observing Li Xijun's amused face, could not help but chuckle softly.

"You really are Qinghong's nephew... Both of you are the same when fooling around! What a handful."

He continued with a fond smile, "When she was a child, she insisted on using a spear to hook peaches, tricking Brother Yun into catching them. The peaches hit Brother Yun, causing him to cry loudly while she laughed joyfully, refusing to stop until Brother Xiu came to scold her."

Li Xijun smiled, clearly seeing the warmth in Li Yuanjiao's eyes. Since Yuanjiao was talking about Li Xijun's other elders, he merely listened and refrained from commenting.

After reminiscing for a moment, Li Yuanjiao snapped back to his senses and realized he had lost his composure. He returned to his usual serious demeanor, but his tone softened as he remarked, "The children are all good and very adorable."

Li Xijun cupped his fist and replied gently, "I've spoken with Brother Ming about Uncle Xuanxuan; he's been wanting to meet you."

"All right, I'll go and see him now," Li Yuanjiao replied simply.

Li Xijun nodded and left, heading to Mount Wutu first to inform Li Ximing, ensuring that Li Yuanjiao would not walk in on any embarrassing situation.

Li Yuanjiao was fully aware of the situation but chose not to talk about it. Instead, he waited for the right moment before slowly descending onto Mount Wutu.

On Mount Wutu...

Li Ximing had already tidied up the place and was waiting for his arrival. Once the uncle and nephew were seated, Li Yuanjiao listened as Li Ximing respectfully recounted the events.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝙬𝙚𝓫𝒏𝓸𝓿𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝓶

He resisted the urge to ask, "Did Xijun teach you that?" and spoke in a deep voice, "That's not a bad idea... Hengzhu Gate has been established for many years. What did your grandfather say?"

Li Ximing quickly replied, "Xijun asked him, and the old man insisted on finishing the talismans for the next two years before leaving. It will take some time."

"As long as he's willing to go," Li Yuanjiao said.

He looked Li Ximing up and down before nodding in approval.

"Not bad. You're almost at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm."

Li Ximing quickly explained, "I could have made a breakthrough, but I feel that I've been progressing too quickly lately. I worry that my foundation isn't stable, so I haven't attempted to break through yet."

"Hmm."

Li Yuanjiao nodded. Given that Li Ximing had received the teachings from both the Xiao and Li families in his cultivation, Li Yuanjiao believed that he would not make such a simple mistake.

As he glanced around the courtyard, he noticed a painting hanging in the corner, mostly completed. It depicted Li Ximing seated in a white robe, his expression calm and serene.

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly and commented, "That painting is very lifelike."

Li Ximing nodded awkwardly, prompting Li Yuanjiao to turn to him and ask, "Do you like it?"

Li Ximing was taken aback by the question and replied, "It's just a painting..."

With a sigh, Li Yuanjiao turned and left, hands clasped behind his back.

1. This is the first time Li Yuanwan has been mentioned. He is the child of Li Xuanxuan and one of his concubines. So Li Minggong is Li Changhu's lineage. ☜

2. Li Chenghui is the child of the child of Li Yuanyun and one of his concubines. So he is from Tongya's lineage. Likewise, Li Chengyou and Li Chengchu are also children of the child of Li Yuanyun with ANOTHER concubine. These children with grandmothers who are concubines are all from minor sect. ☜




# Chapter 498: Han Shizhen

Li Yuanjiao had been cultivating on Mount Qingdu for more than half a year now, and though his cultivation had improved, he was still far from breaking through to the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. After all, the Foundation Establishment Realm was unlike the Qi Cultivation Realm; it was common for breakthroughs to take decades.

"Father still hasn't set off... He always worries so much and insists on making sure everything is well before he's willing to leave," Li Yuanjiao murmured to himself with a soft sigh.

Li Xuanxuan has been preparing for more than half a year, yet still has not departed. Li Xijun did not rush him and just waited patiently instead. After all, collecting cold water was not urgent, and pushing too hard on the matter might rouse suspicion.

With Li Qinghong in seclusion and no one else guarding the family, Li Yuanjiao could not afford to immerse himself too deeply in his cultivation. He would occasionally emerge and practice his spells and swordsmanship.

While reading a sword technique manual, he saw Li Wushao descending from the sky, riding the wind and all clad in black.

After Li Wushao had gratefully received the Clear Cloud Elk Fruit from Li Yuanjiao, he consumed it before resuming his cultivation. Two dark shadows had already appeared underneath his black robe. Likely, within a year or so, the two hooks would eventually grow out.

"Family Head, two people landed in front of the mountain. They say they're from the Han Family of Dongliu Island," Li Wushao reported.

Li Yuanjiao was slightly taken aback as he asked, "The Han Family of Dongliu...?"

He had heard of the Han Family before. The Foundation Establishment Realm demon creatures the Li Family used in their rituals now were often captured around Dongliu Island. Li Yuanjiao had also spent some time on the island before.

The Han Family of Dongliu was an old clan, similar to the Yuan Family. They had many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and established a strong presence in the Eastern Sea.

Knowing their reputation, Li Yuanjiao felt it appropriate to receive them personally. He smoothened his clothes and flew out of the cave dwelling.

In the courtyard stood two figures, both Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. The leader was a young cultivator with an unassuming appearance and simply dressed, while behind him stood a tall, broad-shouldered man.

Li Xijun accompanied the young man, smiling and chatting with him amiably. They seemed to be having a pleasant time.

Upon seeing the tough-looking man, Li Yuanjiao quickly understood the situation. He stepped forward, cupping his fist as he introduced himself.

"Li Yuanjiao of Qingdu greets you, fellow Daoist."

The young man's eyes flicked over Li Yuanjiao's face as he responded, "Ah, my apologies for not noticing. I am Han Shizhen of Dongliu, the young master of the Han Family. Greetings, fellow Daoist!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded in acknowledgment and invited them to sit. Han Shizhen smiled warmly and spoke politely.

"A few days ago, my clan uncle fell seriously ill, and my clan brother visited your esteemed family to seek medicine but offended your family in the process. I have come today specifically to apologize. I brought a few small gifts, which I hope you will accept."

He then gestured to the tough-looking man and explained, "My clan brother has always had a bit of a temper. He had spoken rudely due to the urgency of a life-or-death situation... I hope you can forgive him."

It turned out that the tough-looking man was the same Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator who had come to request medicine a few days ago. Back then, his rudeness and arrogance had triggered Li Qinghong.

Now, however, he hung his head and apologized repeatedly.

Since both parties were from prominent clans, they would not hold a grudge over such a minor incident. Li Yuanjiao waved it off, saying simply, "No need to apologize. I understand that you were eager to obtain the medicine. It's no problem."

Han Shizhen then handed over a jade box. Li Yuanjiao gestured for Li Xijun to accept it and then asked, "If I may ask, how's that elder from your esteemed family...?"

"Ah..."

Han Shizhen shook his head slightly and continued, "He didn't make it. Despite taking many life-extending herbs, his injuries were too severe. In the end, his immortal foundation collapsed, and he passed on."

Li Yuanjiao, seeing that the two men were not dressed in white mourning attire, had assumed their elder man had managed to recover and was even ready to offer his congratulations.

Realizing his mistake, he quickly apologized.

"My condolences..."
𝘧𝓇ℯ𝑒𝓌𝑒𝑏𝓃𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝒸ℴ𝓂

"It's alright. Though my clan uncle passed, he brought back treasures that are of far greater value to our family than a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. In a way, it was a good thing!" Han Shizhen replied with a soft smile.

Li Yuanjiao and his nephew paused momentarily at this unexpected statement. Sensing their discomfort, Han Shizhen quickly explained, not wanting to make a negative impression on them.

"This is a custom in our Eastern Sea, which may be a little different from those here on the mainland... I apologize if I have caused any discomfort!" he explained hastily.

Li Yuanjiao nodded, understanding that Han Shizhen would not have traveled all this way just to apologize. He waited patiently for his guests to reveal the real purpose of their visit.

Sure enough, after the brief exchange of pleasantries, Han Shizhen got to the point, asking, "How many Wanglin Blossoms does your esteemed family produce each year?"

So, that's what this is about!

Li Yuanjiao immediately grasped the situation. Realizing he held the upper hand in this discussion, he relaxed slightly and answered in a steady tone, "It blooms once every three years, yielding fourteen flowers each time."

"Perfect!" Han Shizhen nodded happily then asked, "How much do you sell this flower for on the mainland?"

Li Yuanjiao had already guessed where this conversation was headed and replied calmly, "The price has risen in recent years—around two Spirit Stones per flower."

"Ah!"

Upon hearing this, Han Shizhen, who had just lifted his jade cup, placed it back down heavily without even tasting a sip of the tea.

"That price is far too low, fellow Daoist! We are talking about a life-saving item here!" he remarked regretfully.

He leaned in, advising, "The mainland is peaceful and prosperous, with no major calamities to speak of. The rogue cultivators may be ignorant, but surely you and I, who belong to prestigious clans, know better. That so-called devil plague is nothing but a farce!"

Han Shizhen continued, "It's just a way for the three sects and seven gates to deal with the inflated price of blood qi by the sects in the Eastern Sect! How can something as precious as Wanglin Blossom be sold in such a bright and peaceful land?"

Bright and peaceful...

Li Yuanjiao's lips twitched at the description but his attention was quickly drawn to Han Shizhen's words. He mused softly, "A way to deal with inflated prices..."

Han Shizhen sighed deeply.

"Exactly! In recent years, the demand from overseas demons for sustenance has surged, driving up the prices of blood qi, resentment qi, souls, spirit, and water. The Eastern Sea cultivators barely have enough to use themselves, how could we possibly afford to export these resources to the mainland?

"So the three sects and seven gates loosened their control over the seaports, allowing rogue cultivators from overseas to enter. They then orchestrated the so-called devil plague—using their high-level devil cultivators to slaughter mortals and rogue cultivators alike. This allowed them to eliminate opposition, consolidate their power, and still reap their rewards."

As Han Shizhen spoke animatedly, he discreetly watched for any changes in Li Yuanjiao's expression. Li Yuanjiao simply sipped his tea and nodded along, listening carefully.

"In this way, the sects feast, the clans sip the soup, and they maintain the moral high ground. I've heard that such righteousness is highly valued on the mainland..." Han Shizhen chuckled before adding with a playful grin, "Your esteemed family must have consumed quite a few devil cultivators over the years, right? I hear everyone earned a lot; even an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator was worth more than ten Spirit Stones... We're truly envious!"

"We've indeed killed a few devil cultivators," Li Yuanjiao replied with a small smile.

Han Shizhen glanced at Li Xijun, noting that the young man was also nodding and smiling, looking even more natural than Li Yuanjiao.

This confirmed Han Shizhen's suspicions.

The Li Family must have some serious backing in Azure Pond. Li Yuanjiao is difficult to read, but Li Xijun is young and clearly knows more than he lets on.

With renewed enthusiasm, Han Shizhen continued, "That's exactly what I mean! The spiritual energy in your region is concentrated in those immortal mountains, while the rest of the land is filled with mortals... How many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators could there possibly be? How many are truly fighting to the death? You should really consider exporting these Wanglin Blossoms to the Eastern Sea!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded, following Han Shizhen's line of thought. He asked calmly, "And how do you propose we divide the profits?"

Han Shizhen grinned.

"Now we're talking! Ten Spirit Stones per flower... I take seventy, and you get thirty!"
𝕗𝕣𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝚋𝚗𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹.𝚌𝕠𝚖

Li Yuanjiao and Li Xijun were both stunned and shocked at the notion of reselling the flowers at five times its original price. Li Yuanjiao remained silent, but Li Xijun immediately protested, "Senior, that's far too greedy!"

Han Shizhen shook his head confidently and said, "You can certainly try selling it yourself, but if word gets out today, your esteemed family could be attacked and destroyed tomorrow. The Eastern Sea doesn't deal in pleasantries or negotiations!"

"My family takes on the risk of selling this spirit item, drawing the attention of every covetous eye. I wouldn't dare to be involved if my family didn't have some standing in the Eastern Sea!"

Li Yuanjiao, who had been to the Eastern Sea and was already calculating the risks, quickly countered his offer.

"Fifty-fifty split."

"Sixty-forty; that's the most I can offer. I don't like haggling—whatever we decide will be finalized," Han Shizhen replied firmly.

Li Yuanjiao nodded and conceded, "Fine, but I have a condition."

Han Shizhen looked at him intently before saying, "Go ahead, fellow Daoist."

Li Yuanjiao remained calm as he explained, "I want forty percent of the proceeds from the sale of Wanglin Blossoms. You can't pay me four Spirit Stones and then resell these flowers at an inflated price."

Han Shizhen was momentarily stunned as if Li Yuanjiao had read his mind. Laughing to cover his embarrassment, he said, "All right, all right! Fellow Daoist, you don't seem like a typical mainland cultivator... Your thinking is more like ours in the Eastern Sea!"

They discussed the details for a while longer, eventually agreeing on the quantity for the next year.

"Remember, these flowers must not hear crying—if they do, they will wither. They also must not come into contact with gold or jade," Li Yuanjiao reminded.

Han Shizhen nodded, indicating that he understood, and after exchanging some polite words, he asked abruptly, "By the way... is your sister, Li Qinghong, married?"

By now, Li Yuanjiao had gotten used to Han Shizhen's straightforwardness, and answered bluntly, "My little sister follows a unique cultivation path, and she is not able to marry. I hope you understand."

"I apologize for my rudeness," Han Shizhen replied calmly, nodding slightly.

Li Yuanjiao took a sip of tea and lowered his voice to ask, "Fellow Daoist Han... Are there any prominent mainland clans setting up branches in the Eastern Sea?"

During his visit to the Eastern Sea, Li Yuanjiao had tried searching for such clans. However, given the dominance of the three sects and seven gates, these clans could not openly establish themselves overseas, and likely operated under different names.

Now that Han Shizhen, a knowledgeable local, was here, it was the perfect opportunity to ask.

"Of course there are," Han Shizhen responded with a casual shrug.

"But not many. Most are Purple Mansion Realm immortal clans. Even if ordinary clans have enough Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, they rarely manage to secure a foothold overseas... At most, they only have a presence in the market."

He continued, "The Eastern Sea is quite different from the mainland. You can't grow Spirit Paddies on the islands, and danger lurks everywhere. The markets are tightly controlled by the three sects and seven gates. Once a clan establishes power overseas, they're no longer affiliated with the sects or gates. The three sects and seven gates aren't foolish—they wouldn't let you come back."

Han Shizhen glanced at Li Yuanjiao and shook his head gently.

"Although there are some leeways and the three sects and seven gates aren't overly strict, the benefits of doing such are minimal. Many clans keep a branch overseas as a precaution, but very few actually invest the effort to manage it carefully."

Li Yuanjiao nodded thoughtfully as he gathered this information from Han Shizhen. After answering all his questions, Han Shizhen bid farewell and left with his companion.

Li Yuanjiao escorted them out of the territory and returned to the mountain with a satisfied smile.

Li Xijun congratulated him and remarked, "With this additional income, our family will have a surplus of close to twenty Spirit Stones annually! Managing the family affairs will become much more convenient now."

"Yes!" Li Yuanjiao agreed, nodding approvingly. Then, with a more serious tone, he added, "That bit about the devil plague... It's quite intriguing. It seems to reflect the views of the overseas clans on the matter. We should keep it in mind."

"True. Even though the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the mainland collude with each other, they're not entirely unified. The devil plague is being driven by Azure Pond, but there are many factions at play, each with its own agenda," Li Xijun replied with a nod.

The two continued their discussion for a while longer. Then Li Xijun suddenly said, "Granduncle is finally almost done with drawing his talismans..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in understanding and instructed, "I'll need you to take care of Granduncle's matters. Once you've completed your breakthrough, you can set off."

"Yes, Second Uncle, don't worry about it!" Li Xijun responded readily before heading off to cultivate in seclusion in Qingdu Cave Dwelling.

Left alone in the courtyard, Li Yuanjiao sipped his tea and reflected solemnly to himself, Qinghong will soon emerge from her seclusion... and Kongheng is now as powerful as a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Those two will only be gone for less than half a year, so nothing should go wrong...

He sat for a few moments, gently setting down the jade cup before making up his mind.

Although it's only half a year, I should accompany them with the spirit mist to be safe. We have yet to identify any exceptional talent among the generation of Cheng and Ming. Xijun is the bridge between the older and younger generations... he must be protected at all costs.

With his decision now made, he called Li Wushao over, gave him a few instructions, and entrusted him with the task of looking after the family. He then pulled out the sword manual and began reading again, awaiting the moment when Li Xijun and Li Xuanxuan were ready to set off.

————

After leaving Mount Qingdu, Han Shizhen and his companions headed north. The tough-looking man behind him was the first to speak up.

"Young Master, it seems like the Li Family is interested in establishing a foothold overseas."

Han Shizhen nodded, replying softly, "It's hardly surprising. The Li Family has backings in Azure Pond and can easily access the Eastern Sea... It's only natural they'd think of this. Just think about how many forces in the Eastern Sea are from the mainland!"

He continued, "With the Wanyu Sword Gate, Pure Dao Gate, and Crimson Rock Island battling over the Green Pine Temple Ruins, it's a good time to venture into the sea. If I were Li Yuanjiao, I'd also be thinking about the same thing."

The burly man nodded in agreement but expressed some concern, "I just hope his family is sensible enough not to settle too close to us... We've built a friendship, but we don't want that to turn sour."

Han Shizhen shook his head, answering decisively, "Absolutely not. Li Yuanjiao strikes me as a cautious and discreet man. If his family chooses to establish themselves there, they'll find a remote, sparsely populated island. They'd rather endure hardship and remain hidden than risk exposure."

The man sighed and remarked, "This poor and desolate place... I wonder when our family will be able to secure a foothold on the mainland."

"Once our ancestor reaches the Purple Mansion Realm!" Han Shizhen replied with a confident smile.

"It's not impossible... The mainland is peaceful and prosperous, with the three sects maintaining order. Who wouldn't envy that? Look at Tang Yuanwu and Chang Xiaozi—they came from overseas, and now they've joined the Seven Gates. Maybe someday the Dongliu Gate will be added, and our Han Family will rise."

Han Shizhen added, "As for the Li Family, they're a local power. It's wise to maintain good relations with them. If our family ever manages to establish itself onshore, we'll need the support of these clans... And if our ancestor fails to break through, we can at least call upon a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to help guard the island."

"Yes, Young Master! You are truly farsighted," the man praised him respectfully.

Han Shizhen ignored the flattery, his thoughts elsewhere.

"The situation with the Green Pine Temple Ruins is growing more complicated... I just hope the three sects don't intervene. It would be best if the Wanyu Sword Gate, Pure Dao Gate, and Crimson Rock Island—the three Purple Mansion Realm forces—continue to clash with one another. It would make life much easier for us."




# Chapter 500: Arrival of News

Qingdu Cave Dwelling.

The tightly shut stone door slowly creaked open as Li Qinghong stepped out, her aura steady and strong. The once-vivid lightning that had surrounded her was now more subdued, with only faint traces of electricity flickering at the edges of her hair and robes.

During her seclusion, Li Qinghong had managed to stabilize her cultivation. The dazzling brilliance that had marked her recent breakthrough had dimmed, making it harder to immediately discern her immortal foundation.

Li Yuanjiao had already informed her that he would accompany Li Xuanxuan and Li Xijun to the Hengzhu Dao Gate in Hengdong Prefecture with the protection of the profound spirit mist, leaving Li Qinghong to oversee matters at home.

She flew for a while before descending gracefully, her jade boots lightly touching down on the ground as she rode on purple lightning. In the central hall, Li Xicheng was busy at his desk, surrounded by two piles of letters.

As soon as Li Qinghong entered, the people in the hall immediately kneeled in respect. Li Xicheng also quickly stood and greeted her respectfully.

"Auntie, you've emerged from seclusion already! The thunder altar is already under construction. We are sixty percent through the process and should be able to complete it within a year."

"Good," Li Qinghong replied kindly. Her immortal foundation, the Profound Thunderpool, had the potential to channel thunder and draw down lightning, but its effectiveness had yet to be proven. She had therefore ordered the construction of a high platform as a testing ground for her abilities.

The altar was a complex endeavor, requiring engraved array formations, spirit items, and the crafting of thirty-six hexagonal bronze pieces. Even for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, it was no small task.

Fortunately, the Li Family had ample manpower. Li Qinghong only needed to engrave the necessary array formations while Li Xicheng took care of the rest.

Li Xicheng retrieved two small letters from the table and said, "The Jade Court Guards from Xu State and Zhao State have sent news for the family. Please review them, Auntie."

With a wave of her slender hand, the letters unfolded before Li Qinghong.

The first was from Zhao State. It reported that Chu Yi, the Li Fire Spear, had traveled north across Zhao State, where he eliminated three Jie noble families, razed six temples of various sizes, and managed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm despite being pursued. He then retreated to a peak in Luoxia, where he continued his cultivation.

Li Qinghong was stunned by the news. For most Foundation Establishment cultivators, breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm required painstaking preparation. One needed to find an ideal location to enter seclusion, gather numerous spirit items to create array formations and wait for the right alignment of heaven and earth's spirit energies with one's immortal foundation.

Even after such meticulous planning, success demanded years of seclusion with the protection of powerful formations and potent elixirs.

Chu Yi's breakthrough seems almost effortless... He has ascended to the Purple Mansion Realm after just a few months of seclusion. The ease with which he accomplished this was astonishing—it is virtually unheard of!

He has only taken about... only ten years to reach the Purple Mansion Realm... To break through so quickly... He must be the reincarnation of a Golden Core Realm cultivator!

Chu Yi's swift ascension from Foundation Establishment to the Purple Mansion made it almost certain to the world that he was the reincarnation of a Golden Core Realm cultivator.

The three Jie nobles and the six temples he destroyed were mere pawns and ignorant commoners who had no understanding of the true situation, pushed forward by Buddhist cultivators.

"Ten years... yes, that's only doable for a former Golden Core Realm cultivator," Li Qinghong murmured quietly with a small frown.

However, the letter offered no details about Chu Yi's immortal foundation or his divine abilities, likely because such information was impossible to uncover. Li Qinghong could not help but feel a twinge of disappointment.

Mount Luoxia and Jiangnan rarely have any contact. Now that Chu Yi has entered the mountain, he must be reclaiming his Golden Core's Fruition Attainment and is unlikely to return.

As for the clans in Yufu Prefecture that had been destroyed and the forces that had been eradicated, no one paid them much mind. Li Qinghong quickly scanned through the letter, memorized the key points, and then turned her attention to the next one.

This one reported that a group of devil cultivators had appeared in the barren mountains near the great river in the north, occupying several small hills. Initially, this seemed inconsequential. If not for a rogue cultivator who had escaped from the area, the Li Family might not have even known about it.

The rogue cultivator shared that most of the devil cultivators were not particularly strong, except for one that wielded a blood-colored mirror. Additional details were appended at the end of the letter.

Li Qinghong's eyes narrowed as she wondered aloud, "A blood mirror? Zhang Huaide?!"

Li Xicheng nodded and replied, "According to the rogue cultivator's description, that seems to be him!"

During the Devil Plague, a group of devil cultivators, including Zhang Huaide and Qiu Ji, had come from the west. They had killed Tian Youdao, injured Li Xuanxuan and Xu Gongming before they fled.

Zhang Huaide, who seemed to have powerful connections, had escaped unscathed, using his blood mirror artifact and an escape spell.

Li Qinghong did not particularly care about Zhang Huaide. Qiu Ji was the one who had killed Li Yuanyun, her younger brother, and nearly killed Li Xuanxuan. Her hatred for him ran deep.

"How strong is he now?" she asked in a low voice.

"It's said that he has reached the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. All of the devil cultivators are at the Qi Cultivation Realm, with most of them in the middle or late stages," Li Xicheng replied, his expression tense.

While he was trying to think of a way to dissuade his aunt, Li Qinghong's expression had already turned pensive.

Why does Zhang Huaide have to return just when Big Brother and half of the family's fighting force are away?

Despite the hatred in her heart, Li Qinghong knew this was likely not a coincidence. She took a deep breath and composed herself before instructing softly, "This is too strange. Send someone to investigate."

"Understood!" Li Xicheng replied promptly, relieved by her calmness.

Li Qinghong added, "Find out their exact location. I'll have Wushao go and investigate further. Zhang Huaide has an unusual backing—he could be a spy for the three sects. There's something odd about him lingering here."

Li Xicheng responded respectfully. Before leaving on the wind, Li Qinghong repeated her instructions.

"Be sure to get to the bottom of this! It's too much of a coincidence for that rogue cultivator to come to our doorstep at this time... Do not trust his story too easily."
𝒻𝓇𝑒𝘦𝘸𝑒𝒷𝓃ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝘮

Li Xicheng nodded, watching her depart before returning to his seat. He opened the account book and glanced at Dou Yi, who was standing at the side of the room. In a low voice, he remarked, "181 jin... Is this all the Ni Water Cold Iron we've collected this year?"

Along with his gray hair, Dou Yi now looked a lot more mature and reliable than he was in the past.

"Yes, Young Master. This is all of it," he replied with a nod.

"Alright," Li Xicheng said, waving his hand to dismiss him kindly.

As Dou Yi left, Chen Mufeng stepped forward. Li Xicheng remarked softly, "This amount of Ni Water Cold Iron doesn't match the figures reported from the ore vein by An Zheyan. Send the Jade Court Guards to investigate this matter discreetly. If they uncover anything, report directly to me first."

Chen Mufeng, a trusted ally for many years, replied in a deep voice, "This seems like a foolish method to embezzle resources. The ore vein reserves can be checked easily. If the quantity mined doesn't match the reported figures, it's clear there's a discrepancy... How could they hide it?"

The Li Family possessed the Earthly Court Detection Technique, which made tracking the changes in ore veins straightforward. Most clans like the Xiao Family relied heavily on this method as it allowed them to entrust their ore veins to their subordinate families for mining, leaving no room for deceit.

Li Xicheng shook his head, explaining, "The official report says the ore vein produced 181 jin, but I secretly sent people to check the warehouse—it actually holds 190 jin of iron, so no one has taken anything yet."

"They must be testing me since I'm new at managing the family. If I made any drastic moves, they'd simply recount the stock and correct the amount to 190 jin. In that case, at worst, I could only accuse them of carelessness, and they'd likely scapegoat a minor sect cultivator from accounting while they were trying to throw me off."

After having assisted Li Yuanping for nearly a decade, Li Xicheng has gained a great deal of experience. Though his capabilities remained to be seen, he understood the covert politics at play.

He thought for a moment before adding, "You can investigate first and report back once you have news. Auntie's matter is more pressing, so we can delay this for now."

Chen Mufeng accepted his task and left. Li Xicheng stood in contemplation for a moment before riding the wind up to Mount Qingdu. After making a big around, he gently landed in an unassuming courtyard.

He knocked on the door and entered. Inside, Li Yuanping was seated on a stone bench, carefully recording something with a brush in his hand.

Though he appeared fine, his hand trembled slightly, and he was struggling to hold the brush steadily.

As soon as Li Xicheng stepped forward, Li Yuanping glanced up and asked, "How do you plan to handle it?"

Li Xicheng hesitated for a moment before replying, "About that... a minor sect cultivator was used as a scapegoat. I'll have the minor sect investigate this. Many of the brothers listen to me, so it shouldn't be too difficult to uncover who altered the numbers in the report..."

Li Yuanping shook his head and spoke softly, "But you will only find yet another scapegoat. I will teach you one final lesson..."

"This whole incident is a test—to gauge your preferences and to probe your limits. All the forces under your command share in the benefits and silently acquiesce to support this. That minor sect cultivator was just a convenient scapegoat for them... If you rely on them for the investigation, you'll expose your closeness and trust toward the branch families. Whether you rely on the Jade Court Guards, the Dou Family, or peak offices, your inclinations become clear."

He continued in a low voice, "The greatest danger here is that the interests of the cultivators under your command align against yours. On the surface, the minor sect appears as the victim, but in reality, it is complicit. The only truly innocent party is the cultivator that had been made a scapegoat."

Li Xicheng listened intently, only to see Li Yuanping smile coldly before saying, "All you need to do is send someone to the warehouse and quietly adjust the 190 jin to match the reported 181 jin. Once the numbers align, this coalition of opportunists will collapse under their own weight!"

Li Xicheng was stunned, but then realization dawned upon him. He nodded eagerly, a smile spreading across his face as he exclaimed in delight, "That's brilliant!"

He nodded repeatedly, murmuring to himself, "That will really stir the pot! The minor sect will panic and they'll start suspecting each other, wondering which faction turned the false report into reality. Inevitably, they'll start pointing fingers and tear each other apart. All I'll need to do is sit back and arbitrate—suppress the strong, support the weak, and maintain the balance of power..."

Li Yuanping did not respond, continuing to write in silence. With his plan set, Li Xicheng bowed deeply and took his leave.

Li Yuanping was counting the days as he meticulously updated the Family History. After a short while, he noticed Li Qinghong arrive, her form subtly crackling with electricity as she sat down beside him gracefully. She pursed her vermillion lips and simply sat in silence.

The two siblings faced each other quietly, with the early spring breeze gently sweeping through the courtyard. Li Yuanping had never spent much time with this elder sister as they had never grown up together.

After a long pause, he finally broke the silence by commenting, "There's indeed something suspicious about Zhang Huaide. Please be patient, Big Sister... You mustn't act impulsively."

Li Qinghong merely replied softly, "I know. I've been patient for so many years... I'm just afraid that if I keep holding back, I'll eventually forget about this resentment."

Li Yuanping snorted, setting his brush down.

"WelI... Isn't that why we record history?"

Li Qinghong glanced at the sheets in front of him.

"Xicheng may not be the strongest, but he's trying his best. I've seen how much he's changed over the past ten years. He's a completely different person now," she remarked.

Li Yuanping nodded in agreement.

"I noticed."

————

Li Qinghong had spent several days practicing with her spear on the mountain. Before she could uncover anything about the devil cultivators in the north, a deer demon arrived from the south and landed at the foot of the mountain politely. He waited for An Zheyan and the others to inform the family about his arrival first before entering the mountain.

The deer demon was looking for Li Yuanjiao. Since he was away from home, Li Qinghong was the one to receive him.

The deer demon deer kneeled on all fours before her and, in a human voice, said, "Exalted Immortal, my master has discovered a clue regarding the Blood Sun Fruit. Please follow me to the mountain to discuss the details with him."

"Very well," Li Qinghong replied with a smile and a nod. She summoned Li Wushao from the lake, instructing him to take care of the household before following the deer demon into the mountain.

Li Yuanjiao had mentioned to Li Qinghong about the Foundation Establishment Realm deer demon named Luken before. Hence, she knew that he had picked a mountain that was not particularly tall and set up a demon den on its northern slope. The foot of the mountain was flat, so many deer had been relocated there.

When Li Qinghong and the lesser demon reached the cave, Luken himself came out to greet them. He had brown hair, black eyes, and was slightly taken aback by the sight of her.

"You are...?"
𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

"I am Li Qinghong. My brother, Li Yuanjiao, is currently away from home, so I've come in his place," she replied with a smile.

The deer demon blinked and nodded.

"I am Luken. It's a pleasure to meet you, fellow Daoist."

Without beating around the bush further, Luken cupped his fist and explained, "Your brother asked me to track down a treasured panacea known as Blood Sun Fruit. Now that I've found a lead, I wanted to inform your esteemed family."

Li Qinghong nodded.

"I've received multiple reports. A fellow Daoist from the southern slope once wrote to me, claiming to have seen a tiger demon from Mount Quanwu Demon Den possessing this fruit. The description in the letter matches what we know of the Blood Sun Fruit... I believe it to be genuine."

Li Qinghong simply nodded in agreement without saying a word.

Luken shook his sleeves and continued, "That tiger demon holds some sway within the Quanwu Demon Den, though it isn't an important figure and is often bullied."

"Better to act sooner than later. Why don't we ride the wind to Mount Quanwu and seize the panacea before circumstances change?" he suggested.

"Let's seize the spirit fruit first, and if possible, kill the demon. If we manage to slay it, all the better. If not, no harm is done. If we can't take it by force, we'll try to buy it," Luken spoke matter-of-factly.

Li Qinghong had no choice but to nod in agreement. After all, dealing with demon creatures was different; they acted openly and without pretense.

"What is the cultivation level of this tiger demon?" she asked.

"Mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm," Luken replied, noticing the concern on her face.

"But don't worry, fairy. He's just a demon general without a proper Dao lineage. He hasn't learned the spells of the human race and relies solely on his raw demon power," he explained.

He smiled reassuringly and continued, "Give it a month, and you'll see for yourself."

Li Qinghong nodded. Sensing the profound thunder swirling in the thunder pool within her Qihai acupoint, she felt confident in her own strength.

"Lead the way, please," she responded politely.

With that, she followed Luken, and the two soared up into the clouds.

As they flew on, Luken seemed to be mulling over her age and sighed, "The legacy of your esteemed family is truly remarkable... The cultivation speed of you and your elder brother is astonishing, even compared to other clans. It makes us old-timers, who've been cultivating for hundreds of years, feel ashamed."

Li Qinghong offered a few modest words in return. Luken then said, "Which Dao foundation have you cultivated? Since we'll be fighting together soon, we should get to know each other's abilities first."

He activated his mana, and a pair of large antlers appeared on his head. His voice grew deeper and more resonant while the demonic wind he summoned was fresh and filled with renewed vitality.

"Mine is Lingyun Wood. It allows me to heal, control qi, nurture spirit plants, cultivate earth veins, and even transform into plants..." he explained.

As soon as he revealed his immortal foundation, his speed on the wind quickened significantly.

Li Qinghong nodded lightly, and a crackle of purple lightning appeared beneath her feet. Her speed increased even further, her jade armor flashing with violet sparks as she replied softly, "Profound Thunderpool, I can wield thunder and lightning to eliminate demons and suppress evil."




# Chapter 502: Obtaining The Fruit

Although Li Yuanjiao had mentioned this deer demon to her before, this was the first time Li Qinghong had met the deer demon. Not wanting to reveal too much to him, she kept the explanation of her abilities short.

Realization dawned upon Luken as he said solemnly, "Ah, so Fairy is the Li Family's thunder cultivator... Please excuse my rudeness!"

His attitude became much more respectful as he politely said, "Your Profound Thunderpool is the nemesis of the tiger demon's Hurricane Ghost Yin... It is as good as caught already."

Li Qinghong slowed down to keep pace with the deer demon.

"Is it really that easy to deal with the Quanwu Demon Den...?"

Luken nodded and explained, "Yue State is unlike the southern border and the Eastern Sea. Mount Quanwu or Quanwu Demon Den is called Mount Zuiliu by the demonic creatures in the southern border."[1]

He then added slowly, "Quanwu was originally the residence of a Purple Mansion Realm demon king. This demon was once the mount of a Golden Core Realm cultivator and had some influence over the southern border and Jiangnan. He lived in Quanwu... Whenever a demon den was destroyed in the southern border, the demon king of Quanwu would entice the suffering demons to Quanwu with pills and elixirs."

"At that time, Dongli Immortal Sect was still around. Yue State had four sects and twelve gates. If a disciple needed to find a mount, kill a demon, practice spells, or refine a dharma artifact, they would go to Mount Quanwu. Later, the demon king disappeared, and the mountain gradually declined after being replaced by Dali Demon Den. Nevertheless, there are still demons seeking refuge on Mount Quanwu from time to time... It became the place where the demons that escaped from the southern border stayed."

After hearing this explanation, Li Qinghong was not surprised one bit and merely remarked, "Ah... so they're demons that have escaped from the southern border. I guess The Azure Pond Sect is leaving them be because this is what they want."

"Yes," Luken smiled, feeling a little emotional as he said, "That place is also a treasure trove. The Azure Pond Sect deliberately kept it, waiting for these demons to escape and take out the treasures. No matter how they are circulated, they will eventually fall into the hands of the three sects, seven gates, and clans."

"Besides, if they catch an important demon, they can use it as a bargaining chip to threaten the southern border. At worst, they can make it into a spirit beast... There are just too many benefits, so they have been secretly supporting it," he added.

Li Qinghong frowned and whispered, "Then doesn't that mean that place is the backyard of the Azure Pond Sect? If we kill the tiger demon, I guess we'll have to take care of things within the sect too..."

Luken was momentarily taken aback, then waved his hand dismissively.

"No worries, I've already investigated and made sure that this tiger demon is a nobody. Otherwise, I wouldn't dare bring you there, Fairy..."

He then grumbled to himself inwardly, How could I not investigate first? Your Li Family has backing in Azure Pond Sect, so there's a way to resolve matters even if you offend someone. I'm just an insignificant deer demon; I can't afford to make enemies!

Li Qinghong considered the implications for a moment and thought, If we can rob it, we won't kill it. It's best to avoid more trouble...

Both of them began discussing significant events from recent years and found the conversation to be enlightening. Ahead of them, Mount Quanwu soon came into view.

While Mount Quanwu was not particularly tall, it was vast and imposing, located near the Mushroom Forest Plain, as well as the Cangwu and Helin Prefectures. Surrounded by a large plain, the mountains stood out prominently, concealing many demons within their depths and making them hard to detect.

As the deer demon led her into the mountain, they wound around until they reached an inconspicuous peak. As soon as he descended, he was surprised.

The cave entrance was wide open, and it was dark and foreboding inside. After scanning with his spiritual sense, Luken said awkwardly, "Fairy, this tiger demon is quite cautious. He's likely moved to a new cave and isn't here anymore!"

"Huh...?"

Li Qinghong was surprised too.

However, Luken rolled his sleeves up and said, "Don't worry; just watch me."

He landed, listened attentively, and conversed with the surrounding trees for a while. After walking more than ten li, they spotted a mountain persimmon tree hidden among the vines with yellow fruits hanging from its branches.

Luken performed a hand seal, and almost instantly, the fruits jumped off from the branches one by one and chatted for a moment. With a smile, the deer demon turned to Li Qinghong and said, "Fairy, the tiger demon has gone north."

"Good!" Li Qinghong praised, her gaze shifting to the yellow mountain persimmon's branches and leaves. A rustling noise ensued.

Luken listened for a moment and then relayed the message to her with a smile, "She said she is thirty-seven years away from gaining sentience and begs Fairy to spare her life and a hundred years of hard work..."

Li Qinghong had indeed considered bringing the spirit mountain persimmon back with her. Hearing Luken's message, she paused in surprise.

"I can't believe it has intelligence! Fellow Daoist, you can communicate with plants and trees?! How many spirit trees like this are there?"

"Not many..." Luken replied, but continued regretfully in a soft voice, "What good is gaining sentience? She needs thirty-seven years to become a Qi Cultivation Realm spirit root. After that, she will require hundreds of years to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm... Having to live under the mercy of others for so long with spiritual awareness will just increase her suffering."

Li Qinghong observed the tree for a while, realizing an Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit root was indeed not that useful to the Li Family compared to one that would be of the Qi Cultivation Realm. With that in mind, she said softly, "Then I'll come back in thirty-seven years..."

With a wave of her hand, a formation plate flew out of her pouch and landed in front of the tree. A small Embryonic Breathing illusory formation sprang up around it. She flipped her hand and inserted three Spirit Stones, enough to sustain it for many years.

Luken stroked his beard, watching from the side. Li Qinghong smiled and added, "With the current situation, I may not be able to wait for thirty-seven years. By that time, my Li family's descendants will come."

"You're being too modest, Fairy. You are blessed and have the potential to reach the Purple Mansion Realm," Luken commented, shaking his head.

The two of them continued riding the wind together, conversing until they soon arrived in front of a small hill. Luken glanced at it and whispered, "Yes, it should be here."

Li Qinghong addressed him directly, "How do you plan to handle this, fellow Daoist?"

"I'm afraid the tiger demon will escape, and it will be difficult to pursue it. Although we are swift in riding the wind, the tiger demon's Hurricane Ghost Yin is equally fast. Why don't I go in first and engage it? Once the monster has exhausted most of its strength, you can intervene and catch it off guard, Fairy. Your thunder technique is powerful and we'll surely succeed," he suggested.

Li Qinghong was not entirely convinced by his proposal. She sighed inwardly, If only I still had Kong Tingyun's Emerald Jade Plate formation artifact with me... It would make things so much easier!

However, Luken had already flown forward, wielding an ax that shimmered with turquoise light. In an instant, it grew to the size of a house and came crashing down onto the low hill, shaking it with a thunderous rumble. Rubble cascaded down instantly, and a thick layer of dust filled the air.

I knew it, these demons lack legacies and rely solely on their brute strength and dharma artifacts which is quite simplistic... This technique seems to have been developed by himself, and it's not half bad.

Luken had indeed crafted the ax in his hand himself. He had likely read a few low-grade manuals on refining artifacts and dedicated years to mastering it. However, it still could not compare to the Duruo Spear she wielded.

Awoooooooooo...!

A tiger roar echoed in the air, and a powerful man with a bare upper body rose from the mountain. Black mist swirled around him as he bellowed in a deep voice, "Demon general! We are never enemies; why come to my den and provoke me?!"

Luken, who had been kind and respectful in Li Qinghong's presence, now revealed his arrogant side and sneered.

"Hand over the treasured panacea you possess and save ourselves from a fight! If you refuse to comply, I'll have to kill you and take it myself!"

1. Mount Zuiliu can be interpreted in two ways—Mount Flowing Sin or Mount Refuge ☜

Luken, being in the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm himself, exuded a powerful aura that was rather imposing.

The tiger demon looked at him with doubt, frowning as he replied, "I do not wish to provoke nor fight you."

The tiger demon was unwilling to even fight. As his immortal foundation surged, gusts of yin wind enveloped him, and with the aid of the black mist, he shot away like an arrow.

Luken was taken aback; the tiger demons he had encountered in the demon den were typically reckless and short-tempered. He had not expected one to be so cautious.

Stunned for a moment, he jumped up and cursed, "Cowardly tiger!"

He swung the ax in his hand, unleashing a few ax qi the size of horse carriages at the tiger demon, who nimbly evaded the attacks and continued to flee.

"Gosh... I knew this would happen!" Li Qinghong sighed loudly as she shook her head helplessly, seeing the scenario she had feared finally unfold before her very eyes.

Despite Luken's advanced age, he had spent years in the demon den, sheltered by others while focusing on his cultivation. He believed the tiger demon would be impulsive enough to fight to the death over a few provocations.

How could he possibly be a reckless creature and still manage to survive in this mountain? Luken's decisiveness and confidence were even more surprising to me.

She hooked her slender finger, causing her jade-like digits to glow with purple light as she drew a talisman in the air. Thunder suddenly rumbled and black smoke billowed as her thunder talisman was gradually condensed.

Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique!

Li Qinghong focused intently on her spell, stepping onto a bolt of lightning as she chased after the tiger demon at an incredible speed, the thunder talisman in her hand ready to be unleashed.

Swoosh!

The tiger demon swayed in the wind, distancing himself and avoiding Luken's attack. Intent on escaping, he had not anticipated that a beautiful female cultivator would fly toward him, wielding a surge of thunderlight. The purple glow surrounding her radiated great power.

"Fairy... Ah...!"

Black qi surged in the tiger demon's hands as he shouted in confusion, not daring to take a direct hit. He attempted to put distance between himself and his pursuers, trying to ward off the attacks by pushing black qi forward.

Suddenly, lightning flashed, igniting his hands and leaving his face scorched and bloodied, nearly revealing his true form.

Shit! This deer demon specifically brought a thunder cultivator to target me!

As a cultivator who practiced the Hurricane Ghost Yin, he was inherently weak against attacks involving light and thunder.

His apprehension deepened when he saw the long spear in Li Qinghong's hand, its white jade-like appearance indicated it was no ordinary weapon.

His courage faltered.

Wielding a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact and top-tier spell; she must belong to one of the three sects!

As black tiger fur began sprouting on his face and his body began to swell, he cried out miserably, "I am willing to hand over the treasure!"

Luken frowned but continued swinging his ax. Li Qinghong's thunder spear transformed into a shadow, circling him and cutting off his escape route as she urged, "Hand over the treasured panacea quickly, and you shall be spared!"

The tiger demon reacted swiftly. With one hand, he produced a jade box while using the other to channel black qi to resist Luken's ax, retreating several steps in the process.

Li Qinghong launched the jade box into the air with her Duruo Spear and soared up into the sky to retrieve it. She scanned it with her spiritual sense, confirming that it indeed contained the Blood Sun Fruit. With a quick flick of her wrist, she stored it away just as the tiger demon surged a li away, propelled by the wind.

Li Qinghong propelled herself forward amidst purple light, still chasing after him. As the black qi flowed in the tiger demon's palms, he transformed into his original form.

The black tiger loomed as large as a hill, surrounded by a strong wind and swirling black qi. Its bloodshot eyes glinted with malevolence, and dark yin energy clung to it. Roaring, it unleashed sound waves that shocked both Luken and Li Qinghong.

"Since it is the Exalted Immortal who demands the treasured panacea, you can have it as I cannot afford to offend you. However..."

The tiger demon adopted a desperate demeanor, growling fiercely as he continued, "You two will be sorry If you continue to push me further!"

Although this tiger demon had a higher cultivation level than Li Qinghong, he had witnessed the strength of a disciple from the three sects. Fearful of Li Qinghong, he seemed restless, gritting his teeth as he attempted to intimidate Luken.

What a tiger demon...

Li Qinghong glanced at Luken beside her and noticed his fear. Previously, he had been the one who suggested killing the tiger demon, but now, he was the first to show fear.

She could not help but snicker inwardly to herself in amusement.

Most demon cultivators are indeed bullies... The tiger demon is more domineering in a low-key manner but becomes fearful when pushed.

Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow and assured calmly, "Don't be nervous, fellow Daoist. I simply want to ask where you have obtained this spirit fruit."

The black tiger visibly relaxed, and he became noticeably more polite in speech as he asked, "Which sect do you represent, Fairy?"

Li Qinghong laughed and replied ambiguously, "I came from the north."

Realization dawned upon the tiger demon as he breathed a sigh of relief.

So, she's a mountain master from the Yue Cultivating Sect. No wonder she spared my life... I guess she wouldn't have wasted her breath talking to me if she were from the devil gate...

He promptly replied respectfully, "Mountain Master, I came from the southern border. I obtained this fruit from the Wu State on the southern border..."

He then transformed into his human form and told the story of how he had obtained the fruit in detail. It was just an ordinary treasure hunting story that shed no useful information.

Li Qinghong frowned and said, "Since you are familiar with the southern border, do keep an eye out for news of this treasure in the future... Maybe I will come again in a few years. If you obtain more of this fruit, you'll be rewarded."

The tiger demon was overjoyed. Li Qinghong did not want to make an enemy, so she was not going to complain. This treasured panacea was just a tonic for him, saving him ten years of cultivation. He had no one to rely on in Yue State, and it was rare for a disciple from the upper sect to befriend him.

"I understand. Well, this fruit shall be a gift for meeting you," he replied politely.

Li Qinghong glanced at him and felt that this tiger demon behaved more like a human rather than a demon.

"How thoughtful, fellow Daoist..." she commented with an arched brow.

The tiger demon lowered his head and did not answer. Li Qinghong was naturally delighted to be able to obtain the treasure by simply just demanding it. She waved her hand happily and said, "Let's go!"

Luken nodded and followed, and the two rode out on the wind. Li Qinghong got the treasure without much effort and was in a good mood.

Luken stroked his beard and found the entire situation to be strange.

Is this how prominent clans work? The human race is truly strange in their ways... To think that they even turn enemies into friends!

Although he was old, he had been cultivating in the cave for many years and every seclusion lasted at least a decade. Not only that, but the interactions between demons were usually straightforward, hence they were not sophisticated creatures.

Now that he had been out of the cave as a demon general for only more than ten years, he had even less time to deal with people. Combined with the childish mistakes he had made before, regret welled into his heart.

No wonder... No wonder this tiger demon can cultivate in Mount Quanwu for so long... It could survive all this time probably because he is tactful... There is indeed a lot I can learn from these two individuals!

At this moment, he suddenly became much more enthusiastic. Li Qinghong did not understand the sudden shift in the deer demon's demeanor, but she continued chatting with him.

She took the Blood Sun Fruit out from the jade box and carefully checked it several times. Upon verifying that it was of good quality and she did not make a mistake, she finally let out a sigh of relief.

The two flew toward Mount Qingdu, and the deer demon finally left, albeit reluctantly. Li Qinghong landed in front of the mountain and counted the days.

Only more than a month had passed.




# Chapter 504: Hengzhu Dao

Li Xijun and Kongheng rode the wind southward, traversing through Mushroom Forest Plain with Li Xuanxuan flying closely behind them.

Suddenly, Li Xijun recalled something and pulled Kongheng aside. "Master Monk, since you're using Thunderpool as an opportunity to cultivate, why didn't you mention it earlier?" he whispered.

"I have heard that Jiangnan was dangerous so I truly didn't dare to take the risk as my cultivation technique is of a high grade. While your esteemed family suspects I harbor ill intentions, I'm also afraid you might rob me and kill me..." Kongheng admitted, rubbing his smooth bald head.

He opened his narrow eyes and let out a sigh before continuing, "Allow me to clarify, fellow Daoist... The cultivation method I practice requires the nine thunders of heaven and earth. However, the fruition attainment of this cultivation technique is still suspended between heaven and earth, and the thunders I require are difficult to locate. Only when a thunder cultivator breaks through can one of the nine thunders be born during the establishment of the immortal foundation.

"Before the elder of my temple passed away, he spent a considerable time deducing the future and finally learned that one of these thunders would be born in Jiangnan within the next hundred years. He advised me to come here and also predicted a calamity that could help hone my mind..."

He then lowered his gaze, adding softly, "Fellow Daoist Yuanjiao always doubts me, but to be honest... My Liao River Temple is even worse off than your esteemed family. After the Abbot's passing... I've felt like a lost dog, with nowhere to turn."

Li Xijun nodded slightly, feeling a sense of alertness rise within him. "How long has it been since the elder of your esteemed temple passed away?" he asked.

"It has been... more than forty years," Kongheng replied.

Li Xijun calculated silently, realizing that this was around the time when Lingyanzi from the Purple Smoke Gate fled to his home, where his ancestor rescued him and their family acquired the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique.

"More than forty years... Jiangnan now has several thunder cultivators. If this is part of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's scheme, it must have been laid down more than forty years ago..."

Although Li Xijun had never seen Lingyanzi, he had read about him in the Family History and knew that Li Tongya was the one who dealt with him back then.

Lingyanzi... could not have deceived the ancestor. This means Lingyanzi might be unaware that he has inadvertently become someone else's pawn... Purple Smoke Gate... Could this be the scheme of their Daoist Master?

He then asked, "Master Monk, do you know of Thundercloud Temple?"

Kongheng shook his head slightly, indicating that he did not know. Li Xijun contemplated this information.

It seems I must find an opportunity to visit the Purple Smoke Gate and speak with Lingyanzi, he resolved silently.

Li Xijun guessed the worst possible scenario and thought to himself, The abbot of the Liao River Temple likely deduced that Lingyanzi and the others would bring this item from Thundercloud Temple, so he sent Kongheng out into the mountains!

As Li Xijun mulled over this silently, they had already passed through Changxiao Gate's Helin Prefecture. They landed in the mountains at the other end of the prefecture and took a brief respite.

Li Xijun harnessed the power of his eye technique and noted the swirling snow qi as he surveyed the landscape. He then said softly, "This should be the place. We just crossed Mount Quanwu, and ahead lies the Helin Mountain Range, where the earth veins converge and several types of water veins described in the Chilling Snow Series meet."

The purpose of this trip was a mix of both truth and deception; on the surface, Li Xijun was here to gather cold water.

Li Xuanxuan wore a gray coat and followed behind with a stern expression.

Kongheng gazed at the beauty of the mountains and rivers before him, exclaiming, "Jiangnan is indeed rich in water veins!"

Li Xijun nodded in agreement, then turned to Li Xuanxuan and said respectfully,

"Granduncle, you've also read the Chilling Snow Series while on the way here. The Helin Mountain Range is vast. We should split up to search for it; we might find it sooner that way."

Li Xuanxuan nodded at the suggestion. Li Xijun then looked at Kongheng and said, "Although the spiritual energy in the Helin Mountain Range isn't particularly strong, and there are no famous spirit items or demonic creatures, there may still be some roaming devil cultivators. I would appreciate it if Master Monk could keep an eye out for them while my granduncle and I scout the area."

"Sure," Kongheng replied.

Seeing that Li Xijun was acting thoughtfully and methodically, Li Xuanxuan nodded approvingly before choosing a direction to start his search.

After watching him leave, Li Xijun turned to Kongheng, saying, "Master Monk, please keep an eye on my family's elder while I head to Hengdong Prefecture."

Kongheng nodded in agreement and offered him a few words of advice.

Li Xijun then rode the wind northward, passing through the two large mountains of the Helin Mountain Range as he made his way to Hengdong Prefecture of the Hengzhu Dao Gate.

As soon as he flew out of Helin Prefecture, he was greeted by a vast plain that was peppered with clusters of buildings and pavilions of various sizes. Hengdong Prefecture was a large place with millions of inhabitants, overseen by Hengzhu Dao Gate for many years, making it one of the most affluent prefectures in Yue State.

After flying for a while and taking in the view of the expansive and fertile fields around him, Li Xijun felt puzzled.

"Hengzhu Dao Gate... has no immortal mountain?" he wondered aloud.

As he was contemplating this, a figure approached from the front, gliding effortlessly on a cloud. Dressed in white adorned with gold and red cloud patterns, the person had thin lips and large eyes below long brow bones that set him apart from typical Jiangnan people.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist... I am Bi Chengjuan from the Hengzhu Dao. May I ask which sect or gate you represent?"

Bi Chengjuan's deep eyes and sharp nose made it difficult to read his expression. After scrutinizing Li Xijun from head to toe, he quickly deduced that Li Xijun did not belong to any of the three sects or seven gates. However, he chose to phrase his question diplomatically.

"Li Xijun of the Qingdu Li Family. I am a humble cultivator from Moongaze Lake," Li Xijun replied warmly.

Bi Chengjuan's surprise was evident as he nodded in acknowledgment and said, "Ah, the Li Family... I saw the surprisingly clear aura in your eyes and thought you hailed from a certain Dao lineage in Wu State."

Li Xijun humbly downplayed the compliment and Bi Chengjuan continued politely, "Have you traveled far to visit us? What brings you here?"

"I've heard that the Hengzhu Immortal Dao possesses the Tranquil Purification Technique, which can eliminate inner demons and resolve mental burdens. I have an elder who is plagued by his own inner demons, so I've come to seek a cure," Li Xijun replied earnestly,

Bi Chengjuan was clearly experienced and was not surprised by such a request.

"I have no issue with helping out another fellow Daoist, but I must clarify one point first..."

He paused before continuing in a serious tone, "The Tranquil Purification Technique is not a superior immortal method; it's only a Grade Five cultivation technique and might not be effective for some inner demons. If you seek a cure, you must prepare for that possibility, fellow Daoist!"

"Of course, I understand that some limitations exist," Li Xijun replied matter-of-factly.

Bi Chengjuan nodded, then apologized for being blunt as he went on to explain, "Over the years, people who were not cured by the spell have blamed the disciples who performed it. Some even blamed the Hengzhu Dao... Our Dao has faced criticism over the years so we have no choice but to exercise extra caution."

Seeing Bi Chengjuan's demeanor, Li Xijun felt more positive about him.

This Hengzhu Dao is quite different from Azure Pond; it surpasses all the other gates in the northern part of Yue State... That's truly rare!

After clearing the air, Bi Chengjuan warmed up a lot more, smiling as he asked, "This is your first time visiting Hengzhu Dao, right?"

"That's correct," Li Xijun replied.

Bi Chengjuan explained, "The Hengzhu Dao has a long history. Over generations, we have been known simply as Hengzhu Dao. However, some busybodies later began categorizing various institutions into sects and gates, which led people to refer to us as Hengzhu Dao Gate. This term gradually became widespread, making it difficult to change."

He looked somewhat frustrated as he continued, "The Daoists from the north all refer to us as a Dao Sect. In truth, it is not so. My Hengzhu Dao cannot be compared to Azure Pond or Golden Feather. Although we all follow the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, Hengzhu Dao follows the path of ancient cultivation!"

Li Xijun listened attentively as Bi Chengjuan continued explaining in detail, "To be honest, the cultivation methods of my Dao are closer to those of the Great Xiukui Temple in the east. Both Hengzhu Dao and Xikui Dao were established many years ago as sub-mansions of the Moonlight Immortal Mansion."

He chuckled lightly and said, "Because of this, the Great Xiukui Temple is also facing the same situation and is frequently referred to as the Xikui Dao Gate. The Daoists there are much more ferocious, they'll give anyone who referred to them with the wrong name a good beating."

Li Xijun nodded thoughtfully, noting that Bi Chengjuan seemed to care a lot about speeches. He then looked at the faces of those under the rule of Hengzhu and praised, "Your esteemed Dao is indeed quite ancient!"

"Don't mention it..." Bi Chengjuan replied sadly before changing the subject by asking, "Could you please stay for a few days? I need to return to set up the formation and prepare the necessary pills."

"Of course... how many Spirit Stones will that be?" Li Xijun replied, cupping his fist.

Bi Chengjuan remained polite, but his price was firm.

"Only fifty Spirit Stones will do," he replied.

Li Xijun felt a twinge of pain at the cost but had no choice but to nod in agreement. He took out twenty-five Spirit Stones from his storage pouch as a deposit before taking to the wind again.

Once outside the Hengzhu's territory, Li Xijun grew anxious, unsure of how to bring this up to Li Xuanxuan. His granduncle had been in a position of power for a long time, and although he now bore the weight of spiritual turmoil, he still looked intimidating whenever he wore a stern expression on his face.

Upon landing in Helin Mountain Range again, Li Xijun took out the jade pendant and tried locating his granduncle and the monk. However, the distance between them was probably too great so he could not pinpoint his exact location. After circling around, he finally found them.

He saw Li Xuanxuan standing by a small hill, silently casting spells, while Kongheng stood beside him, guarding him. Li Xijun approached and scanned the terrain with the secret technique in the Chilling Snow Series.

He felt a rush of joy and exclaimed, "So, there is indeed cold water hidden in the water vein underneath here!"

The two performed a series of hand seals and worked together for a while, causing the ground to tremble slightly as a crack as big as a hole the size of a baby's mouth was created in it. Shimmering blue water surged forth, and Li Xijun quickly took out a jade bottle to collect it.

"It's Forest Cold Water... capable of nourishing true essence with cold qi," he remarked.

This spirit water of heaven and earth, while not particularly rare, was located at the intersection of the earth veins. Compared to the Heavenly Pure Essence, it hardly measured up to it.

Yet for Li Xijun, it was a treasure—it could be used to refine true essence and practice the Slaughter Jun Kui Light. He stored it away carefully, feeling his mood improving significantly.

A rare smile also appeared on Li Xuanxuan's face as he suggested, "I'm lucky to have found it so quickly. It's only been a day; we can find some more to keep at home..."

Li Xijun apologized first, then got on his knees and said, "I've heard that Hengzhu Dao has methods to exorcize demons... Why don't we go and take a look first, then come back to search for more?"

Li Xuanxuan glared at him and shouted, "No! What's the big deal? I'll just take two pills before drawing talismans as I usually do... That has always worked!"

Li Xijun gritted his teeth and said firmly, "I have already flown to Hengdong Prefecture and paid the fee earlier. Please come with me, Granduncle."

"YOU!"

It was only at this moment that realization dawned upon Li Xuanxuan. He was too stunned to speak for a moment before finally exclaiming, "I can't believe you and Ming'er are teaming up against me!"

Li Xijun simply bowed his head and replied, "I was too impulsive... If Granduncle refuses to go, everything will be wasted."

Of course, Li Xuanxuan understood what Li Xijun was trying to say. After a long pause, he finally said, "Don't do that again!"

He glanced at Li Xijun then launched into a long-winded lecture about his father, Li Yuanyun, then his grandfather, Li Xuanling, and finally recounted how frugal Li Tongya was when he was still alive—who was too cautious to spend even a single Spirit Stone.

Li Xijun listened silently until he finished speaking before saying, "If Great-grandfather were alive, he wouldn't want to see you torturing yourself like this."

Li Xuanxuan stopped talking immediately and flew in silence for a while. Finally, he murmured, "I didn't notice it back then... If only I could go to Zhenhui Temple in my younger brother's place..."

He turned his head, his aged face stained with tears.

"I, Li Xuanxuan... I will never say another word!"

The old man covered his face and continued lamenting, "I owe him too much... I owe him too much... If Brother Ling were alive, he would have reached the Foundation Establishment Realm by now, unlike me... I am useless! As a result, your father died right in front of me, and I fled alone! How can I face you?! How can I face him?! It would be better for me to die!"

Li Xijun was moved and tried to comfort him, saying, "But our family is doing a lot better now..."

Kongheng, who was standing nearby, had always been an empathetic person. Hearing the old man's distress, he thought to himself, I always thought Li Xuanxuan was a pedantic and stubborn old man... I never realized there was such a story behind him. Clearly, my cultivation is still lacking...

The three of them rode the wind toward the territory of Hengzhu Dao. Bi Chengjuan quickly approached, sweeping his gaze over the three men before eyeing Kongheng warily. His tone turned somewhat cold as he asked, "Where are you from, Master Monk?"

Confused by his attitude, Kongheng replied, "I used to be a Buddhist cultivator from the north but I'm now a guest cultivator of the Li Family."

"Guest cultivator of the Li Family..?"

Bi Chengjuan's expression darkened, but fortunately, he did not show hostility immediately. He merely continued coldly, "Ah yes, Moongaze Lake is near the Great River... I supposed it isn't surprising that the Li Family would take in a few monks."

Sensing the tense atmosphere, Li Xijun quickly clarified, "This is Master Monk Kongheng from Liao River Temple. He practiced in Mobei and followed ancient Buddhist cultivation techniques, strictly adhering to the precepts... Please forgive any misunderstandings..."

Bi Chengjuan realized his mistake and his expression finally softened as he sighed and apologized, "I was too impulsive... I'm truly sorry!"

With a mournful face, he continued, "Many years ago, Murong Xia traveled south, wreaking havoc and eating people everywhere... He even killed my eldest sister! My ancestor fought valiantly, alarming the Azure Pond Sect to intervene, but in the end, nothing came of it."

Bi Chengjuan gritted his teeth and added, "Two of the three Purple Mansions Realm cultivators from my family were dispatched, yet we were still humiliated!"

Master Kongheng then mumbled quietly, "The Murong Family... They seem to practice the Compassion Dharma Form."

"Compassion my ass!"

Bi Chengjuan appeared to be offended by that comment and seethed with anger, saying hatefully, "That Murong Xia killed my eldest sister! H-He... even allowed her soul to appear and persuade my ancestor... Can you believe such a thing is possible in this world?!"

Li Xijun felt a pang of grievance at this revelation, secretly astonished by the strength of the Murong Family.

Hengzhu Dao's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator actually endured such humiliation...?

Bi Chengjuan sighed, then apologized again for letting his emotions get the better of him. He took out five shimmering golden pills from his chest pocket and then said softly, "Please prepare yourself, fellow Daoist..."

He then pulled out a jade knife and explained in a dull tone, "These are body pills that correspond to the five acupoints of the mind... It is part of the ancient cultivation method. I'll cut open your skin and flesh, insert the pills, and then use a secret technique to seal the wounds."
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝓮𝒘𝙚𝙗𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝒐𝙢

Noticing the surprised expressions on the faces of those around him, he explained, "These pills are engraved with tiny formations. When you enter my Dao's Tranquil Profound Conversion Formation shortly, they will dissolve naturally and help eliminate your inner demons."




# Chapter 506: Xizhi Leaves The Sect

"Come with me, Senior."

Bi Chengjuan glanced at Li Xuanxuan, estimating that he was over a hundred years old. He called out to the elder and led the three of them down.

The mountain gate of Hengzhu Dao was underground, with a cliff-like entrance in the prefecture where cultivators came and went. Hengzhu cultivators utilized an ancient form of flying, distinct from the current method of riding on the wind, allowing them greater flexibility in their movements.

The mountain gate of Hengzhu was known as the Blessed Land of Hengzhu, a site that was established by ancient cultivators. Bi Chengjuan did not take the three into the main area but instead led them to a hole in the wall that opened into a small secret chamber.

"It's going to hurt quite a bit since we're cutting into your flesh... Please bear with it, Senior," he instructed.

With a jade knife in hand, Bi Chengjuan prepared to make the necessary incisions. Li Xuanxuan, having endured much in his life, was naturally able to withstand the pain. He removed his clothing, allowing Bi Chengjuan to make cuts on his face, chest, and back. The acupoints were sealed to stop the bleeding before inserting a golden pill into each of the wounds.

Li Xuanxuan grunted softly as Bi Chengjuan gently stroked his back. The five cuts, each about the size of a baby's mouth, slowly closed.

Bi Chengjuan then led him further, opened the secret chamber, and instructed softly, "Senior, please go in and sit cross-legged. Wait for the formation to activate."

Li Xuanxuan nodded and stepped inside obediently.

As the heavy door slammed shut, Bi Chengjuan turned to the two remaining companions and whispered, "You two should wait here for three days and don't go out. My people are still upset about what happened in the past... If Master Monk wanders around, it might cause trouble."

Kongheng nodded, watching Bi Chengjuan leave, and then sighed softly.

"Murong... How could he do such a thing?!"

Li Xijun glanced at him and replied, "Isn't he always like that? He is proud of the paradise in his belly and forces you to be grateful after he finishes eating you."

Kongheng fell silent and looked as though he had a stomach full of words to share.

After a long pause, he said, "When I was eight years old, the abbot was good friends with a Buddhist cultivator from Yan State. He used his divine ability and gave me a tour of his belly. I saw a shimmering pool, merits flowing like water, golden sand spreading across the ground, and colored glaze forming steps. The lotus flowers were as large as wheels, in the colors of blue, red, white, and purple, while countless birds and beasts chanted the Buddha’s name, seeking truth. The people were joyous, free from suffering, trouble, disaster, or evil. It was quiet and serene."

The monk appeared lost in thought as he continued, "The Daoist sects regard this as devil cultivation... but I can't discern right from wrong. The Buddhist cultivators of Zhao State seek the ultimate truth and strive to establish a Buddhist State on Earth, while those of Yan State relieve suffering and create a paradise within themselves. The Buddhist cultivators of Yan State enable thousands to find bliss after death, and those in Zhao State alleviate suffering in life, yet ancient cultivators like me simply continued ringing the bell and preaching in the temple."

"Every time the Yan and Zhao State’s Buddhist cultivators arrived, the people of Liao River flocked to them, leaving thousands of houses empty. Everyone was smiling and happy, while ancient cultivators like me remained in the temple planting vegetables.

"The host said that using divine abilities to confuse and control the people is an unorthodox practice that will prevent one from becoming the Revered One. But... I clearly practice Buddhism for the people. As long as the people are happy, I will do it. I can use my divine ability to make unpalatable steamed buns seem like delicacies and simple clothes appear rich and luxurious, but if I focus solely on whether I can become the Revered One and ignore the people's needs, how can I be considered a great person?"

"Fellow Daoist, if you come across a mortal in great pain, would you cast a spell to relieve their suffering?" he asked.

Li Xijun frowned and replied, "Of course, I would..."

Kongheng’s usually gentle face betrayed a hint of fear as he murmured, "If there are true paradises within the bellies and Buddhist State on Earth... Why should the people of Liao River be drowned in suffering?"

Li Xijun was taken aback by the sight of Kongheng sweating profusely, his pallor indicating sheer terror, and even his legs were trembling slightly. The golden light that had previously coiled around him dissipated, now replaced by swirling rings of colorful light that were emanating from behind his head.

Fearing that Kongheng might suddenly shout, I've been enlightened! and transform into a Yan State Buddist cultivator with a paradise in his belly, Li Xijun quickly made a decision.

He struck Kongheng on the back and shouted, "Monk Kongheng!"

Using the Pine Snow True Essence, he sent a wave of cold through Kongheng’s body, causing him to cough up black blood. The colorful light behind his head vanished as if startled, and his eyes immediately cleared.

The monk closed his eyes and began chanting a sutra shakily. After a long while, he said, "Thank you, fellow Daoist..."

However, after expressing his gratitude, he panted heavily, narrowed his eyes, and murmured, "My Liao River enjoys a bountiful harvest every year, and the people live better than those in Yan and Zhao States... Yet, the rich and the poor remain unhappy. The abbot told us not to be bothered by such matters..."

His expression turned somber, and he no longer showed signs of changing to another Dao lineage. Yet, he could not hide the anguish on his face.

"But how can I not be bothered when the wailing cries of the Liao River shook the heavens?!"

Azure Pond Sect, General Affairs Hall.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝚠𝕖𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝕖𝚕.𝚌𝗼𝗺

Li Xizhi soared through the air with colorful lights beneath his feet before landing on the peak of the mountain. As a Qi Cultivator, he was required to undertake a mission every ten years. He had already come seven times in the last decade but had yet to find one he wanted.

I won’t have many years left to wait if I still can't find a suitable one this time.

The Azure Pond Sect did not have many disciples who were truly part of a peak, making it often difficult to encounter fellow cultivators of the same faction in the mountains. Only in the General Affairs Hall could one witness a bustling scene. Stepping inside, Li Xizhi found many cultivators chatting and laughing together.

Qingsui Peak was not particularly popular, and since Li Xizhi seldom ventured out, he did not really have friends. He scanned the hall and noticed several bounty hunts that either required targets to be captured or killed.

Although the rewards for such missions were generous, Li Xizhi never accepted any. His family was in Moongaze Lake, and he dared not offend anyone.

After skimming through requests related to slaying demons and various missions that required one to travel across the four seas or to the northern and southern borders, he finally spotted a few local missions concerning the search for spirit items in Yue State.

The first one that caught his attention read: Supreme Yin Moonlight... Those who find it will receive thirty great merits and three Essence Gathering Pills...

Heavenly Pure Essence... Those who find it will receive...

A long list of rewards followed.

Li Xizhi sighed as he considered them. Such missions were often impossible to fulfill, so he quickly moved on and found a few entries at the bottom that involved long-term assignments.

"Market in Libu Prefecture... Guard... Gather Qi... Approximately five years."

While others viewed such missions as troublesome and a waste of time, Li Xizhi found them appealing. Overjoyed, he quickly removed the jade pendant hanging at the side of the post.

So what if it takes some time? This is a perfect opportunity to return home! I can receive a talisman, take a pill, and help out a little.

He closely inspected the removed jade pendant, only to discover a name written on the back of it. It turned out it had been hanging for too long without being claimed, so it had been assigned to Lingdou Peak.

Lingdou Peak was weaker than Qingsui Peak, with its peak master reaching only the Qi Cultivation Realm. Li Xizhi sighed with regret. He stared at the jade pendant in his hand for a moment before making up his mind.

He took off on a rainbow, guiding the colorful light through the mountains for a while until he soon spotted the low and short Lingdou Peak. Upon arriving at the mountain, he inquired about the peak master, who hurried out to greet him.

"Yu Fuyu greets fellow Daoist."

"I am Li Xizhi of Qingsui Peak."

Yu Fuyu was short and stout. Li Xizhi had heard some rumors about him; he was a cultivator from the Yu Family. However, due to various scandals associated with the family, Yu Fuyu's branch had long been extinguished, leading him to sever ties with the Yu Family and live a humble life.

"Ah, Li Family of Qingdu... Your reputation precedes you!" Yu Fuyu remarked humbly.

When Li Xizhi explained the purpose of his visit, Yu Fuyu immediately replied, "That's not a big problem!"

He then took out another jade pendant and handed it to Li Xizhi, who nodded politely and expressed his gratitude. Not wanting to linger any longer, he made his way back to the General Affairs Hall to complete the necessary procedures before returning to Qingsui Peak.

As soon as he landed, Yang Xiao'er approached, cradling a swaddled bundle in her arms. Li Xizhi gently embraced her and said softly, "I’ve just accepted a mission from general affairs, and will take Huai'er back with me."

Yang Xiao'er held the child close, saying nothing. Li Xizhi felt guilty but said softly, "Huai'er must not remain in the sect, no matter what... He belongs to my Li Family, not to Azure Pond Sect."

Tears welled in Yang Xiao'er’s eyes as she replied, "I understand... but he’s only one year old. Having to leave us fills me with reluctance and worry!"

Despite saying that, Yang Xiao'er would be even more worried about keeping him in Azure Pond Sect. She placed Li Chenghuai into Li Xizhi’s arms, then removed the jade pendant she wore around her neck and tied it around the child.

With that, she finally said, "Please take care of yourself out there, my dear."

Li Xizhi nodded, planting a kiss on her smooth forehead as he whispered, "Take care of yourself in the sect too."

The couple had already planned this long ago. They exchanged a few intimate words before Li Xizhi gathered his belongings and took flight, leaving Yang Xiao'er in a poignant silence.

Soaring through the layers of clouds, Li Xizhi activated a jade token and passed through the Heavenly Essence Dao Spirit Formation. After a brief flight, Simin County came into view.

Simin was the largest prefecture in Yue State and the foundation of Azure Pond. As Li Xizhi departed from Azure Pond, he felt his spiritual energy wane two or three times. Yet, he flew faster on the rainbow, feeling an exhilarating sense of freedom.

"It’s been twenty years... I’m finally out here again..."

The scenery below rushed past him like a blur, and Li Xizhi, eager to reunite with his family, quickened his pace.

————

Qingdu Peak.

Li Qinghong landed on Qingdu Peak, where Li Wushao was already waiting. The black-clad man bowed and respectfully reported, "I have gone north to investigate. There is indeed a group of devil cultivators stationed in that temple... They seem to be setting up a formation and have been cultivating there for some time. Among them, there are two in the late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm, six in the middle stage, and three in the early stage. They all seem to work well with each other."

Li Wushao paused before adding, "I didn't want to spook them so I didn’t get too close. I only observed strange black clouds forming above that place... It seems like something is going on there."

Li Qinghong nodded, contemplating for a moment before saying, "I’ll go and take a look from a distance."

Li Wushao hurriedly followed her as they both rode the wind and took flight, with Li Wushao leading the way.

Unexpectedly, as they exited their territory, a middle-aged man appeared before them, flying at an astonishing speed straight toward them.

Li Qinghong quickly drew her Duruo Spear, eyeing the middle-aged man warily.

"May I ask why you are stopping us, Senior?"

The middle-aged man, dressed in golden robes that were adorned with white cloud patterns, had an unassuming appearance. A sword hung at his waist, and his dharma robe was so lavish that Li Qinghong could not gauge his cultivation level at first.

The man glanced at Li Wushao, causing him to feel a chill down his spine. He felt as though the man could see through his true form.

Li Qinghong grew vigilant and instinctively stepped back. However, the man remained silent and reached out to Li Qinghong without drawing his weapon.

His hand, pale as jade, suddenly loomed large before them, emanating a vague pulling force that captivated their spiritual senses, making it difficult to look away.

Rumble!

Since Li Qinghong had been on guard and gathering power in her hands, a bolt of purple lightning split the air. Underneath Li Wushao's black robe, two shadows silently emerged, their presence barely noticeable.

"A thunder cultivator, huh?" the middle-aged man remarked casually.

He brought his fingers together and instantly dispersed the purple thunderstrike, revealing his cultivation level—surprisingly, he was at the peak of Foundation Establishment Realm. Even without activating his immortal foundation, Li Qinghong and Li Wushao were already filled with dread.

The middle-aged man’s shimmery golden eyes revealed that he had clearly mastered a perception technique before. Though Li Wushao's tail hooks were devious, he spotted them right through the shadows. With a swift motion of his golden sleeve, he struck Li Wushao, leaving him pale with shock.

Seizing the opening that Li Wushao had created, Li Qinghong’s eyes filled with a fierce purple light. Her jade armor glowed with crackling purple lightning, and parting her vermillion lips, she spat out a speck of purple light which rapidly expanded to the size of a fist, radiating a brilliant white glow.

Swoosh!

Crackle!

Complex purple lines manifested in the air, unleashing an overwhelming aura of destruction.

The middle-aged man’s expression shifted slightly, and he remarked with a hint of appreciation, "Looks like Li Tongya has a successor!"

Li Qinghong was slightly puzzled, yet refused to be distracted. She directed the profound thunder toward the man, and quickly pulled away from him with Li Wushao, propelling purple lightning backward for several li.

The middle-aged man in golden robes made no attempt to evade or chase them. Instead, he stared at the thunder talisman before him with keen interest. He finally touched the long sword at his waist, exhaling softly before drawing it from its sheath.

BOOM!!

A brilliant white light erupted in the sky. The thunder roared like an avalanche, shaking the lake and causing rocks on the nearby mountain to tumble down. The white thunder turned into dense purple lightning, cascading down like a waterfall in a show of power.

CLANG!

A brilliant sword light cleaved the thunder waterfall, splitting it into two easily. The middle-aged man strolled forward leisurely, performing a hand seal.

"Disperse," he commanded with a smile.

The thunder in the sky and the turbulence in the lake dissipated like mist. Li Qinghong and the others had already reached the foot of the mountain when the middle-aged man altered the spell in his hand and whispered softly, "Come."

Suddenly, they felt their bodies freeze, the wind around them spiraling out of control. Li Qinghong made their escape with the Blood Escape Technique, halting just a step away from the mountain gate.

The middle-aged man in gold used an escape spell too and effortlessly closed the distance, reaching them in just two strides and fixing his gaze on Li Qinghong.

This is no ordinary peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... He is likely close to ascending to the Purple Mansion Realm! He must be a direct descendant of one of the three sects... The spells he uses are definitely not of Grade Three or Four... He’s truly a significant figure!

Fei Wangbai, who was defeated in just twenty or thirty moves, flashed through Li Qinghong’s mind. She quickly regained her composure and said softly, "Li Qinghong of Qingdu greets Senior... Which sect do you hail from?"

He raised his eyebrows with a smile and replied, "Li Tongya truly taught his junior well! What a thunder talisman! Had I just entered Foundation Establishment Realm and been caught off guard by that move, I might have sustained some serious injuries..."

The middle-aged man regarded Li Qinghong with interest and continued, "As for me? I am Zhang Yun, just a swordsman from Jiangnan. Today, I am here to look after you, and is taking the opportunity to visit the Li Family."[1]

1. Recap: Zhang Yun was a disciple from the Golden Feather Sect who met Li Tongya and rogue cultivators Xu Yangping and his wife in the Snake Demon Cave back then. ☜




# Chapter 508: Inquiries

He's from the Golden Feather Immortal Sect, huh...

Upon hearing that his surname was Zhang and taking in the attire he wore, Li Qinghong immediately understood that Zhang Yun wanted to remain incognito by referring to himself as a swordsman of Jiangnan, so she chose not to expose him.

Zhang Yun...

The name was familiar, and combined with his tone, it immediately brought someone to mind.

When Li Tongya infiltrated the Snake Demon Cave Dwelling back then, he had to share the spoils with a swordsman named Zhang Yun.

Zhang Yun picked the snake demon's inner core and the Blood Dharma Manual, while Li Tongya received the River Mountain Sutra and the Duruo Spear that she still wielded today.

Li Qinghong deduced that this was likely the same Zhang Yun from years past. Now, seventy or eighty years later, he was about to reach the Purple Mansion Realm.

This man... is a direct descendant of the three sects!

She cupped her fist and introduced herself.

"Greetings, Senior. I am Li Qinghong. Li Tongya is my grandfather."

"Ah, so you are the descendant of an old friend of mine," Zhang Yun replied, glancing at her while his golden robe fluttered in the wind.

"Your immortal foundation is good. The thunder talisman is decent, too. However, your spear technique is average. As for your escape techniques, spells, and secret arts, they lack substance. They might intimidate prominent clans since they are on par with those from the seven gates. Yet, against the Golden Feather and Azure Pond, they would struggle to prevail."

Li Qinghong nodded in acknowledgment. Zhang Yun studied the two of them, standing with his hands behind his back, and then inquired, "Since you know of my friendship with your elder, why don't you invite me in?"

After hearing this blunt request, Li Qinghong had no choice but to lead him inside. The Green Ox River Embrace Formation on Qingdu Peak was likely just mere decoration in his presence. If he had intended to harm her, he could have done so long ago.

Zhang Yun seemed oblivious to her concerns, or perhaps he simply did not care. He landed on the mountain, surveying the White Irises that peppered the landscape, and said softly, "Li Tongya... What a pity. When I heard he had broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm, I thought we would eventually have a formal duel! But it seems that chance has passed."

Li Qinghong remained cautious and held her tongue as she walked with Zhang Yun, who continued to muse aloud, "The younger generation taught by Li Tongya is quite impressive, far better than I was at their age. Although my three sons are gifted, they lack discipline since I'm always in long seclusions... They have grown into rather arrogant boys."

Zhang Yun seemed to suddenly realize he had strayed from the topic and quickly added, "But... I came here this time to remind you of one thing..."

"Don't concern yourself with Zhang Huaide's affairs or any other incidents occurring along the riverbank. I was sent to oversee this matter personally. I consider Li Tongya a friend, which is why I made this trip. Just take care of yourselves," he said.

Li Qinghong thanked him softly, but Zhang Yun suddenly stopped, standing with his hands behind his back as he asked, "The River Mountain Sutra is still in your family's possession, correct?"

After a brief pause, Li Qinghong replied, "Yes, Senior, that's correct."

Although Zhang Yun was no longer a young man, he still had a playful demeanor. With a smile, he simply commented, "Great."

Then, his expression shifted to one of curiosity as he asked, "Is the Wanglin Blossom also from your family?"

Li Qinghong was taken aback by the sudden question but quickly understood the implications.

It's said that the Wanglin Blossoms have been extinct in Jiangnan for hundreds of years. The three sects monitor everything in Jiangnan closely. They must have heard about my family suddenly acquiring one...

"Yes!" she replied respectfully.

Zhang Yun's demeanor turned serious as he pressed on, "Where did it come from?"

Li Qinghong's mind raced. Zhang Yun clearly understood the significance of the Wanglin Blossom, which was why he was inquiring about it. Yet, her family knew little about it.

This must be connected to the Wang Family!

Her family lacked critical information, and their status was not equal to that of the three sects. If she tried anything funny, it might backfire. Thus, Li Qinghong could only be as vague as possible in her response.

"It was left by a Daoist from the north. My family assisted him, and in gratitude, he gifted us with the spirit root."

Zhang Yun, who appeared somewhat frivolous moments ago, now looked very serious as he asked, "What is their cultivation level and surname?"

Li Qinghong hesitated before replying, "That senior is quite strange. He has a majestic aura, yet you can't discern his cultivation level. His surname... is Wang!"

She was smart, choosing her words carefully. While Wang Xun treated her as an equal, she respectfully referred to him as a senior. Hence, her description painted the picture of a formidable northerner, prompting a frown from Zhang Yun.

"I had a feeling his surname would be Wang!" he exclaimed, exhaling deeply as realization struck.

Wang Family of Yinghua Wang! A Golden Core Realm Clan!

Shocked, he asked in confusion, "That is an immortal clan from the north... How can someone from a small clan help him?"

"My elder left behind a sword named Qingche, which contains his sword intent. The senior merely wished to take a look at it," Li Qinghong explained softly.

Understanding dawned on Zhang Yun.

"Ah, yes, that's indeed the only rather interesting thing about your Li Family... Where is the sword?"

"It has been taken by my brother on his trip to the south," she replied.

Zhang Yun could only give up. He nodded, acknowledging the situation then suddenly chuckled softly, saying, "This is your family's opportunity, but don't overthink it... Wang Family of Yinghua is most afraid of being tainted by worldly karma. The fact he bestowed this spirit root upon your family means he has already calculated everything and ensured that your paths will not cross again!"

Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow slightly at his words, and Zhang Yun's clear eyes indicated he had seen through the calculations at play.

She sighed inwardly.

The direct descendants of the Golden Feather Sect are indeed difficult to deal with...

Unbeknownst to her, Zhang Yun felt a pang of regret as he thought to himself, So, it was given by the Wang Family of Yinghua! What a pity. Since the Wanglin Blossom is immensely useful, I intended to come to the Li Family to take this Foundation Establishment Realm spirit root for my own use at the sect... But it seems that I truly can't take it.

After all, the gift from the Wang Family of Yinghua represented a culmination of cause and effect. If Zhang Yun were to snatch it away after just a few years, the Wang Family would inevitably be displeased. Although the Foundation Establishment Realm spirit root was precious, it was not essential for Zhang Yun, and he had no desire to offend the Wang Family.

He looked at Li Qinghong and suddenly asked, "Has your brother also reached the Foundation Establishment Realm?"

Li Qinghong did not dare to lie about such an obvious question and simply nodded.

Zhang Yun smiled and murmured, "Interesting... interesting... Three generations of a family with five Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators—there must be something unusual about that."

After a moment's reflection, he continued, "Ning Tiaoxiao also personally arranged the marriage. He must have discovered something about the Li Family, hmm..."

"Li Qinghong... does your brother also practice Boundless Ocean?" Zhang Yun asked.

"Yes," Li Qinghong replied softly.

Zhang Yun chuckled and nodded.

"Good... very good!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he ignored the Li Family members entirely and enveloped himself in golden light. With that, he passed through their family's formation effortlessly and headed north on his own.

Li Qinghong bowed her head and saw him off, watching as he walked away laughing. It was only then did she release a sigh of relief, her back damp with sweat.

When she noticed Li Xicheng rushing into the yard, she said urgently, "Stop the news immediately. Don't let anyone know about Zhang Yun's visit!"

Li Xicheng nodded in agreement.

"Don't worry, Auntie... The fight just now happened too quickly! We only know that someone used a thunder spell. I'll inform everyone that you were practicing your spells."

Hengdong Prefecture.

"This is far enough, fellow Daoist. There's no need to be so formal," Li Xijun said softly as he and his companions reached the edge of Hengzhu Prefecture.

They cupped their fists to Bi Chengjuan and added, "Let's bid each other farewell here!"

Bi Chengjuan nodded and replied, "If you pass through Hengzhu in the future, just mention my name, and I will personally come to receive you."

With a grateful smile, Li Xijun took his leave. Though Li Xuanxuan still appeared old and frail, he now seemed much more energized, his eyes clearer, and a smile had returned to his face.

"This Hengzhu's Tranquil Purification Technique is truly effective! The heaviness in my heart has lifted significantly, and I can wield my true essence more easily," he remarked.

Li Xijun smiled and responded, "That's a good sign. Granduncle, you must follow the instructions and avoid fighting for the next few years. Otherwise, it could interfere with your cultivation."

Concerned that Li Xuanxuan might disregard his advice, he quickly added, "If a fight breaks out, those Spirit Stones we spent would all have gone to waste!"

"I understand... Of course, I know..." Li Xuanxuan replied, then mumbled trivialities. The atmosphere lightened significantly. Kongheng chanted scriptures as they flew on, watching the old and young man chatter amiably.

After arriving at the Helin Mountain Range, the two landed and began their separate searches for spirit items. They spent two months scouring the area, discovering only one or two minor spirit items with no significant finds.

Li Xijun reunited with Li Xuanxuan at the appointed time, who looked increasingly relaxed over the past two months. The old man held a handful of plums, offering a few to Li Xijun.

Amused, Li Xijun accepted them but remarked regretfully, "I never expected the spiritual energy of Mount Helin to be so poor... No wonder there haven't been any notable spirit items here in all these years."

Li Xuanxuan took a few plums and handed them to Kongheng, who received them with a smile.

"There aren't even many demons in this Helin Mountain Range; it can't compare to Mount Dali," Li Xuanxuan remarked.

Li Xijun took out a map and suggested, "We still have plenty of time. Why don't we cross the prefecture and head to the mountain ranges of Quanwu and Dongli?"

Li Xuanxuan naturally had no objections. The three of them quickly finalized their itinerary and set off to the east, preparing to head northeast to Quanwu Mountain Range first.

"Quanwu Mountain Range is truly vast," Kongheng remarked, gazing at the distant peaks faintly visible through the clouds.

"When we traveled south, we crossed the western foothill of this mountain. Now, after making a huge round, we've only reached its eastern foothill."

Seizing the opportunity, Li Xijun asked, "How does it compare to Mount Luoxia?"

Kongheng pondered for a moment before replying, "It's hard to make a direct comparison. There are also majestic mountains to the north, most of which are renowned for their high elevation and abundant spiritual energy. However, they differ from this mountain, which stretches continuously for tens of thousands of li..."

"However, if we're only comparing spiritual energy, Mount Luoxia is undoubtedly the best. No other place can compare to it," he concluded with decisiveness.

"Mount Luoxia is without a doubt the location with the most abundant spiritual energy in the world, followed by the grotto heavens or blessed lands of various sects. The rest of the mountains are at the end of the list," Kongheng stated with rare confidence.

"What Dao lineage is associated with Mount Luoxia?" Li Xijun asked curiously.

Kongheng seemed momentarily lost in thought before he responded, "The name Luoxia comes from a True Monarch who resides there. He forged his Dao through Heavenly Glow. It's said all Heavenly Glows in this world must yield to his control... When the sun and moon replace each other, the first ray of light emerges from Mount Luoxia."

"Only when this first ray descends upon the mountain can various other Heavenly Glows be born. It is said there are seventy-two types of Heavenly Glows in the world, and forty-eight of them are the creations of this True Monarch's divine ability."[1]

Li Xijun then inquired, "Since Mount Luoxia is the strongest Dao lineage in the north, I assume there must be more than one True Monarch, right?"

Kongheng replied softly, "As for how many True Monarchs exist in Mount Luoxia, how many are on the mainland, how many are overseas, and how many have departed this land—there have always been differing opinions, and no one knows for certain. Only in the past few hundred years have three True Monarchs emerged and made their presence known. These are real Golden Core Realm True Monarchs!"

Noticing that the Li Family members were listening intently, he added, "But I've also heard rumors that the True Monarch who forged his Dao with Heavenly Glow had become an immortal."

"Became an immortal?!"

Jiangnan Daoist cultivators often referred to these immortals as Fairies or Exalted Immortals, while northern Buddhist cultivators often spoke of attaining enlightenment or achieving the Dao.

However, Li Xijun understood that the term become an immortal, as used by Kongheng, carried a much deeper meaning.

"You're referring to... Dao Embryo?" he asked softly.

"Yes..." Kongheng nodded, with a slight envious expression on his face, and continued softly, "I heard that he has already gained the immortal body of Dao Embryo and become truly immortal... for as long as the heaven and earth still exist, and as long as the sun and the moon still shines. I wonder if he is still on Mount Luoxia..."

"What an impressive divine ability master," Li Xijun praised, but Kongheng shook his head slightly and then asked, "Isn't there also an immortal in the south, where you are from?

Seeing Li Xijun and the others looking puzzled, Kongheng asked curiously, "Well... I heard that whenever the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in your south break through to the Golden Core Realm, that person will send someone to collect metallic essence. Is that true?"

Realization finally dawned upon Li Xijun and he replied, "Ah, so that's what you're talking about! Yes, it's true!"

"Yes!" Kongheng exclaimed, before asking, "What level of cultivation does this immortal have? How did he become an immortal? Where is his immortal mansion?"

Li Xijun could only shake his head helplessly in response to the monk's series of questions, and said softly, "To be honest, the three sects have always controlled the circulation of news in Jiangnan. It is said that they once destroyed books in a concentrated manner, blurring out a lot of information about the achievements of Foundation Establishment and Purple Mansion Realms. My family has a shallow foundation, and I have to rely on overseas cultivators just to learn about Jiangnan, let alone any immortals..."

Kongheng nodded thoughtfully and apologized.

The group traveled day and night and flew for half a month before they finally arrived at the other side of Mount Quanwu, which was adjacent to Libu Prefecture in the north and Mount Dongli in the east. It was an area with fewer demons and much safer.

They promptly dispersed to look for water veins and spirit items.

————

Li Xizhi left the sect and flew north quickly on the wind. On the way, he clumsily coaxed Huai'er in his arms to sleep and settled in a small town.

Although Cheng Huai was very obedient, he could no longer hold it back after lying in his arms for two days. He flailed around, wanting to go down for a walk. Li Xizhi tried feeding him some fruits, but he refused to eat.

"I guess we'll rest for a while... Libu Prefecture is still a long way to go. "

By the time Li Xizhi descended, the sky was already dark, but there were still lights flickering in the town below him. He stopped to look and found that the people in the town were gathered in a group, holding up fire torches.

1. For Luoxia (落霞), "Luo" (落) means "to descend" and "xia"(霞) could mean either the "glow of sunrise or sunset". Since the context of "xia" here is vague, I translated Xiaguang (霞光, literal tl: light/glow of sunrise/sunset) as "Heavenly Glow". ☜




# Chapter 510: Situ Mo

Li Xizhi immediately sensed something was amiss, and stealthily approached while concealing his presence. He saw a group of villagers gathered around a low stone altar, where an old man in black stood, his face dark and sinister, holding a sword and muttering incessantly.

The villagers below began chanting as well, their voices growing louder and louder. Black mist spread across the altar, causing Li Xizhi to frown.

"A mere unrefined Qi Cultivator, yet he is putting on such a grand display!" Li Xizhi scoffed.

The black-robed old man had chaotic true essence and weak energy, a clear sign of his origins as a rogue cultivator. In the cultivation world of Yue State, such people were at the bottom of the hierarchy. Li Xizhi, being from a great sect, could see this clearly with just a glance.

Yin qi is everywhere... He must have acquired some kind of devil dao legacy and used it to deceive the villagers so he could conduct blood sacrifices.

As expected, the villagers below brought forward a young boy. The black-robed old man raised his sword, preparing to stab him in a ritual.

Li Xizhi watched on silently as the old man brought his sword down toward the boy, but when the blade touched the boy, it was as if it hit an iron wall—there was a sharp metallic clang that rang out, and the sword could not move any further.

A flash of doubt crossed the old man's face. He scanned the surroundings with his spiritual sense but could not detect anything. How could a rogue cultivator like him see through the concealment technique of someone as skilled as Li Xizhi?

Finding nothing, the old man trembled and called out in a shaky voice, "Which Senior... is playing a joke on this humble one?"

Rainbow light began to shimmer around Li Xizhi as he revealed himself above the altar, staring at the old man. The black-robed elder took one look at him and was instantly terrified. He fell to his knees, trembling as he said, "This humble one is Yuan Huzhong... Greetings to you, immortal of the exalted sect!"

Li Xizhi's hand, glowing with rainbow light, was about to strike him, but those words made him pause. Frowning, he asked, "You recognize my attire? You must be quite knowledgeable. Which Yuan Family do you belong to?"

Yuan Huzhong, who was shaking all over now, replied, "I am originally from the Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest Plain, though I have not returned in many years..."

So, he is truly from the Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest Plain!

Li Xizhi felt a bit awkward since this devil cultivator was somehow connected to his master, Yuan Tuan. In a deep voice, he scolded, "Coming from such a great family, how dare you engage in such filthy deeds! You have utterly disgraced the Yuan Family!"

With a flick of his hand, a stream of multicolored light appeared, swirling and flickering like a mirage. With a swish, it snatched away both the sword and the pouch from Yuan Huzhong's waist.

This technique, called Floating Light Gathering, was recorded in the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique and was a Grade Four spell. It was particularly effective at seizing dharma artifacts and treasures. The multicolored light swept over everything cleanly, leaving Yuan Huzhong trembling with cold terror.

The villagers below craned their necks, thinking Li Xizhi had acted against the old man. They immediately broke into wails, begging for mercy, leaving Li Xizhi puzzled.

Li Xizhi examined Yuan Huzhong and, confirming that he was indeed from the Yuan Family, decided to be patient.

"Explain yourself!" he demanded.

Just as Yuan Huzhong was about to speak, black winds suddenly whipped through the air. A massive creature, the size of a house and covered in feathers, descended with a booming laugh, calling out evilly, "Daoist Yuan! How is this year's blood offering?"

Li Xizhi's feet were already surrounded by rainbow light. He scanned the creature with his spiritual sense and quickly realized it was merely a Qi Cultivation Realm demon at the fourth heavenly layer—far weaker than him, who was in the sixth heavenly layer. Feeling confident, he stayed in place, studying the demon.

Yuan Huzhong, terrified, dared not reply. Instead, he shot the demon a look and muttered under his breath, "T-This... is a lord from the exalted Azure Pond Sect, Daoist Wu... Hurry up and pay your respects."

A member of the Azure Chi Devil Gate!

Daoist Wu was horrified, collapsing to the ground with a thud that shook the earth. His voice was muffled as he choked out, "This lowly demon greets the exalted immortal!"

Li Xizhi, someone who disliked unnecessary conflict, felt his head throb as the situation became more complicated. Waving his hand, he said, "I have important matters to attend to. Spare me trouble and explain everything quickly so I can be on my way!"

Yuan Huzhong hurriedly explained, "Lord, I truly am from the main branch of the Yuan Family, but my talent is lacking and I have only a single spiritual orifice... After thirty years of hard cultivation and many spirit resources, I have only reached the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

In his youth, Yuan Huzhong had been diligent, but his poor talent meant he had to rely on the favors of his elders to obtain cultivation resources. Over time, he exhausted those connections, and the Yuan Family no longer wished to pour resources into what they saw as a lost cause. Helpless, Yuan Huzhong left the family and wandered the world.

Continuing where he left off, Yuan Huzhong elaborated, "Later, I found a temple run by rogue cultivators... I received a few legacies, but my cultivation still stagnated, and I had no further breakthroughs. Disheartened, I passed through here and found an Embryonic Breathing Realm demon wreaking havoc, so I dealt with it."

"The villagers begged me for help, and I felt pity for them, so I stayed to protect them..." Yuan Huzhong laughed bitterly and added, "This area is near Mount Quanwu, a place where many demons pass through. They regularly come here to feast on humans. So, I pledged myself to a demon general and, in exchange for providing a special blood offering each year, the demons no longer harass the village."

He proudly pointed to the villagers below him and smiled. "When I first arrived here, this place had just over a thousand people... Now, fifty years have passed, and there are more than five thousand!"

Li Xizhi remained silent, glancing at the boy kneeling on the ground. The boy, his breath weak and uneven, clearly had been consuming medicine from a young age—likely the special blood offering that Yuan Huzhong mentioned. The child did not cry or make a fuss, remaining obedient.

Nearby, the demon trembled with fear upon hearing that Yuan Huzhong was a disciple of the devil gate, not daring to lift its head. Yuan Huzhong, after finishing his explanation, cautiously glanced at Li Xizhi, hesitating before adding, "The offerings to the immortal sect from this place... they have been supplied year after year without fail..."

Li Xizhi glanced once more at the villagers below and understood that what Yuan Huzhong said was likely true. The rainbow light in his hand flickered slightly as he responded, "I see."

He stood with his hands behind his back, silently and without any further interest in conversation. Then, in an instant, he soared away on the wind, his feet surrounded by swirling rainbow light, drifting off like an immortal being.

Yuan Huzhong wiped the cold sweat from his brow and collapsed to the ground with relief. He sighed toward the demon beside him, who was equally terrified and trembling, muttering, "Thank the heavens! Luckily, it was a disciple from the Azure Pond Sect... If it had been someone from the Yue Cultivating Sect, who is less tolerant, there would not have been any room for explanation. Not only would you and I have lost our lives, but even my great king would have been slain!"

Yuan Huzhong let out a sigh of relief and added, "If luck had truly been against us, what could we have done? If those sect disciples had slain the demon and left, these five thousand villagers would have been nothing but food for a horde of demons, after you and I were killed."

Li Xizhi soared away on the wind, feeling a slight heaviness in his heart. Although he knew such things were common in Jiangnan, this was the first time he had seen it with his own eyes. After hearing Yuan Huzhong's explanation, he realized he was powerless to change the situation.

At least it's better than overseas... After all, this land was once under the rule of an immortal mansion. Now, the immortal sects, out of caution or perhaps moral scruples, refrain from overt wickedness. Even the devil gates have to put on a false front... Some Dao lineages here still uphold certain principles.

Li Xizhi let out a self-deprecating chuckle. If he had been in Yuan Huzhong's position, he likely would have handled it the same way. He realized how foolish it had been to have thoughts of killing him earlier.

Li Xizhi had far too much on his mind regarding his family's pressures to indulge in any further pity. Soon, he cast the matter aside, flying through the area around Mount Quanwu. Suddenly, the jade pendant at his waist grew warm, emitting a soft white light.
𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

"Hmm?"

Li Xizhi was overjoyed and thought to himself, One of my clan's brothers or elders must be nearby!

Li Xijun and the others had been traveling through the mountains of the Quanwu range for several days now. With Kongheng leading the way, they had acquired a few spirit items and had encountered no Foundation Establishment Realm demons, and were merely wandering through the forest.

Li Xuanxuan and another cultivator were performing incantations and surveying the earth veins. After some time, they found a clue near a deep pool. Li Xijun then remarked, "Granduncle, according to the descriptions and techniques from the Chilling Snow Series, there should be a type of spirit water within this pool."

Li Xuanxuan, holding a bundle of mountain fruits, sorted through them and handed Li Xijun a plum before nodding slightly. After performing some calculations with a hand seal, he said quietly, "We may need to wait a few more days. The water vein runs deep, and it will not be easy to retrieve the spirit water quickly."

Li Xijun placed the fruit in his pouch and, along with Li Xuanxuan, continued casting spells, working together to draw out the spirit water. They alternated, one resting while the other maintained the spell. After about five or six days, a golden light finally appeared in the sky, descending rapidly.
𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

When the golden light landed, it transformed into a man dressed in radiant feathered robes, holding a golden ring. His aura was overwhelming, indicating that he had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. The moment he landed, the pressure from his presence made the group feel as though their faces were being cut by sharp blades.

The man glanced at the surface of the pool, his face expressionless, and he was clearly here for the spirit water.

He held the golden ring in his hand and had a rather handsome face. His clothing—with golden hooks, rings, and diamond-patterned robe—immediately gave away his identity as a disciple of the Golden Tang Gate.

"Greetings, Senior..." The Li Family members greeted, cupping their fists.

The Golden Tang Gate cultivator looked down on them arrogantly, his expression showing a hint of excitement. After glancing at the three of them, he drawled, "Where are you three from? This spirit water now belongs to the Golden Tang Gate."

Li Xuanxuan and Li Xijun exchanged glances, while Kongheng frowned deeply and retorted, "But we were here first..."

Li Xijun quickly interrupted him and pulled him back, replying politely, "We are from the Li Family of Qingdu Peak. Since Senior desires it, we will leave this pool to you."

"No." The man's smile was cold and mocking as he said sharply, "You will retrieve the spirit water for me before you leave."

Li Xuanxuan studied the man's face, finding it vaguely familiar. Then, he suddenly recalled that they had crossed paths years ago when he had sought out Kong Yu to help move a mountain, only to encounter this same arrogant Golden Tang Gate disciple.

"Situ Mo!"

This man had a notoriously bad temper. He had mocked Kong Yu mercilessly at the time, making fun of him for being from a small, insignificant family. Li Xuanxuan had not known the full story until then. Back then, Situ Mo had been at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm, but now, he had just entered the Foundation Establishment Realm.

This kind of person... is only relying on his family's connections!

Li Xuanxuan cursed inwardly. Situ Mo's face was full of contempt as he stared at Li Xuanxuan, with an expression betraying his intense dislike.

Li Xuanxuan quickly realized, Damn it! He recognizes me... I have been dragged into this because of the Kong Family... But what kind of grudge does he have against them for him to hate them this much?

Sure enough, when Li Xijun politely responded, Situ Mo only sneered and said in a low voice, "I remember your family... Years ago, my elders collected qi in your clan's territory! They lured a demon sparrow, causing quite a mess. Your ancestors were mortals back then, they probably even bowed before my elders back then."

Li Xijun had thought at first that this man was merely a spoiled and rich young master, but after hearing that remark, he immediately realized that this was an enemy. The polite smile disappeared from his face, now replaced by a cold expression.

Li Xuanxuan, though filled with anger, was even more perplexed.

Where does this young man's deep hatred come from? This must be about more than the Profound Peak Gate...

He truly could not understand where Situ Mo's deep hatred stemmed from, and the man's words were venomous and harsh, fueling the fire of Li Xuanxuan's anger. The elder's face had already darkened with displeasure.

Situ Mo coldly eyed Li Xuanxuan and spoke in a low voice, "That day we met in the wilderness—if I had known that you hideous old thing were from the Li Family, I would have killed you on the spot... you..."

He gritted his teeth and continued viciously, "The An Family and the Lu Family made deals with a tiger, and in the end, your Li Family wiped them out. It was indeed satisfying to watch! But because of your family's deeds, my mother fell into despair and took her own life... Now, I have waited long enough for this day, to make your family suffer as my mother did!"

Li Xijun stood frozen in shock, while Kongheng's eyes widened in disbelief. Li Xuanxuan's mind buzzed as one image after another flashed before him, finally settling on a face that had long worried Li Xiangping and Li Tongya...

"Ji Dengqi!" Li Xuanxuan blurted out, "You... you are the son of that Ji Family woman!"

"Haha! Exactly..."

Situ Mo had not even finished his sentence when Li Xijun, having already understood the situation, grabbed Kongheng's sleeve and, in a flash of red light, launched himself into the sky, fleeing at great speed. Even Situ Mo was briefly stunned before he roared in anger, "Just like Li Tongya's spawn! Crafty like a snake!"

Kongheng and Li Xuanxuan were still in shock, but as they realized what was happening, they prepared to follow. Just then, a golden light rose around the pool, sealing the area and trapping them inside.

Situ Mo sneered at Li Xijun's retreating figure and said, "Did you really think I was talking all this time for nothing?"

In the distance, Li Xijun, who was enveloped in red light, was just about to break through the formation when a golden weapon, lying in ambush, shot forward, piercing him straight through the chest and pinning him to the ground.

Blood splattered as the teenager fell to the earth with a heavy thud. The sight sent chills down Li Xuanxuan's spine. His mana-enhanced sight allowed him to see clearly as a bloodstained plum fruit rolled out of the boy's chest pocket, bouncing twice on the ground.

"The little one ran fast, but he fell to the Dinglin Piercer, and died a bit sooner!" A flash of pleasure crossed Situ Mo's face before he turned his attention to the two remaining men.

His voice was icy as he said, "You old fool, you may have some experience, but my mother was Ji Dengyu! The head of the Ji Family back then, Ji Dengqi, was my uncle! When Lu Sisi and An Zheyan slaughtered my Ji Family, they thought my father had been killed, but they did not know my mother was already carrying me in her womb..."

"I thought you would return the same way, but you kept twisting and turning, ending up in Mount Quanwu. I searched for so long, and now that I've found you, I won't let you all leave!"

His expression was cruel and ferocious, but there was a twisted joy in his voice, the kind that only comes from vengeance.

Laughing maniacally, he said coldly, "I know how ruthless the Li Family is, and Li Tongya was a Foundation Establishment Realm sword cultivator, so my mother never dared speak of this, raising me in secret... But now that I have established an immortal foundation, it is time to settle this grudge!"

Li Xuanxuan was in utter shock. His mind raced, his eyes reddening with anger as he tried to explain through gritted teeth, "The destruction of the Ji Family was due to the An and Lu families seizing the two mountains—it had nothing to do with my family!"

"Nothing to do with you?" Situ Mo sneered.

Since he was not in any hurry and felt certain of his victory, he could not resist arguing back. His voice filled with hatred as he said, "My Ji Family had planted someone close to Lu Yuanlu, and that loose-tongued fool was consumed with jealousy over Li Tongya! He revealed everything! Who do you think you are fooling?"

That idiot! It was that idiot all along!

Li Xuanxuan felt an icy chill sweep over him, making it hard to breathe. His chest burned with rage, and all he could think about was Li Xijun outside. The wound on his face began to crack, revealing a faint golden pill beneath.

Blood began to flow from his seven orifices, and the six old wounds on his body burst open, spraying blood everywhere. His eyes bulged, and he was rendered speechless.

Suddenly, a hand rested on his shoulder, emitting a soft, warm golden light that quickly calmed his emotions and slowly healed his wounds.

Kongheng, with a slight bow of his head, spoke gently, "Elder, you are still not recovered yet, please quell your anger. This humble monk is here... there is nothing for you to worry about."




# Chapter 512: Battle with Situ Mo

Boom!

The golden formation trembled faintly, shaking the forest and causing leaves to fall like rain. A young man in white lay on the ground, facing the sky.

Boom!

Li Xijun listened silently, confirming that Situ Mo had already engaged in battle with Kongheng and had no time to focus on anything else. Only then did he press his hands against the ground and sit up.

White light flowed through Li Xijun's eyes, but there was no sign of pain. He gathered his mana in his hands and, with a steady motion, grasped the radiant, golden Dinglin Piercer and slowly pulled it out of his chest.

The talisman he received before was the Radiant Snow Pine Ridge, which kept him calm at all times. Though the situation had been dire, and the Dinglin Piercer had struck quickly, Li Xijun had not reacted slowly either.

His eyes, capable of piercing illusions and seeing through falsehoods, allowed him to calculate the trajectory of the Dinglin Piercer quickly. Using the River Crossing Torrential Step, he skillfully dodged its most dangerous points. Although the weapon had pierced through his body, it had not struck a vital area, leaving him with only a wound.

As talisman qi circulated through his body, he pulled the piercer out without flinching and began to wonder, "Even so, this Dinglin Piercer is a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact. It seems really weak... Even if I avoided the vital point, it should have left me seriously wounded. Could it be that Kongheng had intervened...?"

While pondering this, the piercer was fully removed from his body. He wiped away the blood, and examined the weapon. The Dinglin Piercer was about seven chi long, covered in ridges, and shining with golden light. It struggled in Li Xijun's hands, trying to break free and fly into the sky. He had to use considerable effort to just hold onto it.

After sealing the piercer with several Spirit Sealing Techniques, Li Xijun was finally able to free his hands to heal himself. He applied some ointment on the wound, swallowed a pill, and sighed with relief as his strength recovered by sixty percent.

The Dinglin Piercer fluttered weakly in the air before falling to the ground, trembling slightly. Li Xijun's thoughts raced as he pondered to himself, This is trouble... Situ Mo is a direct descendant of the Golden Tang Sect. I am not sure if Kongheng will be able to handle him...

The Quanwu Mountain Range, located in the center of Yue State, was several days' journey from Moongaze Lake, the Xiao Family, or the Profound Peak Gate, making it impossible to call for aid.

Li Xijun turned back to the golden formation, and white light appeared in his eyes. The brilliant light of the formation gradually blurred, revealing the scene within it.

BOOM!

Kongheng was wielding a bronze monk's staff, emitting golden light to resist Situ Mo's dharma artifact. His mana light was soft yet immense, while Situ Mo's was sharp and intense. The clash of their golden lights echoed with thunderous force.

As Li Xijun pushed his talisman qi to the limit, a figure cloaked in the mysterious spirit mist within the formation was also revealed.

"That's... Second Uncle?!" Li Xijun gasped.

The black-robed middle-aged man stood cautiously at the edge of the formation, his face dark. In his hand, a green-white sword light flickered, growing stronger with each passing moment as he waited for a flaw in Situ Mo's defense.

"So, it was him who intervened to protect me!" Li Xijun let out a breath of relief, realizing why the Dinglin Piercer's power had been so weak. He felt more at ease now and confidently began casting layers of spells, keeping the peculiar dharma artifact pinned under his foot.

————

Within the golden formation, Kongheng steadied Li Xuanxuan, showing no signs of panic. As the formation activated, Li Yuanjiao's voice had already reached Kongheng.

Kongheng's surprise stemmed not only from Situ Mo's revelations but also from the unexpected timing of Li Yuanjiao's intervention.

With Li Yuanjiao silently intervening, Kongheng no longer had to worry about Li Xijun. Though the blow Li Xijun suffered seemed severe, Kongheng, with his knowledge as a Buddhist cultivator, did not consider it a serious concern.

As a sharp golden light surged toward him, Kongheng used his monk's staff to repel Situ Mo's attacks, silently reflecting to himself, He's indeed cautious, following us all the way here...

Although Kongheng had some tricks up his sleeve, more than enough for survival but not for killing, he was not afraid of Situ Mo and remained confident that he could protect both himself and Li Xuanxuan.

Yet, he still sighed at Li Yuanjiao's caution, thinking to himself, He was worried about alarming Situ Mo, so he even deceived his own people... Since Senior Xuanxuan hasn't noticed anything, it's even less likely that Situ Mo would suspect a thing!

Situ Mo tested with two attacks, but the monk before him remained as calm as still water, his defense unyielding like an immovable mountain.

Situ Mo sneered and taunted, "Found yourself a bald monk to play guard dog, eh?"

Situ Mo understood that the monk's methods were strange and was careful not to underestimate him. Three golden shields floated around him, covering him completely while he held a saber, watching for an opening. After a moment's thought, he performed a hand seal and muttered, "Come!"

Outside the formation, the Dinglin Piercer began to struggle violently, thrashing on the ground. Li Xijun had long been prepared for this and had covered the weapon with spirit-sealing talismans. He stomped down on it with his foot, brought his fingers together, and released a flash of cold light.

Grade Four spell, Slaughter Jun Kui Light!

True to its reputation as one of the Li Family's highest-graded spells, the white light burst forth, releasing a chilling energy that froze the Dinglin Piercer solid, cutting off the flow of mana and suppressing it completely.

Inside the formation, Situ Mo's expression changed. Li Xijun, only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, should not have been able to resist his dharma artifact, and should have already been killed by the Dinglin Piercer. Now, with the weapon unresponsive, he felt deep unease growing within him, sensing things were slipping out of his control.

Yet, Li Xuanxuan's earlier behavior had seemed completely genuine, and Kongheng's shock had also been real. Situ Mo, who had grown up surviving on his wits, could see through pretense, and now found himself hesitant and unsure.

Meanwhile, Li Xuanxuan, seeing Situ Mo's hesitation, began to piece things together based on Kongheng's demeanor. A hint of relief crossed his face, which only made him look more pleased in Situ Mo's eyes, adding to the latter's irritation.

Situ Mo's eyes flickered suddenly as he made up his mind. He pulled out a talisman from his robe, clasped it between his hands, and began to cast a spell.

Kongheng, naturally, could not just stand by idly. He quickly raised his bronze staff, focusing on protecting Li Xuanxuan from afar by disrupting Situ Mo with bursts of golden light. However, his defensive nature made it hard to break through Situ Mo's golden shields.

Situ Mo cast a mocking glance at Kongheng before shaking his wrist and releasing six streams of light that landed on his own body. The tiny streams glimmered over his acupoints—Zanzhu, Tongziliao, and Chengqi—gradually lighting up his eyes with a golden glow.[1]

In this life-and-death confrontation, Situ Mo was not foolish enough to announce his techniques aloud. However, Li Yuanjiao, who was still observing from the shadows, had read the Spirit Eye Perception manual and recognized these critical eye acupoints. He realized Situ Mo had sensed that something was amiss.

What a shame! His dharma artifact is formidable, and he hasn't shown any openings!

Knowing he could not stay hidden much longer without being discovered, Li Yuanjiao seized this fleeting opportunity. His sword flew out of its sheath as he raced toward Situ Mo, executing the Celestial Moon Slash technique.

Clang!

A sharp green-white light filled the air. Situ Mo's spell was interrupted, yet he seemed more pleased than surprised. The golden saber at his waist, which had been accumulating power, suddenly shot forward as he laughed.

"I knew it!"

Li Yuanjiao's sword arc shifted, shattering Situ Mo's golden shield, but was met by the saber qi he had been gathering for a long time. Internally, Li Yuanjiao couldn't help but admire Situ Mo's slyness.

What a cunning man!

Situ Mo's ability to stop his own spell midway and secretly charge his saber qi showed that he had anticipated Li Yuanjiao's move. It was possible that Situ Mo had never cultivated perception techniques seriously and had only acted to lure out a hidden enemy.

"It really is you, Li Yuanjiao!"

Though Situ Mo had forced Li Yuanjiao to reveal himself, the power of the Celestial Moon Slash technique still exceeded his expectations. His saber qi only managed to block it for a moment before shattering like brittle wood.

1. Acupoint locations: Zanzhu is at the start of the eyebrow, Tongziliao is near the tear duct, and Chengqi is near the outer corner of the eye. ☜

Situ Mo shouted, "Ha!"

Before the words even left his mouth, three golden shields materialized before him while he instantly moved several zhang away, spitting out a small, round red pill. The pill spun once in the air and dissolved into smoke.

"The techniques of the Golden Tang Gate!" Li Yuanjiao sighed as he watched. Situ Mo had not yet had time to feel relief when he felt a cold sensation behind him. A grayish-green serpent dragon materialized, its jaws snapping toward his neck.

Clang!

Li Yuanjiao struck aside the three golden shields, but the serpent dragon was blocked by the light emitted from Situ Mo's dharma robes. Situ Mo quickly formed a hand seal, sending out a burst of golden light that shattered the dragon.

With a venomous tone, he growled, "Some Celestial Moon Slash technique... hardly impressive!"

But before he could even finish speaking, three more streams of silver light darted toward him, gleaming brilliantly like the moon. They spun and danced in the air, weaving through the gaps between his three golden shields, aiming for his upper, middle, and lower body.

Situ Mo was startled, and golden patterns appeared on his hands as he tried to grab the incoming light, but his grasp closed on nothing but air.

The three sword lights moved too swiftly, slipping between his defenses like snakes slithering inside his robes. Unable to cast another spell in time, Situ Mo could do nothing as the sword lights struck his body.

His golden robe once again emitted light, releasing a surge of white mist that dissolved the three sword lights that were aimed at him, forcing Li Yuanjiao to withdraw his attack in vain.

Situ Mo let out a sigh of relief, now drenched in sweat, and spat sarcastically, "Well... well... quite the sword technique!"

At the same time, deep green serpent dragons rose beneath Li Yuanjiao's feet while sword qi churned in his hands. Inwardly, he felt helpless.

I'm afraid I won't be able to take him down... My mastery of the Threefold Moonlight is lacking...agile but not powerful enough. What a pity.

Situ Mo stepped forward, his hand performing seals as he cautiously engaged Li Yuanjiao in back-and-forth attacks. Sword qi and saber qi clashed, producing resounding explosions.

Kongheng, not skilled in offensive techniques, stood nearby, his monk's staff emitting golden light within a one-zhang radius around him. Though he used the golden light to strike at Situ Mo, it merely distracted him for a moment, failing to cause any real harm.

The Golden Tang Gate has been in Xu State for years, once a major power that frequently clashed with Azure Pond... Even though they've declined, their foundation runs deep and they're hard to deal with.

Kongheng knew it wasn't just the Golden Tang Gate—even Situ Mo himself was no easy opponent.

Li Yuanjiao had missed his chance for an overwhelming strike, and with his most powerful sword technique already used, he found himself unable to gain the upper hand.

Sure enough, Situ Mo scattered two of Li Yuanjiao's sword qi with a wave of his hand and sneered.

"Is that all your family's swordsmanship has to offer? You were lucky enough to have a sword immortal as an ancestor, which barely elevated your family to a prestigious clan... You are nothing but a bunch of opportunists."

While mocking him, Situ Mo's hands did not slow down. He raised his Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact to fend off Li Yuanjiao, rapidly forming six seals in succession. Finally, he clasped his hands together, his ring finger hooking over the middle finger while his index fingers crossed, leaving the other three fingers pressed together.

With a loud bang, golden light burst from Situ Mo's palm, forming a small dagger about the size of a finger that darted into the air, circling once before streaking toward Li Yuanjiao with the speed and force of lightning, shrieking as it cut through the air.

Situ Mo knew all about the Li Family, but Li Yuanjiao knew little about him. Feeling an intense sense of danger, Li Yuanjiao's back went cold. Quickly, he slapped his pouch and summoned a large brown shield—Six-Stone Cloud Plate!

The golden saber came too fast—Li Yuanjiao didn't even have time to retrieve a talisman. He poured all his mana into the shield, and the deep green serpent dragon coiled around it protectively.

BOOM!

"Ugh..."

A tremendous force hit his arm, and the Six-Stone Cloud Plate shuddered under the impact. A sharp pain shot through his wrist as the golden light pierced through, forcing him to retreat with gritted teeth.

The Six-Stone Cloud Plate let out a mournful sound as a bloody hole appeared in Li Yuanjiao's wrist. He had no time to assess the injury before the golden saber, having circled behind him, streaked back toward his heart.

Situ Mo, after releasing the golden saber, took only a moment to catch his breath before charging forward with his sword. He swung down with a sweep of golden light, while the Six-Stone Cloud Plate, now with a small hole in it, struggled to block the cold, piercing advance of the golden saber.

Li Yuanjiao spun around, drawing his Qingche Sword to parry Situ Mo's strike, barely managing to deflect the blow. The Six-Stone Cloud Plate shot upward to block the golden saber.

Creak...

Though the golden saber was not as terrifying as when it first appeared, it still caused Li Yuanjiao to stumble backward. He retreated several steps, shrouding himself in Profound Patterned Spirit Mist, trying to put some distance between himself and the deadly golden saber that coiled like a viper, ready to strike again.

Hum!

Li Yuanjiao braced himself, clutching a talisman and preparing to counterattack. But just as the golden saber was about to strike again, Kongheng recited a mantra, and the saber suddenly froze midair.

Situ Mo's face twisted with rage as he shouted out angrily, "You damned monk! Must you interfere?"

With Kongheng's intervention, Li Yuanjiao had enough time to activate his Profound Patterned Bottle, concealing his presence and disappearing from sight.

Situ Mo immediately grew cautious. Li Yuanjiao was no ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator—if caught off guard, he could be dangerous.

Scanning the area with a venomous gaze, Situ Mo quickly performed another hand seal. The golden saber obediently returned to his hand and vanished.

I should've mastered a perception technique... Wasting time on this Golden Blaze Saber cost me. Otherwise, I could've killed all three of them today!

Situ Mo exhaled deeply. Knowing he had missed his chance, he was not willing to risk further conflict and exhaust himself.

Then, a sudden sense of impending doom gnawed at his heart.

This is not good...

He did not waste time on empty threats, simply raising his hand. In the forest, the formation flags rose from the ground, returning to his grasp as the golden formation vanished.

Golden light surged beneath his feet, and several golden shields floated around him for protection. Tall and imposing, he spoke with a cold, ominous tone.

"We will settle this another time!"

Before his voice had even fully faded away, Situ Mo had transformed into a streak of golden light and flew away at incredible speed, disappearing over the horizon in mere moments.

"Granduncle!" Li Xijun hurried into the formation, calling out twice.

Li Xuanxuan quickly pulled him into an embrace, carefully looking him over before letting out a long breath of relief.

"You nearly scared me to death!"

Li Yuanjiao's face was pale, the glow of the Qingche Sword in his hand dimming as he sealed away the remaining sword intent. The hole in his wrist was large, revealing a glimpse of bone beneath.

Without saying a word, he summoned a stream of water from the nearby pool, filling the wound before placing a hand over it, making it appear fully healed.

Kongheng, knowing this was merely a temporary fix, gently advised, "These wounds cannot be left untreated. Please use some healing pills and medicine to heal it as soon as you can, or it may hinder your future cultivation."

Grateful for Kongheng's help, Li Yuanjiao's expression softened as he responded, "Thank you for saving me, Master Monk."

Meanwhile, Li Xuanxuan, having checked Li Xijun's wounds, rushed to his son's side and carefully examined him. But with Li Yuanjiao's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, the elder could not tell how serious the injuries were. He could only mutter anxiously, "Oh dear! Oh dear..."

Li Yuanjiao glanced at him in surprise, the corner of his mouth curving slightly upward for a brief moment, before turning back with a sigh of regret.

"It is a pity... That man had quite the skill. I could not gain the upper hand."

"Second Uncle!"

Li Xijun smiled and pulled out a gleaming golden artifact from his storage pouch, presenting it with both hands as he bowed his head respectfully.

"...That may not be the case."




# Chapter 514: Reunion

Li Yuanjiao took the Dinglin Piercer from his hand. The Golden Tang Gate favored techniques for piercers, daggers, and sabers. This Dinglin Piercer had a peculiar appearance and was about six cun long, resembling a thin stick with sharpened ends, designed for penetrating surfaces with precision.[1]

Gazing at Li Xijun, Li Yuanjiao frowned and spoke in a deep voice.

"We were fighting in the formation before... You should have left early instead of staying here. If I failed to defeat Situ Mo, at least you could still get away safely."

Kongheng was present, and Li Xijun did not dare claim he could see through the situation in the formation. So, he simply nodded in response.

Li Yuanjiao's expression darkened as he instructed the others to bring forth the spirit water that was just within their reach. He whispered to Kongheng, "I've been following behind all of you this whole time, so I know Situ Mo did not follow us all the way here. He flew straight to the edge of this pool... and seems to know that we are here!"

Kongheng released his mantra and replied, "Are you suggesting that... the man is acting on a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's order, Benefactor?"

Li Yuanjiao's expression shifted as he considered the possibility. He was about sixty percent certain about it. Earlier, he had used the Qingche Sword's intent, aiming to end the man's life for good. However, he quickly vanished. This made him even more convinced of his speculation.

"It may not be an order... The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Golden Tang Gate hasn't been seen in a long time, and most of its territory has fallen under the control of the Yue Cultivating Sect. It's possible some force bears a grudge against my Li Family and is secretly aiding him," Li Yuanjiao said, his voice grave.

Kongheng fell silent for a moment before murmuring, "Maybe... it's the Wrathful Dao lineage..."

As they spoke, the pool of water before them began to roll as if boiling, slowly parting to reveal a stream of white, crystal-clear spirit water that leaped out. It spun in a circle before filling up the jade bottle in Li Xijun's hand.

Li Xijun's face was still somewhat pale, but he quickly exclaimed with joy, "Granduncle! It's Pure Essence Spirit Water!"

Li Xuanxuan hurried forward to take a closer look before nodding in approval.

"It is indeed the Pure Essence Spirit Water! With this, more people can benefit from the Grade Three Spirit Eye Perception at home!"

This spirit water would significantly aid those who cultivated the Spirit Eye Perception. After mastering the technique, he would also be able to find an explanation for any peculiar phenomena he encountered.

Li Xijun carefully stored it away as Li Yuanjiao urged, "We shouldn't linger! Let's leave quickly."

The group obeyed and rode the wind as they took to the skies. Li Yuanjiao felt a mix of worry and unease when suddenly the jade pendants at their waists illuminated, emitting a gentle light.

"Huh?"

They all paused in surprise. Li Xijun asked curiously, "Could it be that Auntie was worried and followed us?"

"No..." Li Yuanjiao shook his head. He had specifically asked Li Qinghong to stay behind and watch over the family.

While he pondered this, a mysterious spirit mist enveloped him, momentarily hiding him from view.
𝙛𝒓𝓮𝙚𝔀𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Just then, a burst of colorful light approached the group, revealing a young man riding a rainbow. He wore a black feathered robe, his black hair fastened with a jade crow. He held a swaddled bundle in his arms.

He laughed heartily and greeted, "Xizhi greets elders and brothers! I was just wondering who was here!"

Li Xuanxuan nearly jumped with joy, exclaiming, "It's my Zhi'er!"

Li Xijun blinked in surprise. He focused intently on the newcomer for three breaths, using the white qi in his eyes to detect any traces of illusion. When he found none, he gasped almost incredulously, "It's really Third Brother!"

Seeing Li Xuanxuan rush forward, Li Xizhi's face lit up with shock as he asked, "That's... Grandfather?"

He pulled Li Xuanxuan closer, his voice filled with disbelief as he continued, "It's only been twenty years since I left; why have you aged so much, Grandfather? This is..."

Li Xuanxuan, now just over eighty, appeared to be well over a hundred years old. Li Xizhi stared at him, dumbfounded. Li Xuanxuan waved his hand dismissively, then looked at his grandson, beaming with pride as he praised, "Good... Good!"

Li Xijun, who was standing behind, stifled a laugh before stepping forward and cupping his fist.

"Xijun greets Third Brother!"

"Y-Y-You!"

Li Xizhi's heart swelled with emotion, his eyes glistening with tears as he smiled and said, "My good younger brother! It's been twenty years since we last met, and you look like an immortal now!"

The two young men exchanged glances, each filled with a multitude of unspoken thoughts, unsure of how to begin. Li Xuanxuan quickly pulled Li Xizhi over, gesturing to the child in his arms as he asked, "T-This... this is?"

Li Xizhi chuckled.

"Li Chenghuai."

"Ah!"

"Oh my!" Li Xuanxuan's face lit up with joy instantly. But before he could say another word, the mysterious spirit mist beside them dissipated. Li Yuanjiao, clad in a black robe, could no longer contain himself.

His face flushed as he scolded, "Why didn't you write to your family about such an important matter, boy?!"

Li Xizhi was taken aback, allowing Li Xuanxuan to take Li Chenghuai from his arms. Despite being scolded by his father, he felt a mix of happiness and sorrow as he exclaimed, "Father!"

Li Yuanjiao raised an eyebrow and scrutinized him for a long moment. The brilliance of the rainbow light and the shimmer of the feather robe danced across his face. Finally, he uttered two words in a hoarse voice.

"Not bad."

Having left home at the tender age of ten to journey into the Azure Pond Sect, Li Xizhi had not seen his father in twenty years.

Li Yuanjiao's letters had always been serious and solemn; he had never spoken to him like he was his child. Hearing his father's words now brought tears to Li Xizhi's eyes as he said, "I have walked on thin ice in Azure Pond for twenty years, striving to live up to my family's trust!"

Silence enveloped the family as Li Yuanjiao gently stroked his back without a word. Li Xizhi quickly composed himself, wiping his face and smiling.

"I've received a mission from the sect to protect Libu Prefecture, which is just up ahead! Please, come with me and rest for a while there."

He glanced at Li Xijun, noticing that his eighth brother looked somewhat pale.

"This is..."

"Just a scratch," Li Xijun reassured him.

Li Xizhi frowned and rummaged through his storage pouch, producing several jade bottles filled with high-quality medicine.

"Take these quickly! Come with me to rest and heal your injuries... You shouldn't delay this!" he urged.

The group exchanged glances, agreeing to his suggestion as they headed north together. Li Xizhi inquired about the injury, and Li Xijun recounted the encounter with Situ Mo.

Hearing this, Li Xizhi's frown deepened.

"I know of this man! Situ Mo is one of the top three disciples from this generation of the Golden Tang Gate. He has a domineering temperament and a notorious reputation."

"However..." His expression turned decisive as he continued, "Based on Eighth Brother's description, this man is definitely far from ordinary. Despite his arrogance, he is not easy to deal with. We should find an opportunity to eliminate him!"

Li Yuanjiao cradled Li Chenghuai, carefully looking at the baby's face with a thoughtful expression as he remarked softly, "That person came straight to us. He either has a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator backing him or has received some critical information. If he were to die, the Golden Tang Gate would surely know and it would lead to trouble."

He voiced his speculation with a hint of doubt in his tone, "Back then, Situ Mo's lineage was defeated. It was rumored that the entire lineage was destroyed, prompting the elders to unite against the Ji Family. Given Situ Mo's appearance, I fear those rumors may not be true."

Li Xijun nodded, coughing lightly as he inferred, "This individual possesses many treasures and a deep mastery of spells. He likely has a powerful backer within Golden Tang Gate, and he doesn't seem to be alone..."

1. Lord have mercy on me, the author is very inconsistent about this weapon. When it first appeared, it was described as a "golden sword" that "pinned/nailed" Li Xijun to the ground in the raws. Then in a previous chapter, it was described as a weapon about seven chi long (about 233cm long). Now in this chapter, it is described as a "thin stick with sharpened ends" about six cun long (20 cm long). I have revised these chapters a few times before publishing them but I am still unsure if this is a 233 cm or 20 cm weapon due to another future chapter. I can't imagine Li Xijun pulling out a 233 cm long weapon, I can't imagine him being pinned to the ground by a 20 cm long weapon either. So I have decided to translate this as it is in the raws. Maybe it could shapeshift? ☜

Li Xizhi recalled the records he had read in the sect and said softly, "I have studied Golden Tang Gate thoroughly. There are many secrets revolving around it. He had probably joined the Azure Pond after his lineage was destroyed because he had no other choice... It's no surprise for them to raise an orphan to preserve the lineage. Situ Mo should be the son of Situ Yi. As the survivor of his lineage, it's understandable that he would be valued."

Li Xuanxuan interjected quietly, "If that's the case, he will be even more difficult to deal with. If we openly kill him, we risk inciting a furious retaliation from Golden Tang Gate. It would be best to devise a plan..."

Li Xuanxuan's implication was clear, and Li Yuanjiao had his own opinions. Though the family preferred to keep a low profile, they were never hesitant. The appearance of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator did not instill fear or impatience; rather, they contemplated the ways they could deal with him discreetly.

Troubled, Li Xuanxuan murmured, "But we can't confront him directly... Even if Master Monk and your siblings join forces, they can only stand a chance to take him down. Besides, we don't know how many trump cards he has up his sleeve. As a direct descendant of Golden Tang, he's bound to have many life-saving artifacts!"

Everyone fell silent, lost in their thoughts as they arrived at Libu Prefecture, where rolling hills and various villages peppered the landscape. Li Xizhi illuminated a jade talisman, infusing it with mana as he instructed his family, "Wait a moment."

After a brief pause, they spotted two figures riding the wind toward them. Both appeared to be at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, more mature and possessed an air of grace as if they had been raised in luxury.

They stopped before the group as one of them asked respectfully, "May I ask which of you is the envoy of the immortal sect?"

Li Xizhi tossed the jade token over to them and replied softly, "Qingdu Li Xizhi of Qingsui Peak... My master is Yuan Tuan, from the Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest!"

After hearing these words, the two men immediately grasped Li Xizhi's background. They bowed their heads respectfully and said, "Greetings, my lord! Please follow us... The helpers in the market are ready for your inspection..."

Li Xizhi waved his hand dismissively and replied, "No hurry, let them wait for now... These are my family members; they were attacked by bandits on the road and suffered some minor injuries. Please take care of them first. Arrange for the best spirit medicine and put the expenses on my account."

The two men quickly replied, "You must be joking, my lord... We can't possibly put the expenses on your account! We'll handle that right away!"

Li Xizhi smiled as he said, "I insist."

The two exchanged glances, their expressions shifting to one of obedience as they stammered, "Y-Yes... understood..."

Li Xizhi had no intention of leaving anything behind here that could be used against him in the future. He was not a direct descendant of the Chi Family and had not aligned himself with any faction within the clan, so he could not afford to exploit the situation without hesitation.

What a grand display!

Li Xijun and Li Xuanxuan looked at each other before following one of the attendants downstairs. The old man turned to Li Xuanxuan, a look of uncertainty crossing his face.

"Have we met before, Senior?"

Li Xuanxuan smiled and replied, "I once ran a small store at Cloud Crowned Peak."

"Oh... oh! I was in charge of that place back then!" the old man exclaimed, recognition dawning on him.

As the old man recalled the past, he paused awkwardly. Li Xuanxuan utilized a secret technique to communicate quietly, "I remember those two... Back then, my family wasn't a clan yet, and I was selling talismans. They came to my store before... and were full of arrogance! But now..."

Li Xuanxuan could not help but snicker inwardly. The old man soon presented several spirit items. Li Yuanjiao selected a few inexpensive ones and said in a deep voice, "I'll take some time to rest in seclusion and prepare to depart in a few days."

Li Xijun nodded and followed him into seclusion. Meanwhile, Li Xuanxuan remained in the hall, dealing with the man's flattery, thinking to himself, "Azure Pond Sect's disciples... are truly cool!"

————

Li Family, Wutu Peak.

Li Ximing guided the flame in the furnace gently. It leaped into his palm and turned into Long Marching Fire Essence, and he opened his mouth, swallowing the flame into his belly.

"It's been a while since I reached the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm!"

He had stabilized his cultivation over the past few days and found the opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, entering the late stage and now becoming a powerful asset of the Li Family. He was another step closer to the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Meng Zhuoyun, who was standing nearby, was half undressed, revealing her snow-white skin. She lounged lazily on the ground, supporting herself with her elbows. In her left hand, she held a slender brush, while the other hand pressed down on a portrait.

She appeared quite relaxed, adding strokes to her artwork from time to time. Her feet were high up in the air, half of her body basking in the sun, her delicate skin glowing and her waist slender.

Li Ximing loosened the collar of his robe, rolling up his sleeves to reveal his own snow-white skin before pulling her into an embrace.

Meng Zhuoyun groaned as he turned her to face him, her brush momentarily forgotten.

"You've made another breakthrough... With your talent, it's no wonder the Li Family keeps a close eye on you," she remarked softly.

Li Ximing was usually quiet during intimate moments, but Meng Zhuoyun was always chattering. Her red lips and pearly whites glinted in the sunlight like blood-red jade as she spoke, captivating Li Ximing's attention.

"Don't seek revenge. He's dead already; just stay in here and live a peaceful life," he murmured.

"Hm?" Meng Zhuoyun exhaled softly, her cheeks flushing slightly.

Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she teased him, "What? Be your cauldron for life..?"

"What nonsense are you spouting?"

Li Ximing brushed a wet strand of hair from her forehead, revealing her smooth forehead. He rarely offered advice but now said with tenderness, "It's not a bad life for you... Your ex-husband was only with you for half a year due to a matchmaker's arrangement. Is he stronger than me?"

A trace of sadness crossed Meng Zhuoyun's face as she replied softly, "You are a genius; he can't possibly compare to you."

"That's right. Since you don't have any strong feelings for him, what's the point of clinging to revenge...?"

Li Ximing was about to offer more advice when his thoughts shifted abruptly.

This woman has a rare talent for alchemy. If she joins my family, her cultivation will accelerate year after year. On top of that, I won't have to waste my time refining those Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm pills! It's a win-win situation!

"You're right, I didn't spend that much time with him... I only married him because it was arranged by the matchmaker," she replied, gasping for breath.

Her tone changed as she continued softly, "But he treated me like a person..."

Her soulful eyes locked onto his as she gently explained, "He was an intelligent man, but had no powerful background. He wasn't exceptional and the Foundation Establishment Realm was beyond his reach. Naturally, he couldn't compare to you... but he treated me like a human being, unlike you... You never show me any sincerity."

Li Ximing froze for a moment, staring into her eyes, which had suddenly regained their clarity amidst the haze of pleasure and intoxication.

"You treat me like a dog, like a tool... like an object. When I screamed in pain, you merely coaxed me. Once your needs are met, you cast me aside. I can only regain some dignity once you're happy..." she added with a hint of bitterness.

Li Ximing did not respond to her. But instead, he strangled her. Both of them groaned at the same time—one of pain and one of pleasure.

Li Ximing took a few moments to compose himself before casting a Purifying Spell to clean himself up.

"The pills needed today are Tranquility, Qi Nourishment, and Mind Calming. Don't forget to refine them," he instructed softly.

After saying that, he turned away without looking at her expression. Meng Zhuoyun, too weary to clean up herself, laid on her back for a moment before turning over to retrieve her half-wet painting. She picked up her brush and added a few more strokes.

The black ink melted away, leaving a finger-sized blotch on the paper. As Meng Zhuoyun sat up naked, beads of sweat glistened on her snow-white skin, rolling down the delicate curves of her legs.

She hung the painting up and scrutinized it closely. It depicted Li Ximing sitting comfortably in a large chair with her standing beside him, both smiling sweetly.

"Heh..."

She let out a lingering cold laugh that sounded almost like a groan. The pale blue orchid in her hair shimmered in the sunlight.




# Chapter 516: The Secret Of Spells And Techniques

Li Xizhi casually navigated through the bustling market, taking a moment to visit the courtyard where his grandfather, Li Xuanxuan, was diligently sketching with a talisman brush dipped in spirit ink.

Having drawn talismans for over seventy years, the old man could draw them perfectly even with his eyes closed. Without stopping his hand, he raised his gray eyebrows and glanced at Li Xizhi. A smile broke across his face as he said, "You're here, Zhi'er."

Li Xizhi responded respectfully, observing as his grandfather skillfully completed a talisman. The finished product was a Returning Origin Shield snow-white talisman of the late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm.

Noticing the curious look on his grandson's face, Li Xuanxuan remarked, "It's just a common talisman and can't compare to those available in your sect..."

Li Xizhi took another closer look at it and replied softly, "It's true that it falls short. Grandfather's talisman art is remarkably refined, but without a superior legacy, it's wasted on these simpler designs."

"The threshold for talisman art is low, and many rogue cultivators like me squander their potential here in Yue State," Li Xuanxuan chuckled, waving his hand dismissively.

He then retrieved the Dinglin Piercer from his storage pouch and handed the golden dharma artifact to him.

"This Dinglin Piercer is inscribed with Situ Mo's name and the seal of Golden Tang Gate. We dare not use this, so we hope to find a blacksmith in the market to melt and modify it. At least then, it would be usable."

He stroked his beard and sighed before continuing, "I took a trip when I had the chance, but the few blacksmiths who could handle it were afraid of offending the Golden Tang Gate, so they turned me away. The only one willing to take it on quoted an outrageous price! I can't believe it...!"

Li Xizhi immediately understood the situation. Taking the dharma artifact into his hands, he assured, "Leave it to me, Grandfather. While I can't act recklessly in this market, I can leverage my power and influence to open a few backdoors... I may be able to solve our family's trouble easily."

Li Xuanxuan nodded repeatedly with a look of appreciation on his face.

"A few years ago, I had a disagreement with your youngest uncle. If you had stayed home, you would have been the perfect person to manage the family. Unfortunately, you had to join the sect as you were the only candidate to fill that role. If only we could delay it a few years back then..."

Li Xizhi shook his head, but Li Xuanxuan continued, "Yes, you were indeed the best candidate to join the sect. Ximing can be heartless; if someone with his personality joined, it could spell trouble! Xijun is too sharp, and Xicheng is too serious. You're the only one who can navigate these waters patiently and with goodwill..."

"I heard you married someone from the Yang Family. Does she take good care of you? Bring her back to meet Grandfather if opportunity allows..."

Li Xuanxuan, now old and prone to rambling, chatted on as Li Xizhi listened with a smile.

Eventually, he said softly, "Just a moment, Grandfather. I'll find someone to recast the dharma artifact."

Li Xuanxuan waved, motioning for him to go. As Li Xizhi stepped outside, he heard a couple of creaking sounds from the backyard. Li Xijun entered, looking noticeably better, but with a hint of concern on his face.

"Granduncle, you should really consider heading home earlier. While we're safe in this market, I'm worried that Situ Mo could still pose a threat. Auntie is alone at home. If he goes to Mount Qingdu, I fear she won't be able to handle him," he urged.

"That's a good point," Li Xuanxuan replied, pausing in his work. He set down the talisman brush and added, "When Jiao'er finishes his retreat, we can all return together. We'll have Xizhi take care of the dharma artifact and deliver it to us when it's done."

————

When Li Xizhi left the courtyard, the two older men, who had been waiting attentively, approached him.

"Who's the best at refining artifacts in this market?" he asked them.

One of the old men stepped forward with a fawning smile as he replied, "There's a cultivator from the Sword Gate here who specializes in crafting dharma artifacts, but... he's also a disciple of the immortal sect and has secluded himself for quite some time. He isn't very friendly, so we dare not approach him. I fear you might need to visit him personally, my lord..."

"From Wanyu Sword Gate, huh? That's fine. Take me there," Li Xizhi replied decisively with a nod.

He set off, riding the rainbow as the two men followed closely behind, admiring and fearing the vibrant light beneath his feet.

One of them whispered through mana voice transmission, "This man is quite fortunate to be born as the direct descendant of Qingdu and become a disciple of Azure Pond Sect. His master is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from the Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest Plain, and his father is the ancestor of the Li Family. His family has Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators for three generations... He's truly been above us since birth..."

The other old man nodded in agreement, replying in the same manner, "Indeed. I suspect this lord's background in the sect plays a significant role too... He doesn't get involved in the market dealings. Perhaps he even looks down on them!"

Of course, Li Xizhi could not hear their conversation. When he stepped into the courtyard, he saw a young man sitting on the ground, studying a blueprint. Sensing Li Xizhi's presence, he raised his drooping eyelids and glanced at him.

"I am Cheng Jinzhu of Wanyu Sword Gate. Which peak of Azure Pond do you come from?" the young man asked.

Although Wanyu Sword Gate and Azure Pond Sect did not have the best relationship, the man's sideways glance felt rather rude. Sensing the arrogance in his demeanor, Li Xizhi guessed that this situation might be challenging.

Nevertheless, he responded humbly, "I'm Li Xizhi from Qingsui Peak."

"Qingsui Peak? Never heard of it!" Cheng Jinzhu replied, his tone initially calm. But then he suddenly frowned, straightened his posture, and asked with confusion, "Li Family... Aren't you from the Li Family of Fuchen Peak? This Qingsui you speak of... is it the Qingsui connected to the Sword Immortal?"

"I'm from the Li Family of Qingdu at Moongaze Lake," Li Xizhi explained.

As soon as the words left his mouth, Cheng Jinzhu jumped up from the ground, his expression shifting drastically.

His smile became enthusiastic, and he said with a hint of embarrassment, "My apologies, fellow Daoist! I saw how young you looked and thought you were a direct descendant of the Devil Gate... It turns out you're the descendant of the Sword Immortal Clan! I am truly sorry!"

Although Cheng Jinzhu could openly refer to the Azure Pond Sect as the Devil Gate, Li Xizhi did not dare to acknowledge it. He felt a wave of relief wash over him, but could only bow his head silently and pretend he had not heard the young man's remark.

"The influence of my predecessors is hardly worth mentioning," he replied modestly.

Cheng Jinzhu's attitude changed completely. He pulled Li Xizhi closer and exclaimed cheerfully, "What do you mean by hardly worth mentioning? When Celestial Moon Sword Intent first emerged, it was recorded even in the Wanyu Sword Book of my sect! The sword's name is Qingche, and the sword intent is Celestial Moon—ethereal and unpredictable. With just a glance, anyone could tell that it embodies the true Dao!"

"We don't like to refer to it by the name of the immortal peak in the Devil Gate. So, whenever we talk about the Sword Immortal, we refer to him by his sword's name," he added.

A somber look appeared on his face as he continued, "It's a pity he fell in the southern border. Such a shame..."

Cheng Jinzhu took Li Xizhi's hand and said, "Your family hails from Azure Pond; otherwise, my sword gate would be the closest to your family. In recent years, my gate has been fighting everywhere, and the situation isn't good. We can barely protect ourselves. Otherwise, we would definitely invite the descendants of your family to join us..."

He continued softly, "As for the Wrathful Maha, although my elder has never engaged in the dirty dealings of Buddhist cultivators, they made an exception in the great void, secretly trying to rescue the victims. Although his actions have yielded some unexpected results, things ultimately didn't work out..."

Cheng Jinzhu seemed to be filled with frustration as he spilled out all these words that he had been suppressing all this while. Li Xizhi listened intently until he finished speaking, feeling slightly touched by his emotive expressions.

Cheng Jinzhu then noticed the expression on his face and smiled brightly as he said, "Come, fellow Daoist! Your family's techniques are impressive. Let's have a quick spar with swords!"

Li Xizhi understood that Cheng Jinzhu was likely wary of him pretending to be a member of the Li Family to deceive him. He placed his right hand on the hilt of his sword, gathering his energy before saying calmly, "All right, but I'll only demonstrate one move."

After all, I only know this single move from the Law of Celestial Moon...

While Li Xizhi was thinking to himself, Cheng Jinzhu grew serious. He drew his sword, its brilliant sword qi already shimmering and flowing, signaling that he was ready for battle.

Wanyu's sword technique legacy had been passed down through generations. As Cheng Jinzhu activated his sword, he observed Li Xizhi's movements keenly. Suddenly, the sword hanging at Li Xizhi's waist leaped into action, unleashing a massive sword arc that rushed toward him.

Clang...!

Cheng Jinzhu retracted his sword, shaking it to dispel the energy of the sword arc that had surged toward him. He stepped back a few paces with a thoughtful look on his face.

Li Xizhi felt a pang of unease in his heart.

He moved really quickly with his sword! Despite being in the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, he effortlessly neutralized my strike, and that speaks volumes about his strength!

Meanwhile, Cheng Jinzhu stroked his chin and commented, "Your swordsmanship is quite peculiar... It's very interesting."

He was eager to see more of Li Xizhi's sword technique, but Li Xizhi refused and cut to the chase.

"I obtained a dharma artifact from Golden Tang Gate, and I would like to ask you to recast it so that my family can use it."

"Golden Tang Gate, huh? No problem, but is it a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact?" Cheng Jinzhu asked nonchalantly.

Li Xizhi handed him the Dinglin Piercer. Cheng Jinzhu took it and examined it before praising it.

"Very interesting design... it's a good treasure."

"Do you want to make it into a sword? What type of true essence can control it?"

The questions he asked showed his experience in his trade.

"Snow and pine," Li Xizhi replied.

Cheng Jinzhu considered this for a moment before nodding thoughtfully.

"Just bring all the cold jade or cold stone you have and I will recast it for you. It will take about... two to three years! This golden material is excellent. It would be a waste to keep it in its current form. It can easily be converted into a Foundation Establishment Realm sword!"

Li Xizhi thanked him gratefully and then asked, "How many Spirit Stones will it cost?"

Cheng Jinzhu casually stroked the Dinglin Piercer in his hand and said, "Just pay me however you wish. I won't take advantage of you. However, I do have one request—I must be the one to name this dharma artifact once it's done."

Li Xizhi did not mind this term at all and nodded in agreement. After exchanging a few more words, they bid farewell and parted ways.

Upon returning to the courtyard, Li Xizhi found his family preparing to leave. He felt a pang of reluctance, having only spent half a month with them.

He hurried over to Li Yuanjiao and asked, "Has your wound healed, Father? Why are you in such a hurry to leave?"

Li Yuanjiao replied gently, "My condition has stabilized, but I have hurt my tendons and bones... Such an injury cannot be healed in a day or two. I still need to go home and stay in seclusion for three to five years."

He adjusted his black robe and added in a serious voice, "I have a few things to discuss with you."

Li Xizhi nodded, but did not expect what Li Yuanjiao said next.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

"You need to spar with your younger brother."

"Huh...?"

Li Xizhi immediately glanced at Li Xijun, who was holding a sword in his arms and was equally stunned. However, understanding quickly dawned on him.

As expected, Li Yuanjiao explained, "Let us see how my family's descendant compares to the disciple of the Azure Pond Sect!"

Feeling slightly awkward, Li Xizhi landed and noticed that Li Xijun, dressed simply in white, had long been stuck in the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. In contrast, he had just recently broken through and was wearing a brocade robe.

After a brief moment of thought, he removed his feathered robe and nodded at his younger brother.

"Please excuse me, Brother!"

Li Xijun soared into the air and executed the River Crossing Torrential Step, closing the distance between them while pressing his hand on the hilt of his sword. His expression was serious as flew toward Li Xizhi, white qi swirling in his eyes.

Li Xizhi, standing in midair with his sheath in hand, felt the colorful light beneath his feet growing dense and calm. He turned sideways and instantly pulled several feet away, shocking Li Xijun.

This footwork technique is too advanced! I can't seem to close the distance...

Resolving to act quickly, he drew his sword and unleashed a powerful white sword arc. Li Xizhi, not intending to overwhelm his brother, also drew his sword, responding with a Celestial Moon Sword Arc.

Li Xijun's sword was ordinary, but Li Xizhi's shone with mana light, dazzling and eye-catching—clearly indicating that it was far from ordinary. When their sword arcs collided, a loud explosion reverberated through the air.

Boom...!

The two sword arcs clashed in midair, sending smoke and dust swirling around them. Li Xizhi dispersed a wisp of sword qi with a wave of his sleeve, revealing a hint of surprise on his face as he nodded approvingly.

"Good!" he praised.

Though Li Xizhi was older and had trained for longer, while also possessing superior sword talent, his extensive study of spells in the sect meant he had dedicated less time to swordsmanship than Li Xijun. Despite having the advantage of a dharma artifact, he found himself at a slight disadvantage.

Li Xijun seized the upper hand with that one move, eager to close in and unleash sword qi. However, Li Xizhi shook his head with a smile, performed a hand seal, and a vibrant light burst forth.

Floating Light Gathering.

Colorful lights floated about, shimmering and flickering like lightning. In an instant, Li Xijun felt his grip empty and realized that his sword had flown into Li Xizhi's hand.

"What kind of spell was that?!" Li Xijun exclaimed in shock.

Li Yuanjiao, who had been quietly observing the fight, was taken aback. When he saw Li Xizhi snatch the sword from Li Xijun with a swift motion, his expression shifted to one of alarm.

I knew it... there's a method to counter weapon arts!

Rogue and clan cultivators typically could not practice these spells or techniques, relying instead on weapon skills like swords, spears, and sabers to fight against the immortal sects. These skills were easy to learn but had high potential.

Hence, Li Yuanjiao had long suspected that the Azure Pond Sect possessed spells specifically designed to counter them.

His heart raced.

If that's the case, how can we possibly win? It takes just a spell for them to disarm us!

Although Li Xijun was caught off guard, he was quick to react. He swiftly brought his fingers together and unleashed Slaughter Jun Kui Light. White light surged forward, aimed directly at Li Xizhi.

"Good spell," Li Xizhi complimented. He quickly performed a hand seal, bending his middle and ring fingers into his palm, raising the others to form a triangle shape, and reciting a brief chant.

"Enter, me, heart, cauldron."

As soon as he finished speaking, the Kui Light formed a white line, swirling gracefully before landing in his palm. With a gentle twist, he redirected it, causing the white energy to flow and freeze the ground beneath them.

After witnessing this display, Li Xijun could only sigh in resignation. Li Yuanjiao and Li Xuanxuan exchanged glances, both astonished.

Zhi'er is not a direct descendant of Azure Pond, yet the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique is a complete and comprehensive manual even by the standards of the Azure Pond is already this powerful! If he were part of the Chi Family...

Li Xizhi cupped his fist to his younger brother. Noticing the silent expressions of the two elders, he assured softly, "Zhi'er is not weak in the sect..."

Li Yuanjiao sighed and asked, "How many spells can an average Azure Pond disciple practice?"

Li Xizhi replied respectfully, "Three or four. If they attempt more, it might delay their foundation establishment."

Glancing at his father, he hesitated before adding, "Disciples in the sect typically establish their foundation in their fifties or sixties. It's not solely due to their talent but rather the time lost practicing spells while waiting for the opportunity to break through. If certain spells remain unpracticed during the Qi Cultivation Realm, achieving Foundation Establishment becomes significantly more challenging."

"Why is that?" Li Yuanjiao asked, frowning slightly.

Li Xizhi explained, "Once a cultivator establishes their immortal foundation, many divine wonders naturally manifest. If the spells they intend to learn do not harmonize with them, improvement becomes difficult..."

"Conversely, if those spells are learned before establishing the foundation, they may be influenced positively by the immortal foundation, leading to remarkable changes. Thus, disciples in the sect strive to push themselves as much as possible. Unfortunately, some end up aging without progress, resulting in numerous tragedies.




# Chapter 518: Returning To Qingdu

"I see," Li Yuanjiao murmured.

Back then, Kong Tingyun did not use a single spell to deal with Wushao. Although Profound Peak Gate may not match Azure Pond, she should have one or two spells as a direct descendant. She must have been wary of me and did not use her full strength...

After Li Xizhi had finished explaining, he glanced at his younger brother and said, "This should be the Kui Light spell we got at home. It's perfect for Eighth Brother's cultivation path and will be even more effective when you reach the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

Although Li Xijun was defeated in just a few moves, he did not show any frustration. Instead, a spark of curiosity crossed his face.

"Brother Zhi! What are the limitations of your spell?"

"I was just about to share," Li Xizhi nodded with a small smile as he elaborated, "Heavenly Glow excels at both striking and snatching. Excluding direct lineage secret legacies, Floating Light Gathering ranks among the best in Azure Pond. However, the effectiveness of this spell relies on the opponent's sword cultivation and the quality of the sword they wield."
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝐰𝚎𝕓𝐧𝚘𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝕞

"If you could unleash sword essence or wield a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, it would have been challenging for me to snatch your sword," he explained.

He paused, glancing at Li Yuanjiao, and continued, "If it were the Qingche sword, not only would I fail to take it, but I might also end up with my fingers cut and bleeding profusely. Additionally, if the sword's intent is still sealed within, I'd likely lose my cultivation along with two pieces of my flesh."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, feeling significantly reassured by this information, and asked, "What if an Azure Pond Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator casts this spell?"

"Well, it's a sword that belonged to the Sword Immortal, so it should be quite difficult to take," Li Xizhi replied.

He thought for a moment, then added, "But the tactics of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator are unpredictable, and we don't know their spell's grade. It could likely still create a disturbance, affecting the opponent's swordsmanship."

"I see," Li Yuanjiao replied thoughtfully and then asked, "Has Yu Muxian practiced this spell?"

Li Xizhi understood the concern in his question but replied respectfully, "I have no idea..."

Li Yuanjiao resolved seriously, "Then I hope I can keep the sword intent within the blade, in case one of my descendants is talented enough to comprehend it and become a sword immortal. At the very least, it can be used against Yu Muxian instead of being wasted..."

Li Xizhi sighed internally, bowing to his father as he said, "I have also been keeping an eye on Yu Muxian... He's been quietly refining dharma artifacts in the sect this year. But he's a genius, and he has already... broken through to the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

As expected...

Li Yuanjiao showed no surprise. He pressed his lips together, remaining silent.

His son continued, "Fei Qingyi, the female disciple of the Fei Family who trained at Yuanwu Peak, has broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and mastered the Ni Water Pure Rite technique. She is well-liked by Yu Muxian and loyal to him. If this continues, it could spell trouble for us."

"Hmph!" Li Xuanxuan frowned, his anger palpable.

"The Fei Family hasn't sent anyone to visit in years! They've likely forgotten how my second uncle saved their family with his sword and liberated Glacial Cloud Peak!"

Li Yuanjiao remained unfazed and replied softly, "This is how the world operates. The Fei Family is defending Fei Qingyi, and there's nothing we can say about it. We can only focus on our own matters."

Li Xizhi cupped his fist slightly, refraining from responding. He then hurried to change the subject, sharing details about the creation of the dharma artifact with Cheng Jinzhu. After a moment of thought, Li Yuanjiao took out a piece of blue-and-white ore from his storage pouch and asked, "Is this Ni Water Cold Iron suitable for crafting that dharma artifact?"

"Oh yes, now I remember," Li Xizhi replied, realization dawning on him, "Yes, of course. This will reduce some costs... When it's finished, I'll have someone send it home."

Li Xizhi implied that he would cover the expense of making the dharma artifact. Li Yuanjiao studied him for a moment before saying, "I'll leave it to you then. When I return home, I'll have someone send the cold iron here."

Li Xizhi nodded and said, "I'll try to gather some news about Situ Mo in the market and report back to the family. Please take care of Huai'er..."

He glanced at Li Chenghuai in his grandfather's arms, showing a hint of reluctance in his eyes. Rolling up the hem of his feathered robe, he searched his pockets but could not find anything to leave for the child.

In the end, he could only blurt out a single sentence.

"I'll choose one or two dharma artifacts and send them home for him later."

"Of course," Li Xuanxuan replied, still cradling his grandson tightly.

Li Yuanjiao added, "Your mother also gave you a younger sister in your absence. She has already condensed her Profound Scenery Chakra. Her name is Li Yuexiang, and she shows promising talent... I'll send her to visit you soon."

"What?!"

Li Xizhi was taken aback, unable to hide his surprise. He smiled wryly and thought to himself, So much for complaining that I didn't write to you when my wife gave birth to Huai'er! You didn't even bother to tell me I have a younger sister! And she's probably already seven or eight years old now...

Despite grumbling internally, he was delighted by the news. Of course, he dared not talk back to Li Yuanjiao and merely responded politely. Li Xuanxuan beamed with pride, mumbling something about 'like father, like son'.

After bidding their farewell, they fetched Kongheng from the side yard and set off into the night.

Li Xizhi escorted his family out of the prefecture and when he turned around, the two old men approached him with fawning smiles.

Resuming his courteous yet distant demeanor, he asked, "Does the Golden Tang Gate run any business in the market?"

————

Li Yuanjiao and his group did not linger, hastily departing on the wind. As they headed west, he worried that Situ Mo might be lurking in the shadows while they were flying out in the open. He glanced at Kongheng and asked, "Master Monk, Situ Mo is likely colluding with Buddhist cultivators in Zhao State to plot against us. You're a Buddhist cultivator of true Dao lineage, do you know of any way to protect us? I don't expect us to remain undetected, but I would like an early warning if those in Zhao State manage to deduce our whereabouts."

"Benefactor..." Kongheng replied, looking a bit ashamed.

"The methods of Zhao's Buddhist cultivators and their power of deduction with the support of Maha's power surpass my own. I can only rely on my Dao lineage to protect myself from their schemes and deductions... There's little else I can do..." he sighed dejectedly.

"No need to blame yourself, Master Monk," Li Yuanjiao reassured him. It had been a casual question, yet Kongheng's kindness stirred feelings of shame over his own perceived incompetence.

Li Yuanjiao nodded thoughtfully.

At least they can't deduce Kongheng... there's still some room for maneuver.

The group rode the wind until they reached the vicinity of Moongaze Lake, finally allowing themselves to breathe a sigh of relief. Mount Qingdu was peaceful. Its grand formation was intact, and the territories under their rule seemed tranquil, basking in the sunset.

Li Yuanjiao exhaled, and a young man in black flew over from the distance. It was Li Wushao, who had sensed their approach through their spiritual connection. He cupped his fist in greeting, landing respectfully before them.

"Wushao greets Master."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly as Kongheng excused himself and returned to the island where he stayed. Li Xijun and Li Xuanxuan descended on the mountain together.

Li Qinghong flew out to meet them, clad in her jade armor and carrying a spear behind her. As soon as the siblings met, they fell silent, though both were eager to share their updates. They eventually took turns recounting what had transpired during each other's absence.

"Zhang Yun? Zhang Huaide?" Li Yuanjiao asked skeptically.

Since Zhang Huaide was from the Zhang Family and seemed to have significant background resources, the Li Family had long suspected him to be a disciple of the immortal sect who had veered toward the devil dao. Now, with Zhang Yun personally protecting him, those suspicions were confirmed.

"Yes, it seems that the Golden Feather Sect was not only involved in the devil plague, their Purple Mansion Realm cultivator also closely monitored the incident, and even sent their own direct disciples to manipulate the devil plague in their territory," Li Qinghong remarked.

"That's to be expected. After so many years in the Golden Feather Realm, the treasures accumulated by the clans are certainly tempting. Moreover, the prominent clans have already monopolized the Golden Feather's cultivation and secret techniques, and they've long been eager to eliminate any competition," Li Xuanxuan replied with a small sigh.

"Aside from Golden Feather and Azure Pond, several of the other seven gates, such as Changxiao and Purple Smoke, have pushed disciples who have little hope of making further progress to pursue the devil dao. While they may not dominate the situation, they can certainly still benefit from the scraps," he added.

Li Qinghong then continued, "Since Zhang Yun's departure, those devil cultivators have grown increasingly bold, capturing cultivators throughout the barren mountains. It's not just our family; I heard that the Shen Family, an immortal clan in the Yue Cultivating Sect bordering the northern barren mountains, had also sent people here... They must have been forced back by Zhang Yun."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head as he gave a word of caution.

"Don't worry about them... just avoid provoking them."

Li Qinghong nodded in agreement before taking out a jade box, smiling as she presented it.

"Look at this!"

Li Yuanjiao took the box and scanned its contents with his spiritual sense. It was a red fruit wrapped in dark gray leaves, beating like a heart.

His expression shifted to one of delight as he remarked, "This is Blood Sun Fruit... Luken is truly efficient! Xizhi happens to be in Libu Prefecture right now; let him take this to the Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist."

Li Yuanjiao stored away the treasure carefully. With that, the matter was finally settled. Li Xijun still seemed concerned about the wound on his wrist and reminded Li Yuanjiao to rest. Upon hearing that, Li Qinghong also urged him to return to his cave dwelling for proper rest.

Li Yuanjiao acknowledged their advice but headed to Li Yuanping's courtyard instead. He intended to take medicine and delay his seclusion for another year or two so that he could keep Li Yuanping company.

However, when Li Yuanping heard that he was injured, he closed his door and refused to meet Li Yuanjiao.

Unable to overcome the insistence of his siblings, Li Yuanjiao reluctantly retreated into seclusion to heal his wounds.

As Li Xijun flew toward the mountain's peak, he spotted a girl of about eight or nine standing on a rock. Dressed in white, she squinted against the sun, a smile illuminating her face as she called out, "Brother!"

"Xiang'er!" Li Xijun replied with a warm grin.

Li Yuexiang resembled her mother, Xiao Guiluan, with her fine eyebrows and phoenix eyes. Even at a tender age, she exuded grace. Though still a child, she carried herself with the maturity expected of a teen.

She twiddled her thumbs nervously and said, "Father only came to see me once, then went into seclusion again..."

As the only girl in the Xi and Yue generation, Li Yuexiang was cherished by her elder brothers. However, her mother, Xiao Guiluan, had raised her with discipline, instilling a sense of humility in her. The frequent and prolonged absences of her father only heightened her unease.

Li Xijun sighed, fully understanding the situation. Many privileged children were born into clans where their parents were already Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. To these parents, what seemed like a brief period of seclusion often resulted in them emerging to find their children had already become teenagers. After yet another period of seclusion to polish their cultivation, they would realize their kids had grown into adults in the blink of an eye.

"In truth, Brother Xizhi and Uncle Jiao also don't see each other often. Both of you are raised by your mother... Your father has a lot of responsibilities to the family. You must be understanding..." Li Xijun assured as he gently consoled the girl who looked like she was about to cry.

At this point, Li Yuexiang had already begun her training as an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. Taking her hand, Li Xijun distracted her, smiling as he said, "I brought you a little nephew. How do you think your mother will feel about him?"

Li Yuexiang pouted, saying glumly, "He's just another one who can't see his father..."

Li Xijun could only respond with an awkward smile as he led her up the mountain.

————

At Lake Xian's estuary...

Clad in a golden robe, Situ Mo rode the wind on golden light with a grim expression. He flew along the riverbank, hands clasped behind his back while remaining silent.

The demonic creatures lurking in the river below saw the brilliance above and fell still, too intimidated to even move. Situ Mo's expression darkened even more as thoughts raced through his mind.

What a missed opportunity! The Li Family will be on high alert now, making it even harder to deal with them. Catching them off guard like this is a rarity... Who knows when the next chance will arise?

While he was lost in his thoughts, a yellow light erupted from Lake Xian, revealing a muscular monk with a clean-shaven head and a flushed body. His fierce gaze bore down on Situ Mo as he exclaimed, "Situ Mo! What have you done? This is a disaster! It's absurd!"

Situ Mo's expression darkened, and he retorted through clenched teeth, "Better than you, old man! You're too scared to even show your face! That pathetic Wrathful Dao lineage you cultivate should be called the Cowardly Dao lineage instead!"

"Watch your mouth! The Wrathful Dao lineage isn't some cowardly Dao lineage! I've been deducing for three years... The Li Family has too many ways and secret tricks up their sleeves! Although they don't dare to kill you, they could strike me down with some talisman or sword!"

Situ Mo sneered, but he did not deny it. He had indeed hidden a lot of trump cards up his sleeve too. He simply laughed and mocked, "You can only blame your Wrath Dao lineage for being torn apart. How many even remember Maha's death and are actually seeking revenge? If they cared, a little Master Monk wouldn't even be here in the first place."

"What do you know?! Nothing is more important than preserving the Dao lineage! When someone ascends to the position of Maha again, it will be easy to capture the Li Family!"

Situ Mo paused, realizing that the monk had made a valid point. He cast a wary glance at him and then shouted, "If that's the case, why are you messing around in the south?!"

The big monk chuckled with a fierce glint in his eyes.

"Since the Li Family killed the Maha, perhaps the key to ascending to that position again lies within them... What's wrong with giving it a try?" he asked.

The expression on his face suddenly darkened again, returning to its wrathful form as he reprimanded, "Do not question me! Besides, I explicitly told you to kill only Li Xijun, bring his body back, and leave that monk alone! Why did you set up an ambush and ruin the entire plan?!"
𝚏𝕣𝐞𝗲𝐰𝕖𝐛𝐧𝕠𝕧𝚎𝚕.𝐜𝚘𝗺

A sinister expression crossed Situ Mo's features as he replied, "What use is Li Xijun? If we're going to kill, we should take out Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong instead!"

"You're making a mistake! What do you know? Clans fear nothing more than a lack of successors. Killing Li Xijun, even if he's injured, would cause more anguish than seriously wounding Li Yuanjiao! If we crippled Li Xijun, the Li Family will resent us for fifty or sixty years and could even risk their downfall!" the monk yelled out furiously.

Situ Mo fell silent but was sneering inwardly.

You think I don't know that? Monks like you are good at deducing. If I were to simply kill him, the cause and effect would be settled instantly. Would you still stay around and help me if you deduced that this wouldn't help your breakthrough to Maha? You'd just wash your hands of this and walk away... Where else would I find a capable ally who isn't afraid of the Li Family?

If I'm going to kill someone, I need to aim high!

The monk continued berating him but failed to vent all his frustration. In the end, he only asked, "How long will it take you to return this time?"

"Probably ten years..." Situ Mo replied, giving him a troubled look, "The Profound Peak Gate has sent a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to oversee things overseas. She is rather formidable... I think her name is Kong Tingyun. I have no choice but to deal with this situation."

He widened his eyes and continued coldly, "It would be best to find a chance to eliminate her, so we won't waste time... I have to stir the pot too. We can't let Profound Peak and Golden Tang be on friendly terms again..."




# Chapter 520: Contact In Wubu Market

Qingdu Peak.

Li Yuanjiao was cultivating in seclusion, healing his wounds. However, the Blood Sun Fruit needed to be delivered to Li Xizhi in Wubu Market of Libu Prefecture. With uncertainties surrounding Situ Mo's movements, the Li Family decided to send Kongheng to fulfill the task.

Li Xijun briefly mentioned the matter, to which Kongheng nodded and solemnly put the treasure into his chest pocket. He was a man who took promises seriously, committed to fulfilling them even if they were at the cost of his life.

Li Xijun's eyelids twitched as he asked, "Master Monk... they can't trace you, right?"

Seeing Kongheng nod in affirmation, Li Xijun finally realized that his Dao lineage truly emphasized on keeping promises. He saw Kongheng off with an amused smile at the border.

Yet, as he watched him leave, he sighed.

"Those who cultivated the ancient method are simple and honest, but those Buddhist cultivators who practiced the new way are cunning... The two could not be more different."

With this thought, Li Xijun smiled wryly, adding, "Then again, my family is also known for our cunningness..."

Initially planning to fly back to Mount Qingdu, Li Xijun changed his mind.

"It's been a long time since I saw Ximing. I wonder if he's been fooling around and neglecting his cultivation... I better go remind him."

He made a sharp turn in mid-air and landed on Mount Wutu. The scenery was lush on Wutu, and outside the forest courtyard and Alchemy Pavilion, a woman awaited, dressed in white and wearing a veiled hat that was adorned with pearls and jade.

Upon seeing Li Xijun land, the woman quickly removed her hat and said softly, "An greets Senior."

Li Xijun paused briefly, recognizing her as An Zheyan's daughter, Li Ximing's new wife, and his sister-in-law. He lowered his gaze and replied, "Sister-In-Law, there's no need for such formality."

An nodded and said softly, "Since Brother-In-Law is here, I'll take my leave."

Li Xijun nodded and then stepped into the cave dwelling in the backyard. Inside, Li Ximing sat, swallowing a flame from the furnace. Upon seeing Li Xijun, he exclaimed with delight, "Come, come, come!"

Li Xijun's spiritual sense swept through the area, and he immediately understood the situation.

His voice was filled with astonishment as he asked, "You've... broken through to the eighth heavenly layer?"

Li Ximing laughed, waving his hands dismissively as he replied, "I've been accumulating my strength for a while, and just happened to break through on a whim!"

Though Li Ximing spoke casually and with pride, Li Xijun understood him and the effort behind his achievement. He was clearly waiting to be praised, so Li Xijun complimented him a few times, eliciting a laugh from him before adding, "Take another Talisman pill, and you'll be able to break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and the Foundation Establishment will be just within your reach."

"Of course," Li Ximing replied with confidence.

With a serious tone, he continued, "Once Uncle Jiao emerges from seclusion, we can choose an island to settle down overseas! Leave the family to me; I can handle it!"

I know you're too lazy to go overseas, Li Xijun grumbled inwardly.

"I saw An waiting outside. While she has a good temper, you shouldn't take her for granted. The An Family members are talented; An Zheyan has worked hard and made significant contributions over the years. You can't let her down," he reminded Li Ximing.

"Yes... of course... I do treat her very well! I'm always nice. I couldn't meet her just now because I was refining pills," he explained.

Li Xijun nodded, hesitating for a moment before finally asking, "What about Meng Zhuoyun? How do you plan to deal with her?"

Li Ximing paused, suddenly looking a bit awkward as he replied softly, "I've tried to persuade her many times. She refuses to give up on revenge and stay with me... I guess I'll just send her away when the times come. There's no need for further discussion on this matter..."

Seeing Li Xijun frown, Li Ximing quickly added, "I haven't treated her unfairly! I've given her all the resources she needed and imparted all the alchemy knowledge she should know. When the time comes, everything will balance out, and we can part ways without owing each other."

Li Xijun shook his head in disbelief.

"You! You're truly heartless... I don't think that's what she's after!."

"That..." Li Ximing began, feeling a mix of shock and irritation from having his affair exposed by his brother.

"That's nonsense! Who do you think she is? Our relationship is purely physical," he said with a sigh.

Li Xijun glanced at him and gently reminded, "If you're going to let her leave, then make sure she doesn't take anything that has our family's seal away with her. We don't want trouble in the future."

"That's true," Li Ximing replied absent-mindedly. With no further comment, Li Xijun departed.

Li Ximing straightened up, noticing several paintings scattered across the courtyard. He picked them up, examined each one closely, and then set them aside.

He spat out Long Marching Fire Essence. Meng Zhuoyun caused only a brief flutter of emotions in his heart, which he quickly dismissed and quickly forgot.

————

Libu Prefecture, Wubu Market.

In just three months, Li Xizhi had established control over the entire market and organized its rules and regulations. He won over several shop owners who were rogue cultivators, then made things easier for the shops owned by Xiao, Yuan, and Yang Families.

"With Azure Pond's support, taking over this place is straightforward. No one dares to defy me."

If it were not for Azure Pond and the backing of three prominent clans, it would have taken Li Xizhi ten times longer to gain this level of control. Now, after giving just a few orders, he could focus on his own cultivation properly.

According to the sect's unspoken rules, he could now take over many marginal profits. Concerned about giving others leverage against him, Li Xizhi chose to hold off.

Due to this, visitors were rare in the market. Wubu was not a large market. The disciples from the peaks were wary of it, and direct disciples were not interested in it. Hence, only Li Xizhi and the relevant families were here.

The spiritual energy here is far inferior to that of Azure Pond, but we are free and relaxed here, without the need for constant worry.

As he pondered these thoughts, someone approached and cupped his fist respectfully.

"My lord, the records for Golden Tang Gate are here," he reported with a bow.

Li Xizhi took the document and flipped through it, quickly locating information on Situ Mo, the current apparent head of the Golden Tang's main lineage, who should be the last survivor of a lineage that had been wiped out long ago.

Originally, the Golden Tang Gate was run by the eldest son, Situ Li, who had marriage ties with Profound Peak Gate. After the founder, Situ Tang, died, his second son, Situ Nu, supported by the Golden Feather Sect, killed his elder brother and took control, achieving the Purple Mansion Realm.

After Situ Nu's death, the Golden Tang Gate fractured into several factions. In the end, control was restored to those in the first lineage, who were aligned with the Azure Pond Sect. Those in Situ Nu's lineage were slaughtered, leaving only Situ Mo as the only survivor.

How complicated.

Li Xizhi skimmed through the document. He could clearly see the traces of conflict between Azure Pond and Golden Feather. As for the repeated massacres and struggles with the Golden Tang Gate, that was merely a show between the two sects.

They were all forced to do this. Otherwise, they wouldn't have bothered to secretly shelter Situ Mo.

Li Xizhi felt a jolt of surprise and turned to his subordinate.

"Where is Situ Mo now? What mission has he accepted?"

"I heard he has taken on a mission to the Eastern Sea and may not return for several years," the man replied respectfully.

"Continue," Li Xizhi encouraged, and the man went on to explain, "According to the cultivators from the Han, Fu, and He families who visited the market, the Kong Family of Profound Peak has sent two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to an overseas market. They've taken control of two more islands and blocked the sea route, causing the Golden Tang Gate's population to dwindle by more than half."

"The relationship between Profound Gate and Golden Tang was once very good, with no conflicts. However, it has soured in recent years, leading to this situation. In response, Golden Tang Gate has dispatched Situ Mo," he added.

With this new insight, Li Xizhi took out a small letter and wrote a message to his family before sending it off.

Moments later, the old man returned with news that a monk wished to see him.

"A monk…?"

Li Xizhi was alarmed. He carefully inquired about the monk's appearance and confirmed it was indeed Kongheng. With a talisman ready in his hand, he left the sect to meet him.

The monk had fair skin, sharp eyes, a long face, and round ears. He greeted Li Xizhi solemnly, "Greetings, fellow Daoist. I have been entrusted by your esteemed family to deliver a treasured panacea."

Upon hearing the mention of a treasured panacea, Li Xizhi had already begun to piece things together.

However, Kongheng did not present it immediately. Instead, he studied Li Xizhi closely and said softly, "Please show me the jade pendant, fellow Daoist."

Quite a stubborn one!

Li Xizhi smiled. Though they had just met, both were cautious. Li Xizhi revealed the jade pendant that symbolized the direct lineage of the Li Family. After verifying his identity, Kongheng apologized and handed him a jade box.

Li Xizhi scanned the box with his spiritual sense, confirming that it did indeed contain the Blood Sun Fruit.

"Master Monk, please stay for a moment. The sword is about to be completed, and I would appreciate it if you could take it back with you," he said softly.

Kongheng nodded and departed, allowing Li Xizhi to breathe a sigh of relief.

The matter with Li Encheng has finally been resolved... Now, I'll head to Xuanyuan Market to establish a connection with him first.

With Situ Mo away in the Eastern Sea, Li Xizhi felt much more at ease. He handed over the other responsibilities to the two elder men and set off for Xuanyuan Market.

Xuanyuan Market was located near Mount Dongli, not far from Libu Prefecture. As Li Xizhi approached, mist rose around him, obscuring his appearance. Upon landing outside the market, an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator greeted him, asking, "Senior, you are…?"

Li Xizhi simply replied, "I am a rogue cultivator from the Mushroom Forest Plain, traveling here for now."

Since Li Xizhi came here for a personal matter, he could not use his identity as a member of Azure Pond and had to fabricate a random backstory instead. The Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator showed no surprise. He pulled out a round dharma artifact and said respectfully, "Please pass in a trace of true essence, Senior."

The devil plague had been rampant for some time, and major markets had taken precautions to prevent devil cultivators from entering, ensuring the safety of the markets from internal and external threats.

Li Xizhi nodded slowly, infused the artifact with his true essence, and watched as it immediately emitted a brilliant white light.

The cultivator's eyes widened in surprise.

"A cultivator practicing authentic techniques..."

Li Xizhi acknowledged him with a nod, dismissing the flattery as he accepted the jade token offered by the man. He stepped inside the bustling market and searched for a while before quickly locating the Enshui Alchemy Pavilion.

As soon as he entered, a servant approached. Li Xizhi waved his hand and said, "Please invite your shop manager to see me."

Despite having concealed his feathered robe and obscured his face, his calm demeanor and extraordinary presence commanded respect. The servant hurried off, and soon, a tall, thin man descended the stairs, dressed in a short coat.

He smiled and cupped his fist, introducing himself.

"I am Li Enxi. It's an honor to meet you, fellow Daoist."

Although Li Enxi was only in the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, he showed great courtesy to Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi returned the politeness, following him into a secret chamber. Once inside, he removed his disguise and revealed his true identity.

Recognition flickered in Li Enxi's eyes right away.

"Ah, so you're Xizhi. My elder brother has told me about you and I've been expecting you."

Li Xizhi presented the jade box and said softly, "It's a small gift for our meeting. Please accept it."

Li Enxi took the box, and with a quick check through his spiritual sense, he understood its contents.

"Is your Li Family... from the Wei State?" he asked.

Li Xizhi nodded in response, and Li Enxi smiled warmly.

"So… you are from the main family. My brothers and I have suspected only the descendants of Wei State's Li Family could produce such talent."

His demeanor grew more enthusiastic as he added, "Considering our lineage, we trace back at least to Ancestor Mutian... But let's not dwell on that, as I don't want to make you uncomfortable."

Li Xizhi nodded modestly. Given their shared lineage spanning thousands of years, it was difficult to trace back now. Li Enxi had merely brought that up as a way to bring both of them closer.

Ultimately, Li Encheng needed a reliable clan, and the Li Family required a seasoned alchemist at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Li Xizhi understood this but maintained his polite demeanor.

Li Enxi leaned in and whispered, "My elder brother doesn't have much time left. The only path forward is to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. In the future, we will need more assistance from the main family."

Recognizing the conditions being laid out, Li Xizhi nodded politely and said, "Of course, but my family is weak, and I'm afraid we can't offer much help at this moment… There are certain matters where we will require your assistance, Senior."

"Of course," Li Enxi replied.

They exchanged glances, reaching a tacit agreement. Li Xizhi continued, "When the time comes, we will need Senior Encheng's help within the sect…"

"Yes."

Li Enxi paused, then took out a pill from his robe and smiled.

"Take a look."

Li Xizhi swept his spiritual sense over the pill, seeing that the inside was white and thus confirming it was indeed an Essence Gathering Pill. He felt a surge of happiness, wondering if Li Encheng had secretly refined it himself without expending blood qi, or if he had specially asked around about the Li Family's preferences and prepared it accordingly.

Li Xizhi expressed his gratitude repeatedly. Li Enxi chuckled, but then his expression darkened, and he said harshly, "The incident about the Wrathful Maha... is inevitable after all. After a whole thousand years, these Dao lineages still won't let us go..."

There was finally a note of sincerity in his tone. Li Xizhi was taken aback as Li Enxi continued, "My eldest brother was also killed by a monk! This hatred is a shared animosity within the Li Family of Wei. As long as my Li Family remains, we will never forget the blood debt of our destroyed homeland and the lives taken. When my brother heard about Maha, he speculated that it was connected to the Li lineage of Wei and was eager to meet you..."

Li Xizhi then realized there was another reason for how smoothly things had gone. He nodded solemnly, recalling the unresolved hatred between the Qingdu Li Family and Maha.

At that moment, he was struck by a thought and said, "Speaking of this, our whereabouts have recently been exposed, and we've been ambushed by our enemies… The Buddhist cultivators from Zhao seemed to be involved."

Li Enxi frowned, hesitating before responding, "If you find yourself in trouble with the monks, you can always ask me for help. I see that you're a smart child who knows how to navigate these situations, so I won't say more..."

Li Xizhi nodded. He knew he and Li Enxi were still not close enough for him to divulge information about Situ Mo, fearing it might frighten Li Enxi away. Instead, he replied, "If I come across any trace of a Buddhist cultivator, I will certainly let you know."

After talking for a while, they established the rules for future meetings before Li Xizhi turned and left. He rode the wind, stroking the hilt of his sword and lost in his thoughts.

Azure Pond… Overseas… Moongaze…

"Father is already preparing to make a move overseas. The family is growing stronger. Seventh and Eighth Brothers have a chance to establish their foundations; they are merely waiting for the right opportunity…"

For the first time in twenty years of hiding and being submissive at Azure Pond, his expression shifted, revealing his ambition. He no longer concealed his desires.

With the support of Li Encheng, the Yuan, Xiao and Ning families, it would be entirely feasible to unify Moongaze Lake…

Yu Muxian… Yu Muxian! As long as we eliminate this obstacle, we can quickly seize control of the entire Moongaze Lake.




# Chapter 522: Hanlin

Mount Qingdu.

Time flowed like a gentle stream. Mount Qingdu had fully established itself as a peak in the lake, seamlessly connected to the earth veins beneath it. It was no longer possible to tell that the mountain was moved here.

Li Xijun was practicing swordsmanship on the mountain. Compared to his brothers, he was not particularly gifted with swords.

Over the past two years, Li Ximing had broken through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm with the help of pills, and his cultivation was progressing well. Li Xizhi had also reached the seventh heavenly layer, while Li Xijun remained stuck at the sixth heavenly layer.

The last three heavenly layers of the Qi Cultivation Realm are really challenging. I'm less talented than them and had only managed to keep pace before due to receiving some advantages… It's only natural that I've fallen behind now.

Li Xijun remained positive, practicing his swordsmanship day and night. As he swung his long sword, he gradually developed a certain grace, thus attaining mastery of this technique.

"Threefold Moonlight is indeed difficult! After years of hard work, I've finally made some progress," he murmured happily to himself.

While he continued training, he noticed a monk landing on the peak with a long jade box slung across his back, gazing at him warmly.

"Master Monk, you're finally back!"

Kongheng had been away for two years. If it was not for Li Xizhi writing home, Li Xijun might have feared something had happened to the monk during his journey.

He glanced at the jade box on the monk's back before his eyes lit up with excitement. He exclaimed joyfully, "The dharma sword is done?!"

Li Xijun currently possessed no valuable treasures. Li Yuanjiao had given him Glazed Dusk, a string of red beads before, but he had given the protective dharma artifact to his younger sister, Li Yuexiang. For now, a sword was all that he had.

Even a calm person like Li Xijun, who seldom displayed joy, was elated by the fact that his elder brother had crafted a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact for him.

"Indeed!" Kongheng replied, nodding in affirmation.

He removed the jade box from his back and carefully took out the long sword inside it. The blade was thin, long, and white like fresh snow, gleaming coldly in the light.

Kongheng presented the sword with both hands.

"This sword measures three chi, nine cun, and three fen in length, weighing ninety-two jin and twelve taels. It is a Foundation Establishment dharma artifact crafted from cold iron and metal essence. As shimmery as the flowing water and as pure as white frost, it is named Hanlin."[1]

Li Xijun was entranced, unable to tear his gaze away. With trembling hands, he accepted the sword, nodding in awe.

"Good... Good..." he murmured in a daze.

The Hanlin Sword clanged as Li Xijun held it in his hand. Suddenly, the two characters inscribed on the blade lit up, emitting a radiant white light, as if rejoicing.

Turning his hand and holding the sharp sword upside down, the white tip touched his other shoulder, exuding a chilling aura. He measured the sword's length for a moment before expressing his satisfaction once again.

"Good!"

He raised his eyebrow and swung the sword, summoning a gust of cold wind around him. A cold light danced in the air before transforming into three streams of white, crystalline light that twirled and swirled around him.

"Threefold Moonlight!" he exclaimed.

Li Xijun exhaled deeply, and the three streams of light vanished. After so many years, he could finally execute the sword technique he had honed with the Hanlin Sword in his hand. The technique froze the rock beneath his feet and caused it to shatter into pieces.

"Nice!"

A deep and hoarse voice interrupted him. Li Xijun recognized it instantly. He quickly sheathed the sword and bowed respectfully.

"Greetings, Ancestor!"

Li Yuanjiao emerged slowly from the stone path with a pleased smile.

"You have a natural talent for swordsmanship. Your diligence and passion for the sword will ultimately bear fruit," he praised softly.

He paused, continuing with a hint of nostalgia, "Ancestor Tongya practiced swordsmanship for thirty years before mastering this technique… You've caught up with him."

Li Xijun immediately refuted this with respect.

"How can I possibly compare to the ancestor? I'm slow-witted! I've studied this sword technique for twenty years… The Ancestor may have practiced swordsmanship for thirty years but he had learned this technique in less than ten, after receiving this sword manual… It's unfair to compare us like that!"

Seeing the terror in Li Xijun's expression, Li Yuanjiao could tell that Li Xijun genuinely revered the ancestor and showed humility.

"Well, at least you're doing better than I did!" he remarked, clearly pleased.

Li Xijun was about to respond but Li Yuanjiao interrupted him with a wave of his hand, then took the Hanlin Sword. He inspected it closely and remarked in a deep voice, "The material is excellent… I suspect it's second only to the Qingche Sword. Its value will surely reflect that. Fortunately, it was modified and not forged from scratch… Send thirty Spirit Stones to Zhi'er. Make sure he doesn't stubbornly refuse it, lest it hinders his cultivation."

Li Xijun nodded. The Li Family had been doing well, with hundreds of Spirit Stones accumulated over the past few years. Spending a few dozen wasn't an issue for them now.

Li Yuanjiao returned the sharp sword to him and mumbled, "It's a well-chosen name."

Li Xijun pursed his lips, while Kongheng remained silent too. After a moment, the monk excused himself and quickly left.

Li Yuanjiao took out a small letter and said in a serious tone, "This is the letter Zhi'er sent home. It's been delivered to my cave dwelling for some time already… Take a look."

Li Xijun nodded, glancing at the letter briefly before replying, "In my opinion… I'd go overseas immediately. At least I can start looking for an island to establish a foothold, and at the same time, I can ensure Situ Mo is too distracted to target Profound Peak Gate."

"After all, Profound Peak Gate has a good relationship with our family, and Kong Tingyun is a friend of Second Uncle. We should join forces with her; at least we can ensure Situ Mo suffers a setback!" he added.

His mind raced as he made quick deductions.

"It would be best to identify Situ Mo's allies or connections and eliminate them first. That way, he won't be able to trace our whereabouts, greatly reducing the threat."

He continued softly, "Kongheng should stay here since he is the best at defense. With the family's grand formation in place and Situ Mo overseas and absent, we should have nothing to worry about."

While Li Xijun said that, he knew that once everything had been determined, the family would not necessarily need to be guarded by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

However, he knew Li Yuanjiao was cautious by nature, so he held back from saying more.

Li Yuanjiao had been in seclusion for over two years, healing from his injuries. With the aid of numerous spirit pills, his cultivation had even improved slightly.

"That's a feasible plan… However, if Situ Mo's ally is indeed a Buddhist cultivator from Zhao State, we may struggle to find this monk without Kongheng's assistance, let alone confront him," he commented.

Li Xijun nodded slightly and replied, "Auntie is a powerful combatant and must go. So, Uncle is suggesting that we should leave Senior Wushao behind instead?"

Li Yuanjiao simply nodded in confirmation.

"Yes. We'll need that snake demon to guide us in the Eastern Sea, so we may as well deal with Situ Mo first, then let Qinghong return home to take his place."

"I guess that's the only way…" Li Xijun sighed softly before continuing with a doubtful voice, "but I worry that as soon as we set out from here, that person will be able to deduce our plans!"

"I asked Kongheng about this before. That person will have to pay a certain price to deduce my position, so it's not like he'll immediately find out. In this case, it's better to make a swift decision and leave immediately to catch Situ Mo off guard..."

Though Li Yuanjiao spoke confidently, a flicker of doubt lingered in his heart.

My family has gradually gained influence and can at least gather some news now… The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators likely won't make any moves. However, my greatest concern is the possibility of a group of Master Monks from Zhao State lying in wait!

He pondered this for a moment before deciding to send Kongheng to the Eastern Sea first, deliver a letter to Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak Gate to inquire about the current situation, and then strategize from there.

1. Hanlin Sword is about 131 cm long and weighs 46.5 kg. Mortals like me can't imagine swinging something this heavy around. ☜
