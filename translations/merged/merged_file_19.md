# Chapter 949: A Debt of Gratitude

Li Ximing weighed the Marvelous Wisdom Whisker in his hand. Daoist Master Luo gave a dry laugh and replied, "At the moment... I don't have any Bright Yang spiritual items on me..."

It was difficult for this demon cultivator to put on airs. Back in the Shaman Kingdoms, he was a demon lord whose word was law. But out here, he was surrounded by people like Li Ximing and Dingyang Zi—famous for their alchemy or artifact refinement—or Immortal cultivators from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition wielding multiple treasures. What could he possibly have that they would value?

He could only force a smile. "I traded my cultivation art to Daoist Friend Ning Wan, so I don't have much else to offer... However... I do have a few Bright Yang spell arts..."

Li Ximing was unimpressed. That was the one thing his own clan didn't lack. Besides, this was a demon cultivator from the Southern Borderlands; what kind of decent Bright Yang lineage could he possibly possess? He asked casually, and just as expected, they were all common goods, on the level of the Radiant Celestial Wave Art at best.

He smiled and declined. Daoist Master Luo, not daring to offer any of his own demonic cultivation methods, hesitated for a long moment. Gritting his teeth, he finally took out a white pearl that pulsed with the light of Converging Water. It was another resource for the Purple Mansion Realm, which he offered in trade.

Li Ximing wasn't so desperate as to accept just any spiritual resource. He shook his head. "Daoist Friend, I'm afraid this won't do. Fortunately, I don't have a great need for the Whisker right now, so there's no rush. My family is currently refining a suit of armor, so I'll just entrust this item to Daoist Friend Dingyang Zi. When you have something I need, or find a more suitable spiritual resource, you can retrieve it from him. If all else fails, you can find me on the lake!"

Having said his piece, he looked to Dingyang Zi. The old man's expression was calm. "That works as well. The world is unstable these days... traveling back and forth is inconvenient. I shall hold onto it for you."

Li Ximing assumed his "instability" referred to the conflict between the North and South. He offered a few polite words, silently filing away the arrangement, and then bid Dingyang Zi farewell. Calculating the time, he figured Liu Changdie was likely still in Poluoduo, so he summoned the wind and flew north.

As soon as Li Ximing was gone, Dingyang Zi's cold expression softened. He even spoke more politely to Daoist Master Luo, though his brow was furrowed.

"How many times have I told you? That item was entrusted to us by the Southern Songzhou Luoshe. It belongs to Dilu Tian Sanglin! His mastery of Southern Borderlands shamanic arts is probably unmatched. But you... you just had to ask, didn't you? You wouldn't be satisfied otherwise."

Daoist Master Luo just chuckled. "Dilu Tian Sanglin... he has a great reputation, sure, but isn't he just a traitor who sold out his friends for glory? It was just an inquiry. If he wasn't planning to defect to the Buddhist Land, why would he be causing so much trouble..."

"What nonsense is this?" Dingyang Zi frowned.

But Daoist Master Luo insisted, "If I'm lying, you can have my head!"

The crude language made Dingyang Zi wince. "That has nothing to do with you or me," he replied. "Your friend on the sea... that treasure elephant. Didn't it acquire some kind of metallic stone? You could go ask him. Better than letting this thing sit uselessly in my hands."

Daoist Master Luo laughed. "You're certainly in a hurry. One extra set of scales won't turn the tide... This is all for the sake of easing the pressure on your master's precious Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, isn't it?"

"Have you considered this? That Wei Xuanyin is already a Veiled Yin Great Daoist Master. In the Zhao Imperial Palace, there's another Veiled Yin, Zong Chang, and a Dawn Qi General, Gongsun Bei. Are you really pinning your hopes on the Li Clan to share the burden of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition? They have their hands full just dealing with Murong Yan."

Dingyang Zi's expression remained calm, and he didn't deny it. "It is enough for the White Qilin to be conspicuous and draw more attention," he said gravely. "With chaos brewing, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition truly needs to stay out of the fray and bide its time..."

...

Baihai Creek.

The lands of the Xuanmiao Temple were now shrouded in darkness, emanating a deathly stillness. Ever since Ancestor Sumian had left with his prized disciple, Qi Qiuxin, the morale of the place had utterly collapsed. The laughter and easy-going freedom of the past were nowhere to be seen.

Two streaks of light, one following the other, arrived. They materialized as a man in black-cloud-patterned mystic robes and a woman in teal-colored garments. Qi Lanyan wore a smile.

"This is the Xuanmiao Temple. Across the river is Shanji!"

Kong Tingyun's gaze swept over Jiangnan in the twilight. In just a few days, she had caught up on much of what had happened during her long seclusion. She glanced to the west, an uncontrollable emotion rising in her heart.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing... He actually succeeded!"

If one were to be precise, Kong Tingyun was the only person who had personally visited Li Qinghong to warn her that the Radiant Sky Stone must never be used by Li Ximing. Although Kong Tingyun believed her intentions were good, seeing this outcome, she couldn't help but feel a shadow pass over her heart.

'It seems Li Ximing used the Radiant Sky Stone after all. How else could he have progressed so quickly? My well-intentioned warning has become a grudge for obstructing his Dao... How can this ever be explained? Li Ximing must certainly resent me now!'

Her heart was a storm of emotions, mixed with the anxiety of seeing her kinsmen. But Qi Lanyan, who cultivated the Life Divine Ability, was exceptionally perceptive. He turned to look at her.

Kong Tingyun quickly spoke, forcing a tone of faint lament. "Senior Xiao Chuting... he has already left Jiangnan..."

"Xiao Chuting..." Qi Lanyan repeated the name, crossing his arms with a slight smile. "He built his fortune by murdering Duanmu Kui, and he's gained a lot of favor since then. It's only natural he'd move on to the Northern Sea. What's left for him to scheme over in Jiangnan?"

Kong Tingyun remained silent. They flew south together and soon arrived before Shanji Prefecture. The prefecture was shrouded in a gloomy aura, a scene of devastation, a mere shadow of its former self. When they reached the sect's main gate, they found the protective array, shimmering and transparent. Inside, the mountain range was scarred, with a peak missing here, a chunk gone there. Banners of green and red hung everywhere; it was clearly under new ownership.

Kong Tingyun lowered her gaze. Qi Lanyan stepped up to the array. Sure enough, a woman in purple robes rode the wind to meet them, stopping just short. She wore a polite, if detached, smile.

"Greetings, fellow Daoists. And congratulations, Daoist Friend Kong!"

Kong Tingyun didn't recognize the woman, but she recognized the robes of the Purple Smoke Gate. She returned the greeting politely. Qi Lanyan, however, adopted a warm expression.

"Tingyun is a disciple of my Comprehending Profoundity lineage. She achieved her Dao in Jiangbei and has come to retrieve her family."

Hearing him stress "Comprehending Profoundity disciple," Tinglan felt a deep sense of humiliation, but she kept the smile on her face. "Senior Zhu Gong is in seclusion, but fortunately, she made arrangements beforehand."

Her heart was in turmoil. She ordered her subordinates forward, and a guest elder flew up, followed by four people. At the front was an old man with deeply sunken eyes. His clothes were new and garish, and his hands were clenched nervously before him.

He seemed to have been given some potent spirit medicine, as his skin had a ruddy, healthy glow. But his eyes were wide and round, buried in their sockets, revealing an indelible panic. His body was hopelessly stooped, making him appear exceptionally small. His neck craned forward, and he tilted his head, trembling as he dared to sneak glances upward.

Kong Tingyun stared at him, stunned.

"Guxi?"

The old man looked as if he were in a dream, his lips pale, unable to speak.

When Kong Tingyun had left the sect, Kong Guxi was just a young man, known as the sect's foremost dandy. Even today, he shouldn't have been this old. But the weight of the years had completely crushed him, leaving him looking weak and broken. She hadn't even recognized him.

Behind Kong Guxi were two middle-aged people. The woman, holding a young boy's hand, had a sallow, ashen face. She was the very picture of numbness—this was the once vibrant, beautiful, and gentle Kong Qiuyan.

The man was skeletal, his eyes brimming with tears. This was Kong Xiaxiang, once known for his impulsive courage. He was holding a set of folded golden armor, upon which rested a fearsome mask, its eye sockets black and empty.

The physical torment the three had endured was nothing compared to the crushing weight on their spirits. In just over a decade, all three were like different people, huddled together as if for warmth, staring at her through the clouds with terror and disbelief.

Kong Tingyun's expression slowly changed. Her gentle, beautiful eyes quickly filled with tears. Her voice was hoarse.

"There are only... three of you left."

She looked at Kong Qiuyan, who now looked like a middle-aged matron, and asked quietly, "What is the child's surname?"

Compared to the two men beside her, Kong Qiuyan didn't show as much despair, only a profound exhaustion and confusion. "Reporting to the Daoist Master... his surname is Dai."

Qi Lanyan stood silently to the side, his gaze fixed on the low-browed Tinglan. His eyes were like cold iron, projecting a silent, powerful accusation.

'Look what you've done!'

'This is the mess your Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and your Tinglan made! You hate my Viewing Pavilion Platform for interfering, for following orders to disrupt the world's balance, but now do you see why? Look at your Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, inviting demon cultivators into Jiangnan. Are you any better?'

Tinglan's face was blank, her mind in chaos. She didn't know what to say. Should she argue that Changxi's Profound Peak was no bastion of virtue either? That Zhu Gong had already shown mercy? Or that if they hadn't invited Zhu Gong to Jiangnan, the Capital immortals Dao would have seized this place and been far more ruthless?

But it was all speculation. No matter what, she couldn't find the words. She could only say, "The Capital immortals Dao was aggressive... Zhu Gong was rash in taking in your sect's remnants. She is from the Eastern Sea, and her methods are... unrefined."

It was a reunion of choked silence. Kong Tingyun was speechless for a long time. Finally, she asked, "The disciples of Profound Peak... how many remain?"

Kong Xiaxiang was about to speak, but Kong Guxi cut him off, his voice raspy. "The sect was annihilated. Fortunately, we received Daoist Master Zhaojing's protection. This junior disbanded the disciples himself. They now make a living under the Sacred Writ Gate. As of today... Profound Peak is no more."

The coldness in Kong Tingyun's eyes deepened, but she still managed a polite bow to Tinglan. "This junior will remember Senior Zhu Gong's protection all these years. Once I have settled my disciples, and when Senior emerges from seclusion, I will be sure to pay a formal visit."

Tinglan tasted only bitterness. She sighed. Qi Lanyan gave her no further opportunity, turning with Kong Tingyun and flying away, leaving Tinglan standing alone in the moonlight.

'How quickly things change!'

Once they were clear of Shanji, Kong Tingyun's polite smile finally vanished. She looked quietly at Kong Guxi, who stood beside her as if in a dream, afraid to move lest he wake up.

"After Ancestor fell," she asked, her voice cracking, "did we really receive anyone's protection?"

Kong Guxi's feet wouldn't stay firm on the cloud. Two muddy tears rolled from his eyes. His aged face finally crumpled with the grief he had held back, a grief that could finally be released. As the other two wept behind him, he spoke through gritted teeth, his voice breaking.

"After the Daoist Master fell, we were surrounded by jackals, all wishing to devour us that very day! Our allied clans wouldn't spare us a glance! Our 'comrades' from Xuanmiao Temple celebrated in the mountains! All those Profound Peak had befriended in the past... every one of them turned a cold shoulder! There was only one... one person who showed a trace of pity, of kindness, who was willing to offer us shelter... Daoist Master Zhaojing!"

"His grace... my Kong Clan cannot repay it in nine lifetimes!"

...

The North Shore.

The mountain wind howled, whipping the snow. Flurries had begun to fall again in the mountains, blanketing the pavilion in a bustling whiteness.

But at the foot of the mountain, along the river, a massive number of cultivators were locked in bloody combat with monks. The cries of battle shook the heavens, a crimson scroll painted against a backdrop of white snow, staining the rocks a dark, glistening red.

The North had only known peace for half a year, and now, droves of monks were crossing the river again. Like locusts unafraid of death, they slammed into the great array set up by the lake cultivators. The battle escalated continuously; within three days, there had already been clashes between Foundation Establishment Realm experts and Master Monks.

Li Zhouwei, in a rare change of white robes, stood quietly in the pavilion. Li Ximing had just stepped out of the Great Void and was steeping tea. He was about to speak when he saw a figure fly through the heavy snow and kneel.

Li Ximing stopped. The man kneeling in the snow was dressed in a reserved long robe, his forehead pressed to the ground, his expression complex.

"Jueyin? What is this?"

It was Cui Jueyin. Li Ximing frowned and told him to rise, but the man didn't dare, remaining prostrate. His voice was low. "This subordinate... has come to beg for punishment!"

Li Zhouwei glanced over, surprised, as Cui Jueyin continued in a low, uneasy tone. "Some time ago, when the Daoist Master was inspecting Jiangbei, the Eastern Sea sent me a letter. They hoped that once my Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation was stable and I had a chance at the Purple Mansion Realm, I would return to the Eastern Sea to visit..."

"I never expected... a family elder would be murdered while traveling. My grandfather is in seclusion and hasn't shown any sign of movement. The island is in turmoil. Daoist Master Yangya returned to our ancestral land, and after inquiring about recent events, he sent back the Purple Mansion Realm cultivation art for the Eternal Brightness Steps. His meaning was the same... he wants this subordinate to return to the Eastern Sea for seclusion, to focus on cultivation and prepare for a breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm."

"This matter has been delayed for far, far too long. Now that the Daoist Master has given the order... I'm afraid... I can no longer avoid it."

Li Ximing froze, then shook his head, gritting his teeth. "What a Daoist Master Yangya!"

Li Zhouwei understood immediately. 'The situation is growing more intense. The Cui family's ancestor has no hope of breaking through, and Chongzhou Island still lacks a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Daoist Master Yangya doesn't want Cui Jueyin, a prized seed, to be dragged into the chaos of the North-South conflict! Even more, he doesn't want the Cui family involved in my affairs.'

Though he spoke mildly, Daoist Master Yangya's actions made his stance clear: he favored the Cui family severing its ties with the Li family. His sudden return, his discovery of the situation—he had probably cursed out everyone on Chongzhou Island. And now, he had produced a Purple Mansion Realm art, determined to force Cui Jueyin's return.

At Li Ximing's outburst, Cui Jueyin became frantic, his voice choking. "Please, milord, do not blame him! The Daoist Master has his own considerations! He means nothing else! If a rift forms between you because of this junior... I truly deserve ten thousand deaths!"

"I was waiting for the Daoist Master to return to beg forgiveness, but I haven't seen you for so long, and the order from the island is from Daoist Master Yangya himself... It cannot be delayed. Today, I was fortunate enough to run into you..."

Cui Jueyin had been on the lake for many years; it had become his home. Li Ximing trusted him more than some of his own direct descendants. Now, forced to leave, he was weeping, a sight that made Li Zhouwei fall silent.

After a long moment, Li Ximing spoke. "Since it is an order from your family's Daoist Master, we cannot force you to stay. But you have served with great merit. How can we let you leave empty-handed?"

Cui Jueyin started to protest, but Li Ximing shook his head. He retrieved several jade slips from his sleeve, placed them in a jade box, and said softly, "Take these spell arts. As for pills and resources, regardless of what Chongzhou Island provides, the lake will also prepare a share for you! You will not be lacking."

"I dare not accept the Daoist Master's resources!" Cui Jueyin said, alarmed.

Li Ximing sneered. "You dare not accept... And if I sent them to Chongzhou Island, Daoist Master Yangya wouldn't dare to accept them either. Just take them and put them in your storage bag. If Daoist Master Yangya asks, just tell him it's your compensation. A clean break!"

Li Ximing was not just pained; he was filled with a powerless rage. His voice softened. "The original agreement was for an exchange of disciples. The two Bright Yang cultivators from my family have sensitive identities, so it wasn't convenient for them to go. You've been on the island for so many years, we've long seen you as one of our own. Seeing Daoist Master Yangya's attitude, it's good they never went... I only hope you achieve your divine ability soon, and do not waste your years of cultivation."

Cui Jueyin kowtowed repeatedly, finally gathering his robes and departing. Li Zhouwei turned his head away, a pang of guilt in his heart. Li Ximing drank several cups of tea, his face an unreadable mask.

Just then, someone came to report. "Guest Elder Li Wushao has returned! He says he has an urgent matter to report!"

The snow thickened, blanketing the world. The black-robed man ascended with a gloomy expression, the shadows at his feet coiling like serpents. It was Li Wushao, returned from Azure Pond.

Quan Yuduan and his disciple-brother had intentionally revealed information, not bothering to hide it from him. They had leaked everything they had heard within the sect—news the Si Clan had obtained through its connections and background. The Demon beast hadn't dared to delay a moment, nor had he shown any sign of abnormality, returning to the lake as quickly as his schedule allowed.

Although Li Wushao was merely a Demon beast, the father and son he followed were two of the most respected figures on the lake. His own status was far from low. The moment he reported his return, he was granted unimpeded access to the two highest-cultivation Daoist Masters present.

He knelt, his voice low and grim, and began his detailed account.

'...Based on their words... it must be Daoist Master Suiguan.'

'Suiguan!'

Li Ximing, who had been half-distracted, observing the Foundation Establishment Realm skirmishes by the lake, immediately felt his gloomy mood evaporate. In its place, a deep sense of unease rose. He froze. "Why him?"

The two looked at each other, seeing the same alarm in each other's eyes. Years ago, when Li Qinghong had passed by Profound Peak, Kong Tingyun had revealed a secret:

'If the True Monarch goes beyond the heavens, Suiguan will remain in Azure Pond's Pristine Speech Heaven. He will not dare enter the Manifested Realm, much less Jiangnan.'

'This means... the battle between the True Monarchs beyond the heavens is already over! That person has likely returned to Pristine Speech Heaven!'

Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan had just arrived. The man in crimson robes, Li Jiangqian, had a dark expression, his tone icy. "It is rumored this man is a Great Daoist Master, not only at the pinnacle of the Purple Mansion Realm but also of extraordinary origins... Daoist Master Qiuhu... has likely lost her autonomy!"

'No wonder Ning Wan has been missing for months... The other Supreme Yang Daoist tradition houses probably think she's still recovering from her injuries!'

Li Que'wan, however, mused for a moment. "If Daoist Master Suiguan has returned... he is still a figure of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. With the North-South confrontation at hand, and the Kong family's matter still unclear, his stance is now even more critical."

Li Zhouwei made no comment. He listened until Li Wushao finished, then said, "This has been hard on you... to undertake such a dangerous task... and rush all the way back."

Li Wushao shook his head grimly. Li Zhouwei's eyes flashed with suspicion.

"It was speculated long ago that this Daoist Master Suiguan is similar to Dongfang Heyun. If he isn't some divine ability manifestation or a Dharma Treasure avatar, he is, at the very least, a manifestation of Pristine Water. Who knows how many years it's been since he attained his divine ability... He is in a league of his own. He might have the power to stop the North-South conflict, but pinning our hopes on him... we'd be better off considering Chi Buzi."

"As it stands, we have likely lost Ning Wan's support, and even Azure Pond Sect may no longer be willing to side with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition."

The group fell silent. Li Ximing said, "I just wonder if the other major families know."

A trace of weariness crossed Li Zhouwei's brow. Discussing Pristine Water and Suiguan was dangerous; the juniors shouldn't be involved. He exchanged a look with his great-uncle, dismissed Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan, and then continued, "I heard about Azure Pond withdrawing its people and reducing its disciples. I originally thought it was Daoist Master Qiuhu reshuffling forces to prepare for Si Yuanli's breakthrough. Now, it seems... it was Suiguan's will."

Neither of them could fathom Suiguan's intentions. They lapsed into a heavy silence.

Li Wushao, however, was meticulous. "This subordinate searched the sect but found nothing. However, when passing through the market, I obtained a portrait of Daoist Master Suiguan left by the Chi family years ago... I have brought it."

'Obtained from the market?' The implication couldn't be more obvious. It was likely the same people who had secretly leaked the news of Suiguan's return. Li Ximing sighed inwardly and nodded. "This place has no array, after all. Let's go to the island to look."

But Li Zhouwei held him back, looking thoughtful. "We'll look at it here."

The Demon beast immediately stood, lifted his sleeve, and produced a scroll. He raised it to his own eye level before pulling the silk ties, unfurling the portrait.

The man in the painting stood quietly. He was tall and slender, with long, narrow eyes. He was the only subject, but the pupils of his eyes had not been painted, leaving them blank.

Those with great divine abilities and mighty powers often had strange particularities. The True Monarchs on the Chongming Profund Insight Screen had been faceless, and Immortals were represented by a golden circle. It wasn't so strange for a Purple Mansion Realm expert's portrait to lack pupils.

The artist had been extremely cautious. The body was a mere outline, devoid of color, save for a touch of green at the corner of the robe to indicate it was a green garment. It was the typical attire of an Azure Pond Sect Purple Mansion Realm expert, green robes with golden tassels.

The artist hadn't even dared to write the name Suiguan. The sides of the scroll were empty.

'The skill is exquisite. Even from a painting, it exudes a menacing aura.'

Li Wushao was not a tall man. He held the scroll up with his arms outstretched, looking slightly awkward. A moment later, a fair, white hand gently took the scroll from his grasp, turning it around for a closer look.

The man stared at the painting in his hand, the corners of his mouth curling up. In an instant, the great blizzard seemed to pause, the flakes freezing in mid-air, becoming his backdrop.

Li Wushao stood respectfully, seemingly unaware, his gray-black pupils reflecting the other's eerie, azure-purple eyes and smiling face.

A light laugh echoed through the snow.

"Si Yuanli is far too careless. I'm nowhere near this ferocious!"

# Chapter 950: The Scroll

The man was clad in green robes, cinched with a golden tassel. His figure was slender, and his blue-black hair whipped about in the snowy wind. Against the backdrop of the frozen blizzard, he looked utterly transcendent—and he was the spitting image of the man in the painting.

His eyes, however, were what truly defined him. They held a hint of a smile, flashing with a azure-purple light that seemed to contain the very essence of his divine ability. They were the perfect finishing touch, adding an immensely uncanny and transcendent aura to his presence.

Suiguan.

Li Wushao stood quietly and respectfully, showing no reaction at all. He behaved as if the person who had just taken the painting from his hand was Li Zhouwei or Li Ximing, and he simply waited in silence for his next instruction.

'This!'

Li Ximing, however, had already shot to his feet inside the pavilion. He stood on high alert, as if facing a formidable foe. His lips were pressed into a thin line, betraying his tension as he felt the near-terrifying Pristine Water divine ability radiating from the man. The Heavenly Light between his own brows dimmed slightly in response.

'Speak of the devil and he appears! Was he lying in ambush this whole time? Did he hear what we were saying?'

'Is he here for Minghuang... or has he sensed something else amiss?'

Li Zhouwei was less surprised than his grand-uncle; he seemed to have anticipated this. He rose out of respect and gave the man a slight nod, lowering his gaze.

"Li Minghuang Zhouwei of the Moongaze Lake Li Clan greets the Great Daoist Master."

Only then did Suiguan shift his gaze from the painting, a mocking light in his eyes. He casually placed the scroll back into Li Wushao's hands as his azure-purple pupils slowly drifted over.

"Oh?"

His handsome face turned to the golden-eyed man.

"To this day, people are still raising Hooked Serpents? I suppose it's for the hooks on their tails."

The shock in Li Ximing's heart finally began to subside. His expression quickly softened, and he replied politely, "Li Wushao was one of our ancestor's Spirit Beasts. Back when our clan was weak, he rendered great service. He is an honored guest-elder of the family; we would never presume to 'raise' him."

"Most Hooked Serpents lack any significant pedigree, to say nothing of one from the Water Mansion Dao." Suiguan shook his head. "How rare. I was wondering why those youngsters from the Heaven-Probing Pavilion were so interested. So it's a trusted Demon beast acting as a confidant, that's not so surprising... It's just exceptionally rare for a Water Mansion Hooked Serpent to possess such talent... and the Morning Cold Rain at that."

His words made it perfectly clear to both of them: this man had been eavesdropping when Quan Yuduan and his disciple-brothers were speaking. A chill crept into their hearts.

'...All these Pristine Water cultivators have the same temperament... It's bad enough their minds are so sharp, but they're also masters of concealment... It's just that bastard Chi Buzi is more insidious and unscrupulous. This one, by contrast, has an added layer of domineering arrogance...'

Suiguan's expression remained neutral, but he strode forward and sat down at the round table in the pavilion. He smiled. "No need to be so courteous. Sit."

As soon as he was seated, Li Wushao moved naturally to pour tea, filling the cups for all three Daoist Masters. Li Ximing watched him furtively, noting that his expression was normal and his eyes were clear. There wasn't the slightest trace that he was being controlled by a divine ability.

'What a terrifying Life Divine Ability... I can't very well use my own divine ability to probe him right in front of Suiguan, but his expression, his movements... they all seem to stem from his own free will. There's nothing wrong at all!'

While he observed Li Wushao, Li Zhouwei was studying the renowned Great Daoist Master from Pristine Speech Heaven. His hand rested on his teacup as he mused silently:

'He's making no effort to conceal his cultivation base; it's on full display. He is a great practitioner who has completed all five arts. He wears no expensive adornments, quite different from the one at Luoxia... In terms of cultivation, Suiguan is nearly on par with the master of Mount Luoxia. But a fight is about more than cultivation; it comes down to divine ability, lineage, spell arts, and Spiritual Artifacts. Although Suiguan shows no outward signs of power, judging by his ageless appearance and the rumors linking him to the Golden Core realm, even the master of Luoxia would have to be wary of him.'

Before either of them could speak, the Great Daoist Master stared into his clear tea, his expression growing thoughtful. His voice dropped, becoming low and resonant.

"I heard... the Li clan has one who has attained a divine ability, serving under the banner of the Dragon-kin... I wonder, do you still have contact with them?"

Although no one spoke of it openly, the relationship between Du Qing and the Dragon-kin was notoriously bad. The incident where the True Hornless Dragon devoured the Feathered Serpent was known to all. It was a clear sign of Converging Water's domineering desire to annex Pristine Water. Even after this True Monarch Lushui, Du Qing, achieved his Fruition Attainment, rumors persisted that he dared not step foot outside of Jiangnan. Their relations were, of course, terrible.

The moment Li Ximing heard this, his heart sank. Li Zhouwei, however, replied, "Years ago, the Dragon-kin disseminated the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring. A clan elder happened to acquire it and, left with no choice, ventured deep into the Eastern Sea. She eventually transformed into lightning, and we have had no contact with her since."

Suiguan laughed. "Not bad at all. Li Qinghong... one rainbow, one cloud. Beijia is certainly living the good life these days. It's just a pity there are no true heroes left in the world, letting one or two of those vile dragons run rampant in the Eastern Sea!"

Li Ximing had been about to respond, but those words made him snap his mouth shut. He adopted an impassive expression, pretending he hadn't heard a thing. Suiguan, however, continued with a dark sort of humor.

"You don't need to worry about me causing trouble for her. In this climate? Forget me, even Du Qing himself wouldn't bother making a trip to the Eastern Sea.

"Other people care about their reputation. Beijia is the most shameless of all. He had the gall to brazenly ask an immortal for a title. Lying in wait for Du Qing in the Inner Sea? That's exactly the sort of thing he _would_ do."

After that, not only did Li Ximing lower his head in silence, but even Li Zhouwei found it difficult to respond. He had to stiffly change the subject.

"To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Great Daoist Master? What guidance do you have for us?"

Li Zhouwei asked. Suiguan took a sip of tea. "I came looking for you, of course."

He said, a smile playing on his lips, "I came out of Pristine Speech Heaven only to find a massive upheaval. I finally had a few useful people under my command, and now they're all gone. To make matters worse, that pack of pigs and dogs from the north is getting aggressive again. It's all deeply unpleasant."

The smile in his eyes finally faded, replaced by a sharp chill. Outside the pavilion, the falling snow hung suspended in the air, frozen solid beyond a certain radius. It was clearly enveloped by his divine ability, undetectable to any ordinary person.

"And now, I intend to cross the river to handle some business. And... to tidy up the scenery a bit."

As he spoke these words, a chill went through both listeners.

Suiguan might throw around names like Du Qing, Beijia, and "vile dragons" casually, but for years, everyone had regarded him as an extension of True Monarch Lushui's will. His actions were seen as Du Qing's intentions. The implications of his statement were therefore profound.

'Does this mean True Monarch Lushui truly intends to raise the banner of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition once more?'

"What... arrangements does the Great Daoist Master have in mind?"

Suiguan glanced at the small cup in his hand and smiled. "I want your Li clan to cross the river."

"And not just your clan. The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition must cross. The Azure Pond Sect must also cross."

Although his face was smiling, his violet-green eyes were haunting, like a placid pond that looked clear but was, in fact, a bottomless abyss that swallowed all light.

Li Zhouwei was silent for a moment before asking in a low voice, "Does the Great Daoist Master intend to wage war against the North?"

Suiguan chuckled. "What's all this talk of 'war'?"

At his words, the pavilion fell utterly silent. The Great Daoist Master rose slowly and paced a few steps, gazing out at the sky full of frozen snow.

"Within a year and a half, Qi Lanyan will inevitably start a dispute. I want them to smash their heads against the iron wall of Shanji and be driven back, losing Xuanmiao in the process..."

His face was still smiling, but it was impossible to tell how much of what he said was truth and how much was deception. He spoke as he took the scroll back from Li Wushao.

"I just need you to participate. And for the Li family to provide some of its cultivators."

"Cultivators," coming from him, clearly didn't mean Embyronic Breathing or Qi Refining peasants. He meant Foundation Establishment Realm practitioners, at the very least.

The two fell silent, considering his words. Suiguan turned his head, seemingly unconcerned, and picked up the scroll again.

He produced an ink brush from thin air, dipped it lightly into the tea in his cup, and then unfurled the scroll. He gently dotted the brush twice within the painting's empty eye sockets.

_Drip!_

Instantly, the sound of Pristine Water echoed, dripping without end. Grotto-springs seemed to gush forth as clouds and rain churned. A damp, watery qi spread through the air, forming layered veils of pale green mist.

Violet-green pupils materialized within the two empty sockets. The faint green that had merely hinted at the color of the robes rapidly expanded, flooding the painting with full, vibrant color. The entire scroll came to life, as if Suiguan himself were standing within it.

"Ning Wan will arrive first. When she does, your Li clan and the Azure Pond Sect are to cross the river and pin down the enemy. Those few Purple Mansion Realm rogue cultivators will be deployed alongside you."

He held the top of the scroll and rolled it up with gentle, meticulous care. He even retied the silk ribbon, making the entire package neat and tidy before placing it on the table.

Li Zhouwei watched silently, the light in his golden eyes flickering. He could faintly sense the surging Pristine Water power contained within the scroll. Suiguan had already turned and was slowly descending the steps, his voice drifting back with that same mocking laugh.

"Your family... being pinned against the riverbank by all those northern figures... Don't you have any temper at all? Make a list. If there's anyone who's rubbed you the wrong way, feel free to 'invite them to view the painting' when the time comes."

Before his voice finished echoing, the green-robed man had vanished. The world of frozen snow instantly resumed its motion. A whistling, cold wind gusted into the pavilion, sending ripples across the surface of the tea.

"Caw!"

The long, drawn-out caw of a distant crow punctuated the scene as the blizzard, and all its attendant noises, returned to life. The world was no longer silent.

"Huuu..."

Li Ximing let out a heavy breath. He saw that Li Wushao still hadn't noticed anything unusual and was standing quietly at his side. "You may go," he said.

Li Wushao bowed and swiftly departed. Only the two Daoist Masters remained in the snowy pavilion. A faint Heavenly Light enveloped them, and in a flash, the pavilion was empty.

The two traveled by light, reappearing a moment later within the Cloud-Gathering Southern Sky grand formation on Cold Cloud Peak. The lanterns lining the path brightened slightly at their arrival. Li Ximing glanced at the scroll in his hand—he did not open it, of course—and passed it to Li Zhouwei. Li Zhouwei found a private, secure vault to hang it in, and then the two vanished in silence.

They flickered into existence within the inner sanctum of their own Purple Mansion formation. Only then did Li Ximing lower his eyes and dare to speak, sighing as he shook his head.

"In this world... there are truly no safe places left."

"Suiguan's command... Tinglan and Houfu will find it impossible to refuse. Besides, the situation with Qi Lanyan is their problem to begin with, so they have no reason to decline. This matter is set in stone."

Li Zhouwei nodded, reflecting, "Although I don't know his true objective, as long as Suiguan is willing to make a move, the situation will change completely. We must be prepared."

His golden eyes were full of calculation. Li Ximing said in a low voice, "He most likely came here for this scroll, to use it as a trump card. First, he wants to take advantage of the fact that you are difficult to divine, which will let him catch the North off-guard. Second... he wanted to meet you."

"This matter... I fear I shouldn't get involved."

They had both arrived at the same conclusion. Li Zhouwei's expression was grim. "Grand-uncle is right. It's long been said that his behavior is erratic, that he may not even be human. How much of what he says can be trusted? What if this is just Pristine Water's master expressing dissatisfaction with Mount Luoxia's recent actions, making a subtle move? Suiguan isn't known for caring about his subordinates. As pawns in their game, how many of us can expect a good outcome? Grand-uncle, you absolutely must not get involved."

"His words were mainly directed at me. After all, I'm the one who cannot be divined. At most, grand-uncle should remain here to guard the lake and prepare for any sudden changes."

Li Zhouwei calculated for a moment, then continued, "Fortunately, according to his timeline, we have about a year and a half. That's barely enough time to try and touch the Immortal Foundation... More importantly, the Grand Ascension should be ready by then. At least I won't have to fight them bare-handed."

Li Zhouwei had clashed with the northern cultivators once or twice before. While he hadn't suffered any major losses, fighting empty-handed was incredibly frustrating. Now that he was about to face even more intense combat, having a proper weapon was essential.

Li Ximing quietly explained the situation with Qize. Li Zhouwei simply said, "A year or so is enough time for you to travel to the Eastern Sea, handle your affairs, and return to cultivate. Besides, your methods are far more advanced than before. Even if something happens on the mainland, you'll be able to sense it from a thousand li away."

Seeing Li Ximing's thoughtful expression, Li Zhouwei added in a low voice, "Our family possesses the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, which is far more miraculous than any ordinary grotto-heaven. No matter where you are, as long as it's safe, you can ascend to it. If something happens on the mainland, and I get a moment to breathe, I can crush a jade talisman to alert you. You can then enter the Heaven, and we can meet and discuss matters in detail, even if we are a thousand li apart."

They couldn't send messages across such a distance, but the grotto-heaven provided a clever solution. Li Ximing smiled.

"That's an excellent idea! For this next year and a half, if you are in seclusion within the Heaven, it won't matter if I'm far off in the Barbarian Lands or all the way in Wu State. I can just fly into the grotto-heaven, and I'll be right by your side, ready to discuss things instantly."

"Exactly." Li Zhouwei smiled, but added with a touch of regret, "Unfortunately, I am being watched. I can't enter the Heaven as freely as you can, grand-uncle. I'll only be able to use the excuse of 'seclusion' to cultivate for a while when Ning Wan and the others arrive to take my post... If the North stirs up trouble, I may not even get that peace."

"For now, the Qi Lanyan contingent is focused on Shanji. Things should remain quiet for a while."

Li Ximing offered a word of comfort, then his expression grew serious. "Since we have the Radiant Qilin Refining Art, why don't you first take the Neck Feathers to Golden Feather and exchange them for the spirit flowers? When I return from the Feather Transformation Pool, I'll start the furnace immediately! What good will relying on just one or two spirit pills from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition do?

"This is no time to be stingy with resources. We need to refine that Immortal Foundation as soon as possible. Use the Azure Talisman, and have you achieve the Body Divine Ability. That is what matters."

Li Ximing had a point. The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition had limited stock; they would only give one or two pills, and it would incur a debt of gratitude. But with Li Ximing's current alchemy skill, if he were to refine Bright Yang medicinal pills, who knew how many he could produce in a single batch!

Regarding the Azure Talisman, however, Li Zhouwei had other ideas. He said nothing, but thought to himself:

'No matter how the situation develops, to achieve my goals, I need as many variables on my side as possible. The Azure Talisman is a variable that no one can divine. Once I use it, that advantage is wasted. I'd rather take a few more pills than expend it. I'll keep it hidden in my Shengyang Acupoint... at a critical moment, it will be of great use!'

# Chapter 951: Perilous Tread

The Eastern Sea churned with restless waves.

Two streaks of light, one white and one gold, arrived in a flash. They crossed the churning waters and soon sighted Long Helm Island, shaped like a suit of armor.

Compared to its desolation over the years, Long Helm Island was now a bustling place. Cultivators in uniform attire flew back and forth, all busy Li family members dispatched here in recent years.

The two passed directly through the Great Void and landed on the island. Beneath the island's palace, levels of steps had been carved, leading deep underground. The pair descended, quickly arriving above the baleful lake.

In the pitch-blackness, the Wave-Suppressing Mansion sat atop the Dark-Seal Baleful Liquid, appearing exceptionally tall and noble. Endless baleful gales shrouded the air above it. The place was not only empty, but compared to when they had left, there was not the slightest trace of change.

The Li family's rules were strict. With no Purple Mansion Realm expert guarding it and no orders coming from the lake, the cultivators on the island feared disrupting something and did not dare set foot here. Li Ximing smiled faintly and said, "Please."

Liu Changdie's face was filled with astonishment. He had clearly sensed the wondrous nature of the array. He stroked his beard, his eyes flashing with surprise, too astonished for words. He only said, "What a treasure! A true work of heaven-defying creation!"

The two entered the Wave-Suppressing Mansion together, greeted by a vast, circular hall. The walls were carved with entwined turtles and terrapins, an intricate dance of black and white. Tables of deep blue with gold-inlaid patterns were arrayed neatly. The atmosphere was one of grandeur and majesty.

Li Ximing's gaze naturally locked onto the Feather Transformation Pool. The pool's water had become as warm and lustrous as jade, emitting waves of soft white light.

From the time he left this place, traveled to and from Poluoduo, and then refined several pills in succession, a full year had passed.

Now, the water in the pool was just one final step away from coalescing into a set of Neck Feathers!

Liu Changdie's perception was extremely sharp. Almost in sync with him, his gaze fell upon the Feather Transformation Pool in the center of the hall. He strode forward, leaned down, and stared intently at the pristine white dharma pool, shaken beyond words.

"Ximing... do you have control of this grand array?"

Li Ximing was the sole master of the Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array, so it moved like an extension of his own limbs. With a mere thought, his spiritual sense connected to the array and instantly recorded Liu Changdie's aura.

The moment Liu Changdie connected to the array, he pressed his hands to the pool's edge without hesitation. Streaks of silver light immediately began to flow around the water, accompanied by the clinking and clanking of chains.

"Vault-Beam Silver!"

The white water in the pool swirled rapidly. The water level dropped, vanishing completely in an instant. A silvery-white, metallic-looking feather lay at the bottom of the empty pool.

The Neck Feathers.

'So fast!'

Li Ximing used a divine ability to retrieve it, placing it in a box with satisfaction. Liu Changdie, however, remained focused. He gently brushed the white jade at the bottom of the pool. The surface swiftly turned transparent, revealing countless runes embedded within.

He stared, transfixed. A silvery-white light surfaced in his eyes as they reflected the myriad runes, as if he were using a divine ability to rapidly record them. He murmured, "Such an ingenious concept! How is this any different from creating a spirit tree or spirit flower from scratch! There must be a Water Mansion treasure here, borrowing its very 'position'!"

Li Ximing was stunned. Although he held the array disk, he couldn't tell what materials had been used. He mused internally, 'I already have the Profound Lake Primal Essence. Could there be something else hidden within the array? That would make sense!'

Liu Changdie looked up, his eyes blazing. "Ximing, if you dismantle the Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array, you will definitely be rewarded!"

"..."

Li Ximing put on an awkward expression of sudden realization. Liu Changdie, however, waved his hands, answering his own question. "No, it cannot be dismantled! It mustn't! Such a precious technique from a senior... it must be studied properly!"

He simply left Li Ximing standing to the side, becoming completely engrossed. Fortunately, he retained some lucidity. Though his eyes wouldn't move, he managed to say, "Please, lend me this treasured place for a time! Rest assured, Ximing, with the Vault-Beam Silver, the condensation speed of this spirit item will be at least half a year faster!"

Li Ximing nodded, satisfied. He subconsciously touched his waist and felt his jade pendant warm up. He knew Li Zhouwei had sent someone to retrieve the Profound Shell Flower-Leaves from the Golden Feather Sect.

'I can go to the grotto-heaven immediately and refine these leaves into pills. We can both take them.'

Thus, he wasted no time and made an excuse to leave. Liu Changdie, however, stood up abruptly, looking hurried. "Let's go out together. It's inconvenient for me on the island. Ximing, why don't you assign someone to run errands for me."

"That's easily done!"

The two Daoist Masters immediately exited the earth veins, traversed the Great Void, and landed in the main palace. The white-robed man in the main hall was startled and hurried over to greet them. "This subordinate pays his respects to the Daoist Masters!"

An Siwei was dressed in white. Though he still had the appearance of a middle-aged man, his entire demeanor had taken on a mature, almost aged quality. He had grown a long beard and removed the gold rings he used to wear, appearing very plain.

As the Li family's first Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator with an outside surname, An Siwei's talent wasn't terrible. Unfortunately, his cultivation technique was not profound, nor had he enjoyed abundant resources in his youth. He had only just broken through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. With the North-South conflict raging, sending him into battle would be a death sentence. Thus, he had been dispatched here along with Li Wen.

On the Riverbank, he might have been the most useless of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, perhaps even worse than Li Wen. But out here, he had no problem clashing with a few demonic cultivators. He was also loyal, making this a position that suited him well.

Li Ximing felt a sense of warmth seeing him. As they flew toward the center of the island, he asked about his recent life. Liu Changdie, however, wore a complex expression. He suddenly asked, "That An Zheyan... how is he now?"

An Siwei was stunned for a moment, then recalled that this Daoist Master had visited the Li family years ago. Perhaps they were acquainted. At the mention of his father, sadness clouded his face, and he quickly replied, "Father... he is ancient. He was retired at home, but he kept raising a fuss, insisting on seeing me. His time must be near. He was brought to the island yesterday... his mind is no longer clear. He just keeps shouting for duck soup..."

"Oh!" Liu Changdie replied. He adjusted his robes, his expression complicated, and asked, "Where is the old man? I shall go and see him!"

Liu Changdie knew An Zheyan. When he had been constructing the array for the Li family, the old man had been his liaison. Not only that, they had known each other in a past life... The first fortune he ever made... was from taking a spirit herb from Lixia Prefecture that An Zheyan was meant to discover in his prime.

Although he had been plagued by inner demons back then, he eventually attained great enlightenment, transforming all his obsessions into the will to seek the Dao, break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and right his wrongs. But facing this scene now, his heart filled with an indescribable bitterness.

'In my past life, Old Man An was nowhere near the end of his lifespan at this point. I heard he was even trying to gather resources to make an attempt on the Foundation Establishment Realm... Seeing him like this... perhaps he simply lost the heart to continue.'

Li Ximing also felt a pang of sympathy. Since Liu Changdie wished it, he nodded his assent. The three descended and soon found the man in a courtyard.

The old man's head was still gleaming bald, but the white whiskers on his temples and chin were extremely long, hanging down to his chest. A leather cap hung from the side of his chair. He was leaning back, one hand on the armrest, the other on his forehead, looking drowsy.

The moment An Siwei entered the room, the old man shot upright. His eyes, wide and turbid, stared out. "Jingming! Is the Yu family here?"

An Siwei's face paled slightly. He moved forward to support him, speaking softly, "Father, a Daoist Master is here to see you."

Li Ximing remained silent. He remembered seeing him in his childhood: a strong, slightly simple and honest man. Although he had heard that An Zheyan was once a brutal Family Head, in all his years with the Li family, he had been a gentle and sentimental old man.

'There's no essence, energy, or spirit left in him. He's being kept alive solely by a few spirit medicines the An family managed to scrounge up...'

As Li Ximing stood silently, Liu Changdie's eyes reddened. He stood frozen in place. "Old Man An... Old Man An..."

The old man on the chair showed no reaction. Even hearing the words "Daoist Master," he merely groaned, his mouth trembling open. "Aiya... you... why haven't you left yet!"

Tears welled in An Siwei's eyes. "It's me... Siwei."

An Zheyan stared at him blankly, as if suddenly remembering something. His two old, withered hands shot out and grasped his. "Must... avoid wine... and avoid women..."

"Yes..." An Siwei choked out a reply.

The old man mumbled again, lost in confusion, "Be careful... in word and deed... always protect yourself..."

"Yes..."

"Do not... think of revenge..."

No matter what the old man muttered, An Siwei tearfully answered him. An Zheyan sat there, dazed, repeating the same few phrases over and over. Finally, his gaze seemed to focus on An Siwei's face. "Oh... and have children..."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He was about to step forward and use a divine ability to keep him coherent a little longer, but Liu Changdie cried out, "Just let him go..."

In that instant, the old man's head slumped forward.

The final words An Jingming had spoken to him no longer echoed in his mind. The door to that inner room in the An residence no longer opened in terrifying ways in his fantasies. The dimness of the hidden passage was gone. The guilt and illusions that had tormented him in his dying years finally vanished, along with his life.

But as his son watched, the old, worn-out face remained frozen in a daze rooted in profound terror.

Liu Changdie couldn't bear to look. He turned his head away, retrieved a jade box from his sleeve, and placed it beside An Siwei. He hurried out of the courtyard. He and Li Ximing walked for some time before he lowered his head and said wretchedly, "He should be sent back to Mount Yuting for burial."

---

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

A faint medicinal fragrance permeated the white mist. A golden censer swayed gently, its ivory-white corners glinting with spiritual light. The Daoist Master lightly raised his hand, and eight streams of golden-white light, linked head-to-tail, landed in his palm.

Li Ximing let out a breath, stored the censer, and strolled out of the small courtyard. He ascended the steps of the pavilion and saw Li Zhouwei, who was cultivating quietly within.

"Eight Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills!"

He revealed a smile. The eight golden-white, scale-covered pills formed a circle, floating up and down as they were nurtured by the Bright Yang divine ability in his hand.

"Uncle-Grandfather has excellent alchemy skills!" Li Zhouwei took the four pills apportioned to him, letting out a laugh.

Li Ximing mused, "I find the medicinal strength is a step weaker than those from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. It's because the Bright Yang has been declining in recent years, so the spirit ingredients aren't as potent. They only have about eighty to ninety percent of the original efficacy. Fortunately, the quantity is sufficient, so it's not a major issue."

"It is already exceptional," Li Zhouwei said. "The Golden Feather Sect said they have plenty of Profound Shell Flower-Leaves in stock. The new one that blooms each year can be given to our family. If we get eight pills every time, it's more than enough for both of us to cultivate. What normal Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could dream of such conditions?"

"Haha." That much was true. Li Ximing laughed in agreement.

Li Zhouwei then lowered his voice. "Uncle-Grandfather... Senior Tingyun has appeared!"

"What?" Li Ximing's heart jolted, a mix of joy and complex feelings filling him. Though he had been prepared for this, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

Li Zhouwei continued, "Daoist Master Qiuhu has already reached the lake and is currently in the Wilderness area. I received word from her. Kong Tingyun has, in fact, already been to Shanji and retrieved several Kong family members. But Fu Yuezi... he couldn't wait until today. He perished in the chaos during the time Zhu Gong was away."

"Although there's been no word since, the territory of Xuanmiao Temple is in constant flux. From the North's intentions... it seems Xuanmiao has also been placed under Kong Tingyun's jurisdiction for the time being."

Li Ximing replied, "From what Suiguan told me, it was already a done deal. This is just the dust settling. Logically, we should meet with her, no matter what. The fact that there's no news probably means she can't cross the river."

"Is there any change in Ning Wan?"

At Li Ximing's question, Li Zhouwei just shook his head silently. "No difference at all. Just a hint of helplessness in her expression... I didn't speak with her for long. But... it's only eight months until the sacrificial rites. Jiangchun has already been brought back."

"This is the work of a 'great personage', after all." Li Ximing sighed and departed from the pavilion.

Li Zhouwei sat down cross-legged. The white, scaled pill appeared in his hand, and he swallowed it. 'While matters outside are still quiet, this is the perfect time to refine my Immortal Foundation!'

Spirit pills were normally used to temper one's divine abilities. But with resources now abundant, Li Zhouwei was eager to advance. Sovereign's Perilous Tread already possessed a cultivation base, and he was aiming straight for a perfect Immortal Foundation.

Within the grotto-heaven, light and dark were indistinguishable. Auras surged. After a long period of meditation, his sea of qi began to swell. The Sovereign's Perilous Tread dharma power within it, catalyzed by the spirit pill, rose rapidly. With one great push, it surged upwards!

A dark-golden color gathered as his dharma power churned. In a daze, he perceived radiance all around him.

The Sovereign's Perilous Tread Immortal Foundation was complete!

Perhaps aided by the spirit pill, the process was startlingly easy. The moment it formed, his mind achieved perfect clarity.

'Use the Bright Yang nature to "tread peril," and thus overcome it. The five Bright Yang divine abilities are not just abilities; they each represent one of the five predicaments of Bright Yang. And Sovereign's Perilous Tread symbolizes the monarch in a humble and dangerous position, with Bright Yang seeking to correct its stance!'

And Li Zhouwei, as one favored by Bright Yang but currently possessing a low cultivation, wasn't this the very meaning of Sovereign's Perilous Tread? Naturally, his progress was rapid.

'In contrast, Audience with the Celestial Gate is the "face" and "presence" of a fully realized Bright Yang, completely unsuited for my current situation. If the family had obtained Sovereign's Perilous Tread back then instead of Audience with the Celestial Gate, my breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm would have been far faster!'

'Even cultivating it now as my second divine ability, it should be much quicker than I originally anticipated!'

This realization prompted a deeper thought.

"If not for Luoxia's suppression, if reincarnated bodies like Chu Yi and Lin Feng cultivated Sovereign's Perilous Tread... it would be equivalent to Li Qianyuan himself embracing the perilous position and breaking the danger. Wouldn't that force Bright Yang to hang suspended in the sky, directly transforming him into the monarch-father of the world? That... is a terrifying thought!"

But he had no time for further reflection. He snapped his eyes open, a golden-white light flashing through them. He looked up, a thoughtful expression on his face.

On the main seat in the pavilion, the pristine white jade vase that was used to store the Azure Talisman was trembling slightly. As if it had received a summons, plumes of white, mist-like smoke emerged from it, but they could only circle the vase, unable to break free.

'Is this... the family's sacrificial rites?'




# Chapter 952: A Joyful Occasion

The jade bottle stood quietly on the table, its three vertical lines glowing faintly. A vaporous white energy formed pale halos of light. Li Zhouwei gazed at it, his heart stirring, and slowly stepped forward.

But that single step caused the jade bottle on the table to tremble. The white energy, as if agitated, converged at the bottle's mouth. In an instant, it transformed into a swirling, continuous beam of white light. It rose slowly, then shot toward him like a comet!

Li Zhouwei's pupils dilated. He instinctively wanted to leap away but managed to suppress the urge, forcing himself to stay still.

He felt a roiling eruption within his Shengyang Acupoint. The divine ability and dharma power on either side parted like a receding tide. A speck of white light emerged from the center. It flickered, as if drawn by some unseen force, and swiftly descended through his twelve-fold tower, dropping into his Sea of Qi.

The dharma power in his Sea of Qi also parted. His Sovereign's Perilous Tread released waves of dark-gold light, rising like the morning sun breaking through clouds, reaching up to receive it!

The scattered white energy swirled around the Sovereign's Perilous Tread, rapidly condensing into a brilliant white light about a finger's width. It looked like a tiny talisman, and it drifted down to adhere to the dark-golden radiance.

If this had happened before, Li Zhouwei would have hesitated, needing time to think. But he had just received the Illuminating Sun and Moon. How could he not recognize this?

'Talisman Qi?!'

Li Zhouwei's mind was still somewhat blank, his heart pounding.

'There’s more Talisman Qi?! The second immortal foundation gets it too?!'

In that brief instant, he first bowed deeply. He silently moved away from the main seat of honor, turned, and exited the room. Only then did he manage to calm his racing heart.

He turned his spiritual sense inward, slowly inspecting his Sea of Qi.

Within the Sea of Qi, the Sovereign's Perilous Tread immortal foundation was pulsing with light. But as his spiritual sense sank into it, this Talisman Qi did not respond, nor did it transmit any of its profound marvels or transformations.

He analyzed it for a long moment before understanding gradually dawned, and joy began to blossom within him.

This talisman was different from those received during sacrificial rites. It didn't seem to resonate with his personal life-mandate. It merely submerged itself into the immortal foundation, exerting the inherent function of Talisman Qi: to drive his divine ability and dharma power, and to continuously resonate with the foundation beneath it, nourishing and interfacing with his dharma power.

'The most significant effect... is that it increases the speed at which the immortal foundation is perfected! And it can temper my dharma power day and night, without rest!'

Based on Li Zhouwei's brief perception, its operational speed seemed much slower than his own cultivation, but this was still an extraordinary boon.

A typical Purple Mansion Realm cultivator took five to ten years to perfect an immortal foundation. Li Zhouwei's own speed was faster, and with the boost from Sovereign's Perilous Tread itself, he had originally estimated it would take about three years. Including the time to _form_ the foundation, he could attempt to condense a divine ability every five years. This was already half the time of a normal cultivator, who would take ten years or more.

Of course, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator raising an immortal foundation into a divine ability rarely succeeded on the first try. Three to five attempts were not uncommon... meaning it would still take over a decade to form a second divine ability. And _that_ was considered extremely fast within the Purple Mansion Realm.

This was why Li Ximing hadn't been in a rush to cultivate for the past two or three years. In the grand scale of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's life, this period was very short, and he was still far from forming a divine ability.

But now, if he (Li Zhouwei) were to stop cultivating entirely to focus on studying spell arts, the immortal foundation would still be catalyzed by the Talisman Qi and slowly perfect itself. He estimated it would take only five or six years. If he also entered seclusion to cultivate, the speed would be even faster—perhaps less than two years!

In the time it took others for a single attempt, he had enough time to account for three failures. Although the Purple Mansion Realm became harder to cultivate in the later stages, the time saved by this automatic cultivation was a tangible, solid boost to his cultivation base and Dharma Arts. 'After all, not everyone can achieve lightning-fast breakthroughs through self-cultivation. Not everyone is Chi Buzi or Daoist Master Zimu!'

'Whether it's the Murong family, the Touba family, or even the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, they all have their own methods to help achieve a divine ability. They might save some time or even increase the success rate. But compared to the tyrannical efficacy of my family's Talisman Qi, their methods are probably on the level of Mount Luoxia, the Underworld, or the Dragon-kin!'

'I wonder if this catalytic speed is related to my own cultivation speed, or to the difficulty of cultivating the immortal foundation or the divine ability itself...'

He ran the calculations, feeling a thrill of excitement. He opened his eyes and hurried downstairs.

Li Ximing was in seclusion below, his aura calm and steady. Li Zhouwei didn't want to disturb him, but he knocked lightly on the door. Instantly, golden light flowed out like water.

Li Ximing saw his urgency and paused, stunned.

"Did the northerners break through to the lake?"

Li Zhouwei laughed. "No," he said, ushering him upstairs and explaining the situation in detail.

"It's possible that by entering this place, obtaining the immortal ascension method, and forming a second immortal foundation, one can then receive Talisman Qi from the bottle... But I don't know the exact conditions. It might require breaking through in this top-floor attic, right in front of this treasure..."

"I didn't dare delay. I see that Uncle-Grandfather is also cultivating a Dao foundation. Even if you can't form one every five years, one every ten years would be magnificent. This opportunity cannot be missed, so I came down to get you!"

Li Ximing was dumbfounded. He mulled over the words for a long time before saying with a hint of regret:

"Then I truly miscalculated! I should have cultivated this immortal foundation much earlier. Then I wouldn't be sitting here envying Tinglan's Traversal Token!"

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"It's even better if you have it. You can accelerate your cultivation while practicing your Dharma Arts at the same time... What is Uncle-Grandfather's cultivation level now?"

Regret was one thing, but Li Ximing's eyes were now filled with hope and anticipation. The second divine ability, once impossibly distant, suddenly seemed much closer. He shook his head.

"It's only been about half a year. Naturally, I can't compare to you. But a single Purple Mansion spirit pill has a tremendous effect, and it's still not fully refined in my Sea of Qi... I estimate it will take less than a year."

"I was preoccupied with cultivating the Great Parting's White Brilliance. I wasn't expecting to form a divine ability on the first try anyway. This is even better. I'll just hurry up and condense this immortal foundation, then I can just wait."

Li Zhouwei nodded repeatedly, his mood much improved. He touched his waist, revealing a jade talisman that was glowing with a warm, clear light. It was a report from the Li family's direct lineage outside. Since it hadn't shattered, it wasn't urgent and didn't require him to exit seclusion.

He smiled, a light flashing in his eyes, and cupped his hands.

"I shouldn't stay here too long, lest others get restless. Now that I've completed my cultivation, I'll go out and take a look. Who knows, there might be good news."

He dissolved into light and vanished. When he opened his eyes again, he was inside the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda. Under his feet, arcs of silver lightning rippled like water.

As soon as he exited the main hall, his golden eyes flashed. His spiritual sense swept out in all directions. A small smile touched his lips, and he walked quickly, soon appearing in a side hall within the inner array.

The hall door was slightly ajar, revealing the faint flickering light of Dharma Arts. A delicate-featured young boy was sitting at a desk, meticulously studying a wooden slip spread open in the center, which was covered in elegant, inked characters.

The child had rather pale skin and refined features. He was so young that his appearance was almost androgynous. Though he had yet to mature, one could already see the handsome figure he would one day become.

Li Zhouwei pushed the door open and entered. The boy immediately looked up, covered the wooden slip, and scrambled somewhat awkwardly off the high chair, his voice still childish.

"Chun'er pays respects to the Daoist Master!"

Li Zhouwei had never met him. 'The boy has no spiritual sense, so he shouldn't be able to gauge my cultivation. He's a clever one.' He strode closer, his golden eyes narrowing with a smile.

"You recognize me?"

Though Li Jiangchun was young, his etiquette was perfect. He bowed.

"Mother often taught me that those with golden eyes are of the Daoist Master's bloodline. I have met my older brothers. If I meet one I don't recognize, even if his robes are different from the ones in the painting, he must be the Daoist Master."

Li Zhouwei's Yuan'e Soft Armor had been sent to Qize. He was wearing simple white robes for a change, making him harder to recognize. He smiled and sat down beside the child.

"What cultivation method did you obtain?"

Li Jiangchun simply shook his head. "I do not know what the Daoist Master is speaking of."

Li Zhouwei paused for a moment, then let out a short laugh and shook his head. A faint golden light shimmered behind him as he began asking the boy about his birth date and his hobbies. He had only asked a few questions when he heard hurried footsteps outside. Li Jiangqian, clad in crimson robes, pushed open the door, bowed in the courtyard, and said respectfully:

"Congratulations on exiting seclusion, Father!"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his smiling gaze still fixed on the child. Li Jiangchun hopped down from the chair again and bowed.

"Big Brother said the secret must not be told to anyone. Once spoken, the listener will die, and the speaker will also die... I have heard the Daoist Master has many transformations. This junior has offended you, senior."

"Hahaha!"

`Li Jiangqian` was a calculating one. 'He must have been afraid the child wouldn't understand the gravity, so he resorted to threats.' Li Zhouwei had no intention of correcting him. He laughed with obvious amusement, his good mood apparent. Turning to Li Jiangqian, he gestured to the kneeling boy.

"Pang Yunqing is truly worthy of her famous family. She has taught him very well."

Li Jiangqian had only heard that last part, but he understood the situation completely. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, stepped forward, and presented it with both hands.

"Reporting to Father. We obtained a [Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record] and the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra... The first is an extremely profound Dharma Art! The second... it cannot be transcribed..."

"Oh?"

A flash of understanding crossed Li Zhouwei's pupils. He accepted the slip and glanced at it, a sound of admiration escaping him.

"What a fine set of spell arts!"

Although Lesser Yin didn't conflict with Bright Yang, he himself would certainly never cultivate this kind of Dharma Art. Li Zhouwei merely scanned it before handing it back with a smile.

"When you return this time, fetch the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity for him to read."

The more he looked at Li Jiangchun, the wider his smile became. He took the boy's hand.

"The Lesser Yin path is rare in our family, and rare in all of Jiangnan, but its power is far from small. Since you obtained this today, you must cultivate it diligently."

Li Jiangchun respectfully agreed. When he looked up again, his golden-eyed... 'uncle' had vanished. He committed the words to memory. He followed his brother out, passing through layer after layer of arrays, until he finally saw his father.

Zhouluo looked nervous. He was sitting in a side seat in the vast hall, restlessly rubbing the hilt of his sword. When he saw the two emerge, he looked up, his expression a mix of joy and apprehension.

"How did it go?"

Li Jiangqian had taken the boy on the pretext of visiting the two Daoist Masters to request a Daoist method. But Zhouluo, recognizing the critical timing, seemed to recall something.

As a core member of the direct lineage, he knew that all children visited the hall at age six. He understood it was a family procedure. He had undergone similar treatment himself, though he only vaguely remembered kneeling before _something_. He had likely been passed over, his own opportunity missed. The thought made him anxious as he inwardly speculated:

'It isn't just about testing talent or bestowing a method. Other than Que'Wan, whom the senior selected personally all those years ago, perhaps all the other children must go through this step: paying respects to the ancestors' Dharma swords to appeal for a wisp of spirituality.'

He was lost in thought when he saw Li Jiangqian smile.

"Congratulations... congratulations!"

Zhouluo jolted, his eyes wide with shock and joy. Li Jiangqian shot him a meaningful look. Zhouluo beamed.

"I'll go pick out a sword manual for our little brother right now!"

...

Li Zhouwei took a single step and reappeared above the shimmering surface of the lake, his light descending onto the Viewing Pavilion Platform. The red-robed old man was stroking his beard as he tended the fire. Li Jiangzong was beside him, bent at the waist, listening to the old man's explanations with rapt attention.

Li Jiangzong cultivated True Fire and was being trained as the Li family's next-generation artifact refiner. He had clearly not been idle these past days. He had a good reputation in the clan, and he was exceptionally polite toward Chu Minglian, humbly seeking his guidance.

This was a common sight, which was why Li Zhouwei was able to take it in at a glance. As he landed on the platform, everyone bowed. Li Jiangzong came forward to greet him, his face full of joy.

"Not bad!"

Li Zhouwei offered a word of praise. Chu Minglian also hurried to turn and bow respectfully.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

"Progress has been quick."

Li Zhouwei glanced around and saw that all twelve positions on the platform were now filled. Among them were several green-robed cultivators he didn't recognize. He instantly understood. As expected, Chu Minglian explained:

"Ever since Daoist Master Ning came here, she heard the Daoist Master was perfecting a spirit embryo and sent several people over to help. The Grand Ascension is already in the nourishment stage. It's just a hair's breadth from completion. I must ask you to take a look, Daoist Master!"

The Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire could accommodate up to twelve Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators assisting at once. The Li family hadn't had that kind of manpower, so they had been rotating six people. Ning Wan had plenty of cultivators under her command, so she had sent help.

'If I hadn't come out of seclusion three or five days early, it would have been finished anyway. Now, it just needs the final push.'

After speaking, Chu Minglian hesitated for a moment before adding in a low voice:

"This humble one also discovered something that must be reported... The treasure accepts the fire and the refinement process with remarkable ease. Its internal patterns are clear and flow naturally... This humble one suspects... suspects this item has a significant history."

He was clearly uncertain and didn't dare say more. Li Zhouwei, however, reacted instantly. He raised an eyebrow.

"Is it a spirit embryo from an ancient cultivator that has degenerated over time?"

Chu Minglian kept his voice low.

"It is highly likely..."

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly. The Grand Ascension had been recovered from the Green Pine Grotto-Heaven. The speculation was reasonable. Perhaps it had originally been a spirit embryo locked onto the platform by some secret art. It might have degraded due to the long passage of time or some change in the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment.

As they spoke, his Bright Yang divine ability surged along the lines of light, gradually dyeing the spirit embryo suspended above the platform with color. The divine ability and dharma power within his body depleted rapidly.

"Omm!"

As he poured his dharma power into it, the final stage of the refining process was completed. The Viewing Pavilion Platform erupted in dazzling golden light. The long halberd shrank into a single point of gold and drifted gently into his palm.

The gold expanded from his palm, revealing the deep-golden halberd. The long tines at its end curved like a crescent moon, large enough to almost obscure Chu Minglian's entire upper body.

The haft of the halberd extended down to the platform, its round, blunt golden tail striking the dais with a crisp sound. At once, respectful congratulations echoed from all sides.

Grand Ascension!

This dharma artifact had come from the Green Pine Temple Grotto-Heaven. Its fundamental quality was extremely high, placing it at the very top tier of spirit embryos. Even before, it could augment him with its bright light. The halberd could also project a glaring sunlight to affect his enemies. Now that it was fully refined, its marvels manifested one by one.

The first was [Attachment].

This marvel had clearly evolved from its former light-augmentation ability. When he wielded the weapon, the light of the Bright Yang would augment it, condensing a phantasmal halberd of light over the physical weapon. This phantom could engage in Splitting Light to defend against an opponent.

The original light-projection ability had also ascended to a new level. After being refined by his divine ability and nourished by spiritual essence, the glaring sunlight from the halberd now concentrated into a single beam, forming the [Luminous Grasp] marvel, which was nurtured within the halberd's core.

It was still a projection, but this marvel was quite different. Each time it was used, it would release a [Luminous Grasp White Light]. This bright light was tangible. If it missed its target, it would not dissipate; instead, it would follow the movements of the weapon.

Much like many Bright Yang Spiritual Artifacts, the number of [Luminous Grasp White Lights] was linked to the owner's divine ability. The more Bright Yang divine abilities he mastered, the more [Luminous Grasp White Lights] he could release at once.

'It really does favor the strong and scorn the weak.'

Li Zhouwei was nonetheless deeply satisfied. In his current situation, just having a suitable weapon was a massive improvement, to say nothing of one with two exceptionally useful marvels.

With a light flick of his finger, the Grand Ascension transformed into a streak of golden light and vanished into his palm. He soared into the air, and in an instant, he arrived at the northern shore.

Snow was drifting down over the banks. The sky above was a chaotic maelstrom of light and clashing colors. Waves of divine ability power rolled out relentlessly—a fierce battle was clearly underway. The falling snow stopped abruptly at the river's edge. On the far side, roiling demonic smoke gathered, encircling a lone figure. Li Zhouwei needed only a single glance to recognize the face.

'Helian Wumeng.'




# Chapter 953: The Baleful Star

White snow drifted through the air as Helian Wumeng unleashed a rampant demonic aura. His signature long-hafted saber struck like lightning, a crimson radiance wreathing his face, displaying an utterly tyrannical power.

But Ning Wan simply stood amidst the falling snow, two fingers pressed to her lips. Twenty-eight small, immaculate white flags hovered in the air, forming a great, suspended furnace that drew in the surging bloodlight and demonic qi, sealing it completely within the formation.

Although Ning Wan had only recently reached the Purple Mansion Realm, she was already renowned throughout Azure Pond as a formation prodigy. She was especially famous for her ingenuity and adaptability in the dao of formations. With her twenty-eight flags, she conjured a new array from thin air, tightly sealing away all her opponent's baleful energy.

Several motes of immaculate snow-light danced around his saber, only to be scattered by its force. Yet, the falling snow from the sky constantly gathered to replenish them.

It wasn't that Helian Wumeng feared her techniques. The Cold Qi Daoist Tradition was not considered powerful, and besides, Ning Wan's cultivation was lower than his. He had already charged across the riverbank three times, pressing her so hard he had nearly shattered her grand formation. But that had only earned him a cold sneer as the woman drew forth the Great Snow's Severing Edge.

Helian Wumeng immediately backed down. He refused to take a single step across the river.

'Great Snow's Severing Edge...'

The reputation of this Spiritual Sword was already immense. In recent years, having been wielded by Lingmei and then Lou Xing, its fame once again resounded through the north. The great Vija, a fifth-life Maha, had been so thoroughly defeated by it that all his honored statues and clay effigies in the northern temples had shattered. Although the Way of Great Desire refused to admit it, claiming he had merely reincarnated, everyone knew he had truly fallen.

'If some hidden power remained within that blade, and I rashly crossed the river, and the formation restrained me for even an instant... one strike from that sword, and I'd be paying my respects to the Helian ancestors.'

But while he held his position, summons kept coming from the tent behind him. He pretended not to hear them. It wasn't until several phantasmal lights faintly appeared on the southern river that he leisurely descended, landing on the bank and entering the grand hall manifested by the dharma artifact in the sky.

The first person he saw upon entering was, of course, his elder, Helian Wujiang, who stood with a grim expression. On the other side was the white-robed demonic cultivator, Xindu, along with that Daoist Master Yehui, Bai Ziyu. One looked perfectly at ease, the other wore a faint smile. As for Murong Yan and Shilou Yingge, those two scoundrels were colluding off to the side, snickering about something with ill intent.

Only Qi Lanyan, who stood in the host's seat, offered him an indifferent nod, which passed for a greeting.

In this hall representing the north, you couldn't find three people who were of one mind. The Viewing Pavilion Daoist Tradition, the Scions of King-Marquis, the demonic dao rogue cultivators, and the Purple Mansion Realm masters from Jiangbei—each harbored their own agenda, scheming against who-knew-who in the shadows.

Helian Wumeng wasn't a good-tempered person to begin with. He moved to stand beside Helian Wujiang, his face cold and silent. Only then did Qi Lanyan smile and speak.

“Fellow Daoists, I must make a trip to the territory of Xuanmiao Temple to support Fellow Daoist Kong. A fight is likely. Which of you are willing to accompany me?”

He seemed to have been waiting just for Helian Wumeng to return, asking the moment he arrived, unwilling to delay another second.

Helian Wujiang's eyes narrowed. For a moment, no one responded. But the silence was quickly broken by a cheerful laugh.

“I await Lord Qi’s arrangements!”

None of the Purple Mansion Realm masters needed to look; they all knew it was the Viewing Pavilion's new recruit, Daoist Master Yehui, Bai Ziyu, who was always so obsequious. The others, however, remained silent, calculating and undecided.

Since arriving in Jiangbei, Qi Lanyan had always been polite, never putting on the airs of the Viewing Pavilion. This matter, however, was far from simple.

'The Supreme Yang may be failing, but they still have cards to play. A direct move on Shanji Prefecture... that will inevitably stir up chaos. Sword Gate is right there, and Purple Smoke and Xiukui are allied more closely than ever. If we cross the bottom line for all three... they might just decide to fight to the bitter end.'

Everyone knew that Shanji Prefecture had been Jiangnan territory for ages. This military advance was tantamount to shoving the north's power right in the faces of Sword Gate and Purple Smoke!

Although they had all been sent here with thoughts of plunder, none of their families were lapdogs for the Viewing Pavilion. Naturally, they were unwilling to be the ones to stick their necks out.

Among them, Murong Yan had the deepest background. Though polite on the surface, he often watched events with a cold, detached gaze. Now, he remained utterly silent, merely nodding with a faint smile.

Qi Lanyan scanned the room, his gaze landing on Helian Wujiang. He smiled.

“Fellow Daoist Helian?”

Despite being put on the spot, Helian Wujiang remained perfectly calm and replied respectfully:

“Years ago, when our state was in turmoil, only the Viewing Pavilion faction came to our aid. The two of us have no way to repay that debt. We await your command!”

“Good!”

Qi Lanyan laughed. The one with the weakest background, the demonic cultivator Daoist Master Xindu, still looked hesitant. Just as he was about to speak, Qi Lanyan cut in.

“In that case, I will go north to invite one more Purple Mansion Realm expert. We should have enough manpower then.”

Daoist Master Xindu wasn't trying to defy him; he was simply afraid of losing his own men. Although he had been present at the Battle of Luoxia, that had been on northern territory. How could it compare to striking deep into the south? Yet, Qi Lanyan easily overlooked his brief hesitation, turning with a smile to Murong Yan.

“I’ll be troubling you all, then!”

Murong Yan smiled and nodded, watching him depart. He then turned to Shilou Yingge beside him and said with a mocking laugh:

“What’s this? Fellow Daoist Shilou is also unwilling to go?”

Shilou Yingge had come south far less for personal gain than to secure his political standing; he desperately wanted to shed the Wei-Li label. Naturally, he was reluctant to take such a risk. Yet, watching Qi Lanyan's exit, he felt a deep unease. Though awkward, he forced a smile.

“I can’t be bothered to run around.”

As the two chatted idly, Qi Lanyan had already left the hall with his men, not looking back. He smiled all the way to Xuanmiao Temple, where Kong Tingyun rushed out, riding the wind, to pay her respects. Qi Lanyan quickly helped her up and spoke with a serious tone.

“Is the [Central Palace Mystic Brocade Pill] working well? My Junior Sister wrote to me just the other day asking about you... She’s planning when to have you enter the temple to receive your cultivation technique.”

Kong Tingyun's expression was noticeably dimmer than in the past. She understood her situation all too well now. She could only force an eager smile and reply:

“Thank you both, my Lords, for your concern... This superior-grade spirit pill... I truly don't know how I can ever repay you.”

Qi Lanyan shook his head, then pointed to Helian Wumeng and Helian Wujiang, introducing them. Kong Tingyun acknowledged them, but pointedly ignored Yehui, who stood with his hands clasped behind his back. Qi Lanyan exchanged a few pleasantries as they descended onto the mountain.

“I also came today to resolve the enmity between you two,” he said, looking between her and Yehui. “You have both achieved divine abilities, after all...”

Yehui maintained his bright smile, betraying no emotion, though his eyes were as deep as a clear pool. Qi Lanyan, however, had no real intention of resolving their conflict. After a few empty words, he made an excuse for Yehui to depart.

Kong Tingyun felt stifled. Qi Lanyan, however, merely sipped his tea. He glanced at Helian Wujiang, who was busy observing his surroundings, and said casually:

“Fellow Daoist Helian... coming to Xuanmiao Temple is a decision you certainly won’t regret.”

At these words, Kong Tingyun’s expression flickered. A chill went through Helian Wujiang’s heart. He looked up to see a mocking smile finally touch Qi Lanyan’s lips.

“Whether Shanji Prefecture can be taken or not... if you follow my Viewing Pavilion... the Helian family will not suffer any losses.”

The sky had grown dim. Xuanmiao Temple adhered to ancient customs and did not light lamps on the mountain, leaving the small courtyard shrouded in the pale purple of twilight. Only the faint multicolored light emanating from the three of them provided any illumination.

Helian Wujiang felt a mix of shock and dread. He first offered his thanks, then probed in a low voice:

“Even a setting sun retains some of its brilliance, my Lord. You must still be careful.”

“Hahaha...”

Qi Lanyan let out a low, chilling laugh.

“When it comes to foresight, none of you compare to Bai Ziyu. Even now, you still see this as a mere Daoist traditions dispute between a few families! Even Kui Qi had figured it out, yet you still don't understand the origin of this entire situation!”

He rose to his feet, turned slowly, and began to recite:

“The Cultivation Transcendence... its nature is that of the Baleful Star. It arises in times of chaos, bringing conflict between states, warfare, great plagues, and the death of ministers. When it flourishes, the hearts of men turn treacherous, law is abused, crime runs rampant, generals face execution, nobles are imprisoned, and clans suffer sudden calamity.”

“Although that figure in the north learned his lesson, do not forget what kind of being He once was! The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition weakened and never recovered. Where did the problem lie?”

Both men were silent. Helian Wujiang stared at him, his eyes burning, the question clear on his lips. Qi Lanyan smiled.

“It lies in the return of Jade True, which proved that the position was empty!”

He turned back, his voice dropping to a low whisper.

“From the moment the Jade True Six-Nine Void returned, it looked like a great victory for the righteous path, a Sword Immortal attaining the Dao. But in reality, the momentum of the Baleful Star was already set. The southern Dao paths all celebrated, ignorant that they had just placed their own necks on the executioner's block, merely awaiting the day of their death!”

...

The north bank.

Li Zhouwei was briefly watching the distant battle when a figure landed beside him. The man wore gray robes, carried a sword on his back, and had a grave expression. He bowed.

“This old man is Chen Yin of Yushui. Greetings, Fellow Daoist.”

“So it is Daoist Master Yushui.”

Li Zhouwei figured several Purple Mansion Realm masters must be in the vicinity, but he didn't know why this one had revealed himself. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he asked a direct question. Only then did the Daoist Master smile.

“Ah, so Fellow Daoist Zhaojing is still in seclusion... I received word from Fellow Daoist Dingyang Zi. I heard your esteemed clan possesses some Neck Feathers, but I don't have any artifact-refining materials on hand, so I came to inquire.”

“I see.”

Li Zhouwei then remembered the man was a Water Mansion cultivator. He must not have been able to make a trade with Dingyang Zi, so he had come seeking him instead. Chen Yin continued with a serious expression:

“Although I lack refining materials, I do have a Upright Wood spiritual object I found in the Southern Sea: [Blameless Spirit Wood]. I would like to trade it for one or two of your feathers.”

He retrieved a jade box from his sleeve. Inside lay a fist-sized, blue-black block of wood. It looked like countless thin layers of wood pressed together, its grain clear and brimming with spiritual energy.

“This Upright Wood is extremely hard. It takes on the properties of metal, yet is not metal, so it cannot be forged into armor. However, it is excellent for crafting small accessories. As for whether it can be used in alchemy... you'll have to ask your clan's great master.”

“It’s quite a large piece!” Li Zhouwei remarked appreciatively.

Chen Yin smiled. “This piece was originally the size of two fists, but I cut a portion off to craft a sword hilt. This is the remainder. It's still a substantial amount, and I wish to trade it for two Neck Feathers.”

The Li family could produce more Neck Feathers in the future, so trading them for different types of spiritual resources was a good way to prepare for future needs. Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement.

Chen Yin was instantly delighted. “Fellow Daoist is truly straightforward!”

He smiled and offered his thanks, then asked with a hopeful expression:

“If I may be so bold... where did your esteemed clan obtain these? And how many do you have left?”

Li Zhouwei shook his head, his expression natural. “I’m afraid that is not convenient to disclose. We have few remaining. My grand-uncle is in seclusion, and I don’t know if he has traded any others away. He might have one or two left. When he emerges, Senior, you may ask him yourself.”

“My apologies, my apologies.”

Chen Yin quickly agreed. Not wanting to overstay his welcome, he soon took his leave. After he had vanished into the Great Void, the white-robed woman descended on the wind, landing steadily in the pavilion. She spoke softly.

“Greetings, Fellow Daoist Minghuang!”

Ning Wan's aura was as gentle as ever, but her brow was heavy with deep sorrow and anxiety. It was as if her heart was burdened by countless things she could not voice.

“Senior, you are too polite.”

Li Zhouwei returned the bow. The two walked toward the center of the island and took their seats in the main hall. A cultivator served them tea. After a moment's thought, Li Zhouwei asked:

“What are the Lord’s arrangements?”

At his question, Ning Wan lowered her head.

“We are to move immediately,” she replied. “The Lord’s orders were to wait for you to emerge from seclusion.”

Apparently, while Li Zhouwei had been in seclusion, several of the Supreme Yang Daoist Traditions in northern Yue State had reached a consensus—or perhaps, had been forced into one: they had to defend Shanji Prefecture.

Li Zhouwei, however, felt calm. He asked a pointed question.

“What are Hengzhu’s arrangements?”

Years ago, Yehui had visited the Li family and alluded to this southern Immortal Dao, even hinting at the Taizhu behind it. He had accused them of sitting on the mountain to watch the tigers fight, remaining hidden and uninvolved.

The information Yehui possessed might not have been entirely accurate, but it wasn't baseless. Hengzhu's actions likely held a deeper, unusual meaning.

In response to his question, Ning Wan shook her head, an unreadable smile playing on her lips.

“You haven’t heard, Fellow Daoist? It’s excellent news. A few days ago... Hengzhu’s Daoist Master Hengli successfully passed the Purple Mystery and attained four divine abilities. It’s such a pity for Senior Tinglan. If she hadn't been injured back then, given the time that’s passed, she would likely be making her own breakthrough by now.”

“Oh? That is indeed joyous news...”

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. Seeing no trace of joy on her face, he voiced his confusion. As he suspected, Ning Wan’s smile vanished. She said flatly:

“However... when our people went to Hengzhu to offer congratulations, they were informed that the Hengzhu Dao is preparing to seal its mountains. Their entire Immortal Dao is focusing on preparations for Hengli’s ascension to the rank of True Monarch.”

Li Zhouwei fell silent, unsure how to respond. Ning Wan's expression was complicated as she continued.

“Senior Tinglan and the others... they discussed it for a while. I don't know what was said. There are some matters that are no longer appropriate for me to hear. But by the same token... there are things I am no longer fit to speak about!”

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei knew it was even more inappropriate for him to comment. He could only lower his head, pretending he hadn’t heard. Ning Wan shook her head and let out a heavy sigh.

“At dawn, I must send word to Tinglan and Houfu. The northern forces are gathered on the bank. We will head north together, cross the river, and make landfall. The Lord will provide support as we move to retake Jiangbei.”

The night receded. A faint golden light rose from the horizon, heralding the dawn. It climbed the walls of the great hall with startling speed, draping itself over Ning Wan.

Her expression was filled with profound unease. Her lips trembled as she whispered:

“So... this is what it feels like to be trapped in a situation beyond one's control.”

Motes of golden light flickered in Li Zhouwei’s own eyes. He extended his hand, and the brilliance of the Grand Ascension gathered, condensing into his great halberd. He watched Ning Wan quietly and sighed.

“Senior. Please proceed.”




# Chapter 954: Whose Scheme

The river surged, its waters churning.

The first light of the Morning Glow crested the horizon, casting the Crimson Flame Tower in a golden sheen. A long-faced man sat within, silent, waiting as Murong Yan ambled up to him. Only then did he speak, his voice low.

"Fellow Daoist Murong... any thoughts?"

Murong Yan settled himself casually. His fleshy face showed no sign of embarrassment; he seemed perfectly at ease.

"He's definitely made arrangements," Murong Yan said softly. "With us posted here by the river, he's planning to make a display of his power for us to see."

He seemed to regard Shilou Yingge as one of his own. Shielded by a divine ability, he spoke with blunt familiarity, chuckling as he continued: "Bai Ziyu is a clever man. He knows his best opportunity hinges on Qi Lanyan. As for that Helian uncle and nephew, they just fear his Viewing Pavilion Platform. And look at Touba Ci—he refuses to lift a finger. People from the Zhao Palace are on their way down. If he doesn't make a show of force... how will he command anyone?"

Shilou Yingge smiled. "If that's the case... what kind of display do you think he'll make? Hengli and Hengxing... they wouldn't come themselves, would they?"

Murong Yan stroked his beard and laughed. "How could that be possible!"

Seeing his expression, Shilou Yingge merely let out a long sigh. "True. In the end, the noble lord's methods are truly impressive. Just one 'southward reincarnation' and the matter was settled. He went through the True Monarch's connections, leaving the entire Supreme Yang Daoist tradition speechless and letting them tear themselves apart."

"Our methods?"

Murong Yan laughed sarcastically, as if privy to a deeper story. "My family didn't dare speak of it before, afraid of disrupting things. But now, the situation is becoming clear and is irreversible. I suppose there's no harm in discussing it with you."

"You say it was our methods? Then let me ask you: in all these years of the Supreme Yang's decline, what has Hengzhu actually lost? Back when all the Purple Mansion Realm experts were locked in a stalemate, a direct-line descendant of the Hengzhu just happened to run off for no reason... Does my family truly have that kind of power? Don't just believe the rumors that the Murong family's schemes caused the internal discord within the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition."

He leaned in. "Who truly desired that discord... is far from certain."

At this, Shilou Yingge's pupils widened. He had clearly made an unsettling connection. He was speechless for a long moment before finally offering a weak defense: "Fellow Daoist, you must be mistaken. Hengli and Hengxing... they wouldn't be people like that."

Murong Yan laughed loudly. "Of course, of course. The one above Hengzhu remains in the shadows. This business can be blamed on anyone."

This was deeply irreverent, hinting at someone at the very highest level. Shilou Yingge couldn't follow that line of thought and a chill crept into his heart.

'If that's true... then either the one above Hengzhu made these arrangements even earlier—saw some sign that the Jade True adept was close to achieving the Dao, foresaw the coming trouble, and prepared well in advance...'

'Or... the world is on the brink of upheaval, and after the Hengzhu leader lay low for so many years, someone above didn't want the Hengzhu Immortal Dao to get too entangled and create new complications. So, they intentionally engineered this separation...'

'Which explains why, after all these years, Hengzhu has remained almost completely unscathed. Their only real "loss" was a single direct-line descendant who couldn't even reach the Purple Mansion Realm. A sacrifice of one to pacify the whole region...'

His pupils trembled.

'Hengli probably doesn't know. But Hengxing... she was willing to come to the Battle of Luoxia. Did she sense something? Does she have her own plans... secretly cooperating, but afraid to get dragged in too deep?'

Neither man wanted to pursue the topic. They pulled the conversation back to the present. Murong Yan lowered his voice.

"Could it be Chi Buzi?"

At the mention of this name, Shilou Yingge fell silent for a moment. "I've heard of him. The number one genius of the Azure Pond. He's a Great Daoist Master now. His cultivation speed is terrifyingly fast. Especially the Purple Mystery immortal threshold—they say he crossed it as if it were nothing, perhaps even more easily than Wei Xuanyin back in the day."

Murong Yan's expression darkened slightly. "It's not impossible. Chi Buzi usually just looks out for himself, but if there's enough profit involved, he might just come back to stick his hand in... Still... how capable is he, really?"

The Imperial Scion of Yan smiled. "There's you, me, and Xindu. That's three of us. Taixi is close by on the bank. That's three Bodhisattva seats and one Lotus seat. Even if the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple refuses to send anyone and Touba Ci won't move, how many people would it possibly take to overwhelm us?"

But Shilou Yingge frowned, his gaze slowly turning south.

"They're here."

Murong Yan looked up as well. He saw white snow drifting over the morning riverbank. But unlike before, it didn't stop at the shore; it rode biting gusts of wind, surging across the river's surface toward them.

Ning Wan stood amidst the fierce gales, holding a Spiritual Sword, face impassive. A figure materialized behind her, wreathed in surging white water: the sword cultivator, Daoist Master Yushui Chen Yin.

But Murong Yan's gaze quickly skipped past those two, landing on the golden-eyed man beside them.

'Li Zhouwei...'

Fwoosh!

The True Fire overhead rapidly retracted. The long arched bridge, the True Fire armor—all of it dissolved back into flame and flowed into Shilou Yingge's palm, vanishing as if it were an illusion.

His golden robes fluttering, the man stood in the air beside Murong Yan and addressed the newcomers, his tone level.

"Fellow Daoist Ning... what is the meaning of this?"

Ning Wan didn't waste time with words. Twenty-eight white banners flew up and unfurled in the sky. A flurry of white light, like countless small swords falling from the heavens, rained down, blanketing the area.

In an instant, battle cries shook the sky as cultivators, monks, and demonic cultivators on both sides clashed. Murong Yan just let out a dry laugh, a thick killing intent rising in his eyes.

"Good!"

The world immediately dimmed. All colors faded into shadow, and even the bright, pure snow seemed to turn a deathly pale.

Sunless Deceit!

The divine ability surged forward like a tide. Chen Yin's figure vanished. His own divine ability roamed free—two 'waters' colliding. But his white Water Mansion divine ability was only enough to envelop himself, holding firm like an immovable reef in the dark tide.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes watched calmly. A brilliance had already gathered between his brows, coalescing into a shimmering light. He had long known the effects of Murong Yan's Sunless Deceit and was prepared. Standing quietly behind Chen Yin's Water Mansion divine ability, he easily stabilized his own power.

Rumble!

The Valley Water divine ability spread rapidly, staining the entire sky as if with ink. Several active divine abilities froze, but a single point of blazing brilliance burst free from the darkness.

Shilou Yingge's golden robes whipped about him, his eyes now a pure, blazing crimson. The clouds across the sky were rapidly retreating from him, revealing a scorching, boundless sea of fire.

"The Gao family's True Fire Art!"

With those two striking simultaneously, the sky was instantly split in two. The division was absolute: below, a lightless gloom; above, a raging inferno of True Fire. All the falling snow evaporated into nothingness. Only Ning Wan's twenty-eight white formation flags remained, struggling to hold their ground within the flames.

Clang!

At that critical moment, a white jade Spiritual Sword emerged from the Great Void. It was as cold as Qiushui, as fast as lightning, and it pointed directly at Shilou Yingge!

'Zhusheng...'

This Jade True sword cultivator from the Southern Borderlands had always been an ally of the Azure Pond. It was the first time Li Zhouwei had seen him. His heart stirred as he recalled the bitter expression he had once seen on Ning Wan's face.

'He's actually willing to get involved! Can it be... he doesn't know Suiguan is the one pulling the strings?'

He didn't let himself be distracted. The thought passed in an instant as the light between his brows erupted, shooting not toward Murong Yan, but at the empty space directly in front of Chen Yin.

Rumble!

A Bright Yang multicolored light flared, carving out a sanctuary of light in the world shrouded by Sunless Deceit. At the exact point where the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light struck, a man in a white robe and grey cloak slowly materialized, his expression awkward.

It was the demonic cultivator, Xindu!

He had intended to catch them off guard, but his stealth had been seen through. Now, as the brilliant Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light descended, he was the one caught flat-footed. He could only grasp the corner of his robe and channel his divine ability to resist the light.

But the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was fleeting, gone in a flash. It forced a cough from Xindu, and in that instant, Chen Yin surged forward. Li Zhouwei shot into the air, his long arm extending as his halberd swept across in a streak of light. The long haft glittered within the glowing stream as it slammed heavily into an oncoming black shadow, erupting in a shower of sparks.

The divine abilities in the sky momentarily froze. The overly vast Sunless Deceit was finally broken by the combined divine abilities of several Purple Mansion Realm experts. The distant Morning Glow broke through, illuminating the gleaming golden halberd. It had parried a Spiritual Artifact—something between a staff and a mace—that had emerged from the demonic mist.

The halberd glittered with motes of light, bright as the rising sun. The Luminous Grasp technique activated, and a fist-sized, white-hot comet of light leaped from it, trailing flames as it circled the halberd's shaft.

Li Zhouwei's eyes were once again reflected in Murong Yan's pupils. Now wielding his weapon, the chosen of the Li family finally showed a hint of a smile.

"Fellow Daoist Murong... Today, we can finally have a proper fight!"

Seeing that Li Zhouwei had intercepted him, the killing intent in Murong Yan's eyes slowly faded. He looked away from Chen Yin, his expression turning into one of eager anticipation. He grinned.

"Good!"

The word had barely fallen when Murong Yan's figure vanished. In his place hovered a man-high, brilliant white halo, encircled by sixteen scales.

Murong Yan himself reappeared thirty feet to the side. He formed a seal with two fingers, sending out two golden beams that intertwined into a ring of Dharma light. Instantly, an identical ring of light shot out from the halo, hurtling toward him.

Li Zhouwei raised his halberd, twisting his body, but then reversed his grip on the Grand Ascension, holding the long haft against his arm behind his back. He calmly used his free hand to untie the golden halberd hanging at his waist.

'The Radiant Sun King's Halberd!'

Murong Yan had been watching him closely. A complex look—a mix of dread and resignation—flashed across his face. His mind briefly blanked.

'The Radiant Sun King's Halberd of Li Shu and his son, Li Guangfu... That weapon is famous for its sheer, crushing weight. Why is he taking it out now?'

He saw Li Zhouwei turn his palm upward. The long halberd, a symbol of nobility and authority, floated gently in his hand. Soft, gentle brilliance pulsed from it, illuminating the surroundings.

Radiance!

A pale white brilliance shone out, instantly covering the entire battlefield. Whether it was Zhusheng and Chen Yin fighting with their swords, or Ning Wan controlling the grand formation, they all felt the pale light settle over them like a mantle, shielding them from the encroaching True Fire and Valley Water.

In his previous duels, Li Zhouwei had fought alone, so he had no need for this art. Now, with multiple Purple Mansion Realm experts in combat, he naturally brought it out to support his allies.

Whoosh...

But in that same instant, the two rings of Dharma light—pale blue on the outside, like golden rings within—were upon him. Li Zhouwei remained unhurried. He simply parted his lips.

Hsssss...

A surging torrent of purple fire erupted from his mouth, sweeping outward. This purple fire was unusually potent; it violently slammed into the two rings of Dharma light and blasted them aside.

This was the Flame-Spitting ability of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd!

In that same instant, Li Zhouwei was wreathed in the Radiant Celestial Wave Art. The bright light of the Sun's Resonant Parting Art climbed his arm. With a flick of his halberd, he tossed the two spell arts behind him and charged Murong Yan!

He had recognized earlier that the sixteen scales in the halo were the Dharma scales of an Azure-Necked Flood Dragon. That meant the light had to be a bewildering light of Converging Water. It would be difficult to dispel directly. The best method was to force the caster's hand—to attack a vital point, forcing Murong Yan to abandon the Dharma Art to defend himself!

Murong Yan immediately raised his River-Wall Staff to parry. He raised an eyebrow as the light of his Sunless Deceit divine ability stopped expanding, instead contracting to a thirty-foot radius around him, locking out all radiance.

Clang!

The clash of Spiritual Artifacts was as loud as thunder. Murong Yan had indeed been forced to abandon his Dharma Art. He faltered for a fraction of a second. The Grand Ascension flared with light, and another Luminous Grasp White Light leaped out. Now two points of white light circled the halberd, fending off the dark radiance of the Sunless Deceit divine ability.

But in the exact instant Murong Yan blocked the Grand Ascension, a hazy golden light rose from the Grand Ascension Halberd. The physical halberd was still locked against the River-Wall Staff, but a golden shadow-clone of the halberd swung out in a graceful arc, stabbing at his neck!

It was the marvelous clone ability of the Grand Ascension's Attachment!

'He's using this shadow-clone to force my Valley Visage to manifest!'

A flash of shock crossed Murong Yan's eyes. He understood his opponent's intent, but he had no choice. He was forced to tilt his head up, revealing the face of a beautiful, pale-skinned woman with disheveled hair. With a sharp clang, that face bit down on the golden shadow.

'Just as I thought! When his Valley Visage manifests, his main body is temporarily powerless!'

The Attachment clone shattered, but Li Zhouwei's physical weapon was no longer pinned as it had been in their first fight. Flashing with brilliant golden light, it flipped over, swept aside the now dharma power-dimmed River-Wall Staff, and advanced again, smashing the woman's head to pieces.

"Impressive!"

Amidst the spreading black mist, a large, jade-white hand once again grasped the hilt of the River-Wall Staff. The fleshy outer skin-bag that Murong Yan wore was finally cast aside completely. An imposing man stood in the air, his glowing arm looking like pure white jade within the surging purple flames.

The River-Wall Staff expanded infinitely in the air, condensing into a massive, black demonic blade that chopped down from the sky.

BOOM!

The sound of metal striking metal echoed. A dazzling Bright Yang brilliance shot skyward, while roiling gray light from the Valley Water flowed like a river. The massive, mountain-sized demonic blade froze in mid-air, casting an enormous shadow on the ground below.

A single golden point—a halberd that looked as small as a twig in comparison—was braced against the demonic blade, holding it fast. Li Zhouwei had been driven down over a thousand feet, almost plunging into the river. His hands were white from the force of his grip. The river surface beneath his feet, pressed down by the immense divine ability, had caved in, parting the churning water to reveal a vast, dry hole.

RUMBLE!

Brilliant sparks and purple flames erupted at the point of impact. The sky was once again split along that boundary—one half shining with golden light, the other surging with gray.

The cultivators battling on the river's surface were scared out of their wits, scrambling and tumbling over each other to get away. Their retreat tore a stark, empty rift in the chaotic battlefield.

This grand visage, born from the clash of powerful divine abilities, lasted only for an instant. The divine abilities of the various Daoist Masters once again filled the sky. The True Fire and the Jade True light flared anew, red and white interweaving. The light illuminated Li Zhouwei's face. His gaze was sharp and bright as he stared quietly at Murong Yan.

Thrum...

Phoenix cries, dragon roars, the snap of flags and banners—a deep, resonant sound began to boil within the clouds. That same pure white gatehouse descended from the sky once more, a repeat of their first clash. Murong Yan stared into his opponent's smiling eyes and finally sensed that something was wrong.

The target of the Audience with the Celestial Gate wasn't him. It was...

The River-Wall Staff!




# Chapter 955: Counter

Intense light flared and churned across the sky. Murong Yan's expression twisted as the black qi in his hand recoiled at an astonishing speed. A flicker of hesitation crossed his eyes.

Even as the crisis suddenly shifted to the Spiritual Artifact in his hand, a counter-plan instantly formed in his mind:

'The best move is to step forward... enter the gate bodily, then find a chance to escape using a divine ability!'

But the instant that thought arose, the image of Li Zhouwei's smile magnified in his pupils, igniting suspicion.

'If this were a duel, I'd risk entering. But things are different now. In a chaotic battle, everything can change in a flash. If Chi Buzi is lurking, or if Great Snow's Severing Edge finds an opening to kill me... wouldn't I be walking into a trap?'

That suspicion made him hesitate for a fatal instant. But Li Zhouwei had been waiting for this very moment. His Audience with the Celestial Gate divine ability was perfected and blindingly fast. After such a delay, how could Murong Yan possibly escape? He had lost even the chance to enter the gate bodily!

"BOOM!"

An inferno of radiance erupted. Beneath a sky churning with clashing divine abilities, a gleaming celestial gate materialized. A brilliant white light, like a rising sun, shone from within its frame, so intense that cultivators on both shores had to lower their heads, daring not to look at it directly.

Beneath the gate, a single point of grey light still trembled—his Spiritual Artifact. It was like a demon trapped and suppressed, struggling defiantly. It would occasionally force the massive gate to lift a fraction, but it could no longer break free.

Murong Yan now stood far in the distance, his face grim. His once-strong arm was empty.

'Audience with the Celestial Gate...'

Murong Yan knew how powerful this technique was, of course. But as a wielder of the Valley Water divine ability, he feared suppression and grinding least of all, which had led to a natural arrogance. Now, vaguely sensing the immense pressure crushing down on his Spiritual Artifact, his expression finally shifted.

Simultaneously, waves of white light poured from the celestial gate like a tide, dispelling the abyssal gloom of his Sunless Deceit. The gate's light carved out its own domain within the pervasive aura of Valley Water.

Li Zhouwei stood atop the gate itself, feeling the faint vibrations from the struggling artifact beneath his feet. He impassively channeled more power into the suppression, his long halberd gleaming as he pointed it at Murong Yan from across the sky.

'I completely misjudged how tyrannical this Audience with the Celestial Gate is! Even if I had entered, I wouldn't be able to escape easily without using my Valley Water divine ability... let alone a mere Spiritual Artifact!'

Furious and alarmed at losing his favored weapon through a moment of carelessness, Murong Yan's face darkened. Billowing demonic qi coiled from his body, slowly coalescing into a vast, dark disc behind him.

Streaks of black light dissolved into roiling clouds, swirling around him like a colossal, hundred-tailed scorpion displaying thousands of venomous barbs while keeping its true body hidden.

'Illusory Annihilation Cloud of Valley Water!'

A golden light flared in Li Zhouwei's eyes. The Radiant Celestial Wave Art gathered around him once more, forming silken threads of light that surged forward to meet the attack.

Unfortunately, the Radiant Celestial Wave Art was not a high-grade art to begin with, and Li Zhouwei had learned it hastily. It was no match for the dense demonic qi. Though the silken threads of light pressed forward, the black qi forced them back, inch by agonizing inch.

"BOOM!"

The space between Li Zhouwei's brows pulsed with light. Spanning the sky, a beam of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light flashed and vanished like a brilliant firework, yet it struck with perfect accuracy, hitting Murong Yan's true body concealed within the heavy demonic fog.

The billowing black qi instantly faltered. But it was far from over. No matter how Murong Yan tried to hide within the mists, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light repeatedly flashed, striking his true body with unerring precision and stifling the Dharma Art he was trying to cast.

For a moment, the sky was filled with constant flashes of white light, illuminating the dark clouds in a strobing rhythm.

"BANG! BANG! BANG..."

The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light wasn't fast enough to consistently track Murong Yan as he weaved through the dark clouds, avoiding a direct confrontation. But it didn't need to. It struck just often enough to interrupt his spell arts, completely stalling his assault.

After some time, the assault finally withered. The roiling black clouds around Murong Yan dispersed, revealing his ugly expression. He held two fingers together before him, his other hand raised. He had been forced to abandon his 'Illusory Annihilation Cloud of Valley Water' just to find an opening to summon a single ray of Valley Water demonic light.

The light was dark and heavy, like thick gauze. It moved like a fish through the lingering gloom of his Sunless Deceit, but it kept its distance, circling sinisterly. As Li Zhouwei's weapon struck, Murong Yan did not evade. Instead, he surged forward, a vicious, dark light flashing in his eyes.

"BOOM!"

A storm of golden light exploded in the sky. He had actually caught the long halberd between his bare hands. Boiling vapor and bright light erupted from the point of contact as his own demonic qi was consumed at a terrifying rate.

Colors swirled in his eyes. His mouth suddenly swelled, ripping wide open from ear to ear. A swirling, purple-black vortex formed within, swallowing all the golden light before him. At the same time, tendrils of purple-black demonic qi wrapped around the Grand Ascension, smothering its power.

The golden halberd trembled, its blade wavering. Li Zhouwei spun and leaped, vaulting through the oncoming purple-black qi. He planted a boot squarely on the shaft of his own Grand Ascension, causing the long pole to bend under the force. A brilliant light began to brew between his brows.

That single step channeled an immense amount of divine ability and dharma power. Dense golden cracks instantly spiderwebbed across Murong Yan's hands. Two of his fingers were shorn clean off and sent flying, making his pupils shrink and then widen in shock.

But the power of the Grand Ascension was far from spent. Today, Li Zhouwei was not the one left unarmed. As expected, the divine ability of Attachment flared to life once more, shining brilliantly.

Although Murong Yan still held the physical weapon locked, Li Zhouwei's heavy step caused the golden phantom-blade of Attachment to spring forth. It shot past Murong Yan's grip and plunged straight into his throat, nearly piercing clean through his neck.

The massive, expanding purple-black vortex flickered. Only Murong Yan's profound Dao-Profundity allowed him to forcibly maintain the Dharma Art. But just as he did, the brilliant beam of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light arrived right on cue.

"Psh..."

A blinding golden light flashed, and scorching heat washed over him. Murong Yan's pupils reflected the golden glare as his spiritual sense swept frantically. He was horrified to see Li Zhouwei's hand already reaching for the Radiant Sun King's Halberd at his waist!

'Not good!'

He reacted instantly. The purple-black vortex in his mouth stagnated and contracted as he tried to pull back. But the beam of Li Zhouwei's Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light faded even faster!

The man had only feinted, brushing his hand past the Radiant Sun King's Halberd with no intention of drawing it. Instead, he lifted his boot, converting his step into a vicious kick that slammed into the halberd's long shaft.

"BANG!"

Murong Yan had just retracted his spell art, releasing his grip on the Grand Ascension. The kick sent the halberd, now blazing with intense Bright Yang radiance, bursting free. It tore from his grasp—slicing off several more fingers—and plunged deep into his chest.

"Pfft!"

The golden light of Attachment flared on the halberd, only to unexpectedly sputter and die. Li Zhouwei's eyes sharpened. His hands were already clasped before his chest, precariously trapping a small, fish-like wisp of black Valley Water demonic light.

"Greeaa..."

The demonic light ground slowly forward within his grip, emitting a sound that set the teeth on edge as dense demonic qi sprayed into his face. Murong Yan seized the opening to cough up a gout of blood, his expression filled with regret.

His spell art had been seen through, so he had immediately switched tactics. Grabbing the weapon, pressing forward—it was all for this one counter-attack. He never imagined his opponent's barrage would be so relentless, forcing him to unleash his Dharma Art prematurely.

"BOOM!"

An intense light exploded from Li Zhouwei's hands. Tendrils of demonic qi, sharp as blades, pierced the radiance. In that brief, violent impact, both figures vanished.

"Pfft."

Murong Yan reappeared. A golden light flashed from the gaping wound in his torso, deep enough to reveal his organs. Both his hands were now fingerless, reduced to bloody palms and splintered stumps of bone.

His face showed no trace of pain. He silently flicked his ruined hands. Bone regrew, flesh and skin knitted back together—in a mere moment, they were fully restored. The wound in his torso also sealed over, concealing the golden light within.

When it came to regeneration, as a Valley Water demonic cultivator, only cultivators of Horn Wood could compete. But Horn Wood specialized in healing others, while Valley Water excelled at self-healing. At an equal level of divine ability, they were still a step behind him in this regard.

Yet there wasn't a trace of pride in his eyes, only a flicker of uneasy hesitation.

'He chose to strike my chest... not pierce my Sea of Qi...'

In that moment of hesitation, Li Zhouwei flicked the demonic qi from his own palm. A misty white energy enveloped his hand, slowly healing the injury. The Grand Ascension hovered silently beside him, circled by four rings of white light.

As they faced each other, both seemed to detect something amiss in the other's eyes, an unspoken suggestion. Just then, brilliant rays of light descended. A Maha with a horse-like face and a black serpent coiled around his body appeared from thin air, flanked by several other golden-bodied figures.

Taixi had arrived.

Ning Wan, who was silently controlling her formation and resisting Shilou Yingge alongside Zhusheng, was already struggling under the latter's True Fire. When she saw the brilliant lights tearing through the snow, her expression paled.

"Fellow Daoists, what brings you to the north?"

The Maha's booming laugh echoed from the sky, drawing shouts from the cultivators below. Unfortunately, Mahas were generally despised, and Taixi was a prime example. Murong Yan visibly frowned. Shilou Yingge, who was already fighting with ease, merely shot the newcomer a cold glare.

The expressions of the southern cultivators, however, shifted. Li Zhouwei quickly assessed the new development and frowned inwardly.

'This is too soon...'

Taixi's gaze swept across the faces of the northern contingent, and he cursed internally.

'What a mess of people!'

Taixi was a Maha of the Way of Emptiness, and the Gao family had always hated him. And Shilou Yingge... although he advocated restoring compound surnames, the clan feud between them was all too real. He certainly wouldn't want Taixi's help. The Murong family, on the other hand, should have been an ally. After all, Murong had helped promote his own faction's Maha Liangli, and even Zhelu, the number one expert of the Way of Emptiness. They should be close. But Taixi knew his own business. Zhelu was absolutely unwilling to be a puppet for Murong and the Way of Great Desire, and had been making his own moves recently. Taixi's own standing was what mattered; he really didn't dare get too close. Besides, Taixi clearly recognized the White Qilin. Though he coveted it greedily, he was afraid to make a move. Great Snow's Severing Edge was also terrifyingly strong. He had already scanned the battlefield. In the end... that Water Mansion sword cultivator looked like the easiest target.

And so, with a loud laugh, he rode his cloud downward.

Chen Yin's cultivation was a notch below Xindu's. He had only lasted this long because he'd spent a lifetime of savings on the newly forged Spiritual Sword in his hand, and because his opponent hadn't been willing to risk injury. But one glance at the descending Maha sent his heart plummeting.

'Why are they coming for me?!'

The four Merciful Ones in the sky exchanged glances, each calculating. After a brief hesitation, they all followed Taixi, riding the wind down.

Chen Yin broke out in a cold sweat, sensing imminent doom.

'This is the force they're sending me to block?!'

He didn't hesitate for a second. He recalled his sword and retreated, empowering himself with his Water Mansion divine ability. But Xindu, seeing the reinforcements, had no intention of letting him escape. His eyes fixed on the man's Spiritual Sword, and greed flared in his heart.

'No wonder they say Jiangnan is wealthy. Even a sword cultivator with no apparent backing has his own Spiritual Sword! If I can get my hands on that, I wonder how much I could trade it for?'

Empowering himself with his divine ability, Xindu shot forward, tangling with Chen Yin. The Merciful Ones immediately moved to encircle them, preparing to form a trapping array.

Only Taixi hung back, a smile on his face. He didn't dare advance, watching furtively while keeping a constant, wary eye on Ning Wan's position.

There was no other reason. He was simply terrified of Great Snow's Severing Edge.

'I also have to watch out for the Sword Intent sealed in that Spiritual Artifact. Compared to the northerners, these people from the south probably hate me even more... It's better to let the Immortal cultivators fight amongst themselves. Just as it's been for a thousand years, let them wear each other down...'

Chen Yin barely had time to raise his hand. His Spiritual Sword thrust upward, unleashing a wave of chilling white light. The effort to just neutralize their combined assault made his face drain of color, and he nearly vomited blood.

The awkwardness of his predicament didn't end there. A hasty slash from his sword tore through the white-robed demonic cultivator before him, cleaving the man's dharma body in two. But the demonic cultivator's expression never changed; his body simply dispersed and reformed, pouncing once more.

Chen Yin understood perfectly. Why had Xindu and Taixi both singled him out? Because he had no trump cards. He was an easy target. And his new Spiritual Sword naturally drew their greed. But they had no idea of the difficult position he was in.

Unlike Li Ximing, he, Chen Yin, had achieved his divine ability back when the Supreme Yang was dominant. He didn't have a privileged position like Xiao Chuting. He had long been bound to the Immortal Clan through the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Although that pressure had eased in recent years... the shackles on him were still far heavier than those on Li Ximing.

'I had no choice but to get involved... After all, the materials for this sword were a favor from someone else... How could I refuse? But if my life is on the line, who would be willing to die guarding the Supreme Yang's interests!'

A savage light filled his eyes. He cast aside all other concerns, turned his Spiritual Sword vertical, and lifted it with all his strength.

'Hundred-Light Fractal Sword Art!'

The deep blue Spiritual Sword in his hand instantly split into eight copies. As he raised his fingers, the phantom swords formed a great arc around him, all emitting a brilliant white sword-light. The light reflected brightly in the old man's eyes.

"Kill!"

This was a life-or-death crisis. Chen Yin held nothing back, clearly putting his life on the line. The light from the eight Spiritual Swords intensified, flaring out in shafts as wide as doors, shielding him. A torrent of Water Mansion energy surged around him, extinguishing all the incoming spell arts.

Chen Yin truly had skill. The Water Mansion Dao Lineage was also quite unique. As he unleashed his full power, the divine abilities beneath his attackers' feet were extinguished. An irresistible pull rose from the Water Mansion torrent below, dragging them involuntarily downward.

But just as the eight Spiritual Swords flared, something shot out from the Great Void.

It was a purple alms bowl, banded with two black rings. The mouth of the bowl was a dark void, but the purple body glowed with extreme brightness, instantly suppressing the raging Water Mansion torrent below!

The Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl!

Taixi's Treasured Artifact had been refined specifically to control water and fire. It instantly seized control of the Water Mansion divine ability. The other cultivators reacted, channeling their own divine abilities to break free from the pull.

"What a fine divine ability!"

The first to break free was, naturally, Xindu. That demonic cultivator prioritized his own skin above all else. The boots on his feet were actually a spirit embryo; they flared with light, allowing him to break free of the suppression instantly. He formed a hand seal, overjoyed.

'Coming south was the right choice! Such good treasures to be had!'

His power was already high, and now he saw a chance to seize the Spiritual Artifact. He held nothing back. His eyes turned crimson, and two motes of pale golden light shot from his pupils, flying like venomous wasps.

Chen Yin pushed his divine ability to its limit. Gritting his teeth, he ignored the incoming attacks and tried to step into the Great Void. But the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl was already waiting there, hanging high as a splendid purple light shot directly at him.

"Pfft!"

The situation had turned dire. A flicker of hesitation crossed Chen Yin's eyes. As desperate as he was, he had to blunt this attack first. His Spiritual Sword snapped back to parry, just as he heard Xindu laugh.

"Hand over the Spiritual Sword, and I won't harm you!"

How could Chen Yin possibly agree? He had spent half his life's worth of spiritual materials to forge this sword, not to mention countless fortunate opportunities and ancestral treasures. The entire Chen Clan's wealth wouldn't be enough to cover its cost!

Besides, though his opponent was laughing, his divine abilities rained down all at once. The golden artifacts of the surrounding Merciful Ones followed, striking Chen Yin until he spat blood again. His eyes reddened as he grit his teeth.

'The more dangerous the situation, the calmer I must be. I have to find an opening to escape, or I'll just be forced to continue this fight in the Great Void!'

But just as he was being overwhelmed, he heard a sound from the Great Void. A halberd swept across the sky, trailing purple fire and unleashing a riot of divine abilities!

"BOOM!"

A potent white divine ability exploded against the halberd. Its crescent blade snagged several of the golden artifacts at once. The pressure on Chen Yin vanished. He stared in astonishment at the person who had appeared before him, but his hands didn't slow. He tore open the Great Void again, only for that splendid purple light to shine in his eyes once more.

This time, however, he wasn't being pincered. Someone was holding back his pursuers; he didn't need to fear them. If he could just endure this purple light and accept a minor injury, he could escape!

But Chen Yin hesitated. The light of his Spiritual Sword dimmed, then flared again. In the end, he didn't take the step to escape. Instead, he thrust his sword out with lightning speed, blocking a divine ability aimed at Li Zhouwei's flank with a sharp 'clang.'

Chen Yin's action took Li Zhouwei by surprise for a moment, drawing a faint smile. Without hesitation, Li Zhouwei put his strength into his arms, reversed the halberd, and tore it free with a clang. He spun the weapon and leveled its point, his eyes locking onto Xindu.

The demonic cultivator (Xindu) was clearly furious, though whether at Murong Yan or Li Zhouwei was unclear. But his surging anger and greed were quickly tempered by a cold calculation of strength. If there was no profit to be made, why was he even in this fight?

'Where is Murong Yan? He couldn't even keep Li Zhouwei busy!'

He had barely finished the thought when the aura of Murong Yan's Sunless Deceit swept over from afar. He had already joined the battle in the sky, moving to suppress Zhusheng and Ning Wan!

Xindu glared sullenly at the pair. But as Li Zhouwei turned his halberd, a golden ring burst from the Great Void and clamped down on it. It was Taixi's new Treasured Artifact.

The golden ring was imposing, resizing in mid-air. It clamped onto the Grand Ascension's crescent blade with a clang, then immediately tightened, shaking violently. Li Zhouwei held the halberd in one hand, but the weapon was clearly suppressed by the ring, and he couldn't free it.

'Good!'

Xindu was overjoyed and lunged at Chen Yin once more.

"BOOM!"

Flames flickered high in the sky. The magical snow that had enveloped the area finally dissipated, revealing a white formation flag fluttering weakly in the air.

'Ning Wan and Zhusheng are failing... The northerners want to wipe us all out, or at least suppress everyone long enough to loot some treasures.'

Li Zhouwei's expression hardened. He planted his halberd beside him. The golden ring held fast, suppressing its divine abilities. His eyes turned cold and sharp, sweeping from Taixi—who was silently slipping into the Great Void—to the nearby Xindu. A deep rumbling began to echo from the clouds above.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

The moment the divine ability's power began to manifest, the already-cautious Merciful Ones paled in fright. Even Taixi shot a wary glance, his eyes falling on the Radiant Sun King's Halberd at Li Zhouwei's waist.

Li Zhouwei was a figure of great renown, after all. Who among them, especially the Buddhist cultivators, hadn't studied him? They instantly scattered. Xindu, seeing that he was the target _again_, looked furious and began to laugh out of sheer anger.

'What in the world does this have to do with you? I've never heard of your Li family being close to the Chen Clan. You even let Murong Yan's Spiritual Artifact go, but you insist on ruining my prize!'

Taixi's artifact was still tangled with his halberd in the Great Void, so this Audience with the Celestial Gate was clearly just meant to force him back. Xindu retreated, furious and unwilling, and turned his head back.

Only then did he realize Li Zhouwei wasn't using the art at all—he had used the threat to break from the encirclement and was charging right at him!

Xindu finally understood. He was being targeted because he had no powerful backing. Even knowing Li Zhouwei's illustrious bloodline, being singled out like this time and again made him laugh in fury.

"You think this Daoist Master is so easy to bully!"

His eyes blazed. A white mist covered his face as he played his trump card. Seeing the Audience with the Celestial Gate 'miss,' he lunged forward, sneering.

'Your Spiritual Artifact is bound, your divine ability missed. Let's see how you handle my divine ability!'

But Li Zhouwei seemed utterly unconcerned that his weapon was entangled. He stood coldly before Xindu, and with a flick of his sleeve, unfurled a scroll painting.

'What kind of Spiritual Artifact is that?!'

Xindu's heart trembled, but he blasted his white light forward with all his strength. He was shocked to find the scroll seemed perfectly ordinary. It had a faint aura of Pristine Water, but no dharma power whatsoever. It was just a painting of a person.

The man in the painting was unfamiliar, with green robes and green hair, and a distinctly evil appearance. Some kind of demon...

Believing it to be some defensive Spiritual Artifact, he didn't hold his divine ability back at all. The white light blasted the scroll to smithereens and slammed squarely into Li Zhouwei, sending him flying back a dozen yards, coughing up blood.

'That's it?'

Xindu froze, his first instinct to scoff. But a cloud of doubt instantly enveloped him. His gaze darted across the battlefield and met Murong Yan's distant expression—who looked like he had just seen a ghost and was about to burst into tears.

But that look lasted only an instant. Murong Yan, the raging True Fire, Shilou Yingge, the fluttering snow... all of it was gone. They were all fleeing into the distance.

'Hm? Why are they... flying manually?'

The hair on his body stood on end. His spiritual sense flickered, and a horrifying, delayed realization sent a chill from the crown of his head straight down his spine.

He couldn't connect to the Great Void.

The Merciful Ones below were still oblivious, their jeering laughter echoing in the sudden silence, grating on his nerves. He spun around with lightning speed, but his movement froze.

His pupils dilated to their absolute limit, reflecting a pair of blue-purple, serpentine eyes. They seemed to be sneering.

# Chapter 956: Revealed

'You!'

'The Great Void is severed!' Xindu's heart filled with despair. He spun around. Someone was standing right behind him, an icy presence at his back. Yet when his spiritual sense swept the area, there was no one there!

'It's over!'

Xindu hailed from Mobei, originally a tribesman who had relied on a few strokes of luck to cultivate to this day. He had some skill, and truth be told, his relationship with the Zhao Court was rather close. The most formidable figure he had ever met was Maha.

It wasn't until he followed orders to head south, arrived in Luoxia, and met Wei Xuanyin that he finally laid eyes on an immortal cultivator at the level of a Great Daoist Master. Moreover, this person was from the Viewing Pavilion faction, which had shaken him to the core.

But now, the azure-robed man before him stood silently in the air, his blue-violet eyes icy. A terrifying divine ability flickered around him, registering in Xindu's spiritual sense and filling him with utter disbelief.

'Perfected all five divine abilities... How is that possible? Who in this world with a perfected divine ability doesn't have a famous name? If such a person could have acted, why would Murong Yan and Shilou Yingge have needed to risk their lives? Who is this?'

His body began to tremble, and he dared not move a muscle. The riverbank fell utterly silent.

"Boom!"

Dark light gathered in the sky. Ning Wan silently lowered her head. Chen Yin was stunned, completely at a loss. The man's eyes swept the surroundings, where the four Merciful Ones were still clutching their bellies, roaring with laughter.

They seemed completely unaware that anything was wrong. The four massive golden bodies lifted their legs and waved their arms, rocking back and forth in the air with comical laughter. Yet the entire sky was eerily silent. These Merciful Ones produced no sound at all, nor did they show any sign of stopping.

"We respectfully welcome Lord Suiguan..."

Ning Wan's pleasant voice echoed in the air, striking Xindu's ears like a clap of thunder.

Xindu certainly understood what this level of cultivation meant. In the current age, short of a True Monarch descending, a perfected divine ability was the absolute apex of power! But when the name 'Suiguan' emerged, it filled his heart with a bone-chilling, absolute despair.

'Suiguan... the one who descended from Pristine Speech Heaven, transformed from a divine ability... the inhuman Suiguan...'

Although the gap in strength was immense, they were all in the Purple Mansion Realm. A perfected divine ability and mastery of all five methods was terrifying, but as long as it wasn't an expert on the level of Mount Luoxia, Xindu had specifically borrowed a treasure. If he immediately shed his dharma body, he should have a chance to live. But it just had to be Suiguan!

Suiguan's pupils didn't even register Xindu's presence. He just quietly admired the surrounding scenery. It seemed like a long time, or perhaps only an instant, before he finally raised his hand.

Xindu felt hot blood rush to his head. He knew this Pristine Water Great Daoist Master with his perfected divine ability wasn't here to chat! He was here to take his life-mandate!

He finally retrieved the purple talisman that had hung in his sleeve for years, always ready. It leaped out, transforming into streams of brilliant, flashing light in front of him. Simultaneously, his hands formed a seal.

'Pureheart Light-Shift Art!'

All the divine ability and dharma power in his body surged into the spell arts as he executed the escape arts he had prided himself on for so many years, the very technique that had saved his life time and time again!

A blinding white light erupted from his body. It resonated with the divine ability he had cultivated, the Floating Cloud Body, and was about to transform him into a streak of white light to flee!

But the talisman's light had barely flared before it froze under Suiguan's mocking gaze. It fluttered lightly away from Xindu and drifted into Suiguan's hand.

He pinched the talisman between two fingers, glancing at it briefly. Xindu finally had his chance and shot into the air. But a dot of greenish-blue light suddenly appeared before him.

The light was no bigger than a thumb, but in his eyes, it transformed into a vast, azure barrier that sealed off heaven and earth. Xindu's pupils dilated. He didn't know whether to advance or retreat. Despair consumed him.

But an icy chill was already on the back of his neck.

In his endless despair, a single conviction remained. A speck of bronze light, the size of a thumb and shaped like a hexagon, flew from the robes at his chest.

As it unfurled slightly, it became recognizable as a tiny bronze sparrow, no bigger than a fingernail. Its form was fluid, dotted with pinpricks of silver light. It shot quickly into Xindu's mouth.

This item had an extraordinary origin. He had spent a fortune to borrow it from a Daoist Master in the Zhao Court, precisely as a life-saving measure for his trip south! Once activated, not even ghosts or gods could find him!

All his divine ability surged to the tip of his tongue, attempting to pour every last bit of his cultivation and power into this one gamble...

But the instant the thought formed, those blue-violet eyes flashed. He felt a heavy, stagnant sensation flood his mind, and the large hand was already clamped around his neck.

As the heavy glow of Pristine Water enveloped him, the divine abilities coalescing on his body were like lingering snow meeting a blazing sun. They all melted into the glow and vanished, leaving him captured, solid and helpless, in that grip.

This demonic cultivator from the north hadn't even lasted three moves before he was captured alive, limp as a dead dog.

The azure-robed man before him still hadn't spared him a single glance. He held him casually, his gaze fixed on the far distance, his face filled with a chilling smile.

No one spoke. Only Li Zhouwei silently composed his expression.

The Great Void was sealed, and none of the divine ability experts present could peer into it. But Li Zhouwei, using an Immortal Artifact, could see clearly. At this moment, more than one great divine ability wielder was already standing within the Great Void!

The Great Void was a chaotic mess. Myriad golden lights, patches of dissipating clouds, a manifested Buddhist Land flowing with radiance, a gloomy, ghastly cold, surging white light... Whether they had arrived earlier or just now, they all stood quietly, faintly surrounding Suiguan, watching him in silence.

Suiguan, however, just smiled and looked up.

At some unknown point, a dense fog had covered the entire riverbank. The demonic cultivators, rogue cultivators, Buddhist cultivators, and immortal cultivators fighting in the north were completely oblivious to the roiling mist around them, their battles within it only growing more intense...

The fog grew thicker and thicker, soon bringing with it billowing waves of black vapor. It swiftly crossed the northern side of the great river and rushed toward the Funan region, submerging the dark, oppressive mountain ranges, the newly built temples, and the countless villages.

"Drip. Drop."

The dark light in the sky intensified. A fine rain began to fall across the land. It was not a heavy rain, but it was piercingly cold. Just two or three drops made one's body feel sluggish and heavy.

Suiguan bathed in the rain, appearing relaxed and at ease. Xindu, however, began to tremble violently in his grasp.

Specks of blackness slid down his cheeks. His black hair was quickly washed away, revealing a sparse, pale skull beneath. His flesh rolled and dissolved into white vapor, streaming down his face. His hands remained locked on Suiguan's wrist, struggling weakly.

Even though his struggles were useless, his intense will to live made him keep the bronze sparrow clamped firmly in his mouth. He poured his divine ability into it ceaselessly, heedless of the cost, begging for a single chance at survival.

Countless silent and profound gazes watched from every direction. The dense, dark light completely obscured the sky, plunging the entire battlefield into darkness, black as night. The only things with any light were those four massive golden bodies, each standing in a different direction, merely laughing.

Everything was soon swallowed by a heavy darkness so thick one could not see their hand in front of their face.

'It must be the Heavy Murk!'

After an unknown amount of time, Ning Wan lowered her head slightly. There was no longer any movement from the mist at her feet. From the bank of the great river all the way to the expansive lands of Baijiang Creek, there was likewise no sound, as quiet as an uninhabited Wilderness.

The four enormous golden bodies began to waver. Their massive forms trembled in the black vapor, as if the majestic statues had been struck by heavy hammers. They emitted dull sounds of pain, followed by a violent shattering, like countless boulders tumbling down.

"Crash... Rattle..."

The hiss of sand and gravel mixed with the sound of shattering glass, becoming the only sound in the dark world. And in this pitch-black land, only one point of light remained: the bronze sparrow in Xindu's mouth.

Suiguan's expression was peculiar. He laughed out loud.

"To think he even prepared a Stargazing Bronze Sparrow for himself!"

Hearing this name, an incredulous light flashed in Ning Wan's eyes. She suddenly raised her head, staring blankly at the small bronze sparrow in the demonic cultivator's mouth.

Suiguan finally released his grip. Xindu's body, tattered like crumpled paper, collapsed. A dense white light gathered upon his remains, and finally, endless clouds and mist drifted up from his body, scattering toward the heavens.

The celestial phenomenon of his fall surged into the sky, causing waves of ripples. The billowing clouds drifted, appearing exceptionally dark and somber within the black aura of Pristine Water, devoid of any divine mystery.

"RUMBLE!"

A dull roar surged up from the earth veins. Clear spring water burst forth from beneath their feet. A fierce wind suddenly rose, and the mist that had covered the battlefield began to advance northward at incredible speed.

Suiguan stood silently amidst the roiling, northward-rushing mist, his eerie, blue-violet eyes narrowing with satisfaction.

Before him, the dark sea of mist receded like a tide, revealing inch by inch of bare earth, clear spring water, and endless white bones in countless different postures.

The vast lands north of the great river were now devoid of life.

Some of these skeletons still held dharma artifacts; others were kneeling on the ground, their bones gleaming with a gentle light. But even more numerous were the countless corpses still standing in the distant Baijiang Creek basin, their reflections captured in the fragmented pools of spring water.

In recent years, the Way of Great Desire had relocated millions of temple tenants from the north. Within dozens of breaths, they had all been silenced. White bones filled the fields, and spring water surged in waves.

The radiant light of the divine ability that constantly shrouded Suiguan finally dispersed. The familiar Great Void reappeared in everyone's vision.

The ten-thousand-zhang golden light, the layers of Buddhist Land—all had vanished. Every Purple Mansion Realm expert present was stunned, staring silently at the Great Void.

In the always dark and silent Great Void, a change had finally occurred. A sliver of bright light appeared.

This light was like a new moon, revealing a very shallow arc, blue on top and white on the bottom. It hung in the Great Void, sometimes blurring, sometimes sharpening, but it held everyone's gaze.

The arc of light seemed to be suppressed by something, flickering in and out of view. The remaining parts of it would occasionally emerge, only to be plunged back into darkness so quickly it was as if they had never appeared. But these were Purple Mansion Realm masters—how could they not see it clearly!

They could all see dense clusters of Daoist temples and palaces flickering within the light. The pavilions and towers were a stark, clear white and a deep, grayish-black. They could even faintly discern countless long feathers hanging beneath the eaves, dancing in the wind.

Suiguan's blue-violet pupils silently reflected the scene in the Great Void. A low chuckle escaped his lips.

"Its reputation is well-deserved... truly well-deserved. Worthy of the Wanling Upper Sect. How difficult... The light of Primordial Magnetism, the air of the Merging Owl, the aura of the Floating Cloud... still, it refuses to enter the world. But... as long as it has revealed its location... everything else becomes simple."

Li Zhouwei's grip on his halberd tightened. Understanding dawned in his heart.

'Wanling Heaven.'

His gaze fell on Suiguan's azure-robed back, and the words from that day echoed in his ears once more:

'Now, I want to cross the river to handle some business. And also to tidy up the scenery.'

'Suiguan's words weren't wrong... or rather, Pristine Water... how could he be the one to contend with Luoxia? Suiguan was just using the situation from start to finish. He might have even arranged this with the Viewing Pavilion faction long ago...'

'Ever since he arrived with the scroll and found Qi Lanyan and the others absent, Li Zhouwei had a premonition. After secretly observing the Great Void, he now understood. Suiguan's scheme... was merely to bring the final act of this grand play in Jiangbei to a close.'

'Those so-called "left on the north bank"... Xindu was a pre-arranged sacrifice. Murong Yan, Shilou Yingge, and the others... they were all targets to be eliminated or disciplined...'

'Why were there explicit prohibitions against destroying the earth veins and spiritual meridians during all those battles in Jiangbei, despite the fertile spiritual energy of the land? Everyone thought it was for Li Qianyuan's reincarnation, but the truth was the exact opposite... Even Li Qianyuan's presence in Jiangbei... was all for the sake of the Secret Diffusion.'

'Everything in the Tangdao Mountain Range was part of the plan long ago... True Monarch Taiyuan might have even been one of the great powers who facilitated this... He alone controls all the Dui Metal under heaven. If there was a hidden threat of Primordial Magnetism on his doorstep, how could he not eliminate it!'

Li Zhouwei looked down at the bones littering the field at his feet, his gaze lowering in silent contemplation.

'Kui Qi... Did Kui Qi understand? His final shout before death... had he already foreseen this day? His choice to die in the Tangdao Mountain Range... was it compromise, or helplessness...?'

The piercing light continued to drift through the Great Void, reflecting in Ning Wan's eyes. In that instant, her heart leaped into her throat. She finally understood.

'So that's how it is!'

A chill bored its way from her heart deep into her mind. The woman hesitated, her lips trembling as if she wanted to speak.

But Suiguan seemed not to notice. He just stood quietly, admiring the scene before him. Soon, he looked up, smiling as he observed the grotto-heaven in the Great Void.

The world remained dark and heavy. Ning Wan slowly closed her eyes. After a moment's hesitation, her voice trembling slightly, she spoke:

"My lord... since Baijiang Creek is settled... Senior Tinglan and Senior Houfu are fighting in the Profound Territory... I request you send aid..."

Her trembling, melodic voice scattered in the wind. Suiguan, however, continued to stare at the Great Void, offering no reply. After a long time, he finally turned back, smiling.

His face showed no sign of ruthlessness or malice. From beginning to end, there was only that faint smile and an eerie, Flood Dragon-like quality. He spoke:

"What does that have to do with me?"

"BOOM!"

Following a deafening crack of thunder, a torrential downpour descended. Lightning flashed through the clouds, illuminating Ning Wan's already pale face, turning it stark white.

In the gloom, the cultivators from the south, awed by the divine ability, had begun to tentatively cross the river. One or two of them stepped into the clear water and stood dumbfounded amidst the endless bones, utterly bewildered.




# Chapter 957: Azure Pond

The river surged, its dark waters churning violently. Shards of broken ice tumbled and collided, flashing like the fins of some unknown behemoth surfacing from the depths, radiating a bone-chilling light.

The black-robed old man stood frozen in mid-air, staring forward in utter disbelief, his lips trembling.

Qu Bushi was not a skilled fighter. He had been flying high above, observing the situation and ready to provide support. He hadn't sensed a thing when the thick fog first began to roll across the battlefield.

But as the roiling mist swept past his feet, retreating northward like a tide, he found himself watching, mesmerized and blank, even though it hadn't touched him directly.

In a single breath, the battlefield had gone from deafening chaos to absolute, dark silence.

The thunderous, imposing charge from the north bank had vanished. Those monks, one after another, who had fearlessly crossed the river seeking their next life, were now nothing but white bones. They stood, legion, in the dark rain, their silence terrifying.

His vision dimmed, and his spiritual sense felt as if it were coated in dust. Endless white bones, twisted into different postures, stood in the darkness. Most of them seemed to be staring blankly right at him. Qu Bushi still couldn't process what had happened; he only felt a creeping, profound horror.

As if waking from a nightmare, Qu Bushi finally recognized that something was terribly wrong. He stood frozen for another moment, then slowly looked down. Two full breaths passed before he mumbled:

"A divine ability... A divine ability!"

His whisper instantly became a frantic shout that echoed in the night. Qu Bushi scrambled to summon the wind, fleeing south in a panic. He had only just started when he heard a low call from nearby:

"Elder Qu!"

Li Zhouming appeared on the wind, his expression panicked. He didn't dare ignite any spiritual light. When he saw Qu Bushi, his pupils dilated in horror.

"Old man Qu... you!"

Qu Bushi looked down, his vision blurring. Only then did he realize his entire lower body had already turned to white bone. A heavy, overwhelming urge to fall unconscious washed over him. He mumbled, "Ah... I've been hit by the divine ability!"

Li Zhouming had been farther from the battle's center and was less affected by the divine ability's wave. He was on the riverbank to regroup with his brothers but had stumbled upon the old man instead. A pang of sympathy struck him.

He quickly grabbed the old man, infusing his own Bright Yang dharma power to protect his heart. With frantic speed, he flipped open his sleeve, retrieved a small, pale red flower, and stuffed it into the old man's mouth. He glanced left and right at the deathly quiet Wilderness and whispered frantically,

"There's no one left... Go! We have to get back to the north bank, old man Qu! You can only be saved if we get back to the mountains."

He lifted Qu Bushi and, looking at the fields of bone below and in the distance, his eyes suddenly stung with unshed tears.

"What in the world were we fighting? What did they even die for? Millions of lives... did a single one of them even understand why!"

He quickly composed himself and shot forward. The powerful divine ability still lingered over the battlefield, dulling his spiritual sense and distorting his perception of distance. After flying for a while, nearing the battle's center, an immense wave of dharma power suddenly washed over him.

"Who's there!"

A chill shot through Li Zhouming's heart. He hesitated, then realized the surging dharma power glowed with a silver light. It was holding aloft a woman in feathered robes. Her dark brows were tightly locked, and a thick, bloody aura was mixing with the silver radiance erupting from her body.

"Que'Wan?"

Li Zhouming's heart clenched. But Li Que'wan's speed was astonishing. She shot past him, giving him only the briefest glance before vanishing into the oppressive darkness.

'What's happening!'

The intense radiance and spiritual wind left Li Zhouming stunned. He hesitated for a fraction of a second, but finally grit his teeth. His Bright Yang dharma power flared to life, illuminating his own spiritual light, and he turned to chase after her.

But Li Que'wan's Dao-Profundity and cultivation base were both far beyond this 'uncle' of hers. Li Zhouming flew for a long time and nearly lost her. After weaving uncertainly through the darkness, he finally spotted the glint of silver light again.

It turned out Li Que'wan had already landed on the ground, the flickering silver light making her position clear.

The short, intense burst of dharma power had left her face extremely pale and slick with cold sweat, plastering strands of dark hair to her temples. The woman paid it no mind. One hand formed a seal while the other swept her sleeve heavily across the ground.

The scattered bones were instantly cleared away. She fell to her knees and, using her dharma power, pulled a round, lumpy object from the mud. Li Zhouming finally staggered to a halt beside her. He looked down, and his pupils shrank to pinpricks.

The object was a person's head.

The man had a square face and thick eyebrows. His eyes were clamped shut, his jaw clenched so tightly that the muscles in his cheeks bulged. But the flesh of his face looked as if it had been blasted by some force, shredded and torn like tattered cotton.

The head rested on a ruin of shattered bone and flesh. The man's upper body was incomplete, lying in the sand of the riverbank with organs spilled around it. His entire lower half had been reduced to white bone, looking so brittle it might disintegrate at a touch.

Piles of talisman ash and fragments of dharma artifacts were scattered near the head. Li Zhouming felt as if he'd been struck by lightning. He collapsed to his knees beside Li Que'wan, crying out in horror:

"Zhouda!"

This was, indeed, Li Zhouda!

Li Zhouda always led the charge in battle. His cultivation and skills had grown rapidly over the years, but against a cataclysmic divine ability of this level, he had been among the most deeply affected. Even with the talismans and dharma artifacts from the clan protecting him, and despite clearly taking decisive measures to save himself when the wave hit, he was now only a moment away from death.

Li Que'wan gave two pained coughs, spitting up a mouthful of blood essence. Her hands moved, gently tapping a point on his forehead before she began stuffing a Wanling Flower into the head's mouth. She looked up at Li Zhouming, her eyes red, and said hoarsely,

"Uncle, you should go..."

Li Zhouming wanted to say more but didn't dare interrupt her rescue. He finally understood why she had rushed here. 'The divine ability's power is still lingering. Although the mist has retreated north, its power is thin, having covered such a vast area. But normal divination methods would never be able to find family members. The only way was to rush to the heart of the battlefield and use shamanic arts to calculate their location within the affected zone...'

'But no matter how thin, it's _still_ a divine ability! To use shamanic arts to bypass that power and find someone... I can't even imagine the price she must have paid!'

His heart ached with sorrow and pain.

'We never even got to have that drink to celebrate my breakthrough...'

Li Que'wan had no time to spare for him. With a wave of her sleeve, all kinds of spiritual items appeared. She began feeding them into the head's mouth without a second thought. Li Zhouda's condition was already hopeless, but if she could just keep him alive for a little longer... he could still be saved by _that_ divine ability!

Though tears of desperation streamed down her face, her decade of practice in concocting spiritual items kept her hands steady and fast. Most importantly, she possessed the one-of-a-kind, life-saving treasure: the Wanling Flower!

Li Zhouda's aura had already faded to its lowest point, but the spiritual items were tenaciously holding his life in place. As time dripped by, Li Que'wan was sweating profusely. She looked up again, her voice urgent, "Uncle... go get Elder Sun to help!"

Li Zhouming jumped up, flustered, but a brilliant light descended from above. His elder brother's back was already standing before him.

Li Zhouda's eyes snapped open. In an instant, bone and flesh sprouted from his neck. The spilled organs and mangled upper body leaped from the mud as if they had legs, reassembling themselves beneath his head. Even his original armor was reformed, coalescing from Bright Yang Heavenly Light, identical to before. The warrior sat up, turned away, and violently spat out a mouthful of black blood.

At the same time, Qu Bushi, whom Li Zhouming had been holding, miraculously regrew his lower limbs. He stabilized himself on his cloud and bowed deeply, weeping.

"My deepest thanks, Daoist Master!"

Li Que'wan stood up, a wave of relief washing over her. But her anxious expression only eased slightly. She said urgently:

"Uncle... I fear there are still others..."

Li Zhouwei nodded to her. Only then did she and Li Zhouming notice someone else standing behind Li Zhouwei, clearly just rescued as well. His face was extremely pale, but it couldn't hide his exceptional, heroic aura. It was Li Jiangxia.

Just then, the divine ability rippled. All across the riverbank, soldiers in golden armor and robes materialized, riding on beams of light. They fanned out across the land, searching everywhere. In an instant, the darkness was filled with countless brilliant lights, blazing like fires in a lightless forest.

Li Zhouwei's gaze swept over the endless fields of bone, a storm of emotion churning in his chest. 'As long as I participate, as long as the Li family deploys cultivators... Suiguan simply doesn't bother to distinguish between friend and foe. It wasn't just the Buddhist cultivators and civilians from the north who were slaughtered. Even the Li family and Azure Pond cultivators who crossed from the south bank were wounded and killed all the same...'

"Elder Brother!"

Li Zhouming nearly burst into tears, forgetting his usual formalities and calling him "Elder Brother" directly. Li Zhouwei helped Li Zhouda to his feet, then looked at Li Que'wan and praised her.

"You've done well."

After coughing up the black blood, Li Zhouda's complexion looked much better. He was a straightforward man, and his face showed little relief from surviving his ordeal. Instead, it was overflowing with deep hatred and rage. He offered his thanks and tried to kneel again.

Li Zhouwei held him up, his own brow furrowed. "It's good you were quick-witted," he said in a low voice. "You managed to preserve most of your sea of qi. I'll seal it for now to prevent your cultivation from dissipating... We'll perform the full restoration when we get home."

He lifted the three of them into the air and, in a flash, crossed the distance back to the small pavilion on the mountain peak.

Li Jiangqian had entered seclusion some days ago, so the pavilion was empty. Li Zhouwei left Li Jiangxia there to tally their numbers. "Count our casualties," he ordered in a low voice. "Do not act rashly. Just hold the south bank."

Li Jiangxia bowed and accepted the order. Li Zhouwei then took Li Que'wan all the way to the island and entered the inner formation before he finally asked,

"How are your injuries?"

Li Que'wan bowed.

"I only expended some blood and qi for the high-speed flight. The area was indeed difficult to divine, so once I reached the battlefield, I secretly used the Immortal Artifact to pinpoint his location. I did not lose much of my lifespan."

Her eyes were still red. "I just... I don't understand what kind of Pristine Water divine ability... could be this cruel!"

Li Zhouwei had already expected this. He nodded silently. "It was Suiguan," he said softly. "This matter isn't just about the Azure Pond Sect. The millions of people the Buddhist cultivators moved to Jiangbei all these years... it was all in preparation for today! It was for Wanling Heaven!"

Suiguan had revealed the location of Wanling Heaven. The vision in the Great Void had persisted for a long time and was only now beginning to fade. It was clear from Suiguan's actions that Wanling Heaven's descent was only a matter of time!

'Anhuai Heaven, Wanling Heaven... both are renowned grotto-heavens in Jiangbei. Back then, Anhuai Heaven's Metallic Essence attracted attention from all sides, even drawing out cultivators at the Purple Mansion Realm. Wanling Heaven is even more ancient and esteemed. The chaos it brings will surely be even more intense!'

Seeing him lost in thought, Li Que'wan said, deeply shaken, "So it was Daoist Master Suiguan... But the cultivators below... they only know it was an Azure Pond Pristine Water divine ability. They are all saying Daoist Master Ning used some terrifying, forbidden treasure..."

"On my way back, I saw cultivators everywhere in a state of terror. Even in the long struggle between north and south, such a cruel method has not been seen in hundreds of years!"

"Azure Pond's reputation as a demonic sect... is now likely number one in all of Jiangnan. It can never be erased... Daoist Master Qiuhu... I wonder how she will face this!"

...

_BOOM!_

Thunder cracked, and the world lit up for an instant. In the flash, one could faintly see specks of ghostly white dotting the darkness—the spectral gleam of bone.

The river along the Wilderness bank had flooded, spanning several miles to lap at the foot of the peaks. Even on the highest ground of the bank, the water was ankle-deep. Scattered figures stood in the water or hovered just above its surface, as silent as statues.

Ning Wan rode the wind and snow back, her expression already calm. She landed on the Wilderness peak, where Lin Wuning stepped forward to receive her.

This man, who had been so spirited and confident since taking power in the sect, now looked utterly lost and terrified. He bowed before her, stammering,

"Ma... Master..."

Ning Wan's gaze swept across the peak. Not a single Azure Pond cultivator dared to meet her eyes. All of them wore strange, unsettled expressions. The only exception was Li Yuanqin, who stood calmly to the side, waiting.

Suiguan had vanished with a simple, "What has this to do with me?" He disappeared as strangely as he had arrived, as if he had never been there at all, leaving her to return alone and face the terrified gazes from the riverbank.

As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had mastered 'Serene Listen', Ning Wan never suffered from illusions. If she had this feeling, it meant Suiguan had already used some profound technique.

If it could affect her, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, then the low-level cultivators across Jiangnan would likely, slowly, forget Suiguan ever existed.

'What a method... truly, what a method. It must be some art to sever karmic ties, to escape retribution, and thereby nurture his own life-mandate!'

"What is it..."

Ning Wan masked her thoughts, gazing quietly at her disciple. Lin Wuning grew even more fearful and whispered,

"The people from Purple Smoke... and Xiukui... they suddenly withdrew. Without a single word... I'm afraid something's happened. They're say... saying..."

Ning Wan's expression cooled. "There is no need to speak with them further," she said flatly.

Lin Wuning didn't know how to reply. He followed Ning Wan into the Main Hall of radiance and waited as she took the main seat. He was about to speak again when the sound of urgent footsteps came from outside. A disciple rushed in and fell to his knees.

"Reporting, Daoist Master! Shanji Prefecture... is under siege by Daoist Masters from Profound Peak Gate! The Master of Sacred Writ Gate has vanished... We heard... we heard their sect is in total chaos, and their main lineage seems to have evacuated long ago..."

Ning Wan seemed not to hear him. Her expression was complex. "Does the Profound Mystery Realm have unusual phenomena?"

The disciple froze, then shook his head, confused.

"Not that I've heard..."

The woman finally closed her eyes, a deep weariness settling on her features. Her divine ability, 'Serene Listen', was being overwhelmed by so much malice and hatred that it had activated on its own, climbing to its absolute peak. The true feelings of everyone on the mountain flooded into her ears.

Lin Wuning kneeling in the hall; Si Tongyi standing silently in the mountain; Fei Qingyi and Qin Xian waiting in the side hall...

From her own Ning family heirs to the inner disciples of Azure Pond, from the visiting rogue cultivators to the fleeing commoners... The wails of grief, the panic of the lost, the cold laughter of observers, the bitter resentment, the burning hatred that wished to flay her skin and eat her flesh...

The roiling aura of Pristine Water had devoured more than just the millions from the north—it had also consumed Azure Pond disciples, heirs from various families, rogue cultivator attendants... even the common people of the Wilderness.

In that instant, her sight pierced straight into everyone's hearts. Vaguely, Ning Wan felt as if she were back at the Pristine Merging Owl Pool, back within that roiling, formless gale. That harsh, ugly voice echoed in her mind once more:

"When I'm dead, and you're sitting here on this Pristine Merging Owl Pool all alone, _then_ you'll know what real trouble is."

In the deep gloom, that gaunt, ghost-like face materialized, its eyes looking as if they would fall from their sockets, still staring at her.

"You are the Lord of Azure Pond! Whether you like it or not, it is no longer 'the Ning family of Azure Pond'..."

"It is—'the Azure Pond of the Ning family'!"




# Chapter 958: Laughter and Tears

Shanji Prefecture.

Kong Tingyun stood desolate atop a mountain peak, her expression lost. Quiet lamps dotted the scene below.

Her knuckles had turned white from gripping the pavilion railing. Below, the mountain was still overcome with joy, and cries of congratulation echoed from all sides.

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Kong!"

Qi Lanyan descended from the sky, offering his own congratulations before speaking with a trace of regret:

"It's just a pity that demonic cultivator was prepared. Although the great array couldn't be moved on short notice, he dismantled the Purple Mansion-level spiritual items within it, leaving behind an empty shell... And to think I even brought my Array-Foundation Sundering Blades. A true case of using an ox-cleaver to kill a chicken."

Kong Tingyun forced a smile, her eyes still filled with lingering fear and shock. For a moment, she didn't know how to reply.

But Qi Lanyan just beamed.

"See? I was right. The Supreme Yang Dao didn't just want your sect; they crossed the river to take your life. If I hadn't sensed it in time, who knows what sort of killing calamity would have befallen Jiangbei."

Kong Tingyun's heart was a knot of complicated emotions. The helpless, despairing eyes of the purple-robed woman still flashed in her mind. "I truly must thank you, my lord," she replied.

"Without you, the Supreme Yang Dao would have dismissed me with a few empty words and some token compensation."

Qi Lanyan simply smiled, saying nothing.

After a long moment, he let out a leisurely sigh. "A pity. Lingmei was too bold..."

"After this, Tinglan won't dare show her face for at least thirty years. The Purple Smoke Blessed Land will seal itself away. And Houfu... that one was cunning enough to break through to a new divine ability, but it was useless. He lost his Dharma body. Even though he used some trick to escape with a spark of his Shengyang Mansion, it's as good as being dead. The Great Xiukui Monastery will inevitably lock down its array. You no longer have anyone holding you back."

"As for Sword Gate... they are set in their ways. The Cheng family is selfish. Acting on a tip from Beihuan, they cut ties early under the pretext of seclusion. You, on the other hand, hold the righteous cause. The fact that Lingmei stepped in to save you this once was already his limit. It means nothing, so don't overthink it."

Hearing this, Kong Tingyun felt nothing but dread, but she kept a polite smile on her face. She murmured,

"Sword Gate did, after all, lend me Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain. This junior is indebted to them..."

"True enough..."

Qi Lanyan propped both elbows on the railing, leaning casually. He smiled.

"Also, those mountains that Yehui took from here... I've already arranged for people to move them back. Your sect will need to handle the work of reconnecting the earth veins. Oh..."

He pointed idly at the sky, shaking his head with a chuckle. "Speak of the devil. Your people can return to the mountain now."

Kong Tingyun raised her head. The night was dark, but a golden carriage was speeding across the sky, shining like a brilliant star and bathing the surroundings in radiance.

Exhausted, she said, "Thank you, my lord."

...

Far across the night sky, golden curtains swayed. An old man sat stiffly inside the carriage, still as a statue, his legs stretched out rigidly.

All noise was blocked by the curtains. The carriage, a gift from the Daoist Master of Chengyun Gate, was truly forged from Heavenly Star Crimson Gold. Kong Guxi felt like his entire body was burning.

His mind was hazy and blank. He had thought the journey would be long, giving him time to think of what to say. But before he could even register the prestige of riding in a Daoist Master's carriage, he felt a slight vibration beneath his feet, and someone called out:

"We respectfully welcome the Sect Master back to the mountain!"

Kong Guxi opened the curtain.

The sky was heavy. A faint white light, like a thin veil, covered the mountain, illuminating it in bright colors. Five golden swords hung in the sky, casting down five long, golden blades that stood like massive pillars among the peaks.

'Those are Lord Qi's Array-Foundation Sundering Blades.'

The treasure's brilliant golden light shone softly through the treetops. The mountainside was packed with kneeling people, lining the main path in prostration. A dense black mass of heads, all wearing Profound Peak attire.

Someone came to help him down. Kong Guxi looked up. It was Kong Xiaxiang.

In a single day, his entire demeanor had changed. His eyes brimmed with the savage pleasure of vengeance fulfilled. His previously stooped back was now straight, and his entire frame seemed to have grown, making him appear tall and imposing.

"My lord!"

Kong Guxi nodded and stepped onto the ground. Gongs and drums thundered, and the faint sound of loud firecrackers drifted up from the mountain's base. The golden light in the sky was so brilliant it filled the mountain with radiance, leaving no shadow untouched. Every face was perfectly clear, glistening with sycophantic praise.

Ahead of him was an ornate golden palanquin. Thick chains snaked from it, connected to a group of wretched men and women. They were bound tightly in shackles, all kneeling on the path, none daring to look up.

Kong Xiaxiang's lips trembled violently. His mouth twisted into a distorted grin, revealing teeth clenched so hard they shook. A chilling laugh rumbled from his throat.

He snarled through his grin:

"These are the animals we captured... the ones who harmed our family, who trampled on us, who changed with the wind and kicked us when we were down... the beasts from the Sacred Writ Demonic Sect who oppressed us... Please, Sect Master, take your seat. Let them carry you up!"

"And this one, their leader..."

Kong Xiaxiang seized a chain and dragged a person from the crowd like a dead dog, leaving a smear of blood on the ground. The man's facial features had been carved off, his cultivation crippled. He could only groan on the ground.

Kong Xiaxiang's eyes were wide and round as he laughed.

"This is our dear Minister Wu... He did so many good deeds after joining the demonic sect!"

This Minister Wu had been a sycophant back when the Li family was in charge, though it was more tolerable then. When the Lis cast him out, he immediately pledged loyalty to the Sacred Writ Gate and began persecuting the Kong family. Now, bloody tears streamed down his ruined face, but his tongue had been cut out, and he could only whimper.

Kong Guxi's face was blank. He took a golden box from his sleeve, opened it, and gently unfolded the item inside. It was a Daoist robe.

The robe was ordinary. It fluttered lightly in the wind, rising and falling just as it had decades ago when it hung from a treetop. Kong Guxi draped the garment over the golden palanquin, then stood beside it, bowing as a junior.

At Kong Xiaxiang's command, the "human animals" at the front began to pull. Their cultivation was destroyed. Those who loved to sneer had their eyes gouged out. Those who loved to look smug had their prominent features sliced away. They bled endlessly, leaving long, dark stains on the path.

The mountain was deathly silent. No one dared to raise their head. The only sounds were the dull dragging, the pained whimpers, and the wet dripping of blood.

Kong Guxi walked beside the palanquin all the way to the summit. The soles of his shoes and the hem of his robes were soaked in blood. The radiance of this day was as bright as the sky had been dim all those years ago when he had fled down this same mountain, desolate and weeping. The light stung his eyes, and tears streamed down his face.

But his expression only grew calmer. He turned, looking down from his high vantage point at the countless fearful members of the Shanji clans who had come to pay respects, at the Sacred Writ disciples who had done no great wrong and were allowed to surrender, and at the terrified disciples of Xuanmiao Temple who dared not look up.

His lips trembled. His voice was hoarse. "All of you. Laugh."

In an instant, the pin-drop-silent mountain exploded with sound. The people began to laugh, terrified and confused. It sounded more like a chorus of hoarse crows cawing, echoing through the forest. The sound stirred the robe on the palanquin, causing it to lift up and float gently back into Kong Guxi's hands.

This unseen omen seemed to bestow upon him a sacred mission. Kong Guxi felt himself grow taller. He held the robe quietly, his bearing solemn and grave.

"Hahaha..."

"Hahahaha!"

The mountainside was a sea of smiling faces. Kong Guxi's head turned slowly, his gaze sharp as a blade, meticulously scanning every single person. He continued until his eyes reached an inconspicuous corner, where his gaze seemed to recoil as if burned. His pupils dilated.

Among the thousands of laughing faces, one remained sallow and calm, like a dry, withered weed. It refused to smile.

It was Kong Qiuyan.

She was holding the hand of a blindfolded child, and she seemed to be trembling.

Amidst the deafening, earth-shaking laughter, Kong Guxi's blade-like gaze shattered. The old man slowly lowered his head. His hand, clutching his ancestor's robe, tightened. He began to choke back sobs, then wept, and finally, he collapsed into the pool of blood, wailing in anguish.

...

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Layers of golden light flashed. A single bright point hung in the air. Inside a simple, ancient pavilion, Heavenly Light began to glow. A middle-aged man in Daoist robes exhaled slowly, causing the empty room to glow white.

Li Ximing opened his eyes. His spiritual sense swept inward. Light flashed within his Sea of Qi, where a vortex of Bright Yang Qi spun around a perfectly round, pill-like Immortal Foundation.

The Immortal Foundation, 'World's Radiance', was complete.

A tiny, twinkling white speck hovered above the Immortal Foundation, resonating with the spiritual mechanism and pouring down a mist-like white qi.

He calmed his mind and began to ponder.

'If I let the Talisman Qi nourish it naturally, it will take about six years for the Immortal Foundation to reach perfection... That's not too slow.'

Li Ximing's cultivation speed was already fast, and Valley Wind Guide-Fire also had the effect of circulating qi, which was a great help.

'If I take pills and enter seclusion, I can probably shave off another two or three years...'

Li Ximing calculated carefully. With the help of spiritual pills, this nurturing process had taken just over a year.

'The difficulty of congealing 'World's Radiance' is significant. If I had tried to form this during my Foundation Establishment Realm, it would have been a massive headache. But for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it just meant an extra month or two. Everything went smoothly.'

With a thought, he appeared inside the lightning-wreathed pagoda. He stood and walked out. The lamps in the palace were dim. Li Ximing swept his gaze over the area, and his heart skipped a beat. "Hm?"

He stepped through the air and materialized in the small courtyard of the inner array. He saw a small stone hanging from a beam. A boy in white robes stood in the yard, striking the stone with a wooden sword, producing dull _thud_ sounds.

Li Ximing hadn't intentionally hidden his presence. The moment he appeared, the boy looked up, sheathed his sword with practiced skill, and exclaimed in surprise and delight:

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing looked him up and down. Those eyes were familiar. He smiled.

"Jiangchun?"

"It is this junior!"

Li Ximing helped the boy up, understanding immediately what this meant. He beamed. "You look exactly like your great-grandfather! How old are you? What cultivation art are you practicing?"

Li Jiangchun quickly invited him into the courtyard, his eyes shining. He served tea and said respectfully, "This junior's spiritual apertures opened late. I am eight years old now and will be nine after the fifth month. I am cultivating the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity and just broke through to the third level of Embyronic Breathing!"

"The Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity!"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He laughed heartily and gestured for the boy to sit, clearly delighted.

"Good! Excellent... I have also read the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity. Although it's an ancient art without a grade, the author who wrote it was meticulous, and their Dao-Profundity was astonishing. It's in no way inferior to your brother's Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun. You must not waste this opportunity."

"Furthermore, the content of the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity is exceptionally detailed. It explains all sorts of cultivation arts and spell arts from low to high, and details the key points of every stage of cultivation. It's as if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator annotated it personally. That's why it's called a 'Scroll'—it's no ordinary thing!"

Li Jiangchun nodded with a smile. Li Ximing made a quick calculation with his fingers, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. He nodded.

"Opened late... so at age seven. Just over a year... to have this kind of cultivation speed... Truly remarkable!"

"He had some help."

The courtyard gate creaked open. Li Zhouwei strode in, smiling as he approached. He spoke using his spiritual sense:

'I studied the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity myself and had an elder compare it. All Yin-aspect Fruition Attainment stems from Supreme Yin. Lesser Yin cultivation arts are naturally subordinate to the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra and are extremely compatible. Jiangchun is cultivating the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra.'

"Oh?"

Li Ximing nodded inwardly. "With the help of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, it's no wonder his cultivation advances a thousand miles a day..."

"Grand-uncle is correct."

Li Zhouwei smiled, then his expression turned serious. "That's precisely why I'm having him stay inside the inner array. He can go out after he reaches the Qi Refining realm... Although he has the Talisman Seed and isn't afraid of being scouted, our family is in the eye of the storm right now. Cultivating too quickly will always attract prying eyes."

Li Ximing laughed. He silently pulled the boy over and saw the calluses on his palms, knowing he worked hard. He smiled without a word, his satisfaction plain to see, only saying, "I once obtained a treasure called Profound Lake Primal Essence. It's said to be immensely beneficial for Lesser Yin. I'll prepare it for you!"

Li Zhouwei chuckled. Li Ximing eagerly turned his head and asked in a low voice, "The Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity requires Lesser Void Yin Qi. How are Minghuang's preparations coming along?"

Li Zhouwei nodded. "It's already being prepared. This qi must be gathered on the night of the new moon, when the turbid qi sinks. You must take spiritual items of the Water Mansion and Supreme Yin lines, place them in a jade vessel, let them rest in the Great Void for one night, and then collect it."

"With a Purple Mansion Realm expert in the family, gathering this qi is much simpler. We just spend one day a month cultivating in the Great Void and bring the items back for them to extract the qi... At this rate, we should have enough within a year or two."

Li Jiangchun listened silently, then bowed deeply in thanks several times.
Li Ximing smiled. "Practicing the sword is a good thing... I was clumsy as a child. At your age, I couldn't sheathe my sword so smoothly. It shows your dedication."

Li Ximing could tell that significant events had likely occurred in the outside world and that Li Zhouwei seemed to have something on his mind. He ended the conversation with praise for the boy and walked out with Li Zhouwei, pacing with him inside the purple-glowing inner array. "What's happened?" he asked in a low voice.

"Suiguan made a move... It was world-shaking. A million corpses, fields piled high with white bones. Grand-uncle has been in seclusion congealing his Immortal Foundation, so I didn't dare disturb you."

Li Zhouwei grimly recounted the events in Jiangbei. Li Ximing listened, falling into a heavy silence.

"The Jiangnan of today has not yet recovered from that catastrophe. Although it looks the same on the surface, the undercurrents are raging. It's a completely different world."

"Ever since the Jiangbei incident concluded, the Purple Smoke Blessed Land and the Great Xiukui Monastery have both sealed themselves off, announcing their seclusion. Our family sent people, but they couldn't get an audience... Although neither side has released any news about their Daoist Master, judging by the situation... the outlook for those two Daoist Masters is far from optimistic. It's impossible to know if they are alive or dead."

Li Ximing was horrified. He had already felt uneasy after hearing about Suiguan, but this news still shook him to the core. "It actually reached that point!"

# Chapter 959, Merit

Li Zhouwei shook his head and led him outside, lowering his voice.

"It's more than that. Granduncle, please look."

The two stepped into the air, traversing the Great Void. Li Zhouwei guided him north until they materialized in a pavilion on the riverbank.

The north was shrouded in a thin mist, where endless white bones still stretched into the distance. A few human figures flickered into view, walking among the skeletal expanse before quickly vanishing back into the fog.

Although the northern bank below was still bustling, it was no longer heavily garrisoned as before. The defenses were now routine, merely to prevent rogue cultivators and demonic cultivators from the north from sneaking onto the lake.

Li Zhouwei remained silent, leading him across the river. Li Ximing stared at the boundless sea of bones, his expression complex, and said nothing.

"The family lost many cultivators. Over a hundred at the Embyronic Breathing stage. The Qi Refining losses were fewer, thirty-one, with eleven from the main clan. Ten at the Foundation Establishment Realm also fell; most were guest retainers from the Azure Pond Sect. Our family lost two."

"That's not many."

Li Ximing nodded. Li Zhouwei shook his head and said,

"I knew he intended to cross the river and suspected there would be casualties. I gave orders long ago, warning them not to be too reckless..."

"Besides... back home, Qu Bushi and Sun Bai aren't strong fighters, Miaoshui is injured, and Chen Yang is sharper than anyone. When you look at our people, it's the old, weak, and wounded. They were never meant to charge the front lines. The only one capable of fighting was Ding Weizeng... so I made arrangements for him. The Azure Pond Sect's Foundation Establishment cultivators naturally had to take the lead."

"The ones from our family who charged the farthest were the Wen brothers, those demonic cultivators, and our clan-relative Zhouda. The Wen brothers assumed that as demonic cultivators, they could escape with their lives no matter what. They figured if they got injured, they'd get compensation from the lake, so they acted recklessly, hoping to scoop up extra benefits. They never expected this, and both of them fell. Zhouda, fortunately, had protective dharma artifacts and talismans and managed to make it back alive."

Li Ximing sighed inwardly. "He truly has great luck. The old master always used to complain to me about his impulsive nature. As soon as he gets worked up about something, he just glares and charges... I have no idea how he ended up like that."

As the two Daoist Masters strolled into the area, a wave of frigid energy washed over them. Surges of Lesser Yin and Baleful Qi filled the air, eroding flesh and chilling to the bone. Ghostly winds howled, and night ravens cawed frantically.

Both Daoist Masters naturally concealed their divine abilities to avoid triggering any spiritual energy conflicts that might reveal their presence. Li Zhouwei spoke,

"The landscape here at Baijiang Creek has been completely altered. Cultivators of all levels now call this place the 'Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.' This was once the territory of the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion..."

"The Pristine Water that was once here has long since vanished. But the Baleful Qi is overwhelming, the air thick with festering resentment. The spiritual energy is in chaos. Mortals cannot live here, and even Qi Refining cultivators are unable to stay for long."

Li Ximing glanced over and did indeed spot a few Qi Refining cultivators, armed with dharma artifacts and talismans, searching for something in the ruins. Li Zhouwei continued in a low, somber tone,

"Aside from the various artifacts and treasures left behind by the cultivators who fell back then, the spiritual energy here fluctuates in a bizarre way. Every so often, there's a disturbance from the Great Void, and new spiritual items manifest. Over the past year, this has been happening more and more frequently."

Li Ximing heard this and immediately understood.

'Spiritual items don't just manifest from thin air. The most common cause is a Grotto-Heaven... I fear that some powerful divine ability, or perhaps a Dharma Treasure, is stirring within the Great Void. It must be slowly pulling that Grotto-Heaven back into the mortal world. That would disrupt the local spiritual energy, causing this instability and forcing items to manifest from the void.'

'By now, most people must understand. The repeated clashes between the north and south, all these killing calamities... they were all for the sake of the Wanling Heaven. Zhouwei caught a glimpse of it that day. It seems this is the very place it is fated to descend.'

Li Zhouwei pointed north. "Everyone says the Buddhist cultivators find it impossible to cross the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, so we've had some peace. I hear Murong Yan and his people are camped just north of it. Xiaoshi Mountain and Tangdao Mountain are still occupied by the Buddhist cultivators... Xuanmiao Temple is where Qi Lanyan and the others are cultivating... And Profound Peak... has been re-established."

'Impossible for them to cross? What nonsense. That's just the wishful thinking of cultivators below the Purple Mansion Realm. This is the destined anchoring point for the Wanling Heaven. Who would dare fight recklessly here and risk disrupting that?'

Li Ximing's understanding deepened. However, hearing the name of the Profound Peak Gate brought no words of congratulations, only a sigh of complex emotion.

"The Kong Clan... it hasn't been easy for them."

The two walked toward the center of the formations as Li Zhouwei continued,

"The Capital immortals Dao returned their mountain, but they can't touch it. Zhu Gong took most of her core disciples but left behind a number of demonic cultivators for them. Kong Xiaxiang was so furious he rounded up those small-timers to vent his anger... It's hard to say if that was arranged, just to make a statement."

"Senior Kong still hasn't visited the lake herself—it must be inappropriate for her to do so. She sent Kong Guxi and Kong Xiaxiang in her stead."

He raised an eyebrow.

"Kong Guxi was weeping with gratitude but didn't dare say much. Kong Xiaxiang, on the other hand, feels some gratitude toward our family. He always had a short fuse, but he's experienced such a drastic rise and fall—none of it by his own choice—that his mental state is now shattered."

"People talk about being plagued by inner demons, but his condition is worse. His fundamental peace of mind has been shattered. It will be very difficult for him to recover... and you can't blame him for it."

They sat at a table in the main hall. The Daoist Master in the platinum-gold robes was silent, watching the clear tea stream into his cup with a soft sound. Li Zhouwei filled the cup and spoke quietly,

"In the eleventh month, Suiguan killed Xindu and the Four Merciful Ones. No one at Baijiang Creek was spared. The world doesn't know the truth and still blames Daoist Master Qiuhu. But Que'Wan and a few others know what happened, and it was recorded."

"Later, the blessed land was sealed, Xiukui went into seclusion, and the Profound Peak Gate was restored. Third Granduncle's disciple, Quan Yuduan, came to deliver a message."

He paused here, adding an explanation. "The information that Guest Retainer Wushao had? It originally came from them."

Li Ximing nodded to show he understood. Li Zhouwei continued,

"I made a point to meet with him. He holds some animosity toward the Ning family and felt lost, so he left the mountain. When we spoke of Daoist Master Suiguan, Quan Yuduan could only recall that such a Great Daoist Master existed. As for any doubts or suspicions... he had none at all."

Li Ximing frowned. Li Zhouwei continued,

"So I had Que'Wan retrieve the records from that time. The name 'Suiguan' had vanished. The entire passage of text was blurred and illegible."

"As of today, the world only remembers that Daoist Master Ning of the Azure Pond Sect used one of the sect's secret talismans to kill the demonic cultivator Xindu on the river. As for the rest... as for Suiguan... no one remembers him at all."

"By my estimation, in the entire world, only a few of the most noble bloodlines can still remember him. Anyone below the Purple Mansion Realm has forgotten. And all the deeds they can't place... they attribute them all to Daoist Master Qiuhu."

Li Ximing was silent for a moment, then asked,

"How is Daoist Master Qiuhu?"

Li Zhouwei's gaze was complex.

"Daoist Master Qiuhu has been in seclusion for over a year and has not emerged. Lin Wuning is mediocre; he has no way to control his subordinates. The Azure Pond Sect is now riddled with factions, in chaos from top to bottom. It has reached the point where it has no power left to govern its own territories."

"According to Quan Yuduan, there are hardly any clear appointments for market towns or islands anymore. If you want a post, you just have to bribe the right person with spirit stones and resources, and you can almost always get it."

This was an extremely bad sign. Li Ximing frowned slightly and asked,

"They can always earn back what they spend on bribes. If this continues long-term, how can the sect possibly endure...?"

Li Zhouwei sipped his tea and replied,

"You are right, Granduncle. Ever since the tragedy at Mount Bianyan, the Azure Pond Sect has been a mix of good and bad. The Ning family was always weak, and now their influence has completely evaporated. With Daoist Master Qiuhu letting go of the reins, her subordinates are all at a loss. The various prefectures are seething with discontent, held in check only by their fear of her personal might."

"Everyone is just using her name to further their own schemes. Tributes have become a mere formality; in reality, they've ceased. I fear that even Simin Prefecture, right at the foot of their mountain, has few people who feel any loyalty to the Azure Pond Sect."

Li Ximing shook his head and sighed,

"What does it matter? Even if the Azure Pond Sect is rotten to the core, its outer shell is still enough for the prefecture clans to feed on for a century. He's just loosened his grip, taking a nap. As long as the treasures in their vaults remain untouched and his Fruition Attainment remains supreme, this is just a way of letting the local powers fatten themselves up."

"The day he decides to wake up, the cycle will just begin anew."

Li Zhouwei's expression was unreadable. He said in a low voice,

"I'm just afraid... he won't be waking up."

The two paused, saying no more. Li Zhouwei's expression turned serious.

"There is one matter I must discuss with you, Elder. Jiangqian is in seclusion. By my calculations, he isn't far from emerging. He'll be at the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm, which means we must start searching for his Purple Mansion breakthrough item!"

Li Ximing's heart tightened as he mentally calculated.

'The Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun is a sixth-grade scripture with four secret arts. It took me just over ten years to master three of them...'

'The Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun is a grade higher than the Radiant Essence Scripture, but the latter's secret arts are far simpler, so it's not a fair comparison. Besides, Li Jiangqian's training and resources are far better than what I had.' He tried to find a reasonable estimate,

'Even assuming he's fast... it will take him fifteen, maybe twenty years to master the secret arts. That's about the same time it takes to refine a divine ability. We absolutely must start preparing.'

Li Ximing thought it over and said with some embarrassment,

"You're right. In fact, we need to consider Que'Wan's item as well. That Whole Pill spiritual item that was traded away... that debt is on me. If we need to find two such items in the next twenty to twenty-five years, things are indeed tight."

"Luckily, I have some connections in the Southern Borderlands now... I will write a letter and ask those few Demon Kings in the Southern Borderlands. Maybe they'll have some leads."

Li Zhouwei nodded and replied,

"That is a sound plan, Granduncle."

He was privately wondering if he might find something if he got the chance to enter the Wanling Heaven, but nothing was certain, so he kept it to himself. He mused,

'It seems Viewing Pavilion is Luoxia's most direct subordinate. That being the case, they must be eager for me to advance quickly. If an opportunity arises for people to enter the Wanling Heaven, they will surely go out of their way to get me a spot.'

Seeing Li Ximing lost in thought about the spiritual items, Li Zhouwei produced a thick letter and handed it to him with a smile.

"This is from Qize. It arrived at our estate a month ago, but we didn't dare open it, fearing it would be disrespectful. We waited for you, Elder."

Li Ximing chuckled, shook out the silk letter, and glanced at it. A strange light flashed in his eyes, and he laughed,

"This is good news!"

"That Daoist Master Luo from the Southern Borderlands... he was interested in that Marvelous Wisdom Whisker I'm holding. He recently took a trip to the Southern Sea, found Demon King Tuodu of the Si Sea, and traded for a rare mineral. It's called Heavenly Star Crimson Gold."

The name sounded familiar. Li Zhouwei asked, "Is that the white elephant who is subservient to the Buddhist cultivators? The one who cultivates the Baleful Qi path?"

"That's the one. This Heavenly Star Crimson Gold is a Li Fire-attributed spiritual resource for the Purple Mansion Realm. It's said to form when the stars shift in the heavens and the 'light of departing metal' plunges into the frigid sea to congeal. It's considered an excellent material for forging armor."

The letter was a thick sheaf of papers, apparently full of flattery. Li Ximing chuckled.

"There's also a personal letter from Tuodu here. He even explained the origin of the spiritual item. He said he got the Heavenly Star Crimson Gold at Crimson Reef Island and split it fifty-fifty with Changyun of the Chengyun Gate. The source is not a problem."

"That's the first thing."

Li Ximing laughed loudly and said again,

"There's also an invitation from this white elephant. This Demon is desperately poor. He wants me to perform alchemy for him but is apparently unwilling to offer anything of value. He just says he'll only take half the refined pills... How dull."

He said this, but he clearly had other ideas, and smiled.

"I'll not only take a pill or two from his share, I'll also refine a quantity that far exceeds his expectations. I'll make him owe me a personal favor... and then I'll have him gather information on spiritual items for me!"

He laughed heartily and continued,

"And that's not all! Senior Liu Changdie has been in the Eastern Sea for over a year now. With his help, the Neck Feathers have likely already been condensed. You just focus on your cultivation. I will handle all of these matters!"

Li Zhouwei couldn't help but smile and shake his head. With a light wave of his sleeve, the doors to the great hall sealed shut. His expression grew solemn.

"Granduncle, do you recall the immortal Order for the High Firmament Pavilion? Do you remember how many Immortal Merits we have?!"

Li Ximing was affected by his solemn expression and asked doubtfully,

"Of course I remember. Three hundred and fifty-seven. Not one has been spent!"

Li Zhouwei said in a low voice,

"In my recent battles, I've become keenly aware of my own shortcomings. After the war, I wanted to select a new spell art, so I went to the pavilion to browse the Bright Yang spell arts. I found one I liked, called 'Emperor Qi's Light'."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. "What's the hesitation? If you exchange for a spell art, we can both study it. Even if I don't have the energy to actively use it, it will be an excellent reference. What does it do? How many Immortal Merits?"

Li Zhouwei, cutting him off, continued seriously, "I chose this art for a reason. It's similar to the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light spell art, but it's fifth-grade. Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light is about accumulating and then suppressing—it's heavy and ponderous. This new art, however, is a divine ability centered at the glabella. It projects light, overwhelming the enemy with a multitude of sharp, rapid strikes."

"My Audience with the Celestial Gate is already a cumbersome divine ability. If all my Spiritual Artifacts, divine abilities, and spell arts are 'heavy' techniques, I'll be too easily targeted and countered. I need to cultivate something light and fast. This way, the two arts cover different needs, and it will also be useful for your own research, Granduncle. What's more... I can use that Supreme Yang spiritual item, the Concealed Plunder Gold, to cultivate it!"

"As for the Immortal Merits, it requires one hundred and nineteen."

Li Ximing was overjoyed and slapped the table. "Do it! Exchange for it!"

Li Zhouwei smiled and shook his head, a glint of true joy in his eyes.

"That's not the only thing I wanted to say. When I felt the impulse, I took out the immortal Order and checked it on the stone platform in the High Firmament Pavilion... and I discovered by chance... our Immortal Merits are now four hundred and seventeen!"

"What?!"

Li Ximing froze. His heart leaped. He met Li Zhouwei's joyful gaze and, in a flash, understood.

'Slaying Demons, eliminating devils, and suppressing heterodox paths!'

Li Ximing had never dared to speak of what happened in the heavens that day, but the memory was fresh. The Immortal General had told them how to acquire more Immortal Merits!

His eyes lit up. "It's from... all the conflicts over these past years!"




# Chapter 960: Qi's Light

Li Zhouwei smiled and replied, "It should be."

He immediately added with a touch of regret, "It's just a pity that these past days... I've been racing against time, either in reclusive cultivation or practicing spell arts. I haven't been able to constantly monitor the situation, so I don't know which instances earned them!"

Li Ximing nodded inwardly and soon smiled. "That's fine. Just pay more attention next time. There's no urgent need for it right now. As long as we can secure them, that's all that matters!"

Li Zhouwei nodded and continued, "This junior was overjoyed at the time. I went to the highest meditation cushion in the High Firmament Pavilion and performed the 'Immortal Ascension Art' ritual. I wrote down a writ requesting the Emperor Qi's Light and cast it into the bronze censer. I haven't received any news yet."

"Good, good, good!"

Li Ximing knew he would have arranged it properly and smiled. "It's all thanks to you... I'm always alone at home, and I can't be everywhere at once. Between alchemy and cultivation, it's inevitable that I overlook things."

He glanced at Li Zhouwei and lowered his voice. "But I have one more thing to ask... You received the Illuminating Sun and Moon. After these past few sessions of Dharma combat, has it benefited your Dao-Profundity?"

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment. "Those Dharma combats were fierce, but they weren't a threat to my life-mandate, and I didn't suffer any real injuries. It wasn't entirely satisfying. However, I did receive a measure of feedback to my Dao-Profundity... As for how it helped... I couldn't tell at the time."

He simply sat down, his thoughts clear. "But now, having witnessed so many divine abilities, I've come to a new understanding of this Dao-Profundity. The other day, when I returned with Daoist Master Yushui, he was grateful for my generous help and also had his eye on the Neck Feathers. We chatted a bit, and I seized the opportunity to ask him about it, both to gather intelligence and to establish some classifications."

Chen Yin's strength is considerable, and his ancestors had connections to the Golden Feather, so he is quite knowledgeable. Li Ximing listened intently as he spoke:

"When it comes to Dao-Profundity, everyone in Jiangnan speaks of the 'Two Purples.' Daoist Master Zimu, Wen Qingzhou, is even called the first. But from this junior's perspective... there is one other—if he can even be called a person."

Li Ximing was thoughtful. "Suiguan?"

"Exactly!"

Li Zhouwei's expression turned serious. "Although Dao-Profundity doesn't necessarily increase with age, with enough time, it will gradually be polished to a higher level. What's more, he is intrinsically linked to a True Monarch... That is the terrifying part."

"In terms of Dao-Profundity, Suiguan and Dongfang Heyun are likely first beneath the True Monarchs. Their status is a result of their fundamental nature, something ordinary people cannot touch, so let's not discuss them."

"Below those two is Daoist Master Zimu. Although I have not seen this Daoist Master personally, it's said that Zimu's Dao-Profundity is a cut above Zipei's. He is famous for it, a true standout among those who have perfected their divine abilities."

A trace of amazement entered his expression. "Daoist Master Chen holds him in high esteem and said only this of him: 'To reach this point in cultivation is to reach the pinnacle'!"

Li Ximing sighed. "I've long heard of him!"

Li Zhouwei actually still remembered that Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia, but he didn't know their name and couldn't say much, so he didn't mention it. He placed that individual and Zimu above Zipei, then continued,

"Daoist Master Zipei wasn't skilled in Dharma combat, but her Dao-Profundity was renowned. Chunyi Dao Gate once had another with high Dao-Profundity, Daoist Master Yuanshang, and Mount Changhuai had the fallen Great Daoist Master Qing. They can be considered the first tier—the peak a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator can hope to achieve in a lifetime."

Li Ximing was astonished. "Daoist Master Zipei is ranked that far down... Ninety-nine percent of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the world should be ashamed!"

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "That's already extremely good. Below them are Great Daoist Masters who have either received a precious Dao Lineage or whose own lineage is inherently world-renowned and 'radiant', making it easy to elevate their Dao-Profundity, like Changxiao or Chi Buzi. Or, mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who have received some inheritance from a Golden Core, like Daoist Master Pu Yu of Penglai. This is the second tier. They have already trained their Dao-Profundity and spell arts to an extremely profound level."

"The third tier consists of ordinary Great Daoist Masters and some mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators whose Dao-Profundity surpasses their peers, like Chi Wei, or Daoist Master Fuxuan of the Chunyi Dao Gate..."

"The next tier down includes Great Daoist Masters whose divine abilities are innately deficient or restricted, and mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who have worked hard on their Dao-Profundity, like Helian Wujiang... As for which Great Daoist Master, he couldn't speak presumptuously, but he implied it to me."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. It wasn't often he got to hear gossip, and he focused intently. Li Zhouwei lowered his voice. "Chen Yin claimed... that among the 'Twelve Qis,' the Dawn Qi and the Cold Qi correspond to each other. It seems that in ancient times, they were both subjected to some unimaginable method by an Immortal Lord. They were forced to submit, making them easier to cultivate, but from then on, their divine abilities were weakened by a fraction, and their Dao-Profundity became very difficult to deepen... When the Wei State collapsed, the Dawn Qi was liberated and is no longer afflicted, leaving only the Cold Qi."

Though he didn't state the name, the implication was blindingly obvious.

"Tianwan of Crimson Reef Island!"

Li Ximing didn't cultivate Cold Qi himself, so he just listened for amusement and let it pass with a smile. Li Zhouwei continued, "The fifth tier below that can be called 'Entering the Hall.' There's finally a decent number of people here. Usually, anyone who has cultivated two or three divine abilities can touch this threshold."

"Heh!"

Li Ximing had always been an optimist. He just poured some tea and laughed.

"And here I was, wondering if I could cross the threshold of 'Entering the Hall.' Turns out I'm still standing at the foot of the mountain."

Li Zhouwei gave a slightly awkward smile. "Granduncle, you've spent the last century working diligently on alchemy... Naturally, you shouldn't be compared to them..."

Li Ximing then began to consider it seriously. "Changxiao is truly formidable. I still remember one of his spell arts vividly... Where do you place yourself?"

Li Zhouwei nodded gravely. "This junior read more spell arts in my early years and benefited greatly from those secret techniques. I estimate that on the path of Dao-Profundity, I can be considered as 'Entering the Hall.'"

"Now, with this bit of progress, I've been gauging myself. If I could gain ten times this amount, I should be able to test my hand against Helian Wujiang."

Li Ximing calculated inwardly and replied with some envy, "That's quite fast! And you still haven't had your fill of fighting."

Li Zhouwei bowed slightly. Li Ximing then left with a smile, riding a beam of light toward the Eastern Sea. Li Zhouwei saw him off, calling out a reminder, "Granduncle, since you're going to Poluoduo, you still need to ask Demon King Qingyan about the spiritual materials. He cultivates Azure Manifestation. Do you remember that Nine Dams of the Azure Ram Mountain technique we have at home? Its grade is extremely high, and the requirements are strict. It's not suitable for us to cultivate, but it can be exchanged for a good price."

Li Ximing realized the logic in this. Given Demon King Qingyan's rough-and-tumble appearance, his fighting style was likely just as grand and sweeping; the technique would be perfect for him. He agreed cheerfully.

After seeing him off, Li Zhouwei returned to the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda, communed with his Talisman Seed, and advanced his Daoist cultivation.

Time flows differently in cultivation. He had been meditating in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance for a long time when he finally sensed a warmth from the jade pendant at his waist. He let out a long breath and stood up. He did not leave in a hurry, but instead strode through the overlapping layers of clouds to the High Firmament Pavilion.

The stone platform was exceptionally bright under the glow. On the purple-black wooden slips, pale golden characters appeared one by one:

"Observing the Primal Honored Seat, one becomes Emperor. His light spreads to the corners of the sea, and all look upon his majesty. Yet, like the sun moving through the world, he resides in the second-most-prominent position, which thus forms the foundation of this art... The Emperor said: When the Honored One enters the hall as the host, divine radiance fills the chamber; this is High Radiance. When the guest enters the hall, 'Qi's Light' scatters; this is the Yang Cusp. Thus, Emperor Qi's Light was formed! Its Dao is immense..."

This spell art would be given to Li Ximing to cultivate in the future. He read all the golden characters, quickly gathering them into a golden slip in his hand. He annotated it as he comprehended its meaning, then turned lightly and landed back in the thunder-wreathed pagoda.

'So it's a Yang Cusp art of the inverted Bright Yang...'

'Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light is known as 'The Monarch treads into danger, thus there is concealment.' It has a corresponding flavor. They truly do complement each other...'

He appeared on Gardenia Scenery Mountain and sat down among the drifting gardenia blossoms. After reading the doctrinal exposition, he examined the more critical technique manual:

"Within the Juque Palace, conceal Baleful Fire Qi. Condense light and electricity, transforming them into a chamber. Enter as the 'guest' with various divine abilities to create the omen of 'Qi's Light.' It is best to use a Bright Yang spiritual item to assist the 'guest's' cultivation."

Li Zhouwei did not have a Bright Yang spiritual item, but he did have a Supreme Yang spiritual item. The symbolic imagery of this spell art was too strong; it couldn't be a simple substitute. But he estimated inwardly:

'Concealed Plunder Gold does more than just strengthen spiritual light. When my Dao-Profundity deepens, I should be able to have Concealed Plunder Gold transform into the 'host' of the chamber. The Supreme Yang-rank position will be a seamless fit, absolutely perfect... At that time, not only will its power ceiling far exceed Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, it will probably even jump beyond the fifth grade!'

He looked at it carefully, a quiet joy rising in him. With a light wave of his hand, he summoned an item from the Purple Baleful Bright Yang Spring on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. It was the Profound Pattern Vase.

"It needs Baleful Fire Qi, and condensed light and electricity... The Profound Pattern Vase has been refining in this fire vein for decades. There is no Baleful Fire Qi more pure than this!"

As for light and electricity, lightning was extremely rare in Jiangnan, and it should have taken some time to gather. But while other families had little, the Li family had plenty! Li Qinghong had been diligent back in her day, busy her entire life. Using the convenience of her cultivation art, she had stored more than a dozen lightning bolts at home, refusing to use even one... Such a quantity of lightning would take even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator some time to gather.

'The legacy of our predecessors cannot be used without being replenished. Zhouda has also achieved his Immortal Foundation; I should tell him to start using the ritual platform...'

Just as Li Zhouwei finished arranging these matters, he saw Li Que'wan approaching from the mountain path, looking slightly uneasy. "Reporting to the Daoist Master... something has happened to the Yuan family!"

"What?"

Li Zhouwei looked up in surprise. Li Que'wan reported respectfully, "Yuan Chengzhao has been missing for many years, and the Yuan family has been managed by Yuan Zibin. This man is tyrannical and excessive, whipping his elders and subverting clan law. He is also vicious, having purged the clan several times. No one in the Yuan family dared to control him, which has led to today's situation."

"But news just came from the Mushroom Forest Plains. Yuan Zibin was out enjoying himself on the plains when he was killed by a cultivator. Many others were killed with him. The Yuan clan is in chaos, and their clan structure has completely collapsed."

Li Zhouwei frowned immediately. Li Que'wan continued, "But this cultivator didn't leave... He fought his way into the Yuan family estate, opened their treasury, and took everything out. He then distributed it all to the various small families and clans across the entire Mushroom Forest Plains..."

The Yuan family had ancient origins. Although they hadn't produced a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in many years, they had never truly declined. They had governed the Mushroom Forest Plains for almost as long as the Azure Pond Sect had existed. Their methods were harsh; even the Embyronic Breathing cultivation arts they distributed were divided into six parts based on the six wheels... This new development would likely make those small clans weep with gratitude.

Li Zhouwei mused, "The Yuan family... has seldom cultivated Azure Manifestation in recent years, haven't they."

As soon as he said this, Li Que'wan understood. She nodded. "Exactly. This junior specifically checked. For the past several decades, the Yuan clan... has preferred cultivating the Water Mansion and Pit Water paths."

"No wonder."

Li Zhouwei asked, "So, which member of the Yuan family did this cultivator prop up?"

Li Que'wan knew exactly what he was implying. "The Daoist Master is wise. Although there aren't many Yuan clan members left, this cultivator still supported a member of the main lineage. He returned the clan to him, instructing him to rebuild the clan structure, return to the ancestral Dao, and restore the name of Azure Manifestation. However, they are no longer the masters of the Mushroom Forest Plains, but are instead settled in a prefecture on the plains."

Li Que'wan's gaze was complicated. "This junior believes... it's likely that when the Yuan family's old ancestor failed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, it exposed the clan's intention to find its own path. That's what led to Yuan Zibin, and what led to today."

Li Zhouwei nodded, but his focus was elsewhere, his expression slowly turning strange.

"You're saying the Yuan clan is no longer master of the Mushroom Forest Plains. That means... this person has brazenly... taken the Mushroom Forest Plains, which belongs to the Azure Pond Sect... for himself!"

No matter how you looked at it, the Mushroom Forest Plains was Azure Pond territory. The Yuan clan, regardless of their actions, was still an Azure Pond family. To put it bluntly, they were all private property of the Azure Pond Sect. If this person had acted as a vigilante and left after settling matters, the Azure Pond Sect, being too preoccupied to manage its own affairs, would have had a hard time dealing with him. But this... this had a completely different meaning!

Li Que'wan lowered her head. "Exactly! And currently, there has been no reaction from the mountain."

Li Zhouwei's gaze sharpened. "Does this cultivator have a name?"

The woman before him showed a bitter expression. "His surname is Yang, name Zhuo. He is at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm."

...

The Great Void was pitch black, a bright light streaking through it. A scholar in white robes stood with a broad smile, his face filled with gratitude.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing... if there's anything you need my help with in the future, please just say the word! If nothing else, I have my Auspicious Qi divine ability, which can be useful in many situations!"

The Daoist in pale gold robes repeatedly agreed. The scholar escorted him a long way before finally turning back, leaving the bright light to continue its journey east.

'He's a little too enthusiastic now...'

Li Ximing had just returned from the Xipo Kingdom. Fuxun had only reluctantly departed after escorting him far out over the sea.

After all, that great pill had solved the Demon King's most pressing problem. The Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill was also of excellent quality. Fuxun's desire to befriend him was practically spilling from his face. The last time, it was Qingyan and the others who had delivered it, so they hadn't met. This time, the Demon King had finally caught him.

Li Ximing had passed on the request to search for spiritual materials, but his main purpose was to ask Qingyan about the spell art. He stayed for several extra months and finally got to meet with Qingyan.

The Demon King himself was skilled in blessings and had quite the savings. He was decisive. After just one look at the spell art's outline, he agreed enthusiastically and even offered to trade spiritual materials of the Water Mansion path for it.

But Li Ximing had absolutely no lack of Water Mansion materials right now and was also incredibly busy. He politely stated his own needs and asked the other to acquire those items first, then took his leave.

'Nine Dams of the Azure Ram Mountain is a fifth-grade technique, after all, and Azure Manifestation arts are rare. It's not often you see that fellow so eager. In that case, my family is in no hurry.'

Li Ximing hadn't expected him to be so generous as to offer spiritual materials. He was in high spirits as he left Poluoduo, crossed the Piaoren Kingdom, and headed north.

While he was a guest in Poluoduo, the token he had given to Dingyang Zi began to warm faintly. The artisan-refiner was contacting him as promised.

News about the Heavenly Star Crimson Gold had already been sent once, so there was no need to use a jade talisman again. This almost certainly meant the old man had finally found another buyer.

Li Ximing immediately grew concerned. He had originally planned to cross the Southern Borderlands, pass through the Shu lands to check on the influence of Sword Gate and Xiukui in the Long and Shu regions, and then head south to Qize to finalize the matter. But the further he flew, the more wrong things felt. By the time he was halfway, his expression had changed completely.

Looking out over the entire Wu State, the land below was covered in the light of fires. Dense pinpricks of light spread across nearly every prefecture city beneath his feet. Cultivators were flying up everywhere, battling in mid-air. Severed limbs rained down from time to time, along with various spiritual items, sparking mad scrambles below!

Mortals battled in the prefectures while cultivators engaged in Dharma combat. The four borders were rotting. The lands of several prefectures before him, Mount Changhuai's unchanging backyard for hundreds of years, had become a scene of carnage!

"What has happened to Mount Changhuai?!"

# Chapter 961: Changes

His gaze had only just swept over the endless slaughter below when the disturbance in the Great Void violently intensified. Soft, white light flickered in vast sheets, cascading down like a surging river.

Li Ximing watched silently, estimating to himself. 'That’s the direction of Mount Changhuai.'

But the white light flickered only for a moment. As if drawn by an invisible force, it swiftly condensed back toward its center and vanished, as ephemeral as a flower blooming in the night.

Li Ximing scanned the area again. Nothing seemed out of place, yet his heart pounded in the silent darkness. Not a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had appeared. 'The Wu State cultivators… where have they all gone?'

He had no choice but to return to the mortal world. Riding the wind, he swept his gaze across the land below. He still found no cultivators in Mount Changhuai attire. He continued his search, shaking his head inwardly.

The grand array below flickered erratically, appearing incredibly fragile amidst the fires. Groups of cultivators were in the air, raising their dharma artifacts and smashing them down upon the barrier, unleashing wave after wave of thunderous explosions.

He was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, after all. Though he knew little of Wu State, he could sense the fluctuations in the spiritual tides and the surge of baleful energy. He quickly formed a hypothesis. "It’s related to the earth veins... It seems to be a violent shift in the earth veins, causing the baleful energy to surge. That’s the only reason the array would react this way. Any ordinary formation would have shattered by now."

He saw clearly that while the crowd of lesser Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining cultivators scrambled and fought over spoils, a single late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm youth was concealed in the air using spell arts, apparently observing something with great care.

Li Ximing casually crooked a finger. Silken threads of Heavenly Light poured down. The youth, caught in a daze, instantly lost his bearings. The Heavenly Light guided him directly before Li Ximing.

When the youth saw the radiant divine ability, how could he not realize he had been summoned by a Daoist Master? His body trembled, and he bowed with deep respect. "Junior pays his respects to Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing noted that the young man showed little fear, mostly apprehension and caution. His reaction was swift; this clearly wasn’t his first time witnessing a divine ability. 'He has a powerful background,' Li Ximing concluded.

He asked coolly, "Which family do you belong to?"

The young man bowed politely. "Junior is Li Nitan, of the Tanshan Li Clan from Wu State. I was assigned by my clan to observe the situation in the Shu region. I never expected to encounter a Daoist Master. Please forgive me for failing to pay proper respects."

'So, the Tanshan Li Clan!'

Wu State was different from Yue State. When the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition carved up Yue State, it left behind only a few territories, controlling them through its influence. Many of the rules still in place were those established by the Immortal Mansion long ago.

Most of Wu State, however, lay under the shadow of Mount Changhuai's power. Apart from the first four sects to submit, nearly every power that rose later had inextricable ties to Mount Changhuai, or had originated from it directly. Over time, nine Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had emerged from this system, establishing what were commonly known as the Nine Surnames of Wu State.

The Tanshan Li Clan was one of them.

Li Ximing understood immediately.

Mount Changhuai styled itself as the "Changhuai Dao," and its rule was strict. Its Purple Mansion Realm cultivators kept to themselves and rarely communicated with the outside world. In return, Mount Changhuai was fiercely protective of these de facto vassals. With such protection, coupled with the fact that the Tanshan Li Clan's own Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was alive, in his prime, and had successors, they truly had little reason to fear any Daoist Master looking for trouble.

But despite their strength, the Tanshan Li Clan had always referred to themselves as a local Li family, and they naturally never dared to cross the Bright Yang Wei-Li. Li Ximing smiled faintly. "We share a family name, it seems."

Li Nitan was no fool. Seeing the Bright Yang divine ability radiating from the man before him, his words struck with full force.

A cold sweat broke out on his back.

"So it is Daoist Master Zhaojing himself!" he said respectfully.

"We are indeed of the same family. My clan was overjoyed to hear of the Daoist Master's ascension... It is just a pity that the Changhuai decree forbids us from freely associating with outside clans..."

"Enough." Li Ximing had no patience for this. He had only grabbed someone for information; he couldn't care less about the Tanshan clan's politics.

"I am just passing through. Tell me what happened here."

Li Nitan replied quickly, "Reporting to Daoist Master, this junior was also just disturbed from his estate and does not know the cause... I only see that the fighting in the prefecture began because of the shift in the earth veins and spiritual tides. The formations protecting many families, markets, and even pill pavilions and cave estates all failed simultaneously."

"How could ordinary folk resist such a temptation? They immediately began to loot, smash, and fight. Amidst the chaos, several of the prefectures's established clans have also become entangled. It appears to be a wave of annexations!"

This was precisely what puzzled Li Ximing. Normally, suppressing local aristocratic families and forbidding such annexations was standard policy for most major sects.

"What about the Changhuai prohibition?" he asked.

Li Nitan smiled bitterly. "Reporting to Daoist Master, ever since Great Daoist Master Pingwen fell, the mountain has been hoping for more Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to emerge. They lifted the prohibitions. Now, many of the restrictions only apply to the Nine Surnames. With chaos erupting, the entire region is in turmoil, and the old order is changing."

'Hoping for more Purple Mansion Realm cultivators?' Li Ximing mulled over the words. Something felt wrong. But as for the true cause of this upheaval, Li Nitan was unlikely to speak freely even if he knew. Li Ximing simply released him, pierced back into the Great Void, and vanished.

Although Li Nitan had appeared calm, he had been facing a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and his heart was still unsettled. As he silently rode the wind back down, the cold sweat finally stopped. 'To think I'd run into the Moongaze Li Clan of all people!'

The Tanshan Li Clan's foundation wasn't deep. Their ancestor, Daoist Master Tanfu, had originally been a Mount Changhuai cultivator who only attained the Dao after receiving guidance from Daoist Master Pingwen. After leaving the mountain, the one thing their clan feared most was any entanglement with the Wei-Li!

Wu State had indeed seen nine Purple Mansion Realm clans established, but with cultivators falling over the years, some of those "Nine Surnames" were now just empty titles. His own ancestor had been in seclusion for many years, never leaving. He was one of the more powerful cultivators among the Nine Surnames, but his age was great. Now, with his grandfather Li Muyan's ascension, the clan had risen to the second-strongest position. They were in an era of prosperity; how could they risk provoking such trouble?

'Is it really a coincidence? Or is some other family trying to set us up!' He rushed back to his estate. With a few quick palm strikes, he obliterated several demonic cultivators who had been lurking by the mountain, and then immediately took to the air, hurrying to send a report back to his clan.

---

Sun-Worshipping Mountain.

Li Ximing descended on a beam of light and found the mountain relatively peaceful. Dingyang Zi's apprentices recognized him and hurried over to pay their respects.

Once in Qize, the chaos of Wu State seemed more distant. This area, unlike the densely populated prefectures, was mostly wild mountains and great marshes. With several rogue Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in residence, large-scale conflict was rare.

Although Dingyang Zi was seated by his furnace, chanting and forming seals to control the spiritual flames, Li Ximing could tell from his expression that his mood was foul. In fact, he looked downright grim.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing returned the greeting. His mind was still heavy with questions, so he didn't even ask about the spiritual resources he had come for. Instead, he immediately raised the issue of Wu State. "I saw a vast expanse of white light in the Great Void, in the direction of Mount Changhuai. On my way here, I found all of Wu State has fallen into chaos. Do you know what has happened?"

Hearing this, Dingyang Zi let out a heavy sigh. He turned away from the fire, invited Li Ximing to sit with him in the pavilion, and poured him some tea. He shook his head. "The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel has shattered."

Seeing Li Ximing's confused look, Dingyang Zi said softly, "Do you know Daoist Master Pingwen? Or, to put it another way... have you heard of Qing Tangyin?"

Li Ximing stroked his beard. "Qing Tangyin... He was a Great Daoist Master of Mount Changhuai."

Li Ximing had indeed heard the name. Right after his breakthrough, when he had gone to the Azure Pond Sect to visit Yuanxiu, he had been present when this same Great Daoist Master fell, causing a massive shift in the spiritual atmosphere.

Dingyang Zi nodded, his expression complex. "Pingwen was his Daoist title. He was born in the Ji State and adventured there in his early years, so he was never well-known in Jiangnan. The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel was his personal treasure."

"Oh?"

"The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel is a Spiritual Artifact, but it's no ordinary one. It was cultivated through a specific Dao Lineage, and it's even rumored to be connected to True Monarch Tianwu. It is incredibly potent. He was renowned for it..."

As he spoke, Dingyang Zi's expression turned odd. "He was a capable man in all respects, save one: his miserliness. He was infamous for it among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

He shook his head. "Let me give you an example... He had an heir, Qing Jifang, who was also a real piece of work. Before he even reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he was out causing trouble, getting into a rivalry with Touba Lan. When Touba Lan came to visit their Daoist tradition as a guest, Qing Jifang announced he wanted to take out the treasure to show it off..."

"At the time... I and several other Daoist Masters were present, helping Daoist Master Pingwen examine a spirit embryo. We all saw the young master come and ask..."

Li Ximing sensed this story was taking a turn. Dingyang Zi continued slowly, "Daoist Master Pingwen just said, 'This is an artifact of True Martial. I obtained it through my own destiny. What does it have to do with you? What is there to see?'"

The old man gave a sarcastic smile. "Qing Jifang was defiant. He actually dared to mutter under his breath, 'There will come a day when I can look at it!'"

"Oho!" That was an audacious thing to say. Ximing was stunned speechless for a moment. He didn't know how to respond, so he just shook his head with a private, wry smile. "Well, Senior Pingwen did have that son late in life, and only with the help of the precious Radiant Profound Origin. A little spoiling is to be expected..."

Li Ximing had only heard this secret from the Cui family when he was asking about Radiant Profound Origin. Dingyang Zi seemed surprised that he knew of it and paused for a second before continuing, "Daoist Master Pingwen was not a forgiving man. He summoned his son and said, 'Then watch.'"

"The Daoist Master immediately retrieved the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel. He used a profound divine ability to lock it within the Great Void, integrating it with the sect's grand array. He transformed it into a unique type of Spiritual Artifact, one that could never again be removed."

Li Ximing hid a smile. But Dingyang Zi said, "But as I said before, this was not a man who would accept a loss!"

"At first, everyone just treated it as a joke. But as time went on, the cultivators of Mount Changhuai continuously refined and inscribed upon it. The artifact began to spread its power through the Great Void, linking with Mount Changhuai's grand array. It then extended downward, flowing along the earth veins to regulate the spiritual tides and spirit veins of the entire region, secretly bringing them all into profound unity."

"The artifact became a treasure linked to his personal cultivation. He may not have controlled all the spiritual tides and earth veins shifts in the land, but he could influence at least fifty or sixty percent of them. More importantly, it placed a shackle on every power, large and small, under his rule..."

Li Ximing nodded silently, but Dingyang Zi laughed without restraint. "The Daoist Masters of Qize have a running joke: cultivating in Wu State, not only must you pay your tribute, but if you absorb too much Spiritual Qi... you have to pay Daoist Master Pingwen an extra spirit stone!"

Li Ximing sighed inwardly. 'What a pair, that father and son...'

Dingyang Zi's smile faded, his expression growing calm once more as he returned to the point. "And now, that Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel has been shattered."

"Mount Changhuai spent all those years regulating the spirit veins and laying down array nodes, painstakingly building this supreme method for controlling all of Wu State. With the shattering of that artifact, all that effort has dissolved into clouds of True Qi!"

Li Ximing frowned, the pieces clicking into place. 'No wonder the spiritual tides shifted and the Baleful Earth erupted...' He spoke aloud, "This will certainly be a headache for Mount Changhuai."

"Haha!" Dingyang Zi shook his head, a strange look on his old face. "The ones with the headache are the Nine Surnames! After Mount Changhuai lifted the prohibitions, there were very few annexations. That just proves the lands had already been carved up by the deeply entrenched, allied Nine Surnames. Now that this has happened... who knows who will come out on top!"

Li Ximing still felt something wasn't right. He nodded outwardly, but his mind was racing. 'What kind of Daoist tradition is Mount Changhuai? It's one where a True Monarch has manifested! If they truly didn't want the territories in the hands of powerful clans, why would they have spent centuries fostering the Nine Surnames? Giving the prefecture to them was almost certainly a deliberate, long-term arrangement. This sudden upheaval... they must be plotting something.'

'In this day and age... not a single great power is content to stay still.'

He set the topic aside and asked, "Daoist Friend, the reason you invited me here this time was..."

Dingyang Zi calmly averted his gaze. He retrieved two jade boxes from his sleeve, placed them gently on the table, and said in a low voice, "Daoist Friend, please see for yourself."

Li Ximing used a divine ability to open the first box. Inside lay a crimson-gold stone, about the size of a fingernail. Its edges shimmered with a bright white light, and a dense aura of Li Fire qi washed over him, coalescing into the phantom shapes of various birds around the box.

Heavenly Star Crimson Gold.

Dingyang Zi said slowly, "This is half a portion of Heavenly Star Crimson Gold. Daoist Master Luo acquired it."

He set that box aside and opened the second. A brilliant light burst forth. Inside was a pool of liquid like a white ocean, faintly refracting multicolored light. The moment it was exposed, however, the light quickly retracted into itself.

"This one is a 'Wandering Metal,' the Huakan Golden Essence."

"'Wandering Metal'? That is rare in Jiangnan," Li Ximing remarked.

Dingyang Zi placed a hand on the jade box, his expression turning serious. "I am acting on another's behalf, so I must be very clear about this transaction."

"This Heavenly Star Crimson Gold is a high-grade spiritual resource, and Li Fire materials are always in demand. This item is considered excellent even among Li Fire resources, as it has many uses. Your Marvelous Wisdom Whisker, while also rare, was only sufficient to trade for this half-portion. In truth, he only had this half-portion to begin with."

Li Ximing understood perfectly well how much "padding" was in the phrase "while also rare." A spiritual resource derived from a spiritual plant simply couldn't compare to a pure elemental metal like this. From a theoretical standpoint, among the Five Virtues, Wood was the weakest. Spiritual fruits and whiskers were almost always inferior to materials of a flourishing virtue like Li Fire.

He shook his head and replied, "To get even half a portion is an excellent outcome."

"Good," Dingyang Zi acknowledged with a smile. "As for this Huakan Golden Essence, it can wash away aberrant light, conceal one's traces, and even help shed karmic ties. It is a rare treasure. It is said that while Geng-Dui is variable, Wandering Metal is balanced. It forms only after being buried deep in the earth, hidden from the world for six hundred years. Very little of it circulates."

"Most importantly, Wandering Metal does not conflict with your Bright Yang attributes. It's often called the 'metal of carefree nurturing' or the 'metal of no cause and no effect.' It can be added to most Spiritual Artifacts without conflict."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. His family had encountered a descendant of the Wandering Metal True Monarch—the man known as the Sword Immortal King—so he had a profound appreciation for this "carefree nurturing." He smiled. "And this is from...?"

Dingyang Zi smiled. "Daoist Master Junjian came to my little mountain a few months ago, seeking to trade for something. When he heard I was in contact with you, he was delighted and left this item specifically, instructing me to trade it to you."

"What!" It was the first time in many years that Li Ximing had heard the name Tu Longjian. This was the Daoist Master who had once called Li Yuanjiao his benefactor, but who had, in the end, become the Li family's benefactor instead. He shot to his feet, excited. "Has Senior Tu Long returned to the sect?!"

Dingyang Zi shook his head. "He is currently in the Northern Sea seeking an item. He came to me looking for a spiritual resource of 'Cold Qi'—Cold Cloud Heart-Iron—which he needs to forge a Spiritual Sword."

"Cold Cloud Heart-Iron?" Li Ximing was puzzled. "I don't understand. Why would he forge a Cold Qi Spiritual Sword? Firstly, he doesn't use a sword. And secondly... his Molten Fire Dao is one of the very things that counters Cold Qi..."

Dingyang Zi smiled, shook his head, and sipped his tea. "That's where you're mistaken. The Slaughter Jun Gate originally cultivated cold baleful energy. He naturally wishes to revive his sect's Dao Lineage. I hear he has a junior he values greatly, one who cultivates Cold Qi. About ten years ago, that junior went into seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Tu Longjian is just preparing for a rainy day."

"I see," Li Ximing said thoughtfully. "It must be for that Gao Xuanzi..."

Dingyang Zi replied, "I have no idea who... I just recall he was smiling and said something about... it being your job to find it."

"But of course!" Li Ximing nodded with a smile. "After all, Ning Wan cultivates Cold Qi, so she has plenty of connections. Plus, Tianwan is in the Eastern Sea. Senior Tu Longjian doesn't want to get involved in any trouble, especially given his past unpleasantness with Tianwan. This is a task for me. I'll ask a few Daoist friends to see to it."

"Excellent!" Dingyang Zi agreed at once, his mood clearly improved. He raised a hand, took out another box, and smiled. "As for this Cangzhou Serpent Scale..."

"Leave it to me!" Li Ximing agreed readily, wishing Dingyang Zi had even more to offer. He was suddenly reminded of the other Cangzhou Serpent Scale he had already acquired, and felt an awkward twinge. 'I can't very well take that one out now. The Pit Water attribute is useless to me; trading it to him for other spiritual resources would have been a good idea... Well, since I have it, I'll just use it to trade for the Cold Cloud Heart-Iron.'

Having accepted the task, his thoughts turned. He retrieved a small, glazed bottle from his sleeve. Inside, a gray, hazy substance drifted uncertainly.

This was something Kong Guxi had brought to the Li Clan back during the fall of Profound Peak. It was rumored to be the scales of a Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast, but no one had ever identified it. All they knew was that it was a Pit Water item, and thus, useless to them.

Since he was coming to Sun-Worshipping Mountain this time, he recalled that the medicinal pills Dingyang Zi himself consumed were of the Pit Water attribute. And Pit Water itself was closely related to the Upper Shaman path. He had specially brought the item to let the old man examine it.

Dingyang Zi picked up the glazed bottle. After a careful look, his expression turned to one of shock. He studied it for a long moment, a fiery heat rising in his eyes. "Daoist Friend," he said, his voice tense, "where did you obtain this?"

Li Ximing had no idea where Changxi had scrounged it up, so he offered a vague excuse.

Dingyang Zi said in admiration, "This is Heart-Armor of the Yù-Beast. It's as fine as dust, and they are indeed scales... but this item is profound and special. It absolutely must not be used to forge a Spiritual Artifact."

"Oh?" Li Ximing was intrigued.

Dingyang Zi continued, "There isn't much of it, but its quality and origin are extraordinarily high, rarely seen in this day and age. I've heard it's meant to be consumed. You must preserve it well. When you find the right time to use a spiritual item of this caliber, it will surely be for a monumental purpose."

Li Ximing had never held high expectations for the items left behind by Daoist Master Changxi. Hearing such a lofty evaluation, he was inwardly shocked. 'Is it really that valuable? No wonder Changxi never used it, even at his death... That old man was more complex than he appeared. He collected quite a few treasures over the years, to say nothing of that demonic embryo...'

'I should ask Senior Chuting about this as well.'

He offered his thanks. After these transactions, his trust in Dingyang Zi had grown considerably. He took out the piece of Blameless Spirit Wood from Chen Yin and handed it over. After a quick calculation, he said, "Senior Chen traded this to me. I hear it's used for making sword hilts, which I have no use for. I'll entrust it to you. If Senior Tu Longjian can use it, please give it to him. If not, perhaps you could trade it to someone else on my behalf."

Tu Longjian had avoided meeting his family several times now. Li Ximing understood that he had his reservations. Perhaps it was because of Li Zhouwei, or perhaps there was some other reason that made a meeting inconvenient.

But judging by his willingness to provide spiritual resources, his heart was still with their family. Li Ximing decided not to cause him any more trouble. Asking Dingyang Zi to be the intermediary was killing two birds with one stone.

After settling matters with Dingyang Zi, he summoned his light and flew straight for the Eastern Sea.

---

Xuanmiao Temple.

The ancient, simple pavilion stood quietly in the mountain forest, dotted with pale golden lamplight that gave it an elegant air.

Years of repeated warfare had ravaged Jiangbei, transforming the landscape. Forget pavilions, few of the original mountain forests even remained. Yet Xuanmiao Temple had escaped disaster time and again. The pavilion Sumian had personally built all those years ago still stood.

A young man in a tall white-gauze cap and black robes embroidered with mystic clouds sat on the steps. He held two or three bone tablets in his hand, tapping them together with a crisp, clear sound. The door behind him was tightly shut. He smiled. "Daoist Friend Murong has arrived."

The Great Void tore open, and a portly man stepped out. His complexion was rather unsightly. With his hands clasped behind his back, he nodded. "Lord Qi, you seem truly at ease."

Seeing Murong Yan safe and sound, a flash of disappointment crossed Qi Lanyan's heart. He smiled. "Naturally, I cannot compare to Daoist Friend Murong. While you were fighting in Jiangbei, you had a crowd of cultivators to protect you. How could that compare to my lonely vigil here at Xuanmiao Temple?"

Murong Yan heard the sarcasm but merely laughed instead of growing angry. "I was indeed injured," he replied. "Otherwise, I would not have waited so long to seek out Lord Qi."

Murong Yan understood perfectly. Xindu had been the sacrifice in that battle. He himself was never in any real danger. Qi Lanyan's mention of a "crowd of cultivators" was not an exaggeration, even if they hadn't been there to protect him specifically.

He, Murong Yan, knew that many of the higher-ups coveted Wanling Heaven. He even knew that Xindu, with his Floating Cloud Body, would never meet a good end. But he had miscalculated one crucial point: he never expected that day to come so soon.

Even though he himself was unharmed, he felt a profound sense of crisis. He had been kept completely in the dark about Xindu. That was enough.

After retreating from the river, he had sent several letters back to his clan. But the very same lords who had sworn oaths and guaranteed his safety had all fallen silent. They merely offered placating words, urging him to focus on seizing treasures within Wanling Heaven.

'Those bastards sitting high and mighty in the Buddhist Land... they couldn't possibly have been ignorant of Xindu's fate. This was all deliberate. They deliberately kept me in the dark!'

Murong Yan was almost certain that not long after he left the Yan State, a drastic and silent shift in policy had occurred. It was a shift that excluded him—and might even be designed to get him killed.

A deep shadow passed through his seemingly dull eyes as suspicion solidified in his heart. 'I am walking on thin ice.'




# Chapter 962: Mushroom Forest Plains

Qi Lanyan idly tossed a small bone fragment in his hand. He looked up, a smile playing on his lips. "Well now, Daoist Murong... what brings you here?"

Murong Yan stood stiffly in the courtyard, his expression dark.

Those figures in the Buddhist Land were definitely plotting something, using him—Murong Yan—as their pawn. But this smiling Qi Lanyan was no better!

'Those old fools in the Buddhist Land want to use me as a shield. But I am a Murong. Even if I'm not from the imperial line, I'm still a direct descendant. The worst they can do is exploit me, or perhaps force me into their Buddhist Land... But Qi Lanyan? That bastard genuinely wants me dead!'

The Murong clan and Viewing Pavilion had never seen eye to eye; their animosity wasn't new. When the Great Liang collapsed and warlords rose, the Qi family was crushed by the Murong clan. The Qi ancestor, Qi Wang, was even captured by Murong Dechang and forced into a lifetime of service... The Qi clan had always prided itself as a noble family of Yincheng, enfeoffed by the Zhou dynasty. With their supposedly highborn blood, they already looked down on 'outer barbarians'—how could they possibly stomach such a humiliation!

Back then, the entire Qi family swore an oath in blood and tears, dedicating themselves to becoming the mortal enemies of the "Murong barbarians." With the passage of time and the Murong's rise to power, things had calmed down on the surface. The Qi family kept quiet. But who knew what they truly thought in their hearts?

Murong Yan knew this encounter was trouble the moment he saw him. Today, it was clearer than ever. Even though his own backing was unstable, bowing his head to Qi Lanyan would only lead to humiliation.

His expression turned cold. "Naturally," he said flatly, "I am here to await Lord Qi's instructions."

Qi Lanyan stood up with a pleasant smile, appearing perfectly courteous.

"Instructions? There are no instructions. I only ask that Daoist Murong station your forces outside the mountain. Once there's a result from the Grotto-Heaven, we will invite you all to enter... Oh, right. And Lord Gao... is he willing to come in? I just fear that if a conflict arises with the Li clan, it might... dampen his spirits!"

Shilou Yingge had always insisted his surname was Shilou. Qi Lanyan was just playing dumb, deliberately calling him 'Gao'. His smile was blatant mockery. Murong Yan replied coldly, "Daoist Shilou always follows your arrangements. I have no idea who this 'Lord Gao' is. As for Touba..."

"Enough!"

He had barely uttered the name 'Touba' when a clear, cold voice drifted from the hall doors behind Qi Lanyan, cutting him off sharply.

A cold sweat instantly beaded on Murong Yan's brow. He scrambled to bow toward the hall. "I did not realize Lord Wei was present!"

Murong Yan didn't need to look to know that Qi Lanyan was sneering behind his back.

The hall doors opened softly, and a voice summoned him. Murong Yan hurried forward. Sure enough, a man in white robes stood within the hall. He was holding a small box, seemingly admiring its contents, his face bathed in a faint, golden glow.

Seeing him enter, Wei Xuanyin set the box down and said formally, "You have endured much, Daoist Murong."

Murong Yan merely shook his head cautiously.

Wei Xuanyin glanced at him. "I had assumed the Yan Kingdom would manage this," he said casually, "and I did not wish to disturb the plans of the Great Virtues. I did not expect this... misunderstanding. Perhaps the news was delayed, which caused you alarm, Daoist Murong."

What could Murong Yan say to such a direct question? Complain about his own backers in the Buddhist Land and expose his own weakness? He could only swallow his bitterness and force a smile. "The Buddhist Land did provide some guidance... It was my own fault. I was too eager and misinterpreted their intentions!"

It was impossible to tell if Wei Xuanyin believed him. He simply nodded.

"Both our sides lost many good subordinates this time. Once we are inside the Grotto-Heaven, we can certainly support one another and recoup our losses... In a few days, the Lord of the White Victory Dao will arrive. He will stop first at Luoxia. The proper welcoming ceremonies are, of course, essential. We are not well-versed in such etiquette, so we must ask Daoist Murong to handle the reception."

"Yes..." Murong Yan agreed in a low voice, his heart pounding. Wei Xuanyin's words sounded pleasant, but they gave him no comfort.

'The Viewing Pavilion faction may be Luoxia's lapdogs now, but Qi Lanyan cultivates the Horn Wood Dao and Wei Xuanyin cultivates the Veiled Yin Dao. Neither path is related to the Luoxia orthodoxy, and they certainly don't share Luoxia's tolerance or magnanimity toward immortal cultivators...'

He wasn't as guarded against Wei Xuanyin as he was Qi Lanyan, but he felt no particular goodwill either. He forced a smile. "I will follow your instructions, my lord. However, I've heard that Daoist Friend Zong Chang and Daoist Friend Gongsun have already reached Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain. They should be arriving soon..."

With Wei Xuanyin present, any thought Murong Yan had of negotiating with Qi Lanyan or pressuring the Yan Kingdom evaporated. He could only retreat, frustrated and empty-handed.

Qi Lanyan didn't even lift his gaze. Only after Murong Yan was gone did his smile vanish.

"Murong Yan really was completely in the dark. Those 'compassionate visages' in the Buddhist Land are truly ruthless. Compassion is one thing, but a Murong is another... Still, I suppose it makes sense."

Wei Xuanyin shook his head, looking displeased. "You acted too rashly in this matter."

Seeing Qi Lanyan's confusion, he continued in a low voice, "Do you know why Murong Yan faced this calamity?"

"There has been no word from Lord Xue, and the Mountain offers no protection. The longer this drags on, the more suspicious the northern powers become. They are starting to grow covetous of Li Zhouwei..."

"The Way of Compassion is no different. With the precedent of the Undefeated King of Brightness, and seeing the Mountain's continued silence, how could they not feel greedy for the White Qilin? Li Zhouwei isn't easy to convert, but if they could _kill_ him and forge a great karmic bond, the benefits would be no less than swallowing the Yan Kingdom."

"So, they started scheming. They ignored Murong Yan, hoping he would meet with disaster. They want this karmic entanglement to grow, hoping it will eventually be big enough to drag the entire Way of Compassion into the conflict."

"But Murong Yan is a true seeker of immortality—otherwise he wouldn't have so firmly chosen the Valley Water path. He covets a Golden Attainment and feels ashamed to be confined to a mere Buddhist Attainment. He would only consider becoming one of the Buddhist cultivators as an absolute last resort. Why would he willingly become their sacrifice? That's why he was cut off from all information."

Qi Lanyan fell silent. Wei Xuanyin continued softly, "But the Mountain's stance remains unclear, and the Way of Compassion is obviously hesitant. Murong Yan, after all, is exceptionally talented. Li Zhouwei, on the other hand, could be a fool's errand—a total loss. They want Murong Yan injured and resentful, a variable they can use to enter the game at the right moment. But they don't want him dead. That's why they behaved so contradictorily, cutting off his information while simultaneously protecting him in the Great Void."

Understanding dawned on Qi Lanyan. Wei Xuanyin continued faintly,

"Unfortunately for them, someone tipped their hand—perhaps to deliberately spite the Way of Compassion. Or perhaps that White Qilin's golden eyes are just that formidable. He must have sensed the figures in the Great Void. He held back, never unleashing his True Fire. The gambit failed, and now Murong Yan is on high alert. He's unlikely to stick his neck out like that again."

Qi Lanyan was silent for a long time before asking, "Martial Uncle... what are your thoughts?"

But Wei Xuanyin simply lowered his gaze, saying nothing. After a long moment, he finally lifted his writing brush, his eyes still fixed on the desk. "The Way of Compassion wasn't the first to have such ideas," he said quietly, "and they won't be the last. We wait."

He rolled up the scroll from his desk, tucked it into his sleeve, and picked up the small box. It immediately bathed the room in a pale golden light. Qi Lanyan glanced over. Inside, a small seal, perhaps two fingers wide, was set into a base, its side just visible.

Wei Xuanyin shook his head and smiled. "I'm going to the Eastern Sea... to see an old friend."

...

The sky brightened as the Morning Glow spread across the horizon. A vast, vibrant plain stretched out, following the fertile banks of a small stream. Soon, several streaks of magical light sped into view.

The young man in the lead had a noble and refined bearing. He wore an elegant feathered robe with a jade belt at his waist, clearly the scion of a wealthy or powerful family. He rode a silver-scaled steed that shimmered with a brilliant light.

The young woman beside him was dressed in a simple white skirt, yet the fabric itself seemed to glow faintly. Her features were clear and beautiful, and she carried an ethereal, otherworldly air.

The young man smiled faintly and gestured to the lands before them. "Tianyou, this is Fengxiang Prefecture, part of the Mushroom Forest Plains. It's a treasured land with unique scenery..."

"Oh?" The young woman glanced at him with a smile. "Have you been here before, Brother Liang?"

Li Jiangliang laughed. "I rested here once during my travels south. A companion told me about this place. It used to be occupied by the Eastern Yue, who worshipped a great elephant. Later, a cultivator named Yuan Chengdun wiped them out and seized their dharma artifact. He settled in this prefecture, and it's been named for that event ever since."

Yang Tianyou said softly, "So, it was him."

The two stopped within the prefecture city, and a crowd of people immediately rushed forward, bowing obsequiously. "Young Master!"

The young man waved his hand dismissively, his brow furrowed. "Who is in charge here?"

The crowd immediately prostrated themselves, a ripple of fear passing through them. After much shuffling and pushing, a middle-aged man was finally forced to step forward.

The man's hair was mostly gray, giving him an aged look. Though his features had a trace of nobility, he was missing one eye and his beard was unkempt. He stumbled forward and bowed deeply.

He was visibly terrified. He shuffled forward to take the reins of Li Jiangliang's horse, bowing his body humbly to the side. "This... this lowly one greets the Young Master," he stammered.

Li Jiangliang glanced at him and smiled. "Which family do you belong to? Your cultivation isn't bad. You can show us around."

The man dropped to his knees with a thud. "This lowly one is no more than a slave! I fear my words would only soil your honorable ears!"

Li Jiangliang's smile didn't waver. "Speak. You have my permission."

A stir went through the crowd; all eyes turned to the man. He bowed his head even lower, revealing the gaunt, protruding vertebrae of his neck. "This lowly one... is... Yuan Fuyao," he trembled.

"Oh!" Li Jiangliang gave his steed a light kick. The silver-scaled spirit-beast snorted, yanking the reins from the man's grasp. "What a coincidence!" Li Jiangliang laughed.

He swung off his horse as he spoke. Another man, this one with a full head of white hair, hurried from the crowd. He shoved Yuan Fuyao aside, pulling him back, his own face wreathed in a subservient smile. "This lowly one is Ding Xiding! I greet the Young Master!"

Though the old man's hair was white, his eyebrows were thick and his expression was hearty. He seemed incredibly excited. "My lord... my lord... this way, please!"

Yang Tianyou likewise dismounted from her Spirit Beast, and the two walked forward, immediately surrounded by the bustling crowd. One of Li Jiangliang's attendants, who seemed to know Ding Xiding, chuckled. "Old man Ding! I remember you bragging about how you and the great Lord Celestial Moon Sword were sworn brothers. What's wrong? Now that his family is here in front of you, you've gone mute?"

The old man's face flushed crimson. His thick eyebrows shot up, but the boasts that had once come so easily now stuck in his throat. All he could do was stammer, "Back then... I... I did see him..."

Li Jiangliang smiled. "I know... the Ding family. You once had a presence by the lake, bordering the An clan's territory."

At these words, Ding Xiding's eyes filled with tears, and he nodded frantically. "The Young Master is incredible! So well-read in history, to remember such an old affair... This lowly one is endlessly grateful!"

Back when Li Tongya first achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had been filled with sighs and jealousy, refusing to speak of it. But as Li Tongya's fame spread and the Li family produced more and more Foundation Establishment cultivators, he gradually began to brag about his connection. By the time the Li family had a Purple Mansion Realm expert, Ding Xiding dared not speak of it at all.

Now, to be mentioned by a junior of that great man's family, he felt so honored that he wept on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yuan Fuyao—the man he had once fawned over, calling him "Young Master" at every breath—was cast aside like rubbish, standing alone and shrinking in on himself.

The crowd escorted them into the prefecture's main hall. Li Jiangliang gave a wave of his hand, and they all dispersed like the wind.

Yang Tianyou smiled. "This place is too close to Moongaze Lake. Everyone knows of the Li family, and all the local gossip revolves around the lake. I'm afraid everyone knows about Yuan Fuyao's little story."

Li Jiangliang shook his head with a laugh. "There's no need to give him a hard time. We still need to win the people's hearts, after all. Your brother just finished settling the Yuan clan; it wouldn't look good for me to cause trouble now... Besides... I rather think I should thank him."

Yang Tianyou clearly knew what he meant and shook her head, amused. She and Li Jiangliang wandered through the prefecture for a while, observing their surroundings.

"We still need to deal with the small local clans," he said in a low voice.

"That part is easy. The problem is, we have too few of our own people. And it's not like every one of them is a standout. Once we spread them across the vast Mushroom Forest Plains, it will be even more of a problem..."

Yang Tianyou looked helpless. She frowned, a simple expression that her beauty made all the more charming. "My family is small... I've brought everyone I could. Our other territories are also busy; I can't just leave everyone in this one place..."

Her tone shifted as a hopeful look entered her eyes. "But there are so many cultivators back at the lake, and all of them are capable. Could you... borrow a few reliable people from your family? They don't need to be at the Foundation Establishment Realm. A few at the Qi Refining level would be enough. What we're missing are people we can trust."

Li Jiangliang instantly looked awkward.

He truly didn't want to ask for people from the lake. It wasn't that he thought they'd refuse—his cousin Li Que'wan, who managed clan affairs, and his second brother, Li Jianglong, would certainly help him. But all his siblings were contributing to the family. He wasn't just failing to contribute; he was now asking the family for a handout! Worse, it wasn't even for his own cultivation; it was a favor for someone else. The situation was mortifying.

"Well..." he stammered.

He was silently trying to figure out how to respond when he looked up. They had reached the prefecture's bustling market square. As his eyes swept casually over the noisy crowd, the jade talisman at his waist suddenly grew warm. His expression froze, his features warring with a mixture of disbelief and delight.

Li Jiangliang's gaze shot through the crowd. There, standing by a stall with his hands clasped behind his back, was a man in crimson robes. He was tall and slender, with striking features that gave him an exceptional air, setting him apart from the crowd. His eyes, though smiling, were set close to his brows, giving him a venomous look. They were slightly narrowed, and his pupils... his pupils were a brilliant, glittering gold.

The man seemed to turn his head casually, and flashed him a radiant smile.

Li Jiangliang turned to look at Yang Tianyou, who was still watching him with that hopeful, smiling expression. His heart sank. He sighed.

"You'er... come and meet my Eldest Brother."

(End of this chapter)




# Chapter 963: Yang Zhuo

Deep down, Li Jiangliang felt awkward and more than a little cautious.

This elder brother of his... he had truly enjoyed every privilege. As the eldest son of Bright Yang, he wasn't just sent to the island at birth and groomed as the heir in all things; his treatment and cultivation had surpassed his peers his entire life.

His cultivation level didn't matter so much, but it was this treatment that left his other brothers feeling helpless.

Li Jiangliang knew perfectly well that his second and third brothers both possessed considerable talent and spirit. In any other family, they would have been outstanding leaders in their own right.

In fact, from Li Jiangliang's own interactions over the years, he felt his eldest brother, Li Jiangqian, was too cold and ruthless. His second brother, Li Jianglong, was more earnest, and his third brother, Li Jiangxia, was more genuine. True, Moongaze Lake had thrived and become a model of order under Li Jiangqian's governance, but any of his brothers could have done just as well. Yet, whenever they were in Li Jiangqian's presence, they were inexplicably diminished, as if they were a level below him—and it was about more than just his status as the first-born son.

Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing, was their family's first Daoist Master. Every time he emerged from seclusion, he would summon either Li Jiangqian or Ding Weizeng. Li Jiangliang and the others appeared prominent, but the number of times they were granted an audience with the Daoist Master, or even their own father, was negligible. All the other brothers' visits combined probably didn't add up to Li Jiangqian's alone. This was the true foundation of his unique status.

Li Jiangliang couldn't help his complex feelings. He bowed and said with a sigh,

"Congratulations, Elder Brother, on your great advance in cultivation!"

His spiritual sense registered it clearly: the Li Jiangqian before him had already reached the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm.

'He's probably... a strong contender to be the next to reach the Purple Mansion Realm...'

His heart was a tangle of emotions, but the crimson-robed man before him was all smiles, his presence as refreshing as a spring breeze. He walked up, nodded to Yang Tianyou, and chuckled.

"I just emerged from seclusion and heard you were in the Mushroom Forest Plains, Fourth Brother, so I stopped by... This must be your wife. She is as lovely as rumored!"

Yang Tianyou smiled but said nothing. Li Jiangliang wore a helpless expression.

"I had no intention of disturbing you, Elder Brother. But all of us brothers were born with these golden pupils; our identity is obvious wherever we go. News travels fast, reaching Moongaze Lake in an instant."

Li Jiangqian started walking back with him, shaking his head.

"It's unavoidable. Although the relationship between the Yuan Clan and our family has faded, they are, after all, the clan of our Lord's own master. Even if Yuan Chengzhao is a good-for-nothing who repeatedly causes harm, the family must still look out for them. Naturally, we pay attention."

He clasped his hands behind his back, pacing as he asked with feigned casualty,

"Your wife is from..."

Yang Tianyou smiled and curtsied.

"The Yang Clan of Simin... just a small, unknown family."

She stated it clearly: the Yang Clan of Simin, not the Yang Clan of Diyun Peak, Azure Pond. The difference between the two was vast.

Li Jiangqian nodded thoughtfully. "That's not quite right. The Yang Clan of Simin are also orthodox imperial descendants, descendants of King Yue."

Yang Tianyou smiled without replying. Li Jiangliang stepped forward.

"Elder Brother, did you come to see my brother-in-law? He's cultivating at Heavenly Thunder Peak, not in the city. We'll have to head south."

Heavenly Thunder Peak was one of the wonders of the Mushroom Forest Plains. Because large deposits of thunder-ore were buried in the mountain, heavenly lightning rolled across it endlessly, year-round, leaving the peak and its base scorched black. Li Qinghong had once borrowed this place to achieve a breakthrough, a fact the Li family knew well.

But at the mention of Yang Zhuo, Li Jiangqian's eyes narrowed slightly. He smiled, "Since I'm here, I must meet him. I've only heard you praise him; I've yet to see what kind of man he truly is."

Although Li Jiangliang knew Li Jiangqian meant no harm by this visit, seeing his attitude, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He turned to his subordinates.

"Remain here and guard the city. I'll be back shortly."

The two brothers rose into the air, riding on flames, and flew south. The smile on Li Jiangqian's face faded, his expression growing calm, his voice distant.

"You haven't returned home in many years. Do you miss it?"

Li Jiangliang bowed in response. "Of course. I miss it terribly."

Li Jiangqian didn't acknowledge his answer, speaking as if to himself.

"Lord Cui's cultivation has advanced, and he has now returned to Chongzhou Island. You should have been there to see him off, but the timing was unfortunate."

At the mention of Cui Jueyin, Li Jiangliang was visibly moved. "I heard. The path to the Purple Mansion Realm is fraught with peril. I was in Simin at the time, and I hated that I couldn't rush back. In the end, I wasn't able to personally escort Master back to the island..."

They arrived suddenly at Heavenly Thunder Peak. Thunder crashed, and the smell of scorched earth filled the air. Li Jiangqian saw a one-armed old man in green robes approach them. His beard was sparse, and he cringed, his head lowered. His gaunt face was sallow and withered, the clear mark of chronic injuries and a lack of resources. He spoke in a low, subservient voice.

"This lowly one greets you, my Lords..."

Li Jiangqian glanced at him, a flicker of surprise on his face. "Ah, if it isn't Lord Yuan Huyuan... Please, no need for such ceremony!"

Yuan Huyuan kept his head bowed, hunching his shoulders, and darted a pleading glance at Li Jiangliang. But Li Jiangliang simply smiled as his elder brother helped the old man up. He gestured to the man and said,

"He is the Yuan Clan Head now."

Sweat poured down Yuan Huyuan's face as he repeatedly stammered that he wasn't worthy. Li Jiangqian, however, adopted a serious tone.

"For all these years... Yuan Chengzhao was the master of the Yuan family, and it wasn't our place to interfere. Now that you've escaped that sea of suffering, better days are ahead."

He then retrieved a golden pill box from his sleeve and pressed it into the old man's hand.

"Please, take this..."

Yuan Huyuan didn't even know which generation of the Li family this young man belonged to. He was bewildered, unable to process how he had fallen from being called 'Senior' by Li Chejing to this current, wretched state. A confusing mix of hot and cold sensations washed over his limbs. He looked again at Li Jiangliang, his eyes filled with a desperate, lost plea.

Li Jiangliang smiled. "Clan Head Yuan, please accept it."

Only then did the old man quickly hide the box in his own sleeve, crying out,

"Thank you, my Lords! Thank you!"

The two brothers had already started up the steps, coming to a stop in the courtyard on Heavenly Thunder Peak. Li Jiangqian lowered his head slightly. He saw flows of purple energy streaming across the steps, which were covered in a fine layer of white crystals, like frost, as white as snow.

Two steps higher, they saw a white-winged immortal crane standing on one leg in the courtyard. Its long beak was tucked into its feathers, lost in a deep sleep.

Li Jiangliang's expression changed instantly. He shook out his robes, took a step back, and announced respectfully,

"Reporting to my Lord! The Li Family Head has come to pay his respects."

The hall doors creaked open, and a man stepped out. He appeared young, dressed in white robes. His dark eyes were sharp and slightly tapered, giving his handsome face a severe cast, yet his naturally elegant eyebrows lent him an air of dashing, unrestrained charm.

He stood in the courtyard and raised those eyebrows. The white crane instantly awoke, gave a light push, and spread its wings, ascending into the clouds.

"Li Jiangqian of the Moongaze Li Clan, greets Fellow Daoist Yang!"

Li Jiangqian offered the greeting with a smile. The man before him smiled back and led him into the main hall. He raised an eyebrow at Li Jiangliang, but his words were for Li Jiangqian.

"Ah, a guest from Moongaze Lake. Forgive my discourtesy in not welcoming you sooner."

Li Jiangqian privately noted that this man possessed a refined elegance, far from an ordinary person. He took a seat beside him, his gaze sweeping over the hall's entrance. The vision of flowing purple energy and frost-covered steps was gone, leaving only the dark, scorched stone.

Yang Zhuo had already spoken, his tone pleasant.

"I have long heard of Moongaze's reputation. It is I who should be paying you a visit."

As Li Jiangqian finished his observation, he felt a sudden, piercing might wash over him. He couldn't explain it, but it made him feel intensely threatened. He sensed no malice, yet it felt as if the other man had inexplicably pressed a blade to his throat, ready to cut down his prestige.

He knew instantly that Li Jiangliang had not been exaggerating. He was shaken.

'It's true. This man is on the same level as Father.'

He smiled. "I came today... first, simply to meet you, and second, regarding the Yuan family's affairs. And third, of course, for my brother's marriage... Seeing the Yuan family now being put to good use, I feel a thread of karma has been settled."

"The root of the chaos has been removed. The Yuan family will naturally find peace."

"As for the marriage... my father has mentioned it."

Yang Zhuo shifted his gaze, the sharp aura retracting.

"His esteemed self is advanced in years and has always had exacting standards. For Jiangliang to earn his favor shows he is a first-class talent, a dragon among men. I also heard that Daoist Master Minghuang has given his approval. This is an excellent match."

Yang Zhuo turned his head, no longer facing him directly. He didn't seem to hold much goodwill for him. Li Jiangqian, in turn, felt a profound sense of unease, like needles on his back. His golden pupils dropped, scanning the floor near the entrance. He discovered that the threshold was covered in tiny snakes, each no bigger than a finger. Water and fire roiled on their scales, and their tails were linked together, forming a shimmering, dancing carpet of multicolored light.

Li Jiangqian suppressed his reaction and forced a smile.

"It's just that it hasn't been easy for my fourth brother, venturing out all alone. In the future, we will have to trouble the Yang family with many matters..."

Yang Zhuo replied,

"He is not only my younger sister's beloved, but also my good friend. I consider him my own brother. Family Head, you need not be so courteous."

They exchanged a few more pleasantries and chatted about trivial matters. Finally, Li Jiangqian raised his golden eyes.

"Then I shall not impose any longer."

He exited the main hall and rose into the sky on his flames, speeding away. Li Jiangliang followed to see him off. The two brothers flew in silence for a long time. After an unknown while, Li Jiangqian finally chuckled.

"No wonder you were told you had to follow him... He is a truly formidable man."

Li Jiangliang had not missed Yang Zhuo's animosity toward Li Jiangqian. He felt a little helpless as he replied,

"My following him isn't some gamble... My Lord has said, he can bring peace to the Yue lands and separate the mortal from the immortal. His pursuit of the Dao... has always been to end conflict with strength, to save the common people..."

This sentence only made the smile on Li Jiangqian's face widen. He made a subtle, almost imperceptible motion of grinding his teeth, his eyes burning as he stared at his younger brother.

"That's true! How could a noble imperial descendant be content with a single prefecture?"

Li Jiangliang stopped within his flames. He bowed deeply to this elder brother he barely knew.

"Brother... I have made things difficult for the family..."

Li Jiangqian's superficial smile froze. His eyebrows drew together as his brother continued in a low voice:

"When you see Father, please relay a message for me... Jiangliang... will never take a single thing from the family. If I do, then let me answer to our ancestors with my life!"

...

The Vermillion Sea, Suzhu Reefs.

The reefs were scattered across the vast sea like stars in the sky. Their crimson rock was dazzling under the sun. Flights of cultivators in white robes rose and fell among them, creating a lively scene.

High above the islands, at the very apex of the sky, a Daoist Master in white robes stood with Spiritual Swords on his back. His expression was solemn, his gaze tinged with sorrow as it swept silently over the islands below.

Beneath Fuxuan's feet lay the famous Suzhù Reefs, a core territory of the Vermillion Sea. This was the overseas base managed by the Hengzhu Dao for generations. Over hundreds of years, it had been fortified into an impenetrable stronghold, its Purple Mansion Realm grand array shimmering with power.

'Only now, it no longer belongs to the Bi family!'

Many years ago, Hengxing had personally visited the Chunyi Dao Gate to trade for a portion of 'Star-Soul Divine Origin' from Fuxuan. In exchange, the Suzhù Reefs were to be mortgaged to the Chunyi Dao Gate for fifty full years.

At the time, the Chunyi Dao Gate was at the height of its prestige. With a newly ascended Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it was eager to expand its influence. The deal had seemed incredibly favorable. Fuxuan, after careful consideration, had agreed.

Now, with the Hengzhu Dao sealing its gates, Fuxuan finally understood.

'Hengxing... she had been planning this from the very beginning. This so-called 'mortgage' to my Chunyi Dao Gate... it was just a way to have my family guard these islands for her while her own sect was sealed!'

Still, when he weighed it all, both sides had profited. And they were, after all, both part of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. At this, Fuxuan felt a secret sense of relief and became much more comfortable with the situation.

He waited over the sea for a while. Finally, a streak of light approached from the east, rapidly manifesting before him as a man in green robes.

The man was young, his green robes fluttering. His eyes were a pale azure, and his face was all smiles. He bowed to Fuxuan and said casually,

"Fellow Daoist Fuxuan!"

"Fellow Daoist Chi!"

Fuxuan replied, his tone flat.

The young man stood with his hands behind his back, appearing perfectly at ease. He smiled.

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist."

This man was none other than the long-missing Chi Buzi!

His eyes were the same pale azure as before, revealing a cold indifference. A string of jet-black, glossy prayer beads hung at his waist, pulsing with the light of Pristine Water.

He seemed unchanged from several years ago, save for the fluctuating aura of his divine ability, which felt... different.

The two entered the grand array together. When Chi Buzi remained silent, Fuxuan finally had to speak first.

"Your... gains. They were substantial, I presume?"

Chi Buzi took a sip of tea, a faint, unreadable smile playing on his lips. He set the cup down.

"There were some gains," he said quietly. "After all, I refused to join the Buddhists. That only leaves so many options. Pu Yu only offered a few words for your sake and mine; he would never get involved personally..."

"Still, there was a turning point."

Fuxuan shook his head. "Otherwise, you wouldn't have come here. And you certainly wouldn't be so eager to meddle in this mess."

Chi Buzi's gaze gradually turned ice-cold and sharp. He stared blankly at some distant point.

"It's the turning point I'm afraid of," he said softly. "What if it was left behind by some great power? How many have reached the end of their cultivation, only to discover they were just placing the final piece on someone else's board? ...Still, being a game piece is one thing. What I fear is being the piece that's only needed to fill a space, and not to stay alive."

He seemed to be weighed down by some great hesitation, and the implication of his words was clear. Fuxuan's heart sank.

'Penglai never meddles with Fruition Attainment. Since Pu Yu spoke, it must have been a method that wouldn't offend Pristine Water. What else could it be... but reincarnation?'

He looked down at Chi Buzi, his own heart heavy. The words of Daoist Master Yuanshang from all those years ago echoed in his ears. Their situations were, in fact, quite similar. A complex expression crossed his face as he said in a low voice,

"Some opportunities... you cannot question their origin. You simply must use them!"

Chi Buzi clearly hadn't expected him to say such a thing. It struck the very core of his worries. He raised his azure-tinted eyes and gave Fuxuan an appreciative smile, but his mind flashed with a different, razor-sharp thought:

'Oh? Fuxuan, Fuxuan... does your Chunyi Dao Gate... also carry an opportunity that it is forced to cultivate? An opportunity... from the Supreme Yin Daoist Tradition?'

# Chapter 964: Feathered Serpent Metallic Essence

Chi Buzi's mind raced. His gaze swept over Fuxuan's face before settling on the teacup. "Regardless," he said, his voice quiet, "I must thank you and Senior Daoist Master Yuanshang for intervening this time. Otherwise, there would have been no hope."

Fuxuan understood that by invoking the 'Penglai' invitation, Chi Buzi was no longer secretly wondering if their Daoist Master Yuanshang was dead. His words were full of affirmation. Yet, faced with Chi Buzi's gratitude, Fuxuan did not reply.

Fuxuan wasn't as virulently hateful of evil as the two juniors of his house. He also had some lingering friendship with Chi Buzi from their early acquaintance. But an old knot remained in his heart, a self-drawn line between "righteous" and "heretical" that he refused to cross. He could only close his eyes and sip his tea.

The blue-eyed man, however, seemed completely unbothered. He sat upright, calmly holding his cup.

"Whoosh..."

A wind howled through the courtyard, tunneling through his sleeves, making his green robes rustle and flap. The ink-black beads at his waist swayed gently.

The wind lightly tousled the hair at Fuxuan's temples. He snapped his eyes open, staring at the last empty seat by the table.

Ethereal clouds drifted, Dharma light condensed into purple, and yin-energy roiled as silvery-white light flowed. All manner of phenomena converged on the empty seat. It first brightened with an inexplicable light, then just as quickly, everything vanished into nothingness. A sleeve, adorned with hangings like the feathers of a bird, swept across the table. A jade-like hand lifted a cup.

A beautiful man with a soft, androgynous face and striking phoenix eyes had appeared.

Chi Buzi continued to sip his tea, head bowed, but the wind in the courtyard abruptly ceased. A smile touched his words.

"Lord Wei."

The moment he spoke, the wind returned, swelling into a gale. An expanse of Pristine Water, green as a shadowed pool, spread out beneath the three of them. The sound of dripping water filled their ears. Darkness fell, and a chilling mist permeated the air, enveloping them all. It was as if they had left the hall and arrived at the edge of a grim, sunless pond.

In this dark, Underworld-like place, the man of indiscernible gender smiled. His voice was clear and bright.

"Brother Buzi."

Waves of white-and-shadowed Veiled Yin rolled out with the crisp, clacking sound of colliding beads. Wei Xuanyin sat in the northern position. All the light in the courtyard seemed to drain toward him. Behind him, a circular screen seemed to unfold, its edges revealing the faint silhouettes of furry branches with leaves as fine as needles.

"Omm!"

Amidst this frenzied clash between Veiled Yin and Pristine Water, only one spot remained clear, like moonlight spilling on the ground. At some point, Fuxuan had drawn his sword and now held it in his lap, his eyes closed.

The clash of divine abilities began and ended in an instant. All phenomena vanished. The light in Wei Xuanyin's and Chi Buzi's eyes faded. Not even the teacups on the table had so much as rippled; they still sat serenely before the two men.

"Daoist Friend Chi, it has been too long!"

Wei Xuanyin smiled, a trace of emotion in his gaze. "I always knew you were a first-rate talent, but I never imagined you would cross the Purple Mystery so easily!"

Chi Buzi watched him, his expression cold and detached. "Lord Wei," he said softly, "I doubt you came all this way from the north, busy as you are, just to reminisce."

Wei Xuanyin's smile faded. His voice turned grim. "You know full well why this matter was set to take place in the Eastern Sea. For many years, His Excellency has not let slip a single portion of the Feathered Serpent's Metallic Essence. Not even the Underworld dares to interfere. Do you truly understand the stakes of this?"

Chi Buzi's expression was calm. "I wouldn't have come here otherwise."

Wei Xuanyin retrieved a jade box from his sleeve and placed it gently on the table, pressing down on it with five fingers as white as jade. Chi Buzi's eyes narrowed.

"How is Suiguan?"

Wei Xuanyin looked amused. "He returned to Pristine Speech Heaven. His Excellency used the Chou-Gui Hidden Form to conceal him. He is now detached from causality, hidden away in a place of obscurity... No one can divine his fate."

A hint of sarcasm entered Chi Buzi's gaze. He chuckled. "This is hardly the first time."

Wei Xuanyin smiled back and gently opened the jade box, revealing a small, pale-gold seal within. It was two fingers wide and three fingers high. A ferocious, majestic Feathered Serpent was coiled atop it, its wings enshrouding the sides of the seal.

The serpent seemed to possess a demonic magic, holding all three of their gazes. Chi Buzi did not reach for it. Instead, he slowly shifted his eyes and spoke in a measured tone.

"I have one more question for you, Lord Wei."

Wei Xuanyin smiled. "Please."

Chi Buzi's voice was haunting. "The Chou-Gui delights in concealment, its position is to 'gather within water.' Since His Excellency can hide... hide even the very root and status that the Feathered Serpent left for its descendants—hiding it so well the serpent has no feathers, its tail has lost its three barbs..."

"Then, knowing the seal might contain the Metallic Essence, why not secure it? Why let it wander free?"

His eyes locked onto Wei Xuanyin. "And if you say it's for someone to retrieve it—a True Monarch cannot. How can I?"

Wei Xuanyin glanced at Fuxuan, whose face was gradually paling. He clapped his hands. "Impressive, Daoist Friend! Truly impressive!"

He stood up, his tone deep and somber. "The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, is a token of the Feathered Serpent. It was rumored to be one of its choices for a Dharma Treasure. In the end, the Feathered Serpent chose the 'Pingtan Light,' and this item was passed to the Miexuan Snake Monarch."

"Back then, when the True Hornless Dragon swallowed the Pristine Water, it initiated the ancient era. The Pristine-Converging relationship was altered. The Miexuan Snake Monarch fled. The leader of the Nine Sons, the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, who considered himself the foremost of the Hornless Dragon lineage, sensed something was wrong. But he couldn't find him. He went to ask the Western Sea Dragon King, Dongfang Yuezhu, but even together, they could not divine the seal's location."

"From that moment, cultivators began to suspect the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal contained the Metallic Essence, a hidden gambit left by the Feathered Serpent."

His expression shifted, growing serious. "As a great sage who achieved the Dao in primordial times, the True Hornless Dragon naturally would not act uselessly. It was confident at the time, but this was an unprecedented event. In the end, it perished. Yet, in antiquity, there is merit in 'empty proof.' Though it fell, its achievement was no less than his peers. With the 'transformation of Pristine to Converging' in the past, the two, Pristine and Converging, were already different."

A Dharma-light rippled in his eyes, his divine ability activating on its own, seemingly to conceal them from the karmic backlash of discussing ancient matters. "The Miexuan Snake Monarch cultivated in silence, refusing to 'enter the leap' or 'enter the auxiliary'. He secretly received help from the master of Pit Water, reincarnated three times to cleanse his spirit, and took human form. He intended to secretly seize the position of Pristine Water, but in 'Jizhong,' he ran into the Lord of Jade True, who had not yet achieved the Dao, and was killed."

"The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal thus fell into the hands of the Immortal Mansion."

Wei Xuanyin paused. Seeing Chi Buzi's blank expression, he knew the other man was already familiar with much of this and was merely seeking confirmation. He continued softly, "When Daoist Master Donghua appeared, this item finally re-emerged in the world. He gave it to Ning Tiaoxiao, who cultivates Pristine Water. It's rumored Chi Wei secretly leaked that this item had already been refined by moonlight, becoming a great wonder that could elevate both Pristine and Converging Water. If the Metallic Essence is still within... I don't need to spell out the implications."

"And the Feathered Serpent... His Excellency isn't the only one watching. The Dragons are watching. All the cultivators are watching."

Wei Xuanyin smiled. "The world today has been turned upside down. His Excellency's methods are profound, securing his Pristine Water position. The Dragon-kin are tyrannical, suppressing the Feathered Serpent. They are both sitting comfortably, waiting for the fish to bite. They don't fear a mere wisp of Metallic Essence. For both His Excellency and the Dragon-kin, whether they get it or not, destroying one of its backup plans is always a good thing. On this point, their interests align. They were just waiting for Ning Tiaoxiao to break through, to see what kind of gambit would be triggered."

"And so, Ning Tiaoxiao secretly understood the predicament and swore never to cultivate his divine ability..."

"Wrong."

Chi Buzi calmly interrupted him. "If this were true, how could His Excellency allow him not to cultivate? How could the Dragon-kin allow it? Don't try to tell me they 'didn't care.' I know His Excellency better than you."

Wei Xuanyin's expression froze for a second. He re-evaluated Chi Buzi. "I asked Lord Suiguan that very question," he said softly.

"When the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal first appeared, it was brought back to the Azure Pond. His Excellency examined it."

His gaze grew inscrutable. "There should have been a result. It was a 'method' left by the previous Jade True master. His True Unification Transformation was left inside it... According to Lord Xue's speculation, the Metallic Essence should be in that previous Jade True master's Grotto-Heaven. When the seal's owner breaks through, it will connect to it and descend into the world."

Chi Buzi now understood completely. He laughed. "So, at the time, none of them wanted to alert him, nor did they want to hold this hot potato that linked back to the original Jade True master. What you said before was just the first layer of truth, a lie that we—you, me, the Three Yuans, the Two Purples—are all caught in. Ning Tiaoxiao would rather die than become fodder for His Excellency, little knowing that the heavens were watching him coldly, wanting him not to cultivate, letting him die deceived by that first layer of lies!"

He stood up slowly, his voice light, filled with the clarity of sudden realization. "Therefore, Chi Wei's death was not unjust. His failure to obtain the 'gold' was fated. Since the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal could help its owner connect to the Metallic Essence and draw the attention of the original Jade True master, he was always a potential threat. The severing of the Pristine Water Dao Lineage is largely due to the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, which also made those who wanted to cause trouble for His Excellency give up."

A chilling frost filled his eyes. "And the other part... True Monarch Shangyuan's ascension confirmed that the renowned original Jade True master had already left for the outer heavens. With his protector gone and no hope of breakthrough, Ning Tiaoxiao's death was immediate and certain! Only then did the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal quickly 'disappear,' smoothly becoming a chess piece that the various Lords could pick up and place in their pockets."

Wei Xuanyin smiled as he watched him. "Back then... it was someone from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition who gave it to my Viewing Pavilion. In exchange, his house earned the right to stay out of worldly affairs. Even though they interfered several times from beginning to end, and even sent someone to disrupt things at the final moment, they were still let off lightly. That was the reason."

Fuxuan, sitting to the side, was profoundly shaken, staring at Wei Xuanyin in disbelief. Chi Buzi, however, was not surprised. He sneered twice. "I knew it was him!"

Only now did Chi Buzi finally let his gaze fall upon the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. An incredibly deep, calculating look entered his eyes. "...Having eliminated the dissent from both sides," he muttered, "His Excellency and the Dragon-kin are both eagerly awaiting me to draw out this wisp of Metallic Essence..."

The implication was that his own Dao-path lay with one of these two factions.
As expected, Wei Xuanyin smiled and nodded. "You cultivate Pristine Water, Daoist Friend. You surely understand these matters better than I. The Refining Pristine Water into Converging Water is a precedent, a cause-and-effect of the heaviest weight. If you dissolve your cultivation base to cultivate Converging Water, with your talent, you would absolutely surpass ninety-nine percent of all others! Not to mention, your cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds!"

"I'd have to succeed in the switch!" Chi Buzi retorted.

The other man laughed. "As long as the Dragon-kin are willing to help you, there will be a turning point. Dissolve your cultivation, switch to Converging Water... the 'logic of the Dao-path' is there, your future is bright. As for joining His Excellency... you could also try to seek an Auxiliary Position. The decision is yours."

It was impossible to know how much of his words were in jest, but his meaning was clear. There were two paths before him, but both required extracting the Metallic Essence as a prerequisite: join the Dragons, reincarnate, and cultivate Converging Water; or join His Excellency and attain an Auxiliary Position in Pristine Water.

Chi Buzi's features grew even colder. He stared at the small golden seal for a long time, unable to look away.

'[Converging Water] may favor the 'leap,' but how could the Dragon-kin tolerate me? His Excellency's heart is treacherous; how could I possibly attain an Auxiliary Position in Pristine Water? Neither path is easy...'

'Moreover... how can it be as simple as 'attaining it'? Where is the 'logic of the Dao-path'? Where is the method to seek the 'gold'?!'

But Fuxuan's words still echoed in his mind. His earlier judgment of Ning Tiaoxiao's situation now applied to himself:

'How could His Excellency allow him not to cultivate? How could the Dragon-kin allow it? Some opportunities, when they arrive... you cannot question their origin. You have no choice but to use them!'

He could only silently take the jade box and stare fixedly at Wei Xuanyin.

"Many thanks, Lord Wei!"

"It's nothing!"

Wei Xuanyin's smile also vanished. For people like them, on the verge of perfecting their divine abilities, with a chance to strike for Fruition Attainment, to attain a 'leap' or 'auxiliary' position... which one of them wasn't risking their very life-mandate in the torrent of the era for a chance at the Dao?

'Whether it's me or Chi Buzi... or the older generation like the Two Purples, Yuanshang, Yuandao... or even Yehui! We just have a little room to maneuver. We're nothing like Li Zhouwei... no matter how great his destiny, he's like cattle penned in a circle, just waiting to die!'

A feeling of shared sympathy rose in him. He stopped teasing and watched as Chi Buzi dissolved into Pristine Water and vanished.

Once Chi Buzi was gone, a complex look entered Fuxuan's eyes. He didn't know if he was envious of Chi Buzi for being able to stand in the great tide and make a choice, or if he was sighing at the sharpness that allowed him to stand there and see clearly. "I finally understand," he said with deep emotion, "why Master could see that Xiao Jinzhou was a seed of Dao-attainment! Such people truly exist."

"He was shaped by circumstance, an ambitious man from the start," Wei Xuanyin replied, before adding, "He certainly has the desire to not bend his knee to another. Who knows where his final divine ability lies... but in any case, it's most likely not the orthodox Pit Water, which is unsuitable for his breakthrough."

"His remaining options are Converging Water, Pristine Water, Water Mansion, and Valley Water. His Excellency has a 'method' placed in his soul. Converging Water is clearly pro-Dragon. Pristine Water won't just appear from nowhere, and even if it did, he wouldn't dare cultivate it—he'd be suspected of using Dragon power to scheme for the Pristine Water Fruition Attainment and would likely die violently. Perhaps he'll choose Water Mansion, which is close to Pristine Water, and seek a 'leap' position. Or, he'll choose Valley Water to ensure a safe reincarnation!"

Wei Xuanyin's Dao-Profundity was extremely high. In a few short sentences, he had incisively analyzed the entire situation. His earlier probe was likely an attempt to test Chi Buzi's final divine ability. Now, he finally turned his gaze to Fuxuan, a hint of resignation in his voice. "You were willing to personally step in and push this matter forward for me... It must be for that same reason..."

"Lord Wei is wise!" Fuxuan's gaze was steady, his voice clear. "The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is, after all, my former sect... Both houses have already retired to the mountains and will not interfere again. I beg you all to spare them... Do not hunt them to extinction!"

"Hunt them to extinction..." Wei Xuanyin said simply, "That is not something we do... If you're looking for someone, you should be looking for the Underworld!"

Fuxuan bowed his head. "I beg Lord Wei to show me a path!"

Wei Xuanyin rose to his feet and drifted away, leaving only his final words behind:

"Stop meddling in worldly affairs. If you had all upheld the rule of separation between immortal and mortal, and had not tried to control the regions and dismember the Yue State all those years ago... would you be in this predicament today?"

# Chapter 965: True Qi

"The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal..."

The Great Void was dim and somber. Faint illusions shrouded the scene. The grand array’s crimson light blazed, and though the Great Void appeared empty, bursts of brilliance would surge forth, only to be extinguished an instant later.

An endless, pale-yellow iridescence descended, a near-infinite phantom brilliance. The clouds and mists of the Great Void drifted, rapidly dissipating as Chi Buzi departed.

When the radiance faded, a man was revealed, sitting cross-legged.

He had a youthful face, with fine brows and large, elegant eyes. He gazed intently into the Great Void before suddenly turning his head to ask:

"Fellow Daoist, what do you make of this treasure?"

Thunder rumbled in response. On the other side, purple lightning and smoky clouds coalesced, revealing a heroic woman with willow-leaf brows and almond eyes. She held a silver spear, exuding a formidable aura.

"I did not get a close look."

"But the Dragon Monarch said... this item definitely has a connection, though we don't know to where."

The two of them traversed the Great Void. With a single step, the surrounding scenery fell away like a black curtain. Illusions shifted infinitely. Purple lightning sparked in the darkness, and the void itself swelled, transforming into a vast, violet-white circular pool.

A dense, viscous liquid of violet-white lightning floated up. Purple bolts of thunder crashed down into the pool. Deep-azure copper and iron surfaces emerged, covered in lightning patterns, from which a silver-white palace leaped forth.

They had arrived at the Thunder Pool.

Dongfang Heyun’s expression was calm. He sat down in a small pavilion within the palace. The woman formed of purple lightning picked up a teapot—it was none other than Li Qinghong.

She poured the tea, filling cups for them both, and spoke softly:

"This original master of the Jade True... was he truly so remarkable?"

Dongfang Heyun chuckled twice, raised his cup, and said in a low voice:

"To put it bluntly, among all the heroes of history, those who could definitively surpass him... you wouldn't need more than ten fingers to count!"

The dignified man lowered his head to sip the tea, but the taste was so surprisingly potent that he winced for a moment.

He smacked his lips, set the cup down first, and only then continued:

"I have followed my Lord for a long time. I can tell you a few things."

"The foremost figures in this world, past and present, are the Immortal Lords. This title usually refers to cultivators who existed before the birth of the Five Virtues and the Five Waters and Five Fires. As for their Daoist Tradition, the Dragon Monarch calls it..."

He said slowly, "Orthodox Origin Yin-Yang."

Dongfang Heyun paused slightly before continuing: "Later, the Five Virtues were born, and the Five Waters and Fires descended upon the world. Fruition Attainment became possible. The Three Profundities successively produced True Monarchs and Immortals. Although their strength was outstanding, they no longer called themselves Immortal Lords. Many Demon beasts also achieved Fruition Attainment. The very strongest among them was the True Hornless Dragon, hailed as the First Demon, whose cultivation was so profound it topped the ranks of Immortals."

"'Pristine' and 'Converging' colluded, and the Nine Sons were born. The master of the Converging Water was the Dragon Monarch of the Eastern Sea, honorably named Dongfang Rijiu. He was often suspected by ancient cultivators to be the reincarnation of the True Hornless Dragon... From the moment of his birth, he was at the peak of the Golden Core."

"The so-called Nine Sons of the True Hornless Dragon consisted of six 'Converging' and three 'Pristine'. The 'Pristine' were all Intercalary Positions, and the 'Converging' were all Auxiliary Positions. Later, they were all killed, one by one. The Dragon Monarch of the Eastern Sea fell at the hands of the world's first Sword Immortal... And this second Sword Immortal..."

He looked gravely at Li Qinghong and replied, "Later... was the master of the Jade True."

Li Qinghong was thoughtful. "So that's how it is... In that case, did this current Jade True's attainment of the Dao also benefit from the status of a Sword Immortal?"

Dongfang Heyun nodded. "Precisely!"

He sighed. "Furthermore, the Jade True is one of the Three Shaman Daos, and also controls the Great Dao of real and illusory, true and false. The transformations are incredibly difficult. That person is already an Immortal; when he transforms into something, even another Immortal wouldn't be able to see through the illusion!"

Li Qinghong frowned. "Therefore, the methods of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal..."

"The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal cannot be divined."

Dongfang Heyun shook his head, speaking softly. "The story of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal wasn't divined by any Lord. It was told by Immortal Yingze to the Six Sons of Chongming back in the day!"

Li Qinghong nodded silently. She recalled the details for a moment, then frowned and asked, "The Dragon Monarch of the Eastern Sea... fell to a Sword Immortal... This must involve a conflict between Daoist Traditions. What Dao did that Immortal cultivate?"

Dongfang Heyun's expression grew distant. "His title can no longer be mentioned... That Lord achieved 'Empty Attestation'!"

"'Empty Attestation'?"

Li Qinghong pressed, and Dongfang Heyun explained: "Empty Attestation means to use 'what is' to prove 'what is not.' This Fruition Attainment did not originally exist. Whether by borrowing or concealing, one is able to attest to it through the Great Dao, forcing the world to recognize one additional position!"

"What?"

Li Qinghong understood a great deal about Fruition Attainment now, but this sounded utterly bizarre. Dongfang Heyun shook his head, a deep horror surfacing in his eyes.

"This is a matter of ancient history; just listen to it as a story. This position was for the Way of the Sword... It is the source of all Sword Origin and Sword Intent in the world, and simultaneously, it is the fundamental root and status of a Sword Immortal!"

"The saying 'The sword is the monarch of all weapons' comes from this."

Dongfang Heyun was silent for a long time. At last, he sighed. "I've heard there are different types of Empty Attestation, but this Lord was truly terrifying. He did not borrow, nor did he conceal; he attested to it from thin air. You could say he was one of a kind. During the war between Immortals and Devils, he successively slew two Wood Virtue cultivators, injured countless other ancient cultivators, and then departed freely. From ancient times to now, he is worthy of being called the number one..."

His voice dropped. "He is also the reason the Wood Virtue has been in decline ever since."

Li Qinghong was dumbstruck. She pondered this, and after a long moment, said, "This is the fundamental root and status of a sword cultivator... No wonder... No wonder Sword Immortals can annihilate divine abilities and slay those at the Purple Mansion Realm. So this is the reason!"

Dongfang Heyun shook his head with a wry laugh. "Do you know why a Sword Immortal must always achieve their status _before_ attaining a divine ability?!"

Li Qinghong's pupils widened slightly as she looked at the refined man before her.

"A divine ability embodies a Dao lineage. Sword Intent is also an extremely unique and domineering wondrous power. It cannot tolerate a cultivator who has already set foot on another path to come and seek it!"

Li Qinghong let out a long breath, a wave of realization hitting her. Her mind was quick, able to draw inferences. She immediately countered, "If that's the case, True Monarch Shangyuan possessed two Sword Intents back then... Does that mean he had two wondrous powers of the Way of the Sword?! His strength must not have been underestimated, surely?"

Dongfang Heyun's expression was hesitant. He lowered his head and thought for a long while before shaking his head. "I don't think it can be understood that way. That Sword Immortal's path was unique; one Sword Intent is already the absolute limit. All the Lords today actually suspect that True Monarch Shangyuan's two Sword Intents were a transformation from the Jade True's dao of illusion and reality..."

He sighed faintly. "Besides, once one ascends to Fruition Attainment, the help from Sword Intent is not as great as it was in the Purple Mansion Realm..."

The two changed the subject. Just then, a sound echoed in the Great Void. A woman with narrow eyes materialized, her robes fluttering. She had a dignified air, with two long strands of hair falling beside her cheeks.

The two rose together, seemingly to greet her, but the woman waved her hand repeatedly, signaling for them to sit. "Fuxin has come to relay a message on behalf of my Lord. There is no need for ceremony!"

She was quite imposing and stern. Even her polite words didn't sound very polite. She immediately got to the point, continuing:

"I've heard there are movements from both Mount Changhuai and the Underworld. The general situation on the mainland is becoming clearer. My Lord has been gestating the thunder for a long time, and the nature of the True Qi is about to manifest. I must ask you two to take the various Kings on a trip."

...

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

"RUMBLE!"

The rolling sound of thunder echoed from within the clouds. It spread from the dark storm clouds over the mountain peak and quickly reached the turbulent lake below. Yet, the cultivators coming and going passed by, accustomed to it, flying past the base of the mountain without even raising their heads.

The mountainside, however, was covered in surging purple fire. A small, pure-white vase hung in the air, tilted as if pouring. From its mouth, slivers of radiance fell, mixed with Baleful Fire Qi, raining down below.

On the other side, eighteen copper-gold boxes hovered, their colors deep and heavy. They rotated in the air, and spiritual thunder rose from them one by one, descending in sequence, all of it converging between those two fingers.

Radiance and thunderfire intertwined, erupting with Baleful Fire Qi. All of it was gathered by the divine ability and drawn into the solemn Juque Palace.

Within the palace, a great hall stood, five bays wide and three bays deep, supported by eight inner pillars. It was magnificent, a blend of gold and red, their lusters reflecting each other. The thunderfire, radiance, and Baleful Fire Qi were all drawn into the hall, forming a spinning vortex of thunder and fire that swept through the space.

An unknown amount of time passed before the Juque Palace suddenly shuddered. The great hall standing tall within it burst into brilliant color, emanating a wondrous aura. A man opened his golden eyes and exhaled a breath of Baleful Fire Qi.

**"[Emperor Qi's Light] is complete!"**

The eighteen copper boxes fell, one by one. The Profound Pattern Vase in the sky also retracted its brilliance, no longer pouring out radiance, and floated lightly down onto the desk. With a thought from Li Zhouwei, the vase leaped up and flew into the baleful spring on the mountain.

Nine of the eighteen copper boxes still shimmered with lightning, clearly not yet depleted.

Li Zhouwei calculated with his fingers. Only nine months had passed.

'Emperor Qi's Light is complex, but it wasn't too difficult for me. Not to mention I had an endless supply of radiance, lightning, and Baleful Fire Qi...'

He had taken a full eighteen streams of spiritual thunder, but this spell art didn't have a high demand for it. Even with the extra consumption from rapidly advancing the art's progress, he had only used nine in the end.

As Li Zhouwei exhaled the Baleful Fire Qi, the spot between his brows brightened slightly. A speck of radiance flashed and then sank deep within, and all sorts of new insights welled up in his mind.

Although it also originated from the Juque Palace and was emitted from the glabella, it was different from the 'Radiant Chamber' of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. The description for Emperor Qi's Light was 'Divergent Light Streams'. Once activated, it could shoot beams of light and electricity from between his brows, numerous and incredibly fast.

'It seems to have compensated for some of the clumsiness...'

His mood improved considerably. He had someone store the copper boxes, and then saw Li Que'wan come forward to report.

Li Zhouwei's gaze was sharp. He scanned her up and down and nodded.

"Your cultivation is solid, and your spiritual sense is condensed. Your current cultivation base is stable. You can take the pill and break through to the late stage."

The Li family had the support of the Talisman Pill, so each stage of cultivation was like skipping a minor realm. This was less obvious in Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining, but the effects were immediate and drastic in the Foundation Establishment Realm and Purple Mansion Realm. Li Que'wan understood he was referring to the Talisman Pill and acknowledged.

"This junior has come to report... In recent years, many of the non-family cultivators went into seclusion to attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, but most failed and perished... However, there is finally good news. A few days ago, An Xuanxin and An Xuantong of the An family both successfully broke through."

Li Zhouwei was naturally aware of this. Most of those who had entered seclusion at this time were older cultivators whose innate talent and cultivation methods were poor to begin with, so their chances were naturally low. The success of the rising generation was much higher, which was undoubtedly good news. He nodded.

"The An family bloodline is truly extraordinary."

But Li Que'wan continued in a gentle voice, "Aside from them, there was also one from the Eastern Yue. He had earned the right to attempt the breakthrough long ago, but he requested a compatible cultivation method from the clan and spent time converting all his dharma power. After a long seclusion, he had a fortunate breakthrough a year ago. His name is Dili Youjie. He has been wanting to pay his respects to Uncle, but didn't dare to disturb you..."

Li Zhouwei was rather surprised. He replied, "I know of him... His talent is poor; 'hard-working' is the only word to describe him. He's quite lucky... to actually break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

"He's an old-timer. Very well, I'll see him."

Li Que'wan nodded and withdrew. Before Dili Youjie even had a chance to come up, a young man in crimson robes who had been waiting for some time hurried up the mountain. He bowed before him and said respectfully:

"Your son has already been to the Mushroom Forest Plains and has returned to report to Father!"

Li Zhouwei immediately raised his eyebrows, listening with full attention as he recounted the entire experience.

"Crystal brine, white cranes, intertwined serpents, water and fire..."

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain, radiance flickered, and white flowers drifted like waves. Li Zhouwei listened, his expression turning grave.

"'True Qi'..."

"Reporting to Father, yes, 'True Qi'!"

Li Jiangqian's words were filled with suspicion. He said in a low voice, "This person has a rounded brow, short, sharp eyes, and an extraordinary presence. He has the aura of one destined to achieve the Dao, yet he harbors the ambition to conquer and pacify a region. The Yang family's intentions are clear as day."

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze, lost in thought. "He's no ordinary character. It's possible he's a manifestation of that one fiend that escaped!"

The True Monarch Tianwu, who held the 'True Qi' position, once left three suits of armor in the grotto-heaven to guard Anhuai Heaven. Later, when Anhuai Heaven fell, the three suits of armor transformed into three streams of Metallic Essence.

Of these three streams of Metallic Essence, two were obtained by Mount Changhuai and Purple Smoke, respectively. The remaining one escaped into the Great Void, instantly transforming into a fiend and killing a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Southern Sea. That cultivator hailed from the Jingyi Daoist Tradition, a fellow disciple of Daoist Master Xuanyi.

Once Metallic Essence transforms into a fiend, it can only be handled by the Underworld. The Yang family has always had unclear dealings with the Underworld. For a 'True Qi' figure to appear now... it's likely the manifestation of the 'True Qi' that the Underworld obtained!

Li Jiangqian nodded silently. Li Zhouwei said in a low voice:

"Pacifying the Yue State... What great skill. What perfect timing."

What kind of state is the Yue State in today? The Three Sects and Seven Gates are collapsing one by one. Hengzhu, Purple Smoke, and Xiukui have all gone into seclusion. Changxiao has vanished. Azure Pond doesn't even have a Daoist Master to preside over it...

Now that this Yang Zhuo has appeared, who is left to stop him?

Li Zhouwei held a golden slip, tapping it lightly on the desk. He sorted through the various threads of information in his mind, and things became clearer. He said calmly:

"Yang Zhuo's trail didn't just appear today or yesterday. Ning Wan must have been aware of him long ago. No wonder as soon as Suiguan left, she simply abandoned Azure Pond and went into hiding... She can't afford to provoke him either!"

Li Jiangqian's gaze was heavy. "As your son sees it, this plan wasn't hatched in a day or two... Being in Jiangnan, the Yang family must have been the first to know about our Wei-Li bloodline. The incident with Yang Tianya back then was foreshadowing. It was a subtle hint... all so that today, our family would feel at ease letting people go, and not interfere with the Yang family's grand plan!"

"Mmm..."

Li Zhouwei glanced at him and replied, "As for what you said... about him and I being the same kind of figure... that's not accurate."

"I merely received the passing favor of a Fruition Attainment. He, on the other hand, is very likely the sole focus of a Tianwu Metallic Essence. It might even be on his person, or inside his Shengyang Acupoint, making him no different from a fiend. And with the Underworld backing him... there are probably few in this world who can compare to him."

"But..."

Li Jiangqian's gaze darkened. "If that's the case... how should our family position itself?"




# Chapter 966: Arrangements for the Wave-Suppressing Mansion

Li Zhouwei raised his cup, lost in thought. He remained pensive and silent. Li Que'wan had just returned from the mountain pass, clearly having escorted someone to the base. When she suddenly encountered this scene, she immediately moved to withdraw.

But Li Zhouwei set his cup down, gesturing for her to come closer and listen as he replied,

"All the great families share the same view. Fairy Qiuhu's actions set the precedent. The mighty Underworld has sent one of its own to reincarnate. Even if this person isn't as unique as the Grand Ancestor, how far off could they be?

"Those involved in this, whether supporting or opposing it, are certainly at the level of the Dragon-kin or Luoxia. At the very least, they are figures on par with Xiyan or the North Star Lady. As for the few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan, or the one or two Supreme Yang Daoist tradition that have lost their True Monarch's protection... their only choice is to offend no one and silently observe."

Li Jiangqian nodded. He understood his father’s references, 'Sheng Bai' was Xiyan, and 'Bei Shaoyang' was the North Star Lady. Now that both were major figures in the world, their names couldn't be used lightly. He ventured,

"I agree. Even if we know this person is born extraordinary, the clan should not send anyone to offer support or curry favor in advance. We must guard against a clash between those two peak factions. Even the aftershocks from their battle could destroy our family."

Li Zhouwei sipped his tea.

"The clan should indeed stay out of it. Your younger brother said he wouldn't ask the family for help, which was likely his subtle way of warning us, What Yang Zhuo is doing is of immense consequence. We must not interfere."

His expression grew grave. Looking at his two most outstanding juniors, he lowered his voice.

"What you two must do is achieve a divine ability as soon as possible. Even if having a divine ability doesn't make you a player in this grand game... once you have one, you are at least someone in the eyes of those lofty daoist traditions. Barring those with special circumstances who must stay behind, any cultivator at the Purple Mansion Realm, if they're willing to grit their teeth and abandon their foundations on the mainland, can carve out a territory for themselves overseas—a place to be their own master, bowing to no one."

Li Que'wan had only caught this last part of the conversation, but she understood they were discussing Yang Zhuo. She bowed slightly, replying in unison with Li Jiangqian, "We understand."

Li Zhouwei said quietly, "I may have some special status, but I am merely an exposed piece in the great game between North and South. Some conflicts and schemes will inevitably land on me, and I won't be able to escape. In their eyes, our clan's current affairs are a convenient handle to grasp me. The day their goals are met, I might perish... and the clan's future will fall to your Grand-Uncle and you two."

His gaze swept over them, passing the silently nodding Li Jiangqian to rest meaningfully on Li Que'wan. "Whether we end up reduced to Chongzhou or adrift overseas, it doesn't matter. As long as we have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, we can preserve some of the bloodline. If we lose even that... we will lose the right to even be pitied!"

A knot of sorrow tightened in Li Que'wan's chest. She nodded silently, her mind racing.

'The clan's secrets are being moved to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. It's safe, yes... but the immortal artifact has already vanished into the Great Void. If the clan suffers a calamity and our lineage is severed, we might lose contact with it forever! Ensuring the Purple Mansion Realm succession is the most critical task of all.'

As she mulled this over, Li Zhouwei turned and asked, "Is there any news from the Blessed Land?"

Li Que'wan shook her head, clearly having already inquired about this. "The Blessed Land is sealed, covered by a great formation. No letters have come through... but there is word from the Eastern Sea."

Li Zhouwei frowned. "The Xinyu Archipelago? Queyi?"

With the Purple Smoke Gate sealed, it was naturally difficult to protect their overseas interests. The once-famous Xinyu Archipelago was still operational, but few cultivators remained on the islands.

Li Que'wan nodded, a rare smile appearing at the mention of Li Queyi.

"When Purple Smoke sealed its gates, it left Cao Chu, Wei Danying, and their followers in the Xinyu Archipelago, effectively handing control to those few families. Sometime later, a Daoist Master arrived, claiming to be one of the rogue cultivators. Her name was Kuang Yu."

"So, it was Daoist Master Kuang Yu!"

Li Zhouwei mused, finding this logical. Since Purple Smoke could no longer control its overseas assets, it made sense that Daoist Master Kuang Yu—a Daoist Master close to the Supreme Yang Dao Lineage who had helped them in several great battles—would receive it as a reward.

Li Que'wan affirmed gently, "However, many suspect... that Daoist Master Zhu Gong is also hiding there."

"But ever since Purple Smoke's direct line withdrew, Sister Queyi has become a highly respected figure. They all treat her with great importance, and even Daoist Master Kuang Yu asked for her name. She has sent several very emotional letters home about it."

Her tone shifted. "Unfortunately, when Purple Smoke sealed its gates, Quexi was in the Blessed Land attempting a breakthrough. She must be locked inside and unable to leave."

"Mm."

Li Zhouwei wasn't surprised. Regardless of what favors or methods Purple Smoke had left behind to protect the Xinyu Archipelago, they wouldn't go so far as to trouble the Li family's direct line. He had a clear picture of the situation and asked, "How are things with the Zhuang family in the Great Desert?"

Although the Daoist Master had asked about the Zhuang family, Li Que'wan knew who he was truly inquiring about. She replied respectfully,

"The grand strategy has caused some ripples, but Golden Feather is strong, and few dare to act recklessly... However, it's said that Zhuang Pingye has been traveling for several years and isn't often in the Great Desert. It was Aunt Xinghan who stepped in to handle the recent turmoil. She has become quite famous."

Li Zhouwei nodded and dismissed the two. Only then did a middle-aged man ascend the mountain path.

The man appeared capable and sharp, though his middle-aged face was etched with apprehension. His black hair looked damp, tied in locks on either side. He clutched his robes, approached trembling, and dropped to the ground, not daring to look up. He kowtowed, his voice thick with tears.

"This old vassal pays his respects... to the Grand Concord of Radiance!"

"Rise."

Li Zhouwei paused, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. He studied the man with a trace of nostalgia. The strong, capable man from all those years ago was now a cultivator in the Foundation Establishment Realm, though that same shrewdness remained. He smiled. "It hasn't been easy for you."

Dili Youjie finally looked up, though he still didn't dare meet Li Zhouwei's gaze, fixing his eyes on his boots. His voice trembled, "This old vassal... is blessed to see you again, My Lord..."

Li Zhouwei asked, "You're cultivating 'Geng Metal'?"

"Reporting to My Lord! I was fortunate to be granted a cultivation art by the Lake... yes, it is 'Geng Metal'!"

Dili Youjie had leaped from being a lowly slave outside the Great Jue Court to the throne of the northern Eastern Yue entirely because of Li Zhouwei. When he later began cultivating, the cultivators on the Lake mostly discriminated against the Eastern Yue. Dili Youjie's so-called "royal" title meant nothing. Only by using his wits and borrowing Li Zhouwei's name could he command respect.

He understood perfectly that it was only because he had followed Li Zhouwei for that period that he had succeeded so often in the latter half of his life, obtaining such a fine cultivation method and resources.

Every time Dili Youjie startled awake at midnight, he couldn't help but wonder, if he hadn't camped outside the Great Jue Court that day... he, Dili Youjie, would still be that pathetic wretch with laughable cultivation. Even now, as a cultivator in the Foundation Establishment Realm, his terror was greater than ever, afraid it was all a dream.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him, a plan forming in his mind.

'Geng Metal... his strength is barely passable, but his loyalty is commendable.'

He made a decision. He casually retrieved a 'Geng Metal' dharma artifact from his sleeve. It was a small, palm-sized golden sword.

"This is just a 'Geng Metal' Dharma sword," he instructed. "It's used for casting spell arts, not for direct clashes. Keep it well. Since Que'Wan was the one who brought you here, you will follow her from now on. Run errands for her, deliver messages... you'll be reliable for that."

"Yes!"

The Eastern Yue man departed in a state of terrified gratitude, clutching the sword to his chest as tears streamed down his face.

Li Zhouwei took a single, gentle step forward. The world dissolved and reformed around him, and he was standing inside a pagoda crackling with lightning. He closed his eyes briefly, the light of the sun and moon swirling at his side. He had arrived in the Grotto-Heaven.

A Daoist Master in white-gold robes sat leisurely inside a brilliant, glowing pavilion, carefully reading a scroll. A fist-sized Li Fire sparrow perched obediently on his shoulder. He had clearly been waiting for some time.

Li Zhouwei bowed. "Grand-Uncle!"

Li Ximing smiled, saying nothing. With a flip of his hand, he produced a jade bottle. "Six Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills!" he replied. "With the ones you already have, this should be enough for more than a decade!"

With the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll and the Profound Shell Flower-Leaves in the hands of an Alchemist as superb as Li Ximing, the number of pills was naturally delightful.

Li Zhouwei accepted them with thanks and began to calculate. "Grand-Uncle, you received six Neck Feathers back then. You entrusted three to Sun-Worshipping Mountain, Chen Yin traded for two, and one was just traded for the Profound Shell Flower-Leaves. Do you have any remaining?"

Li Ximing smiled. "My original guess was correct. That cave-mansion is a real treasure trove. Three more have condensed since then, and adding the one that took a full year to form before Senior Liu Changdie arrived, I had four in hand. Now, having traded one for the Profound Shell Flower-Leaves, there are still three left."

But at the mention of this, he became somewhat anxious.

"We must be more frugal, however. The massive, continuous acquisition of Wall-Sinking Water has left us short twice in a row. It took over six months to gather a full supply, wasting a lot of time. I estimate it will only get more difficult... Because of this, I sent people to check the markets in the Eastern Sea, and they finally went to the Xinyu Archipelago."

Li Zhouwei looked up, intrigued.

Li Ximing chuckled. "We even met that Daoist Master Kuang Yu... and just managed to gather the next six-month supply of Wall-Sinking Water. She’s an interesting one. She achieved the Dao through a Life Divine Ability and managed to withdraw from this whole struggle unscathed. Now she has a territory of her own."

Li Zhouwei nodded slowly. "Is Senior Liu... planning to cultivate in the Wave-Suppressing Mansion?"

Li Ximing hesitated. "I wouldn't call it cultivating. His Dao-path is severed. His only real interest now is researching formations. The great formation at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion is incredibly profound; it's more than enough to keep him occupied. I expect he'll be in the vicinity for years."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "If that's the case, I have two matters to discuss with you, Grand-Uncle."

"First, the Wall-Sinking Water is extremely important. We can't keep scrambling to gather it day by day. 'Water Mansion' originates from the Western Sea. I must ask you to make a trip and establish a stable trade route, rather than having us run around randomly in a place where 'Water Mansion' is scarce."

This sparked an idea in Li Ximing. "Perfect. We just got a new batch of Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills. There's Yangya in the Western Sea. Other cultivators might not know, but I'm a Bright Yang cultivator myself—I know exactly how potent this pill is. He'll be desperate for it. Although he doesn't want contact with our family, we now have Daoist Friend Changdie. He can represent us!"

Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up. "Wonderful... Wall-Sinking Water alone might not be enough of a trade, but that fellow has been at the Purple Mansion Realm for many years. He must have other Bright Yang treasures. If we can exchange spirit pills for them, it's practically a zero-cost trade for our family."

Even though Yangya held a deep grudge against their family, neither Daoist Master cared. Getting good treasures was what mattered. They exchanged a look, and Li Ximing grinned.

"Leave it to me!"

Li Zhouwei changed the subject. "Second, the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. Though it's in a barren land, we're realizing its divine-profound value is immeasurable. It could be the foundation for the clan's rise, and it's also an excellent escape route."

Li Ximing's expression turned solemn as Li Zhouwei explained the situation with the Yuan family. He was aghast. "The Wu State is just descending into chaos, and now the Yang clan is striking again? These are omens of a great upheaval."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "I've been considering this recently. We must prepare our escape route early. Zongquan Island was where I had my breakthrough and it's now saturated with Bright Yang energy, drawing a lot of attention. It might be useful later. But the Wave-Suppressing Mansion is the other key. It still lacks a strong figure to manage it... Grand-Uncle... I want to send Que'Wan."

"Que'Wan?"

Li Ximing mused.

Li Zhouwei continued, "The Wave-Suppressing Mansion already has a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator guarding it, and you visit often. It's located among remote barbarian tribes, making it safer than the mainland, especially this turbulent riverbank. Since it's our escape route, we can let Que'Wan go there. One, to manage it properly. Two, to let her cultivate in peace and prepare for the Purple Mansion Realm."

Li Zhouwei had clearly been pondering this for some time. "I'll have Dili Youjie accompany her. He was king of the Eastern Yue for decades. The Eastern Sea doesn't care about one's background, which actually makes it easier to operate. He can handle the trivial matters for her."

"Very well..." Li Ximing hesitated for a moment before agreeing.

Li Zhouwei then took the golden slip for Emperor Qi's Light from his sleeve and handed it over. "I have achieved initial mastery of this spell art. My insights and annotations are all recorded on the slip for your reference, Grand-Uncle."

"Good..." Li Ximing accepted it, clearly delighted.

Although it only took Li Zhouwei nine months to master Emperor Qi's Light, it was an exceedingly complex spell art. They had arranged this nine months ago when they first acquired it; Li Ximing had not started training it, focusing instead on refining his immortal foundation. He was waiting for Li Zhouwei to master it and pass on the annotated slip, which would save him many detours.

And while Li Ximing had been tempering his immortal foundation, he hadn't wasted the fragments of time. With the clan's affairs off his mind, he felt liberated. He had been cultivating peacefully, occasionally discussing the Dao with other Daoist Masters to improve his Dao-Profundity. It was a comfortable life! Furthermore, he had obtained the Li Fire, a rare and wondrous treasure, and had been secretly studying the Great Parting's White Brilliance. He could now condense four instances of Great Parting's Red Radiance!

'About one per year... even if it gets harder, it will take at most another seven or eight years to gather ten. Then the power of the spell art will ascend to a whole new level!'

Now, accepting the golden slip, Li Ximing exuded an air of carefree leisure. He grinned. "Perfect. I'll just go to the Lake to collect the Wall-Sinking Water, and I'll be right back to get her!"




# Chapter 967, People from the Past

The giant turtle and the soft-shell turtle embraced, black and white light interweaving.

A deep blue, gold-patterned wine vessel shimmered, casting a faint, cold glow. In the center of the scene, a pool of white water rippled with multicolored light. A middle-aged man, draped in a white fur cloak with a precious pearl at his waist, leaned against the pool's edge, his eyes tightly shut.

Three vertical, silver marks flashed between his brows. One hand pressed against the pool as a soft, white, illusory radiance poured down, surging across the water's surface. The Daoist Master began to ponder inwardly,

'I've finally sensed a resonance. Through the Vault-Beam Silver... I should be able to glimpse the things that were placed in that 'locked' state.'

As he was deep in thought, a man descended from the sky, small crimson sparrows circling around him. The man smiled and said,

"Senior Liu!"

Liu Changdie looked up, the radiance of his divine ability gradually dimming. He replied,

"Ximing! You're out of seclusion. How did it go?"

"I made some progress!"

Li Ximing was quite satisfied with the results of his cultivation session and replied with a smile,

"This Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array... how is it?"

Liu Changdie's expression grew solemn. He replied,

"I've also achieved some results... This array... is truly astonishing."

He gently turned his hand, and clusters of light fell into his sleeve. Liu Changdie said seriously,

"Ximing, you know that my Vault Metal Dao Lineage is one of 'hiding and storing.' Harmonising and Vault Lock is a concept with extremely broad symbolism. Most cave-mansions, Grotto-heavens, and Mystic Realms incorporate this 'vault lock' symbolism..."

"This is why when predecessors cast an array over a mountain, later generations can't find it. Minor cultivators, small sects, or even rogue cultivators and demonic cultivators can only find small cave-mansions by pure chance or incredible luck. They shouldn't even dream of finding one at the Purple Mansion Realm level.

"Even if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of a much higher cultivation base comes searching, they need a confirmed location. They must either use a divine ability or an illusion-breaking technique to probe inch by inch, and only then do they have a chance. To this day, a vast number of predecessor Grotto-mansions and Mystic Realms remain lost."

He said softly,

"And my Vault Metal Dao Lineage, which symbolizes the 'storage' aspect of arrays, has a natural advantage in this. The benefits I've managed to acquire over the years are all related to my Dao Lineage."

"Oh?!"

Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then asked,

"Does that mean you have the ability to break arrays, Senior?"

"Not at all!"

Liu Changdie shook his head.

"Harmonising and Vault Lock is no joke. Too many of Vault Metal's wonders have already been hidden away. I can't 'break' anything; I can only 'see' and 'take.' If you want to talk about array-breaking, that's the domain of Renewing Wood and Manifestations Earth. Although Vault-Beam Silver is closely tied to formations... it doesn't excel at destroying them."

The Wood Virtue in the world is in decline. Of the Wood Dao Lineages today, Horn Wood is the most famous. The only others known are the Si family's Upright Wood and Daoist Master Luo's Gathering Wood. There's been no news of the other two." When Li Ximing heard this, he replied,

"I've heard a little... Renewing Wood... what kind of Dao Lineage is it?"

Liu Changdie shook his head and smiled,

"It's not considered a powerful Dao Lineage, nor is it famous. It's just that those of us who cultivate array formations must remember these few array-breaking Dao Lineages. As for Manifestations Earth, I only noted it specifically because I heard the Viewing Pavilion faction's Array-Foundation Sundering Blades belongs to it.

"Traces of Renewing Wood today can mostly only be found through old Dao Lineage records or the transformations of spiritual items. As for the final Wood, it has vanished without a trace..."

He mentioned the Viewing Pavilion Dao Lineage, lowered his head slightly, and continued,

"As for my Vault Metal, besides being helpful for constructing arrays, I'm currently having Zhaojing take a look at the treasure hidden below."

He pressed one hand on the pool's edge, and his divine ability surged. The pool water immediately boiled and rapidly turned transparent.

The transparency spread, moving from top to bottom, gradually rendering even the white pool floor invisible. Amidst this transformation, a deep, azure-blue light grew increasingly intense.

Liu Changdie took the opportunity to explain,

"Purple Mansion Realm spirit arrays are typically anchored by a Purple Mansion Realm-level spiritual item. Some powerful grand arrays even have several Spiritual Artifacts at their core. Before deployment, these are gathered in the array-disk and can't be seen clearly. Only when the array is active do they roam, occasionally settling into a critical node."

He made a slight grasping motion, as if strenuously seizing something. The transparency beneath him expanded, revealing layer upon layer of intricate array patterns and incantations. Thousands upon thousands of small flags were fixed within the formation.

The small flags, black with white patterns, pulsed with a dense radiance. They were arranged in a tight, swirling vortex, the base of every flag pointing toward the same center.

And at that center, a small, azure-blue orb was held fast by the Vault-Beam Silver divine ability. It emitted a crystal-clear radiance. Streams of Water Mansion power poured into the orb from above, underwent layers of refinement, and were then released anew.

"Hm?"

As this scene materialized, Li Ximing frowned, his expression filled with shock and uncertainty. Liu Changdie was clearly just as surprised. He shot to his feet and exclaimed,

"This..."

The object anchoring this grand array, the item at its critical node, the very source of the Feather Transformation Pool... it wasn't a spiritual item, it was a Spiritual Artifact!

Li Ximing's pupils suddenly dilated.

Although he hadn't taken the azure-blue orb in his hand, its shimmering light and the faint, intricate patterns on its surface were clear to him. It was perfectly integrated with the grand array, likely an item from its master's Dao Lineage. A powerful sense of familiarity washed over him, and he suddenly recalled a name,

'Li Quantao!'

Although this orb was far more magnificent and was a mysterious azure-blue rather than white, it was clearly of the same origin as the Wall Water Pill Li Quantao had possessed all those years ago!

'There must be a connection between them. The Wall Water Pill might even have been crafted in imitation of this very artifact!

'Although Li Ximing hadn't had much contact with the manby the time they properly met, Ximing was already in the Purple Mansion Realm and had no need to associate with himhe had seen that famous dharma artifact all those years ago. He had secretly coveted it, and the sight was burned into his memory!

'How can it be related to him? The Hongxue Sect? The Li Clan?

'No!

A strange light flashed in Li Ximing's eyes as he mentally sifted through every piece of related information. Finally, he remembered.

'The Wall Water Pill is an ancient dharma artifact... it was obtained by Li Encheng from the Secret Enclosure Dao Lineage. It has nothing to do with the Hongxue Li Clan... Which means... tracing it back to its source... the master of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion might be a cultivator from the Secret Enclosure Dao Lineage...

'And according to Brother Zhi (Li Xizhi), the Wall Water Pill was actually an imitation of the Great Liang Martial Emperor's two orbs, Converging Water and Water Mansion. But it only ended up as a dharma artifact. This one before me... this must be the one imitated from the original Dharma Treasure. That Wall Water Pill is just an imitation of an imitation...

'Great Liang and Encompassing Profoundity... I wonder what the connection is?'

While Li Ximing was lost in thought, Liu Changdie was staring intently at the endless vortex of small flags. He scanned them one by one, his astonishment growing, and asked,

"Daoist Friend, do you recognize these flags?!"

Li Ximing glanced over, slightly puzzled, but Liu Changdie said in a heavy tone,

"Years ago, when I went to your esteemed clan to set up an array, I was fortunate enough to be able to study your clan's array flags. They also had white patterns on a black body... That set came from Wan Huaqian and was called the [White Feather Catalpa Flag].

"And the small flags materializing in this array are seventy or eighty percent similar to them!"

"Hm?"

It took Li Ximing a moment to place the name Wan Huaqian. He frowned and said,

"The Wan family ancestor? That array-path genius, Wan Huaqian?"

The Wan family had once been neighbors with the Li Clan; they were, in fact, the first family the Li Clan had encountered. Li Ximing had naturally heard of them. At his words, Liu Changdie nodded hesitantly and sat back down, his expression grim.

"No wonder... no wonder..."

He muttered,

"The master of the inheritance Wan Huaqian received must be inextricably linked to the master of this mansion! The [White Feather Catalpa Flag] was his bonded artifact, forged by his own hand. It's impossible for it to resemble this array for no reason... It seems he really did obtain its legacy..."

Liu Changdie's gaze grew heavy as countless thoughts raced through his mind. Suddenly, he asked,

"Ximing, do you know of the Secret Enclosure Dao Lineage?"

'Just as I thought!'

Li Ximing inwardly understood and replied,

"Of course. It's one of the great secrets of Encompassing Profoundity."

As soon as he said this, Liu Changdie knew he was well-informed. He sighed.

"Exactly... I noted that this array has the distinct style of Encompassing Profoundity. Now, seeing that the orb below is so similar to the Wall Water Pill from the Secret Enclosure Sect, I'm certain they share the same origin...

Liu Changdie pinched his fingers, making a quick calculation. His smile grew stiff as he muttered,

"Wan Huaqian fell over three hundred years ago. Calculating the dates... that seems awfully close to the time when Chi Wei and Li Encheng went to the Secret Enclosure Sect..."

"Ah?"

Li Ximing was stunned. Although he was from Jiangnan, Moongaze Lake was somewhat isolated, different from places like Lixia or Simin, and he heard far fewer rumors. Still, he understood the implication and asked in a low voice,

"Senior, are you implying... the origin of this whole affair might lie with Wan Huaqian?"

Liu Changdie laughed coldly, as if some old rumor had just been confirmed.

"To put it nicely, one might say a great opportunity manifested, allowing Wan Huaqian to obtain the Secret Enclosure inheritance, while the Azure Pond just so happened to find a clue to it. But to put it bluntly, who knows how Chi Wei and Li Encheng _really_ got into that Secret Enclosure Mystic Realm?

"Wan Huaqian was a true prodigy of his generation. He built several incredible arrays, and even a high-level figure from Azure Pond came to see them, proclaiming him a genius. That's what cemented his fame; everyone knew him after that. But don't you think that Azure Pond bigwig went back and reported something? Because soon after, Wan Huaqian diedextremely abruptly, while still in the Foundation Establishment Realm. And right after that, Chi Wei and Li Encheng entered the Secret Enclosure Mystic Realm... Heh heh!"

Li Ximing frowned to himself, listening as Liu Changdie's eyes grew sharp.

"I always heard that the [White Feather Catalpa Flag] was in Li Encheng's possession. When I later came to your clan and found you had a set, I was confused. Thinking about it now... Li Encheng must have obtained several dharma artifacts from the Secret Enclosure, and the rogue cultivators simply mistook the array flags he heldwhich shared the same originfor Wan Huaqian's [White Feather Catalpa Flag].

"The methods of that crowd are the same as always. They use someone up, but they still keep the Wan family around just to see if there are any lingering trump cards. They let them be for a hundred-odd years... Then, only when Chi Wei was near the end of his life, they stopped paying attention and casually cleaned up the potential loose end."

Liu Changdie clearly held a deep loathing for the great powers of Jiangnan and Jiangbei, always assuming the most sinister motives. Li Ximing was more moderate. He felt that while Liu's analysis wasn't entirely objective, it was mostly logical. He could only sigh.

"If Wan Huaqian had kept a low profile back then and hidden his inheritance, perhaps he could have carved out his own path."

Liu Changdie merely waved his hand dismissively, his gaze fixed on the Spiritual Artifact at the base of the array.

"This is a remarkable treasure down here. I can retrieve it, but doing so would destroy the Feather Transformation Pool."

The Feather Transformation Pool was critical to them right now, and Li Ximing was naturally unwilling to sacrifice it. He pondered for a moment before asking,

"If, one day... I need to remove that Spiritual Artifact for use, could I replace it with a Water Mansion spiritual item? Even if the Feather Transformation Pool dissipates, could we at least preserve the grand array and prevent it from collapsing?"

Liu Changdie stared intently at the array, thinking for a long time before replying,

"It would be very difficult right now. But give me a few decades to master this array formation, and I might be able to make some modifications. By then, we might find a much better solution."

"Good!"

Li Ximing nodded in delight.

"I'll go retrieve the clan's [White Feather Catalpa Flag] for you to study, Senior!"

...

Azure Pond Peak was shrouded in clouds and mist, Pristine Water drifting on the breeze. The faint sound of a spring could be heard. The Sect Master's Hall was empty. Only after crossing the wide courtyard could one see a lone figure sitting on the steps.

He was a middle-aged man with small eyes and a long face, possessing the general air of a sect disciple. At this moment, however, his face was etched with worry, his eyes filled with anxiety. He sat forlornly on the steps, completely at a loss.

This was the current Sect Master of the Azure Pond Sect, Lin Wuning.

Lin Wuning himself wasn't particularly capable; he really only knew how to cultivate. He normally relied on the support of the Ning Clan and Li Yuanqin to maintain stability. But ever since Ning Wan had entered seclusion, the Ning Clan had fallen into disarray. And now that Li Yuanqin had also entered seclusion for his breakthrough, Lin Wuning hadn't known a single day of peace.

He should have forced Li Yuanqin to stay, but Li Yuanqin's talent was considerable. He had served diligently for many years, never once shirking his duties. His scheduled breakthrough date had already been postponed year after year. Now, at this critical juncture, it simply couldn't be delayed any further, and Lin Wuning had no choice but to let him go.

The moment Li Yuanqin left, the Ning Clan began running around like headless chickens. In the past, Lin Wuning only had to give an order, and Li Yuanqin would handle it efficiently. Now that he had to manage things himself, he was completely overwhelmed.

Just now, he had unrolled the scroll in his hand and read a report from Qin Xian, requesting a transfer to the Eastern Sea.

Qin Xian was from the Si family. With Li Yuanqin absent, Lin Wuning was already nursing a headache, trying to figure out how to respond to the request. Suddenly, he heard footsteps approaching the hall. He looked up quickly, only to see Qin Xian himself approaching, his face grim. He rushed in from the mountain path without so much as a greeting.

"You!"

Lin Wuning shot to his feet in alarm, but he caught a flash of contempt in Qin Xian's eyes as the man stepped lightly to the side, assuming the posture of one welcoming a guest.

The anger that flared in Lin Wuning's chest was immediately extinguished by the gesture, replaced by shock and suspicion.

'What is this? Which Daoist Master has arrived?'

But before he could react, he froze, staring dumbfounded.

A man in green robes was strolling up the mountain path. He had a middle-aged appearance, with a square face and a long nose, but his steps were light and carefree. A longsword was strapped to his back, a scroll was tied at his waist, and he was gazing at Lin Wuning with a smile.

A divine ability's radiance, so dense it had not yet been retracted, still pulsed around him. It caused the trees on the peak to stir, as if they were standing in a vast forest. Illusory mulberry leaves seemed to fall from the sky, drifting past his sleeves.

His mere presence on the path commanded all attention, as if he were seated on a throne of honor. The divine ability he exuded was steady and orthodox, the mark of a high-level cultivator from a major immortal sect.

Lin Wuning felt as if he had been struck by lightning. His mind went blank. He finally understood Qin Xian's smugness. His legs gave way, and he collapsed to his knees with a thud, crying out in terror,

"Greetings... Daoist Master!"




# Chapter 968: Wan Xue

Si Yuanli!

The man before them was none other than Si Yuanli, who had been in seclusion for many years seeking to attain a divine ability!

The Si Family had a long and profound heritage. Si Boxiu was a Great Daoist Master, a figure who suppressed entire regions, and he possessed numerous methods. He had also obtained the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill in Anhuai Heaven and made many preparations. Now, Si Yuanli’s divine ability was complete. Vibrant and full of spirit, he had clearly reached the Purple Mansion Realm!

He beamed, the very picture of high spirits. The scroll at his waist looked ordinary, yet a faint radiance flowed from it, making it difficult to look at directly.

“Lin Wuning… Where is Daoist Friend Ning?”

Lin Wuning remained kneeling, not daring to raise his head. He trembled like a leaf in the wind, stammering for a long time without managing to form a single sentence. He even forgot the proper honorifics, only managing to force out,

“Daoist Master… in seclusion…”

Although Qin Xian stood respectfully in place, his presence was far stronger. He looked down on Lin Wuning with a cold sneer in his heart.

'With no Daoist Master to back you up, and now that Li Yuanqin is gone… what does that make you, Lin Wuning! You’ve been pampered since childhood, a good-for-nothing placeholder!'

While Li Yuanqin was a member of the Ning family, he had real ability and influence. In terms of seniority, he was even the young uncle of the Li family's current Daoist Master. If Li Yuanqin had taken the position of Sect Master, Qin Xian wouldn't have said a word and would have certainly offered his reminders respectfully. But in his eyes, Lin Wuning was merely a fortunate opportunist, and he refused to give him even a shred of courtesy.

Seeing this pathetic display, even Si Yuanli frowned. This was, after all, the Sect Master appointed by the Ning family.

“Is there truly no one left in the sect!” he said.

Lin Wuning endured the humiliation, forcing a subservient smile as he respectfully moved to one side. Si Yuanli’s expression turned sorrowful. He turned his head slightly and saw a figure rushing frantically up the steps, dropping to his knees before the platform. The man was weeping with joy, crying out,

“Congratulations, Daoist Master… Congratulations…”

Si Yuanli glanced over and recognized Si Tongyi. Kneeling beside him was a handsome and spirited youth, his joy equally uncontrollable. It was Li Xizhi's youngest disciple, Si Xunhui.

Si Yuanli smiled.

“That you two are still here is truly my greatest joy!”

Both men laughed joyfully, and the hall instantly filled with a lively atmosphere. Si Yuanli walked into the hall as if he owned the place and sat in the main seat. Qin Xian dutifully served him hot tea. Si Yuanli took a long, satisfying sip, only to see Si Tongyi present a jade pendant with a somber expression.

“The Old Ancestor left this jade pendant before he passed. He said it holds a few words for you, Daoist Master. None of us have been able to open it…”

Si Yuanli’s eyes immediately reddened. He took the pendant as if it were a priceless treasure, his hands trembling. Closing his eyes, he listened for a moment before hot tears streamed down his face.

“Among all the Purple Mansion Realm masters, only the Great Master’s affairs were left in perfect order… He wasn't selfish and scrambling at the last minute like Changxi. He wasn't full of resentment with a dark, cruel personality like Yuansu. And he certainly wasn't tyrannical like Yuanwu… Without the Old Ancestor's many treasures and preparations, how could I have possibly attained my divine ability today…”

The Si family members on both sides were visibly moved. Although Qin Xian felt absolutely no emotional connection to Daoist Master Yuanxiu, he managed to squeeze out a few tears as well. Si Yuanli, however, had received a clue from the jade pendant's message.

“Where is Daoist Master Ning?” he asked urgently.

Si Tongyi took a step back, knelt, and replied, “Daoist Master Ning used a secret technique in the north to kill a demonic cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm. It's said she left a million corpses in her wake. She went into seclusion immediately after and hasn't been seen since… It seems she is not in the Pristine Pool. Even Lin Wuning doesn't know her whereabouts.”

“Oh?”

Si Yuanli set his cup down. As he listened to Si Tongyi recount the events of the past, the more he heard, the more uneasy he became. His expression gradually turned grave.

“Kui Qi has fallen? And the two gates are sealed?”

“Qi Lanyan? And Profound Peak’s Kong Tingyun!”

He looked up, hesitant. In the years he had been in seclusion, the world outside had been turned upside down. Counting through the names, there was no one left for him to even visit.

“How did things reach such a state.”

He pondered for a long time, a chill creeping into his heart.

'What kind of technique is this? The Pristine Water overflowing, a million corpses… Is that truly a divine ability that Ning Wan possesses? And why has she disappeared? This isn't right… There is definitely a problem!'

Si Yuanli was not a simple man. He secretly sensed that something was amiss and asked,

“Has Li Zhouwei achieved the Dao?”

“Yes…” Si Tongyi replied cautiously.

“He has achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, and his Daoist Title is Minghuang. We hear he excels in combat. He has clashed with the northern cultivators several times, and although his divine ability is not as profound, he has not been at a disadvantage in the slightest!”

A smile immediately touched Si Yuanli’s lips. He looked kindly at Si Xunhui, who was standing to the side.

“And how is your Master?”

Si Xunhui replied joyfully, “Master is cultivating in the Eastern Sea, currently seeking an opportunity to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!”

Although Si Xunhui was young, he was not shallow. As Li Xizhi’s disciple, his identity was complex; he could even count the Li family as his backing. He was the only one in the Si family who was, from the bottom of his heart, friendly toward the Li family.

Unlike his two disciple-brothers, who felt a need to look after Li Zhouluo, Si Xunhui understood that while he felt affection for his Master and his Master's descendants, affection was one thing; the family he truly needed to align with was the Li family. Li Zhouluo was merely a stepping stone. His past actions—secretly revealing information, cultivating a friendship with Li Wushao, and even intentionally finding reasons to rest at the Li family estate—were all for this single purpose.

By reading Si Yuanli's expression, he understood that the Daoist Master needed something from the Li family. His heart began to pound with anticipation.

'This must be my ladder to success! If the Si and Li families can maintain a long-term friendship, I will undoubtedly be the one who benefits the most…'

Si Yuanli’s expression was grim. He remained silent for a long time, his mind racing.

'The Great Master has left and his whereabouts are unknown. The Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour has lost one Peacock after another in recent years, and everyone in the Peacock Sea is living in fear… I never expected the mainland to be in such chaos as well…'

'The Old Ancestor's instructions… He said that if I successfully reached the Purple Mansion Realm, first, I must absolutely not get involved in the mess of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Second, I must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the Yang family's affairs. I am to protect myself on the mainland, observe the changing situation, preserve the clan, and seek the True Law of Wood. Perhaps he was referring to this very situation.'

Although Si Yuanli had been in seclusion for many years, his Old Ancestor had left him a great deal. Among the Three Yuans, Daoist Master Yuanxiu had possessed the highest cultivation and the most illustrious background. In the latter half of his life, his outstanding divine ability and mastery of talisman arts had allowed him to amass an immense fortune. Si Yuanli had inherited it all… an inheritance that likely surpassed even Ning Wan’s by a wide margin!

Now, after just a brief assessment and asking about a few names, he began to scheme.

“The Qi family… They were also a great family back in the Zhou era and had some connections with my family. But times have changed… Back then, everyone followed the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition… What a pity!”

He stroked his beard, his mind deep in thought.

'Now Li Zhouwei has also succeeded… It was his time. This was bound to happen, ever since Li Ximing first broke through.'

His expression was heavy as his gaze swept across the hall. He gradually came to a realization.

'Even though I've returned, I absolutely cannot be tied down to the Azure Pond. I can't find Ning Wan, but the Li family is still here. I should go and ask them for clarity. The Old Ancestor mentioned he left a favor with the Li family, and even a spiritual item of Pure Qi. The time to use it should be now…'

He took a sip of tea and glanced at Qin Xian, who was still kneeling to the side.

'It's no wonder Lin Wuning is so useless. Ning Wan must have treated the Azure Pond like a hot potato she couldn't wait to discard… Good, good. We cultivated a useful pawn long ago, so our own family's disciples don't have to get their hands dirty.'

It wasn't that Lin Wuning absolutely had to be replaced. But Si Yuanli intended to consolidate the Azure Pond, use it to handsomely enrich his own disciples, and cultivate a few trusted confidants. He naturally couldn't leave such a mediocre person in charge.

He looked over with a smile, lifted his chin, and said, “Guest Retainer Qin, go and take over Lin Wuning’s duties.”

Qin Xian’s body shook. He looked completely unprepared, even finding it hard to believe. He had assumed the position of Sect Master would inevitably go to Si Tongyi, and he would be lucky to get some scraps. How could he have landed such a position? His mouth went dry.

“This… how can this be…”

He secretly glanced at Si Tongyi, only to see Si Tongyi smile and say,

“With Guest Retainer Qin handling matters… everyone can rest assured!”

Seeing Si Tongyi’s smile, Qin Xian was instantly overjoyed. He declared with conviction, “I will definitely serve the Daoist Master to the death!”

Si Tongyi didn't know Si Yuanli's true intentions, nor was he completely without desire for the Sect Master position. But with his own family elder having become a Daoist Master, and being the only junior present, his position was already secure as a mountain. Why would he need to fight for this? He smiled and saw Qin Xian out, then returned.

He saw Si Yuanli say leisurely, “The younger disciples should not hold any positions in the sect. Find a few excuses and send them all to the Southern Sea. Prepare to extricate ourselves from the situation.”

“Yes…” Si Tongyi was secretly alarmed but agreed. As he was about to leave, Si Yuanli called him back.

He pondered for a long time before instructing, “Send a man to the Li family…”

He hesitated slightly, then his gaze shifted to Si Xunhui. As if having made a decision, his tone changed, and he looked at Si Xunhui with a smile.

“Xunhui, you will accompany me to the Li family!”

Si Xunhui smiled and agreed, careful not to show off how close he was to the Li family in front of Si Yuanli. He simply replied obediently,

“Reporting to the Daoist Master… this junior believes we should first send word of my Daoist Master's title…”

Si Yuanli stroked his beard and smiled. “Ning Wan didn't play by the Azure Pond’s rules, so I don't need to either. We'll just call it… ‘Azure-Flash’!”

Both men acknowledged the name. A look of extremely deep sorrow flashed across Si Yuanli’s face. He sighed heavily.

“But before that, there is one more thing to do… I heard the Old Ancestor failed his breakthrough in the Southern Sea. I must go to the Southern Sea to pay my respects, and then return to the clan's cenotaph to report the good news to him!”

...

“The Eastern Sea… Wave-Suppressing Mansion…”

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain, white flowers bloomed everywhere. A Daoist Master sat at a table, wreathed in bright light and True Fire, delicately sipping his tea. Another, taller man stood nearby, clad in armor with his hands behind his back.

Li Que'wan knelt to one side, looking somewhat surprised.

“I obey the two Daoist Masters' decree…”

Li Ximing just smiled. “The spiritual energy there isn't bad. They are all doing this for your own good.”

Li Que'wan replied hastily, “This junior did not mean to imply otherwise! It’s just that… if this junior goes to cultivate in peace, all the family's affairs will trouble my brothers.”

Li Ximing shook his head with a laugh, but Li Que'wan continued, “This junior has another matter to report.”

“Oh?” Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

Li Que'wan reported, “This junior went to the Wilderness a few days ago, intending to see my younger brothers before I enter seclusion. However, while I was calculating the spiritual energy, I detected several fluctuations. My calculations were wrong multiple times, and my Immortal Foundation issued a warning that a hidden seal was quietly being undone. I fear a major change is imminent.”

“The Wilderness?”

Li Ximing’s first reaction was naturally the Wanling Heaven across the river, but hearing it was in the Wilderness, he felt a flicker of suspicion. Li Zhouwei had already turned his head, a contemplative look on his face.

Li Ximing understood immediately.

'If Que'wan discovered an anomaly, she must have used an Immortal Artifact to investigate. She must have seen some clue that she cannot easily speak of, but she is certain of her findings.'

He exchanged a glance with Li Zhouwei, and together they stepped into the Great Void. Within moments, they had arrived in the Great Void above the Wilderness.

Li Zhouwei scanned the area, his divine ability brushing over the land. He nodded thoughtfully.

“There is indeed an anomaly!”

Li Ximing’s illusion-breaking arts were far inferior to Li Zhouwei’s, but he had already invoked a law and swept his gaze across the area. The world seemed to clear, and far below in the darkness, a faint, illusory white light appeared, undulating like ripples on water.

Although he had never seen this specific color, it felt familiar. Li Ximing’s heart skipped a beat.

“A formation?”

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly. The two descended deeper into the Great Void, following a spiritual meridian downward. As they went, the fluctuations in the Great Void grew more intense. Soon, they saw a mass of gentle white light, pulsing violently.

Li Ximing extended his senses. The Great Void here corresponded to an ice-cave deep underground. It was pitch-black, filled with a biting chill, and covered in ice crystals. The Baleful Earth qi was incredibly dense.

“So there’s a space deep underground…”

Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes slowly swept the area. Suddenly, he heard his uncle’s voice, transmitted grimly via divine ability,

“Someone is here.”

Sure enough, a woman in white stood within the ice-cave.

Her hair was unbound, cascading freely. She had bright eyes and a fine nose, a face of extreme beauty. Her skin was like new-fallen snow, her aura like frost—a chilling purity that assaulted the senses. She stood ethereally in the cold, looking as if she were condensed from a blizzard, wreathed in a biting, glacial wind.

Cultivating Cold Qi was known to enhance one's appearance and temperament, and her beauty was truly exquisite. It was a coldness that perfectly matched the elegance of an eastern woman, so striking it made one forget the mortal world.

Li Ximing had seen countless beautiful women in his life, but his first glance at her still left him stunned. But then, the intense radiance of divine ability flooded his vision, and in the next instant, his heart seized.

Four distinct divine abilities formed of Cold Qi were coalesced around her body, coiling and spinning with terrifying power.

He was inwardly aghast. 'A Great Daoist Master of the Cold Qi path?'

Many people in the world cultivated Cold Qi, but there were few Great Daoist Masters among them. In the next moment, Li Ximing knew exactly who she was.

Tianwan!

'Daoist Master Tianwan from Crimson Reef Island!'

At that very same instant, Tianwan, who had been meditating with her eyes closed, slowly opened them. She looked up, and her gaze seemed to pierce straight through the Great Void, landing upon the two men like falling snow.

Decades had passed, but her face had not changed in the slightest. The only difference was that the divine ability she had just crossed the immortal threshold to attain back then was now perfected, coiling around her like a raging blizzard.

Daoist Master Tianwan cultivated Cold Qi. Although the Cold Qi path had its flaws and she was not known for her combat prowess, she was still a Great Daoist Master. Her current strength might not compare to Changxiao or Wei Xuanyin, but she could handle an ordinary mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master with no problem at all.

And Crimson Reef Island and the Li family had a deep-seated grudge, almost a generational feud. Seeing Tianwan in this place, at this time, sent a chill straight down Li Ximing’s spine.

'Tianwan… is actually here… And from the looks of it, this isn't her first or second day!'

Li Ximing glanced at the ice-cave and already understood the situation.

There could only be a Great Void connection where spiritual energy existed. This place should have been sealed off from all spiritual energy to prevent detection by Purple Mansion Realm masters. Tianwan must have used some unknown method to find this place and has been silently guarding it, apparently waiting for something.

However, due to the violent changes within and the external pull of Wanling Heaven's impending descent, a trace of spiritual energy had begun to leak out, connecting with the spiritual energy of the outside world. The disturbance was minuscule, and it was deep underground. Tianwan had done her best to suppress it, so no one had noticed…

…Except that the Li family was situated right next door and had been developing the Wilderness for many years. Furthermore, Li Que'wan had achieved Houshenshu and cultivated shamanic arts, giving her perceptive abilities on par with a Purple Mansion Realm master. This was the only reason she had detected the subtle change.

Anyone else who sensed it would likely have dismissed it as an illusion. But Li Que'wan possessed an immortal artifact for dark probing, which allowed her to confirm her suspicions, giving her the confidence to report it to them.

But Tianwan, standing quietly in the ice-cave, showed no surprise. Nor did she radiate much hostility. She simply spoke, her voice soft,

“I knew you two Daoist friends would come sooner or later. Please, join me inside.”

Li Ximing hesitated, looking to Li Zhouwei. He saw his nephew frowning slightly as he sent a message with his divine ability,

'I fear this is about the Hongxue Gate.'

# Chapter 969: A Turn of Events

Frost gathered as biting cold energy rolled in waves.

"Crack."

The sound of fracturing ice echoed through the hollow cavern. The moment Li Zhouwei landed, the boundless darkness of the subterranean chamber was instantly banished by light.

As the two Daoist Masters from the Bright Yang Daoist Tradition set foot in this place, they realized just how dense the spiritual energies echoing through the cavern were. Despite being constantly suppressed and absorbed by a divine ability, the energies still roiled, faintly threatening to swell into a storm.

More importantly, these energies seemed to be gushing forth from the earth veins and water channels below. A single misstep, and they would likely erupt with uncontrollable violence.

'I wonder how long this has been suppressed... If it weren't kept in check, spiritual veins would have surfaced all over the region long ago. The lands above would be buried in a perpetual blizzard, a frozen waste.'

The light radiating from the two men's bodies caused the thick frost to show immediate signs of melting, threatening to shatter the hard-won equilibrium. However, a surrounding divine ability of swirling white light quickly converged, freezing all fluctuations in place.

Tianwan stood within the cavern, watching them with a spectral, unnerving gaze.

Li Ximing loathed her. He even harbored a deep-seated hatred. Setting aside the feud over Crimson Reef Island, there was the incident with the Radiant Sky Stone. While it had technically been an exchange, it had cost his brother, Li Xijun, his life. Li Ximing knew his own family had been the ones trying to seize the spiritual object, so they didn't stand on moral high ground, and he wasn't consumed by thoughts of revenge. Still, faced with the person directly responsible, a visceral, emotional revulsion was inevitable.

If Tianwan's divine ability weren't superior, and if she hadn't largely kept to herself these past years, and if she hadn't also become a bitter enemy of Changxiao... reason dictated it was unwise to antagonize both parties simultaneously. Otherwise, Li Ximing truly couldn't have mustered a single civil word for her.

Now that Li Zhouwei had made his landing, Li Ximing could only hang back, his face a cold mask, pointedly refusing to look at her. He listened as his junior spoke, his voice frigid,

"Senior... it is a significant breach of protocol to come to our Wilderness unannounced!"

But Tianwan merely stepped down from her central dais of ice and snow and said quietly,

"Have you two come seeking Li Quantao?"

At her words, Li Zhouwei's suspicion was confirmed. He linked his divine ability with his grand-uncle's, his thoughts racing,

'It really is Hongxue Gate!'

The former ruins of Hongxue Gate were located in the Wilderness. Li Zhouwei had his suspicions the moment he saw this Great Daoist Master, and now, upon hearing Li Quantao's name, he was certain.

Li Ximing's perpetually cold expression softened slightly, and his heart stirred.

'So it really is about Li Quantao... He was brother Xizhi's close friend. The Old Master was always worried about him... To think he was here all this time...'

Amidst the flashes of white light, another figure suddenly rushed in from a distance, materializing quickly. He wore a Daoist robe of dark-patterned blue and had a bitter expression on his face.

"Fellow Daoists!"

It was Daoist Master Xuanyi of Mount Jingyi!

He and Li Ximing had met once before and were on reasonably good terms. He never expected to run into him here! 'He must be in the area stabilizing the earth veins.' Li Ximing was slightly startled, musing internally,

'The Chunyi faction is powerful, and he's at odds with the Chunyi Dao Gate. It's only normal he'd seek help from Crimson Reef Island...'

Li Ximing's expression softened slightly as he nodded in greeting. The ice-and-snow beauty before them spoke, her voice low,

"Ning Wan was overwhelmed trying to manage the Azure Pond, which gave me the opening to capture Li Quantao at Chengshui Marsh. I have been searching for Hongxue's legacy for years and had already located this place. She fell a step behind and even lost Li Quantao. So, I came with Xuanyi to open this hidden cache."

"Since you two have found your way here, we can agree not to interfere with one another. Once my business is concluded, I will hand Li Quantao over to your clan. All I want is the Hongxue Dao Lineage."

She gave a slight smile, and the chill snowflakes swirling through the cavern seemed to drift upward at her expression.

"This is your territory, after all. Once this is done, I can allow your clan to choose one spiritual resource from the findings."

Li Ximing remained silent. Li Zhouwei, however, began to pace slowly, taking in the surrounding scenery of ice and frost as if admiring it. Then, he spoke quietly,

"You've sent quite a few messages to the Azure Pond, haven't you, Senior?"

Tianwan's smile slowly faded. She stared at the golden-eyed man, listening to the White Qilin's heavy voice reverberate through the cavern.

"Since Li Quantao has been in your hands for some time, Senior, and you are capable of opening this place yourself... why did you insist on cooperating with Senior Ning Wan?"

He turned his head, his illusion-piercing golden eyes boring straight into hers.

"Because this place is located in the Wilderness. Perhaps opening the Mystic Realm wouldn't cause a massive disturbance or attract too many Daoist Masters, but it would be impossible to hide from the masters of the Wilderness. At that time, the one guarding the Wilderness was Daoist Master Ning... You knew you couldn't hide it from her, Senior, so you chose to cooperate."

Tianwan didn't answer. Li Zhouwei continued,

"Which means... there must be more than one or two parties coveting the Hongxue Dao Lineage. The stakes must be so high that you can't easily deter lesser rivals, and there must be other, more troublesome powers who would be all too happy to intervene... That's why you had to keep this a secret."

Li Zhouwei stated calmly,

"You don't need to humor me, Senior. Our two families have no friendship to speak of. And this isn't just about us being the masters of the Wilderness. The truth is, if my family decides to speak up, we can ensure you never achieve your goal."

A cold expression finally crept onto Tianwan's face. "The Azure Pond is riddled with holes," she said flatly. "It can't keep a single secret."

Her voice was laced with ice.

"Must we become mortal enemies? It seems the two of you don't care about Li Quantao's life."

Their relationship was already poor, and Tianwan's power was sufficient to suppress them both. With the prize before them being so critical, she pressed on,

"Does the White Qilin still not see the path ahead? Changxiao is waiting for an opportunity, and you are the only one he fears. I have no desire to offend your clan, but if you insist on ruining my plans, will Zhaojing still be able to travel to the Eastern Sea? A hundred years from now, what path will be left for your Li Clan?"

The atmosphere between them plummeted to a freezing point. Xuanyi was mortified. He had been invited here to help, not to make an enemy of the Li Clan. He had the sudden, powerful urge to turn invisible and flee.

"By all means, Fellow Daoists, try me. Crimson Reef Island is nothing but a burden to me. But if the Li Clan is thrown into turmoil, how many of your kinsmen will die because of you?"

The words had barely left her mouth when the young man before her began to laugh.

His brow and eyes seemed to contort, sinking deep into his skull. Dense, platinum-white scales materialized around his neck. He smiled, revealing rows of fine, sharp white teeth, and his voice dropped to a hoarse, magnetic rumble, like the low growl of a beast.

"Dying for me... is that not as it should be?"

His pupils had transformed into perfect, gold-white rings. He grinned.

"Crimson Reef is a burden? Is Moongaze not? You dare try to hoard this prize for yourself, right in front of me? I will make you regret it."

A heavy silence fell. Xuanyi's expression froze, his eyes wide with disbelief as he stared at Li Zhouwei's transformed appearance.

'He really is the White Qilin!'

Tianwan, despite being so rudely rebuked, showed no outward sign of wrath. She only frowned, her heart simmering with annoyance. She knew she couldn't kill the man before her.

'He truly is the White Qilin...' she sighed internally. 'You can't judge him as a man. He has the heart of an autocrat, concerned only with himself.'

She truly felt a pang of apprehension. Li Zhouwei's status was unique. He would achieve his divine ability with incredible speed. And while his ultimate demise was certain, he would have a period of blinding brilliance before then. People like him always followed through on their threats. She, Tianwan, had betrayed the Golden Feather. She had no powerful backing, and a long life ahead of her. She intended to plot for the True Monarch realm in the years to come and could not afford a single misstep. Hadn't even Changxiao gone into hiding?

Never mind Tianwan; even Li Ximing was secretly startled. Xuanyi quickly stepped forward to play the peacemaker, hissing in a low voice,

"Wanling Heaven is nearly upon us! This is no time to fight and get injured... It's truly unwise..."

Tianwan narrowed her eyes and relented, her voice low.

"Since Ning Wan is in hiding, your clan is the only one left to guard the Wilderness. You can mask the disturbance for me. That is far better than having the powers from the North find this place, in which case none of us will get anything!"

"As for the Hongxue Dao Lineage, we will divide it."

She adopted a posture of grudging acceptance, though her eyes remained unsettlingly calm.

"I must have the cultivation manuals and the spell arts. Among the other items, there is also something I am determined to get!"

Li Ximing looked as if he was about to speak, but she cut him off, her voice haunting.

"I need more than just a Dao Lineage cultivation manual. If you push me too hard, Fellow Daoists, I might as well invite the Northern Daoist Traditions here. Trading the Hongxue Dao Lineage in exchange for my, Tianwan's, allegiance... I imagine they would find that a very attractive bargain."

"I must have this. I will not hesitate, even if it means getting entangled in the conflict between the North and South!"

She answered with iron certainty. Li Zhouwei merely sneered, flicked his sleeve, and turned to leave, his chilling words lingering behind him,

"I don't care how you two divide it. My family will be taking a share!"

With the "bad cop" gone, the atmosphere relaxed considerably. Li Ximing, unwilling to speak further with Tianwan, turned to Xuanyi and said flatly,

"Fellow Daoist, if you agree, we will stand guard above and mask the spiritual energy fluctuations."

Xuanyi, still trying to smooth things over, quickly agreed. "Yes... yes... We'll be imposing on your clan, then! There's still time... We can discuss the details later!"

Tianwan gazed at Li Ximing, her eyes bright and piercing, as if she understood the source of his enmity. "That incident back then," she said softly, "was indeed a plot against Tu Longjian, but wasn't your clan also leveraging the situation for your own gain? Sacrificing a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in exchange for a Radiant Sky Stone... it was just a transaction. Are you really going to lay all the blame on me? That same Radiant Sky Stone helped make you who you are, Li Ximing. Why cling so stubbornly to right and wrong?"

It would have been better if she had remained silent. At her words, Li Ximing, who had already started to leave, couldn't stop himself from spinning back around.

"If not for the divine ability's interference, Guo Hongyao would not have attacked, and you would not have intervened! None of this would have happened! Wasn't it only because your scheme failed that you 'compensated' us with the Radiant Sky Stone? How dare you speak of 'making' me!"

He threw the words at her grimly and vanished, stepping through the Great Void. As he left, he faintly perceived Tianwan frowning, a thoughtful expression on her face, as if she had gleaned some new information from his outburst.

---

Li Ximing rode a beam of light back into the mountain. Li Zhouwei was already seated within, calmly sipping tea. He smiled upon seeing him.

"That was a good way to rattle Tianwan and keep her from trying to control the situation. This matter is clearly vital to her. We have nothing to lose, whereas she does. The item is in our territory, so we deserve a share by right!"

Li Ximing's mood wasn't exactly stellar after that last exchange, but he quickly composed himself, managed a smile, and said,

"Don't be fooled by her sour expression. As long as she gets the key item she's after, she doesn't care about the rest. She was prepared to give us a share from the start. That was just a strategic retreat, feigning concession because she was afraid we'd push our luck. Otherwise, why would she have agreed so easily?"

Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement. Li Ximing then changed the subject. "Was that one of your transformation arts? With destiny bound to you, it was truly imposing."

In truth, Tianwan had looked terrified, and Li Ximing had felt uneasy himself. He'd only used the word "imposing" to be polite. Li Zhouwei, however, merely waved it off. "It looks intimidating, but the 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' is far from complete. It's nothing. To be compared to the ancient White Qilins, I'd need to be at the peak of the divine ability realm. If 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' were perfected, I might be able to borrow a fraction of its power and tap into its unique marvels."

"I see."

Li Ximing took a seat and refilled Li Zhouwei's tea. As he sent for Li Jianglong to come up, he sighed.

"I know... If the situation weren't so unstable, we wouldn't have to play along with her. I just don't know how much of what she said was true. If she really does ally with the North, it would be disastrous for us."

Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal, though his eyes were clearly deep in thought. "She was right about one thing, though. You've been active across the seas recently, Grand-uncle, and the Wave-Suppressing Mansion is becoming more important. Tianwan is manageable, but Changxiao is the real threat. Once our family is stronger, he's the one we must deal with first."

Li Ximing replied, "There's still Cheng Yan to worry about."

"Cheng Yan is no threat." Li Zhouwei mused, "If we weren't worried about tipping our hand, with his meager abilities, our family could have dealt with him long ago... As for now..."

Just as he was contemplating this, Li Jianglong arrived from down the mountain and bowed to them both. Li Ximing gave him his instructions.

"There's something beneath the Wilderness. I want you to instruct our people to adjust and update the great formation. Shift some of the mountain ranges, stir things up, and create some spiritual energy fluctuations to provide cover."

"And remember, do it slowly, meticulously. Drag it out as long as possible. The key is to always have some kind of spiritual energy disturbance active to mask the real one."

"Yes, sir!"

Ever since his last talk with Li Zhouwei, Li Jiangqian had entered seclusion to polish his cultivation and had yet to emerge. Both of the talisman-holders were secretly racing against time. Li Jianglong, however, was highly capable and more than up to this task.

The two had just finished their arrangements when they suddenly looked up, sensing something. "Who is it?" Li Zhouwei asked, his brow furrowed.

A moment later, a report came from the foot of the mountain,

"My lords, Si Xunhui of the Azure Pond Sect is at the foot of the mountain. He says... he says... Daoist Master Qinghu is here to pay his respects."

Li Ximing froze for a second, then shot to his feet, exchanging a look with Li Zhouwei. The same name flashed through both their minds,

"Si Yuanli!"

They had both sensed the aura that abruptly descended outside the mountain. Si Xunhui was a direct descendant of the Si family, and given the timing, the person outside could only be Si Yuanli, who had been in seclusion for many years!

Li Zhouwei looked thoughtful. He glanced at Li Ximing and said quietly,

"Grand-uncle, you meet with him. I'll go keep an eye on the Wilderness."

Li Zhouwei had never had much contact with the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Unsure of Si Yuanli's purpose, he naturally let Li Ximing, who always played the role of the affable peacemaker, feel him out. Li Zhouwei dissolved into light and vanished. Li Ximing, though inwardly surprised, plastered a joyous smile on his face and rode the wind out to greet their guest.

"Is that Fellow Daoist Si gracing us with a visit? Congratulations... truly, congratulations!"

Outside the mountain, amidst clusters of clouds, stood a middle-aged man with a sword on his back and a scroll at his waist. He was also wreathed in smiles.

"Indeed it is!"

Li Ximing's eyes swept over him, guessing that the scroll at his waist was the Huai River Map. At this, his enthusiasm grew even warmer.

The two Daoist Masters, who had barely met, now greeted each other with all the warmth of long-lost friends. Li Ximing laughed as he ushered him inside.

"It really is you! Senior Yuanxiu mentioned you to me several times back in the day. I always figured your breakthrough to the divine ability realm was only a matter of time. I'm truly happy for his sake... How is it that the Azure Pond hasn't announced the good news?"

At the mention of Yuanxiu, Si Yuanli's false smile gained a flicker of genuine emotion. He adopted a serious tone. "It was precisely because of a reminder left by my old ancestor. I came to see you at the first opportunity, Fellow Daoist. I haven't even reported the news to my sect yet!"

'That old fox...' Li Ximing cursed inwardly. 'So the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda wasn't a free gift after all!'

Though he cursed inwardly, Li Ximing's expression was one of deep emotion. "To think, when I broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm all those years ago, the first person I saw was Senior Si. And now, you've rushed to see me... It just shows the profound karmic bond between our two families."

"Indeed, indeed."

Si Yuanli was keen to build an alliance and get involved in the current situation. Li Ximing, eyeing the Spiritual Treasure with hopes of borrowing it, was happy to play along. The two shamelessly flattered each other for a while, solidifying their families' "friendship," before finally sitting down at the table. Si Yuanli sighed.

"How the times have changed. It's truly unpredictable!"

He began to ask for details, and Li Ximing leaked a few pieces of information. As expected, Si Yuanli eventually asked,

"Baijiang Creek becoming the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter... was that truly Qiuhu's doing?"

Li Ximing smiled inwardly but shook his head with a grave expression. He simply raised one hand and pointed a single finger upward.

"Hsss..."

Si Yuanli's expression changed instantly. Li Ximing, intent on frightening him, thought to himself,

'The Azure Pond has finally fallen into chaos. I can't let this fellow think he's above it all and just focus on his own plans!'

His expression hardened as he spoke. "Fellow Daoist, do you recall a certain painting you once made?"

Si Yuanli was clearly taken aback and hesitated, unable to recall. He had loved painting all his life; how could he remember one specific piece? He watched as Li Ximing continued in a somber tone,

"The one depicting... that great personage."

At this reminder, Si Yuanli's heart trembled. He remembered. "That..."

Li Ximing's expression was complex. He frowned. "Did you know... your every move is seen by that personage? He borrowed that painting of yours to manifest. He even... he even asked in a cold voice... why you painted him to look so ferocious!"

"What?"

Si Yuanli's face went white. He shook his head instinctively, only for Li Ximing to add,

"You didn't even add color... but when he looks at it, what difference does that make?"

Li Ximing's description was so specific that Si Yuanli could pinpoint the exact moment he'd painted it. A chill went down his spine. "I... how could I have known..."

But Si Yuanli recovered quickly. After the initial panic, suspicion began to creep in. "While painting him may have been disrespectful... it was still used to help him take action in Jiangbei... It shouldn't... it shouldn't be that serious, should it?"

But Li Ximing's face was a mask of worry. "That would be for the best. But seeing as Fellow Daoist Ning still doesn't dare show her face... I fear something terrible has happened!"

Si Yuanli was a naturally suspicious and anxious person. The suggestion struck a nerve, and he nodded silently, his unease growing. Li Ximing seized the opening to change the subject. "What are your plans now, Fellow Daoist?"

Si Yuanli stroked his beard thoughtfully. "Wanling Heaven is about to descend... The fall of a Grotto-Heaven is always a major event, and I am naturally drawn to it. I will observe it... After that, I plan to visit a few old acquaintances of the Si family."

"But I also came here on a personal matter."

He smiled, hesitating for just a moment as if considering something, before beckoning Si Xunhui forward. "Xunhui... I'm sure you know him, Fellow Daoist. He is your esteemed brother's disciple and a direct descendant of my family. I've come this time... hoping to deepen the bond between our families by arranging his marriage."

"Oh?" Li Ximing hadn't expected him to be so direct and was momentarily put on the spot. Si Xunhui was, without a doubt, an exceptional talent. "Is that so? And who is the young lady he has his eye on?"

Si Yuanli stroked his beard, as if weighing his words. "I hear that Moongaze has several young women of the main line who are of a suitable age for Xunhui. I wonder... if you have any candidates in mind, Fellow Daoist?"

Li Ximing's greatest fear was hearing him say the name 'Li Que'wan'. He was absolutely unwilling to marry her off, and Si Xunhui would never agree to marry into their clan. He breathed an inward sigh of relief and frowned as if in thought. "We don't have many young women in our main line, and fewer still who are outstanding. Que'Wan's ambitions lie far and wide, and Quexi is confined to the blessed lands. There is... one other girl, Li Queyi. She is currently in the Xinyu Archipelago."

Although he knew she was the perfect candidate, he put on a troubled expression and shook his head. "The only pity is... she is a disciple of the Purple Smoke Gate. Her marriage is no longer a matter for the clan to decide. It's entirely up to her."

"Oh?"

Upon hearing this, however, Si Yuanli's expression actually turned to one of satisfaction.

He also doted on Si Xunhui. He had brought up the proposal mainly as a gesture of goodwill; whether it worked out or not was a simple matter of a compatibility. But the news that she was a disciple of the Purple Smoke Gate genuinely piqued his interest.

"This is an excellent match. We should just let the young people meet on their own. If it's meant to be, it will be. There's no need to say it was a clan arrangement. They can simply be two disciples from different sects who fell in love. That way, neither has to formally join the other's family register, and if any trouble brews in the future, it won't cause a scandal."

Li Ximing was also quite satisfied. He had visited the Xinyu Archipelago once and had an excellent impression of Li Queyi. Si Xunhui was practically one of their own already, handsome and exceptionally talented. It was only because the Si family was in an awkward position right now; otherwise, it would be hard to say who was getting the better end of the deal.

'Her personality is gentle, and she's very obedient. Si Xunhui, on the other hand, is extremely ambitious and sharp. If this truly works out, it would be a great opportunity for her. The Si family is resourceful... It's hard to say how deep this alliance could go, but maintaining a good relationship is always for the best.'

Both men were pleased with the arrangement, and Si Xunhui, standing to the side, was both shocked and overjoyed. The two seniors chatted about recent events and exchanged pleasantries, before Li Ximing seized an opportunity.

"Fellow Daoist Si, do you happen to know of the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill?"

At this, Si Yuanli paused, a strange feeling in his heart. "Naturally. Back then... in the Great Ning Palace, I was with an elder of your clan when we... acquired it."

The elder Si Yuanli referred to was, of course, Li Xuanfeng. He had always addressed Li Xuanfeng as a "Fellow Daoist," but out of respect for Li Ximing, he'd referred to him as an elder. Li Ximing shook his head with emotion. "I had heard that story, which is why I guessed you might have a Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill. I just thought I would ask..."

"I see!" At Li Ximing's question, Si Yuanli became hesitant. "Well... it's a precious pill. Are you, Fellow Daoist, looking to make an exchange for it?"

Li Ximing immediately realized that Si Yuanli, being naturally suspicious and having just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, was on high alert. He was afraid of being tricked into a bad trade. Now was not the right time to press the matter; it would only breed distrust. Besides, the Upper Shaman spirit embryo wasn't even formed yet, so there was no rush. He simply smiled.

"You've heard of Dingyang Zi, I presume. If you find yourself in Qize, you can ask to see the items I've entrusted to him. If anything there interests you, feel free to send me a message."

"Excellent!"

This was a much more palatable proposal. Si Yuanli smiled and nodded. Soon after, he took his leave, riding the wind up. He led his junior out through the formation and away from the great lake before finally speaking.

"Well? Are you satisfied?"

Si Xunhui smiled and bowed. "I will follow your arrangements completely, Daoist Master!"

Si Yuanli retracted his gaze, the smile fading from his eyes. Li Ximing's words began to circle in his mind, and his expression clouded over.

'The painting... He borrowed my painting to make his move... Suiguan is also an insidious, treacherous bastard. What was the meaning of that painting...?'




# Chapter 970: One Decisive Push

Li Ximing saw Si Yuanli off and returned to his seat. Li Zhouwei had already manifested and began to ask questions.

"He showed some intent to build good relations," Li Ximing sighed. "After all, circumstances are stronger than men. The Si family is not what it once was, and our family has endured. Even if he harbors some resentment, he must lower his head when required."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "The matter with the Yang family... did Granduncle mention it?"

Li Ximing let out a short laugh. "Since he didn't ask, I didn't bring it up. In any case, the Mushroom Forest Plains are Azure Pond territory. It's not like Yang Zhuo can turn around and attack Moongaze Lake. Let him stir up his own trouble."

Li Zhouwei smiled. The Underworld was, after all, an extraordinary place. Si Yuanli didn't trust the Li family enough to bring up the Yang family's affairs. He poured some tea and replied, "It's quite the coincidence. I was just in the Wilderness and saw Daoist Master Xuanyi approaching. I estimate he was looking for you, Granduncle, but he ran into me instead and struck up a conversation—it was about the Hongxue Daoist Tradition."

He paused, then continued, "According to him, Hongxue originated from the Wei-Li and still possesses some foundation. The few sects that were exterminated back then were completely carved up, but Hongxue managed to hide this one lineage underground. The Azure Pond Sect and the other powers all sensed that something must have been hidden elsewhere, which is why they went to the trouble of gathering the descendants of 'Li Ti'."

"Daoist Master Xuanyi said the place doesn't seem like a cultivator's abode, but rather a Mystic Realm."

Li Ximing grew suspicious. "How much of that is true? The Azure Pond Sect is backed by a Grotto-Heaven and relies on the high standing of a 'Great One'. It's plausible they might have a Mystic Realm. But Hongxue only had a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. How could they possess such means?"

"I asked," Li Zhouwei replied. "Apparently, the Hongxue sect was a declining branch of the Wei-Li. They happened upon a reincarnated 'Wei Emperor' and received a stroke of luck. The 'Great One' obtained an Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition—one of the 'Four Secrets'—called the 'Secret Elevated'. After that entity took everything of value, he left them the scraps and the empty shell of a Mystic Realm. This branch of the Wei-Li prospered from then on."

Only then did Li Ximing understand. He nodded silently. "A Mystic Realm, much like the Great Ning Palace back in the day, can last for centuries if left sealed. But if it's opened and not maintained by someone with sufficiently high divine abilities, I fear it won't hold for long."

"Exactly." Li Zhouwei's expression was strange. "Fortunately, that Mystic Realm was never large, and it relied on the high standing of Wanling Heaven. It remained relatively stable, allowing Hongxue to benefit from it for many years."

"Now Li Quantao has entered. Tianwan's 'Cold Qi' divine ability is not a 'Whole Pill'. She required all sorts of assistance to even get inside. But this is her opportunity. Times have changed. Wanling Heaven is constantly shaking and gradually revealing its true nature. This place is also becoming more unstable... Daoist Master Xuanyi's meaning is clear: we just have to wait. The moment something happens to Wanling Heaven, this Mystic Realm will definitely collapse."

"What a pity!" Li Ximing lamented inwardly. He had already understood the strange look in Li Zhouwei's eyes.

'To be honest,' he thought, 'our family has no need for 'Cold Qi', but a Mystic Realm is a first-rate treasure. If we could get our hands on it, it would be leagues better for concealment than the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda! We could hide so many things much more easily... But now, it's on the verge of collapse. It's clearly not fated for us.'

Seeing Li Ximing's deep regret, Li Zhouwei offered comfort. "Our family doesn't understand the arts of Great Void construction. Even if we managed to acquire a Mystic Realm, we would have no way to maintain it. Besides, the cost of maintenance is far higher than it was in ancient times. If our family were to take on such a task, the burden would surely fall to Que'Wan in the future."

Li Ximing nodded in agreement, his expression turning serious. "Wanling Heaven draws closer by the day. You absolutely must go and test your fortune. I will go and return as quickly as possible, then I will remain at the lake. I'll handle the Hongxue affair and... watch over the clan."

He voiced his concerns. "Although everyone's attention will be on Wanling Heaven, the Buddhist cultivators are treacherous. We can't guarantee that some Merciful One won't get ideas about our family. We absolutely cannot let our guard down!"

Li Zhouwei's expression gradually hardened. He left the mountain with Li Ximing, descending toward a more concealed grand formation.

"I was just pondering that very issue." He changed the subject. "'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' is the humble aspect of the Bright Yang, and its cultivation is extremely fast. After I forged the 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' immortal foundation, I received its blessing and your resources, Granduncle. In just a few years, I have already reached perfection."

"Oh?" Li Ximing showed a flash of delight. "Well, you did take the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill..."

Li Zhouwei nodded, his face grave. "Although the immortal foundation is perfect, there is certain to be conflict within the Grotto-Heaven. The possibility of injury is extremely high. If I am wounded beyond a certain point, it's very likely my immortal foundation will be damaged..."

Li Ximing weighed the implications and instantly understood his meaning. 

"You're going to try and nurture a divine ability?" he asked, inwardly shocked.

"Precisely!" Li Zhouwei had, in fact, been planning this for a long time; otherwise, he wouldn't have taken multiple Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills to advance his cultivation. His eyes burned with intensity. "Rather than risk damaging my cultivation in the Grotto-Heaven, I will make one decisive push and aim straight for a divine ability!"

Li Ximing fell silent, deep in thought.

Li Zhouwei continued, his voice firm as steel. "'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' is situated in a humble position, which is a perfect match. It's suitable for forging the immortal foundation, and just as suitable for achieving the divine ability. That is the first reason. Second, 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' is a Body Divine Ability. I am favored by the Bright Yang, and my body already possesses its own marvels, which resonates with it."

"Even if it is rash and I fail to achieve the divine ability, as long as I can push through to the Shengyang Acupoint in one go, it will make my next attempt to claim the 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' divine ability easier and faster. No matter what, that is far better than letting my cultivation go to waste!"

Li Ximing grew more hesitant. "I fear only one thing. Pushing to the Shengyang Acupoint and nurturing a divine ability takes time. Even though you are no longer a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, it is not something that can be accomplished in a year or two..."

"If you haven't succeeded by the time the Grotto-Heaven opens, won't you miss the opportunity?"

Li Zhouwei's expression was resolute. "The immortal foundation is not the issue; I can cultivate that at any time. But the Grotto-Heaven is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. If I truly run out of time and the Grotto-Heaven begins to fall, the spiritual qi of the world will become immensely vast. I will surely sense it. At that moment, I will abandon 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' and head for the Grotto-Heaven."

Li Ximing knew this junior of his was far more decisive than he. Gritting his teeth, he said, "There isn't much I can do to help... However! I once refined a certain great pill in the Eastern Sea. Its effects are exceptional, perfect for breaking through bottlenecks and calming one's qi. It nourishes the dharma body with the cold moon's clear spiritual qi and extends the life-mandate. It's a perfect match for your needs! Just take one, and it will surely aid you!"

Li Zhouwei knew exactly how precious that pill was. Li Ximing had used one during a desperate crisis, but it had been the wrong situation for it. Though he never spoke of it, he had secretly regretted it for years. This regret only deepened after he obtained a high-quality consumable like the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, and he'd stopped mentioning it entirely.

How could he let Li Ximing take it out again? "We will not speak of this!" he said quickly. "What if the Grotto-Heaven falls just in time? Should I abandon the attempt or refuse to waste the pill? My goal is to minimize potential losses, not to guarantee a breakthrough. I absolutely cannot waste such a treasure!"

His reasoning was sound and convinced Li Ximing, who could only sigh in frustration. "It's just a pity that Si Yuanli is still so cautious. He refuses to trade pills with me. Otherwise, the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill, which is made for nurturing divine abilities, would be the most suitable for you!"

"How could things be so perfect?" Li Zhouwei just smiled and saw him off, saying no more. A thread of anticipation stirred within him.

'That Grotto-Heaven holds more than just spiritual items and Daoist Traditions. It's a grand stage for a battle. It will save my Dao-Profundity from this stagnation!'

He transformed into a streak of light and swiftly entered the formation, taking a seat within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Without hesitation, he reached into his sleeve and retrieved a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill.

'Sovereign's Perilous Tread is perfected. All that's left is this final step!'

He swallowed the pill. The roiling Bright Yang divine ability immediately began to circle within his dharma body. The clouds in his qi sea parted as a golden light shot forth, powerfully lifted by the Bright Yang divine ability and the pill's dharma power.

As this wondrous transformation ascended, pale golden scales began to materialize around the young man's neck, creeping up along his jawline toward his cheeks, giving him a ferocious, draconic appearance.

...

Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.

A faint white mist permeated the sky, while pale, jagged bones littered the ground. Amidst surges of biting cold qi, a few minor cultivators, clutching talismans, moved with extreme caution among the skeletons.

The sky was an eerie, deep purple, glowing like a massive, magnificent gemstone rather than being dark.

"What a treasure land..."

A man wielding a long-handled pole-blade stood in the air, demonic winds swirling around him as he drew the surrounding baleful qi into a vortex. Helian Wumeng stared into the Great Void with his demonic pupils, which flashed as if trying to discern something.

Beside him stood a tall, imposing middle-aged man, his hand resting on the Dharma sword at his waist. "The spiritual qi now changes three times a day," he said softly. "The initial signs are appearing."

Helian Wumeng knew his elder's Dao-Profundity was higher and that he understood these changes better. He smiled. "Have the juniors arrived?"

Helian Wujiang nodded leisurely. "Changyu and Changying have both reached Jiangbei. The two of them are pillars of the family. This is a perfect opportunity for them to fight for their fortunes."

Helian Wumeng's gaze swept across the Great Void. He saw a beam of Valley Water light rise from one side, and the blaze of True Fire flare up on another, each occupying a different quadrant. He sneered. "They've all come."

Helian Wujiang shook his head. "They've all spread their teachings far and wide, and it was a great effort to finally produce a Xindu. The families invested heavily, even preparing spiritual items for their candidates—and likely wasted many more on other hopefuls. Naturally, they want to recoup their losses. This is especially true for those few great families from Zhao State."

The Helian family had been slowly rising in recent years, escaping their predicament in Mobei and conquering numerous tribes. In doing so, they had naturally offended many, and their relations with several of the great families were strained.

Helian Wumeng was about to offer a scathing remark when he saw a golden light cascade down from another part of the Great Void like a waterfall.

An old man and a young man materialized. Both wore robes patterned with golden flames, embroidered with images of rock and wind-blown sand. The moment they appeared, their radiance illuminated the area—a truly grand display of power.

Helian Wujiang lowered his voice. "The Golden Feather Sect. That is True Monarch Taiyuan... He is the 'Gengyi Daoist Shanqing' mentioned in the scriptures. His is also a top-tier Daoist Tradition."

Helian Wumeng nodded silently. This man, who usually feared neither heaven nor earth, showed a trace of reverence at the name. "So it's him... an evergreen tree of the Metal Virtue."

But before he finished speaking, a clear cloud drifted in from the southwest, shifting and changing in the air. Several figures could be vaguely seen standing within it. They exchanged greetings with the Golden Feather Sect.

'Mount Changhuai.'

Divine abilities swirled, and colorful clouds gathered. More experts manifested in sequence, waiting in the sky. Helian Wumeng laughed. "On any other day, they're screaming to kill one another. But when it's time to carve up a Grotto-Heaven, every last one of them shows up, acting friendlier than family. The fighting stops, the killing stops..."

"Where is it any different?" Helian Wujiang smiled. "Otherwise, why would the likes of Bai Ziyu bother to get involved?"

Amidst the gathering of powerful cultivators, Helian Wumeng raised his head. His eyes quickly found a patch of brilliant light, but he did not see the person he expected. "That is...?"

Helian Wujiang's gaze was deep. "Li Ximing."

Within the somber Great Void, magnificent radiances appeared one by one. A man in a white-gold Daoist robe stood in the southern quadrant. It was Li Ximing, his hands folded in his sleeves, his gaze sweeping over the assembly.

More than half a year had passed since Li Zhouwei entered seclusion. During this time, Li Ximing had dedicated himself to cultivating spell arts and advancing his cultivation base. There had been no leisure to speak of. Aided by Talisman Qi, his Great Parting's White Brilliance had progressed steadily. A sudden flash of inspiration had even allowed him to take a great leap forward, condensing an additional "crimson light."

This should have been a joyous occasion, but just as he finished his cultivation, he sensed the spiritual qi by the "shore" become turbulent. A bad feeling rose in his heart, and his delight vanished. Standing in the Great Void, he confirmed his fears: shadowy figures were gathering from all directions.

A streak of golden light leaped toward him, materializing into a handsome and carefree young man. It was Daoist Master Tianhuo of the Golden Feather Sect.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

"Daoist Friend Tianhuo..." Li Ximing had been feeling hesitant. Seeing Tianhuo approach him directly, he felt a measure of safety.

Tianhuo smiled freely. "Which juniors did you bring along, Daoist Friend?"

Li Ximing just shook his head with a wry smile. The young man before him was extremely sharp; he immediately and seamlessly changed the subject.

"The foundations of Wanling Heaven are beginning to show. The first things to fall will certainly be the various Mystic Realms attached to it. Do you remember the Great Ning Palace, Daoist Friend? It was the exact same situation with Anhuai Heaven back in the day!"

"These Mystic Realms are just full of things for Foundation Establishment cultivators... You and I have no need to fight over them. But sending in some juniors... that's an excellent opportunity! Sometimes, they even hold great surprises. And with us presiding up here, everyone will be restrained. There shouldn't be any serious casualties."

With just that brief explanation, Li Ximing understood completely.

'What was once a great crisis and opportunity in the eyes of a Foundation Establishment cultivator is nothing special to those who wield divine abilities... My own family's elder acted as a blade for the Azure Pond Sect, doing this exact same job!'

'If that's the case, Minggong and the others can absolutely go in and try... especially Ding Weizeng! He possesses the marvel of 'slipping the cage'. He can definitely enter and exit safely. It's a shame 'Little Cui' is gone...'

Thinking this way, he realized it meant there was still a decent amount of time. Li Ximing felt a secret joy. He hadn't expected Daoist Master Tianhuo to be so warm.

Tianhuo smiled and said, "Have you made arrangements on the lake? My sect's juniors will also be heading here. If you are interested, Daoist Friend, we can have them enter together. They can look out for one another!"




# Chapter 971: Nanxiang

Ever since Li Zhouwei had been revealed to the public, the Golden Feather Sect's attitude had improved considerably. Daoist Master Tianhuo had visited the Li Clan several times, always polite and amiable. The "Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Divine Scroll," which had benefited the Li Clan so much, had been a gift from them...

And as long as the Li family sent them Neck Feathers, the Golden Feather Sect would exchange Profound Shell Flower-Leaves for them, regardless of whether they needed them or not. Their intention to help was obvious. Now, with Daoist Master Tianhuo asking so directly, their stance was even clearer.

Li Ximing looked at the young man's smiling face and began to weigh his options.

'This... isn't bad. After all, there are too many Daoist Traditions in the north. Who knows how many of them are targeting our family... not to mention the Buddhist cultivators who are certain to enter. If we can get the Golden Feather Sect to provide some support, it would naturally be a good thing...'

He smiled. "I'm just afraid we'll drag down your immortal sect!"

"Ah..." A smile touched Daoist Master Tianhuo's eyes, making him appear even more dashing. "That's not right... Your noble clan has many talented individuals. How could you speak of being a burden? Our two families share six generations of friendship and a hundred years of peace. Our ties have been strong ever since Senior Tongya and my Golden Feather Sect's Dao-child. We should let the younger generation interact more."

He brought up the old matter of Zhang Yun, making Li Ximing nod with a smile. At the Purple Mansion Realm, both families knew the truth. It had all been a result of calculations back then. The so-called "friendship" was just a story to fool the ignorant masses. He muttered inwardly:

'When they need us, it's "six generations of friendship" and "a hundred years of peace." When they don't, it's "that minor clan on the lake" and "come when you are summoned." The Golden Feather Sect's surname is Zhang, but very few of those Zhangs have ever shown any real goodwill to my Li family...'

Still, exploring this Mystic Realm wasn't a core interest. It only involved a few Foundation Establishment cultivators. The Golden Feather Sect wouldn't stoop to playing tricks in a matter like this. He smiled. "You are absolutely right, Daoist Brother!"

He reached into his sleeve and took out a round pearl engraved with the markings of a spirit tiger. With a subtle manipulation, it instantly transformed into a palm-sized spirit tiger. Li Ximing sent his thoughts, listing off several names: "Li Jiangxia, Ding Weizeng, Li Jianglong, Li Wushao, Chen Yang..."

These individuals were chosen either for their high cultivation or for their formidable skills and abilities. He sent no more. However, when it came to the crucial pair, Li Jiangqian and Li Que'Wan, Li Ximing hesitated.

Li Que'Wan had gone to the Eastern Sea over half a year ago and was already at the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. He wasn't sure if she had emerged from her seclusion yet. Li Jiangqian was at the lake, but he had been in seclusion for a long time, taking pills to perfect his cultivation.

Li Ximing had no intention of disturbing their seclusion just to enter this Mystic Realm. Unlike Li Zhouwei, who was now exposed to all, Li Jiangqian and Li Que'Wan were his clan's Purple Mansion Seeds. He had deliberately kept them low-profile for years. At most, the outside world knew they had good cultivation arts; they knew almost nothing about Li Que'Wan.

If they shone too brightly in the Mystic Realm, they would certainly attract everyone's attention and be marked by rivals. If Li Ximing was ever tied down, there was no guarantee their enemies wouldn't make a move in secret.

The people he was sending in were not high-level. The only one who was, Ding Weizeng, didn't even have the Li surname. This, too, was a subtle form of protection.

'It's just some Foundation Establishment-level stuff... It's not worth risking the Purple Mansion Seeds. The ones best suited for this kind of work are Guest Retainers with other surnames, like Ding Weizeng!'

This place was extremely close to the lake. He just had the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger transform into its Mountain Tiger divine ability and carry the message back.

His gaze swept across the Great Void, identifying the attendees one by one. Aside from the few Purple Mansion cultivators who had already been waiting by the shore, all the other major powers had arrived. There were also a few unfamiliar faces, likely from the northern aristocratic families. He just didn't see the newly ascended Si Yuanli, who must not have arrived yet.

In the western clouds stood Qi Lanyan. Slightly ahead of him was Daoist Master Yehui, still riding that crow of his—which might have been a Spiritual Artifact or a spirit embryo. When he saw Li Ximing look over, he nodded with a smile.

This Yehui was a scheming man. Back when he decided to wade into these muddy waters and defect to the north, he had paid the Li family a visit. Li Ximing hadn't understood why at the time, but thinking back, Yehui must have used that visit to make it clear he bore no enmity and wanted to settle old grudges, all to avoid becoming a casualty of the conflict between north and south.

A little further away, an aqua-robed woman stood quietly, saying nothing. Her eyes, gazing over from afar, were filled with complex emotions.

When her gaze met Li Ximing's, her lips parted slightly, and she sighed, lowering her eyes.

"Daoist Brother Zhaojing..." Li Ximing's thoughts were interrupted by Daoist Master Tianhuo, who spoke in a low, mysterious tone. "Look to the north."

Li Ximing looked over. Two divine abilities were floating in the north, radiating light. One was a murky white, the other a hazy fog. Just looking at them made him feel uncomfortable.

Daoist Master Tianhuo whispered, "That's Gongsun Bei, who cultivates Dawn Qi, and Zong Chang of the Great Zhao imperial court, who cultivates Veiled Yin. Your noble clan must be wary of those two."

Li Ximing felt a chill. As the two appeared, he saw that Gongsun Bei was tall and imposing, wearing armor and carrying a crimson axe. His gaze was like a sword, and a scar marked his face. He did not look like someone to be trifled with.

"Dawn Qi..." Ever since he began cultivating, Li Ximing had heard that his own Dao Lineage feared Dawn Qi, so he had always paid it special attention. He had only ever heard that the Golden Feather Sect had a powerful Dawn Qi Dao Lineage. Now, finally seeing a Dawn Qi Purple Mansion cultivator, he frowned.

Zong Chang wore a python robe. She was short, with the face of a woman, but though her features were elegant, her aura was one of deceit and danger, twisting her entire appearance. She was staring at him intently. The long, male-style robe pooled at her feet, and beneath it, deathly pale skin was visible. Several glistening black venomous bees flapped their wings, crawling and flying in the robe's shadows.

Daoist Master Tianhuo frowned, whispering, "The Veiled Yin cultivates in groups. They favor debauchery and proliferation. Their true forms resemble shrews. Those who cultivate the upper-body aspects resemble bees and ants; those who cultivate the lower-body aspects give birth to a hundred evils... This person has cultivated to the point where hardly anyone normal is left in the Zhao court."

He whispered, "Do you know of Maha Taixi? Before defecting to the Buddhists, he also cultivated Veiled Yin. If you trace the lineage, he would be her Martial Uncle."

Li Ximing nodded grimly. Daoist Master Tianhuo shook his head. "Her cultivation art is special. She will eventually defect to the Buddhists as well; it's been this way for generations. They exhaust their use, feeding on the Fuqi's destiny to transform into Buddhists... Because of this, even though she looks like a cultivator now, you can consider her one of the Buddhist cultivators."

"As for Gongsun Bei... he's just a dog raised by the great families."

Li Ximing finally had a clear picture. "The north is truly a chaotic mess."

"Isn't it?" Daoist Master Tianhuo shook his head slightly. "Although the Great Zhao is just an empty shell, it's a very useful shell. Countless factions are mixed together inside it, all intertwined. It's nothing like the south."

He said with deep meaning, "The Yue State, however, is no 'empty shell'."

As they spoke, the Great Void began to tremble violently. Dazzling streams of white and purple light fell from the sky, weaving together. A chain of Daoist temples emerged from the distance, its shadow slowly solidifying in the Great Void.

This stretch of temples had a circular border. It scraped against the fabric of the Great Void at high speed, erupting in brilliant golden sparks, only to be expelled by the Great Void and rain down upon the mortal world's Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.

A golden rain began to fall on the bone-covered hills. Li Ximing glanced at it. It was 'Spirit-Mausoleum Gold,' a Wandering Metal-path material, at the Qi Refining level. Incredibly precious for rogue cultivators. A scramble immediately broke out below.

As he observed, several streaks of light sped over from the lake. Li Ximing glanced down. The Heavenly Light shone, and he gave a few orders. Daoist Master Tianhuo nodded with a smile. As expected, several Golden Feather Sect cultivators flew over to greet his group. Li Ximing looked closely and, sure enough, Su Yan was among them.

Although this was just a game being played by Purple Mansion cultivators, Li Ximing remained cautious. He gently stroked his waist, unfastening the azure and yellow Reveal River, and gave it a few commands. The item immediately vanished from the Great Void.

"Weizeng, if you run into trouble in the Mystic Realm, use the spirit embryo to suppress them."

Ding Weizeng was standing amidst the roiling white mist, speaking gravely with the Golden Feather Sect man. Hearing the voice from the sky, he quickly bowed. "I receive the Daoist Master's immortal decree!"

At his words, everyone present, from both the Li family and the Golden Feather Sect, bowed their heads respectfully. Daoist Master Tianhuo saw this and smiled. "Zhaojing truly dotes on his juniors."

Li Ximing turned his head and said quietly, "For a hundred years, my family has only been able to watch others play their hands, fearing their hidden cards. Things are different now. This is why we achieve divine abilities—so our descendants can have hidden cards of their own, so they have backing, and so they can stand proudly alongside the descendants of other immortal lines, not just surviving by being fierce and ruthless."

Daoist Master Tianhuo's smile faded. He seemed to recall something, and a complex look crossed his face. He said wistfully, "Once you reach this level... the chance to survive by being fierce and ruthless... is a luxury you can no longer afford."

Li Ximing was silent. The two tacitly dropped the subject and focused their attention on the Mystic Realm before them.

Li Ximing activated his divine ability, infusing his Heavenly Light. As the Mystic Realm destabilized and briefly connected with the outside world, he peered inside. The hazy colors faded, revealing elegant, densely packed immortal pavilions. At the highest point was a great purple hall with golden characters written above its entrance:

"Nanxiang Hall."

Although it was just a glimpse, all the divine ability cultivators saw it clearly and began to whisper among themselves. Daoist Master Tianhuo said softly, "As expected. It's one of the Nanxiang Daoist traditions."

Li Ximing looked at him. Tianhuo explained, "The Three Profounds are all the same. The direct lineages are few and far between. Encompassing Profoundity is in decline and not well-known now, but many of its ancient branches were famous. Those still famous today... in order... are the Northern Palace Divine Thunder, the Aegis of the Transverse Dam, the Four Secrets of Nanxiang..."

"No need to say more about the Thunder Palace; it's the pinnacle of Encompassing Profoundity. Everyone knows it, though it's not seen now. The Aegis of the Transverse Dam cultivates Azure Manifestation; Dams-Goat Temple Palace belongs to them. The remaining 'Four Secret Dao Lineages' we often mention are, in fact, these Four Secrets of Nanxiang."

With this explanation, Li Ximing finally connected the dots. He had just heard about the Hongxue Dao Lineage. He counted on his fingers, "Secret Diffusion, Secret Enclosure, Secret Elevated... That still leaves one missing."

At his words, Daoist Master Tianhuo first nodded, seemingly surprised he knew of "Secret Elevated." But when he heard the end, he couldn't help but laugh out loud. "Daoist Brother, you can't see the forest for the trees..."

Li Ximing's interest was piqued. Daoist Master Tianhuo continued to scan the Mystic Realm with his divine ability as he said leisurely, "This last lineage... one of its branches was active along the riverbanks for many years. In ancient times, they even lived in the Moongaze Marsh! Although the Dao Lineage moved away long ago, some of the names for people and places were left behind... right in your territory, Daoist Brother!"

Li Ximing froze. He thought back to the names around the lake and said in disbelief, "Milin Prefecture... Secret Forest?!"

Daoist Master Tianhuo laughed. "Precisely!"

This Daoist Master Tianhuo was famously playful and loved seeing this exact look of dawning realization. His fun having been satisfied, he seemed to be in an even better mood. "And you still have the empty shell of the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Talisman, don't you!"

That single sentence perfectly revealed the Golden Feather Sect's all-encompassing surveillance. A chill crept into Li Ximing's heart. He replied, surprised, "I do!"

The Six Xin Harmonising Metal Talisman in the Li family's possession had long since been stripped of its essence, leaving only a patterned shell. Although the material itself might have some value, it no longer held any wondrous power.

Li Zhouwei had mentioned this to him before. The greatest value of the empty shell wasn't the remaining spiritual materials, but the intricate patterns carved into it that had once manifested its power. The reason it was kept hidden in the clan was for this very purpose—if a promising junior appeared in the future, or if Jiangzong's artifact refining skills reached a high enough level, they could study the shell to create an imitation, much like their Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman.

Daoist Master Tianhuo brought this up and smiled. "The Twelve Profound Talismans are possessions of Encompassing Profoundity. The Jiang family's ancestors were from the Ning State and received the Secret Forest Dao Lineage. This is the reason why the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Talisman was able to find its way into the hands of the Milin Jiang family! Do you understand now, Daoist Brother?"

His revelation about the "Twelve Profound Talismans" was like a sudden enlightenment, clearing Li Ximing's mind.

'Of course! No wonder... no wonder. The clues were there all along. Our own Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman imitates the "Six Shocks Profound Thunder Talisman" from the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring. That Dao Lineage originated from the Dams-Goat Temple Palace, which is also Encompassing Profoundity!!'

'And that's why the "Six Ding Merging Fire Talisman"—which was so famous on Crimson Reef Island and later obtained by the Dragon-Slaying Senior—was given by the Dragon-kin to Guo Shentong, who came from an Encompassing Profoundity Grotto-Heaven. It was a return of a lineage item...'

Li Ximing never would have dreamed this could be connected to his own family. He stood stunned for several seconds, but as he thought it through, the pieces slowly fit together.

'The Chongming Profund Insight Screen we got from the Great Ning Palace was inscribed with "Jiang Bing" and "Chen Xuanli." This is proof the Jiang Clan came from Jiangbei. When the Ning State fell, the Jiang, Chen, Li, and even the Azure Pond's Si family were all scattered... all of them deeply connected to Encompassing Profoundity...'

"Thank you for the guidance, Daoist Brother!" Li Ximing said with genuine sincerity. Just then, the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter filled with a purple haze, and golden clouds appeared as the Mystic Realm finally landed, releasing a boundless surge of spiritual energy.

"The Mystic Realm has stabilized!"

At that moment, Daoist Master Tianque, who had been silent, quietly raised his head. The Dharma mirror in his hand reflected a faint purple light, casting it into the Great Void. This made Daoist Master Tianhuo smile.

"Fellow Daoists! There is a treasure in this Nanxiang Hall... Let's make it a prize. We shall see who it's fated to fall to!"

The assembled divine ability cultivators sneered or nodded, each sending their juniors into the realm. Daoist Master Tianhuo also raised his hand and looked at Li Ximing with a smile. "We'll help each other, but there's no need to drop them in the same place. We wouldn't want to reduce our gains."

Li Ximing naturally understood. Though they were allies, they should split up upon entering to maximize their profits. He agreed softly, watching as Tianhuo gently sent his juniors in.

Li Ximing, however, was laughing inwardly. On the surface, he pretended to close his eyes and concentrate, casually tearing open a rift in the Great Void as if he had no interest in what was inside. But secretly, he had already begun to focus his spirit.

'Li Clan disciple Ximing respectfully requests the Immortal Mirror to patrol the shadows and seek the minute, to see through the profound, to illuminate the eight directions, to capture ghosts and investigate spirits...'

# Chapter 972: The Disturbance

The assembled Purple Mansion experts reined in their divine abilities, sending streams of figures descending into the Mystic Realm in sequence. Li Ximing feigned humility and held back, but his spiritual sense had already drifted through the realm like a crisp wind sweeping over a mountain pass.

It was impossible to claim that the Purple Mansion cultivators had no way to scout ahead. Although this Mystic Realm was like a chessboard, one that couldn't be understood without personally playing, some among them still had their methods. Whether through high Dao-Profundity in the divinatory arts, potent Life Divine Abilities, or unique Spiritual Artifacts, they could, after all, make some calculations.

But no matter what they calculated, how could any of it compare to his Spirit Probe?

Li Ximing's thoughts raced. He sent his sense directly toward the main, orthodox-looking great hall. He paid no mind to the 'Great Purple Light Formation' or its 'profound spiritual patterns,' simply unraveling their complexities and seeing everything clearly.

He saw that Southern Township Hall was bare of tables or chairs. In the center stood nine massive bronze cauldrons, swirling with a heavy, turbid purple light. He couldn't identify the Daoist tradition, but the style and appearance were remarkably similar to those he had seen in the Great Ning Palace long ago.

Cauldrons like these would ultimately be divided among the major families, so they weren't the most important prize. His attention went to the high seat at the head of the hall. It was adorned with glittering gemstones and churning mercury-like liquid. It seemed someone had achieved liberation here, passing away in meditation. A dharma robe floated near the seat, and hidden within its folds was a brilliantly shining, purple-glowing orb.

'That must be a Spiritual Artifact,' Li Ximing thought. 'From the look of it, the quality is exceptional. I wonder if it might even be a Spiritual Treasure...'

His own Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger was, to put it generously, barely mid-grade; it couldn't possibly compare. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd was a special case. With its Bright Yang nature of scorning the weak, its true power depended heavily on its wielder. He privately estimated that while it was a step below Xiukui's trump card, the high-grade Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, it could still overwhelm the Spiritual Artifacts of many other Daoist Masters.

In ancient times, Grotto-Heavens were plentiful. The great cultivators of various Dao Lineages often collaborated, using these Grotto-Heavens as a foundation to construct Mystic Realms, just like this Southern Township Hall. Setting aside the potential harvests within the Grotto-Heaven itself, just being able to take a large bite out of a Mystic Realm like this was a significant gain. On a smaller scale, later cultivators with less power would create minor halls and chambers attached to the periphery of such realms, but those were hardly worth mentioning.

He silently memorized the location. Finding an unoccupied spot, he locked onto two or three smaller palace halls, his spiritual sense sweeping over them with incredible speed. Finally, just as nearly everyone else had sent their disciples in, he found a pavilion of considerable value and managed to send his group inside.

This place appeared to be a repository belonging to the Southern Township Dao Lineage, used for cultivating spiritual resources. The upper level was sealed by a small formation that used several Foundation Establishment Realm-grade spiritual items to nourish the resources within. Although most of the items had long since dried up, the resources inside the formation still pulsed with a purple light, a clear sign that a harvest was waiting.

He discreetly gave his juniors their instructions and pointed them in the right direction. He had intended to withdraw his wondrous sense, but as his gaze swept the area, he suddenly noticed a man from the Golden Feather Sect. The moment this person landed in the Mystic Realm, he immediately bid farewell to his disciple-brothers. Without the slightest hesitation or pretense, he made a beeline for the most valuable cache of spiritual items in the vicinity. It was Su Yan.

This made Li Ximing pull back his gaze, and he glanced inadvertently at Tianhuo, who stood beside him, seemingly lost in thought.

'The Golden Feather Sect... Su Yan inherited the legacy of the Chen Clan from Lingyu Gate. That settles it. The Chen Clan of Lingyu Gate is indisputably from the old Ning State... which means he has a profound connection to both the Ning State and... Wanling Heaven!'

Seeing this, how could Li Ximing not understand? He sighed inwardly but was filled with admiration. 'Truly, one move calculated three steps ahead. All that talk about wanting the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture, all that effort to secure the Lingyu Gate inheritance... The Golden Feather Sect must have known for ages that Wanling Heaven would eventually face this day. Their real objective was always inside this Grotto-Heaven's Mystic Realm!'

After all, what did the historical records say? The Sima, Su, Xi, and Xiao families... all met at Jiangbei. Following the lead of the Li and Jiang, they founded the Great Ning State. And among those founding families was the surname _Su_!

Tianhuo merely smiled, saying nothing. Li Ximing couldn't help but feel a pang of pity for him.

'So, the Golden Feather Sect's original plan involved my Li family. But something changed, the plan was abandoned, and after years of struggle, Su Yan finally emerged. But by then, far too much time had passed... According to their original timeline, they probably expected to be entering this place with a Purple Mansion Realm expert who had already mastered the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture!'

As he was lost in thought, clashes already echoed from within the Mystic Realm. Suddenly, a plume of white qi swept in from the west, transforming as it moved. Li Ximing clearly saw Tianque's expression darken as he turned his cold gaze toward it. The white qi solidified before them, revealing a single figure.

The man stood atop a black, flowing stream of light. He had clear, handsome features, and his Daoist robes were simple and unadorned. He held a single, hazy grey orb in his hand. The divine abilities coalescing around him revealed he was, surprisingly, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

He grinned broadly. "Daoist friends, it has been a long time! Your divine abilities have certainly progressed!"

Tianhuo hadn't experienced a significant breakthrough in his divine abilities for decades, whereas this man had clearly reached the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm some time ago. The comment was undeniably laced with sarcasm, earning a cold sneer from Tianhuo.

"So, it's Daoist Friend Qing. You seem quite at ease these days. Your thoughts must be clear and unobstructed... no wonder you broke through."

Hearing the surname Qing, Li Ximing knew he had to be a Daoist Master from Mount Changhuai. Sure enough, the man chuckled, then turned his head to face Li Ximing.

"I am Qing Jifang of the Changhuai Dao, Daoist name Ziwu. You must be Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing had absolutely no good impression of this man. Whether from rumors or from his own elder's account of meeting him when Yuansu died, he was thoroughly unlikable. But the Changhuai Dao was powerful. Li Ximing replied with a cool, detached tone:

"I have long heard of your great name."

Qing Jifang merely smiled, his expression unreadable. "I, too, have heard of Daoist Friend Li's name," he said casually. "But why do I not see your family's White Qilin?"

His gaze drifted past Li Ximing's face, his tone full of playful mockery. Li Ximing knew the man was arrogant and certainly looked down on him, likely only viewing someone like Li Zhouwei as an equal. Sneering inwardly, Li Ximing replied:

"Minghuang is currently in seclusion and has no time to accompany everyone... I must say, I've heard of the recent unrest in the Wu State. I'm surprised to see you so carefree, Daoist friend."

Qing Jifang sneered. A young man in grey-blue robes quickly stepped forward, looking rather exasperated as he tried to smooth things over. "It is merely a small disturbance, not worth mentioning."

Having interjected, the young man smiled.

"I am Qing Zhuo, Daoist name Guanlan. A pleasure to meet you, Daoist friend."

Li Ximing nodded in acknowledgment, just as Qing Jifang spoke again with a laugh:

"I've heard you are on excellent terms with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, which is quite fortunate. And yet, I see you've visited countless sects and schools, but you seem to have skipped over my Mount Changhuai. Instead, you've been a very diligent visitor to Sun-Worshipping Mountain. I can't quite puzzle out the reason for that!"

Qize was, at least nominally, under the jurisdiction of Mount Changhuai. And Sun-Worshipping Mountain was famous for its connections to the various Supreme Yang Daoist traditions. Qing Jifang did have a point, if he truly wanted to press the issue. But Li Ximing couldn't be bothered to wrangle with him.

"It was a personal matter arranged by Daoist Master Xiukui, to help him refine some medicinal pills. He was the one who sought me out at the lake. If any offense was given, I must trouble you to take it up with the Great Xiukui Monastery."

The Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery was currently in seclusion, so there was no one to ask and no way to verify the story. As Li Ximing finished, Tianhuo suddenly laughed out loud.

"Qing Jifang, what business is this of yours? I've also been to Sun-Worshipping Mountain. I've even been to see the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal! So what?"

The Daoist Master from Mount Changhuai shot Li Ximing a glance, then turned back to Tianhuo. "Tianhuo, I won't waste any more words on you. We'll settle this when we reach the 'North-Garden Hall'. This is just a warning, to save you from bringing trouble upon yourself!"

The two parties separated on bad terms. Li Ximing's expression remained serene, but a shadow crossed his thoughts. He calmly changed the subject. "Why isn't Daoist Friend Qinghu here?"

Si Yuanli may have only broken through recently, but as a Purple Mansion cultivator from Azure Pond, he certainly had the right to be here. In response to Li Ximing's question, Daoist Master Tianhuo replied in a leisurely tone:

"It's not convenient for him to show his face right now. The Si family was also an important noble family in the Ning State. Of the many Ning State families from back then, the only ones still holding influence are all sheltered under the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. One is his Si family, and the other is the Xi family of the Chunyi Dao Gate."

"Those two families definitely have a much deeper understanding of this Grotto-Heaven. They will certainly come, but they won't do so openly. After all, everyone is greedy. They can't guarantee someone won't secretly follow them or use some other trick..." He chuckled. "They'll wait until the Grotto-Heaven fully descends, then slip in quietly. They'll rely on their private knowledge and bloodline to take a healthy slice of the pie. They won't risk the greater good for a small gain!"

Li Ximing now understood Si Yuanli's absence. He nodded to himself. Seated in the Great Void, he closed his eyes and focused, simultaneously advancing his cultivation while casually observing the unfolding events below. After an unknown amount of time, a series of dull, heavy booms finally echoed from the purple expanse of the Mystic Realm.

The destructive power of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators was nothing to scoff at. With so many cultivators from both north and south gathered in one place, all fighting one another, the Mystic Realm was already a chaotic wreck despite its size. He raised an eyebrow and looked. It seemed some cultivators had already reached the front of Southern Township Hall.

He heard Tianhuo spit beside him. "Damned luck..."

It turned out the first group to arrive was from Mount Changhuai. Wielding a compass, they had been breaking seals and dismantling formations ever since they entered, enjoying an almost unimpeded path to the main hall. The treasure in their hands was clearly powerful. Even Su Yan, and Ding Weizeng—who had received pointers from Li Ximing—were several steps behind and had yet to reach it.

The main hall of Southern Township Hall involved the Mystic Realm's core, and was too strong for Foundation Establishment cultivators to breach. But Qing Jifang and the others looked calm, clearly prepared. As expected, their disciples below began to take out talismans.

_Boom!_

The purple light pulsed violently with the explosion. Streaks of light from all directions were drawn to the commotion, converging on the hall. The fighting intensified, a kaleidoscope of lights from different Dao Lineages flashing in the fray. Almost all the Purple Mansion experts had opened their eyes to watch the scene unfold.

Li Ximing raised his hand slightly, first extracting the injured Chen Yang and Li Wushao. Neither had a particularly high cultivation base or profound foundation, but luckily, each was more cunning than the last. Despite their injuries, they had managed to survive until the end. Chen Yang had even managed to snag an ancient dharma artifact: a Valley Water Dharma-Bead.

Next was Li Jianglong. He had been terribly unlucky, chased all the way by several Buddhist cultivators. Though he had grabbed his share of treasures, he was gradually forced into a dead end and was soon pulled from the Mystic Realm. Despite the frustration on his face, he silently rode the wind back down.

The battle in the main hall grew fiercer. The great cauldrons vibrated from the impacts. Pills streaked with black and gold light shot into the air, met by a storm of colliding abilities. Ding Weizeng, wielding his connected long-and-short staff with ferocious momentum, even drew a look of surprise from Tianhuo, who explained:

"So it's the Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill! No wonder it was being nurtured in an 'Ancient Azure Apothecary Cauldron'..."

Li Ximing's own attainment in the Dao of Alchemy was considerable, and he had also obtained the Secret Enclosure Dao Lineage, so he instantly recognized this famous spiritual pill, which was on par with the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill.

'The Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill...' he thought, delighted. 'It can enhance divine abilities and open a "Profound Palace" within the body to advance one's cultivation. It's compatible with countless techniques, as it belongs to the Pure Qi path—suitable for all methods.'

'Even better, the Profound Palace it creates isn't just for cultivation; it can temporarily absorb and store all kinds of Baleful Fire Qi, Baleful Demonic Qi, or even store a divine ability. Once a cultivator is finished with it, the stored power can either be digested in one go, or the "palace" can be expelled from the body and used as a one-time-use talisman. While useless to a Purple Mansion expert, it's an incredible life-saving item for a junior.'

Tianhuo shook his head with a trace of emotion. "The Nanxiang Dao Lineage back in the day... you couldn't afford to provoke their disciples, all because of this pill. Those old monsters would cultivate and expel these 'palaces' day after day, giving one to every junior they favored... How many cultivators of the same level would ever dare to provoke them?"

Li Ximing was extremely interested and nodded silently. The various experts in the Great Void watched the battle below as if it were a stage play. Some even took out tea and wine, sipping leisurely.

Li Ximing's gaze swept the crowd, and he couldn't help but chuckle. That fellow Li Jiangxia was also in the mix, fishing in troubled waters. He wasn't fighting for treasures or resources; instead, he was using his immortal foundation to deliver resounding blows to the Buddhist cultivators. With Ding Weizeng running interference for him, and the Buddhist cultivators themselves being disorganized, the other cultivators were more than happy to let him sow chaos and paid him no mind.

When the dust finally settled, the Spiritual Artifact ended up in the hands of the Viewing Pavilion. The apothecary cauldron was taken by the Mount Changhuai group. No major conflicts erupted, and no family went out of its way to make trouble. But as for what each group had actually managed to pocket, only they themselves knew.

Li Ximing, quite satisfied, pulled his two disciples out of the realm. Standing beside him in the Great Void, Ding Weizeng looked battered but triumphant.

"Well done!" Li Ximing praised.

Ding Weizeng wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and quickly presented the two pills he had secured. He then took out a separate jade box and handed it to Li Ximing, earning a satisfied nod from the Daoist Master. Naturally, the other miscellaneous spoils were not for his master's inspection.

But beside him, Li Jiangxia laughed. "Hold on."

This third young master had always been sharp. Compared to his brothers, he was more daring and more willing to take risks. He, too, had managed to secretly stash a jade bottle in his robes.

"Excellent!"

Li Ximing praised them again, his spiritual sense sweeping over their gains. Ding Weizeng's two pills were indeed the Nangong Xuan-Sui Pills. Li Jiangxia's bottle, taken from a Buddhist cultivator, contained an unnamed spiritual pill of the Gathering Wood path. The jade box from Ding Weizeng, which Li Ximing had guided him to using Spirit Probe, contained exactly what he had expected: a Purple Mansion-grade spiritual resource. It was a wisp of 'Heart-Taste Baleful Qi', and a resource of the Merging Fire path at that.

To have gained so much from a single Mystic Realm, Li Ximing couldn't help but smile. Beside him, Tianhuo was clearly just as pleased. "A fine harvest, Daoist friend! Congratulations!"

"And to you," Li Ximing replied with a smile.

'It truly takes a grand event like the fall of a Grotto-Heaven,' he mused. 'Otherwise, how long would it take to find even a single spiritual resource of this caliber?'

Just then, all the Purple Mansion experts looked up. Within the Great Void, streams of multicolored light appeared. From the four cardinal directions, four golden halls descended from the sky. They fell like collapsing towers, crashing heavily into the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter. The impact sent the masses of rogue cultivators into a frenzy. They swarmed toward the new structures like ants, heedless of the danger.

'Just some of the minor halls and chambers that were attached to Southern Township Hall,' Li Ximing identified them.

The contents of these minor halls were nothing compared to Southern Township Hall and were almost useless to Purple Mansion experts. Li Ximing wasn't interested and casually sent his two juniors down. Tianhuo did the same with his Golden Feather disciples, instructing, "Just go take a look. Save your energy for the Mystic Realms to come!"

Li Ximing's mind, however, was already elsewhere. He smiled and probed Tianhuo,

"I wonder how many more opportunities like this our juniors will have..."

Tianhuo shot him a glance and chuckled. "My elders said there should be two or three more Mystic Realms... The next one won't fall for at least half a year, so we still have time."

'I'm here buying time for Li Zhouwei. If there are two or three more realms, that should give him at least another year or so...' Li Ximing calculated silently, breathing an inward sigh of relief. His mind settled, he closed his eyes and returned to his meditation.

# Chapter 973: I Command the Laws of Heaven

Billowing Li Fire surged, gushing from the eight apertures. A host of divine abilities converged with the descending white light, casting a murky haze. This descent, however, stirred the crimson sea below, causing five streaks of red light to leap out in response, as if answering a call.

The Daoist Master withdrew his spiritual sense from his sea of qi, his heart swelling with joy.

'Six of them. All gathered!'

Six motes of Great Parting's Red Radiance. He was only a short way from the full set of nine. Including the one he had already condensed using Talisman Qi, mastering this cultivation technique was finally within reach. Li Ximing, inwardly ecstatic, slowly opened his eyes.

The violet-gold light before him still flickered, but looking through the Great Void, he could see the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter below had been utterly transformed. Mounds of white bones now lay crushed beneath the ruined walls of immortal palaces. The dense, opulent ruins shimmered as intricate, profound patterns crisscrossed their surfaces, weaving a tapestry of breathtaking beauty. The thick, cloying aura of resentment was now completely concealed beneath this immortal sheen.

It was as if this place had never been the graveyard for millions of souls.

Remnant formations and restrictive seals twisted together in a chaotic dance of multicolored light, still struggling for stability. The moment one settled, a new minor Mystic Realm or spirit hall would come crashing down, rendering the entire Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter complex beyond description. Despite the chaos, countless beams of light—cultivators—darted through the ruins, risking life and limb. They scrambled to snatch treasures before the seals could stabilize, frequently breaking into vicious fights that showered the ground below with blood and gore.

Meanwhile, the glow within the Great Void pulsed as the violet-gold Mystic Realm slowly sealed itself. Li Ximing sighed to himself.

'That's the third one.'

Tianhuo's estimate had been correct. As Wanling Heaven drew ever closer to the mortal world, three major Mystic Realms had fallen in succession.

All three followed the same pattern. First, the Purple Mansion Realm experts allowed their core disciples inside to feast. Next, an entrance to the mortal world would appear, allowing countless clans and Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivators to flood in and fight over the scraps. Finally, what little remained of the realm—the dregs of the soup—would crash into the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter. This ignited a desperate free-for-all among the Qi Refining cultivators, even as the accompanying minor Mystic Realms rained down like meteors, a chaotic finishing touch.

These three Mystic Realms were the Southern Township Hall, the Capital-Return Tower, and the Gorge Mountain Palace. They fell in perfect sequence. They not only filled the former territory of the Three Secret Diffusion Caves near Baijiang Creek, but a large part of the Capital-Return Tower even spilled over onto Xiaoshi Mountain. If the Gorge Mountain Palace before him finished its descent, it would likely claim a significant portion of the Capital immortals Dao's territory. Calculating it carefully, the three realms now formed a ring around the entire Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.

Li Ximing watched these three acts conclude, an unnameable feeling stirring in his heart.

'How perfectly orderly.'

The Capital-Return Tower and Gorge Mountain Palace were both smaller than the Southern Township Hall, making the competition inside even more brutal. The Li family's harvest from the Capital-Return Tower had been substantial; their Foundation Establishment Realm experts had secured two spiritual pills and a spiritual resource. The Gorge Mountain Palace, however, was a different story. Valuable items were scarce to begin with, and Su Yan had nearly swept the entire place clean! The Li family only came away with a clutch of dharma artifacts and the single spiritual pill Li Ximing had located himself...

He couldn't blame the younger generation for this. The Gorge Mountain Palace was the only Mystic Realm in the north where they had truly failed to secure a major prize. Besides, the Li family contingent was exhausted and simply couldn't compete with the manpower of the other factions.

The three spiritual pills were the 'Hundred-Night Heart-Glimpsing Elixir,' which dispelled illusions; two 'Treasured Star Body-Spirit Pills' for healing injuries to one's dharma body; and a Blazing Fire spiritual resource called the 'Rising Warmth Stone,' which could likely be used in artifact refining. All in all, the haul was quite satisfactory.

Thanks to Spirit Probe, and factoring in their harvest from the Southern Township Hall, the Li family's total gains were still respectable. They had even managed to build Ding Weizeng's reputation as the Palace-Yang Tiger. Tianhuo had offered his congratulations several times, calling Ding Weizeng a 'lucky general.' But Li Ximing knew the truth. A significant gap remained between Ding Weizeng and the truly elite disciples. Against a powerful opponent, Ding Weizeng's strengths couldn't even match their shortcomings, while his own flaws were ruthlessly exploited. He had only survived by being adept at escaping during a chaotic melee.

'Lucky general? Hardly. If it weren't for his own solid cultivation and the Palace-Yang Tiger's uncanny ability to escape confinement, he never would have lasted. He would have lost his treasures and been forced out long ago.'

As the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators retreated, wondrous phenomena continued to fill the Great Void, yet no new Mystic Realm descended. The expressions of the assembled Purple Mansion Realm experts slowly turned grave. Li Ximing stroked the jade pendant at his waist, but refrained from crushing it, his gaze fixed intently on the Great Void.

_Om—!_

Time passed in a blink. After only a few months of quiet, a faint arc of light emerged from the Great Void. The surrounding spiritual energy erupted into a violent frenzy, and far below, the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter began to shake violently!

Water and fire wove through the sky, metal and earth transmuted, spontaneously creating new spiritual phenomena. Several streaks of light pierced the distance, hovering on the periphery. Li Ximing frowned as he scanned them; he recognized several 'acquaintances.' That fiend, Daoist Master Luo, even shot him a leering, conspiratorial grin.

'Even that fiend knows better than to approach...'

He was still processing this when a woman flew out from the Great Void. She wore a pale cyan Daoist robe and had a tall, slender figure. Her features were gentle—a soft, rounded nose and kind eyes that crinkled at the corners, which even her cold, formal expression couldn't fully conceal. She smiled warmly.

"Fellow Daoist Li!"

Li Ximing looked, and recognition dawned. He quickly returned the smile.

"So it is Fellow Daoist Kuang Yu!"

This was none other than Daoist Master Kuang Yu, the cultivator who had claimed the Xinyu Archipelago. Li Ximing had enjoyed their conversation back then and was surprised to meet her here. She smiled playfully.

"I came across a pool of Wall-Sinking Water the other day and just so happened to be bringing it to you."

She retrieved a small, sky-blue pot from her sleeve. It was only an ordinary dharma artifact, nothing particularly valuable. As she placed it in his hand, her gaze met Tianhuo's, who was standing nearby. The woman's smile instantly stiffened with awkwardness.

In the past, Hengzhu and Golden Feather had been rivals, and Kuang Yu had been a firm follower of Hengxing. Now, with Hengzhu in deep seclusion, she had just run into a representative of the monolithic Golden Feather sect. 'Awkward' didn't begin to cover it.

Li Ximing had a good impression of her, but sensing the palpable tension, he didn't dare speak. Suddenly, the heavens rained down illusory flowers as violet-gold light flooded the Great Void. A violent tremor, so powerful it seemed to pierce his very spiritual sense, rang in his ears.

_BOOM!_

The shock made his ears ring and his nose sting. He snapped his head up, his eyes widening. The world before him had exploded with light. The Purple Mansion Realm experts exchanged glances, and in an instant, several of them transformed into streaks of light, hurtling toward the violet-gold radiance. Li Ximing glanced to his side—Tianhuo was already gone!

'The Grotto-Heaven is opening?!'

But he held back, his gaze sweeping the area. He noted that many cultivators from the north remained stationary in the Great Void, their expressions grim. He heard Kuang Yu's low voice beside him.

"There's a window of about a quarter-hour before the Grotto-Heaven fully manifests. Those with special Great Void movement techniques or Spiritual Artifacts can slip in early... Those major powers have their methods, so they're naturally taking the lead."

"Oh? Doesn't that mean they'll get first pick?"

Li Ximing frowned.

"That's not a problem," Kuang Yu continued softly. "It's not that easy to force an entry. We probably have another fifteen minutes. It takes them a good while to find an opening and bypass the barriers. At absolute best, they get a seven- or eight-minute head start. Usually, it's even less."

'That's still a significant advantage...'

Li Ximing was still mulling this over when Kuang Yu, beside him, suddenly stiffened and choked, as if a red-hot blade had been thrust at her face. A wave of intense heat washed over them. She snapped her head up, her face ice-cold.

"Who!"

He saw an arching bridge of True Fire blaze across the Great Void. Flanking it, phalanxes of armored soldiers that writhed like dragons charged forward. His vision was filled with a sea of deep red. At its center, a middle-aged man trod the flames, sword in hand, its tip leveled directly at them. The golden-red patterns on his regal robes seemed to writhe, and his eyes were devoid of all warmth. He was charging them!

The man was silent, but the scorching intent from his blade felt like a physical spike stabbing into Li Ximing's eyes, sending a chill down his spine.

"Shilou Yingge?!"

This was none other than the Gao family's mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm True Fire expert from the north—Shilou Yingge!

'What is this madness?!'

In full view of everyone, while all the Purple Mansion Realm experts were waiting to enter the Grotto-Heaven, he had waited for Tianhuo to leave and then launched a vicious ambush. His blade, brimming with a ferocious True Fire divine ability, stabbed forward with undisguised, full-powered killing intent. Instantly, every expert present turned to watch, their eyes cold and detached.

Li Ximing was stunned. The Heavenly Light between his brows flared instinctively as Monarch's Balance materialized in the void. Its cyan-and-yellow patterns of mountains and rivers rippled outward. But the attacker's pupils swirled with golden light. The deep-red, fiery bridge had already torn a path through his defense, shattering the mountain patterns and allowing the sword to continue, unimpeded, straight for his chest!

_BOOM!_

A burst of Heavenly Light erupted in the Great Void. Audience with the Celestial Gate manifested, resisting the cascading torrent of True Fire. The clash instantly drew every eye. Shilou Yingge pressed his attack relentlessly. A golden-red True Fire treasure seal dropped from his sleeve, instantly swelling to the size of a mountain as it smashed down on Li Ximing's divine ability.

Shilou Yingge was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. The force of the blow made Li Ximing's chest tighten, and he was so furious he almost laughed. He glared coldly at the descending golden seal.

'Your divine ability is far stronger than mine, I'll grant you that. But you're Shilou Yingge, not Wei Xuanyin! You think you can shatter the Bright Yang Audience with the Celestial Gate in just a few moves? Do you really think I'm made of mud?!'

As the two powers clashed, Kuang Yu's expression changed. Shilou Yingge's mountain-sized golden seal had targeted her as well!

"What is the meaning of this!"

The woman clapped her hands before her chest and gave a gentle push. With that single motion, she broke the seal's lock on her and vanished. But that soft push carried deceptive power, causing the massive golden seal to visibly tremble.

In that brief moment of instability, Li Ximing felt as if the entire seal had been momentarily displaced from the Great Void. He seized the opening in a flash. His divine ability dissipated, the Heavenly Light flowing back into his body.

He took the opportunity to retreat a step, his face grim. Shilou Yingge's expression was utterly unchanged. Ignoring the vanished Daoist Master Kuang Yu, he raised his longsword, which now pulsed with the full, unadulterated power of his True Fire divine ability, glowing a pure, incandescent red. He pressed two fingers of his other hand to the sword's pommel.

"Strike!"

The True Fire divine ability flared, and the golden seal hovering in the Great Void shot forward. Li Ximing faced the Gao family's Daoist Master with a cold, fearless smile.

Light bloomed from the shadows. A beam of Heavenly Light pierced the void, taking the shape of an iridescent, crescent-moon blade that chimed musically. With a resounding _clang_, it struck the attacking sword, causing the True Fire to detonate prematurely, sending shockwaves in all directions.

_BOOM!_

A pair of impassive golden eyes reflected in Shilou Yingge's gaze. An even more intense aura of True Fire blazed to life behind the newcomer, framing him like a god of flame. He saw a long halberd flick, casually slinging aside a sheet of True Fire, its blade gleaming with its own inner light.

The golden-eyed youth advanced, treading on white light and purple flames, wreathed in resplendent Heavenly Light. His expression was severe, his grip firm on the halberd's shaft. Its tip, sharp as a pinpoint of pure radiance, was aimed directly at Shilou Yingge's throat.

"If the Shilou family is so eager to pledge its loyalty, you can prove it inside the Grotto-Heaven. There is no need to stand here and bark before the assembled powers."

Shilou Yingge's face contorted with rage, but his eyes remained dangerously cold. In that instant, every gaze was fixed on the confrontation—some observers smirking, others carefully assessing. Countless hushed messages passed through the void.

'It's the Bright Yang's qilin-son...'

...

Far from the confrontation, in the vastness of the Great Void, a colossal violet-gold arc was silently manifesting. Blue and white light intertwined within it, reflecting myriad scenes from the mortal world. The obfuscating colors, which moments ago had baffled divination arts and concealed divine abilities, were now fading. Layer upon layer of light was revealed, and piercing through them, one could glimpse rows of ancient palaces.

Long, carved feathers beneath the eaves swayed gently. The great halls were eerily empty. Compared to the imperial grandeur of Anhuai Heaven, these palaces were less imposing but far more exquisite, suffused with a transcendent, immortal air.

'This is a true immortal abode, after all!'

Furthermore, unlike the imperial, structured layout of Anhuai Heaven, this place was a landscape of towering peaks and sheer cliffs. The mountains were spaced far apart. At their summits sat immortal thrones, meditation cushions, jade tables, lotus platforms, or Daoist couches. The more distant peaks showed wildly different architectural styles, each unique.

Lu Jiangxian, veiled as a wisp of white light, had already been observing this place for some time. His Divine Sense was far more potent than ordinary Spiritual Sense, and his Immortal Mirror now possessed the ability to traverse the Great Void, allowing him to scrutinize Wanling Heaven in detail.

He drifted idly through the domain. Nearly every immortal peak was deserted, empty of life. All that remained were skeletons and the shed husks of immortals, most of whom had clearly died from grievous, untreated wounds or the simple exhaustion of their lifespans.

'Empty... just like the others.'

He moved, reappearing at the foot of the central, highest peak. This mountain was set apart; the nearest peak was over a hundred _li_ distant, leaving the mountain to stand alone in a vast, open plain. But as he passed through the remnants of a great formation, he saw the plain was nothing but ruins. The once-exquisite Daoist palaces and high platforms had been violently toppled, the wreckage crisscrossed with vicious sword scars. The entire plain was a field of rubble.

Lu Jiangxian stopped, his gaze complex as he stared at the scene.

It wasn't treasure that made him stop. It was the skeletons. The ruins were filled with a dense, countless mass of kneeling skeletons. They were entirely different from the scattered, misshapen, resentment-filled bones in the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter. These were packed body-to-body, pressed tightly together, yet every single one was frozen in the identical posture: kneeling, hands placed on their knees, torsos bowed in deep reverence. Their bones gleamed with a faint, crystalline light. But as his gaze traveled upward, past their ribs, he realized that every last skeleton was headless.

The plain held tens of millions of skeletons, arranged in concentric circles, all kneeling _toward_ the same direction—facing the central mountain peak as if in supplication.

The skeletons were clad in tattered armor or Daoist robes; some still clutched weapons. Lu Jiangxian passed through this dense sea of bone in silence.

The deeper he walked, the more he encountered the shed husks of cultivators in spiritual robes, some in magnificent vestments adorned with thirty-six spiritual feathers—clearly the remains of high-level disciples. Finally, at the very foot of the central mountain, he saw the only figure left standing.

This figure stood guard at the base of the path. It was clad in a deep-red, velvet-trimmed crane cloak embroidered with golden scriptures, the sleeves spreading wide like wings. A ritual sash draped down its back. The figure was tall, standing in silent vigil. But at its neck was a perfectly clean, horizontal cut. The head was gone.

On the ground nearby, a head lay rolled in the dust. It had a high-bridged nose and long brows, its features handsome and severe. But its eyes were closed tight, concealing whatever charisma it once possessed.

The headless corpse held a longsword, its tip angled toward the ground. Streaks of crimson blood had run down the blade, coagulating at its point, where they formed an intricate pattern that pulsed with a terrifying, condensed divine ability.

Yet another corpse.

He swept his gaze over it. The Spiritual Sword in its hand, though its light was dim, was of exceptionally high quality—likely a Spiritual Treasure. The various other Spiritual Artifacts on its person were, without exception, all first-class items.

'This was at least a late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator... possibly even at the peak.'

A wind rose, whistling as it brushed past the sword's edge, creating a sharp, humming keen. The robes on the thousands of surrounding corpses billowed and flapped limply in the breeze. A dense, heavy Sword Intent still permeated the air.

'This lingering Sword Intent... this person was a master. Stronger than Chi Buzi or Wei Xuanyin.'

Lu Jiangxian stepped past the headless guard and ascended the stairs. His divine sense had already surged over every corner, comparing the sword scars on the ruins with the wound on the guard. A grim understanding slowly formed in his mind.

'The same sword destroyed this place, slaughtered all these people, and killed this guard. And this cultivator... he likely killed himself.'

Lu Jiangxian had not seen a single other living soul. Piecing the clues together—the lingering Sword Intent, the nature of the wounds, the arrangement of the dead—he made a swift deduction.

'The Wanling Upper Sect was famously a loose coalition of minor temples. The time for Wanling Heaven to seal itself must have arrived. This cultivator... he must have been at the end of his life. He feared the Grotto-Heaven's many factions and worried that his descendants would rashly open the realm, compromising with the True Monarchs of the outside world... So, he used some divine ability to lure everyone here, slaughtered them all, and then took his own life.'

'How ruthless... to wipe them all out in a single stroke. No wonder there has been no word of the true Wanling Daoist tradition for all these years. Only a few of the Four Secret Dao Lineages managed to survive in the outside world.'

He continued up the mountain path. The summit was marked by four towering pagodas, one in each cardinal direction, each built in the image of the four divine abilities of the Capital Guard. The pagodas were filled with spiritual objects and resources, but more importantly, each one was actively suppressing a Spiritual Treasure!

He scanned them with his divine sense. They were: Water Mansion, Merging Fire, Treasured Earth, and Gathering Wood.

'Truly, an extravagant display!'

This was a world apart from the sealed Anhuai Heaven of Ning State. The great families of Ning State had been scattered, and even the royal bloodline had reappeared in the outer world. Anhuai Heaven had been picked over by those families, its value greatly diminished. Only those three items of Metallic Essence had been precious enough to cause an indecent brawl. But Wanling Heaven had sealed itself abruptly, trapping sixty or seventy percent of its entire wealth within!

Furthermore, these four Spiritual Treasures were only honored with pagodas due to their ancient legacy. He could sense other Spiritual Artifacts scattered on the other peaks! Lu Jiangxian did a quick mental tally. There were nearly enough for every Purple Mansion Realm expert waiting outside to get one.

He gave the treasures a cursory glance, crossed a series of blue-and-white tiled platforms, and stopped before a massive, heavy gate of pure white jade. This was the true mountain gate of Wanling Heaven. Two columns of ancient script were carved into the frame.

The right: 【Alchemists Must Hearken to Me】
The left: 【The Two Poles Grant Me Mystery】

He looked up at the plaque above the gate, which bore four golden characters:

【I Command the Laws of Heaven】

The words radiated an inviolable, chilling majesty. Beneath the golden script, violet-white lightning flickered, a faint echo of the ancient Thunder Palace Emissaries who once decreed the laws, commanded the storms, and suppressed all under heaven.

"'I Command the Laws of Heaven...'"

His gaze was heavy. He took another step, passed through the gate, and entered the most sacred, secret heart of the Wanling Sect.

【The Lingyang Immutable Palace】

Behind the gate, colors swirled and silver light pulsed. His view was filled with a cascading, overlapping vision of gold and white. Ninety-nine white arches were layered, one within the other, interlocked and resonating in harmony with the palace itself. The entire palace... it was a single, unified Dharma Treasure!

But Lu Jiangxian did not spare the Dharma Treasure a single glance. His gaze was fixed, locked onto the silver radiance imprisoned within the ninety-nine arches. This silver light was like a web of silk, bursting from a single point in the void and fanning out in gossamer filaments. All the light pulsed from a single source, trembling eagerly as it radiated an intense, overwhelming pressure.

Around this silver light, illusory scenes fell like waterfalls: flashes of purple light dissipating as a Grotto-Heaven collapsed; water and fire merging; metal and earth transmuting; a surge of blood-red light as a divine ability was extinguished. It seemed to be broadcasting an endless stream of warnings.

But the Lingyang Immutable Palace was utterly empty.

That familiar, pulsing light... it radiated a profound mystery he knew well. His expression was complex. He recognized it at a glance.

"The Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination!"

This was the source of Liu Changdie's delusions of reincarnation, the very same Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination that had aided him countless times in his early cultivation! The object he had sought for so long was finally here. It truly was inside Wanling Heaven!

"'A Golden Core-level Talisman Qi!'"

It wasn't that Lu Jiangxian had never encountered a Golden Core-level clue before. During his previous journey to Eastern Yue, he had distantly sensed a Golden Core-level Talisman Qi. But by the time his Divine Sense had expanded and the Li family had taken control of Eastern Yue, that aura was long gone. Even from that fleeting glimpse, he had known it wasn't the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination.

But this, the true, tangible body of the Talisman Qi—the Yellow Register at its core—this was the first time Lu Jiangxian had ever truly seen it!

"'So it was suppressed and guarded by the Lingyang Immutable Palace all this time. No wonder my search throughout all of Jiangnan yielded nothing!'"

He stared for a long moment, careful not to alert the Dharma Treasure. He carefully sensed the changes within the Talisman Qi, and a strange suspicion began to grow in his heart.

'This Talisman Qi... it feels as if it has already formed its own body...'

The Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination before him felt fundamentally different from the unbestowed talismans he possessed. It didn't feel empty or untethered. It felt solid, rooted, like a stabilizing pillar set in the ocean. It felt... as if it already had a master.

His Dao-Profundity was worlds beyond what it had once been. Even without touching the Talisman Qi, he narrowed his eyes and focused his senses. Slowly, a series of anomalies became clear to him.

"'It's been tampered with. Extensively. Perhaps some True Monarch found this and studied it in secret, using countless methods, spiritual items, and even Metallic Essence to forcibly refine it into a Dharma Treasure! That would explain its stable, corporeal nature—why it's so solid it requires another Dharma Treasure just to suppress it!'"

He calculated silently, the truth becoming clearer. He could indeed sense the aura of Metallic Essence within it. Unlike other Dao Lineages he had encountered, this Metallic Essence originated from Ancient Merging and was exceptionally rare.

It was called... Heaven–Governing.

The Dao Lineage of the Mount Dali Fox Clan!

'All these methods, woven together around this Talisman Qi and this specific Metallic Essence... the sheer skill of the cultivator who did this is truly rare in this world!'




# Chapter 974: Rank Designation

The ninety-nine Profound Gates of the Lingyang Immutable Palace blazed with golden light, unleashing ninety-nine rays of suppressive brilliance. They converged on a single point, like countless eyes suspended in the void, all fixed upon the silver gleam.

'To think it's already reached the point where a Dharma Treasure is needed for suppression...'

Yet the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination offered no resistance. Instead, time and time again, it loyally issued warnings, illuminating the myriad possible changes of the future as they constantly evolved within the Dharma Treasure's narrow confines.

He watched the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination, a quiet understanding dawning in his heart. He finally saw why a Dharma Treasure was necessary for this. Raising one hand palm-up, he manifested a ball of silver light.

The Power of Divination.

This was the very thing the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination had sensed and released all those years ago. Its wondrous aspect had attached itself to Liu Changdie. Later, when it came within range of the Immortal Mirror, Lu Jiangxian had retrieved it from Liu Changdie due to the Talisman Qi resonance. He had used it several times, leaving only this tiny speck behind.

This minuscule amount wasn't enough for any major divination; at most, it could perform a single calculation of fortune and misfortune. As Lu Jiangxian's Dao-Profundity increased, he grew reluctant to expend it on something like analyzing cultivation methods. He had kept it in reserve ever since.

Now, as he pinched the star-bright speck of silver light in his palm, it surged like boiling water. The silver light in the white-haired man's eyes intensified. Guided by the Talisman Qi resonance between the speck and the main Talisman, the light in his hand rapidly shifted, forming the image of a middle-aged man in white robes.

Liu Changdie.

However, the Liu Changdie in the vision was pale, his aura weak, and his cultivation low. This was the Liu Changdie the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination had foreseen years ago. As Lu Jiangxian poured in a stream of dharma power and Talisman Qi, time itself flowed backward, and the scenes began to reverse.

The image finally settled on a naive-looking young man. But unlike the abrupt stop when Lu Jiangxian had previously viewed his memories, this vision continued to rewind. A silver light flowed backward out of the young man, crossed countless obstacles, and returned to reveal the landscape of Wanling Heaven.

In this memory, the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination was nothing like its current, docile self. It struggled frantically, its dense silver light shaking the Lingyang Immutable Palace to its core. The ninety-nine Profound Gates swayed in chaos, their spiritual light scattering, threatening to shatter the world.

But no matter how the Talisman struggled, the Lingyang Immutable Palace held it firm. Yet, for one brief instant, the silver light flared and surged. Its very status elevated sharply, allowing a part of it to break free...

Lu Jiangxian's heart tightened. As information flooded his mind, memories surged to the surface.

'This is... the moment that first sliver of Talisman Qi was bestowed!'

'Back then, the Li family was just a minor clan in Lijing. After I repaired the fragment, I bestowed the first Talisman Qi upon them, one called "Aegis of Life." But that was the very first time. My methods and power were still lacking, and the act triggered a powerful resonance from all quarters...'

'That must have been when it happened...'

'The Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination had been suppressed in Wanling Heaven by the Lingyang Immutable Palace for ages. The artifact possesses a spirit of its own; day after day, it calculated, seeking a path to freedom. My bestowing of Talisman Qi created a resonance. This allowed the Talisman to suddenly elevate its status, slipping a single wondrous aspect out of the Lingyang Immutable Palace!'

'This wondrous aspect drifted aimlessly until it landed on Liu Changdie. It divined his future for him. When I stumbled upon it, its power wasn't depleted; it still held several divinations. Its ultimate goal was to guide Liu Changdie, step by step, to advance his cultivation, unveil Wanling Heaven, and release the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination!'

'But I intercepted that wondrous aspect halfway. Then, some unknown Daoist tradition interfered and severed his original path, forcing him to cultivate the Vault Metal. In the end, it only secured his opportunity to reach the Purple Mansion Realm, but at least his life was saved.'

But looking at it now, this item shouldn't be called the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination anymore. It has already transformed into a Dharma Treasure, now called the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book!

Just as Lu Jiangxian had sensed long ago, the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book divines the future, calculates profound mysteries, measures karmic threads, and governs all that is undecided, all while shielding heavenly secrets... More importantly, this artifact is entangled with the Metallic Essence of 'Heaven–Governing' and is deeply connected to the Golden Position. It is an object of world-shaking significance.

From Lu Jiangxian's perspective, this artifact could be called the Heaven–Governing Rank Designation.

The term 'Rank Designation' had been mentioned by the Si Xunhui before. Even the Li family had heard of it; the Si family's deep roots allowed them to recall the term. They only knew it as an alias for a Dharma Treasure, but they were unaware of the profound difference between a Rank Designation and a typical Dharma Treasure.

A Rank Designation was not something just anyone could possess. It was formed when a cultivator of immense divine ability verified their path against a Golden Position, using the Great Void to borrow a sliver of that position's status. To call it a Dharma Treasure was inaccurate; it was more like a fragment of the Golden Position itself—like a 'Fruition,' 'Intercalary,' or 'Auxillary' aspect. It was less an object belonging to a True Monarch and more an object belonging to the Golden Position.

Take the Heart-Awakening Sword of Pristine Water. According to Lu Jiangxian's deductions, Du Qing's own divine ability was likely insufficient to condense the Pristine Water Rank Designation. It must have been forged when the Feathered Serpent first achieved the Dao. Seated in the high position of Pristine Water, it used its own great divine ability—pledging its very identity as the Master of Pristine Water as collateral—to borrow status from the Pristine Water Fruition Attainment. Only by combining this borrowed status with countless heavenly materials, and even Metallic Essence, was the Pristine Terrace Heart-Awakening Sword forged.

When the Feathered Serpent perished, the collateral itself vanished. Thus, the Pristine Terrace Heart-Awakening Sword, being a Rank Designation, fell back into the Pristine Water Fruition Attainment and disappeared. It was impossible for it to have fallen into the hands of the Dragon-kin.

When Du Qing ascended to the Pristine Water seat, he lacked the immense divine ability to borrow status from the Fruition Attainment himself. However, the Feathered Serpent had already completed the forging. As long as Du Qing held the status of the Master of Pristine Water, he could 'borrow' the Pristine Terrace Heart-Awakening Sword.

The sword could display its full power in Du Qing's hands, but the moment it left his grasp, it would dissipate into nothing.

And the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book was exactly the same! In all likelihood, it was sealed in this place when the revered holder of the 'Heaven–Governing' position was still in the world, and it had never been moved since!

Lu Jiangxian was certain that as long as the assembled True Monarchs had any desire to preserve this Dharma Treasure, they would never dare remove the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book from the Lingyang Immutable Palace. If the Book were given even a single instant to breathe, it would immediately fall back into the 'Heaven–Governing' position and disappear. To retrieve it again would require someone to first ascend to that very position.

'The original master of Wanling Heaven must have suppressed the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book here for this exact reason—to prevent it from vanishing!'

Lu Jiangxian understood perfectly. The reason the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book was refined as a Rank Designation was a clever workaround. The Immortal Mirror's control over Talisman Qi was terrifyingly absolute. The only way to preserve the Book was to counter the Mirror with an equally, insurpassably high Golden Position, binding it within the 'Rank Designation' itself.

As clarity dawned in Lu Jiangxian's mind, his gaze shifted back to the small Power of Divination in his hand.

"The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book is suppressed by the Lingyang Immutable Palace. That much is certain. Outside this grotto-heaven, True Monarchs are everywhere... yet they've made no move to retrieve it. I wonder what they're planning."

He sat down quietly within the Dharma Treasure. The silver light in his hand swirled, connecting with the main artifact through the Talisman Qi resonance. In an instant, all the profound marvels and mysteries of the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book were laid bare to him. A relentless, high-speed flood of divination results, calculations emerging moment by moment, poured frantically into his spiritual sense.

'No matter what, the longer this drags on, the better.'

...

The Great Void.

A brilliant white spear-point hung motionless, yet it commanded the presence of a sharpened blade. The surging True Fire parted before it, revealing a man's cold face. His magnificent robes, wreathed in True Fire, shimmered with light, painting an imposing figure.

But the golden seal from the sky had already stamped down once more!

"Rumble!"

A torrent of blazing True Fire poured down. Li Ximing's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' manifested, solidly blocking the Spiritual Artifact's blow. But Li Ximing was no longer alone. The bright spear-point lunged, forcing Shilou Yingge to raise a sleeve and wave it with immense presence.

"Sky-Enveloping Fire!"

In an instant, his robes billowed, rolling upward as the flames transformed into the shape of a great bird, binding the long halberd. But from deep within the True Fire, another blade of light erupted, slashing straight at his heart.

"Clang!"

Shilou Yingge was unfazed. His sleeve flared wide, and a bead of light shot out. It detonated with a thunderous crash, unleashing rolling lightning that shattered the light-blade. He did not press the attack. Instead, he dissolved into a cloud of True Fire and reappeared a short distance away, his expression serene.

Li Zhouwei's words had been harsh, but his reasoning was sound.

He, Shilou Yingge, had chosen this moment to strike precisely to declare his stance. The grotto-heaven was about to open, and nearly every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was gathered here. There would be no better time.

His Gao family needed a life-and-death battle against the Li!

The earlier skirmish on the shore had been nothing. Even when Murong Yan made his move, Shilou Yingge had held back. The Gao family certainly needed to show their colors, but the situation had been unclear. A token fight over the "North-South conflict" wouldn't be a mortal struggle, rendering it meaningless.

'Only by truly offending Li Zhouwei, by engaging in a battle with the real risk of death, can we truly sever ties with the Wei-Li!'

The stratagem they had laid years ago had been missed by a cruel twist of fate. The Murong family had warned him repeatedly. He understood just how dangerous his own Valiant King's pro-Li stance was, and just how humiliating their forced migration south had been. The heavier that humiliation, the stronger his desire to make his stance known. The only places left to do that were here, or inside the grotto-heaven!

'If the Gao family is to avoid becoming a sacrifice in the coming tide, if we are to have any hope of advancing, we must become a blade in someone's hand. Even if that means becoming a different _kind_ of sacrifice... it's better than the entire clan being exterminated.'

He couldn't guarantee that both Li members would enter the grotto-heaven, so he had struck decisively to force Li Zhouwei to appear. He had already resolved that even if Li Zhouwei failed to show, he, Shilou Yingge, would forgo the grotto-heaven's opportunities entirely, if necessary, to cripple Li Ximing and burn that bridge completely.

But the man before him had spoken. His words were laced with mockery, yet they were also perfectly, brutally honest:

'He, Li Zhouwei, would be entering the grotto-heaven. They could settle it inside!'

Wanling Heaven was no ordinary place. It was likely the most valuable grotto-heaven to appear in years; a single treasure from within might be worth a century of cultivation. If he could avoid missing this opportunity, Shilou Yingge was unwilling to do so. His feelings were complicated. The True Fire behind him slowly receded. Meanwhile, the turbulence in the Great Void intensified as shafts of purple light descended—other cultivators were already trying to force their way in.

Shilou Yingge watched him quietly and said in a low voice:

"You and I will settle this inside the grotto-heaven."

The crimson light receded like a tide, flowing away toward the grotto-heaven portal as purple-gold light began to converge. The long halberd spun once before coming to rest, poised in the void. Li Zhouwei retracted his gaze and turned to Li Ximing.

"My apologies for involving you, Grand-Uncle."

Li Ximing shook his head emphatically. Never mind the humiliation the other man had just dealt him; the mere sight of Li Zhouwei lifted his spirits. He grinned.

"What nonsense is that!"

He took a step forward, looking him up and down.

He saw that the young man before him had grown even more imposing. A faint, pale, illusory radiance cloaked his body, but most important were the two strands of golden light dancing faintly around him!

Even though he had already received the news via a jade talisman, Li Ximing couldn't help but beam. As expected, Li Zhouwei grinned.

"This junior was fortunate enough to succeed!"

At this moment, within Li Zhouwei's Shengyang Acupoint Mansion, two colors intertwined. Two multicolored lights flashed, a confluence of gold and white. He now possessed two divine abilities. In addition to the golden, profound unity of 'Audience with the Celestial Gate,' there was now a second, snow-white divine ability: the Supreme Radiance Profound Dharma Body's 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread'!

As a Body Divine Ability of the Bright Yang Dao, 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' was perfectly suited to Li Zhouwei, matching both his temperament and his circumstances. Its achievement was magnificent. Unlike formless Body Divine Abilities like 'Thousand-Hundred Body' or 'Spring's Echo' that focused on dispersal, this divine ability was all about empowering the physical self to tyrannically crush all enemies!

Li Zhouwei estimated that his own physical body had likely already reached the Maha level. If this Body Divine Ability reached major completion, he would advance even further.

And the true value of 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' was in its name—treading peril!

If he were besieged, the more dangerous his situation and the more enemies who surrounded him, the more terrifying the divine ability's enhancement would become. Li Zhouwei could even sense his 'White Qilin Fate,' which at its peak could add nearly ninety percent more power to 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread.'

On the other hand, if the besieging cultivators could overwhelm and kill him, all was well. But if he managed to escape, the 'peril-treading' would be a success. The more additional power 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' had accumulated, the faster all injuries sustained in that battle would heal!

Beyond its powerful combat enhancements, 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' also possessed the ability to adapt to the moment and return to the correct path. It was just as the Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass mentioned: "One who treads peril is deeply cautious; one who rests in safety grows careless." Whenever he was in the middle of a charge and was affected by illusion-type spell arts, he could instantly break free and regain his bearings.

'It's just a pity this divine ability is only useful when charging into battle...'

It also enhanced his flight and Great Void traversal speed, a common trait of a Body Divine Ability, though it wasn't as effective as the more ephemeral movement arts. Having only just formed, the boost was less than five percent.

But just as 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' had its drawback of being cumbersome, 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' also had a weakness. This Dharma Body was vulnerable to cumulative, entangling damage. It fared poorly against explosive, high-impact trauma like Sword Intent, sharp Metallic Essence, or lightning. But its greatest weakness was an enemy who simply refused to engage, instead using abilities like imprisonment, clones, dispersal, and illusion to stall for time...

The remaining minor marvels, such as a significant boost to the power of his 'Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light,' were too numerous to list. Most were helpful aids in combat and cultivation, but the process had filled Li Zhouwei with countless new insights, causing his Dao-Profundity to advance by leaps and bounds.

The two men locked eyes, wanting to say more, but the tremors in the Great Void grew increasingly violent, forcing them to look toward the disturbance. Li Ximing quickly pulled several medicinal pills he had recently acquired from his sleeve and pressed them into Li Zhouwei's hand.

"Go, quickly... We can talk about everything else when you return. Just be careful inside!"

Li Zhouwei didn't waste words. He gave a slight bow, his eyes shining.

"This junior will go on ahead!"

He then summoned his Heavenly Light and transformed into a streak of light, vanishing into the portal. Li Ximing let out a quiet sigh of relief, though his gaze remained wary as he scanned the surroundings.

"I don't know if Tianwan has activated the Hongxue Dao Lineage, but I can't let her just sneak away with it!"

Just then, a ripple passed through the Great Void, and the woman in pale cyan robes reappeared. Kuang Yu looked thoroughly indignant.

"That bastard Shilou is too arrogant!"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He asked:

"Daoist friend, are you not going inside to seek treasure?"

Kuang Yu's charming face clearly showed her temptation, but she gritted her teeth and shook her head.

"The Xinyu Archipelago can't spare me... and I can't afford to get injured. It's fine out here; I like to think I have some ability, and I can join in the excitement. But inside a grotto-heaven, it's too much trouble."

Li Ximing grew thoughtful. He was already wary of heading off alone, giving Tianwan a chance to try something. He remembered that this woman's relationship with Crimson Reef Island wasn't much better than his own. Secretly pleased, he smiled.

"In that case, would you be willing to accompany me, fellow Daoist? I can compensate you with medicinal pills."

"Oh?"

Kuang Yu raised an eyebrow. Her features were slightly different from the women of Jiangnan, possessing a distinct charm. Her dark eyes, illuminated by the ambient light, flashed with a hint of blue-violet. A smile touched her eyes.

"What's this? The great Alchemist has a use for little old me?"

"You flatter me!"

She clearly had a playful nature. Li Ximing shook his head, slightly embarrassed, and explained the situation with Tianwan, omitting any mention of the Hongxue Dao Lineage. The woman's eyes instantly lit up, and her enthusiasm seemed to surpass his own.

"Oh, yes, yes..."

Kuang Yu gave a cunning smile and replied:

"Her family's Dao Lineage is a fool's path, but she doesn't cultivate Merging Fire. She may be arrogant, but who knows what tricks she has up her sleeve? It's better to be careful... I'll back you up, fellow Daoist!"

(End of this chapter)




# Chapter 975: Crow Fire

The sky was clear and bright, casting the ranks of mountain peaks into shadow. A sea of mist drifted past, pierced by summits that seemed to connect heaven and earth. A golden sheen covered everything. Myriad streams of glazed, immortal light descended like golden mist, thousands raining down like trails of starlight, bathing the vast, glass-like platform in brilliant radiance.

Li Zhouwei stood bathed in the ethereal light, his long halberd resting lightly at his side. He tilted his head back, watching as the last streams of multicolored light faded into the distance, descending upon scattered locations. After countless silent ages, Wanling Heaven was finally stirring with activity.

"It's a carnival," he murmured.

As soon as he entered, Li Zhouwei felt the difference. Certain arrays and treasures in this grotto-heaven were clearly still active. Most notably, his connection to the Great Void was severed. Both his Shengyang Acupoint and his main body were sealed inside this domain.

This was similar to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, so he wasn't surprised. Like every other Purple Mansion Realm cultivator just arriving in Wanling Heaven, his first thought was of an exit strategy.

'No connection to the Great Void... that means I can't enter or leave at will. Getting in was easy, but getting out will be hard. There are probably only two ways: find the grotto-heaven's official exit, or... use a Great Void-walking technique.'

He raised his hand, preparing to test a divine ability, but his eyes narrowed.

Wisps of golden dharma power, like smoke or mist, were drifting from his palm, trying to fly towards the dome of the grotto-heaven. With a thought, Li Zhouwei's divine ability quickly wrangled them back.

He closed his eyes and sensed it carefully, a hypothesis forming instantly.

'There's a wondrous suppressing and absorbing effect in this grotto-heaven. It seems to be the after-effect of an array or treasure, vast and endless... It's constantly trying to drain the divine ability and dharma power from my body. If a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator came in here, they'd probably die from dharma power exhaustion within six hours.'

Fortunately, the suppression force wasn't too strong in this location. His dharma body was tough, and even before he had mastered his Body Divine Ability, this interference wouldn't have been enough to force him out, let alone now. It was just less convenient than the outside world, and his spiritual sense was restricted to within three zhang.

That was fine in his peak state, but if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was heavily injured and had to fight this constant draining effect, their dharma power and divine abilities would fail. What was terrifying was that in this grotto-heaven, the Shengyang Acupoint of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator resided within their dharma body. If the dharma body was destroyed, the Shengyang Acupoint couldn't even flee to the Great Void! It would be exposed to this suppression, and any escape technique would be useless.

'The opportunities here may be limitless, but it's also a death trap in disguise. Even if your enemy doesn't hunt you down... you could still perish from your injuries!'

'As for the limited spiritual sense... that's just a minor inconvenience.'

He glanced down and saw the ground dotted with the colors of divine abilities.

The grotto-heaven was vast. The various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had a tacit agreement. When landing, they would all release the glow of their divine abilities, shining brightly like lotuses blooming on the earth, signaling that the area was claimed. This prevented cultivators from accidentally running into each other due to their restricted spiritual sense.

After all, at this early stage, opportunities were everywhere. No one would intentionally land in the same spot and waste time competing.

Li Zhouwei hadn't chosen his spot randomly. As he entered, he had scanned the area with his golden eyes. A sweep of his Spirit Probe ability led him to a nearby mountain peak with the most powerful array-aura. It was glowing brilliantly, likely a grand palace from the path of Auspicious Qi.

But as the light washed over his face and he neared the ground, he didn't descend immediately. Instead, he put two fingers to his lips and blew, exhaling a dense cloud of Heavenly Light.

The Heavenly Light split into three parts and shot down from the sky. With a roar, it precisely struck three peaks surrounding the main palace, claiming them as a diversion for later exploration. Only then did he leisurely descend toward the palace itself.

_Tap._

He landed softly on the wide summit platform. Instantly, twelve lamp platforms lit up, blocking the glazed light from the sky. The palace before him was tall and magnificent, and a watery, rippling light washed over him.

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. He saw a stele on the platform, inscribed with dancing golden characters:

【Xinhu Palace】.

The palace had a powerful aura. The main platform was vast, supporting a bright, shining golden palace. Below the high platform, eight smaller palaces were built into the mountainside, all glittering.

As Li Zhouwei took a step forward, a pale white barrier of light immediately shimmered into existence. Strands of Auspicious Qi swirled within it, isolating the inside from the outside. He probed it with his spiritual sense and nodded to himself.

'As strong as I thought!'

This array was a product of Auspicious Qi, far surpassing his own Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. Li Zhouwei had never seen the Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array, so he couldn't compare them. But if he tried to break this array by himself, it would not only be loud, but it would take an eternity.

But Li Zhouwei had already assessed the situation before landing. This wasn't a problem. He simply formed a hand seal and activated his divine ability.

The palace's original master, existing within a grotto-heaven, had never intended this array to repel powerful enemies. Its main function was to aid in cultivation and provide isolation. The array's bases were the eight small palaces on the mountainside, which allowed it to cover a larger area and envelop the entire mountain in its wondrous effects to help disciples cultivate...

Golden light began to glow in his eyes. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light erupted from the point between his brows, forming a golden beam that shot across the mountain. With a _boom_, it shattered the array formation of the nearest small palace.

He didn't hesitate. He turned his head slightly, and the bright golden beam swept across the mountainside. The sound of shattering echoed as his figure flickered, moving like a streak of golden light, weaving through the peaks. In a mere moment, he reappeared in his original spot.

By now, all the small palaces on the mountain were in ruins, looted clean. A glow of Bright Yang light manifested in his hand, holding eight long incense sticks with golden bases and silver patterns.

'These eight small palaces seem to be sacrificial halls... Although each had different patterns and styles, they all stored one of these gold-patterned profound incense sticks.'

Li Zhouwei didn't know their purpose, but he could tell they were at the Purple Mansion Realm level. He casually stored them in a golden box and turned his attention back to the main array.

The array's light had dimmed significantly, its divine ability suppressed. However, it was still connected to a divine ability deep underground, retaining some of its power. He assessed it.

"When ancient cultivators built grotto-heavens, they often used a great divine ability to carve an array base at the bottom of the heaven, called a 'Profound Foundation'. These arrays on the mountain peaks can connect directly to Wanling Heaven's Profound Foundation to gain a power-up... That must be what this is."

"The foundation of this Wanling Heaven is truly deep. Even though the master had little intention of repelling enemies, and even with its array bases destroyed, the mere connection to the Profound Foundation still leaves it with Purple Mansion Realm-level power..."

He stepped forward and gave his arm a shake. He didn't use his dharma body, nor did he draw the Grand Ascension. Instead, he unhooked the Radiant Sun King's Halberd from his waist.

What Spiritual Artifact could be more suitable for this?

He gripped it tightly. The Splitting Light wondrous effect activated instantly. The grotto-heaven's power suppressed the light, confining it to a three-foot radius, but he smashed it against the white barrier with a _boom_. The array brightened for a moment, and a white scar appeared where he had struck.

Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up. 'It really is just borrowing power from the grotto-heaven's Profound Foundation! With the grotto-heaven in its current state, that power is like water without a source!'

Before the mark could fade, the next blow from the halberd landed on the exact same spot. Light exploded repeatedly. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd was incredibly cumbersome, but it was Li Zhouwei's most powerful Spiritual Artifact. A cultivator who had achieved the Body Divine Ability would still cough up blood if hit by it, let alone an immobile array taking dozens of hits?

The array's light flickered faster and faster, finally emitting a strained, cracking sound. Countless white fragments scattered and dissolved into flowing light on the ground.

"Good... to be this sturdy... it actually withstood dozens of strikes without any reinforcement!"

Li Zhouwei put away the Spiritual Artifact. The palace doors, however, wobbled unsteadily. Hit by the shockwave of the divine ability, they collapsed with a crash, revealing the scene inside.

Sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues lined the hall, eight to a side. They were astonishingly tall, their heads touching the roof beams and their feet planted on the floor. They held spears and banners, halberds and swords. Deeper inside stood sixteen massive pillars, each ten arm-spans around, painted with patterns of raging flames and murals of the Water Mansion's drowning depths.

Carved on the beams were Crimson-Eyed Ember-Pelt Crows. Around the pillars perched thousands of folded-wing sparrows. The plinths were carved as Plume-Throated Profound Turtles, and at the foot of the steps crouched Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beasts. All these Spirit Beasts had their heads bowed, not daring to look up. The central hall was perfectly round and exuded an air of supreme nobility.

'What incredible grandeur!' Li Zhouwei's eyes flashed. 'My Spirit Probe ability was right. This must be the most valuable place in the entire mountain range—perhaps even a ceremonial or sacrificial ground for a Dao Lineage! No wonder the array was so tough!'

Not only that, but under the observation of his Spirit Probe, he could see that divine ability was condensed within the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues. They were spiritually potent and secretly linked to the Profound Foundation deep within the grotto-heaven. If they awakened, their power would be extraordinary.

His golden eyes swept over the statues again and again, but a question rose in his heart. 'What Dao Lineage is this? Why does the divine ability and dharma power on these statues feel so unfamiliar? It's Ancient Merging, without a doubt, but a kind I've never seen before...'

Growing wary, he stepped forward into the hall. He tried to look at the main seat, but a large standing screen completely blocked the view.

The screen was painted with a Crimson-Eyed Ember-Pelt Crow. It had a small head, a short neck, and a long, hooked beak. Its back was hunched as if poised to strike, and its messy feathers seemed to roil and flow like flickering flames.

The crow's beak was raised high, its mouth open, aimed at the highest point of the screen. A single, bright white flame burned fiercely where its beak pointed.

'A Yuwu bird... or at least a descendant or related species.'

The small white flame was extremely active, constantly twitching. It seemed to be struggling, yet also dancing with joy. An intense, intimidating wave of heat washed over him, making his whole body feel scorching hot.

'Worthy of an Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition! How extravagant!'

A delighted smile spread across Li Zhouwei's face, and he chuckled to himself.

'Uncle-Grandfather is in luck! I've found a spirit fire for him already!'

The screen was actually enshrining a Purple Mansion Realm spirit fire!

He reached out, lifted the screen, and examined it closely. He quickly sensed something was wrong.

The screen had three panels. The first showed the Yuwu bird raising its head and crying out. The second, much lower, showed it with its beak closed, as if in congress. The final panel showed it with its head tucked under its wing, as if sleeping.

But each panel had a corresponding empty slot.

'There should have been three spirit fires...'

But as he pondered this, the Crimson-Eyed Ember-Pelt Crow on the screen suddenly turned its eyes and stared straight at him!

In that instant, the flames on the screen flared, and the white spirit fire poured down, filled with killing intent.

Li Zhouwei, far from being alarmed, laughed with amusement. "Insolent beast!"

His shout wasn't loud, but it cracked like thunder, instantly scattering the white spirit fire. But it also caused every statue in the great hall to come alive!

The thousands of sparrows took flight, the Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast whipped its head around, the Plume-Throated Profound Turtle roared, and the Crimson-Eyed Ember-Pelt Crows on the beams spat fire. All of them lunged at him. Li Zhouwei didn't even bother to draw the Grand Ascension. He just laughed.

"Scram!"

With one kick, he shattered the stone turtle. He reached up, tore a Crimson-Eyed Ember-Pelt Crow from the beam, twisted its wings, and threw it aside.

"You're just carvings that absorbed some spiritual energy," he scoffed. "You've been nurtured by spiritual qi for a thousand years and gained a sliver of a spirit fire's authority, but you don't even have the sense to see who you're dealing with!"

At this, the Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast squatting at the steps froze, turning back into a statue. Li Zhouwei couldn't be bothered with it. He plucked the Purple Mansion Realm spirit fire from the screen. A quick scan with his spiritual sense told him what it was.

It was, of course, Merging Fire. But it was different from common Merging Fire; this flame carried an aura of radiance. Li Zhouwei had obtained Supreme Yang spiritual items before and was very familiar with this aura. It was the power of the Supreme Yang Dao. Joy flooded his heart.

'It must be a Merging Fire related to the Supreme Yang! Any spiritual item, let alone a spirit fire, increases in value immensely just by being associated with the Supreme Yang!'

The spirit fire was searing hot in his hand and tried to escape. Li Zhouwei couldn't refine it instantly, but he suppressed it with his rolling Bright Yang divine ability, crushing it into a tiny, immobile speck of radiance in his palm.

With its power source gone, the screen crashed to the floor in a heap of gold and stone, revealing what lay behind it.

Glazed light filled the air. In the center of the hall sat a square, green-bronze cauldron.

The cauldron had a stark, angular design. It wasn't large, but the profound patterns covering it were extremely complex, mostly depicting flying birds. Its belly was engraved with the pattern of a Profound Giant Turtle over a carving of a lake.

The square lid of the cauldron was trembling slightly, as if it were sitting on boiling water, rattling at the edges. Blinding white light pulsed from it, and faint arcs of lightning could be seen leaping from the seams before being yanked back by a wondrous effect. A stinging aura filled the air.

With just one look, Li Zhouwei understood.

'An item of Profound Thunder from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition!'

He didn't rush forward. His gaze slowly moved down to the swirling array patterns the cauldron was suppressing. He grew cautious.

'I walked deep into this hall, and the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues did nothing. It seems they were meant for this. The moment this cauldron is moved, the statues guarding Xinhu Palace will, in all likelihood, activate...'

Li Zhouwei [Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm]




# Chapter 976: The Azure Cauldron

Li Zhouwei took stock of the situation, his brow furrowing as he discreetly activated his Spirit Probe ability.

The reason was simple. With every passing moment, more streaks of light flashed across the sky. It was clear that the formations others had chosen were not as robust as this one. They had likely already secured their treasures and moved on to the second or even third mountain peak.

On one of the three peaks he had previously claimed with his Heavenly Light, an intruder had already appeared. The man, dressed in white robes and wreathed in lightning, was clearly a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Thunder-Hearing Island, and he seemed to be searching for something specific.

Further in the distance, another white light shot through the air like a meteor, closing to within a few miles. Its trajectory was unmistakable—it was headed directly for Xinhu Palace, the very building he stood upon.

'I can't delay any longer!' he thought. 'I might be able to detect them early, but those other families could have their own secrets. They might know exactly which places in this grotto-heaven hold the greatest treasures... which is why they're heading straight for this spot!'

His mind made up, Li Zhouwei looked up. A ray of golden light shot from between his brows, soaring into the air. It flew above the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues, transforming into a cascade of ever-shifting Heavenly Light, ready to suppress them. Only then did he step forward and place his hands on the rim of the great azure cauldron.

"Hnngh..."

The instant he touched it, his eyebrows shot up in surprise. He narrowed his eyes. Dark clouds immediately gathered above Xinhu Palace, crackling with intense purple-white lightning. At the same time, his Spirit Probe revealed that the auras within the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues had instantly surged to a new level. He could feel a palpable sense of danger!

'This is bad! I'm about to be trapped between them!'

The strange phenomenon alone was enough to put him on high alert. He retracted his divine ability, his body instantly dissolving into boundless Heavenly Light, plunging the great hall into shadow. Barely a breath later, drawn by the commotion, someone rushed into the hall.

The newcomer wore white robes, his eyes slightly narrow. A purple gourd hung from his waist, and he was wreathed in purple lightning so dark it was almost black, coiling around him like dragons and tigers. His face was stern and righteous, projecting an imposing aura. It was none other than Miao Huanzun, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Thunder-Hearing Island.

He zipped into the hall as a streak of purple lightning, his movements frantic. His gaze darted around, full of suspicion. When he saw the azure cauldron, his eyes lit up, but then he noted the disarray in the hall and his heart clenched.

'Something is definitely wrong. The formation here has clearly been broken, but there's no one in sight!'

'To leave a spiritual treasure like this untouched... they must be after something bigger. Or perhaps... they're lurking nearby, waiting for the right moment?'

He scoffed inwardly, feeling little fear. The celestial phenomenon was obvious; every cultivator in the area must have seen it. As a cultivator of the Thunder Dao, he could not pass up an opportunity like this. There was no room for hesitation. Though his mind raced, his hands were already on the cauldron, surging with both divine ability and dharma power.

The azure cauldron didn't budge.

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's combined divine ability and dharma power could move a mountain with ease. But this cauldron was far heavier than any mountain. Whatever it contained, it possessed a weight that his divine ability alone couldn't lift. Miao Huanzun had not cultivated a Body Divine Ability, and his initial attempt had been careless. He focused, concentrating intense purple light in his palms, and tried again. This time, he finally lifted it.

"Clang!"

He hoisted the cauldron from the floor. Dense lightning flared, turning into a pillar of purple-black light that shot toward the sky. But before Miao Huanzun could even feel a moment of triumph, a white light flashed above. A chariot pulled by a horned beast tore through the air, and a man appeared.

The man was dressed in silver-white robes, with a high crown and a wide sash. His feathered attire was magnificent, and clouds billowed beneath his feet, giving him the air of a true immortal. He gripped a halberd in his hand and swept in with a loud laugh, his voice cold.

"A little greedy, aren't we, Daoist friend!"

The lightning-wielding man cursed inwardly, his heart sinking.

'Touba Ci?!'

The Touba family's prestige was immense. In the past century, they had finally begun to emerge from the shadow of the Great Liang's fall. Geniuses had been born to their line one after another, each possessing profound dharma power and mastery of Daoist arts. The Miao Family had its own heritage, true, and had even produced a genius ancestor. They couldn't afford to offend powerful Daoist traditions, let alone a scion of the Touba family with his formidable backing!

On any other day, he would have yielded. But he absolutely could not let go of the treasure in his hands. Furthermore, his cultivation had advanced significantly in recent years, thanks to a cultivation method and divine ability a junior member of his family had obtained from the Green Pine Temple. A flicker of defiance sparked within him. His expression darkened, and he opened his mouth to spit out a bolt of visceral, purple-black lightning.

"BOOM!"

But the great halberd smashed down, unleashing a ripple of Profound Yellow Qi that shattered the lightning bolt. The Touba scion reached for the azure cauldron, his smile still in place but his eyes ice-cold with warning. Miao Huanzun's face, however, lit up with a brilliant glow as he activated a divine ability.

"Supreme Yang Exhalation!"

A roiling storm of Profound Thunder instantly erupted around his body. Touba Ci was momentarily blocked. He was just about to draw a Spiritual Artifact when he froze, his expression changing dramatically.

The sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues on the mountain had all opened their eyes. With stiff, grinding movements, they turned their heads to glare at the intruders.

The Touba scion's face drained of color.

'Sixteen Profound Divine Officials! They're still active!'

He instantly retracted his hand in apprehension. But Miao Huanzun looked no happier; a profound chill crept up his spine. His Life Divine Ability was screaming a warning, making the hairs on his neck stand on end.

The Daoist Master barely had time to turn his head before his pupils dilated in horror.

The sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues were charging.

And what magnificent statues they were! Five of them, appearing as Martial Monarchs, strode upon shimmering profound mists. Another five, clad in the armor of immortal generals, rode atop seven-colored auspicious clouds. These ten held golden weapons and had swelled to the size of mountains. The remaining six resembled civil officials of normal human stature, holding immortal banners or precious talismans.

The eyes of these imposing statues were all solid gold. They channeled dharma power, their cold, emotionless pupils scanning in all directions before fixing squarely on him.

'What are these things!'

His spiritual sense was suppressed, but his Life Divine Ability clearly identified the statues as the source of the danger. The purple gourd at his waist flew into the air, unleashing a torrent of lightning. In an instant, a purple-black deluge submerged the ten mountain-sized statues.

"RUMBLE!"

But the statues simply glowed, neutralizing the lightning as it struck them. They walked straight through the thunderous waterfall, their massive shadows enveloping Miao Huanzun in an instant.

Though chilled to the bone, the Daoist Master's reactions were swift. His pre-activated lightning escape art flared with purple light. Harnessing the supreme speed of lightning, he teleported laterally, narrowly dodging the enveloping radiance, but the shockwave alone nearly made him cough up blood.

'What?'

'In this day and age, with souls being so obscure, arts like shamanic spirit statues and external dharma bodies are a joke. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could spend ages refining one and end up with a puppet at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Both Li Que'wan and Li Chenghuai have things like that—they're completely useless. As for a Purple Mansion-level spirit puppet... no one has seen such a thing since Duanmu Kui's time. It's pure fantasy!'

But seeing this, how could Miao Huanzun not be utterly terrified? He knew these sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues would be strong, but he had never imagined _this_. His brief clash of divine abilities revealed that the statues' physical bodies were comparable to a Bodhisattva seat, and that was _before_ considering the Treasured Artifacts and spirit embryos they held, all of which were empowered by the grotto-heaven's Profound Foundation.

Sixteen of them... their combined power likely rivaled a true Lotus Seat. If they formed a formation... even someone like Wei Xuanyin would have to turn and flee!

Miao Huanzun barely had time to remount his purple lightning when six beams of [Profound-Guarding Spirit Official's Dharma Light] shot out, locking onto him. He cursed inwardly, but a hazy spiritual mirror dropped from above, struggling to deflect the beams. The Touba scion, his expression grim, barked an order.

"Miao! Hand over the cauldron! We get it out of here, _then_ we split it!"

Miao Huanzun's face was grim. Why would he agree to that?

'Who knows if these statues are chasing me because _I_ touched the cauldron, or if they'll chase whoever _holds_ it. If it's the former, I'd just be doing all the dirty work for Touba Ci!'

He stubbornly refused to let go. Touba Ci was forced to change tactics. He used a divine ability of Profound Yellow Qi to block the advancing statues while thrusting his halberd forward, striking the cauldron hard.

The cauldron was already in a fragile state, barely suppressing its contents. How could it withstand such a heavy blow? The vibrating azure lid was thrown open, and a pillar of pure, purple-white light erupted, shooting straight into the sky like a column connecting heaven and earth.

"BOOM!"

The divine ability and dharma power Miao Huanzun was using to hold the cauldron instantly vanished. The azure cauldron shot skyward, and the brilliant purple-white light enveloped the entire area, as if all other colors in the world had been consumed by it. The [Sixteen Profound Divine Officials] froze in unison, their heads tilting upward.

The first thing to fly from the cauldron was a massive, purple-gold mace of Profound Thunder. It radiated bolts of lightning like a thousand falling stars. Three small, brilliant lightning swords followed closely behind it, shimmering with multicolored light. Every eye was instantly drawn to them.

Close behind them came eight wisps of lightning, each with a unique form and aura. All were terrifyingly powerful and brimming with spiritual energy. They immediately scattered, fleeing in all directions, making Miao Huanzun's eyes turn red with greed.

'Spiritual Artifacts! Purple Mansion Spirit Lightning!'

Spiritual sense was restricted in Wanling Heaven, but a spectacular light show like this was visible to all. The surrounding cultivators, who had been mere flickers of multicolored light in the distance, all stopped to watch. A commotion erupted. Spiritual Artifacts were rare sights, and now several were floating right before them. Who could possibly resist? Lights surged from all directions as divine abilities began to clash.

The Sixteen Profound Divine Officials seemed confused for a moment, but then, showing surprising intelligence, they split up. Each rode a beam of light, scattering in all directions to pursue the escaping artifacts. This, however, was exactly what the cultivators wanted. With the statues no longer acting in concert, their threat was drastically reduced.

Amidst the purple chaos, Touba Ci's gaze remained casual. The crescent blade on his halberd flicked out, hooking toward the great azure cauldron, which had just settled down and was now emanating a soft, green glow.

'I'll take this first, _then_ I'll deal with the others in the sky!'

"Vmm!"

The azure cauldron released a brilliant flash of light. Touba Ci's expression changed, his eyes narrowing slowly.

On the other side of the cauldron, a man had appeared, taking the opportunity to seize the Spiritual Artifact. His arm held the cauldron steady, and his piercing golden eyes met Touba Ci's across the distance.

Touba Ci's expression darkened, but he wasn't surprised. Both he and Miao Huanzun knew there was someone else hiding in the hall. He just hadn't expected the person to ignore the treasures in the sky to fight him for the cauldron. He spoke coolly.

"So, it was you."

His face remained impassive, but dense Profound Yellow dharma power surged down his arm and into the halberd. His divine ability and dharma power flared to their peak as he tried to yank the Spiritual Artifact back toward him.

Li Zhouwei exhaled sharply. Dense, scale-like golden patterns erupted on his palm and climbed up his arm. Even the corners of his golden eyes shimmered with light. The azure cauldron held firm, not moving an inch.

Touba Ci's expression turned ugly. "A Body Divine Ability?" he said, his voice cold. "Fast..."

The swirling cloud of Profound Yellow Qi behind him expanded violently. A great seal emerged from it, radiating multicolored light as it swelled in size, preparing to suppress Li Zhouwei. Four large characters were visible on its face:

[Shengle Touba]!

But Li Zhouwei was more than prepared. The Heavenly Light in the sky had already coalesced into a vast, white celestial gate. Blinding light shone down as auspicious clouds filled the air, adorned with fluttering banners. Tens of thousands of golden-armored soldiers stood upon those clouds, weapons at the ready, a sight so grand it drew the attention of everyone in the vicinity.

"RUMBLE!"

The next instant, a cataclysmic boom echoed. The descending 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' slammed into the seal as if striking adamantine. The gate faltered, straining against a massive force that threatened to overturn it. It teetered precariously, but it held, pinning the Touba seal in place.

Both Touba Ci and Li Zhouwei were inwardly shocked. Touba Ci couldn't believe his family's famous seal, renowned for its resistance to suppression, had been pinned. Li Zhouwei, on the other hand, was stunned that his Audience with the Celestial Gate was struggling so much.

Shock aside, Li Zhouwei's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' was at its limit, but it _was_ suppressing the seal. Taking advantage of his planned attack, Li Zhouwei unleashed his Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light from between his brows. But Touba Ci was ready and quickly summoned a mirror to block it.

"CLANG!"

The two lights clashed in mid-air. Touba Ci's expression began to sour. He poured all of his Profound Yellow divine ability into his halberd, but the force coming from the azure cauldron was only increasing. A halberd wasn't a whip; he couldn't maintain his grip.

They were deadlocked for a moment. Touba Ci weighed his options. The cauldron wasn't his primary goal, and this man was relentless. If he delayed any longer, he'd miss his chance at the mace in the sky. He made a snap decision, flipping his halberd and soaring into the air to join the fight for the Spirit Lightning. He shot back a cold parting word.

"This isn't over!"

Li Zhouwei's expression was just as grim. Touba Ci was strong, and that stalemate had cost him precious time. Three Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues were already closing in, intent on retrieving the azure cauldron.

Still, the worst of it was over. At least he wasn't like Miao Huanzun, empty-handed and chasing desperately through the sky. He spun, swinging his halberd around to defend. The weapon instantly expanded to a massive size, blocking the sky-blotting sword and golden staff of the enormous statues.

"CLANG!"

The sword and staff struck the halberd's shaft simultaneously, erupting in a blast of golden-yellow Heavenly Light. Li Zhouwei tested the weight and sighed inwardly.

'Truly ingenious craftsmanship!'

A third statue summoned a silver-white profound bell. It flew high, casting down a gentle light that sought to imprison him. Li Zhouwei, all the while scanning the chaotic battlefield for a chance to grab the Spirit Lightning, fixed his gaze on that bell.

'It's a spirit embryo... what a brilliant technique. They must have been equipped with corresponding spirit embryos in advance, allowing the statues to draw nourishment from the grotto-heaven's Profound Foundation!'

His golden eyes scanned the area. With a sharp _clang_, he parried the two large statues and inverted his halberd, which shrank back to its normal size. His gaze remained fixed on the silver-white bell, sensing the concentrated metal-qi within it as a plan formed in his mind.

'These statues are in three groups. Two groups can grow to the size of mountains—they must be from some unknown Ancient Merging Daoist tradition. The last group, the six human-sized ones, seem to be spirit officials, and each is different... This one, with its aura that's like metal but not quite... it's just like the Vault Metal my uncle described!'

'The quality of these things is high. Even if they can't be preserved long-term, I have to deal with them anyway. I might as well capture this one. Before it dissipates, I can give it to Senior Liu, who cultivates Vault Metal! The same logic applies to the others... If I find suitable ones, I can capture them and trade them.'

After all, just having these three statues chasing him was a waste. A fiery realization struck him.

'Forget everything else. Of these sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues... these six normal-sized ones are the real treasures!'




# Chapter 977: Upper Rite

CLANG!

The long halberd swept left and right, parrying two stabbing spiritual armaments. The immense recoil forced the two Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues back a step, but a golden shadow vaulted from the halberd, smashing heavily onto the house-sized head of one Spirit Statue and unleashing a tempest of force.

A Heavenly Light seized the opportunity to pierce through the tempest, aiming straight for the Spirit Official protected by the two statues. This official possessed a keen awareness and immediately retreated, but it hadn't accounted for the attacking Daoist Master, who had already summoned Hidden Light, smashing it heavily into the official's body.

White smoke billowed instantly. The two Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues immediately reversed their weapons, stabbing at the man behind them. But Li Zhouwei did not lower his Celestial Pass. His body was already wreathed in black flames.

[Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts]!

Black flames surged behind him, extending four arms that suddenly snatched the two beam-sized weapons from the air. Though his form was like an ant trying to shake a tree, he didn't budge an inch. Instead, the two Spirit Statues staggered, kicking up a cloud of dust.

His divine ability condensed. His two hands formed a seal in front of him, and only then did he summon the divine ability,

'Audience with the Celestial Gate!'

The massive Celestial Gate immediately fell from the sky, carrying surging purple flames. It didn't target the Spirit Statues behind him, nor the Spirit Official trapped by Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light in front. Instead, light and flame intertwined, moving to suppress the silver-white profound bell in the sky!

He had no need to entangle himself with the three Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues. 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' excelled at suppression. The Statues were mindless. His plan was simple, grab the prize and leave. The power of Spirit Probe unfurled, and the location of every spiritual thunder in the sky instantly imprinted itself upon his mind.

BOOM!

This profound bell was certainly a treasure, and its connection to the Spirit Official was deep. But how could it withstand the full suppressive force of 'Audience with the Celestial Gate'? In an instant, its dharma light dissipated, and it reverted to its original form, a silver bell, only the size of a fist.

Li Zhouwei's hands didn't slow in the slightest. Those golden eyes lit up. Scale-like patterns reappeared on his face. The hands forming the seal immediately released, and he suddenly turned, pressing one hand in front and one behind onto the two massive weapons!

He gritted his teeth. Golden light climbed the weapons from his hands like lightning, then quickly spread to the two Spirit Statues. The bodies of the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues were tough, but how could Li Zhouwei's own dharma body be any weaker?

“Up!”

Instantly, terrifying dust clouds billowed. The two mountain-sized Spirit Statues were ripped from the ground. For a moment, they were as weightless as dolls on a catapult, shattering the air with sonic booms. They spun rapidly, a full two circles, before he flung them. Like comets radiating heat, they soared into the sky.

Their target was the exact location of the thunder-wreathed, purple-gold profound mace. The man who had just snatched it, Miao Huanzun!

Li Zhouwei was wreathed in flashing flames and qi waves. His divine ability had already retrieved the silver bell. He wasted no time on the Spirit Official. With the spirit embryo in hand, his body transformed into golden light and streaked across the sky!

---

The thunder in the sky raged. The three Purple Mansion Realm cultivators surrounding the purple-gold mace and Miao Huanzun felt a sudden chill up their spines. They looked up almost simultaneously. But the terrifying sonic boom arrived an instant later, momentarily stunning them,

BOOM!

The two mountain-sized Spirit Statues had smashed down!

The statues were already heavy and sturdy. The thunder in the sky was instantly shattered, scattering light. Miao Huanzun, bearing the brunt of the attack, felt his pupils shrink. He forcefully shifted half a body's width. His thunder dharma power was shattered and scattered, erupting into rolling thunder plasma before re-gathering. He had barely steadied himself, stunned, when a golden light plunged from the sky even faster.

The rapidly enlarging golden body and the face covered in golden scale patterns reflected in his pupils. Miao Huanzun only had time to retreat, roaring with his divine ability,

“It’s the White Qilin!”

On the other side, the black-robed man reacted fastest. He raised a hand, facing the assaulting Heavenly Light, and exhaled a blast of black-water wind, blowing straight at the pouncing man. His expression was grim as he shouted,

“How is there another one!”

This black-water wind rolled forth, like a gale from a sea cliff, carrying a damp, sticky, yin aura. It blew at the golden light, transforming into wisps of ensnaring, disorienting light, attempting to push him away.

But Li Zhouwei's eyes snapped open. Dense Heavenly Light instantly turned his eyes pure gold,

'Sovereign's Perilous Tread!'

'Seize the moment, return to the path!'

The rolling black wind seemed to become an anchor for his movement. Instead of being pushed back, his speed accelerated by a third. He shattered the black water. The long halberd instantly magnified, exploding with a deafening boom against the black-robed man's frantically raised hands!

“Zzzzt...”

The man instantly became an arrow loosed from its bow, hurtling clang into the sea of clouds below. Rolling multicolored light and Heavenly Light wove over his body. Li Zhouwei didn't waste another divine ability. He snapped his head around, his dark golden eyes—revealed after the pure gold faded—fixed on Miao Huanzun.

Miao Huanzun felt both aggrieved and furious. A fiery thought shot into his mind,

‘Damn beast! Am I the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert or are you... You really think no one can deal with you!’

In the Grotto-Heaven, the strongest were the Great Daoist Masters. Below them, naturally, were the three-divine ability, mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Miao Huanzun knew he was a step below figures like Touba Ci, but excluding a few major powers, he, Miao Huanzun, was still a highly ranked expert!

'Let me teach you to respect your seniors!'

In the span of that single thought, the White Qilin's halberd was already stabbing toward him, carrying three bright, dancing streams of white light. Multicolored light spilled everywhere. Miao Huanzun sneered internally, flicking his sleeve and summoning a small purple fork.

The fork was about an arm's length, a mix of purple and white, but it was infused with purple-black thunder, making it stand out. With a clang, the fork blocked the halberd. Miao Huanzun immediately summoned a purple gourd, but unexpectedly felt a chill on the back of his neck. The people who had besieged him earlier were attacking again.

He was forced to use a divine ability to block. His eyes transformed into thunder light, seeing through the incoming azure divine ability. He was just that one step late. Another golden light leaped from the halberd, stabbing at his face.

Grand Ascension's [Attachment]!

This marvel had achieved many merits, and this time was no exception. Miao Huanzun was momentarily stunned. He had to interrupt his action, spitting out a mouthful of thunder to cope. But Li Zhouwei suddenly exerted his strength, his divine ability condensing as he spun the halberd again.

“Bang!”

The purple thunder on both sides instantly exploded. Grand Ascension pressed forward another fraction against the thunder fork, almost stabbing into Miao Huanzun's eyes. The brilliant Heavenly Light shone on his face, dissipating his defensive divine ability and causing him to break out in a cold sweat.

“You!”

Li Zhouwei's surprise attack had brought him right in front, giving Miao Huanzun no time to react. The radiance from between his brows burst forth, smashing bang into the divine ability protecting the other's face!

“BOOM!”

Miao Huanzun reacted extremely fast. He knew Li Zhouwei possessed a Dharma Art that originated from between the brows. Dense purple lightning had already covered his face. But Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, enhanced by 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread', had reached a new level. It instantly snapped his head back. He was dizzy, coughing up black blood. He extended two fingers, his eyes cold with anger, also activating a divine ability!

But right at that moment, a sharp, cold edge was born from the shadows, stabbing straight at Miao Huanzun's brow! Li Zhouwei didn't look back. He already knew who it was,

Chen Yin!

One of the three who had surrounded Miao Huanzun! And one of the reasons Li Zhouwei believed he had a chance to snatch the prize!

Spiritual sense was limited. Others might not know who was snatching what, just grabbing whatever was closest. But Li Zhouwei saw the situation most clearly, even able to measure his own chances of success at each location. That was why he hadn't acted immediately, but had waited patiently for an opportunity!

Now the situation was clear. The Grotto-Heaven was too vast. Even with all the thunder making a huge scene, the most advantageous competitors in the short term were still Miao Huanzun and Touba Ci. Touba Ci was clearly more interested in the set of three short swords... As long as Chen Yin was willing to side with him, or even just show a little bias, dealing with Miao Huanzun would be no problem at all!

Miao Huanzun was cold and furious. Even if Chen Yin hadn't made a big name for himself, he had spent a fortune in recent years forging a Spiritual Sword. Paired with his Sword Origin, even he couldn't ignore it. Finally, purple light shot from his eyes, and he roared,

“Insolent!”

A purple-black light pierced heaven and earth. Silver-white Profound Thunder fell from the vast dark clouds. But the moment it landed on him, it instantly transformed, becoming purple-black thunder that spun around him, emitting a deep, heavy roar,

“ROAR!”

'Edict of Pacification!'

A powerful purple-black light pulsed outward. The Spiritual Sword trembled in the thunder. Chen Yin was instantly thrown back several zhang, streaks of thunder invading his body and causing him great pain. Simultaneously, another invisible figure was forced out of the air, stumbling back several steps, his face grim. His Thousand-Eye Demon Robe shimmered. It was the Southern Borderlands' Daoist Master Luo.

“Clang!”

The purple-black light pushed forward. Li Zhouwei slammed his halberd down in the air. Heavenly Light and multicolored clouds gathered. 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' activated. The Talisman Qi in his body resonated and neutralized the attack, sweeping all the thunder from his body. He only retreated three steps!

Li Zhouwei was suddenly surprised.

'It can activate Talisman Qi?'

The Bright Yang Dao inherently possessed the marvel of breaking demonic arts. But the Miao Family's thunder was special. Although it used a unique method to stain it with blood qi, it wasn't classified among the arts that could be broken by such methods. Thus, they had always been able to roam the world, calling themselves orthodox. But while 'Bright Yang' didn't recognize the "evil" thunder, his [Illuminating Sun and Moon]'s demon-breaking, evil-dispelling function did react!

Such a perfect opportunity! He had no time for further thought. The scale patterns on his face grew brighter, the radiance between his brows blazing infinitely. Taking advantage of the moment his opponent thought he was suppressed by the thunder and his dharma power was failing, his divine ability rolled and activated,

[Emperor Qi's Light].

A round hole appeared between his brows. Inside, it was dim, without a trace of radiance. But its edge was extremely bright, like a solar eclipse, and it was aimed directly at Miao Huanzun!

Miao Huanzun excelled in thunder dharma power, using spell arts to defeat his enemies. His divine ability, 'Edict of Pacification', was a clearing ability. The closer the distance, the greater its power. It was perfect for when he was forced into close quarters by an expert in Body Divine Abilities. He had been waiting for this exact moment, when everyone was near him, to activate it and make his escape.

Now that he had shocked them all, he immediately prepared to ride the thunder away. He even had time to raise his purple gourd, preparing to leave a cluster of lightning for them. He never expected that just as his dharma power began to circulate, his Life Divine Ability would send another urgent warning of danger.

“Hm?”

He saw the solar eclipse at the man's brow suddenly contract. Infinite light swarmed out from it—countless streaks, thin and sharp, curved and winding, gold at the front and black at the back, dragging long, thin tails. Like vipers, they surged forward, one after another, shooting toward him at a terrifying speed.

“What Dharma Art is this!”

His calculation had been good, but who could have predicted his divine ability would be so easily neutralized? Fortune and misfortune were truly two sides of the same coin. This slight pause had plunged him into endless trouble. They were too close; he couldn't even shift sideways. He could only raise his sleeve, forcibly interrupt the divine ability in his hand, wrap his body in a streak of lightning, and snarl,

“Such guts!”

The words never even left his mouth. The dense Emperor Qi's Light was already dancing, pouring over him like rain. The small, thumb-thick, gold-and-black streams of light were unbelievably fast and sharp. Thunder arts were not known for defense, especially at this range!

His body shook violently. Even with his own divine ability active, it was like being trapped in a ceaseless fire-hell. Puffs of purple blood mist sprayed from his front and back as the streaks of light embedded themselves in his flesh and thunder. More streaks of this Qi Light climbed onto the purple-gold profound mace, forcibly suppressing his thunder light and locking it down!

But what terrified him even more was that Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up again. The solar eclipse between his brows suddenly reversed, light born from the darkness.

[Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light]!

Miao Huanzun's one misstep filled his heart with an infinite chill. He immediately understood his choice, either abandon the Spiritual Artifact in his hand and flee, or take this beam of light head-on and plunge himself into a disastrous, perhaps critically injurious, situation! In such an intense competition, suffering a heavy injury meant he would have no more major gains in this Grotto-Heaven!

No matter how reluctant he was to part with the thunder artifact, Miao Huanzun was ultimately a decisive man. He let go. His body dissolved into rolling thunder plasma and scattered into the distance. He didn't even leave a threatening word; he just silently and wretchedly dispersed.

Only the small, snake-like, gold-and-black Emperor Qi's Light remained, locking the purple-gold profound mace as it fell into the White Qilin's hand.

Li Zhouwei held his halberd in one hand. The black flames behind him stretched out an arm to catch the mace. He stood in the clouds like a fierce god. His two black-flame arms held a green cauldron and the thunder mace. His gaze was sharp, without a hint of relaxation. He tilted his head slightly, as if listening for something.

“Petty tricks!”

He sneered and suddenly raised his hand, fast as lightning, grabbing something from the empty air. A piercing sound erupted. Rolling black qi rose from his hand, mingling with boiling golden qi. It was a speeding divine ability-dart!

The dart still struggled in his grasp. His gaze, however, wasn't on his hand, but fixed straight ahead on the pale-faced, black-robed man.

This was the same Purple Mansion Realm cultivator he had just knocked from the clouds. The man had unfortunately been intercepted by the falling Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues, delaying him for over a dozen exchanges. He had anxiously used a divine ability to suppress them and hurried back, but he was one step too late. Now, he could only look at Li Zhouwei with a wary gaze.

Li Zhouwei didn't ride the wind and retreat like Miao Huanzun. Miao Huanzun cultivated thunder; his escape art could definitely get him away from three people. But his 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' wasn't good for fleeing, and he didn't want to cause a huge commotion. So, his eyes remained fierce, quietly watching his opponent. The hand pinching the divine ability-dart squeezed slightly.

“Peng!”

A burst of golden fire, a spray of black water—he had crushed the divine ability dart with his bare hand.

As his golden eyes swept around, the old man holding the sword bowed slightly and vanished. The demonic cultivator in the Thousand-Eye Demon Robe gave an awkward laugh and silently put away his dagger. The black-robed man sighed heavily and also retreated.

At this moment, the world was gradually quieting down. Only the rumble of the Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues giving chase remained. Through the heavy clouds, at the other end of the area, Touba Ci also secured the three thunder short swords. He gave Li Zhouwei a deep look, summoned his carriage, and the rumble of wheels quickly faded into the distance.

As the cultivators who had obtained spiritual thunder quickly retreated, the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues were rapidly closing in. Li Zhouwei saw that Touba Ci had finished and there was no further opportunity to be had, so he didn't stay a moment longer. He instantly transformed into Heavenly Light and sped away.

'The harvest isn't bad! Miao Huanzun just condensed his third divine ability, and two others didn't want to see him succeed…'

The golden light on his face slowly faded. The solar eclipse between his brows also dimmed and vanished. He used his Spirit Probe ability, having long since locked onto an unexplored direction. Only then did he pretend to look around, riding his light casually. He raised his hand, revealing the purple-gold mace.

This mace was purple-gold, 4 chi 2 cun long. The handle was relatively short, and the body was four-sided. Dense patterns covered it, all depicting the subjugation of Demons and the pacification of the world. It felt numbing to the touch, its silver-white light restrained. A fine weapon indeed!

The weapon was sealed in the cauldron. It still had an owner, so it couldn't be refined quickly, nor could it be stored. He just tied it with Heavenly Light and fastened it to his waist. He flipped his hand again, revealing a touch of green light.

In the fight just now, he had obtained the two most important treasures. This item was the green square cauldron that held the treasures of Xinhu Palace—and it carried no imprint of a previous owner's divine ability or dharma power!

As his Bright Yang divine ability continuously poured in, the green cauldron began to glow. Golden light gathered within its square mouth. First, the profound-patterned flying bird patterns lit up, followed by the turtle patterns on its belly. The lake patterns also shone brightly.

By the time Li Zhouwei's escaping light stopped, pausing before a mountain peak, this Spiritual Artifact was finally refined by him. It vibrated, and all its light suddenly retracted, leaving only a thick green glow,

[Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron]!

This was a container used in Wanling Heaven to hold spiritual items, but it was also a ritual vessel for sacrifices. The Wanling Upper Sect was wealthy; this item was actually superior to Changxi's [Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger].

“It's a Spiritual Artifact of the Gathering Wood Dao. This is the first time I've gotten a Gathering Wood Spiritual Artifact... though it's not like I have many Spiritual Artifacts anyway…”

Its main marvel was called [Renew]. It could take damaged spiritual plants, pills, and spiritual resources of the same Dao lineage and be placed inside, allowing them to regain their vitality and restore their quality.

If large amounts of non-conflicting Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources of the same Dao lineage were put inside, this item would gather divine ability and transform them into a spiritual extract.

And this cauldron's [Renew] had another extremely important benefit. If what was put inside wasn't water-virtue spiritual resources but a water-virtue spiritual item of high enough quality, presided over by the Gathering Wood divine ability, it could even transform it into Purple Mansion Realm spiritual water! As for fire-virtue... most of those conflicted with Gathering Wood, so that wouldn't work.

'This is probably this cauldron's most important function…'

Li Zhouwei thought to himself,

'Good thing spiritual sense is limited in the Grotto-Heaven. Daoist Master Luo who rushed over only saw the spiritual thunder. Otherwise, he would have definitely tried to snatch this! It's very useful for me too. At worst, I'll just have to ask him when I need to use this marvel.'

It was, after all, an item from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. It actually had two other marvels. One was called [Primal Prosperity], which could add a tiny, almost negligible, bit of good luck to the owner. He had no idea how useful it would be. It seemed to be a technique of Auspicious Qi.

The second was called [Auxiliary Rite]. This one could finally be used in a fight. It could continuously absorb thunder, water, metal, and light to suppress an enemy's marvels. Once full, it could spit out a white light to protect the owner. Although the white light's power wasn't great, the absorption ability was very useful.

'Next time I run into Miao Huanzun, I'll just use this to absorb his thunder-fall.'

He flicked a finger. The Spiritual Artifact shrank to a finger-sized small cauldron. Divine ability and dharma power condensed into a cord, tying itself to his waist. Li Zhouwei drew the [Radiant Sun King's Halberd], raised an eyebrow, and looked. Before him was a picturesque, idyllic mountain scene, beautiful and serene. Below it stood a stele,

[Clear Rite Peak].

The formation here was much worse than at Xinhu Palace. Its connection to the Grotto-Heaven's Profound Foundation was weaker. But the formation's aura was novel. Although he couldn't tell what Dao lineage it was, he could vaguely guess it was one of the Twelve Qis. Li Zhouwei gave it a second look,

“Another family… After entering this Wanling Heaven, there are so many Dao lineages I don't recognize!”

Li Zhouwei unleashed three strikes of [Splitting Light] with his halberd, and the great formation shattered. Above was a large plaque, with four words in cloud-like white script,

[Upper Rite Celestial Empyrean].

On both sides stood a large white jade treasure vase, its patterns faint, gushing Spiritual Qi. A pity they weren't Purple Mansion Realm level. They would just take up space in his storage bag. Li Zhouwei strode inside, into the inner hall. Six large pillars stood in rows. At the front were two lines of silver text,

[Consult the Nine Profundities Dharma, Four Reverences Earth]
[Six Harmonies Treasure Vase, One Spirit Heaven]

Only then did he see screens on both sides, densely covered with golden text. Li Zhouwei scanned it, knowing it was an artifact refining treatise, called [Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise], which explained the method of refining treasure vases.

Li Zhouwei simply memorized it, flicked his sleeve, and his divine ability opened all the surrounding cabinets. He took out six bottles of pills. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed that too much time had passed. Even in the Grotto-Heaven's excellent preservation, three bottles were ruined. They must have been placed there for some time even back then.

The remaining three bottles had surging auras. They were this Dao lineage's spiritual pills, silver-white as if refined from metal. The aura was already somewhat unstable, and there was no pill fragrance.

He casually collected them and walked into the inner hall of the cave residence. On the meditation cushion, covered in dharma light, lay a crystalline white skeleton. Its cultivation in life hadn't been high, probably Qi Refining. It had committed suicide.

In the skeleton's arms was a jade slip, a jade pot, and two dharma artifacts that had degenerated from spirit embryos. Li Zhouwei collected the items. He saw the jade pot contained a light-cloud-like spiritual liquid, which gave off a transcendent, radiant, and profound aura.

'Also the same Dao lineage!'

Even if this wasn't a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item, it was at least a spiritual extract. Li Zhouwei collected it and picked up the jade slip to examine with his spiritual sense,

[Essence-Gathering Profound Origin Art].

This was actually a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation art that included a qi-gathering technique. It was an ancient art, and he couldn't tell its grade. The second half was missing. Clearly, these major Dao lineages stored their secret arts separately. The divine ability it condensed was called 'Bright Heart Feast'.

But what truly stirred Li Zhouwei's heart was that this art claimed to be from one of the Twelve Qis, the 'Upper Rite'.

'The Twelve Qis… only eight are manifest in the current age. Adding the Radiant Qi obtained by the Buddhist cultivators and the Exiled Qi sunk into the Underworld, that's ten total. The Daoist canons list all ten... but two of them are almost extinct…'

'And of these ten, I've seen almost all. This Dao lineage's feeling isn't like the brilliant Radiant Qi, nor the dark, unsearchable Exiled Qi… which means it must be one of the remaining two.'

# Chapter 978: The Chamber of Doubt

Li Zhouwei put away the items. After reading the jade slip, he finally understood that the jade gourd in his hand contained the 'Mystic Banquet Nectar' of the Upper Rite. The 'Bright Heart Feast' of the Essence-Gathering Profound Origin Art required 'Mystic Heart Essence Qi,' which could be extracted from this gourd.

'This could be a chance to revitalize a Dao lineage.'

A thought then sparked a question in his mind.

"Treasured Vase... Merging Nine... Back then, when Changxiao pursued my grand-uncle, he left a powerful spell art on him called the Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art. There's also the Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art..."

"Changxiao's rise began in an Encompassing Profundity Daoist Tradition somewhere in the Eastern Sea. It's Encompassing Profoundity again. There's a very high chance it's closely tied to the Daoist Tradition here... If I can find some clues from this, things might get a little easier down the line."

With this realization, he grew inwardly cautious.

"Since Changxiao comes from an Encompassing Profoundity background, he'll be like a fish in water in Wanling Heaven. He couldn't possibly miss this place. He's within this Heaven, and he's a cunning person, so I must be on my guard..."

As he left the cave dwelling, he scanned his surroundings. He felt a sense of pity. Everything within Clear Rite Peak was a good treasured artifact. Although he didn't care for them, if he were to take them and set them up, it would be enough to give his own family a cultivation ground of the highest standard.

After a final glance, he dismantled the golden-character screen dharma artifacts on both sides of the cave dwelling. With a flick of his finger, he detached the two spiritual cabinets as well. He quickly gathered them, not wasting any time, and exited the cave dwelling at top speed.

The sky and earth within this heaven were a brilliant gold. He changed direction and headed east. After a hundred-li sprint, his gains dwindled. The area was a mess. Many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had already taken the treasures, smashing the cave dwellings etched with Daoist principles and cultivation techniques. The beautiful immortal palaces and celestial pavilions were now scattered ruins, with billows of spiritual smoke and only streaks of multicolored light soaring through the air.

He feigned a search, but in reality, he was secretly using his Spirit Probe ability. Everything before his eyes constantly blurred, revealing the wonder of the Heaven and Earth's confining and collecting properties. It was like a thin veil draped over the ground, yet one particular area showed a gradual fading of color.

'This...'

He observed for a while, then followed the path forward. All the while, he activated his Heavenly Light, putting on a show of searching. As he drew closer, he saw a high platform made of silver.

On the platform stood a dilapidated ceremonial gate. The three-door, four-pillar structure was still faintly discernible. It was carved with intricate bas-reliefs, with patterns flowing from top to bottom, incorporating water, fire, earth, and wood. The central gate was the tallest, but it had been so badly damaged, as if it had been scoured by a divine ability, that the patterns were unrecognizable. It was covered in sharp sword marks.

These sword marks held a profound, ancient aura. They clearly weren't made by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who had entered. Each mark still emanated a heart-stopping power. Li Zhouwei paused for a moment, his spiritual sense picking up something.

'The divine wonder of the Heaven and Earth's confining and collecting... seems to have weakened here. And by this ceremonial gate, it's almost as if it's completely gone...'

Li Zhouwei took a step forward and closed his eyes slightly. As the suppressive force weakened, the range of his spiritual sense expanded considerably. Upon closer inspection, he could faintly connect with the boundless, pitch-black and tranquil Great Void.

'As expected, it's an exit!'

Before this Heaven opened, the suppressive force must have been much thicker. It was only now that it was possible to enter or leave...

He made a mental note of this location so he could use it as an escape route in the future. He didn't linger, continuing his flight. He sped up, his gaze constantly sweeping the ground, secretly operating his Spirit Probe. He sensed an anomaly ahead and approached it silently.

Soon, he saw a divine ability erupting, carrying a rolling, brownish-yellow light that streaked through the air, leaving a trail of dust. It was a Profound-Guarding Spirit Statue.

This particular Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, dressed in a black robe, looked young. He was a cultivator of unknown origin. Judging by his attire, he was likely a Daoist Master from the Outer Sea who had come to Jiangnan specifically for this Heaven.

What drew Li Zhouwei's focus, however, was the Profound-Guarding Spirit Statue, which was much larger and more powerful than the one at Xinhu Palace. It looked exceptionally fierce. Li Zhouwei simply circled around it and left, not wanting to meddle. With a flash of his golden eyes, he took advantage of the cultivator distracting the statue and headed directly toward the direction he came from. After flying for a while, he did indeed begin to sense a fluctuating spiritual energy in the air. His heart secretly rejoiced.

'Just as I thought... it's the same as Xinhu Palace. The key locations must have a spiritual statue guarding them. That Daoist Master must have gotten a treasure and was fleeing from this direction!'

'The smaller places have mostly been picked clean... the good stuff still needs to be fought for!'

He sped on. As he got closer to the location, he felt the Heaven and Earth's confining and collecting wonder suddenly increase by a level, reaching the same intensity as the one he felt at Xinhu Palace. Thick black light and dark clouds appeared in the distance.

Unlike Xinhu Palace, this place was engulfed in a terrifying downpour. The sky was pitch black, devoid of any light. Every drop of rain was a thick, greenish-blue color, making a sharp sizzling sound as it struck the dharma bodies.

The torrents of rain made him look up. His spiritual sense moved, and his heart instantly understood.

"The Pristine Water surging with Clear Dusk Rain... there's an artifact of Pristine Water here, most likely!"

The endless azure rain almost obscured all light. The ground below had also become a vast ocean, with remnants of broken walls and dilapidated structures faintly appearing and disappearing on the water's surface, emitting a weak glow.

He didn't need to use his Spirit Probe. He simply activated his golden eyes, seeing through the Clear Dusk Rain and taking in the entire situation.

"Hmm?"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow slightly, thinking to himself.

'An old acquaintance is here!'

Within the churning Pristine Water light, a person was flying, fighting and retreating. This person was clad in a dark blue dharma robe, with a small face and a slightly pointed chin, giving him a handsome, spirited look. His body was bolstered by a divine ability woven with purple light. It was none other than Daoist Master Yehui!

This Daoist Master had defected to the North, and he seemed to be doing quite well for himself these past few years. He was now standing in the rain, steering the purple water, holding a luminous, round pearl. Although he was fighting three others, he seemed relaxed and not at all flustered.

In contrast, the other three Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who had been chasing him were hesitating, already showing signs of retreat.

Just as Li Zhouwei was about to grip his Grand Ascension halberd, a powerful white light erupted from the distant rain. A stream of light broke through the churning, greenish-blue ruins and shot up into the sky!

The white light shimmered like a flowing waterfall. Even the obscuring Clear Dusk Rain couldn't block that blinding white light. Just by its appearance in the air, various brilliant auras rained down, causing the mist to disperse and the Pristine Light to recede.

"A Spiritual Artifact!"

And following closely, also breaking out of the rolling Pristine Water, was another person. She was clad in a python robe, short in stature, and her body was surrounded by a surging white light. She wore a triumphant smile as she raised her hand and fiercely snatched the blinding white light into her palm!

It was Zong Chang of the Great Zhao Dynasty!

This person's appearance made Li Zhouwei silently raise an eyebrow.

'A Veiled Yin cultivator, a Buddhist... a junior disciple of Taixi... a natural enemy then!'

He silently added this person to his list of enemies. He raised an eyebrow and looked at the white light. With a blink of his golden eyes, the light gradually faded, revealing intricate patterns. He understood what he was seeing.

'It's a restriction. It should contain various treasures. I'll take a look with Spirit Probe.'

Although Zong Chang's face was filled with joy, there was no hesitation. She immediately activated her Yin Qi and sped away, leaving a luminous white trail behind her. At the same time, she turned and fiercely waved a sleeve at the figures behind her.

Immediately, a torrent of white energy poured out, transforming into various white prisms, multicolored but with a biting coldness. The man behind her, with a dark expression, wore a robe of dark-colored feathers and a jade gourd at his waist. He was stepping on a misty golden fog as he sneered,

"Zong Chang! How unprincipled!"

The white prisms rushed at him, causing him to instantly raise a hand. A surging golden aura rippled out, swallowing all the white light and constantly dissolving it. The woman smiled alluringly.

"Unprincipled? So what! You're just a demonic cultivator from the Outer Sea who got a foothold in Jiangbei through the Golden Feather Sect. How dare you lecture me about principles!"

The golden and yin energies clashed, exploding into a brilliant cascade of light in the air. But then another person soared out, clad in a gauze robe, with a pure and innocent face. She was stepping on surging Valley Water. This made Li Zhouwei slightly stunned.

It was Daoist Master Xiang Chun!

She was one of the first few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators Li Zhouwei had met. She was the mistress of Changliu Mountain and the woman of Dongfang Lieyun, the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea. She was no simple character!

Daoist Master Xiang Chun stood in the air, a treasured pearl appearing behind her, scattering Valley Water light. She finally spoke, her voice cold and clear.

"Friend, you should see if you have the ability to take everything for yourself first!"

Zong Chang's expression changed subtly. She didn't react to the threat, but instead gave her a slightly provocative look, saying,

"Ah, the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea's 'madam'."

A woman's insult to another woman always hits hardest. This phrase made Daoist Master Changyun's expression change slightly. The watching Purple Mansion cultivators secretly clicked their tongues. Daoist Master Xiang Chun's face changed drastically. She said in a deep voice,

"You..."

After reaching the Purple Mansion Realm and forging a divine ability, the dharma body is a condensation of that power and can be male or female. Aside from the Maha cultivators in the North who enjoy changing back and forth, claiming they have seen through the physical world, most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators retain their original gender and appearance. However, Daoist couples at this level are still rare, with most unions occurring within sects. Such relationships between humans and demons are not mentioned openly, but everyone holds some reservations about them.

The true wife of the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea was also Dragon-kin. Although she had no territory, she was a proper, dignified Dragon. This phrase, "Dragon King of the Beihai Sea's 'madam'," was both a precise insult and a source of extreme embarrassment for Xiang Chun!

For a moment, various divine ability lights intersected, but Zong Chang was well-prepared. She threw open her sleeve, revealing a thousand-hundred illusions.

Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light

This light was murky and malevolent, like a clouded moon. A thousand-hundred sinister auras, hinting at scenes of withering plants and copulating beasts, created a maddening divine ability that severed dharma power, causing the two in front of her to halt.

But how could Changyun be ordinary? The light in his eyes flared, and the gourd at his waist bobbed slightly, as if being blown on. A turbulent golden wind, capable of pulverizing bone and reducing flesh to ash, emerged from it, blowing away the Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light.

Daoist Master Xiang Chun was equally formidable. The treasured pearl behind her spun, releasing a clear, lustrous light that swept away the bewilderment. Zong Chang knew they were not to be trifled with and never expected a single Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light to stop them. She used the momentary delay to activate her divine ability.

'The Chamber of Doubt'!

A cold, yin aura billowed behind Zong Chang, spontaneously creating a mysterious palace. The main hall and side wings were complete, with a courtyard in the front and a sundial at its very center.

The woman fell into the depths of the palace, as if plunging into an endless darkness. She vanished, disappearing completely with the 'Chamber of Doubt' into the rolling Pristine Water.

Changyun sneered. With a gentle shake of his hand, a mysterious mirror slipped from his sleeve.

"Where do you think you're going!"

The mysterious mirror released a brilliant light, layer after layer, a total of sixteen streams. They swept through the downpour like white chains, searching everywhere. Suddenly, a jolt was felt in the distance, revealing a streak of Veiled Yin white light.

Before the two could act, Zong Chang's head snapped up. She shrieked,

"Who!"

The Pristine Water Clear Dusk Rain parted to both sides. A golden halberd tore through the air, carrying Heavenly Light and colorful clouds, and struck the Veiled Yin white light first.

"Boom!"

Zong Chang's reaction was swift. A pair of long shuttles, about a foot long and as slender as silver daggers, appeared in her hands. She held them up and blocked the strike!

Veiled Yin and Bright Yang were inherently in opposition and could inflict damage on each other. For a moment, the light and dark energies separated. The Pristine Water rippled, and the scorching light illuminated Zong Chang's face, making her grit her teeth.

"Li... Zhou... Wei!"

"Clang!"

The Grand Ascension halberd twisted, causing white smoke to billow from Zong Chang's shuttles. This woman, who had been nourished by the Great Zhao court for many years, had a formidable cultivation technique and powerful strength. She managed to block the Grand Ascension halberd and exhaled a puff of white energy.

Before the white energy could change, the power of Attachment suddenly activated. The golden light leaped up, the halberd sweeping through the white energy and piercing toward her eyes!

"Hah!"

Zong Chang let out a sharp cry. The skin on her face stretched and tore open, turning into a thousand-hundred empty holes from which white energy surged out. It revealed a skeletal form beneath her beautiful skin, her flesh turning into a swarm of white bees that scattered like the wind.

A torrent of golden sand swept in. Changyun had already arrived before her!

Changyun now had two divine abilities. Xiang Chun was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Although Xiang Chun's Daoist Tradition wasn't specialized in combat, she was still troublesome enough. Earlier, Zong Chang had wanted to take everything for herself, relying on the wonder of her divine ability for movement, but with too many enemies... it was a dangerous game.

Now, with the addition of the White Qilin Li Zhouwei, who also had two divine abilities, Zong Chang knew that even if she won, it would be a pyrrhic victory. Without any hesitation, she immediately gathered her divine ability, gently raised her hand, and flung the ball of white light at the rushing Changyun!

Changyun's expression was grim.

Among the three, his cultivation was only slightly higher than Li Zhouwei's, but when it came to a fight, he wasn't at all confident he could win against this White Qilin. He even secretly made an estimate.

'He's a mortal White Qilin. It's not an exaggeration to consider him a three-divine-ability cultivator... Xiang Chun isn't good at fighting. In a one-on-one fight, without using the trump cards given to her by the Dragon-kin... she might not be a match for him!'

While he, Changyun, had his own trump cards, so did others. His own strength might even be the lowest among them. Faced with the heavy treasure thrown at him by the enemy, he showed no hesitation or greed. The surging golden wind passed over it without mercy.

A flicker of regret crossed Zong Chang's eyes.

'How cautious. It seems it's impossible to take everything for myself now!'

"Boom!"

A blinding white light erupted, so powerful that even the surrounding Pristine Water Clear Dusk Rain was unable to stop it. It dispersed the clouds and mist, causing people in the vicinity to turn their heads. The hidden Purple Mansion Realm cultivators also silently revealed themselves, casting greedy glances.

"Clang!"

As expected, several streaks of multicolored light flew out from the center. They were full of life, dragging colorful trails behind them, each streaking off in a different direction. The four closest cultivators' expressions all changed. They simultaneously flew up, each lunging toward one of the streaks!

Li Zhouwei seemed to choose randomly, flying up on a streak of Heavenly Light, but his gaze was already fixed on one of them.

This object was filled with brilliant, multicolored light, like water and like gold, swirling like a rainbow. It constantly changed its form in the air, with faint traces of Cinnabar and mercury emerging and interchanging within it, seemingly containing the philosophical essence of various Transformations—it was a Whole Pill Spiritual Artifact, a rare treasure in the world today!

# Chapter 979: Imperial Scion

Rumble!

The storm in the sky intensified. Li Zhouwei's movement seemed random, but his target was clear. His hand, wreathed in roiling Heavenly Light, abruptly closed, yet his divine ability gently shielded the spiritual object within. His other hand shot up, sliding along the halberd's shaft, and with a deft twist, brought the weapon up into a block.

He brought the halberd in his left hand back, slashing diagonally across the sky to block his right flank. A sharp clang rang out as it parried a silver dagger that struck like a venomous wasp. The keen white blade, caught on the halberd's crescent-moon guard, hissed with billowing green smoke.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes swept the scene. Just as he'd expected—it was Zong Chang.

The woman's robes billowed, revealing glimpses of her form—one moment, fair and beautiful flesh, the next, a white-boned skeleton. As the turbulent divine ability washed over her, a pair of lilac-hued breasts could be seen swaying beneath her garments. She held one hand protectively in front of her, already clutching a gleaming white, newly acquired Jade True spiritual object.

From this single exchange, Li Zhouwei already had a clear assessment:

'The Veiled Yin dao's movement and traversal speed must be superior to Bright Yang. In fact, it's easily one of the fastest among all daos... I just secured the spiritual object, and she already managed to snatch an item and launch another attack on me!'

Although the downpour of Pristine Water obscured his vision, Li Zhouwei could sense that all the various treasures were being fiercely contested. His heart turned cold.

'What a Veiled Yin cultivator. She'd rather ignore the other treasures just to come and harass me!'

The instant the thought formed, the halberd in his hand flipped, erupting with blazing golden light. Zong Chang merely smiled. Her eyes, brimming with a wicked aura, strained in unison and then popped from their sockets, transforming into two ghostly shadows.

An intense Veiled Yin aura pulsed outward. Li Zhouwei felt the surrounding rain and cacophony instantly fade away. A vast darkness spread beneath his feet, and from within that gloom, a pale light emerged, revealing countless hands.

The hands were icy and silent. In unison, they raised their index fingers, the other four fingers pressed to their palms, pointing directly at him. Thousands upon thousands, densely packed, they surged from above, below, and all sides, unleashing a Veiled Yin radiance that washed over him, bringing with it a wave of profound fatigue.

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes. He reversed his grip on the halberd with one hand and formed a two-fingered sword sign before his chest with the other, pointing skyward. Between his brows, the eclipse sigil—a white ring around a black core—reappeared!

Emperor Qi's Light!

Myriad streams of light, golden-fronted and black-tailed, erupted from between his brows. Each possessed a sharp spiritual awareness. In an instant, they blanketed the dark dimension, then scattered down like rain to meet every single pointing finger.

Boom! A roiling storm of power exploded. The two forces clashed relentlessly, one wave after another, triggering a cascade of detonations. Zong Chang's divine ability and dharma power were greater, causing the Veiled Yin light to mass ever more densely. But Li Zhouwei's Emperor Qi's Light was of a higher quality, even carrying traces of Supreme Yang power. It devoured all the surging radiance that rushed toward it.

Bright Yang and Veiled Yin clashed endlessly in the boundless darkness until, with a final, deafening roar, the illusion shattered. The vast, green rain reappeared, and the sound of colliding divine abilities once again filled his ears. A thin, dark sheet of Valley Water drifted down from an unknown source. Li Zhouwei looked up. The eclipse sigil between his brows, though slightly dimmed, was still erupting, its power sweeping toward the now pale-faced Zong Chang!

The woman's expression flickered, her eyes filled with faint astonishment.

'Bright Yang Inversion... he's using the Yang Cusp Wandering Light to counter my Yin Exhaustion Myriad Arrows Art... A fine response. But of course. He wants to replace the World-Guarding Imperial Monarch; how could he not be proficient in the Bright Yang Inversion arts? And how could those arts possibly be weak!'

'I miscalculated!'

In that instant, the dense barrage of Emperor Qi's Light was upon her. Zong Chang couldn't spare a moment to pacify the roiling divine ability within her. Her delicate body went limp, transforming into a wisp of white wind, swaying amidst the streams of light. Before she could fully withdraw, she realized her opponent was already charging in for the kill!

Zong Chang forcibly suppressed the urge to raise her sleeve and unleash the Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light. Her mind was perfectly clear:

'The Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light is an art of illusion. The Bright Yang path's specialty is charging headlong into peril to shatter all doubt. I absolutely cannot be careless!'

The Veiled Yin path was the mortal enemy of Bright Yang, their histories entangled in endless conflict. But under Li Qianyuan, Bright Yang had risen to a position of supreme authority, causing the Veiled Yin path to be hunted to near-extinction. When Bright Yang later shattered and Veiled Yin re-emerged, nearly every Veiled Yin Dao Lineage felt a bone-deep chill of lingering fear. In the years since the Bright Yang diaspora, the Veiled Yin Dao Lineages had been studying it relentlessly from the shadows. A single Veiled Yin Dao Lineage might not grasp the full spectrum of Veiled Yin transformations, but it would absolutely know how to counter Bright Yang!

Her Dao Lineage, Zong Chang's, and Wei Xuanyin's Dao Lineage—both understood Bright Yang!

Instead of retreating, she advanced, bracing herself against the oncoming streams of light as she thrust her silver dagger forward. The resulting collision sent a sickening flush of green and white across her face, but it successfully halted her opponent's charge. Only then did a light finally begin to glow from within her sleeve.

Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light!

Li Zhouwei's brow furrowed. He knew his opponent must have a deep understanding of his dao. He thrust the halberd forward as his eyes blazed with golden light. High above, iridescent clouds and Heavenly Light converged. His 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' divine ability instantly bore down!

The roiling powers of Bright Yang and Veiled Yin rushed together. The resulting explosion should have been world-shaking, but at the very instant of impact, Zong Chang's eyes flew wide. Li Zhouwei also turned his head, a flicker of surprise on his face.

Every sound within the churning Pristine Water abruptly ceased. All the cultivators nearby looked up as one. A piercing shriek filled their ears as a brilliant white radiance surged from the ground, punching a hole straight through the heavens. It split the rain clouds, forcing them to part.

The white light that filled the sky flashed for a blinding instant. Even Yehui, standing off to the side, turned to look. A single thought flashed through everyone's mind:

'Sword Intent!'

Though everyone's attention was captured, the clashing divine abilities in the sky didn't pause for even a fraction of a second. Zong Chang gave a faint smile, and the vast, orderly palace manifested behind her once more.

'Chamber of Doubt'!

The moment this divine ability appeared, Li Zhouwei's halberd, the Grand Ascension, began to seethe, its weight fluctuating wildly. This allowed her two silver daggers to twist free. The woman herself plummeted back into the deep palace, vanishing into the white mist.

Her figure reappeared several miles away, leaving only the 'Chamber of Doubt' to face the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate'. The illusory palace spun lightly, its halls shifting and windows contracting, before it dissipated completely.

'So that was her escape plan...'

Li Zhouwei retrieved his Grand Ascension, his gaze sweeping over the weapon with a hint of doubt.

'A divine ability specialized in escaping... It can even influence the weapon in my hand...'

The 'Chamber of Doubt' was, without question, the most effective long-distance escape divine ability he had ever seen, and with a minimal cost. As it was a 'Veiled Yin' art, his 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' had great difficulty in suppressing it.

She had clearly only come to probe his strength. Not wanting to waste any more time, Li Zhouwei swept his gaze aside and spotted a man with a sword standing not far away.

The man was eight feet tall and simply dressed, his attire resembling that of the Shu region. His face was surprisingly young, long, and with broad eyebrows. His eyes weren't large, but they were exceptionally calm as they swept across the low-hanging rain clouds.

Clang!

He sheathed his sword. Roiling golden energy circled him. Though he only looked to have just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, his aura was incredibly potent. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator he'd been fighting had taken a blow from his sword and fled, leaving behind only a small, golden 'Geng Metal' spiritual object, which floated down into his hand.

The sword immortal casually caught the spiritual object and strode away on a path of light.

Li Zhouwei looked away, his mind stirring.

'I wonder which sect that sword immortal belongs to... I'd heard there was a sword immortal of the Supreme Yang Dao in the Northern Sea, and now here's a Metal Virtue sword immortal! This Donghua Heaven is truly alluring. All these figures who normally refuse to emerge from their mountain retreats... today, they've all come swarming to this Grotto-Heaven!'

Li Zhouwei had heard of another sword immortal who cultivated in Qize, known as the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal. But that individual had reached the Purple Mansion Realm long ago and was far more powerful. It couldn't be this man...

His thoughts flickered and were gone. He tore through the rain, speeding toward the nearest battle. Halberd held bright, he raised an eyebrow and took in the scene.

The area was a swirl of chaos, with five or six cultivators entangled in battle. A very old-looking Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was trapped mid-air, flanked by two Merciful Ones. He gritted his teeth, his divine ability strained to its limit, clearly struggling under the pincer attack.

Most of the Merciful Ones who could enter this place were followers of the Lotus Temple. These veterans knew various Dharma Arts, possessed Treasured Artifacts, and had tough, durable Dharma Bodies. An ordinary early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would be hard-pressed to deal with them. Three in formation would be a headache even for a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert. Although the old man had perfected a divine ability, he was still overwhelmed by the assault from two.

But Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flashed. He saw another Merciful One speeding toward them, clearly a compatriot of the first two. The newcomer's face was lit with joy, and at his waist hung a jade ring that pulsed with the unmistakable aura of an Immortal Dao artifact!

Li Zhouwei was already streaking toward them. Seeing this, he showed no mercy. He dove from the sky, his halberd a blur, crashing down like a golden comet. With a resounding clang, he smashed into a halo of light.

Boom! The halo shattered, and a Merciful One tumbled out from the blinding light. His face was a ghastly purple-green, like a vengeful spirit. His expression changed, a deep chill seizing him. He scrambled to look up, only to be met by the sight of a gleaming halberd point stabbing directly at his face!

"Not good!"

The man's reaction was lightning-fast. His body swelled like a balloon. He opened his mouth wide and spat out a jet of golden light. Instantly, five-colored radiance flared, lotus flowers bloomed, and the tinkling of crystal chimes filled the air. But the Grand Ascension didn't slow in the slightest, roaring as it smashed down!

The golden light the Merciful One had spat out was shattered like glass by the massive halberd. It only managed to slow the Grand Ascension for a fraction of a second. The halberd's 'Attachment' ability manifested, creating a phantom double. The real and phantom halberds struck the purple-faced Merciful One from front and back simultaneously.

Pitiable wretch. Caught off guard, the lotus divine ability he had just started to circulate was blocked by the 'Attachment' phantom. The true Grand Ascension smashed into him a moment later. He let out a wretched cry. His forward momentum instantly ceased, and he was blasted backward even faster than he had arrived, crashing into the ruins with a thunderous boom that sent up a waterfall of spray.

Splash... Li Zhouwei had already spun his halberd, resting it against his back. He formed a two-fingered sign at his chest, and as the sigil between his brows flashed, he decisively unleashed Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

The purple-faced Merciful One was reeling from the blow. Heavenly Light raged inside him, and violet flames licked across his skin. Dazed, a grievous, cracking wound already spreading across his chest, he had only just pushed himself upright when the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light descended...

Boom! A massive column of water exploded upward. But the light from Li Zhouwei's brow did not pause. It transformed into a golden beam that lanced across the heavens, exceptionally bright in the storm, its color intensifying with every passing moment.

One misstep had led to a cascade of errors. He was pinned to the ground by the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, unable to move, relying solely on his tough Dharma Body to barely resist. As he felt the divine ability's power escalating, he cried out in despair:

"Quick, save me!"

This cry made the two Merciful Ones attacking the Purple Mansion Realm expert falter. The old man, however, was overjoyed. He peered at the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light lancing through the rainy night, found the divine ability's aura familiar, and deliberately shouted:

"Is that Daoist Friend Zhaojing?! This humble one is Yan Dushui. I implore you to save me!"

"Yan Dushui?"

Suspended in the air, Li Zhouwei didn't answer. Instead, he abruptly looked up. His halberd, which had been gathering power, flicked upward as if to parry, plucking a golden pearl from thin air.

The pearl was no larger than a thumb, but it struck with immense force, causing Li Zhouwei to shudder and interrupting his Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. A flash of surprise crossed his eyes.

"Not bad."

He was only mildly surprised, but the purple-faced Merciful One below was scared witless. While that pearl wasn't his life-mandate bonded Treasured Artifact, he had still spent decades refining it as a backup, even infusing it with 'Wandering Metal', a spiritual resource that aided concealment. It was designed for powerful sneak attacks. How could it be parried so easily!

'Back when Helian Wujiang fought Chiluo, it must have been just like this!'

But what truly made his eyes burn with fury was that the golden-eyed man in the sky manifested a brilliant Celestial Gate behind him. With a flex of his arms and a flick of his halberd, he suppressed his Treasured Artifact, the 'Xiao Xu Pearl', beneath the divine ability!

'That disgusting suppression divine ability!'

Li Zhouwei didn't stand on ceremony. The pearl was clearly made of fine materials. Even if he couldn't trade it, he could try to dismantle it later and extract the resources. That would be excellent. When Suiguan had attacked and Taixi fled, the golden ring used to bind his weapon had also ended up in Li Zhouwei's possession. Both items would have their use.

Having casually suppressed the man's Treasured Artifact, he had no intention of letting him go. He executed 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' and rode the light to charge down!

Knowing his opponent was too strong, the purple-faced Merciful One already wanted to retreat. He had no desire to be injured. Gritting his teeth, his divine ability surged:

"If you two don't come now... I'm not holding on to this treasure!"

That shout was finally effective. The other two Merciful Ones assessed the situation. They weren't going to take down Yan Dushui anytime soon and might end up losing everything. They exchanged a look and shot over to help.

But now it was Yan Dushui's turn to sneer. His own vast divine ability erupted, attempting to pin both of them down!

The purple-faced Merciful One couldn't spare a thought for the other battle. He wasn't Zong Chang, with her deep Dao-Profundity! He didn't have her counters! This golden-eyed fiend had already passed through the obstructing golden winds and glazed light he'd spat out as if they were water, and was now right in his face!

With utmost reluctance, he could only summon his life-mandate bonded lotus throne, unleashing a boundless radiance to defend himself. But the thick golden light brought him no sense of security. The eclipse sigil between his opponent's brows was already flaring, making his every hair stand on end.

'This Grotto-Heaven is suppressed by a Dharma Treasure; I can't even connect to the Buddhist Land! How can I possibly fight him!'

'Forget it! I don't want it!'

With lightning speed, he unhooked the jade ring and threw it straight at Li Zhouwei's halberd. Glowing sigils erupted across his skin as he burned all of his Dharma Body power as fuel for an escape art, using that single instant to leap away.

"You want it? Then take it!"

Li Zhouwei's seemingly unstoppable halberd flicked delicately, hooking the jade ring. He didn't even glance at it. His eyes were fixed on the fleeing streak of light. From between his brows, thousands upon thousands of golden-black streams of Emperor Qi's Light erupted in pursuit!

Emperor Qi's Light was nothing like the cumbersome Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

Thousands of golden-black streams of light gave chase, accelerating until they finally struck their target in the far distance. A silent explosion blossomed. The streak of light tumbled from the sky like a broken-winged bird, trailing smoke as it fell. Only then did Li Zhouwei look away.

The two Merciful Ones attacking Yan Dushui, seeing the tide turn, had long since fled, abandoning their target. The old Daoist Master flew over, his pupils filled with terror, seemingly at a loss for words.

The scale-like, golden profound patterns on the victor's face were slowly fading, but they couldn't conceal the ferocious aura of battle clinging to him. His dark golden eyes swept over, startling the old man so badly he almost fell out of the air.

"A mistake, a mistake! I mistook you for someone else... no relation! Daoist friend... my apologies, my apologies!"

'Mistaken identity?'

Li Zhouwei was noncommittal. The old Daoist Master was cunning; he'd only shouted that name to scare off the two Merciful Ones. He likely still had other treasures on him. Now, under Li Zhouwei's gaze, he grew wary once more.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him and said indifferently,

"My grand-uncle has mentioned you, Senior. So it's not quite 'no relation'."

"Oh!"

Yan Dushui was both embarrassed and delighted. Clearly, the White Qilin's reputation was great, and he'd recognized Li Zhouwei's lineage earlier. He seemed genuinely surprised that Li Zhouwei knew of him. The old man's eyes, which looked quite profound, darted about as his mind clearly raced. He said hurriedly,

"'Good... good! Our two families were once acquainted! This Grotto-Heaven is fraught with danger... why don't you allow me to assist you, Daoist friend...'"

He made it sound pleasant, but he just wanted to ride Li Zhouwei's coattails.

Li Zhouwei wasn't interested. He possessed the 'Spirit Probe' ability, allowing him to avoid disaster and seek fortune. Traveling alone, he could go wherever he pleased. If someone tagged along, all his erratic movements would arouse suspicion, and he'd have to invent excuses, to say nothing of splitting his gains.

Besides, he didn't trust this old man. He smiled faintly and replied,

"'I wouldn't want to burden you, Senior. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Shilou family is looking to challenge me later. It would be terrible if you were injured in the crossfire.'"

Yan Dushui had wanted to leech off his good fortune but was also afraid of being caught up in his karmic entanglements. He had been worried, and Li Zhouwei's words gave him the perfect excuse. He quickly seized the opening, sighing dramatically and offering a few more apologies before hurriedly retreating.

Li Zhouwei, having heard his name before, treated the encounter as a minor interlude. Since it concerned his grand-uncle, he didn't dwell on it. Without even inspecting his new treasure, his 'Spirit Probe' swept the battlefield, and the situation became clear.

"'That's about it... This place has been picked clean.'"

Although the Pristine Water and Clear Dusk Rain continued to fall, the sounds of battle had clearly subsided. This place was dangerous, and everyone was conserving their divine abilities. Those who failed to snatch a treasure didn't linger, moving on to other locations. Those who had succeeded were long gone.

Thus, he rode a beam of light and swiftly departed. As he flew, he flipped his hand over, revealing the jade ring.

This was the treasure he had just seized. It was palm-sized, composed of two concentric rings. It shimmered with a smoky, crimson-infused light, its color so captivating one couldn't bear to put it down. Li Zhouwei weighed it gently, and after a quick scan with his spiritual sense, he understood its nature.

He possessed a 'Jade Smoke Mountain' artifact, which was made of 'Highbright Profound Jade'. The Aged Courtly Path Sutra mentioned that if 'Highbright Profound Jade' was soaked in Water Mansion for a century and refined with a great divine ability, it would nurture a new kind of spiritual jade: one that shimmered with a smoky, crimson-infused light. That was this 'Supreme Goodness Profound Jade'.

The outer ring of the artifact was this 'Supreme Goodness Profound Jade', a spiritual resource on par with the Purple Mansion Realm level. And there was a lot of it—if dismantled, it would yield three to five full portions!

The inner ring was a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual object called 'Cascading Profound White Jade'. It was an excellent item for those on the Jade True path, capable of expelling demons and even reconstructing a Dharma Body. If resonated with using one's divine ability and dharma power, it could even help bring a Jade True divine ability to perfection.

But Li Zhouwei's standards were high. He could see clearly that both the 'Cascading Profound White Jade' and the 'Supreme Goodness Profound Jade' had been fused into this ring shape by someone with immense dharma power. To dismantle it for its raw materials would be a criminal waste.

'The original owner of this ring, ten to one, intended to refine it into a Spiritual Artifact. That's why they would expend so much divine ability and dharma power to fuse the two jades and specifically forge them into this shape. It's just that circumstances didn't allow it, and they never finished...'

The ring's value was high. With so many cultivators practicing the Jade True path, this would be a supreme treasure in their eyes. Li Zhouwei put it away, thoroughly satisfied. He sighed inwardly.

'This... this is the legacy of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. A horde of Daoist Masters descending upon the fallen to carve up the spoils. Every one of them is making out like a bandit, grabbing items worth hundreds of years of cultivation. If the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition were still at its height, just how formidable would it be!'

'Such a colossus... how could it have fallen just like that?'

Li Zhouwei looked away and continued speeding across the land. He found nothing else. The scenery changed, and soon he arrived above a sprawling ruin. Closing his eyes, he sensed a powerful sealing and containment aura, just like the one at Xinhu Palace.

But he was too late. The place was empty, save for one or two damaged Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues wandering aimlessly.

"'Already picked clean...'"

He was beginning to understand. The initial frenzy was over. Now, either a more important location had been discovered and cultivators were working together to open it, or... cultivators were simply fighting each other, unwilling to leave empty-handed.

Rain began to fall again, the torrential Clear Dusk Rain once more descending upon the world. He flew for a time, then his gaze suddenly sharpened. He squinted into the distance.

Through the downpour, pinpricks of bright dharma light flashed, flickering in and out of view. Someone was fighting on the move.

"'What a coincidence.'"

Li Zhouwei cast a cold gaze in that direction and shot forward. After only a breath or two, he adjusted his course, dispersed his aura, and came to a stop in the rain. He held his halberd steady, quietly watching the space ahead.

The Pristine Water churned. A streak of light tore through it.

The approaching cultivator, riding a streak of light wreathed in baleful qi, was moving incredibly fast. He flew right to the spot, his divine abilities gathered. When he suddenly saw Li Zhouwei, he froze. Surprise flickered across his handsome face before it turned to ice.

Despite being caught in a pincer, he remained calm. His hands drifted from his waist, sliding past the hilts of a sword, a saber, and a whip. His voice was deep and low.

"'How may this Daoist friend instruct me?'"

Li Zhouwei casually stretched his arms, a seemingly natural movement that completely blocked the man's path. His halberd pointed diagonally at the ground, letting the rain hiss and evaporate against the Heavenly Light wreathing its blade. He spoke, his tone full of amusement.

"'Didn't you mention to my elder... that you wished to witness the might of an Imperial Scion?'"

He was smiling, but his expression was glacial. The scale-like golden patterns on his face began to glow, and the halberd, which had been pointing at the ground, slowly rose.

"'Minghuang is here.'"




# Chapter 980: Repayment

The man was none other than Helian Wujiang!

The ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom and the man responsible for the Helian family's resurgence looked grim. The light of pursuit behind him was closing in fast. Li Zhouwei's interception had placed him in grave danger.

To make matters worse, he recalled his mission to Caishan all those years ago under Wei Xuanyin's orders. He had exchanged a few pleasantries, something about witnessing the "might of the Imperial Scion." It seemed this White Qilin had long held a grudge for the injuries Li Ximing sustained and was here today to make him pay!

'This boy... he's called a White Qilin, but he has all the cunning of a Red Cicada. All those times by the riverbank, I never heard him utter a single threat. Yet when he strikes, it's sudden, and the bite chills you to the bone!'

With things having reached this point, Helian Wujiang let out a long breath. He raised his long whip in one hand and tore at the robes on his back with the other. Circulating his Baleful Qi, he tapped the ground lightly. In an instant, endless black shadows surged from behind him, blanketing the area. The surroundings transformed into a demonic baleful domain as over a hundred towering peaks of Baleful Qi manifested, thrusting into the sky.

'Rakshasa Sea.'

'Incessant Calamity.'

He knew this wouldn't end peacefully, not with pursuers at his back. He attacked with his full strength from the outset. Within this demonic domain, baleful winds howled. Streams of black energy wove between the Baleful Qi peaks, emitting ear-piercing shrieks. As the churning winds coiled around him, Li Zhouwei raised his halberd and shot across the sky.

Helian Wujiang's whip lashed out with incredible speed, coiling like a venomous serpent through the air. Amidst the golden flash of Li Zhouwei's attack, the whip keenly bound something, causing Helian Wujiang's arm to drop heavily. He had snagged the Grand Ascension Halberd!

Helian Wujiang was extremely confident in his whip. The spiritual item used to refine it could withstand the sharpest of Spiritual Artifacts. Having snared Grand Ascension, he even felt a trace of ease.

But Li Zhouwei abruptly yanked the halberd, pulling the Spiritual Artifact whip taut. The sudden force caused Helian Wujiang to stiffen for a fraction of a second. In that instant, the golden-white Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light erupted from between Li Zhouwei's brows, transforming into a single, all-penetrating golden beam within the dark, wind-swept world!

He snapped his head around. The beam of golden-white Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light swept out like a peerlessly sharp, handleless spiritual blade. It nearly severed the Baleful Qi pervading the world in two. One after another, the peaks of Baleful Qi were sliced apart, collapsing into roiling clouds of malevolence with a series of deafening booms.

Helian Wujiang's expression darkened, but he refused to release the whip. A dim light gathered between his brows. He snapped his head up and roared:

"Hah!"

The ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom was no easy opponent. With that shout, three circular black runes appeared between his brows, and his eyes turned a deep, abyssal black. Torrents of black fire and white-gold light rained down around him as radiant balefulness flared. A massive baleful phantom materialized behind him.

This baleful phantom drove a chariot, clad in bronze armor and wielding a long saber. An iron core hovered at its brow. Wherever the chariot passed, black fire and white-gold light erupted, rivers flowed backward, and the entire baleful sea began to boil!

This display finally forced a woman out of the sky. She wore gauze robes and had a pure, clear face. It was Daoist Master Xiang Chun who had been pursuing him. She frowned slightly, and the precious orb behind her lit up once more, suppressing all the baleful light with ripples of Valley Water.

Li Zhouwei had spotted her location long ago. His blast of Heavenly Light from his brow, which had cleared the baleful sea, was meant to give her a chance to sneak close to Helian Wujiang. Unfortunately, Helian Wujiang's Dao arts were profound. He likely possessed Dao-Profundity in his eyes as well, allowing him to see through the attempt instantly.

The baleful phantom spanning the sky was already pressing down, bringing with it a turbid current. Its long saber fell from the sky, chopping toward Li Zhouwei! Only then did Helian Wujiang release his whip, turning to defend against the woman's Valley Water light.

Sunless Deceit!

"Boom!"

Li Zhouwei inverted his halberd. A torrent of black light flowed from the weapon he held, branching outward. At his command, the Sun's Resonant Parting Art activated. Rolling light of the Supreme Yang and Li Fire spiraled around him, surging up his body to the very tip of the halberd's blade, illuminating the area with brilliant radiance.

"Clang!"

The halberd immediately flipped, shifting from a block to a sweep. In the span of a breath, he clashed with the baleful phantom dozens of times, setting off explosions of Heavenly Light and Li Fire. Li Zhouwei took one step back, dodging the brunt of the phantom's attack. Grand Ascension spun in a full circle, like a golden lightning bolt tearing through the sky. Empowered by the ability of Attachment, it smashed thunderously into the baleful phantom!

The massive body instantly exploded in a blinding mix of radiance and balefulness. Li Zhouwei planted his halberd, raising his other hand to his chest. He brought two fingers together, and the colorful clouds in the sky above parted, revealing blinding Heavenly Light.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

Daoist Master Xiang Chun cultivated Valley Water. She excelled at self-preservation, healing, and escape. However, her offensive power was inferior even to Murong Yan's. If she truly had any effective restraining techniques, she wouldn't have let Helian Wujiang retreat all the way here.

In that mere instant, Helian Wujiang had already transformed into a baleful wind, intending to flee. Audience with the Celestial Gate immediately shone down from above, forcing him to dispel the Dharma wind. His Baleful Qi roiled, flickering in and out of form in mid-air.

At that exact moment, an old man suddenly appeared within the churning baleful wind. He looked ancient and was only at the early-stage Purple Mansion Realm, shrouded in a bright white Dharma light. But in his hand, he held a violet-lightning jade bell that looked extraordinary. The moment he appeared, a massive thunderstorm descended, and eighteen bolts of lightning struck as one!

"Rumble!"

Helian Wujiang had already been forced to reposition twice. The lightning was astonishingly fast. He finally failed to dodge the attack and let out a muffled grunt amidst the rolling thunder, coughing up a mouthful of blood and causing the surrounding Baleful Qi to seethe.

The ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom was finally enraged. His voice was low and heavy.

"Yu Ming..."

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flickered. He instantly identified the newcomer's cultivation as Jade True. Staring at the brilliant flashes of lightning, a thought crossed his mind:

'An early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Jade True cultivator and a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Valley Water cultivator... No wonder he made it here so easily.'

Before Helian Wujiang could say more, a golden beam of light shot out from the roiling thunderclouds. The bright halberd blade pointed directly at him. Li Zhouwei was attacking again!

Sovereign's Perilous Tread!

Dense, golden, scale-like patterns immediately surfaced on the man's face. Empowered by Sovereign's Perilous Tread, the hastily summoned Baleful Qi was like tattered cloth, offering no resistance at all.

At this critical juncture, Helian Wujiang's hand finally grasped the short blade at his waist.

"Clang!"

An iridescent black light flashed through the air. With a sharp ring, the black short blade struck the tip of Grand Ascension. He had refined this Spiritual Artifact for many years, and its power was terrifying—it had nearly severed Li Ximing's Dharma body back then. Now, slamming into Grand Ascension, it instantly sent the halberd flying high, bending it back as a wave of yin light washed over it, suppressing the weapon.

Helian Wujiang had already drawn the Dharma sword from his waist, stirring the Baleful Qi!

"Boom!"

But just as the baleful radiance flared, a heavy, dim-gray light descended. Sunless Deceit activated, slowing his newly launched spell art mid-cast. Daoist Master Xiang Chun protected herself with her precious orb and blew out a gust of gray wind, while on the other side, the lightning began to gather once more!

Sunless Deceit was truly insidious. It had seemed to be resolved, but it had merely been lying dormant. Its sudden activation completely disrupted Helian Wujiang's plans, and a powerful sense of crisis rose in his heart.

'If I hesitate any longer... I will face certain doom!'

The three black runes on his brow lit up again. The roiling baleful winds, accumulated over many years of cultivation, erupted forth, forming a dense barrier in front of him. With a flick of his sleeve, two white-light jade boxes shot out, riding the gales in different directions.

It was the spiritual items he had obtained!

This immediately made the other two pause. Neither of their families had any feud with the Helian family; they were only here to snatch the spiritual items. Now that he was backing down, why would they offend him to the death? They instantly shot off to grab the items. Helian Wujiang didn't hesitate for a second, activating his Rakshasa Sea at full power to stall Li Zhouwei!

His figure instantly dissolved into a cloud of black balefulness. Seizing the moment the other two had intentionally relaxed their guard, he decisively shot away, tanking the falling lightning and the surging Valley Water!

He had only moved a few body-lengths when the rolling Heavenly Light and colorful clouds descended from the sky. But Helian Wujiang had endured the lightning and Valley Water precisely to save his strength for this moment. Blood essence and Baleful Qi erupted together, shifting his entire Rakshasa Sea dozens of yards to the side, narrowly avoiding the descending celestial gate.

Although his face was growing pale, his speed amidst the gloom was extreme. He was about to escape!

His technique was marvelous, but it was just like Helian Wumeng's back then. If Helian Wujiang could use his experience to predict a Bright Yang suppression art, how could Li Zhouwei, having seen the Helian family's spell arts once before, not be prepared?

Immediately, strands of fine, silk-like white light rained down from the sky.

Radiant Celestial Wave Art!

Li Zhouwei had already descended on a beam of light, crashing into the Baleful Qi. His eyes were brilliant gold, staring right at Helian Wujiang through the dense miasma. Helian Wujiang was a master of spell arts, but his close-quarters movement techniques within the Baleful Qi were inferior to Helian Wumeng's. How could he hide? The gaze sent a chill through Helian Wujiang's heart.

"Not good!"

In his bid to escape the encirclement, he had lost all initiative and been constrained at every step. His spiritual blade had just returned to his waist, its power dormant. He had just used his lateral-shift technique, and his baleful light had been seen through. It was an awkward moment, yet he showed no panic. His eyes instantly lit up, releasing a blood-red glow.

The armor on Helian Wujiang's chest immediately split open, revealing a blood-red chest cavity. Black blood roiled as his heart suddenly flipped over, exposing a starkly black-and-white demonic eye on its reverse side.

"Freeze!"

This demonic art was Helian Wujiang's trump card, one of the cornerstones of his many victories and his reputation throughout Mobei. Its power was immense; Li Ximing had suffered greatly against it back then. As it activated, the eye in his heart immediately pulsed with a stuttering, golden, immobilizing light!

The golden light struck Li Zhouwei at extreme speed, but his golden eyes remained cold and tranquil!

The golden, scale-like mystic runes surfaced on his cheeks again, imbuing his face with boundless dignity. The cascading golden light felt like nothing more than a gentle breeze; not only did it fail to root him in place, it actually made the runes on his face shine brighter!

Sovereign's Perilous Tread—to adapt to the moment and return to the proper path.

Helian Wujiang's infallible demonic art had finally failed. He had considered that it might be less effective, but he had never imagined that such a profound technique would be rendered completely useless!

In an instant, his gamble had backfired!

He was caught completely off guard, his pupils shrinking. His lips had only just begun to part, his devouring technique yet to be unleashed, when the brilliant golden halberd pierced through.

"Boom!"

The Baleful Qi exploded skyward as clouds of black smoke billowed out. Helian Wujiang's face went deathly pale, and he coughed up blood. The blade of Grand Ascension had run him through. The golden tip of the halberd emerged from his spine, shining with a dazzling light.

From the front, he had been nearly severed at the waist. The blade had entered exactly at his sea of qi!

What flared up at the same time was the golden Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

This intense, bright radiance burst forth, smashing into him point-blank. It accurately detonated a blast of Bright Yang light on his forehead. In an instant, flesh melted away, revealing stark white bone. The attack dissolved the flesh from half his face, which dissipated as rising wisps of Baleful Qi.

"Bang!"

A torrent of Baleful Qi erupted, shrouding everything in the black, murky baleful sea. Blood light and shadows intertwined. Li Zhouwei's halberd was suddenly empty. All that remained were gusts of baleful wind—formed from Purple Mansion Realm blood—coiling around the shaft, wailing and shrieking.

From within the darkness, a single streak of white light shot out, fleeing in the opposite direction.

Li Zhouwei didn't pursue. He simply reached out, flipped his halberd, and snagged the object just before the other two beams of Dharma light could seize it. With a casual pat, he dispelled the Baleful Qi and divine ability clinging to it and tucked it into his sleeve.

'He's a decisive one, I'll give him that. Willing to take my full attack just to stabilize his mind and activate his escape art... He even calmly threw out the spiritual items to divide our attention.'

Helian Wujiang would be in absolute agony after that blow. Grand Ascension had pierced him, shattered his sea of qi, and the added trauma from Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light had melted half his face. Li Zhouwei calculated coldly:

'This should be enough to repay the injuries my uncle suffered... It's just a pity Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light isn't high-grade enough. It didn't blow his entire head apart. And our two families' Dharma bodies can't be compared. He got off easy...'

Cultivators of the Baleful Qi Daoist Tradition didn't have powerful Dharma Bodies, but their Dharma bodies excelled at transformation, gathering and scattering at will. Even when injured, they were easier to heal. But no matter how easy it was, he absolutely couldn't recover his strength in a short time—especially not in this grotto-heaven, where restorative and containment powers were suppressed, making healing even harder.

'He'll have almost no share of the harvests to come.'

As he mused, the Illuminating Sun and Moon within Li Zhouwei's body began to shine brightly, slowly releasing divine ability and dharma power.

The battle, though brief, had been intense, requiring the continuous use of spell arts and divine abilities. He had consumed nearly twenty percent of his dharma power. But with his Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities, after only a moment's rest, his own dharma power began to recover. Aided by Illuminating Sun and Moon, it was regenerating at an extremely rapid pace.

More importantly, Illuminating Sun and Moon was steadily advancing his Dao-Profundity. Profound vistas of the Bright Yang surfaced in Li Zhouwei's mind, causing him to space out for a moment. To avoid looking strange, he immediately turned his head and smiled.

"Fellow Daoists!"

The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators materialized. Daoist Master Xiang Chun had, of course, recognized him long ago. Compared to the cold indifference she showed other cultivators, her attitude toward him was relatively gentle, though her eyes still held a deep shock. She nodded slightly.

"Thank you for your help, Fellow Daoist... We have all gained something."

Xiang Chun was well aware of Helian Wujiang's strength. Her earlier pursuit was mostly out of annoyance that he was hoarding everything. She had been debating whether to use a trump card to force him to share, but she never expected things to end this way. Suppressing the strange look in her eyes, she turned her head slightly to introduce the other.

"This is Daoist Master Yu Ming of the Jiangbei Shen Clan."

Li Zhouwei had heard his Daoist title before. He was an elder Daoist Master, an Alchemist from the previous generation. Clearly, his lifespan was at its limit, and he had come here to try his luck. Li Zhouwei bowed respectfully and replied:

"The Shen Clan and my family have friendly relations. I have long heard of your great name."

With Yue Cultivating Sect having sealed its mountain, Jiangbei had been an unsettled land for many years. For the Shen Clan to protect itself to this day, they clearly had their methods. Daoist Master Yu Ming smiled and replied. Daoist Master Xiang Chun then smiled faintly and asked:

"I've heard some news. Due east of here, there is a massive formation spanning the sky. Many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are gathered there... I wonder, Fellow Daoist... are you interested?"

# Chapter 981: Qi Xi

Daoist Master Xiang Chun, with her ties to the Dragon-kin, naturally possessed her own methods. While she had never heard of any connection between the Dragon-kin and the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition, the Dragon-kin were undeniably one of the greatest powers in the world, backed by the Dragon Monarch himself.

Despite the potential for a future conflict of interest with Li Zhouwei, and the ambiguity of their current intentions, the White Dragon lineage had so far provided more benefits than harm. They had even sent a Spiritual Treasure when he had his breakthrough. Thus, Li Zhouwei nodded to the Daoist Master and replied, "Since we've met by chance, let us proceed together."

After all, he had already scoured the surrounding areas and had nowhere else to go. Having her lead the way would save him considerable effort.

At his words, Xiang Chun's expression brightened. Beside them, Daoist Master Yu Ming flicked his sleeves, declaring magnanimously, "I only came in to try my luck. I've had a decent harvest and am quite satisfied, so I won't venture any deeper. I'll just look around these parts, pick up a few small things, and find a weak point in the formation to head back!"

It was undoubtedly a wise choice. Though Daoist Master Yu Ming was nearing the end of his lifespan and had come here to risk his life for his family's legacy, his gains would mean nothing if he didn't make it out alive. To perish here would be to lose everything and then some.

Seeing him ride the wind and depart, Xiang Chun nodded in acknowledgment before flying up alongside Li Zhouwei.

She spoke in a low voice, "Jiangbei is unstable. Cultivation Transcendence keeps its gates closed, and the Shen family has lost a great deal of territory. But the old patriarch is cunning; he took the opportunity to move his people overseas. They're settling in the outer seas, likely planning to establish themselves as an overseas clan in a practical sense."

Li Zhouwei nodded silently. With the Wave-Suppressing Mansion abroad and his own excellent conditions, he too was confident he could retreat if necessary. If his clan weren't such a crucial piece on the board, he would have left long ago. "They're lacking successors, after all," he replied, "and Jiangbei is a dangerous place."

But Xiang Chun shook her head wistfully. "Not necessarily... though the danger is quite real."

The Dragon-kin controlled the Eastern Sea. If the Shen family were making any moves, it was highly unlikely they could escape the Dragon-kin's notice. Li Zhouwei made a mental note of this. As they traveled, Xiang Chun continued softly, "Have you not been leaving the lake much in recent years, fellow Daoist?"

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. With the grand political situation between the north and south, he had to consider his clan and had little freedom to venture out. "Moongaze Lake is by the river, and the currents are turbulent."

A knowing look passed through Xiang Chun’s eyes. She lowered her voice. "That may not always be the case. There are a few clans who still have designs on you and will likely come to test the waters. If you truly wish to protect your bloodline on the lake, it is wise not to act rashly. However, once you advance further, with three divine abilities, or perhaps even attain the rank of Great Daoist Master and perfect your abilities, it will no longer matter..."

"By then, those in the world who could claim to be your superior could be counted on one hand. Petty schemers might still try to test you, but they will no longer be able to bear the price of failure."

Her expression grew solemn, her demeanor more composed. "When that time comes, feel free to visit the Eastern Sea more often. The Dragon Prince has defended you before the various lineages. If you could visit the Dragon Palace a few times afterward to meet with him, it would give him more leeway."

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment. He understood that the Dragon Prince she referred to was Dingjiao. The crown prince of the White Dragon lineage was a figure of considerable magnanimity, and both he and his father, the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea, belonged to the faction that advocated for leniency and fostering good relations with him, a White Qilin. Dingjiao had sought him out early on, even taking him to see the former crown prince of Wei...

'It's hard to tell what's true and what's false,' Li Zhouwei mused, 'but at the very least, no other dragon has been willing to make contact. The White Dragon line must have been under significant pressure...'

Li Zhouwei fell silent for a moment before nodding. "Thank you for the reminder, fellow Daoist."

She smiled faintly, then changed the subject, finally asking the question on her mind. "I've heard that... Wuguang Luoxia left no instructions for the Daoist Traditions, acting as if they were unaware of your existence. This is interesting. I wonder where Daoist Master Xue went after heading south."

Her eyes were sharp as she stared directly at Li Zhouwei, though she seemed to be asking and answering her own question. "Daoist Master Xue has perfected his divine abilities and reached the pinnacle of the five techniques; an Auxiliary Position is within his grasp. In ancient times, he would have been the Hall Master of an immortal mansion, an acting authority. As vast as Wanling Heaven is, if he had been born there, he would be seated beside the highest authority."

'Daoist Master Xue?!'

An image of the man surfaced in Li Zhouwei’s mind. He asked, feigning casualness, "Daoist Master Xue? I don't believe I know his esteemed name..."

Daoist Master Xiang Chun turned to him, an inscrutable look in her eyes. "His surname is Xue, his given name, Yang. He is of Wuguang's Profound Tradition, an orthodox cultivator of Comprehending Profoundity."

"An orthodox cultivator of Comprehending Profoundity..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, deliberately probing, "Is he a figure on the level of Daoist Master Donghua?"

Daoist Master Xiang Chun hadn't expected him to mention Li Jiangqun. She considered it. "It's difficult to compare them that way. Luoxia dares to claim Wuguang's Profound Tradition, propagating its teachings as the master of Comprehending Profoundity in the world. Although the Immortal Mansion never made such a statement back then, its very name carried the air of a profound master, so there is a similarity. However... while Daoist Master Donghua's talent far surpassed his, the Daoist Tradition was in decline at the time... his Dao-Profundity at the time of his premature death was not as great as Xue Yang's is now. I'm afraid they cannot be compared..."

"Immortal Mansion..."

Hearing her words, Li Zhouwei finally had a realization. He had heard of many immortal mansions over the years, but whenever high-level cultivators mentioned the "Immortal Mansion," they were always referring to the Moon Radiance Immortal Abode on Moongaze Lake. It was often called the Moonlight Origin Mansion directly. There had to be a reason. "So that's how it is... It seems Daoist Master Donghua was the inheritor of the Moon Radiance Profound Tradition."

"Correct."

She said wistfully, "An orthodox cultivator of Azure Profoundity, one of the three great profundities."

This woman, having spent time with the Dragon-kin, was privy to much information. She looked up, a chill in her gaze. "In primordial times, the Golden Core positions had many masters, and their titles were specific. Depending on their authority and Daoist Tradition, they were called Divine Monarch, Immortal Lord, True Monarch, Imperial Monarch... Now, order has collapsed, and everyone is called True Monarch. But how many of them actually possess the carefree bearing of a True Monarch... that's hard to say."

Her words stopped abruptly as she raised an eyebrow at him. "Wasn't your Emperor of Wei the Bright Splendor Imperial Monarch? Tuoba Xuantan should also be called an Imperial Monarch. The rest are mostly unworthy of the title; they'd be ashamed to even call themselves that. The Emperor of Qi... he wouldn't even dare!"

A smile touched her lips. "Shi Chang has a guilty conscience! Even if the times create the hero, he was an unqualified one..."

"Thrust into the spotlight by the turn of events, he seized a Golden Core position for himself. Knowing he was sitting on a volcano, he tried to hastily secure Metal Virtue through his revolutionary achievements, but he trusted the wrong people. It led to his death, the destruction of his kingdom, and the slaughter of his entire clan. He was completely outmaneuvered by the masters of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition... The fact that the Dawn Qi can still bear two Intercalary Positions to this day is thanks to his prior contributions!"

Li Zhouwei listened quietly. With his ever-increasing Dao-Profundity, he naturally understood her words, his mind racing like lightning.

'The three divisions of Lesser Yang... Beiyao and Xiyan both have directional components in their names, corresponding to the Bei Shaoyang and Western Lesser Yang of the Daoist arts. But I've never heard of Xiyang Dragon Monarch being the Eastern Lesser Yang—yet his name contains _Xi_ (Dawn)! And Lesser Yang gives birth to Dawn (_Xi_). It's highly probable that this master was assigned to the Dawn Qi position!'

He now understood why the Dawn Qi position, despite being masterless, remained so influential. Xiyang Dragon Monarch, who had obtained one of the remains of the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch, was still active in the world. And from what Xiang Chun had said, there had even been an Intercalary Position holder in the past...

'No wonder,' he thought, 'even without a master, its Fruition Attainment is no different from an occupied position.'

As his thoughts shifted, Xiang Chun paid him no mind and continued nonchalantly, "And then there is the Tianwu True Qi... that master has the prestige of an Imperial Monarch, he simply refuses to acknowledge it himself."

True Monarch Tianwu had always been respected, and Xiang Chun was no exception. She spoke of the other deceased True Monarchs with little courtesy, but she referred to True Monarch Tianwu as "master." Li Zhouwei silently mulled over the details in her words when both he and the suddenly silent Xiang Chun looked up at the same time.

In the distance, a hazy white light was flowing. They could faintly discern a colossal white formation that stretched across the heavens, filling their field of view. An intense aura of divine abilities was slowly spreading, with bolts of lightning and True Fire appearing on the barrier.

They were still a great distance away, but Li Zhouwei's sharp golden eyes could still see streaks of light scattered across the sky, both near and far.

'Quite a few powerful figures have gathered.'

Neither of them rushed forward. Xiang Chun pinched her fingers together, seemingly making a calculation. Li Zhouwei, however, scanned his surroundings. A flash of gold caught his eye, making him frown. "Hm?"

He narrowed his eyes. Within the overlapping, illusory colors, he could see cultivators locked in battle. He subtly activated his Spirit Probe ability. Beside him, Xiang Chun finished her calculations and also turned her attention to the scene. "It's still early," she said softly. "Why don't we go get a piece of the pie first?"

Li Zhouwei's Spirit Probe had already revealed the situation, and he was about to suggest the same. He immediately strode forward on a path of light. The golden radiance ahead expanded rapidly, transforming into a magnificent, multicolored glow—it was the unmistakable formation of Buddhist cultivators, radiating infinite light!

By the time they were closer, Xiang Chun could also see clearly. She gazed at the middle-aged man surrounded by the splendid light and murmured, "Minghuang, do you recognize him?"

Truthfully, Li Zhouwei had never met the man. But the golden clouds stretching endlessly across the sky, holding up a mysterious pass, were well-documented in his family's records. He recognized it—it was the Bright Yang Spiritual Treasure, the Huai River Map!

And beneath the protection of this Spiritual Treasure, a man with an ugly expression was held aloft by a barrier of azure light as hard as metal—it was Si Yuanli.

A brilliant light enveloped the sky where two massive golden forms stood. One had a long face, black eyes, and a pair of horse ears, a terrifying yet familiar sight. It was undoubtedly his old enemy, Taixi.

The other golden form was even larger, pure white, with layers of feathers draping its back. Its Buddhist head had three faces; the two on the sides depicted expressions of weeping and laughter, while the front-facing one was incredibly majestic, its eyes glaring with fury.

The two had kept their distance, so Si Yuanli had not noticed them. He was struggling to hold on under the siege of the two Mahas. Protected by his Spiritual Treasure and clutching several talismans he had just pulled from his storage pouch, he managed to maintain a semblance of composure.

"He has some ties with my family," Li Zhouwei replied.

Daoist Master Xiang Chun commented, "One is a third-generation Taixi, the other a fourth-generation Yanbai. Both are quite powerful, but he's managing to hold out. He shows no sign of compromising; he's a greedy one, too."

Opportunities within the grotto-heaven were plentiful, and no one wanted to waste time. For the stalemate to have lasted this long, it was likely because Si Yuanli refused to give up anything. This was perfect for Li Zhouwei, who was looking for a place to use the blessing of Illuminating Sun and Moon! He raised his halberd and declared, "When it comes to the affairs of Buddhist cultivators, I'm compelled to interfere."

Daoist Master Xiang Chun smiled. "Go on then, fellow Daoist. I'll cover for you. I will give you a warning when the main formation is about to break. If you can't make it back in time, I can't wait."

"Naturally."

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flickered. His Spirit Probe had already uncovered several crucial details. He soared into the air, moving like a streak of light. The Audience with the Celestial Gate immediately materialized in the sky, descending with a booming aura of radiance.

_BOOM!_

Flames of multicolored light surged. The Taixi, who was channeling his power to suppress Si Yuanli, saw his opponent's defenses falter. A sense of triumph filled him. Mahas loved to provoke their enemies, especially high-level Purple Mansion Realm cultivators like this one. He sneered, "Fellow Daoist, you'd best hand some things over! Who else is going to save you? Chi Buzi?! Haha!"

The mocking laughter had barely faded when a sudden chill ran down the Taixi's spine. He looked up, caught completely off guard by a streak of golden light—the Celestial Gate was descending. He was instantly horrified.

'Audience with the Celestial Gate?!'

'It's Li Zhouwei!'

Shock and fury warred within him. He immediately channeled his dharma power, and his body erupted in golden light. A purplish-black spiritual bowl leaped from his chest, soaring up to absorb the torrent of Heavenly Light. Yet, coveting his own treasure, he didn't dare use the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl to directly block the Audience with the Celestial Gate. Instead, he just spat out a blast of golden energy. "Hah!"

Pinned down by the two, Si Yuanli was already in an embarrassing and desperate state, his face pale. He was hesitating over how much of his loot to share, afraid that their strength far surpassed his and that he wouldn't escape without a significant sacrifice. A fire of frustration burned in his heart. Seeing this turn of events, he was overjoyed!

"Fellow Daoist Minghuang! Thank you for your help! I shall reward you handsomely!"

He had once addressed Li Xuanfeng as a peer, but now his tone was much more intimate. Gazing at the Bright Yang radiance descending from the sky, he found the colors exceptionally pleasing. He sighed internally, 'Visiting Moongaze Lake was the right choice! This marriage alliance was a perfect calculation! To think it would actually get Li Zhouwei to intervene!'

The brilliant light in the sky exploded. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light technique struck the golden energy from the Taixi's mouth, shattering it to pieces. But another streak of white energy shot forward, materializing beneath the Audience with the Celestial Gate!

It was the Maha with the snow-white golden body and three faces. The sounds of weeping and laughter rose simultaneously as it raised a bronze seal, channeling a divine ability that shot toward Li Zhouwei's face like a thunderbolt. "Hmph!"

Li Zhouwei activated his Sovereign's Perilous Tread Body Divine Ability and charged forward with his halberd, qilin patterns flaring across his skin. The Buddhist sonic attack that should have pierced his mind was rendered completely ineffective. Only the physical force of the dharma power remained, which was promptly split in two by his weapon, dissipating into golden motes of light that swirled around him resentfully.

The Maha, however, was undaunted. It used an ordinary-looking bronze seal to momentarily block the descending Celestial Gate, all three of its faces contorting in anger. Accustomed to running rampant in the north, it roared,

"Audacious Demon!"

The familiar words echoed in his ears. Li Zhouwei's smile turned cold, his eyes glowing brighter as the sign of a solar eclipse appeared on his brow. The Sovereign's Perilous Tread had already carried him right before the Maha. 

What kind of creature are you!"

Streams of black and gold light erupted, lashing out from the radiance to bind the Yanbai's body, causing its expression to change drastically.

_BOOM!_

The incomparably tough Maha body froze for an instant. Marks from the impacts appeared all over it as the black and gold streams tapped against its form, rapidly climbing its limbs with a harsh, grating sound.

"Such audacity, demon!"

The nearby Taixi's expression shifted. He leaped into the air, filled with regret.

'These cultivators from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm are more stubborn than the last... why did you have to provoke him! What grudge do you have against him... Now he won't back down, and is the White Qilin known for having a good temper?!'

He knew he couldn't delay. He immediately drove the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl to fully suppress Si Yuanli, whose divine ability was starting to wane. A vicious look appeared on his face.

"If you still refuse to yield, fellow Daoist, don't blame us for getting rough!"

But he then realized Si Yuanli had already relaxed his techniques, standing there with a strange expression on his face. "Hm?"

He belatedly turned his gaze and discovered that a man in azure robes had appeared beside him at some unknown point, quiet as a ghost. The man was smiling at him, playfully tossing a small Pristine Water cauldron in his hand. A black pearl at his waist hung heavily, its golden tassels fluttering in the wind.

Seeing the Taixi look over, countless illusions of Pristine Water light materialized in the surroundings. A suffocating divine ability surged forth, locking onto the Taixi and rendering him immobile. The man even broke into a smile, revealing perfectly white, even teeth.

"You recognize me, don't you, fellow Daoist? Hmm?"

# Chapter 982: The Li Fire Palace

'Chi Buzi…'

How could Taixi not recognize him! This man’s movements had been bizarre for years, yet his divine abilities grew ever more exquisite, his cultivation and Dao-Profundity ever deeper... And Pristine Water was one of the preeminent Daos of the current age. How could he not be terrified!

Back then, supported by the great conflict between North and South, Taixi hadn't even dared to defy Zipei. Now, although his own divine abilities had improved, Chi Buzi was no Zipei. More importantly—in this grotto-heaven, there was no way to connect to the Buddhist Land. To fall here was to truly die!

For a moment, a chill washed over Taixi.

'He came after all… Of course… He’s scheming for a Golden Core position. How could he miss such a perfect opportunity! But… but why would he come to save Si Yuanli…'

Taixi had been confident, even daring to use Chi Buzi to mock Si Yuanli, for a very good reason. Whether it was the Si family or Si Yuanli himself, their blades were stained with the blood and resentment of the Chi clan. They had slaughtered countless members of his family…

Even if Chi Buzi was ruthless, detached, and had transcended mortal affairs, his entire clan had been exterminated. It was one thing not to seek revenge, but how could he possibly appear to save his mortal enemy?

Taixi could see it clearly: Si Yuanli himself was terrified!

"So… it is the Great Daoist Master…"

He replied dryly, only to see the man before him smile. The terrifying divine ability and dharma power of the Chou-Gui Hidden Form had already spread out instantly. This divine ability was inextricably linked to his Dao-Profundity, reaching a frightening level. Chi Buzi seemed to make no move at all, yet his hand was already rising, striking Taixi across the face!

_BOOM!_

The light of Pristine Water surged. Taixi’s entire face fractured like a shattered glazed tile, covered in countless cracks. His golden body collapsed like a mountain, tumbling heavily from the clouds and stirring up a violent storm. Only then did the man’s cold words echo through the air:

"You know who I am, yet you just stand there watching!"

Although the palm's power wasn't immense, his opponent had intentionally displayed his Dao-Profundity in the Pristine Water Dao. Taixi's heart hammered as he finally understood.

'This man doesn't want to be stained by a single thread of karma. His heart holds nothing but his Immortal Dao!'

The Maha's sleeve shook, scattering several streaks of white light toward Chi Buzi. Simultaneously, Taixi channeled his dharma winds at full power, transforming into a streak of golden light and fleeing with insane speed.

Chi Buzi paid him no mind. He casually lifted his sleeve, gathered the few treasures into his robes, and began to inspect them at his leisure.

Radiant Pass and the brilliant light in the sky had long since fled. Si Yuanli stood rooted to the spot, feeling as though he couldn't breathe.

If he had been mostly indignant, though unnerved, when the two Maha first besieged him, his mood had shifted drastically when Li Zhouwei appeared. Now, however, he had plunged back into an abyss of anxiety. His heart was filled with nothing but terror and ice.

What if Chi Buzi was here for revenge? He didn't even need to _actively_ seek it. Just passing by with a casual thought would be enough! This was a grotto-heaven, a place without even a connection to the Great Void! While Si Yuanli had used his inheritance to learn the entry and exit points… could he truly last that long?

He wasn't Li Zhouwei, who had been at a safe distance and could retreat calmly. Chi Buzi was right in front of him! Who knew if the Chou-Gui Hidden Form already had a Spiritual Sword aimed at his back, ready to strike at any moment?

For a time, he knew neither to offer thanks nor to turn and flee. Si Yuanli could only silently retract his Spiritual Treasure, hiding it in his sleeve. He appeared to be bowing in deference, but in reality, he was braced to strike. Only then did Chi Buzi turn his head.

Strangely, the eyes of this prodigy of the Chi family held not a trace of hatred. There wasn't even a single negative emotion. They were utterly clear, watching him with a warm smile.

"Yuanli… I didn't expect you to have achieved a divine ability too!"

Si Yuanli secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He wisely avoided mentioning any sect affairs and mirrored the smile.

"It is only because the old Daoist Master's methods are profound, allowing even a mediocre talent like myself to one day achieve a divine ability."

"Good, good, good…"

Chi Buzi seemed exceptionally polite, as if the Chi family truly had nothing to do with him. He smiled.

"You've lived up to expectations… The sect is fortunate to have you!"

Si Yuanli's heart pounded as he heard this, unsure if it was courtesy or sarcasm. He gave an awkward reply. But Chi Buzi took a step forward, his smiling gaze fixed on him.

"Yuanli wouldn't _not_ recognize me, would you?"

Si Yuanli froze. A chill ran down his spine. The words were almost identical to those spoken to Taixi. He still found it hard to believe. He met the Great Daoist Master's gaze, and the hand clutching his sleeve trembled. He couldn't bring himself to take out the items, hoping against hope that the man was joking.

"Of course…" he answered nervously.

Chi Buzi's smile widened.

"You know who I am, yet you just stand there watching!"

Si Yuanli’s eyes snapped open. Only then did he discover that roiling Pristine Water had completely surrounded the area. Despite his extreme reluctance, suppressing his rage and hatred, he could only shake the white lights from his sleeve. Bitterness filled his heart.

'…So it was a disaster after all!'

Chi Buzi received the items with a casual hand. He glanced at them and shook his head.

"You really are a greedy one. You weren't willing to give those two high monks a single share. No wonder they refused to let you go and dragged things out here for so long…"

"I remember… the Sima Family has people in Wanling Heaven, correct? I wonder which peak they cultivate on, and how capable they are."

His expression was composed as he asked casually:

"What good things did they leave behind that were worth all this trouble for you?"

Si Yuanli felt a deep sense of humiliation but had no choice other than to lower his head. In this grotto-heaven, cut off from the Great Void and suppressed by Dharma Treasures, a Great Daoist Master's power was on another level entirely. He could only say respectfully:

"My ancestor… Sima Duan, sought the Dao in Wanling Heaven. He studied under Immutable Peak and received its Dao Lineage. He once authored a book… Here in the Echoing Void Palace, there is a Spiritual Treasure of the Horn Wood Dao, called Spring's Few Branches… It is right here."

"Oh?"

Chi Buzi scanned his face with a scrutinizing gaze. Without bothering to examine the lights in his hand, he simply stepped onto the Pristine Water and ascended into the air, leaving Si Yuanli to straighten up, his face burning with shame.

---

"Daoist Friend Minghuang!"

Li Zhouwei arrived on a streak of light. Xiang Chun was just flying up from the mountains, guiding him closer.

"It's almost time," she whispered.

Li Zhouwei, however, was still pondering the matter of Chi Buzi.

'He may have forgotten what happened back then, but surely he hasn't forgotten the incident in the Eastern Sea? With so many Golden Cores outside, he too must tread carefully.'

The Li family naturally held deep suspicions about Chi Buzi. His attempt to spy on the immortal artifact back then was bad enough. Later, he had returned to the Eastern Sea and said some truly terrifying things. Whether he was being arrogant or it was the truth, it was a matter that could never be spoken of again… But as for whether he was still the original Chi Buzi… perhaps not even Chi Buzi himself knew.

He could only suppress these thoughts, return Xiang Chun's courtesy, and reply, "I saw that Daoist Master Chi Buzi has also arrived. I fear something major is about to happen here."

"Chi Buzi…"

Xiang Chun frowned. "He has thrown in his lot with the Viewing Pavilion faction now. He’s quite brazen, daring to show his face. I don't know what the Exalted Ones are thinking!"

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully, acknowledging her words as they moved closer to the great formation. As he walked, he silently activated an ability. The power of his Spirit Probe began to operate.

Just as he'd thought, even a great formation like this, linked to the Profound Foundation and guarding the grotto-heaven's core secrets, could not hide from his Spirit Probe.

But the instant he passed through the formation, his vision was flooded with infinite golden light. There was nothing else. Just this overlapping, blinding radiance, so dense it was like staring directly into the Supreme Yang. It almost caused an adverse reaction in his true body!

'This is…'

The intense light instantly contracted. Only then, through a hazy mist, did he see ninety-nine segments of golden light, coiling in the air. Even though he wasn't facing it directly, it still filled him with an immense sense of suffocation.

"A Golden Core Dharma Treasure!"

He narrowed his eyes slightly, quickly averting his gaze from the object. He stopped looking at the highest treasure hall and instead swept his gaze over the many magnificent immortal palaces along the mountainside. His eyes passed over the two Wanling Flower Trees planted at the mountain's base, and four Daoist pagodas came into view, each suppressing a Spiritual Treasure that now appeared in his mind.

"There really are Spiritual Treasures!"

This wasn't surprising. There were traces of Spiritual Treasures outside the formation; there were bound to be more within. He carefully examined the four Spiritual Treasures. The Merging Fire item was a pot, the Gathering Wood item was a ruler, the Water Mansion item was a pearl, and the Treasured Earth item was a seal. They were clearly a matched set.

'Never mind the others, but Wei Xuanyin and Chi Buzi are both here… There are probably even more Great Daoist Masters, perhaps even seventh or eighth-life Maha. All their eyes are fixed on this place. It won't be easy.'

But his mind was already working. He didn't linger on the four pagodas. On the surface, he appeared to be closing his eyes to focus, but his Spirit Probe was operating at full capacity, searching palace by palace.

Some of these palaces were in disarray, others completely empty. Clearly, some of their masters were still in the grotto-heaven, while others had left long before it was sealed. Two even showed signs of cultivators who had passed away in meditation, with Purple Mansion Realm resources scattered on the floor.

"Nearly forty percent are empty. When these ancestor-level figures leave, they often take their disciples with them… This means the Wanling Heaven currently being plundered by cultivators… is only at sixty percent of its peak…"

But even with forty percent empty, the sheer abundance of spiritual items and resources left him speechless. He silently calculated on his fingers.

"Two, four, six…"

There were six more Spiritual Treasures scattered among these surrounding immortal palaces!

'Added to the four in the center… that's ten Spiritual Treasures… Ten whole Spiritual Treasures! And there are even two Spiritual Artifacts that have clearly degraded due to a shift in their Fruition Attainment. They look damaged…'

'Even the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition… might not have this much!'

The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition had been the hegemon of Jiangnan for a very long time. The six branches of Chongming certainly had more than ten Spiritual Treasures, but this was only _sixty percent_ of Wanling Heaven… and that didn't even count the Spiritual Treasures outside the formation…

Li Zhouwei had no time for awe. His gaze swept rapidly through the immortal palaces.

'The moment this opens, the Great Daoist Masters will definitely rush for the obvious Spiritual Treasures under the pagodas. That will be the best time to snatch one of the scattered ones…'

Although he was confident in his Body Divine Ability, in such a chaotic situation, speed and decisiveness were paramount. He scanned carefully, and his gaze finally settled on the second palace on the far southern edge.

This palace was entirely crimson. Before it stood four arches, all of deep-red lacquer with profound patterns, featuring ornate brackets and crimson railings. Statues of fire-stepping birds stood guard, radiating a majestic aura—this was clearly a palace of Li Fire!

'Wanling Heaven is full of Merging Fire… a Li Fire palace is incredibly rare!'

Under his detailed scan, he saw that this palace enshrined a Spiritual Treasure. The left-side hall even contained a Spiritual Artifact, and the right-side hall held Li Fire spiritual materials and cultivation manuals. It was an extremely complete set. Perhaps this grotto-heaven didn't value Li Fire, and the master of this palace was the only one with deep cultivation in it, allowing all the good things to fall into his hands. Setting aside the Spiritual Treasure, the value of its contents was undoubtedly among the top one or two of all the mountainside palaces, perhaps even rivaling those near the central pagodas!

He silently memorized its location and began to reassess.

It wasn't that there were no Bright Yang palaces in the mountain, but they only contained Spiritual Artifacts. Although the quality of those artifacts was high, they were still a grade below a Spiritual Treasure. Moreover, the Li family already had enough Bright Yang items. Taking more wasn't just a matter of redundant utility.

'When I fall one day… the clan will need something other than Bright Yang to rely on. I must prepare for this early…'

His gaze traveled down the mountain, pausing for a moment on the plaque that read "I Command the Laws of Heaven," before finally landing on the endless field of bones at the mountain's foot.

A headless corpse wearing a feathered crane-cloak and draped in scriptures stood silently, holding a Spiritual Treasure in its hand! But the Spiritual Treasure was not the most eye-catching thing about it. What forced one to look away was the terrifying Sword Intent radiating from the corpse itself!

'What incredible Way of the Sword…'

His heart shook. He prudently severed the Spirit Probe connection at once, but his eyes still stung. He glanced silently at Xiang Chun, who was busy with her calculations, and exhaled without drawing attention.

"This sealing and absorbing power is growing stronger. I wonder what kind of marvel it is."

He wasn't wrong. The closer they got to the Dharma Treasure, the stronger this sealing and absorbing force became. His Body Divine Ability was formidable, so it didn't affect him much, but Purple Mansion Realm cultivators without one would likely be in trouble.

"If it's like this out here, I can't imagine how terrifying it will be inside the formation."

His concern was clear. Xiang Chun paused her calculations and replied:

"Wanling Heaven possesses a Dharma Treasure left by the ancient True Monarch Chongyuan, called the Lingyang Immutable Palace. It has the ability to seal and absorb. This is just its power leaking out."

"As for your worry… the sealing power here has actually weakened considerably. If we had come here right after entering the grotto-heaven, we might have been immobilized. Several True Monarchs are currently lifting the Dharma Treasure into the Great Void. How else could this formation be opened? It looks like we are opening the formation, but really, we're just waiting for good news from outside."

"I see."

Li Zhouwei said in a low voice, "I wonder what kind of Dharma Treasure it is, to require several Exalted Ones to move it."

This touched on Xiang Chun's own doubts. She nodded in agreement.

"They must have some concern…"

She was pondering this when her expression suddenly changed. "There's movement!" she whispered.

Li Zhouwei looked up. Sure enough, the vast white light barrier spanning the heavens was fading, bit by bit. A commotion erupted all around them. Divine abilities flared, and the great rumbling grew louder and more intense.

_BOOM!_

In the blink of an eye, the white light in the sky shattered, scattering like a roiling white wind. In that instant, countless streaks of multicolored light appeared. True Fire and spiritual water erupted in the sky as everyone made their move!

"The formation is broken!"

Blinding multicolored lights fell like a meteor shower, trailing long tails of flame as they flew into the depths. Some paused to observe the situation before changing direction; others casually scattered water and fire to interfere with their rivals. But the major powers, like Golden Feather and Viewing Pavilion, had clear targets, flying straight for the mountain's summit!

Sovereign's Perilous Tread!

Li Zhouwei was already braced to act. His Body Divine Ability flared to its absolute limit, golden patterns flashing on his face. He became a streaking comet, smashing through all the water, fire, and golden light blocking his path, heading straight for the mountainside!




# Chapter 983: The Fire Rite

_Clang..._

Intense multicolored light rippled through the air. A man in golden robes, his expression darkening slightly, streaked forward. Beside him was a middle-aged man with broad shoulders, thick brows, and the deep gaze of one wearing a flame-patterned Daoist robe.

"The Tri-Aspect Heart Vessel should be beneath the Merging Fire Pagoda!"

"Indeed."

Daoist Master Tianhuo nodded, feigning contemplation, but his eyes held little greed. He watched the curtain of light descend, his heart sinking.

'The Dharma Treasure is the Lingyang Immutable Palace... so where is the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book?'

The two transformed into streaks of light and sped away. Though they spoke of the Tri-Aspect Heart Vessel, they didn't head for the four Dao pagodas. Instead, they drifted gracefully toward the palace complex beside them.

The Golden Feather Sect's contingent had reaped great rewards in this Grotto-Heaven. Their true strength far exceeded what Daoist Master Tianhuo and Tianque showed on the surface. Wanling Heaven was of great concern to the True Monarch—so much so that his father, Zhang Yige, who had presided over the Grotto-Heaven for countless years, had left his post for the first time to come here personally!

True Monarch Taiyuan was no mere Taiqing. A Grotto-Heaven was a world unto itself. The two Dao Paths of Golden Oneness and Highest Azure had always maintained an orderly transmission. The Golden Feather Sect would send talented individuals to the Grotto-Heaven, and the direct lineage from the Grotto-Heaven would in turn enter the sect to gain experience. Once they showed potential to attain the Golden Core, they would return to the Grotto-Heaven to advance their cultivation. If they perished, they perished within the Grotto-Heaven; they rarely ventured into the outside world.

Now that he had personally made a move, Daoist Master Tianhuo naturally felt at ease and moved aside, listening to Tianque's grim voice.

"The Dual-Radiance Fire Instrument is somewhere in this Grotto-Heaven, most likely hidden in these mountains by Lu Fang. Of all the items here, only this one is truly compatible with our Daoist Tradition. The rest are all items of Merging Fire. Many of them have spirit-wounding properties, forcing one to cultivate an additional Encompassing Profoundity technique for protection. It's quite inconvenient."

Tianque flicked his sleeve, pushing open the palace hall's doors. He scanned the interior and said in a low voice:

"He may have enjoyed a moment of fame, but he left no Daoist Tradition behind. This mountain isn't small, and the suppression from the Dharma Treasure is even greater. It's hard to say which palace it's in. We've only searched the perimeter, but it's nine-tenths likely to be near the Dao pagodas."

He raised his head, his gaze sweeping toward the hall's entrance as he spoke in a deep, commanding voice:

"The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition is here. This hall now belongs to our Dao. Fellow Daoist, please seek your fortune elsewhere!"

A faint gust of wind blew past, and then all was silent. Tianque turned back.

"A Daoist Master from the Lin Clan."

These two Daoist Masters were of noble birth and possessed profound methods. In just a few moments, they had seen through the hall's layout, scraped it clean of all valuables, and moved to retrieve a bowl-shaped Spiritual Artifact enshrined on a dais.

The Spiritual Artifact was covered by a white light barrier, one that clearly required a specific legacy to unlock. Tianque immediately took out a talisman and began to silently activate it. Daoist Master Tianhuo, standing guard, whispered:

"Is that Lin Hengjiang down on the mountain?"

His pupils dilated slightly, revealing a complex, horrified expression. Hearing that name, Tianque also felt a wave of emotion and replied:

"A plush crane-feather cape, his body draped in scriptures... It must be him. The Sword Immortal Huaijiang of the Wanling Upper Sect. Only he would be capable of such a brutal act!"

"No wonder!"

Daoist Master Tianhuo's expression turned grim. He watched the formation shatter and the item fall into his companion's hands. They immediately darted out, showing no joy on their faces. Instead, he said:

"I was wondering why no one had gone down to retrieve his sword. After all, given what happened with Daoist Master Donghua, the 'Hongjiang' is probably no less terrifying than the 'Bili'..."

"Lin Hengjiang's hatred was as deep as the Yellow Springs and as vast as the Eastern Sea. And he took his own life. Before falling, he must have poured every last shred of his divine ability, dharma power, and Sword Intent into that sword. It's frightening to even imagine!"

He withdrew his gaze and looked up at the sky. An intense light was rising from the west—a pale white mixed with hazy, faint yellow specks, all interwoven. A massive eye, formed of divine ability, materialized in the clouds and cast down a thousand beams of light!

Tianque frowned.

"It's the Lord of the White Victory Dao."

Daoist Master Tianhuo nodded, his eyes reflecting the brilliant lights in the sky. A cold, furious roar, loud enough to shake the heavens, suddenly echoed from within the mountain range:

"Zhang Yige?! How dare you!"

...

'Zhang Yige? Sounds like someone from the Golden Feather Sect...'

The thunderous voice echoed from the sky, but Li Zhouwei had no time to dwell on it. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd in his hand was already glowing with maximum brilliance as he struck the barrier of Li Fire before him once again!

_BOOM!_

The intense Li Fire colors exploded outward. The radiance covering the palace's surface instantly faded, revealing a Profound Palace, crimson from top to bottom. The multicolored light streaking across the sky immediately brightened, like flies sensing blood, and eagerly changed direction to descend upon this spot.

Li Zhouwei sneered. A light had already been brewing between his brows. His Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light shot out, slamming into one of the turning streaks of multicolored light with a blinding explosion. His own figure didn't slow in the slightest as he plunged downward.

In front of the palace stood four archways, adorned with profound patterns and red lacquer, their intricate brackets and illusory colors intertwining. The surging Li Fire failed to impede him in the slightest, and in an instant, he landed before the hall.

The great hall had vermilion railings and colorful thresholds. Statues of Fire-Treading Birds stood before the doors, and both sides blazed with flames. Twelve Li Fire lamp pedestals were lined up in a row, beginning with the Long-March Pheasant Flame and ending with the Red Apricot Li Fire. The various colors mingled and flickered, creating a truly majestic and imposing sight.

The moment the golden-eyed man stepped into the hall, a colossal celestial gate, wreathed in colorful clouds and Heavenly Light, rose in the sky. It descended heavily, suppressing the central archway with a deafening crash. The Heavenly Light shone down, forcing back the opportunistic streaks of multicolored light one by one, and slamming into the cultivator who had rushed to the front!

_BOOM!_

Cultivation battles were often decided by seizing the initiative. Li Zhouwei had taken the first step, and he would maintain his lead. He decisively suppressed the man, giving no one a chance to surround him with divine ability. His Audience with the Celestial Gate immediately dispersed.

Li Zhouwei transformed into light and stepped inside. The interior was a dazzling, brilliant crimson. The dark red architecture was carved with golden profound patterns. He immediately crossed an arched bridge spanning a large pool of Li Fire, passed through the main hall, and, as expected, found a dark red immortal's throne.

A searing wave of Li Fire qi washed over him. Behind the throne was a massive screen, painted with a scene of rising Li Fire and circling birds. In the very center was a complex formation diagram depicting a toppled profound pillar.

Sounds were already coming from the surrounding side halls. Li Zhouwei pretended to scan the room with his golden eyes, but he didn't hesitate for a second. He raised a hand, unhooked the Radiant Sun King's Halberd from his waist, spun the Spiritual Artifact once in his grasp, and then gripped it tightly as he chopped down!

Simultaneously, the Profound Bracelet on his wrist vanished. Golden light flashed from thin air, fishing a streak of white light out of the churning Li Fire—directly beneath the path of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd!

_BOOM!_

An intense Heavenly Light exploded. All the Li Fire in the hall swayed, and the central pool of Li Fire emitted a dull rumble. The white light flickered, attempting to escape, but it was locked in place, unable to move, as if it might turn intangible again at any moment.

_BOOM!_

Golden patterns instantly covered his face. His Sovereign's Perilous Tread flared to its absolute limit. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd leaped, letting out an excited cry as it slammed down once more!

All the palace formations on this mountain were extensions of the surrounding grand formation. Now, a True Monarch had taken action, seizing Dharma Treasures, and even the grand formation itself was shattering and dissipating. The Grotto-Heaven's Profound Foundation was clearly compromised. As time went on, all protections and formations would inevitably vanish. Yet, even with this remnant power, the white light continued to flicker within the Li Fire, merely wavering uncertainly.

Li Zhouwei raised his halberd a third time, his eyes blazing gold, his divine ability burning. He was now using his full strength. The instant he swung the Spiritual Artifact, a world-shattering sound erupted. The great hall seemed to wail as brilliant golden light flooded the space, and the white light finally shattered into pieces!

'The formations here are decaying even faster than I thought!'

The Profound Bracelet reappeared on his wrist, as if the previous moment had been an illusion. The young man let out a slight breath of relief, quickly regulated his breathing, and stepped into the fire to see the object:

It was no bigger than his palm, perfectly round like a Golden Core, but wreathed in five rings of golden, colorful light. Countless sesame-sized spiritual fire-birds—all manner of fiery, spiritual birds—circled it. Yet, upon a closer look, it was only swirling flames, resembling nothing more than a jade ornament.

But the moment it entered his sight, Li Zhouwei raised his hand, not in haste. His Spirit Probe had already sensed it—there was still divine ability and dharma power on the Spiritual Treasure!

_Vmmm!_

Sure enough, his grasping hand closed on empty air. A surge of divine ability pulsed, hot and ethereal. The object had already vanished, having apparently activated some profound mystery to escape!

'Either the Spiritual Treasure's original owner stored their divine ability inside it, or the Spiritual Treasure itself has the wondrous ability to store and absorb dharma power!'

Li Zhouwei wasn't anxious; instead, a look of delight crossed his face.

'As long as this grand formation can be broken, this item is as good as mine!'

His gaze swept out, his golden eyes instantly locating the item within the roiling Li Fire. He stepped forward, not rushing, but instead unleashing a golden light from between his brows. It struck an empty spot, knocking a streak of black light out of the air!

The light solidified into a man dressed in robes of mixed white and purple with long, hanging sleeves. Below, he wore a crimson skirt and jade boots. A flat jade ornament was pinned horizontally in his bound hair, swaying slightly. He watched with cold eyes. Li Zhouwei's gaze swept over him, and he understood immediately.

'He came from the side hall... Two divine abilitys...'

Li Zhouwei knew what was in the side halls. The cultivation methods and spiritual items within were also protected by formations. Even if one had come straight for this palace, it was impossible to break those formations and arrive here so quickly. This man had, nine times out of ten, abandoned the treasures in the side hall to rush here!

On the other side, the Li Fire surged, and the round, Golden Core-like Spiritual Treasure reappeared. A man was already chasing it from behind, his hand outstretched. But the Spiritual Treasure suddenly pulsed, shining with blinding light!

This Purple Mansion Realm cultivator didn't understand the situation. He just thought he'd been blessed by great fortune—he entered the hall just as the Spiritual Treasure teleported to his location. Overjoyed, how could he have been on guard? Now, the divine ability within the Spiritual Treasure activated. A pillar of Li Fire, so dense it was almost physical, blazing with red and gold, erupted from it. Only then did the man belatedly try to activate his own divine ability.

_Bang!_

Li Fire exploded all over his body, blasting him backward. He was nearly thrown out of the great hall. But his divine ability flared; despite his cultivation being only at the initial Purple Mansion Realm, he had some skill. He managed to force himself upright within the Spiritual Treasure's radiance and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him sideways. His golden pupils flashed as he observed the man carefully, coming to a conclusion:

'Whole Pill... His divine ability is a bit like Wan'er's. He's probably not skilled in combat!'

His figure immediately blurred.

"Watch out!"

The man in the long-sleeved white robes and crimson skirt sent an urgent divine ability-laced telepathic warning. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the pillar of light was scared witless. Only then did he faintly perceive a bright halberd within the crimson light, almost upon his face!

_Clang!_

A round jade shield materialized. The halberd's crescent blade struck it, sending sparks flying and shaking his divine ability. He was terrified before the fight even began, but he couldn't bear to give up the Spiritual Treasure. He could only try to stall for time. "I am Xiangli Zhuyun... My clan brother meant no offense... This Spiritual Treasure is crucial. We are willing to compensate you with other items..."

The only answer he received was his own jade shield being forced back step by step. Intense Bright Yang radiance scattered in all directions. A cold laugh was faintly heard.

"So, you are together."

Before the words had even faded, the halberd's bright, illusory form leaped up from behind the shield. The crescent blade flipped, clamping down on the round shield. The man's heart seized. He squeezed his eyes shut and spat out a mouthful of Cinnabar!

The Cinnabar scattered, instantly pushing back the golden light and allowing him to escape the immediate danger. Fury rose in his eyes. Seeing his opponent charge straight at him, he frantically activated his divine ability and shouted:

"I'll hold him off! Get the item!"

Just then, the round, Golden Core-like Spiritual Treasure in the air seemed to be stimulated. It glowed brightly again, scattering down layers of a wondrous, illusionary mist of Li Fire. In an instant, it shrouded the entire hall. A powerful, baleful fire washed over him, and his heart leaped with joy.

'Heaven is helping me!'

His judgment wasn't poor. He could see that the Spiritual Treasure still held a divine ability and possessed the power of teleportation. But a Spiritual Treasure was not a cultivator. Once it began to cast a large-scale spell art, it couldn't simultaneously use its teleportation mystery. It would be unable to evade a cultivator's grasp!

And the Li Fire mist it released would also obstruct Li Zhouwei!

'Fortune truly is on my side!'

But his thought had barely settled. He had just relaxed his divine ability when the red mist in front of him was torn open, revealing a gleaming halberd blade!

It was right in front of him. Unavoidable.

"Ah?!"

_BOOM!_

A violent explosion echoed through the Li Fire mist. Spiritual sense was already blocked in this place. The other man—the one in the long-sleeved white robes and crimson skirt—couldn't even see his surroundings, but he knew this was the perfect opportunity!

He ignored the sound, bit his finger, and pressed the blood to his brow. His vision instantly cleared, allowing him to spot the round Spiritual Treasure. He immediately leaped into the air, straining.

But a large hand had already pierced through the Li Fire mist. Seizing the moment the Spiritual Treasure was releasing its mystery and couldn't escape, the hand grabbed it fiercely!

_Thud!_

The suppressive power of Audience with the Celestial Gate and the divine might of Sovereign's Perilous Tread operated in unison, finally locking the Li Fire Spiritual Treasure in place. The item was not without a master, after all, and still refused to submit. It began to struggle wildly.

The undissipated divine ability pulsed on the Spiritual Treasure's surface, seeping through his fingers like flames of Li Fire. It trembled violently, but its chance to escape was gone!

Scalding dharma power blasted his palm, burning his fingers white, but Li Zhouwei's expression didn't change one bit from the pain. His heart was finally overcome with joy:

'A Li Fire Spiritual Treasure! It's mine!'

"You!"

As Li Zhouwei's hand tightened, the Li Fire mist in the hall instantly dissipated. The man's pupils shrank in shock. He saw his clan brother clutching a hole in his chest, vomiting blood. Pulses of golden light were erupting from the wound. The injured man gritted his teeth, blood in his mouth, and choked out:

"Go!"

Now that the item was in Li Zhouwei's hands, the two of them could never get it back. Whether they could win a fight or not, there was no point in fighting. They wisely abandoned the hall and fled elsewhere.

Li Zhouwei didn't spare a single glance for the two Northern Barbarians. His golden eyes turned, his gaze landing like a beam of light on the side hall.

Li Fire roiled within that hall. Even for such a grand immortal palace, without the protection of its formations, it couldn't withstand the high-intensity battle between Purple Mansion Realm experts. Churning Li Fire poured out from the golden patterns, flowing across the floor.

In the middle of a thick set of shelves stood a jade dais. On it rested a splendid, deep-red jade slip, flanked by two jade boxes, all of which radiated a powerful Li Fire glow.

And in that hall, two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were locked in a fierce battle. Converging Water and Heavenly Light intertwined. One, dressed in flowing blue robes, appeared younger. The other was older, wearing yellow robes and a jade pendant at his waist. They were fighting inextricably.

When the two saw him, they clearly recognized him on sight. Both their expressions changed at once!

A trace of surprise finally flickered in Li Zhouwei's eyes.

This yellow-robed Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was also practicing the Bright Yang! Even the divine ability fluctuations coming from him felt familiar... they shared several similarities with the aura of his own Sovereign's Perilous Tread.

'This seems to be the Cui Clan's methodology... It's likely a lineage from Chongzhou Island!'

There were only a few factions in the world that cultivated the Bright Yang. The identity of the man before him was obvious. Li Zhouwei stared at him, the golden patterns on his face growing brighter. He pointed his halberd, stepped through the roiling Li Fire, and smiled, his meaning unclear.

'So, it's Daoist Master Yangya!'




# Chapter 984: The Oath of Xixiao

The arrival of Li Zhouwei, riding a current of brilliant light, gave both men a profound shock.

‘It’s… the old imperial family…’

The heart of the yellow-robed Daoist Master instantly tightened with a complex mix of emotions. A single glance at those golden eyes and the shimmering golden patterns on the man’s neck left a bitter taste in his mouth. He was utterly at a loss for how to react.

The bright Spiritual Artifact in his hand dimmed slightly. He remained silent, making no unnecessary movements as he took a step back. As intricate feelings flooded his mind, an unexpected wave of fear washed over him.

‘Bright Yang is a tyrannical path. By forcing Cui Jueyin back to the island… I’ve already violated the Oath of Xixiao! I’ve also offended him deeply, an insult of the highest order. It would have been better if we had never crossed paths, but now that we have…’

Cui Yushan hailed from the West Curtain Sea. His ancestors had migrated from the Eastern Sea when Li Xuan was restoring the empire. Whether it was because the Cui clan’s branches had grown distant from the main lineage and were unwilling to bear the karma of a hundred generations, or because it was a measure for the Chongzhou’s Cui clan to preserve its bloodline, his branch of the West Curtain Sea Cui had unequivocally severed its ties with the Li clan, seeking to cut away the karmic debts of the past.

He believed he had done nothing wrong in this matter, but in the eyes of an imperial descendant, such distinctions of right and wrong were meaningless.

His heart leaped into his throat. The Heavenly Light beneath his feet flickered, and his divine ability seemed to shrink in the presence of the man before him. He felt an overwhelming urge to turn and flee.

Just then, the blue-robed Daoist Master frowned, his own heart lurching in suspicion.

‘It’s Li Zhouwei!’

This Daoist Master came from Mount Qusi in the Southern Sea, a sect that had been one and the same with Daoist Master Xuanyi's Mount Jingyi several hundred years ago. They were still considered brethren, maintaining close ties. He actually recognized Li Zhouwei of Moongaze—Xuanyi himself had told him:

‘A conflict with Wei-Li… would be most unwise…’

He sighed inwardly.

‘Although Xuanyi claims to be on good terms with some Daoist Master Zhaojing, there’s no proof. It’s a difficult situation to explain. But the bond between the Cui and the Li is known to all the world. He will certainly side with Yangya… It’s best to avoid any misunderstanding!’

And so, without a single word of explanation or a moment wasted, he said nothing, summoned a current of light, and dissolved into a gust of dharma power, vanishing from the scene.

The scene was thick with irony. Both Li Zhouwei and Yangya understood precisely why the man had retreated so readily, leaving Yangya in an awkward position, unsure whether to advance or withdraw.

According to protocol, as a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Cui family who had received the Wei Empire’s Daoist Tradition, he should have bent the knee upon seeing the White Qilin and addressed him as ‘Your Excellency’—even ‘Your Highness’ or ‘My Lord’ would not have been out of place.

‘Inside this grotto-heaven, all the lords are watching. If I say those words… it would be tantamount to forcing the West Curtain Sea Cui, and even the entire Chongzhou, to choose a side!’

But if he didn’t say them, how could Yangya possibly feel at ease?

How did the Cui clan rise to power? In the beginning, they were merely a noble family in the mountains, one of the six great clans of Guanlong, no different from the Lin or the Qi. It was the harmonious bond between the Wei Emperor and the Cui ancestor, Cui Yan, who swore an oath upon Mount Xixiao to build a great enterprise, that led to their later glory.

At that time, the Wei Emperor had promised:

For as long as the Wei Dynasty stands, you shall be the master of the High Radiance.

And Cui Yan had replied:

Bathed in your magnanimous grace, I, your humble servant, shall assist the celestial branch. Should any of my kin or descendants fail in their duties and dare to oppress the common people… may the radiance strike them down.

Later, one became the Bright Yang Imperial Monarch, and the other, the High Radiance True Monarch. The oath was fulfilled. Throughout the entire Wei Dynasty, the Cui clan enjoyed boundless spiritual fortune, achieving the status of celestial nobility and even becoming the foremost family in the land. At the Celestial Dynasty’s peak, just before its fall, Cui Mu was even able to assume the false station of a True Monarch through the dynasty’s laws. What an incredible honor that was.

Reading that period of history, every descendant of the Cui clan would be shaken beyond words. Even though the history that followed was filled with endless blood and tears, the Cui family had experienced true glory. When future generations asked about their past, they could answer with pride:

"I am kin to a True Monarch's clan."

The history of Wei-Li was both the source of the Cui family's suffering and its brightest, most prideful legacy. Cui Yushan was no exception; he remembered it with particular clarity. Even as one of the staunchest advocates for severing ties with the Li, in his youth, he too had dreamed in the dead of night of the Imperial Monarch’s return to the world, of the realm once again having a sovereign father.

Yangya could even understand why his predecessors had thrown themselves, one after another, into the cause of restoring the Wei Empire.

‘The Qi Emperor shattered our nation and burned its records three times. Aside from what our Chongzhou Cui clan managed to preserve overseas… everything else has been ground to dust. Few people remember the Oath of Xixiao now… but…’

‘But while everyone else in the world might forget the oath sworn by those two great figures back then, there is one thing that surely remembers it with perfect clarity.’

‘The Bright Yang Fruition Attainment!’

Just as Cui Yan had sworn—may the radiance strike them down—it was a pact between an Imperial Monarch and a True Monarch. Without this radiance hanging over their heads, no matter how virtuous the Cui family's traditions were, they could never have produced generation after generation of loyal and respectful members, each willing to forget life and death for the sake of the people.

The Oath of Xixiao no longer held much binding power, but it remained a glimmer of hope for the Cui family. Those who cultivated other Daoist Traditions might have it easier, but he, Yangya, cultivated the Bright Yang path. Though he might laughingly dismiss the oath as meaningless on a normal day, faced with the White Qilin now, he couldn't help but hesitate.

‘Who knows if he carries the attention of Bright Yang? Who knows what aspect of Bright Yang he represents?’

Caught in this web of conflict, he could only stand rigidly to the side, not daring to leave nor daring to speak. He bowed slightly, standing as still as a statue, waiting in silence.

Li Zhouwei, however, had no time for him. Acting as if he were alone, he untied the Radiant Sun King's Halberd from his waist and set to work on the array formation. As time passed, the white light enveloping the area grew visibly weaker, decaying at an astonishing rate. A single strike from the halberd shattered the light completely.

He flicked his sleeves, sweeping up everything on the platform in a whirlwind. A quick scan of his spiritual sense told him that the side hall had already been looted. He spared a glance at Yangya, who stood by, bowing in attendance, and then, without a word, stepped onto a beam of light and departed.

This simple act felt like salvation. A cold sweat broke out on Yangya’s back, followed by a sudden sense of relief. He hastily summoned a gust of wind and took to the air. The panic in his heart dissipated, leaving only a hollow aftershock of fear and a tangled mess of emotions. Without looking back, he flew into the distance, a sense of confusion overwhelming him.

‘Can my Cui clan truly escape this… Does any of it still have meaning? If every appearance of the Wei-Li requires a Cui to be sacrificed, will my turn be today?’

‘But if I stay out of it… does that mean… the sacrifices of my ancestors were all for nothing…’

His heart was a sea of boundless confusion as he fled in disarray, soaring through the vast, empty sky. A chill ran through him, and a doubt began to form:

"Is this a curse passed down from one generation to the next, or a temptation that repeats time and again? Did my Cui ancestors forget life and death generation after generation out of loyalty, or because each one of them wanted to be the protagonist of the Oath of Xixiao?"

---

"Clang!"

A roiling storm of True Fire churned through the mountains, sweeping through a verdant palace. A cultivator in golden robes stood quietly within the hall. The swirling True Fire brushed past his sleeves and crashed into the grand hall with a deafening roar.

The golden-robed man drew back his sleeve. On the other side, a Daoist Master, scorched by the flames, took a slight step back, his expression grim. He summoned True Qi of water and fire to block the flames while lowering his gaze.

"Fellow Daoist Shilou, you are being far too discourteous!" he said in a low voice.

Shilou Yingge’s face was impassive. The divine ability in his hands showed no courtesy whatsoever, bathing him in a light that made him resemble a True Fire crucible. The light radiated outwards, transforming into a thousand streams that shot toward the man before him. "Daoist Master Lin, you jest," he said casually. "This is hardly the time for pleasantries!"

As he spoke, his gaze swept silently across the sky.

The multicolored lights in the heavens were becoming increasingly sparse.

The number of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators gathered here was the greatest in a century, far surpassing the gathering at Anhuai Heaven back then. No matter how vast this mountain range was, it was like a child’s playground to them, carved up in an instant.

Meanwhile, the battle between the few Great Daoist Masters at the center grew ever more intense. The entire sky thundered with their clashes. Several Daoist pagodas had already collapsed. The Spiritual Treasures had all found their owners, yet the combatants refused to stop, fighting with relish as if determined to prove who was superior.

More critically, as the Dharma Treasures were gradually raised and their powers activated, the sealing and containing force of this place grew stronger. Those who had obtained treasures fled in haste, while those who hadn't grew uneasy, preferring to give chase rather than linger in this dangerous place.

Surrounding the mountain range was an endless sea of skeletons, which still held many valuable items… even remnants of Daoist Traditions. Naturally, these could not be missed.

The majority of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, having gained enough, immediately reined in their greed and scattered in all directions, preparing to leave the grotto-heaven.

‘Those who remain here fighting… are mostly mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators…’

He withdrew his gaze, his eyes sweeping over the jade platform at the very center. He frowned inwardly, the True Fire surging from his body growing fiercer. Suddenly, his eyebrows shot up. A crimson-gold light flared in his hand as he sneered, "Fellow Daoist, you’ve been waiting a long time!"

Sure enough, clouds churned and a streak of black light descended from the sky, heading straight for the jade platform. It was intercepted by the crimson-gold light, which erupted into dark clouds and flickering black radiance.

Only then did Shilou Yingge’s expression change slightly.

"The Shamanic Talisman Dao?"

The roiling black qi dissipated, and a figure materialized from thin air. He was tall and thin, with a sallow complexion, dressed in black robes and black boots. A crimson dot adorned the space between his brows, and he held a jade tablet in his hand.

Daoist Master Lin blinked, a smile playing on his lips that was half mockery and half curiosity.

"And who might this be, daring to block the path of us King-Marquises from the northern noble houses!"

The man did not speak. He simply smiled, and a voice resonated in everyone's ears.

"Southern Songzhou Luoshe, Jiao Zhongzi!"

"What audacity!"

Shilou Yingge had certainly heard of the Southern Songzhou Luoshe. The name of Dilu Tian Sanglin was not insignificant; he was considered a rare pillar of the Shamanic Talisman Dao after Duanmu Kui. But however formidable Dilu Tian Sanglin might be, a single glance told Shilou Yingge that the man before him did not possess a particularly high level of divine ability. He sneered.

But Jiao Zhongzi’s eyes merely lit up, and a dense, overlapping wave of brownish-red flames erupted from between his brows and descended in an instant!

Shaoshang Minister Fire

Daoist Master Lin did not let this brief delay go to waste. Though he appeared to stand still, his divine ability had already flown out. A brilliant light flared, only to be suppressed by a dim, heavy radiance that descended upon it. A short, stout man materialized—it was Murong Yan.

"Daoist Master Lin! Long time no see!"

Murong Yan was the same short, stout figure as before, as if his recent hardships had left no trace on him. He laughed heartily as his Valley Water divine ability descended, pinning his opponent in place.

"Colluding with evil!"

Daoist Master Lin snorted, showing little surprise.

Despite Murong Yan's timely appearance, there was no trace of joy on Shilou Yingge’s face. Instead, he erupted in flames. In the sky, colorful clouds were already churning, Heavenly Light appeared, and a celestial gate abruptly plummeted downward!

Audience with the Celestial Gate

This divine ability was so iconic that everyone reacted instantly.

‘Li Zhouwei!’

Everyone froze for a moment. Shilou Yingge’s expression was calm, but his eyes turned sharp and resolute.

‘He’s finally here!’

Daoist Master Lin raised an eyebrow, his expression the most placid of the group. He was clearly aware of the grudges between them and adopted the attitude of a spectator watching a good show. Jiao Zhongzi, riding his black qi, had a speculative look on his face, a hint of anticipation in his eyes.

Only the short, stout Murong Yan’s expression had completely changed. The eager, playful demeanor was gone, replaced in an instant by a deep, haze. His eyes, filled with suspicion, stared grimly at the sky.

‘Li Zhouwei… Li Zhouwei!’

He, Murong Yan, was no fool. He had his own backers within the Murong family. The perilous situation at the riverbank had been a rude awakening. After several discussions, he had gradually come to understand his own predicament.

Now, seeing Li Zhouwei, his mind was a storm of countless suspicions.

But regardless of their thoughts, Jiao Zhongzi was intent on restraining Shilou Yingge, and Murong Yan wanted nothing to do with Li Zhouwei. For a moment, they checked each other, allowing the Audience with the Celestial Gate to crash down.

"Boom!"

A violent surge of divine abilities created a terrifying storm of spiritual energy. The Profound Foundation of the grotto-heaven was already failing, the formations growing weaker by the second. The jade platform, trembling in the storm, could no longer hold and shattered with a resounding bang!

This was precisely Li Zhouwei’s plan!

Their divine abilities were clashing, and all of them were powerful. With Murong Yan and Shilou Yingge in cahoots, it would be difficult to seize the prize directly. It was better to let them restrain each other, release the contents, and snatch them amidst the chaos.

Just as planned, the white light instantly shattered, and six streams of golden light shot out!

"What a pity…"

A wave of regret washed over Shilou Yingge, but the divine ability in his hands did not slow in the slightest. His golden robes billowed as crimson-gold True Fire erupted around his body.

Pheasant Li March!

The rolling light of shamanic arts dissipated. The True Fire bound a streak of golden light and pulled it into his palm. Shilou Yingge narrowed his eyes. In his hand was a jade slip with golden patterns, emitting a faint glow.

‘Only one-sixth…’

Shilou Yingge felt little joy. He knew there was no chance of seizing the other pieces. He turned, his gaze falling upon the golden-eyed youth not far away, who also held a stream of golden light.

Their gazes met silently in mid-air.

Two streams of light, one gold and one red, leaped into the sky, streaking across the grotto-heaven's expanse at a terrifying speed. They created a sharp sonic boom, covering an unknown distance in an instant. Countless scenes blurred past as the lights streaked through the air, finally coming to a simultaneous halt.

"Boom!"

In that instant, a dense, crimson-gold True Fire swirled across the sky, turning it into a sea of flames.

The crimson-gold True Fire surged forth, instantly filling their vision. A hand, as fair as jade, pierced through the fire. In its palm, four small, crimson swords with Profound Spiritual Patterns danced and spun, their reflections captured in Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes.

Rising to meet them was the bright, white glint of a long halberd.

"Clang! Clang! Clang…"

The Grand Ascension danced. Its bright golden body and the illusory, pure gold phantom of its Attachment ability flickered in and out of existence. In a flash, it clashed with the four crimson swords a hundred times. Intense Heavenly Light and True Fire exploded outwards. The four swords leaped back into Shilou Yingge's sleeve. The man's figure became ethereal, his eyes cold.

Pheasant Li March!

With the divine ability operating at full power, over a hundred phantoms of the True Fire Pheasant Li emerged from his body, transforming into a hundred versions of Shilou Yingge within the roiling sea of fire. The eyes of these Pheasant Li phantoms lit up in unison as they formed a hand seal before their chests.

"Light of the Profound Garrison!"

The transition from divine ability to spell art was seamless, without a moment's pause. This move alone revealed Shilou Yingge’s mastery over True Fire.

The hundred streams of True Fire light erupted, giving birth to Li Fire beneath their glow. They swept across the sky. But Li Zhouwei simply gave a light toss, sending out a streak of cyan light.

The cyan light grew as it flew, transforming into a square, cyan cauldron. The patterns of a black bird on its surface suddenly brightened, releasing a powerful suction force that drew in all the True Fire light and locked it away.

Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron!

Li Zhouwei hovered in the air, radiating Heavenly Light, completely unharmed by the roiling Li Fire. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light between his brows shot out like a golden blade of light spanning the horizon, sweeping through and annihilating the numerous phantoms.

"Clang!"

Amidst the surging Li Fire, four crimson swords suddenly appeared beside him. Shilou Yingge had materialized from within the flames!

But there was no surprise in those golden eyes. Li Zhouwei had already raised his hand, reaching into the fire as if he had calculated the exact moment. He clamped down on Shilou Yingge's incoming hand. His five fingers squeezed with sudden force, producing a creaking sound. Between his brows, darkness grew within the light, covering the entire circle. The omen of a solar eclipse had appeared.

But Shilou Yingge’s gaze was sharp, fixed directly on him. His True Fire had already been converted to Li Fire. The red in his pupils suddenly expanded, revealing a scene of a broken profound pillar.

"Boom!"

In the next instant, a dense barrage of black and gold Emperor Qi's Light erupted, engulfing the golden-robed man before him, piercing through his chest and shins, and setting off explosions of Li Fire.

Li Zhouwei’s eyes shifted slightly, a doubt rising in his heart.

‘Something’s not right…’

He leaped up abruptly. Streaks of multicolored light appeared in the sky. Heavenly Light shone down, transforming into layers of celestial gates that descended.

"Bang!"

The Shilou Yingge before him exploded with a deafening roar. A wave of pure True Fire energy swept out, pushing back the Audience with the Celestial Gate several meters. As the shockwave spread, the four crimson swords flew back, and Shilou Yingge reappeared above the celestial gates.

The man's golden robes had now transformed into a crimson-gold Daoist robe. His eyes had turned a bright red, and a crimson, circular halo materialized behind his head. Endless True Fire enveloped him, forming distorted patterns in the air, making him look like a True Fire deity.

Li Zhouwei stood amidst the radiating Heavenly Light, the Audience with the Celestial Gate blocking all the True Fire. The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron in the sky, filled with dharma power, transformed into white qi and poured down over him. His halberd held the crimson swords at bay, his pupils flashing with a strange light.

‘Still Pheasant Li March… What a formidable divine ability!’

Despite his admiration, he keenly perceived his opponent's stagnation. The technique was indeed powerful, but escaping from the Emperor Qi's Light, while seemingly impressive, had left him unable to regulate his breath for a moment.

Thus, the golden light between Li Zhouwei's brows grew brighter. Scale-like, profound patterns began to creep across his face, covering it. Sovereign's Perilous Tread was already operating at its absolute peak.

"Clang!"

The halberd broke through the blockade, scattering the four crimson swords, and thrust through the True Fire toward Shilou Yingge’s heart.

‘Such a forceful divine ability!’

Shilou Yingge’s Pheasant Li March, operating at full power and augmented by other buffs, was incredibly potent. An ordinary cultivator's dharma body would be seared upon contact, and even a cultivator who had mastered a Body Divine Ability couldn't ignore it so easily.

Seeing that Li Zhouwei had seen through his weakness and was charging in for the kill, he brought two fingers together and pushed forward. A flame of True Fire immediately rained down.

Shilou Yingge’s Dao-Profundity was high, and his Spiritual Artifacts were excellent. For years, he had only needed to focus on cultivation, unlike someone like Helian Wujiang, who had to run around for the sake of his clan. His strength was already a cut above… more importantly, his understanding of Bright Yang far surpassed Helian Wujiang's.

Helian Wujiang’s golden light was purely for bewilderment and immobilization, lacking any additional power. Furthermore, it was a demonic art filled with baleful energy, completely countered by him, rendering it ineffective. But Shilou Yingge’s True Fire flame, while possessing a bewildering effect, was primarily a tangible fusion of light and baleful energy, and it landed precisely on him.

The light of Sovereign's Perilous Tread rose as expected, sweeping away the bewildering aspect of the divine ability. But the rolling baleful light followed close behind, landing on him and halting his charge.

Li Zhouwei had already gained insights into the mysteries of Sovereign's Perilous Tread when they were fighting over the Li Fire Spiritual Treasure. Now, he was not surprised at all. The halberd thrust forward, stabbing out with a speed that still slightly startled Shilou Yingge. He hastily recalled his crimson swords, sighing inwardly.

‘I can’t hold back anymore!’

He opened his mouth slightly. A brilliant light shone from his throat. The dharma power he had been nurturing in his dantian for nearly a century burst forth, flashing rapidly in the air. An intense Supreme Yang radiance swiftly spread across the heavens, overpowering both the True Fire and the Heavenly Light.

Supreme Yang Leveling Profound Light!

"Om…"

The brilliant color of the sun instantly enveloped the world. The terrifying power of the first and most manifest phenomenon of the day was revealed without a doubt. The searing light descended, crashing against Li Zhouwei with a clang and sending him plummeting into the clouds like a falling star.

"Boom!"

A massive column of Supreme Yang light rose from the ground, kicking up a storm of bright white energy. The colorful clouds and Heavenly Light in the sky scattered, and the cloud layer receded, forming a huge, empty circle.

Shilou Yingge’s face was pale. He took two deep breaths to recover from the massive expenditure of dharma power, his gaze falling grimly on the storm below the clouds.

‘There’s no Bright Yang color… Sovereign's Perilous Tread is unyielding. That blow wasn't enough to severely injure him. I'll need to hit him one or two more times.’

But the moment that thought crossed Shilou Yingge's mind, his vision suddenly blurred, as if a Spiritual Sword had pierced his mind and was twisting relentlessly.

Intense pain flooded his spiritual sense. He tried to open his eyes, but all sorts of golden lights viciously bored into them, nearly making him cry out in pain.

"Not good!"

Alarmed, Shilou Yingge forced his eyes open. He poured his divine ability into them, and only then could he make out something through the chaotic golden light.

It was a pair of golden, profound rings.

The rings were no thicker than a finger and looked unremarkable, but they faintly emanated a platinum-colored light, constantly shaking as they sped toward him, growing rapidly larger in his vision.

‘A Spiritual Treasure!’




# Chapter 985: Pure Yang

The Spiritual Treasure, mirroring itself in Shilou Yingge's eyes, struck him with a sudden, bone-deep terror. With a sharp mental command, he urgently recalled the four crimson-veined miniature swords to shield his front. His brow suddenly flared with radiance, and a ripple like water appeared, from which a single object leaped out, roused by the Spiritual Treasure's assault.

It was crimson and no larger than a finger, a plume from some kind of bird. Its downy filaments drifted and swayed as if alive, and a brilliant, circular arc of True Fire encircled it, shedding a magnificent radiance.

Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume!

This was a major treasure of the Gao family, originally a Spiritual Artifact that the Valiant King Gao Fu had nurtured his entire life. When Shilou Yingge was to travel south, Gao Fu, anxious for his safety, had specially entrusted it to him to preserve his life-mandate in a moment of crisis.

He had only just managed to release the radiant plume when the golden light rushed straight at him. The four crimson-veined miniature swords, despite being urged to their absolute limit, were still too late to arrive in time. They transformed into four streaks of crimson light, trailing behind the golden radiance and generating a thunderous sonic boom in the air.

"Hoooom!"

The True Fire arc of the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume rained down, hundreds upon hundreds of filaments locking onto the oncoming golden light. The profound bracelet instantly burst with radiance, its once-unadorned surface suddenly covered in countless dazzling white profound runes!

'Crack!'

The Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume had been activated with such desperate urgency that, even as a top-tier Spiritual Artifact, its arcing light failed to lock down the Spiritual Treasure, which brutally tore through it in a torrent of golden light!

"Rumble!"

The man in the sky, like a True Fire celestial deity, paused for only an instant before plummeting like a falling star, sweeping away the roiling clouds. Heavenly Light and Bright Yang radiance erupted together, rocketing into the heavens!

"Cough, cough."

As the torrents of Heavenly Light and rainbow clouds slowly dissipated, Shilou Yingge climbed out of the rubble. The golden-red cloth on his chest was torn, revealing the coppery skin beneath, which was now like shattered jade, gleaming and covered in a dense, web-like pattern of impact cracks.

Torrents of True Fire poured from the fissures in his Dharma body, causing the air around him to visibly warp. Shilou Yingge coughed twice, spitting out a mouthful of Heavenly Light. The ring of True Fire behind his head dimmed slightly, and the flames on his body flickered.

The Spiritual Treasure's attack had been unexpected and possessed the ability to bewilder the mind. Unlike many immensely powerful Spiritual Artifacts, its hit probability was extremely high, yet its power was just as great. Even with the Pheasant Li Fire Profound Pillar already transformed and the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume suppressing the attack, he had still suffered a considerable loss.

Putting aside the damage to his Dharma body, the torrential Bright Yang Heavenly Light coursing through his form was continuously disrupting his internal divine abilities. The Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume had no choice but to return to his brow to help suppress the chaos.

Shilou Yingge, however, showed little surprise, his eyes instead filled with a complex expression as the image of the Spiritual Treasure replayed in his mind.

'This is...'

Pure Yang Bracelets!

'Emperor Gong's ritual vessel...'

Others might not recognize the Pure Yang Bracelets, but the Gao family knew them well.

The Gao family possessed the scrolls detailing Emperor Gong of Wei's northern tour. The objects he bestowed upon Touba Changming and Shilou Chongyang back then were two pairs of spiritual bracelets!

These two pairs were named Everlasting Peace and Exalted Harmony. Their form was similar to the Pure Yang Bracelets that Emperor Gong of Wei had granted his younger brother, Li Guangheng. Exalted Harmony was still in the Gao family's possession; though not a Spiritual Treasure, its power was terrifyingly great!

A single glance was all it took for him to recognize the Spiritual Treasure before him, sparking even greater suspicion in his heart:

'The Dragon-kin gave it to him! It must have been the Dragon-kin! When the Wei Dynasty fell and Li Guangheng perished, the Pure Yang Bracelets were taken by the Zhaohe Dragon Princess and have been in the hands of the Dragons ever since...'

He was briefly dazed, just as the Heavenly Light and rainbow clouds before him began to dissipate, and a golden blade leaped from their midst.

The Grand Ascension had arrived!

Blood still trickled from Shilou Yingge's lips, but his eyes once again welled with a crimson True Fire radiance. A shimmering profound light poured from his eyes to meet the halberd head-on, while the four crimson-veined miniature swords arced through the sky, aiming for the man's back!

"Clang!"

The sound of profound light clashing with the halberd echoed through the sky, sweeping away all the smoke of Li Fire and the Heavenly Light. The man before him was covered in golden profound runes, his entire body still ablaze with Supreme Yang fire, sections of him shining brilliantly and here and there. The Supreme Yang Leveling Profound Light had yet to disperse!

Those golden eyes, however, fixed upon him with an air of pure killing intent.

"Bang!"

From the Supreme Yang fire, a dark flame suddenly erupted, and four arms manifested behind him, each grasping one of the miniature swords, carrying a wave of fierce and ominous flames. Shilou Yingge's internal divine abilities were still in turmoil; his ability to forcibly unleash a spell art at this moment was a testament to his extremely high Dao-Profundity, but he could not control the small swords. The four crimson-veined miniature swords were captured!

The Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts had been acquired from the Eastern Sea. While not low-quality, it specialized in destroying sects and shattering prefectures, and was a Profound Essence Art for demon-slaying. Li Zhouwei's mastery was not high enough to confront such Spiritual Artifacts directly, and this art was not meant for defense anyway! A light twist of the four small swords and the four arms exploded.

But that brief moment was already enough!

The searing profound light of True Fire struck the halberd, only to be sliced apart by the crescent-moon blade, transforming into a five-colored torrent of True Fire that scattered in all directions. It was intensely hot, scorching the surrounding area and causing it to burst apart. Li Zhouwei's body was also blazing with Supreme Yang fire, but a brilliant circular point suddenly appeared at the center of his brow.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

A pillar of golden-white light immediately surged forth. Taking advantage of the fact that Shilou Yingge's divine abilities had yet to recover, it slammed into his face with astonishing speed. The surging profound light of True Fire was abruptly severed, and the scion of the Gao family was sent flying back once more, a trail of fiery red light behind him as he crashed heavily into a nearby mountain!

"Rumble!"

The mountain peak tilted and then collapsed with a crash, kicking up a vast cloud of dust.

'Vicious enough.'

Li Zhouwei's move was not meant to inflict lethal damage with the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. It was intended to force the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume in his opponent's brow to emerge and defend, allowing the residual Heavenly Light in his Dharma body to continue its mischief, thereby seizing the initiative. Yet, Shilou Yingge was willing to take the hit rather than fall further into passivity!

In the span of a single thought, Li Zhouwei's figure appeared atop the collapsed mountain peak. The radiance at his brow instantly turned a dark color, a solar eclipse omen emerging:

Emperor Qi's Light!

Thousands upon thousands of streams of light, golden in front and black behind, surged forth. They fell upon the mountain peak like a cascade of lightning, shattering the crumbling rock and pulverizing it completely. A coughing of blood rang out as golden light erupted from the shadows, and hundreds of Li Fire figures fled, gathering in the distance.

"Cough, cough..."

The flesh on Shilou Yingge's face was gone, revealing stark white bone beneath, but it was rapidly re-forming. The ring of True Fire behind his head had long since vanished. The Pheasant Li March was in effect; at a huge cost, he had finally managed to escape!

He held both hands out at his sides, True Fire surging forth. The Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume had already finished suppressing the turmoil within his divine abilities, leaping from his brow and releasing ten thousand rays of light.

"Ssssh!"

Twelve intensely brilliant, golden-red beams of True Fire descended simultaneously from the heavens!

The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron immediately sprang from mid-air, manifesting its massive original form. A gale of wind whipped from its mouth, attempting to consume the twelve golden-red beams of True Fire.

But the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume had been building up power for a long time, and the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron was simply not its equal. Furthermore, its Biyi Form, which possessed the ability to contain things, was not its primary function. It only held for an instant before its magical capacity was reached. The cauldron instantly transformed into a sheath of white light, shielding Li Zhouwei!

Li Zhouwei's body was already blessed by the radiance of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. In the single instant the profound cauldron had bought him, he had already shifted his position. Although the golden-red beams of True Fire in the heavens followed him, he had enough time to turn the Grand Ascension back!

"Hooom..."

The Grand Ascension did not move to resist the immense True Fire. Instead, it gently hooked the four almost formless crimson-veined miniature swords from within the blaze. The swords' edges were brilliant, clearly having been urged to their maximum power.

But with the spiritual swords blocked, the True Fire faced no further obstruction!

"Boom!"

The intense True Fire radiance exploded across the heavens and earth. Li Zhouwei was once again sent tumbling from the clouds. A small azure jade bowl had appeared atop Shilou Yingge's head, raining down spring winds like sweet dew, both protecting his form and rapidly nourishing his Dharma body.

But no matter how much nourishment he received, the radiance of the Pheasant Li March clearly would not recover in a short time. Shilou Yingge could only silently lower his eyes, looking down at the ground.

On the ground, a haze of smoke was dissipating. Li Zhouwei slowly rose to his feet. His body was blazing with True Fire, with the flames of Supreme Yang and True Fire interwoven, causing his body divine ability to hum and buzz, subtle cracks beginning to appear.

'What a Sovereign's Perilous Tread!'

The two men stood in a tense standoff. Just as the tide of battle was about to turn, two more streaks of light appeared from far away, morphing into figures as they drew near. One wielded a spiritual sword, slashing forward, while the other suppressed the area with a magical spell art. They cried out in unison:

"Sir Shilou, we've come to help!"

Li Zhouwei had to stop catching his breath. He once again raised his halberd, parrying the spiritual sword. The radiance on his brow flashed, and the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light instantly shattered the other person's spell art. He focused on them.

One had a drooping beard and a purple-and-white robe, his bound hair held in place by a horizontal jade hairpin. This half-foreign attire belonged to the two men who had vied with him for a Spiritual Treasure in the Hall of Li Fire just moments ago!

'How audacious! They must have been looking for an exit from this domain, stumbled upon our fight, and decided to take advantage of my old feud with the Gao family to get greedy!'

The two men's sudden appearance startled even Shilou Yingge.

Li Zhouwei's guess was correct. These two were Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the Xiangli clan, a relatively new aristocratic family from the Yan State with shallow roots. One, Xiangli Zhuyun, had good talent, while the other, Xiangli Shiyu, was far less gifted.

His plan had been disrupted, and Shilou Yingge secretly frowned.

He was fighting Li Zhouwei not for some spiritual treasure or object, but to save the Gao family's honor, to wound his opponent, or even better, to reach a mutual defeat. Why would he need help? Feeling a wave of discomfort, he could only watch with a frown.

At this moment, the two attacked together. Cinnabar rain poured down, and a white vapor surged up. Li Zhouwei's eyes, however, brightened. He raised his halberd and swept it forward!

"Clang!"

The Cinnabar Rain was instantly swept away by the Heavenly Light. The longsword flying through the air was suddenly lifted, and the golden radiance of the Grand Ascension shattered its divine ability. The Attachment leaped up, not advancing, but instead retreating and thrusting towards the man's body.

The scorching white radiance spell art from the side drew Li Zhouwei's attention. He gave it only a glance, holding his halberd with one hand while he raised the other high and brought it crashing down.

"Bang!"

This indescribable white radiance divine ability had no time to display its power before the Sovereign's Perilous Tread shattered it into a stream of light. The Grand Ascension only slowed for a moment, its brilliant blade still pointing at Xiangli Shiyu's heart!

A chill ran down Xiangli Shiyu's spine.

From a distance, it had seemed manageable, but in a real confrontation, the pressure resurfaced in his heart, his face grim. He felt that the man's body divine ability was terrifyingly powerful!

'Not even a Maha is this strong... and a Maha wouldn't have so many spell arts and divine abilities!'

'Damn it!'

Heavenly Light shattered in the sky, and the white radiance protection divine ability descended, enveloping Xiangli Shiyu. His sense of alarm was at its peak, yet the Li Zhouwei before him simply shifted his halberd, striking the divine ability.

The white radiance divine ability trembled violently, sending Xiangli Shiyu himself flying. Li Zhouwei did not hesitate for a second. The real threat was already materializing in the sky: the twelve profound beams of True Fire from the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume were descending, and the onrushing Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron had been pinned in place by Xiangli Zhuyun, who was controlling the Cinnabar Rain!

"Boom!"

From within the torrent of True Fire, a brilliant celestial gate finally emerged, its floating rainbow clouds and flickering Heavenly Light illuminating the area. The colors on Li Zhouwei's face grew more intense; he coughed up a mouthful of blood, but his True Fire burned even more fiercely, and his aura was climbing!

The Sovereign's Perilous Tread was already operating at full power, and thanks to the collective assault of his opponents, its strength was constantly rising, already about thirty percent higher than before!

This thirty percent increase might not seem like much, but it was enough to allow him to stand his ground in the air under the added power of the Audience with the Celestial Gate. He could cough up blood and not take a single step back, even radiating endless radiance from within the scorching True Fire and Supreme Yang flames.

He held his halberd in one hand, pointing it slantwise to the ground, and held his other hand out in front of him. The profound bracelet on his wrist was now gripped in his palm, and he gradually tightened his hold on it. His golden eyes seemed to pierce through the boundless flames, fixing on Shilou Yingge behind the True Fire!

Shilou Yingge's expression froze. The iridescent glow of the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume rapidly dimmed as it rushed back to defend.

He couldn't fathom how Li Zhouwei, who had been knocked down by the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume even with the added protection of the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron, could now remain completely still amidst the profound light of True Fire, even with the cauldron held back!

"Clang!"

Before Shilou Yingge could understand, the Pure Yang Bracelets in Li Zhouwei's hand disappeared.

"Rumble!"

A crimson streak of light fell to the ground like an arrow from a bowstring. Shilou Yingge's figure plummeted from the clouds, but the golden silhouette of the Audience with the Celestial Gate was fleeting. The halberd hooked upward!

Having succeeded in his attack, Li Zhouwei immediately rushed towards the now-wielding-his-sword Xiangli Shiyu, whose face fell in shock.

The Xiangli Zhuyun at his side had just managed to hold back the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron, but he never expected Li Zhouwei to be so terrifying when fighting for his life. The Spiritual Treasure's radiance was brief, but how could he not be stunned? Seeing his clan brother being attacked, he immediately activated his divine ability, causing Cinnabar Rain to fall from the heavens, all of it condensing on Li Zhouwei in an attempt to stop him.

Xiangli Shiyu was both shocked and enraged. The divine ability beneath his feet came to an abrupt halt, and the white radiance re-condensed as he released a Spiritual Artifact to prevent the other party from activating the Spiritual Treasure.

But he never expected the fierce Li Zhouwei to simply graze past him and speed away!

Each stream of Cinnabar Rain pierced his bones and marrow, riddling the ground with countless holes, but it was too dispersed. With his Sovereign's Perilous Tread flaring, layer upon layer of power stacked up, and he vanished in a streak of golden light in the distance.

The two Xiangli brothers exchanged a look, both feeling a sense of relief. When they looked down again, Shilou Yingge had already vanished, leaving only utter devastation. In the ruins, True Fire blazed, Heavenly Light flowed, and the land was scarred and desolate.

"Who knows what he got..."

The expressions of the two men had just relaxed. They had traveled a short distance when the flickering radiance above their heads began to slowly dissipate. Xiangli Zhuyun's expression changed, filled with surprise and uncertainty:

"The Great Void?"

The suppressive force that had enveloped the heavens had abruptly vanished. The aura of the Great Void re-emerged, and a violent tremor shook the surroundings. Mountains collapsed and ruins caved in, causing both men's faces to change color.

"The Grotto-Heaven can't hold on!"

In a flash, the two men disappeared, and all the streaks of light that had been roaming this domain also flew away one by one, their figures gone. In an instant, the scene shifted from extreme motion to extreme stillness. The entire Grotto-Heaven was shrouded in a faint mist, a dark radiance rapidly shimmering and its colors growing dim.

The True Monarchs had already left.

Only the few Great Daoist Masters at the central peak were still locked in combat, their battle causing flowers to rain from the sky, strange phenomena to appear, the Grotto-Heaven to rip apart, and the Great Void to separate. A torrent of spiritual energy swept forth from the mountain peak's center, causing tens of thousands of kneeling corpses scattered amongst the dense buildings to fall over one by one, rolling everywhere in the desolate wreckage.

Only the headless corpse dressed in a crane-down cloak embroidered with sacred scriptures, standing at the foot of the mountain, remained motionless.

The rolling storm only stirred the soft down on his collar and the plumes of his cloak. The spiritual sword in his hand hummed slightly, as if it were waiting to become a prize once the Great Daoist Masters had settled their score.

The head on the ground, its eyes tightly shut, rolled gently in the storm, coming to rest face up.

A wisp of handsome black hair floated across his prominent nose. The rumbling of the Great Void grew louder, and a hazy white light enveloped the head, causing the closed eyes to tremble. His pursed lips moved softly and silently, as if whispering:

"They killed... my Daoist..."

The headless corpse draped in a crane-down cloak and scriptures slowly bent down and cupped its head in its hands. In the surrounding gloom, the purely black eyes opened, staring silently and blankly at the sky.

"And now... they plunder... my Daoist Tradition..."

# Chapter 986: Dividing the Spoils

Within the ice cavern, frost and snow clung to the walls.

Daoist Master Tianwan stood silently in the center, her fingers performing divinations while her gaze remained heavy.

'The final path... "Boundless Expanse"... This is the only road left. If this path also leads nowhere, my only option is to attempt the Leap Path...'

The Cold Qi dao lineage wasn't exactly dying out; it's practiced throughout the world. But that makes it even more vexing than a fading lineage. Even those obscure, incredibly difficult dao lineages grant their practitioners a place in the world once mastered...

'But it just had to be Cold Qi! Since ancient times, it has been manipulated by Immortal Lords, reduced to a mere supplement for the Supreme Yin and Lesser Yin. In those days, almost no one was willing to practice it. The only ones who did were ancient cultivators of Lesser Yin, or even Supreme Yin, who, upon failing to break through to a higher realm, felt their Dao-Profundity was lacking and saw no hope in reincarnation. Only then would they turn to Cold Qi... And even after successfully forming a Golden Core, they were still forced to serve the powerful cultivators of the Three Yin Daos.'

She knew her own situation best. After so many years of cultivation, Tianwan had gathered a great deal of information. At its peak, the Cold Qi dao lineage had at least four "Lesser Yin Leaps," all of which only served to push Cold Qi further down this dead-end path.

The further one progressed in this dao, the more hopeless it became. The "Lesser Yin Leap-Cold" path had somehow become the orthodoxy, while the true Cold Qi dao grew weaker and weaker. Even if this made Cold Qi easier to practice at the start, whenever Tianwan looked to her future, she was filled with despair.

'One's Dao path... it determines the rest of one's life...'

As she was lost in thought, a jade pendant hidden in her white sleeve suddenly grew warm. Tianwan paused, her expression turning complex as she sneered inwardly. 'So, it's him. Zhang Yige is making his move.'

At that exact moment, a tremor ran through the Great Void. A streak of brilliance flew out and landed in the ice cavern, resolving into the figure of a man. He was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm, yet he was draped in opulent white-gold dharma robes that shimmered with flowing light. A sword hung from his waist, alongside a collection of jade talismans, precious pearls, a wooden flute, and a ceramic vase. The various trinkets clinked together with every movement—a picture of utter extravagance.

It was none other than Li Quantao! Having secured the hidden cache, he was absolutely euphoric, riding a wave of triumph. His ordinary features seemed handsome beneath his splendid attire, and his face was flushed with high spirits and unrestrained joy.

But as soon as Li Quantao looked up, his expression froze solid.

Daoist Master Tianwan's eyes were narrowed, her gaze burning into him. It felt like a hammer blow to his skull. A wave of terror so potent it stung his nose washed over him, and his vision swam. With a heavy _thud_, he dropped to his knees.

"Gr-Greetings, Great Daoist Master!"

Li Quantao had been tempered in the sect; he wasn't a fool. A Great Daoist Master personally waiting here... what could it be for? It certainly wasn't because she saw his profound fortune and wanted to take him as a disciple.

'Tossing him into a pill furnace, on the other hand... that seemed far more likely.'

Li Quantao pressed his forehead to the ice, trembling uncontrollably. All traces of his earlier triumph had vanished. The only sound was the crisp _clink-clink_ of the expensive baubles at his waist tapping against the frozen floor.

He was scared witless. Tianwan remained motionless, standing with her arms crossed. Suddenly, he saw a man in a blue, profoundly-patterned daoist robe standing silently beside him with a smile. The man had a vermilion dot between his brows and the Black Cloud Silver Sparrow Bottle hung at his waist. He hauled Li Quantao to his feet and remarked:

"What a lucky fellow you are!"

'Another Purple Mansion Realm expert!'

Li Quantao instantly understood. He was, in all likelihood, a dead man. His heart went cold. The Daoist Master before him gave him a light pat on the back, and a surge of divine ability and dharma power instantly flooded his entire body, rushing up into his throat.

_Shhh-clatter..._

All the treasures he had stuffed into his robes and the storage bags hanging from his waist ripped away from his body, taking the splendid robes with them. One moment, Li Quantao was the picture of wealth and success; the next, he was left in a single thin under-robe, collapsing back to his knees in the snow with a _thump_.

His throat ached. He whimpered twice and couldn't stop coughing, gagging as if to vomit, but nothing came up. In an instant, his heart felt utterly hollow. Misery welled up inside him, but he didn't dare let a single tear fall.

"He doesn't seem to have swallowed anything valuable."

Daoist Master Xuanyi glanced at Tianwan's expression and offered this brief defense for Li Quantao. The cold words, however, only made him more terrified. He shivered, frozen to the spot, until a calm voice descended from above:

"Daoist Friend Qu!"

Bright Heavenly Light shone down, and Li Quantao’s heart instantly filled with burning hope. He cautiously raised his eyes, glancing at the newcomer's robes. He knew it was Li Ximing. A realization dawned on him:

'My life is saved!'

Before he'd left the Mystic Realm, if the ambitious Li Quantao had known that everything would be stolen from him—that not even a single hair would be left—he would have collapsed in grief. Yet now, finding himself in that exact empty-handed state, he felt an irrepressible surge of joy amid his despair.

Tianwan raised an eyebrow. Her gaze swept past Li Ximing and landed on Daoist Master Kuang Yu, who was standing quietly to the side. She showed little surprise. She had also caught the protective undertone in Xuanyi's earlier comment and remained silent.

Seeing Tianwan's silence, Xuanyi let out a quiet sigh of relief and smiled.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, rest assured!"

As the mediator, the last thing he wanted was a fight. He gave a polite smile and emptied the storage bags, creating a mountain of items on the ground. With a flick of his index finger, he plucked one item from the pile.

It was a silver-white jade slip.

Xuanyi smiled. "Senior, please take a look... And there is also this Cold Vase..."

A flash of delight sparked in Tianwan's eyes. Her mood instantly brightened, and her tone softened as she gave a grunt of acknowledgment. She took the jade slip and closed her eyes to inspect it, adopting an air of 'out of sight, out of mind' toward the rest of the proceedings.

Xuanyi broke into a cold sweat. He pushed up his sleeve, picked up the remaining jade talisman, and turned to Li Ximing. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing?"

Everyone had already scanned the pile of items Li Quantao had brought out. The sword was a dharma artifact that had evolved from a spirit embryo, the pearl was a Wall Water Pill, and the wooden flute was merely an ancient dharma artifact. Only the jade talisman and the ceramic vase were true Spiritual Artifacts.

When the Hongxue Sect was wiped out, most of its treasures were on the fallen Purple Mansion Realm expert, Daoist Master Guansue. Finding this much in the Mystic Realm was a testament to the sect's deep reserves.

Li Ximing focused his gaze. The jade talisman was actually an artifact of the Capital Guard Daoist Tradition.

Its aura seemed unstable, however, and its divine ability felt weak, giving it no remarkable presence. Kuang Yu, at his side, glanced at it and sent him a message via divine sense, frowning:

"It's a Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman..."

Li Ximing, however, was quite satisfied. He nodded and accepted it.

Aside from these main items, the rest was a chaotic mess of cultivation manuals and common spiritual materials. It was clear the Hongxue Sect had intended this cache as a fallback, a foundation to rebuild the sect should the worst happen. Sifting through it all, they were fortunate to find a few spiritual resources suitable for the Purple Mansion Realm.

The remaining spiritual resources were divided between Xuanyi and the others. Li Ximing took a Soaring Profound Chaos Stone from the Cultivation Transcendence dao lineage. He glanced at the remaining pile of treasures on the ground and said softly:

"Since none of you have any use for the rest, let him take them."

Tianwan had gotten what she wanted; she couldn't care less about the scraps. She had no intention of doing any favors for Crimson Reef Island, and her own high-level disciples had no use for such low-grade items. She simply dissolved into a flurry of wind and snow and vanished.

Seeing her depart, Xuanyi breathed another sigh of relief. He was happy to play the part of the magnanimous one, smiling at Li Quantao. "My apologies for the rough treatment!"

Only then did Li Quantao dare to rise. He gathered his scattered belongings and picked up the fine robe, but he didn't dare put it back on, merely clutching it to his chest.

Xuanyi had always been amicable, so Li Ximing was perfectly courteous, inviting him up the mountain. The Daoist Master declined with a smile. "Daoist Friend, do you remember Bai Yinzi? He passed away from old age some years ago."

"Oh?"

Back when the True Monarch left and Jiangbei fell into turmoil, his old acquaintance Bai Yinzi had been caught up in it. With little lifespan remaining, he had fallen into Xuanyi's hands and decided to follow him, gambling on a final chance. Li Ximing hadn't expected Xuanyi to bring him up today. "So, he managed to live a few extra years..."

"More than that." Xuanyi smiled faintly and raised his hand. The Black Cloud Silver Sparrow Bottle immediately floated above his palm. A dark light leaped from it, materializing before them. It was, indeed, Bai Yinzi.

Except now, he looked much younger, and his robes bore the same black-cloud-and-silver-sparrow motif as the bottle. Upon seeing Li Ximing, he bowed low and offered a respectful greeting. Li Ximing studied him, his expression one of surprised suspicion.

"This... resembles the path of Buddhist cultivators..."

Xuanyi corrected him seriously, "Not at all. It is an orthodox Immortal Dao, though one rarely seen these days. He now possesses a 'spiritual lifespan' of one or two hundred years. While it's not enough to continue a Dao lineage, his abilities are no less wondrous than when he was alive. He helps me maintain the Spiritual Artifact and refine the baleful light within it. You could say we are helping each other."

The man chuckled, though he still seemed a bit resentful about the topic. "Although the Chunyi Dao Gate dislikes me, and that Sumian fellow would surely disagree... the Eastern Sea is a murky place, true. But this Daoist Tradition is of the Immortal Dao, make no mistake. It has nothing to do with those monks!"

Li Ximing observed him closely, nodding with a smile, though a thread of doubt remained. "If such a miraculous method truly exists, isn't it just a form of life extension in disguise? Even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator on the verge of death... would surely covet such a spiritual lifespan."

Xuanyi nodded. "It is a unique function of my Corner-Cleansing Merit Bottle. It requires someone with a 'heavy' destiny; ordinary people cannot enter it. As for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... they have already cultivated the Shengyang Acupoint, so my treasure cannot accommodate them. It only works on people like Bai Yinzi."

"I see." Li Ximing's first thought had actually been of Li Xuanxuan. But the old man had received the Talisman Seed; his situation wasn't nearly so simple. He sighed inwardly, exchanged a few more pleasantries with Xuanyi, and saw him off.

'This Xuanyi... he seems quite intent on building a friendship...'

He mused silently. Only Kuang Yu remained, standing nearby with her arms crossed. She looked at him with a hopeful smile. "Daoist Friend... I happen to cultivate Cultivation Transcendence..."

Li Ximing paused. Staring into her blue-purple eyes, he finally understood. He retrieved the jade box from his sleeve and opened it gently. Inside lay a fist-sized, brightly glowing, searing hot spiritual stone.

It was the Soaring Profound Chaos Stone he had just received.

Li Ximing laughed. "So that's why you agreed to come along so readily. I thought you needed my help with something, but it turns out you were just hoping to browse the selection..."

"Now, what kind of talk is that?" Daoist Master Kuang Yu's smile widened, and she blinked, enhancing her charm. "It's just a coincidence that I recently commissioned someone to refine a Spiritual Artifact. And I would never take it for free!"

She was clearly tempted by the resource. She fumbled in her sleeve for a moment, hesitating, before finally saying, "Please hold it for me... What little I had... I've already sunk it all into that Spiritual Artifact. However, Daoist Master Liaoluo of Mount Qusi still owes me some resources. He's sure to come out of the Grotto-Heaven with his bags full. I'll go collect the debt and exchange with you then!"

Li Ximing shook his head with a smile. He was, in fact, interested in building a good relationship, especially since he had just agreed to refine pills for her. He took the Soaring Profound Chaos Stone and placed it in her hand.

"If you need it urgently, just take it. I have no use for Cultivation Transcendence resources anyway. You can take your time finding some Bright Yang resources to pay me back."

"Thank you, Daoist Friend." Kuang Yu looked surprised. She accepted the resource, admiring it with delight for a moment before smiling. "Xinyu will remember this."

Li Ximing had met Kuang Yu a few times and knew her surname was Yin, but this was the first time he'd learned her given name was Xinyu. He offered a few polite words, but Kuang Yu replied with genuine enthusiasm, her expression turning serious.

"While I don't know anything about that resource, I _do_ recognize that Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman. My master used to have one. Its core component is Radiant Heartflame Amber, an artifact of the Capital Guard from the ancient Garrison Profound Dao."

"The Garrison Profound Dao apparently had a method for producing Radiant Heartflame Amber. Their cultivators adored these talismans, often passing them from master to disciple, adding to the set over generations. They were originally meant to be used in sets of three or six to form an array. After their Daoist Tradition was destroyed, the talismans were scattered. A single one, seen occasionally, isn't nearly as useful."

Li Ximing understood immediately. 'According to her, her master also had one. These things are only powerful as a set. Yet she shows no desire to acquire mine, either by trade or other means. Does that mean her master's talisman never passed to her?'

Daoist Master Kuang Yu didn't elaborate. She thanked him again and departed on the wind.

Li Ximing's smile faded. Li Quantao, who had been waiting silently this whole time, hurried forward and kowtowed, tears streaming. "Thank you, Daoist Master, for saving my life!"

Li Ximing shook his head and had him gather his things. He then lifted him with a beam of light and flew toward the lake, asking softly, "Did you manage to keep anything else?"

Li Quantao was sweating profusely, his voice trembling. "Not a single thing! The Mystic Realm was orderly, but it hadn't been maintained. Many of the spiritual items and resources had already lost their Spiritual Qi and degraded... This junior did his best to gather everything that was still intact. I was originally planning to come to the lake to find you, Daoist Master..."

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal grunt. Knowing Li Quantao's personality, and with two Spiritual Artifacts in his possession, who else in the Purple Mansion Realm could he possibly trust? It was very likely he _was_ telling the truth about seeking him out.

He landed on Gardenia Scenery Mountain and began to brew some spiritual tea. Looking at Li Quantao's sweat-soaked figure, he said mildly, "I saved your life this time out of consideration for our connection. Be smarter in the future. When you return to the sect, keep a low profile. As for what happened in the Mystic Realm... I will explain things to Si Yuanli. You won't be troubled."

"Yes..." Li Quantao immediately dropped to his knees and began kowtowing. Li Ximing waved him off with a smile. "Go and see the old master. Let him know you're safe."

"Yes!" Li Quantao understood the unspoken implications. His heart swelled with gratitude, and he truly began to see this senior as his own family elder. He kowtowed several more times before hastily retreating down the mountain.

Li Ximing raised his hand, inspecting the jade talisman. It was about two fingers wide and a little over an inch long. Profound patterns flickered across its surface, saturated with a frosty Cold Qi divine ability—no doubt a remnant left by Daoist Master Guansue.

By his calculations, the Grotto-Heaven wouldn't be open for much longer. He sat cross-legged, suffusing the talisman with Heavenly Light, slowly cleansing the foreign divine ability from within. As he worked, he waited quietly for Li Zhouwei, a knot of anxiety tightening in his chest.

'It doesn't matter what treasures he found... as long as he isn't badly hurt...'

He sat meditating on the mountain, cultivating in silence. An unknown amount of time passed before he finally felt a violent tremor from the Great Void. Powerful ripples spread through the air. He snapped his eyes open and looked to the north.

"So fast!"

The radiance in the Great Void—blue above and white below—grew increasingly intense. Li Ximing was just about to take flight to find Li Zhouwei when he froze.

A torrent of Heavenly Light was already converging on the mountain. A brilliant radiance descended from the sky, resolving into the form of a smiling, golden-eyed young man.

"Minghuang!"

Li Ximing shot to his feet, a wave of joy rising in him. But as he looked closer, his expression immediately twisted with distress.

Although the young man was smiling, faint cracks were visible beneath the golden, scale-like markings on his face. The clothes on his upper body had been completely shredded by some divine ability, revealing a powerful torso.

But his torso was also covered in faint, pale-white fracture lines. Streams of Supreme Yang True Fire surged within these cracks, flowing along the lines of his muscles and emitting a scorching, destructive power that crackled audibly.

Yet, the interweaving Heavenly Light and Supreme Yang True Fire only made him appear as if he had stepped forth from the sun itself, and his smile grew even more radiant.

"Grand-Uncle!" Li Zhouwei's voice was hoarse. The sound made Li Ximing's eyes redden. He could only manage to say, "Good... good..."

Li Zhouwei, however, seemed unfazed. His eyes were full of laughter. The look of suppression he always carried—the look of one who had burdened his family and been forced to humble himself—was finally gone from his golden eyes. In its place was a proud, unrestrained joy as he laughed.

"Grand-Uncle, look!"

He began pulling items from his waist, his storage bag, and even his tattered sleeves—a crackling, purple-gold greatmace; an azure, square profound cauldron covered in flying bird motifs; a Spiritual Treasure Mystic Pill that pulsed with Li Fire and was wreathed in illusions...

Spiritual resources, spiritual materials, Spiritual Artifacts, Spiritual Treasures...

The small jade table was quickly overwhelmed. The items began to pile up on the ground, clattering and clanging, flashing with multicolored light. Li Ximing was left dizzy and dumbfounded by the sheer spectacle.

"Huh?"




# Chapter 987: Harvest

The treasures before his eyes flickered, a dazzling sight that illuminated the entire Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Li Ximing held his breath, stepped forward two paces, and carefully examined the purple-golden Thunder Profound Mace.

"Oh!"

Just as he was about to pick it up, his gaze was irresistibly drawn to the Li Fire Spiritual Treasure. It was as perfectly round as a Golden Core, wrapped in golden threads and flowing with various dazzling Li Fire illusions and True Fire, making it impossible to look away. His eyes immediately fixed in mid-air.

"Wonderful!"

His eyes were glued to it, but his hand unconsciously continued its previous motion. He quickly reached for his waist, pulled out a jade box, and handed it to Li Zhouwei, saying, "Go ahead and take the pill first!"

In the grotto-heaven, Li Zhouwei had already taken a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill, but the one Li Ximing was offering now was from the 'Valley Water' lineage, and was a much better remedy. He nodded, took it without a second thought, and laughed.

"I got eight stalks of spiritual incense, five spiritual items, three Spiritual Artifacts of an incredibly high grade, one Li Fire Spiritual Treasure, one record of merit, and one spirit embryo that I snatched on the way out, and two Purple Mansion Realm cultivation arts… five spiritual resources… As for the other miscellaneous things, like ancient dharma artifacts, they're too many to count!"

"The things on me were too precious. I was worried there might be an ambush outside, and I just happened to find an exit inside, so I came out early. Otherwise, with the anomaly just appearing, I wouldn't have made it to the lake so quickly."

Li Ximing was astonished. "That's enough to be the foundation for a new sect! Just how many people did you rob?"

Li Zhouwei simply laughed. "Granduncle doesn't know how rich this Wanling Heaven is... it's probably unprecedented. Inside the grotto-heaven, immortal palaces are everywhere, Spiritual Artifacts are on display, and everything is opulent. Things that are rare outside are used as mere decorations inside the palaces... it even surpasses the Anhuai Heaven of the past. You could say everyone got their fill!"

Li Ximing secretly clicked his tongue and shook his head. "After all, it's the Wanling Upper Sect! How could it be just any Dao Lineage? But a Spiritual Treasure is hard to come by. It must have taken a lot of effort!"

Li Zhouwei's expression turned serious. "That part was indeed out of the ordinary. I made a few enemies, but they weren't anyone important, just some Northern Barbarian tribesmen, demonic cultivators from the South, and the Maha Merciful One... when you owe too many debts, you stop worrying. I just robbed them."

"The cultivators were all focused on grabbing treasures, and few wasted time fighting. The only one was the Shilou Yingge, who fought me a bit fiercely. These injuries on me are all thanks to him."

He shook his head, a placid look in his golden eyes. "He got what he asked for. He's not having a good time now either."

"Shilou Yingge!" Li Ximing knew this person was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and had personally faced the pressure he brought. It was no wonder he could cause so much trouble for Li Zhouwei. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"Just an old grudge..."

Li Zhouwei just gave a dismissive smirk and said, "First, let me show Granduncle a treasure!" He raised his hand mysteriously and lightly hooked something under the table, and a jade box immediately leaped out.

The box was covered in dense patterns and shimmered with light, looking extremely unusual. Li Ximing recognized it at a glance as the jade box Li Tongya had obtained on Pingya Island all those years ago. It had no particular value in itself, but in terms of containing spiritual items, it was the best he had ever used.

This item was originally used to store Supreme Yin Moon Radiance and moon branches, but after the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance opened, all those things were put into it, and they wouldn't suffer the slightest bit of damage, so the jade box was taken out.

His interest was piqued. "What kind of treasure is it that you have to use this to store it?!" He saw the lid of the jade box flip open, and a blazing, bright white flame was burning within. The fire was a dazzling, brilliant white. Vaguely, he could see many light-gray, almost invisible flames enveloping the bright white fire. They surged forth instantly, and a fierce, scorching heat wave rushed towards him, greatly shocking Li Ximing's heart.

"A Purple Mansion Realm spiritual flame!"

He was highly experienced in this field. He only needed one glance before he was stunned.

"A Merging Fire related to the Supreme Yang!"

Li Zhouwei had anticipated his surprise and laughed. "Spiritual items like this are rarely seen... but they're common in grotto-heavens!"

Li Ximing was no longer listening to anything he said. He quickly reached out two fingers and lightly swiped across the jade box, instantly refining the flame.

_Buzz!_ The blazing, bright white flame immediately leaped onto his palm, dancing with excitement. Li Ximing closed his eyes slightly, greatly agitated, and replied, "What a spiritual flame!"

Li Zhouwei asked with a smile, "Does Granduncle recognize it?"

This hit the spot. Li Ximing chuckled. "I actually know a bit about it! Back then, I heard Daoist Master Yuandao explain a Dao, and there was one flame called the 'Lustful Merging Fire,' and I had an epiphany from it. After that, I specifically researched and collected information, secretly matching what I found... A Great Daoist Master once mentioned that the Yuwu bird has an affinity with the Three Yangs, giving birth to three kinds of fire. The one corresponding to the Bright Yang is the essence of lustful fire outside of desire, which is the second kind of fire. But the one corresponding to the Supreme Yang is the first, called the 'Supreme Yang Merging Fire'... It is rumored to have infinite power. The Yuwu bird bestowed it upon a descendant called the 'Great Peacock of the Yang Star,' whose descendants call themselves the Heavenly Yuwu, and they use the 'Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire' that is right before us!"

There was still a look of disbelief on his face as he spoke. "I don't know much about this thing, but among the Merging Fires, it is definitely a top-tier existence! If you don't use flames, you don't know how powerful this thing is... if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who cultivates Merging Fire were to get their hands on it... it would definitely be enough for them to make a famous name for themselves among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!"

"In all these years... this is the most precious spiritual flame I've ever seen! Even the 'Small Peacock Karma' of the past cannot compare!"

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei hadn't expected this flame to be so extraordinary. He was secretly moved. While thinking, he said, "That makes sense! I remember there's a screen in the Xinhu Palace that also has a painting of the Yuwu bird, its beak pointed at the sun. There were three circular positions, which must also correspond to this legend."

Li Ximing was overjoyed. He put away the flame and laughed. "Although the Supreme Yang neutralizes it a bit, this fire still has the devious nature of Merging Fire. It can burn a dharma body and damage a person's dharma power, not only clinging to them like a festering wound and being extremely difficult to remove, but also able to summon the power of the sun to kill enemies..."

"Its power is great, but first, it consumes a lot of dharma power, and second, its power is hard to control. The latter isn't a problem, though... The key is that it's too rare. We should find a few seniors to ask about it!" Li Ximing's "not a problem" naturally referred to the Valley Wind Guide-Fire. He happily accepted it. Li Zhouwei then took out the rest of the items. The remaining spiritual item was a pot of Upper Rite spiritual material, which was integrated with the Essence-Gathering Profound Origin Art and thus could not be moved, so it would be kept in the clan.

Next was an eye-catching jade ring. Its smoky color was shimmering, as if stained with rouge. The Supreme Goodness Profound Jade and the Cascading Profound White Jade were combined into one, which was also a very valuable Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item.

"This thing is incredible. Granduncle, please take it and ask Daoist Master Zhusheng from the Southern Borderlands about it."

While Li Ximing admired it again and again, Li Zhouwei took out another item. It was a radiant, crystal-like object, shining with dazzling multicolored light, which made Li Ximing's eyebrows rise in delight.

"Now this can make up for that lost spiritual item. Otherwise, I would really have no way to explain it to Wan'er!" It was the "Whole Pill" spiritual item Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue! This item was no ordinary thing. It was mentioned in the Golden Book of Houshu and was much rarer than the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury from back then... It was a treasure of the Whole Pill Dao and could assist in transformations. If it was refined into a Spiritual Artifact, it would be even more wondrous!

At this sight, Li Ximing felt both regret and joy. Human hearts are never truly satisfied, and he couldn't help but sigh. "To think it's such a wondrous spiritual item! If the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury were still here, this item could have been used to refine an artifact for her after she reaches the Purple Mansion Realm, which would have surely taken her divine ability to the next level... What a pity!"

Li Zhouwei was non-committal and laughed. "Nothing can be perfect. Let's just wait and see." These were all things he had acquired early on. He paused for a moment and then took out another profound box, lightly picked out an item from inside, and showed a beam of white light.

Inside the box was a piece of Water Metal, about an inch long, that emitted a colorful, hazy, golden light. A thick watery mist settled at the bottom, its color a deep blue.

"A 'Converging Water' spiritual item!" This jade box was the white light he had snatched from Helian Wujiang. Li Zhouwei was extremely lucky; it wasn't a spiritual resource, but another spiritual item! He laughed. "It's just that our family doesn't have a Converging Water Dao Lineage, so I can't identify what it is... but that's not a problem. I'm acquainted with Daoist Master Xiang Chun, so I'll just send her a letter and ask."

The Converging Water Dao is a prominent Dao of the current era, one of the few Great Daos that has been consistently prominent since ancient times. Its items are not rare, and although the situation in the grotto-heaven was a little different, spiritual items of this Dao were still to be found.

Li Zhouwei wasn't surprised, but Li Ximing sighed. "No wonder everyone is so eager to get in. These five spiritual items combined would have taken me hundreds of years to collect..."

"But that's not all!" Li Zhouwei then unfastened the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron and handed it to Li Ximing, speaking seriously. "This is the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron. Although its combat power is not great, its auxiliary effects are extremely strong. It can refine spiritual water from spiritual items, and in its wondrousness, it surpasses most of the Spiritual Artifacts of today! Only in the Wanling grotto-heaven would there be such a treasure..."

Li Ximing took it in his hands. Li Zhouwei's gaze swept over the purple-gold Profound Mace and the Li Fire Spiritual Treasure. "As for these two treasures, one is an outstanding Spiritual Artifact, and the other is a Spiritual Treasure. I'll have to trouble Granduncle to refine them a bit while I recover from my injuries..."

Li Ximing readily agreed, laughing. "I also have a jade talisman with three treasures that need refining, so it's going to take me a while... but I'm more than happy to do it. It's not every day you get a chance like this."

Li Zhouwei laughed and took something out from his sleeve, holding his palm up to show it to him. It was a golden jade tablet the size of a palm, with flickering patterns and a slight curve, which made Li Ximing freeze.

"There's more?!" The golden-eyed young man just smiled. "That's right!"

He shook his hand, and the jade tablet flipped lightly in the air, suddenly transforming into a golden light. It extended like water, and when it landed in his palm, it had become a golden spear about ten feet long, entirely golden.

The spear was extremely strange, smooth all over, with no patterns or changes in shape. The spearhead and the shaft were one, making it look very unremarkable.

Li Zhouwei said with a hint of regret, "This is also a Spiritual Artifact, called the Descending Radiance Equal Edge. There are six in the set, and when they flew out, I only managed to snatch one. Its power isn't significant on its own, but it's still usable."

"Descending Radiance Equal Edge..." Li Ximing was slightly surprised, listening to Li Zhouwei's appreciative tone. "This item was forged with the Wandering Metal spiritual item. Its original owner, in order to highlight the wondrous nature of the Wandering Metal—the 'metal of no cause and no effect' and its 'wandering' nature—did not inscribe any profound patterns, pushing the Wandering Metal's abilities to their maximum..."

"Therefore, this item is quite special. Although it doesn't have a big divine ability on its own, and it moves extremely slowly through the Great Void, it has high resistance to Dharma Arts and is difficult to predict. When all six are present, it has the wondrousness of 'no cause and no effect'..."

"How amazing!"

This forging method was quite unique and was completely different from the current trend of pursuing more profound patterns and more divine abilities. Li Ximing listened thoughtfully, nodding repeatedly. "The ingenuity of an Encompassing Profoundity cultivator is truly an eye-opener!"

This Descending Radiance Equal Edge was naturally a better fit for Li Zhouwei. Li Ximing pushed it back to him and told him to keep it. Only then did Li Zhouwei begin to tally the final harvest from the Li Fire Palace. He placed a magnificent dark red jade slip on the table with a faint smile.

"An ancient Li Fire cultivation art, the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination, which allows you to achieve the divine ability 'Grasp of Ninefold Heaven'!"

Li Ximing took it and read it, sighing, "Jiangqian's Dao Lineage is settled!"

Li Zhouwei sat down next to him, taking out some spiritual water to extinguish the flames on his body and mend his injuries. He replied, "That's not all. Although this cultivation art is ancient, it's extremely wondrous and was created at the very beginning of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. It's abstruse and difficult to understand, and it greatly values one's life-mandate... it's very profound. A cultivator of this art would have a hard time switching to the Heavenly Embryo Dao..."

"What's even more rare is that in the grotto-heaven, secret arts are often held by high-status individuals and sealed in some way. But the owner of this Li Fire Palace was either one of those high-status people or was not under their authority at all, because the secret arts are attached to the end of the text, all three of them!"

In Li Zhouwei's judgment, this palace was not in the center of the mountain but in a more peripheral location, which indicated the latter possibility was more likely. He kept this in mind, and then his tone shifted. "All of this means that our family can let truly talented disciples cultivate this art, and their chances of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm are not small!"

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. Then he saw Li Zhouwei open two more jade boxes he had gotten at the same time. One contained a crimson spiritual energy, which was the Luminous Rite of Double Radiance Qi needed for the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination, and there were nine portions. The other box was even more brilliant, containing five crimson, pigeon egg-sized gems. A strong wave of Li Fire Qi immediately rushed out. Each one was bright and of excellent quality, and the one in the very center was surrounded by the others and presented a brilliant golden color.

"The ones around are Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources, the Crimson Radiance Li Amber..." Li Zhouwei swept his gaze over them. He found it strange. The one in the center should be a spiritual item, but he couldn't tell what it was. He thought to himself, 'It looks like it was prepared early, with the intention of passing down the Dao Lineage... Could they have foreseen the fate of Wanling Heaven, and that's why they prepared the spiritual qi? It's a pity I didn't have time to go to the other side hall, and so I missed the Li Fire Spiritual Artifacts...'

A few thoughts raced through his mind. Li Ximing, standing before him, let out a small exhale and laughed. "With all these things, we finally have the spiritual resources to forge that spiritual armor!"

Li Zhouwei hadn't expected him to still be thinking about the spiritual armor. He was slightly stunned. Seeing his Granduncle put it away in his sleeve, he could only laugh and accept it, saying, "I'll trouble Granduncle with this!"

It was difficult to determine the rest. Li Ximing waved him away and took the silver bell spirit embryo made of Vault Metal. He was in a great mood. "Senior Liu is watching over the Eastern Sea for us. We've never had a good way to repay him. This Vault Metal spirit embryo is more than enough. He'll definitely be happy with it, and he might even be able to help us with something..."

Li Ximing also took the eight golden-patterned profound incense sticks to look at them. He couldn't figure them out and guessed that only someone from the Encompassing Profoundity Dao Lineage would be able to identify them. Unfortunately, their family's relationship with Crimson Reef Island and Changxiao Gate was worse with each passing year. After thinking it over, the only peaceful option seemed to be Duxian.

As he was thinking, Li Zhouwei prepared to go into seclusion to heal his injuries. He reminded him, "Remember to refine that Spiritual Treasure first, Granduncle. There might be some synergy with the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination!"

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly as he saw him off. "Leave the miscellaneous tasks to me. You just focus on healing your injuries, and I'll make sure it's all taken care of."

But in the middle of the forest, Li Ximing saw the young man suddenly remember something. He turned around, his brows raised, his eyes bright, and laughed.

"I also took revenge for you on Helian Wujiang!"

# Chapter 988: Double Fire

Brilliant Heavenly Light cascaded down as gardenia petals danced upon the breeze.

A Daoist Master in gold and white robes sat cross-legged in the mountains. His hands formed an intricate seal, held protectively before his sea of qi. Guided by this seal, streams of the Bright Yang Heavenly Light divine ability surged into his body, sinking deep within.

Within his sea of qi, his Celestia Gate divine ability shone with a brilliant light, relentlessly grinding down and suppressing a treasure that was as perfectly round as a Golden Core. Under this prolonged assault, the divine ability inherent in the treasure flickered, its light waning as it steadily weakened.

An unknown time passed before the Heavenly Light finally descended. The Golden Core-like treasure trembled violently. The layers of protective light surrounding it dissipated, and the ambient Heavenly Light instantly swarmed in like a frenzied tide, surging into the treasure and dyeing it a brilliant Bright Yang gold.

'It's finally refined!' Li Ximing's heart trembled as joy surged through him. As expected, a flood of information poured directly into his mind.

The Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

He snapped his eyes open and raised his hand. The Spiritual Treasure, still resembling a Golden Core, materialized in his palm. It was entirely crimson, encircled by intricate rings of golden thread that converged into five distinct, lustrous bands. Li Fire spiraled around it, radiating an intense, scorching heat.

'A Li Fire Spiritual Treasure! And one closely related to Profound Rituals!'

As his thoughts focused, the wondrous functions of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument flooded his awareness. There were five in total!

'The first wondrous function is Li-Expanse. It manifests as a unique "Li-Light" within a grotto-heaven, described as "a variegated light, as vast and deep as the Eastern Sea." It can obscure illusions, envelop a large area, and serves to confuse and bind targets. Its range was immense, far exceeding the jade ruler I have, the Sichuan. As long as I provides sufficient dharma power, it can even expand indefinitely to blanket an entire territory.'

'This Li-Expanse may not have had much effect on Li Zhouwei, but that was only because he shattered it with his 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread'. Any ordinary Daoist Master who fell into its range would be severely restricted and would have to expend great effort to escape.'

The second function is Double Radiance. It's an exceptional combat technique, incredibly fast, possessing a force that both repels and annihilates. Once an enemy is struck by the light, a "parting" force activates, continuously pushing them back.

Furthermore, the power of Double Radiance can be augmented by a Li Fire infused by its owner. Although it can only hold one type of Li Fire at a time, the Double Radiance will adopt that fire's unique properties and power. Its potential for customization is immense.

'Right now, I can only infuse my Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame. That should enhance its spiritual quality and its ability to refine metals. If I ever find a Li Fire renowned for its destructive might, like the Heavenly Apricot Rain... its power will ascend to yet another level!'

These first two functions are each comparable to the primary ability of a high-grade Spiritual Artifact, yet they are merely supplementary. The true power of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument is concentrated in its third function: Profound Snare!

The five rings of golden thread are forged from a material called Daylight Pure-Axis Gold, which was refined for a century in the Golden Crow Radiance Flame until it became incorruptible, unmelting, and utterly indestructible. When Profound Snare is activated, these five threads descend from the heavens, each transforming into a distinct beam of light.

This light can disperse Dharma Arts and bind armaments; its applications are wondrous and many. Its only weakness is Converging Water. If the user possesses extremely high Li Fire Dao-Profundity and has cultivated the relevant Dao Lineage, they can unlock even more variations. At the peak of mastery, when the Dao Lineage is complete and Dao-Profundity is supreme, the user's Dharma Body can instantly swap positions with any of the five threads—a truly profound tactical advantage.

Even for someone like Li Ximing, whose own Dao Lineage doesn't align perfectly, the indestructible nature of the Daylight Pure-Axis Gold alone makes this ability incredibly formidable!

The remaining two functions are Dao-Cultivation and Swarm of Light. The first, Dao-Cultivation, assists in cultivating divine abilities related to the Li Fire and True Fire paths, making it a treasure for passing on a lineage.

When the Swarm of Light function is activated, it rouses the spiritual essence within the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, causing it to cast down a brilliant radiance used to suppress "heretical" paths and annihilate evil spirits...

The awkward part for Li Ximing, however, was that this "suppression of heretical paths" also seemed to affect the modern Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. As the Spiritual Treasure's owner, he was immune, but if he were fighting alongside allies, activating Swarm of Light would be... inconvenient.

'...Still, these are all outstanding functions.' As Li Ximing's thoughts settled, a sense of shock crept into his mind:

'No wonder Daoist Master Yuansu was able to dominate back then with just a single Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. Even mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators feared him. These ancient Spiritual Treasures are truly terrifying... On top of that, he had united both his Life Divine Ability and Body Divine Ability... Who would possibly dare to provoke such a figure?'

'Besides, the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was a relic of the ancient Feathered Serpent and was rumored to have the potential to become a full-fledged Dharma Treasure. This Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument is likely a few steps below that.'

His thoughts had barely faded when he immersed his spiritual sense into the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, intending to examine its inner workings. What he found, however, made him pause.

He had not expected to find a vast, intricate, and profoundly complex Daoist treatise crashing into his consciousness!

The Spiritual Treasure actually contained an inheritance, a legacy named the Southern Li Ingestion Method. It was an orthodox, ancient Immortal Dao technique for ingesting qi!

This was nothing like the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, nor was it some "Heavenly Embryo Shamanic-Talisman" path. It was the most authentic, orthodox Immortal Dao inheritance: the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature.

It consisted of tens of thousands of flowing characters, written in a profound golden seal script, all infinitely mysterious. It expounded upon the Great Dao of Li Fire, focusing on resonating and merging with heaven and earth to "seek the wondrous." This "seeking the wondrous" was their 'Yellow-Cap' stage. "Attaining it in the body" was the Daoist Master stage. "Achieving the position" made one a True Monarch or a 'Feathered Sage'. As for terms like Embyronic Breathing, Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment Realm, or Purple Mansion Realm... there wasn't a single mention in the entire text!

Li Ximing read it again and again, and realization suddenly dawned: 'This is the Dao Lineage of that Sword Immortal King!'

'That Sword Immortal King had made it very clear back then. The Yinghua Wang family cultivated the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature. In his eyes, the modern Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao—which calls itself the Immortal Dao—and the orthodox Demonic Dao of the north were one and the same. Both were nothing but heretical, deviant paths.'

'A genuine cultivation method from the ancient immortals! No wonder it had to be preserved inside a Spiritual Treasure!'

Li Ximing was secretly overjoyed, his heart pounding with excitement. 'I've heard the threshold for this ancient Immortal Dao is extremely high. But... if a junior from my family could actually cultivate it, and I gave them this Spiritual Treasure... wouldn't they wield the power of an ancient immortal cultivator?!'

He was stirred with ambition, but as he tried to delve deeper into the text, he suddenly realized something was wrong. He frowned, a new sense of shock dawning on him. 'What... what is this...'

He was a dignified Purple Mansion Realm expert, backed by divine abilities and a century of cultivation, yet after reading only the introduction, he was left baffled, barely understanding half of it!

'How is anyone supposed to cultivate this?!'

His Dao-Profundity might not be the highest, but he was still a Purple Mansion Realm expert! Even though Li Fire wasn't his specialty, his Bright Yang path was closely related to it. He had read Li Jiangqian's Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun with ease and gained significant insights. But this... this method was even more difficult to comprehend than the Golden Book of Houshu!

The Golden Book of Houshu is also difficult, but from a Purple Mansion Realm perspective, its difficulty is one of complexity. This Southern Li Ingestion Method is difficult because it's abstruse. It's obscure to a terrifying degree!

He was dumbfounded. He'd never imagined this was what "extremely high threshold" meant. He had to awkwardly abandon his previous ambitions, his mind filling with doubt.

'How could this be? There must be something missing... Surely no cultivation method is this difficult to understand. What kind of heaven-defying genius would it take to even begin this path?'

'In that case, it's completely unsuitable for my family members. A person who might have reached the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivating the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao could waste their entire life on this and achieve nothing. Even someone with the talent to reach the Purple Mansion Realm might fail to cultivate this method! I'd just be leading them to ruin.'

Li Ximing let those thoughts rest and examined the inheritance again. He suddenly noticed something else. The Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument didn't just contain the Southern Li Ingestion Method; there was also a message left by its previous owner.

This person identified himself as Daoist Master Nanzhao Lu, from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. He had lived during the time of the Great Liang, cultivated the Dao of Li Fire, and was a Great Daoist Master who had achieved 'Completion' in his divine abilities.

More importantly, he didn't mention Wanling Heaven. Instead, he identified himself as a cultivator from the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion!

'The Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion?'

Li Ximing was not unfamiliar with this name; most people in the Yue State knew it. The Azure Pond Sect's famous Yi Mountain City, located in the southern part of the Yue State, had been constructed by the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion!

'Daoist Master Nanzhao of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition... that means the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion also belonged to that tradition. The "Mansion" later vanished, so it would be logical for Lu to take refuge with Wanling Heaven, which was part of the same Encompassing Profoundity tradition.'

After all, a Li Fire Great Daoist Master who had completed his divine abilities was a top-tier expert in the world. He wouldn't be treated poorly anywhere; even Wanling Heaven would have welcomed him with open arms.

The message was brief, just a few sentences introducing his background. But the tone at the end grew somber:

"My Encompassing Profoundity tradition once governed heaven and oversaw the earth, and all obeyed. But the Sheji betrayed the Dao, leading us to this state. Now we must submit, resting our hopes in the distant profound... Yet they still call themselves the Upper Sect, using the Tianwu prestige to rule the world and 'correct' the four quarters. They act as if they are the second Thunder Palace—it is nothing but a feast held within a tomb!"

"This year, this venerable one will seek to attain the 'Li Position'. If I succeed, the Southern Fire (Mansion) will rise again, and our lineage will have a breath of life remaining. If I fail... then there will be no radiance left for us."

"Whoever finds my "Bright Instrument"—your cultivation will be when Wanling Heaven falls!"

Li Ximing read the message several times and sighed inwardly. 'This Daoist Master Lu... he saw things clearly. It seems the Wanling Upper Sect truly cannot let go of its former status as the Thunder Palace. They refuse to lower themselves. All these years, they've continued to clean up the messes in the world, "exorcising demons and defending the Dao," which has offended countless people and put all the other great powers on high alert.'

With a light flick of his hand, the Spiritual Treasure dissolved into a streak of light and settled into his sea of qi. Only then did he notice a jade summons token in his mountain dwelling vibrating, signaling that someone was reporting.

The person who arrived was Li Jianglong, looking extremely respectful. He was accompanied by Ding Weizeng. Both of them bowed deeply at the foot of the steps, a grand gesture of obeisance.

Li Jianglong spoke respectfully, "Sir, the matter you assigned us half a year ago has not yet been resolved. We sent men to the Shahuan Kingdom three separate times, but we found no news of the Daoist Master you seek. We were told he has not returned in many days..."

Li Ximing possessed a spiritual jade ring, and its most suitable new owner was this Daoist Master Zhusheng of the Shahuan Kingdom. He had sent people to make contact long ago, but he hadn't expected the man to be impossible to find.

"No matter." Li Ximing calculated on his fingers; more than half a year had passed. He glanced down at Ding Weizeng, noting that the man had been stalled at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm for some time. He was at the "Completion" stage but had no clear path forward. Li Ximing sighed inwardly before asking, "What news is there? How are things on the lake?"

Li Jianglong replied respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, the riverbank is still in turmoil. Structures on the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter continue to collapse; the place is a ruin now. There has been no news from the north for many days, we don't know what they are waiting for. Only a few monks from the Wilderness come down occasionally, but Jiangxia is keeping watch."

Li Ximing's focus sharpened. "How are the Mushroom Forest Plains?"

The man had managed the family's affairs for a long time without issue and was highly proficient. He immediately understood the implications of the question and replied, "The Azure Pond Sect has shown no reaction, sir. They are continuing to consolidate their forces."

"Hmm..." Li Ximing mulled this over, then looked down at Li Jianglong with a smile. "And how is Suihuan doing?"

Among all of Li Zhouwei's descendants, only Li Jianglong had borne a son. He was born during the great conflict between North and South, when all the cultivators had gone to war, and so he was named Li Suihuan. Li Ximing himself had chosen the name and remembered it well. At the mention of his son, Li Jianglong immediately bowed again. "He has been tested, sir. He possesses spiritual apertures and is currently practicing Embyronic Breathing. He seems to have a fair bit of talent."

"Good!" Li Ximing had just acquired the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination. It was a technique that could be practiced openly, and it even came with its own innate Spiritual Qi. He smiled. "Your father obtained an ancient cultivation method in the grotto-heaven. It is of the Li Fire path, with different merits from your elder brother's technique. Since the timing is so fortunate, let him be the one to cultivate it."

"My deepest thanks, Daoist Master!"

Li Jianglong was visibly overjoyed. Li Ximing chuckled, happy to make the arrangements and bestow both of the fine cultivation methods he'd acquired. But then, Li Jianglong knelt once more and kowtowed. "This junior's cultivation has reached the threshold. I was preparing to enter seclusion to break through to the mid-stage. But after managing affairs for these past few years, I finally have this chance to see you, Daoist Master... and I wished to ask for guidance."

Li Ximing nodded internally. Li Jianglong truly had dedicated a lot of time to managing the lake's affairs these past years; Li Ximing wouldn't have offered such favor—granting a name and a cultivation method—otherwise. Hearing his request, he smiled. "Do you have anyone in mind to recommend as your replacement?"

Li Jianglong replied, "Fifth Uncle is kind and magnanimous, he handles difficult matters with ease, and he has a carefree, unconventional demeanor. This junior cannot hope to match him..."

"That boy?" At the mention of Li Zhouming, Li Ximing shook his head and laughed. "He's only been kept in line recently because Xia Shouyu has him under control. Who is he capable of managing? Don't throw your Fifth Uncle to the wolves."

This frightened Li Jianglong so much he ducked his head, a cold sweat breaking out. "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare," he stammered. Fortunately, the Daoist Master seemed to pay it no mind. He simply took a sip of tea and mused aloud:

"The Wilderness is too important right now, so Jiangxia can't be moved. Little Cui has returned to the island. Ding Weizeng isn't skilled in internal affairs. We're out of people who are talented in both governance and warfare and who also command enough prestige to keep everyone in line."

"Aside from you and your brothers, the Jiangque generation has more women than men of note. Only Jiangzong has shown real promise. Don't entrust him with the full burden yet. Just give him an official title and let him act as your deputy for a while. Have 'Minggong' teach him the ropes. We'll consider it a test."

"This junior obeys!"

A single, casual sentence from Li Ximing was enough to trigger a massive political shift on the lake, one that involved the transfer of power between the family's main branches. Yet he showed no hesitation, his face still holding a faint smile. "Don't look down on him just because his cultivation is low for now. We're lucky to have him."

Li Jianglong nodded repeatedly and quickly departed. Only then did Li Ximing's smile fade. Within his sea of qi, the Purple-Gold Thunder Mace was already suppressed. He stared quietly at the drifting gardenia petals.

'I have enough Li Fire and Whole Pill spiritual materials, but I still haven't identified a key Converging Water material. This upcoming grand gathering of cultivators... many people will surely be seeking artifact refiners. I should be able to get the final materials for the spiritual armor there. I also need to visit Qize. Zhouwei has confiscated a growing number of Treasured Artifacts from those Buddhist cultivators. It might be time to negotiate with the Lotus Temple.'

'Come to think of it... I have a lot of Spiritual Artifacts on me. I need to re-evaluate them. It would be best to trade some for items that are more useful. With Spiritual Artifacts, quality trumps quantity. To think I'd live to see the day where I have too many!'

The thought made him laugh aloud. Just he, Li Ximing, now possessed the Sichuan for control, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger for mobility, and True Fire, Li Fire, and Merging Fire for offense. The newly acquired Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman was also likely a protective Spiritual Artifact focused on a unique wondrous ability. He was frighteningly well-equipped.

'All these treasures... they're worth more than my own life. If I'm not careful, a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators might just ambush me to steal them all...'

Just as he was mulling this over, a clear, bright voice rang out in the mountains. "Daoist Friend, are you present? Kuang Yu has come to visit!"

Li Ximing recognized her voice immediately. He knew she was here to repay the favor concerning the Soaring Profound Chaos Stone. He rose to greet her, "I am truly honored..."

"You're too kind." Daoist Master Kuang Yu, still clad in her light azure robes, smiled as she landed in the clearing. "I hurried back to find Daoist Friend Liaoluo. He was quite fortunate; despite spending so long in the grotto-heaven, he wasn't seriously injured and even managed to acquire several benefits."

She sat down gracefully at the stone table, retrieved a white jade box from her sleeve, and placed it on the table with a smile. "He mentioned that he ran into your family's Daoist Master Minghuang, who was with Yangya. Afraid of a misunderstanding, Liaoluo retreated early. He heard you were looking for Bright Yang materials, so he gave me this Victory General Stone. It's a spiritual resource..."

Kuang Yu paused, raising an eyebrow. "Perfect for refining spiritual armor, I hear!"

Li Ximing was startled for a moment, then he understood. He had promised Dingyang Zi long ago that he would ask around for artifact refinement materials on his behalf. News of this must have spread from another Daoist Master. He mused inwardly:

'She, Xuanyi, and Liaoluo must all be in the same circle, or perhaps from closely related Daoist traditions. They are separate from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, but still friendly toward it.'

His mind settled, he opened the jade box. Inside lay a thin slice of jade, glowing with a brilliant radiance. A dense wave of Bright Yang qi washed over him. He accepted the item and bowed his thanks. "Daoist Friend Kuang Yu, you have solved a great difficulty for me."

Kuang Yu smiled. "It's nothing. This is mutually beneficial. There's no point in exchanging endless pleasantries."

Her straightforward manner left a very good impression on Li Ximing. He thought again of the spiritual jade ring, and after a moment's consideration, he asked, "Daoist Friend, do you happen to know Daoist Friend Zhusheng of the Jade True path?"

Kuang Yu nodded, a slightly puzzled look on her face. "Naturally, I know of him..."

She hesitated for a moment before explaining, "To be clear, the Three Yuans of the Azure Pond Sect were active in the Southern Sea in their early years. All three are highly capable and forged many friendships. My grandfather, the cultivators of Mount Qusi, and even Mount Jingyi—before it split from the Southern Sea faction—all had dealings with Daoist Master Yuansu."

"Xuanyi and Daoist Master Qiuhu actually met when they were children and know each other very well. I, on the other hand, was studying at Hengzhu, so I didn't see them as often."

"As for Daoist Master Zhusheng, he is closer to Daoist Master Yuanxiu. If you need a favor from him, you'd have better luck asking the newly ascended Daoist Master Qinghu."

"I see!" Li Ximing nodded to himself, silently mapping out these relationships. 

"Thank you for the guidance, Daoist Friend!"

Kuang Yu smiled and added, "The old Daoist Master of Mount Qusi is still around, and he excels at artifact refinement. If you have such needs in the future, I can also formally introduce you to Daoist Friend Liaoluo..."

Her eyes were bright. She tilted her head slightly, revealing the elegant contours of her profile. Though her voice was soft and gentle, it carried an unmistakable tone of serious conviction.

"The Supreme Yang has lost its brilliance, but you and I are more or less on the same side. Tianwan is devoted to the Immortal Dao and doesn't harbor much ill intent, but we still have Changxiao, Baoqing, and Jinghai to worry about... It's difficult to predict the future, but we must be prepared."

"It is always good to have more dealings with allies."

Li Ximing was taken aback for a moment, then nodded with great seriousness. He sighed inwardly. 'She knows a great deal as well. But then, she has followed Hengzhu for so many years. It's only natural that Hengxing would give her some guidance in the end.'

He met Kuang Yu's smiling eyes, poured her a cup of tea, and raised his own. "I will definitely pay them a visit!"

## Beihai Sea

Dark colors shifted and the void trembled. A gray streak of light traversed the gloomy Great Void. Within the oppressive darkness, fleeting glimmers of illusory light flared, as if countless vast and terrifying shadows were submerged deep within, revealing only a scale here or a claw there.

On the surface of the sea below, wind and rain churned the waves. A woman with a pure and clear demeanor stood silently in the downpour. Beside her, the Dragon King's colossal form stood immobile, his expression frigid, not speaking a word.

CRACK! A bolt of lightning tore across the night sky, bleaching the world white for an instant. It illuminated a red-haired, golden-robed man standing nearby, his expression inscrutable. He spoke in a low, haunting voice, "Wanling Heaven has fallen."

He held a mirror in his hands. An image flickered within it—a crescent of light, blue on top and white on the bottom, floating in the Great Void. The image wavered, sometimes clear, sometimes blurred, but one could vaguely discern endless ruins and a landscape littered with shattered bones.

The Beihai Sea Dragon King, standing beside Daoist Master Xiang Chun, spoke with a calm expression, his voice raspy. "It is indeed empty. The Encompassing Profoundity tradition has no face left. They didn't even bother to conceal their actions... This is a demonstration of power—showing that the once-great Wanling Upper Sect has fallen so low that any stray dog can tear flesh from its bones!"

On the other side, Dongfang Changmu's expression grew icy. "This was expected. Tianwu's radiance is so overt... it's hardly dignified. And the Wanling Sect is even worse. The Encompassing Profoundity daoist tradition is scattered to the winds, each branch protecting its own territory. How many of them have ever truly united for a common cause?"

Nearby, Xiang Chun lowered her head slightly, listening as Dongfang Lieyun asked, "Who obtained Lin Hengjiang's Dao Lineage?"

Dongfang Changmu shook his head, looking puzzled. "I wasn't able to detect it. Perhaps someone concealed its trail."

This small interlude didn't hold their attention. The thunder overhead grew more intense. Dongfang Changmu lowered his voice. "The plans of all the great families are coming to fruition. The White Qilin is currently on the border of the Underworld's territory. All three sides are entangled..."

"The Yang family has the Underworld's support and is determined to seize the 'Position of True Qi'. The conflict between North and South has conveniently flattened most of the obstacles within the Yue State. All that Yang Jinxin lacks now is the final catalyst."

Dongfang Changmu's eyes were filled with a mixture of dark gloom and fervent anticipation; he was even trembling slightly with excitement. Dongfang Lieyun's expression likewise flickered with emotion, and he slowly closed his eyes.

"The entire Yue State is like dry tinder in the peak of summer. Layer after layer of oil has been poured upon it. All it lacks is a single spark... and in an instant, a storm will erupt. A storm that will capsize the entire order of the south."

Dongfang Lieyun's brows shot up. He snapped his eyes open, staring intently at Dongfang Changmu. In that instant, the rift that divided the various branches of the Dragon-kin seemed to vanish, replaced by a shared, surging ambition and a restless agitation that could no longer be suppressed.

"Success or failure... it all hangs on this final step."

Dongfang Changmu's eyes were bright. He replied with cold certainty, "He is an Immortal. He cannot be wrong."




# Chapter 989: Securing the Armor

Qize.

The mountain forest was pitch-black, covered in white snow. The black and white merged in profound unity, creating a striking scene. As Li Ximing descended on his beam of light, he saw roiling demonic smoke churning below. A man in brown robes, his face wreathed in smiles, rode the wind up to greet him.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

He called out eagerly. Only then did Li Ximing recognize him. It really was Daoist Master Luo from the Southern Borderlands.

That fiend had finally stopped wearing his Thousand-Eye Devil Robe, having swapped it for a set of simple brown robes. His features weren't inherently sinister, and without the demonic attire, he almost looked respectable.

"Your noble clan had a bountiful harvest in the Grotto-Heaven. Congratulations!"

Li Ximing replied with a smile, "You flatter me! Daoist Master Luo, you also have a new air about you!"

Daoist Master Luo hadn't yet replied when Dingyang Zi, who was pacing around a stove on the mountain with his hands behind his back, let out a cold laugh.

"He got beaten so badly in the Grotto-Heaven that he's finally learned some restraint... which is good. It saves him from defiling my Sun-Worshipping Mountain!"

Li Ximing had seen Daoist Master Luo here more than once, so he assumed their relationship with Dingyang Zi ran deep. Still, given Daoist Master Luo's devilish path, a few sarcastic jabs were inevitable.

"Heh."

Daoist Master Luo chuckled, invited Li Ximing to sit at the table, and replied, "It was just using a few hairy folk. What's there to fuss about with those monkey-like things? I make my own decisions, live comfortably, and that's enough. What do other races have to do with me?"

Seeing Dingyang Zi sit down, Daoist Master Luo sneered, "Sometimes you give them too much face, and these hairy folk get full of themselves. Be ruthless, and they're grateful instead. Did the Descendants of Zhou spread everywhere by asking politely? No, they slaughtered their way there! Now, I use a few hairy folk, and they want to settle accounts with me."

Li Ximing guessed he must have been beaten badly and had his treasures stolen by some Northern Barbarian in the Grotto-Heaven, leaving him full of resentment. He didn't reply, just shook his head helplessly. But Dingyang Zi said:

"If not for that, you wouldn't have found it so easy to enter this Qize."

Li Ximing glanced over and noticed Dingyang Zi's expression was much more desolate, as if weighed down by heavy thoughts. He turned to look at him:

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, your harvest was good. It seems you're here about the Spirit Armor."

"Exactly!"

Refining a Spiritual Artifact took a long time. Since Li Ximing already had the materials, he naturally didn't want to delay. He immediately took several jade boxes from his sleeve, lined them up on the table, and introduced them:

"These are two Crimson Radiance Li Ambers and a Victory General Stone. One is Li Fire, one is Bright Yang. They should be suitable."

Dingyang Zi took them for a closer look and nodded silently. Only then did Li Ximing stand up and say solemnly, "I've heard that Sun-Worshipping Mountain possesses a quantity of Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold, an extremely precious spiritual material. My clan's Spirit Armor has gathered many spiritual resources, but it lacks a top-tier primary material. Please, Daoist Friend, name your price so I might trade for it."

Dingyang Zi had anticipated this when he first mentioned the spiritual material, so he wasn't surprised. He stroked his beard slightly and said softly, "That's reasonable. You previously left three Neck Feathers with me to trade for spiritual resources. I've already shown them to the Mount Qusi Dao Lineage. They are interested in a trade. Paired with some of my own items, it's just enough to trade for their Dao Lineage..."

His expression turned serious. "It's just... that Blameless Spirit Wood, I need to use it to trade with Daoist Friend Qinghu for something else... Are you willing, Daoist Friend?"

Li Ximing understood immediately. He had left his spiritual resources with this man for years; how could Dingyang Zi only focus on the materials for his Spirit Armor? He would certainly inquire about his own needs as well. In truth, he had likely already found buyers for everything, just waiting for Li Ximing to ask.

The price was fair. After all, the Blameless Spirit Wood itself was quite large and highly valuable. It had originally been acquired in exchange for two Neck Feathers.

'So, it's really five of my clan's spiritual resources in exchange for the Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold!'

The problem was, the Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold wasn't a complete portion; it was a remnant from a Sword Immortal's sword ornament. This made it less than ideal. As Li Ximing hesitated, Dingyang Zi took a golden box from his sleeve and said:

"Daoist Friend, you have been refining pills for me all these years without asking for payment. I have kept this in mind and naturally won't be greedy. There is still more than half a portion of this Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold remaining... If you give me one more spiritual resource, we can consider the crafting fee settled as well."

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat. "Excellent!" he said, overjoyed. "My thanks, Daoist Friend!"

Having Dingyang Zi refine a Spiritual Artifact was no simple matter. A decent Spiritual Artifact would cost the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master several years, or even more than a decade, of effort. That didn't even account for the cost of various materials and the mental toll... It was absolutely not something that could be covered by a single spiritual resource.

Now, his past favors had settled the debt, and he had also secured the Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold. Li Ximing actually felt he still owed the man. He smiled. "If you need Spirit Pills refined in the future, Daoist Friend, just send someone to the lake!"

Dingyang Zi smiled and nodded, standing up decisively. He raised an eyebrow. "Then we'll use the Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold, Heavenly Star Crimson Gold, and Victory General Stonetwo Li Fire, one Bright Yangas the core. The Six-Aspect Spirit Stone, Huakan Golden Essence, and Crimson Radiance Li Amber will be supplementary, supported by Gloom-Profound Sky Iron, Bright-Flame Metal, and other materials..."

He calculated for a moment, then said in a low voice, "Unfortunately, the primary-grade spiritual materials are almost all Li Fire items. Their quality is high, so this armor will likely attune to Li Fire, and only be aspected toward Bright Yang."

Li Ximing frowned slightly. Daoist Master Luo shook his head. "It can't be helped. In this world, Bright Yang is in decline while Li Fire flourishes. When gathering spiritual materials normally, one will always find far more Li Fire than Bright Yang."

But Li Ximing was calculating inwardly: 'It's not necessarily bad. Zhouwei already has a full set of Bright Yang Spiritual Artifacts. Having more Li Fire will make it harder for others to scheme against him. Besides, Bright Yang-type metals and stones are hard to find. Dragging this out would be more trouble...'

'As for this last spiritual resource for him...'

Li Ximing still had two Neck Feathers. While fewer in number than the Crimson Radiance Li Ambers, they were still the most suitable. Although Wall-Sinking Water was becoming rarer, he could use Kuang Yu's Xinyu market to scour all of Zhulu. It might take two or three months, but he could always replenish his supply. It was a renewable resource.

But he didn't take them out immediately. Instead, he smiled, "I'll arrange it for you as soon as I return!"

He knew that the Li family was giving out more and more Neck Feathers, which was gradually attracting unwanted attention. Chen Yin, who cultivated the Water Mansion Dao, had specifically asked about it. If they continued to be so conspicuous, it would surely invite disaster.

'I should still ask around. It would be best if I could trade for something else to give him.'

"No hurry."

This payment could wait until after the Spirit Armor was refined. Dingyang Zi seemed to understand, but he hesitated, his expression suddenly turning strange. "I forgot about Daoist Master Minghuang... If he were willing to make a trip to Qize, spit a mouthful of blood essence into the spiritual fire, and use his will to establish the inherent rank of the White Qilin armor... the result might not be any worse than using a Bright Yang spiritual material..."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up, and understanding dawned. "Brilliant..."

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator refines divine abilities and inherently possesses a high rank. Whether casting spells, refining pills, or forging artifacts, they often rely on this rank to succeed. And who had a higher rank than Li Zhouwei, the world-renowned White Qilin?

He filed this away in his mind, saying happily, "That is naturally an excellent idea. I'll go back and ask him. When you're ready, Daoist Friend, just send a letter to my lake!"

Dingyang Zi agreed. The two exchanged pleasantries for a while, and Daoist Master Luo finally found a chance to interject. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing! I also saw Daoist Master Minghuang in the Grotto-Heaven... My harvest wasn't as good as his. I only got some Pit Water. I heard... I heard... that a Gathering Wood type Spiritual Artifact fell into his hands... I was wondering..."

Li Ximing immediately knew he must be talking about their Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron. He smiled. "There was indeed such an item. It's very important to my clan. Perhaps there will be a time when we need your help, Daoist Friend... We can discuss it then."

He tactfully shut down Daoist Master Luo's idea of a trade but didn't miss the information revealed in his words. He smiled, "It seems you have some Pit Water materials on you, Daoist Friend!"

Daoist Master Luo hadn't expected him to turn the tables. He was stunned for a moment before replying, "That's right..."

Li Ximing waved his hand. "Do you have any spiritual resources that I might trade for?"

Seeing his sincerity, Daoist Master Luo simply raised a hand, took a box from his sleeve, and placed it on the table. "I have a Water-Mallow Stone. It's quite rare."

Li Ximing nodded.

He had no personal use for Pit Water items, but they made good gifts. The Xiao Family had moved to Cangzhou in the Northern Sea. Li Ximing was supposed to pay them a visit, and he naturally couldn't go empty-handed. He had a Cangzhou Serpent Scale, but that item came from Cangzhou. It might be related to the Xiao Family's new territory. It would be as awkward as visiting the Li family and presenting them with an expensive Wanling Flower.

The matter had been delayed because of the Wanling Heaven incident. Now that Li Zhouwei had returned, the lake was safe, and most importantly, he had more resources. It was time to pay that visit. Besides, he also hoped that Senior Daoist Master could offer some guidance on the current situation.

Although Daoist Master Luo didn't know why he wanted the spiritual material, he was very enthusiastic. "Daoist Friend, just take it! I have no use for it. You can repay me when you get some Gathering Wood spiritual resources."

But this man cultivated the Demonic Dao and was a fiend at heart. Li Ximing couldn't rest easy. He gave him a Gathering Wood Spirit Pill that a junior clansman had obtained from the Southern Township hall, added a Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill, and promised to refine pills for him, thus properly acquiring the item.

Daoist Master Luo's true intentions lay elsewhere, however. He smiled and asked for an introduction to Si Yuanli.

It wasn't a difficult request. Li Ximing understood perfectly and agreed. Without further discussion, he rose on his beam of light and traversed the Great Void. He finally felt a weight lift from his mind, having settled this pressing matter. He thought to himself:

'It's finally settled. I just need to pick up the Spirit Armor when it's done...'

But as he rode his light back to the lake, he frowned. He sensed the Purple Mansion Realm aura of the Upright Wood Dao!

"Hm?"

Who else could it be? It had to be Si Yuanli!

'Before I left, I told the juniors I'd be right back... It seems he was determined to wait for me here.'

He descended on his light, materializing in the pavilion at the foot of the mountain. Sure enough, he saw the Daoist Master standing patiently, looking calm but sighing repeatedly, his eyes betraying a deep anxiety.

"Daoist Friend Qinghu!"

Li Ximing smiled as he emerged from the void. Si Yuanli let out a breath of relief and turned, looking somewhat helpless. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing led him up the mountain, smiling. "Did you have a good harvest in the Grotto-Heaven, Daoist Friend? To come all the way here, you must need some Treasure Pills refined!"

At the mention of the Grotto-Heaven, Si Yuanli was rendered speechless. The words he had planned died in his throat. He let out a long sigh and shook his head. "Harvest? What harvest... I came out of seclusion thinking it was a new world, only to find that Azure Pond is a complete mess! How can this be called an Immortal Sect? How can this be called a Golden Core power?"

"What's wrong?"

Li Ximing seemed to recall something and asked solemnly. Si Yuanli looked up, a bitter smile on his face. "Zhaojing! Yang Zhuo has rebelled! The Mushroom Forest Plains have rebelled!"

Li Ximing froze. It took him a moment to process this. "Ah?" he asked, confused.

"Yang Zhuo?"

"Rebelled? Against whom?"

Si Yuanli sat down at the table with him, his expression one of pure frustration. He sighed. "Against Azure Pond... He killed the Azure Pond cultivators in the Mushroom Forest Plains market, listed their crimes, and has already crossed the plains into the Quanwu territory... He's raised a banner, 'Slaying Demons and Defending the Dao.'"

"Slaying Demons and Defending the Dao..."

The more Li Ximing heard, the more absurd it felt. He didn't know how to respondor whether to call it absurd or fitting.

The current Azure Pond was not what it once was. The chaos in Jiangbei had ripped away all pretense. Ning Wan herself was accused of great crimes. Even Azure Pond's own people no longer believed in their 'Immortal Sect' title, nailing the name 'Demon Sect' firmly to their mountain gate. To say 'Slaying Demons and Defending the Dao' was, in fact, not wrong at all.

But a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... leading a few followers who weren't even at that realm, claiming to overthrow Azure Pond? Which cultivator in all of Yue State wouldn't laugh out loud at that?

Even in its weakened state, Azure Pond could mobilize thirty or forty Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators without issue. And even if they failed to kill him, it would only take a single glance from a Purple Mansion Realm expert.

And yet, it was happening. And it was enough to make two Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters sit opposite each other on a mountain, struck speechless.

"His surname is Yang... Not only that, he bears the Mandate of Heaven..."

Li Ximing's own heart pounded. He offered the reminder, and Si Yuanli just lowered his head in vexation, sighing. "He must be blessed by the True Qi of Tianwu!"

How could he, Si Yuanli, not know? If his name wasn't Yang, if he wasn't blessed by True Qi, just for occupying the Mushroom Forest Plains, Yang Zhuo and his rabble would have died thousands of times over!

'Slaying Demons and Defending the Dao... What a fine 'Slaying Demons and Defending the Dao'! Whose fault is it that Azure Pond is in this state today? Now _he_ shows up to 'defend the Dao'... Where was he during the Demon Calamity? Where was he during the North-South conflict? Where was he when the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter fell?'

'If he really has the guts to defend the Dao, why doesn't he go overthrow the Pristine Water Rank! It's just a convenient excuse, isn't it? A rotten plaque they keep under a table, but pull out and polish whenever it suits them!'

The Daoist Master's face turned cold. He slammed his cup on the table and ground his teeth. "The great figures up high... they're going to push Azure Pond, push all of Yue State, right into the Yang Family's hands! How can this be! This is an Immortal Sect! How did it come to this!"

Li Ximing watched him with lowered eyes, pouring him some tea. "And what if it is? Hasn't it always been this way... You and I are Purple Mansion Realm. That gives us the qualification to pick a side, and the qualification to be pawns. The ones waiting for the axe to fall today are just those who haven't jumped off Azure Pond's sinking ship yet."

"But you, Daoist Friend... that might not be the case."

Si Yuanli raised his head to look at him, the anger and resentment on his face suddenly fading. He just nodded quietly. Li Ximing, however, met his gaze, his eyes bright with a smile. "Not a single member of the Si Family holds a key position. In the great Azure Pond Sect, the one managing affairs is a Guest Retainer named Qin."

"To say you are completely unprepared for this, Daoist Friend, would be to underestimate me."

# Chapter 990: Si and Ning: To Stay or To Go

Si Yuanli smiled bitterly inwardly. He paused for a moment, his expression shifting to one of deep emotion.

"How could I possibly look down on you, Daoist Friend? The awe you inspired by reaching the Purple Mansion Realm in a mere ten years... I was consumed with envy back then. Knowing you are a person of such caliber, how could I cling to old perceptions?"

This middle-aged man had achieved his Purple Mansion Realm late in life. He looked even older and more weathered than Li Ximing. Stroking his beard, he continued:

"I am simply not like you, Daoist Friend, able to place your 'Bright Yang' pawn so early in the game. My current situation is... awkward. I am merely here to test the waters."

Li Ximing knew the 'Bright Yang' he referred to was Li Jiangliang, who was currently at Yang Zhuo's side. He understood Si Yuanli suspected his family had boarded the Underworld's ship long ago. He merely sipped his tea, saying nothing, as Si Yuanli continued:

"As for the Azure Pond... no matter what state it ends up in, it remains right on your clan's doorstep. If it's handled well, it not only stabilizes the situation but also prevents needless slaughter. It is a major affair for the peace of the common people."

Li Ximing shook his head inwardly. 'I'm not part of the Yang family... What's the use in asking me?'

He let out a heavy sigh and said in a low voice, "Daoist Friend, who truly controls the present situation? Do you think it's my Moongaze Lake? My family's position is even more awkward than yours. We have no intention of trying to 'balance' the Yue State."

This made Si Yuanli fall into thought. He took a sip of tea, his confusion evident. "Then... we just let it be? I fear we'll be burned if the fire spreads..."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow, his expression turning serious. "Daoist Friend, have you any intention of leaving the mainland? If you truly wish to have a proper discussion, let's stop beating around the bush. We can speak frankly about what clues Senior Yuanxiu left behind. There's no need for any more probing."

At these words, Si Yuanli choked, then shook his head decisively. "I have no such plans."

He paused, his tone melancholic. "Since you have asked, Daoist Friend, I will be clear."

"More than sixty years ago, just after Anhuai Heaven fell, my family's old ancestor issued a command: any young, talented cultivator practicing True Qi within the Azure Pond's jurisdiction was to be reported immediately. This order was of the highest priority, with dedicated personnel assigned to it. It was only rescinded after his fall..."

Li Ximing nodded silently, listening to Si Yuanli sigh. "Thinking back on it now, His Lordship must have foreseen this, or at least suspected it. Why else would he issue such a command?"

His expression was distant. "Since ancient times, nine out of ten who achieve Fruition Attainment do so by riding the tides of the world. Even a genius capable of weaving the heavens and earth or establishing their own Dao cannot escape this. Back then, when His Lordship ascended to the Profound Rank, the nature of the 'Jade True' position was clarified. The moment 'True Qi' descended, he knew this day would come."

"He often taught me: 'Entering the Dao is like choosing a master; cultivation requires seizing the opportune moment.' This is the directive my ancestor left for me: to preserve ourselves on the mainland, and nothing more than to not interfere with the Yang Clan!"

His expression was grave, revealing his resolve. "My Sima Family has migrated from north to south, moving countless times, but we have rarely left the mainland. We have always produced figures who could command the winds and clouds, all thanks to this one family precept. You are right, Daoist Friend. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator can be a pawn. But even a True Monarch won't kill a Daoist Master for no reason. Those at the Purple Mansion Realm have the right to pick a side. The only risk is picking the _wrong_ side!"

"Even if we pick the wrong side, we won't lose our lives so easily! But to pick _no_ side? To quietly take my clansmen and leave the Azure Pond? What would that make my Sima Family? If either side decided to settle accounts, would I still be left alive?"

Li Ximing's face showed deep contemplation. He watched Si Yuanli silently as the man continued in a heavy voice:

"Back in the day, the Gao Clan, the Helian Clan, even my own Sima Family during the Ning State era... did we pick the right side? Not necessarily. But when the dust settled, we still retained our status as King-Marquis and immortal sects."

"Even the Chen Clan of Mausoleum Valley—if they had just been willing to lower their heads back then instead of choosing death to prove their resolve, they would still be active in the Yue State today. But the Su family and the Lin family, who retreated from the mainland... is there any word of them now?"

He laughed, his face hardening with decisiveness. "Today, Daoist Master Ning Wan is trapped in her position at the Azure Pond, shielding me from disaster. If I still don't dare to make a gamble, I would be failing the charge of my ancestor. The Underworld wants to take the Yue State; how can they do so without assistance? My Dao lineage is complete, my inheritance orderly. This makes me all the more appealing to them!"

'Preserve ourselves on the mainland...'

Li Ximing pondered this, largely grasping Si Yuanli's line of thought.

'It seems that ever since Suiguan's remark—"What does it have to do with me?"—everyone has realized the Azure Pond is just a tool. The Underworld's move is bound to be a transaction, not a manifestation of a Golden Core-level conflict in the mortal world.'

'In this turbulent situation, "preserving oneself on the mainland" must mean throwing in with the Yang Clan. No wonder he's been running around, so eager to board this ship.'

'Ning Wan is taking the heat for him, and she has also entered the Pristine Speech Heaven. She likely has no chance to switch allegiances now. But he's in a fine position!'

He looked at Si Yuanli, who was sipping his tea, and considered.

'Yuanxiu may have fallen, but he left Si Yuanli with no shortage of opportunities and connections. If that old Daoist Master was so certain the Sima Family would profit by staying on the mainland, he must have had a reason... Building a good relationship with him now... might not be a bad thing.'

He decided to test him. First, he nodded in deep agreement, then smiled. "I had forgotten... Even if the worst happens, with the favor Senior Yuanxiu shared with the Dantai of Nine Mounds, the Sima Family will always have an escape route. You have nothing to fear."

Si Yuanli naturally had arrangements. He looked slightly surprised but still nodded. Li Ximing glanced at him and asked, "How many people have you sent to serve under His Excellency?"

Si Yuanli's expression turned a bit bitter. "The appointments in the conquered market cities were special. A few Sima juniors are among them... It's just that my family's talent is thin. We haven't managed to catch his eye. We've only managed to secure a few positions by relying on our connection to Diyun Peak."

His eyes lit up, and he said in a low voice, "Several of my Sima Family's direct descendants are leaving the mountain. If they could work under Jiangliang, that would be for the best!"

Li Ximing gave him an odd look. "You should rely on your own abilities, Daoist Friend."

He was, by comparison, more concerned about the Azure Pond's next move. "And as for the Azure Pond," he asked, "how do you intend to handle it?"

Si Yuanli clearly had a decision already made. He lowered his gaze. "Qin Xian will lead people to defend Simin. After this battle, the Azure Pond will seal its sect and close its mountains. We will disperse the disciples of the Thirty-Six Peaks and hand them all over to His Lordship for him to command. We only ask to seal our gates, isolate our Dao lineage, and not meddle in worldly affairs."

"As for what His Lordship decides... that will have nothing to do with me."

Li Ximing nodded and sighed. "We shall see how the situation develops!"

He changed the subject, bringing up Daoist Master Luo. Si Yuanli just shook his head in resignation. "One of his men did bring a request. My own eyebrows are on fire right now; what mind do I have to spare for him? When my elder was alive, he didn't dare show his face. Now that the situation has changed, he's getting ideas again."

Li Ximing smiled. "He found a treasure in the Grotto-Heaven. Coming at a time like this, perhaps it could be useful."

Si Yuanli naturally wouldn't rebuff him and nodded repeatedly. Li Ximing then took out the spirit jade and asked Si Yuanli about it. But when Zhusheng was mentioned, the Daoist Master's face darkened.

"At the battle of the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, Ning Wan deceived him. Even though she was forced to, it made him leave in anger, squandering all the friendship and goodwill they once shared. Now, Ning Wan remains in seclusion, and he has closed his doors as well, ignoring everything about the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Only I can use my ancestor's favor to request a meeting... I will mention it for you, Daoist Friend."

His meaning was clear: it wasn't status that would get a meeting with Zhusheng and facilitate this deal, but Si Yuanli's personal favor. Li Ximing poured him more tea and said casually, "Then I must truly thank you, Daoist Friend."

In truth, Si Yuanli felt a measure of relief. Back then, his cultivation had been sufficient, but Daoist Master Yuanxiu had suppressed him time and again, pushing back the year of his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm under the guise of deepening his Dao-Profundity. While it certainly increased his chances of success, looking back now, there was clearly a deeper meaning.

'If I had broken through a few years earlier, I would be sharing this blame! If I had broken through a few years later, who knows what the situation would be!'

The thought that Ning Wan was out front taking the brunt of it made Si Yuanli feel somewhat better. He remembered his own business and said seriously, "I came to find you today for another matter... I have a spiritual item called 'Hollow-heart Profound Mulberry'. I need to refine a medicine, a potent remedy for elevating the spirit and refining the soul, called 'Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder'. It's used to rapidly advance a Purple Mansion Realm's cultivation and quickly establish their immortal foundation... I hope you can produce six pills. I must trouble you, Daoist Friend."

He then took a jade slip from his sleeve. "Please, take a look."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing had seen his share of the world by now. He casually took it and read it. The difficulty was indeed high. Named as a 'powder', it was a type of medicinal powder-pill, and the requested quantity was large. But for him, this level of difficulty was nothing. He raised an eyebrow and teased, "So, cultivators from your Azure Pond are also resorting to these kinds of pills now."

Si Yuanli knew exactly what he meant. Truthfully, this pill was extravagant. It consumed precious spiritual materials for an effect that wasn't particularly remarkable—far less efficient than taking even a fraction of another's immortal foundation.

The Underworld of the past might not have cared, but True Monarch Tianwu was no ordinary figure. This new lord also cultivates True Qi, so who knows what they have in common. Si Yuanli was in a hurry to increase his strength, unsure of how the Underworld would operate in the future, yet he also clung to the fantasy of cultivating his own true nature. Thus, he sought to refine this pill. He sighed,

"Please, Daoist Friend, don't mock me."

Li Ximing let the sarcasm fade from his eyes. He accepted the spiritual materials with satisfaction, but then another matter came to mind. His expression turned serious. "Daoist Friend, do you know of Li Quantao?"

Si Yuanli certainly knew. He didn't just know Li Quantao; he even knew he had two sons. He understood immediately. Smiling and nodding, he replied, "Aside from Li Xizhi's few apprentices... it would have to be him, wouldn't it."

After all, a great chaos was coming, and many lives would surely be lost. One's posted location was therefore critical. The Azure Pond only had a few of their "own people." Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er would certainly be fine, but the same couldn't be said for others.

Li Ximing nodded. Si Yuanli smiled. "Rest assured. He will be transferred overseas. He won't be coming back for some time."

In that brief exchange, they had already secured the man's life. Yet the name of another person had surfaced in Li Ximing's mind long ago, but he couldn't bring himself to say it.

Li Yuanqin.

His young uncle was also part of the Azure Pond. He was in seclusion, so he wasn't in any immediate danger, but he was also a member of the Ning family. Although he was doing his best to protect himself wisely, he couldn't fight the tide of the era. His future was shrouded in uncertainty.

Si Yuanli was extremely sharp. He had clearly thought of this as well, but it involved the Ning family. Who knew if the True Monarch's act of framing them had a deeper meaning? It seemed faintly related to Daoist Master Suiguan's intentions. How could he dare make any promises? He could only pretend not to have noticed and immediately change the subject.

While Li Ximing was lost in thought, the man before him smiled.

"Si Xunhui mentioned to me that he and Queyi are getting along very well. That's good news. What's more... I hear Daoist Master Kuang Yu of the Xinyu Archipelago also thinks highly of her. It seems she is a fortunate one."

Li Ximing nodded. Li Queyi often wrote letters home, so he was well aware of the situation.

'Si Xunhui is good-looking, has a fine personality, and is clever and smooth. He has spent these years adventuring in the Yue State, frequently striking against demonic cultivators and correcting wayward Azure Pond cultivators. While he's clearly trying to build his reputation, he is, nonetheless, a rare and suitable match.'

He offered a few smiling congratulations, but Si Yuanli turned serious. "Since that's the case, I think we should settle this matter sooner rather than later. After all, as the two children's cultivation levels get higher and higher, having heirs will become more difficult."

Since the two were willing, and Si Yuanli had brought it up, it was difficult to refuse. A thought moved in Li Ximing's mind, and he spoke directly. "What you say is true! We just need to have the two juniors return for a visit, let the elders of the family meet them, and then the matter can be settled."

The trip back and forth wouldn't take much time. Si Yuanli saw no issue and nodded with a smile.

Li Ximing personally escorted Si Yuanli out. Only then did his smile fade, replaced by a grave expression as he returned to the mountain.

"Someone, come!"

He called out, giving instructions. "I am going to the Northern Sea. I will be gone for ten days at the shortest, or several months at the longest. Go and tell Jiangzong not to involve himself in any matters in the south. If something truly urgent occurs, he can request instructions from Daoist Master Minghuang. He is not to act on his own!"

...

Xinyu Archipelago.

The sea wind howled, and waves crashed. A woman in pink robes rode the wind, arriving swiftly. The cultivators on either side saw her and quickly moved aside, calling out respectfully. A woman in purple robes nearby exclaimed, "Junior Sister Queyi is back!"

This woman had a rounded, delicate face with small ears. Her features had matured with age, and she now carried herself with a dash of dashing grace. It was Li Queyi!

She stilled the wind, first nodding to the cultivators on both sides who had come to greet her. Only then did she glance at the purple-robed woman. "Ah, Dharma Protector Yang. You seem rather idle today."

The woman seemed not to notice her coldness. She stepped forward with a smile. "I was overjoyed to hear you were returning, so I came to welcome you at once."

Li Queyi smiled but said nothing, riding the wind forward. Just then, a man arrived on the wind. He was handsome and carried himself with an air of refinement. He stopped in front of her, a hint of doubt in his voice. "Why were you gone so long this time? I was worried something had happened to you."

Only now did a genuine smile touch Li Queyi's lips. "Sister Que'Wan is also in the Qunyi Archipelago! We hadn't seen each other in years, so we had to catch up... She has truly matured so much. The way she handles and plans things, she already has the air of an elder."

A look of astonishment crossed her face. "I'm only in the Foundation Establishment Realm... but Sister is already in the late stage!"

Si Xunhui nodded in approval. The nearby Dharma Protector Yang paid this little mind. She had heard that Li Que'wan's bloodline wasn't particularly noble and that she had been posted to the remote Qunyi Archipelago, so she guessed she was one who had fallen out of favor. She hurriedly chimed in with a smile, "Truly, you are all impressive figures! But high cultivation is one thing... I'm afraid it can't compare to Junior Sister's noble bloodline, being valued so by the Daoist Master, and having such a fine husband..."

Li Que'wan was the sister Li Queyi felt closest to in the entire family. These words were grating to the ear. The flattery had completely missed its mark. Li Queyi's expression turned ice-cold. She frowned, turned, and said sharply, "Dharma Protector Yang, since when do you have the right to sow discord in my family's affairs?!"

The purple-robed woman was startled, stammering a few words. The woman before her sneered, "The Daoist Master gave an order: all former disciples of the Purple Smoke Gate are to be assigned positions like Dharma Protector and Instructor. Dharma Protector Yang, you've just come out of seclusion and clearly don't understand the situation. It's one thing to run your mouth in front of me, but if the Daoist Master were to hear this, I wonder if you could bear the consequences. You had best watch your tongue!"

"And now you're trying to stir up trouble among the direct descendants of a Purple Mansion Realm family. Be careful, Dharma Protector, or you might forfeit your life!"

She turned her head, leaving the woman standing there, and headed straight for the interior of the island. Si Xunhui shot the woman a meaningful look before stepping up to follow, smiling. "To think there are people so incapable of reading the situation."

Li Queyi shook her head and sighed. "Her cultivation was higher than mine back then; she was from my Senior Sister's generation. I showed her some respect, and she began to presume upon it. Things are not as they were. If I let her cling to me, she'll end up losing her own life and dragging me down with her."

Si Xunhui smiled warmly. "Don't worry, she won't be bothering you again."

Li Queyi glanced at him, her voice softening. "Just... discuss things with me first."

Just then, another woman came forward to report. She was also one of the former disciples from the Purple Smoke Gate, but her attitude was extremely respectful.

"My Lords!"

This group of cultivators had endured several years of hardship overseas and were now thoroughly docile. Everyone had shed the pretense of being from a great immortal sect. The status gap between them and Li Queyi had suddenly widened to an infinite degree, becoming the difference between the clouds and the mud. All that was left was to address her as 'Lord'.

She said respectfully, "The Daoist Master is waiting for you in the main hall, my Lord!"

Si Xunhui's expression turned solemn, and he immediately withdrew. Li Queyi quickly changed direction and hurried forward. Arriving at the main hall, she paid her respects and entered, only to find there was more than one person seated inside. Besides Daoist Master Kuang Yu, who presided over Xinyu, there was also a beauty in white robes with a melancholic air.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Queyi had just bowed when Daoist Master Kuang Yu smiled and bade her come forward, introducing her affectionately. "Sister Wan'er, this is Queyi. She's a junior I'm very fond of."

This person was indeed Ning Wan, who had not been seen for a long time!

In terms of seniority, Ning Wan was actually a generation above Kuang Yu.

Kuang Yu had trained in the Hengzhu Blessed Land. She had been there when the previous generation's Daoist Master fell and Daoist Master Hengli achieved his breakthrough, a time when the Blessed Land was short on manpower. Furthermore, her father was also a Daoist Master. She had undoubtedly feasted on the resources of two Daos, and her breakthrough speed was naturally extremely fast.

Meanwhile, the Ning family's most critical figure at the time, Daoist Master Yuansu, had no heir. The Ning family was in sharp decline. Ning Wan, who had been reluctantly chosen, actually had less talent than Kuang Yu and the others. It had also taken her an exceptionally long time to break through her ignorance, which is why she was so far behind. If one were to be strict about it, Kuang Yu naturally had to call her 'Sister'.

Ning Wan nodded slightly. "Queyi... which lineage do you belong to?"

Li Queyi bowed low, replying respectfully, "This junior is a great-granddaughter of the Yuandu lineage. My 'Heaven' generation ancestor was of the 'Xuan' generation, named Li Xuanxuan."

"Li Xuanxuan..."

Ning Wan obviously knew of him. She said softly, "Ah, so you are that old gentleman's descendant."

She was in a poor mood and said only this, with nothing else to add. Kuang Yu, however, grew curious. "Oh? Is Daoist Master Zhaojing your direct elder? How are his descendants?"

Li Queyi didn't dare claim that. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, Daoist Master Zhaojing is of the Yuanping lineage... The Daoist Master... has one grandson, of the 'Zhou' generation, named Ming. He has no other heirs."

Ning Wan looked somewhat exasperated, transmitting her voice via divine ability: "Xinyu... the Sima Family's future is also uncertain. How can you promise a direct descendant to them?"

Kuang Yu just smiled and bade her rise, saying with regret, "It's just a pity you've already entered the Purple Smoke Gate and reached the Foundation Establishment Realm so early. I'm not familiar with the Dao lineage you cultivate, otherwise I would have been tempted."

"But since you're working for me, I can't treat you poorly. The Purple Smoke Gate's cultivation method isn't bad, but I know of a better one. More importantly, it has a path to the Purple Mansion Realm..."

At the mention of Purple Smoke, Ning Wan frowned. "I took a look. The Purple Smoke Gate members in your territory are living in wretched conditions... This doesn't reflect well on you."

Kuang Yu said seriously, "This wasn't my arrangement. It was a reminder from Senior Tinglan... I'm not the Purple Smoke Gate, and these aren't the wealthy days of old. If I don't suppress their tempers, and since I can't personally intervene in every matter, they will only end up bringing disaster upon themselves."

"Keeping them in check a little also prevents them from causing trouble outside."

She smiled, turned her head to Li Queyi, and said, "The one you're with is from the Sima Family. He has a good background. They went south back then to follow the Supreme Yang Azure Profoundity. Daoist Master Yuanxiu was also the last of his generation to bear the title of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition... What's more..."

Kuang Yu asked, "He has Dantai blood as well, doesn't he?"

This question was naturally not for Li Queyi. She saw Ning Wan nod and said casually, "It is the Dantai family. Their ancestors were connected, after all."

As Kuang Yu replied, she casually took something from her sleeve. Several glittering round pearls rested in her palm, radiating an icy aura. They looked to be of excellent quality. She smiled, "You're close with both of us. Since there's a happy occasion, take these for now."

Li Queyi's face flushed. She repeatedly said she couldn't accept, but Kuang Yu insisted she take them and smilingly dismissed her.

Ning Wan could only sigh. With Li Yuanqin in seclusion, the few useless people left in the Ning family didn't know how to handle anything. They probably wouldn't even send a congratulatory gift! And since Ning Wan was officially in seclusion herself, she couldn't say much.

"But Sister Wan'er... your situation..."

Hearing this, Ning Wan's expression was weary. She said faintly, "It's fine. I have to go back sooner or later. By remaining in seclusion, I can temporarily avoid the Yang family's affairs. As for the final outcome... that depends on the Azure Pond."

"If the Pristine Merging Owl Pool shows even the slightest reaction, I can keep my life..."

Kuang Yu understood her meaning, of course. But the situation was far from optimistic. That Lord Lushui had always been unpredictable. One could say he was one of the most difficult True Monarchs to serve...

'What's more, to push the enormous crime of the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter onto her... it's impossible not to be suspicious.'

Kuang Yu was worried. "No matter what, it's still His Lordship's Dao lineage. This mountain, this formation, this pool... so much effort was spent. To let it all be razed to the ground... wouldn't that be a terrible waste?"

Ning Wan said distantly, "What's the need? He can dispose of this place, make a new offering to Lushui, and rebuild the Dao lineage for His Lordship. Then he can retreat at his leisure. Even if everything is torn down, what does it matter? Someday, a 'Great Daoist Master Lushui' will walk out of the pool again, pick a few families to enlighten, and won't it all be re-established?"

Kuang Yu's expression tensed. "But... what about Chi Buzi? He also entered the pool!"

Ning Wan lowered her gaze. "But he is useful."

Her voice was flat, yet it drifted quietly through the great hall.

Kuang Yu froze, looking at her with confusion. The beauty before her raised her eyes, revealing the calm and sorrow within them. Her voice was ethereal.

"He saw it clearly, he figured it out. Cultivating by the pool, even with ten thousand different divine abilities, is all for the sake of cultivating a single _use_. Once you have that use, you can grasp that key, that seal."

"The Azure Pond is a pocket that is drawing tighter and tighter. In the end, it's going to be put away. The divine ability of the Azure Pond isn't for the Purple Mansion Realm; it is His Lordship's private property and his scapegoat. Only one person can survive... There is only enough room for one. That person walks out and gets that chance, and everyone else must stay behind in the pocket."

"For all these years, I never understood why he didn't cultivate divine abilities. Thinking back now, he must have seen it clearly too. He just didn't have Chi Buzi's ambition. He wasn't willing to walk away, so he just held onto that key, alone... until his death."




# Chapter 991: Revering Martial Arts

"Drip. Drop."

A cold rain had fallen all night. The lamps on the desk cast a dim, heavy light. The handsome young man holding the brush wore a troubled expression, his golden eyes shining brightly in the gloom.

"The cultivators around Simin Prefecture are massing... We don't even need men from the mountains to estimate at least ten at the Foundation Establishment Realm... This is too risky..."

He raised his eyebrows and looked at the man beside him. "Attendant Chen, I think we need to be more cautious regarding Liyuan Dao. It's the height of the spring planting season, and the lands around Liyuan Dao are the most fertile in all of Lixia Prefecture. If a fight breaks out there, this year's harvest will be ruined... There won't be peace for the entire year."

"Oh?" The man to his side, dark-complexioned, frowned at these words. He replied, sounding troubled, "Lord Li, I see you've considered that... but... we can't afford to delay. In my opinion, if we must fight, we fight. If things get bad... we can just send people to distribute some grain."

"That is no simple matter." Li Jiangliang set down his brush and rubbed the bridge of his nose. "Who will distribute it? And to whom? The common folk working the fields will be the ones to suffer. The landlords and gentry won't show any mercy. With the Xiao family gone, Lixia Prefecture still lacks a local power strong enough to maintain order. To make matters worse, the population has grown considerably in recent years. If chaos breaks out, it will be difficult to control, and we have too few men... We can't afford to waste them on this."

He said gravely, "His Lordship stated that we are to govern by ensuring peace and letting the people rest. I understand that time is of the essence, but this requires serious consideration."

This Attendant Chen sighed heavily. "You'll have to take this up with His Lordship. I've just received orders to help Lord Ruan draft the regulations for the Palace of Revering Martial Arts... Besides, suppressing the local clans is the priority. If there's no major clan governing Liyuan Dao, who knows which passing cultivator might just seize it? Even if the people have grain, they won't have the lives to eat it."

Li Jiangliang saw his evasiveness and frowned inwardly. 'Chen Wenyao cares about the people's livelihood, but he's unwilling to offend anyone. He always seeks the middle ground.'

Aloud, he said, "In that case, I will ask Si Yuanlan to go and inquire about the order. As for the matter of a major clan governing... that isn't so difficult. If we truly conquer Yue State, we can just appoint some cultivators of clean background and outstanding character to establish new clans."

"For now, the Wilderness blocks the north, so that isn't an immediate problem. Once we win this battle and gather our forces, we can temporarily suppress these territories."

Chen Wenyao nodded, then suddenly looked over with a smile. "I heard your clan has joyous news?"

"Ah!" Li Jiangliang smiled. "Indeed. One of my older sisters is getting married. Unfortunately, I'm needed here and cannot return for it."

Chen Wenyao clearly knew who the Si Xunhui were. He finally put down his brush, saying with some apprehension, "I'm beginning to have doubts. Azure Pond is an immortal sect, after all. Even if they've tacitly allowed our actions in the Mushroom Forest Plains, they can't just turn a blind eye and permit a group of people to act so wantonly on their borders..."

Li Jiangliang, however, was confident. He shook his head and laughed.

"Attendant Chen, you worry far too much. The figures at the top are handling it. You and I just need to manage matters at the Foundation Establishment Realm. What is there to fret about?"

Chen Wenyao hesitated for a moment. "I just have one concern. His Lordship speaks of vanquishing demons and defending the Dao... but who is the demon? And who is the Dao? Azure Pond has many disciples from aristocratic families... This will not be easy to handle..."

Li Jiangliang mused, "Who is the demon... That is not something to be discussed lightly. The Chi family is already destroyed. If that day truly comes, we will act according to His Lordship's command. We certainly won't be exterminating everyone..."

His gaze shifted slightly as he hinted, "Of that batch of outstanding talents we presented to His Lordship, how many had 'clean' family names? His Lordship didn't say a critical word. That alone is enough to see his intentions..."

Chen Wenyao sighed with emotion. Seeing Li Jiangliang raise an eyebrow, he continued flatly, "His Lordship isn't here to establish a Thunder Palace. This is 'Preserving Truth and Revering Martial Arts,' not 'Pacifying Devils and Suppressing Heresy.' Otherwise, the path here would be slick with blood... How many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators have we actually executed? Your clan can rest easy."

Exposed so directly, Chen Wenyao shook his head, slightly embarrassed. Just then, he saw hurried footsteps outside the hall. A man strode in, looking quite heroic and imposing. He held a command token and smiled, "A deep discussion at this late hour? What fine spirits, you two!"

"Lord Ruan!"

Li Jiangliang rose to greet him. The man's expression turned serious. "An order from His Lordship! Our forces are not to advance to Liyuan Dao. Await further commands!"

Chen Wenyao first acknowledged the order, then rose. He looked at Li Jiangliang with envy and smiled. "It seems Lord Li's calculations were correct after all!"

...

The Northern Sea.

The Northern Sea was a realm of ice and snow, covered in glaciers and frozen islands. As far as the eye could see, there was only deep blue and blinding white. Although the Northern Sea was small, its terrain was complex, rivaling the Eastern and Western seas. Despite the ice, it held lands of thunder, Pit Water, and Jade True—a truly wondrous sight.

Further west, the ice melted, giving way to a place of metallic stone, fire, and the dawn light of the Supreme Yang. It was known as Jieyu.

Li Ximing had heard this name. The Feather-Shedding Land was the dominion of luan and phoenix, the place where the Tree of One Heart grew. It possessed all five types of fire and, even more rarely, spiritual items of the Supreme Yang. Most of the world's renowned avian beasts originated from this land.

The Feather-Shedding Land itself was vast. In fact, a large reason for the Northern Sea's small perceived size was that the Feather-Shedding Land and Cangzhou took up so much of it. There were many cultivators within, but unfortunately, the Vast Desert Wind blew year-round, making the land uninhabitable for ordinary people. It couldn't support mortals like Cangzhou, and thus, fewer major powers had taken root.

Li Ximing crossed the Hetian Sea and arrived at the Northern Sea. He could faintly make out a crimson glow to the west. He longed to see it, but he was pressed for time. He could only change direction, flying northeast over the thick ice and snow until, at last, he saw Cangzhou.

The rivers here flowed gray-black. The mountains were treacherous, teeming with bizarre insects and exotic beasts. Leeches, mites, and venomous snakes were countless in the mountains. He swept his gaze over the land and recognized it.

"It's true what the legends say. In Cangzhou, the Pit Water flows rampant! While it's not uninhabitable like the Feather-Shedding Land, anyone without experience or a cultivation base would find it perilous to travel... The people here... they cannot live easy lives."

After getting his bearings, he quickly located Mount Pai'er in Pit North Prefecture.

The mountain wasn't tall. It was a mass of gray-black rock, upon which sat palaces of black and indigo. It stood in contrast to Mount Xianyou, which had been moved to its side—one high, one low, one east, one west. They complemented each other, creating a unique vista.

This sight made Li Ximing recall the Mount Xianyou of the past.

"When I cultivated in the mountains back then, I studied its layout. It also had a left and right peak, with a supporting peak standing opposite. That mountain is still in Lixia Prefecture... I believe it's called Flying Relic Mountain..."

Li Ximing felt a knot of complicated emotions. Unlike his brothers, he had spent a long part of his childhood living with the Xiao family... It left an indelible mark on him.

'I was young then, lonely, with no companions... just two or three servants. On days when I finished my lessons, I would secretly throw on a straw cloak and wander down to the river in the light rain. I even bought a boatman's skiff to drift and drink wine from a small silver stove... Those moments... they never existed at the Lake.'

'I have never known such times again in this century of cultivation.'

The Xiao family was a leisurely one, unlike the Li Clan, where someone supervised every matter. Jade Court and Qingdu were swords of restraint, but they also ensured that Moongaze Lake never knew that kind of peaceful-world comfort. In a clan consumed by resentment, scheming for revenge day and night, even pleasure was a sin. That kind of peace could not exist.

He rode the wind down. Sure enough, he saw several Xiao family disciples sweeping the steps. A bleak, cold rain drifted from the sky. Li Ximing called out, "Are you of the Xiao Clan? The Li Clan of Moongaze has come to visit!"

When the group saw him, every last one of them knelt. One person scrambled up the mountain to report, crying out in apology. A moment later, a streak of light shot down from the peak, landing urgently before him and revealing an old man.

The old man's hair and beard were completely white, his features kind and gentle. He held a wooden staff from which hung several small medicine pouches, and he wore only a thin gray robe.

His gaze was warm, though his eyes were slightly red. "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing quickly supported him, using his free hand to steady the man affectionately. He replied simply, "Master, there is no need for this!"

This was, in fact, his master, Xiao Yuansi.

Xiao Yuansi had aged early and rapidly. He carried a knot in his heart, a burden from the past he could never release. Though his life was not one of hardship, he remained submerged in old pains. He had no accomplished heirs and had taken no other disciples in the sect. Li Ximing was his only one. He was overjoyed to see him and soon broke into a smile.

"Times have changed. You truly carry the air of a Daoist Master now."

Li Ximing shook his head, slightly embarrassed, and followed the old man up, asking after his well-being. But Xiao Yuansi raised his head and said:

"I haven't been to the mainland in many years, but I still hear the news. If it's possible... my junior sister's Yuan family... I must ask the Daoist Master to look after them..."

Li Ximing knew he always worried about old acquaintances. He reassured him, "The Yuan clan ran into some trouble, but their bloodline survives... They may not be as prominent as before, but that is not necessarily a bad thing..."

Xiao Yuansi nodded silently. "What the Daoist Master says is true... I was planning to seek you out myself. For many years, one matter has weighed on my mind... Now... with Daoist Master Qinghu's achievement, there is finally some hope. I pray we can... find news of your Grandmaster."

At this, Li Ximing understood. His Grandmaster was named Si Yuanbai. In terms of generation, he should be Si Yuanli's older brother, and moreover, the master of his own ancestor. For both sentiment and duty, he had to ask. He committed the matter to heart.

With this brief exchange, Xiao Yuansi led him to Mount Pai'er and then quietly withdrew.

At the summit, a lake had been set, its water as black as ink. Snow dusted the mountain. A fishing rod of pure, translucent jade rested on the bank. Though the mountain wind howled, the fishing line, seemingly forged from fine steel, did not move an inch.

"Zhaojing, you've come."

Li Ximing took a seat at a jade table. Only then did an old man materialize beside it.

Compared to Xiao Yuansi's weariness, Xiao Chuting looked almost exactly as he had years ago. In fact, due to his advancement in cultivation, he seemed even more at ease. His hand rested on the table, holding a black-covered book.

"Greetings, Senior! Congratulations on your achievement!"

Li Ximing cupped his hands in salute. He took out the jade box containing the Water-Mallow Stone and placed it quietly on the table. He smiled, "The mainland was in turmoil recently. The various families were in peril, fearing for their survival. This junior was unable to come and offer congratulations in time. I hope Senior will forgive me..."

"It matters not... But you've spent too much."

Xiao Chuting's gaze, holding a smile, swept gently over the jade box. He poured the tea, his eyes settling on the white, drifting snow reflected in the black lake.

"The White Qilin is now known to all the world."

Li Ximing nodded silently, his expression complex. He didn't know how to respond for a moment, so he followed the man's gaze to Mount Pai'er and praised, "A fine treasure-land of Pit Water."

Xiao Chuting sipped his tea. "The ancient cultivators were casual with their names... A Great Daoist Master once fell here, temporarily turning this place into a mountain of Supreme Yang Li Fire. But as ages passed, the cultivators who trained here consumed the Li Fire. At the same time, the Pit Water in Cangzhou flows rampant and could not be suppressed. Gradually, it reverted to a land of Pit Water."

The boundless snow reflected in his eyes. "A Purple Mansion Realm, no matter how great, cannot overcome a True Monarch. Cangzhou is the Prefecture of Pit Water. You can change it for a time, but not for an era. It was bound to return to its original master's divine ability—this is the grand trend."

Li Ximing's expression sobered. He heard Xiao Chuting ask quietly, "What were Kui Qi's last words?"

Li Ximing was silent for a beat before answering, "Supreme Yang Radiance, no more."

The old man raised his eyebrows. "He understood it in his heart, then."

"With the True Monarch having attained the high seat, the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition lost its protective talisman. Its decline was inevitable. Perhaps they once held out hope for certain... individuals... But that hope was shattered, time and again. The fall of every Daoist Master from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition was not just a death; it represented the silence of a great power."

"Even knowing how slim the chances were, he was unwilling to forsake the pride of the Supreme Yang. He had to try."

Li Ximing's heart grew heavy. "Why... must it be this way? Is it because of 'True Qi'?"

There was no surprise in Xiao Chuting's eyes. He set down his cup. "I have few scruples now. I might as well discuss this matter with you."

He slowly sat up straight, his expression serene and deep. "Zhaojing..."

"All cultivators in the world seek their own position. But it is the grand current of fate—that is the true power that decides which positions can be taken, and which will be reclaimed."

"The path of 'True Qi' is one of divine might and profound mystery, revering martial arts and seeking truth. Once this position is achieved, it grants the wielder the boon of seeking truth and the merit of achieving the Dao for all... Do you know what that means? Do you know why Anhuai Heaven's fall was so swift, so careless, so... impatient?"

"There are many great powers who wish to merge with the truth, to cultivate the Dao, and to pave the way for their descendants. And those three parts of Metallic Essence... they have long had masters prepared for them, time and time again, by the lofty Daoist Traditions."

"And the Dragon-kin... They also seek this truth. They, too, are waiting for this path to be filled. They have waited for this very day!"

Li Ximing slowly raised his eyebrows. Those fragmented words finally began to connect in his mind. That ancient, cold voice still echoed in his ears.

"Now that someone has obtained the True Monarch's Metallic Essence, they will, of course, seek to repeat the imperial achievements of the True Monarch Tianwu. A great turmoil is inevitable... which also suits the tastes of several other great powers..."

"But who will give up their position in Jiangnan? Who else can be forced to cut their own flesh? They have been lying on another's platter for hundreds of years. Now, the platter is to be washed to hold new things. Who can say it isn't right?"

"Whether to merge with the Dao and seek truth, to stir up chaos, or to plot for change... All these great figures stand high above, waiting. They are all waiting for the master of 'True Qi' to claim their throne!"

"Which side this master of 'True Qi' favors has almost become a secondary concern!"

An inexplicable light flickered in his eyes. He said softly, "You must understand... all the surging undercurrents in the world, be they the struggles between Daoist Traditions or the rise and fall of celestial dynasties, ultimately center on a single golden seat. Rise and fall, all for the sake of that honored position. Heaven and Earth move as one... Heaven and Earth move as one! With such forces in play, how could the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition not decline?"

Li Ximing slowly closed his eyes and exhaled, struggling to maintain his composure. After a long while, he said, "But... But doesn't the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition... don't they understand...?"

Xiao Chuting turned to look at him. His eyes were as still and placid as the lake before them, and perhaps even colder. The old man spoke softly.

"They always had a price to pay. Without shedding some blood, there would be no stability. Besides... the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition certainly has its share of people who understand... The affair with the Murong back then..."

"Didn't they just... understand _too_ early?!"

# Chapter 992: The Matter of Cultivation

Yehui had mentioned Hengzhu's situation in the past, so Li Ximing already understood. He remained silent for a moment before Xiao Chuting spoke in a gentle tone:

"Sometimes, even when success seems certain, it becomes impossible if the timing or the identity is wrong. Do you remember Duanmu Kui?"

Li Ximing nodded silently, noting the unreadable expression on Xiao Chuting's face as he continued:

"It cannot be done... The 'Shaman-Register' cannot be achieved. The master of the house may leave the grand hall, he may venture out to attend to his affairs, but he still returns to check now and then. How could he possibly allow someone else to take what is his? A seat belongs to its rightful owner, after all."

"Conversely, it is the other seats, the ones the great families are trying to destabilize... those are the ones worth fighting for."

A knot tightened in Li Ximing's chest. He couldn't decipher the man's true meaning, and a chill crept through him. He listened as the man before him continued:

"Whether it's the 'Purple Qi' adept from Purple Smoke, or the 'Whole Pill' master from Golden Feather, or even Dantai from overseas, Huangyu of the Northern Sea, Hengli from Hengzhu, and that master-disciple pair, Yuanshang, from the Eastern Sea... all of them are waiting for the day of 'True Qi'. They are all waiting for the True Qi result."

His pupils dilated slightly, and in a voice barely above a whisper, he added:

"Of course... that also includes Chi Buzi."

"Chi Buzi..."

Li Ximing hadn't thought of that name in years. Even now, its mere recollection sent a shiver down his spine. He pushed the unsettling feeling down, raised an eyebrow, and said in a low voice:

"I'm afraid you're waiting too, Senior..."

Xiao Chuting merely chuckled, offering no reply.

Li Ximing asked a few more questions, but soon signaled his intention to leave. Xiao Chuting regarded him for a long moment before finally speaking.

"Be cautious in who you befriend and who you shelter."

Li Ximing quickly agreed. He rose into the air as a streak of light and departed Mount Pai'er. He was just preparing to shift into the Great Void to return home when he spotted a flash of green on a remote, icy peak in the distance.

The green color seemed to possess a strange allure, instantly capturing his attention. Li Ximing focused on it, only to see the patch of color leap into the air and plummet like a falling star. The fall ended with a sickening, muffled thud of flesh and blood.

Finding the incident bizarre, he stepped through the air to investigate. Only then did he see that the green object was an ape. It had fallen from the ice mountain and been utterly destroyed on impact. Its skin was split open and flesh torn, and blood pooled on the ground, revealing the stark white of its bones. It was already dead.

The ape's cultivation had clearly not been shallow, yet even in death, its jaws were clamped tightly around a single, vibrant green herb. It must have been gathering medicinal plants when it slipped from the heights, falling to its doom.

Li Ximing studied the scene for a second longer, a sense of dread washing over him. He quickly turned away, schooling his features. Ignoring the corpse on the ground, he tore open a path into the Great Void and vanished.

...

Wanling Heaven.

The sky and earth were dim, the land itself fractured. Pale white storms scourged the realm. Whether it was the magnificent palaces or the fluttering feather decorations, all had faded, leaving behind only a stark, colorless white.

"Wanling Heaven... is already linked to the Underworld..."

The realm was disintegrating. Massive chunks of land, dragging shattered mountainsides with them, broke away and scattered. They tore free from the gray-white expanse, briefly appearing in the Great Void before plummeting back to the mortal world, crashing down to become new ruins upon the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.

On the pale, barren land, a man in white robes could still be seen, moving like a tiny ant among the mountains. He stopped from time to time, his gaze sweeping the desolation.

"The Profound Foundation is shattered. Unless the original master of Wanling Heaven is resurrected, no one can save this place!"

Lu Jiangxian strode over piles of bones. His divine sense swept out, instantly collecting the crystal-clear jade slips buried deep within the ruins. He had no interest in reading the techniques and methods recorded inside, however. He continued forward, staring into the gray-white Exiled Wind and sighing inwardly:

'A Grotto-Heaven is nourished by Pure Qi in its prime. When it perishes, it is claimed by Exiled Qi. A beginning and an end.'

When a Grotto-Heaven is masterless and its Fruition Attainment does not manifest, it can hide beyond the Great Void, undetected by True Monarchs. This is firstly because it remains linked to the status of its Fruition Attainment, and secondly, because it aligns with the 'Exiled Qi' symbol of the Lord of Obscurity and Gloom, granting it greater secrecy. But when the Grotto-Heaven finally perishes, that 'Exiled Qi', no longer tempered by the Fruition Attainment, reveals its fangs. It resonates with the dying realm and drags it all the way down into the Underworld.

Once this process begins, a gray-white 'Positional Exiled Wind' emerges, draining all things of their color. Even experts at the Purple Mansion Realm cannot withstand it and are forced to flee. When they turn back to search, the origin point is gone; the Grotto-Heaven ruins, now bound to 'Exiled Qi', are nowhere to be found.

They can only see the few broken mountain peaks that fall out of the 'Positional Exiled Wind' and into the Great Void. With nothing to support them, these fragments immediately plummet into the mortal world.

This was the first time Lu Jiangxian had witnessed such a catastrophic Grotto-Heaven collapse. When Anhuai Heaven fell, no True Monarchs had interfered; its Profound Foundation remained intact, and it descended peacefully into the Underworld, leaving few ruins behind. But Wanling Heaven's fate was similar to that of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, only far more tragic. The assembled True Monarchs had unleashed their Dharma Treasures without mercy, shattering the realm's entire Profound Foundation. There was no telling how many new mountains of debris this would add to the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.

His expression was complicated. He looked up, and within the roiling Exiled Wind, he saw an object. Though it was bound by layer upon layer of divine abilities, it was still faintly twitching.

"The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book..."

The True Monarchs were combining their power, using the moment Wanling Heaven linked with the Exiled Qi. They were willing to abandon even the Lingyang Immutable Palace, all to cast the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book deep into the untraceable, unfathomable 'Exiled Qi' that resides within the Underworld!

'The Lord of 'Heaven–Governing' is a being who can turn the world upside down, and the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book is the very tool to do it. They absolutely cannot allow this thing to return to its Fruition Attainment. Once that Fruition Attainment finds a new master, it would be enough to disrupt all their current schemes! Their only choice is to suppress the book. That way, even if the 'Heaven–Governing' master returns, they will have bought enough time to keep them in check!'

'But these True Monarchs know full well that the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book cannot truly be suppressed. Even with Wanling Heaven acting as an outer cage and the Lingyang Immutable Palace as an inner one, Liu Changdie still emerged...'

Lu Jiangxian's expression was icy, his thoughts perfectly clear:

"In truth, it wasn't just Liu Changdie. There were others like him. The master of Wanling Heaven's ultimate contingency was the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. Besides the part where I interfered, there must have been other failsafes. The moment Wanling Heaven was breached, a man named Lin Hengjiang answered the call of the book and the 'Heaven–Governing' Fruition Attainment, spontaneously awakening his Shengyang Acupoint... Not to mention the several streaks of silver light that erupted from various locations and fell upon the world."

"Although that Lin Hengjiang is no longer the man he once was, and although he is only at the Purple Mansion Realm, and although these events aren't enough to cause any major waves... they are still variables."

"And the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book will, in the end, overcome the Lingyang Immutable Palace. If they rely only on the palace to suppress it, the book will eventually calculate all its loopholes and reverse the suppression. These variables will only multiply and grow stronger, until finally, they give birth to the true Lord of 'Heaven–Governing'!"

"Neither Luoxia, the Dragon-kin, nor the Underworld likes variables—to say nothing of the various True Monarchs, great and small, who plotted Wanling Heaven's downfall. The current variables are tolerable. They can even be used to unearth more of the Encompassing Profoundity legacy. That's why they allowed Lin Hengjiang to act, and why they permitted so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to enter. But no matter what, they cannot let the situation develop unchecked!"

Lu Jiangxian had been standing here all along, so he saw everything with perfect clarity. He watched with a cold, detached gaze.

"Not a single True Monarch is willing to sacrifice their own future or gamble their position to personally suppress this artifact. That is why they must send it to the Underworld. Only the 'Exiled Qi' Fruition Attainment can, without any outside help, completely suppress the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book of the 'Heaven–Governing Rank Designation' and prevent its escape!"

"The Underworld, which resides within the 'Exiled Qi', certainly knows of this plan. And they certainly support it."

In the few days that Li Zhouwei and the others had been fighting within the Grotto-Heaven, Lu Jiangxian had already used the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book to divine 1,891 possible futures.

One of his reasons for standing here was to use these last moments to continue those divinations.

In each of these 1,891 futures, Lu Jiangxian had silently tried to influence events, testing one possibility after another, only to be met with silence every time. He continued until the very last moment, when the True Monarchs collectively seized the Dharma Treasure, and all that remained for him was that same, grim silence.

One thousand, eight hundred and eighty-four of those futures ended in a sea of blood: the complete annihilation of the Li Clan.

There were, broadly, three paths.

First, siding with Luoxia. This accounted for 807 variations. Though the details differed, the main outcome remained largely unchanged.

Li Zhouwei is besieged in Weidu Prefecture within the Zhao State. Surrounded by armies, he is forced to make a desperate attempt to attain the Fruition Attainment. The Second Manifestation immediately appears in the heavens. He perishes three days later. A rain of light fills the sky, the Heavenly Light falls into chaos, and the Supreme Yang shines, yet gives no illumination... The Bright Yang is shaken, and the world is thrown into turmoil.

In the same year, soldiers from Shu conquer Moongaze. An immortal edict arrives, ordering the execution of three branches of the clan.

Fewer members of the Li Clan are left alive and breathing than before Li Mutian first joined the army.

In 519 of these futures, a fair number of the Li family actually survived. The turning point in these scenarios was not Li Zhouwei or Li Ximing, but someone Lu Jiangxian had not expected: Li Xizhi.

In these 519 scenarios, the Li Clan ultimately compromised with Luoxia. The north fell into chaos. Li Xizhi went to cultivate at Mount Luoxia, where his Dao-Profundity was exploited by a True Monarch. When Li Zhouwei died attempting to reach the Fruition Attainment, it wasn't Shu soldiers who arrived, but forces from the north. They came with an immortal edict, sparing a few survivors at Moongaze Lake and allowing Li Zhouming to take them to the Southern Borderlands.

Li Xizhi cultivated for many years before suddenly perishing. Li Zhouming died of illness thirteen years later. Xia Shouyu led the clan for seventy-nine years, until the day Liu Changdie and Fuxun were killed by the White Victory Palace. Then, the entire clan was exterminated.

In the other 561 futures, the Li Clan chose the Dragon-kin.

Though the Li family was trapped at Moongaze Lake, beset by difficulties, they appeared docile on the surface. They allowed themselves to be pawns in the games between north and south, offering no resistance. But secretly, they colluded with the Dragon-kin, building a great tomb in the Vermillion Sea as a contingency for reincarnation.

When Li Zhouwei, besieged in Weidu Prefecture, finally fell in battle, his True Spirit escaped. He attempted to flee to the Dragon-kin to reincarnate, but was struck by the 'Aethereal Thunder Drum'. His True Spirit was shattered. Moongaze Lake was turned into a sea of blood. A remnant branch of the family fled overseas to occupy the Qunyi Archipelago, surviving precariously under Dragon-kin rule. But within a mere ten years, the direct line withered, and the clan was extinguished, its assets carved up by the other families—just like the Jiang family's story.

In the final 523 futures, the Li Clan allied with the Great Song dynasty founded by Yang Zhuo. Li Zhouwei perishes at Gardenia Scenery Mountain during a breakthrough attempt. This buys Moongaze Lake twelve years of peace. Then, the Song and Zhao State fight for supremacy. Moongaze Lake is breached by the Zhao State's great general, Wang Quwan, and the entire clan is slaughtered. Li Jiangliang, who holds a position in the imperial court, commits suicide... they are likewise unable to escape. Seventy-six of these scenarios were slightly better, leaving only Li Ximing, who secures a decent position in the Underworld. But after secretly intervening in worldly affairs, he is executed within a few years for 'disturbing the mortal realm'.

Every single one of these outcomes, without exception, ended in blood and tears.

Of course, beyond those 1,884 futures, there were seven others.

Lu Jiangxian's expression was grim.

In these seven futures, Li Xizhi also joined Luoxia. But in these versions, he was careless, and his true body was discovered. A great war erupted in the Great Void and the realms beyond. The mainland was shattered into seven islands. The Li Clan, and everyone associated with them—their allies, their associates, their in-laws, the Sima Family, the Xiao family, the Chen Clan of Yuyang... all were annihilated. Not a single soul was spared.

'The futures calculated by the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book... whether good or bad, whether a moment of glory or a lifetime of suffering, not a single one offered a true path to survival!'

He stood silently in the Exiled Wind, his eyes reflecting the suppressed Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book in the sky, his expression unreadable.

The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book was not like the minor divination power Liu Changdie possessed. Even bound by Dharma Treasures, it still possessed the noble status and profound mystery of a 'Rank Designation'. It might not be able to calculate the future actions of a True Monarch, but 80 to 90 percent of the past and present schemes of all the great powers were well within its calculations!

'This means that all 1,891 futures born from my hypotheses are terrifyingly close to the actual future. As long as the Dao Embryo does not intervene, and as long as I do nothing major to interfere, these outcomes are practically set in stone!'

He fell silent for a long time.

'The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book can calculate almost anything... but there are two blind spots.'

'One is the decisions made by the Dao Embryo immortals of Luoxia and the Underworld. The second... is me!'

'In those seven futures where my true body was discovered, the world was shaken to its core. Immortals and True Monarchs emerged to join the fray, and the vision immediately dissolved into pure chaos. Nothing remained but the shattered mainland!'

'If I just let the situation unfold, I will have completely wasted the last hundred years. Wasting the time is one thing, but missing this critical, century-long phase of change is worse. After this, even if another opportunity arises, it will be impossible to reverse our fortunes!'

He once thought that, at worst, he could just lie low for five hundred years. But looking at it now, how could five hundred years possibly be enough? Besides... after more than a century together... he couldn't just sit back and watch the Li Clan be slaughtered.

'Bright Yang and Li Zhouwei... this great chaos, this world-spanning scramble for 'True Qi', is the Li family's only chance. And in truth, it's my only chance, too.'

'The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book can calculate these 1,891 futures. But the Lord of the Immortal Mansion, the Lu Jiangxian of Green Pine Temple... did he only calculate this many? What is there that he could not foresee!'

'He made all those arrangements, even going so far as to erase his own memories to become the me I am today. There must have been a reason. If the Li family was doomed to perish while I remained safe, why would he have set up Liu Changdie? Why would he have arranged for me to see these 1,891 futures?'

Lu Jiangxian stood silently in the Exiled Wind. He slowly turned his head, all his complex thoughts gradually solidifying into a single resolve:

"Variables. I need variables. They don't want them, but I must have them. One Chi Buzi is far from enough. I need more! Even if I can't disrupt their grand scheme, I can at least fight for that one slim chance of survival!"

His eyes turned a silver-white. His divine sense continued to link and calculate, his expression serene. In his hand, out of thin air, a pale, greenish-white sword began to coalesce.

'Li Jiangchun...'

Li Jiangchun had been given the Talisman Seed precisely because his talent in the Way of the Sword was the greatest in a century, so great he might one day rival even Li Chejing.

Gifting him Li Chejing's lifetime of experience in the Way of the Sword was no waste. But this legacy... it was not something an ordinary person could receive, nor would it grant its recognition lightly. Unless Li Jiangchun's talent surpassed Li Chejing's, he would at least need to reach the realm of Sword Origin, just one step shy of Sword Intent, to even have a chance of being acknowledged by it!

Lu Jiangxian had originally planned to wait until Li Jiangchun's Way of the Sword reached a certain level before having him try to master this legacy. But now, he could wait no longer.

'It will acknowledge him, whether it wants to or not!'

Just as he had done when Li Xijun borrowed the sword, he forcibly suppressed this 'sword will'. With a flick of his finger, he sent it flying into Li Jiangchun's Talisman Seed. He, Lu Jiangxian, would dedicate a part of his mind to continuously suppressing this power, allowing Li Jiangchun to resonate with it and rapidly advance his Way of the Sword cultivation, forcing the issue until the legacy had no choice but to acknowledge him!

'The variables left behind by the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book aren't many, but they can be calculated cleanly...'

Endless silver-white vortexes swirled in his eyes as he raced against time, feeding countless new variables into his calculations at a terrifying speed.

In the endless illusions, he saw Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei, again and again. Or perhaps it was Li Jiangqian, or Li Que'wan, who would one day awaken to find 1,891 futures imprinted in their minds. Drenched in a cold sweat, they would try desperately to save themselves, only to meet a sudden, violent end...

"Using the variables themselves as a new variable..."

In that instant, the number of phantom futures exploded at a terrifying rate, repeating and replaying, over and over again.

The infinite Exiled Wind was now condensing toward a single point, plunging into the deep, bottomless Underworld. If Lu Jiangxian remained here, he could ride this gray-white 'Positional Exiled Wind' straight into the infinite Underworld.

'That place is the Underworld. The very source of the 'Exiled Qi'.'

He faced the roiling Exiled Wind as his faint connection to the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book finally severed. His figure vanished, and a shadow of gloom passed over his features.

'If all these schemes come to nothing, then I'll just have to play an open hand using the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. I'll play the very hand they think they've seen, the one they believe is insignificant. From the very beginning, playing an open hand was the only qualification the Li family ever had.'

'I cannot personally intervene in every matter. But the Li Clan needs its own Liu Changdie. It needs a member of the Li family who believes they understand the future, someone at the very center of the storm who sees it all clearly... someone to place the pieces on the board for me, one by one...'

A massive trove of memories suddenly converged. A single point of golden light rose up, traveled down a hidden channel from the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, and vanished into an imperceptible corner of the Great Void.




# Chapter 993: Father... Brother... Heh...

The wind howled, piling white drifts against the bleak, frost-covered trees.

A middle-aged man with a pallid face stood silently in the snow, clutching his robes. His gaze was vacant, fixed on nothing as the blizzard dumped layer upon layer of white upon his shoulders.

Before long, a younger man with a frigid expression approached and knelt beside him.

"Family Head... that black ape has returned. It's demanding this year's blood-food."

A sickly, flushed color rose in the middle-aged man's face. He coughed twice, then slowly closed his eyes. "Give it what it wants..."

"Yes..." The young man grit his teeth and rose to his feet. He had only taken a few steps before the middle-aged man called him back.

"Suining..."

Li Suining turned. The man had opened his eyes again. "I'm afraid my time is short," he said quietly.

A wave of grief washed over Li Suining. He stepped forward, his voice low.

"Please, Fifth Grand-Uncle, just focus on healing. If the Daoist Master were still here... he would not want to see you speak of yourself this way..."

"The Daoist Master..." The middle-aged man coughed again, a deep hatred surfacing in his eyes, mingled with anguish. "I am ashamed to be his blood. I possess neither the King of Wei's divine ability nor any talent for alchemy. A pity... such a pity..."

He paused, then said hollowly, "Suining."

Li Suining looked up as the man continued, "Flee for your life."

Li Suining fell silent, staring with his uncle at the desolate snowfall. The middle-aged man began to murmur.

"You are the last of our family's younger generation with any decent cultivation... you were always the most promising... Li Xixuan made his mistakes, but he wasn't stupid, and you are far smarter than him. You know it, too. Staying here is a death sentence."

"Now that Daoist Master Ning has also fallen... even a Purple Mansion Realm expert can perish, to say nothing of us. If we stay, we will die, sooner or later. You are better off taking your chances in the outside world. You might find that one sliver of hope."

The young man remained silent, listening.

"We are all going to die... I understood that the moment the decree came down. All of us. The Bright Yang bloodline must be severed, or they will never sleep peacefully... I, Li Zhouming... I, Li Zhouming, am nothing but bait..."

"Grandfather... the King of Wei... he is the reason. He is the one who is despised..."

Li Zhouming's face was ashen. He seemed exhausted, his expression drifting into a daze as his lips barely moved.

"Father... Brother... heh..."

Li Suining stood frozen, a cold sweat covering his entire body as he watched the pale man before him. When Li Zhouming's eyes drifted shut as if in sleep, Li Suining was struck with sudden terror. He dropped to his knees, shouting, "Fifth Grand-Uncle! Fifth Grand-Uncle!"

A dark trickle of blood ran from the man's nose. He slowly pitched forward, slumping against Li Suining’s chest.

Li Suining's pupils dilated to their absolute limit. The young man, who had always been so calm and iron-willed, who had walked through mountains of corpses and seas of blood, finally broke. He let out a raw, gut-wrenching wail.

"The Wanling... the Wanling Flower... it's gone! Grand-Uncle!"

The man in his arms grew weaker, his breath shallow, his words fracturing into nonsense.

"The old... times... where... where did they go..."

"Fifth Grand-Uncle!"

...

The spring air held a biting chill.

The lamps in the house had been extinguished long ago. In the gloom, the open doors of the cabinets on either side of the room revealed stacks upon stacks of Daoist texts, their titles barely visible.

The dark room was silent save for the faint, steady breathing from the bed, the sound of footsteps outside, and, further in the distance, the thin, reedy sound of a faraway melody.

"Sincerity... beloved... immortal..."

The footsteps outside stopped abruptly, followed by a child's clear voice.

"Ning'er!"

The calls continued, muffled and indistinct. On the bed, a boy on the cusp of adolescence tossed and turned. He seemed trapped in a nightmare, struggling to wake but unable to open his eyes.

_Creak!_

The door was suddenly thrust open with a piercing shriek of wood on wood. A child of perhaps eight or nine years old burst in, his face beaming.

"Ning'er!"

He had barely stepped inside when an elderly nanny rushed in behind him, panting and sweating. Her face fell. "Do not disturb your brother!" she hissed.

The sharp command was like a clap of thunder, finally shattering the nightmare. The boy's eyes fluttered open. The snowy landscape vanished. Li Zhouming was gone. He was dazed.

'It was a dream... I'm not dead... I actually dreamed of Grand-Uncle Zhouming...'

He wasn't surprised. Li Zhouming's death had been a profound shock; dreaming of it was only natural. But in that hazy moment, a sharp spike of confusion pierced his thoughts.

'Can Lufu... didn't he unleash the Lush Sea? How am I alive?'

'Wait... since I began cultivating, how long has it been since I last had a dream?!'

In a fraction of a second, the boy on the bed vaulted into a sitting position. His eyes snapped open, shining like cold stars, radiating a killing intent so sharp and frigid it seemed to stab the air.

"Who!"

The gaze struck the old nanny like a blow, sending a chill through her entire body. Her mind raced.

'Young Master... what's wrong with him? Can he possibly harbor such hatred for his father?'

She quickly bowed. "Young Master... I apologize for disturbing your rest..."

But as she bowed, Li Suining's focus had shifted. His gaze locked onto the small child, his pupils rapidly contracting.

"You... Kuan'er..."

He raised his head, his eyes sweeping across the room's furnishings with stunned disbelief. He took in every detail, a hot rush of blood stinging his nose. His expression suddenly went flat.

'This... this is... Dongyi Prefecture...'

He shut his eyes, feigning drowsiness, but behind his closed lids, he was frantically assessing his surroundings and the pitifully weak well of Spiritual Qi within his body. He remembered it all!

'This is... Tingzhou, Moongaze Lake...'

No matter how much torment he had endured, no matter how many sleepless nights he had spent staring out at the wind and rain, he had always forced himself to remember his time on the lake. As he lay dying in the Lush Sea, this very scene had flashed before his eyes, but it had never felt this real.

'It seems... it's really happening...'

He asked no questions about the year, nor did he show any undue alarm. After that first moment of shock, he forced himself to sit calmly. "Brother," he said, his voice strained, "did you come to find me? Is something wrong at home?"

The nanny's heart sank, knowing the secret was out. As she feared, Li Suikuan grinned. "I came to find you, brother! I just heard that Grand-Aunt from the lake is coming to shore! I ran right over to tell you!"

'Grand-Aunt... That's right... At this time, she's still alive... still a high-level Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator...'

He stood up, dazed, and took two stumbling steps. He walked out the door, lifting his head, breathing in the lakeside breeze that made his heart tremble. He looked up at the sky.

There was only a single, brilliant sun.

The Martial Cultivation Star, the one that shone day and night, illuminating the entire land, was nowhere to be seen.

His heart instantly hammered against his ribs, threatening to leap from his throat. Hot blood rushed to his face, stinging his eyes.

'The Great Song has not been founded. The Shu dynasty's reign is not yet begun... I am fifteen years old... It is still five full years until the first year of Siwu, when the Yang family will ascend the throne...'

'This year, the Great Daoist Master has not yet been named King of Wei. The Compassion has not arrived. The Changhe Rebellion has not happened... Guest Retainer Ding should still be on the lake, and that man surnamed Wang has not yet reached the Purple Mansion Realm...'

'My family... my family hasn't even reached its zenith. We haven't seen the days of flowering brocade and oil-fueled fires. The miracle of 'Four Purple Mansions in one family' hasn't happened yet—and more importantly, the fall has not begun... the long, slow decline into ruin, ending with our annihilation in the Southern Borderlands...'

'There's still time... Daoist Master Zhaojing will appear on the lake. She hasn't left for the West Sea. There is still time for everything...'

A thousand thoughts raged through his mind, but he ruthlessly suppressed them. The skills he had honed over long years of wind and snow, of burying his thoughts and masking his intentions, suddenly served an unexpected purpose. He became preternaturally calm.

'I must not expose myself. Even if the King of Wei said that the peaks were blessed by Mount Dali and protected by the Azure Insight Origin Mirror, preventing the great powers from prying... I cannot afford to underestimate them.'

Li Suining's thoughts had taken only an instant. He turned back, a smile spreading across his face.

"This is wonderful news!"

Li Suikuan pouted, and for a moment, Li Suining's gaze softened.

His own father had died young, and his grand-uncle, Li Chengzai, was utterly useless. The entire Yuanwan Branch was filled with mediocrity. But extremes often produce their opposite. In the 'Sui' generation, the two brothers who could cultivate, Li Suikuan and himself, were both exceptional. Li Chengzai couldn't stand to see him succeed, but Li Suikuan, who was clever, had always secretly sided with him. After the battle for the Wei capital, when the Second Manifestation appeared, he had managed to escape. But his younger brother had died in the fighting, his body left forever at the foot of that mountain.

'The clansmen always blamed him for his ancestor's failings. He never dared to return to the lake, and at the foot of that mountain, he never retreated a single step...'

In his past life, only Li Chengzai had known their Grand-Aunt Li Minggong was coming. He had told only Li Suikuan to prepare. But his brother had secretly run to tell him. Li Suining had immediately canceled his plans for the autumn hunt and was thus able to meet her. Because of that, both brothers were permitted to enter the island together. If he had been even a few days late, he might still have met his Second Uncle, Li Jianglong, but he almost certainly would have missed the opportunity to meet Li Ximing.

It was also because of Li Suikuan that he later refrained from settling the score with that idiot Li Chengzai. But that was a story for another time.

He just smiled. "Thank you, brother... I actually just promised a few friends I'd go to the autumn hunt today!"

Ignoring the nanny, the boy walked forward quickly, took his younger brother's hand, and led him out. They walked to the residence diagonally opposite theirs. Li Suining calculated the time and smiled.

"You go on in. It wouldn't be right for me to arrive empty-handed. I'll be right behind you."

Li Suikuan nodded and pushed the door open. Li Suining quickly circled around, grabbed a few pieces of fruit from nearby, and then fixed his gaze on the sky. He waited until a brilliant beam of True Fire descended into the courtyard. Only then did he step forward and knock.

"Is the master at home? Suining has come to pay his respects!"

The door opened with a soft creak. Inside, the entire room was kneeling. In the center stood a woman in palace attire, her bearing elegant and dignified, her aura gentle yet imposing. A faint aura of True Fire shimmered around her, and her eyes held an imperious light that was deeply compelling.

It was Li Minggong.

Feigning astonishment, he immediately bowed low. "Greetings, Grand-Aunt!"

Li Minggong nodded at him, her gaze sweeping over the simple fruit in his hands. "You must be Second Brother's descendant... Suining, is it?"

"Yes..."

Seeing her alive, Li Suining felt his eyes burn.

After the Great Song was founded, the Li clan had known little peace. Though their fame spread across the lands during the long years of war, and many held high positions... in the end, the great masters fell, one by one.

During the three wars between Shu and Song over Guyan, Li Xinghan and Li Minggong had both perished. The Zhuang family was annihilated. Li Minggong herself had been surrounded by five enemies. Her crimson fire had blazed across the great desert, a solitary plume of True Fire, until it was extinguished. That news had finally broken the old family head. He had coughed up blood, taken to his bed, and never risen again.

Li Suining took one look and lowered his head, his excitement still within the bounds of normality. Li Minggong looked away from him and spoke to Li Chengzai, who was kneeling nearby.

"I am taking the two children," she stated.

The middle-aged man's eyes flickered toward Li Suining, then quickly back. He looked ecstatic. "Yes... Thank you, Elder Sister! Thank you, Elder Sister..."

Li Minggong could never bring herself to be truly harsh with her own family. Even though she was thoroughly disappointed in Li Chengzai, her tone was merely cold. "You are not young anymore. Stop scheming and causing trouble. Try to leave some dignity for the younger generation."

She lifted the two boys with her True Fire and rose into the sky. Li Suikuan, flying for the first time, was a mixture of joy and terror. Li Suining, long accustomed to it, was lost in thought.

'In my past life, I was too naive and didn't notice. But hearing her now, it's obvious Grand-Aunt knew a great deal about what was going on...'

Li Minggong did not stop there. She flew to several other towns, ensuring that the main family branches were all sending their children to the lake properly, without any bias or suppression. Only after gathering a number of children did she fly back toward the great lake.

Li Suining kept his head slightly bowed. He saw his brothers and sisters from his past life board the platform of fire, one by one. As he matched their faces to his memories, he realized with a pang of grief that nearly half of them would not even survive to adulthood, dying long before their time.

He silently held Li Suikuan's hand as the family's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array appeared before them. Gazing at the mystical, purple-gold pillars wreathed in immortal mist, an infinite hope kindled in his heart.

'This life... will be different.'

He began to plan with cold precision.

'My cultivation was too slow... In my past life, it was far too slow. I must advance at a speed that will force the family masters to take my words seriously. Only then can I make a difference at the critical moments... and only then can I... uncover the truth behind everything.'

'Opportunities... I need opportunities... I'm afraid I will have to go to the Northern Sea. But it's too far. I must reach the Foundation Establishment Realm at the very least, just to have a chance of making it back alive!'

He had always been the most outstanding cultivator of the 'Sui' generation, strong in both combat and talent. His previous life, spent walking through mountains of corpses and seas of blood, had forged his mind into something calm and ruthless. It was that strength that had allowed him to bear the painful witness of his family's decline and destruction, and to finally earn Li Zhouming's trust.

'Until I reach Foundation Establishment... I can only rely on the family. I cannot be the humble, confused child I was in my past life. I must fight. I must contend. I must make the masters change their opinion of the Yuanwan Branch... and do it much sooner.'

'And... I must find a way... to save Ding Weizeng first. With that great general alive, it will be an enormous advantage for the future!'

His gaze was heavy, his mind deep in plotting. He was completely unaware that in the Great Void far above, threads of illusory, multicolored light were weaving together, reflecting his presence like water reflecting slivers of silver.

As he left the protection of the southern shore, a divine, searching power that had been hovering nearby instantly descended. It swept into his mind without hindrance, reading his memories one by one.

The power lingered until he passed into the mists of the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. Only then, having found nothing unusual, did it silently retreat. The changes in the Great Void subsided, fading back into emptiness.

...

### Gardenia Scenery Mountain

The sky was bright, and white petals drifted down like snow.

Two Daoist Masters sat facing each other. One, dressed in white and gold, sipped his tea without a word. The other, in green robes with a sword at his hip, had a far more relaxed air.

"Simin Prefecture has fallen as well?" the white-gold robed man asked.

Si Yuanli, looking quite composed, nodded. "It was your family's Jiangliang who was stationed there. Chen Wenyao is heading east. His target must be Linhai Prefecture."

"Linhai Prefecture..." Li Ximing mused. "The Great Xiukui Monastery has been in seclusion for many years. Linhai is still governed by the various local families. Though they've consolidated into a few larger clans, they are hardly a match for the current Chen Wenyao... It will be recovered by the master soon enough."

"Correct," Si Yuanli agreed. "Once that area is recovered, Purple Smoke will not be far behind. The general framework of Yue State is already taking shape. Hengzhu has fled into a Blessed Land. A few Guest Retainers from the Bi family and some members with diluted bloodlines are trying to manage the situation, but they'll be swept aside in an instant."

"But if Purple Smoke is recovered, I fear they will set their sights on the Wilderness."

Seeing Si Yuanli's worried expression, Li Ximing simply shook his head. "It matters not."

Si Yuanli nodded, then smiled. "The matter you asked me to look into... after all these years, I finally have news!"

"Oh?" Li Ximing's interest was piqued. "Is it Daoist Master Zhusheng?"

"Precisely!" Si Yuanli grinned, a hint of pride in his voice. "I couldn't find him anywhere in Shahuan. I searched for ages, but finally located him at a friend's residence in the Northern Sea. He was helping his friend refine talismans... He was overjoyed to receive your message."

"He also asked me to inquire with Zhaojing... about that Courtly Red Dust Qi..."

Courtly Red Dust Qi was difficult to collect. They had given a portion to the Purple Smoke Gate long ago, but now held two portions in reserve, which was more than enough for Zhusheng. Li Ximing nodded. "Does the Daoist Master have anything good to offer?"

Si Yuanli leaned in. "He has a lead on a Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough and a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource, Sub-Manifestation Platinum!"

"What!"

Li Ximing was genuinely stunned. The Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough was a famous Bright Yang spiritual item, one of the very first he had ever learned about!

Si Yuanli had expected this reaction. "This was something a Daoist Master under the command of the North Star Lady acquired from a grotto-heaven belonging to the Encompassing Profoundity tradition. In this day and age, the Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough is beyond rare. Every one used is one less in the world. It's even more precious than the Radiant Sky Stone was!"

Li Ximing knew this. It was far more valuable than any Li Fire spiritual item. It was easily one of the top three materials for forging Bright Yang spiritual armor. And on top of that, there was also the Sub-Manifestation Platinum!

Torn between regret that this opportunity hadn't come sooner and excitement, he asked, "Did Fellow Daoist Zhu say when he might acquire them?"

Si Yuanli considered this. "It will take at least ten days to half a month. He still needs to gather the resources for the trade... He said he will come to find you personally when he has them!"

"No rush, no rush!"

Since it was a Bright Yang item, Li Ximing could ask Qize about it first. At worst, he'd have to pay Dingyang Zi a higher fee. Even if it was too late for his own armor, it had many other uses—Li Zhouwei still needed a spiritual weapon, after all!

He was in an excellent mood, and Si Yuanli was pleased to have earned such a significant favor. Both parties were satisfied. Li Ximing retrieved a jade box from his sleeve and placed it on the table.

"Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder," he said simply. "Six pills."

Si Yuanli was overjoyed. He quickly opened the box. Inside, six pills rested neatly, emitting a faint cyan glow. It was indeed the Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder!

"Fellow Daoist's skill in alchemy is truly astounding!"

He was well aware that Li Ximing kept a portion for himself—that was the standard arrangement. If he had tried to refine it himself, he would have been lucky to get three pills... how could he complain about receiving six? It was a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Li Ximing, however, was hopeful. "This is the second batch you've had me refine from your Hollow-heart Profound Mulberry, correct? It seems you still have more on hand?"

Si Yuanli had inherited the vast wealth of the Sima Family; he was practically swimming in resources. This was already the second time he had come to refine the Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder—a pill whose primary ingredient was a spiritual item!

"This is really the last of it!" Si Yuanli smiled, his words only half-true.

Li Ximing figured there would be more business in the future. Satisfied, he watched as the Daoist Master quickly took his leave and departed on the wind.

Li Ximing then flicked his own sleeve, producing a small jade vial. It, too, contained Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder.

He could refine a full eight pills in one batch. After giving six to Si Yuanli, he had managed to save up four pills from the two sessions. He had consumed one himself recently, leaving him with three.

He gazed at the Immortal Foundation coalescing within his Qihai, a touch of regret in his heart.

'World's Radiance... It's truly not easy.'

While Li Zhouwei had been in seclusion healing for the past five years, Li Ximing had successfully cultivated his 'World's Radiance' Immortal Foundation to perfection and pushed it into his Shengyang Acupoint. But, just as he had feared, the attempt to elevate it had failed.

Though his hopes were dashed, Li Ximing wasn't overly dismayed. In fact, the failure had answered a question that had been weighing on him:

'Even if the elevation of the Immortal Foundation fails, the Profound Pattern Vase within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance _still_ releases Talisman Qi to bless the Immortal Foundation!'

He had expected this, but when the wisp of Talisman Qi had actually descended onto his foundation, he had been overcome with relief and joy.

'From now on, I don't need to be so hesitant!'

The only downside was the loss of one portion of Luminous Heart Origin Qi. Fortunately, the Courtly Red Dust Qi had been valuable back then, and Tinglan's Luminous Heart Origin Qi had come in a set of three. He still had enough for now.

'With the Purple Smoke Gate blockaded, that resource supply is cut off... Zhouwei succeeded on his very first try. Surely I won't fail all three attempts... This is only for my second divine ability. Three failures... for any other Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, that would mean thirty to fifty years vanishing in the blink of an eye...'

A flicker of anxiety passed through him, but he quickly composed himself.

"And with the Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder to assist, the time it takes to re-condense the Immortal Foundation is extremely short... At the absolute worst, I'll just swap out the Clear-Through Eternal Celebration Scripture in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance."

In any case, the matter of the spiritual armor could not be delayed. He called out, "Is Minggong still on the lake?"

A voice immediately answered from below. "Reporting to the Daoist Master... Lady Minggong has gone to the lake's perimeter..."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

The attendant, knowing his station, was quick-witted and of good standing. He hastily elaborated, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, in a few days, it will be time for the new disciples to enter the island to cultivate. Her ladyship has likely gone to the shore to receive them early!"

"Oh?" A nostalgic look crossed Li Ximing's face. "That would be the 'Sui' generation, wouldn't it? Minggong has always been so dedicated..."

Li Minggong had always been responsible for liaising with Sun-Worshipping Mountain. First, her status was sufficient for the task, and second, she was familiar with them. Li Ximing had never bothered to replace her. He smiled and rose to his feet, placing the jade slip in his hand back on the desk.

"Perfect," he said with interest. "I'll go and take a look."

# Chapter 994: Crimson Radiance

Brilliant radiance and pristine white light illuminated the path. After passing under the five-story platform of the side tower, a circular dais, one hundred and seventy feet wide, came into view. A gallery walkway, like a floating bridge, led past a grand hall of seven bays and twelve opposing towers before one finally arrived at the Crimson Radiance Hall.

The Crimson Radiance Hall was situated in the northern part of Tingzhou, second only to the main palace. It was a recent construction, built by Li Jiangzong to signify his subordinate position. Later, when the Li family was enfeoffed as rulers of Wei, Li Jianglong, also not daring to occupy the primary seat, moved here as well. Gradually, this place became the center of power for both Moongaze Lake and Tingzhou.

Though not yet as illustrious as it would one day become, the Crimson Radiance Hall was already taking shape. Li Suining, being the eldest of the children, walked closely behind Li Minggong. As they approached the pavilion, a long-robed old man stepped out to greet them, his face wreathed in smiles.

"Greetings, my lady!"

"Elder Qu, you are too kind," Li Minggong replied with a respectful smile.

The old man sighed. "To see another batch of children arrive… It feels like only yesterday that Jiangzong and the others were this small. I wonder how many more times this old man will get to see this sight…"

'Qu Bushi…'

Li Suining recognized him with a single glance and quickly lowered his head.

The old man had come from Jiangbei, having devoted his entire life to serving the Family Heads. His own strength was lacking, but he excelled at managing spirit fields and had no need for combat. When chaos later engulfed the lake, he was away and thus spared. He had wandered from place to place, gathering news, and somehow managed to find his way to the Southern Borderlands.

But his power was negligible, and he had no special skills or backing. When he reached Black Lacquer Ridge, he stumbled upon the Black Ape King on patrol. Though he invoked the Li family's name, it was useless in those days. He was captured with ease and thrown into the Black Ape King’s dharma artifact, the Pit Water Gorge, where his life ended amidst cruel laughter, dissolving into dust and blood.

The memory had been a source of deep regret for Zhouming, and for Li Suining, it was a source of helpless, gnashing hatred. Seeing the old man now, standing before the hall with his hands tucked in his sleeves and a smile on his face, Li Suining looked up and returned the smile with a respectful bow.

"Greetings, Senior Qu!"

Qu Bushi gave him a slightly surprised look, nodded repeatedly, and then raised an eyebrow.

"Go on inside, all of you…"

The children, big and small, filed in like a line of fish. Qu Bushi, however, held Li Minggong back. His expression turned serious. "Jiangzong is looking for you! The Second Young Master has come out of seclusion. Your timing is perfect!"

"Oh?" Li Minggong's eyes lit up, and she quickened her pace into the hall.

Li Suining had already reached the front of the hall. He lifted the hem of his robe and knelt, catching a glimpse of the two figures within.

One was dressed in predominantly white robes, with a collar of orange-yellow fabric. The cuffs of his sleeves were embroidered with patterns of True Fire and sparrows. His gaze was bright, and though his upper lip was still bare, he wore a stern expression.

This was the head of their affairs—Li Jiangzong, the only man of the Jiangque generation who was not a direct descendant of the Bright Yang line yet possessed outstanding ability.

This clan uncle had once been praised by the King of Wei as being "magnanimous, respectful, and diligent, sufficient to carry on the legacy." He had served as the Clan Justicar in Qingdu for many years, managing the internal affairs of the lake with meticulous order. During the Li family's decline, he had navigated complex relationships, calling in favors and coordinating with Zhouluo to ensure the survival of their bloodline.

Li Suining lowered his eyes slightly but couldn't resist turning his head to discreetly study the other man.

This man was robed in crimson, and a profound cultivation base caused a dazzling, golden-red light to shimmer around him. He sat in the main seat with a frown, a scroll in his hands, his gaze distant.

Beneath his brows was a pair of brilliant golden eyes!

'The Second Young Master…'

A fire ignited in Li Suining’s heart.

In the Li family’s golden age, they were known for having four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in a single generation, with three holding pivotal posts in the court. This Second Young Master was one of those three: Li Jianglong—Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, Emissary of the Palace of Revering Martial Arts, Prefect of Jiangjuan Prefecture, with a fief of thirty-five hundred households, the Emissary of True Radiance and Cloud!

The Li Jianglong of today was not dressed in the robes of purple light and golden patterns, nor did he wear the sash of his high office. He was merely a cultivator at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Yet, when he opened those eyes, their brilliant golden gleam was enough to strike fear into anyone's heart!

'The Song Emperor produced three worthy heirs, yet even that was not enough to rival Wei… The radiance of that time… it was too blinding…'

A wave of sorrow washed over Li Suining, and he lowered his head in dejection. Yang Zhuo, the Emperor of Song, a great figure destined to become a True Monarch, had only three accomplished sons. At the time, the court lauded this achievement, yet it was one less than the four sons of the King of Wei, each said to be a dragon among men.

'Thinking back now… the elders must have had their reasons, things that we juniors couldn't see. We were bathed in their radiance and felt proud, never knowing that disaster was just around the corner…'

He knelt on the steps, his movements practiced and familiar, appearing calm and composed compared to the other children. Li Jiangzong raised an eyebrow, and just as he expected, the golden eyes looked over.

"This is…"

Li Jiangzong glanced at the list in his hand, found the boy's position, and answered, "From the Eastern Residence… part of Lady Minggong’s line. There's also Suikuan, the direct heir, who appears to have greater talent. After so many years, their branch is finally showing signs of prosperity."

Li Jianglong understood from that single sentence that he was being tactful. Li Minggong was unmarried and childless; it wasn’t appropriate to call them her line. They were descendants of Li Xixuan.

'Unfortunately, that old man led the way back then, and the Eastern Residence was torn apart by my elder brother's schemes. Their origins are now tainted. This Li Suining is better off… Li Suikuan must be a descendant of Li Chengzai, from the main household… which makes things even more awkward.'

Li Jiangzong had deliberately omitted Li Xixuan's name to protect the two boys from the past's influence, but Li Jianglong understood perfectly. He lowered his head, took a sip of tea, and cast a glance in their direction, nodding silently to himself.

Below, Li Suining remained motionless, waiting in silence until everyone had assembled. Suddenly, a brilliant radiance flashed through the hall as a multicolored light converged, bringing a profound stillness. Everyone present was startled and bowed in unison.

"We greet the Daoist Master!"

Li Suining raised his head slightly and saw a platinum-colored figure now occupying the main seat. He dropped his head like a bolt of lightning, prostrating himself on the steps, unwilling to rise.

The Daoist Master stood before the steps, a faint smile on his face, and spoke in a leisurely tone. "Rise. There is no need for such ceremony."

The cultivators rose, the atmosphere turning solemn. A divine ability resided within the Daoist Master, and even without him speaking, an invisible pressure filled the hall. Li Ximing sat down in the main seat, his gaze sweeping over the children. He nodded.

"Excellent. These children all possess considerable talent."

Ever since the Chengming generation was cut down by the river, the Li family's succeeding generations had failed to flourish. Geniuses were few and far between. Both the Zhouxing and Jiangque generations seemed lackluster. If not for Li Zhouwei and Li Que'wan, who was brought back from the lakeside, there was only Li Jiangzong… a man of unique character, hard to judge. His talent was comparable to Li Chenghui's, but whether in experience or fortune, the current him was far inferior.

But now, looking out, he saw three to five children worthy of nurturing, and even some with truly exceptional talent that brought joy to his heart. How could Li Ximing not be delighted? His gaze swept across them but paused first on the face of a youth below, noticing his golden eyes. He pointed with a smile.

"You must be Suihuan?"

The youth had handsome eyes and brows, and his golden eyes shone with a noble air. He stepped forward and spoke respectfully, "Suihuan greets the Daoist Master!"

The youth was indeed Li Suihuan, Li Jianglong's own son. A part of the reason Li Jianglong had come out of seclusion was for his child.

His name was personally bestowed by Li Ximing. By now, he was thirteen years old, the eldest son of the Bright Yang bloodline, ranked fourth in the Sui generation. His cultivation speed was the fastest; he had already reached the Qi Refining realm, cultivating the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination.

With both Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei having reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the resources available to the family's disciples had improved dramatically. Starting their training at six, with sufficient cultivation methods and resources, Li Suihuan had completed the six cycles of Embyronic Breathing in six years, one per year. If not for the high difficulty of the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination, he would have broken through even sooner.

Standing before the other disciples now, he had an air of distinction that made the other cultivators take notice and brought a smile to Li Ximing's face.

"You have your father's bearing… With such talent and grace, not even the direct descendants of an immortal sect could compare!"

Li Suihuan was young, but not timid. Facing the stares of the assembled cultivators and the gaze of the Daoist Master, he raised his head, his eyes bright, and replied, "Which immortal sect's descendant would have dared to face my grandfather's halberd back then? As a descendant of the White Qilin, I will spread radiance for a thousand miles, elevate the Shengyang Acupoint, and bring brilliance to Moongaze. My divine ability will not be limited to two generations."

The cultivators exchanged astonished glances. A smile touched Li Minggong's lips. Li Jianglong’s eyelid twitched as he frowned slightly. Li Ximing, however, simply raised his eyebrows and laughed.

"Lofty aspirations."

"Come!"

He took a jade box from his sleeve and placed it in Li Suihuan's hands. "This is family's Li Fire dharma artifact, called the Splendor of Li-Light," he said with a smile. "I had it commissioned in my leisure time to test some divine abilities and spell arts. Now that I am finished with it, I give it to you… as an encouragement."

For a moment, the hall was filled only with the boy's thanks and the murmurs of admiration from the onlookers. Li Suining stood to the side, his head bowed. Hearing Li Ximing’s praise, he felt no envy, only a complex mix of emotions.

'Fourth Brother…'

Li Suihuan’s words were no idle boast, nor were they mere empty rhetoric. Later, even after the Eldest Young Master broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, people still spoke of his 'divine ability of two generations'. His fourth brother's own cultivation speed was incredibly fast. By the time the immortal decree reached the lake, his immortal foundation was perfected, his secret arts mastered, and he was but a single step away from the Purple Mansion Realm.

But… who could have imagined that the Li family, then at its zenith, would meet such an end?

He raised his head slightly, not daring to look directly at Li Ximing. Listening to his gratified tone, and perhaps because of his own foreknowledge, he sensed that Li Ximing's joy was not as deep as it appeared.

Li Ximing quickly turned his head, looked down, and pointed to Li Suikuan nearby. "And you are…"

"This junior is Suikuan… a disciple of the Yuanwan branch!" the boy immediately knelt and answered with utmost respect.

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully. "Impressive!"

In his past life, he had been naive, but now Li Suining understood perfectly. The reason Li Suikuan was singled out was because he appeared to be the most outstanding among the children—a fact he owed entirely to his foolish old grand-uncle, Li Chengzai.

That old man knew nothing of cultivation but was willing to put in the effort. He had called in favors to get spiritual resources from several Guest Retainers and had given them to Li Suikuan early on. For someone at Li Suikuan’s low level of Embyronic Breathing, it was like feeding a prized peony to an ox. How could a Daoist Master not see through it? On the surface, Li Suikuan's talent seemed far superior to Li Suining's, but Suining himself knew they were more or less equal.

Just as he expected, the Daoist Master's gaze swept past Suikuan and landed squarely on him.

Even though this was his second life, his awe of a Purple Mansion cultivator and his reverence for his own Daoist Master had not diminished in the slightest. Li Suining’s heart leaped into his throat. Li Ximing's gaze lingered on him for a moment before Li Minggong's gentle voice sounded from the side.

"This is Suining. His father was Jiangwu, who once cultivated the Xiaoshi Mountain Dao Lineage. He was severely injured by a Merging Fire during the turmoil in the Wilderness and passed away not long after. His grandfather, Li Zhouhuan, died of old age by the lake. He is the second son of my second elder brother, Li Chengdu."

This was the reason for Li Minggong’s kinder treatment of him. Li Ximing focused his gaze on the boy and smiled.

"Fourth level of Embyronic Breathing?"

Li Suining suppressed his excitement and answered respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, it has been half a year."

"Good…" Li Ximing glanced at Li Jiangzong. "Go to the clan stores and collect a portion of resources and two pills. You may begin Qi Refining… Do you have any learned Daoist Traditions or skills you excel at?"

Li Suining took a step back, knelt, and bowed his head to the floor.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, this junior has studied formations… I hope to learn the Dao of Formations!"

Having lived two lives, Li Suining knew exactly what the family lacked most right now! He also knew how to reveal his talent. In his past life, nearly every member of the Sui generation had read books on the Dao of Formations, and a full three of his brothers had been assigned to study it!

'Our family's Dao of Alchemy is renowned, and our artifact forging, led by Uncle Jiangzong, is quickly making a name for itself. Only the Dao of Formations is lacking! This has been a persistent worry for the elders!'

"Oh?"

But as soon as the words left his mouth, the Daoist Master's eyes opened slightly, a light glinting within them as he looked on silently.

"The Eastern Residence has long lived outside the island. It seems they've built up some savings, to be dabbling in the Dao of Formations."

There was little joy in Li Ximing's heart. He watched with a cool gaze and glanced at Li Jiangzong, causing the young man's expression to shift and his brow to furrow.

Of course Li Ximing knew they lacked Formations Masters; he had just been discussing it with Li Jiangzong recently. He had not expected to hear such an answer from Li Suining. He had been asking about skills with the saber, spear, or staff! How could a disciple from the declining, lakeside Eastern Residence, whose fourth-level Embyronic Breathing was already the result of constant effort, possibly have the energy to spare for the Hundred Arts of Cultivation? Let alone the Dao of Formations, which required expensive formation flags just to begin! Yet this boy had pinpointed the very talent the family was most desperate for and was preparing to cultivate… claiming to have 'some study' in it. How could it not be suspicious? He knew just how far those below him would go to curry favor.

Though he spoke no cold words, the mere presence of his suspicion instantly chilled the radiance in the hall. The atmosphere froze. The color drained from Li Minggong’s face, her eyes filled with worry.

The mood of a Purple Mansion cultivator with a divine ability could affect the very climate of a place. Most children, faced with such a scene, would have burst into tears and confessed everything. Li Suining, however, remained unfazed.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, when my grandfather passed away, I once came to the lake alone and met Dharma Protector Ren. My father once served under him, and they had a friendship of sorts. When he heard I possessed a spiritual aptitude, he gave me the various manuals my father left behind to take back and read. Among my father's belongings was a book, _A Comprehensive Guide to the Dao of Formations_."

"I was captivated by it and could not put it down… That was nearly ten years ago."

How could an ordinary child lie in his presence? Seeing the boy's unflinching expression, Li Ximing was already mostly convinced. His expression softened slightly, and he spoke in a neutral tone. "Oh? It must have been difficult for you, without any formation flags."

Li Ximing was right. In his previous life, Li Suining's perseverance was astonishing. He had studied the text for six or seven years, if not a full decade. But without formation flags, starting was incredibly difficult. Though the experience was beneficial for his future cultivation of the Dao of Formations, even on the day he first stood before this grand hall, his understanding was still hazy and nascent. He had never made a real breakthrough and hadn't dared to mention it, simply saying he would accept whatever arrangements were made.

But the him of today had a firm and calm gaze. He simply bowed again before rising to his feet and speaking with reverence.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, other objects can be used as substitutes."




# Chapter 995: Formation Cultivation

Hearing this, Li Ximing sat up a little straighter. He looked at the boy, who was merely at the Embyronic Breathing realm, and smiled.

"Oh?"

Li Suining raised his brows and bowed. "Reporting to the Daoist Master: formation flags are the foundation for setting up a formation, but they are not the key to learning formations. If the inscribed formation patterns are accurate and logical, infusing them with dharma power will also reveal a complete and harmonious resonance... This can be used to verify what one has learned."

Li Ximing was not skilled in formations, but with his high Dao-Profundity, he naturally understood the boy's words with ease.

Formation flags were not only the critical nodes of a grand formation but also its most crucial hubs. Even with a minimum of six flags, one could use dharma power to probe for problems in the patterns and complete the inscription. However, even without flags, if the formation was inscribed to perfection from the start, it would naturally exhibit a unique resonance when stimulated by dharma power.

This principle was remarkably similar to how Li Xuanxuan used to practice drawing talismans by diluting spiritual ink with water during the Li family's poorer, early years. But the Dao of formations was not like the Dao of talismans. The formation eyes, patterns, base, and platform had to correspond to the interplay of Daoist Traditions above and align with the spiritual opportunity of the earth veins below. At advanced levels, it even touched upon the hidden secrets of ancient prosperity and decline. The precise sequence and staggering of the inscriptions were immensely complex, and a single attempt could take ten days to half a month.

Therefore, among all the arts, talismans were the cheapest, used by commoners and rogue cultivators. Alchemy was the most expensive, favored by newly risen great families. Artifact refining prioritized Dao Lineage and was often passed down by an elder. The Dao of formations, however, required deep Dao-Profundity and was typically only cultivated by immortal sects.

Without flags, hundreds or thousands of errors could be clustered together. Even if you knew something was wrong, you wouldn't know where the error was. If he wasn't a genius, how could he possess such an ability?

He merely nodded with intrigued interest, a pleased look on his face. He glanced at the relieved Li Jiangzong and said, "Go and bring the Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags."

Li Jiangzong quickly agreed and went down personally. Li Ximing smiled. "A Comprehensive Guide to the Dao of Formations... which Daoist tradition does it belong to?"

Li Minggong took a step forward and spoke in a gentle voice, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, the family's formations are managed by Guest Retainer Huang from Jiangbei. Some years ago, he was ordered to collect the family's many formation fragments and compiled them into A Comprehensive Guide to the Dao of Formations. It has nine volumes in total. Jiangwu and the others have all taken the first three volumes back with them."

Li Ximing nodded and asked, "Is he still managing the family's formations now?"

Li Minggong quickly shook her head and said respectfully, "Five years ago... Guest Retainer Huang failed his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm... and perished. The dao inheritance of formations is currently managed by Steward Tian Ling and the master of the Precious Array Pavilion, He Junxiu. Their skills in formations are acceptable, but they do not compare to Guest Retainer Huang..."

Li Ximing shook his head inwardly, knowing that the family's dao inheritance of formations had truly fallen into decline.

Li Suining listened to the names, finding them all very familiar. He knew Old Tian (Tian Ling) and Pavilion Master He well in his previous life. After Li Ximing brought back the inheritance of Daoist Master Yuanbian, Li Suining and Pu Xinya took over the Precious Array Pavilion, but these two elders still handled many of the miscellaneous tasks.

Later, after Tingzhou was conquered and enfeoffed, he heard news of this Pavilion Master He even in the Southern Borderlands. The He family had been granted the Western Ting Prefecture, and this Pavilion Master He had become a Family Head himself.

He held no resentment over this; instead, he felt a sense of calm acceptance. After all, the tides of fate were vast, and few could remain untouched. The He family had originally been the local tyrants of the west bank. Their power was curtailed under the Li family's rule, but they had remained law-abiding and fulfilled all their duties. He didn't end up like Tian Ling, who committed suicide in front of the pavilion. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, it was normal for him to surrender.

In the span of that thought, Li Jiangzong had already returned from outside the hall. He held a jade box the color of emerald. The lid was open, revealing twelve formation flags resting inside. They had a purple base adorned with star-like patterns and radiated a gentle glow.

The Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags!

Li Ximing smiled. "These Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags were a congratulatory gift from Quan Yuduan, the disciple of brother Xizhi... from back when Minghuang achieved the Purple Mansion Realm. Although they are only twelve Qi Refining flags, they are quite unique, not inferior to an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact. It was a kind gesture from him, but they were stored away in the clan and never put to use."

Li Suining was overjoyed. He quickly bowed low and said respectfully, "I will definitely not fail the Daoist Master's trust!"

Inwardly, he was thrilled. 'I've truly earned his regard!'

He knew that in his past life, Li Suining had never reached the point of being personally gifted formation flags by the Daoist Master. The two brothers had only received a few words of encouragement and were given dharma artifacts and resources from the clan... While also generous, it was far from the significance of the Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags!

Although the Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags eventually became his anyway... that didn't happen until he was in the mid-stage of Qi Refining and had begun to distinguish himself, by which time Yang Zhuo had already been enthroned for five years!

'It's just a pity... I'll have to wait until Daoist Master Zhaojing returns from the Eastern Sea and the family obtains the Sutra of Profound Iteration. Only then can I openly use the two auxiliary formations, Profound-Gathering and Treasure-Suspension, for my cultivation...'

While he was calculating in his mind, Li Ximing, having resolved a long-standing concern, was in a rare good mood. He beamed at the boy, finding the familiar, sharp aura between his brows more and more pleasing. He unexpectedly asked, "Do you have any thoughts? What are your aspirations for your cultivation?"

He was asking about his future divine ability and Dao Lineage!

Not only was Li Jiangzong slightly astonished, but Li Minggong was also both shocked and delighted. Even Li Suining himself was stunned for a moment!

One had to understand that one's immortal foundation and divine ability determined their future Dao path. Countless people in the family had stagnated because of this. Whether it was Li Minggong or, later, Li Zhouda, or even Ding Weizeng—the Palace-Yang Tiger who had never made a name for himself in the Great Song, much to Li Ximing's later regret—they all suffered from the same problem: a discontinued Dao Lineage.

To be asked this now was an excellent opportunity! The family's well-known Dao Lineages, like the Bright Yang Celestial Gate and the Dao of the Perilous Tread, were all lineages with a clear path to the Purple Mansion Realm. Because of his past life's memories, Li Suining was very familiar with the family's lineages. Besides Li Fire and Whole Pill, there was even the Lesser Yin Purple Mansion Dao.

But he did not ask for any of them. He bowed respectfully and replied, "This junior does not have a specific Dao Lineage in mind. But since I am cultivating the Dao of formations, my only desire is to establish a dao inheritance of formations for the family. I hope to cultivate Dao Lineage methods that aid the Dao of formations... As for the rest... I have no other requests!"

This was the truth. Bright Yang was definitely not suitable for him to cultivate again; even if he wanted to, Li Ximing would likely not grant it to him now. As for Li Fire and Whole Pill, neither was what he sought. The one he truly desired in his heart was a Heaven–Governing cultivation art called the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court.

In his past life, he entered the Milin Mountains, selected a cultivation art in the mountain's Dao palace, and later entered the island's secret hall. He deliberated for a long time, torn between the Celestial-Awakening Ear from the Art of the Watchful Awakening Star and the Profound Dipper's Balance from the Art of the Golden Tablet... In the end, he chose the Art of the Golden Tablet...

Later, the family obtained the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court, which shared the same origin as the Art of the Golden Tablet, and his Dao path advanced from then on. Unfortunately, he had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm by then, and his immortal foundation was ultimately a step behind.

Now, he remembered this scroll by heart, but he dared not use it, which was a vexing problem.

But regardless of the future, his current answer was excellent. Above him, Li Ximing heard his words, raised an eyebrow, and nodded in satisfaction, smiling.

"Good!"

He seemed about to say more, but his expression suddenly changed. He hastily set down his tea, shot a quick glance aside, and said, "It's rare for the family to produce a formation genius. I will remember your name!"

He said that one sentence, and there was nothing more. Li Ximing looked up, and without time for another word of instruction, he dissolved into light and vanished. This made Li Suining's heart tighten...

With the painful lessons of his previous life, even at his most triumphant moments, Li Suining always felt a precarious sense of danger, as if walking on thin ice. He felt a hidden unease. 'He must have urgent business... I just hope nothing terrible has happened!'

As soon as the Daoist Master left, the atmosphere in the hall relaxed. Li Jiangzong finally began the tedious tasks of compiling the register, calling the roll for the incense rites, and arranging the ancestral worship lines. Nearby, Li Minggong smiled and withdrew his gaze, looking over at Li Zhouxun on the other side. He saw the perennially silent, middle-aged man nod. "A clever child."

Although a Purple Mansion Realm inheritance wasn't something one could get just by asking, and while Li Suining had seemingly missed his chance, he would have opportunities in the future. But receiving a single "Good!" from Li Ximing was enough to guarantee him a place on the island—one had to know that even Li Zhouda, who was currently in the limelight... had never received such praise!

The two of them patiently watched the juniors below, carefully appraising each one. Seemingly satisfied, they soon left one after the other. But the ceremony in the hall had only just begun. It wasn't until four hours later, after the bell had rung three times, that Li Jiangzong breathed a sigh of relief. He finished arranging the clan's affairs and dismissed the children.

The group of children was mostly dazed and anxious; the younger ones had been standing so long their legs had turned to jelly. Li Suining simply led his younger brother away, whispering, "This is just the beginning. Our residence is the Bailian Pavilion at West Seventh Pillar. In three days, there's another clan event. All the elders and the old masters will be there. You must prepare well..."

In truth, the event in three days was the important one. Li Xuanxuan had always made a point of questioning each child individually. It was only Li Ximing's appearance today that made this preliminary ritual seem so unique.

Li Suining escorted his brother all the way back to the pavilion. After closing the door, he showed no intention of resting and immediately headed down from the attic room.

'The clan's medicinal pills will be granted soon, and I'll be qualified to assail the Qi Refining realm. I'll have to come to the island again then, which will waste several more days. I might as well use these three days... to go to the main hall and make my selection!'

He secretly reviewed his own words, thinking carefully. 'It's a good thing... the Daoist Master hasn't achieved the World's Radiance yet, so I can still have some small schemes in his presence. But... his aura is still incredibly powerful...'

As he mused, the image of Li Ximing rising in a hurry couldn't help but reappear in his mind, filling him with dread. 'Impossible... it can't be... It shouldn't be this early...'

... ...

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Li Ximing hurriedly materialized in a flash of light, stopping amidst the mountains. He immediately spotted the young man sitting at a table with a smile. He strode forward in just a few steps, exclaiming joyfully, "Minghuang, you've come out of seclusion!"

The golden-eyed young man at the table saw him, and the contemplative look on his face quickly faded, replaced by a smile. He rose quickly. "Greetings, Grand-Uncle!"

"Alright, alright..." The Daoist Master simply pulled the young man down to sit, began to brew tea for him, and laughed. "Do you have good news to share? If you don't, I certainly do!"

Li Zhouwei chuckled, his mood instantly lightening. "I was in seclusion healing my wounds, what good news could I have? I just borrowed the omen of success from Sovereign's Perilous Tread and the Pure Qi efficacy of the Profound Vastness Art to spend the last year and a half healing... I really should thank those two barbarians from the Xiangli family. With the aid from the Perilous Tread's success, I was saved a lot of time."

"The rest of the time... I refined my divine abilities and studied spell arts. Hardly counts as good news."

But Li Ximing laughed. He first took an item from his sleeve. It was round, like a Golden Core—it was the Spiritual Treasure, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

He introduced the Spiritual Treasure's many functions and passed it to Li Zhouwei. The young man accepted it and began to carefully read the Southern Li Ingestion Method contained within. After a long moment, a look of amazement crossed his face. "What a powerful Daoist text! If I cultivated Li Fire, reading this would be immensely beneficial!"

Li Ximing replied, "I copied a portion and sent it to Li Jiangqian's immortal abode. I also took advantage of a gap in news two years ago to ask about his progress. He has already finished cultivating the first secret art, Double Fire, and has begun the second, Heavenly Apricot."

Li Zhouwei was still very concerned about Li Jiangqian's progress. He nodded at the news but was noncommittal about the use of the Southern Li Ingestion Method. "For him to use the Southern Li Ingestion Method, he'd need to be at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm at minimum. It's useless for him to read it now. He's smart; he'll glance at it and not waste any more time. ...How is Que'Wan?"

Li Ximing grew serious. "She is at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, with Senior Changdie watching over her. News came some time ago. She has refined her cultivation and is working on the first secret art, Material Transformation. The Golden Book of Houshu is extremely difficult, so it's perfectly normal for her progress to be a step slower."

"They are all striving hard." The golden-eyed young man nodded. He then watched Li Ximing take two remaining Spiritual Artifacts from his sleeve and line them up on the table. He presented a purplish-gold thunder mace that flickered with violet-white electricity. "I've refined these Spiritual Artifacts over the past few days. This Demonbane Cleaver Mace is the most powerful!"

Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up. He took it as Li Ximing explained, "This mace commands thunder, suppresses and kills evil Demons, and has the effect of discerning ghosts and wickedness. It's a first-class offensive weapon... It's just a pity that the Demonbane Cleaver Mace favors wielders of Profound Thunder, and we don't cultivate Profound Thunder... Otherwise, with this weapon in hand, its might would be vastly greater!"

Li Zhouwei turned it over in his hands. It was heavy. "That's natural... Profound Thunder oversees the world. This fits the methods of the Thunder Palace."

As he communicated with it using his spiritual sense, Li Ximing introduced it from the side. "Exactly. This item has three divine abilities. The first is Thunder's Vigil. Once you wield this item and activate the ability, it will call down lightning in a hundred-mile radius... Even without a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator powering it, it still has considerable might, similar to the Huai River Map from back then, but more ferocious. It's suitable for guarding a region..."

"The second is Thunder-Quell. The Demonbane Cleaver Mace contains a secret light of heavenly thunder, which has a pulverizing effect. There are three levels in total. I've already tested it. If all three levels are unleashed, it can shatter the vast majority of spell lights and divine abilities."

"The third is more peculiar, called Cloud-Patrol. It has the ability to move with light and thunder, allowing it to accumulate thunderclouds in the sky. It gathers power bit by bit over time, with a three-day limit, to produce a single bolt of punitive lightning. The might is considerable... More importantly... if it strikes someone directly... it inflicts an overwhelming, unbearable pain that lingers for a very long time..."

After saying this, his expression turned slightly odd. He continued, "It's a good tool for ambushing someone. But in my opinion, it probably wasn't created to ambush anyone. Spiritual Artifacts often display greater power in the hands of people from the same Dao path and Dao Lineage. To me... this seems like a divine ability used for punishment..."

"That's not wrong," Li Zhouwei said thoughtfully. "Indeed, these three abilities are mostly supportive... Its primary power as a mace isn't fully displayed. The Demonbane Cleaver Mace... just from the 'cleaver' part of its name, it should have a divine ability specific to its Dao Lineage... We'll just have to see if our family's descendants have the good fortune to discover it."

His eyes brightened slightly. As he nodded, he infused his divine ability and dharma power into it. A seal-script character appeared on the hilt:

"Huan."




# Chapter 996: Journey to the Sea

Li Zhouwei released his hand, only to see Li Ximing present a jade talisman. He held it up, revealing the intricate patterns upon its surface, which flowed with the transcendent white light of the Capital Guard's Dao.

"This is a Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman," Li Ximing explained. "It's a Spiritual Artifact from an ancient tradition, the Garrison Profound Dao. Its primary function is an ability called 'Spirit-Summoning,' which can be used to command mountain ghosts and river spirits. In ancient times, when the world's order was more complete, these entities could even contend with beings on the level of the Merciful One."

"Nowadays… they're mostly just good for running errands. It's suitable for protecting the younger generation."

Li Ximing raised the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman and aimed it at the ground of Gardenia Scenery Mountain beneath their feet. He cast it down, stamped his foot, and intoned, "By tiered ranks of guardian spirits, I summon the Garrison Court!"

White smoke billowed upwards, and where the talisman landed, a figure materialized. It was a man of immense height, clad in black robes and armor, holding a spear. A golden-white radiance shone from him, and the aroma of incense clung to his form, lending him an air of profound authority. He knelt before them with the gravitas of a collapsing mountain and said respectfully, "This humble deity greets you, my lord."

He spoke with a clear, resonant voice, then turned his head slightly, lowered his gaze, and bowed once more to Li Zhouwei. "This humble deity pays his respects to Your Highness."

Li Zhouwei arched an eyebrow, his interest piqued as he examined the figure.

Li Ximing smiled. "The Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman is quite interesting, and it has another benefit. The mountain ghosts and river spirits it summons are intrinsically linked to the land. When summoned over Moongaze Lake, this humble deity is quite formidable."

After a careful inspection, Li Zhouwei asked, "Does it have memories? A True Spirit?"

Li Ximing shook his head with a hint of regret. "It's not as miraculous as Xuanyi's Corner-Cleansing Merit Bottle. While the deity summoned by this talisman is powerful, it must be sustained by a divine ability. Once a full day passes, the god dissipates. The next time it's summoned, its mind will be a complete blank slate."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "Its power level is rather awkward. Just as Granduncle said, it's really only good for making a good impression and running a few errands."

"Aside from 'Spirit-Summoning'," Li Ximing continued, "its other ability is 'Overseer's Light.' The power of that ability depends on several factors: the proximity and power of nearby lakes and mountains, the master's cultivation level in their dao lineage, and the number of matching jade talismans used… but when we're on the lake, the Overseer's Light is at least respectable."

As he spoke, he pushed the Spiritual Treasure, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, back toward Li Zhouwei.

But Li Zhouwei shook his head. "Granduncle should take the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument."

"Hmm?" Li Ximing frowned. "What use would I have for a Spiritual Treasure?"

Li Zhouwei smiled. "The instrument requires Li Fire to be used. Is Grandncle going to give me a portion of his Li Fire? This isn't a question of whether you can use it or not. Your strength is already considerable. With three spiritual fires at your command, you can dominate the early stages of the Purple Mansion Realm. If you add this complementary Spiritual Treasure to your arsenal, I fear even the cultivators of the old Supreme Yang Daoist tradition would have paled in comparison. Be it a Maha practitioner or a cultivator with three divine abilities, they would have to think twice before facing you."

"That changes things entirely," he continued. "The world is fraught with peril. Only by possessing strength comparable to the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm can one hope to handle the vast majority of crises."

Who could remain unmoved by a Spiritual Treasure? Li Ximing gazed at the orb-like object, perfectly round like a Golden Core, his heart stirring with excitement. After hesitating for a long moment, he finally took it and tucked it away, unable to part with it. "This is truly a waste," he said. "The moment Jiangqian has good news, this will be passed on to him!"

Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal. By the time Li Jiangqian broke through, Li Ximing would have long since cultivated the World's Radiance. With three Purple Mansion spiritual fires and the enhancement of the Valley Wind Guide-Fire technique, it was hard to say who would be a better fit for the Spiritual Treasure.

Li Ximing then grinned. "Do you remember that letter you sent from the Eastern Sea all those years ago? We've received news about the 'Converging Water' spiritual object you acquired. It's called 'Sinking Savage Aged Gold,' a very rare type of Converging Water material that's perfect for forging weapons. A pity our family has no use for it."

Li Zhouwei grew thoughtful. "Hold onto it for me. By my calculations, Dingjiao should reach the Purple Mansion Realm within the next decade. If this material has no other critical use, we can send it to him as a congratulatory gift. It wouldn't be an insult."

When Li Zhouwei had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, Dingjiao had sent him a Purple Mansion Spiritual Treasure. This return gift was far too light in comparison, but their family wasn't wealthy enough to give away Spiritual Treasures as presents. The Sinking Savage Aged Gold would have to suffice.

The memory surfaced for Li Ximing, and he nodded silently. He then relayed the news about Dingyang Zi using a blood sacrifice for his Spiritual Artifact.

Li Zhouwei's brow furrowed. "That would be inappropriate. At most, I could offer a single drop, as Zhu Gong did back then to request spiritual resources, just enough to make the artifact feel an affinity for me. Spitting out a mouthful of essence blood is out of the question! The higher my cultivation, the more precious my blood becomes. If I were to truly offer up a mouthful of essence blood without a spiritual object on the level of White Dew Blood to replenish it, my cultivation would likely be delayed by decades!"

Dongfang Heyun had specifically warned him about this years ago. Li Zhouwei shook his head decisively, a chill running through Li Ximing's heart.

"Thankfully, we have the Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough!" Li Ximing sighed.

This was excellent news. He immediately had someone summon Li Minggong, preparing to send her to Qize. Only then did they begin to catch up on the major and minor events of recent years.

"The children of the 'Sui' generation have also grown up," Li Ximing said seriously. "There are three to five of them who show great promise… I believe we need to consider their futures carefully!"

Li Zhouwei looked up with great interest.

The middle-aged man smiled. "One of them… is your direct grandson, named Suihuan. He is incredibly ambitious and highly talented."

Li Ximing's expression was one of pure gratification as he watched him with a smile, repeating the boy's words with a heroic tone. Li Zhouwei listened and chuckled.

"The boy is still naive."

Li Ximing's gaze returned, and he lowered his eyes to his teacup. "Suihuan's talent is exceptional, after all. He deserves encouragement. The others are a step behind, but they are still outstanding. One of them, Li Suining, has an unusually high talent for formation arts!"

Upon hearing the name Li Suihuan, Li Zhouwei's expression became slightly complicated. He set down his cup and hesitated for a moment, but ultimately said nothing and asked no questions. He simply put on a smile.

"Li Suining?"

"That's right!" Li Ximing put his cup down, his expression serious. "Since we have a rare genius in the Dao of formations, we shouldn't let the matter rest. I was originally planning a trip to the south, but now it seems I should first visit the Eastern Sea and consult with Senior Changdie…"

He smiled. "After all, we just gave him a spirit embryo. It's only fair to get some formation inheritances from him in return!"

"As for the family… the Upper Rite's Essence-Gathering Profound Origin Art has shown results. It can be passed down to that Li Suikuan. As for cultivation arts that aid in formations, I will have to consult the Daoist tradition and browse the pavilion to select a batch of techniques to distribute."

He paused slightly, then lowered his voice. "There's no rush to trade for them! The pavilion already has a good number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation arts on hand. We can take them out first and place them in the secret vault within the grand formation. Whenever a junior distinguishes themselves, we can then go and exchange for a corresponding Purple Mansion dao lineage of the same affinity!"

Li Zhouwei found this quite reasonable and added, "In any case, there's an abundance of Foundation Establishment techniques inside. We can also place a batch of our family's existing Purple Mansion techniques of corresponding affinities in there. For lower-grade ones like the Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra, we can directly include the Foundation Establishment section."

Li Ximing agreed, then changed the subject. "There is one matter I've been considering… Minggong… she is no longer young, and her cultivation is sufficient."

"The old master came to ask once, also inquiring about divine abilities. The news was… bittersweet."

At this single sentence, Li Zhouwei fell silent.

Li Ximing's own divine ability stirred subtly as he continued, "I looked specifically in the pavilion. There is a fifth-grade scripture, the _Heavenly Sparrow's Grant of Light Sutra_. It contains only a single secret method and costs ninety-seven immortal merits. After exchanging for the Emperor Qi's Light back then, you had two hundred ninety-eight left… and after you emerged from the grotto-heaven, you had another thirty-one to spare…"

Li Zhouwei contemplated this for a long time before finally answering,

"Difficult… far too difficult. The family has no True Fire Purple Mansion spiritual objects. And even if we did… a single secret method… wouldn't that be pushing our aunt into a pit of fire?"

The golden-eyed young man put down his tea. "What does Aunt herself… have to say?"

Li Ximing sighed. "Actually… there's also Ding Weizeng. They are among the few in the family who have even a sliver of hope. The others have none at all. But neither of them has ever brought it up."

As they spoke, Li Minggong arrived at the mountain estate. She was no longer young, but because she had established her foundation early and had never suffered any major injuries, she appeared to be in her thirties. Her black hair was tied back simply. She bowed to Li Ximing.

"Minggong, do you have any aspirations for a divine ability? I have news of a True Fire Purple Mansion cultivation art… one that shares the same affinity as your immortal foundation."

Li Ximing's words were concise. Li Minggong started, then bowed in a slight fluster. "I have no ambitions for the Purple Mansion Realm."

Li Ximing nodded as Li Minggong lowered her head and continued, "If the family has need of me, I will certainly try… but my lord need not trouble himself over my dao lineage."

"Among the Chengming generation, I was never outstanding. I was merely lucky enough to return from the north alive. Brother Liao and my younger brother were both far more remarkable than I, and even they never considered the Purple Mansion Realm, let alone a junior like me. All I wish is to live out my life-mandate and teach the descendants of my brothers, to shelter their posterity on their behalf."

Li Ximing sighed internally. He moved past the topic and instructed her to go to Qize. When he looked back at Li Zhouwei, he forced a smile. "I'll go see to it now… and have someone add the cultivation arts to the island's repository!"

He transformed into a streak of light and departed.

Li Zhouwei, however, remained seated at the table. He thought for a long time, not in any hurry to meet his eldest grandson. Instead, he gave a sudden command, "Bring Jiangnian to me."

A guard on the mountain immediately departed. A short while later, a man in white robes ascended the path.

A magical glamour flowed across the man's face. His features appeared regular, yet he carried himself with a timid, cringing air. He bowed before Li Zhouwei. 

"Father."

Li Zhouwei's gaze pierced through the illusion, seeing the man's true, ugly face beneath. His eyes were stretched unnaturally wide by some external force, and his cheeks bore obvious marks of reshaping. It was clear his face had been altered with a 'Jade True' technique, but the poor craftsmanship had resulted in a distorted visage.

"You've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"It was… merely a stroke of luck, my lord."

Li Zhouwei watched him quietly. There was no sharpness in his gaze, nor any trace of disgust. He reached out, patted the man's shoulder, and instructed, 

"Starting today, you will go to the Qunyi Archipelago."

Li Jiangnian stood up. He didn't ask a single question, accepting his fate like a lamb. He simply nodded.

Li Zhouwei rose, his voice softening. "Cultivate more life-preserving spell arts. Train diligently. Stay far away from the lake, and do not live in the shadow of your brothers' glory… that would also be for the best."

Li Jiangnian merely nodded. When he finally saw Li Zhouwei wave his hand in dismissal, he called out, "Thank you, Father," and scurried away.

Li Zhouwei watched his departing figure, his head slowly lowering, his gaze calm.

'Back then, I was only hoping for a change in circumstances, for a single chance at a breakthrough. But Granduncle couldn't bear it in the end and bestowed the name 'Huan'… now the child has grown. There is nothing to be changed.'

'Not just a divine ability for the second generation… not just a Bright Yang for the second generation… how could that be acceptable!'

---

Upon a dais of black jade, purple mist drifted.

A round porcelain plate rested silently on the platform. Golden sand, fine as water, was spread across it, with a tiny Daoist temple placed on top. A dashing man lay reclined beside the plate, casually inspecting it.

"Martial Uncle—how many lots did we win?"

Daoist Master Tianque entered from outside the cave, full of excitement. He stopped amidst the Purple Mist and announced, "Good fortune! We secured two!"

"Oh?" Daoist Master Tianhuo rose, pleasantly surprised, and raised an eyebrow. 

"I only heard of one. Where did the other come from?"

Daoist Master Tianque was clearly in high spirits. "One was a figure from our own territory. The other was with the Ni family. I received news in advance and brought it back to the mountain. It was a treasure, drawn by the summons, that flew out on its own. It's a good thing I arrived in time, and the Ni family didn't dare to offend us. That's how I managed to secure it!"

"Congratulations, Martial Uncle!" Tianhuo said, then watched as Tianque's smile faded and his expression turned serious.

"How is that lord of ours?"

Tianhuo's expression immediately grew grave as well. "He has sent his subordinates to Linhai Prefecture, but has not been seen in person for some time. I speculate that he is already attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Hearing this, the other Daoist Master sighed and sat down beside him. "He truly doesn't give anyone a moment's rest. It's only been a few years since the fall of Wanling Heaven. Most of the great families are still digesting their gains and nursing their wounds, and he's already preparing to make his next major move."

"It is always best to act swiftly," Tianhuo replied, his expression somber. 

"What was Mount Changhuai's response?"

A cold resentment still lingered in Tianque's voice, though it was not intense. 

"What response could there be? They're busy with that Qing Tangyin business, of course. Back then, they made a huge spectacle of it, integrating the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel into the grand formation, spreading it across the entire Wu State… scheming in the shadows, allowing the Nine Surnames and the great clans to grow arrogant. Wasn't it all for this day?"

"Once the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel shatters, chaos will engulf the Wu State. He has reincarnated to build an empire. The Nine Surnames have been isolated from the world for too long and are still in the dark. Many will inevitably die. The killing karma he amasses will likely be even greater than that of Yang Zhuo."

Tianhuo gave a wry laugh and shook his head. "That they keep out of each other's way can be considered a form of unspoken understanding."

Tianque sighed and nodded. "We asked again and again, but they were unwilling to say much, only promising a few positions. And how could they not? Unless they want our two sects to go to war, he would never be able to restore the old territories of the Wu State without my Golden Feather's approval."

His tone suddenly shifted. "Yun'er… how many divine abilities does he have now?"

"Three," Tianhuo said casually. "If he hadn't been ambushed by those bastards from the north, he would have achieved it sooner! Now, the timeline is even tighter. We can't count on him. The outcome will mainly depend on Father."

"One more thing I must ask—has the dynastic name been prepared?"

"Naturally. That is something they decided long ago."

Tianque raised his eyebrows slightly, a solemn look in his eyes as he revealed the name:

"Shu."




# Chapter 997: Changes

‘Sovereign's Perilous Tread Body Divine Ability...’

Golden light flashed atop Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Li Zhouwei withdrew his divine ability and exhaled. His eyes snapped open, the golden sheen within them receding.

It was just as he had predicted. The cultivation speed for Sovereign's Perilous Tread remained enhanced even at the Purple Mansion Realm level for divine abilities. Unfortunately, the boost was no longer as terrifying as it had been during the Foundation Establishment Realm. After all, mastering a divine ability was a slow, grinding process. Li Ximing himself had cultivated for ten years and consumed a Talisman Pill just to perfect Audience with the Celestial Gate.

Five years had passed since the fall of Wanling Heaven. Li Zhouwei had spent the first year or so healing, and nearly half the remaining time advancing his Sovereign's Perilous Tread. He still had a long way to go.

‘Thankfully, with Granduncle here, I’ve been able to use one Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill after another. My progress is no worse than those from the major Daoist Traditions. I estimate... if I don't take another Talisman Pill, I'll only need three more years at most to master Sovereign's Perilous Tread.’

He rose, only to see someone from the mountain coming to report. A Demon General in black robes climbed the peak, trembling so badly he didn't dare lift his eyes. He knelt before Li Zhouwei and stammered, "Yan... Yan Hu... pays respects to the Great King!"

Li Zhouwei recognized him as one of the Demon beasts who acted on his Granduncle's behalf in the Southern Borderlands. He gave a slight nod.

Yan Hu quickly continued, "Reporting to the Great King! This subordinate received orders from the Great Suopo King to invite the Daoist Master. The Demon King Qingyan has obtained a treasure and wishes to trade for it. It is inconvenient for him to come to the lake, so he requests the Daoist Master's presence..."

"Poluoduo?"

Li Zhouwei knew of this matter; it was one of Li Ximing's connections in the Southern Borderlands. He asked the question, and Yan Hu nodded hastily, replying with respect:

"It was originally set to be at Poluoduo... but in recent years, the White Victory Dao has grown terrifyingly strong. I heard they have a new Lord, and their influence has already spread to Poluoduo, destabilizing the situation... Even the Great Suopo King no longer stays in Poluoduo often... They are both in the West Sea... They said they are at Bojun Mountain in the West Sea."

Li Zhouwei heard this and immediately understood their apprehension. After all, the Great Suopo King, Fuxun, held a grudge against the White Victory Dao. No one wanted to be dragged into that affair.

However, Li Ximing had already sorted out his cultivation manuals and summoned Li Jiangchun for a long talk. He had left the mountain long ago, flying toward the Eastern Sea to trade for a Dao Lineage with Liu Changdie, and to visit Li Que'wan while he was there.

‘Furthermore, the Wall-Sinking Water in the Qunyi Archipelago region is becoming increasingly scarce. In five years, we’ve only acquired two Neck Feathers. Even though Granduncle has a good relationship with Daoist Master Kuang Yu, he can’t keep asking to buy Wall-Sinking Water in bulk... Granduncle mentioned long ago that he needed to make a trip to the West Sea...’

He gave a casual order, "The Daoist Master is still in the Eastern Sea. You may go and wait for now."

Just as Yan Hu retreated, Li Zhouwei picked up a jade slip, preparing to return to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. But he suddenly paused and looked up toward the north.

A luminous cloud was spreading, shifting the heavens. A multicoloured radiance shot into the sky, dyeing the northern horizon silver-white. Li Zhouwei took a single step into the Great Void to observe it more closely.

"That's Chengshui Marsh..."

He waited patiently on the mountain for several hours before Chen Yang finally came up to report, his expression grave.

Chen Yang's cultivation had progressed rapidly; he had already built a deep foundation in the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and carried an air of steady, solid advancement. He bowed at the steps and said respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, Lord Zhong Qian of the Chengyun Immortal Sect in the Huai River Dao has broken through to become a Daoist Master, taking the title 'Zhonggong'. All the families of the Huai River Dao have gone to offer congratulations."

Li Zhouwei set down his cup, unsurprised. He nodded. "This was a natural culmination of his efforts. He always deserved a place among those with divine abilities."

Chen Yang hesitated slightly, his knees planted firmly on the ground. He shuffled forward a bit and said respectfully, "However... according to the current traditions system, Daoist Master Zhonggong is a figure of the Huai River Dao, but also a Daoist Master of the Zhao State. Although he has a past relationship with our family... this congratulatory gift..."

"It matters not..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and took a box from his sleeve. Inside, resting in the center, was an ink-black scale. He instructed, "Have someone deliver this Cangzhou Serpent Scale. Count it as a congratulatory gift from our Li family."

Chen Yang nodded repeatedly. Just as he was about to withdraw, Li Zhouwei suddenly stopped him, raising an eyebrow. "I have been in seclusion for so long, but I heard your good news. Jinxi has achieved Foundation Establishment?"

Chen Yang quickly bowed, smiling. "Reporting to the Daoist Master... he is an unworthy one, not worth mentioning! He just had a bit of luck and managed to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Of my three descendants... Jinbao perished, leaving only him and Jinguang. Now that he has succeeded, we just have to see about Jinguang."

Li Zhouwei nodded and passed a jade box into his hand, speaking softly. "We are all family... I must also offer a gift."

...

Dharma light flickered, glowing softly in the shadows.

The pavilion was utterly silent. Rows of jade slips were locked onto high shelves, bathing the room in white light. A young man paced through, his brow tightly furrowed, his gaze constantly sweeping across the room.

"It's not here... How can it not be here..."

Li Suining was using a break in his cultivation to explore this Secret Pavilion.

The family's Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining manuals were generally stored in two places: one was the Dao Palace in the Milin Mountains, and the other was this Secret Pavilion on the island. The former was mostly for Guest Retainers, Dharma Protectors, and visiting members of other clans to borrow. The latter was for relatives of the main clan. But in reality, the line for 'main clan relatives' was blurry. The various major and minor families were all related to some degree.

Some trusted Guest Retainers and Dharma Protectors could also come here. The only reason to separate out the Milin Mountains Dao Palace was as a gesture of goodwill to the various attached families from the Eastern Shore and the Wilderness.

After all, the family's core manuals for Foundation Establishment and for Purple Mansion Realm 'seeds' had to be kept restricted. They couldn't let their foundation be seen just to show goodwill, hence the separation.

‘The King of Wei's Mandate of Heaven is bright. He allowed our family to acquire many Purple Mansion Realm manuals, putting our inner reserves on par with an Immortal Sect. Because we have this foundation, our clan's restrictions are the most relaxed in all of Yue State...’

But as his gaze swept over the dazzling array of manuals, walking from the east side of the pavilion to the west, his hands rising and falling, he felt only shock and doubt.

‘How can it not be here!’

This was already his third visit since arriving on the island three months ago. The Art of the Golden Tablet from his past life truly wasn't here!

It was one thing for the Art of the Golden Tablet from the Profound Dipper's Balance to be missing, but even the Art of the Watchful Awakening Star from the Celestial-Awakening Ear was gone!

A shadow instantly fell over his heart. The Art of the Golden Tablet was crucial. Not only did it significantly boost formation arts, but more importantly, it was aligned with the subsequent Sacred Scroll of the Star Court... This affected the entire tapestry of his plans!

It didn't matter if he lacked the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court for a while; he could easily substitute the Art of the Golden Tablet. But if he didn't even have the Art of the Golden Tablet... what was he supposed to cultivate?!

This wasn't something he could use just by having a copy in his memory! The most important tools Immortal Sects and Immortal Clans used to maintain their rule were Spiritual Qi and cultivation manuals. Without a faction to gather Spiritual Qi for him, it wouldn't matter if he had a Ninth-Rank manual in his head, let alone the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court!

‘In my past life, I was in seclusion for over a year before I even qualified to break through to Qi Refining... Did the family obtain it during that year?’

He fell into deep thought. He returned to the front of the pavilion and saw a middle-aged man tidying the jade slips, his head bowed low. The man was meticulously wiping them with an oiled cotton cloth. When he saw Li Suining come down, he quickly looked up.

"Greetings, Young Master... Are you looking for a particular manual? My surname is Chi, and I am humbled to be the caretaker of the Secret Pavilion..."

Li Suining glanced at him and asked with a frown, "Elder, do you have the authority to retrieve them?"

"Naturally, I do not."

The caretaker, Chi, gave an awkward smile and pointed. "I just run the errands. If the Young Master sees one he fancies, I will go to the opposite building and request Lord White Ape to fetch it. But judging by your appearance... you are probably here to _receive_ a manual... That involves the matter of Spiritual Qi..."

Li Suining nodded, considering this for a moment before replying, "That won't be necessary..."

This reminder suddenly made his mind go blank.

‘Wait... gathering qi can take five or ten years. If the family didn't have the Art of the Golden Tablet, how did they manage the Spiritual Qi? Even if they got the manual within that year, how long would it take to gather the qi? How would I have had time? It was clearly there in my past life!’

He suppressed his thoughts and was about to leave the pavilion when a cold wind suddenly swept in, rushing into the room. A young man in white robes descended on the breeze.

The youth's robes were simple. He had dark, arched eyebrows, dark eyes, a high brow-bone, and a straight, high nose, which lent him a measure of steadiness. His long hair was tied back, and his features were exceptional. A sword hung at his waist, sheathed in a white jade scabbard—one of his few adornments of nobility. He landed in the pavilion and glanced up.

The man named Chi hurried forward, bowed, and said respectfully, "Greetings, my Lord..."

"No need for formalities!"

His voice was clear and cold. He bid the man rise, and his gaze quickly swept the room, landing on Li Suining. A trace of surprise flickered in his eyes, and he smiled. "And which clan brother is this?"

Li Suining was stunned for a moment before he bowed to the ground, forcing his voice to remain steady.

"Greetings, Young Uncle... This junior is Suining, from the direct line of the Yuanwan branch..."

"The direct line of the Yuanwan branch?"

The white-robed youth before him looked even younger than himself, yet he was already of his uncle's generation. He stepped forward, placed a hand on Li Suining's wrist, and quickly helped him up, smiling. "Good... so you are Suining! You actually recognize me?"

The voice was bright and amiable, but it made Li Suining's heart clench.

How could he not recognize him?

This uncle of his, Li Jiangchun, was not old, but he was the one who, after a hundred years, had once again linked the Li family to the legacy of the Sword Immortals! His Celestial Moon Sword Art, combined with his Lesser Yin dharma power, had slain the Shu General Li Nitan, alarming the Song Emperor enough to summon him to the capital for a reward... In three duels, he had so infuriated the Second Prince of the Great Song that the prince supposedly never practiced the sword again...

His premature death had shaken the court, causing the King of Wei to return from campaign and the hundred officials to enter the palace at midnight. It could even be said that his death was what triggered the great conflict between Shu and Song...

And now, here he was, standing before him, so bright and transcendent. How could Li Suining not be stunned? But his mind was sharp, and he reacted instantly, replying without a second thought:

"Suining has just met several brothers. I guessed that you, my Lord, must be an elder. Factoring in your age, attire, and Dharma swords, I ventured a guess..."

Li Jiangchun nodded thoughtfully and smiled. "No need to be so formal... We are the same age."

Li Suining flushed. It was _because_ they were the same age that Li Jiangchun had drawn so much attention in his past life. When Li Jiangchun slew the Shu General, he, Li Suining, was still worrying about Foundation Establishment!

Li Jiangchun took two steps forward. His eyes were clear and bright, yet they held the sharp edge unique to a sword cultivator. He followed him into the pavilion and smiled. "I just came down from Gardenia Scenery Mountain. I was actually looking for you. I heard that the elders... acquired a batch of cultivation manuals and technique scrolls this year, including some sword arts. They've been sent down the mountain to be added to the pavilion's collection. I was overjoyed, so I came to find Elder White Ape... I was thinking I'd pick out a sword art and then head to the west side to find you..."

"It's quite the coincidence that you're here too."

Half of the doubt in Li Suining's heart dissolved. He nodded inwardly.

‘Just as I thought... Both the Art of the Golden Tablet and the Art of the Watchful Awakening Star are part of the batch being added right now. I was just a little too early, so of course I couldn't find them.’

As he mulled this over, Li Jiangchun led him up to the second floor of the pavilion. He lightly tapped the door, engaging the main formation lock, before his smile faded and his expression turned serious.

"Regarding the matter of the formation manuals you mentioned, we have news. I was ordered by the Daoist Master to come down from the mountain."

Li Suining knew things had changed from his old timeline. He immediately bowed in the pavilion and offered his thanks. Li Jiangchun set down a jade slip and laughed.

"No need for that... If you're thanking anyone, thank the Daoist Master."

He spoke seriously, "The Daoist Master has gone to the Eastern Sea and has not yet returned. He has business to attend to, and he will also be trading for a formation dao lineage for you from an elder... We don't know when he will be back. Daoist Master Minghuang has come out of seclusion and asked me to come down the mountain to find you... First, to meet you... and second, to arrange for your pills."

Li Suining's heart shook. He quickly bowed again, but Li Jiangchun shook his head.

"These pills... are for you to use in seclusion. You must quickly cultivate to the peak of the fifth level of Embyronic Breathing. When you are done, come find me. I have another pill for you here. I will arrange an Immortal's abode for you to perfect the Embyronic Breathing realm."

Li Suining's heart leaped.

From those few sentences, he had roughly pieced everything together.

‘First... the Daoist Master went to the Eastern Sea... to get the Dao Lineage for me. That must mean he's looking for Daoist Master Yuanbian.’

‘In my past life, I only heard that he went straight to the West Sea and was delayed there. Is it because I revealed my talent for formations early... that his trip to the West Sea has been postponed?!’

A momentary joy filled his heart. He shivered slightly and asked, "This junior was just thinking that I should focus on breaking through to the fifth level of Embyronic Breathing. That way, when I meet the Daoist Master to receive the formation Dao Lineage... I will be better prepared!"

"Exactly!"

Li Jiangchun smiled and replied, "The Daoist Master said he will return in a few months, which is enough time for you to break through."

Li Suining pondered this inwardly.

In his past life, he entered the island to cultivate and went into seclusion in his Immortal's abode for six months. Suddenly, the mountains shook and the earth quaked. Only then did he learn that the Buddhist cultivators had come... The Wilderness was under sudden attack, a great battle between Purple Mansion Realm experts erupted, and chaos reigned. The casualties were heavy. Ding Weizeng and An Xuanxin both died in the battle...

At that time, the lake was caught completely off guard. Only Li Zhouwei was there to fight back. Li Ximing was still in the distant West Sea, unable to return!

‘It's possible... the Daoist Master might return in time...’

Li Suining had never imagined he could influence Li Ximing's movements! Even being reborn, he never thought he could control every outcome. Even facing the turmoil in the Wilderness, his only thought had been to save Ding Weizeng... He never dreamed he could affect a battle at the Purple Mansion Realm level!

He knew that in his past life, the Li family had barely managed to protect itself in that great war... Li Ximing's intervention was not necessarily a good thing. His heart pounded, a mix of joy and apprehension.

‘If the Daoist Master really does return in time... will the final outcome of this war be changed? And if it changes... will it be for good or for ill? If the Daoist Master's participation leads to injury, or... or an even greater misfortune... wouldn't I be the one to blame?!’

# Chapter 998: Matters of the Heart

Li Suining’s mind raced, but his expression remained calm. He quickly sorted through his thoughts, prioritizing what was most important.

‘Many powerful cultivators are watching Moongaze. I can’t seem too unusual… I can’t influence the Daoist Masters’ actions, whether they come or not. I can only do my best to save Guest Retainer Ding, just in case.’

‘But where is the Art of the Golden Tablet?’

He grew doubtful, his face a mask of contemplation. He tentatively asked, "The Spiritual Qi harvesting will take a while. I’m afraid I’ll have to wait several years for the Daoist Master to retrieve the technique…"

Li Jiangchun shook his head slightly. "Not necessarily. The Daoist Masters have many subordinates. They can simply trade for it among themselves."

These words resonated with Li Suining, and a sudden clarity came over him.

‘That’s right. In my previous life, I emerged from seclusion after a year and the Spiritual Qi was already available. The Art of the Golden Tablet must have been traded for. Last time, when the Wilderness had that incident, Daoist Master Zhaojing rushed back and didn't leave the lake much. So, it's highly likely… that the Art of the Golden Tablet was sent from the Eastern Sea by Daoist Master Yuanbian!’

‘That also explains why the Art of the Golden Tablet is spiritually compatible with the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court… Daoist Master Yuanbian is renowned for his mastery of array arts and has a wealth of good fortune and treasures. The Sacred Scroll of the Star Court was probably his as well!’

‘Because this latest turmoil in the Wilderness resulted in the loss of Guest Retainer Ding and Dharma Protector An, and the clan once again faces a threat from Buddhist cultivators, the Daoist Master wouldn’t dare to leave the lake until the Yang clan's ascension. Since Daoist Master Yuanbian couldn't enter the mainland himself, and a precious item like the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court couldn’t be entrusted to a minor subordinate, he first sent the spiritually compatible Art of the Golden Tablet!’

A slight weight lifted from his chest. He estimated his guess was at least seventy or eighty percent correct. Only one final doubt remained:

‘If that’s the case, why did I have to choose between the Art of the Watchful Awakening Star and the Art of the Golden Tablet in the previous life? Could it be… there was more than one Dao lineage...’

While he was lost in thought, Li Jiangchun misunderstood and tried to reassure him. "Don't worry. Although you started a bit late, the techniques you’ve been given by the lake and the Daoist texts you’ve studied have all built a solid foundation. The disciples on the island all have to learn them as well…"

Li Suining snapped out of his reverie and respectfully assented, but his mind was on something else.

‘At that time, the sky was filled with gray fire. I wonder who from the north it was…’

His mind settled, and he spoke, hesitatingly, "Uncle… there's something I don't know if I should ask…"

"Oh?" Li Jiangchun was surprised and looked at him with a hint of confusion. He saw Li Suining raise his eyebrows, his eyes a little red, and he sighed. "I was wondering… what the Third Young Master's arrangements in the Wilderness are."

The Third Young Master, of course, was Li Jiangxia.

Li Jiangchun stopped walking and sat with Li Suining at a small table in the pavilion, speaking casually. "What's this about?"

The arrangements of the main family lineage were something Li Suining shouldn't have asked about. Even with Li Jiangchun’s high status and Li Ximing’s regard for him, it was a suspicious question without a proper reason. It was an abnormal inquiry, but Li Suining was prepared. He sighed. "My father died for the clan’s cause in Jiangbei… I never even got to meet him… I heard he was serving under the Third Young Master and Guest Retainer Ding. Since the Third Young Master personally brought my father's belongings back, as his son, having taken my responsibilities on the island, I feel I must go and see this uncle of mine…"

Among the Three Holders, Li Suining was very familiar with the two uncles, excluding Li Jiangliang who was in the imperial court. The Grand General of the North and Left Commander of the Martial Temple was frank and open-hearted. Because of Li Suining’s father, he took special care of him and offered assistance on multiple occasions… Recalling it now, Li Suining still felt a twinge of sadness.

With Li Suining’s identity, he could have visited Li Jiangxia directly. However, Li Jiangxia was currently in the Foundation Establishment Realm. Others might not know, but Li Suining knew very well that Li Jiangxia was in seclusion in the mountains, which also helped him avoid the great tribulation!

When the subject of his father’s death was brought up, Li Jiangchun's eyes were filled with compassion. The turmoil of the last decade had taken the greatest toll on the Li clan's cultivators in the Wilderness, with most falling to the Buddhist cultivators. He lowered his gaze and sighed, confirming, "Third Brother has already gone into seclusion. The Wilderness is now supported by Uncle Zhoufang and An Xuanxin, with Guest Retainer Ding in charge. For now, you should focus on your cultivation."

Li Suining nodded, looking crestfallen, and said in a low voice, "I should also go see Guest Retainer Ding… but a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator’s whereabouts are uncertain, and I wouldn’t want to trouble the elders of the family. Since I have some free time from my cultivation, I'll find an opportunity to prepare a gift and pay him a visit!"

He had made his pretext and brought up the subject subtly. Li Jiangchun didn't give it much thought, merely nodding his head with a smile before drawing his sword and leaving the building, soaring away on the wind toward the island.

After flying for a while, he landed and entered a pavilion. An old man sat in the main seat, a wooden scroll in his hand, studying it intently.

"Greetings, Esteemed Elder!"

He bowed in the chamber. Li Xuanxuan quickly rose, a smile on his face, and took a few steps to help him up. "I've told you… you don't need to be so polite in the future. Just walk in. Look at your fifth uncle, he just waltzes in laughing, with so few formalities."

Li Jiangchun stood up with a smile and tilted his head. Sure enough, he saw Li Zhouming in a red robe standing to the side, a pot in his hand as if he had just finished refilling the old man's tea. He smiled and lowered his gaze, but his eyes lingered on the book scroll on the old man's desk, and he frowned slightly.

Li Jiangchun helped the elder back to his seat and said respectfully, "I’ve met a few of the younger clansmen."

"Oh?" Li Xuanxuan raised his eyebrows and stroked his beard, listening to the young man.

"Suihuan is fervent, Suikuan is mature, and as for Suining… having lost his father at a young age, he seems to have many thoughts on his mind. He has a mind of his own… at fifteen and at the fourth level of Embyronic Breathing, he’s not bad…"

He did not mention Li Suining’s request, nor his filial piety, only using the phrase ‘many thoughts on his mind’.

Li Xuanxuan looked thoughtful, but the wastrel above him laughed. "Not bad… he’s much better than me, just not as good as you."

Li Jiangchun and Li Suining were of similar age, but Li Jiangchun’s spiritual aperture had manifested later. He only began cultivating at seven and reached the fourth level of Embyronic Breathing at nine. After taking some spiritual and Talisman Pills, he was already at the Qi Refining stage at ten, cultivating the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity.

In the same year, he gained sword aura, which once shocked the Daoist Master. Li Ximing was overjoyed, teaching him the clan's Celestial Moon Sword Codex, and he focused on the Way of the Sword. His cultivation progress was also swift, already at the fifth level of Qi Refining, so he slowed his cultivation to begin studying the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record.

It was for this reason that Li Xuanxuan held a sort of regretful fondness for him. Li Jiangchun spent more time practicing the sword and less time cultivating, so the elder often went to watch him, standing in the courtyard for an hour or two, just silently observing.

Hearing his words, Li Xuanxuan considered for a moment, then changed the subject, becoming serious. "Did he… feel that the family has mistreated him?"

This was a highly sensitive question. Li Suining’s elder was incapable, and his father had died for the clan. Although the island had offered a great deal of compensation and secretly taken care of him, children often had extreme mindsets, and it was hard to know what they truly thought. The elder, ever thoughtful,’s first reaction was to ask this.

Li Jiangchun, however, shook his head resolutely. "He has his own thoughts… My All-Fragrance Sinks has not yet reached completion, and my grand ambitions have not yet been realized, but I still have a sense of intuition. He is likely a person with a firm will and a clear understanding of things."

"That’s good!" Li Xuanxuan smiled with relief. "There were too many juniors around at the time, and I didn't get to talk to him for very long. I must find a day to test him!"

Li Jiangchun recounted the conversations with the young clansmen. Li Xuanxuan nodded as he listened, all the while keeping an eye on the bright moon outside the pavilion. He said, with a serious tone, "The crescent moon has risen. A cold and clear moonlit night like this is not to be missed."

The Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity was best cultivated on a cold, clear night under the moonlight. Li Jiangchun understood and took his leave. But as soon as he exited the pavilion, he saw a figure in a red robe follow him out.

His fifth uncle’s movements were carefree and dashing. After reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had become even more at ease. As he walked alongside him, he looked at him with a smile. "Jiangchun… do you like listening to music?"

Li Jiangchun looked slightly helpless. "The Way of the Sword is crucial, and the spell arts are complex. I’ve never had the chance to listen to music."

With his successful breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Zhouming’s face shone with a newfound luster. Although he used less cosmetics, his wastrel demeanor remained. He opened his fan, speaking nonchalantly, and stopped. "There's a tune, 'Lament for the Fleeting River', that’s very interesting. You should listen to it sometime."

Li Jiangchun raised his eyebrows, looking thoughtful as he bid farewell and left.

The wastrel, famous throughout the island, was left standing in the pavilion. He raised his fan, gazing at the moonlight on his red robe. The smile on his face slowly faded, and his eyes filled with contemplation.

‘This isn't the first time… Every time I come to the pavilion, the Esteemed Elder’s desk has this musical score. He reads it over and over, until the characters are smudged…’

‘Even the other night when I was out for a late-night stroll, I passed by here and the elder was still sitting at his desk, head bowed over a lamp, reading it repeatedly, sighing long and hard…’

‘"Lament for the Fleeting River"…’

His gaze drifted. He stood in the moonlight and closed his fan, muttering with a sense of foreboding, "Where have the days of old… gone… leaving only my spirit cold."

Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple.

Golden Buddhas rose like mountains, and divine radiance fell like rain. Where the light shone, Primordial Magnetism was pervasive. The Dharma Hall glowed brightly, a hundred monks descended from the building, and the colored ponds rippled. Sacred vessels held floral water, a picture of a tranquil sanctuary.

The white steps were smooth, one after the other. A monk in gray robes sat on a step, his expression distant. A young monk holding an alms bowl stood to the side, looking as if he wanted to speak but hesitated.

"Maha…"

But the gray-robed monk stood up, his voice filled with hope. "Luejin, is there any news from Xuanmiao Temple?"

The young monk shook his head hesitantly, causing the monk to sigh. "Lord Qi will not see me… more lives are about to be lost."

He dusted his sleeves and rose, slightly startled. He looked down the mountain and saw a monk standing on the steps, climbing leisurely one step at a time.

The man was tall, with very narrow eyes and a vibrant, spirited demeanor. His eyes were a pale red, and he wore a blue silk sash around his waist, giving him a powerful presence. He came barefoot, his hands clasped together, and smiled.

"Fellow Daoist Fachang!"

Upon seeing him, Fachang’s brows furrowed, and he sighed. "So it is Fellow Daoist 'Sparrow Carp Fish'… You’ve come… As I knew you would."

The pale red pupils of 'Sparrow Carp Fish' stared at him, as if a gray mist was welling up, causing Luejin to take a step back. This Maha spoke unhurriedly.

"You should have known. My Way of Great Desire had a million followers slaughtered in Jiangbei—with such a great karma, how could I not come?"

Fachang’s gaze was complicated. He invited him into the hall and raised his eyebrows. "And so… Lord Sparrow… how many lives will you now take?"

'Sparrow Carp Fish' laughed. With his pointed chin and pale skin, he was a handsome monk. The laugh only added to his elegance. He tilted his eyes and replied, "My Great Desire Liangli method is for eliminating demons and protecting the Dao, to create a world of infinite delight for all, so that everyone can cross the Sea of Desire and ascend the empty mountain—'take lives'? What kind of talk is that!"

"You've slandered my Way of Great Desire more than once. If it weren't for the sake of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, I would make you vanish, body and soul."

His tone was calm, yet filled with killing intent. Fachang acted as if he hadn't heard, clasping his hands and sighing. "I have no other intention. I only hope that in using your methods, fellow Daoist, you can spare the innocent."

"Innocent…"

'Sparrow Carp Fish' sneered. "You are truly ignorant. You only occupy a position. How many innocents have you saved? You want to save the innocent, but my Way of Great Desire had a million followers… were you able to save them? You only bear karma in vain!"

"This is an era of change. You pledge allegiance to a certain faction and you do its bidding. How many people are truly innocent? Are the selfishness and secrecy of the southern noble families, who drive the common people like cattle and sheep, innocent? Or are these common people who have lived lives of killing, internal conflict, and disrespect for our teachings, innocent?"

He laughed. "If there truly are any innocent people who have been so poor and downtrodden until now, the light of our teachings will shine upon them, and they will feel a response, and we will take them into our Way."

"In short… Fellow Daoist, your teachings are simply at odds with ours. You should just go back to your White Horse Monastery."

Fachang remained silent for a long time. He then saw a person following ‘Sparrow Carp Fish’ up the steps. The person was unremarkable in appearance, seemingly a practitioner of the Arhat path, with a bare torso and a poisonous dragon coiled around his body, faintly revealing his strong muscles.

'Sparrow Carp Fish' raised his eyebrows, glanced at the newcomer, and said casually, "Antelope Trample, this is Maha Fachang, a high-level cultivator of the White Horse Monastery."

Fachang’s gaze moved up and down, filled with pity. He clasped his hands and replied, "Congratulations, fellow Daoist, on taking a great disciple."

With that, he turned and silently descended the stairs, leaving the spacious hall and its new master. Antelope Trample bowed in the hall, noticing that ‘Sparrow Carp Fish’ didn’t look pleased.

The Maha spoke coldly. "The people of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm are always like this. If he dared to stand apart from the Seven Dao and follow the ways of the ancient cultivators, I would respect him. But mediating from the middle is ineffective; he just wastes time on the riverbank. If those above had truly ordered him to go south, would he have obeyed or not? If it weren’t for Qi Lanyan’s connections with him, who transferred him away in time… he would still have to endure this suffering!"

Antelope Trample lowered his head, listening to 'Sparrow Carp Fish' pace and sneer. "After what the Undefeated King of Brightness did, he now feels pity for you. What a joke."

Antelope Trample nodded and said respectfully, "Master, as for the move south…"

"You don't need to get involved in that for now."

'Sparrow Carp Fish's' pale red eyes narrowed. He replied, "Li Zhouwei took that painting back then, and he also has a great deal of karma. The benefits you've gained from the million lives haven't been fully digested… We can't afford to lose you easily. Just wait for me in Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple."

Antelope Trample lowered his head in assent. The Maha had already vanished, leaving him kneeling on the ground, bowing to the various golden Buddhas in the hall. Faint sounds still echoed in his ears.

"Wonderful, so wonderful…"

"Enlightened, fully enlightened!"
