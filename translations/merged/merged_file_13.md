# Chapter 941: Huiyao Paying Respect

As Li Chenghuai let his mind wander, Li Zhouluo stepped forward, cupped his fist in salute and began introducing the siblings. The eldest among them, Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang of the first lineage, were timid and hesitant to speak, so the fourth young master took it upon himself to speak on their behalf.

Next was Li Zhouken of the second lineage. The current generation of the second lineage lacked innate ability. Though born of the first lineage, he had been adopted into the second, and was in fact the blood brother of Li Zhoufang and the others. He bowed respectfully when he was called upon.

The remaining children were all quite young, barely out of infancy, so it was hard to judge anything. After greeting each in turn, Li Chengliao turned to inspect the outstanding disciples of the sixteen prefectures. There were more than thirty in total. Naturally, the standards for selection were a notch below those for his own kin. As he surveyed them, none seemed foolish, but most were lacking in cultivation.

Seven from the An Family, two from the Chen Family, three from Western Pool, ten from the prominent families, and ten from the commoner clans...

Li Chengliao had a clear sense of things. The prominent families of Lijing, such as Chen, Tian, Dou, and Xu, were facing circumstances not unlike those of the Li Family’s main lineage. All suffered from dwindling legitimate descendants, so their numbers were understandably low.

In contrast, the newly risen surnames and humble households from the western and eastern banks of the prefectural mountains were rapidly amassing strength and securing their footing. Li Chengliao studied this night after night sitting atop the island with his red brush in hand. There were few who could claim deeper insight than him.

The era of intermarriage among the Chen, Dou, Tian, and Xu families of Lijing is coming to an end. Government appointments flow like water in the sixteen prefectures. The mortal and immortal realms grow ever more distant. There are prominent families with names but no land. Their rise and fall is a matter of a single generation, thought Li Chengliao.

He nodded as the youth below reported the customs of Wutu Prefecture, smiling in response, though his thoughts were elsewhere. The current peace and stability across the sixteen prefectures was not truly his achievement. He knew full well he had simply inherited a stable, finely-tuned Li Family ripe for manipulation.

The system of rotating appointments and prefectural authority, the Jade Court, the Qingdu enforcers; these had all been carefully devised by Li Yuanping and Li Xijun. Even when the Li Family had only held a sliver of the eastern shore, they already had a vision in place. Over time, Li Xicheng and Li Xijun had systematically eliminated the local powers in the newly claimed territories, and now that framework spanned the entire expanse of the lake’s sixteen prefectures.

However...

He still remembered the sacrifices made by the four surnames alongside the Li Family in the north. The current decline of the prominent families was not unrelated to the deaths of their political leaders. In the past, rewards like spirit items and dharma artifacts had been part of the bond, but affection and familiarity mattered just as much.

Thus, Li Chengliao gave special attention to the descendants of the four surnames, distributed spirit items to the outstanding youths of the sixteen prefectures, and allocated cave dwellings on the island for them to settle and cultivate. The cultivators then took their leave.

By the time he had completed all the arrangements, more than half an hour had passed. When he turned to check on his own family’s children, he found them all still standing silently to the side. They had been waiting all this time without a word.

Li Chengliao set down his brush and smiled. "Zhouluo, bring your brothers up here."

Li Zhouluo responded respectfully. As he and the others approached the front of the hall, they noticed a sudden warmth in Li Chengliao’s expression.

He quickly rose to his feet, vacating the seat of honor, and greeted solemnly, "Greetings, my lady!"

Li Zhouluo turned to look and saw a woman already standing in the hall. She wore a long feathered robe and silver boots. Her black hair was coiled up and pinned back with a white flower. She held a silver-white spear as she stood quietly.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝙬𝙚𝓫𝒏𝓸𝓿𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝓶

A violet haze shimmered in her almond-shaped eyes. Though lightning did not manifest over her body, just her presence alone made Li Zhouluo afraid to look directly at her. He of course knew exactly who she was.

"Ancestor Qinghong!"

Li Qinghong gave him a slight nod and asked, "How long has it been?"

"My lady, it's been one year and six months," Li Chengliao responded on his behalf.

Li Qinghong hadn’t spent all her time in seclusion over the past year or so; she often went out to the sea to collect lightning. Now, her control over the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens had grown increasingly refined. She could store lightning within them at will and even enhance their power.

The white flower hairpin she wore was also found in the Eastern Sea. Though it was only of Qi Cultivation Realm, it was a rare Celestial Thunder dharma artifact capable of storing a small amount of lightning. It was better than nothing.

"The appointed time with Xi Zikang is drawing near. I came back to take a look," said Li Qinghong.

Since she was standing, no one dared to sit. They followed Li Qinghong down the steps of the hall. She glanced at the scenery across the island and quietly praised Li Chengliao.

Li Chengliao respectfully said, "Senior Kong Tingyun from Profound Peak Gate paid a visit a year ago. Upon hearing that you were in seclusion, she did not disturb you but left a message with me. She hopes you would write to her upon emerging, so that she may come to visit."

"I’ll go to Profound Peak and see her instead," Li Qinghong responded softly, without any noticeable change in expression.

Li Chengliao had managed household affairs well. At the very least, the island already bore the marks of an immortal family. As she took in the scenery, evening descended, and sure enough, silver-white lightning bolts began to strike the island.

Xi Zikang held a jade slip in his hand, his silver robe gleaming. He cupped his fists and greeted her with a smile, "Fellow Daoist Qinghong, long time no see!"

Li Qinghong nodded gently and exchanged a few polite words with him. Xi Zikang didn’t waste time and handed over the cultivation technique in his hand, speaking aloud, "Have a look, Fellow Daoist. This is the Bright and Clear Heart!"

Li Qinghong swept her spiritual sense through it. As Xi Zikang had claimed, the technique wasn’t particularly valuable. It was merely a second-grade technique called the Clarity of Sight and Heart Technique.

She only inspected it briefly before raising her head with a look of doubt. Xi Zikang, of course, understood the value was insufficient and immediately said, "I know this isn’t quite enough, but I have something else to make up the difference. Perhaps it will balance the value."

He pulled out a jade box from within his sleeve and said softly, "This is an escape spell of Bright Yang Dao, a third-grade technique called Flowing Sun Refraction. Together with the previous one, the value should match that of the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling."

Li Qinghong hesitated slightly. Escape spells were rare in Jiangnan. As for the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling, she didn’t fully understand its value. From the Li Family’s perspective, the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique was just an ordinary third-grade technique. It was certainly not worth a third-grade escape spell.

If she were to think maliciously, he might be trying to obtain the technique to counter her. But Li Qinghong had long switched to cultivating the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique. While her Immortal Foundation remained the same, many of her internal pathways were now entirely different.

After much thought, she decided caution was still best and spoke gently, "The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique is, after all, my own method and contains many secrets. If you’re willing, let’s exchange the jade slips first. After we return from the Eastern Sea, we can trade the unlocking incantations."

She looked carefully at the young man’s expression and saw clarity in his eyes. He answered without hesitation, "Deal!"

He readily agreed, showing the decisiveness typical of thunder cultivators from the Northern Sea. After a few more words, he took his leave without a hint of reluctance, riding the wind as he departed.

Li Qinghong watched him go and said softly, "While we’re away, be extra cautious in your actions."

Li Chengliao bowed his head in acknowledgment, while Li Qinghong thought to herself, Minghuang should be nearing a breakthrough. I’ll make a trip to Profound Peak Gate and then swing by the Eastern Sea. I’ll borrow some spirit gauze from Hengzhu Dao Gate and bring him back first.

No matter how much trouble it caused, Li Qinghong didn’t mind. If possible, she was even considering asking Kong Tingyun to come along, just in case something went wrong along the way.

Zongquan Island.

In the Eastern Sea, where waters fall and thunder rises, the skies were perpetually overcast. Rarely did the thunderclouds part, but today, radiant light poured down, gleaming brightly across the towers and halls of the island.

Whenever a heavenly breach occurred in the Northern Sea, the waters of the Eastern Sea would fall, expanding Zongquan Island by fifty kilometers. Its territory would suddenly grow, revealing numerous spirit ores. The island’s income would improve dramatically, and show signs of burgeoning wealth.

However, on a barren mountain within the island stood a small courtyard, with no guards or servants. There was only a lone monk washing clothes in the courtyard. Halfway through, he looked up at the sky and muttered, "Two years... how quickly it passed!"

Kongheng looked a little pale. He finished washing his robe, wrung out the water, gave it a good shake, and hung it to dry on the line. Outside the courtyard, seabirds chirped noisily, waiting for him to light a fire and cook.
𝚏𝐫𝚎𝗲𝕨𝐞𝐛𝕟𝚘𝐯𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝗺

But after changing into clean clothes, his senses stirred. He rose into the air and rode the wind straight into the clouds. Sure enough, the waters were roaring thunderously outside the protective formation. The jade-red sea surged with deep rumblings.

Woooo...

A faint conch horn echoed from afar, growing nearer. Fish and shrimp leaped across the sea under the brightening sky. Bluish-green backs breached the surface, and countless enormous beasts seemed to be stirring beneath the waves.

The sea looked as if it were boiling. One by one, demonic creatures rose from the depths and halted mid-air. Some held sabers, and the others held spears or halberds. The armored and robed creatures were lined up in symmetrical formations on either side of a path, glaring with bulging fish eyes.

"Hm?" Kongheng began softly reciting scripture as he calmly watched the sea. The ocean gradually parted, and a massive blue-scaled beast with a horse’s face and an oxen’s body rose from the depths.

Boom!

Water crashed down on either side like a waterfall as the beast stopped near the shore. Its body was as large as a small mountain and its eyes were the size of huts. It stared silently at Kongheng with dark blue-black pupils. The monk was no larger than a single scale.

Most of the island was cast into shadow by the sea beast’s form. The monk Kongheng fidgeted nervously with his prayer beads, raising his bronze monk staff, which clinked softly in his grip.

"Fellow Daoist..."

A dense swarm of shrimp and crabs prostrated themselves at the feet of the beast. Several water snakes stood upright like men, sounding conch shells with eerie rhythms. The cultivators on the shore were enveloped in the beast’s shadow, struck speechless by awe and dread.

Ding-dang...

At last, Kongheng lifted his brows and noticed bronze chains trailing from the beast’s body deep into the sea. A green-scaled fish leapt up from below.

The green fish rode the waves forward. It had a pair of scaled wings beneath its ribs and bulging eyes. When it reached the shore, it transformed into human form. It was dressed in a black-green robe, laughing heartily as it spoke, "Master Monk Kongheng! It’s been a long time!"

Kongheng’s calm expression finally cracked. He clutched his monk staff tightly, then exhaled deeply and shook his head as he replied, "You... you... Fellow Daoist Huiyao! Why all this pomp and spectacle!"

Huiyao chuckled sheepishly and said in a low voice, "Please don’t take offense, Master Monk... I was ordered to patrol the sea, so the grand display was somewhat unavoidable. I ask your pardon..."

Kongheng frowned slightly and asked, "May I ask what orders you are carrying out?"

The green-scaled fish, now in robes and appearing rather dignified, waved his hand with a grin and said, "To offer congratulations!"

Kongheng paused, lifted his head in thought, and saw the sky above clearing of clouds and fog. A great wind surged, heat rippled through the air, and heavenly light blazed with intensity.

The heir has broken through... thought Kongheng.

Huiyao’s fish-like face glistened with mucus as he laughed heartily and said, "This humble sea general offers congratulations to your esteemed family on behalf of the Dragon Son!"

Kongheng finally let out a breath of relief and nodded. Only a monk like him, with a calm temper, could settle the matter with a few chants. Had it been another Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, being startled like this would surely have earned Huiyao a few angry rebukes.

When Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace had changed hands, Huiyao had gathered his own cultivators to help slay a demonic creature. Word had it that he had since fared well under the new lord. Kongheng assumed that thanks to that assistance, Huiyao had risen in rank, and now his presence at sea carried considerable weight.

The two waited for fifteen minutes. The plants on the ground began to wither slightly, and clouds of yellow mist swirled into the sky, each as large as a cartwheel. Kongheng narrowed his eyes and saw silhouettes moving in the clouds, with the faint cries of warhorses echoing within.

Huiyao stared fixedly at the sky. After a few more moments, the celestial phenomena vanished completely, and only then did he descend before the hall.

The monk stepped forward. Bright light burst from the windows and doors of the hall like a blade of white, illuminating both man and demon’s faces in dazzling radiance. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. Heavenly light flooded the hall, surging toward the upper seat. Huiyao followed closely and looked up.

A deep-golden halberd was planted upside-down in the center of the hall. Its shaft curved like a crescent moon, with a bright white arc etched at its center. A brilliant light flowed like water from it.

The demonic creature stared blankly as the scent of flowers brushed his nose. His gaze moved past the halberd and finally landed on a young man seated at the head of the hall.

The youth wore golden-white soft armor adorned with black profound patterns. His sleeves were tightly fastened, and he was half leaned against the chair’s back. He slowly raised his head and revealed a sharp jawline. His slightly narrow eyes were calmly open.

Huiyao had once seen Li Yuanjiao and felt this youth shared a resemblance, though he appeared more refined. But his eyebrows were longer, his eyes slightly wider, and he exuded an indescribable presence.

He does not look like a man, but rather like a dragon transformed into human form... That sly and cunning glint between his brows, it’s just like Li Yuanjiao, or perhaps even more intense... thought Huiyao.

Huiyao once knew nothing of the cunning and wickedness of humans until he met Li Yuanjiao. Only then did he understand that such traits were common in mankind. Yet, never since had he seen anyone like him—until now.

As these thoughts flickered through his mind, Li Zhouwei slowly raised his long brows. His dark golden eyes focused, and Huiyao felt a chill sweep through his body. His heart trembled slightly as he thought, He must have cultivated some kind of eye technique meant to intimidate... This must be the Li Family heir... The one the Dragon Son said was the least human. Yes, it must be him. And besides, there are no other Bright Yang cultivators present.

He felt the youth’s gaze shining like sunlight and stinging his face. He couldn’t help but lower his head. He copied human etiquette with a cupped-fist salute and said loudly, "Huiyao, patrol general of the Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace, greets the heir!"

The youth at the top seat rose to his feet. His black boots clicked against the floor with a few crisp echoes. His voice was clear and carried a hint of a smile as it echoed through the hall, "You are too courteous, Fellow Daoist!"

But Huiyao remained bowed, swinging his robe and stepping forward with one leg. Using the grand salutation of the dragon kin, he knelt down with a thud, bowed toward the east, pressing his forehead to the floor.

He then turned and bowed to the heir. His voice was respectful and slightly high-pitched as he said, "This humble demon, blessed by the dragon’s decree, bows again and again. I speak on behalf of the Resplendent Dragon King and the Crown Prince of the White Dragon Ancestry, the Dragon Son, Lord of the Scarlet Pristine Sea, commander of the Zhunan shrimp and crab regiments..."

His tone was exceedingly respectful and drawn out, his green-black robe sweeping the floor as he chanted, " To humbly invite the heir’s immortal presence to grace our Serpent Dragon Palace!"




# Chapter 943: Dingjiao

The Dragon Son extends his invitation... Kongheng immediately looked up. Li Zhouwei was staring thoughtfully at Huiyao, who was still kneeling on the ground. The monk suddenly felt a pang of regret, Huiyao’s really picked up some tricks over the years. He’s grown cunning.

Kongheng wasn’t ignorant of worldly scheming, but as a monk of Buddhist teachings, he could not allow himself to judge others with suspicion. It was only now that realization struck; this whole grand display had been the Serpent Dragon Palace’s invitation banquet. Huiyao had intentionally used a congratulatory excuse to brush him off, fearing the monk might refuse the invitation on the heir’s behalf.

The old demon’s a fast learner. After decades of practice, he’s mastered the act! thought Kongheng.

Now that the meeting had happened in person and Huiyao had bowed to invite the heir, turning down the invitation would be a direct insult to the Dragon Son. And with the dragon’s power in full bloom, there were likely few in the Eastern Sea who would dare to do such a thing.

As the monk pondered, Li Zhouwei descended from the platform. With a crisp clang, the crescent-bladed halberd vanished into a storage pouch. He stepped in front of Huiyao and spoke softly, "Please rise, Fellow Daoist."

Huiyao’s heart gave a sudden jolt as he heard Li Zhouwei pass by and step toward the edge of the main hall.

The heir smiled faintly as he said, "How could I possibly disobey the invitation of the Dragon Son?"

Relieved, Huiyao got up and turned to Kongheng, speaking in a low voice, "Fellow Daoist, I ask you to open the formation."

As Kongheng began casting spells and forming seals, the invisible barrier in the sky faded away. Huiyao removed a large orange-red conch from his waist, pressed it to his lips, puffed up his cheeks, and blew. A thunderous sound echoed at once.

Woooooo...

The shoreline waters surged skyward as two massive walls of seawater rose on the ocean surface, joining together and rolling over the many pavilions of the island until it reached the entrance of the main hall.

Whoooosh!

A salty mist swept in with the tide. Kongheng watched from afar, thinking bitterly that his freshly washed clothes had gone to waste. Jade-red water steps formed beneath Li Zhouwei’s feet. Huiyao made a gesture of invitation, and Li Zhouwei stepped forward. The water beneath him receded and flowed directly onto the sea beast.

Chains rattled furiously as the sea beast strained mightily to pull. Each of its scales vibrated with a hum, and whirlpools erupted across the sea. Slowly, a palace was dragged forth from the depths. Its walls were built from coral, adorned with pearls and jade, and water cascaded from its ledges like waterfalls. It was vibrant, dazzling, and magnificently ornate.

What a splendid palace... thought Li Zhouwei.

This was merely the Dragon Son’s vehicle, yet its palace halls far outnumbered the buildings of Zongquan Island.

Huiyao led him in as night-illuminating pearls lit up on either side. He pointed to the great hall on the right and said respectfully, "The main hall is reserved for the Dragon Son’s personal use. Please proceed to the hall on the right."

Li Zhouwei glanced around. There was another palace to the left that was only slightly less grand than the main hall. It was likely meant to host Purple Mansion Realm guests.

He followed Huiyao into the right hall, who explained, "Please wait a while, my lord. I’ll be steering the Bicolor Scaled Beast. Our journey leads to the Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace beneath the Eastern Sea, just above the netherworld. Though this beast is skilled in traversing water, it will still take three to five days."

Li Zhouwei nodded silently, and Huiyao withdrew in a hurry. Two pure and charming clam maidens entered from a side chamber. Night-illuminating pearls lit up one by one, illuminating the various coral ornaments in the hall, and they brewed tea for him.

Li Zhouwei reached out to accept a cup and saw that it was clear jade-colored spirit tea.

Huiyao really does know our family well. At least he didn’t serve any kind of blood food, thought Li Zhouwei.

He set the cup casually on the table and looked up at the coral throne in the center. The armrests on either side were made of Hooked Serpent heads, their eyes tightly shut, with delicate white scales. These were likely esteemed ones among the Hooked Serpent clan.

They are nothing more than decorations before dragon kin...

Li Zhouwei took a seat nearby and quietly observed. This sea beast, after all, was the Dragon Son’s steed, and it moved with such smoothness that there was no sense of traveling through the seabed. After some contemplation, he raised his estimation of the Dragon Son’s status once again.

After all, dragon kin rarely produce offspring. Once they reach adulthood, they are already at the Purple Mansion Realm, and the most noble of all demonic creatures in the world...

Li Zhouwei knew of two Dragon Monarchs. One was Beijia Dragon Monarch, and the other was Xiyang Dragon Monarch. The former ruled over Converging Waters and was a true scion of the ancient True Hornless Dragon. He was likely among the oldest beings alive.

Of the nine sons of the True Hornless Dragon and the six converging three pristine, only two still roam the world. Xiyang Dragon Monarch is the rising star. So apart from the Lord of Converging Waters, there is yet another Dragon Monarch. This makes three True Monarch-level beings in total.

This Dragon Son... is also titled Crown Prince of the White Dragon Ancestry...

Among everyone the Li Family knew, perhaps only the young Sword Immortal Wang Xun could compare to the Dragon Son. That young master from the Tuoba family was far behind.

Li Zhouwei had taken three years to break through to Foundation Establishment Realm, moving at a steady pace. His Radiant Origin Pass had coalesced within him, and his mana had shone like radiant light. Using the fifth-grade technique Radiant Essence Scripture, his Immortal Foundation was the most magnificent one ever forged in the history of the Li Family.

Though Li Ximing also cultivated the Radiant Essence Scripture, he had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm when he acquired it, so he could never match Zhouwei’s pure and proper attainment.

"In addition to seizing celestial light, capturing flames, and warding off evil and disaster, the Radiant Origin Pass can manifest physically to subdue enemies. This Immortal Foundation also holds strong affinity with separating fire, and can condense radiant flame into armor and troops as servants."

Even the same Immortal Foundation could produce slight variations depending on who cultivated it. Li Zhouwei wasn’t sure whether the marvels he manifested came from the Radiant Essence Scripture or from his own unique nature.

He muttered, "These two minor marvels... the first has its uses. The second, not so much."

Though he had yet to use them, he estimated that these armored troops would, at best, reach the level of the Qi Cultivation Realm. They would be of little practical use most of the time in battles between Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

"As for spells and techniques..."

Li Zhouwei had spent over twenty years cultivating, with most of that time dedicated to studying spell arts that were mostly of second or third grade. He’d heard that those arts would undergo some transformations after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm. But at present, they merely felt easier to cast.

"The grades are simply too low to be useful in real combat, except for two."
𝓯𝓻𝓮𝙚𝙬𝓮𝙗𝒏𝙤𝒗𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝒐𝓶

When facing enemies, the only techniques he truly relied on were The Grand Veined Golden Eyes and the Armor Cycle Soul-Refining Halberd Art. The former was a perception art, and the latter was a halberd combat art. Both kinds of spell arts had unexpectedly evolved after he reached Foundation Establishment Realm.

The Grand Veined Golden Eyes had become even more wondrous. It had gone beyond its original ability to see through illusions and falsehoods, and now emitted an aura of intimidation. When activated, anyone without a corresponding spell art or Immortal Foundation would instinctively feel overwhelmed and panicked, as though they couldn’t possibly win.

As for the Armor Cycle Soul-Refining Halberd Art, it was a demonic Dao halberd method, forged through enemy slaughter. Now, even the radiant armored troops he summoned could use it to empower him further.

"It seems the cultivation method must be compatible, only then will the breakthrough to Foundation Establishment Realm bring meaningful transformations. Otherwise, it’s just smoother casting at best."

Since this palace was, after all, another’s vessel, it was far from safe for cultivation, especially since it was filled with the aura of Converging Water. Li Zhouwei simply sat at the main seat. The clam maidens nearby, seeing he hadn’t touched the tea, stood silently with the jade teapot, not daring to look at him.

Three days passed in a flash. When the Bicolor Scaled Beast halted, the great palace on its back slowly sank beneath the sea. Enchanted by mana, it settled gently onto the deep blue seabed, leaving the surrounding rocks and silt completely undisturbed.

Li Zhouwei pushed open the palace doors and stepped out into a world of deep azure. Above him, the sea loomed pitch-black. Gemstones and pearls glowed like lanterns, lighting the seawater in an eerie yet vivid blue. The ground was made of dark crimson reefs.

The seabed of the Eastern Sea was not a place ordinary cultivators, or even most Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators could access. Li Zhouwei had never heard it described before. Now, using the faint light and activating his Grand Veined Golden Eyes, he looked far into the distance and saw nothing but endless, sprawling palaces.

Huiyao was standing on the palace steps ahead, smiling obsequiously and following two demonic creatures closely, doing his utmost to please them. One had bulging cheeks and black armor, with a mouth full of fangs. The other had a bulging belly, a massive mouth, and long whiskers. Both wore clothes resembling human garments and approached carrying tridents.

The black-armored, thick-cheeked demon general spoke in a gruff voice, "This is the Tail Subkingdom of the Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace. Honored guest, please follow me."

Huiyao was bowing so low he was nearly kissing the floor. He clearly had no standing to speak. Li Zhouwei nodded calmly and followed behind.

The middle-aged demon with the huge mouth and long whiskers spoke first, his tone gentle and soft, "The Tail Subkingdom is the Clam Kingdom. Though its population thrives, the citizens live beneath the sand. The queen recently became pregnant with a pearl, so she is unable to come out and greet you. We beg your pardon for this."

"It’s no bother," replied Li Zhouwei, glancing around curiously. The space was truly vast. Since the common folk lived beneath the sand, these palaces were likely meant for the shrimp and crab soldiers.

He thought to himself, How vast the Eastern Sea must be. If every corner harbors a demon kingdom, wouldn’t it rival several inland territories? No wonder the dragon clans are content beneath the waves... it’s far more comfortable than living ashore.

They traveled at great speed for several hundred kilometers. In the distance, he gradually made out a dark stone wall within the waters. It seemed to reach all the way to the heavens, and stretched endlessly in both directions.

The middle-aged man with the massive mouth and long whiskers spoke in a low voice, "Honored guest, you’ve cultivated an eye technique. Be sure not to look at the wall."

The golden glow faded from Li Zhouwei’s eyes. When he looked again with mortal vision, he saw only darkness, though faint glimmers of cold light hinted at several long pillars.

A thought stirred in Li Zhouwei’s mind as he asked softly, "Oh? And what’s the story behind it?"

The demon general with bulging cheeks and dark armor finally spoke, his voice low and rough, "The Eighth Young Master is up there."

The youth paused slightly, then immediately understood. He lowered his gaze, fixing it on the dark red reef beneath his feet. The two demon generals buried their heads into their shoulders and fell silent.

Who could be so universally referred to by sea demons as the Eighth Young Master? Only the Dragon Monarch of the Pristine Water Dao, the very origin of the Scarlet Pristine Sea’s hue, the eighth son of the True Hornless Dragon!

The Li Family had records of this sea once being called Qunyi two thousand years ago. It was renamed when the eighth son of the Converging Water True Hornless Dragon was captured here. The dragon clan had chained him to the depths of a seacliff, forging nine cold-iron pillars to pin him down. They had slaughtered and dismembered him, turning the sea green overnight, and thus the Scarlet Pristine Sea was born.

Slaughtered and dismembered... no matter how many corpses remain, this place is the burial site of a True Monarch, a son of the True Hornless Dragon!

He knew that he carried talisman seeds within him and wouldn’t be instantly killed just by looking, but he restrained his curiosity and walked on with a lowered gaze.

The long-whiskered demon beside him whispered, "The Pristine and Converging Daos generate and transform each other. Cultivating here yields great benefits. You likely don’t know but many cultivators once friendly with our dragon clan dwell in caves above."

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod and followed them into the cliff. A vast open space appeared ahead, and high above hung a great plaque, Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace.

He stepped inside to find a palace bathed in clear blue. The eerie mix of red and green was gone. The structure was built primarily of crystal, with fish and shrimp winding their way through rich, concentrated spiritual energy.

The two demons led him up the winding path through the palace until they stopped beside a grand hall overlooking the entire Serpent Dragon Palace.

The massive-mouthed demon said, "Please, this way."

Li Zhouwei stepped forward, opened the jade-like palace doors, and saw several women in pink robes singing with raised sleeves. There was a single figure sitting at the head of the hall.

He wore a silver robe embroidered with waves and dragons. His face was as refined as sculpted jade, with thick brows running into his temples and a tall, noble brow. Two silvery markings trailed from his temples upward to his pair of white horns.

His black hair cascaded down, and his pupils shone pale blue. He fixed his gaze on Li Zhouwei, raised a brow slightly, and said nothing.

Just then, someone to the side stood up and looked at Li Zhouwei. She hopped barefoot down from the platform, her movements leaving the gentle sound of bells in their wake.

She landed before him with a cheerful smile and said, "Greetings, Fellow Daoist!"

It was a young girl who was no more than twelve or thirteen. She had a clean and bright face. Tiny red feathers grew from the corners of her eyes, which were dark red and full of warmth. When she reached him, she gave a perfectly proper bow.

Li Zhouwei returned the gesture, golden light flickering in his eyes once again. He turned to the white-horned youth seated at the head of the hall and said in a steady voice, "Minghuang of Moongaze Lake greets the Dragon Son."

"Mm." The youth glanced at him. Seeing that he did not kneel, he rotated the cup in his hand and said softly, "Dingjiao, white serpent dragon of Clear Sea and Still Pond lineage."

His bearing was refined and unpretentious. Without any air of arrogance, he gestured to a seat beside him for Li Zhouwei. A maidservant brought over wine. The white serpent dragon glanced at the girl beside him and said softly, "Minghuang, this is Fellow Daoist Wupian from Verdant Parasol Forest[1] in Northern Yan."

The red-feathered girl kept smiling and nodded, "Chongli lineage, Wuping fire-yang luan[2]. Wupian greets Fellow Daoist."

Li Zhouwei understood at once. He thought to himself, A white serpent dragon and a fire-yang luan, neither of them are ordinary demonic creatures...

This luan looked quiet and refined, but she was quite talkative. She immediately spoke again with a smile, "Fellow Daoist Minghuang, are you the eldest son... or the second?"

Li Zhouwei found the question rather out of the blue. He gave her a friendly smile, but before he could answer, the white serpent dragon Dingjiao spoke first, raising his cup toward him, "Golden eyes of that shade, likely the eldest?"
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

Li Zhouwei seemed thoughtful, but showed no sign of discomfort. He raised his cup in return and replied, "Your guess is correct."

"Good... very good..." The luan girl Wupian let out a relieved sigh and said with a smile, "Then things will go smoothly... The white qilin may be fierce, but he can be a friend. That white cicada, on the other hand, is no good!"

"Wupian..." Dingjiao interrupted her and turned to Li Zhouwei with a hearty laugh. "Minghuang, you may not know this, but Emperor Gong of Wei in his youth was a golden-eyed white qilin with scales beneath his neck. My grandfather and him were close friends. My father even met him once and would call him ‘uncle.’"

"So there was such a connection..." Li Zhouwei was slightly surprised. But thinking further, it wasn’t odd as the Wei's Li regime had once unified the North with unmatched prestige. Having ties to the dragon clans was only natural.

Still, judging by the current state of affairs, he had never heard of any deep alliance between the dragons and the Wei's Li Family. His own family certainly hadn’t received any real aid. It was likely nothing more than superficial friendship.

"May I ask... which Dragon King is your honored elder?" asked Li Zhouwei.

Dingjiao’s pale blue eyes shifted slightly. He gave a faint smile and emphasized each word, "Dongfang You!"

1. 青梧 (Qingwu) – “Verdant Parasol” Refers to the 梧桐 (Chinese parasol tree) with 青 (deep green or blue-green) foliage. In classical lore, it symbolizes purity, elegance, and is said to attract phoenixes. Often used poetically to evoke noble solitude or a sacred setting. ☜

2. 鸾 (Luán) is a legendary bird in Chinese mythology, similar to the phoenix but distinct in status and symbolism. Often paired with the phoenix (凤), the luán represents harmony, virtue, and auspicious omens. It is said to sing beautifully and only appear in peaceful, righteous times. In poetry, it may also symbolize noble women or sacred union. ☜




# Chapter 945: A Dragon's Request

“My father is the Dragon King of Bei Sea, a son of Dongfang You,” said Dingjiao.

Dongfang You...

Li Zhouwei had deliberately studied before coming to the Eastern Sea, so naturally he recognized the name. Dongfang You was a Dragon King who had reached the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm but had perished while attempting a Golden Core Realm breakthrough. His fall gave rise to the phenomenon known as Falling Water Rising Storm.

Now that he had achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm and had a photographic memory, the details swiftly came back to him, Huiyao once mentioned that the original master of the Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace was Dingyuan the Dragon Son. After Dongfang You failed to ascend, Dingyuan lost his backing and was stripped of his position. He was sent back to the Converging Water Sea...

So he showed a trace of admiration and offered a compliment before asking, “May I ask, Dingyuan the Dragon Son is...”

“Oh.” Dingjiao took a sip of spirit wine as a girl in pink robes tapped lightly on his back. He tilted his white horns and raised his brows with a smile, saying, “He’s my second brother. He was punished and sent back to Xia Mountain. I had no choice but to return from the Northern Sea to guard this place in his stead.”

Hearing him say 'had no choice,' Li Zhouwei deduced that Dingjiao and Dingyuan were likely aligned, they were both grandsons of Dongfang You. Losing control of the palace may have been punishment for Dingyuan, but for a crown prince like Dingjiao, being stationed here likely wasn’t much better.

He set down the pale green jade cup and said softly, “A pity.”

Dingjiao let his gaze wander lazily over the dancing girls below and said softly, “Minghuang, I invited you here for two reasons. First, our elders once shared ties, so we may as well renew them. Second... there’s something I’d like to inquire about.”

He turned the cup slowly in his hand and asked gently, “I’ve heard your esteemed family once had some connection with the demon den of Mount Dali. Is that true?”

Li Zhouwei wasn’t clear on the relationship between the dragon clans and the fox tribe of Mount Dali. He paused briefly, then answered calmly, “Our ancestors did have a friendship with a direct descendant fox demon from Mount Dali, but as generations passed, the connection has gradually faded...”

“Good.” Dingjiao’s gaze remained on the women in the hall, his pale blue eyes shifting slightly beneath his high brow as he replied, “I ask that you seek out a fox of Mount Dali on my behalf. If possible, I’d like to meet with one. If this matter succeeds, I will see to it that you are rewarded.”

Li Zhouwei hesitated for a moment. His family’s only connection to Mount Dali’s demon den was through the White Banyan Fox, which was really just a bond through Li Tongya. Though the Li Family still sent spirit paddies into the mountains each year and the White Banyan Fox continued accepting them, they rarely met anymore.

After all, friendship fades with distance, as they say...

Sensing no hostility in Dingjiao’s tone toward Mount Dali, he didn’t agree right away but replied, “If it’s convenient, might you share the reason? I wouldn’t presume to ask the foxes on the Dragon Son’s behalf without cause.”

“Just call me Dingjiao.” Dingjiao corrected him with precise formality, then added softly, “You’re one of our kind, Minghuang, so I don’t mind telling you. I need the hearing technique of the Mount Dali foxes to listen in on a certain trench in the sea. But we dragon kin cannot enter the mainland, and ordinary demons cannot even find the foxes.”

“I see.” Although Dingjiao looked entirely forthright, Li Zhouwei couldn’t tell how much of it was true. It was best left to the foxes of Mount Dali to judge, so he nodded and said, “Very well, I’ll deliver the message on your behalf, Brother Dingjiao!”

“Haha.” Dingjiao chuckled, and music began to play in the hall. The Dragon Son pulled the pink-robed girl into his arms and began fondling her as he spoke casually, “Brother Minghuang, since you're a white qilin, surely your offspring must be abundant. Of all the dynasties under the heavens, only the Wei lineage prospered so greatly. Do you know any techniques you could teach me?”

Li Zhouwei stiffened at once. Lustfulness was a trait often associated with dragons, and this white serpent dragon was no exception. The moment business was concluded, his first question was about bedroom arts.

Li Zhouwei responded with a smile, “Most of my family’s heritage has been lost, and such techniques are even rarer. It's hardly of any use nowadays.”

He had deflected, but had already gleaned much from Dingjiao’s tone, thinking inwardly, This white serpent dragon has never truly regarded me as a human. Though he invited the heir of the Li Family, he sees me only as a white qilin in human form. Otherwise... with such noble blood, why would he be so courteous?

Dingjiao didn’t press further. He laughed for a while, then used the topic to share a few amusing anecdotes about past Wei emperors before nodding. “If Brother Minghuang ever comes across a Bright Yang spirit item that promotes fertility, I hope you’ll think of me. We dragon kin may lack in many things, but spirit items and dharma artifacts? We have plenty, we’ll make sure you’re satisfied!”

The red-feathered girl Wupian covered her mouth and giggled, casting a glance at Li Zhouwei as she spoke in a gentle tone, “I’m not as well-behaved as Brother Dingjiao. If I ever fly over Jiangnan and stop to rest at Moongaze Marsh, I hope Brother Minghuang won’t drive me away.”

Li Zhouwei was, after all, a born spiritual variant. Most of the night passed as the three chatted and joked. They grew much more familiar with each other over time.

Dingjiao gave Li Zhouwei a long, measuring look, then turned and called the giant-mouthed, long-whiskered man over with a sharp tone, “Go fetch my Dry Yang Bangles!”

The whiskered man hurried off and soon returned carrying a jade box.

Dingjiao slapped the box onto the table with a loud thud, and flipped open the lid, revealing two bright, gleaming golden bangles. He smiled and said, “Brother Zhouwei! These are Bright Yang treasures, they'll be yours if you get this matter done!”

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow slightly and glanced at the box. The two gold bangles were somewhat thick; it was not the sort of dharma artifact meant for binding others. Rather, they seemed meant to be worn on the wrists. What sort of mystique they held remained to be seen.

Dingjiao exerted a bit of force, lifting the two golden bangles without a word and handing them to him. Li Zhouwei felt a warm sensation as he took them; the bangles were light as walnuts.

He spun them twice between two fingers, examined them thoroughly, and praised, “These are indeed fine treasures.”

Dingjiao looked away, glancing at the fire luan Wupian. The two exchanged a glance, and Dingjiao thought to himself, He can lift the Dry Yang Bangles, he truly is a genuine white qilin.

Though Dingjiao and Wupian had already suspected he was a white qilin, they had to be certain to avoid any embarrassing mistakes. That was why he’d brought out the treasured bangles. Now confirmed, Dingjiao looked at him with even more warmth.

Li Zhouwei glanced at the bangles again, then casually returned them to the jade box. Lifting his eyes, he said softly, “Brother Dingjiao, there’s no need for such courtesy. Whether this matter succeeds depends on Mount Dali. We’ve spoken freely as friends, no dharma artifact is needed just to pass along a message.”

He pushed the jade box back, but Dingjiao pressed his hand on top of it and looked up. The smile faded from his lips as he said quietly, “This is something that must be made clear.”

Li Zhouwei set down his cup and shook his head. He said, “If we’re keeping accounts, then having the Bicolor Scaled Beast carry me in a palace into the sea already settles the debt for delivering the message.”

Li Zhouwei had always been wary. Dingjiao had caused quite a stir by bringing out his mount and escorting him across the sea in a palace. The spectacle alone had silenced any doubts. Earlier, Li Zhouwei had been worried about returning from the outer sea, but with such a display, no one would dare act until all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators got to the bottom of it.

This was merely delivering a message. Dingjiao hadn’t even asked him to persuade anyone. Though Li Zhouwei knew he was unique, so were people like Xu Xiao, Tu Longjian, and others of the Changxiao lineage.

At first, Dingjiao’s reasoning had seemed plausible. But the moment Li Zhouwei held the Bright Yang Bangles, a sweep of his spiritual sense was all it took for him to recognize it, A Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact. No, an ancient one at that!

Even cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm would fight to the death over this. No matter how wealthy the dragon kin were, how could they casually gift such a thing for a minor favor? His suspicions surged to the peak, so how could he dare accept it?

His words were purely factual, but Dingjiao paused at that, looking pensive. He said softly, “Very well...”

Dingjiao stowed the jade box away and hesitated for a moment, seemingly distracted. He spoke less, and after another hour, Li Zhouwei rose to take his leave. The white-horned Dragon Son accompanied him out of the hall, his expression solemn as he said in a low tone, “This visit may have lacked in hospitality, please don’t hold it against me, Brother Minghuang.”

Li Zhouwei thought briefly, then shook his head and said, “Why say that, Brother Dingjiao? Once I have news, I’ll send it down through Huiyao.”

Two demonic creatures escorted him out. The white serpent dragon turned and reentered the hall, frowning with a hint of regret as he said, “Wupian, I fear this white qilin was sincere in wanting to befriend me. Yet I tried to win him over with a spirit artifact... His family has declined, so he’s naturally cautious. I fear I acted poorly this time.”

The fire luan also reined in her smile. Dingjiao sat down, sipped his wine, and soon relaxed, speaking softly, “Uncle Heyun once mentioned the Li Family. Coincidentally, the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling has a Li Qinghong. Who's to say it wasn’t a subtle nudge from him? If possible, it wouldn’t hurt to befriend this white qilin.”

“Dongfang Heyun...” Wupian shook her head with a smile, asking curiously, “What exactly is Dongfang Heyun’s position in your family? I’ve heard he’s temperamental and difficult, but also that he’s gentle and cultured. Why such opposite impressions?”

“Heyun...” Dingjiao organized his thoughts and shook his head. “His standing with the Dragon Monarch is quite high. Since he’s connected to the birth of a True Monarch, he possesses many exceptional and mysterious abilities. Still, we Dragon Sons can summon him at will...”

He added quietly, “My mother said, once the Dragon Monarch swallows thunder, Uncle Heyun will reap unimaginable benefits. It’s not just about attaining divine powers, so now is the time to strengthen ties with him.”

————

Li Qinghong flew eastward. She had just exited the Moongaze Lake territory and entered the riverside wilderness, when she suddenly noticed the sky turn a deep shade of purple.

A cluster of drifting clouds had shifted into a pale violet hue, as the setting sun in the distance tinted the clouds gold above and purple below. They then floated across the crimson-violet sky.

She rarely saw such a spectacle and guessed that someone might have ascended to the Purple Mansion Realm, or perhaps fallen from it. She decreased her altitude and swiftly flew through the wilderness, continuing to head east.

The territory of Profound Peak Gate lay around Lake Xian. Li Qinghong arrived on lightning and asked briefly at the formation's edge. When the disciple heard she was from the Moongaze Li Family, he rushed into the sect to report her arrival.

After only a short wait, a woman in a riverland robe flew out on the wind, landed nearby, and anxiously checked on Li Qinghong. Seeing her in fair condition, she approached with some unease and whispered, “Sister Qinghong...”

“Sister Tingyun,” Li Qinghong responded politely. Knowing this wasn’t the place to talk, Kong Tingyun quickly led her through the formation and flew toward the main peak.

Li Qinghong rarely visited the interior of Profound Peak Gate, let alone ventured this deep. As they ascended toward the main peak, she saw bizarrely shaped mountains on either side, each emanating distinct auras. Some had fire veins rising skyward, and others had lakes within a kilometer or two that had clearly been relocated here.

She glanced around and noticed the sky above Profound Peak Gate was also a wash of violet and crimson, with purple-gold clouds drifting slowly overhead. Li Qinghong murmured, “Judging by this celestial sign, has some Daoist Master passed away?”

Kong Tingyun heard the calm in her tone and sighed in relief, then answered softly, “It was Daoist Master Zipei of the Purple Smoke Gate. A few days ago, our sect’s Daoist Master went to witness her advancement. Judging from the sky, it's nearly certain she failed and perished.”

Daoist Master Zipei!

Li Qinghong certainly remembered that Daoist Master. She had likely been the most powerful cultivator across both Jiangnan and Jiangbei ever since her breakthrough after Shangyuan. But now, after several years, she still failed to achieve the Golden Core Realm like True Monarch Shangyuan.

Kong Tingyun hesitated briefly and then said softly, “My sect’s elder once told me that this Daoist Master... nearly became Dao companions with Daoist Master Donghua. But fate had other plans, and they eventually turned against one another...”

“Hmm...” Though the Daoist Master was most likely dead, Li Qinghong didn’t dare comment further. Kong Tingyun, also reluctant to speak too much, casually changed the subject, “With Purple Smoke Gate weakened, there’s no longer anyone in Yue State who clearly stands above the rest.”

Once they entered the cave dwelling, she spoke apologetically, “Qinghong... I had planned to help with the matter of the Radiant Sky Stone, but the situation changed so quickly, and the information I gave turned out wrong. I truly feel sorry.”

Li Qinghong hadn’t blamed her at all. She shook her head and said, “You meant well, sister. I understand.”

Kong Tingyun gently shook her head and replied, “Some things are simply beyond my power. Still, both messages of the battle at the riverbank and the Radiant Sky Stone came from me. So I can’t deny responsibility.”

She pointed to the stone table where two jade boxes rested, and said softly, “I felt guilty, so I brought two spell arts. They can’t make up for the matter with Xijun, but at least they show my sincerity...”

Li Qinghong initially refused and pushed them back, but Kong Tingyun quietly said, “If you refuse, it would mean you’re holding a grudge.”

Li Qinghong had always gotten along well with her and knew she wasn’t to blame. She finally nodded, and Kong Tingyun smiled, picked up one box, opened it, and introduced, “This is a third-grade cultivation method, the Bright Origin Observation and Separation Technique. If fully cultivated, it forms the Everbright Platform Immortal Foundation!”

She took out the rather aged jade slip and said softly, “It comes from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven. Though hard to master, this Immortal Foundation can turn light into fire, transform into countless forms, entangle and bind, shield the user, or become a penstroke of light that stuns the spirit with fire...

“This technique isn’t of high rank by today’s standards, but its name was different in ancient times. In the main branch of the Wei's Li lineage, it was a higher-grade method known as Imperial Observation Origin.”

Imperial Observation Origin.

Li Qinghong committed everything to memory and thought the ancient name sounded more fitting. After all, the Wei's Li True Monarchs were emperors, and their Immortal Foundations would naturally reflect such transformations.

She replied, “Thank you, sister!”

But Kong Tingyun shook her head and replied softly, “It’s just a third-grade method. Though from a grotto heaven, it’s extremely hard to cultivate and difficult to gather qi. It’s rather tasteless, honestly. I wouldn’t use this alone to brush you off.”

She picked up the other box and smiled. “But this next item was obtained directly from a Daoist Master. It’s truly worth mentioning, since it is a top-tier fourth-grade spell art. My Daoist Master obtained it from Xu State long ago, and now it returns to its rightful heir!”

Li Qinghong accepted the jade slip and noticed it had a faint golden hue, with small characters carved into the corner.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.




# Chapter 947: Scattering of Purple Qi

Li Qinghong picked up the jade slip and found it wasn’t sealed. She could read it the moment she took it. Though she deeply desired it, she still frowned and said, "This is far too valuable."

Kong Tingyun shook her head and softly said, "Sister, take it first. There’s something else I need to talk to you about."

Li Qinghong noticed the seriousness in her expression and had no choice but to set the jade slip down gently. "Please speak, sister."

Kong Tingyun looked at her earnestly, held her hand, and said softly, "Qinghong, does Ximing have the heart to pursue the Purple Mansion Realm?"

Li Qinghong’s heart clenched, and she looked at her with some confusion.

Kong Tingyun hesitated for a second, then spoke seriously, "I know your family has a genius disciple, comparable to Chi Buzi and a revival of the Bright Yang bloodline. Esteemed families have few secrets in Jiangnan. Even Xiao Chuting could only make open moves back then, and was unable to plant hidden ones. All the sects are well aware.

"Wei State has good relations with Green Pine Temple and the Golden Feather Sect, and Emperor Gong of Wei is a wise elder. That’s how the Li Family remained safe in Jiangnan. The Mount Tan Li Family in Wu State doesn’t cultivate the Bright Yang Dao and claims no connection, but their bloodline carries some traces. That alone allows them to stay in Jiangnan, and they have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator among them. So this path is not impossible.

"Everyone in the Purple Mansion Realm knows the Radiant Sky Stone is reserved for the heir, and that time is still far off. But since I’m a bit closer to your family, I can’t help but notice... does Ximing have his eyes on the Purple Mansion Realm? Is he perhaps coveting that Radiant Sky Stone?"

Her eyes brimmed with worry as she offered heartfelt advice, "Sister, you should know better in this matter. Does Ximing even have a five percent chance to break through? The Radiant Sky Stone doesn’t boost your chances just a little. Without enough secret techniques, it’s not much use even if taken. I’ll be blunt, this isn’t something he should pursue on a whim!"

Li Qinghong’s heart eased. When she saw the sincerity in the round-faced woman’s eyes, she suddenly understood.

No wonder the matter of the Radiant Sky Stone concluded the way it did! The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had already predicted we’d stake everything on Minghuang!

Everything done to conceal Minghuang growing up wasn’t in vain. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators only think he has the Bright Yang bloodline, not that he carries a thread of fate!

Li Qinghong didn’t know how confident Li Zhouwei was about breaking into the Purple Mansion Realm. But having witnessed Guo Shentong, Changxiao, and Tu Longjian rise one after another, she believed the odds were high.

After thinking it through, she spoke up, "What role exactly does the Radiant Sky Stone play in the process of forming divine abilities? I hope sister can shed some light."

Kong Tingyun answered softly, "This isn’t easy to explain. The number of secret techniques varies. May I ask how many your family possesses?"

Li Qinghong’s heart skipped a beat, and a thought flashed through her mind like lightning, I’ll just mention however many secret techniques Ximing has cultivated...

She answered, "Only one..."

Kong Tingyun nodded and replied, "That’s perfectly normal. If one can master even a single secret technique, then after consuming the Radiant Sky Stone, it might only raise their chances by five percent."

Li Qinghong nodded regretfully. Seeing this, Kong Tingyun felt like she had listened and gently continued, "These things depend on the individual, but it absolutely can’t be left to Ximing’s whim... Ancient cultivators could resonate with heaven and earth, so breakthroughs were much easier. Treasures like the Radiant Sky Stone were more effective then. Nowadays, the odds are hard to quantify."

Li Qinghong nodded softly and replied, "I’ll remember what you said, Sister."

Kong Tingyun smiled and nodded, but in her heart, Li Qinghong shook her head. Whether the Radiant Sky Stone went to Ximing or Zhouwei, it was no longer within her power or right to decide.

Xijun obtained this treasure. He must have trusted Ximing, and believed Zhouwei would succeed on his own. At most, he thought Zhouwei might be sabotaged early. But whether the Radiant Sky Stone was kept or not made little difference... thought Li Qinghong.

And she, Li Qinghong, would soon head to the Thunder Arts Grotto Heaven. Li Zhouwei would then be the one managing the household. Would he really lay a hand on Li Ximing’s Radiant Sky Stone?

Before Xijun’s death, she thought Li Ximing might willingly hand over the Radiant Sky Stone. But now, seeing the calm in his eyes, she could tell his thoughts were deeply stubborn. It went without saying.

As for the matter of the Thunder Arts Grotto Heaven, she seems completely unaware. It appears Changxi is too fearful to get involved and has said nothing to her. If I bring it up, it’ll only strain our relationship and offend the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

Kong Tingyun forced the jade slip into her hand, and only then did Li Qinghong finally have the mind to glance at the technique, "...Gather heavenly light, absorb the radiance, draw it into the Juque acupoint, and refine it into a form. This becomes the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. Suppress it with spiritual sense, release it from the center of the eyebrows; it can capture malevolent spirits, sever spiritual energy, and cut through good and evil..."

She skimmed it briefly but still accepted it with thanks. After a short conversation, Li Qinghong brought up her impending trip to the Eastern Sea, and Kong Tingyun readily agreed. The two of them then left Lake Xian and headed south together.

————

On the other side, Li Zhouwei had just exited the Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace and was heading toward the Tail Subkingdom. The demon generals on either side carried themselves with far more deference.

The one with bulging cheeks and black armor bowed his head, while the other with a gaping mouth and long whiskers grinned ingratiatingly, "My lord... such righteousness! Our eyes burned with envy seeing a treasure like that, yet you didn’t even take it..."

It was the same two who had brought forth the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact, so they naturally knew what an astonishing treasure Li Zhouwei had declined. When they saw that even Dingjiao treated him with respect, they couldn’t resist fawning over him. In some ways, demons were no different than humans.

The journey was long, and Li Zhouwei made idle conversation. Then, the black-faced demon general with bulging cheeks suddenly muttered, "My lord has such composure. Guo Shentong couldn’t even bear to look away when he was in front of the same Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact..."

At that, Li Zhouwei grew alert. Inwardly, he thought coldly, Guo Shentong?! The same Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact?

He slowed his pace slightly, gazed into the distance, and smiled as he said, "I’ve heard of him. He’s the master of Crimson Reef Island."

The two demons had been offering dry flattery, but seeing that he’d taken an interest, they finally seized the chance to speak and were overjoyed.

The long-whiskered, wide-mouthed demon said, "My lord! The two of us served the crown prince early on, before he even left the palace and when he was still following the Dragon King of Jin[1] Sea... Guo Shentong once came to the Dragon King’s palace and took a command token with him. It was also a spirit artifact."

A spirit artifact... the Six Ding Merging Fire Token! Guo Shentong may have struck a deal with the dragon kin!

He pondered for a moment. These two demons had rambled for quite a while yet still hadn’t explained why Guo Shentong had received such a reward. It was likely that they had not been qualified to attend court and were simply relaying fragments.

Li Zhouwei softly said, "I wonder how he is now."

The black-armored, thick-jawed demon grunted and replied, "That man birthed a Merging Fire Token. The Bin[2] Crow is short-lived and not too bright. He got better after breaking into the Purple Mansion Realm... but still liked taking dangerous risks. He’s been gone a long time now... likely dead..."

Li Zhouwei could tell the demon didn’t know much. They then continued onward to the Tail Subkingdom, which now looked completely different from before. Lanterns flickered everywhere, and the sand was covered in pristine white clams of various sizes. Several clam spirits in pink-white robes, having taken human form, were opening the shells to search for pearls.

A pink-robed woman approached, holding a basket filled with large, round, luminous pearls. The long-whiskered demon received it and spoke in a low voice, "This is a token of the Tail Subkingdom’s sincerity. Please, my lord, take it back with you..."

Only then did he dare bring it forward, watching Li Zhouwei nervously. The clam spirit fell to her knees with a thud, prostrating herself and crying out, "This lowly one swears on her life, it truly was because I was bearing a pearl that I couldn’t move... I beg you, my lord, to see the truth..."

The surrounding demon generals seemed familiar with her and hurried to speak on her behalf. Li Zhouwei had no interest in determining whether the sea clans had deliberately avoided him earlier.

He simply waved a hand and said, "It’s fine."

He stepped forward, and the two demons escorted him into the palace atop the beast mount. Huiyao had been waiting at the entrance in a daze. When he saw them approaching, a mere glance at the demons’ attitude told him most of what he needed to know.

He bowed respectfully and said, "My lord has returned!"

After Li Zhouwei entered the hall, Huiyao quietly tugged at the demons’ sleeves and whispered, "About those sixty thousand teeth..."

"Forget it!" The two demons casually brushed him off and walked away. Huiyao, relieved, entered the hall, only to meet Li Zhouwei’s piercing gaze.

The young man stood in the center of the chamber and asked, "What matter is this?"

Huiyao bowed lower and respectfully replied, "One of the Dragon Son’s eight consorts required a Dharma robe... it must be made using Sea Hui[1] Fangs. The estimate was sixty thousand pieces, originally to be provided by our tribe. Thanks to the heir, the lives of thirty thousand of our children were spared..."

Li Zhouwei, familiar with Eastern Sea customs, had seen much along the way. Only now did he truly understand how lowly Foundation Establishment Realm demonic creatures such as Huiyao and even the queen of the Tail Subkingdom had to be.

He quietly said, "You’ve always been like this."

"Always have been." Huiyao remained standing and asked in confusion, "It’s been this way for millions of years. Why would it be different? Even before we took human form, we lived like this. Every year, my Hui Clan must absorb the essence qi of thousands upon thousands of spirit crabs... It’s the natural order."

Li Zhouwei gave no reply. He watched Huiyao retreat and continued staring into the wine in his cup.

"Dingjiao doesn’t see me as human... then what about Pristine Water? Is a True Monarch human? A True Monarch is like a dragon; a Foundation Establishment Realm like a Hui; and mortals are just crabs. The world above the sea is no different from the seabed."

He stared into his wine in silence. Though Dingjiao’s palace was extravagantly luxurious, filled with laughter and music, none of it had eased Li Zhouwei’s heart. Instead, the demeanor of the Tail Subkingdom and Huiyao kept swirling in his thoughts.

Li Zhouwei had been mature-minded since childhood. He had seen many kinds of people, and now that he had encountered demonic creatures, he realized there wasn’t much difference. They all loved to devour humans.

He couldn’t help but begin to question, They say the Heavenly Dao is broken, and the world turned out like this. But who can say whether the world became this way... or if it was always this way? If the Heavenly Dao is broken... is it better that all beings be free, or that something above still governs them?

Blood food... blood food... Those who refrain from eating humans lose a third of their power. Can they really contend with those who do?

He had never been ordinary since birth. As thoughts swirled in his mind, he mused, "Right or wrong, it doesn’t matter. Since so many elders are wholeheartedly supporting me, how can I let them down?"

Li Zhouwei lifted the hem of the mat to think for a moment, then put it back casually. The sea outside the palace shifted and came to rest. They had likely arrived at the Hui Clan’s territory.

A cluster of shadows approached, and Huiyao lowered his voice as he drove off the younger ones crowding near, "Go on, go on... all of you, get back..."

————

Purple Smoke Blessed Land.

Purple mist gathered ceaselessly in the sky, drifting across the mountain peaks in wisps and tendrils, spiraling upward. Pavilions and towers dotted the land, all stunningly beautiful.

A small pavilion stood upon the endless sea of purple mist. A woman in green robes stood to the side, while a female cultivator in purple leaned against the stone steps. Her flowing skirts fell from the high cliff like the mist itself, and halfway down, they dissolved into purple mist.

Her brows were slightly flat, and her face habitually calm. A rare hint of confusion flickered in her eyes as she gazed far into the distance. The purple mist across the blessed land stirred with her every breath, but Kan Xuyu said nothing.

Beside her, Shen Yanqing stood with a trace of sorrow. Purple energy surged from Kan Xuyu’s body as she raised her fingers to divine and thought silently, The items have already been delivered to the dragon kin. Dongfang Lieyun is still honorable enough not to break his word. That bastard Yuan Su has already promoted Li Xuanfeng, and I can no longer touch him. I've at least done my part by going through the dragon kin...

She said softly, "Yanqing, once I fall, you should return home. Your father is in seclusion, and the Shen Family needs someone to take charge."

Shen Yanqing responded with a nod. The small pavilion was shielded by formations, so there was no fear of being overheard by those in the Purple Mansion Realm above. She murmured, "If Master is reborn and has any requests, just send a letter to my Shen Family... I will always be waiting..."

"There’s no need," Kan Xuyu let out a faint chuckle and shook her head gently, her voice barely audible.

She mentally compared the faces of the Li Family with the one buried deep in her heart, but found no resemblance. Her thoughts drifted, and she spat inwardly, He must be a descendant of one of his family brothers... hmph... surely he wouldn’t have had some illegitimate child behind my back...

Her eyes lit up for a brief moment, and her cold expression melted into a shy smile. But the light vanished just as quickly, and Kan Xuyu looked out toward the sky.

Quite a few had come to witness the ceremony. Though most had believed she would rely on that trace of Metallic Essence to reincarnate and wouldn't achieve much, she was, after all, one of those indebted to Li Jiangqun. So, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators held no small amount of hope.

Purple qi surged skyward from Kan Xuyu’s body, drawing all the purple and crimson hues in the sky toward her. The clouds turned into a pure purple cluster, falling upon her in waves. A purple glow emerged at the center of her brow. She joined two fingers, placed them to her lips, and exhaled a breath of purple qi.

This purple qi was entirely different from the vast purple around her. It was more ethereal, and was tinged with traces of pale white. It was just a single wisp, but it hovered before her and slowly condensed into a pill-like shape.

In that instant, the world echoed with the chanting of Daoist scriptures. The scent of incense filled the air as the mountain ranges of Purple Smoke Blessed Land stirred with a low rumble. Deer raised their heads, and birds fell silent.

Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence!

Purple energy burst across the mountain range. A dense script appeared on every falling leaf. The incense sticks in every burner across the mountain went out on their own, quivering like living beings. Ashes crawled back up the wicks, slowly returning to their unlit form.

The woman in the sky looked like a goddess riding mist, yet sparkling tears rolled down her cheeks. Kan Xuyu was filled with overwhelming joy.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

Brother Jiangqun, I've finally made it through these four hundred years!

The brilliant radiance of the condensed Purple Essence surged into the sky. All the wisps of purple mist she had once scattered across the heavens with her divine abilities were now rushing back, carrying the chanting from every corner of Yue State, all converging into the cluster of qi before her.

But Kan Xuyu suddenly stopped, letting out a quiet sigh.

While all the cultivators marveled at Zipei’s profound cultivation, two shadows high in the sky exchanged glances, both showing surprise.

One of them spoke in a sharp voice, "She... Thankfully we brought the Nine-Layer Attribute Net for her!"

# Chapter 949: Entering The Abyss

Eastern Sea.

Pine winds stirred across Splitreed Island as Li Xizhi changed into white robes and quietly sat by the table. No one else was around, leaving an uncanny silence, with only the moonlight spilling across the table.

The man held a jade wine pot as he paced around the table, never taking a seat.

His wife, Yang Xiao’er, had entered seclusion two years ago to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. There had been no news since, and he often worried. Soon, he received word that Li Xijun had perished in the Eastern Sea while trying to seize the Radiant Sky Stone.

Upon hearing the news, Li Xizhi had collapsed into the inner hall, weeping bitterly, unable to calm himself for a long time. Even after several years, he still often recalled the incident.

“Jun’er.”

Li Xizhi poured himself a cup of wine, filling the one across the table as well, his heart a tangled mess of emotions. Li Xizhi had returned home several times, and each time, Li Xijun had spoken with him at length. He had always been calm, and after receiving the talisman qi, had grown even more emotionless.

“Brother Xicheng gained his position and felt uneasy, and Ximing was too soft and full of guilt. But was Jun’er any better? He first exposed Ximing, then questioned Xicheng, and even eliminated threats by sending Yuexiang away... his heart was the heaviest with dread.

“What a tangled mess... how could it ever be unraveled!”

Among all the entanglements of the Li Family, it was Li Xizhi, an outsider to their internal strife, who saw things the clearest and knew the most.

Now, pouring wine on the ground, he muttered, “Grandfather always said the four Xi’s were bound by affection... but how could mere affection explain it all? When kinship isn’t enough, resentment and guilt cannot be resolved. When hatred isn’t enough, envy and dread cannot be shown... all of it was to perfect a single divine art.”

He poured three cups onto the ground, bowed deeply, then packed away the pot and cups. Collecting all his emotions, he stepped out calmly.

As he emerged from the woods, Li Wushao approached. The old demonic creature had already reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. As his state of mind transformed, the youthful form he had first assumed gradually faded.

Wrinkles lined his stern face as he bowed and said, “Young Master!”

Li Xizhi took the letter from him, glanced over it, and turned to ask, “Wushao, how effective were the Flower of Mu Sea[1] and the Spiritual Uplift Pill?”

Though Li Wushao was in the late Foundation Establishment Realm, his combat strength was lacking. Even a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm disciple of exalted immortal sects could likely handle him, which was clearly insufficient.

So Li Xizhi had specially invited two alchemists to Splitreed Island to examine the matter. Both were senior experts who had seen many spirit beasts, and after a careful look, they were somewhat surprised.

“This beast may lack mystical prowess, but its bloodline is quite unusual. Its ancestors likely cultivated or consumed some Azure Manifestation type spirit herb. This is truly a potent tonic!

“If this beast is used as furnace material, it would certainly produce an excellent batch of Essence Gathering Pills!”

Li Wushao was stunned, and his eyes filled with both suspicion and menace. Only after Li Xizhi explained in detail did the two alchemists realize he merely wanted pills to boost strength.

They agreed readily, though still expressed some regret, “Sir, you truly don’t wish to refine an Essence Gathering Pill? This demonic creature is premium material. If we reinforce its foundation first, its essence will lose some of its flavor.”

The old snake’s face had gone foul. Li Xizhi could only send the alchemists off with a wry smile, though his thoughts had begun to stir, Wushao was born a black-scaled hooked serpent and his bloodline was far from impressive. Perhaps the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique is starting to show some benefit, having reinforced him so many times.

Using Supreme Yin Moonlight to match one’s life essence would be seen as extravagant even by the most illustrious families. No wonder the alchemists had called it a supreme tonic. So he specially found a good spirit item, refined a pill, and gave it to Li Wushao.

Li Wushao slowly transformed in front of him. Inky black scales surfaced across his body, and his eyes turned pitch-black as he spoke in a deep hum, “This subordinate cultivates the Water Mansion system’s Morning Cold Rain. Its effects have grown even more refined, so I can now manipulate Inferior Water and suppress spirit wind...”

He displayed his various mystical abilities, and Li Xizhi watched silently, hesitating to speak, before softly saying, “Excellent. I’ll fetch you more spell arts when I have the chance. It will surely make you even stronger.”

The corners of Li Wushao’s mouth twitched. He bowed in gratitude, and thought inwardly, Just what kind of people are the Li Family? Forget that sword immortal, take even Li Xuanfeng. One arrow from that brute and no matter what spell you have, you’ll be down and crying for your mother... And now the young master’s cultivation grows deeper by the day, to the point of being unfathomable... There’s still the heir, and Qinghong...

But Li Xizhi didn’t care what he was thinking. He glanced through the report in his hand, let out a faint chuckle, and shook his head. “Truly interesting... I thought Ning Hejing wouldn’t be able to hold back, yet he turned out to be unexpectedly well-behaved! Instead, it was Chi Fubo who struck fast and viciously, seizing the initiative and pulling him right out of position!”

Li Wushao couldn’t help but smile, and asked quietly, “Is their internal strife good for us?”

“Good?!” Li Xizhi shook his head and said with a touch of sarcasm, “How could that be good? These people aren’t fools. With such a major threat looming... would they really start tearing into each other so recklessly? Hmm? Everyone knows the saying. The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.”

He reviewed all the position changes and smiled. “Rather than a fight, it’s more of a compromise. Ning Hejing did lose the position of Peak Master of Yuanxing Peak, but all his trusted subordinates are still sitting pretty up there... how outrageous.”

Li Wushao read through the list twice. The dense rows of names made his head spin, and he cursed in his heart, Damn it... humans really are cunning! Just fight it out already, why all the scheming and trickery?

Still, though cursing inwardly, he humbly asked, “So are the Ning and Chi Families scheming against us?”

“Not exactly.” Li Xizhi shook his head and said with a smile, “They really did tear into each other, but everyone came out satisfied after the fight. It was all a trade of interests. Ning Hejing, that heavyweight sect master faction, stepped down from the peak, but he was given an even better post elsewhere.

“The Chi Family lacks manpower, so they naturally wouldn’t fall out with the Ning Family. Leaving those people on the peak gives them support, weakens the Ning faction, and helps appease Ning Hejing’s mood...”

Li Wushao pondered a while and asked, “Where’s he going?”

“Where?” Li Xizhi casually pointed at the bamboo grove behind him. “Of course, he’s being sent to the Eastern Sea. No matter which side loses, they’d take over my position here. Isn’t that perfect for everyone? Ning Hejing is fierce but lacks cunning. He’s definitely the one coming.

“First, it gets that eyesore out of the sect; second, it puts him in control of one of the two key seas. As long as Chi Xuxiao gives the order, how could Ning Hejing disobey? Once in the Eastern Sea, he’ll be busy cracking down and purging opposition, so he won’t have time to meddle with sect politics. All that infighting just weakens the Si Family and strengthens his own.”

Li Wushao remained quiet for a while, then murmured, “And Lord Si? Would he really stand by and do nothing...”

“The Eastern Sea has long been marked as one to be given up.” Li Xizhi sighed, a touch of regret in his voice as he said, “It’s just a shame about this bamboo grove. That guy loves planting iron pillars everywhere, so this whole mountain will soon look like a porcupine. I doubt it’ll survive...”

1. The raw 穆(Mu) 海(Hai) is the same words used for the character Muhai that appeared in previous chapters. But in this context it should be the name of a sea because 海(Hai) actually means sea. ☜

Knowing Li Xizhi had plans, Li Wushao spoke softly, “What should we do now...”

“Mm...” Li Xizhi said softly, “Let’s head into the island’s abyss under the pretense of inspection before the official order arrives... We’ll toss the whole situation to that guy and focus on treasure hunting before we leave.”

A gleam of rainbow light rose and fell from his hand as he mused inwardly, As long as the order doesn’t arrive, I can use this excuse to dodge everything. Both sides will accept it. As for those messy, incomplete records... naturally they’ll be left for Lord Ning. He’s got talent, surely he can sort them out even without assistants.

After a brief moment of thought, Li Xizhi swiftly wrote two letters and sent them home. Without delay, he tidied up his cave dwelling and left without looking back.

He stepped out, left a letter for his subordinates, and rode the wind with the old demon to the center of the island . There, a great abyss opened up, its exposed cliff walls glowing a crimson red. Several golden-robed cultivators stood before the chasm.

The group all bowed in greeting. Li Xizhi spoke gently, “So today is the day the Golden Feather Sect reinforces this place. I wish to enter for investigation; may I trouble you to open the formation?”

The Golden Feather Sect had always maintained a lukewarm relationship with the Azure Pond Sect. Yet these men treated him with surprising warmth, calling him 'Daoist' as they brought out a map.

They smiled as they told him, “The earth veins have shifted slightly in recent months. Perhaps one of the Three Monarchs of Lesser Yang grew temperamental or went visiting a fellow cultivator. Daoist, do be cautious.”

The abyss on Splitreed Island had formed when a Demon Monarch had been split into three. Various forces had mixed, which corrupted the earth veins with wicked energy. Yet Falling Water Rising Storm had little impact on it. The real changes came when any of the Three True Monarchs passed nearby.

“Very well,” said Li Xizhi. That was exactly what he wanted to hear. He nodded in thanks and, without wasting a moment, took Li Wushao with him into the depths.

As he vanished into the abyss, the three disciples of the Golden Feather Sect resealed the formation. One of the women whispered, “So that’s Li Xizhi of the Moongaze Li Family? Handsome indeed, and his strength doesn’t seem low either.”

“Of course!” Another cultivator’s face lit up with pride as he shook his head and said, “My peak’s Grand Martial Uncle Zhang Yun is a close friend of Li Tongya. Even the Immortal Archer Li Xuanfeng had to call him Uncle! How could a descendant of such people be ordinary?”

His admiration for Zhang Yun extended to Li Tongya, which gave him a favorable view of the entire Li Family. Though Li Tongya was famous, Zhang Yun remained obscure among the rogue cultivators, so he eagerly brought him up to highlight his Grand Martial Uncle’s status.

The three continued chatting and laughing until a streak of light descended swiftly onto the island, circled the peak once, then landed directly before them.

“Where is the Peak Master of Changtian Peak?”

Si Tongyi... The three of them recognized him, but held him in disdain. They replied with cool indifference, “The Daoist has already entered the formation.”

“So be it... so be it,” Si Tongyi let out a sigh of relief, then turned and left. A few hours later, another streak of light descended rapidly upon the peak, circled once, and also landed.

This newcomer bore the Azure Pond Sect's seal, his face filled with shock as he asked, “Where is the Peak Master of Changtian Peak?!”

The three recognized him as someone from the Chi Family. One continued reading, while the other kept cultivating. None of them paid him any mind.

————

The Bicolor Scaled Beast surged from the sea, the palace on its back glimmering with shimmering scales before it submerged again.

Once it docked, Huiyao opened the palace doors and respectfully said, “My lord, please.”

Li Zhouwei emerged from the palace. Kongheng had been waiting at the shore. The monk craned his neck until he saw Li Zhouwei disembark, then finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Huiyao carried a basket of pearls, each one as large as a fist and dazzling in luster. Watching their expressions, he quietly slipped them into Kongheng’s hands and whispered, “Please accept these, my lord... The Tail Subkingdom queen is timid by nature, and not the kind to orchestrate such things. One fright and she hasn’t slept a wink in days... I beg your grace, give her a way out...”

Kongheng, being kind-hearted, listened to Huiyao’s murmured explanation and had grasped most of the situation. He had already taken the basket but, afraid of making a misstep, glanced at Li Zhouwei.

When he saw Li Zhouwei nod, Huiyao was overjoyed and thanked them repeatedly. Kongheng gently supported him and said warmly, “Fellow Daoist Huiyao, you have a kind heart. You're truly a fine creature.”

Huiyao was a bit dazed to hear that, knowing he’d done plenty of shady deeds. His face twitched with guilt as he mumbled a soft response. Li Zhouwei turned to look toward the other side, where a young man in armor stood with a sword in hand.

Chen Yang had guarded the island for several years. Since Li Zhouwei and Li Chenghui were in closed-door cultivation, and Kongheng was not one to manage affairs, most responsibilities had fallen to him. Though only at the third stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, his demeanor had changed greatly.

The viciousness and suspicion that had once flickered in his gaze had completely vanished. With the countenance of a Li clansman, and stripped of those coarse expressions, Chen Yang now appeared much steadier.

But when facing Li Zhouwei, he still lowered his eyes, staring at his cheeks rather than those golden pupils, and respectfully said, “Greetings, my lord!”

“Rise.” Li Zhouwei’s gaze did not linger on him. Instead, he turned to exchange a few words with Huiyao. The demonic creature then rode the beast away.

Chen Yang counted the pearls and said softly, “My lord, sixteen Water Pearls in total. It barely reaches the threshold for a Foundation Establishment Realm spirit item.”

As Li Zhouwei stepped into the hall, he replied softly, “Keep them well. The quality is decent. If divided, they’re best used for top-grade Qi Cultivation Realm items. But once we return to the lake, it’s best to gather a full set of sixteen and forge a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact set.”

Chen Yang carefully stored them away, then took out a jade slip from his robe and offered it with both hands. He bowed respectfully as he said, “My lord, this contains records of all island affairs over the past few years. There's records of appointments and removals, as well as spirit ore and paddy yields. Every annual surplus was accounted for without the slightest discrepancy!”

Li Zhouwei accepted the slip and glanced through it. He had to admit, Chen Yang had kept the island in impeccable order these past years. Every spirit field and mine had been managed with precision, and the annual surplus even rivaled the total from the previous three years combined.

This man is ambitious and ruthless, but his capabilities are beyond doubt. It takes someone like him to keep an island full of outer sea cultivators in line.

It was precisely because Chen Yang had ambition that he refrained from touching any of the island’s resources. The cultivators feared him to the extreme. Even Li Chenghui, capable as he was, had to yield some benefits to win hearts. Yet under Chen Yang’s rule, the administration had become extraordinarily clean.

Kongheng waited patiently. Once Li Zhouwei finished reading, he silently handed over the letter he held in his hand.

Li Zhouwei took the letter, skimmed it quickly, then shut his eyes tightly. He waited several seconds before lifting his brows and exhaling, asking, “Did Great-Uncle Xijun[1] leave any words?”

Kongheng shook his head. Li Zhouwei waved for Chen Yang to leave, then sat silently in the hall for a few moments. When he saw Kongheng’s pale face, Li Zhouwei said hoarsely, “With Uncle fallen, I must return at once.”

# Chapter 951: Tanyun

Li Qinghong flew all the way past Lake Xian, entered the sea, and crossed the line once marked by a True Monarch. The sky above darkened with thick clouds, and the purple hue of the inland seas could no longer be seen clearly.

The golden mountain in Kong Tingyun’s hand shimmered as it glided across the sea. Streaks of light flew by in the sky. When the two stopped at Splitreed Island, disciples from Profound Peak Gate promptly came to receive them.

Splitreed Island sat at the heart of the Shallow Sea. It had once been a stronghold of the Moonlight Origin Mansion, but after the Immortal Mansion secluded itself, various immortal sects from Jiangnan moved in. Gates and sects like Hengzhu Dao Gate and the Azure Pond Sect secured prime positions early on, while Profound Peak Gate, being a weaker latecomer, could only settle on the fringes.

The Azure Pond Sect was now administered by Li Xizhi. Kong Tingyun had deliberately made this stop to allow the aunt and nephew to meet, but also to use the opportunity to grow closer with Li Xizhi. However, when she sent someone to inquire, the response made her expression subtly change.

"Ning Hejing is the one guarding this place now?"

Kong Tingyun felt a faint sense of unease. She wasn’t deeply familiar with the Azure Pond Sect’s internal affairs, so she turned to explain everything in detail to Li Qinghong. The latter, however, showed no surprise at all.

"Ever since word of Chi Buzi spread and Si Yuanli began his seclusion, this was only a matter of time."

Removing Si Yuanli’s faction was inevitable. Hearing that Li Xizhi had already entered the Abyss confirmed he had a plan. Meanwhile, the Profound Peak Gate disciple hesitated slightly and said quietly, "Unfortunately, the timing was poor. The peak master of Changtian Peak went into the Abyss, and many sect documents weren’t handed over. The seals are missing. Lord Ning has already sat atop the peak for several days and sent multiple letters back to the sect."

"Pfft." The always perceptive Kong Tingyun instantly grasped the implications. She chuckled while inwardly thinking, There’s no need to guess. The Azure Pond Sect’s reef markets across the Eastern Sea are either under the Yangs, the Sis, or Li Xizhi’s people. Ning Hejing... hmph...

As Li Qinghong listened, her thoughts drifted to Chi Buzi, the Chi Family’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. She had once seen the so-called Chi Family Treasure Tree. Though she couldn’t fully understand everything she’d heard, one thing was clear... Chi Buzi likely harbored deep resentment toward Pristine Water, and his ambitions were even greater...

"He probably has truly given up on the Azure Pond Sect!" Kong Tingyun glanced at Li Qinghong, then turned to ask, "Did Ning Hejing bring anyone with him?"

The guard respectfully replied, "Most of the Ning Family remains within the sect. He brought back a few guest cultivators, all transferred from Yi Mountain City. There’s even someone from Mount Yue..."
𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝘦𝘣𝘯ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝑚

"Someone from Mount Yue?" Li Qinghong raised her brows in mild surprise and asked, "Do you know his background? Do you know his name?"

The person quickly retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, hesitating awkwardly before whispering, "He’s originally from Moongaze Lake. He once cultivated there, but... supposedly... his territory was seized, and he was later captured by Lord Xuanfeng and brought all the way back to Yi Mountain City. He’s a clever one and ended up joining the Ning Family. I heard that his name is Fei Luoya..."

The man spoke vaguely in her presence, but Kong Tingyun understood at once. The Moongaze Lake was now under Li Family control. Who else could have taken the Mount Yue man’s territory?

She lowered her gaze and said, "So there was an old enmity... no wonder he threw his lot in with Ning Hejing. Qinghong..."

As her probing gaze swept over, Li Qinghong was momentarily stunned in her heart, Who? Fei Luoya?!

How could Li Qinghong not recognize that name? He was an old veteran from Mount Yue, and a rather capable one at that. She had seen him multiple times, and every time, this old Mount Yue cultivator had come pleading for a way to survive...

Later, when Li Xuanfeng returned, he took him south to serve under the Ning Family. Who would have thought that after all the twists and turns, he would end up here?

Enmity? thought Li Qinghong.

Li Qinghong fell silent. There likely wasn’t any deep grudge between Fei Luoya and the Li Family, nor had there ever been any great favor owed. This so-called enmity was probably just a ploy to curry power. But it was hard to tell what that old man was truly thinking. One thing was clear, the old man was cunning and certainly had means. Ning Hejing would probably make great use of him.

Naturally, she wouldn’t undermine Fei Luoya for no reason, and simply sighed, "It’s true."

Kong Tingyun looked thoughtful, while Li Qinghong, inspired by this bit of information, quickly pieced together the arrangements between the Si and Chi factions. Her heart settled further.

Just then, the disciple from Profound Peak Gate said, "There is one more matter to report to the sect master."

"Speak."

Kong Tingyun prompted, and the man responded, "News from a few days ago says the sixteenth young master of the Golden Tang Gate broke through, mastering several advanced arts. He asked the sect master to step down and took the position himself... Now, the Golden Tang Gate is entirely under his control."

Kong Tingyun shook her head lightly and said, "That’s just their old tradition... There’s some coup or assassination every year. Back in the day, during the Li Xia affair, the Azure Pond Sect was flourishing, and the Golden Tang Gate leaned toward the Azure Pond Sect’s faction. Now that the Azure Pond Sect is declining, it’s only natural they shift toward the Golden Feather Sect’s side."

After thinking for a moment, she added, "I remember it was the Golden Feather Sect who supported Situ Nu long ago in killing his brother to ascend. Later, the Azure Pond Sect backed the first lineage in restoring power. This sixteenth young master who just rose again must be a descendant of Situ Nu..."

"Wise as always, Sect Master!" The man responded respectfully, "He is a surviving orphan from those days, named Situ Mo. He was born of a maidservant..."

"Situ Mo?" Kong Tingyun was truly taken aback and turned to look at Li Qinghong, only to find her expression equally conflicted. Kong Tingyun sighed softly and shook her head, saying, "So it’s him... Even when I fought him back then, I did not think he was an ordinary man. But I never imagined he had such a background!"

Li Qinghong sighed inwardly. She truly did know Situ Mo. His mother was once a woman from the Ji Family, and had harbored deep hatred ever since. She had even ambushed one of her own juniors. The Li Family had once laid a trap with Profound Peak Gate, but had failed to keep him.

Li Qinghong merely murmured, "He’s extremely cautious, quick-witted... not someone easy to deal with."

"Exactly." Kong Tingyun found herself somewhat troubled as well. She had crossed swords with this man during her first time stationed offshore and understood him well. Though he was a formidable enemy, she had to admit his abilities. She said, "I tried to trap him several times, and he evaded me each time... His level of caution and cunning is among the highest I’ve seen."

Li Qinghong even held back a deeper thought, My second uncle brought his bow to the Eastern Sea twice, but that guy hid like a turtle and refused to leave his island. Once he sent Mutuo, another time Situ Chen. Both times someone else took the fatal blow for him. He’s somehow held out until now.

After reviewing the intel, Kong Tingyun took her off the island again. This time they had a swift and steady spirit boat from Profound Peak Gate. The two sat calmly in the cabin as Kong Tingyun spoke softly, "Sister, there’s no need to worry. The Situ Family has only survived till now because their Purple Mansion Realm cultivator lingers in the Southern Sea. They pop up now and then, but never dare return to Jiangnan... Situ Mo wouldn’t dare make a move."

Li Qinghong nodded. She had some knowledge of how the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Golden Tang Gate had long been abroad, but she ultimately knew less than Profound Peak Gate, who had married into the sect.

She whispered, "I wonder which families have a grudge against Golden Tang Gate."

"It all goes back to Situ Tang." Kong Tingyun replied softly, "The Golden Tang Gate was founded by Situ Tang... He had extraordinary talent, and some even suspected he was blessed by fate itself... but his temperament was exceedingly domineering.

"At that time, Daoist Master Yuan Su was stationed at sea and went out to gather qi. Situ Tang barged into Yuan Su’s cave dwelling, killed the Three-Eyed Mount Tiao Beast, took its eye, and left unscathed. Even Daoist Master Qiushui was injured by him..."

"He also feuded with Yuming of the Shen Family and snatched a treasure from Daoist Yuan Xiu... Eventually, he turned south and clashed with Hengzhu Dao Gate... In short, he never thought of the consequences. By making enemies everywhere, he left the Golden Tang Gate in a constant state of awkwardness..."

Li Qinghong felt her heart gradually settle. Kong Tingyun smiled, shook her head and said, "It wasn’t until he angered a Dragon King in the sea and nearly died that he finally calmed down. Unfortunately, his lifespan was greatly reduced, and he never had the chance to reach the Golden Core Realm before his death."

The spirit boat sped south through the sky as the two conversed. The sea roared beneath them. After sitting for most of the day, they passed an island spewing black fire. The spirit boat suddenly shook with a loud rumble. Kong Tingyun looked up with a slight frown, lifted the curtain, and stepped out.

Li Qinghong looked up as well and saw roaring flames beneath them. The marketplace on the sea was in ruins, with several families seemingly locked in vicious battle. Sulfurous fire erupted as thick smoke billowed into the sky.

A few stray spell arts had struck the spirit boat, prompting Kong Tingyun to reveal herself. Her late Foundation Establishment Realm aura, combined with the radiance of her full Dharma robes, instantly frightened the surrounding cultivators into panic. Many dropped to their knees.

"Spare us, my lady! Spare us!"

"Where do you think you are? Do you all have no regard for your lives?" At her words, the cultivators who had unleashed the spells turned pale with terror and stammered in response. Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators flew in from the distance.

One of them recognized her at a glance and quickly bowed, speaking humbly, "Greet... Greetings, fairy of the Immortal Sect... Allow me to offer our apologies for this incident!"

He seized the troublemakers with one hand, intending to kill them on the spot, but Kong Tingyun waved him down. She paused to question them thoroughly but could not find any deeper cause.

Kong Tingyun frowned and observed them for a while. Once she was certain they had only caused unintentional harm, she let out a soft sigh. Meanwhile, Li Qinghong found the island oddly familiar. She lowered her gaze and quietly returned to the cabin.

After a few moments, Kong Tingyun reentered and sat across from her. She spoke softly, "This is Dongliu Island. It used to belong to a rather decent family... but their old ancestor failed his breakthrough and perished. A few of the elder generations also died, and they suddenly couldn’t hold such vast territory anymore.

"It’s a pity... Our Daoist Master once said that their ancestor had a fairly good chance of success, but he happened to run into Falling Water Rising Storm... and got washed to death by it..."

She poured tea for Li Qinghong and said gently, "Earlier, a few nearby families were besieging this place... The Han Family has a solid foundation, so it’s not so easy to topple them. They’ve apparently been fighting for over a year now."

Li Qinghong listened quietly, her eyes fixed on her teacup. After taking a sip, she asked, "How much farther is it from here to Zongquan?"

Kong Tingyun calculated for a moment and replied softly, "There should be another three or four days’ time."

"Alright," replied Li Qinghong, nodding. She quietly sipped her tea, already making mental calculations in her heart.

Crimson Reef Island.

Crimson Reef Island was the second-largest island in the Shallow Sea after Splitreed Island, but it was quite different. While Splitreed Island was a complete and unified landmass, Crimson Reef Island looked more like five or six large islands patched together.

The island was divided into East Reef and West Reef, a geographic and administrative split. The entire reef archipelago was split in two by a sea trench over five hundred kilometers wide. It was windless above and so vast that ordinary Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators couldn't even fly across it.

A woman in white stood on the sea dotted with jagged rocks. A frosty haze veiled her face, making her features indistinct. Her arms were folded across her chest.

Tianwan had been waiting here for several days. It wasn’t wasted time. Chi Buzi’s probing had forced Daoist Master Tanyun to show himself. Rather than feeling pleased, Tianwan had grown even more alert.

Tu Longjian...

Ever since the loss of the Six Ding Merging Fire Token, Tianwan had grown suspicious that Tanyun[1] from West Reef had kept a close eye on Tu Longjian ever since he secretly broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Chi Buzi’s recent stir-up confirmed for her that Tanyun had long since entered the Purple Mansion Realm. The realization chilled her and filled her with doubt.

The loss of the Six Ding Merging Fire Token was no accident; it must’ve been Tanyun’s doing! And so, new questions began to surge in her mind, Was Tu Longjian truly just a hypocrite dressed in righteousness?

The Daoist Master went over the possibilities in her mind and slowly shook her head.

"West Reef’s shadow has always loomed behind Tu Longjian... he must’ve wanted to protect Li Xijun, but the Six Ding Merging Fire Token was important enough for him to break his bottom line... and abandon pride if needed."

Linking it to how the token was lost, she nodded slightly and murmured, "The Merging Fire Token is no ordinary ancient artifact... it holds something within. Maybe a hidden trove, a cultivation technique, a lead to some ancient grotto heaven... or even Metallic Essence!"

"Husband..." Tianwan folded her arms over her chest, as if speaking across space to her long-vanished husband Guo Shentong. Her voice softened, "The dragon kin gave you the Six Ding Merging Fire Token... What kind of pact did you form with them? And what secrets did you hide within this spirit artifact... Tu Longjian... quite the name indeed!"

She stood quietly for a moment as a gust of fragrant wind swept in from the distance. It landed nearby and transformed into a man in sandalwood robes. He had arched brows and small eyes, but he was hunched over as he closely examined her.

Tianwan lowered her gaze and murmured, "Tanyun..."

"This old servant greets Madam!" Daoist Master Tanyun chuckled slyly, his eyes lacking the slightest respect.

Daoist Master Tianwan spoke softly, "Your spirituality is bound to him, so why not be honest with me... How is my husband now?"

"Eh..." Daoist Master Tanyun shook his head, replying mockingly, "Haven’t had contact in ages! Pardon me, Madam... There are far too many grotto heavens and secret realms in this world... What good is a mere strand of spirituality?"

Daoist Master Tianwan stared at him with quiet weight. Daoist Master Tanyun just laughed and said, "Why not ask the Golden Feather Sect instead? Those immortal sects are far-sighted and formidable... I’m sure they know something."

Tianwan remained silent for a while before speaking, "There’s no need to hide it. You handed the Six Ding Merging Fire Token to Tu Longjian... and Xu Xiao will surely die too...

"Why not keep this artifact in hand? Why give it to a bearer of fate like him? Could my husband be trapped in a grotto heaven... and needs this token carried inside to be rescued?"

As she spoke in a low voice, she carefully watched his expression and continued, "Or could it be..."

Her words were suddenly cut off by the demonic creature, whose tone had turned cold, "You used their lives to test me and my master. Guo Hongyao, Guo Hongkang, Guo Hong’er... How many direct descendants have already died? Tianwan! They were your children all the same!"

# Chapter 953: Junior

"Descendants." Daoist Master Tianwan muttered the word with a trace of mockery and said quietly, "So what if they are? What are descendants? Are they descendants because I watched them grow up and thus feel affection? Or because they revere me? None of that. I emerged from seclusion after breaking through, only to be greeted by a group of old men calling me ancestor... What does that have to do with me?"

Tanyun let out a sigh. He still held some lingering bond of master and servant in his heart, and tried to persuade her, "But blood ties can never truly be erased. Even if you feel no affection for them, they are at least closer than strangers..."

"Closer?" Daoist Master Tianwan spoke through gritted teeth, her voice full of fury and icy disdain, "I possess divine abilities! I can see directly into human hearts. I see their every thought with crystal clarity, Tanyun! The women think only of hating and envying me... What closeness is there to speak of! As for Guo Hong'er... and Guo Hongjian..."

Her expression grew even colder as a trace of cruelty rose. She spoke softly, "Fine... at least they weren't as stupid as Guo Hongyao. They knew I could read hearts, so they dared not think such things when facing me. But once I entered seclusion, they secretly indulged in lustful thoughts, fantasies of domination, and sordid repayment... What closeness could there possibly be!"

Tanyun was left speechless. He murmured, "This... this... But still!"

Daoist Master Tanyun truly didn’t know how to defend them anymore. Even Guo Shentong would have to bow his head in shame if he were here. He could only mutter, "After all, several hundred years have passed. It’s hard to expect any real familial bond... You are pure and untarnished, a stunning beauty among mortals cultivating a Dao of untouchable frost and snow... so they harbored filthy thoughts..."

His voice grew quieter as he spoke, and inwardly he wished he could drag those Guo bastards out and kill them all. Yet he still tried to reason with her, "My lady... the ancients once said, 'To glimpse a man's heart is to witness his demons.' Back then, cultivators who attained divine abilities feared visiting the mortal world, for a single glance with their divine ability would fill them with despair and rage... One's inner thoughts are the hardest to condemn... Who doesn’t harbor desires of lust and greed deep within?"

Daoist Master Tianwan merely gazed at him in silence. Her entire being exuded an aura of frost and snow, with only a faint trace of her elegant eyes visible. She spoke softly, "The old texts say that once the Life Divine Ability is mastered, one sees evil in all the world. That is why those of the Purple Mansion Realm are without emotion and slay without hesitation. It's because they see sin in every soul. I understand now."

Zongquan Island.

Li Qinghong and Kong Tingyun arrived at Zongquan Island by spirit boat. Li Zhouwei approached them aboard the Radiant Light and cupped his hands in greeting, "Greetings, ancestor!"

Seeing him brought a rare smile to Li Qinghong’s face as a gentle warmth bloomed in her expression. Li Zhouwei then turned to Kong Tingyun and offered her a cupped-hands salute, "Greetings, Senior!"

Kong Tingyun smiled and nodded, her round eyes examining him briefly before giving a slight nod of approval, thinking, Not bad...

Li Qinghong had never allowed Li Zhouwei to kneel in her own household, and had previously kept him from meeting outsiders for a reason. If he had failed to reach Foundation Establishment Realm, encountering Kong Tingyun, the Sect Master of Profound Peak, would not have warranted a simple salute. According to cultivation etiquette, he would have had to kneel.

Kong Tingyun was also sharp. Had he not bowed, she might have grown suspicious. But now that he had advanced to the Foundation Establishment Realm, both were cultivators of equal realm, so bowing was no longer required, thus avoiding unnecessary trouble.
𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎

Li Qinghong stepped aside with a smile and said, "Kong Tingyun, Sect Master of Profound Peak Gate, this is my family’s heir."

"I’ve long heard of your name!" Kong Tingyun looked at him for a moment before slowly averting her gaze. Though Li Zhouwei’s looks were merely above average, he possessed a charm that made it hard to look away. She chuckled inwardly, I’ve heard that the Wei's Li lineage is known for its beauty. No wonder, seeing Qinghong and Xijun is proof enough...

But Li Qinghong was wary of lingering too long, fearing unexpected mishaps, and thus said, "Let’s board the boat first."

The two women boarded back on the boat. With Kong Tingyun present, Li Zhouwei decided not to bring up the matter of Dingjiao. Once inside, Li Qinghong, visibly worried, asked, "How is Cheng’e doing?"

"He’s still in seclusion, no news so far..." Kongheng, standing nearby, answered in his stead.

After some small talk, Li Zhouwei got a better sense of Kong Tingyun’s temperament and finally asked, "Senior Kong... I’ve always had a question. Items like the Six Ding Merging Fire Token or the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token seem to be part of a set. Where exactly did they come from?"

Kong Tingyun hesitated for a moment before replying, "These spirit artifacts are fairly well known. They’re likely connected to some Immortal Mansion, but I don’t know much beyond that..."

Her answer was vague, and was clearly lacking certainty. Sea winds howled outside the boat as the group continued heading north. After several days, they arrived at Yuezhou Island, home of the Profound Peak Gate.

This was the Kong Family’s ancestral stronghold. Kong Tingyun smiled and pointed north, saying, "I forgot to inform your family that the Golden Tang Gate has sealed its mountain and lost Golden Sack Island. It now belongs to our family."

"Congratulations!" Li Qinghong offered her congratulations. A disciple from the Profound Peak Gate came up with a message, which Kong Tingyun read carefully before speaking softly, "Daoist Master Zipei has truly fallen!"

Li Qinghong wasn’t well acquainted with the Daoist Master, but the deceased had a respectable reputation, so she sighed in response.

But Kong Tingyun chuckled, "She might not actually be dead."

Li Zhouwei raised his eyebrows and asked doubtfully, "Reincarnated?"

"Exactly." Kong Tingyun said in a low voice, "Do you all remember how the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators vanished for a time during the North-South conflict? It was because signs of Anhuai Heaven appeared within the great void, and among them were fragments of the Tianwu True Qi Divine Fiend Essence!"

Li Zhouwei’s heart trembled as something struck him like lightning, True Essence! The old ape also possessed True Essence... and his breakthrough happened around that same time!

The white ape’s breakthrough was one of the most unexpected events for the Li Family. His body was riddled with old injuries, many of which had damaged his foundation. Both Li Xicheng and Xiao Guiluan had far better chances of success, yet he alone had succeeded.

Thinking back now... it was truly a stroke of fortune! At that very time, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were fighting within the great void, and the appearance of the Tianwu True Qi Divine Fiend Essence allowed him to seize that celestial opportunity.

Li Zhouwei had long harbored doubts about the matter. Though he trusted the white ape, he had always suspected someone might have tampered with him in the past. Now, he felt much more at ease.

Across from him, Kong Tingyun continued, "The Metallic Essence was taken by Daoist Master Zipei. According to our family’s Daoist Master, possessing Metallic Essence allows one to reincarnate freely. She’s likely already slipped away."

Mount Wu.

Moongaze Lake’s Mount Wu was where spiritual energy was the most concentrated. However, at present, a grand formation had sealed it off completely, isolating all fluctuations of qi. White mist flowed down the jade steps of the mountain in thick, milky streams like liquid jade.

The blood pool at the summit had been transformed. Now, it held a small pile of spirit stones, and was soaked in gurgling spirit springs. Wisps of spiritual qi escaped the surface, flowing across the ancient jade floor.

Jade pillars stood in rows. Li Ximing, dressed in his Daoist robe, stood atop the tallest one. With each breath, dense spiritual qi gathered from all directions and flowed into his acupoints. He slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a stream of heavenly radiance. It glimmered brightly amidst the mist before vanishing.

A serene lantern lit up within his qi sea, floating above his Immortal Foundation. Its radiance flickered, illuminating everything within the qi sea.

"Heavenly Lantern—successfully refined!"

The Radiant Essence Scripture contained nine secret techniques: Yang Origin, Heavenly Lantern, Jewel Steps, Great Fissure, Reversal, Hundred Arms Arsenal, Imperial Edict, Golden Scales, and Red Cicada, each with its own unique ability. Through secluded cultivation and aided by the Huai River Map, Li Ximing had now refined the second one.

There was no denying Li Ximing’s astonishing talent. Just over sixty years old, and he had already mastered two secret techniques. Now that the Heavenly Lantern was refined, his Immortal Foundation underwent further transformation.

The method of Heavenly Lantern pierces through darkness and purifies the spirit platform, doubling efficiency in scripture reading and spell art cultivation...

Li Ximing was struck with sudden insight, It would be best to start with Heavenly Lantern. Even the simplest Yang Origin technique doesn’t take much time. Focusing on these two first was the right choice... But these secret techniques...

Li Ximing stared at the radiant lantern shimmering within his qi sea and thought to himself, These are truly exquisitely designed. Even among the three sects and seven gates, secret techniques of this caliber are exceedingly rare.

The more he practiced, the more he realized how precious these secret techniques were. Even the most basic Yang Origin contained mysteries that no other spell he had learned could rival.

Except for the immortal arts Reception Method and Sacrificial Ritual Method.

No one in the Li Family had ever understood these two arts. They showed no obvious profundity, produced no spiritual energy, and felt more like calling for rain. Somehow, repeating them simply... worked.

None of the Li Family’s other spell arts aside from those two even came close. Each time Li Ximing practiced one of the secret techniques, it felt like sailing through a vast, boundless ocean. It was so immersive he often forgot to return.

He exhaled deeply. After another half-month of stabilizing the Heavenly Lantern within the formation, he began cultivating the next spell. Suddenly, the formation flickered, and a small message appeared on the jade pillar.

Li Ximing picked it up and glanced over it, Reporting to the lord: The Xiao Family has come to visit. If you have emerged from seclusion, we humbly request your presence.

Li Ximing pondered for a moment. Since the message had been sent to him, it likely meant his aunt was not at home. The Xiao Family could not be neglected, so he ascended in a beam of light and soared out of Mount Wu.

He descended into the island’s main hall and saw that many people were already gathered there. His grand-uncle Li Xuanxuan stood smiling to one side, while the white ape stood on the other like a stone statue.

A middle-aged man with a kindly face and graying temples stood in the center of the hall. Two strands of medicine pouches hung from his shoulders. A gentle smile rested on his face as he looked at Li Ximing with calm, relaxed eyes.

"Master!" Li Ximing knew this face better than anyone. It was none other than his master, Xiao Yuansi!

He had always looked gentle and kind, but age now weighed heavily on him. His eyes carried weariness; his complexion was pale; and it seemed he had recently suffered some minor injuries.

Li Ximing hadn’t expected him to come in person and hurriedly performed a disciple’s salute, standing respectfully to one side.

The man took his hand, his eyes warm. His voice still carried the same rich gentleness it had all those years ago, "You’ve grown so much, Ming’er."

After Li Xijun’s death, Li Ximing had wept only once, and since then had had no room in his heart for mourning. But those words made his eyes sting. He said in a low voice, "Disciple Ximing greets Master!"

"Good..." Xiao Yuansi, though aged, still bore a middle-aged appearance from years of taking medicinal pills. He smiled at Li Ximing, then turned toward Li Xuanxuan and said, "Xuanxuan, we’ve talked enough for now. Why don’t you rest for a bit? I’d like to speak with Ming’er alone."

Li Xuanxuan was the highest in seniority within the Li Family, so only the man before him could address him so casually. Stroking his white beard, he quickly took his leave.

Xiao Yuansi turned to the young man before him, coughed twice, and said with a smile, "Ming’er, come. Let’s go talk at your Mount Wu."

Li Ximing quickly moved to support him, but Xiao Yuansi only chuckled and shook his head. Li Ximing felt nothing but gratitude for this elder. They descended together toward Mount Wu, landing atop its peak.

Xiao Yuansi looked around and said with a smile, "You... you’ve always had the finest things. This Mount Wu is even better than my cave dwelling atop Mount Xianyou."

Li Ximing nodded silently. The two of them sat down at a jade table, and Xiao Yuansi spoke softly, "Your family has not been using the blood pool. Good. My efforts at Tongya weren’t for nothing."

Li Ximing just kept nodding. Xiao Yuansi looked at him and continued, "In this lifetime, I’ve only ever taken you as a disciple. Everything I know of the alchemic Dao, I’ve passed on to you... Ming’er... I know you. Perhaps even better than Xuanxuan does. That’s why I came."

He said gently, "Ximing, if you plan to attempt the Purple Mansion Realm, why didn’t you tell your master first..."

Li Ximing raised his head and saw the familiar smile on Xiao Yuansi’s face. He said, "Xuanxuan might have refused to give you the Radiant Sky Stone. Don’t blame him for that."

"Master... I wouldn’t dare!" Li Ximing stood up in alarm, but Xiao Yuansi pulled him back into his seat, then took out a jade bottle from his sleeve and placed it in his hand with a smile, "Take a look."

The bottle felt warm in his hand. Sweeping it with his spiritual sense, Li Ximing discovered a single brilliant pill inside, etched with five claw-like golden patterns. It was brimming with radiant light, and the entire jade bottle shimmered with concentrated golden brilliance.

Li Ximing cultivated the Bright Yang Dao and was well-versed in alchemy. How could he not recognize it? This pill brimmed with intense Bright Yang mana, with a pure and tranquil aura. Who knew how many Bright Yang spirit items and treasured panaceas had gone into refining it!

"Mas... Master...!" Li Ximing stood frozen in place. Xiao Yuansi chuckled twice, then coughed and said softly, "You... I’ve always known your ambition was great. I had started paying attention to Bright Yang spirit items when you reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. I thought I’d collect them gradually, but you advanced faster than I expected. I could barely keep up.

"Fortunately, I’ve built some connections over the years and have some knowledge of Bright Yang spirit items. I secured two treasured panaceas, the Bright Sea Lotus and the Triple Yang Radiant Qi Fruit. I rushed to the Eastern Sea and, with much effort, finally gathered what I needed."

Xiao Yuansi continued gently, "Spirit items for the Purple Mansion Realm are far too rare, and I don’t have the means for that. But I do have some skill in alchemy. Though I lack a formula to aid in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, this is pure Bright Yang Origin. It’s called the Radiant Violet Pill, and it should benefit you greatly."

He looked at Li Ximing and said warmly, "It’s a valuable item... I was afraid others might overhear, so I called you into the formation to talk. I kept this from my family’s Daoist Master and did it myself... He’s off in the Northern Sea, so he won’t interfere... you can use it without worry."

Li Ximing couldn’t meet Xiao Yuansi’s gaze. He could only reply, "With all Master has done... this disciple has no way to repay you..."

"Repay?" Xiao Yuansi shook his head, a nostalgic look crossing his face. He laughed heartily for a few moments, then patted Li Ximing on the shoulder. The old man said no more, as if those few pats had conveyed all he wanted to express.




# Chapter 955: Treasured Armor

Li Ximing’s words stuck in his throat for a long time, while Xiao Yuansi simply continued to look at him. The old man rested his hand on his shoulder and was lost in thought.

Xiao Yuansi understood clearly that once he left this place, and once Li Ximing entered seclusion, the next time he came to the Li Family would almost certainly be for Li Ximing’s funeral. Attaining divine abilities wasn’t difficult for those in major sects, but for Li Ximing right now... it was not an ideal choice.

To attain divine abilities is to transcend the mundane.

When Li Ximing finally spoke through choked breaths, he sighed softly in his heart. He had exhausted every possible effort to see Li Ximing again.

Xiao Yuansi had noticed that his family’s ancestor hadn’t stopped him from gathering Bright Yang spirit items, but he didn’t believe it meant genuine support from his family's Daoist Master. He didn’t trust him at all. He feared that Li Ximing would have already been forced into seclusion by the time the pill was finished. Xiao Chuting was exactly the kind of man who would do such a thing.

So, he had deliberately disrupted the timeline, even going so far as to injure himself just to finish the refinement early and personally deliver the pill. Xiao Yuansi had treated this meeting as his final farewell. As for Li Ximing successfully reaching the Purple Mansion Realm... he never truly dared hope for it.

Ming’er’s temperament is far too much like that of a mortal! Xiao Yuansi gazed at him deeply and thought, Those throughout history who have attained divine abilities were either pure-hearted and resolute, cunning and ruthless, or so introspective that even grief could not sway them... But Ming’er? When frightened, he panics. When angered, he lashes out. He speaks of the merciless Dao, yet is swayed by family and friends. In detachment, he can sever ties, but upon reflection, he feels pain and regret. When nothing stirs his heart, he hesitates. It is only when the pain becomes real does he realize what ruthlessness means... Of all the sons of the Li Family, he is the most like an ordinary man.

To forge a divine ability, one must pierce the qi sea and ascend through Yang. Endless illusions and countless inner demons will await along the way. What will he rely on to get through them?

Xiao Yuansi looked at him in silence. Li Ximing stood beside the table, exhaled softly, and finally spoke without words of thanks, “Master, you deliberately kept this pill from Daoist Master Xiao. What concern lies behind that?”

Xiao Yuansi hadn’t expected that question. He slowly raised his brows and answered softly, “My family’s Daoist Master... is only doing what he believes is best for your family.”

“I understand,” said Ximing.

Li Ximing stood quietly at his side and said softly, “Daoist Master Xiao wishes for me to leave this pill for the heir. I can guess that and I can see it clearly. Master, rest assured, my family holds the Daoist Master in the highest regard. We have not misunderstood his intentions.”

Xiao Yuansi was not an ambitious man. With the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator Xiao Chuting above him, he was content to spend his remaining years quietly refining pills. He had no reason to stop this disciple of his, and could only offer him this single pill as a parting gift.

When he heard Li Ximing’s words, he finally showed a trace of surprise. After a long silence, he said softly, “You may handle what I've given you as you see fit.”

He coughed twice and finally rose to his feet. Li Ximing respectfully escorted him all the way out. Along the way, Xiao Yuansi looked back at him three or four times, and to his own surprise, a faint glimmer of hope rose in his heart, If he can gather himself and cut his losses... that would be the best outcome.

Li Ximing saw him off and then rode the wind back to Mount Wu. He did not inform Li Xuanxuan about the pill. Instead, he quietly sat down amid the mountain’s drifting white mists.

He took out the jade bottle, but didn’t open it immediately. His spiritual sense pierced through the bottle and landed on the Radiant Violet Pill within. The pill radiated a powerful Bright Yang qi. Its qi was pure and radiant. Li Ximing could detect no flaws within it.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝚠𝕖𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝕖𝚕.𝚌𝗼𝗺

“Though my means of inspection are a joke compared to Xiao Chuting’s... and all Dao lineages stem from the Xiao Family anyway, leaving little I can uncover... Master still made a point to mention Xiao Chuting...”

Li Ximing would never doubt Xiao Yuansi, and Xiao Chuting had no reason to harm him either. Yet Xiao Yuansi's earlier words clearly showed concern about Xiao Chuting. It wasn’t hard for Li Ximing to arrive at this conclusion, It’s just that Xiao Chuting would prefer Zhouwei to be the one attempting to reach the Purple Mansion Realm.

He sat in silence amid the mist, thoughts drifting through his mind, Xiao Chuting’s intentions are good... I suppose the Profound Peak Gate and Kong Tingyun have passed on word as well. All eyes are now fixed on Zhouwei.

It’s not just Xiao Chuting... Every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator friendly to my family hopes that Zhouwei will be the one to challenge the Purple Mansion Realm—not someone like me, whom they see as hopeless.

The rest of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... they’re probably just waiting, eager to watch me fail.

He gave a soft, self-deprecating laugh, then drew out a pale golden jade slip from his sleeve. Forming a hand seal, he activated his mana to begin cultivating the next secret technique.

Jewel Steps!

————

Kong Tingyun escorted them all the way to the lake, smiling as she saw the group off. Li Qinghong offered a few polite words of thanks, but since Kong Tingyun was in a hurry to return to her gate, she courteously declined the Li Family’s invitation and took her leave with a polite farewell.

After hesitating several times, she tugged on Li Qinghong’s sleeve before leaving and gave a reminder, “Qinghong, you must pay close attention to what I mentioned earlier... Don’t be careless!”

She was, of course, referring to Li Ximing. Li Qinghong could only nod in agreement. Only then did Kong Tingyun smile in relief and depart aboard her spirit boat.

Back on the island, Li Chengliao came to greet them, grinning from ear to ear as he grabbed his eldest son’s hand and examined him closely. Li Zhouwei hadn’t seen his father in a long time. Though he was never one for sweet words, a rare trace of joy surfaced in his eyes.

Chen Yang had changed into white robes and went to the lakeside to pay respects to his father. Li Zhouwei paid his respects to Li Xijun on the island. Kongheng stood in silence by the grave, sighing. Once they returned to the main hall, the space suddenly felt empty.

When the white ape saw Li Zhouwei, his expression faintly echoed the kindly one he once had in years past. His demeanor remained respectful, and he immediately bowed. The group entered the hall together, and Li Chengliao began recounting recent events.

“Senior Yuansi is truly a kind and gracious elder... He came all this way to offer his regards. Daoist Master Xiao has been in the Northern Sea for years now and hasn’t appeared. Even his family hasn’t been able to contact him... yet Xiao Yuansi still made a point to speak with Ximing.”

Li Xuanxuan was deeply grateful. He remembered clearly how many times Xiao Yuansi had lent a hand to support their family. He chimed in with a few more words, fearing the younger generation might bear resentment toward the Xiao Family for not acting publicly on their behalf.

Li Qinghong and the others, of course, wouldn’t do such a thing. They all responded kindly and respectfully. Li Xuanxuan then waved his hand, and both the white ape and Li Chengliao took their leave. The great hall doors closed, and the protective formation began to hum softly.

Still uneasy, Li Qinghong tossed out the Chongming Profound Insight Screen from her sleeve. A screen of light enveloped the hall, adding another layer of protection.

Only then did Li Zhouwei speak, “How have the talisman seeds fared in the two years I’ve been away?”

Li Xuanxuan gently shook his head. “Not as well as we’d hoped... We tested the Celestial Whirl generation three times and only you showed this kind of celestial affinity. As for the Crimson Palace generation...”

The old man stroked his beard and continued softly, “It’s just now beginning to take shape. Jiangqian is barely five, yet already the eldest among the first batch of the Crimson Palace generation. We’ll let him give it a try.”

Li Zhouwei nodded. Talisman seeds had become increasingly rare in recent years, and the cultivation methods attached to them were even more advanced. Most generations now had only a single bearer. He had met several of his brothers; while their innate abilities were slightly better than those of the Radiant Lure generation, the difference wasn’t substantial.

In the past, when the Immortal Mirror still manifested in the world, one could probe it with spiritual sense and clearly determine the number of talisman seeds inside. But the mirror hadn’t appeared in decades. No one had seen it, and now one had to rely on incantations just to invoke it, let alone inspect talisman seeds directly...

Li Xuanxuan seemed a little troubled by this and said quietly, “Using such treasures as vessels is all well and good... but there are already so few who bear the talismans. If something ever happens and the line is suddenly severed, with none of the younger generation having received a seed, wouldn’t that mean we’ve lost the connection entirely...”

After mulling it over for a moment, he chose not to say more.

Li Zhouwei then asked, “How is Jiangqian?”

The moment this was brought up, Li Xuanxuan became visibly spirited and chuckled softly, “The child is bright and quick to learn. He’s already earned great favor from your father!”

“Oh?” Li Zhouwei still remembered the exchange with Dingjiao in the Dragon Palace and pondered silently, If what Dingjiao implied is true... then both the eldest and second sons of Bright Yang are out of the ordinary. I’ve already seen what Jiang’ao is like, so Jiangqian must be remarkable as well.

Dingjiao might not have been sincere with him, and his instructions might not reflect his true intentions, but the clues hidden in their conversation were still worth taking into account.

So he asked, “Besides that, has there been anything unusual?”

Li Xuanxuan paused briefly, then furrowed his brow, “He’s just a five-year-old child; it's hard to say much. His eyes are starting to show a hint of red within the gold... but that’s nothing serious.”

“Alright...” Li Zhouwei nodded slightly, seeming to understand. He passed over the basket of pearls.

Li Qinghong took out several jade slips, unfurling them one by one and saying softly, “Minghuang, these are the Bright Yang techniques and spell arts collected by the family. Take a look.”

Li Zhouwei relaxed his brow and picked up the jade slips from the table, reading through them one by one, Second-grade technique: Clarity of Sight and Heart Technique, Immortal Foundation: Bright and Clear Heart.

Third-grade escape spell: Flowing Sun Refraction.

Third-grade technique: Bright Origin Observation and Separation Technique, Immortal Foundation: Everbright Platform.

Fourth-grade spell art: Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.

Li Zhouwei gave a word of thanks, then put away Flowing Sun Refraction and Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. He skimmed through Bright Origin Observation and Separation Technique and handed it back to Li Qinghong, saying softly, “I’ve troubled the seniors.”

“Don’t mention it.” Li Qinghong gave a gentle nod and exchanged a glance with Li Xuanxuan before saying softly, “Minghuang, there is one more matter.”

She rose from her seat and walked across the hall, forming a hand seal to resonate with the formation. She then retrieved a brocade pouch from within. Standing before them, she gently shook it, and drew a large jade box from it.

The jade box was as large as a tabletop and didn’t seem particularly extraordinary in material. Guided by mana, it floated lightly to the ground. Li Zhouwei made a rough guess in his heart, and sure enough, Li Qinghong said, “Years ago, my second uncle shot down Murong Wu and took a profound iron treasure armor from him . It's a top-tier Foundation Establishment Realm armor. It was then brought back and reforged over nearly three months using True Flame atop Mount Bianyan.

“Once it was completed, Ning Heyuan delivered it to my second uncle, who had it quietly returned and stored away here. It has remained unopened ever since.”

Mana flowed along her slender fingers as she tapped the jade box nine times. The box opened on its own with a metallic clang, revealing the treasure within.

Li Zhouwei focused and saw a gleaming field of gold-white fine scales. There were no intricate patterns, just layer upon layer of overlapping plates with a supple texture—it was a suit of soft armor!

He lifted it gently, surprise written across his face. Li Qinghong praised it, “I’d heard Murong Wu used the Desert Profound Armor, which was thought to be a heavy armor steeped in demonic aura. I expected it to be a clunky plate armor. Who’d have thought, after eighty-one days of True Flame refinement, it would become this.”

Li Xuanxuan looked at the soft armor with nostalgic eyes and said in his hoarse voice, “The Murong Family hails from the northern tribes. Their armor is naturally forged to be fierce and bulky, with three pounds of iron made to look like nine. The Azure Pond Sect, for all its differences, is still a Dao lineage of the Immortal Dao, so of course they refine things toward elegance and grace...”

The old man had managed stores for many years and was no stranger to such things. After studying it for a moment, he said calmly, “Most likely the original Desert Profound Armor was far too unwieldy, so they had no choice but to reforge it into soft armor. Otherwise, by the Azure Pond Sect’s standards, they’d have tried turning it into a feathered robe!”

Li Zhouwei admired it for a while and was clearly pleased. He called out and the white armor rose on its own to wrap itself properly around his body. Tall and broad-shouldered, he stood proud, clad in white-gold battle gear gleaming with radiant light. As his golden eyes swept the room, he truly looked like a direct heir of an immortal family.

Only then did Li Qinghong speak gently, “This armor uses Desert Profound Sky Iron and Radiant Origin Stone for its core, with Wolfscale Bone and Crimson White Feather for the scales. Forged under True Flame by several high-level artifact smiths from the Azure Pond Sect, it is named Yuan’e.”

Li Zhouwei nodded gently. Li Xuanxuan, slightly surprised, asked, “Have you already refined it?”

Everyone knew that dharma artifacts required refining before use. They had to be saturated with mana. It wasn’t too difficult for Qi Cultivation Realm artifacts, and Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts already took significant time. Masterless ones were easier and often required days. If it was already bound to a previous owner, they took much longer. Some ancient technique artifacts like the Chongming Profound Insight Screen could take months...

Yet Li Zhouwei wielded the armor as if it were already his. Li Xuanxuan couldn't help but ask in puzzlement. Li Zhouwei replied with a smile, “I haven’t refined it... but things of Bright Yang nature naturally favor me. I can use them as I please even without refining them!”

As he spoke, the Da Sheng halberd manifested in his hand, radiating a bright, arcing glow. When its tip gently touched the floor, Li Qinghong smiled and said, “Go ahead and test your hand, have the white ape exchange a few moves with you.”

Li Zhouwei smiled and nodded, but said, “I’m afraid that won’t be enough.”

Li Xuanxuan let out a rare hearty laugh, while Li Qinghong withdrew the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, pushed open the palace doors, and stepped outside into the brisk morning wind. The creaking wooden clogs gave away the narrow-eyed monk’s stride.

Li Qinghong asked softly, “How about Kongheng?”

That drew Kongheng’s attention. He looked at the group, puzzled. Li Xuanxuan, whose memory of the monk still lingered in the distant past, smiled and nodded, “He seems quite good to me.”

Li Qinghong, however, was more hesitant. Kongheng was no longer the man he used to be. A Master Monk’s lifespan was no short matter, and cultivation under ancient Buddhist methods progressed slowly. Though he was never flashy, years of tempered cultivation had made him someone not easily underestimated.

“Even if his strength lies in defense rather than offense, he would still stand a strong chance against cultivators from the three sects and seven gates.”

Not wanting to dampen Li Zhouwei’s spirit, she turned and asked Kongheng directly, “May I ask, Master Monk, how would you rate your current strength?”

Kongheng paused in thought before giving a wry smile, “I doubt I could withstand your thunder arts... but I can still manage against other things.”

Li Qinghong was confident in her own strength. Amplified by several dharma artifacts, her thunder arts were powerful enough to rival Tang Shedu of old. That meant Kongheng had reached the level of a peak master in the Azure Pond Sect.

Before she could say anything further, the monk smiled and added, “If I’m on the defensive, even a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would have trouble killing me. But if I take the offensive... my strength would drop significantly. I’d say I’m around the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.”

He was, of course, comparing himself to direct descendants of the three sects and seven gates. Li Qinghong quickly made her assessment and thought, Slightly weaker than Xizhi... roughly on par with Ximing.

She said gently, “Master Monk, why not test the heir’s strength? Just a light spar will do.”

“Very well!” replied Kongheng.




# Chapter 957: Planning for What Comes After

The heavy rain over Lake Xian had just ended. The skies had cleared, and Li Qinghong stood atop the lake, riding thunder. This part of the water was completely empty, with no trace of people. Li Xuanxuan and the white ape stood beside her.

Moongaze Lake was crowded with people and too conspicuous for a fight, so the group naturally wouldn't make a scene there. Instead, they found a random spot on Lake Xian to land. This was the quietest location in the inland region, with only two lake-dwelling demonic creatures passing by on patrol. When they saw several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, they didn’t dare interfere and pretended not to see them as they slipped away across the water.

Two small boats passed by in the distance, manned by disciples of the Kong Family. They circled around, spotted Li Qinghong from afar, recognized her, offered a distant bow, and continued on their way.

Li Zhouwei raised his hand with his palm facing up. A surge of blazing Radiant Light burst from his palm, forming two armored soldiers by his side. Their white-scaled armor shimmered under the sunlight, with matching silver boots. Their faces bore neither helmets nor features, just a blank expanse of pale light.

Both wielded spears and carried bows on their backs, exuding an imposing presence.

As for Li Zhouwei himself, he held a halberd across his body. Radiant Light gathered at the arc in the center of the weapon, where two halberd blades joined to form a razor-sharp edge that gleamed menacingly.

Kongheng pressed his palms together before his chest, his narrow eyes squinting nearly shut. He chanted softly, and pale golden runes flew from his crimson lips and white teeth and started to circle him.

Li Zhouwei flipped his halberd upward. The Radiant Light at its center rippled, releasing an invisible, colorless glow that instantly covered a section of the lake. White steam hissed up from the surface.

Across from him, Kongheng fared better. He merely felt the blinding light crash against his face like fire, which made it hard to lift his gaze. But as a Buddhist cultivator, he wasn’t afraid of such forces and was not greatly affected.

But the sudden heat was harsh on the lurking demonic creatures nearby. They began sweating profusely and grew restless. After exchanging glances, most of them lost their curiosity and quietly dispersed.

"Da Sheng!"

But Li Zhouwei didn’t stop there. With a command, a stream of flame shot out from the arc and draped over his body. Radiant Light rolled across his armor, and fire spiraled beneath his feet.

Bang!

A sonic boom erupted over the lake. An instant later, the long halberd was already upon Kongheng. The monk finally opened his eyes a little, and suddenly parted his palms, sending forth a burst of golden runes.

The golden runes transformed into chains in midair, clinking noisily as they wrapped around Da Sheng like serpents. Li Zhouwei flexed his forearm, and his halberd shuddered violently, breaking most of them apart.

Kongheng’s hand seal changed in an instant, and his eyes opened slightly wider.

The golden light behind him condensed into a large orb. Then, a massive figure emerged with a thunderous boom. A golden upper body took shape, six arms spreading wide through the air, covered in dense golden script. Its golden face, marked with two broad horizontal lines, glowed with red light and radiated immense authority.

A towering, six-armed Vajra in golden armor rose upright from the golden light.

"Decree!"

The Vajra's eyes widened, and all six of its arms tugged on the golden chains in unison. A heavy metallic clatter rang out as every chain tightened at once, bursting forth in a dazzling flash of golden light.

The golden-armored Vajra was as large as a temple. Its eyes were as wide as windmills, casting a massive shadow over Lake Xian. In front of it, Li Zhouwei looked like a small colt tethered outside a gate. His dharma artifact was yanked taut in an instant.

Kongheng had struck with his full strength, using Buddhist cultivator secret techniques. Li Qinghong and the others all nodded in approval.

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard, lifting his white brows in mild surprise. He turned and said with a smile, "A monk cultivates the heart and is free from worldly affairs. When he strikes, he does so with everything and holds nothing back."

Kongheng wasn't the type to joke around or show favoritism. This strike alone would have disarmed most Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Dense golden chains wrapped tightly around Da Sheng, making Li Zhouwei feel a sudden heaviness in his hands.

Without a moment’s hesitation, he opened his mouth and spat out a beam of white light. The white light shot upward like a white rainbow, not toward Kongheng himself, but directly at the golden-armored Vajra behind him.

It was the Radiant Origin Pass. A white pass formed in the air, dispersing the golden glow in an instant. The Radiant Origin Pass excelled in suppression, and was especially effective against incorporeal spell arts. The Vajra was suppressed into a blur in a flash.

Kongheng nodded slightly when his opponent seized the chance to retrieve his dharma artifact. In theory, using the Radiant Origin Pass to suppress the opponent directly was the best strategy. Like Li Ximing had demonstrated, once the enemy was pinned down, casting spells and chanting incantations became difficult, while draining their mana and gaining the upper hand became easier over time.

But using an Immortal Foundation to suppress the opponent's spell arts might seem like a waste, since too much mana expended with each rise and fall, while the opponent could simply dismiss the spell and cast anew. But Li Zhouwei was facing Kongheng.

Kongheng’s cultivation excels in defense, and he far surpasses me in level. If I were to use an Immortal Foundation to suppress him directly, I’d be meeting strength with strength and weakness with weakness. Even if I manage to save myself this time, next time I’ll be bound by those golden chains, thought Li Zhouwei.

He had instantly capitalized on his opponent’s lack of offensive power and used his Immortal Foundation to grind down Kongheng’s spell arts, rendering them ineffective and preserving his own safety. As for the mana cost...

If I can shift this duel into a contest of mana, then that’s a win in itself!
𝑓𝑟ℯ𝘦𝓌𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂

The Radiant Origin Pass shimmered for a moment and shattered the phantom in the air into golden light. Kongheng flicked his sleeve, scattering the charging armored soldiers, and said lightly, "Come."

A bronze monk’s staff appeared in his hand. He lifted it into the air and slammed it down with tremendous force. Li Zhouwei raised his brow and brought his long halberd up to meet it.

Clang!

Li Zhouwei wielded an ancient dharma artifact from a grotto heaven, while Kongheng’s weapon was a guardian treasure he had cultivated with since his mortal days. Though it had been refined for many years and was extremely durable, it still couldn’t compare to such a treasure.

The sharp tips on the arc of the halberd gleamed and let out a metallic snap as they hooked into the arched head of the monk's staff. Li Zhouwei had been waiting for this moment. He twisted the halberd, unleashing a burst of Radiant Light flame.

The monk’s staff was firmly caught by the halberd’s hook and couldn’t break free, taking the full brunt of the Radiant Light flame. It crackled loudly as it sizzled, still hanging on the halberd and unable to detach.

Flame washed across Kongheng’s face, forcing him to retreat a step and laugh, "Good!"

His bronze monk’s staff suddenly twisted, writhing like a snake before slipping free from the halberd’s hook. Li Zhouwei, knowing this move wouldn’t finish the monk, followed through with a thrust.

With a shout, Kongheng flung away Li Zhouwei's dharma artifact. He clapped his palms together before his chest and let out a low cry, forcibly halting the halberd’s momentum.

He caught a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact with his bare body?

A flicker of astonishment appeared in Li Zhouwei's eyes. He knew the monk’s physical strength was formidable, but he hadn’t expected him to be this strong. With a thought, Radiant Light burst forth from Da Sheng.

Cough cough!

Kongheng had barely received the blow, but his palms were now scorched and seared from the heat. He quickly let go of the artifact, allowing the blazing Radiant Light to slam into him. He scrambled away in a rather disheveled state.

He ducked forward, lowered his gaze, and flung out a sleeve of golden runes in the same motion. Before the runes could fully form in midair, the long-watchful Radiant Origin Pass came crashing down from the sky. Yet Kongheng remained unfazed.

The heir has only just broken through. His control over his Immortal Foundation must still be unrefined. The Radiant Origin Pass is no ordinary spell, but a projection of the Immortal Foundation itself. Each rise and fall stirs tremendous fluctuations in internal mana! thought Kongheng.

As Li Zhouwei activated his Immortal Foundation, Kongheng’s eyes abruptly flared with golden light. He pressed his palms together and exhaled sharply, "Ha!"

The cry tore through the air like bamboo splitting or silk tearing, shaking the lake's surface into waves. Kongheng had been a Master Monk for many years, and this shout struck precisely just as Li Zhouwei’s mana flow turned. The Immortal Foundation trembled, and Li Zhouwei's face flushed red as he nearly spat out blood.

Kongheng immediately made his move. When the Radiant Origin Pass trembled, not only did a stream of golden runes shoot forth, but the golden figure it had nearly worn down rose again. It reached out with six arms and released a cascade of golden chains into the sky.

Li Zhouwei immediately quelled his internal turbulence, but his opponent had already taken the initiative. Gold light flickered in his eyes, while Kongheng's expression remained firm and unwavering.

It had to be said, aside from his lack of offensive techniques, Kongheng had nearly no weaknesses. Even under the terrifying pressure of Li Zhouwei’s Great Fissure Golden Eye, which enhanced his perception technique to a fearsome level, Kongheng was unaffected. The Radiant Light’s power to dispel and suppress misfortune had little impact on his Buddhist radiance.

I’ve yet to complete Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light... otherwise, I wouldn’t be this helpless... Li Zhouwei exhaled deeply as he was forced to retreat.

But given that his strength was already far inferior, this retreat placed him squarely in the monk’s tempo. Kongheng’s golden chains swayed in the air, while the cluster of golden runes transformed into a small golden wooden fish to resist the Radiant Origin Pass.

The Radiant Origin Pass couldn’t be dealt with by a mere spell, but if the Li Family knew Kongheng well, could Kongheng not know the Li Family just as well? No matter how many wooden fish were crushed beneath its weight, each rise of the Pass triggered another wave of Buddhist resonance, reinforced by golden chains that forced him back into confinement.

Kongheng conducted himself with the utmost seriousness. Even with the clear advantage, he showed no openings. He cautiously tightened the golden chains little by little. After nearly a hundred exchanges, Kongheng finally ceased chanting, and Li Zhouwei planted his halberd to the ground and stopped.

The reason was simple. If the fight continued, it would become a duel to the death. Though the golden chains couldn’t kill Li Zhouwei, escaping them would still cost him vital qi. This was just a sparring match, so there was no need to go that far.

Li Zhouwei handed the halberd to one of his armored soldiers. He had advanced smoothly throughout the battle. After a long moment of reflection, he nodded and said, "I’ve gained much from this exchange."

Kongheng gave a bitter smile and shook his head, only now realizing he had been a bit too harsh. He said softly, "A monk bullying the young with strength... it's hardly justifiable."

"Ah." Little did anyone know, but Li Xuanxuan had been watching with great delight. After all, Li Zhouwei had managed to break through Kongheng’s defenses once. If it had been any other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, they would have had quite the headache. Fortunately, it was Kongheng he had faced. The old man chuckled and said, "Good... very good!"

Li Qinghong had been smiling gently the whole time and said little. The group rode the wind back to the shore, and only then did she speak softly, "Zhouwei, though your cultivation is still shallow, your strength is beginning to show its edge... From now on, I’ll entrust the lake to you and I can rest a little easier."

Li Zhouwei appeared to realize something and nodded heavily. He waved his hand, dismissing Kongheng, the white ape, and the others. Li Qinghong patted him lightly and said with a smile, "Don’t forget, Yuan’e hasn’t been refined yet. You’re only wearing it. Once it’s fully refined, your strength will grow even more."

Li Zhouwei nodded naturally. Li Qinghong continued in a gentle voice, "Our family has given what it can to aid you—armor, halberd, techniques, spell arts, spirit pills... We’ve done our best. Just by being born into this family, we can’t offer you anything better..."

Li Zhouwei was sharp. He sensed something strange in her tone and said gravely, "Please be at ease. I’ve only ever felt overwhelmed by the abundance, never its lack. Minghuang holds the house oath and all its strictures close, and would never dare violate them!"

Li Qinghong let out a soft sigh. It was as if she relaxed, though there was a trace of lament in her breath. She said quietly, "I know... but there’s one matter I must speak with you about."

She paused, then spoke warmly, "Our family's minor sect, when dealing with those of different surnames, has always supported anyone with sufficient innate ability with spirit resources. Chen Yang, who had the highest innate ability, was even granted the Qingdu treatment... I once discussed with my brother that if someone shows the potential for the Foundation Establishment Realm, our family will ensure they receive the necessary cultivation methods.

"But those early families who followed us, like the families of Lijing, though now grand households, were originally farmers. Ultimately, they rarely had the potential for Foundation Establishment Realm, so those cultivation methods have simply sat unused."

She glanced at the lakeshore and said softly, "Now that the lakefront has been unified and the various families serve under our banner, people like An Siwei and Chen Yang show promise of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm. They must be given the chance; don’t let family prejudice cloud your judgment.

"If they succeed in reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm and are willing to take on a post under our house, let them stay. If not, and they seek better prospects elsewhere, then let them go with this bond of goodwill and let them take their families along."

These words left Li Zhouwei silent. Compared to the Azure Pond Sect, their family had little allure for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Without true emotional ties, wouldn't these people be happier choosing their own place to cultivate and establish their own house, rather than living under someone else's roof?

Only the old man at the side furrowed his brow upon hearing this and said softly, "Qinghong, what are you..."

Li Qinghong spoke softly, "Our household has little need for extra hands right now. It's best to advise any cultivator who breaks through to the Foundation Establishment Realm to go their own way. If they remain here by the lake, I fear they’ll fall prey to schemes from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

"Our family has done right by them. As for techniques, so long as one has enough innate ability and access to spiritual qi, everything except our core secret techniques has been open for study. Spirit resources and items have been distributed annually by every peak and branch; those with higher innate ability receive additional support, and even the opportunity to cultivate on the island. Whenever there’s danger, our own kin were the first to step forward. The other houses respect us for this and this is the bond we share.

"But those are things we can afford to give. Once they reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, however, they will need certain resources that our ancestors risked their lives to obtain, or I did myself. I can only give them to my family. We can no longer afford to give to others... and if we withhold those things, resentment will grow. That would only ruin the goodwill we’ve built."

The woman said gently, "What I mean is... our family must prioritize the Purple Mansion Realm above all. We must avoid creating side troubles. Once provoked, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator’s divine ability can stir countless consequences. It’s better to advise them to leave first, and preserve our bond. Why risk everything for just one or two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators?"

Li Zhouwei finally nodded and said softly, "I understand. So long as our family has no Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of its own, if those of other surnames or minor sects reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, we should first urge them to take their families elsewhere."

Li Qinghong smiled at him, then turned to gaze over the lake. At her side, Li Xuanxuan said nothing. After a long silence, she turned and said, "Uncle, take care of your health."




# Chapter 658: Secret

Pingya Island.

Brilliant sunlight streamed through the grand hall as Li Zhouwei sat in the master's chair, a jade slip in his hands. Golden rays swept across the lacquered crimson pillars and spread across the spacious floor.

Since returning from the lake, Li Qinghong had retreated to her cave dwelling to await Xi Zikang's arrival in seclusion. His father Li Chengliao was also in closed-door cultivation, polishing his abilities in preparation for his Foundation Establishment breakthrough. Once again, the reins of power had fallen into Li Zhouwei's hands.

Li Zhouwei didn't mind the responsibility. Advancing too quickly in cultivation would only invite suspicion, so he planned to focus on perfecting his techniques while tempering his foundation—it wouldn't interfere with family affairs anyway.

His hand rested on the desk as pale golden light flowed across the jade slip, revealing several small characters:

**"Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light"**

With Xi Zikang not yet entered into their hidden realm, Li Zhouwei couldn't access the other movement technique, "Flowing Sun Refraction," for now. Over the past year, while dispatching people into the mountains to contact Bai Rong, he had dedicated himself to studying this technique and made some progress.

His spiritual consciousness dove into his body, where he observed the Juque Palace shrouded in hazy mist. Only a single point of light flickered like a bean flame, continuously absorbing the dharma power within his body. Nothing particularly mystical was apparent to the naked eye.

Yet Li Zhouwei straightened his posture, lowering his gaze to the jade slip with deep contemplation as he gently caressed its surface.

The reason was simple—this was the first time the Li family had encountered, or even heard of, a technique that formed within the Juque Palace. Even more unheard of was how this "Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light" would compress from the Juque point, fly to the Shenyang point between the eyebrows, then emerge to battle enemies.

'It's commonly said that Foundation Establishment occurs in the Sea of Qi, while the Rising Sun governs divine abilities. But what exactly is the Giant Gate? Moreover, without achieving Purple Mansion realm, only the Sea of Qi among the three apertures is visible. The Juque Palace seems redundant in the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao...'

He could tell the technique's circulation routes and pathways were completely different. He could only determine that this technique was incredibly ancient—perhaps even predating the Purple Mansion Golden Core path. This led him to a certain expectation:

'Since the casting process is so elaborate, it probably can't be unleashed quickly. It would require deep concentration and calm focus—truly bearing the style of ancient times.'

As he pondered this, footsteps hurried into the hall. Chen Yang, clad in armor, knelt on one knee before the hall, his voice cold and deep:

"My lord! The Eastern Mountain Yue rebellion has been quelled. Li Jiman has come to pay his respects and waits outside the hall."

A year had passed since the events at the lake, and all remained peaceful except for some unrest in Eastern Mountain Yue. Li Jiman's son had failed to poison his father and fled the city, stirring up considerable chaos.

Li Zhouwei had sent Chen Yang on a trip. Descending from the sky, he had removed the prince's head, and Li Jiman had come crawling back with his tail between his legs.

This mountain chieftain knelt at the hall's entrance, his weathered face covered in cold sweat. Eastern Mountain Yue had essentially become indistinguishable from the eastern people now, dressed in refined clothing. Li Jiman's ceremonial cap had toppled to the ground, sitting askew.

Li Zhouwei glanced once at the old man, who wailed:

"Your humble servant greets... the Grand Concord of Radiance!"

The mountain tribes had always addressed him this way, and Li Zhouwei paid it no mind, continuing to read his jade slip while waiting for the man's self-defense.

Li Jiman's current position was extremely awkward. Li Yuan Ping had elevated him to the throne, making him essentially part of the first branch. But now power had shifted to the second branch. Although Li Xicheng and Li Chengliao harbored no factional prejudices, this remained an indelible mark against him.

He had always kept a low profile, but who could have known that his rebellious son, after forty years as crown prince, finally couldn't contain himself? When encouraging his father to break through to Foundation Establishment failed, the prince had turned to colluding with outsiders to poison him...

Now kneeling in the hall, he couldn't voice his grievances. After rambling through various explanations, he heard Li Zhouwei's light, dismissive response:

"Eastern Mountain Yue isn't large—keep a better watch over it. If your strength proves insufficient, the family will send people to assist."

Li Jiman could only kowtow in response. Chen Yang escorted him out, then returned to the hall, speaking in a low voice:

"Your Highness, this crown prince's actions seem unwise... there may be injustice involved. Could it be Di Liyoujie's doing?"

Eastern Mountain Yue and Northern Mountain Yue had always been at odds, so Chen Yang's suspicion was understandable. Li Zhouwei set down his jade slip and replied:

"Even if there is injustice, it's still Li Jiman's incompetence—at his age, unable to control even his own son... Dili Youjie fought alongside me through life and death, after all. He wouldn't choose to court death at this moment."

Rising from behind his desk, he continued in a low voice:

"Open and covert struggles between various houses and factions are commonplace in the family. Since Li Jiman and Dili Youjie refuse to choose sides, naturally someone wants to replace the Mountain Yue king. Take one, release another—next time there's a reckoning, it won't stop with just Li Jiman."

"Don't worry about these matters."

He strolled to the front of the hall, withdrawing a letter from his sleeve. It contained a series of recent changes in Azure Pond Sect, recorded in dense detail across an entire page.

Azure Pond Sect had been turned upside down this past year. Chi Xunxiao had comprehensively promoted Chi Fubo's faction, making them dominant within the sect. Si Yuanli remained in seclusion behind closed doors, while the Si family faction had completely collapsed—barely anyone retained their positions.

Even the deeply-rooted Lingu family had lost several members from their Southern Sea positions. Li Xizhi had been missing for a year without trace, while Ning Hejing made major moves in the East Sea. There were even rumors that Li Xizhi had been eliminated by the Chi family.

The letter's conclusion mentioned that Azure Pond Sect's envoys had already arrived at Moongaze Lake with rewards. Li Zhouwei couldn't help but smile and shake his head:

'Azure Pond Sect is truly chaotic enough. The rewards for the North-South conflict were delayed for a full five years... only now do they mention rewards.'

Actually, aside from the Li and Lingu families, the other houses had received theirs years ago. These two families were told "your contributions are so great, they still require deliberation." This deliberation had lasted five years.

He calculated the dates—it should be today. After waiting a while, An Siwei indeed came forward to report respectfully:

"Your Highness, people from Azure Pond Sect have arrived!"

"Let's go welcome them."

He stepped outside, with the two men following behind as they headed out of the hall together.

Azure Pond Sect hadn't sent a Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner, but rather a spirit boat. Two people stood at its prow, both wearing pleasant expressions. Seeing Li Zhouwei approach, they both descended from the boat and offered respectful bows.

The leader appeared quite bold and spirited, his robes interwoven with blue and white, his eyes full of kindness and his tone quite courteous:

"I am Li Quantao. I greet the family head!"

Chi Fubo was clearly not a petty, foolish man. Since this was about bestowing rewards as favors, he wouldn't play games by sending someone to create difficulties. The person in charge of this matter was none other than Li Encheng's son, Li Quantao!

Li Zhouwei had heard this name before and understood that the family's relationship with this man was quite good. He said softly:

"Please, honored envoy!"

Li Quantao seemed to have fared well these past days. His demeanor appeared much more mature, and his bearing showed considerable presence. The several people behind him treated him with great respect.

Chi Fubo truly lacked capable subordinates, so he had reactivated many previously neglected talents. Li Quantao's faction had offended Chi Wei, but Chi Fubo couldn't care less—he promptly promoted him. Li Quantao's current position was quite elevated now.

He laughed heartily and entered together with the others. Once seated in the hall, he said earnestly:

"We're both Wei Li—I won't bother with all those twists and turns. Let's get straight to the matter!"

This man's manner was bold and generous. With a wave of his sleeve, his subordinate quickly brought forward a large box, holding it with both hands at the bottom. As dharma power flowed into it, the jade box opened by itself.

"Whoosh!"

The fragrance of pills rushed toward them. Five Essence Gathering Pills were visible, embedded in grooves—grayish with patterns, radiating flowing light. Behind him, An Siwei quickly lowered his head, not daring to look further.

Above were two smaller jade boxes and one elongated jade box. Li Quantao opened them one by one, saying softly:

"No need to elaborate on the Essence Gathering Pills—these five are extremely potent and greatly beneficial for Foundation Establishment. As for these two jade boxes, one contains the rare lightning-attribute pill 'Thunder Heart Union,' while the other holds 'Nine-Stamen Spirit Lily.'"

He held one up and opened it, revealing a pale purple heart and lung covered in dense black veins, faintly pulsating atop several flower petals.

Li Quantao chuckled and said:

"This item is easy to preserve, but you must never remove it during thunderstorms. If it's taken from the box during thunder and rain, it will transform into lightning and escape, scattering all its essence. Only Purple Mansion Realm cultivators can pursue it."

"This is very beneficial for lightning cultivators—it's for Senior Qinghong."

He closed this box and put it away, but didn't open the other jade box, introducing it through the container:

"This is 'Nine-Stamen Spirit Lily'—it can heal damaged foundations, congenital deficiencies, unstable cultivation, and unsteady immortal foundations. It cannot see light, or it will wither upon exposure."

Chi Fubo was quite generous after all. These two treasure medicines were both rare and valuable items. Li Quantao placed them together in the box, then took the longer jade box, opening it with a flip:

"This is a 'Bone Tree Yin Radiance Branch'—a rare Supreme Yin magical artifact..."

He raised his eyebrows to look at Li Zhouwei, sighing deeply before saying in a low voice:

"The sect master originally designated a Yang attribute magical artifact, but Master Ning repeatedly submitted memorials blocking it. This matter was delayed again and again, and in the end, that artifact couldn't be obtained, so it was changed to this one instead."

"I see!"

Li Zhouwei nodded, glancing at the jade box. Inside lay a jade branch the length of a forearm, half bone and half jade, clear and pristine white. Several forks hung with pure black leaves, sparse and scattered, shrouded in an aura of Yin energy.

'Bone Tree Yin Radiance Branch—such an unpleasant name... though its appearance isn't bad.'

After Li Zhouwei finished looking, he smiled and said:

"The envoy is too kind. Whatever the sect bestows is what it is—no need to trouble the sect master over it. My family accepts this gesture."

This magical artifact was definitely unusable for Li Zhouwei. Not just him—probably most cultivators couldn't understand how to use it properly. It would likely only show its true brilliance in the hands of the Veiled Yin Kingdom or the Chunyi Dao Gate.

But he felt Ning Hejing's actions made no sense whatsoever.

"I wonder what madness seized Ning Hejing. For the Chunyi Dao Gate, this is a treasure, but I can't use it myself—can't I trade it for something else?"

An Siwei accepted the jade box. Li Zhouwei noticed Li Quantao still showed regret, and his mind turned:

'Ning Hejing is at least someone governing a region—he shouldn't be foolish to this degree. He probably just spoke up to dissuade Chi Xunxiao from rewarding Yang attribute items, fearing our family would grow too powerful... It seems someone added fuel to the fire, wanting our family to hate Ning Hejing...'

Li Quantao only felt the young man before him had a somewhat domineering appearance, so he spoke more politely, never imagining that this youth's mind had raced through so many thoughts. Following him into the hall, he dismissed everyone around them and finally showed worry on his face.

He said in a low voice:

"Family head... have you heard any news of Xizhi? He and I are close as brothers... During his disappearance, the Earth Abyss has changed dramatically, and his soul lamp within the sect has grown extremely dim... I'm deeply worried!"

His anxious expression didn't seem feigned. Li Zhouwei shook his head, saying softly:

"If even the upper sect has no news, how would my family know!"

Li Quantao could only sit frowning in his seat, unable to relax for a long time. He said gravely:

"Your noble family may not understand the severity of this matter. The Earth Abyss is filled with Radiant Essence and Lesser Yang Light—both permeate throughout, blinding and harming the spirit. One year is already enough to be fatal!"

Li Zhouwei appeared thoughtful, slightly narrowing his eyes before raising his head with unease showing on his face. But inwardly, his heart pounded.

Li Xizhi's jade token in the family showed no changes whatsoever—in fact, it remained as bright as ever!

'Is the jade token imprecise... or are they testing me with words!'

Li Quantao and Li Xizhi shared a life-and-death friendship. Li Zhouwei didn't quite believe Li Quantao would conspire with Azure Pond Sect to deceive him, but fooling Li Quantao wasn't difficult at all. Using false information to stir true emotions really wasn't a challenging scheme.

Seeing his silence, Li Quantao thought he was wavering and said in a low voice:

"Xizhi has an excellent relationship with Master Si, and the senior died following his orders. You could inquire—there would surely be a response! He's constantly in seclusion and sees no one, so I can't meet with him... otherwise I would have asked personally!"

Li Zhouwei nodded with apparent realization and said happily:

"Good! I'll write a letter right away!"

Inwardly, he chuckled and thought:

'So that's the plan!'

Ask Si Yuanli? Si Yuanli was merely Foundation Establishment—how could he possibly know about events in the Earth Abyss thousands of miles away? They simply wanted to ask Si Boxiu!

'Si Yuanli has shown weakness for so long, and now with all his power lost, Chi Fubo has become suspicious, truly wondering if Si Boxiu is in seclusion while Si Yuanli acts for him in private!'

If Si Yuanli truly had the secret support of Daoist Master Yuanxiu, even if this letter contained no specific news about Li Xizhi, it would at least reveal that Li Xizhi was safe and sound, preventing the Li family from losing hope... And if Li Quantao, who knew the information, showed any signs of relaxation, Chi Fubo would immediately have grounds for judgment!

Li Zhouwei only showed a solemn expression, bowing to Li Quantao with gravity:

"Senior shared life-and-death bonds with my family's elders—I trust you completely! But this matter of my writing to inquire must absolutely not be known by others! If there's a reply letter, send someone to deliver it, but senior must never let others know... I fear something might happen!"

He added fuel to the fire, making Li Quantao nod repeatedly and swear several oaths. Li Zhouwei understood his good intentions, but if Chi Fubo was making this test, he definitely had ways to learn about their conversation—it was just a matter of belief or disbelief.

Seeing this matter settled, Li Quantao sighed with relief. Before long, he took his leave, and his group departed on clouds. Li Zhouwei escorted them out of the lake, watching them disappear into the distance.

He rode radiant light back, landing in the great hall, and pulled writing paper from his desk, casually tossing it aside.

Write to Si Yuanli? Communicating so openly—even if Si Yuanli dared to respond, Chi Fubo wouldn't dare believe it! From start to finish, Li Zhouwei never intended to write to Si Yuanli.

'News that comes so randomly and without direction... would truly seem like the result of secret communication between the Li and Si families through confidential letters...'

He calculated the timing—after about a month, he could reply to Li Quantao. But sending letters openly to the sect... how could that convince Chi Fubo?

"With Li Encheng and Li Enxi both dead one after another... the original channel has been severed..."

Li Zhouwei contemplated for a while, then lightly brushed the formation array on his desk. After waiting briefly, a young man entered the hall, wearing outer robes of blue and inner garments of white—it was Li Chenghuai.

Li Zhouwei's voice was extremely low:

"The Deng family left us a secret communication method years ago... Can that shop still be found? Please trouble clan uncle to make a trip to the market and contact the Deng family people. When the time comes, help me send a letter to the sect."

Li Chenghuai asked no questions, acknowledged the order, and withdrew. Li Zhouwei turned the jade slip in his hand, quietly gazing toward the brilliant jade boxes in the sunlight:

'For clever people... the more secretly something is heard, the more worthy of belief it becomes... To deal with clever people, act foolish; to deal with fools, act clever—nothing more than this.'



# Chapter 659: Meeting Heyun in the Abyss

Li Zhouwei calculated the days in his mind before stepping out from the main hall. As he walked through the corridors, An Siwei was already waiting in the side chamber, bowing respectfully.

"Your Highness, will you be visiting Madam Chen today..."

"With Kongheng protecting her, there's no need for daily visits. Let's see the eldest young master instead!"

Madam Chen had been with child for some time now, and Li Zhouwei had been visiting her more frequently. However, calculating the days, he realized it had been quite a while since he'd seen Li Jiangqian. The boy was already six years old—nearly time to begin his cultivation training.

"The eldest young master is still on the island, Your Highness, please..."

Li Zhouwei raised his head slightly and asked in a gentle tone, "What's he doing on the island?"

"The various branches throughout the island have gradually settled down. The eldest young master said he wanted to see the clan members before coming to pay his respects to Your Highness."

Li Zhouwei nodded and stepped outside. As they reached the great hall's entrance, he spotted a bustling crowd surrounding the child as they approached. Servants trailed behind carrying book boxes and large umbrellas, busy and flustered. Li Zhouwei turned back with a chuckle.

"Those junior members certainly follow him around every day."

This laughing remark sent chills down An Siwei's spine. He quickly whispered, "Your Highness, the young master is from the maternal An clan after all. The entire An family takes great pride in this honor. When the young master comes to the island for leisure, it's only natural that several people would attend to him..."

"Mm."

Li Zhouwei bent down and lifted the approaching Li Jiangqian into his arms. The crowd that had been chasing behind immediately fell to their knees in a mass. The child turned around in his embrace, and Li Zhouwei asked, "Qian'er, how was the island?"

Li Jiangqian looked up, his face still carrying traces of lingering joy as he replied cheerfully, "What a bunch of people, father! You took me to see the shores, but it's really no different from the island proper. Once you step out of this great hall, everything looks the same."

Li Zhouwei carried him toward the hall while An Siwei and the others remained waiting outside. Father and son walked into the sunlit main chamber, and the child continued, "Father speaks of close relatives, but I don't see how close they really are. They're all just common people, all wearing the same expressions. As for the cultivators... we've built the framework, and they hang from it."

Li Zhouwei glanced at him sideways and said softly, "That's order. Though people have emotions, they're also driven by profit. This framework that distributes benefits—that's order, whether large or small, good or bad."

Li Jiangqian lowered his head in thought for a moment, then suddenly looked up. "Qian'er doesn't understand. How can there be good and bad distinctions?"

Li Zhouwei smiled, a hint of appreciation rising in his eyes as he spoke gently, "For our Li family, if this framework benefits the common people, then it's good. The other clans also take this as their standard, maintaining the strictest control—this is where our family's laws and principles reside. Some noble families think our punishment and oppression of direct-line commoners, minor branches, and collateral members with different surnames is too harsh. That's because their order exists to serve the cultivators."

Li Jiangqian stared at him blankly, words reaching his lips only to be swallowed back down. His intuition told him he shouldn't ask, so he could only murmur inwardly, 'But what use is being good to them... common people are useless anyway...'

He averted his gaze, listening as Li Zhouwei continued softly, "This framework uses profit as its skeleton, bound and adorned with kinship and favor—only then can it remain stable and unbroken."

Li Jiangqian nodded as he listened. After chatting for a while longer, Li Zhouwei waved for someone to take the boy away. He sat alone on the steps as the sun moved westward, its rays falling across his dark red robes.

The fine golden embroidered patterns caught the light and gleamed. Li Zhouwei finally withdrew his gaze, paced a couple of steps, and Chen Yang hurried up from outside the hall. Li Zhouwei asked, "Still no news from the mountains?"

Chen Yang looked somewhat disheveled as he replied quietly, "No news..."

Li Zhouwei's voice grew heavy. "Even if we can't find the fox clan, that deer demon Lu Ken in the demon cave should have some information... Are you telling me you can't even find that deer demon?"

Chen Yang clasped his fists respectfully. "Your Highness, the demon cave in the southern foothills of Mount Dali is tightly sealed, and we haven't seen any lesser demons coming or going. Elder White Ape captured some passing demons to question them, but several didn't know anything. Only recently did we hear that Lu Ken has gone out."

Li Zhouwei frowned and turned around, thinking to himself, 'Whether he's truly gone out or just pretending—perhaps Dingjiao's matter is too difficult to handle... He knew in advance and refuses to meet.'

This situation was becoming quite troublesome. Although Dingjiao had shown considerable sincerity, Li Zhouwei had responded cautiously, saying only that he would help pass along the message. But now they couldn't even catch sight of a demon's shadow...

After pondering for a moment, he replied, "Continue investigating."

Chen Yang acknowledged and withdrew. Li Zhouwei made his calculations, 'If there's no news for the next few years, then most likely Lu Ken refuses to meet. I'll just have to tell the truth. After all, our family made no advance promises, so we shouldn't offend the dragon clan.'

Li Zhouwei put away the several reward items from the jade box. Looking at the five Essence Gathering Pills, they were indeed all dull and gray—he couldn't tell whether they were made from humans or demon beasts. He organized everything properly and sent it to Mount Wu for his seventh great-uncle Li Ximing to examine.

'It seems seventh great-uncle still has two Essence Gathering Pills that the Ning family gave him. We can use those first.'

According to Li Ximing, those two were almost certainly refined by the Xiao family, both filled with pure spiritual energy. Li Zhouwei dispatched An Siwei to make a trip to Mount Wu to inquire, while he pondered the situation.

Quite a few people in his family could use these items.

His father Li Chengliao and younger uncle Li Chenghuai both had cultivation levels ready for secluded cultivation at any time. Those with slightly lower cultivation included his aunt Li Minggong in the great desert, An Siwei just now, and Li Wen who stood guard outside the hall with his golden hammer...

Though their cultivation was described as "slightly lower," after taking a talisman pill, they too would have sufficient cultivation to attempt Foundation Establishment. Li Zhouwei only had two usable pills in his possession.

He calculated quietly, 'Father and younger uncle definitely need one reserved.'

Li Zhouwei planned to give at least one Essence Gathering Pill to someone outside the family. After careful consideration, he thought, 'Essence Gathering Pills are spiritual medicines that assist with Foundation Establishment—extremely attractive... Being able to give out Essence Gathering Pills versus not being able to is completely different treatment... As long as one is given out... the rest will eagerly await their turn!'

Since Li Zhouwei knew that the Xiao family could also refine Essence Gathering Pills now, rather than them being monopolized by the Azure Pond Sect alone, he felt more relaxed. Even if those five Essence Gathering Pills had problems, the losses wouldn't be too great—at worst, he could compensate with other items and trade with the Xiao family.

After waiting like this for a while, An Siwei approached from outside the hall, carrying a jade box and speaking respectfully, "Your Highness, the items have been delivered. Master Ximing wasn't in deep seclusion, and these two spiritual pills have been retrieved."

Li Zhouwei casually put them away, dismissed An Siwei first, calculated the days, and decided to distribute these items when the time came for sacrificial ceremonies. He then began reading technique manuals in the hall. As light and shadow alternated several times, Li Wen from outside the hall approached with some urgency, calling out in a rough voice, "Your Highness! The Shen clan from north of the river has come calling!"

...

**Eastern Sea.**

The Earth Abyss stretched in gray-black darkness, with points of rainbow light shuttling through it. Li Xizhi rode the rainbow light through the surging Radiant Essence and evil qi until he stopped before a stone wall.

He transformed into rainbow light and slipped through a crack in the wall, shuttling through the deep darkness for a while before stopping in a somewhat cold cavern.

*Drip.*

The clear, cold sound of water echoed as something massive and black coiled at the cavern's ceiling. Pure black pupils opened as a hissing serpent's voice emerged.

"Young Master."

Li Xizhi nodded slightly, the jade bottle in his hand flashing with brilliant light. He chuckled and said warmly, "Quite good luck. I searched through the earth veins for a while and discovered a stream of **Deep Sea Radiant Essence**. Though this substance has been extinct for many years and its uses have gradually been lost to time, it's still a rare treasure."

"Congratulations, Young Master."

The black and red qi within the jade bottle moved like water, gently rippling. Li Xizhi was obviously quite satisfied as he flipped his hand to put it away. Li Wushao spoke in his hoarse voice, "News has come from the Si family. Please have a look, Young Master."

Li Xizhi had arrived at this place just as the earth veins shifted. Radiant Essence and Lesser Yang light drifted about, impacting the spiritual qi within his body and intertwining with the immortal foundation in his qihua acupoint—an extremely dangerous environment.

Fortunately, the talisman he'd received was **Rainbow Pierce Skyway**. When this dense and overbearing Radiant Essence and Lesser Yang light impacted his body, it was quickly and easily dissolved, allowing him to get by reasonably well in these earth veins.

But while he could endure it, Li Wushao was suffering terribly from the burning, his entire body sizzling and smoking. Li Xizhi had no choice but to protect the old demon, following the earth veins until he found a relatively safe cave where he first settled Li Wushao.

Upon arriving here and checking the Golden Feather Sect's maps, he discovered a water vein nearby that connected directly to the Eastern Sea above. Li Xizhi's mind turned, and he understood much immediately.

So he settled the old demon here to carefully guard this water vein while he went out to collect spiritual materials. Now that he'd returned, he'd indeed received news from the Si family as expected.

Li Wushao's voice was low but carried considerable admiration as he spoke, "After Master went out for several days, a spiritual talisman came flowing down this water vein, rushing straight toward the cave dwelling. I intercepted it."

Li Xizhi took the spiritual talisman from his hands and sighed, "Daoist Master Yuanxiu truly hasn't entered seclusion—this is wonderful!"

No matter what, Li Wushao was still a century-old demon. How could he not hear the change in tone? This scared him out of his wits, and he was secretly horrified, 'Yes... to be able to calculate that we're here, it must be Si Boxiu's handiwork. This spiritual talisman's origins are unclear—I mustn't speak carelessly!'

He immediately understood and fell silent. Li Xizhi took the spiritual talisman and indeed found it contained much information, written in Si Tongyi's tone. After reading through it generally, he began to think.

'The Si family retreats steadily... it seems they're no longer a significant force... With me missing and Southern Sea demonic cultivators in chaos, the Lingu Family can barely take care of themselves... The situation is truly excellent for them...'

'Chi Fubo is still cautious, still unwilling to act rashly, replacing his trusted subordinates bit by bit... But Ning Hejing can't hold back anymore...'

The letter mentioned that Ning Hejing had frequently left the Eastern Sea in recent months, privately moving in and out of the sect, having long conversations with Chi Xunxiao's trusted followers.

'I wonder if Chi Fubo knows—it's like placing a sword at Chi Fubo's throat...'

Besides these two pieces of news, there was also information about Li Quantao going to the Li family. Li Xizhi didn't mind this: 'Quantao has no cunning—he won't harm my family. At most he'll be used by others. My family's heir has already achieved Foundation Establishment Realm. The only ones in the Azure Pond who could scheme against him are Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Though Chi Fubo has some schemes, he's isolated and can't accomplish great things.'

Another piece of news made Li Xizhi furrow his brow: 'Uncle Yuanqin... left the sect once and met with someone unknown.'

For Si Yuanli to obtain such timely information about these matters, his control over the Azure Pond probably hadn't truly weakened much. Li Xizhi wasn't worried about this—his only concern was for this uncle Li Yuanqin.

'I just hope he won't be accidentally harmed...'

After searching through the spiritual talisman several more times and finding no other functions, Li Xizhi crushed it—this served as a response to Si Tongyi on the other end. He asked gently, "How are your injuries?"

"Still manageable..."

Though Li Wushao had a foul mouth and often cursed, serpents were actually extremely patient by nature. The impact of two types of evil qi and Lesser Yang light within his body wasn't something that could be easily endured.

Li Wushao only said in a hoarse voice, "Though painful, it's much lighter than Merging Fire and Converging Water injuries. Our clan is often tormented by dragons, and Converging Water injuries are commonplace."

Li Xizhi's talisman qi only worked on himself and was helpless against the injuries within Wushao's body. After giving him medicine, he said gently, "Ning Hejing is overbearing—I don't dare leave you behind. Fortunately, there's no Radiant Essence here, so rest well."

"Young Master should go as you please and needn't mind me. When the earth veins shift and the two qi and one light gush forth, it's also when treasures are most abundant. Since Young Master isn't afraid, don't waste this opportunity."

The old snake lowered his head and stopped responding. Li Xizhi had no choice but to transform into rainbow light and fly from the cave. He casually sealed the cave entrance and plunged back into the intense Radiant Essence, heading eastward.

After traveling over a hundred li, Li Xizhi suddenly frowned. Colorful light flashed between his pupils as his gaze penetrated the dense Lesser Yang light, and he suddenly spotted something.

In a patch of Lesser Yang light, evil qi rolled and churned. Lying in the earth vein was a feathered beast, large as a table—a beautifully formed, brilliantly colored fish with wings extending from beneath its ribs. It had a large round head, a flat fish snout, and orange feathers on both wings that kept flapping as if struggling.

Li Xizhi cautiously stopped, slightly frowning as he thought, 'A Dawn Rayfish? That’s one enormous Dawn Rayfish!'

Li Xizhi wasn't unfamiliar with Dawn Rayfishes—he'd seen one before, but they were only palm-sized. He'd never heard of one as large as a table. Seeing this Dawn Rayfish lying motionless on the ground, he became alert and observed carefully.

As time passed and noon arrived, the Lesser Yang light weakened, with some even transforming into sunlight within the intense spiritual energy. Li Xizhi felt a chill by his ear as a faint, calm, and elegant voice arose:

"What is Fellow Daoist Xizhi waiting for?"

Such a sentence suddenly emerging in the utterly silent earth vein, spoken in such a calm tone, was enough to frighten an ordinary cultivator's soul from their body—especially when two qi and one light were currently rampaging about, and even Foundation Establishment cultivators wouldn't linger here long.

'Purple Mansion?!'

Li Xizhi was greatly alarmed. The radiant light on his body instantly rippled outward, and several phantom figures scattered from his body, fleeing in different directions. Orange-red coloration flew up from these figures.

**Gold in Cloud**!

The orange-red light points Li Xizhi had transformed into leaped through the air several times before materializing. He swept out a sleeve of rainbow light, turned to draw his long sword, and indeed found someone already standing behind him!

"Oh?"

This person seemed surprised by his casting speed and appeared quite astonished, yet didn't move at all, standing with hands behind his back. When Li Xizhi saw who it was, he immediately relaxed and smiled wryly, sheathing his sword and politely cupping his hands in respectful greeting.

"Greetings, Senior Heyun!"

The person before him had bright, piercing eyes, elegant and natural bearing, with hair bound neat and tidy, sleeves and collar perfectly pressed, even the hems on both sides symmetrically aligned. This was none other than Dongfang Heyun!

Dongfang Heyun nodded politely, performing a standard return bow that would put cultivators from south of the river to shame, and smiled. "We haven't met in years—Fellow Daoist has truly advanced greatly in strength!"



# Chapter 660: Seventh Cloud

Dongfang Heyun maintained his usual elegant and dignified appearance. This first wisp of cloud energy expelled when the Dragon Monarch achieved his divine position often acted in unexpected ways, harboring an obsession with his own appearance and being extremely particular about propriety. He stood respectfully at a measured distance, smiling warmly.

"Fellow Daoist, you have truly made remarkable progress. When I first met you, a single spell required several breaths to complete. Now I see you accomplish the same in but a single thought."

"Senior flatters me!"

Li Xizhi replied respectfully. Dongfang Heyun flicked his sleeves and stepped forward, approaching the Dawn Rayfish in just a few strides. He lifted it with one hand, turning it over to reveal the creature's bloodied belly, its eyes still wide and watchful.

Dongfang Heyun bowed slightly, speaking in gentle tones.

"This beast came from the north, crashing into Converging Water Sea's Forge Mountain`1. Several dragons were playing in the waters, chasing and frolicking about. I happened to be passing by when it fell into my hands."

"You contributed to the Touba Chongyuan affair and were injured in the process. I brought this along as compensation."

He chuckled softly before continuing.

"After circling around, I discovered you were here..."

Dongfang Heyun paused, and Li Xizhi quickly demurred.

"This junior merely fulfilled his assigned duties to the best of his ability, doing nothing more than preserving his own life. It was Senior's assistance that resolved many future troubles for me."

Dongfang Heyun shook his head, pacing closer as he spoke.

"Simply accept it."

His voice gradually lowered, a flicker of confusion crossing his features. He took two steps in place before speaking softly.

"I have something I must ask you, Fellow Daoist."

"Please speak freely, Senior!"

Li Xizhi responded immediately. Dongfang Heyun spoke in measured tones.

"Within this Earth Abyss, two energies and one radiance—malevolent energy, Radiant Essence, and Lesser Yang light—permeate everything. They invade the physical body and course through the meridians. Ordinary people cannot resolve such influences. Even those monks from the north cannot remain here for extended periods."

He paused, his eyes slowly meeting Li Xizhi's gaze as he spoke quietly.

"Yet Fellow Daoist Xizhi seems entirely unaffected?"

Li Xizhi understood his question halfway through and felt alarm bells ringing in his mind.

Li Xizhi knew that Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were monitoring his family, but the Earth Abyss was formed from the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch's transformation. At most, those in the Purple Mansion Realm could calculate his general location but couldn't observe specific details, nor would they necessarily watch him constantly.

Despite all his calculations, he never anticipated Dongfang Heyun would be waiting for him here. Waiting would have been one thing, but the fact that he had observed from nearby for quite some time and noticed Li Xizhi showed no adverse effects had exposed his unusual nature.

'How can I explain this... A cultivation method? Secret technique? Spiritual treasure?'

His mind raced for an instant before he replied in low tones.

"Replying to Senior, the rainbow light of my immortal foundation within my energy sea possesses the ability to neutralize malevolent energies that enter the body. Though it has limited effectiveness against the two energies and one radiance of this place, it can provide some relief."

"Additionally, there is a nearby cavern free from radiance and malevolent energy intrusion. This junior often takes shelter there to purify his spiritual qi, thus managing to survive."

Li Xizhi delivered his explanation in one fluid breath, his tone steady and respectful. Dongfang Heyun listened carefully, remaining silent for a moment.

Though immortal foundations each possessed unique effects, their specific details often varied considerably. Li Xizhi could only attribute his resistance vaguely to his foundation, his heart gradually growing heavy with worry.

Dongfang Heyun remained quiet for quite some time before laughing and responding.

"If you put it that way, Fellow Daoist Xizhi, it's because that master of Mount Luoxia gathered the northern dao lineages, embracing all with inclusive acceptance and preserving most of the northern immortal dao. Thus, the Radiant Glow Dao developed the ability to neutralize other dao methods."

Dongfang Heyun always spoke with natural elegance. Li Xizhi couldn't discern his true intentions or even tell whether he was being sarcastic or seriously elaborating. He could only respond quietly.

"This junior has learned much."

His response was deliberately ambiguous, acceptable whether interpreted positively or negatively. Dongfang Heyun chuckled twice, pressing two fingers together and pointing them at the Dawn Rayfish's head before flicking outward.

Within the dense radiance and malevolent energy, layers of mist suddenly appeared, with several blurred light shadows weaving through them. After Dongfang Heyun recited just a few incantations, he produced something glimmering bright, simply saying.

"Keep this safe!"

This was naturally the creature's spiritual essence. As a spiritual demon himself, Dongfang Heyun found extracting spiritual essence quite effortless. He required no spiritual artifacts or formations, simply drawing it out with ease and transferring it to another's hands—something likely beyond Foundation Establishment Realm capabilities.

Li Xizhi observed everything carefully, raising his estimation of the man's strength another notch as he accepted the essence into his brow center. Dongfang Heyun looked back at the Dawn Rayfish with a smile.

"Do you understand? Just follow him properly. I know you possess many techniques and your spiritual essence may not necessarily be easily bound, but if you don't serve well, the Dragon Monarch won't lack for rayfish delicacies."

The Dawn Rayfish nodded, turning its body over. Its voice rang clear as it replied.

"This little demon understands."

Dongfang Heyun straightened his sleeves and bowed politely before looking toward Li Xizhi with a smile.

"If the opportunity arises, please give my regards to Fellow Daoist Qinghong. I await her in the grotto heaven."

Li Xizhi's eyebrows shot up suddenly. Just as he was about to speak, Dongfang Heyun had already vanished from sight, leaving only scattered cloud fragments that dispersed cleanly in the bright Lesser Yang light.

The moment Dongfang Heyun disappeared, the Dawn Rayfish that had been playing dead immediately leaped up, transforming into a youth in colorful feathered robes. His face was small and slightly round, with clear, bright eyes and fine orange plumage at his temples. He called out in ringing tones.

"Seventh greets his lord!"

Li Xizhi's mind was heavy with concerns, feeling no joy at gaining a Foundation Establishment Realm Dawn Rayfish subordinate. He nodded silently and spoke gently.

"You're injured. Don't linger too long in this place. Come with me quickly to that area free from malevolent energy and radiance to rest and heal your wounds properly."

"Yes."

The youth followed behind him, circulating his radiant spiritual qi throughout his body to resist the penetrating light and malevolent energy. Li Xizhi's face remained calm, but his heart churned like turbulent waves, filled with worry and apprehension.

'Dongfang Heyun was teaching me... that explanation was quite reasonable, but what exactly is he thinking?'

He flew through the earth channels, his thoughts swirling.

Even now, Li Xizhi couldn't clearly discern Dongfang Heyun's exact status among the dragon clan. He could only continue flying silently, composing his emotions before landing back at his cave dwelling.

"Young Master."

Li Wushao was clearly somewhat surprised but didn't ask many questions, simply offering a greeting. Li Xizhi nodded, seating the colorfully dressed youth and providing him with healing pills before speaking softly.

"It's inconvenient to speak freely outside. This place is more secure. How serious are your injuries? If they're manageable, tell us about your background."

The youth nodded and replied respectfully.

"This subordinate was born in the North Sea, originally gathering radiance and absorbing energy with many brothers. We encountered the great upheaval of the heavenly breach and falling waters, gaining the opportunity to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Our clan was already sparse to begin with, and breaking through to Foundation Establishment was typically a one-in-ten-thousand chance. Unexpectedly, when heaven released its great waters, we broke through by following the momentum. After circling the waterspout in the sky once, most of us were captured, with only nine brothers successfully achieving Foundation Establishment."

"This subordinate is the seventh."

Li Xizhi nodded lightly. This matched his expectations quite well. To produce such Dawn Rayfish, nine times out of ten it was indeed due to that heavenly breach. The Dawn Rayfish continued.

"After our breakthrough, we scattered in all directions—east, south, west, and north. I wandered the Eastern Sea for two years before hearing that my eldest brother had become the spiritual beast of Sword Immortal Kufu. Wishing to seek him out, I journeyed all the way to the North Sea."

"Who knew I'd reveal my whereabouts at the North Sea's edge? After chasing and fleeing, running east and west throughout my journey, everyone I encountered would pursue me for hundreds of miles. Finally, I fell into the hands of the dragon clan... leading to today."

Li Xizhi nodded gently and asked.

"A North Sea Sword Immortal?"

"Precisely."

The Dawn Rayfish replied respectfully.

"My lord should have been in this area for some time. Over half a year ago, news came that North Sea's Kufu achieved enlightenment at the Jade Sea's Feather Dissolution Ground, thus gaining sword intent. The North Sea shook, and his fame spread across all four seas!"

Li Xizhi felt somewhat moved, nodding silently as he spoke softly.

"Sword intent... no wonder. What cultivation level is this Sword Immortal?"

"That I don't know..."

The youth shook his head gently, his orange plumage trembling slightly with the movement as he replied respectfully.

"I fear it won't be too high. When those dragon beasts brought me before Lord Heyun, we discussed this matter. They said that nowadays, those who comprehend sword intent are almost all before the Purple Mansion Realm, before divine abilities... I wonder what secrets lie within this."

Li Xizhi nodded lightly. His own ancestor had indeed comprehended sword intent during the Foundation Establishment Realm. He pondered silently.

'Since True Monarch Shangyuan achieved the dao, there should still be three Sword Immortals in Jiangnan, though none show themselves now. Excluding that one from Ten Thousand Radiance Sword Gate`1, the others are in Wu State. Among all the world's Sword Immortals, there probably aren't enough to count on ten fingers.'

He helped the youth to his feet, examined him carefully, and inquired thoroughly. This Dawn Rayfish's cultivation had only just reached the middle Foundation Establishment stage, but his speed was terrifyingly fast. If he exerted full effort, he could probably match a Dawn Cloudliner.

Li Xizhi spoke amiably.

"Since you're the seventh and were sent by Senior, you shall be called Li Qiyun. From now on, we're all family—no need for excessive courtesy."

"This subordinate obeys!"

Li Qiyun bowed in acceptance, quickly producing healing pills to treat his injuries in silence. Li Xizhi sat cross-legged beside the pool in the cave dwelling, quietly staring at the water's surface.

Li Wushao didn't know how this youth had appeared but didn't ask questions, silently closing his eyes to heal. Li Xizhi furrowed his brow.

'At least Dongfang Heyun had no intention of exposing me... Those in the Purple Mansion Realm cannot detect the mysteries of talisman energy. He still wants to use me, probably thinking it's some Purple Mansion Realm master's technique...'

After waiting a moment, Li Wushao asked.

"Young Master, will you be going out again?"

Li Xizhi smiled faintly. Though he felt no fear of the radiance and malevolent energy outside, he still needed to maintain the lie he'd just constructed. He replied.

"I'm feeling somewhat overwhelmed. Let me first neutralize the radiance and malevolent energy within my body and rest for a while before deciding."

The cave immediately fell quiet as everyone focused on cultivation, while the radiance and malevolent energy in the earth channels grew increasingly dense.

Thick radiance and malevolent energy coursed through the earth channels, flickering bright and dim. An elegant youth sat quietly upon a crimson boulder, one pristine hand resting on the other side, gently tapping.

If Li Xizhi were here, he would naturally recognize this person as Dongfang Heyun, who had not departed but remained lingering in this place.

"Such upheaval... West Yan`1 must be fighting someone."

Dongfang Heyun's eyes had lost their playful concealment, appearing more profound and seemingly caught in some dilemma.

"The Dawn Rayfish matter went unnoticed... delivering it to Li Xizhi was perfect timing, sparing this chess piece infiltrating Azure Pond Sect from suffering losses while thinking I only use him."

"It's just that he harbors quite a few secrets... can 'Universal Dawn Mist' truly neutralize radiance and malevolent energy?"

Dongfang Heyun was quite advanced in years. Though this type of spiritual demon maintained a youthful mentality, he had witnessed enough events and studied enough cultivation methods to rival an immortal sect's entire dao repository.

"Azure Pond Sect's 'Universal Dawn Mist'—Lingu Xia practiced it in his time, and it had no neutralizing effects... but Li Xizhi's ancestors were the Wei Li clan, masters of absorbing light and capturing flame. Neutralizing radiance and malevolent energy seems reasonable enough..."

He hesitated for a while. Indeed, he hadn't detected any signs of Li Xizhi using spiritual medicines or techniques—merely sitting cross-legged in meditation. That nagging suspicion finally began to recede. After waiting some time without seeing Li Xizhi emerge, he finally rose and headed deeper into the earth channels, lost in thought.

"Yingze spared Kuaili rather than killing him. Though Lesser Yang is difficult to judge for good or evil, Yingze is no pedantic fool. There must be other considerations."

Dongfang Heyun's figure gradually faded as the thunder above the sea grew louder.

...

Pingya Island.

Li Zhouwei entered the great hall as Chen Yang led three people from a side chamber—two women and one man. The leading woman wore white robes, her expression serene and bearing elegant, clearly indicating noble birth. She spoke softly.

"Jiangbei Shen clan's Shen Yanqing greets the family head."

Shen Yanqing was Daoist Master Zipei's disciple and a legitimate daughter of the Shen family. Her noble status went without saying, and her conduct was quite proper as she nodded toward Li Zhouwei.

The second woman wore yellow feathered robes and was somewhat petite, glancing around with a smile.

"Purple Smoke Gate's Wei Danying greets the family head."

The final man silently bowed, appearing to be a guard of sorts, lowering his head without a word. Li Zhouwei treated the group with reasonable courtesy, speaking gently.

"With distinguished guests gracing us, I failed to welcome you from afar—this is our family's oversight."

After exchanging pleasantries, Shen Yanqing took a seat nearby, offered some compliments, then spoke softly.

"Might I ask where Senior Qinghong is?"

Shen Yanqing had mentioned visiting the Li family long ago, but the northern and southern conflicts had erupted, with fierce battles raging along the river for a long time. Li Zhouwei knew she had come to see Li Qinghong and replied.

"I've already sent someone to request her presence. If Grand-aunt isn't in death-door seclusion, she'll arrive shortly."

Shen Yanqing nodded slightly, chatting about other matters while thinking to herself.

'With Eastern Sea affairs drawing closer, Senior shouldn't be in death-door seclusion.'

She sought conversation topics, speaking softly.

"I originally planned to come with my father to meet your noble clan, but unfortunately, he entered seclusion some days ago to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm and couldn't make the journey."

After chatting briefly, Shen Yanqing noticed that Wei Danying from Purple Smoke Gate beside her hadn't spoken a word and quickly turned to look. Wei Danying was staring straight ahead with a rather complex expression.

'This...'

She discreetly nudged the girl. Wei Danying finally snapped back to attention, lowering her gaze to the tea on the table.

Wei Danying tightened her sleeves, awakening as if from a dream as she pulled her gaze away from the youth at the head seat. Only then did a belated sense of fear arise in her heart.

'Ordinary men must expend considerable effort to attract women... yet he requires no effort at all. He can captivate women with merely a glance. At such a young age, where did he learn this intoxicating demeanor?'

She steadied her mind and looked at the youth again, finding that captivating quality had completely vanished. Breathing a sigh of relief, she sipped her tea, but in that dazed moment, something vicious and aggressively pressing emerged. Wei Danying broke out in cold sweat, terror filling her heart.

'How terrifying! That such a person exists in this world!'



# Chapter 661: Stirring the Waters

After a few words were exchanged, a soft clap of thunder echoed through the air, and a woman strode into the hall. At her entrance, everyone rose to their feet. Shen Yanqing hurried forward and spoke gently. 

“It has been many years, Senior!”

Shen Yanqing was already aware of the grotto-heaven affair, so her smile lacked its usual warmth. Li Qinghong, however, wore a pleasant expression and nodded. 

“It has been some time.”

They ushered her to a seat. Shen Yanqing spoke softly, “Junior should have visited sooner, but I was delayed by various matters. With the chaos in Jiangbei, my family couldn't remain untouched. Now that the situation has stabilized, I came to see you.” 

She retrieved a jade box from her sleeve, placed it gently on the table, and said, “I’ve brought the Celestial Thunder Ritual I mentioned before. My family’s thunder arts originate from the Dao of the Northern Palace of Profound Thunder, one of the twelve great paths of the Zhou Era.”

Li Qinghong listened intently. “I assume the Thunder-Guiding Cloud-Anchoring Dao is not among them?” 

It was no secret that her family practiced the Thunder-Guiding Cloud-Anchoring Dao. Since the teaching came from the Yanyang Temple Palace, it was unlikely to be one of the ancient Zhou Era paths. As expected, Shen Yanqing shook her head. 

“It is not. The Thunder-Guiding Cloud-Anchoring Dao was established in a later age. The twelve thunder palaces were originally orthodoxies that monitored the good and evil of the world, but they have all been annihilated. Most of their teachings are lost, with only a few scattered techniques remaining.”

Beside them, Wei Danying sighed softly. “If the twelve thunder palaces still stood, the world would not have fallen into such a state.” 

Li Qinghong remained silent at her lament, but a strange expression crossed Shen Yanqing’s face. After a moment of hesitation, she replied, “My sect’s teachings hold the thunder palaces in high esteem… but according to the information my family has gathered over the years, the truth may be different.” 

Seeing their puzzled looks, Shen Yanqing lowered her voice. “According to the surviving records, the thunder palaces were tyrannical. Their thunder chariots patrolled the domains, and wherever their envoys passed, thunder would roar, killing thousands…” 

She paused before continuing. “Worse, the thunder palaces controlled the Human Tribulation. They would seek out cultivators on the verge of a breakthrough and strike them down with profound thunder. Surviving the agony was one thing, but those deemed to have heavy sins would lose their lives entirely… The world had long suffered under their yoke.”

“Later, when the lord of the Northern Palace ventured beyond the heavens, a great uproar ensued. From the lofty Purple Mansion cultivators down to the common people, no one wished to endure the oppression of the thunder palaces any longer. Nine of the twelve palaces fell… Cultivators stormed their halls, dragged out the thunder arts, and burned them together. Soon after, their entire tradition vanished without a trace.” 

Li Qinghong listened in silence. Wei Danying, who had only ever heard a completely different version of events within her sect, was visibly shaken. Shen Yanqing sighed. 

“The technique I brought was secretly preserved by a rogue cultivator of that era. In his records, he wrote that the fall of the thunder palaces was met with universal joy. They were called the Twelve Epochs of the Thunder Yoke that had shackled the world’s cultivators and common folk. With their fall came a new age of freedom—to think, to dream, to write, and to speak without fear.”

When she finished, a heavy silence filled the hall. The Li family members had known little about the thunder palaces, so they were less affected. But for Wei Danying, whose beliefs had been deeply ingrained, the revelation was hard to process. “How could this be?” she whispered. “I was only ever told that the thunder palaces patrolled the world and that no one dared to cultivate demonic arts under their watch… How did it become a story of shackling the world?” 

Shen Yanqing hadn’t come to debate the morality of the thunder palaces. Her goal was simply to give Li Qinghong a different perspective. “Just think of it as a rumor,” she said soothingly. 

She turned to Li Qinghong and smiled. “Senior, please take a look.” 

Li Qinghong accepted the jade box and took out the slip within. It did indeed record a celestial thunder ritual, one quite different from her own. In return, Li Qinghong passed over the Secret Primal Art of Purple Thunder. The thunder technique she had obtained from the Green Pine Temple’s grotto-heaven was the Empyrean Cloud Thunder-Questioning Method, which was only a cultivation art. This was the only comparable item she could offer. Shen Yanqing accepted it and said softly, “I hope I might have a chance to discuss the secrets of this art with you in detail, Senior.” 

Li Zhouwei took the hint and invited the others to a side hall, leaving the main hall empty. Shen Yanqing lowered her voice. 

“Senior, I’ve heard that several thunder-cultivating families from the North Sea, the Miao family from the South Sea, and those two Daoists from the East Sea… they are all preparing to head to the East Sea. Have you made arrangements?”

“I am aware,” Li Qinghong said, her expression serious. “I will be leaving soon.” 

“The dragon kin have been planning this for a century, spreading the technique like seeds. They view this matter with extreme importance, so of course, I must go.”

Hearing this, Shen Yanqing sighed inwardly. “Senior… the dragon kin cast a wide net. Many who cultivated the Thunder-Guiding Cloud-Anchoring Dao have perished prematurely, and the dragon kin never made a move. That’s why none of the great families could guess their intentions at first… It was only when traces of the grotto-heaven began to appear that they started to form theories.” 

“But now, you are one of the most outstanding practitioners of this path. You have no choice but to go.”

Seeing Li Qinghong’s calm demeanor, she continued, “My Daoist Master said… there will be another kind of battle inside the grotto-heaven. He urges you not to hold back…” 

Li Qinghong was surprised. “I understand that, of course. In a matter of life and death, how could I hold back?” 

Shen Yanqing said, “That includes Xi Zikang of the North Sea.” 

Li Qinghong’s eyebrows rose. It seemed she truly had no secrets from these Purple Mansion cultivators. Shen Yanqing’s voice was a mere whisper. “His mastery of thunder arts is exceedingly high, second to none among those entering the grotto-heaven. If you can eliminate him, you will remove a major threat.” 

Li Qinghong had some friendship with Xi Zikang. Though she was straightforward, she wasn’t so naive as to miss the meaning behind the Shen family’s—or rather, the Purple Smoke Gate’s—words. She was silent for a moment before speaking. “Ultimately, we must all enter the dragon’s belly. Why must it be like this? I am no fool; I have killed for treasures before… but those were enemies… From what I’ve seen, Xi Zikang is an upright young man who has treated me with warmth. I cannot bring myself to strike him down.” 

Shen Yanqing fell silent as well, then said through gritted teeth, “What if, once inside, life and death are no longer certain?” 

Slowly, Li Qinghong turned her head, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear. Her silence deepened. “So you are asking me to choose,” she said softly. 

Shen Yanqing could only say that she wouldn’t dare presume. A gentle smile touched Li Qinghong’s lips as she shook her head. “If I cannot bring myself to do it, then I suppose I am destined to die.” 

Shen Yanqing pressed her lips together. “Junior understands…” 

She paused, then quickly changed the subject. “My master has already been reincarnated. If any news arises on the lake or within your clan’s territory, please inform us. We will reward you generously!”

Li Qinghong had expected this and nodded in agreement. Shen Yanqing then took her leave, heading to the side hall to rejoin her companions. Only then did Li Qinghong lean back in her chair, lost in thought. 

Her initial interpretation of Shen Yanqing’s words was that the Purple Smoke Gate wanted her to help ambush Xi Zikang before entering the grotto-heaven. But on second thought, that couldn’t be right. 

‘The Thunder-Guiding Cloud-Anchoring Dao has been spread far and wide. If everyone feared being targeted inside and started attacking others beforehand, how could the dragon kin sit idly by? If it were that simple, the Purple Mansion clans like the Miao would have acted long ago.’ 

‘This is a warning. She’s telling me that even if I ally with Xi Zikang… I must be wary. Even if I don’t ambush him, I should expect a confrontation in the end…’

She sat quietly for a time before Li Zhouwei entered from outside. He didn’t press her about her conversation with Shen Yanqing, instead saying gravely, “The time for the Jiangque generation’s first Talisman Seed reception is approaching. Since you have come out of seclusion, my lord, perhaps you would like to observe.” 

“Alright.”

Li Qinghong had become a woman of few words recently, and her reply was concise. 

Azure Pond Sect. 

In the main hall of Azure Pond Peak, magnificent turquoise bricks lined the floor and white mist coiled in the air. A young man leaned against the side of the immortal throne, his cyan robes adorned with shimmering gold patterns. The sword at his waist pulsed with spiritual qi.

His features were not exceptionally handsome, but his expression was full of youthful vigor. Beside the table, a woman in a colorful dress watched him with beautiful eyes.

“Sect Master…”

This was Chi Xunxiao, the young Sect Master of Azure Pond. He was looking down at a document on the table. When the woman spoke, he replied gently, “The recommendation I sent for my second uncle… has he responded?” 

At the mention of Chi Fubo, a flash of resentment crossed the woman’s eyes. “Lord Fubo did not approve it,” she said in a low voice. 

For Chi Xunxiao, a Sect Master, to not only be unable to appoint his own staff but to have a mere recommendation rejected by Chi Fubo was undoubtedly humiliating. Yet, he only smiled faintly. “Very well… It seems I was inconsiderate. Please bring the jade slip back. I will review my uncle’s comments and carefully reconsider before seeking his guidance again.” 

The woman sighed. “Yes, yes…”

Chi Xunxiao glanced at her, a smile in his eyes. “What is troubling you now?” 

“My lord wasn’t even asking for a significant post! Just a few minor positions… and Chi Fubo still refused! On what grounds? Who is the real Sect Master here…” 

She muttered for a moment before Chi Xunxiao shook his head. “I am still too young and often fail to consider things clearly. How can I blame my elder? I understand that Ning Hejing suffered overseas, but you cannot let your personal feelings cloud your judgment.” 

The woman immediately fell silent, wondering to herself, ‘Does he truly not understand, or is he just pretending?’

Just as they finished speaking, a disciple reported that Chi Fubo had arrived to see him. Chi Xunxiao immediately rose to greet him, walking all the way to the front of the hall. “Second Uncle, you’ve come!” he said respectfully. 

Chi Fubo walked in slowly. 

Years of holding power had stripped Chi Fubo of his youthful immaturity, and his expression was much calmer. Chi Xunxiao personally led him to a side seat and arranged the mat for him. “It has been too long, Secod Uncle!” he said with reverence. 

This display of respect was more than enough to satisfy Chi Fubo’s pride, and he found it difficult to maintain a stern face. He smiled. “The plan from a while ago has borne fruit. My agent on Fuchen Peak reports that Li Quantao has become increasingly restless and is venturing out more often… The Li family’s message must have arrived.” 

Chi Xunxiao nodded. “Young Uncle’s insight is profound… There has been no word from the Si Clan. Either the Li Clan cannot contact them… or they have tried and failed.” 

“Si Yuanli would never abandon the Li family,” Chi Fubo stated with conviction. “Don’t be fooled by his cunning and patience. He is merely riding the tide of the situation. His past actions show he possesses a soft heart… He is a sword cultivator, after all, incapable of resorting to any means necessary.” 

“If not for that, Li Xuanfeng and the others would never have persuaded him back then. When you commit to something, you commit. There is no room for heeding others in such a great undertaking… much less is there room for failing to reassure the Li family.”

A hint of joy appeared on Chi Xunxiao’s face. “Could it be… that Daoist Master Si is truly in seclusion, and Si Yuanli is acting on his own?” 

“It probably makes no difference whether he is in seclusion or not… He fears our Daoist Master.”

Chi Fubo took a deep breath, studying him thoughtfully for a moment before waving a hand to take his leave. Chi Xunxiao saw him all the way out of the hall. Chi Fubo smiled as he departed, but his expression grew heavier once he was out of sight. 

He walked with his hands behind his back, a headache brewing. ‘Of all things, he had to be this clever… this courteous… Even I am starting to find this difficult…’

Chi Xunxiao’s behavior had surprised everyone in the sect. The young Sect Master not only publicly supported Chi Fubo and did his utmost to mediate the conflict between the Chi and Ning factions, but he also proved to be an understanding, magnanimous, and wise leader. Over the past few years, his reputation within the sect had soared. 

Chi Fubo saw it all, and the awkwardness was his to bear alone. The recent appearance of Chi Buzhi in the East Sea was another source of mixed feelings. To put it nicely, Chi Buzhi was a Purple Mansion of their clan. To put it bluntly, he was an elder from the First Branch… 

His heart heavy, Chi Fubo forced a smile as he returned to his own hall, where a young man in black robes was waiting for him.

“Yuanqin.”

The plan to install Chi Xunxiao as Sect Master was slowly deviating from its original purpose, showing signs of becoming a very bad idea. But Chi Fubo was a discerning man. He showed no displeasure toward Li Yuanqin, the one who had proposed the scheme, and spoke amicably. “Have the others been giving you trouble?” 

Chi Fubo could see the truth, but not everyone in the Chi family could. The higher Chi Xunxiao’s reputation grew, the more resentful glares Li Yuanqin had to endure, both openly and behind his back. But Li Yuanqin simply replied calmly, “Brother Fubo, I have the information.” 

Chi Fubo understood and led him inside. They sat down at a table, and Li Yuanqin spoke in a low voice. “Ning Hejing has indeed colluded with Buddhist cultivators—a Dharma Master of the Void Path… He plans to scheme against Li Xizhi and Si Yuanli… The baleful light in the Earth Abyss has been thickening these past few days. Li Xizhi won’t be able to hide for much longer. The moment he leaves the abyss, Ning Hejing’s men will be waiting.” 

“The intelligence is limited, but I am certain he has a way to pin the blame on us. Lord Zhihu is still in the East Sea; I suspect he is the intended scapegoat.”

Chi Fubo was silent for a moment. “You mean…” 

“His schemes all lead to one goal: to provoke a complete breakdown between our clan and the Si Clan so that he can reap the rewards. That can only be achieved with bloodshed. Even if we can’t guess his exact method, it requires the death of either Li Xizhi, Si Yuanli, or Lord Zhihu.” 

Chi Fubo’s silence deepened, a chill creeping into his heart. ‘Ning Hejing alone couldn’t stir up such a storm! I fear some other Purple Mansion experts, unhappy to see the Chi and Si Daoist Masters staying out of the fray, are secretly fanning the flames to worsen their relationship.’ 

Li Yuanqin stared at him intently. “Yuanqin thinks the same. But it is precisely because a Purple Mansion expert is providing cover that even if Si Boxiu isn’t in seclusion, he would most likely be unable to divine this matter!” 

Chi Fubo narrowed his eyes. “What do you propose we do?” 

“Li Xizhi is difficult to kill, and any move against Si Yuanli would likely be detected. They will probably target Lord Zhihu first…” 

Chi Fubo’s expression did not change. “Oh? Should I recall him then?” 

Li Yuanqin shook his head. “In my view, it would be best to let Lord Zhihu die. We will wait quietly on the sidelines. The moment he is dead, we strike, capture Li Xizhi, and lock him away in the sect!” 

His tone was ice-cold. “As long as we frame him perfectly, the Daoist Master will have no grounds to object! We can use this to force Si Yuanli to hand over those positions he has been withholding, and then we release him from the sect!” 

Hearing the plan to sacrifice his own grand-uncle, Chi Fubo actually smiled slightly. “And what if he refuses?” 

Li Yuanqin replied respectfully, “Then the Li family will have no choice but to seek refuge with us to save Li Xizhi’s life. The remaining Ning family members will be ours for the taking, will they not?” 

“Excellent, excellent.”

Chi Fubo’s smile widened as he stared intently at him. “Since this plot is so well-concealed that it can even deceive Si Boxiu while he is in seclusion… a Purple Mansion expert must be involved…” 

“So how did you find out?”



# Chapter 662: The Whole Pill Dao

Li Yuanqin clasped his hands, his voice low.

"Brother Fubo, you may not be aware," he began, "but that Eastern Yue barbarian, Fei Luoya, though ostensibly one of the Ning family's people and claiming our Li Clan seized his territory, still holds some lingering loyalty to my father. He deliberately revealed his whereabouts to me in private..."

He recounted the sequence of events that had led to his discovery, presenting his case in a clear, logical manner. Each point was supported by evidence. A smile of dawning comprehension spread across Chi Fubo's face, but inwardly, he remained unconvinced. After hearing the full story, Li Yuanqin added softly, "There are still those among the Purple Mansion cultivators who are friendly to our cause... and Daoist Master Changxiao is a master of such schemes. Who's to say this wasn't his intention?"

Only then did a thoughtful expression flicker in Chi Fubo's eyes.

"Ultimately," Li Yuanqin concluded, "it's likely that one of the Purple Mansion masters used this situation to send me a signal, hoping we would intervene and deal a blow to the Si family."

"The situation is still developing, and many details remain unconfirmed. I will leave the final decision to you, Brother Fubo!"

He bowed and retreated. Chi Fubo nodded, watching him go before turning back to his desk.

'This is not a simple matter,' he thought, a knot of anxiety tightening in his gut. 'I fear it's a trap. And even if it isn't... why would Si Yuanli possibly concede? No matter how you look at it... Yuanqin is still maneuvering to take control of the Li Family...'

A wave of frustration washed over Chi Fubo. He couldn't bring himself to blame Li Yuanqin, though. It wasn't just him. The elders, like Chi Zhihu, and even many of Chi Fubo's own siblings were itching for action. He alone had been holding them back.

"It's far too soon."

Chi Fubo had reached a point where he could no longer satisfy the ambitions of those around him. Yet people like Li Yuanqin and Chi Zhihu were growing impatient.

'It's like a wild horse breaking its reins. If I can't stop it, I'll be the one thrown into the abyss and dashed to pieces!'

Li Yuanqin's proposal had starkly illuminated his precarious position, and a chill crept into his heart.

"I have read countless classics and always found my predecessors to be reckless, foolish, and impulsive. Now, acting myself, I find my hands are tied at every turn. Perhaps they acted not out of choice, but out of necessity."

Panic began to set in. He downed several cups of wine, but the image of Chi Xunxiao surfaced in his mind. His grip tightened on the jade cup, a bitter resentment rising within him.

"What terrible luck... Why did he have to be such a clever child! If only he'd feigned stupidity, or truly been a fool, I wouldn't be in this wretched position."

***

Pingya Island.

The golden light of dawn scattered across the lake's surface. Li Zhouwei rode the wind south until he reached the territory of Lijing Prefecture. The buildings here, clustered around the lake, were the oldest, with walls of gray brick and roofs of dark tile. The disciples who once filled the alleys were long gone, but several of the large stone houses were still maintained.

Sunlight dappled the stone steps as Li Zhouwei entered one of the houses, with the monk Kongheng following behind. In the center of a courtyard, a pool of water lay perfectly clear. He continued through to the rear hall, the clanking of chains echoing from within.

*Clang...*

The rear hall was a grim chamber of iron cells. The faint bleating of a goat could be heard. As Li Zhouwei stepped inside, he saw a completely naked boy kneeling on the floor. His face was covered in white scales as he sucked greedily at the neck of a fallen goat, whose cries were growing weaker.

Li Zhouwei watched his son, his expression unreadable. He stood in silence for a long time as the boy tore into the goat, devouring it raw. Kongheng, unable to bear the sight, closed his eyes and began chanting sutras.

The day after achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm , Li Zhouwei had come here with Kongheng to see his eldest son. They had examined him thoroughly but were utterly powerless to help.

Li Jiang'ao was not afflicted by some illusion that clouded his mind, nor was his soul disturbed. He simply lacked the consciousness of a normal person. There was no cure. Perhaps, after several hundred years of cultivation, he might develop a rudimentary, beast-like awareness.

'Look at him now. He can't even learn to read. How could he possibly accept a Talisman Seed?'

Li Zhouwei had even considered finding a remote mountain or a vast lake and releasing him to live on his own. But there were too many risks, too many taboos. He could not let him go. And so, year after year, he kept his firstborn son locked away in this cage, visited only by himself or Li Xuanxuan.

'Jiang'ao is like a beast. Jiangqian, though intelligent, has an extreme and deceitful nature... I fear none of my sons are of good character.'

Li Zhouwei's third sonpublicly his secondhad been born a few days ago. He was named Li Jianglong, and he too possessed golden eyes. But this time, Li Zhouwei felt little joy. He had only to look around to see that another of his consorts was already with child.

"Venerable Master," he said, turning.

Kongheng immediately looked over.

"You previously mentioned a method of suppression using the Supreme Yin ," Li Zhouwei said quietly. "I was wondering if we might try it, to see if I can sire a child *without* the golden eyes... I have heard that the sons of the Undefeated King of Brightness were all demons who were eventually subjugated. My children's eyes are like mine. If their fortune and virtue are shallow, I fear it will bring them ruin."

Kongheng gave him a thoughtful look and replied softly, "This humble monk will do his best to try."

Li Zhouwei nodded. He cast one last look at his eldest sonthe child in whom he had placed so many hopes while he was still in the wombthen turned and walked away. As he ascended the stone steps, the last glimmer of hope in his heart died.

He rode the wind back to the main hall on the island, where Kongheng discreetly took his leave. Li Qinghong and Li Xuanxuan were waiting inside. Seeing him arrive empty-handed, Li Qinghong flicked her sleeve, releasing the [Chongming Profound Insight Screen] to conceal the room.

"Where is Jiang'ao?" she asked gently.

For this round of bestowing the Talisman Seed, Li Xuanxuan had thought to let Li Jiang'ao participate, hoping some opportunity might arise for him even if he couldn't recite the incantations. But Li Zhouwei had returned alone.

"He is completely devoid of intellect," Li Zhouwei said gravely. "I fear he would only disturb the sacred treasure. It is best to forget it."

Seeing his resolve, Li Qinghong could only nod. "How many children are ready to receive a Talisman Seed this time?"

Li Zhouwei paused. "Quite a few, I'm afraid."

There were not many cultivators in the Zhou generation of the Li Clan, and only two who were having children. But after generations of accumulation, the number of mortals in the Zhou generation was vast. As a result, there was no shortage of children with spiritual apertures in the Jiangque generation. Their talents, however, had not yet manifested, making it impossible to distinguish between them.

Gathering all of them in the hall, teaching them the incantations one by one, and testing them individually was no longer as simple as it once had been. Moreover, as the clan grew in size and prominence, any large-scale activity risked attracting spies.

Li Xuanxuan voiced these concerns, and Li Zhouwei replied, "Now that the Immortal Mirror's spirit roams the Great Void, we can try altering the prayer. It might allow for a more discreet process."

***

The Great Void.

Lu Jiangxian's divine consciousness drifted, lingering for a long time over the lands of the Purple Smoke Gate.

Ever since he had gained the ability to roam the Great Void, he had made it a point to never probe directly into the headquarters of any immortal sect, preferring to observe from a distance. The breakthrough of the Purple Smoke Gate's new Purple Mansion cultivator was the most detailed and complete event of its kind he had witnessed.

He had even seen the agent from the underworld from afar and overheard their entire conversation.

'Daoist Master Zipei is dead.'

Contrary to the speculation of many Purple Mansion masters, Daoist Master Zipei, Kan Xuyu, was truly goneher soul scattered, with no chance of reincarnation.

'The Shen Clan and the Purple Smoke Gate are sending people everywhere to search for Zipei's reincarnation. It must be a bluff...'

After all, Zipei had been a formidable figure. Having a powerful cultivator with a metallic essence supposedly reincarnated and at large was a useful deterrent for both the Shen Clan and the Purple Smoke Gate.

"And the other peak Purple Mansion master, Daoist Master Zimu, vanished long ago. The Purple Smoke Gate has to resort to some trickery to maintain its standing."

But Lu Jiangxian had watched the entire ritual performed by the underworld agent and was certain that the 'True Qi' of the metallic essence had never appeared. This meant Daoist Master Zipei had never used it at all.

'Such a treasure... where could it be?'

With no immediate leads, Lu Jiangxian set the matter aside for now, making a mental note to remain vigilant. Another matter, however, came to mind.

'The dragons consuming lightning...'

He had been keeping a close eye on this phenomenon. He had even been present when Dongfang Heyun met Li Xizhi in the Eastern Sea. His Supreme Yin Profound Light had been aimed at the spirit cloud the entire time; had the dragon monarch made a move, Lu Jiangxian would have killed him without hesitation.

Though nothing had come of it, he was left with many questions.

'It's truly strange. Dongfang Heyun seems to have a favorable impression of Li Xizhi, and he has always been polite to Li Xuanfeng. Where does this come from? And that dragon child, Dingjiao, fawns over Li Zhouwei... It seems the entire dragon lineage is fond of the Li Clan.'

'Could it really be because of Emperor Gong of Wei?'

Lu Jiangxian didn't believe a word of Dingjiao's story. The Li Clan had seen its share of ups and downs. If the dragons truly had such a deep friendship with the Wei Li, protecting a few branches of the clan would have been a trivial matter for them.

He made a circuit of the Great Void, confirming that no Purple Mansion or Golden Core masters were spying on him, before returning to his perch on Mount Wu. Inside the grand array, he watched for a time as Li Ximing practiced the secret art, Jewel Steps.

"We of the Moongaze Li Clan, with reverence and offerings of pure wine, fine foods, and sacrificial meats, do humbly petition for the Profound Light for our descendants, that their fates may be settled and their spirits calmed for the path of cultivation... May their merits be proclaimed in due time, their faith rewarded, and upon the burning of this talisman, may their mortal selves be given unto the Supreme Yin."

The words from the mortal world reached his ears, and his consciousness snapped back from the Great Void to the lake below. On Pingya Island, within a hall shrouded by a screen of light, the prayer was being chanted, though no figures could be seen.

Lu Jiangxian accessed the records of his divine consciousness, instantly understood the situation, and swept his awareness across the lake region. A sense of relief washed over him.

'I've waited so long. The Jiangque generation is finally ready. I can bestow those Purple Mansion cultivation arts...'

Among the many techniques at his disposal, Lu Jiangxian was most partial to those of the 'Whole Pill Dao'. The *Golden Book of Houshu* was a true sixth-grade cultivation art, a full grade higher than the Li Clan's own *Radiant Essence Scripture*!

'The *Radiant Essence Scripture* is such an anomaly...'

It possessed a full nine secret arts, yet was only rated at the basic fifth-grade level for a Purple Mansion technique. Out in the wider world, this would be nonsensical. How could a technique with nine secret arts be a mere fifth-grade art? Only Lu Jiangxian, cheating with his immortal methods and metallic essence, could have written such a thing.

When it came to the secret arts for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, the *Golden Book of Houshu* was naturally inferior to the *Radiant Origin Scripture*, which was born of the Bright Yang golden nature and immortal formulas. But it was by no means weak. It had five secret arts, and mastering them all would increase one's chances of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm by a full twenty-five percent.

'Furthermore, the Whole Pill Dao belongs to the Ancient Merging Dao lineage. While not excelling in combat, its practitioners can achieve feats far beyond those of cultivators at the same level. And what of a cultivator trained in a sixth-grade art?'

Whether in transformation, healing, array-breaking, or stealth, the  Whole Pill Dao was far superior to contemporary magical arts. Qiushui of the Golden Feather Sect was a practitioner of this path, and her divine abilities were so profound that she commanded universal respect.

The only drawback was that the technique was rather conspicuous. Fortunately, by the time a descendant could cultivate it to a significant level, the Li Clan would have its own Purple Mansion masters, making it much easier to conceal its origins.

'As for who shall receive the Talisman Seed...'

'The elder brother is fierce, the second is evil. Li Jiangqian's talent is undeniable, so he must receive a Talisman Seed to restrain this vicious beast. If I don't give him one, he will surely cause a great disaster in the future!'

Even in an empire as vast as the Wei, with multiple Golden Core masters presiding, bloodshed still stained the palace courts. How could Lu Jiangxian not take precautions? He had long ago designated a Talisman Seed for Li Jiangqian, a tightening hoop for this monster.

'The  Whole Pill art... I have already considered it, and he is not suitable. Nor should he cultivate the Bright Yang art any further. I fear it would only make him more wicked. One day, he might achieve a sudden epiphany, see through the follies of the mortal world, and a red-eyed white cicada would burst from his chest... and take flight. That would be no laughing matter...'

This was no idle fancy on Lu Jiangxian's part; it was a very real possibility. As Li Zhouwei's cultivation grew, eventually breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, the influence on his second son, Li Jiangqian, would become ever more profound.

His eldest son, Li Jiang'ao, was a lesser concern for now. Lacking intellect, he couldn't cultivate, and any changes in his condition would be centuries away.

With the lessons of the Wei kingdom fresh in his mind, Lu Jiangxian paid extremely close attention to the brothers Li Jiang'ao and Li Jiangqian, having considered every possibility since the day they were born.

'It would be best to give him this 'Li Fire' technique I obtained from the grotto-heaven. It is a sixth-grade art of Li Fire. Bright Yang and Li Fire are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Nothing could be more suitable!'

The full name of this sixth-grade cultivation art was the *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun*. Its foundational stage was the 'Great Parting Scripture'. The fact that Anhuai Heaven had seen fit to include it in their collection was a testament to its power and quality.

'It has four secret arts, increasing one's chances by twenty percent. That's better than the vast majority of Purple Mansion techniques in the Jiangnan region.'

He embedded the *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun* into the Talisman Seed destined for Li Jiangqian, but did not bestow it immediately.

His divine consciousness roamed, circling the shores of the lake until it found a particular household in Lijing Town, a place he remembered from his past.

The house was not small; its ancestors had clearly known prosperity. But now, the red lacquer on the gates was almost completely peeled away, revealing the mottled brown wood beneath. The two stone lions at the entrance were covered in dust, obviously untouched for a long time.

Despite its faded glory, the household was clearly run with an iron fist. Everything was neat and orderly, a sign that the master of the house held himself to an exacting standard.

Lu Jiangxian's consciousness flew through the gates and into the main courtyard, where he found a young girl. With red lips and fair skin, dressed in a traditional blouse and skirt, she looked to be about six or seven years old.

'The timing is perfect.'

This child was the one Lu Jiangxian had chosen to receive the Talisman Seed, the one selected to cultivate the  Whole Pill art! He had taken notice of her on the day she was born and had simply been waiting for the Li Clan to conduct their ritual.

And in his divine sight, he could see a spiritual aperture slowly forming at the center of her brow, like a third eye, subtly drawing in the spiritual energy of the world. Lu Jiangxian praised inwardly:

'With her aperture at her brow, her soul is far stronger than a normal person's. At last, a child has appeared who can cultivate the *Shamanic Talisman Dao*... She is the perfect match for this sixth-grade *Golden Book of Houshu*... The ancient Whole Pill Dao has an affinity with shamanistic arts. It could not be a better fit!'



# Chapter 663: Two Talisman Seeds

As Li Zhouwei finished his prayer, a clear light suffused the hall. Plumes of white mist churned within the Chongming Profund Insight Screen, and from the void, two points of white light emerged. They spun once before blossoming into two white flowers, which hovered in the air as golden characters materialized beneath them.

One read:

"Li Jiangqian."

The other:

"Li Shuwan."

Li Zhouwei and the others gave their thanks. He raised an eyebrow, glancing over at Li Qinghong, and saw a flicker of shock on her face. As the two white flowers drifted down, she immediately reached out and caught them.

"Two Talisman Seeds..."

The name Li Jiangqian brought a sense of relief, but the second name was completely unfamiliar. The three of them froze, puzzled. Only Li Xuanxuan seemed to be searching his memory.

Li Qinghong's expression was complicated. Li Xuanxuan, his brow deeply furrowed, had already retrieved a jade slip from his storage pouch to consult it. The old man was sentimental and often worried about which family lines were dying out and which branches could be used to continue them. As such, he kept the clan's annual registers on hand.

After a pause of two full breaths, a look of realization dawned on Li Xuanxuan’s face. "So, she is one of my descendants," he said. "Quite a distant one... from a minor branch now."

He let out a hearty laugh, turned the jade slip over, and handed it to the other two. "This couldn't be better!" he whispered.

Li Qinghong breathed a sigh of relief. She took the jade slip and scanned it, quickly finding Li Shuwan's name. As she traced the lineage upward, her brow furrowed again. "Li Yesheng... Li Xiewen... Li Pingyi... Hmm? Isn't this from Uncle Xiewen's line? Grand-Uncle, are you sure you're reading this right?"

At the mention of this, a flash of pain crossed Li Xuanxuan's eyes. "This matter," he began softly, "goes back to your eldest brother."

Li Qinghong's eyebrows shot up. "Brother Yuanxiu?" she murmured.

Li Xuanxuan sat down nearby, gathering his thoughts before speaking. "Uncle Yesheng didn't have many children, and Xiewen was the main heir. The others were no good. They opened a gambling den and got involved in debauchery. Your brother caught them, killed one, branded the rest, and banished them from the town. They were struck from the clan records, leaving only Xiewen..."

"Xiewen had three daughters and one son, Li Pingyi. At a young age, he..." Decades had passed, but Li Xuanxuan's voice still choked with emotion as he spoke of it. "He took his own life out of guilt over the Yu family's thunder-fire incident... and so the line was broken."

"With no heir and his brothers exiled for their crimes, Xiewen was left alone. For old times' sake, I had my seventh grandson's second son, who was a mortal and already part of a minor branch, adopted into his line. Since both were minor branches, it made little difference..."

"I see..." Li Qinghong fell silent for a moment. "Well," she said softly, "now that the line has produced a child with spiritual aptitude, it's time to welcome them back into the main clan."

Li Zhouwei listened quietly from the side. Li Xuanxuan said, "I'll go bring her back right away."

Li Qinghong smiled and nodded. "Let me go. This shouldn't be delayed. By my calculations... she's only six. We shouldn't draw any unwanted attention. I'll go under the cover of night and see what this little girl is like."

Li Zhouwei agreed. "I'll bring Jiangqian here."

In an instant, Li Qinghong vanished from the great hall. Li Xuanxuan picked up the two white flowers, not daring to touch them directly. He levitated them with his spiritual qi, his spiritual sense gently probing them.

The flowers each had twelve pure white petals. Inside, the pistils flickered like phantoms of light, shimmering in and out of focus. They emitted a rich, sweet scent of osmanthus, which invigorated the old man. He looked up and asked, "Minghuang, do you know what these are?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head. Sensing the incredibly dense Supreme Yin power within the blossoms, he took out two jade boxes and placed the flowers inside. "I'm afraid this is another long-extinct spiritual treasure," he said softly. "When I have the chance, I will seek out ancient records from the dragon or fox clans to try and identify them."

The Li family possessed other Supreme Yin treasures. Years ago, when Yu Muxian visited the lake, the Immortal Mirror had stirred, causing a branch of osmanthus and a white flower to fall. Li Yuanjiao had carefully preserved them, but even with the clan's best methods, the items couldn't be perfectly maintained and had been fading year by year.

A small portion had been used to supplement Li Wushao's life-source, but the rest had completely dissipated over the decades. Li Zhouwei sealed the boxes carefully. "They seem difficult to preserve," he murmured. "They may be treasures that cannot be exposed to the world. If we can't identify them, or if we do and find they are too precious, it would be better to use them. Elder White Ape suffered many grievous injuries in his youth. Using these two items to fortify his life-source should be enough to restore his foundations."

"Mm..." Li Xuanxuan cared deeply for his old brother-in-arms, but he couldn't help but cringe at the thought. To a Supreme Yin lineage like the Chunyi Dao Gate, these flowers were likely countless times more precious than a Radiant Sky Stone.

'Our family is using them to supplement a life-source... It's like using Supreme Yin moon essence to practice the Xuanjing Wheel technique...' The old man didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Still, he turned the jade boxes over and over in his hands before carefully tucking them away.

***

Lijing Prefecture, Lichuan Entrance.

The night wind was chilly. Rain dripped from the low-hanging branches of the loquat tree in the courtyard. Li Baotuo, shivering from the cold, pulled on two extra layers of clothing. In the yard, a group of children were laughing together.

"What's all the racket!" he grumbled, buttoning his coat as he pushed the door open. He rubbed his hands together. The weather was indeed growing colder by the day, but Li Baotuo's heart burned like hot coals.

'Heaven be praised... after generations of mortals, we finally have a cultivator...' The day before, his daughter, Li Shuwan, had managed to condense a wisp of spiritual energy after reading a cultivation manual distributed by the clan. The achievement had sent Li Baotuo into a state of sheer ecstasy.

Li Baotuo's line had never produced a cultivator, so they were far down the list for the clan's spiritual aptitude assessment. There were far too many mortal families like his, and countless six-year-old children. It was impossible to check them all individually. The usual practice was to hand out a copy of the most common Embryonic Breathing technique for families to test on their own.

Li Baotuo's ancestors had seen better days, and they weren't lacking for such a basic manual. The moment Li Shuwan turned six, he hadn't even bothered to queue up, simply retrieving their own copy to let her try. The result nearly made him faint with joy.

"Shuyuan!" His face broke into a wide smile as he saw his daughter approach. Once all his children were seated at the table, he assumed a serious posture and announced, "This is a matter of great importance. I have gone to see Clan Uncle Chengzhi... and asked him to find a cultivator to assess Shuyuan! By my reckoning, they should be arriving soon. Everyone be on your best behavior."

Li Shuwan propped her chin on the table, her eyes darting to the meatballs in her bowl. A meal like this was a rare treat.

The past glory of Li Baotuo's ancestors was just that—in the past. Their current life was quite meager. They had a large house, but anything of value had been sold off by previous generations. If they sold the house itself, they would have nothing left.

The entire family depended on the few boats Li Baotuo and his eldest son operated on the lake. It was a permissible livelihood, and when the Clan Justice Hall occasionally came to inspect, Li Baotuo naturally had a clear conscience.

'But how can that compare to cultivation?' To put it bluntly, if Li Shuwan's talent was sufficient, the entire family could move onto the lake. The stipend they would receive would be more than enough to live out the rest of their days in peace and comfort.

'As for Shuyuan... after decades of cultivation, when she comes back to see us, she probably won't even recognize us.' That's what the operas always said. Li Baotuo had heard plenty of rumors about how cultivators lived in a world apart. He figured he wouldn't see much of his daughter for the rest of his life. The thought filled him with both pride and a touch of sorrow.

Li Baotuo quickly pushed the feeling aside and began discussing with his sons how to set the table and notify their relatives for a proper banquet. Now that Li Shuwan had spiritual aptitude, everyone—those who had looked down on them and those who hadn't—would come bearing smiles. The nearby cultivator branches would even send representatives. This was the time to build connections for his daughter.

He waited for a while, his anxiety mounting, until he finally heard a call from outside the courtyard. "My dear nephew! I've brought the Guest Elder!"

Li Baotuo shot up from his seat. His sons scrambled to their feet and followed him in a rush to the front of the courtyard. "Greetings to you, honored elders!" they chorused.

The man in the lead was his clan uncle, Li Chengzhi. Though a mortal, his bloodline was prestigious. Li Baotuo's ancestor and his had been as close as brothers, and Li Baotuo had even met him as a child. "Clan Uncle, it has been too long!" he exclaimed. "This nephew has missed you dearly!"

Li Chengzhi laughed heartily. He was a shrewd man who knew how to curry favor. As the son of Li Ximing, even as a mortal, he had managed to befriend many cultivators. He had a good impression of Li Baotuo and had immediately brought a cultivator over.

He gestured to the old man in brown robes beside him. "This is Guest Elder Hu! A high master of the Qi Refinement Realm!"

"Qi Refinement!" Li Baotuo was stunned. He wasn't entirely ignorant; he knew that such figures held positions of power on the prefecture peak. That Li Chengzhi could bring such a person here thrilled him. "Greetings, Senior!" he said deferentially. "My home is humble... please forgive its simplicity!"

Guest Elder Hu was perfectly courteous to Li Chengzhi, but not so much to someone like Li Baotuo, whose branch had been reduced to a minor mortal line for who knew how many years. For Li Chengzhi's sake, he gave a slight nod. "No need for formalities."

Li Baotuo didn't take offense. He nodded repeatedly, leading them into the courtyard. He caught Li Chengzhi's meaningful gaze and instantly understood. 'He's helping me find a patron for Shuyuan!'

'But... is this appropriate?' If Li Baotuo had been from an ordinary minor branch, he would have shamelessly seized the opportunity. But he had inherited some knowledge of the clan's affairs and knew that the sixteen prefectures were not a place of perfect harmony.

'This is Lijing Prefecture... the territory of the old four families. If we're going to align with anyone, it should be one of them. I don't even know which prefecture this cultivator Hu is from. Getting involved with him... we might offend the four families...'

Besides, Li Baotuo knew his own situation. While his line appeared to be an ordinary minor branch, they were actually an offshoot from the main clan via adoption. If one of their descendants proved to be exceptional, they might even have a chance to return to the main clan. If so, there was no need to get entangled in factional rivalries!

A thousand thoughts raced through his mind. He pulled his daughter forward with a smile. "Shuyuan! Greet the two seniors!"

Li Shuwan tilted her head to look. She noticed six points of light flickering around the man in brown robes, and a chaotic swirl of energy surrounded him. It was slightly different from the people she had seen flying in the sky before, and she couldn't help but stare.

Guest Elder Hu, however, merely glanced at her briefly before nodding and striding past. 'Li Baotuo's family has been mortals for generations,' he thought with an inward sigh. 'How good can the talent of their first cultivator possibly be? Li Chengzhi wants me to offer some guidance... what a hassle.'

He put on an air of importance, his eyes sweeping over the table. Finding nothing to his liking, he said coolly, "Tea will suffice."

The elaborate feast Li Baotuo had prepared went untouched. Wiping sweat from his brow, he ushered the guest into the inner hall and seated him. At first, Guest Elder Hu deigned to respond when Li Chengzhi spoke, but the moment Li Baotuo opened his mouth, the man in brown fell silent, staring at the floor.

Even a fool could see Guest Elder Hu's disdain. The food on the table grew cold. Li Baotuo's wife stood helplessly at the back of the hall. In the end, what could a mortal like Li Baotuo possibly have to talk about with a cultivator? He was so embarrassed he couldn't speak.

Though she was only six, Li Shuwan saw it all, and her heart ached. "Father, I'll be going now," she said softly.

Li Baotuo let out a breath, about to stop her, but Li Chengzhi cheerfully let her go. After she had left, Guest Elder Hu, sensing Li Chengzhi's displeasure, asked casually, "How long did it take your esteemed daughter to condense her first wisp of spiritual energy?"

Li Baotuo felt his awkwardness ease slightly. "About two hours, I believe," he whispered.

Guest Elder Hu stared, then saw Li Baotuo's clueless expression. A wave of shock crashed through him. 'What?'

While the adults talked in the hall, Li Shuwan wandered into the back courtyard. A few loquat trees stood in the overgrown yard. As she walked, she remembered the helpless looks on her parents' faces and couldn't stop herself from wiping away a tear.

"This guy..." She took a few more steps and nearly collided with someone standing in the courtyard, making her jump.

"Ah..." Li Shuwan gasped, but her fear was instantly replaced by fascination. Her eyes were glued to the woman before her, completely unable to look away.

The woman wore a long robe of elegant feathers. Her black hair was coiled up, adorned with a small, simple white flower pin. The hem of her cyan-patterned skirt pulsed with faint points of purple light. Her eyes, hazy with a purple shimmer, looked down at her with a warm smile.

"You..." Li Shuwan was so stunned she couldn't speak. The woman reached out and naturally stroked her cheek, letting out a soft laugh. Her voice was clear and pleasant. "Li Shuwan?"

"Yes..." Li Shuwan nervously clasped her hands behind her back. She knew this person had to be a cultivator and didn't dare move. She snuck a peek and noticed that this woman didn't have the six points of light like the other man, only a rippling expanse of purple.

The celestial-looking woman nodded, her purple eyes glancing past the girl toward the courtyard gate. Her tone grew cold. "This Hu Jingye... he certainly plays his cards well. The moment he sees your extraordinary talent, he starts with threats and promises, trying to betroth you to his youngest son..."

It was strange. The woman in white had merely stopped smiling and added a chill to her voice, but her entire aura had transformed. An awe-inspiring authority settled on her features, and in the clouds above, thunder seemed to rumble and roll.

Li Shuwan looked up and thought she saw a faint purple tinge to the clouds. She quickly whispered, "But my father said he's very powerful... a big shot from the prefecture peak..."

The woman was taken aback by her words, and the coldness on her face vanished instantly. She had almond-shaped eyes that seemed to melt like ice in the spring wind. She let out a clear, bright laugh. "A big shot, indeed!"



# Chapter 664: The Jiangque Generation Receives a Talisman

"About two hours? For your child?" Guest Elder Hu chuckled, inwardly mocking the man’s ignorance of cultivation. "Ha! Do you think she's the clan heir or a prodigy like An Jingming?"

He suppressed his laughter and adopted a more serious tone. "I'll ask you just one thing. From the moment you gave her the cultivation manual to the moment she claimed to have produced her first wisp of spiritual energy, how much time passed?"

Li Baotuo paused, thinking for a moment before answering, "Honored elder, it was two days and one night."

"Two days and a night!"

At this, Li Chengzhi, who had been listening quietly, finally sat up straight, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. "Though Lijing is the ancestral seat of a prominent family, its spirit vein ranks among the lowest of the nine prefectures," he murmured. To achieve that in two days and a night… that's quite a high aptitude!"

He left the rest unsaid, but a thought sparked in his mind. 'If she had enough resources, she might have a shot at being selected to return to the main island in five years. And if Li Baotuo can raise a disciple of the main sect… that would be a solid connection for me on the island!'

As Li Chengzhi’s mind raced with possibilities, Hu Jingye was just as quick on the uptake, already thinking of his own son. "Oh?" he said, his voice now carefully neutral. "Her talent is acceptable."

Hu Jingye was a mere Qi Refinement cultivator, but his young son showed some promise. If Li Shuwan could become a cultivator of the main sect, it would be an incredible boon for him. He adopted a stately posture. "It's difficult for your daughter to return to the island, but her talent is quite good for the surrounding prefectures…"

His tone had softened considerably, but fearing Li Baotuo would see his intentions, he kept his expression stern. "Chengzhi is here, so we're all family. I won't mince words. When Shuwan's talent is reported, the clan will provide corresponding resources and techniques… but there's still a gap to overcome to return to the island. I can help bridge that gap… It will all depend on her effort."

He maintained his dignified air, the shift in his attitude mostly seamless. But Li Baotuo had received some education in his youth and had seen much of the world from his ferry on the river. He understood immediately.

'Damn it, the old fox changed his tune fast,' he thought. 'My Shuwan's talent must be truly high. What an act.'

Outwardly, he simply beamed, the picture of a simple, honest farmer. He nodded and agreed with a series of smiles but gave no concrete answer. Seeing him play dumb, Hu Jingye didn't shy away and stated his purpose directly.

"My youngest son is eight this year and also has decent talent. If you wouldn't mind, Baotuo, do me this favor and let's arrange a childhood betrothal. I have some savings that can support Shuwan's cultivation, and I will personally see to it that your family returns to the island."

He was, after all, a Qi Refinement cultivator. Before him, the other two were no more than ants. For him to lower himself like this put both Li Chengzhi and Li Baotuo in an awkward position.

Li Baotuo glanced at Li Chengzhi, who grimaced in frustration. The terms weren't exactly predatory, so it was difficult for him to object. He hesitated, taking a sip of tea. The clan rules were strict, and the direct line feared nothing more than being accused of "bullying others with power." Li Chengzhi was always polite to everyone, and his relationship with Hu Jingye depended entirely on the elder giving him face—face as thin as paper. He couldn't risk tearing it.

Seeing no help from his clan uncle, Li Baotuo resorted to stalling tactics. "I… I know nothing about this 'returning to the island'… I fear wasting your lordship's resources. How could I agree so rashly? My daughter is still playful and young, I'm afraid she might…"

"What are you saying, Baotuo!" Hu Jingye frowned. "My Hu family may not be one of the old Four Surnames, but we have a reputation in Wutu Prefecture. When I say I will provide resources, I will. You needn't worry."

Seeing Li Baotuo lower his head, he took a step back. "I'm not trying to pressure you. We can settle this for now. If things change in the future, if Shuwan has other ideas… it's only an engagement. At worst, we can dissolve it. The friendship between our families will remain, won't it? By then, Shuwan will be a disciple of the main sect. Do you think she'll have trouble breaking off a minor engagement?"

'This is bad!'

As he spoke, Li Chengzhi saw a flicker of consideration in Li Baotuo's eyes. His heart sank.

'It's not that simple!'

As a disciple of the main sect himself, Li Chengzhi knew how strict the Clan Justice Hall was. If Li Shuwan were to break the engagement later, she would be in the wrong. It would reflect poorly on her and greatly affect the Hu family. Her reputation would suffer, and word might even reach Qingdu Peak… Who knew what the elders would think upon hearing of such a thing!

Li Baotuo remained silent. Li Chengzhi couldn't sit still any longer. He averted his gaze, frowning at a distant corner of the room to signal his disapproval.

"My lord… my family is truly unworthy of such an honor!"

Whether he understood the signal or had never intended to agree, Li Baotuo finally sighed and shook his head, making his decision clear. The words struck Li Chengzhi with a mix of shock and relief, while the smile vanished from Guest Elder Hu's face. For a long moment, there was silence.

The rejection was a resounding slap in the face. Hu Jingye could no longer maintain his composure. His expression darkened, and he shot to his feet.

"You invited me here to see your daughter, and now that I have, you treat me with contempt! Is this how you conduct yourself? It’s completely unreasonable!" he boomed. "I, Hu Jingye, have cultivated for years between Wutu and Lijing. Who doesn't give me some measure of respect? Li Baotuo, you are utterly insolent!"

Li Baotuo had not expected such a sharp tongue. Flustered, he scrambled to his feet. "I invited you to see my daughter, my lord, but I never imagined you would demand a marriage arrangement on the spot! I may be a mortal, but I love my daughter… I know nothing of your honorable son. How could I be so rash as to agree? What parent doesn't fear their child might be thrown into a pit of fire!"

In his haste, he misspoke. Hu Jingye erupted in fury. "Are you insulting my Hu family's upbringing, boy!"

As a Qi Refinement cultivator, his anger manifested physically. His shout was like a crack of thunder, shaking dust from the rafters that rained down on them. Li Baotuo's sons, standing outside, could only watch, their faces tight with anger they dared not voice.

"How dare you!"

Li Chengzhi and Li Baotuo were pinned in place by his spiritual pressure, unable to move. Hu Jingye flung his sleeves back and stormed out of the house. Li Baotuo's legs trembled violently, and his wife crumpled by the doorway in despair, too frightened to move.

Seeing the terror he had caused finally soothed Hu Jingye's bruised ego and blazing anger. He paused at the threshold, his back to them. Li Chengzhi leaped from his seat. "Are you mad! What are you saying!"

He grabbed Li Baotuo, who stumbled and scrambled out of the house. Seeing that Hu Jingye hadn't yet flown away, Li Chengzhi knew the man was still posturing, using threats to get his way. He gathered his robes and hurried out. "Guest Elder Hu! He didn't mean it!"

Li Baotuo, who had never experienced anything like this, was truly terrified. He practically crawled outside, his breath coming in ragged gasps, his vision swimming. Just then, a clear, crisp voice floated down from the air.

"My, what authority, Lord Hu."

The cold, sarcastic tone nearly scared the life out of Li Baotuo. He forced his stiff legs to stand and saw a woman at his doorstep, holding his precious daughter by the hand.

His mind went blank. The woman was an immortal, clad in feathered robes of azure and white. Her hair was black as ink, adorned with a single white flower, and her eyes held a misty, violet hue. Before he could see more, he heard a soft thud.

*Thump!*

His clan uncle, Li Chengzhi, whose composure had been unshakable until now, looked as if his face had shattered like a dropped vase. An expression of infinite horror spread across it. His legs gave out as if the bones had been pulled from them, and his head hit the ground with a dull crack, bumping into Li Baotuo's waist and sending them both tumbling.

The world spun. Li Baotuo saw his clan uncle leap past him like a frog and prostrate himself again, crying out, "Chengzhi pays his respects to the Elder!"

A moment later, Li Baotuo caught sight of Hu Jingye’s face. The old man’s blustering rage was gone, replaced by a vacant confusion as he collapsed to the ground like a pile of mud.

Guest Elder Hu had, of course, seen Li Qinghong before.

He had been watching from the shore when she triggered the formation's lightning to open the island in the lake, doubting he could even survive a single bolt from her. He never imagined he would have any interaction with such an exalted figure, let alone be the target of a phrase like, "My, what authority, Lord Hu."

The words struck him like a bolt of white lightning, leaving him utterly terrified and losing control of his senses. His mind felt shattered as he lay paralyzed on the ground.

But Li Qinghong didn't spare him a single glance. Her eyes fell on the sweating Li Chengzhi, and after a moment's thought, she spoke softly. "Chengzhi?"

"This junior's father is Lord Ximing," Li Chengzhi replied respectfully.

"Ah, so you are Ming'er's son."

Li Qinghong's casual use of the familiar name "Ming'er" was what truly terrified Li Baotuo. He pressed his forehead to the ground, his vision blurring. He finally believed it—this was the woman who commanded the lightning over Qingdu Peak. Her next words were delivered with a light, almost casual air.

"I was merely passing by and happened upon quite a show."

Hu Jingye had recovered enough to speak, though his lips trembled and his face was ashen. "Elder… Elder, it's a misunderstanding."

'He's lucky it was me who came,' Li Qinghong thought. 'Great Uncle dotes on the clan members the most. If he had been here, this man named Hu would have been decapitated by now.'

Her voice was light and melodic. "I found this child endearing and spoke with her for a moment, and you were already planning her marriage to your son. Hu Jingye, you truly have a talent for scheming. Do you dare to meddle in the marriage affairs of our main sect?"

She paused, her voice taking on a dangerous edge. "Perhaps the clan's Justice Hall has been too strict… so much so that you think our direct line are all spineless weaklings? Hmm?"

"E-El… Elder!"

The softer her voice became, the more palpable her rage was to Hu Jingye. Li Qinghong was known for her good temper; no one in the Li family had ever truly angered her. Hu Jingye was the first, and he was paralyzed with fear.

He stammered, unable to form a coherent sentence, his eyes rolling back as if he were about to faint. With a flick of her finger, Li Qinghong sealed his cultivation base. "Chengzhi," she said calmly, "send him to Chenghuai."

Li Chengzhi scrambled to call men over to carry Hu Jingye away.

"Baotuo's branch has been away from the clan for many years," Li Qinghong continued. "My Great Uncle has missed them dearly. Bring them all to see him."

Li Chengzhi bowed deeply in assent. As Li Qinghong held the young girl and vanished in a flash of lightning, Li Baotuo remained kneeling. On the ground, Hu Jingye lay with cold limbs, staring blankly at the sky.

"Congratulations, Baotuo!"

As if he hadn't seen Hu Jingye at all, Li Chengzhi stepped over him and smiled as he helped Li Baotuo to his feet. Streaks of light began to descend from the sky, one after another, and Li Baotuo, feeling as if he were in a dream, vaguely heard a chorus of congratulations.

***

On Pingya Island.

When Li Shuwan landed on the peak, her face was a little pale. She had heard stories of the Great Lake since she was a child, but she never knew Moongaze Lake was so vast. They had crossed its endless waves in an instant, arriving on the island in the blink of an eye.

She had never seen such a palace before. Before she could take in the details, she saw an old man sitting in the main hall. Seven points of azure light glowed on his body, and he had a kind, benevolent air. He approached with a warm smile. "Ah, Wan'er has arrived."

Li Shuwan responded politely. She noticed a youth standing on the other side of the hall, clad in dark red robes threaded with gold. He was turned sideways to her, and when sunlight spilled over him, the sight was so brilliant it made her eyes sting and water.

Li Xuanxuan assumed she was frightened and soothed her with a few gentle words. Li Qinghong sighed softly and recounted the events she had witnessed. "Uncle, the clan's rules are, in the end, a bit too strict. The main sect disciples are fine on the island, but the minor branches in the prefectures often suffer greatly."

Li Zhouwei looked thoughtfully at the girl before raising his head to reply, "Uncle-Master has mentioned this matter before. But the rules are like a binding hoop; they cannot be easily loosened. Li Baotuo is from a minor branch, but if not for that status, how could he have even summoned Hu Jingye? Would others have had a chance to even speak to the man? They receive certain privileges, so they must accept certain restrictions. It prevents them from oppressing others."

Li Xuanxuan placed a book scroll in Li Shuwan's hands and gently guided her to a side hall to memorize it. In his heart, he sympathized with his clan members and tended to agree with Li Qinghong, so he remained silent.

Li Zhouwei continued gravely, "The gap between cultivation realms is insurmountable. If we relax the rules here, they might not be bullied by other cultivators, but they will be more inclined to oppress other mortals. This would create another level of hierarchy among mortals, which would not be a good thing."

Li Qinghong nodded. "I will leave it to your judgment. Our family has always strived for fairness. Inevitably, some will feel wronged, but we shouldn't let our disciples become disheartened. My actions today were also intended to invigorate the various branches, which is why I was somewhat severe."

Their discussion came to a close just as Li Shuwan returned from the side hall. "Seniors," she said in a small voice, "I have memorized it."

"So quickly!" Li Xuanxuan smiled and nodded. The selection criteria for the Talisman Seed were becoming more and more stringent, and the children chosen were increasingly exceptional. He tested her with a few questions, and she answered them all correctly.

Li Zhouwei turned to an attendant. "Please invite the Young Master."

Li Jiangqian soon arrived in the hall. The boy greeted all three elders warmly before turning to call Li Shuwan "little sister." Li Qinghong smiled and brought out the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, and the two children began to recite the incantation.

Li Zhouwei's gaze remained on Li Shuwan. As the two children sat cross-legged to receive the Talisman Seed, he took a step forward, the dark red and gold threads of his robes shimmering faintly. "This child's soul seems… unusual," he murmured. "She seems able to perceive the secrets of others."

"Mm," Li Qinghong agreed, having noticed it as well.

The three of them waited with bated breath. After a full night had passed, a point of light bloomed within the screen. The two children opened their eyes at the same time, both wearing expressions of wonder.

Li Jiangqian's face showed more comprehension. He clapped his hands, stood up, and bowed. "I have received the talisman. Thank you, elders, for your protection!"

Li Shuwan, however, was filled with shock and curiosity. She watched her new "brother" bow and quickly followed suit. But when she lifted her head, she found all four of them staring at her, stunned.

Li Qinghong shot to her feet. On the girl's brow, a point of orange brilliance was slowly emerging. It was shaped like a flower petal, large as a pearl, and pulsed with a clear, bright light. It flashed three times before slowly fading away.



# Chapter 665: The Bulwark

"What kind of cultivation method did you receive?"

This was the moment Li Xuanxuan looked forward to most each year. A flicker of astonishment crossed his eyes as he leaned in and asked in a low voice. Li Jiangqian, being very familiar with the three elders, answered quickly.

"A sixth-grade Purple Mansion method, the *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun*!"

"Excellent!"

Li Xuanxuan was instantly energized, joy flooding his features. A Purple Mansion cultivation method was a treasure of the highest order. Li Zhouwei nodded, a faint smile touching his lips. "It really is Purple Mansion-grade… How many secret techniques?"

The text of a Purple Mansion method was vast. Li Jiangqian considered for a moment before answering respectfully, "Father, there are four."

"Four."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding. Taking advantage of the pause in conversation, Li Shuwan spoke in her small voice. "Reporting to the elders, Shuwan received a sixth-grade Purple Mansion method, the *Golden Book of Houshu*, which contains five secret techniques, along with a text called *Shamanic Talisman Dao*."

Li Zhouwei had expected as much and mulled over the names of the techniques. Li Xuanxuan, however, let out a soft laugh. "Wonderful… It seems the arts granted by our Talisman Seed… are different from the ones we received in the early days! This is a welcome change!"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his thoughts still lingering on the five secret techniques of the *Golden Book of Houshu*.

'My *Radiant Essence Scripture* came with nine techniques, and Jiangqian's has four… but Shuwan received five,' he mused. 'Could her aptitude be even a step above Jiangqian's? That would be a good thing.'

Li Zhouwei knew his second son well. The boy had a difficult personality, though thankfully he wasn't prone to lashing out at others. Having a peer among the younger generation who could keep him in check would prevent him from acting too willfully.

He cleared his throat and spoke in a deep voice. "Jiangqian, Shuwan, first, write down the cultivation methods you have received."

Two small writing desks had already been prepared in the hall. Li Jiangqian was clever and had started writing at a young age, but Li Shuwan didn't know many characters. Fortunately, the methods were contained within the Talisman Seed, so she only needed to copy the shapes of the characters like drawing a picture.

As the two children wrote furiously at their desks, Li Zhouwei stood by, watching quietly. The sky outside gradually darkened, and a frown began to crease his brow.

"These two cultivation methods," he said in a low voice, "are vastly different from the *Radiant Essence Scripture*."

Li Xuanxuan leaned closer as Li Zhouwei continued, "Back then, it took me only an hour to transcribe my method… Two hours have already passed for them. The texts of these two methods are far longer."

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard. Just then, Li Qinghong felt the light of the screen behind her tremble, and An Siwei's respectful voice came through.

"Elders, Xi Zikang is waiting on the island."

"Very well."

Li Qinghong reacted as if it were a routine matter. "Please ask Fellow Daoist Xi to wait in the side hall. I will be there shortly."

Hearing this, the joy on Li Xuanxuan's face faded.

"This transcription won't be finished anytime soon," Li Zhouwei said. "Elder, if you would please watch over them, I will accompany her."

Li Xuanxuan was torn. He wanted to see Li Qinghong off, but he couldn't bear to leave the two children.

"There is no need to see me off, Uncle," Li Qinghong said softly. "It will only upset you."

Li Xuanxuan sighed and turned his face away. Unwilling to linger, Li Qinghong passed through the screen of light and stepped out. Li Zhouwei escorted her through the winding corridors to the side hall, where Xi Zikang had been waiting for some time.

The youth, dressed in silver robes, greeted them with a bright smile. His round face was full of spiritual energy, and his cheerful, polite demeanor made it difficult for anyone to feel ill will toward him. "Senior Qinghong!" he exclaimed.

He held out a jade slip, which was clearly the *Secret Primal Art of Purple Thunder*. Li Qinghong took it at once and unlocked its seals. Li Zhouwei, in turn, handed over two jade slips. The youth accepted them and said, "I have troubled you all these past few years. My thanks to the family head."

Xi Zikang was impeccably polite. Li Zhouwei took the returned jade slips and exchanged a few pleasantries. The youth simply smiled. "Only your esteemed clan knows the truth of the matter. I have heard of the seniors' reputation even in the north; you are known as paragons of the righteous path. If not for that, I fear others would have long ago found an opportunity to kill me for what I carry. Even with a protective talisman, I would not have dared to enter your array."

"Fellow Daoist jests," Li Qinghong said, her expression somewhat complex. She walked with him out of the main hall and asked softly, "Fellow Daoist Xi, will you have enough time for your journey to the East Sea?"

"Of course, it's no problem at all!" Xi Zikang seemed to have no fear of the road ahead. "I'll travel and sightsee along the way. When the time is right, I will naturally be guided into the grotto-heaven. There's no need to rush to any particular place."

"I see."

Li Qinghong nodded and turned to Li Zhouwei. "The Han family of the Eastern Sulphur Islands has fallen on increasingly hard times, to the point where they are besieged on their main island. Their two elders died in an incident connected to our family, so we cannot simply ignore their plight. On my way to the East Sea, I will resolve their siege for them."

She continued, "With my dragon-aspect destiny, ordinary Purple Mansion cultivators would not dare to plot against me. I won't use our family's name. I will just break the siege and help their descendants escape. This can be considered settling the matter on behalf of Xizhi."

The memories of her return from the East Sea were still vivid in her mind; she clearly had not forgotten the Han family. She took a jade pendant from her sleeve and sent a secret message. "This was taken from Wang Fu. Before he died, he held a great deal of resentment toward that Daoist Master, all of which is recorded in this pendant. The Daoist Master cannot peer inside that great array, so perhaps this will be of some use. Keep it safe."

Li Zhouwei accepted it.

"Also," Li Qinghong added, "in the Quanwu Mountains of the Yue State, there is a spirit persimmon tree. I was fortunate enough to encounter her in my youth. Her cultivation was still shallow then; she said she had another thirty-seven years of Qi Refinement to go. By my calculations, she should only have three or four years left. If you have the chance, please go and check on her."

Li Zhouwei carefully noted the location and agreed to everything.

"Minghuang," Li Qinghong said with a smile, "I leave matters here to you."

"Rest assured, Elder."

Li Zhouwei nodded silently and escorted the two of them off the island. He watched as two streaks of lightning vanished into the distance, then turned and flew back. The night wind was cold, and a thin layer of ice had formed on the lake's surface, crackling softly as the wind blew over it.

Moonlight washed over the vast island, bathing it in a silvery-white glow.

'Now,' Li Zhouwei thought, 'it is my turn to serve as the bulwark.'

***

Li Zhouwei landed back in the hall, the cold wind still clinging to him. It was the dead of winter, and the hall felt desolate. The two children had taken pills to stave off hunger and were sitting obediently. Perhaps because copying characters was slower than writing from memory, Li Jiangqian was the first to finish, handing over two thick stacks of paper.

Li Zhouwei took them, his spiritual sense sweeping over the pages. The contents appeared in his mind, and a look of pleasant surprise crossed his face. "It even has an appendix of spells… No wonder the text is so long!"

Li Xuanxuan had already read it and was now using his spiritual sense to inscribe the text onto a jade slip. The old man looked weary, but speaking of the cultivation method brought a bit of life back to his expression. "It's a good thing," he said, his voice raspy. "None of these spells are subpar."

Li Jiangqian was not naive. While he didn't fully grasp how precious these spells were, the sheer number of high-grade techniques told him they were extraordinary. "The sixth-grade *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun*," he recited respectfully, "includes the fifth-grade movement art 'Tread on Flames,' the fifth-grade escape art 'Crimson Sun's Heavenly Parting,' the sixth-grade spell 'Great Parting's White Brilliance,' the fifth-grade spells 'Li Essence Wall' and 'Sun's Resonant Parting Art,' as well as three fourth-grade spells and several third and second-grade spells…"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his expression relaxing. He had already skimmed the text with his spiritual sense. 'These techniques are all related to the Sun or Li Fire. While they are a perfect match, they don't seem to originate from the same source as the *Sutra* itself.'

He examined it more closely. The manual contained no information about its origins; the entire text was remarkably concise.

Li Zhouwei's perception was sharp. The spells originally appended to the *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun* were mostly famous; using any of them would almost certainly lead to being identified. For this reason, Lu Jiangxian had painstakingly removed them, replacing them with techniques carefully selected from tens of thousands of other spells, choosing ones that lacked any distinct sect signature. This was the version of the sutra they now possessed.

As he was contemplating this, Li Shuwan hurried over to present the *Golden Book of Houshu*. Li Zhouwei read it as well and exclaimed, "What a difficult method!"

The 'Whole Pill' attribute was inherently of extreme difficulty; otherwise, the lineage of Changtian Peak at the Azure Pond Sect would not have died out. For the *Golden Book of Houshu* to be a sixth-grade method on top of that, its difficulty was staggering. It shocked even Li Zhouwei. Li Xuanxuan found it utterly incomprehensible; he understood every character, but strung together, they were a bewildering fog.

The *Golden Book of Houshu*'s appendix was sparse, containing only a fifth-grade escape art called 'Scattering White Falling Feather' and a few ancient arts. Most of its pages were filled with mystical, esoteric descriptions of the transformations of various material properties.

"Ah!"

As he read, there was a sudden muffled explosion. A burst of fire erupted on the desk before Li Shuwan. The girl flinched in fright. Before she could speak, Li Zhouwei had lifted her away. "What happened?" he asked with a frown.

White flames blazed on the desk, and several furry insects, which had appeared from nowhere, writhed on the floor. Li Xuanxuan had already pulled Li Jiangqian behind him for protection. Li Shuwan, after composing herself, said in a childlike voice, "Reporting to the elder, I was just about to transcribe that shamanic art… I had only written the beginning… and the paper caught fire on its own…"

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei was taken aback, and Li Xuanxuan was even more surprised. "It seems the grade is too high," he murmured, "or perhaps it has some connection to an immortal…"

"Indeed." A look of anticipation appeared on Li Zhouwei's face. He muttered to himself, "'Whole Pill'… white fire… shamanic talismans…"

He soothed Li Shuwan. The night was late, and the children had been writing for over a day and were utterly exhausted. He sent them to rest, then with a wave of his hand, turned the two piles of paper to ash.

"Elder," he said quietly, "these are two Purple Mansion cultivation methods."

Li Xuanxuan sensed he had more to say and turned his gaze to him.

"This junior has read the clan's history," Li Zhouwei continued softly. "Our ancestors blazed a trail through hardship. Over time, the requirements of the Talisman Seed have become stricter, and the cultivation methods granted have become better. Why is that? In my opinion, it may be related to protecting the common people. The more people our family shelters, the better the methods we are granted… and the harsher the conditions for receiving the talisman. We obtained a Purple Mansion method when we gained control of half of Moongaze Lake. Now that the entire lake is ours, we have even received a full set of accompanying spells…"

Li Xuanxuan nodded.

"This is merely a guess, for now," Li Zhouwei concluded. "The future will reveal the truth. I've noted that the embryonic breathing sections of these two methods are quite profound, so their cultivation speed should not be slow. We can let them begin their training."

Neither Li Jiangqian nor Li Shuwan had been taught the *Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra*. Both of their Purple Mansion methods began from the embryonic breathing stage, so their training would not require much of Li Zhouwei's direct supervision. He set the matter aside for the time being.

"The spells of the 'Whole Pill' attribute can only be practiced by those who cultivate the 'Whole Pill'," Li Xuanxuan said. "However, most of the techniques in the Li Fire series can be practiced by cultivators of various methods. The second and third-grade techniques could be added to the clan's collection."

"Let's be cautious," Li Zhouwei said, looking troubled. "None of these techniques have a known origin. We don't know if some other cultivator might recognize them. I will review them first. Those based on common principles can be distributed for practice, but the more unique ones should be held back for now."

Li Xuanxuan's thoughts were clearly still with Li Qinghong, and he couldn't shake his worries. He nodded and rose to his feet. Li Zhouwei helped the old man up and watched as he stroked his beard.

"Minghuang, you go on with your work," he said, his voice slightly hoarse. "This old man is going for another walk."

Li Zhouwei watched him leave, then picked up the scrolls on the desk. After a moment of hesitation, he picked up his brush and, in a quarter of an hour, finished approving them. An Siwei came in to report.

"Your Highness, Lord Chengliao has already entered seclusion for his breakthrough."

Li Zhouwei paused for a moment. "I am aware," he said. "He informed me earlier… Make a trip to the great desert… and invite Aunt Minggong to return."

***

Winter.

Snow fell heavily over the lake. Li Zhouwei had been busy for over a month, practicing his techniques in his spare time. The *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light* was finally beginning to take shape. At the same time, Chen Yang, after years of diligent work at the northern foot of the Mount Dali, finally returned to the lake with his retinue.

He entered the main hall in high spirits, clearly bearing good news. "Your Highness! There is news from the northern demon cave! That Lu Ken has returned from visiting a friend and has re-entered the cave. He received our message and apologized profusely, saying he was delayed on a trip to the Helin Mountains."

Li Zhouwei had been prepared for the possibility of never finding the demon. This sudden turn of events was a pleasant surprise. "Good," he nodded. "I will pay him a visit at once."

Chen Yang cupped his fists, bowed, and quickly retreated to make the necessary preparations. Li Zhouwei set down his vermilion brush and pressed his hands on the desk, his mind already piecing things together.

'So, he wasn't afraid because of the Dingjiao affair, but because of the thunder-swallowing affair…'

The Li family had searched for the deer demon for years without a trace. Yet, just one month after Li Qinghong's departure, Lu Ken conveniently "returned from visiting a friend" and re-entered his cave. The meaning was obvious.

'This deer demon… or rather, the faction behind him, was afraid that our family would be tactless enough to trouble him about the thunder-method grotto-heaven. A refusal would have damaged the relationship between our families… But they are quite interested in the Dingjiao matter. They were afraid we would report back too soon, which is why he rushed back after only a month.'

No matter how cunning the demons of the grotto were, they were still a step behind humans who specialized in such intrigues. Li Zhouwei saw through it all as clear as day. He felt no particular emotion about it, only a slight sense of satisfaction.

After all, a dragon swallowing thunder was an event of monumental importance. Li Zhouwei was not so foolish as to go asking a fox demon for help; he had never even considered it. The fact that the fox clan was keenly interested in the Dingjiao affair made his position as the intermediary much easier.

He stepped out of the hall into a world blanketed by heavy, white snow. Kongheng, Elder White Ape, An Siwei, and others were already waiting.

Li Zhouwei surveyed them. "The family cannot be left without a Foundation Establishment cultivator on guard. Elder Ape, you will watch over the lake. Kongheng and I will go…"

He hesitated, then considered the poor relationship between fox demons and Buddhist cultivators. The demonic nature of Elder White Ape might actually make it easier to interact with the fox clan. He changed his mind, deciding to take the ape instead. Without any further delay, they set off into the depths of the northern foothills.



# Chapter 666: The Nature of Demons (Part 1)

*Crack.*

The snows of the North Sea never melted. Amidst an endless expanse of white, gale-force winds scoured the mountain peak where an old man sat in silent stillness. A fishing rod of pure white jade extended from his hands into the vast sea of snow, its crystalline line pulled taut, disappearing into the boundless ice sea far below.

Xiao Chuting had remained here, motionless, for decades. Wind and snow swirled past him, yet not a single flake ever touched his robes. His hands, holding the rod, were as steady as if they had been cast from iron.

A series of soft sounds cut through the howling wind as a figure descended, riding the currents of air. Two medicine pouches swayed at his waist, and his hair was threaded with white. It was Xiao Yuansi, his voice warm and sincere as he spoke.

"Greetings, Perfected Master."

"Ah, Yuansi, you've come," Xiao Chuting acknowledged, his voice deep. His hands remained perfectly still as he asked casually, "Did you deliver the medicinal pill to the Li family?"

Xiao Yuansi had long understood that none of his actions or thoughts could ever be hidden from this ancestor. He bowed respectfully. "I did, Perfected Master. In my sentiment for my former disciple, I acted without first reporting to you. Please, forgive my transgression."

"Good."

Xiao Chuting’s expression remained placid. "You've always thought me heartless," he said gently, "but you handled this poorly. Sometimes, ruthlessness is the only way to save someone. In this, you see things less clearly than Tu Longjian."

"Junior..."

Xiao Yuansi started to speak but fell silent. Xiao Chuting gave him no chance to continue.

"I've known for a long time that the Li family possesses a Purple Mansion cultivation method," the old man said softly. "When the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven fell, the secret records of the Dongli Sect fell into the hands of the Three Sects and Seven Gates. Their secrets were laid bare for all to see. Although the Grotto-Heaven itself contained little of true value, its legacy was rooted in the Wei-Li lineage, and the details alone were deadly."

"When Li Ximing achieved Foundation Establishment, the celestial phenomena were unusual. Si Boxiu paid a visit. By cross-referencing the Dongli Sect's records, he not only determined the grade of the technique but even identified which Purple Mansion method it was!"

Xiao Yuansi remained silent as the old man continued, "It is the fourth-grade *Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art*. It requires a specific spiritual qi—the Golden Sun Radiant Origin Qi. That is why the Li family holds onto that old city wall beyond West Screen Mountain so fiercely. They are simply harvesting qi."

"Of course, Si Boxiu doesn't care whether the Li family's method is complete or not. A Purple Mansion cultivator in the Li family would be a welcome development, but their absence is hardly a loss... None of that is the real issue. It’s of little consequence if they have the method. How many who follow such a wild path ever truly succeed? Even if one did, they would be another Changxi at best. The problem... is Li Zhouwei."

Xiao Chuting sighed. "He is a Purple Mansion Seed, and that is no mere pleasantry. His bloodline is extraordinary, surpassing even Chi Buzi's. He is no Changxi! Do you have any idea how many eyes are on him!"

"And as for the Radiant Sky Stone, few in Jiangnan want to see it used on Li Zhouwei. While they may not act openly against him, none of them wish him well."

The old man’s voice dropped lower. "Tu Longjian, for all his cunning, is not old enough. He could never outwit Tianwan. The moment he made that wager with her, countless people would have conspired to harm Li Xijun. Even if he had won the Radiant Sky Stone, with Li Xijun dead, it would have been as useless as not having it at all! That's why Tianwan dared to let those two rogue cultivators act. She knew someone would help them from the shadows..."

Xiao Yuansi let out a deep sigh. "This junior... I do not understand."

Xiao Chuting said, "Look at the situation now and you will. Li Qinghong has gone to the Eastern Sea, and Li Xijun is dead. Who can restrain Li Ximing now? He is a man driven by the pursuit of immortality. Do you truly believe he won't use the Radiant Sky Stone to attempt a breakthrough himself? Who could resist such a temptation? How could it possibly be saved for Li Zhouwei?"

"My goal, and Changxi's, was to apply pressure on Li Ximing. He understood this himself. But with the pill you delivered, he can no longer sit still! His attempt at a breakthrough is a path to certain death, and it will exhaust the family's resources..."

Xiao Yuansi bowed his head, saying nothing. He too understood the overwhelming allure of the Purple Mansion realm. Li Ximing's final words to him had almost certainly been a pretense.

The old man before him sighed again. "Right now, the other Purple Mansion masters are likely hoping Li Ximing attempts his breakthrough. One more or less makes little difference to them, and he is almost guaranteed to fail. He has no concept of the true dangers involved. He sees the cultivators of the Three Sects and Seven Gates succeed and assumes the odds are as simple as they appear."

"I deliberately created obstacles for you, hoping to delay the pill's refinement until after Li Ximing went into seclusion. My intent was for it to be delivered to Li Zhouwei. But you... you pushed yourself to the point of injury just to get it there in time..."

The old man gave him a long, deep look and sighed. "So be it. Let your bond as master and disciple be fulfilled."

For a full quarter of an hour, Xiao Yuansi stood frozen, unable to utter a single word.

"You may leave..."

Xiao Yuansi departed, his spirit crushed. Xiao Chuting remained, his fishing rod held high. Only when his junior's presence had faded completely did the raging snowstorm around him begin to calm. In that instant, the look of disappointment vanished from his face, replaced by a deep, calculating calm.

'Yuansi is sincere and kind, and he's one of our own,' he thought. 'How could the other Purple Mansion masters possibly suspect him? Their attention will only be drawn to probing Li Zhouwei.'

He gave the long rod a slight lift, yet it seemed to weigh more than a mountain. The entire snow-covered peak trembled, and in the next moment, sheets of snow began to slide, gathering momentum into a thunderous avalanche. Far below, from the depths of the ice sea, a single point of light began its slow ascent.

***

*Mount Dali*

The peaks of Mount Dali were cloaked in white. Under the moonlight, the forest was a sea of silver trees. Li Zhouwei gazed into the distance at the undulating mountain range. A few plumes of black smoke rose against the snow, where small groups of patrolling demons stamped their feet and laughed around crackling bonfires.

Mount Dali was situated in the far north of Jiangnan. It snowed every year, but never for long, and the locals treated it as a beautiful, fleeting sight. The old White Ape standing beside Li Zhouwei looked out and spoke, his voice ancient.

"Your Highness... it's been a hundred years since a human was eaten on Mount Dali. The yao here have grown simple. They have forgotten the taste."

"That is a credit to our ancestors," Li Zhouwei replied with a nod.

They descended onto a snowy peak, the snow crunching softly underfoot. A group of demons was gathered around a fire pit before the entrance to a deer demon's cave, warming themselves.

Their arrival startled the group, but instead of fleeing, a demon with the face of a deer and enormous ears stepped forward. Its cultivation was only at the fourth layer of Embryonic Breathing, yet it could already speak human words.

"Hey, you there!" it called out with a strange accent. "Are you here to gather herbs? Come, warm yourself by the fire..."

Before it could finish, the tiger demon leading the patrol nearly jumped out of its skin in terror. It grabbed the deer demon, forcing it to its knees, and cried out in a panicked voice, "This lowly one greets the two great lords!"

The tiger demon was a Qi Refining leader and had already developed its spiritual sense. It recognized the two newcomers as Foundation Establishment cultivators. A single glance from the White Ape had nearly scared the life out of it, and it prostrated itself on the ground.

"Go and announce us," the old ape said, his voice deep and resonant. "The Li family has come to visit the Cave Master."

Li Zhouwei paid the commotion little mind. As he waited before the cave, the deer demon's words echoed in his thoughts. 'It's been a hundred years. My family has come and gone from Mount Dali, trading spirit rice for spiritual items, gathering herbs, and extracting essences. The demons here haven't preyed on humans for a long time; they've become naive and trusting. Our cultivators, needing their help, have often treated them with courtesy, leading to such harmony.'

"Your Majesty speaks the truth!"

Just as the thought crossed his mind, a howling spiritual wind gusted from the cave. A middle-aged man wrapped in a robe emerged, his dark hair unbound and his eyes a deep brown. A large shield was strapped to his back. "This lowly one greets the Great King!" he boomed.

He bowed deeply. Li Zhouwei frowned and moved to help him up. Lu Ken had always addressed his elders as a 'Fellow Daoist,' and such a deep bow disrupted the established seniority between them. "Senior, what is the meaning of this?" he asked, surprised.

Lu Ken rose, a wide smile on his face. "We can discuss that later. When we see the White Qilin, we must first pay our proper respects. Hence, the bow."

Though his face was all smiles, the reverence in his eyes was unmistakable. It was clear he shared the same sentiment as the Dragon Prince, Dingjiao, and saw him not as a man, but as the White Qilin.

The deer demon wasted no more words, leading him into the cave. The interior was vast, its stone walls as smooth and white as jade, with clear, elegant veins running through them. Lesser Demons bowed along the sides, and the ground was covered with cushions made from the pelts of beasts—mostly wolves and tigers.

'A deer demon as the cave master,' Li Zhouwei mused. 'The wolves and tigers of the northern yue must be on the verge of extinction...'

After they were seated in the place of honor, Lu Ken’s brown eyes glanced at the White Ape, and he immediately began to apologize. "I've been visiting a friend in the Helin Mountains for the past few years... we traveled together to the Southern Borderlands. The journey back and forth took years. I only just returned to the mountain. My apologies for the delay."

Li Zhouwei didn't believe a word of his excuses but acknowledged them politely before getting straight to the point. "My family has sent a number of letters recently, which I'm sure you have seen. We wish to meet with Senior Bai Rong. Do you have any news from the Demon Cave? We would ask you to contact him for us."

"It's already been arranged!" Lu Ken laughed, clasping his fist. "Fellow Daoist, rest assured. The moment I returned, I reported to the Demon Cave and received a message. They were merely waiting for your arrival. I will send for him at once."

He lowered his voice. "Over the past few years, my master has gained the great favor of a Great Demon, and his status in the cave has risen. After accumulating his foundation for so long, his innate talent blossomed after he reached Foundation Establishment, and he has won the allegiance of many Demon Generals. He is a great lord now!"

It was clear that Bai Rong's rise in status had brought Lu Ken considerable benefits. His face beamed with pride and joy as he ordered the other demons to prepare a grand banquet, while sending another to the Demon Cave to summon Bai Rong.

The White Ape observed the preparations and commented softly, "Cave Master, this is quite a magnificent feast. A great deal of meat."

Although Lu Ken didn't recognize the White Ape, he quickly surmised the old ape's considerable age. "Fellow Daoist, may I ask your age?"

"Four hundred and sixty-some years..."

The answer clearly surprised Lu Ken. "Impressive," he said with admiration. "To answer your question, although we are deer demons, a meal with meat is always better than one with plants. Even mortal deer... have a habit of eating birds, snakes, and insects..."

"It is all instinct," he continued, then hesitated. "Besides..."

Lu Ken couldn't bring himself to say, 'most demons also eat humans,' but Li Zhouwei understood the unspoken sentiment. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, silently acknowledging that in Lu Ken's eyes, he too was one of the demons. Otherwise, the deer demon would not have caught his words at the last second.

"Lu Ken!"

Just as the White Ape and Lu Ken were chatting, a loud call came from outside the cave. A streak of purple fire shot through the air and solidified within the cavern, revealing a youth dressed in a wide-sleeved, blue-green robe. A string of brilliant silver beads hung around his neck. His features were sharp and narrow.

"I'm here!" he announced.

Lu Ken hurried to bow. The youth strode forward, his smile fading slightly as he studied Li Zhouwei with a hint of confusion. "You're the White Qilin... right. I heard Li Xijun died, too..."

"Li Xijun was my grand-uncle."

"Oh!"

With that, Bai Rong seemed to sort out the generations. "Ah... I go into seclusion for a bit, and in the blink of an eye, decades pass. Your family’s cultivators just keep changing... It's said that humans have short lifespans, but from what I've seen, disaster at the hands of others is a far greater threat than the limits of nature."

"Your family truly are the descendants of the Bright Yang. The lords in the demon cave have spoken of you, called you a White Qilin. Looking at you now, I see they were right."

Bai Rong warmed up quickly, his manner becoming relaxed and open. He glanced at the deer demons below, who were all staring up at the food with eager eyes, and said with some exasperation, "You've really picked up bad habits from those humans. Must you put on such a show just for me? They're already dying to start eating. Hurry up and send them out so they can have their fill."

Lu Ken bowed respectfully and, understanding his master's meaning, quickly dismissed the lesser demons, herding and kicking them out of the main hall. He then thoughtfully sealed the heavy stone door and stood guard outside.

Once the door boomed shut and the cave's defensive array began to hum, Bai Rong smiled. "There aren't many people left in your Li family that I know. I remember a little old fellow... from Tongya's nephew's generation. Last time I visited the lake, he was the only one I could really talk to. Is he still around? If he's gone, I can't be bothered to visit anymore."

"The elder's health is still robust."

Li Zhouwei knew he was referring to Li Xuanxuan. So many years after Li Tongya's death, the bond between their two families had naturally weakened. That Bai Rong still remembered was a testament to their former friendship.

Bai Rong didn't delay. He asked about the purpose of the visit, and Li Zhouwei stated it plainly.

"This junior had been cultivating in the Eastern Sea. I have come at the request of the Dragon Prince, Dingjiao, to seek your assistance on behalf of the Dragon Kind in the matter of Listening to the Abyss."

Bai Rong chuckled. "I know... The dragons put some thought into having you act as their messenger."

His expression turned serious. "My ancestral grandmother and Dongfang You were never on good terms. They weren't enemies, but they certainly didn't get along! If Dongfang You weren't already dead, and if my master wasn't on good terms with the dragons... Hmph, that Dingjiao fellow would never have dared to ask."

Li Zhouwei remained silent, listening.

"He may not have told you everything," Bai Rong continued in a low voice, "but I can guess. He wants to go to the Southern Sea."

"As foxes, we are forbidden from entering the sea. But since the Dragon Prince has asked... this matter is not too difficult. I don't mind making a trip on my master's behalf."

Li Zhouwei felt a wave of relief. He didn't covet the spiritual tool Dingjiao had offered; in fact, he had no intention of accepting it. Forging a good relationship with the Dragon Kind was far more important.

As Li Zhouwei considered this, Bai Rong let out a laugh. "Then it's settled. White Qilin, you will accompany me to the Southern Sea."

"Hm?"

In this affair between the dragons and the foxes, Li Zhouwei had always seen himself as a neutral messenger. He had been careful not to favor either side, but now the winding path of this matter had led directly back to him.

"This junior's cultivation is shallow, and I know nothing of these ancient affairs. I fear I will only slow you down, Senior."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, but Bai Rong was just smiling at him. In his human form, the youth still possessed a foxy aura, and his voice was tinged with a subtle sharpness.

"White Qilin, Dingjiao wants more than just to Listen to the Abyss. He wants to befriend both of us. If you don't go... the whole thing falls through."

"Besides," he added, his expression growing solemn. "With Li Qinghong gone, you won't be safe on the lake for long. You'll have a much easier time with me and Dingjiao... At our side, at least no one will dare to get any ideas."



# Chapter 667: The Nature of Demons (Part 2)

Li Zhouwei remained silent for a long moment, carefully weighing the fox demon's words.

The Demon Cave of Mount Dali had always been on friendly terms with his clan. Favorable rumors, true or not, often circulated, but the bond between Bai Rong and Li Tongya was clearly something Bai Rong held in high regard.

After a moment of hesitation, he spoke. "Thank you for your guidance, Senior. You and my ancestor shared a profound friendship, and we of a later generation naturally treat you with the utmost respect. Since you have spoken, I know you would not wish me harm, and I will follow your advice."

A look of pleasure washed over Bai Rong's face at these words, a hint of nostalgia in his eyes. Li Zhouwei paused, then feigned confusion. "But... while my innate talent may be decent, my clan has fallen into decline. It makes sense for the Dragon Prince Dingjiao to befriend you, Senior, but why would he extend such kindness to me?"

Beneath his robes, Bai Rong's tail gave a slight swish. He tossed a piece of fruit into his mouth and pointed a finger at Li Zhouwei. "You are a White Qilin," he said softly.

Then, he gestured to himself. "I am a white fox."

Seeing Li Zhouwei nod, he stated plainly, "And Dingjiao is a white flood dragon, is he not?"

A thoughtful expression crossed Li Zhouwei's face.

Bai Rong chuckled. "That's just how the dragon lineage is—proud, arrogant, with the hearts of kings. It started a thousand years ago... they began uniting the demon clans, offering generous aid to declining demon races. You must understand, the dragon lineage has always dreamed of becoming true dragons. And what is a true dragon? Their ambition is boundless. They see themselves as demon emperors, and all demons of a single color as their subjects. Having a White Qilin under his banner would naturally be to his advantage."

He paused, a thoughtful look on his face as he murmured, "I seem to recall a Daoist Master mentioning years ago that some fellow named Guo... Shen... something... also received a great deal of help from the dragon lineage."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding, though a sliver of doubt remained in his heart. For now, he could only accept the explanation. After a moment of silence, he finally let out a breath and said in a low voice, "But I am human."

Bai Rong snorted, the smile slowly vanishing from his face. His tone grew solemn. "White Qilin," he whispered. "There is no difference."

His voice echoed through the cave. The old ape lifted his head to look at him.

Bai Rong's voice became a little sharper. "You've reached the Purple Mansion Realm. This is merely a physical shell. An ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator can discard their body at will, choosing to be male or female as they please. If you no longer wished to be human, sculpting a body of a bird or a beast would pose no problem. In the Dao of transformation and divine arts, the beast is me, and the man is me. What is the difference?"

He studied the young man before him intently. "And you are even more unusual. You carry the Wei-Li bloodline. To put it bluntly, you are the descendant of a True Monarch. When your cultivation reaches its peak, you *are* the White Qilin. With your innate arts, if you simply will it, you can transform into a true White Qilin in an instant."

"How can a mere human body compare to that of a White Qilin? Back in the day, none of the Wei-Li imperial family thought otherwise. They often walked the world in their demonic forms, only assuming human shape when it was inconvenient, much like any other demon."

His foxy eyes blinked as he took a sip of fruit wine. "The distinction between human and beast was never so great to begin with, especially for a descendant of a Golden Core cultivator. And he was a True Monarch!"

"A True Monarch is a cosmic position, a being that transcends the boundary between human and beast. The moment they achieve that realm, they are no longer human! You carry their blood, so you naturally carry their form!"

The fox demon laughed twice and pointed upward. "Take that True Monarch Lushui, for example. Is he truly just a man? His every thought is the clear green water of the world, a single blink can ripple across every pond from north to south. He is the water, the pond, the spring, the dew... he is even the feathered serpent, the azure flood dragon, the talisman, and the incantation. His few centuries of life as a human are as thin and insignificant as a single drop in that pond."

Li Zhouwei listened in silence.

When he finished, Bai Rong said softly, "Do not dwell on it. In the end, all cultivation comes down to one's nature and one's destiny. If you can one day seek out your Metallic Essence, you will grasp the profundity of this even more deeply."

"I have learned a great deal, Senior."

Li Zhouwei acknowledged the lesson, a contemplative look on his face. Bai Rong nodded, his solemn expression melting away into a grin. "That's what my master always says, anyway," he added with a chuckle. "I just listened carefully and thought I'd share a thing or two with you."

"Then please, thank your master on my behalf..." Li Zhouwei said.

"Well then, let's not delay," Bai Rong said, his smile widening. "We'll go to the Flood Dragon Palace together. The Azurewater Scale-Beasts are incredibly fast; it'll save us the trouble of flying."

"Please wait a moment while I arrange matters at home," Li Zhouwei replied. "I will join you shortly."

But Bai Rong was already brimming with enthusiasm. He sprang to his feet, shaking out his blue-green robes. "No trouble at all! I'll go with you. I can see that old fellow of yours while I'm at it."

***

The waves of the Eastern Sea crashed endlessly.

Two streaks of light, one silver and one purple, shot across the sky. The silver-robed young man gazed down, seemingly admiring the unique beauty of the Eastern Sea.

"Senior," he said with a smile, "I've heard that there's a Miao family in the Southern Sea whose lightning arts are quite unique. Do you know of them?"

Li Qinghong, who had her own history with the Miao family, replied softly, "I've crossed paths with them twice. They are formidable. I was still inexperienced at the time and suffered a small setback. I might even run into them again in the Grotto-Heaven. They are a peculiar clan, and their cultivation of demonic arts makes them truly one of a kind."

She and Xi Zikang had been flying for over half a year to reach the Eastern Sulphur Islands. The landscape below was a scorched patchwork of red and black. The smoke of war that had choked the skies for so long had finally begun to thin, as most of the islands had already been conquered.

The islands were charred black, with no mortals in sight. The few tattered grand arrays that remained were now controlled by cultivators, and wreckage was strewn everywhere.

The main island of the Eastern Sulphur chain was still holding out. Though it had been under siege for five or six years and its defensive light was incredibly dim, it had not yet collapsed. The ring of cultivators surrounding it seemed to be in no hurry, taking turns to attack, slowly grinding down the array.

The mainland sects, having once been the pillars of the righteous path, would have ended such a conquest quickly. They rarely let a siege drag on for years. But in the Eastern Sea, concepts like reputation and restraint held little sway. Here, profit was the only law, and slowly wearing down an enemy was the most practical approach.

Li Qinghong and Xi Zikang flew to the edge of the main island completely unnoticed. The few Foundation Establishment cultivators standing guard were clearly not of high caliber—lucky survivors pushed forward by elixirs and grueling, life-or-death cultivation. They hadn't cultivated any ocular arts and were completely oblivious to the two figures in the sky.

Xi Zikang observed the scene with her for a moment before smiling. "Senior, do you intend to intervene? My cultivation is respectable enough; I can offer some assistance."

"They're just a group of rogue cultivators... there's no need."

Li Qinghong wasn't worried about them. The cultivators besieging the Han family were clearly a loose alliance of several nearby powers, disunited and weak. Otherwise, the Han family would never have been able to hold out for so long.

She was contemplating the best way to resolve the situation, preferably without a fight. Xi Zikang, however, had already sensed her hesitation.

"This isn't difficult," he said with a smile. "I'll drive them away. You can go and free the people, Senior."



# Chapter 668: The Heart of all under the Heavens

The young man was brimming with confidence, as if dispersing this motley crew of rogue cultivators was the easiest thing in the world. Li Qinghong was slightly taken aback.

"Fellow Daoist, what are you...?" she began softly.

Xi Zikang gave a soft chuckle and shook out his silver-white sleeves. He produced a small, gleaming silver chariot, no bigger than his palm. Two tiny blue-and-white flags, inscribed with runes, were planted on it. He intoned a command:

"By the authority of the Profound Thunder Division, by the command of the Northern Palace, ride the chariot, command the lightning, save the world and cure its ills!"

The thunder chariot trembled and instantly sprang to life. It leaped with the powerful, heavy momentum of a pouncing tiger, swelling in an instant to the size of a house. The two blue-and-white thunder banners fluttered high, crackling with silver lightning that stretched over a hundred feet in the wind.

"My Profound Thunder path whips the wind and commands the storm... scattering a few cultivators is nothing!"

Thunderclouds roiled in the sky as a storm began to churn the sea below. Xi Zikang landed on the chariot, gripped the silvery reins, and ascended with the tempest. "Senior," he called out, his voice clear and resonant, "I only need ten breaths."

The sea was already being torn apart by a raging gale. Darkness fell, so thick and gray you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. The only light came from the magnificent, ancient thunder chariot, which blazed with a dazzling silver brilliance. Its two banners trailed behind it like a pair of lightning serpents.

Clad in his shimmering silver robes, Xi Zikang looked like a god commanding the thunder, an image of awesome might.

'Of course,' Li Qinghong thought. 'He's from one of the North Sea's most renowned Purple Mansion immortal clans. His lineage must trace back to the Thunder Palaces... he's no ordinary cultivator.'

The boy was young, friendly, and respectful, with no extravagant adornments. For a moment, she had forgotten his noble origins. But now, seeing the majesty of his chariot, she realized it rivaled even the one Tuoba Chongyuan once possessed.

'The great lightning-wielding clans and sects of the North Sea are truly remnants of the old Thunder Palaces,' she mused. 'This magnificent chariot is proof enough.'

In a flash, Xi Zikang had driven the storm forward. A deep gloom fell over the Eastern Sulphur Islands, plunging the assembled cultivators into blinding darkness. They all looked up just as silver lightning rained down from the heavens, sending them scattering in chaos.

This group was a patchwork force from various powers to begin with. Seized by terror, they broke apart. The three Foundation Establishment cultivators among them shot into the air, ready to hurl curses, but the words died on their lips when they saw the noble, domineering chariot. Their expressions changed, and they hesitated, not daring to approach.

Xi Zikang, however, simply formed a seal. He tore a length of lightning from the sky as if ripping a bolt of white cloth and casually smashed it down on the three men's heads. "The Eastern Sea is full of demonic cultivators, after all!" he said coldly.

The three were rogue cultivators of the Eastern Sea. One reeked of blood qi, the other two of turbid energy. How could they possibly withstand such pure Profound Thunder? They were scared witless, crying out in misery as they turned to flee.

But the spell, though seemingly casual, was of an extremely high grade. The lightning was inherently swift. The three cultivators were instantly overwhelmed, trailing thick black smoke as they escaped.

Xi Zikang was momentarily stunned, thinking to himself in surprise, 'Their cultivation is pathetic... The Eastern Sea is vast, but it's the domain of the dragon lineage. The endless treasures of the deep are inaccessible, and they're isolated on these few islands... What good resources could they possibly have?'

He had misjudged. The three had no intention of fighting him. Most who survived in the Eastern Sea were cautious. Seeing such a grand display and such a luxurious vehicle, anyone could tell he was the direct descendant of an immortal clan. They didn't dare say another word, simply fleeing for their lives and praying he wouldn't give chase.

He had only meant to pin them down but had underestimated his own strength. Now, they had vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving the entire sea around the Eastern Sulphur Islands deserted. He circled twice in his thunder chariot before sheepishly recalling it.

"Impressive, Fellow Daoist."

Li Qinghong approached with a smile. Xi Zikang looked slightly embarrassed. Just then, the grand array below them flickered, and an old man in a red robe flew out. He glanced around cautiously before calling out from a distance.

"Which senior graces us with their presence?"

This was a Li family matter, so Xi Zikang remained silent, turning his head slightly. Li Qinghong simply nodded without replying. The old man looked at them for a few seconds, and then understanding dawned. He flew closer in a rush.

"So it is—"

"Ah," Li Qinghong cut him off. The old man caught his mistake and, upon reaching them, lowered his voice. "Seniors, please, come into the array to speak!"

Li Qinghong didn't want to waste time. "There's no need," she said gently.

The future of this sea voyage was uncertain. She had not only left the Chongming Profound Insight Screen behind but even the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman. She murmured something to Xi Zikang, who nodded in understanding. He then took a small, apricot-colored pagoda from his sleeve and activated it, enveloping them in a barrier that sealed them off from the outside world.

The action startled the red-robed elder, but he gritted his teeth and stood his ground, allowing the pagoda's light to surround them. Only then did Li Qinghong speak.

"May I know which Fellow Daoist you are?"

"This humble one is Han Shihai! I had the honor of meeting the Immortal once before..."

"It's you!"

Li Qinghong actually recognized him. This was the man who had received her during her last visit to the islands. But back then, he had been a middle-aged man. Now, his hair was white, and his aura was completely different.

A look of profound gratitude filled Han Shihai's eyes. "I have exhausted my lifespan maintaining the clan's array. I must be a laughable sight to you, Immortal..."

Han Shihai had reached the end of his rope. Tears streamed down his aged face as he poured out his story.

Han Shizhen and his servant had been the pillars of the Han family. After their abrupt deaths in the dragon lineage's territory, the family's strength had plummeted. The situation was already perilous when the Han family's patriarch, who had been in seclusion trying to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, was caught completely off guard by the celestial phenomenon of "water falling and thunder rising." He was cultivating the 'Returning to Earth' path of Earth Virtue. He lasted only a year before his own breakthrough failed, transforming into another celestial omen.

Neighboring powers had immediately pounced. The remaining Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Han family had been killed one by one, leaving only Han Shihai and a female cultivator. They were trapped, prepared for the clan's utter destruction, hoping only to escape with their lives.

Han Shihai could never have imagined, not in ten days and nights of thinking, that Li Qinghong would be the one to save them. Overwhelmed by joy and sorrow, tears flowed freely, and he nearly fell to his knees.

Li Qinghong held him up. "Your family has operated in the Eastern Sea for many years," she said in a low voice. "Do you have any information on the Miao family of the Southern Sea?"

Without asking why, Han Shihai searched his storage pouch and produced a jade slip. "My benefactor," he said solemnly, "the Miao family once had business dealings with us. Everything we know is recorded here."

Li Qinghong accepted it but didn't look at it immediately. "Good," she said softly. "We have only scared these people off for now. You must hurry and arrange for your clansmen to evacuate. If you delay, they will surely return the moment we leave."

"Ah?"

Han Shihai was utterly confused. He had already prepared himself for the Han family to be absorbed by the Li family and had been acting with the deference of a subordinate. Li Qinghong's words shattered all his assumptions.

'But! But why would they help us for no reason at all!'

His century of experience surviving in the Eastern Sea failed him completely. He stared blankly at Li Qinghong and stammered, "Immortal, you first covered for my family before the great sects, and now you have saved us from ruin... How could we possibly just leave..."

Li Qinghong laughed. "You are a cultivator of the Eastern Sea, yet you speak such words. I told you to go, so go. Did you think I came here just to take a pound of flesh from you?"

Seeing the deep confusion on the old man's face, she grew serious. "The deaths of your family members were connected to my clan's affairs... and our friendship still stands. It is a small thing to lend a hand now that your clan has fallen on hard times. Say no more, Senior. Go, quickly, and take your people."

Han Shihai could now hear the sincerity in her voice. He choked back a sob. "Immortal, your kindness is as immense as a mountain. My own lifespan is spent; I will be gone in a few days and can never repay this debt... This grace of rebirth, the Han family will remember it... If there is a next life, we will repay you, even if we must serve as horses or dogs..."

Saving the Han family was a matter of fulfilling an obligation, but Li Qinghong didn't want to become too entangled. "My clan is also treading on thin ice," she replied softly. "I likely won't live to see that day. Go now, and find another path for survival. Do not mention my Li family, lest you bring disaster upon your own."

Han Shihai was overcome with grief. He covered his face and bowed his farewell, then shot back to the island like the wind. Spirit boats rose into the air, and a procession of people departed in a flurry of activity. Only after they had vanished from sight did Li Qinghong and Xi Zikang ascend on a bolt of lightning.

The young man was visibly moved. He flew in silence for a long time.

"Fellow Daoist," Li Qinghong began, "do you know about the matter of the Thunder Palaces? The whole world seems to be in an uproar..."

"Of course, I know!" Xi Zikang answered, a little distractedly. "The Immortal Lords left this world, and two new Earth Virtue True Monarchs ascended at the same time. The sects and clans had been suppressed for too long. Heaven and Earth were of one mind, so the Twelve Thunder Palaces naturally collapsed. There's not much more to it."

Seeing her thoughtful expression, he seemed to know her next question. "As for the common people suffering under the Thunder Palaces for ages... Earth Virtue represents the state and the people's livelihood. 'The people hear what I hear, the people see what I see. My heart is the heart of the world.' With the world in turmoil, is their rebellion not normal? It was all decided in a single thought!" he said dismissively. "I know what you're thinking. I've heard all the arguments against the Thunder Palaces. I just smile and say nothing."

'My heart is the heart of the world... How utterly terrifying!'

Having lived on the mainland in the current era after the great changes, Li Qinghong had hardly ever met a proper Earth Virtue cultivator. The only one of any note was Changxi, a Purple Mansion cultivator who focused purely on arts and techniques. This was the first time she had heard of the true divine arts of the Earth Virtue path, and she was secretly horrified.

'If that's the case... it's no wonder that only the arts and techniques of Earth Virtue remain... A single thought to command the will of the people—which power could ever tolerate that?'

A heaviness settled in her heart. She was silent for a long time, other speculations forming in her mind. 'Qingxuan is also of the Earth Virtue path, but he doesn't seem to follow the way of state and people. Perhaps only two of the five types of earth possess such divine power.'

Of the Five Virtues, the Five Waters, Five Fires, and Three Metals were well-known, but the others were obscure. Li Qinghong tried to probe for more information, but Xi Zikang either didn't know or wasn't willing to say.

'I wonder what technique the Han patriarch was cultivating. Was the 'water falling and thunder rising' that killed him intentional or a coincidence? Only people like Xi Zikang would know such secrets...'

She was lost in thought. Xi Zikang, however, was still pondering Han Shihai's words. After a long silence, he said in a low voice, "I always thought that those who practiced demonic arts were all unpardonable villains. But to think they could have such devotion, to burn away their own lifespan to protect their kin... My clan practices the righteous laws of Profound Thunder... but it would be hard to find many who are like him."

Li Qinghong said softly, "The Eastern Sea is rife with Blood Pills. Demonic arts and techniques are widespread. Even a normal cultivator's hands are stained with blood. That is why they all seem like villains in your eyes..."

Xi Zikang paused, a pained look on his face. "But he consumed the Blood Pills. He cultivated the demonic arts. No matter how devoted he was, no matter his reasons, he cannot wash away the turbid blood in his veins. While I admire the man, if I were to meet him in the Northern Sea, I would still have to strike him down with my lightning."

"My clan's Daoist Master once said that the fault is not theirs, but the evil is. Even if we lack the power to cleanse the world of all demons and right all wrongs, we cannot turn a blind eye to the evils we can subdue."

Li Qinghong opened her mouth to speak, then fell silent. She didn't know how to respond. A dark thought crossed her mind. 'His ancestors followed the Dao of the Thunder Palaces. It seems they weren't as villainous as the Shen family's texts claimed, but they lacked compassion all the same. The entanglements of the ancient past are a mess. The Wei-Li name is no better... There's nothing to be said...'

She changed course, turning toward Yuezhou Island, the home of the Profound Peak Gate. 'This news is too important. I'll use the Profound Peak Gate to send a letter home.'

***

**Moongaze Lake**

Li Zhouwei had finished setting his affairs in order. With his father, Li Chengliao, in seclusion, he had arranged for his elders—Li Minggong and Li Chenghuai—to oversee things before heading to the main hall.

Bai Rong was wandering barefoot through the hall, with Li Xuanxuan following beside him. The old man seemed to be in high spirits, laughing and chatting.

There were very few people Li Xuanxuan could truly open up to. He loved to speak of the past, but there was almost no one left who could share those memories with him. By now, it was only Li Qiuyang, Chen Donghe, and An Zheyan.

But Li Qiuyang had been grievously injured and then burned by the Merging Fire; he now looked ancient beyond his years. When Li Xuanxuan visited, they could barely exchange a few words. Chen Donghe and An Zheyan were always too respectful to speak freely.

But this fellow Bai Rong, with his grumbling and muttering, had somehow managed to get Li Xuanxuan talking. From outside the hall, Li Zhouwei could hear peals of laughter and felt reluctant to interrupt.

He waited only a few moments before Bai Rong came scurrying out. After bidding the old man farewell, Li Xuanxuan, who would never dream of hindering the younger generation's business, saw them off with a smile.

Once they had taken to the air and left the lake behind, Bai Rong said grimly, "My white fox clan has some ability to read the hearts of men. That old man carries a great deal of sorrow. His later years have not been easy."

A rare shadow of gloom fell over Li Zhouwei.

Bai Rong began pulling artifacts out of his sleeves as he muttered, "You had better cultivate properly. Don't go out looking for fights. The hot-headed ones all die sooner or later. And don't be like those elders of yours, throwing their lives away for the clan... Live a long time, so you don't break that old man's heart again."

"I understand, Senior," Li Zhouwei replied with genuine sincerity.

Bai Rong tossed a spirit boat into the air. In an instant, it transformed into a simple, unadorned wooden pushcart. Its two wheels were crooked, the bark was crudely peeled in uneven patches, and a few branches still stuck out here and there.

Bai Rong introduced it with great pride. "This is my demon carriage! I used it to ferry the kits in my clan back in the Northern Foothills! When I came to the cave, I refined it into a proper vehicle. You are the very first White Qilin to ride it!"

"Right..."

Li Zhouwei found the situation rather bizarre. It was the first time he had ever seen anyone travel by pushcart. He sat cross-legged in the cart as Bai Rong settled beside him, grinning for reasons unknown as he summoned a gust of green wind.

"Let's go!"



### Chapter 669: The Southern Sea

Bai Rong's cart, though unassuming in appearance, was anything but slow. In little more than a month, they had plunged deep into the Southern Borderlands, riding a gale of cyan wind that never paused for a moment.

Only when they ventured into the depths did a few demons dare to block their path. The leader was a wolf demon with a green face, long fangs, and hair like crimson flames—a starkly different appearance from the demons of Jiangnan. Bai Rong barked at them twice.

"Elder here is the White Fox of Mount Li! Who's the blind fool blocking my path!"

The wolf demon's expression changed at his words. His lupine face, already ugly, contorted into a frown. He blinked his four eyes and stammered, "So it's Elder Fox! My apologies, my apologies! Now that you two Elders have crossed the ridge, why not stop by my king's place for a visit? This humble demon will heat some tea and serve you a few blood buns."

Bai Rong glanced at him skeptically. "And which backwater mountain does your king rule that he dares invite me for a visit?"

The four-eyed wolf demon replied respectfully, "He is the Black Ape Great General, serving under the Bifeng Mountain Lord. He resides on Black Lacquer Ridge…"

"Get lost! Such nonsense!" Bai Rong's face fell at the mention of the Bifeng Mountain Lord. With a wave of his hand, he sent the demon flying a dozen yards. "Just a monkey, and far too much trouble!"

The two demons were sent tumbling by the demonic wind he kicked up. They yelped in pain, but scrambled back to their feet and shouted after him, "Be careful, Elder! There are shapeshifting shamans near the ridge, and they're treacherous creatures…"

Bai Rong had already sped several miles away, the two demons still calling out "Elder" as they saw him off from their mountain. Li Zhouwei wore a thoughtful expression. Bai Rong stole a glance at him and said, a little awkwardly, "I don't know those local demons at all! Don't overthink it. It's just custom for one of my kind to announce ourselves when passing through another's territory…"

"I see."

Sensing the odd tone in Bai Rong's voice, Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes swept over the forest below. After a brief pause, he asked, "This Bifeng Mountain Lord must be a Purple Mansion Realm demon, I presume? What is his background?"

"Well…" Bai Rong fumbled in his robes, pulling out a few fruits to offer him. But he was too slow to change the subject. He had no choice but to answer. "The Bifeng Mountain Lord… is called Can Lufu. He is a descendant of the True Hornless Dragon's nine sons, tracing his lineage back to the Eighth Prince… whose corpse is still stuffed at the bottom of the Vermillion Sea."

"That's why, even though Can Lufu is a Flood Dragon, he never dares venture into the Eastern Sea. He just holes up here in the Southern Borderlands, lording over his domain and colluding with the other great demons. He's an old one."

'Can Lufu…'

The name struck Li Zhouwei like a thunderclap, and he finally understood the source of Bai Rong's discomfort.

'The Demon King of the Southern Borderlands, the peak Purple Mansion Realm Bifeng Mountain Lord, Can Lufu.'

'It was he who refined my own ancestor…'

Bai Rong knew full well that one of Li Tongya's own brothers had been refined by Can Lufu, which was why he had immediately tried to put distance between them and the demon's territory. Only now that they were far from that mountain range did he dare to speak in detail, his voice low.

"Can Lufu is a great demon on the same level as my master. He was also an ally of Chi Wei's back in the day… As a descendant of the Eighth Prince, he is incredibly powerful."

Li Zhouwei watched the mountains recede into the distance, etching the name of the Bifeng Mountain Lord into his memory. His tone, however, betrayed no emotion. "Is his true form an Azurewater Flood Dragon?"

"Indeed." Seeing his calm demeanor, Bai Rong let out a sigh of relief. "If the dragon lineage hadn't disowned him, he might be calling himself a Dragon King by now. He's also skilled in alchemy, which gives him some influence in the Southern Borderlands."

"Four hundred years ago, he was already at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm… Around that time, he led an attack on the newly established Azure Pond Sect. Chi Wei must have met him then."

Li Zhouwei committed this to memory. Bai Rong tried to placate him. "It was hundreds of years ago… Let it be… Can Lufu is an ancient demon, a true powerhouse among Purple Mansion cultivators. Even my master would be no match for him."

Li Zhouwei smiled and nodded in agreement. Only then did Bai Rong truly relax. He pointed at the distant forests and patted his chest. "Ordinary cultivators have to go by way of the Eastern Sea to reach the Southern Sea, but you won't need to. In the future, if you wish to come here, you can just ride the wind straight through. If any of those mountain lords or valley generals try to stop you, just swat them aside!"

Li Zhouwei said softly, "Wouldn't that offend them?"

"Of course not!" Bai Rong laughed heartily. "You saw it yourself. Did a single minor demon we passed not call us 'Elder'? These lesser demons who have gained sentience have no hope of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm; they're nothing but errand runners. And that's only because I'm of the fox tribe. If you were a tiger or a leopard, you could snatch one up and command it at will."

The ocean gradually appeared on the horizon, dispelling the oppressive atmosphere. Bai Rong's mood brightened. The waters of the Southern Sea were a deeper hue, and the climate was hot. The great continent of Lufang was already in sight, its trees a shade of dark green, soaring into the clouds.

But Bai Rong veered eastward. The seawater slowly turned a shade of turquoise, a clear sign they had reached the Vermillion Sea.

The Vermillion lay at the southernmost edge of the Eastern Sea and the eastern edge of the Southern Sea. True to his lazy nature, Bai Rong stopped at its border. He casually grabbed a passing minor demon, dispatched it to inform the sea patrols, and then turned his cart back around.

"That Dingjiao fellow will find his own way here. We'll go on ahead."

He steered the cart back on its windy course. Li Zhouwei gazed out at the landscape. The eastern part of the Lufang continent was dotted with countless islands, yet they were sparsely populated. Though covered in dense jungle, he saw no cultivators flying about.

'How different from the East Sea.'

In the East Sea, not a single island would be left vacant. Who would let such prime real estate go to waste as they did here in the Southern Sea? Bai Rong glanced at him and explained quietly, "In the Southern Sea, cultivators build their immortal caves and manors at the bottom of the ocean. These islands are the private gardens of major powers, protected by formidable formations. They're used for cultivating spiritual resources, gathering Qi, and converging spiritual veins…"

"As for mortals, they live on the large continents like Lufang and Songzhou. They're scattered about, but the continents themselves are probably as large as the Yue State."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding. The floor of the Southern Sea was not occupied by the dragon lineage, making it vastly more expansive than the surface. It was a world unto itself, so there was no need to live on the islands.

Furthermore, the Southern Sea's connection to the mainland was not as strong as the Eastern Sea's. The Southern Borderlands stood as a massive barrier. To gather Qi from the mainland, one would have to cross nearly the entire Vermillion Sea—a journey fraught with unimaginable danger. This made preserving the local islands for Qi gathering all the more critical.

"Further south is Danrong Wuluo, a region with a high concentration of Buddhist and demonic cultivators…"

The name Danrong Wuluo jogged Li Zhouwei's memory. Li Qinghong had once mentioned that a certain elder of their clan was cultivating there… an illegitimate son from Li Yuanqin's generation, if he recalled correctly.

'Once this business with the dragon lineage is settled, I should make a trip to Danrong Wuluo to meet this elder… I wonder if he knows that the family's patriarch has fallen.'

Li Zhouwei and Bai Rong traveled for the better part of a day, heading deep into the sea. Ahead of them lay a vast expanse of white seabed, dotted with coral, glowing as brightly as if it were daytime. A dense network of houses and streets spread across it, bearing a striking resemblance to the Tailend Kingdom of old.

A thin, shimmering barrier enveloped the seabed, marking it as a marketplace. Bai Rong, his eyes alight with excitement, immediately put away the cart, threw on a cloak, and descended toward the city.

Li Zhouwei followed him down. The market's grand formation served only to part the seawater. As they passed through it, no one came to greet them. The streets were bustling with people moving to and fro.

"Let's look around. The dragon lineage will be here within three hours at most!"

Bai Rong eagerly looked around, buying shells here and coral there. The cloak he wore concealed both his cultivation level and the fact that he was a demon, allowing him to move through the crowd like a fish in water.

Li Zhouwei wandered about more casually. He first bought a map. The vendor, seeing his Foundation Establishment cultivation, presented the item and then scrambled away, not even daring to accept the spirit shells offered in payment.

Li Zhouwei studied the map for a moment. "What a coincidence. This is the Miao Family's territory!"

According to the map, the Miao Family's domain was immense, ranking them among the top powers in the Southern Sea. Even the Zhulei Market they were in, and the Zhulei Cave beneath their feet, belonged to the Miao.

'Thunder arts truly are a powerful tool… Most cultivators in the Southern Sea practice demonic arts, all of which are suppressed by thunder arts to some degree. Though the Miao Family's direct lineage isn't large, their territory is vast. The advantage thunder arts have over demonic arts is simply too great!'

He glanced around. Nearly everyone he saw was a demonic cultivator, and items made from blood essence were everywhere. Looking closer, he noticed that nine out of ten of these items were refined from demons. Pills made from humans were so expensive as to be completely unattainable.

'The Southern Sea has few people but many cultivators—a mix of Buddhist, demonic, immortal, and shamanic practitioners. Humans are a rare commodity here… The major demonic arts have all been modified over time to use demons as sustenance.'

He took another look around and noticed many mortals moving through the market, smiling and addressing cultivators as "lord." In a corner, two children were chattering away, casually discussing the divine abilities of Purple Mansion cultivators.

It dawned on him in an instant.

'The mortals of the Southern Sea live within underwater formations, and most of them are related to cultivators in some way… On one hand, their population is small, so their lives are not in peril. On the other hand, their connections to cultivators protect them from being harvested.'

The land in the Southern Sea was nothing like the mainland. In Jiangnan, an acre of land could support a family. Even the laziest farmer could simply toss seeds on the ground and not worry about food. This abundance was what sustained the yearly losses of the Three Sects and Seven Gates.

The Eastern Sea also had few people and many cultivators, but it received a massive influx of spiritual grain and blood essence from the northern and southern cultivators of the mainland, so it was of little concern. The Southern Sea was in a much more difficult position. Aside from a few large continents, the rest of the mortals could only survive in underwater formations, living side-by-side with cultivators.

'So… the Southern Sea, renowned throughout the world for its demonic cultivators… actually has a remarkably stable social order… Mortals rarely face mortal danger, their lives are closely intertwined with cultivators, they have a clear understanding of cultivation, and their role is to serve the cultivators…'

A sarcastic smile touched his lips. 'The people of the Buddhist lands are sallow and gaunt, hoping for death from the moment they are born. The common folk under the Immortal Sects are ignorant and unenlightened, waiting quietly to be culled. Yet here, in this southern demonic sea, people know why they live and why they will die. The Great Dao of cultivation is right beside them.'

As the lord of his own lake, Li Zhouwei was no stranger to the complexities of human nature. He had always heard that the Southern Sea was overrun with demonic cultivators, but seeing it with his own eyes, the discrepancy sparked a revelation. He immediately came to a realization.

'But these people only refrain from preying on humans because there are too few to be worth the trouble… They were forced to capture demons for alchemy, and it gradually became a habit. If they ever had the chance to go to the mainland or the Eastern Sea, where humans are as common as gold, they would likely be more ferocious killers than anyone.'

He was silently observing the Southern Sea's extreme system of cohabitation between immortals and mortals, looking for something he could adapt for his own use, when Bai Rong returned, his arms laden with shells and coral. He picked out a glittering blue conch and pressed it into Li Zhouwei's hands with a grin.

"I have many little foxes back in my cave. It's not often I get to go out, so I have to bring them back some treasures. I couldn't leave you out!"

Li Zhouwei accepted it with a small smile. The conch was merely an Embryonic Breathing-level artifact, capable of stirring the seawater a bit. He thanked the fox, not wanting to refuse the kind gesture, and tucked it into his robes.

Bai Rong beamed, humming contentedly. He leaned in and whispered, "My great-grandmother told me that when she came to the Southern Sea back in her day, there weren't so many demonic arts and blood-essence techniques. This area was quite desolate. It was only after the Miao Family rose to power that demonic arts suddenly proliferated throughout the entire sea—and high-quality ones at that."

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei immediately sensed something unusual. He frowned. "I had heard that the Southern Sea has long been known as a sea overrun by demonic cultivators…"

Bai Rong scoffed. "A long time ago, while they were demonic arts, they were just common, low-grade stuff. There were also plenty of wood, earth, and water-based cultivation methods… There were even several immortal sects. Now, you can't find a single one. And isn't that the Miao Family's handiwork!"

Putting the pieces together, Li Zhouwei finally understood how the Miao Family had established their immense power in the Southern Sea.

'What a ruthless method. Disseminate high-grade demonic arts in a place like the Eastern or Southern Sea, where everyone is struggling to survive… Once those arts take root, things are no longer so simple…'

'Nearly half of all demonic arts don't even require one to gather Qi… as long as one consumes enough blood essence.'

'The Miao Family controlled the thunder-art cultivation methods and Qi-gathering techniques, allowing them to rest easy. Then, they spread various convenient, low-barrier, and fast-cultivating demonic arts across their vast domain. This immediately squeezed out all other cultivation methods until no one practiced them anymore…'

'Then, their own direct descendants could rely on their abundant resources to cultivate thunder arts. When they went out, which of them couldn't completely dominate their opponents?'

He shook his head, thinking, 'No wonder they say the Miao Family is a clan of thunder arts, yet also people of the demonic path. Whether they themselves consume blood essence or not, I don't know… but this single strategy reveals the depths of their cunning.'

As Li Zhouwei was pondering this, Bai Rong began to mutter again. "Kid, the demonic calamity in Jiangnan mostly originated from the Blood Asura Scripture, and that technique also belongs to the Miao Family… The Golden Feather Sect borrowed it from them… That Golden Feather Sect… they're all a bunch of schemers too. Just look at their rise to power. They're now the unrivaled leader of the Three Sects, and the Seven Gates fear them like tigers. That alone shows how formidable they are!"

Li Zhouwei understood immediately from his words. 'He's giving me a roundabout warning…'

The Golden Feather Sect didn't actually have any major conflicts with his family; in fact, their relationship was quite good. The Li family had gathered Qi in the great desert for many years without anyone daring to disturb them, which Li Zhouwei was certain wouldn't have happened without the Golden Feather Sect's tacit approval.

Furthermore, it was rumored that Li Tongya and Zhang Yun were good friends, and the disciples of the Golden Feather Sect had always been polite to the Li family…

But Bai Rong had given the warning, and Li Zhouwei could only take it to heart. He said humbly, "This junior will remember!"

Bai Rong glanced at him, seemingly worried his pointed words might have caused offense. He asked a few cheerful questions, but just then, a roar echoed from the sea. Turquoise waves surged, and the clanking of iron chains rang out.

*BOOM!*

A colossal Azurewater Scaled-Beast slowly materialized above the seabed. A resplendent and luxurious palace floated in the ocean, its immense black shadow swiftly blanketing the entire marketplace. Even the luminous pearls that lit the city dimmed.

The cultivators in the streets all looked up, staring dumbfounded at the scene in the water above. The sound of a conch horn boomed, and a familiar cry echoed from the sea:

"The Clear Seas and Serene Pools Azure Dragon Prince's honored chariot is here—"



# Chapter 670: A Plea for Some Respite

'Dingjiao really puts on a show…'

The entire street beside Li Zhouwei was now cast in shadow. A crowd of cultivators scattered in all directions, fleeing beyond the grand array. In an instant, the area was empty. Bai Rong muttered, "This Dragon Prince..."

The surroundings were in an uproar as people fled. The two mortal children from before had long since vanished. Before Bai Rong could finish his sentence, a silver-white bolt of lightning leaped out from the marketplace. It danced across the ocean a few times before flying toward the Azurewater Scaled-Beast, and a man's resonant, powerful voice called out:

"Miao Ye of Thunder Island pays his respects to the Dragon Prince of the Clear Seas and Serene Pools, Inheritor of the Azure!"

Li Zhouwei had met this man before. He had come to Moongaze Lake years ago demanding the Duruo Spear. His strength was considerable, and after some private inquiries about his ancestors, Li Zhouwei learned he was now stationed in the Southern Sea.

Miao Ye placed his hands on his knees and knelt in the water. He withdrew his hands, went down on one knee, and bowed three times in succession, his gaze lowered, too terrified to speak.

Li Zhouwei activated his ocular art, his vision exceptionally sharp. He could see that the one cracking a whip atop the Azurewater Scaled-Beast was a demon general with bulging gills and black armor. His expression was foul. He flicked the long whip and barked, "This has nothing to do with you! Get to the side and wait!"

Miao Ye looked as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He stepped aside and stood by, ordering someone to bring up a meal of blood-food. The black-armored demon general shouted them away, saying impatiently, "The Dragon Monarch's birthday is approaching! No blood is to be seen in the Eastern Sea. Take that foul stuff away. If the master sees it, there's no telling what trouble you'll be in!"

The Dragon Monarch's birthday was still half a month away. How could Miao Ye not know this? Why else would he have brought up blood-food? It was clear the other party was just looking for a reason to berate him. He bowed and scraped, thanking the general for the reminder, and waited respectfully to the side.

Miao Ye repeatedly apologized. Bai Rong and Li Zhouwei watched as they made their way out of the marketplace. The fox sneered. The area around them was now completely empty; all the cultivators had cleared out.

Li Zhouwei exited the water barrier and looked around. The surrounding waters were murky. The vast, yellowish-green seabed had once been covered in coral and seagrass, with glowing yellow spiritual objects nestled beneath. Now, it was nothing but turbid sand and stone, likely swept away by a violent squall.

"The Miao Family only harvests these things once every few decades, and now they're all gone..."

The dragon race was known for its domineering nature, but there was no need to humiliate the Miao Family so thoroughly. Li Zhouwei found it a bit puzzling. Bai Rong looked at him with a smile and whispered, "Thunder Island once obtained a treasure that the dragon race valued greatly. Both the Black Dragon and White Dragon lineages sent people to trade for it. After much deliberation, the Miao Family gave it to the envoy of the Black Dragon lineage..."

Bai Rong looked a little gleeful, relishing their misfortune. "They had to offend one side or the other, and the White Dragon lineage was thoroughly disgusted. Naturally, Dingjiao wouldn't have a good attitude on his way here. Miao Ye knows this full well and is terrified of giving him any excuse. He's completely stressed out."

Li Zhouwei finally understood. He asked, "What kind of treasure was it? The dragon race is the master of the Eastern Sea's riches. What could possibly make them compete for it?"

"Radiant Profound Origin!"

As soon as Bai Rong said the name, Li Zhouwei understood. "So it was for the sake of dragon heirs."

The Radiant Profound Origin was just an ordinary Purple Mansion Realm spiritual object, nothing special to the dragon race. However, it happened to have the effect of aiding childbirth, which made it incredibly valuable.

The two of them had now arrived before the Azurewater Scaled-Beast. Miao Ye still stood with his head bowed, not daring to move. He might have recognized Li Zhouwei, but the respectful expression on his face didn't waver in the slightest, and his aura remained calm.

'He's a man of deep cunning.'

Li Zhouwei noted him with a glance. The black-armored demon general approached with a smiling face, put away his whip, and said, "My lords, this way please..."

Bai Rong walked swiftly into the hall with him. Behind them, everything instantly dissolved into infinite, swirling waves of azure and blue, churning into a maelstrom. It was clear the Azurewater Scaled-Beast was on the move. Li Zhouwei steadied himself and heard a clear, bright laugh.

"Fellow Daoists!"

Standing in the center of the hall was a youth with white horns. His robes were embroidered with waves and flood dragons, and his light blue eyes looked over with a smile. He took a step forward in his golden boots, and Dingjiao announced in a clear voice, "Dingjiao, White Flood Dragon of the Clear Seas and Serene Pools, Inheritor of the Azure, greets you, fellow Daoist."

This greeting was clearly directed at Bai Rong. The fox flicked his pale green and white sleeves, and his voice, light and melodious, adopted a tone completely different from before as he replied, "Bai Rong, the Plain-Hearted Fox of Moongaze Lake, pays respects to the Crown Prince."

"Excellent..." Dingjiao laughed heartily, appearing to be in high spirits. He invited the two to be seated, then feigned surprise and said, "So, Bai Rong is a Plain-Hearted Fox, with a bloodline so close to the Lord of Mount Dali! I have been neglectful. Had I known your identity, fellow Daoist, I should have come out of the hall to welcome you. The fault is mine."

"Your Highness jests."

Bai Rong, with his slender eyes and handsome features, sat holding his wine cup. His tone was soft and graceful, his smile perfectly composed—a stark contrast to his usual playful demeanor. He said tactfully, "I was fortunate to receive the grace of the Mountain Lord's blood pool, which tempered my very nature and allowed me to be reborn. I am unworthy of such ceremony."

Dingjiao looked as if he had just realized something. He nodded and clapped his hands lightly. "Then your fortune is profound indeed," he said softly.

The two exchanged a few more cordial words before Dingjiao turned his attention back to Li Zhouwei, his expression growing serious. "Minghuang, I was in the wrong last time for neglecting you. Now that this matter has come to fruition, I am deeply grateful and will not forget it."

What Li Zhouwei wanted was a favor from the dragon race, not their spiritual artifacts. That spiritual ring of the Bright Yang path was certainly powerful, but it wasn't something he could use. He shook his head and said, "Your Highness is too kind. It was all thanks to Senior Bai Rong's assistance. I cannot take the credit."

The three of them chatted for a while. Bai Rong revealed a side of himself completely unlike before, demonstrating great social grace. He told a few eloquent stories, lavishing praise on Dongfang Heyun several times. Dingjiao listened with a smile, and both host and guests were pleased.

The Azurewater Scaled-Beast moved with incredible speed. Time passed as Li Zhouwei listened to the other two converse. Finally, he felt a slight tremor, and a demon general with long whiskers came forward to report, "Reporting to my lords, we have arrived at the Grave Abyss."

Dingjiao rose and began to walk, guiding the two of them as he spoke softly, "Minghuang, you may not be familiar with this place. Let me explain. We are south of the Southern Sea, in a place called the Grave Abyss."

The group flew up from the scaled beast. Before them lay a vast, empty expanse of sand. Stone islands of various sizes were scattered in a radial pattern around a colossal abyss in the center. Gazing into the distance, they couldn't see the other side of the chasm.

The islands on both sides of the abyss were fractured and broken, some as large as cities, others as small as houses, stretching out as far as the eye could see. Seawater flowed into the great chasm through a spiderweb of fine channels, and below was infinite darkness.

Dingjiao gazed into the depths and said quietly, "Before the great celestial shift, this place was a continent as vast as Jiangnan, but sparsely populated. While Jiangnan had a hundred million people back then, this place had no more than ten million."

"During the celestial shift... two Immortal Lords fought here, shattering the entire continent. The spiritual qi vanished, and to this day, no living creatures can survive here. My dragon race calls it the 'Grave Abyss'... it is the counterpart to the 'World's Navel' in the Eastern Sea."

Bai Rong nodded. It seemed to be his first time here as well. He looked around with great interest and said softly, "I've heard that because there is no spiritual qi here, the Great Void does not exist. Even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators must descend and fly normally..."

"Correct." Dingjiao said softly, "This place extends all the way to the Netherworld, where the Underworld is located. It is said that the officials of the Underworld use this as an entrance and exit."

As he spoke, he descended silently. The three of them were quickly swallowed by the infinite darkness. Li Zhouwei watched the seawater cascading down on both sides, frowned, and murmured, "This Grave Abyss is terrifyingly vast. How has the water of the Southern Sea not been drained dry? It's hundreds of times larger than the celestial hole in the Northern Sea. Even if the entire Southern Sea rained down, it wouldn't be enough to fill it..."

"Could it be like the corner of the sea, where the water falls into the depths and immediately returns to the ocean as water veins?"

Dingjiao shook his head and explained, "The seawater doesn't fall into the Grave Abyss from all directions. This area is just one inlet. If you were to fly south for a while, you'd find the ground is higher than the sea level, and no water is falling."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding and added a word of caution, "There's no spiritual qi here. We'll be in trouble if we run out of dharma power..."

"Don't worry." Dingjiao took out some white pearls from his sleeve, considered them for a moment, then put them back. Instead, he produced a black, disc-shaped spiritual artifact. It instantly grew larger, forming a platform beneath their feet. He said apologetically, "My personal mount, Chengyun, is ill-suited for travel within the abyss."

Bai Rong nodded, then asked with some doubt, "But this tale about this abyss leading to the Netherworld... I've never heard it before. After all, we are not familiar with the affairs of the sea. Could Your Highness elaborate?"

He offered a brief apology for his ignorance. Dingjiao waved his hand dismissively and said in a low voice, "This story dates back to the era of the Qi State. The Northern Qi replaced the Wei. The former Wei Crown Prince, Li Xunquan, raised an army and for a time controlled the Long region, which people then called Long Wei. A certain lord from my family was living in Wei at the time and became close friends with someone there. They got along very well."

"Later, a great drought struck the south. The lord went personally to bring rain. When he returned, he found his friend had been murdered. So he traveled all the way here, descended deep into the abyss, flew all the way into the Netherworld, met with a judge of the Underworld, and brought the person back."

Li Zhouwei was stunned at first, then his heart pounded with excitement. He asked in a heavy voice, "So when a person dies, their soul is truly taken to the Underworld, just like in the legends? And they can be brought back?!"

But Dingjiao hesitated. He said quietly, "When a mortal dies, their soul undoubtedly scatters. But I've heard that everyone in the world is registered on the Underworld's lists. If one practices the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, the Underworld even knows their cultivation level and techniques. As for capturing souls... that sort of thing shouldn't happen anymore."

"But..." The fierce hope that had surged in Li Zhouwei's heart was instantly extinguished. He lowered his head, a question unspoken.

Dingjiao replied, "I've inquired about this as well. I heard it was because that person was born before the celestial shift and also practiced the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao... so the Underworld arrested him according to their laws. For those born after the celestial shift, unless they fail when attempting to form a Golden Core, the Underworld doesn't get involved."

Seeing Li Zhouwei's distress, Bai Rong changed the subject. He secretly recalled something and asked softly, "What if an immortal cultivator is not on their list?"

"Not on the list?" Dingjiao glanced at him, shook his head, and smiled. "That would mean they practice the Dao of Shamanic Talismans, or the method of nourishing one's nature by consuming qi!"

The white fox lowered his head thoughtfully. Li Zhouwei, however, was only disappointed for a moment before he composed himself and asked in a low voice, "I have heard the name Li Xunquan. There were constant uprisings in the north back then, and many gained significant traction. There were two attempts by the Wei's Li family to restore their kingdom. Later, there was also a Li Xuan... I just don't know what happened to him afterward."

The Li family had gathered a great deal of information over the years and paid special attention to such matters, but it was impossible to find out more in Jiangnan. It was a rare opportunity to hear about it in the Eastern Sea.

Bai Rong glanced at Dingjiao and said softly, "He was killed by the Qi Emperor. His head was hung over the city of Dianyang and wasn't taken down for nine years."

Dingjiao fell silent. The spiritual artifact beneath their feet bobbed gently. Li Zhouwei's breath caught, his expression darkened, and he stared into the endless blackness.

'What is Dingjiao really trying to do...'

Throughout the journey, Li Zhouwei had come to appreciate Dingjiao's status. This Crown Prince of the White Dragon lineage was likely one of the most distinguished figures in the world.

'The Eastern Sea is vast, and the dragon race commands many Purple Mansion Realm demon beasts. If he truly needed something, couldn't the dragons send a great demon of the Purple Mansion Realm to help him?'

'Leaving aside others, Dongfang Heyun alone is strange enough...'

'Bai Rong is a Foundation Establishment fox demon, and his cultivation method isn't specialized in hearing. Perhaps his bloodline or a few special techniques give him keen senses, but could he really compare to a Purple Mansion expert with their divine abilities?'

'Judging from the attitudes of the two demons... this matter was jointly arranged by the fox and dragon races... What in the world is it, and why did they have to bring me along...'

'Bai Rong said Dingjiao wanted to befriend me... is that why he brought me here? Is there some benefit for me in this...'

He pondered this for a while. They sat in silence for several days. Both Dingjiao and Bai Rong had stopped speaking. Dingjiao was completely quiet, while Bai Rong's expression was intensely focused, his ears twitching slightly.

He slowly stood up, listening for a moment. White fur began to sprout from his skin, and with a shake of his body, he transformed into a pure white fox, without a single blemish.

The fox's two ears stood erect. Surprisingly, a third ear was situated between its brows, triangular in shape with the tip pointing upwards. Viewed from the side, it resembled a white horn, fluffy and exquisitely formed.

Having revealed his true form, Bai Rong crouched on the disc as they continued deeper. Dingjiao remained motionless, watching them quietly. The spiritual artifact flew slower and slower, until it finally came to a stop.

Dingjiao said softly, "There is a sound here. Bai Rong, listen closely. The dharma power in my artifact is running low. If you can't hear it here, we will have to go deeper."

Li Zhouwei couldn't hear a thing; he found the silence around them terrifying. Bai Rong paused, then shook his head. "Please, let's fly a little further."

Silently, Dingjiao urged the artifact forward. They flew for a full half-hour through the pitch-black surroundings, devoid of any light, as if trapped in an endless, oppressive void, before stopping again.

Bai Rong twitched his ears and frowned. "It's a man's voice..."

The fox listened for another quarter of an hour, then said in a low voice, "He's saying..."

Bai Rong seemed uncertain, his expression tense. He lay down again to listen more carefully, then looked stunned. He whispered, "The... chains... burning... hot, beg... something..."

Li Zhouwei's heart tightened upon hearing this. Dingjiao frowned, his voice low and deep as he asked, "Did he say anything else?"

Bai Rong listened again for a while. Dharma power circulated through his body, and a purple glow mixed with mist swirled around him. The white fur on his ears turned a deep violet, strand by strand. After a quarter of an hour, he said quietly, "Nothing else. Just that one sentence."

His expression was one of shock. He paused before continuing, "His voice is at times as high as a tiger's roar, heart-rending, mixed with the sound of coughing up blood. At other times, it's as sharp as a mouse's squeak, piercing enough to shatter stone. It's utterly terrifying."

"He is saying..."

"The Dharma chains are scorching hot, and bind too tightly. I beg for some relief."

Dingjiao's eyebrows shot up, his expression a mixture of cold fury and shock. He was silent for a moment, then took a jade bottle from his sleeve, placed it in his palm, and said in a low voice, "Plain-Hearted Fox, keep listening."



# Chapter 671: Inquiry

Dingjiao spoke in a low voice. Bai Rong glanced at him, a flicker of hesitation in his eyes. After all, some things were not meant to be heard by just anyone. "Your Highness," he whispered, "do you have any information? This place is strange. If the one below has too powerful a background, we could break a serious taboo."

'So Bai Rong doesn't know who it is either…'

Of the three, he was the one who had to personally listen. If anything went wrong, Bai Rong would be the first to suffer. Dingjiao naturally understood his concerns and kept his voice low. "Don't worry. An elder once mentioned it. The person below is not a Golden Core cultivator. If a Golden Core master were crying out in pain, how could we possibly still be alive? Uncle Heyun would have appeared to warn us long ago…"

Bai Rong's greatest fear was a Golden Core cultivator. Listening in on the affairs of an ordinary Purple Mansion expert wouldn't pose much of a threat to a Plain-Hearted Fox like him, but once a Golden Core was involved, even the powerful figure backing him might not be able to protect him.

"The fact that Uncle Heyun hasn't shown himself means there is no danger here." Dingjiao softly reassured them both. He put away the jade bottle in his palm, revealing a bright white stone pearl underneath.

The stone pearl was a milky white, inscribed with three faint yellow lines. It was shrouded in a soft glow, devoid of any spectacular radiance. Dingjiao explained, "This place is so deep that even a Purple Mansion cultivator can't probe its bottom. The further down you go, the thicker the malevolent qi becomes. An ordinary Purple Mansion expert coming here would only hear a single shout. That's why I made a special trip to retrieve this ancient spiritual artifact."

"This once belonged to the Jixian Immortal Dao. It's called the Yinqi's Earthen Word. It's been stored in my residence for a long time; it's rare that I have a use for it."

Hearing of its grand origins, Bai Rong couldn't help but steal a glance, his expression tinged with envy. "An ancient spiritual artifact of the Earth Virtue path is a true rarity," he said softly. "The Jixian Immortal Dao was supremely powerful. Only a dragon prince like Your Highness would have such a thing in his collection."

Dingjiao seemed slightly embarrassed. He lifted his chin, his twin dragon horns emitting a faint light, almost the only source of illumination in the entire abyss. "The Earth Virtue path is formidable," he replied, "but this item is too ancient. In that era, cultivators didn't forge artifacts with combat as the priority; mystical function came first. This thing is of little use in a fight."

Bai Rong looked somewhat puzzled, but Dingjiao didn't elaborate. He casually tossed the stone pearl, and it began to spin in mid-air. A murky yellow light immediately emerged from it. Li Zhouwei frowned slightly, but Dingjiao remained silent.

The murky yellow light flowed in a circle, sweeping across the stone wall like a shadow. Wherever it passed, the earth and stone trembled and rustled. Dingjiao's voice was low as he chanted an obscure and unintelligible mantra.

With a crackle, a mouth no bigger than a palm split open on the adjacent stone wall. It had distinct lips and teeth, and a thick, buzzing voice emerged from it.

The voice was hoarse, like the grinding of stones, deep and layered. It sounded ancient and hesitant, but offered no further reaction. Bai Rong watched thoughtfully and chuckled. "Jixian Immortals, after all."

Dingjiao waited a moment longer before giving up. He passed the stone pearl over with a smile. "Minghuang, this artifact can hear the speech of the earth and make stones speak on our behalf. But the Jixian Immortals were the leaders of the immortal dao, and this spiritual artifact has too much pride; it won't accept my demon power. You do it."

'How interesting.'

Li Zhouwei finally understood their reactions. He gently took the pearl and infused it with his dharma power. The pearl instantly brightened severalfold, becoming much more animated. The mouth on the stone wall called out eagerly, "Greetings, my lord!"

Li Zhouwei swept his spiritual sense over it and nodded. "Are you the spirit of this wall?"

The stone wall replied respectfully, "Replying to my lord... it is indeed this humble spirit, awaiting the celestial decree of your lordships."

"Good." Dingjiao nodded in satisfaction and gave his instructions. "Go down and take a look. Report back what you find... and remember, you are not to listen or look. Just speak as commanded. I fear a single glance or sound might shatter what little divine power you have, and I'd have to summon you again."

"Thank you, esteemed immortal."

The minor spirit within the stone wall expressed its thanks, and the mouth immediately slid down the wall. Li Zhouwei offered a word of praise, glancing at the Yinqi's Earthen Word in his hand. He noticed the stone pearl was simple and unadorned, not looking at all like an ancient spiritual artifact.

Meanwhile, Bai Rong's ears twitched. He formed a seal, preparing to cast a spell. On high alert, he began to chant in a low voice, each word like a soft sob, grating and sharp.

Soon, a purple radiance flew from his fine fur, flitting like sparrows and flowing around their ears. Li Zhouwei suddenly felt his hearing clear, and a cacophony of sound emerged, coming from a distance, rising and falling.

"Bound... too tightly, I beg... for some relief!"

Bai Rong's description had not been an exaggeration. The voice was heart-wrenching, a continuous howl of agony, as if the speaker were suffering the ultimate torture, wanting to scream his very heart out.

With everyone at their posts, Dingjiao finally focused his mind and spoke softly, "Who are you?"

All sound by Li Zhouwei's ears ceased abruptly. The mournful cry was finally cut off, replaced by a silence so profound it was unnerving.

A dozen breaths passed before a shriek that could shatter metal and stone erupted, shaking the entire abyss. The man's voice was as sharp as a ghost's wail. "Who are *you*? Where is Yao Chenlin? Where is Yao Chenlin?! I beg... for some relief! I beg... for some relief!"

The force of the cry made Bai Rong grunt. Li Zhouwei felt the Yinqi's Earthen Word in his hand suddenly grow heavy; the stone pearl, which had been steadily drawing his dharma power, abruptly severed its connection. Dingjiao's face went pale.

*Pop!*

A faint noise sounded by their ears. Li Zhouwei was only supplying the power; the artifact was still under Dingjiao's control. He saw Dingjiao frown and knew without needing to be told: the minor spirit must have been destroyed by the psychic shock.

Without a word, Dingjiao summoned another mouth from the opposite wall, gave it its instructions, and sent it down. His tone was somewhat grim. "There is no Great Void here. Not only does it take a great deal of dharma power to summon a mountain spirit each time, but I also have to instruct it all over again..."

Bai Rong was doing his best to regulate his breathing, his expression complicated. "He might be at the bottom of the abyss, an unknown distance from here, yet the moment Your Highness asked, he was able to instantly send his roar back up with his dharma power! In just a few breaths! That level of strength..."

Dingjiao had clearly thought of this as well, his brow deeply furrowed. Bai Rong pondered for a moment before continuing, "I'm afraid my master couldn't do that. Perhaps only my grand-matriarch could even try..."

When cultivators like Xiao Chuting attained the Purple Mansion Realm, they could instantly transmit their voices over thousands of miles, but that was by using the Great Void. Anyone who achieved divine abilities could do it; it wasn't particularly difficult. But there was no Great Void here. For this person to project his voice all the way up relying on raw dharma power alone was something else entirely.

The group waited for a while before Dingjiao spoke again. "Who might you be, sir?"

After a few breaths, the man's voice indeed sounded by their ears again. This time it was much calmer, his tone hoarse and powerful, yet laced with the sounds of gritted teeth and coughing blood.

"...I am Li Xunquan."

Bai Rong was stunned. Dingjiao looked up. Beside them, Li Zhouwei's eyes widened slightly. The voice struck his heart like a great bell.

'The former Crown Prince of Wei, Li Xunquan!'

The one bound at the bottom of this abyss was the former Crown Prince of Wei, Li Xunquan, whose head had hung over the city of Dianyang for nine years!

Li Zhouwei's eyes flew open, his golden pupils fixed on Bai Rong and Dingjiao. Both demons wore expressions of shock that did not seem feigned. An emotion flashed across his own face, followed by a torrent of questions.

'Is this the real Li Xunquan or an imposter…'

'If Li Xunquan was killed at Dianyang, why is he here... and who did this…'

'What is the dragon race's intention!'

The thoughts flashed through his mind like lightning. Dingjiao glanced at him and said in a low voice, "Li Xunquan? My name is Dongfang Dingjiao. My grandfather is Dongfang You... Who bound you here?"

The voice from below paused, trembling with the effort of enduring excruciating pain. It cried out hoarsely, "Uncle? The pain is unbearable... I beg you, Uncle, loosen them for me!"

Li Zhouwei listened in silence. Li Xunquan had clearly only heard half the sentence and mistaken him for Dongfang You. Dingjiao looked vexed. He asked several more questions, but no matter what he asked, the man only fixated on the loosening of his bonds.

After a full quarter of an hour, Dongfang Dingjiao tried again. "What is it that binds you? How long have you been here?"

Li Xunquan seemed to have reached the limit of his endurance. His voice became a sharp shriek that pierced their ears. "The Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope... Where is Yao Chenlin?! Loosen this rope for me!"

"Hmph..."

Dongfang Dingjiao grunted, his brow furrowed. The mountain spirit had evidently been destroyed again. An endless wail of agony rose from below. Li Zhouwei remained silent throughout, watching quietly.

The white flood dragon paused, then said softly, "My power is running low. Let's go up for now."

As he finished speaking, the spiritual artifact beneath their feet began to rise. Bai Rong withdrew his divine ability, and all the noise and cries of pain vanished from their ears. Li Zhouwei cast his gaze into the endless depths of the abyss.

Dingjiao seemed somewhat somber. "Minghuang," he said in a low voice, "I had only heard that there was something unusual here, that an elder was imprisoned underground. The clan never spoke of it, so I decided to take a look. I never imagined it would be him..."

Strictly speaking, Dongfang You and Emperor Gong of Wei were friends. Dingjiao's father, the Dragon King, would have to address Emperor Gong as 'uncle', which meant Dingjiao should, at the very least, call Li Xunquan 'uncle' as well. The relationship was only a generation or two removed, making them quite close—he fully qualified as an elder.

Though friendships often fade when people are gone, Dongfang Dingjiao had only brought up the connection to get closer to Li Zhouwei; it wasn't a tangible favor. But Li Xunquan was different... the former crown prince might have even had pleasant conversations with Dongfang You in the past.

Therefore, Dingjiao's mood was now very complicated. Though he had been mentally prepared, seeing this scene still stirred his emotions. The prince had rarely suffered any setbacks in his life, let alone been powerless while an elder was imprisoned deep underground. He said in a muffled voice, "His mind is already gone... He can only react to a few names. He must have been tortured for a very long time."

Bai Rong, having expended the most demon power, was a little listless. He murmured, "It has been fifteen hundred years since the fall of the Wei's Li dynasty. His head hung in Dianyang for nine years. He was probably captured and brought here right after. Fifteen hundred years of agony... no one could withstand that!"

Of the two demons, Bai Rong's words were pure sentiment, whereas Dingjiao felt a genuine, indignant sorrow. The dragon prince said coldly, "Although the Qi Emperor was cruel and vicious, the Jie clan had at least received Emperor Gong's favor. He only killed my uncle and his partisans, hanging his head in Dianyang. Even privately, he was unwilling or unable to kill my uncle. He would never torture him in a place like this. Besides, the Qi Kingdom was destroyed by the Tuoba family long ago…"

"The one who imprisoned him here must be a major immortal Dao power in the north today, one that was at odds with the Wei's Li family, and one that covets the Bright Yang!"

Bai Rong's heart pounded with fear as he listened. He screamed internally, 'This kid isn't stupid! By being so specific, you've practically spelled out the name of Mount Luoxia! Dingjiao, oh, Dingjiao…'

Bai Rong knew that the relationship between Mount Luoxia and the dragon race, and indeed the entire demon race, was far from good. His own Mount Dali had suffered its share of setbacks at their hands. But Mount Luoxia was protected by a Dao Embryo; it was not a lineage one could speak of so casually!

How could Li Zhouwei not understand? The state of Zhao was now merely a plaything for Buddhist cultivators. The major immortal Dao powers in the north could be counted on one hand; you could guess the name just by thinking about it. Although he filed the information away, he couldn't properly respond. He only asked in a grave tone, "Your Highness, the affairs of Wei, Qi, Liang, and Zhao are rarely recorded in the south and are difficult to discern... What Dao did the Qi Emperor cultivate?"

Li Zhouwei knew quite a bit by now. At his question, Dingjiao sighed. "The Qi Emperor, Shi Chang, cultivated 'Dawn Qi', which is complementary to 'Lesser Yang'. They have always been intrinsically linked. This Dao can transform Bright Yang into Lesser Yang... which fits the situation perfectly."

Bai Rong, hearing this, feared Dingjiao was about to mention Mount Luoxia again. He quickly interjected, "Isn't that right. The sun can be divided into Lesser Yang, which gives birth to Dawn Qi, and Dawn Qi can in turn transform Bright Yang into Lesser Yang. The Dao of mutual generation lies therein."

Li Zhouwei committed this to memory. Since his own cultivation was of the Bright Yang, he would have to be wary if he ever encountered a practitioner of Radiant Essence in the future. He then saw Dingjiao clasp his hands behind his back and say softly, "Thank you both. This matter can be considered to have a conclusion. Although it's not entirely satisfactory, I now have a clearer picture."

Dingjiao observed their reactions, knowing his earlier words had been understood. He didn't spell it out further, merely nodding slightly. The spiritual artifact beneath their feet flew faster and faster, transforming into a white shadow as it shot upwards. Dingjiao said softly, "However, the matter within this abyss is a secret, and not a glorious one. I must ask you both to keep this information confidential, for your own sakes as well."

"Of course."

Li Zhouwei and Bai Rong agreed. Dingjiao smiled. "Rest assured, there is no Great Void here, and I chose a special day to come. Cultivators within the seas cannot divine the affairs of my dragon race today. Besides, those lineages are arrogant and usually ignore matters within or outside the seas, let alone try to scry our movements."

The meaning behind his words was now even clearer: he was telling them not to worry. Bai Rong smiled and nodded, while Li Zhouwei began to ponder his words.

'A special day…'

Li Zhouwei paused for a moment, then immediately understood. A quick mental calculation brought a flash of admiration.

'It's the Dragon Monarch's birthday!'

When Li Zhouwei and the others had gone to Thunder Island, they had happened to hear Miao Ye and his men mention the Dragon Monarch's birthday. At the time, Li Zhouwei had asked Bai Rong, who said it was still about half a month away.

'And with all the time we've spent, it's been exactly twelve days. The time we spent at the bottom of the abyss just now was precisely the second day of the second month of the season!'

He glanced at Dingjiao. Bai Rong was also silent. Li Zhouwei understood completely.

'The fox clan of Mount Li also knew this was the most suitable day... That's why Bai Rong was in such a hurry. The travel time of the Azurewater Scaled-Beast was calculated in advance. It seemed like Dingjiao came and went as he pleased, but that couldn't be further from the truth…'



# Chapter 672: The Dragon and the Fox

The two demons and one human emerged from the Grave Abyss and descended into the sea. They passed over a scattering of shattered, desolate islands, all of them utterly devoid of life.

Even the Western Mountains at Moongaze Lake, for all their lack of spiritual energy, at least supported the growth of mortal plants. This place, however, was nothing but barren sand and rock, without even common vegetation.

But Li Zhouwei saw more than just the surface. 'This place may be barren,' he thought, 'but it's also free from the influence of the Great Void. An excellent place to evade the prying senses of a Purple Mansion cultivator. A pity it's useless for cultivation.'

The long-bearded demon waited off to the side. Dongfang Dingjiao, in no mood for conversation, simply piloted his spiritual artifact past him. The Azurewater Scaled-Beasts lay quiescent on the seabed, resembling a living mountain range of glittering scales. As Dingjiao's party approached, a black-armored demon who had been waiting for them scurried over to greet them.

"My lords!"

It was clear Dongfang Dingjiao had no interest in speaking with him, and the demon, sensing his master’s foul mood, became as meek as a lamb. With a wave of his hand, Dingjiao dismissed him, and the demon hurried off to ready the beasts.

Dingjiao landed before the main hall, flicked his sleeves, and let out a long breath. A smile finally graced his features.

"Please," he said softly.

The trio entered the hall to find someone already standing inside. His sleeves were perfectly neat, and a refined smile touched his lips. Seeing them enter, he bowed.

"Greetings, Your Highness! Greetings, fellow Daoists!"

"Uncle Heyun!" Dingjiao quickly stepped back and offered a respectful bow. The Dragon Prince was all smiles as he said graciously, "Uncle, you are an endlessly busy man. It is a rare honor to have you visit my humble palace!"

Dongfang Heyun returned the bow politely. "I heard Your Highness was visiting this dangerous place, so I came ahead to wait," he said in a gentle voice. "I was following along just now, but I did not wish to disturb your experience, so I remained hidden."

He stayed half a step behind Dongfang Dingjiao, escorting him to the host's seat. Only after the prince and his honored guests were seated did he take a seat to the side. He adjusted his sleeves with a scholarly air.

"After all," he continued softly, "Li Xunquan is a demon who has lived for a millennium. Even bound by the Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope, his mind is not clear, and he might still lash out. This abyss holds many dangers. While Your Highness's draconic might is vast, my concern was for your safety and that of your guests."

"Many thanks, Uncle!" Dongfang Dingjiao beamed at his words.

Bai Rong, meanwhile, was observing Dongfang Heyun with quiet astonishment. 'So this is Dongfang Heyun? Aside from his lack of divine abilities, he seems no different from a Purple Mansion cultivator. No wonder Tuoba Chongyuan's soul was scattered by him. This cloud-dragon could probably hold his own against a Purple Mansion master.'

After a moment, a new suspicion arose in his mind. 'Is he truly not at the Purple Mansion Realm? There is only one cloud-dragon in the entire world—who could possibly gauge his true strength? Perhaps he has already reached that realm, and the Dragon Monarch has simply concealed his divine abilities!'

Dingjiao paused for a moment before asking, "Uncle, I am unfamiliar with the Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope. Could you tell me of it?"

"Oh?" Dongfang Heyun began softly, "The Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope is an artifact belonging to Yao Chenlin. You young ones wouldn't know of it. Its purpose is to erode the will through the world's most extreme pain."

"Pain is no small matter; it is the greatest enemy of the mind. Under prolonged torment, one cannot stop the tears from flowing. Grudges, love, the desire for the Dao… all are forgotten. Only the overwhelming pain remains, and the sole desperate wish is for a single moment of rest."

"That is the function of the Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope." His tone was calm, tinged with an elegance that made his words all the more chilling. "This artifact delights in hearing pleas for mercy. The more one struggles, the tighter it binds, inflicting limitless, bone-cracking agony. Only by howling for mercy can one find a moment's relief. The moment the cries cease, the pain returns a hundredfold. It is a simple method for breaking the will."

"After a thousand years of this," he concluded, "the only thought left in one's mind is that begging brings rest. For Li Xunquan to be able to respond at all speaks to the incredible strength of his will."

"What a vicious treasure..."

As Dongfang Heyun spoke, Dongfang Dingjiao’s brow remained tightly furrowed. His branch of the family had always been the closest to the Wei-Li, and he fell into a deep silence.

Having finished his explanation, Dongfang Heyun took a sip of wine and glanced at Li Zhouwei. "This must be the White Qilin," he smiled.

"Minghuang greets senior," Li Zhouwei replied.

Dongfang Heyun simply nodded, saying nothing more to him. He then turned to the fox. "Please send my regards to your master."

After a few more pleasantries, he excused himself. He bowed before the hall and vanished, but not before giving Li Zhouwei one last, meaningful glance.

With his departure, Dingjiao’s mood improved considerably. He raised his cup to his two guests, then looked in the direction Dongfang Heyun had disappeared, a flicker of delight in his eyes.

The Dragon Princes of the Eastern Sea had always been a privileged few who rarely gave Foundation Establishment cultivators a second thought. But he, Dongfang Dingjiao, had always been more moderate. He treated cultivators like them, and even Dongfang Heyun, with courtesy and respect.

'My other brothers... they treat Uncle Heyun as a mere subordinate, with a mind to command him for every trivial matter. They must be in a difficult position now!'

Naturally, Dongfang Heyun’s attitude toward him was favorable. Had it been any of his other brothers, Heyun might have offered protection, but he certainly wouldn't have appeared personally to share a cup of wine.

'Dongfang Heyun is but one,' he thought, gazing into the distance. 'In the future, there will be Minghuang and Bai Rong...'

He finally turned back to Li Zhouwei, his expression full of pleasure. "Since Minghuang is unwilling to accept an ancient spiritual artifact, I cannot let my friends leave empty-handed! That would be a failure on my part as a host!"

Dongfang Dingjiao clapped his hands lightly. Two demons entered from outside the hall, each carrying a stone box. They walked forward and presented them respectfully.

"My friends," Dingjiao said earnestly, "these, you cannot refuse. Consider it a small token of my hospitality!"

As the stone box was brought before him, Li Zhouwei was already prepared. 'This is what Bai Rong meant when he said Dingjiao wanted to befriend us...'

Dingjiao might not have known the identity of the person in the abyss, but as the one who extended the invitation, he almost certainly knew the prisoner was a victim of Mount Luoxia. He also knew this person was connected to both the dragon lineage and the Wei-Li.

'Why else would he insist I come? How else could this act serve to build an alliance?'

The greater calculus, he surmised, was part of the game between the dragon lineage and Mount Luoxia. By revealing all this so nakedly, Dingjiao was sending a clear message: Mount Luoxia harbored ill intentions.

'Dongfang Heyun even made a special appearance to tell me just how torturous the Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope is. If Mount Luoxia treats a former Wei-Li prince like this, what kindness could they possibly hold for my Li family, for me?'

'The dragon lineage was friendly with the Wei-Li generations ago, and now they invite me into the sea as soon as I reach Foundation Establishment. Their stance is clear... But the fox clan of Mount Dali... what is their role in all of this?'



# Chapter 673: The Deer's Transformation

'Bai Rong holds no ill will toward me,' Li Zhouwei mused. 'But this involves Mount Dali. The dragon and fox clans had a poor relationship before, and now I'm the one tasked with conveying messages... perhaps this is their attempt to change that.'

He carefully recalled Bai Rong’s words, and the situation gradually became clearer.

'The main reason the two clans can even consider reconciliation is the death of their common enemy, Dongfang You. But a strained relationship isn't mended simply because a rival is dead. The fox clan is being proactive, and the dragons are being remarkably gracious. It's likely they are being pressured by an external force…'

'If they share a common enemy, and this new attempt at an alliance pivots on observing Mount Luoxia's secrets... and if I, a Wei-Li descendant with a deep-seated hatred for Mount Luoxia, am meant to be the linchpin... then the answer seems obvious.'

Li Zhouwei maintained a pleasant smile, his golden eyes betraying no hint of his sharp thoughts, but his mind grew ever more lucid.

'It's Mount Luoxia forcing them to turn from enemies to friends. But why act only now? Is it because of something Mount Luoxia has done... or is about to do?'

The Azurewater Scaled-Beast glided smoothly through the water. Melodious music filled the hall, mingling with the sweet fragrance of spiritual fruits and fine wine. Yet Li Zhouwei felt as if he were in the eye of a hurricane. The political storm was gathering, a tempest of shimmering clouds and radiant light, involving Mount Luoxia, the dragons, the foxes, and countless other powers lurking in the shadows.

'Compared to even the weakest of them, the fox clan, my Li family is no larger than an ant.'

'Most importantly... does Mount Luoxia know? And what is *his* perspective on all this?'

Dingjiao had repeatedly assured him that the day's events would be hidden from any divination, but Li Zhouwei didn't take the words to heart. He treated them as mere pleasantries, and his worries were not the least bit assuaged.

'When I was first invited to the Flood Dragon Palace, how could the Purple Mansion cultivators of Jiangnan not know? My family has sought out the foxes several times—how could the nearby Purple Mansion cultivators not be aware? Even my departure from the lake and boarding the Azurewater Scaled-Beast in the Southern Sea happened in plain sight! None of it was a secret!'

'Why would anyone need divination for this? A simple deduction of the cause and effect would reveal seventy or eighty percent of the truth! What exactly is Dingjiao trying to keep secret? Is it only our entry into the abyss?'

Facing the Dragon Prince, whose smile was so warm and inviting, Li Zhouwei felt no sense of ease. His heart was as still as a tranquil lake.

'This prince's standing is higher than that of an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator. While he is certainly trying to befriend me... could he have other motives?'

The mists of uncertainty before him offered no real clues. The black-armored demon had already presented the stone box, setting it before him and lifting the lid. A soft light emerged, shimmering within.

Li Zhouwei remained composed as he glanced inside. The box contained a casket of transparent, crystal-clear spirit water. Its color was so faint it was nearly invisible, with only a bright yellow reflection floating on its surface and nothing else.

He swept his spiritual sense over it and felt an overwhelming spiritual energy from the water, but the reflection had no apparent source.

Dongfang Dingjiao chuckled and waved his hand, silencing the music and dancing in the hall. "Minghuang," he said softly, "this is called Concealed Plunder Gold. It is formed when the sun's essence falls into the deep sea. It cannot be seen with the eyes or detected by the senses. Even placed right before you, unless you have cultivated a divine ability, you wouldn't notice a thing."

"The casket holds Serpent Origin Spirit Water," he explained. "My dragon lineage uses it to wash the horns on our foreheads, while humans often use it to cultivate eye techniques. The Concealed Plunder Gold only casts a reflection in this type of spirit water. We use the water to locate it."

Li Zhouwei had heard of Serpent Origin Spirit Water before. A similar, precious substance called Clear Origin Spirit Water was used within the sea for eye-cultivation techniques. Yet here was an entire casket of it.

'And it's just being used to illuminate the Concealed Plunder Gold. A thin layer on the bottom would have sufficed, yet he used a whole casket. The wealth of the dragons is truly astonishing.'

Dingjiao added that the dragons used it simply to wash their horns, implying it was no rare treasure. He showed no regret in using it so lavishly, focusing instead on the invisible gold. "This is a Supreme Yang spiritual item with a unique property. It can be placed within the Shengyang, Juque, or Qihai acupoints to assist in cultivating one's dharma light. It is of great benefit to almost all forms of dharma light!"

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei silently circulated the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light within him. Though his spiritual sense couldn't perceive the object, he could feel his technique stirring with anticipation.

'This is indeed a fine treasure. It must be a rare and special Supreme Yang item, otherwise a man of Dingjiao's temperament would never have brought it out.'

This Dragon Prince had offered an ancient spiritual artifact at their first meeting—how could any ordinary item catch his eye? Even the Serpent Origin Spirit Water was just a tool to reveal this true treasure. With a serious expression, Li Zhouwei nodded.

"I have done little more than make a trip, exerting no real effort. I am unworthy of such a gift, but I will remember this kindness in my heart. Thank you, Your Highness!"

Seeing that he didn't refuse, the frown that had started to form on Dingjiao's brow relaxed. He smiled and nodded, then turned to Bai Rong.

"This Mysterious Jin Purple Fire," he said softly, "was obtained by a Luan-Phoenix senior by chance during her travels in the Western Sea many years ago. A Fire Luan who visited me some years back gifted it to me."

"But after much thought, my dragon lineage commands the races of the water. We have no use for this Mysterious Jin Purple Fire. It is far more valuable to your fox clan than it is to us."

"The elders of our two families have already discussed this, so I won't say more. Bai Rong, please accept it."

Bai Rong was visibly taken aback, as if the value of the Mysterious Jin Purple Fire exceeded his expectations. He accepted with clear delight. Dingjiao, greatly pleased, clapped his hands, and a troupe of women in purple robes hurried into the hall.

"Come."

Dongfang Dingjiao raised his cup. The purple-robed women began to dance, their robes revealing purplish-green shrimp tails that swished back and forth. They were clearly a troupe of shrimp demons, and their dance was quite distinctive.

'He is a dragon, after all,' Li Zhouwei thought. 'Not once on this entire journey has the banquet's entertainment been repeated. There have been shrimp, clams, crabs, and snakes... the dragons truly put effort into these matters.'

Li Zhouwei raised his cup, and the conversation continued amidst the music and dancing. Dingjiao was keen on building a friendship, and Bai Rong and Li Zhouwei were happy to reciprocate. The atmosphere was joyful and harmonious.

Outside the hall, the water rushed past, a blur of turquoise and red. The Azurewater Flood Dragon was speeding towards the Eastern Sea under a sky thick with dark clouds, where bolts of lightning slithered and surged.

***

Moongaze Lake.

The great hall on Pingya Island was quiet. A few cultivators hurried past as Li Jiangqian strode swiftly down the long flight of stairs. His features had matured in the past two years. Behind him, several figures stumbled to keep up.

"Your Highness!"

The two men were not young, their hair white with age. Judging by their robes, they were tutors. But Li Jiangqian was nimble. He slipped through a group of guards with a swish, leaving the two men far behind.

The tutors could only stop, sighing in exasperation.

Li Jiangqian was growing older and had lost his patience for elementary studies. Skipping lessons was a common occurrence. They knew which direction he was headed—he was surely going to find Li Que'wan. Since they were forbidden from entering her inner hall, they could only stop here.

"I used to marvel at His Highness's intelligence... why does he dislike his studies so much now? It is Que'wan who is the diligent one, with a benevolent heart..."

"Indeed..."

The two sighed and had no choice but to retreat.

Li Jiangqian, however, ran all the way to a different hall, pushing the heavy doors open with a creak.

Inside, the desk was neat and the books on the shelves were perfectly arranged. As he opened the door, a ray of golden light fell upon the girl before him.

"Que'wan!"

Li Shuwan had been formally accepted into the clan at the lake and her name changed to Li Que'wan. Her attire was brighter now, her complexion much healthier. Her eyes shone, and a small peach blossom was pinned in her hair. She covered her mouth and giggled.

"Brother Qian, skipping class again... You'll get an earful tomorrow!"

"What of it? They'll just nag a little. As long as they don't report me to the elders, they can't do anything to me."

Li Jiangqian took a bamboo box from his sleeve and placed it on the desk with a clatter. He opened it to reveal several snow-white pastries. Li Que'wan thanked him but then furrowed her little brow.

"Brother Qian, the tutors are teaching the great principles of human relations, the separation of immortal and mortal, the unity of the great families, and the governance of the clan branches. You are to be the head of the family one day. How can you not listen?"

Li Jiangqian chuckled, looking at her with a smile. He pulled out a few of his own cultivation manuals and shook his head. "That's just the talk of a lacquerer. Hearing it once is enough."

The *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun* and the *Golden Book of Houshu* were Purple Mansion cultivation arts and naturally couldn't be left lying around in the main hall. They had been stored away long ago, and both children had already memorized them. The books they could study here were merely secret manuals on cultivation techniques.

Hearing his words, Li Que'wan looked at him, puzzled. As he flipped through a book to a note he had made previously, Li Jiangqian added casually, "All immortal clans and sects are like palaces. What those people teach is just the golden lacquer on the palace walls, used for decoration. Every family has its own principles, so they use their own lacquer. Some are bright, some are dark, but it's all just lacquer."

He raised an eyebrow, looking at the girl opposite him. He hesitated for a moment, then amended his statement. "Perhaps it is important. I'm just tired of hearing it."

But Li Que'wan didn't let it go so easily. She thought for a moment and shook her head. "Brother Qian, you are very clever, but I don't think it is just lacquer... and those words aren't just for decoration. Since those words have been spoken, the people of our family have something to rely on."

"Perhaps for you, what color the lacquer is doesn't matter. But the common people can only look up and see the color of the lacquer. To them, it is very important."

Her words made Li Jiangqian pause. He looked at her seriously, his brow furrowed. "But public sentiment is something that can be easily manipulated. A single spell or a divine ability is all it takes. What they think isn't important. It has no meaning."

"Look at the Buddhist cultivators in the north. How bitter and difficult are the lives of their people? How lost are they from birth to death? The lives they lead would be considered the worst of the worst in Jiangnan. And yet, they think only of their next life and worship their masters with all their hearts. What bad reputation could there possibly be?"

Li Que'wan was silent for a moment, her eyes quietly glancing at him. "But how they live," she said softly, "is very important."

Li Jiangqian thought for a moment, then realized her point. "You are right... after all, this is the foundation of our family."

The girl pressed her lips together. She knew he was thinking about the Talisman Seeds. She wanted to say more but held her tongue, then smiled to herself.

'It doesn't seem to make a difference. One is judged by their actions, not their thoughts. Brother Qian is brilliant, far beyond me. As long as his heart is in the right place, no one will be able to bully him in the future!'

Li Que'wan giggled. The thought of working together with someone like Li Jiangqian made the road ahead seem much smoother. She went back to her reading. Li Jiangqian, however, secretly glanced at her.

'She is exceptionally talented. I must maintain a good relationship with her. No matter what happens, having a genius on my side is for the best!'

Though they had just debated, they seemed to hold each other in higher and warmer regard. Li Jiangqian mused, 'We are both smart and talented. It is difficult for two intelligent people whose interests are naturally aligned to have any real conflict.'

After they had been reading for a short while, someone entered the outer hall and announced, "The Fourth Lord is here."

This referred to Li Zhouluo, the son of Li Chenghuai, who was technically their fourth uncle. Li Jiangqian put his things away and quickly stood up to go out. As he stepped out of the inner hall, he saw Li Zhouluo pacing anxiously.

"Fourth Uncle!"

Li Jiangqian was much more outgoing. Li Que'wan, still a bit shy, followed quietly behind him.

Li Zhouluo returned the greeting politely, but his expression was troubled. He sighed softly and shook his head. "Something has happened at the lake. My father was busy all last night, and the elders have all gone to Qingdu for a meeting. He sent me here first thing this morning... I am to wait here. The other cousins will be coming. Elder White Ape is going to take us to Qingdu."

"Oh?" Although young, Li Jiangqian was thoughtful. He simply asked, "What happened?"

Having been by his father's side, Li Zhouluo was more familiar with the clan's affairs. "A mortal deer was found on the eastern shore," he sighed. "It cannot speak, but it acts like a human, dragging several people along, kowtowing and weeping all the way to the foot of the mountain. Its hooves were stained with ink, and it could even write."

Hearing this strange news, Li Que'wan's eyes widened.

Li Zhouluo continued in a low voice, "My father studied it all night. None of the Foundation Establishment cultivators in the family could communicate with animals. Fortunately, Elder White Ape is a demon and knew a few methods. After a night of questioning, he learned the truth."

"The deer was once a mortal man who lived on the eastern shore. His father, a gambler, had just passed away. The family was destitute, and his wife was bedridden. He went into the mountains, hoping to hunt a couple of deer to help them get by."

"The hunter went into the mountains and, by a stroke of luck, managed to hunt two deer. He was rushing back, eager to save his wife, when he ran into a monk on the path..."

A look of anger appeared on Li Zhouluo's face. "The monk was furious that he had taken lives. The hunter immediately begged for mercy, but the monk said that he had harmed two lives to save one. And with that, he cast a spell and turned the hunter into a deer, saying he should experience what it feels like to be hunted."

"That's..." Li Que'wan looked confused.

Li Jiangqian's expression, however, turned dark. "Where did this bald donkey come from?" he muttered. "He might as well turn all the killers in the world into beasts. Where is Master Kongheng? Is there any news?"

Li Zhouluo's face was etched with anxiety. "That's the problem," he said, shaking his head. "Master Kongheng has already examined the deer. He said the one who cast the spell is extremely powerful. There isn't a single trace of magical energy on the deer. His cultivation is far superior to Master Kongheng's."

Li Jiangqian frowned.

Li Que'wan waited until they had finished speaking before asking softly, "Since he was turned into a deer, what about his bedridden wife?"

"She..." Li Zhouluo shook his head. "She was already gravely ill and hadn't eaten for a long time. By the time she was found... she was already gone."



# Chapter 674: Fu Xia

In recent years, Qingdu Mountain had seen a flurry of new construction, with pavilions and towers now dotting its landscape. After the main branch of the Li family moved from the summit, the spiritual abodes within the Qingdu Cave Dwellings below were repurposed as a place for the lake's various cultivators to enter seclusion for their breakthroughs. The caverns were quiet, safe, and free from disturbance.

Li Xuanxuan emerged from the main hall on the summit, closely followed by Li Ximing’s grandson, Li Zhouming. The young man’s aptitude for cultivation was regrettably low; after all this time, he remained stalled at the second stage of Embyronic Breathing. With his grandfather, Li Ximing, in seclusion, the boy could only tag along behind Li Xuanxuan and offer a helping hand where he could.

As the old man reached the front of the hall, he saw a magnificent deer kneeling before it. Its coat was sleek and glossy, but it was prostrated as if frozen in place, tears streaming endlessly from its eyes.

The White Ape watched from the side, its gaze filled with a quiet sorrow. Nearby, the monk Kongheng stood with his palms pressed together, chanting sutras under his breath, his brow deeply furrowed in distress.

Li Xuanxuan had already been briefed on the situation. The old man rarely showed his anger, but now he could not hide his displeasure. "A Buddhist cultivator? If he has a grievance with my family, he should have come to me directly! What is the meaning of taking it out on a mortal!"

Li Chenghuai stood nearby, his voice soft and laced with helplessness. "The story has already spread like wildfire through the towns on the eastern shore. Everyone is terrified. No one dares to enter the mountains anymore. In fact, many have started building shrines, saying that if they believe in the Revered One, they'll be spared from such calamities."

"Preposterous!" Li Xuanxuan sighed.

The White Ape gently stroked the deer’s back. After a long silence, it finally spoke. "These zealots are the most stubborn of them all. They delight in toying with the lives of others, dealing out what they call retribution for their own amusement. They cannot comprehend the pain of others until it strikes them personally. Then, in a fit of rage, they forget all compassion, all forgiveness, and raise their blade in the name of defending the Dao."

It was rare for the old ape to speak at such length, and a hush fell over the hall. Kongheng listened, his expression pained. After a moment, he murmured, "Senior… they also teach people to do good, but their methods are too tyrannical… Not everyone of my path is like this…"

The old ape sighed but didn't argue. "The esteemed monk speaks the truth."

Li Xuanxuan’s gaze fell upon the prostrated deer. "Master Monk, since you cannot undo this, do you have any trace of the one who did it? Or can you at least identify his lineage? I fear that if we allow him to run rampant on our lake, he will only cause more harm."

Kongheng paused. "I follow an ancient path; I have no skill in divination. From the look of it, he is an old, experienced monk and left no traces… I'm afraid he will be difficult to find."

He seemed more certain about the next part.

"As for his lineage," he said softly, "judging by his actions, he likely belongs to one of the more archaic sects among the seven paths. He neither killed nor laid any curses, so his methods are, in a way, orthodox."

"Oh?" Li Xuanxuan felt a sliver of relief. If the intruder were like Murong Xia of the Yan Buddhists, who cultivated human heads in his stomach, he could have converted half a town with a single breath. The fact that he had only transformed a man into a deer was certainly not the Yan style. "And which paths are considered orthodox?"

Kongheng bowed his head. "To answer the venerable elder, the Path of Precepts and Austerity and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm are both quite righteous, with principles that resonate with my own path. There is one other… the Path of Wrathful World Purification… that is also considered orthodox…"

The words startled Li Xuanxuan. The old man frowned. "The Path of Wrathful World Purification is considered orthodox?"

"Indeed," Kongheng said quietly. "Setting aside the monks from wild, unvetted temples, the renowned monasteries of the Wrathful Path have always upheld extremely strict rules. Though they are dogmatic and unyielding, they are dedicated to vanquishing demons. In that, they are a righteous path…"

Li Xuanxuan was silent for a breath, then shook his head. "Then it must be the Wrathful Path. A grudge with them won't be settled in a hundred years, let alone a thousand!"

"The Wrathful Path…" Kongheng repeated the name, then chanted several lines of scripture, a troubled look on his face. "Venerable elder… the Wrathful Path is not to be trifled with. If it were some rogue monk from a mountain hovel, that would be one thing. But if he is truly of this lineage, then his actions suggest he comes from a major temple…"

His worry was palpable. "It is said that after the fall of the Warthful Subduer of the Four Demon Emperors… the Wrathful Path suffered a devastating blow. Their major temples have sealed their gates and no longer interact with the outside world. Nearly all their monks who were abroad have perished. Let us hope we are not dealing with a Merciful One…" He trailed off, then added, "Even with the Wrathful Subduer gone and the Merciful One’s power reduced to a fraction of its former glory, they are still far beyond what an ordinary monk can face."

Li Xuanxuan fell silent. After a quarter of an hour, Chen Yang strode into the hall, cupped his fist in a salute, and announced in a grave voice, "My lords, there is a monk waiting outside the formation!"

A jolt went through Li Xuanxuan. He turned quickly to Li Chenghuai. "Go to Mount Wu at once!" he ordered urgently. "See if Ximing is at a critical point in his seclusion! If not, tell him to come here immediately! I fear we have a serious problem on our hands!"

Li Chenghuai nodded and hurried away. Seeing the old man’s panic, Kongheng quickly tried to reassure him. "For this person to approach our gates and ask for entry suggests he may not be an enemy. Please, Senior, rest for a moment. Elder White Ape and I will go and handle this first…"

Li Xuanxuan had no other choice. With Li Ximing in seclusion, the only ones in the Foundation Establishment Realm in the family were the White Ape and Kongheng. The old ape's strength was not what it once was, leaving Kongheng as their only truly reliable power. He could only nod in agreement.

With Li Xuanxuan's consent, Kongheng walked briskly out of the hall, the White Ape following silently behind him.

"We don't know if this visitor is friend or foe, but he is at least a fellow Buddhist cultivator," Kongheng said softly. "I will go out first to gauge the situation. Senior, please wait within the protection of the array."

The White Ape gave a slight nod.

Once outside the grand formation, Kongheng rose into the air on a gust of wind. As expected, he saw an old monk standing upon the shimmering surface of the lake.

The monk’s face was a web of wrinkles, and he held a staff in his hand, his expression as placid as a still well. A deep yellow kasaya was draped over his body, leaving one muscular arm exposed. The arm was powerful and well-defined, gleaming faintly in the sunlight. Circular runes were faintly visible on the kasaya, shimmering like scales under the light. The long staff in his hand was the color of pure white jade.

He stood in silence, but a circle of cultivators had already gathered around him, all of them holding their breath, too afraid to make a sound.

When Kongheng descended onto the lake's surface, the surrounding cultivators let out a collective sigh of relief and scattered. Their leader, An Siwei, approached and said respectfully, "Master Monk… this man used a piece of driftwood from the shore as a boat and paddled all the way here."

Kongheng glanced down and saw that the man was indeed standing on a withered log to stay afloat on the water. His expression was utterly serious as he opened his eyes. His voice was deep and resonant.

"Master, are you of the Northern Revered One's lineage?"

Before Kongheng could even speak, the monk’s preemptive question caught him off guard, leaving him feeling slightly awkward. "I do not deserve the title of Master," he replied politely. "This humble monk is Kongheng, from Liaohe Temple."

"Liaohe Temple?" The old monk was clearly not a patient man. His eyes flew open, the scales on his kasaya glittering, and his tone became harsh and critical. "Your lineage is profound and orthodox, the envy of all. How could you forget the sin of extravagance? We cultivators are meant to measure the world with our own two feet. Why do you imitate other practitioners, flying about from high to high? Is that not indulging in the desire for pleasure?"

This man had turned someone into a deer for no reason, and before Kongheng could even ask why, he was being berated. He was taken aback for a moment, then frowned. "Luxury is a state of mind, not an action. Senior, you overstate things."

The old monk seemed to let the matter drop with a snort. "Fu Xia, of the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple."

'So he really is from the Wrathful Path…' Kongheng’s heart sank. This was bad. He could only force himself to bow in return. "May I ask why Senior has come here…?"

Fu Xia’s face was cold, as if he was trying to suppress a laugh at the question. "Master Kongheng… are you truly this ignorant, or are you just pretending? We are both followers of the Buddhist Dao; there is no place for such nonsense! Are you, or are you not, a cultivator of the Northern Revered One's path?"

The politeness he had shown earlier vanished, replaced by a cold suspicion of Kongheng's identity. Kongheng, in turn, dropped his own courteous tone. "Senior," he said grimly, "you transformed a man into a deer—a wicked art of animal transformation. Do you consider that a righteous act? I have heard that the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple vanquishes demons, not that it practices such vile arts!"

At this accusation, a bronze light flared in Fu Xia’s eyes, and his face took on the sheen of lacquered gold. His voice was low, seething with repressed fury as he ground out the words, "Wicked art of animal transformation? This is the Way of Karmic Retribution! A deer is a living creature of heaven and earth, neither noble nor base, equal to all others. For his own selfish desires, that man killed a deer—it is no different from killing a person! Turning him into a deer was a light punishment, granted only because he was uneducated in the Dao!"

The sleeves of Kongheng’s robe billowed without a wind, and a hazy golden light began to form behind him. His voice took on a powerful, resonant tone. "He killed the deer to save his wife! By turning him into a deer, you ensured the death of his wife, who was already impoverished and bedridden… He killed a deer, but you murdered a person!"

The moment Fu Xia heard him emphasize the person over the animal, he knew Kongheng did not respect the doctrine of the equality of all living beings. He erupted in fury. Not only did his face gleam like gold, but bright, intricate patterns now appeared on his skin. "Insolent fool!" he roared. "Let me ask you! He was destitute, and his wife was sick on her deathbed… whose fault was that? Who was to blame? How dare you stand there and spout such nonsense!"

His voice rolled like thunder, sending the nearby cultivators fleeing in terror. Those who were too slow clapped their hands to their ears as blood trickled out, staggering unsteadily. Seeing this, Kongheng formed a hand seal, and the golden light behind him surged.

*Clang!*

A six-armed Vajra Guardian emerged from the light behind him. Its massive, golden face glowed with red light, its eyes wide with fury. Its six arms held golden chains that spread across the sky like a spider's web, casting down a protective golden curtain over the retreating cultivators.

Kongheng gritted his teeth. "Whose fault could it be! He was poor because his father gambled away the family fortune! His wife was sick because of ill fortune and a cruel fate! How can you blame anyone for that!"

Fu Xia stared as if he had heard the most hilarious joke in the world. A wild laugh burst from the depths of his throat, and his staff began to glow with a dazzling light. "A fine 'ill fortune,' a wonderful 'cruel fate,'" he sneered. "Allow me to enlighten you!"

His staff shot toward the heavens like a white rainbow, striking the net of golden chains with a deafening, metallic crash.

"He lived on the land of your Li family," Fu Xia bellowed, "yet he was forced to live in abject poverty! That is the Li family’s crime! All his tragedy was caused by your Li family! And you dare try to shift the blame to me!"

"His wife was killed by your Li family, and so he, in turn, harmed another living creature! I took pity on him, for he too was a victim, and merely transformed him into a deer… I have yet to settle the score with your Li family!"

The accusation stunned Kongheng. For a moment, even the golden chains in the sky seemed to falter. The blazing white light from the staff pressed down, and he let out a muffled grunt, feeling as if Mount Tai itself was crushing him, making it impossible to breathe.

His spiritual energy roiled within him. "Heretical nonsense!" he forced out.

But the monk before him was no longer focused on their battle. His eyes burned with a righteous fire. He pinned Kongheng with the staff in one hand and continued his cold tirade.

"You don't build temples, you don't establish temple-managed fields, you don't teach the Dharma, and you don't guide the people. Instead, you divide the land household by household… letting each person drift according to their individual fate… This guarantees tragedy… You watch impassively as people rise and fall in the mortal world, and you say it is not your sin?"

"If you had followed the Dharma's guidance, brought all land under temple control, and made all people tenants of the temple, their only concerns would be tilling the land and cultivating their spirit! With paradise in their hearts, the greater their suffering, the closer they would feel to the Revered One! How could there be poverty then? How could there be any need to hunt? With monks to watch over them, how could his wife have ever fallen ill?"

The fury in Fu Xia’s eyes was almost tangible, erupting from his gaze. With just one hand on his staff, he held Kongheng completely suppressed. Suddenly, he raised his other hand, summoning a blinding golden light.

"My Dharma Idol was crippled by these villains of the Immortal Path, my cultivation nearly destroyed! My strength is a fraction of what it once was, and I have no way to borrow divine power… but to deal with the likes of you… it is more than enough!"

The golden light in his hand shot forward like a venomous snake, boring toward Kongheng. A dire warning flared in Kongheng’s mind. His eyes instantly turned a solid gold, unleashing a rain of rainbow-colored light that drifted down upon the lake.

The light was wondrous. Wherever it touched the water, lotuses bloomed, and the sound of sutras filled the air. A five-colored radiance erupted from the lake like a fountain. The light of Fu Xia's white staff dimmed for an instant, and the golden chains seized the opportunity to retract, shielding Kongheng.

"**[The Great Art of Resplendent Light]**…"

As the rainbow light rained down upon him, Fu Xia’s expression twisted in fury. "To possess such a profound art," he hissed, "yet you grovel at the feet of followers of the Immortal Path!"

His words echoed across the lake. Kongheng felt a flush of heat in his chest. He gritted his teeth and formed another seal, thickening the golden chains around him, but he didn't dare make a move, fearing the oppressive white light of the staff.

Seeing no reaction, Fu Xia paused. "Those who seek immortality care only for themselves," he said grimly. "How could they ever care for the common people? Wherever cultivators meddle in the mortal world, they build their towering peaks, and schemes and treachery flourish! The common folk become entangled in conflicts of interest, their hearts clouded by dust. It is impossible to find a truly good person among them…"

"Only my Buddhist Dharma teaches that all beings are equal! If all were tenants of the temple, all hearts would be united. They would find joy even in suffering, thinking only of truth, goodness, and beauty. With no officials and no masters, they would be free from the torment of worldly fate!"

"And yet you serve as a guest elder for a family of cultivators, watching all this happen with indifference! Kongheng! You have betrayed the Path of the Northern Revered One…"

Before he could finish, a clap of thunder echoed from above. An intense light gathered in the sky, forming the image of a vast and ancient city wall, forged from celestial light. It descended like a mountain, casting a huge golden reflection on the lake below.

Fu Xia’s anger flared anew. His eyes glowed like bronze, and the overwhelming radiance bathed him, turning him into a golden statue. "I am debating the Dao with a peer!" he bellowed. "Who are you to interfere!"

The celestial light filled his vision, growing ever larger. And then a cold voice, sharp as thunder, ripped through the air:

"To hell with you, you bald donkey! Go preach your godsdamned dog of a Dao!"



# Chapter 675: The Demon-Subduing Plot

Of all the world’s orthodoxies, Li Ximing despised the Northern Buddhists the most.

The stories of his ancestors, Li Xuanling and Li Tongya, had been repeated by his grandfather Li Xuanxuan hundreds of times, and the resentment still festered. Li Xuanfeng had also died besieged by monks, and even Li Xijun had nearly lost his life at their hands.

It had been the same during the northern and southern conflicts. He had only been cultivating for a short time when some Buddhist cultivator would show up at his door, screaming:

"Your family nearly killed mine back then! What now?"

And now, seeing Kongheng immobilized by this old monk's white light, the scene felt hauntingly familiar.

‘The Li clan of Wei brought about a golden age for the Bright Yang, only for it to be overthrown by the barbarians of the Northern Path,’ Li Ximing recalled. ‘It involved Golden Cores and Revered Ones. From that moment on, our fates became intertwined, a law of nature. Wherever the Bright Yang flourishes, a Buddhist master is sure to follow…’

Though he understood the reason for it all, he couldn't suppress the fury welling inside him. He had heard the monk’s overbearing words from a distance and knew better than to engage with their bewitching rhetoric. Letting the words go in one ear and out the other, he simply raised his Radiant Origin Pass and smashed it down.

Caught off guard, Fu Xia took the full brunt of the brilliant light. His face darkened for a moment before he raised a single hand to block the massive gate. The searing white bricks turned his copper-toned hand glowing red. The old monk’s eyes narrowed, and he spat, "Just as I thought! The Bright Yang path of rigid hierarchies and social order!"

The instant he spoke, Kongheng was freed. The Six-armed Vajra Guardian behind him opened its wrathful eyes, and a multitude of shimmering golden chains shot out to bind Fu Xia. Only then did Kongheng have a moment to catch his breath.

But as he recovered, Li Ximing’s attack slammed into its target. It felt like hitting a cold, unyielding stone. A wave of nausea washed over him, and he almost coughed up blood.

‘Tough old monk!’

Fu Xia, despite his casual appearance, had braced himself. A single punch from him sent a tremor through the immortal foundation of Li Ximing's technique. He squinted, studying his attacker for a moment before realizing.

'This is Li Ximing!'

Finally able to speak, Kongheng used his spiritual qi to re-form the scattered chains. The blast of white light had left his voice slightly hoarse, but he maintained his calm composure. "Venerable senior," he began softly, "you say that suffering creates a Revered One. Do the temple serfs, who toil their entire lives, truly become Revered Ones? And which Revered One do they become? They have no affinity for cultivation, no karmic wisdom from past lives. They rely solely on hardship and chanting a name to achieve the Dao, yet tens of thousands perish from hunger and exhaustion. I have never seen the scriptures mention a new Revered One of hardship and mercy, or a new Maha of chanted names!"

His voice, though quiet, carried the deafening force of spiritual law. "This Buddhist paradise you've built in the lands of Yan and Zhao—is it all just a colossal lie?"

An expression of utter disbelief spread across Fu Xia’s face. Kongheng’s words seemed to root him to the spot, stunning him into immobility.

Seizing the opportunity, Li Ximing’s eyes blazed with celestial light. The Radiant Origin Pass materialized in full, its white bricks perfectly laid, its crenellations exquisitely carved. The seventy-two ridges on its corner towers shone like the gates of heaven itself, and the base of the gate was covered in intricate, dazzling patterns.

Fu Xia had been arrogant, using only one hand to block the gate. But the Radiant Origin Pass was renowned for its power to grind down and suppress its targets. Li Ximing’s own cultivation was profound, and he had even mastered two secret arts to augment it. Now, pouring every last ounce of his strength into the attack, it was as if a sun had risen over Moongaze Lake.

*BOOM!*

With a deafening roar, Fu Xia was forced to use both hands to hold back the Pass, and he was completely engulfed in the overwhelming celestial light. The brilliance reflecting off his body pierced the lake below, vaporizing the water into clouds of white steam.

*Clang… clang…*

The golden chains from Kongheng’s technique flew out, wrapping around the monk in dense layers. The Six-armed Vajra Guardian pulled the chains taut, and a shower of sparks erupted from the sphere of white light. Cultivators hovering over the lake dove for cover, frantically searching for protective formations.

The old monk’s voice, a furious, thunderous roar, boomed from beneath the gate. "You… You dare to question the fundamental law of my righteous path?! You dare to question our fundamental law!"

Beneath the pass, the monk had transformed into a shining golden statue. His eyes were unnaturally large, the whites like jade and the pupils like copper, striking terror into anyone who met his gaze. His body began to swell, growing larger and larger as he gritted his teeth and pushed back with both arms.

*CRACK!*

Li Ximing felt his spiritual qi draining away as if being devoured by a whale. The Radiant Origin Pass began to wobble. In all his years of cultivation, he had rarely worried about exhausting his power; his recovery had always outpaced his expenditure. Gritting his teeth, he swallowed two pills and muttered, "Bring it on!"

Kongheng, though engaged in a debate of doctrine, was relentless with his techniques. While Fu Xia was pinned by the gate, he layered chain after golden chain onto the monk, even conjuring more out of thin air to bind him.

But Fu Xia paid the chains no mind. He stared blankly at Kongheng and snarled, "What did your master teach you?! Those people cannot cultivate. They endure a lifetime of hardship so they may go to Maha’s Pure Land… where they can enjoy eternal bliss!"

An incredibly complex expression crossed Kongheng's face, and for a moment, he was at a loss for words. Li Ximing watched, frustrated, and yelled, "If this bliss is so wonderful, why aren't you there enjoying it? Why do you linger in the mortal world? If being a temple serf is such a good thing, why did you start cultivating?"

Fu Xia let out a cold laugh. The celestial light was so bright his face was no longer visible, but his voice boomed, "Did you know that I was a temple serf in my youth?! My ancestors were serfs for generations, and they entered the Pure Land long ago. Back before the domain of the Warthful Subduer of the Four Demon Emperors was shattered… I even went to see them… and now you devils have killed them all!"

He continued, his voice ringing with conviction, "As for why I don't go to that paradise… what would a heretic devil like you know of our aspirations? When a cultivator like me is found to have a spiritual root, it is a calling from the Revered One himself! We cannot go to the Pure Land like common mortals. We are condemned to remain in this world and suffer, precisely to prevent devils and heretics like you from defiling our sacred lands!"

Li Ximing was stunned, unable to tell if the monk was lying or truly believed his own words. He glanced at Kongheng, only to find the young monk with his eyes shut tight, muttering sutras and focusing solely on his technique. He had stopped responding entirely.

'What is this… A renowned practitioner of the ancient Buddhist path can’t win a debate against him? Kongheng always tries to see the good in others; he’s far too honest…'

Li Ximing didn’t know that while Kongheng appeared calm, his mind was in turmoil. If they weren’t in the middle of a battle, he would have been drenched in a cold sweat.

Kongheng’s lineage was anything but ordinary. Though Liaohe Temple had fallen into decline, it was a place where a Revered One had once cultivated, and its status in the great desert was not low. When his master was still alive, he had dealings not just with the Merciful Ones, but with Mahas themselves.

Kongheng had been to the Pure Land. He had seen its jeweled pools, its lapis lazuli stairs, its lotus canopies, its thousands of birds and beasts, and its tens of thousands of souls living in contentment, able to travel outside when summoned. The experience, in his youth, had shaken him to his core, making him secretly question his own path.

'I’ve been able to read the hearts of others since I was a child. Those people were all filled with genuine joy… and Fu Xia is utterly devout… This…'

After Liaohe Temple fell, Kongheng traveled south and witnessed a thousand different tragedies across the lands of Yan and Zhao. Only then did he begin to grasp his master’s teachings. But Fu Xia’s words had stirred up all his old anxieties, leaving a knot of unspeakable conflict in his chest.

'Their methods are just too extreme, too tyrannical… Of the seven paths, if only they all had the same restraints as the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the Path of Precepts and Austerity…'

The Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the Path of Precepts did not internalize paradise but used a method of conversion through holy light. They would chant sutras and preach, waiting until the common folk had accrued sufficient merit and were filled with yearning before accepting them. For this, they were known as a righteous path.

The other five paths, however, often didn't bother asking. They simply devoured the populace whole, a method that seemed horrifically cruel. It was this that gave Kongheng pause. If not for that, his faith might have already been shaken.

"Kongheng!" Li Ximing’s shout snapped the slender-eyed monk back to reality. The golden chains binding Fu Xia were stretched taut, and the Radiant Origin Pass was shaking violently.

While Kongheng was faltering, Li Ximing’s mind was racing.

He knew his own strength perfectly well. His prowess in a direct fight was one thing, but the grinding, suppressive power of his Radiant Origin Pass was another. At full power, even a direct disciple of the Three Sects would be in for a world of hurt.

Even if he were fighting Li Qinghong, her best strategy would be to avoid getting trapped beneath the gate in the first place. And here he was, with Kongheng at his side. The young monk’s Buddhist arts were anything but simple.

'The two of us, working together, have him pinned down and bound by countless chains. What Foundation Establishment cultivator could possibly withstand this?'

The pass was already pushed to its limit, yet the old monk hadn't budged. Though the celestial light burned his skin red, he endured it, seemingly using the pain as a form of ascetic practice.

Li Ximing’s spiritual qi surged as he sent a message to Kongheng's ear, "Master… this monk is incredibly powerful… Can you tell what’s going on?"

Kongheng murmured, replying with a secret transmission, "I fear it is what remains of the Merciful One. When the Wrathful Maha fell, this thing lost all its divine abilities, leaving only this Merciful One's Dharma Body…"

"A Merciful One's Dharma Body!"

Li Ximing had considered the possibility, but hearing it confirmed still sent a jolt of shock through him.

No matter how weakened, a Dharma Body was not something a Foundation Establishment cultivator should be able to face. Though its powers were gone, how could it be suppressed by ordinary means? The only reason they hadn't been crushed already was that the monk was likely focused on his own ascetic training; otherwise, he would have thrown off the gate and come at them with his staff long ago.

As they hesitated, Fu Xia exhaled a torrent of golden light. "Kongheng!" his voice boomed. "Wake up! Your spiritual root is unparalleled. Why lead yourself astray? I have allowed you to suppress me without resisting because I wanted more time to persuade you!"

A pillar of golden light shot from his body into the sky. The chains now encased him in a solid golden sphere, but the old monk was unafraid. He formed a lotus seal with his fingers, spat out a cloud of pink mist, and yelled, "Go!"

His deep yellow kasaya suddenly came to life. It fluttered like a scroll caught in a gale, and with two quick turns, the monk vanished from beneath the pass. A violent explosion of golden light bleached all color from their vision.

'It’s over!'

Being a Buddhist cultivator himself, Kongheng recovered from the flash far more quickly. His eyes cleared, and the Six-armed Vajra Guardian behind him surged forward, just in time to block a long staff that was sweeping down from mid-air. The collision created a brilliant flash of light and forced a trickle of blood from Kongheng’s lips.

As his vision cleared, he saw a dark-striped tiger pinned beneath the bright, patterned gate.

The tiger was magnificent, with a deep yellow coat and stripes as black as ink. It had white eyebrows and the same copper-colored pupils as Fu Xia. A short, black horn grew from between its brows, pulsing with a mysterious light.

"A horned tiger…" Kongheng’s face went pale, his voice laced with a bitter resignation. "Senior, you are a Dharma Protector at the Demon-Subduing Temple in the north. With your orthodoxy in peril, you should be guarding the mountain and teaching the people. Why travel thousands of miles to come here? If something were to happen to you, what would Abbot Fuyan do?"

The blow had temporarily robbed them of their sight and spiritual sense. Fu Xia’s staff was already in mid-swing, a strike that would have crippled or killed them. But Kongheng's words stopped him.

"You are indeed deeply connected to my northern Demon-Subduing Temple…" he said, his voice heavy.

Li Ximing’s vision finally returned. Fu Xia stood nearby, bare-chested. Though the tiger under the gate wasn’t struggling, the arcane light from its horn made Li Ximing's mouth taste like bitter herbs.

'Damn it…'

Fu Xia alone had been difficult enough. Now that he was free and standing nearby with his staff, how could they possibly keep the tiger pinned? The brilliant gate flew up and returned to Li Ximing’s hand.

The moment it was released, the horned tiger sprang up and landed at Fu Xia's side. The old monk mounted the beast, his skin coated in a golden sheen, his copper eyes fixed on Kongheng as he held his staff in silence.

The entire lake fell quiet, the air thick with tension. Li Ximing squinted at Fu Xia, a strange feeling rising within him.

Kongheng was an honest monk. He was young and bound by too many precepts to engage in schemes. But Li Ximing had seen his share of conspiracies and had been taught from a young age to be wary. Suspicion began to dawn.

'He's preying on Kongheng's honesty, constantly trying to sway him with words… He must be after something.'

'According to Kongheng, the northern Demon-Subduing Temple is in dire straits. Why would he come all this way? I don't believe for a second that he's just out for a stroll after the Wrathful Maha’s death… He has a reason for being here.'

The young man watched Fu Xia warily. The old monk ignored him, his gaze locked on Kongheng. "Kongheng," he said calmly, "since you know our temple’s abbot, you must also know that our path is a righteous one. This old monk does not wish to kill, which is why I allowed you to make your moves."

Kongheng finally opened his eyes. "I am aware of the senior’s great virtue…"

Fu Xia nodded. "Leave this place," he commanded from atop the tiger. "Join my order and return with me to the temple."

'So that's what this is about?'

Li Ximing lowered his gaze, carefully studying the monk's expression and replaying the events in his mind. Something wasn't right. Kongheng was already showing signs of hesitation, but Li Ximing sent a spiritual transmission.

"Kongheng, this monk talks too much. I suspect there’s something wrong with him."

Kongheng didn't see it. As he silently considered how to placate the older monk, he replied, "He wants to convert me to his path. Of course he needs to use many words to persuade me… If I refuse, I fear people will be harmed…"

'No… the Path of Wrath is reviled right now, like rats in the street… Why would he be so arrogant? His actions have been highly suspicious. Did he really just endure the full force of our attacks purely for the sake of ascetic practice?'

Li Ximing felt that Fu Xia was deeply suspicious, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it, his thoughts a frustrating haze.

'If only Xijun were here!' he thought with a pang of resentment. 'This old fox wouldn't stand a chance! He'd see through him in an instant!'

But Li Xijun was gone, and Li Ximing had no one to fall back on. He stared coldly at the monk, his spiritual qi flowing as he sent another secret message.

"Since he's made his intentions clear, he’s here for you. He certainly won’t harm you. We've only exchanged a few moves with him. Why should we surrender so easily? Let's test him again! It’s not too late!"



# Chapter 676: Kongheng's Story

Li Ximing's suspicion wasn't just a baseless hunch. At first, not knowing Fu Xia’s true power, he had managed to suppress the monk with the Radiant Origin Pass. But now that Fu Xia had escaped and revealed himself to possess the Dharma Body of a Merciful One, the doubts only grew stronger.

'My Radiant Origin Pass is a powerful suppression technique, but every strength has a weakness,' Li Ximing reasoned. 'Since he has the body of a Merciful One, wouldn't it be far simpler for him to just smash my radiant pass with a single punch?'

A blow from a Merciful One was nothing a Foundation Establishment cultivator could withstand. A direct hit on the core of his immortal foundation would, at best, leave him vomiting blood with seventy percent of his strength gone, utterly incapable of fighting. At worst, it would mean instant death.

'He spits venom at me with every word, and my ancestor killed the Four Wrathful Demon Emperor he reveres. How could he possibly harbor any goodwill? His path is one of demon-subduing ferocity.'

'Even if he wouldn't kill me, intimidated by the Purple Mansion cultivators of Jiangnan, he could have just knocked me aside with one punch. That would give him the upper hand in every way. This constant running and evasion… it's not the way of a Merciful One!'

The battle had unfolded in a blur, and few possessed Li Xijun’s sharp tactical mind. But with a moment to breathe and think things through, Li Ximing’s suspicion hardened into certainty.

When he voiced his thoughts, Kongheng nodded in agreement.

“Very well. I will test him again.”

Kongheng pressed his palms together before his chest, chanting an endless stream of incantations. A five-colored brilliance bloomed from his hands as a vibrant, rainbow-hued rain began to fall from the sky once more. Lotuses blossomed across the lake's surface, filling the air with a rich fragrance.

"Still struggling futilely!" Fu Xia scoffed at the sight, though a flicker of delight shone in his eyes. He allowed the tiger-pelt robe to drape back over his shoulders, letting the colorful rain cascade over him. It shimmered across his gilded skin, creating ripples of multi-hued light.

'Another orthodox restraining technique,' Fu Xia thought. 'His background is truly extraordinary!'

The binding force was immense, but Fu Xia neither dodged nor resisted. He hailed from a great and renowned sect himself; just as his own incantations had little effect on Kongheng, Kongheng's arts were equally limited against him.

Besides, he possessed the Dharma Body of a Merciful One.

Seeing Fu Xia stand firm under the shimmering rain, Kongheng’s expression remained solemn and dignified. Golden chains swirled around him as the Six-Armed Vajra Guardian behind him released its grip, bringing all six arms together before its chest to cradle him. The five-colored light in his hands never dimmed.

A resplendent glow covered the lake, but Li Ximing ignored Kongheng, his gaze locked on Fu Xia. The old monk stood unshaken amidst the downpour. Concentrating the radiant light in his hands, Li Ximing’s mind raced.

'The old monk has barely used any techniques! He's just relying on this Dharma Body.'

Seeing Fu Xia remain motionless, he formed a hand seal and shouted, "Five Waters Imperial Heaven!"

At his command, the great formation of Mount Qingdu roared to life. A dense gray fog surged across the water's surface, obscuring the sky. From within, countless water serpents leaped forth—nimble, cunning creatures wielding weapons condensed from lake water. They charged the monk with reckless abandon.

This was the Five Waters Imperial Heaven Formation of Mount Qingdu.

The activation of the Foundation Establishment-level formation was an impressive sight, but Fu Xia didn't grant it so much as a second glance. "The tricks of an insect," he sneered.

And so it was. The roiling gray mist had no effect, and the water serpents within were exposed by the radiant light of his body. Before they could even get close, they were blown into clouds of white steam by the shimmering phantoms emanating from his gilded skin.

The formation was Liu Changdie's masterpiece, but its core aspects, 'Morning Mist' and 'Serpent Flow,' were designed to handle Qi Refinement cultivators. Against the Dharma Body of a Merciful One, they were utterly useless. Undeterred, Li Ximing watched with a cold expression, his hand seal abruptly changing.

“Non-Buoyancy!”

He touched two fingers together. As the seal formed, a white radiance spread out from beneath his feet. Kongheng and Li Ximing were unaffected, but Fu Xia paused for a fraction of a second, his eyes narrowing.

“Now!”

In that same instant, the radiant pass materialized once more—white bricks stacked high, bright corner towers, and a celestial gate that blazed with blinding light. It slammed down from the sky with a deafening crash, its brilliance forcing the surrounding cultivators to shield their faces with their sleeves.

"Master Kongheng!"

Li Ximing hadn't missed Fu Xia's momentary hesitation. He pushed the Radiant Origin Pass to its absolute limit, radiant light flaring in his eyes as he shook a small flag from his sleeve.

The flag was no bigger than his palm, a fiery crimson-yellow cloth embroidered with shimmering gold thread. It depicted a lifelike crimson sparrow, wreathed in five overlapping rings of red light, its beak open as if breathing fire.

It was a Dongli Sect artifact—the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner!

Unleashed for the first time, five palm-sized rings of red light shot from the banner. They surrounded the ornate base of the Radiant Origin Pass and pulsed in unison, spewing five different kinds of flames.

"By the heavenly pattern, let the Yang-Li execution flames descend!"

The five flames—brown-yellow, pale-yellow, goose-yellow, bright red, and vermillion—pressed down with overwhelming force. A pillar of fire shot into the sky, instantly forming clouds of red and yellow above the lake.

The clouds blazed with crimson light, drawing in the surrounding spiritual energy. Kongheng, still maintaining his restraining spell, had the Six-Armed Vajra Guardian behind him reach out. This time, however, it did not release its golden chains.

'That is a Dongli Sect artifact, and those are Li Fire flames. If my chains enter that inferno, they will eventually be melted down!'

His mind worked quickly. All six of the guardian's arms descended at once, pressing down on the radiant gate.

*BOOM!*

The flames raged. Through them, Li Ximing could see the color draining from Fu Xia’s face. A cold sneer touched the young man's lips. "Just as I thought!" he bit out. "I knew something was wrong with you!"

From the moment Fu Xia had appeared before Mount Qingdu, he hadn't used a single spell. Even his escape with the Horned Tiger had relied on an artifact. He clearly possessed the strength to defeat them both with two punches, yet he dragged out the fight, avoiding any real action.

Though Li Ximing was no expert in Buddhist techniques, he had pursued the Dao of the Purple Mansion for years and was well-versed in the theory of spells and cultivation arts. His suspicions had been raised early on.

The most precious and unique aspect of his Five Waters Imperial Heaven Formation was the ‘Non-Buoyancy’ technique. It was crafted from a rareWater Mansion material obtained by Yang Xiao'er and was incredibly valuable.

"And its value lies precisely in this," Li Ximing realized. "It excels at draining an opponent's dharma power and disrupting their flight!"

'The problem is his dharma power!'

Connecting this with Fu Xia’s previous actions, the answer struck him in a flash.

"His cultivation has fallen back to the level of a Master Monk! Though he possesses the empty shell of a Merciful One's body, its divine power is lost! This kind of collective Buddhist cultivation, without any personal foundation—it must have severely impacted his own dharma power. With no divine abilities and a body that's incredibly difficult to command, he's just a paper tiger!"

Such beings were not unheard of. He recalled how Li Xuanfeng, in order to channel the power of Geng Metal, had been forced to burn both of his immortal foundations as fuel. How could Fu Xia be any better off?

As Li Ximing explained, Kongheng immediately understood.

"I underestimated the impact of the Four Wrathful Demon Emperor's fall!"

"And this is a Dharma Body that Fu Xia cultivated himself! Having fallen from the rank of a Merciful One, he has the experience and a deep understanding of the Dao. If not for that, he would probably be completely immobile!"

Kongheng was not foolish, merely bound by precepts that forbade him from judging others with a suspicious heart. But with the truth laid bare, it was like a sudden awakening.

"When he arrived on that piece of driftwood, was it purely an act of asceticism? I think not! The body of a Merciful One is immensely heavy. He was afraid his dharma power was insufficient to sustain flight. By riding the wood, he had a physical anchor, allowing him to conserve what little power he had!"

Yet even now, with his pure heart, Kongheng was unwilling to believe Fu Xia had been deceiving him from the start, chalking it up to his journey being "not solely for asceticism."

With this new understanding, they both realized Fu Xia's evasions and his robe-turned-tiger were largely bluffs. A wave of relief washed over them.

*BOOM!*

Fu Xia strained with all his might, struggling to rise. A violent tremor shook the radiant pass, making it sway precariously. Li Ximing showed no mercy. Now that he had his opponent's weakness in hand, he pushed one part of the Five Waters Imperial Heaven Formation to its limit while pulling a small vial from his robes.

"Profound Pattern Vial!"

A torrent of radiant light erupted from the vial, layering itself over the Radiant Origin Pass. If the 'Sun Return' disc wasn't a defensive artifact, Li Ximing would have thrown that on top as well.

'A pity the Chongming Profound Insight Screen is with Zhouwei, or I'd be even more certain of victory.'

Now pressed down as if by a mountain, the Radiant Origin Pass began to stabilize. The five Li Fire flames burned fiercely. As Li Ximing's own dharma power plummeted, Fu Xia's struggles grew weaker. He knew his secret—the lack of power to command his Dharma Body—was out.

The old monk sighed and shook his head.

"When it comes to schemes, this old monk is no match for you followers of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao. I had hoped to keep it hidden, but I am not accustomed to deception. You saw right through me."

Li Ximing paid the old monk no mind. He swallowed a pill and focused his entire being, converting all his dharma power into radiant light and pouring it into the radiant gate.

Fu Xia, enduring the raging Li Fire, tried his old trick again. He formed a lotus mudra with his fingers, puffed out his cheeks, and spat a mouthful of pink mist.

But Kongheng had been watching him. He would not let him escape again. With a sharp cry, he exhaled several rays of golden light that shot like comets toward the base of the gate. His hands tightened, and the five-colored light in the sky vanished as he made a grasping motion.

With two sharp *clinks*, a pair of golden rays met the pink mist before it could spread. Like a gale scattering clouds, they completely neutralized it.

Fu Xia’s hands were still in a seal, his expression unchanged, but he stopped chanting.

If the Four Wrathful Demon Emperor had not fallen, he wouldn't even need his divine abilities. In terms of spellcasting alone, a hundred Konghengs would be no match for a single of his incantations. But now, Fu Xia had to admit he was powerless.

With the death of the Four Wrathful Demon Emperor, the Wrathful Path had suffered a devastating blow. While smaller, less orthodox temples still had their own independent techniques, a major temple like his, whose most powerful arts were all connected to the Maha, found their wellspring had run dry.

It wasn't that Fu Xia couldn't cast a single spell, or that he couldn't smash the radiant pass with one punch. But his dharma power was already strained. If he used it so recklessly, he might not have enough left to return to the north with Kongheng...

'Besides, the Abbot predicted that I cannot kill this Li Ximing... it would be best not to even injure him!'

The situation seemed dire, but the old monk was unconcerned. He simply sat down cross-legged in the middle of the raging Li Fire, formed a seal over his dantian, and said nothing more.

'Why should I even try to cast a spell to get out?'

He sat quietly within the radiant pass, allowing the five-colored Li Fire to scorch him and the radiant light to refine him. He withdrew all his magical radiance, becoming like a golden statue sitting motionless in the fire.

Seeing this, Li Ximing paused, instantly understanding.

'You cunning old monk!'

They had seen through Fu Xia's bluff, knowing he lacked the dharma power to break the gate. They had confidently suppressed him.

But Fu Xia had turned their plan against them, calmly taking a seat.

The reason was simple. He had the body of a Merciful One. The Li Fire and the radiant light, no matter how powerful or divine, were less than a nuisance to his true form. He didn't need to break the suppression; he only needed to endure it.

Li Ximing's dharma power, however, was not infinite. The longer this went on, the more of his energy would be wasted, and eventually, he would be exhausted.

Silence fell over the lake. Li Ximing's brow furrowed. He gradually reduced the power of the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner, stopping only when the radiant pass began to tremble slightly, maintaining a minimal level of suppression.

"Master," Li Ximing said in a low voice, "is there a solution?"

Kongheng saw the stalemate clearly. He sighed softly. "At least now I can speak with him as an equal. Allow me to try and persuade him."

He walked across the lake's surface, passing through the billowing steam and the intense glare of Li Fire and radiant light, until he stood before the Radiant Origin Pass.

Li Ximing was horrified. "Master, be careful!" he called out urgently. "The Li Fire and the radiant light have no eyes! Your body is precious; you cannot be in the same place as that man!"

The space beneath the Radiant Origin Pass was terrifyingly dangerous. Fu Xia was not afraid because of his Dharma Body, but an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator wouldn't last three seconds in there.

Kongheng looked back at him from a distance and smiled gently. "Do not worry, Ximing," he replied with a bow. "This is my tribulation. I have traveled thousands of miles south precisely to face it."

Li Ximing stared, dumbfounded, as Kongheng stepped into the flames. Enduring the scorching heat of the Li Fire and the dazzling radiant light, he made his way under the Radiant Origin Pass.

Fu Xia sat with his eyes closed, deep in meditation, not saying a word.

"Venerable senior," Kongheng said softly, "you did not tell the whole truth earlier."

Fu Xia knew he was referring to the driftwood. Sensing the hint of accusation, he answered gruffly, "I am a Dharma Protector, not a fool. Why would I tell you everything?"

"I understand." Kongheng sat down cross-legged before him, his voice gentle. "All seven paths have their selfish desires. In this age, one cannot survive without them. Kongheng has long known this. Even when the Mahas met with my master, they too had their own motives."

This statement, bordering on slander against the Mahas, made Fu Xia’s eyes fly open in anger.

A faint smile touched Kongheng’s face.

"When the Mahas visited my master back then, the sky over the Liaohe River was filled with five-colored light that night. I stood behind my master as the Mahas tried to entice me with celestial flowers falling like rain, with wondrous words and profound teachings of the golden lotus. They spoke of primeval chaos until the unfeeling stones shed tears, of delving into boundless heavenly realms to behold the ultimate essence of all things. But they did not succeed with me."

"But my five senior brothers, who came before me, were all lured away."

Kongheng's words touched upon hidden matters and mentioned the Mahas, causing the colorful clouds in the sky to churn and the golden lotuses on the lake to bloom in profusion. This finally made Fu Xia treat him with solemnity. "So what?" he asked in a low voice.

"Abbot Fuyan," Kongheng said calmly, a smile still on his face, "is my third senior brother, Kongyan."



# Chapter 677: The Majestic Jeweled Visage

That sentence struck Fu Xia like a bolt of heavenly thunder. A flood of memories washed over him, and many of his earlier doubts began to clear. His voice was grave.

"Then why," he demanded, "are you so stubborn and unenlightened?"

"Unenlightened?"

Kongheng shook his head with a smile. "The next day, when I returned to the temple, I had forgotten every word the Mahas had spoken. I opened the scriptures to read, but as I looked upon them, the texts blurred before my eyes. The characters themselves leaped from the pages, one after another, and fled toward the lands of Zhao and Yan."

"I turned to look and saw the entire courtyard filled with a dense swarm of characters, like refugees from a famine, running hand-in-hand. A sea of words flowed down the mountain and vanished over the endless horizon."

"That night, every classic and scripture in Liaohe Temple turned to blank paper."

His words echoed slowly in the air. Li Ximing's face finally showed a glimmer of understanding. Kongheng gave a self-deprecating laugh.

"And that is why I am the worst at doctrinal debate."

Fu Xia was finally silent, sitting quietly. Kongheng continued in his warm voice.

"I was only eighteen that year. I had just finished reading the texts on cultivation techniques, interesting anecdotes, and secret histories. I was preparing to start on the scriptures, but from that day forward, there were no books left for me to read."

"Venerable senior, cultivators of all seven paths yearn for the ancient ways of Buddhism, for the chance to ascend to the position of a Revered One. They hope to find the true scriptures through me, but I can give you nothing. I have never read these things. My cultivation, to this day, has relied solely on my own heart for enlightenment."

A look of dawning comprehension crossed Fu Xia's face. He finally understood why Kongheng so often remained silent in the face of his refutations. His voice dropped. "The ancient scriptures are not suited for the modern path anyway."

"Correct," Kongheng said gently.

"I have read the core texts of all seven paths. The Way of Great Desire is boundless; one must first gain then lose in order to seek solemnity. The Way of Wrath manifests phenomena; it pacifies evil to create good, molding a Majestic Jeweled Visage`1. The Way of Adoring the Dharma seeks a realm; it establishes a Buddhist land in the mortal world to deliver all sentient beings."

"The Way of Precepts is one of bitter cold; it recognizes the sea of suffering and thus provides a ferry to cross it. The Way of Goodness and Joy clarifies the heart; it uses joy, anger, and folly to seek something from nothing. The Path of Compassion is held within; it nurtures all beings, and in turn, all beings nurture me. The Way of Emptiness is one of focus; it seeks liberation from the ego for the sake of rebirth..."

Kongheng spoke softly.

"All of you use a Pure Land to gather people."

"Venerable senior, it is not that I don't understand the fundamental principles. I too have entered a Pure Land. Whether the joy of the common people within is real or not, we can set that aside for now."

"But your esteemed path uses the suffering of the mortal world and the joy of the Pure Land to edify the people, to make them forget the material world in pursuit of a state of solemn, tranquil emptiness. But have they truly reached it? Has a single great divine power ever emerged from a Maha's Pure Land? In the end, is the Pure Land a Maha's personal divine property, or is it true liberation, untethered by suffering and joy?"

For the first time, Kongheng’s expression turned utterly serious. There was no anger, no admonishment, only deep contemplation and concern. His fair face, bathed in the five-colored light, seemed infinitely bright.

"It is neither... Venerable senior, it is neither."

Fu Xia stared at him in disbelief. For the first time, a thoughtful expression appeared on the old monk's face. The moment it did, his imposing aura faltered. "There are those who have achieved greatness in the Pure Land," he said coldly, "cultivators like Du'en and Liubai... You..."

Kongheng shook his head. "Have you ever seen them?" he asked softly.

Fu Xia's eyes lit up as he seized on the question. "Just because I have not seen them, does that mean they do not exist?"

"You have seen one," Kongheng replied softly, giving him no ground. Seeing Fu Xia's stunned expression, he pointed gently at the sky and smiled.

"Liubai is right up there."

Forgetting their conflict entirely, Fu Xia slowly raised a trembling head. High above the Radiant Origin Pass, the Six-Armed Vajra Guardian stood, its visage a mask of solemnity, its six arms pressing down firmly on the gate.

"You... How is that possible! Do not try to deceive me with such demonic words!"

Kongheng slowly shook his head, his voice very soft.

"This *is* the Majestic Jeweled Visage. This *is* the state of purity. This *is* the one from the Pure Land who has forgotten both self and the world. When I was eighteen, he came to me from the manifestation of Wrath to aid me. To this day, he has not uttered a single word."

Fu Xia did not know how to respond, lost in a daze of confusion.

"I know what my senior brother wants," Kongheng continued gently. "With the fall of the Four Wrathful Demon Emperor, the lineage of the Way of Wrath is in decline. He wants me to give rise to anger in my heart, to dedicate myself to the manifestation of Wrath, so that I might become a Maha and re-establish the tradition."

"Is that not so?"

After a moment of silence, Fu Xia answered, "It is."

Kongheng's expression was gentle, the light on his face growing ever brighter. He spoke in a kind and reasonable tone.

"And that is the problem. You believe the manifestation of Wrath is a good thing, so you want me to become it, and thus you have come to take me."

"You believe all living things suffer, so you must deliver them all. You must create a Pure Land of ultimate bliss. First, you let all beings endure the depths of suffering, and then you place them all within it, so that you may be revered and thanked."

He asked, "You condescendingly wish to deliver all sentient beings, but have any of them ever asked to be delivered by you?"

"Why would they not?!" Fu Xia's face changed. "The world is so full of suffering, and the Pure Land so full of joy! Take any hundred commoners from the lands of Yan and Zhao, and every single one of them would yearn to enter the Pure Land!"

"That is because their present world is too bitter," Kongheng said softly. "They seek only pleasure. As for the boundless peace, boundless purity, and boundless stability of the Majestic Jeweled Visage—that is not what the people seek. They suffer the seven passions, but they also enjoy the seven passions. A boundless Majestic Jeweled Visage is a boundless image of death. Only when the suffering becomes so great that they wish for death, so great that they no longer even want joy, only then are they willing to enter the Pure Land."

"You believe that everyone wants to enter the Pure Land, but the reality is that everyone is tortured until they have no choice but to want it."

"Nonsense!" Fu Xia retorted. "Who would not want the Majestic Jeweled Visage? Those who do not are simply not at a high enough spiritual state!"

Kongheng stood up. His voice remained soft and gentle.

"The Majestic Jeweled Visage is a state of boundless, ultimate tranquility. Every image is the same. It reacts to every situation in the exact same way. It is the same person. If ten thousand people cultivate it, it is really just one person occupying ten thousand bodies. Venerable senior Fu Xia, that is not how one cultivates a Revered One."

"In the name of cultivating a Revered One, you use a vast land of joy to delude millions, hoping to use the puppets of the Majestic Jeweled Visage to possess all of their souls! Meanwhile, you yourselves retain your seven passions and six desires, sitting high above, laughing at the world and calling it ignorant!"

"And there are those even more foolish, who in the end use the Majestic Jeweled Visage to possess themselves! Millions become one boundless, tranquil, pure, and stable image of death!"

Fu Xia stared at him, his voice hoarse. "Is that what the ancient scriptures say?"

Kongheng looked at him quietly, his voice warm.

"That is what I say."

As Kongheng's voice fell, the searing Li Fire began to climb his body. Li Ximing's urgent calls echoed again and again. Suddenly, Fu Xia's expression changed, all traces of conflict vanishing. He gazed at Kongheng, and his old face was filled with sincerity. Clear tears streamed from his eyes.

"If that is the case, then why does Kongheng not become a Maha?"

"Since all seven paths are wrong, Kongheng should ascend to the rank of Maha, establish a true Pure Land of his own, and teach the world the path to infinite liberation! He can turn this filthy world on its head and create the First and Truest Pure Land!"

"My Lord, return to the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple! We are willing to serve as your vanguards!"



# Chapter 678: Three Treasures

As Fu Xia spoke, the air blazed with a golden radiance. Clouds like peacock feathers danced across the sky as pools of shimmering gold erupted and a rain of colored light fell. To the north, a Pure Land materialized, veiled in mist. Through the haze, a colossal golden gate could be seen, beside which slumbered a single-horned tiger as massive as a mountain, its coat a canvas of black patterns. Ranks of golden guardians stood upon the clouds, a host so vast it seemed endless. Countless figures, thousands upon thousands, raised their heads in prayer and prostration, their faces filled with fervent hope.

For the first time, the Six-armed Vajra Guardian, Liubai, who had been relentlessly aiding the Radiant Origin Pass in suppression, hesitated. As the cry of a peacock echoed from the northern sky, its ever-wrathful, ever-tranquil head lifted. Its golden lips parted, and the melodious sound of chanting filled the air.

*Boom!*

The cultivators on the lake bowed their heads and shielded their eyes, daring not to look.

The vision was a potent stimulant to Fu Xia's spirit. He threw his head back, all thoughts of his dwindling spiritual qi and the searing Li Fire forgotten. The entire Radiant Origin Pass groaned and shifted with his movement, seeming on the verge of collapse.

'They can be saved… Good… Excellent…'

The old monk was overcome with ecstatic joy, tears streaming down his face. He turned a pleading gaze upon Kongheng, his voice a desperate cry.

“My lord, the Buddhist Pure Land has manifested! Please, for the sake of our Way, become the vessel for the Wrathful Pure Land! Return to the north to subdue the demons, enthrone yourself amidst a heavenly rain of mandara flowers, and for countless eons, attain the immeasurable power of the Maha!”

As if in response, a resonant bell tolled from within the golden haze to the north, sounding nine times.

*Dong… Dong…*

Kongheng gazed into the distance, the reflection of the Pure Land mirrored in his pupils.

He understood. If he just nodded, if he allowed even a flicker of the will to purify the world to arise within him, the seat of the Maha in the Pure Land would answer his call. He would become a practitioner like Murong Xia, attaining the ground of non-regression.

Once that state was achieved, he would be eternal. Unless someone could invade the Pure Land itself and extinguish the last spark of his true spirit, he could reincarnate for a hundred lifetimes with his mind and memories intact, forever enjoying the station of a *Maha*.

He would have no need to cultivate further in this life, for he would have already perfected the cultivation of a Master Monk. As an ancient cultivator, Kongheng’s next step was not to become a Merciful One, but a *Maha*. He would only need to journey north and reclaim his seat to become one of the most powerful beings in the realm, with the Dharma Master Realm itself within his grasp.

Yet, he simply watched in silence.

His own spiritual lineage ended here; all that remained was the pursuit of enlightenment. It had been ages since an ancient cultivator had become a *Maha*. If he missed this chance—a chance so rare that a Pure Land was personally extending an invitation to an outsider from a dying tradition—it would never come again.

“Venerable elder,” Kongheng said calmly, “the manifestation of Wrath is not my path.”

Fu Xia was a Merciful One. His tears turned to crystal in the Li Fire, only to be shattered by the Celestial Light, casting a chaotic dance of light and shadow across the old monk’s stunned face.

Kongheng looked at him serenely. The slender monk, with his naturally white teeth and red lips, was now suffused with a boundless radiance.

“My form is not the form of all living beings,” he declared. “I will not establish an infinite Pure Land. I will not create terrifying images. I will not build temples for incense, nor will I accept the worship of monks. All such things are but a source of negative karma.”

“Cultivators must not be made to believe in me. The common people must not be made to worship me. My path is one of liberation, not of gathering souls into a Pure Land.”

Fu Xia looked as if he’d been struck by lightning. The will went out of him, and he slumped, deflated. As his focus wavered, the light radiating from his Merciful One’s body dimmed. His back bent, the pressure upon him growing ever stronger.

The old monk remained motionless, staring at the sky as the scorching Li Fire licked at his body. He began to mutter sutras under his breath, watching as the golden radiance faded, bit by bit, until the giant tiger vanished back into the mist. All was lost.

The wrathful glare left Fu Xia’s face, replaced by an expression of desolate sorrow. “I was sharp-tongued and aggressive,” the old monk whispered. “I pressured you, berated you, and rebuked you with fierce, zealous doctrine, yet I could not stir a hint of anger in you. Had you felt even a moment of indignation, the Wrathful Pure Land would surely have descended upon you.”

“So I tried to overwhelm you with power, to intimidate you with the radiant majesty of a Merciful One. Had you felt a sliver of fear, you wouldn’t have even needed to nod or follow me. The Pure Land would have become yours.”

“Since you felt neither anger nor fear, I resorted to tears of grief. I tried to move you with sorrow, begging you to spread the doctrine to the world and sit enthroned as the teacher of all Buddhists. Had your heart swayed for even an instant, the Pure Land would have chosen you.”

Kongheng’s face remained radiant. The Li Fire around him gradually subsided as a crystal light flew from Fu Xia’s body. The old monk propped up the Radiant Pass with one hand. With his spiritual qi now flowing freely, his eyes filled with a crystalline light, and he stepped out of the flames.

The true power of a Merciful One was now in motion. Fu Xia could have shattered the Radiant Origin Pass without lifting a finger. The endless Li Fire now served only as his fuel, its flames making his body shimmer with even more vibrant colors.

“But you were unmoved,” Fu Xia said softly.

A hush fell over the lake, the onlookers staring in terror at the Merciful One. Only Kongheng’s voice was warm.

“The great *Maha*s have tried all this before.”

Kongheng smiled at him. The old monk removed his deep yellow kasaya, folded it neatly, and placed it in his palm. With his other hand, he laid a pure white staff on top of it.

After arranging the two items, he set them floating in the air before him. He pressed his palms together in a gesture of respect.

“Since this old monk came to this demonic land, I never intended to return. I have three treasures to gift you, Master Monk.”

“The first is the Mysterious Tiger-Stripe Kasaya. It was transformed from the Horned Tiger and possesses profound abilities. It can take the form of a fierce tiger under your command, capable of devouring all things and invincible against ordinary cultivators.”

“The second is the White Jade Demon-Subduing Staff. It is a treasured artifact that has vanquished countless demons. Its killing aura is so immense that the spirits of the slain would not dare to cry out for vengeance. A single strike can shatter mountains and part rivers.”

Kongheng frowned, the five-colored light on his face shifting. “These belong to the Northern Demon-Subduing lineage. I cannot accept them.”

But the old monk was stubbornly ignoring him. He held his clasped hands to his chest, his bare torso shimmering. He first kowtowed to the north, then closed his eyes and announced in a solemn voice, “The third is the Sarira of the Dharma Protector of the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple.”

These words finally broke Kongheng’s composure. He took a step forward, opening his mouth to intervene, but no matter how fast he was, he could not outpace a Merciful One.

The moment Fu Xia finished speaking, a pillar of crystalline light erupted, soaring to the heavens. Countless lotus blossoms bloomed across the lake’s surface, and a deluge of pink petals mixed with multicolored light rained down, bathing the world in a magnificent, boundless glow.

In an instant, Kongheng was engulfed. Fu Xia had been a Merciful One for many years. The moment he chose to pass on, the sound of sutras echoed through the world, the fiery prison shattered, and the ground was awash in gold and crimson.

*Ommmmm…*

But the Pure Land that should have come to receive him was gone. All the light and color converged, coalescing upon a single, crystal-colored sarira.

For all its splendor, for all its heaven-piercing brilliance, the vision lasted but a moment. Before it could fully bloom, it was drawn into the sarira like a great whale inhaling the sea, leaving not a trace behind.

The colors of the world receded, leaving only a single sarira hovering before Kongheng.

The lake grew even quieter.

The relic, about the size of a fingertip, floated in midair. It was pure white and crystalline, circled by rings of colored light that created various illusions. The lotuses on either side released waves of sweet fragrance.

Kongheng gazed at the sarira before him, then closed his hand around it and stored it away. The crimson and black light of dusk draped over him, and the light on the lake seemed unnaturally dim.

Fu Xia’s death was like that of the twelve Master Monks shot down over the great river by Li Xuanfeng. Aside from the sarira, there was only a brief shower of petals and crystal, and the blooming of a few lotuses.

And the Pure Land that had manifested for him offered no response to his death. There was no glimmer of gold, no tolling of a bell. The horizon held only the hazy crimson of a dying sun.

It wasn't until Li Ximing flew over that a sliver of celestial light fell upon Kongheng. The slender monk seemed to awaken from a dream. The five-colored radiance flowing over his face receded, and the infinite light within him dimmed.

He returned to his usual gentle and courteous demeanor, though his expression was somber. “I have caused you trouble, Ximing,” he said softly.

“How could you say such a thing!”

The Radiant Origin Pass had been a convergence of heavenly light, obscuring the view of the surrounding cultivators. Only Li Ximing, who had been watching from the side, had seen everything clearly. His expression was complicated, his heart filled with emotion. “Master Monk,” he asked quietly, “are you well?”

“I am fine,” Kongheng replied earnestly. He held the kasaya and staff in his hands. “However,” he said gently, “my karmic connection with your clan has now come to an end.”

Li Ximing had expected this. He closed his eyes and clenched his jaw. Kongheng bowed to him, his voice filled with guilt.

“I should have left when Xijun met his fate. But I felt responsible and wanted to watch over you a little longer. I never imagined I would nearly bring disaster upon your clan. The fault is mine. Now I must go. I must travel the world to validate my path.”

“Venerable Kongheng…”

Before Li Ximing could say more, Kongheng’s smile stopped the words in his throat. He lowered his voice. “Master Monk, please see my grandfather before you depart. It won’t be too late… You have been with my family for so many years… The elders hold you in the highest esteem… Zhouwei is still away… He won’t get to see you…”

Kongheng nodded gently. Li Ximing’s rambling voice was surprisingly similar to Li Xuanxuan’s, blurring the monk’s vision.

As he descended toward Mount Qingdu, he glanced back at the northern sky where Fu Xia had kowtowed before his death. The sarira in his hand grew hotter.

The brilliant golden haze had long since vanished. The soaring peacocks were gone. Everything the old monk had held more precious than his own life—the golden pools, the faithful followers—had disappeared as if carried away by the wind.

The lake was dim. The crystal light had scattered into the water, leaving only a gloomy sky and a half-dead sun sinking behind the clouds.

***

The Eastern Sea.

The night was deep. A palace of black, arcane stone stood upon a reef. It was not large, its dark walls blending seamlessly with the rock, and it faced north.

Waves crashed against the steps leading to the entrance. A pair of exquisite, azure boots stepped onto the stone. Their owner had a wild mane of crimson hair and wore golden clothes that shimmered like scales. His jade-green eyes stared into the distance.

Behind him stood a youth, impeccably dressed, at his side. The man in gold spoke in a low voice.

“Heyun, that was the domain of the Wrathful Four Demon Emperor…”

Dongfang Heyun raised an eyebrow and also looked toward the distant north, where peacocks danced and golden pools erupted as the Pure Land manifested. He bowed. “Great King, Buddhist cultivators achieve their Way through the power of the collective. The station of a *Maha* is an evolution of a Master Monk fruit. It is not something a mere immortal can fake.”

“Now that the *Maha*’s seat has sensed a call and sought to manifest a vessel in the mortal world, it means the being behind the Way of Wrath must be truly dead. No matter how many tricks he had up his sleeve, not even faking his own death could have accomplished this.”

If Li Xizhi had been present, he would have recognized the golden-robed man as Dongfang Changmu, the Dragon King of the Admirable Sea, a son of the Dragon Monarch himself, a being of incredible nobility.

The Purple Mansion demon dragon nodded in agreement.

Dongfang Heyun continued, “He was caught by the Golden Bridge Lock and killed by True Monarch Shangyuan. His chances of survival were minuscule. Whether the Wrathful Four Demon Emperor is dead is almost a secondary concern. The Six Phases wanted to test the state of the Master Monk being behind the Way of Wrath.”

“Judging by the current situation, it refused the meal placed right before its mouth and even let that ancient Buddhist Pure Land escape. It seems that Master Monk being is in a truly weakened state.”

“Not necessarily,” Dongfang Changmu said softly.

“Neither Mount Luoxia nor the Underworld reacted, and Jiangnan showed little interest. They probably already knew the Master Monk wouldn't respond. The real cause of this incident is that the ancient cultivator’s power was growing, and someone did not want him to remain in Jiangnan.”

“The followers of the Way of Wrath merely sensed an opportunity and came buzzing like flies to blood, making another futile attempt to awaken their master and summon a *Maha*.”

Dongfang Heyun bowed, his tone admiring. “The Great King’s insight is profound.”

Dongfang Changmu said quietly, “After all… times have changed. Buddhist cultivators have their own place in the world now, and many are wary of them. How could they simply allow an ancient Buddhist to cultivate in Jiangnan? What if he achieved sudden enlightenment overnight and a Pure Land enveloped all of Jiangbei? Would that not mean another war?”

Dongfang Changmu chuckled. “In the past, the Immortal Dao was complacent, allowing Buddhists to seek the path in various sects. The result was that the Dawn Qi fruit was secretly attained by Su Xikong, robbing the Dao of one of the Twelve Qis. The faces of several great immortals changed that day… A lesson learned the hard way.”

“Indeed…” Dongfang Heyun replied respectfully.

“What is the fox tribe’s response?” Dongfang Changmu asked.

Dongfang Heyun cupped his hands. “Mount Dali has sent the Plain-Hearted Fox. He has already made contact with His Highness Dingjiao. There are no issues.”

“Oh, the White Dragon lineage!” A playful smile touched Dongfang Changmu’s lips. He paced before the dark hall, a faint rumble of thunder echoing from the clouds above. The great Purple Mansion demon shook his head slightly. “As it should be. After all, Zipei gave that thing to the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea…”

Dongfang Changmu waited. A moment later, a streak of light cut through the sky, materializing into a woman with narrow eyes. She glanced around and said grimly, “Changmu, it’s time to move.”

Dongfang Changmu laughed and waved his hand. The Great Void before him split open, revealing a vast, violet expanse that stretched to the ends of existence.

The void here crackled with countless bolts of lightning that threatened to merge into a sea. Dongfang Changmu activated a divine art to shield himself from the electricity as he looked down at a pale purple Grotto-Heaven in the distance.

“Is everyone here?” he asked.

“Of course,” the dragoness replied. “We dragons do not act with the same convoluted methods as humans, with their subtle manipulations and grand strategies. Whatever those thunder cultivators were planning, we simply sent a few Purple Mansion Demon Kings to round them up.”

She added casually, “It took less than fifteen minutes. They’ve all been captured and thrown into the Grotto-Heaven.”



# Chapter 679: Departure

By the time Kongheng descended on the wind back to Mount Qingdu, the sky had completely darkened. Li Xuanxuan was waiting in the main hall, the old man’s spirit still unsettled, not yet recovered from the terrifying vision he had witnessed.

When Kongheng and Li Ximing landed safely, Li Xuanxuan hurried to greet them. Seeing them both unharmed brought a flicker of joy to his face, but as he looked from one to the other—at Li Ximing’s wistful expression and Kongheng’s complicated one—his relief faded.

“What is…?”

“Venerable Elder.”

Kongheng placed his palms together and bowed respectfully. “This humble monk is about to depart,” he said in his gentle voice. “I will travel through the prefectures, leave Jiangnan, and journey to other lands.”

“What!” Li Xuanxuan was stunned. “Have we offended you in some way, Master Monk?” he asked urgently. “We’ve been together for decades…”

The old man’s thoughts raced. “That monk, Fu Xia, was spouting nonsense. He was almost certainly targeting our family! You mustn't take it to heart, Kongheng.”

As Li Xuanxuan spoke, Kongheng simply held his hands together in a bow. “Venerable Elder, you have a fortunate countenance,” he said softly. “The first half of your life was fraught with hardship, but few trials remain ahead. It is best to worry less.”

Li Xuanxuan had no reply to that and could only nod.

“I have long considered Zhouwei’s situation,” Kongheng continued. “I originally thought we would have to trouble someone to purchase a Supreme Yin spiritual object from overseas, as they are exceedingly rare. Fortunately, I heard your clan has acquired a Supreme Yin Dharma artifact, which will serve perfectly.”

He retrieved a manuscript from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing. The pages were filled with meticulously handwritten characters, as small and neat as flies’ heads, clearly penned by the monk himself.

“Follow the methods in this book,” Kongheng instructed. “It will protect the mother and suppress the child’s spiritual nature, preventing it from being overwhelmed by the Bright Yang.”

Li Ximing was deeply moved and accepted the manuscript.

“However,” Kongheng added apologetically, “since I cannot perform the ritual myself, it will be difficult to grasp the precise balance of power. Too much Supreme Yin can cause its own problems. You must all be exceedingly careful and proceed with caution.”

“We will!” Li Ximing promised.

The monk bid farewell to Li Xuanxuan and made his way out, following the stone steps down to the halfway point of the mountain. The deer was lying numbly by the path, watching them quietly.

Kongheng paused. “He should not have done this to you,” he sighed.

With that, he took out the White Jade Demon-Subduing Staff.

In the moonlight, the treasured artifact had shrunk to the length of a forearm and the thickness of a finger. It gleamed brightly, its intricate patterns faintly visible on the surface.

“Now I have no choice but to make a trip to the north,” Kongheng lamented. “These items must be returned to the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple. The staff and the Mysterious Tiger-Stripe Kasaya are precious, and the sarira must be enshrined in a pagoda.”

Li Ximing had expected as much. ‘That old monk was cunning after all,’ he thought with a bitter heart. ‘He used every trick in the book, even sacrificing his own life, to force Kongheng to travel north. An ancient cultivator like Kongheng is a significant figure. He might survive the journey, but it’s doubtful his lineage will remain intact.’

The artifact was truly formidable. Merely holding it out caused waves of five-colored light to ripple across its surface. Li Ximing took a closer look, mentally calculating its power. ‘This is definitely not for the Foundation Establishment Realm. It’s at least equivalent to a Purple Mansion spiritual artifact. Three such items… they truly spared no expense.’

Kongheng lightly tapped the deer’s head with the staff. “Your crime did not merit this. You should be freed.”

The deer let out a whimper and thrashed on the ground. Its fur fell away like leaves in the wind, revealing a bloody, human form that rolled out from the mess.

The man’s face was smeared with deer blood. He looked dazed as he bowed. “Thank you, Master Monk.”

Kongheng draped a robe over him. “The dead cannot be brought back to life,” he said softly. “You must learn to accept your grief.”

The man lowered his head, his expression lost. “I have known only hardship since I was a child,” he mumbled. “Always hungry, always cold. I grew into a man with nothing to my name. My wife traveled a thousand miles to marry me, and we shared everything. Now she has been wrongly killed… I have nothing left to live for.”

Kongheng looked down at him. His mind-reading ability told him the man’s will to live was gone. He turned his head away.

‘If I had accepted the Pure Land’s call and embraced that karmic destiny, not only would this man have become a deer-bodied Arhat, but his wife might have been reborn in the Buddhist lands.’

Fortunately, the man was from Jiangnan, not from the lands where Buddhism held sway. If he had known more about the doctrine, he might have blamed Kongheng. As it was, having been both harmed and saved by the monk, he was merely confused.

Kongheng sighed gently. “Why not follow me north?” he offered. “You can seek answers from the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple as well.”

The man paused, a flicker of resentment in his eyes, but he nodded. His black hair fell out in clumps. He put on the offered robes and silently fell in line behind Kongheng.

Li Ximing watched this unfold with a nod of his own. He escorted them to the lakeshore. The night was deep, and the bank was silent and deserted, the only sound the soft crunch of their feet on the sand.

“You have come far enough, Ximing,” Kongheng said, pressing his palms together and urging him to return.

Li Ximing stopped and looked at him for a long moment, a sudden realization dawning on him. ‘With Kongheng’s departure, of those from my generation, I am the only one left.’

“Master Monk,” he said softly, “if you ever pass by Moongaze Lake again, please stop and rest. It would be my honor to host you. But perhaps by then, I will have failed and perished. Things will have changed, and this land may no longer bear the name Li.”

A faint smile touched Li Ximing’s lips, and his usual, slightly anxious demeanor shifted. “When that time comes,” he said with an air of self-possession, “do not perform last rites for me. Let me be utterly gone.”

“I would have no face to meet my ancestors, my father, or my elders.”

Kongheng placed his hands together in prayer and sighed, but said nothing more. With a final farewell, he departed. Li Ximing watched as the two figures walked away under the moonlight, eventually disappearing into the northern woods, before finally riding the wind back up the mountain.

His progress in the Jewel Steps realm was agonizingly slow. This brief emergence from his seclusion had caused little stir, as he had made scant progress—no more than ten or twenty percent of the way through his studies.

‘I fear even ten years may not be enough,’ he thought, his heart heavy as he landed back on his peak.

***

### The Eastern Sea

On the back of the Azurewater Scaled-Beast, among the cluster of palaces, lay a wide-open plaza. A high, azure platform stood at one end, set with three jade tables. Dingjiao sat at the head.

Below, two massive water beasts were locked in a vicious battle. One was a water elephant with thick, snow-white scales and long, sharp tusks. The other was a long-tailed, single-horned serpent, the horn on its brow glowing with a brilliant light.

The horn’s pale blue radiance cast a hazy mist before it. The water elephant thrashed and rolled, blood gushing from its eyes like springs, flowing down its scales and transforming into pearls as they hit the ground.

“Minghuang!”

Dingjiao’s majestic voice pulled Li Zhouwei’s attention back. The Dragon Prince was leaning against a seat of jade and coral, its armrests carved into the shape of two pristine white hook-serpent heads.

“What do you think of this profound light?”

Li Zhouwei set down his jade cup. “This Converging Water Profound Light is a fourth-grade art,” he noted, “but it excels in illusion and lacks killing power. Its myriad transformations can easily dazzle an opponent, but they cannot inflict lethal harm. In a one-on-one fight, it would struggle against a foe skilled in defense.”

Dingjiao nodded in agreement. Below, the two beasts fought to the death, but the Dragon Prince watched with a detached air, his pale blue eyes unfocused as he sipped his wine, his mind clearly elsewhere.

Li Zhouwei had been in the palace for some time. The Azurewater Scaled-Beast had already completed a full tour of the Vermillion Sea. Dingjiao, having tired of music and dance, had ordered the water beasts to fight for their entertainment.

Li Zhouwei had learned from a nearby demon attendant that the beasts were a Jewel-Scaled Ferry-Beast and an Azure-Necked Flood Dragon—neither was an ordinary creature. Either one could dominate a stretch of water on its own.

His own Wushao, meanwhile, wouldn't even have a chance to take the stage in the Eastern Sea. Only beasts like Lingu Lanying's White-Scaled Hook-Serpent or the Whole Pill Water Ape from the Converging Water Sea would have such an opportunity.

‘But before a True Dragon,’ Li Zhouwei reflected, ‘they are nothing more than playthings.’

He watched for a moment longer. As the Converging Water Profound Light gradually weakened, the Jewel-Scaled Ferry-Beast began to counterattack. Though he found the sight of such creatures fighting intriguing, his mind was preoccupied.

‘I wonder what has happened at the lake. Why have they kept me here for so long?’

His business in the Southern Sea had been concluded long ago, and he should have left. Yet Dingjiao and Bai Rong had insisted on taking him on a tour of the sea. The journey had been uneventful; it was clear they simply wanted to delay his return.

Though worried, Li Zhouwei could do nothing about it and had resigned himself to the situation. Just as he was lost in thought, a demon in silver armor with a gold mask and silver fangs hurried up the palace corridor. He carried two short halberds on his back and was clearly no ordinary soldier.

The demon approached Dingjiao’s high seat and seemed to whisper something using a secret technique. Dongfang Dingjiao’s hand, holding the jade cup, froze in mid-air, though his expression remained unchanged.

A moment later, the demon general bowed and departed. Dingjiao resumed his casual posture. Across from him, Bai Rong was clearly growing weary of the spectacle. He finally stood up with a smile.

“This has been a most pleasant conversation, but I cannot be away from my mountain for too long. I mustn’t impose on Your Highness any further.”

Dingjiao rose, exchanged a few pleasantries, and escorted them out of the hall. As they passed through the corridor, the two demon generals were still locked in a life-or-death struggle, their blood spattering and turning to pearls in mid-air, rolling to Dingjiao’s feet unnoticed.

After seeing them off, Dingjiao returned to the platform alone, the smile vanishing from his face.

The armored demon had obviously brought bad news. Dingjiao’s deep composure had allowed him to remain perfectly at ease in front of his guests, but the moment they were gone, his expression turned grim.

The Dragon Prince’s white horns began to glow faintly. He stood in silence, leaning on the azure railing, staring down at the two generals—demons who stood above tens of thousands of their kind—as they tore each other apart.

Though the esteemed guests had left, Dingjiao had not spoken, so the two creatures dared not slacken their efforts. They fought until their scales were shattered and their horns broken, the ground littered with dripping blood and rolling pearls.

Still, Dingjiao said nothing. He narrowed his pale blue eyes, and a suffocating tension filled the hall. It was obvious to anyone that the White Dragon Prince was in a foul mood. The guards on either side began to tremble, not daring to look up.

After a full quarter of an hour, a demon general with bulging gills and black armor could bear it no longer. He knelt down, trembling with fear, and said respectfully, “Your Highness, the Dragon Monarch’s birthday has just passed. It would be… inauspicious for high-ranking demons to die in a duel.”

This general, Ranwu, had served Dingjiao for many years and was no ordinary subordinate. At this moment, with the prince’s anger palpable, he was the only one in the hall who dared to speak.

Dingjiao didn’t answer. With a dark face, he turned and strode back into the hall, the doors slamming shut behind him with a boom.

The demon general felt as if a death sentence had been lifted. Terrified, he silently waved his hands frantically. The two combatants below immediately ceased their fight, kowtowed several times toward the main hall, and scrambled away.

Outside, a wave of relief washed over the attendants. Inside, the hall was empty, silent, and gloomy, lit only by the faint glow of lamps.

Dingjiao walked all the way to his high seat, then with a sudden sweep of his sleeve, sent a cascade of jade pots and cups crashing to the floor with a series of sharp, clear clinks.

His face abruptly elongated, revealing rows of sharp, white fangs. Snowy-white dragon whiskers sprouted from his neck, and the color of his eyes deepened intensely. The tables and chairs in the hall began to tremble and rattle.

“Mount. Luo. Xia!”

He ground out the name, his voice like thunder, yet it was trapped within the hall, echoing off the walls and making everything vibrate.

***

Once they were clear of the sea’s surface, where the Azurewater Scaled-Beast waited in the shallows, Bai Rong’s reason for leaving became clear. He produced his two-wheeled chariot, flopped onto it with a groan, and sighed.

“Gods, that was exhausting!”

All the elegance and composure he had displayed were thrown to the winds. He reverted to his lazy, slovenly self, his feet dangling over the side of the cart as he whined and refused to even steer the artifact.

After so long under the sea, Li Zhouwei found the fresh scent of the sea breeze incredibly refreshing. With Bai Rong on strike, he had no choice but to pilot the chariot westward, back toward the mainland.

Bai Rong lay there for some time, only stirring when they reached the salt lake. “Careful, slow down,” he mumbled, before adding with a laugh, “Life as a dragon is just that boring. They can’t wander around human territory, and no matter how much trouble the sea demons get into, it’s never as interesting as what humans come up with. That dueling spectacle… humans were bored of that back in the Zhou Dynasty! I was about to die of boredom.”

Li Zhouwei grunted in acknowledgment, offered a few words of praise for Dingjiao, and then asked softly, “A lot must have happened at my family’s lake while we were gone. Do you have any news, senior?”

He was worried about his family and had been rushing back, but Bai Rong had advised him to slow down, which suggested the problem wasn’t critical. Now was his chance to get answers from the fox.

Bai Rong paused for a moment. “Nothing much,” he said with a smile. “A Merciful One from the Way of Wrath saw an opportunity and came sniffing around to drive away your family’s monk. If you had been at the lake, the other cultivators would have been delighted to get a measure of your true power.”

The fox didn’t bother with pretense. He gazed at the distant sea view, his tone calm. “You have to understand, Bright Yang isn’t just a power that allowed Buddhist cultivators to topple an immortal dynasty. There was also a Bright Yang Buddhist figure, the Undefeated King of Brightness!”

“If that monk had truly accepted the Way of Wrath and its karmic path, with you present at the lake, it would have been a perfect reenactment of the old tale. They would have dragged you, a White Qilin, into their Pure Land to become the new Undefeated King of Brightness and packed you off to the north!”

“Oh?” Li Zhouwei pictured Kongheng’s face in his mind.

Bai Rong shook his head and chuckled. “But even a Maha couldn’t persuade him, let alone a mere Merciful One. I told you it was a minor problem. There was no need for us to get involved, and besides, it was a good precaution to take.”

Li Zhouwei thanked him softly. “So, Buddhist cultivators can also cultivate Bright Yang…” he mused.

“‘Bright Yang’ is a Fruition Attainment. It doesn’t distinguish between immortal, Buddhist, demon, or devil!” Bai Rong said, shifting to a more comfortable position. “The Undefeated King of Brightness was a creation of Buddhist methods to begin with. After Su Xikong seized the ‘Radiant Essence,’ the Buddhist lands gained their glorious light, and their cultivators gained treasured artifacts. Just imagine how wonderful it would be for them if they could also get their hands on ‘Bright Yang’…”



# Chapter 680: Two Qis

“‘Bright Yang’…”

Li Zhouwei considered the past. The fall of the Wei and Li dynasties had been orchestrated by Buddhist cultivators, so it was only natural that the northern Buddhists would have designs on the Fruition Attainment. “So it would seem,” he ventured, “that with the death of the Undefeated King of Brightness, the Buddhists lost their bid for the ‘Bright Yang’ Fruition Attainment.”

“Correct.”

Bai Rong’s mouth snapped shut. It was a long moment before he uttered the single word. Li Zhouwei took the hint and asked no more, sitting quietly on the Dharma artifact as it flew on.

‘Dingjiao…’

The Dragon Prince had certainly treated him well, but a deep-seated suspicion lingered in Li Zhouwei’s heart, a doubt he never dared to show, given the Dragon Clan’s immense power.

‘The Azure Pond Sect and Mount Luoxia are no saints, but is the Dragon Clan any better? The matter of the thunder-swallowing scheme is still unresolved, and for thousands of years, the dragons have rarely played a noble role…’

The Dragon Clan’s plot to devour the thunder had been in motion for years. Li Qinghong’s fate in the sea was still unknown, and there was no way Dongfang Dingjiao was ignorant of it. Yet the Dragon Prince had acted as if nothing was amiss, laughing and conversing with him, treating him with immense warmth.

Throughout his stay in the palace, Li Zhouwei had maintained a calm facade, offering smiles where appropriate. It was all the face he could give Dingjiao. Firstly, the Dragon Prince’s station was noble. Secondly, by befriending him, he hoped he might create even a sliver of a chance for Li Qinghong’s survival.

‘And in the worst-case scenario, if the matter with the Dragon Clan is already beyond saving and our elders are doomed, I absolutely cannot let the dragons think our family harbors a grudge. Saying nothing, acting as if I don’t care at all, is the best course of action.’

If he were to bring up Li Qinghong to Dingjiao, it would lay his concerns bare. The consequences of a refusal from the Dragon Prince were not something the Li family could endure. And so, Li Zhouwei had acted as if he had no worries in the world. Only now, away from the dragon palace, did he allow himself to think on it.

‘Dingjiao’s casual attitude means one of two things: either the thunder cultivators involved in the scheme will at most lose their cultivation and not their lives, or he sees me purely as a White Qilin, an entirely different species from the Li family members I consider kin.’

Despite Dingjiao’s repeated courtesy, Li Zhouwei found it impossible to truly connect with him, let alone reveal his inner thoughts. All their interactions had been polite formalities. ‘The true nature of my family’s relationship with the Dragon Clan, the real reason for Dingjiao’s friendliness… the answers will likely only surface after the thunder-swallowing affair concludes.’

‘Unfortunately, Bai Rong and Dingjiao delayed me for too long. I can no longer go to the Southern Sea. I’ll have to wait for the next opportunity…’

Li Zhouwei spent some time cultivating cross-legged on the artifact before they finally reached Moongaze Lake. The moment they arrived, Bai Rong sprang to life.

“Next time something like this comes up, you can count me out, even if it kills me,” the fox sighed. “It was both boring and exhausting…”

He was a homebody who preferred to stay holed up on his mountain peak and was already eager to return. He flatly refused Li Zhouwei’s invitation to stay and fled on his artifact as if escaping a plague.

Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, rode the wind down to the island. As he made his way to the main hall, he found a youth in pleated robes waiting outside. The boy’s body radiated a golden spiritual qi as sharp as a sword. Seeing Li Zhouwei, he quickly stepped back and bowed.

“Third Brother!”

“Zhouluo, you’re here.”

Li Zhouwei had only met this fourth brother of his a few times, but Li Zhouluo bowed with profound respect. “It has been a long time, Third Brother. You labor so hard for the family, traveling far and wide. We other brothers are not as capable and can only help with small matters at home. The thought fills me with shame.”

Li Zhouwei gave him a surprised look and nodded. “You’re too kind, Fourth Brother. We all simply have our roles to fulfill. Since you have reached Qi Refinement, you are a pillar of the family. You must not belittle yourself.”

“I will take your words to heart.”

Li Zhouluo smiled. His innate talent was second only to Li Zhouwei’s among the Zhou generation. As a descendant of Li Xizhi’s line, his aptitude was naturally high. Though he lacked a Talisman Seed, he had reached Qi Refinement at eighteen, only slightly slower than Li Xijun had been.

His golden aura flowed like stalks of wheat, splitting into six streams that circled his body with long, fiery tails, as nimble as sparrows. It highlighted the brightness in his eyes, giving him the sharp, spirited air of youth.

He was cultivating the *Gleaming Gold Spirit-Searching Art*, a rather impressive ancient technique. The Li family had recently acquired the Gleaming Gold Feather Liquid when they broke a great restrictive formation, making it possible to practice the art. As the first to do so, Li Zhouluo was naturally full of vigor.

Li Zhouwei had a good impression of him. He nodded and smiled. “I have reviewed the *Gleaming Gold Spirit-Searching Art*. I believe it has the potential of a fourth-grade technique, no worse than any other. Cultivate it well.”

This unexpected praise brought a thrilled look to Li Zhouluo’s face. He followed Li Zhouwei into the hall.

“Where are First Brother and Second Brother?” Li Zhouwei asked casually, referring to Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang. They were older than him, so he had seen more of them over the years and knew them better.

Li Zhouluo smiled. “They are both in seclusion beneath Mount Qingdu. They are expected to reach Qi Refinement within the next two years.”

“Excellent!” Li Zhouwei praised, partly for his two brothers’ progress and partly in approval of Li Zhouluo’s open and generous attitude. His voice softened considerably. “My father has been in seclusion for a long time, and Aunt Minggong and Uncle Chenghuai are also at the point of breaking through to Foundation Establishment. The sooner you all reach Qi Refinement, the sooner you can take up the family’s burdens.”

Li Zhouwei knew his own standing. Few uncles could speak to him so casually, let alone his brothers. He clapped Li Zhouluo on the shoulder. “Both Kongheng and I have left the Eastern Sea, leaving Zongquan Island unguarded. Once your two older brothers emerge from their seclusion, the three of you should discuss who will lead a party to the Eastern Sea to stand guard.”

“As the family head commands,” Li Zhouluo said respectfully.

Li Zhouwei smiled and dismissed him, his previously heavy mood lifting considerably. He walked up the steps to the rear hall, where Li Xuanxuan, having heard the news, was hurrying to meet him, his face filled with hope.

“Minghuang, what did the Dragon Prince have to say?”

Li Zhouwei first invited him to sit down in the hall. He hesitated for a breath before speaking softly. “It is still uncertain if there is a chance for a turn of events. At the very least… His Highness Dingjiao gifted me a treasure in thanks.”

He took out the Concealed Plunder Gold and recounted his journey, omitting and altering details as necessary. The old man shook his head as he listened, and in turn, told Li Zhouwei about the incident with Fu Xia.

Finally, Li Xuanxuan dropped the subject. He took two jade slips from his robes and placed them in Li Zhouwei’s hands. “Minghuang,” he said gravely, “we must begin preparing the spiritual qis for the two children.”

Li Zhouwei accepted the slips, his spiritual sense sweeping over them.

“Bright Parting Blazing Essence: One must find a place where the earth’s veins of Li Fire converge. Then, using four types of Li Fire—Profound Yang, Contemplating Fire, Celestial Yang, and Surging Li—one must refine baleful fire, extracting the essence of the four Li Fires. This essence must then be exposed to celestial light for six months to produce a single wisp. Ten wisps make one portion.”

“Supreme Instrument Whole Mercury: One must find a place where the properties of things change and transform. Using a treasure from a Whole Pill cultivator as a nexus, yin and yang spiritual objects for balance, and five-element treasures for regulation, one can produce a single wisp every one hundred and eighty-one days. Ten wisps make one portion…”

This was the gist of the two slips; the rest of the details were operational techniques and tricks. The texts were far longer than typical qi-gathering manuals. Li Zhouwei had already read them.

“Both of these are troublesome,” Li Xuanxuan said in a low voice. “The complex methods are a secondary concern. The main problems are finding the spiritual fires and a place where the properties of things change… Do you have any ideas, Minghuang?”

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment. “Grand-uncle Ximing has a Li Fire flag,” he asked. “It contains five types of Li Fire. Do you know which ones they are?”

Li Xuanxuan had already considered this. He took out the crimson-yellow flag. “I’ve already asked him. It has five types of Li Fire, but only Contemplating Fire and Surging Li match our needs. The other three are different. We are still missing two.”

“He also gave me the location of a place in the Eastern Sea with Li Fire earth veins, perfect for gathering qi.”

Li Zhouwei thought for a moment and immediately had a plan. “Elder, do you remember the Intercalary Sun Art? The only spiritual fire in the family belongs to Grand-uncle Ximing, his Long-March Pheasant Flame. That fire was converted from Profound Yang Li Fire.”

At his words, the old man nodded. “So, if we reverse the art to convert it back to Profound Yang, we’ll have one of the two we need. We’ll just be missing Celestial Yang. Where can we find that?”

“There’s no need to look elsewhere.” Li Zhouwei shook his head. “Elder, you probably haven’t read the Intercalary Sun Art in detail. Celestial Yang is also part of the conversion process. We can first use Profound Yang for the refinement, then use the Contemplating Fire and Surging Li from the flag. While that’s happening, someone else can convert the Profound Yang into Celestial Yang. They can then return and continue the process. There is no need to search for it.”

“Good.” Li Xuanxuan nodded in sudden understanding.

“Aunt Minggong cultivates fire arts,” Li Zhouwei continued. “She will have to make the trip. Have her take An Siwei and a few others to the Eastern Sea. From what I see, the location Grand-uncle gave is near the Suzhù Reefs, so it should be relatively safe.”

Li Xuanxuan, however, doted on the younger generation. “Minggong and Siwei are always burdened with tasks. It seems a bit unfair…”

“The arrangements will be handled properly,” Li Zhouwei said soothingly. “We can use this as an opportunity. When they return, we will give them Essence Gathering Pills and have them break through.”

“Excellent!” Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan relaxed considerably.

Li Zhouwei was always decisive in handling clan affairs. He was already thinking about the Supreme Instrument Whole Mercury. “A place where the properties of things change and transform… I’ve never heard of such a thing, but I know a place that fits the description perfectly.”

Li Xuanxuan had been agonizing over these problems for some time. He raised his eyebrows expectantly.

“Chengshui Marsh!” Li Zhouwei declared. “That place was the site of a great battle. It was once suppressed by the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, turning it into a sea of Pristine water. Then, it was transformed into converging water by the combined efforts of several Purple Mansion cultivators. I can think of no place that better fits the description of a place where the properties of things change!”

“As for the Whole Pill treasure… the family possesses a drop of mercury of a rather high grade. It belongs to a Whole Pill cultivator, so others cannot use it, which is why it has been kept in storage. Now is the perfect time to use it.”

Hearing how easily he had arranged everything, Li Xuanxuan readily agreed.

“However,” Li Zhouwei added, “Chengshui Marsh is dangerous. It would be best to have a Foundation Establishment cultivator overseeing the operation. We will have to ask Elder White Ape and Li Wen to make the trip.”

“You arrange it as you see fit!” With the spiritual qis for the children now secured, Li Xuanxuan was greatly relieved and departed in high spirits.

The hall fell silent. Li Zhouwei waited for a moment before taking out the jade slip recording the Intercalary Sun Art. He stroked the patterns on its surface, his eyes narrowed in thought.

‘What a powerful technique… what a convenient technique…’

He knew this had come from Tu Longjian. He even suspected that the Intercalary Sun Art was one of the most crucial core legacies of the Dongli Sect. The thought was chilling.

‘This thing… why isn’t a single secret art locked? How could it not be locked! To be read so freely by anyone!’

No one in the world would be foolish enough not to place security restrictions on their cultivation arts. Their own family’s *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture* had been sitting inaccessible for nearly a hundred years for that very reason. How could a great power like the Dongli Sect leave such a critical legacy completely unguarded?

‘And the Whole Pill treasure… Chengshui Marsh just happens to exist… and we just happen to have a drop of mercury. Even if the mercury wasn't suitable, there’s still that Purple Mansion spiritual object stored with Hengzhu.’

Li Zhouwei pushed the thoughts aside. He casually approved the scrolls on his desk, setting down his vermilion brush before allowing himself a moment of contemplation.

‘Now even Kongheng has been forced away. If more trouble comes, it will be difficult to handle…’

Elder White Ape was about to head north to gather qi. The family once had many Foundation Establishment cultivators, but now their ranks felt empty. After a moment, he summoned Chen Yang.

Chen Yang, now at the fifth level of Qi Refinement, entered and cupped his fist in a salute.

“Zongquan Island has been empty for too long,” Li Zhouwei said in a low voice. “First, have Guest Elder An make a trip to the Eastern Sea. If Uncle Cheng is out of seclusion, have him return at once.”

He paused, then added, “If there is any other news, write back immediately.”

Chen Yang bowed and departed. Li Zhouwei sat in silence for a quarter of an hour, then abruptly waved his hand. The great doors of the hall boomed shut, sealing him off from any outside disturbances or prying eyes.

While the sun was high, he took out the stone box containing the Bright Yang object, the Concealed Plunder Gold.

‘Once this object leaves the deep sea, it must not be exposed to moonlight. A single glimpse of the moon will instantly transform it into Balanced Qi.’

A pale gray spiritual water swirled inside the box, reflecting a tiny point of bright yellow light. His spiritual sense, however, could detect nothing. Li Zhouwei simply channeled his spiritual qi and raised the box before him.

He felt a faint heat on his brow, and the bright yellow reflection in the box vanished in an instant.

A point of bright light appeared within his Shengyang Acupoint. His spiritual sense felt as hot as fire. Li Zhouwei steadied his mind and began to circulate the art for Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. The point of light immediately shot downward like a falling comet, trailing a searing tail of flame through the twelve-storied tower of his throat and plunging into his Juque Palace.

Li Zhouwei kept his eyes closed for a long time as light and shadow flickered around him. Finally, he exhaled a breath of celestial light that filled the hall with a brilliant golden glow. He opened his eyes, the gold within them slowly fading.

“A fine treasure.”

The flow of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, which had previously circulated sluggishly in his Juque Palace before slowly rising to his Shengyang Acupoint, was now several times thicker and moved with incredible speed. With just a thought, it could erupt from between his brows in a matter of breaths.

‘Never mind how much its power has increased, this speed of circulation finally makes it usable in actual combat…’

He had not been practicing Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light for long. A normal cultivator at their peak could mobilize it in a few breaths. By the time he perfected this Dharma light, he might be able to unleash it in a single breath.

The Concealed Plunder Gold was far more useful than he had imagined. Li Zhouwei was in a good mood, but he wasn’t satisfied yet. He left the hall, took to the air, and flew to Mount Qingdu, where he retrieved two jade slips from the ancestral shrine.

Both techniques were appendices from the *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun*.

One was a sixth-grade Li Fire profound light: Great Parting’s White Brilliance! The other was a fifth-grade Solar Li Fire art: the Sun’s Resonant Parting Art!

‘My family’s Bright Yang lineage is closely related to Li Fire. Cultivating Great Parting’s White Brilliance should be as suitable for me as it is for a cultivator of fire virtue.’

‘As for the Sun’s Resonant Parting Art… although it is not a Dharma light, it is a Solar Li Fire art. Since the Concealed Plunder Gold is a solar Bright Yang object, it might even provide an enhancement!’

# Chapter 681: Ambush (Part 1)

The Eastern Sea.

Night rippled across the water, but Green Pine Island remained brightly lit. The forests on the Azure Pond Sect’s immortal peak had been thinned, replaced by a grove of iron pillars. Streaks of dark red blood, remnants of some unknown beast, trickled down the metal, slowly turning to smoke.

A middle-aged man with a sinister air emerged from the forest of pillars, the treasures hanging from his waist jingling with every step. Upon seeing him, a group of cultivators hurried to offer fawning greetings.

“Greetings, Lord Fei!”

This was Fei Luoya, once a disciple of Mount Wu. He had visited the Li family several times in the past, begging for a path to escape his circumstances, only to be captured by Li Xuanfeng and sent to serve the Ning family. Decades had passed since then.

Fei Luoya’s reddish eyes flickered over them, but he offered no reply. A few guest elders scurried to his side, attending to his every need with obsequious praise.

Fei Luoya was ruthless and cunning. He had spent years clawing his way up the ranks through any means necessary. Hailing from Mount Wu, he was well-versed in the treacherous shamanic arts, which proved highly effective in the Southern Borderlands and fueled his steady ascent.

A few years ago, he had finally caught the eye of the Ning family’s main lineage and earned the trust of Ning Hejing, rising to his current station. No matter how much these Azure Pond guest elders might despise him in private, they had to address him as “Lord” to his face.

Fei Luoya untied a jade pearl from his waist and swept it around him, creating a barrier to prevent eavesdropping. Only then did he speak in a low voice.

“Have you scanned the area with your Dharma artifacts? Is there any movement from the Earth Abyss?”

“None, my lord,” one of the men replied, stepping forward. He presented a palm-sized, turquoise mirror with both hands. “Li Xizhi has not been seen for years. It is likely he has already perished.”

“Not even the Flowing Light Mirror can detect him.”

Fei Luoya pocketed the ancient Dharma artifact. Years ago, he had been nothing but a poor member of the Eastern Yue. Now, he casually used treasures that chimed and clattered as he walked.

‘He’s from the Eastern Yue, through and through,’ the guest elder thought, his face a mask of smiles while his mind churned with disdain. ‘He’ll never lose that tacky habit of hanging every trinket he owns on his body…’

Fei Luoya glanced at him but said nothing. With a flick of his sleeve, he dismissed the crowd and turned back into the iron forest.

Within a pocket of absolute darkness, Ning Hejing sat clad in soft red armor. Opposite him, a portly monk sat with his hands pressed together, a faint smile on his face. A small, sealed letter lay on the stone table between them.

Ning Hejing’s expression was grim. He watched Fei Luoya approach before picking up the letter again.

“A message from the sect.”

The letter was creased from being opened and refolded dozens of times. “Chi Fubo’s people have already left the sect,” Ning Hejing said gravely.

The violent energies within the Earth Abyss had gradually subsided. Li Xizhi was not yet dead, which meant his emergence was only a matter of time. Ning Hejing considered this for a moment, then asked, “Master Monk Liaokong, what news from Chi Zhihu?”

The monk, Liaokong, had a fortunate and guileless appearance. He smiled amiably. “Chi Zhihu plans to make his move against Li Xizhi above the Sea of Reefs. The grand formation is already in place. The moment Li Xizhi passes through, the formation will be activated to ensure his demise.”

“Good…” Ning Hejing’s voice was calm and low. “With you as his backup, Chi Zhihu will have no trouble killing him. And once he does, Si Yuanli will no longer be able to feign ignorance!”

Ning Hejing spoke as if the two were his most trusted confidants, making no effort to hide his intentions. “I must thank you, Master Monk. This plan could not have succeeded without your aid.”

He had chosen to promote Fei Luoya because the man was resourceful and, more importantly, held a grudge against the Li family for seizing his territory, which made him relatively trustworthy. But the one he truly valued was the monk before him.

‘The enemy of my enemy is my friend.’

Setting aside the long-standing conflicts between the Li family and the Buddhist cultivators, the eighteen monks Li Xuanfeng had slain on the river were reason enough. Ning Hejing had seen with his own eyes how deeply Liaokong was committed to the Li family’s destruction and how much effort he had poured into this scheme.

“Daoist Master Suiguan is, after all, a Chi. With Chi Buzi away, it seems Daoist Master Yuanxiu truly has no interest in the position of sect master. The Si family, however, will not be so easily bullied. The moment Li Xizhi dies, Si Yuanli will be forced to retaliate.”

Liaokong sought to eliminate an enemy of his faith, while Ning Hejing wanted to spark a war between Chi Fubo and the Si family. Their goals aligned perfectly. Liaokong had immediately set about approaching Chi Zhihu. That old brute was hot-tempered and had been desperately seeking allies to deal with Li Xizhi; the monk’s arrival was a godsend.

Ning Hejing reviewed the plan in his mind and found no flaws. “That snake demon is nothing special,” he muttered. “It’s a miracle he even survived the Earth Abyss. But even if his luck holds, what can one man and one demon do? Chi Zhihu has three allies, plus you, Master Monk, all concealed by a grand formation. There is no escape!”

“Once Chi Zhihu has killed Li Xizhi, you will immediately reincarnate back in the north, and our hands will be clean…”

Fei Luoya listened, then frowned. “But… my lord, the Earth Abyss has many exits. What if Li Xizhi returns to Green Pine Island to recuperate instead of heading for the Sea of Reefs? Wouldn’t the trap be for nothing?”

Ning Hejing laughed. “That is where you are mistaken.”

The fat monk beside him gave Fei Luoya a meaningful look and shook his head. “Benefactor… this is the result of a divination I performed a few days ago. I needed one of his personal belongings, but unfortunately, Changtian Peak was inaccessible.”

“Fortunately, Li Xizhi once resided on Qingsui Peak. Using an item obtained from Peak Master Yuan, I was able to divine that Li Xizhi has already reached the Sea of Reefs.”

“In fact, he arrived there some time ago and is healing in secret. I will be taking my leave of you two shortly to head there myself.”

Ning Hejing smiled at Fei Luoya. “I only just learned of this myself and hadn’t had a chance to tell you.”

Fei Luoya feigned a sudden understanding, showering them with praises for their brilliance. The two men laughed heartily, but a chill crept through the Eastern Yue man’s heart.

‘He doesn’t trust me.’

Fei Luoya didn’t believe for a second that Ning Hejing had “only just learned” this. All his efforts—sending him to scan the various branches of the Earth Abyss with Dharma artifacts, ordering him to search everywhere—had been nothing but a diversion. He had been deceived along with everyone else.

The man stood silently, his expression serene, but a storm of thoughts raged within him.

***

The Sea of Reefs.

Located on the edge of the Hetian Sea, the water here was shallow and dotted with countless stone reefs. Li Xizhi emerged from a tunnel at the bottom of the sea, having just arrived.

He had hidden in the Earth Abyss for a long time but remained in good condition. Li Wushao, however, was listless and had yet to recover. The old demon, now in human form, was so pale and weak he could barely move. He remained behind to recuperate in a temporary cave residence carved near the exit.

The Dawn Rayfish, Li Qiyun, had fared better. The orange feathers on his cheeks were much brighter now. He had already reverted to his true form to carry Li Xizhi north. Man and fish became a streak of rosy light, moving at astonishing speed.

Li Xizhi consulted a map in his hand. “The nearest market is just ahead,” he said softly. “I’ve been down there for years, and my supply of pills is completely depleted. We’ll buy some more so Wushao can properly heal…”

He seemed utterly without a care, yet his eyes constantly swept over the reefs below, as if searching for something. After flying for a short while, the water beneath them began to boil. Several pillars of white light shot into the sky, coalescing into a shimmering white barrier.

“Li Xizhi!”

A thunderous shout echoed across the sea. Li Xizhi brought the Dawn Rayfish to a halt and looked up. Several figures had appeared above the water. The leader, a Foundation Establishment cultivator with a coarse face and a triumphant expression, was none other than Chi Zhihu.

Behind him stood three guest elders: two middle-aged men in red robes at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, and an elderly man in white robes at the late-Foundation Establishment Realm. They all looked familiar; they were Chi Zhihu’s trusted retainers, and Li Xizhi recognized every one of them.

‘Guest Elder Zhao, a Bright Yang cultivator; Xia Yun, who cultivates Molten Fire; and Wu Weibai, the Eastern Yue man stationed overseas…’

Li Xizhi’s gaze swept over them without a trace of fear. He smiled warmly. “Is there anyone else? You might as well all come out at once.”

“You!”

Chi Zhihu had long harbored a deep dislike for Li Xizhi. Seeing the young man’s fearless expression as he rode a magnificent Dawn Rayfish, his triumph quickly soured into vigilance. He remained silent.

He scanned the Dawn Rayfish with his spiritual sense and found it was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. Relief washed over him. Without giving Li Xizhi a chance to speak, his expression hardened. “Attack!”

In an instant, three beams of Dharma light shot toward Li Xizhi. One was as brilliant as the sun and blindingly fast. Another was searingly hot, attempting to envelop him in flames. The last was a cool, pristine light that snaked through the air, watching him like a venomous serpent.

These three were not merely guest elders of the Azure Pond Sect; they were Chi Zhihu’s most trusted followers. The Dharma lights they unleashed were dazzling and far from ordinary. Chi Zhihu himself stood ready, his hands forming a series of seals as potent spiritual energy pulsed around him.

“Impressive,” Li Xizhi praised with a nod. He gave the Dawn Rayfish a gentle pat, and the creature vanished from beneath his feet. A cauldron-shaped rosy light appeared in his hands as he gave his sleeve a light flick.

“Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron!”

The Dharma light that shone like the sun had barely reached him when it was sucked into his palm as if by a great whale, disappearing completely. With another flick of his sleeve, Li Xizhi released the stored energy as a brilliant glow that collided with the searing red light, shattering it into a shower of sparks.

The initial probe was over. Li Xizhi’s form dissolved into several streaks of rosy light, leaving the last Dharma light to dart about aimlessly like a headless fly.

“What a technique…” Wu Weibai, the sole late-Foundation Establishment cultivator among the four, murmured in admiration. His Dharma sword flew from his hand, only to collide with something moving at incredible speed. It wobbled and fell back into his grasp.

Two streaks of rosy light reappeared from the opposite direction. Li Xizhi’s shadow flickered in the air as he sheathed his sword, then vanished once more.

‘His movement technique has reached a profound level!’

The four attackers froze. The elder, Wu Weibai, had seen Lingu Xia in action years ago and knew just how troublesome these elusive light cultivators could be. “Your Highness!” he said gravely.

Chi Zhihu, though reluctant, drew a mirror from his sleeve. He hadn’t expected to need it so soon, and being forced to use it after a single exchange was a blow to his pride.

*Hum!*

The mirror was clearly no ordinary artifact. The moment it appeared, a moving speck of rosy light became visible within the grand formation. A ray of sunlight shot out from the mirror, chasing after the speck.

*Tss!*

While the mirror’s detection ability was formidable, its offensive power was lacking. The ray of sunlight struck the rosy light and vanished without a trace. In return, a brilliant glow shot back toward them—another victim of Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron.

The four had studied Li Xizhi’s *Dawn Dew Gathering Technique* before the ambush and were familiar with its techniques. They recognized Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron at once.

‘Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron is not an easy art to master… He must have spent a great deal of effort on it.’

Chi Zhihu’s eyebrows twitched. He deflected the returned attack with a quick reaction, and a bead of white light pulsed in his hand. “No more delays! Finish this quickly!” he commanded coldly.

He was confident that his preparations were more than sufficient. Four cultivators should have been enough to suppress Li Xizhi, and he still had the monk hiding in the shadows. His only fear was that reinforcements might arrive. “Stop being so timid!” he roared.

*Clang!*

The bead of white light shot from his hand and struck something in mid-air. Unable to dodge, Li Xizhi materialized from the rosy light, his expression finally turning serious. He brought his hands together in a seal.

“Scatter.”

A burst of rosy light erupted from his hands, momentarily pushing the bead of white light back. He drew a fan to block an incoming Dharma sword, already preparing his next art.

“Rainbow Phantom Split”

A multicolored light bloomed, splitting into more than a dozen copies of Li Xizhi. The sky filled with rosy light, momentarily stunning the four attackers. They immediately activated their ocular arts, but they couldn't see through the illusion. Their Dharma lights and swords wavered, their targets lost. Even the bead of white light hesitated.

*Bang!*

In that brief moment of confusion, a loud crash echoed in their ears. A dazzling streak of rosy light flashed past and slammed into Guest Elder Zhao, who was still forming his hand seals.

“Pah!”

He had no time to react. He coughed up a mouthful of blood, his protective Dharma artifact unable to shield him in time, and plunged headfirst into the sea.

“What!”

The rosy light solidified into a youth clad in colorful clothes, with feathers adorning his face. He smiled as he dove into the water after Guest Elder Zhao. Chi Zhihu cursed under his breath and whipped out a talisman.

“Protect me!” he yelled. His spiritual qi surged into the talisman. He glanced back and saw his other two retainers still busy trying to dispel the clones. He cursed them again, but several streaks of rosy light were already converging before him. An orange-yellow speck of light pulsed twice, so bright it made his eyes ache.

‘Not good…’

He felt his hand suddenly go light; the talisman had vanished. His eyes watered from the pain. When he could finally see again, he was horrified to find that every one of the dozen Li Xizhi clones was now holding an identical talisman.

The next moment, all the clones dissolved into motes of orange light and disappeared, leaving only the rosy glow that drifted aimlessly through the formation.

The very first art Li Xizhi had ever mastered was Floating Light Gathering. It was not only his specialty but also the signature technique of a light cultivator. After years of refinement with talismanic qi, his mastery of it had reached a divine level.

“You!”

His two remaining retainers quickly moved to shield him. Wu Weibai sighed and sent a message with his spiritual qi.

‘Your Highness, this man’s Floating Light Gathering is terrifying. If you intend to use a talisman, you must inform us beforehand.’

Although Chi Zhihu had warned them to be ready, the fault was not theirs. Knowing the enemy possessed such a technique, he should have retreated behind them before drawing the talisman, not shouted for protection after it was already in his hand.

Wu Weibai’s words were diplomatic, but Chi Zhihu, unaware of his own lack of combat experience, inwardly blamed his men. A knot of frustration tightened in his chest, mingled with a growing fear of Li Xizhi’s profound skill.

‘I never heard he was so talented with his arts! He hid his abilities well!’

# Chapter 682: Ambush (Part 2)

'A fine talisman.'

The talisman in Chi Zhihu’s hand felt extraordinary. It was crafted from a bluish-white paper and inscribed with golden lacquer, but its grade, symbols, and activation incantation were all a mystery. It was useless to him.

Li Xizhi didn’t spare it a second glance. His fingers formed a new seal. He tapped two fingers with his thumb, then shifted his grip to point first toward Mount Luoxia in the west, then to Mount Duan in the east. Three specks of light—emerald, brown, and black-gold—ignited at his fingertips.

His three opponents weren't about to stand by and watch him cast a spell. Chi Zhihu immediately raised his hand, a gleaming white, needle-like Dharma artifact materializing in his palm. Spiritual qi surged into it, but he hesitated, unsure which of the dozen clones to target.

Wu Weibai watched, speechless and utterly exasperated.

'All those years I told you to study the properties of magical arts, but you just slept through the lessons, obsessed only with raw power... Now you’re paying the price!'

Normally, the type of artifact used for detection should have been able to see through Li Xizhi’s illusions. But of all the treasures Chi Zhihu could have brought, he had chosen the Qingmu Mirror, an artifact of Bright Yang profound light.

Many arts could create illusory clones, but when one tried to use an artifact of profound light to see through a technique based on Heavenly Glow, they canceled each other out. The user would see nothing.

'If he had brought the Flowing Light Mirror or the Grand Feather Sword, we wouldn’t be wasting our time on these phantoms!'

While Wu Weibai fumed, Chi Zhihu, though appearing calm, was cursing his luck. The mirror floating above his head shimmered, but he knew its limitations. He wasn't so incompetent as to overlook such a detail, even at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm.

'Ning Hejing borrowed the Flowing Light Mirror, and the Lingu family took the Grand Feather Sword to the Southern Sea to slay demons... The Qingmu Mirror was better than nothing!'

Wu Weibai’s eyes darted about as his hands moved. Being older, he had a wider array of arts at his disposal. While mentally cursing his master, he was already forming a seal. He raised his sword to his lips and chanted:

"Boundless fire, breathe forth the bright apricot... By my command!"

A torrent of apricot-yellow flame erupted from his mouth, swelling into a massive, incandescent sphere in the air. In an instant, it burst like a shattered silver vase, unleashing a countless number of Molten Fire sparks.

The fiery tide washed over the dozen Li Xizhi clones, each of them poised mid-incantation, treading on rosy light. Xia Yun, overjoyed, swiped his own weapon through a nearby clone, dispelling it. "A brilliant technique, Senior!" he shouted.

But then, each Li Xizhi clone formed a seal with one hand and cupped the other. Simultaneously, they all swiped their sleeves, conjuring a wall of iridescent light that met the tide of apricot flame and held it back.

"What?"

The sight made Wu Weibai’s face pale. He had fought Lingu Xia before and had even personally shattered her light clones. Since when could a light clone cast a spell?

Before he could react, Chi Zhihu rashly unleashed the art he had been preparing, striking a random clone. Xia Yun was still maneuvering his artifact, chasing down other phantoms, when Wu Weibai roared, "Defend yourselves!"

Li Xizhi had completed his incantation. Ninety percent of the phantoms in the formation had been dispelled, leaving only his true body and two clones, positioned in a triangle. The rosy light around them pulsed softly.

"Rainbow Pierce!"

The three specks of light—emerald, brown, and black-gold—leapt into the air. They streaked across the sky and descended upon Chi Zhihu, whose face lit up with triumph. "Excellent!" he cried.

A jade stone on the man’s necklace shattered with a crack. A halo of brilliant yellow light erupted from his body, coalescing in mid-air into a three-tailed, feathered beast. It let out a silent roar, and the incoming lights froze, held in place.

Seeing this, all three attackers were ecstatic.

Li Xizhi’s light art had seemed terrifyingly powerful. Wu Weibai was composed enough, having already deployed his own artifact and talismans, but Xia Yun had been scared witless.

He knew that of the three of them, he was the weakest link. By the logic of 'better to sever one finger than injure all ten,' he should have been the first target. The unknown power of the light art had filled him with dread.

But Li Xizhi had chosen Chi Zhihu. As a direct descendant of the Chi family, he was protected by powerful treasures. The rosy light had been instantly neutralized. Chi Zhihu was elated, Wu Weibai was suspicious, but Xia Yun was the most jubilant of all. He raised his Dharma sword and laughed.

"What kind of pathetic trick was that!"

He thrust his sword through a nearby light clone, only to hear Wu Weibai’s horrified cry.

"Look out!"

The old man shot forward, sword raised, but was blocked by a fan that glowed with a faint blue light. From behind the shimmering cover of the three-colored lights, a speck of gold emerged. Li Xizhi himself materialized right in front of Chi Zhihu, hand resting on the hilt of his sword.

"This is bad!"

Though they had witnessed his mastery of magical arts, none of them had forgotten that the Li family was a clan of sword cultivators. Furthermore, throughout the entire exchange, Wu Weibai’s swordsmanship had been a complete joke in front of Li Xizhi, easily parried. It was a clear testament to the young man’s skill with a blade.

The Dharma sword at the Peak Lord of Changtian's waist was no mere ornament.

'He's too close!'

The sight of his opponent appearing before him sent a chill down Chi Zhihu’s spine. His hair stood on end. He frantically reversed his incantation, forcing the fiery spell he had been gathering to dissipate unevenly within his meridians, and slammed his spiritual sense into his necklace.

"Return!"

As Chi Zhihu desperately recalled the three-tailed beast, Wu Weibai saw his master’s peril. Biting the tip of his tongue, he spat out a mouthful of essence blood and roared, "Halt!"

The old cultivator's experience showed. The shout was like a crack of thunder, focused into a single line of force that slammed into Li Xizhi, making him pause for a fraction of a second. It was the opening Chi Zhihu needed. His shock turned to relief, then to joy.

'A perfect chance!'

Wu Weibai had bought him a crucial moment at the cost of injuring himself. The three-tailed beast that had been suppressing the three-colored lights vanished from its spot and reappeared before Chi Zhihu. It lunged with a silent, spectral roar, spewing a mist of golden light that struck Li Xizhi squarely in the face.

'He's been hit by the Gleaming Gold Feather-Beast's pounce! Victory is ours!'

Chi Zhihu knew the power of his own treasure. The jade was an heirloom discovered in a grotto-heaven by an ancestor, and it contained the spirit of the long-extinct Gleaming Gold Feather-Beast. A single breath of its mist was enough to kill an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator. Even someone as skilled as Li Xizhi would not escape unscathed.

'What a stroke of luck...'

He had inadvertently dealt Li Xizhi a massive blow. But before a smile could form on his lips, it was replaced by sheer astonishment.

The Li Xizhi before him dissolved like snow under the morning sun, vanishing without a trace.

"A clone?"

Wu Weibai’s pupils dilated. A single thought consumed his mind.

'The Qingmu Mirror...!'

And indeed, reflected in the old man's eyes was the golden flash of the Gold in Cloud technique. A fair, strong hand materialized from nothing, shimmered into existence, and slapped a swath of rosy light onto the crystalline white mirror Chi Zhihu had left hovering in the air.

"Floating Light Gathering!"

Chi Zhihu's entire focus had been on the three-tailed beast; he was completely unprepared. He felt a sudden emptiness in his chest, then a sharp pang as his spiritual sense took a heavy blow. His connection to the precious mirror weakened.

'His arts... can be used like *that*?!'

With the Qingmu Mirror now in Li Xizhi’s grasp, the clear light that had filled the area vanished. Li Xizhi held the artifact as if it were a struggling sparrow, his grip alternating between light and firm. With his other hand, he unleashed a rosy glow he had already prepared, smashing it onto the mirror's surface.

*Clang...*

The arc of rosy light dissipated into mist. Li Xizhi took a step back and vanished from sight. Before Chi Zhihu could even react, a piteous scream tore through the air.

"Aaaargh!!"

When Chi Zhihu had recalled the Gleaming Gold Feather-Beast, the three-colored lights had been freed. They had immediately changed course and struck Xia Yun.

Xia Yun had only been promoted because of his good relationship with Ning Hejing, and he had opportunistically thrown his lot in with Chi Zhihu. He had some skill, but he never expected Chi Zhihu to retract the feather-beast, leaving him exposed to the attack.

He had amassed a small fortune over the past two years, and several layers of white light flared from protective artifacts on his body. They absorbed some of the impact, and a Foundation Establishment-grade talisman he'd deployed earlier nullified more of the force. But the attack was too sudden; he had no time to prepare further.

Chi Zhihu looked over to see a fist-sized hole blown straight through Xia Yun's head. He could almost see the ocean through the gap. The man stumbled back in a panic, pulling out healing salves and spirit meats to try and patch the wound.

'Zhao is still tangled with that Dawn Rayfish underwater...'

Chi Zhihu could feel the constant ripples of spiritual qi from below. The fight had dragged on, and his will to continue was gone.

'This man's skill with arts is profound... What is Liaokong doing? Why hasn't he acted yet? Does he want to wait until Xia Yun is dead?'

With the Qingmu Mirror stolen, Li Xizhi had once again vanished into the ambient rosy light. Chi Zhihu hastily raised a turtle-shell shield in front of him just as he heard Wu Weibai exclaim with delight, "Huh?"

Chi Zhihu looked up sharply. The figure that had dissolved into golden light had reappeared, stumbling out of the air. A thought dawned on him, and he grinned.

"The Qingmu Mirror is an ancient artifact. It can't be stolen so easily!"

'Gold in Cloud was interrupted...'

Li Xizhi had the mirror in hand. If he could have transformed back into light, his opponents would have been helpless. Unfortunately, the Qingmu Mirror was a high-quality ancient artifact from the Azure Pond Sect. It struggled relentlessly, breaking his movement technique.

As he materialized, Wu Weibai seized the opportunity and charged, his Dharma sword lunging like a venomous, gold-and-silver-ringed serpent. Its patterned blade shimmered, a truly sinister-looking weapon. "Activate the artifact!" the old man yelled.

Taking the cue, Chi Zhihu abandoned the spell he was forming. He closed his eyes and poured all his effort into activating the Qingmu Mirror. The struggling force in Li Xizhi's hand multiplied several times over, forcing him to divert his attention to suppress it.

Li Xizhi’s gaze swept across his opponents, his assessment clear.

'Chi Zhihu has many treasures but little combat experience. Xia Yun is just here to make up the numbers. Only this Wu Weibai is a seasoned fighter... His arts aren't refined, but his cultivation is deep.'

As Wu Weibai closed in, Li Xizhi formed a seal with one hand while his spiritual sense reached out, following the connection to his companion.

"Qiyun!"

*Clang!*

The serpent-like sword was upon him.

The Qingmu Mirror was still stuck to Li Xizhi's hand, so Wu Weibai wasn't worried about him retrieving his own sword. The old man’s eyes were fixed on the composed youth, who calmly held the mirror in one hand while the other rested on his sword hilt.

*Clang!*

An arc of sword energy shot toward the heavens. Wu Weibai's serpent sword was struck, its tail end flying up. Three more agile arcs of moon-white sword energy flew out.

Li Xizhi’s execution of the two stances of the Law of Celestial Moon lacked Li Xijun’s sharp, ethereal grace, but it was undeniably fluid. Wu Weibai didn't understand sword forms; his weapon was more of a spellcasting implement than a proper blade. He scrambled to defend himself.

*Boom!*

The sea below exploded. A column of snow-white water erupted into the sky, and a streak of rosy light shot out of it. The Dawn Rayfish, Li Qiyun, streaked past Li Xizhi, and in that instant, the Qingmu Mirror passed from one's hand to the other.

Freed from the burden, Li Xizhi immediately activated Gold in Cloud, his form once again splitting into dozens of streaks of rosy light that danced and circled within the grand formation.

'He got away...'

The moment Li Qiyun had the mirror, Guest Elder Zhao shot out of the water, his face a mask of fury. He was met by another brilliant blast of rosy light and was hammered back into the sea.

Having lost the Qingmu Mirror, Wu Weibai and Chi Zhihu grew even more cautious amidst the swirling light. Chi Zhihu’s expression was grim. Wu Weibai sighed.

"Your Highness... that spirit beast appears to be a Foundation Establishment Dawn Rayfish. It has little combat power, but it's incredibly difficult to deal with. Zhao Fu is completely tied up; he won't be getting free."

The situation was clear. The three of them were powerless against the master and his companion. If Liaokong didn't intervene soon, they would be lucky to escape with their lives.

"How can his mastery of arts be so profound?!"

Chi Zhihu understood the old guest elder’s implication perfectly, but he couldn’t fathom what madness had seized Liaokong. The monk was still hiding somewhere, refusing to show himself.

As they hesitated, two more streaks of rosy light shot toward them. They both raised their weapons and batted them aside, only to find they were mere illusions.

*Thump!*

A dull thud sounded nearby. Xia Yun’s spiritual presence weakened, and a burst of hazy flame erupted from his body, dispersing some of the rosy light. A deep sense of dread filled Wu Weibai. "Your Highness!" he cried out.

Chi Zhihu was at his wit's end. He possessed powerful artifacts and devastating techniques, yet it felt like punching cotton. He couldn't even find his enemy’s shadow. His anger and fear had reached their peak.

'Do I have to let him go? Was this all for nothing?!'

He stared at the sword energy lashing out from the rosy mist and roared, "Liaokong!"

The sound rolled like thunder, making Li Xizhi wary. The rosy lights pulled back slightly. But after several seconds, there was no response. Chi Zhihu, grinding his teeth, shouted again, "Liaokong!"

Only a dull echo answered him from within the grand formation. Wu Weibai's face changed, his expression turning ugly. "Your Highness, retract the formation and leave at once!" he urged.

Chi Zhihu also sensed something was wrong. Fear crept onto his face as he hastily formed a seal, his spiritual sense connecting to the formation disk in his sleeve.

The brilliant yellow formation in the sky remained perfectly still, an unshakable cage.

Wu Weibai almost coughed up blood. He felt faint. Chi Zhihu tried several more incantations, but the grand formation was as steady as a mountain, not budging an inch. The color drained from his face as well.

A rush of hot blood surged to Wu Weibai's head. He was terrified. The old man trembled, forgetting all decorum. "You couldn't borrow the Flowing Light Mirror and the Grand Feather Sword... could you!" he croaked.

Chi Zhihu looked at him, dazed, as if waking from a dream.

Wu Weibai raised his head in despair. Within the swirling rosy light, the three specks of color—emerald, brown, and black-gold—were gathering once more. Dozens of phantoms flickered with iridescent light, like a pack of starving wolves, poised and ready to devour them.



# Chapter 683: Abandoned Pawns in the Formation

The waves of the Sea of Reefs churned as a great ship materialized in the sky. At its bow stood a young man in black robes, his hands tucked into his sleeves. In the center of the deck was an old man with white hair and sharp, high-arched eyebrows that gave him a ferocious look. He was draped in gold and jade, his body shimmering with the light of powerful artifacts—the very image of a direct descendant of the Chi family.

Six Guest Elders stood in two rows on either side of him. All were clad in resplendent spirit armor, their hands gripping weapons that vied for brilliance—axes, blades, spears, and staves. None of them were below the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm.

'Such a grand display,' Li Yuanqin thought. 'All this for Li Xizhi.'

The old man in the center, Chi Buhua, was advanced in years. Surrounded by the other cultivators, he wore a look of impatience, his eyes constantly scanning the sea below. Finally, his deep voice rumbled, "Why aren't they here yet?"

"Rest assured, Senior," Li Yuanqin said with a casual laugh. "There's more than enough time. The monk Ning Hejing sent is formidable, but Li Xizhi cultivates the Dao of Heavenly Glow. He won't be defeated so easily."

Chi Buhua glanced at the black-robed young man, a hint of satisfaction finally showing on his face. "We misunderstood you before," he nodded. "You have played an invaluable role in this."

Given Chi Buhua's high status, Li Yuanqin simply offered a polite acknowledgment.

Chi Zhihu was reckless, impulsive, and arrogant, often ruining carefully laid plans. While Chi Fubo outwardly respected him as an elder, he secretly held him in contempt. Chi Buhua, however, was Chi Fubo's most capable agent—not only was he cautious and steady, but his cultivation was among the highest in the Chi family, giving him a deep understanding of the situation.

The old man raised an eyebrow and said leisurely, "The Lingu family is tied up with the demon scourge in the Southern Sea, and Si Tongyi was kept on Green Pine Island by Ning Hejing. We have the entire Si family under surveillance. Li Xizhi has well and truly been abandoned."

Chi Fubo was a capable man. Ever since Si Yuanli had entered seclusion, he had kept all the major families under watch. Daring to send Chi Buhua here meant he was ninety percent certain of success, with numerous contingencies in place to keep the Si and Lingu families from interfering.

Even so, Chi Fubo had dispatched six Peak Lords and the profoundly powerful late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, Chi Buhua. The grand formation Chi Zhihu was using also concealed a hidden, devastating power. Even if, by some miracle, Lingu Lanying and Si Tongyi were present, the formation was strong enough to suppress all three of them.

"Zhihu knows nothing of the true plan. By acting as the bait, he earned the Si family's trust. At this point, unless Daoist Master Yuanxiu himself appears, there is no turning back."

Chi Buhua's only fear was that the monk and Chi Zhihu would kill Li Xizhi prematurely, which would be a disgrace. 'The Li family still has many friends among the Purple Mansion cultivators. Killing Li Xizhi would force us to sacrifice many of our own to appease their anger. It's best to capture him alive and force Si Yuanli to back down.'

By now, Chi Buhua was no longer worried that Daoist Master Yuanxiu would actually intervene. 'The Daoist Master must have tacitly approved of this. This is a move against the Li family, a test of some kind. Otherwise, things would never have reached such a passive state for him. Even if he did show up to save Li Xizhi, he would lose immense face. And in the absolute worst-case scenario, if Li Xizhi is saved… we just go home. Is the Daoist Master really going to kill us for it?'

All signs pointed to one conclusion. Ning Hejing's plot was clumsy, and Chi Fubo had only acted because he could turn it to his own advantage. Otherwise, why would he have bothered?

While the old man mulled this over, Li Yuanqin stood by respectfully, his mind a world away.

'Chi Fubo truly wants Chi Zhihu dead.'

Chi Buhua knew only half the story. His esteemed junior was no gentle soul. Chi Fubo had secretly tampered with the formation, making it a one-way trap—easy to enter, impossible to leave. He had also conveniently arranged for the Grand Feather Sword and the Flowing Light Mirror to be sent away.

As for the monk, Liaokong, Chi Fubo was certain he would not act in their best interest.

'Liaokong wants to harm the Li family, which means he needs Li Xizhi to kill Chi Zhihu. Even if Li Xizhi is unwilling, Liaokong will *help* him do it. Only with that crime can he effectively frame Wei Danying and the Li family. Ning Hejing is far too naive.'

With all these factors in play, Chi Fubo was banking on his uncle dying at Li Xizhi's hands.

'If they only fought for a while, no matter how we twisted the story, the worst we could do is have Li Xizhi imprisoned. But if it comes to a matter of life and death, if Chi Zhihu dies at Li Xizhi's hands, then Li Xizhi will have no way to defend himself. That would be enough to demand his life, and that is what will forge him into a sharp blade to pierce the Si family.'

Of all the players in the Chi family, Chi Fubo's thinking was the most ruthless and profound. Though he had never met the monk Liaokong, his grasp of the situation had allowed him to form a tacit alliance of interests.

Li Yuanqin’s thoughts churned, but he remained silent, his arms crossed.

'The Si family was willing to throw the Li family away… What is their true goal?'

His thoughts grew grim. Through the shimmering blue water, he could almost see Si Yuanli's simple, honest face.

'Does the Si family really just want to defeat the Chi family and divide the Azure Pond Sect with the Li and Lingu? I'm afraid not.'

A sudden realization struck him. 'How many Foundation Establishment cultivators does the Si family even have?'

Only two of any note. And how many years did Daoist Master Yuanxiu have left?

'And the Li and Lingu families? How many do they have? Never mind Li Xizhi, the Peak Lord of Changtian Peak. Li Ximing is a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator and a genius alchemist. And Li Zhouwei is the Child of Bright Yang, a talent unseen in a century.'

The young man's expression darkened. 'More importantly, the Li family has been forging connections with Purple Mansion cultivators everywhere. Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong instigated Si Yuanli to move against the Chi family. Does Si Yuanli truly not see their selfish motives? Is Daoist Master Yuanxiu really unaware that he's being used as a weapon?'

'And the Lingu family? Lingu Lanying might not be a genius, but is she weak? They collude with the Xiukui Sword Gate, nurturing bandits in the Southern Sea to make themselves indispensable. They use the grievances of the Jiangnan cultivators to pressure Si Yuanli. Are they not a threat to be feared?'

'Is that the kind of Azure Pond Sect that Si Yuanli wants to rule?'

In Li Yuanqin's mind, the seat of power in the Azure Pond Sect was a throne of thorns. The sharpest belonged to the Li, the most venomous to the Lingu. The Si family had few members, and Daoist Master Yuanxiu was running out of time. If Si Yuanli took that seat, who would usurp him after the Daoist Master’s death? The Li? The Lingu?

His perspective suddenly expanded. Si Yuanli's simple, almost slow-witted face became transparent, and behind it stood the stern, unsmiling figure of the Purple Mansion Daoist Master.

'Chi Fubo, Chi Xunxiao… they are all just scissors, just axes. They wouldn't dare touch the trunk of the Si family, so they are being used to chop away at the poisonous thorns of the Li and Lingu.'

'Once the Li family is weakened and the Lingu family loses its hold on the Southern Sea, the other cultivators will tremble in fear. Then, Si Yuanli, unable to bear it any longer, will emerge from seclusion like a savior, crying out against the Chi family's cruelty to the Peak Lords and their persecution of the great families. He will take their place.'

'Then he can generously restore the two families and console the peaks, and there will be no more threats. By the time the Li and Lingu realize what has happened, even if they harbor suspicions, what could they possibly do?'

His face remained impassive, but his mind was reeling.

'Yes! So that's how it is!'

With that single thought, all of the Si family's bizarre actions suddenly made perfect sense. But his moment of clarity brought no relief, only a bone-deep, bottomless chill.

The thought vanished as quickly as it came. The young man shivered and drew his black robes tighter, an unconscious gesture that made him touch his throat. Chi Buhua was watching him and immediately asked, "What is it?"

'What is it? I'm checking if my head is still attached, of course.'

Li Yuanqin cursed inwardly, half-expecting a talisman to fly out and lop off his head at any moment. Outwardly, he simply smiled and said warmly, "Thank you for your concern, Elder. I just feel a bit of a chill here."

"A chill…" Chi Buhua laughed, the realization dawning on him. "Ah, yes. The Dragon King of the Sea of Reefs cultivates a dao of cold energy. He has turned his undersea domain into a grotto-heaven of ice. It does make the area colder. If you were to fly a little further, you'd even see icebergs."

He turned to the men at his sides with a warm smile. "Look at me, I'd forgotten that Yuanqin is still a Qi Refinement cultivator. We Foundation Establishment cultivators naturally wouldn't feel a thing. My apologies."

Chi Zhihu was in the grand formation, luring Li Xizhi into a trap. They needed to frame Li Xizhi for his murder, and Li Yuanqin's testimony would be essential. Chi Buhua was mindful of this. 'This Li Yuanqin is Li Xizhi's clan uncle, after all. He's an important piece. Although we don't need to fear him recanting his story, it's best to keep him on our side.'

Li Yuanqin deflected with pleasantries. A few moments later, a talisman in Chi Buhua’s hand suddenly lit up, pointing north.

"Found him!"

Overjoyed, Chi Buhua steered the spirit ship in that direction. The sky ahead was empty, but the old man activated an ocular art, his hands forming a seal and pressing against his eyes.

A massive, bright yellow formation became visible, blanketing the sea. "Right ahead!" Chi Buhua declared, his voice filled with delight.

Li Yuanqin watched, his heart sinking. 'This old fossil has lived a long time and accumulated far too much power. Not only does he have a powerful ocular art, but he even knows a special technique to enhance it…'

Such specialized arts were rarely used. That he had mastered one spoke volumes of his profound skill. Though Li Yuanqin's cultivation was low, his insight was not. A single glance was enough to make his stomach tighten. 'It seems Chi Zhihu isn't dead yet. This old man is powerful enough on his own, and he has six other Foundation Establishment cultivators with him. With Liaokong's interference and the power of the formation… things could still go wrong.'

His face remained a placid mask, but anxiety gnawed at him. As the others prepared to leave the ship and enter the formation, Li Yuanqin racked his brain and said in a low voice, "Senior, a moment!"

At such a sensitive time, before Chi Buhua could even speak, a nearby Chi family Guest Elder shot him a sharp, narrowed glare. These men were proud and had only tolerated Li Yuanqin's presence out of respect for Chi Buhua. They weren't about to let him command seven Foundation Establishment cultivators. He opened his mouth to rebuke him, but the old man stopped him.

"What is it, Yuanqin?" Chi Buhua asked, his tone surprisingly patient. Li Yuanqin was useful, and his sharp mind often produced unexpected results. Besides, in his view, delaying their entry was pointless. 'Even if Li Yuanqin has ulterior motives and wants to save his clan nephew, he should have entered the formation sooner. Delaying now will only seal his nephew's fate.'

His tolerance grew. Li Yuanqin adopted a hesitant expression. "Senior, firstly, I am concerned that members of the other two families are still in the area. And secondly… I worry that since Li Xuanfeng visited the Great Ning Palace, Li Xizhi might have a Purple Mansion-grade talisman."

"A Purple Mansion talisman?" Chi Buhua paused. "What of it?"

"I fear he might use the talisman to escape the formation. If we all rush in, he could slip away. With his speed, we would be left helpless." He chose his words carefully. "Capturing him should be effortless for us. Perhaps it would be better to leave one person outside, just in case he uses a Purple Mansion talisman to break through the formation."

Chi Buhua frowned. Such escape talismans were exceedingly rare, capable of traversing the Great Void to pass through formations. The Azure Pond Sect had only a few, all in Daoist Master Yuanxiu's possession, with one held by the Sect Master, Chi Zhiyun, and another that had belonged to the deceased Chi Zhiyan.

'Li Xizhi has such a treasure? He's making a mountain out of a molehill.' The old man grew suspicious and stared at him intently.

Li Yuanqin waited a beat, seeing he had successfully planted the seed of doubt, before adding hesitantly, "Elder… the truth is, this formation can be entered but not exited. I fear if we all go in… we might be walking into a trap!"

A half-hidden truth is always more alluring. As soon as he heard this, the old man froze, his mind reeling. Chi Buhua was old and experienced; it took him only a moment of thought to grasp the implication. "He wants to use Zhihu's life…" he gasped.

He cut himself off, his face hardening. He drew a sharp breath, lifted his chin, and closed his eyes. The weathered bark of his face wrinkled deeply. "Then… we will wait a little longer," he sighed.

He waited. The grand formation fell silent, with only occasional flickers of light, a clear sign that the cultivator inside had dealt with his opponents.

"Alright…" Chi Buhua grit his teeth and exhaled, his face cold as he issued his orders. "You six will stand guard outside. If anything goes wrong once I'm inside, I will crush this jade pendant. Three of you will enter. The remaining three will act based on the pendants of the first three."

"Yes, sir," the six replied in unison.

A flicker of motion crossed Chi Buhua’s old face. He glanced at Li Yuanqin, who stood by respectfully, and a new suspicion entered his grim expression. 'In that case, is it possible this boy is colluding with Li Xizhi, trying to buy him some time?'

'And where is Liaokong? If Zhihu has been dealt with, the monk should be inside, contending with Li Xizhi…'

He stared at the boy, a cruel glint in his eyes. 'This is a perfect chance to test him.'

Chi Buhua suddenly laughed. "As for you, Yuanqin," he shook his head, "why don't you come inside with me? You are Li Xizhi's clan uncle. You can persuade him to surrender without a fight. It will save us all the trouble of coming and going."

Li Yuanqin understood and nodded, clasping his fist. "As you command."

"Good." Chi Buhua roared with laughter, using his spiritual qi to pull the boy to his side. Seeing the youth's calm expression, he felt he had the situation perfectly under control.

'Since Li Xizhi is a member of the Li family, how can he disobey his clan uncle's command? Even if he pretends not to listen, he will have to divert his attention to protect Li Yuanqin. He cannot bear the infamy of killing his own uncle. This gives us another weakness to exploit!'

'And even if he is stone-hearted and they are not colluding, I can simply call in three Guest Elders. One to guard Li Yuanqin, while the other two and I capture Li Xizhi. It will be effortless. And that's not even counting his mortal enemy, Liaokong! Even Li Qinghong would be powerless here, let alone this boy.'



# Chapter 684: Liaokong

Pristine Water dripped within the grand formation, which shimmered with clear light and pulses of rosy mist.

When Chi Buhua entered, the space was empty save for a single golden pagoda standing unshakable amidst the swirling light.

'That must be Liaokong.'

Chi Buhua needed only a single glance to know that Chi Zhihu, Wu Weibai, and the others were all dead. Suppressing a wave of grief, he immediately activated his ocular art, his hands framing his eyes to peer through the haze.

His technique was profound, and it allowed him to make out a shadowy figure within the rosy light. He could also see the monk inside the pagoda, whose booming voice echoed out.

"Senior! This man is treacherous! I cannot hold him! Attack now!"

Chi Buhua formed a seal, his hands glowing with the light of Pristine Water. He looked up just as Li Xizhi's figure shot toward him. The old man had barely blocked the obscuring mist when he saw, in his peripheral vision, a three-colored light screaming toward him, aimed directly at Li Yuanqin.

"You—"

This was entirely unexpected. He faintly heard the young man's voice, refined yet ice-cold. "First, I will eliminate this unfilial whelp for Lord Xuanfeng!"

"Son of a bitch."

Hearing the curse, Chi Buhua hesitated for a fraction of a second, caught between saving the boy and letting him die. He hadn't anticipated the terrifying speed of the three-colored rainbow. In an instant, it was before Li Yuanqin, aimed straight at his face.

*BOOM!*

A flash of white light flared from Li Yuanqin's body, holding for a moment before shattering like an eggshell. The golden pagoda, arriving just in time, finally caught up to the rosy light, suppressing it with a deafening, grating screech.

"That man from the Azure Pond Sect! What plague-ridden mother would bring a Qi Refinement cultivator in here!"

Liaokong clearly had no idea why Chi Buhua had brought Li Yuanqin inside, but seeing Li Xizhi try to kill him immediately told him the boy's identity was not simple. Adhering to the principle of opposing his enemy's every move, Liaokong intercepted the light, planting the pagoda firmly in front of the two men as he descended behind it.

Chi Buhua’s eyelids twitched. Li Yuanqin was covered in a cold sweat, and seeing that the young man’s fear was genuine, the old man finally spoke. "Monk," he said coldly, "help me capture him, and I will let you leave."

The Buddhist cultivators had nearly annihilated the Azure Pond Sect's main lineage at the border mountains. How could Chi Buhua feel anything but hatred? Yet he was an old man, and deep down, he still felt a sliver of grief for what had befallen the main branch. Besides, he had brought an entire retinue; victory was already assured. If Liaokong weren't a sworn enemy of the Li family—and thus a useful source of trouble for them—and if monks weren't so prone to causing unexpected complications, he might have been tempted to kill him as well.

Liaokong instantly detected the hostility in his tone. The portly monk's expression shifted, but he swallowed his anger. "Who in the world is this Qi Refinement cultivator?" he grumbled. "He's getting in the way!"

"He is Li Xizhi's blood relative," Chi Buhua answered.

Liaokong's eyes lit up. "Excellent!" he exclaimed. "A fine move, Senior. I have just the way to deal with him!"

Chi Buhua had no real need for the monk's help, but he feared Li Xizhi might fight to the death. Having a Buddhist cultivator's methods on hand could be useful. "Make it quick," he ordered.

Liaokong immediately channeled his power into the golden pagoda, which erupted in a brilliant glow. He then produced a golden pearl from his sleeve and swallowed it. A surge of spiritual qi flooded his body and he poured it all into the pagoda, which blazed like a golden sun, its light rippling like water.

'He has some skill.'

Chi Buhua felt a wave of heat wash over his face. As Liaokong focused on his technique, the three-colored rainbow slipped out from under the pagoda. The old man drew a green vase from his sleeve, infused it with the spiritual qi of Pristine Water, and tossed it into the air.

The vase flipped upside down, the flood dragon motif upon it glowing brightly. It spat out a beam of green light that drove back the swirling mist, then began to suck in spiritual qi, successfully pinning Li Xizhi's Rainbow Pierce technique in place.

Li Xizhi's second spell was already streaking through the mist. Chi Buhua locked onto it with his spiritual sense, but a flicker of movement caught his eye. The black-robed young man at his side was smiling.

"Hm?"

The old man reacted like a striking viper. The wrinkles on his face bunched together as his head snapped around at an unnatural angle. His aged eyes stabbed into Li Yuanqin. "Yuanqin? What are you doing?"

Concealed beneath his robes, Li Yuanqin's hand held a jade talisman, already glowing with infused power. "Elder," he said in a soft, gentle voice, "you gave me the formation talisman. It can seal the entrance and exit."

"Oh?"

A muscle twitched in Chi Buhua's old face as a realization struck him like lightning. 'Fubo was afraid I would save Zhihu. Afraid I would see his betrayal and fear that one day I, too, would be abandoned. So he gave the talisman to *him*.'

'I was never supposed to know. He had the talisman but didn't use it, instead revealing it to me to keep the other six outside.'

The next moment, the grand formation in the sky locked shut. Eight distinct runes lit up in the corners, sealing it from both within and without.

The old man's face turned grim. 'So what? How long can this formation hold back six cultivators? While I and Liaokong deal with Li Xizhi… how do you expect to survive?'

His mind seethed with suspicion. Without another word, he raised a hand, and a vicious wind swept toward Li Yuanqin. He would kill him with a single palm strike and take back the talisman.

But a golden light flared. The pagoda that had been hovering in the sky suddenly blazed with multicolored light and came crashing down. Caught completely off guard, Chi Buhua’s face finally twisted into a mask of horrified disbelief. "How is this possible?!"

The golden pagoda slammed into his green vase with a sickening crunch, sending it tumbling. The misty green light dissipated, and the suppressed rosy light shot out like a slippery fish, diving back into the mist.

At the same instant, a sword light that had been lying in wait erupted from the fog. A chill ran down Chi Buhua’s neck, and a cold dread washed over his back. It had to be the second three-colored rainbow he had sensed earlier.

'How…'

Of all the people who might betray him, Liaokong was the last one he would have suspected. He would have sooner believed one of the six men outside was a spy for the Si family. He had never once considered the monk.

"The Way of Emptiness had eighteen of its disciples killed by Li Xuanfeng! His sect and the Wei-Li family are mortal enemies for generations to come! He stood to gain so much by harming them… How could he possibly help Li Xizhi?!"

"Are you insane?!"

The roar died in Chi Buhua’s throat. Not only was the pagoda hurtling toward him, but the monk himself was charging forward, fists flying. But the true killing threats were the sword energy and rosy light right in front of him.

A jade stone on his body shattered, and the three-tailed feathered beast materialized once more, spewing a yellow mist that halted the sword energy. He focused all his spiritual qi into two fingers and thrust them at the rosy light behind him.

*Pfft.*

The menacing glow of light vanished with a muffled sound, transforming into a Dawn Rayfish that dove into the sea below. Chi Buhua never imagined such a demonic beast was present. He was unable to retract his technique in time. The two beams of three-colored light were already at his back. Swallowing blood, he had no choice but to retract his attack to defend himself.

"Floating Light Gathering!"

But at that critical moment, the old man's spiritual sense jolted. Li Xizhi, timing it perfectly, had struck the green vase with a spell, severing Chi Buhua’s connection to it.

It was more than just losing an artifact. The mental backlash caused him to stumble for half a step, and the screaming golden pagoda slammed squarely into him.

"Puh…"

Chi Buhua's cultivation was deep. The robes he wore managed to block the pagoda, but the force still made him spit blood. His technique was interrupted, and before he could react, the rosy light struck his arms, shattering them into a spray of Pristine Water.

The situation had reversed in an instant.

Li Xizhi had studied Chi Buhua beforehand. He knew the old man was vastly experienced, a master of powerful arts, and a direct descendant of the Chi family. His protective treasures were unknown, and the grade of his techniques was certainly far higher than his own.

Thus, his two attacks had a single purpose: to destroy the old man's arms and rob him of his ability to cast spells. With that accomplished, Liaokong's pagoda came crashing down, pinning his body.

Li Yuanqin, meanwhile, couldn't care less who lived or died. He had already scrambled away, head in his hands, and was now huddled at the far end of the formation. The aftershocks of a battle between Foundation Establishment cultivators were more than enough to kill him; even the fine spray of Pristine Water that rained down on him was agonizing. He pulled out five or six talismans, but a rainbow-colored light flashed, and he was pulled into the air.

Before him stood Li Xizhi, handsome and elegant, with gentle brows and gray eyes. Rosy light flowed around his feathered robes, giving him an extraordinary air. One of his hands was clamped tightly around the green vase, which struggled fruitlessly to escape his grasp. With his other hand, he controlled the two beams of light. He looked at Li Yuanqin with an affectionate expression and said softly, "Little Uncle."

Li Yuanqin, looking somewhat disheveled, glanced at him and mumbled, "Greetings… Peak Lord of Changtian."

***

On Green Pine Island, Ning Hejing sat silently in his hall. Before him stood a middle-aged man in rattan armor, arms crossed. Two gourds at his waist trembled slightly, as if something were struggling inside.

This man had broken through the grand formation and fought his way up the immortal peak. The Guest Elders had either been too terrified to stop him or were subdued in a few moves. Ning Hejing hadn't even had time to flee before being cornered.

Fei Luoya stood respectfully at the man's side, a jade talisman in his hand glowing faintly—the source of the grand formation's control.

Ning Hejing had long known he was no good; he had promoted the man specifically to leak information to Li Yuanqin. He showed no surprise now. He slowly closed his eyes and sighed. "Senior Lingu…"

The man before him was none other than Lingu Rao, who had accompanied Li Xuanfeng into the Great Ning Palace all those years ago.

"Scorpion Child" Lingu Rao had once been a name spoken in the same breath as Tang Shedu and Li Xuanfeng. Though he kept a low profile and was not widely famous, in the current Azure Pond Sect, he was a figure far beyond the reach of most. He had defeated and injured Ning Hejing in just over a dozen exchanges. The Foundation Establishment spirit scorpions from his gourds had already poisoned him. Now, he was just sitting on his throne, waiting to die.

"The Lingu family… colluded with the Lin clan… who saved your life. No wonder."

Lingu Rao didn't move. Knowing he couldn't escape, Ning Hejing felt black blood trickle from his lips. "With Chi Buhua and the others gone from the sect, Si Yuanli must have made his move inside as well," he said in a low voice. "Sacrificing Li Xizhi… good… very good."

"Good?" Lingu Rao chuckled softly. "From start to finish, Liaokong belonged to Li Yuanqin. Fei Luoya? You deliberately leaked information, thinking he was the messenger? No. It was always Liaokong. Fei Luoya was only here to prevent your escape."

"Impossible!" Ning Hejing scoffed. "He's a Li! What monk from the Seven Ways would side with them? To willingly become prey for his peers to extend their lifespans? A Purple Mansion cultivator must have intervened!"

"No Purple Mansion cultivator intervened in this matter," Lingu Rao said, his voice quiet. The Eastern Yue man's features were plain, but his gaze was sharp as a blade. "As for why… it was because of an inheritance Li Xuanfeng left behind: the Wrathful Dao lineage of the Qinling Temple and a Buddhist treasure."

Ning Hejing let out a ragged breath, no longer caring about such things. The smiling face of Chi Xunxiao appeared in his mind. "What of the Sect Master?" he asked weakly.

Lingu Rao seemed to just then remember the Qi Refinement Sect Master. "That does not concern you," he answered, shaking his head.

The stern, domineering mask on Ning Hejing's face finally crumbled. He lowered his head, his voice taking on a pleading tone he had never used before. "The Sect Master is benevolent, kind, and a friend to all the peaks. He has never harmed anyone. Daoist Master Buzi is still away… I beg you, Elder, for the Daoist Master's sake… spare his life."

"That does not concern you," Lingu Rao repeated.

Ning Hejing froze like a statue, slumping into his seat. He watched impassively as Fei Luoya approached him step by step. Lingu Rao turned and walked out of the hall, gazing at the brilliant rising sun in the distance.

The golden-red light illuminated his face. From the hall behind him came a heart-wrenching roar. "Chi Fubo! Chi Fubo! You fool, to trust tigers and wolves! You fool!"

Ning Hejing's voice was thick with strangled hatred, yet it still carried the tyrannical, domineering viciousness that had defined him. It echoed from the hall, through the open doors, and across the peak, lingering for a long, long time.

Lingu Rao paid it no mind, his gaze fixed on the horizon.

'Si Yuanli…'

Lingu Rao hadn't actually coordinated his attack with the Si family, but by making his move, he had forced Si Yuanli's hand. 'After all, Si Yuanli was waiting for me to act.'

As long as the Si family remained inactive, the Li and Lingu families were in increasing danger. Moongaze Lake was too remote for the Chi family's reach, so they could only target Li Xizhi. The Lingu family, however, was right on their doorstep, their power in the commandery and on the sea being stripped away piece by piece. Their situation was far more dire.

Si Yuanli was content to watch the Chi family weaken his two allies. He was waiting, letting the dull blade slowly cut away at their flesh, until they could endure it no longer.

And so today, with Li Xizhi, Li Yuanqin, and Liaokong having dealt with two major Chi family figures, Lingu Rao saw his chance and struck. Otherwise, who knew how long Si Yuanli would have waited.

'Now, our two families are the ones who struck first, making us deeply complicit. If Suiguan or Daoist Master Buzi hold a grudge in the future, the Si family won't be the sole target.'

'Whether we act or not, Si Yuanli holds all the cards.'

Lingu Rao knew this well. The longer they waited, the more their families would lose. Better to grant Si Yuanli his victory sooner rather than later. 'You have a Purple Mansion cultivator backing you, so you can sit back and watch the show, making us dance to your tune. But in thirty years… we shall see.'

He dismissed the thought and walked out with a faint smile. The morning sun bathed the sky in gold. The middle-aged man's expression brightened, his eyes showing a sense of liberated ease. He chuckled softly.

"As long as the Xiukui stands, my family will be an evergreen tree."



# Chapter 685: Seclusion

On Mount Wu, a white mist of spiritual qi drifted through the air, flowing along the intricate patterns carved into the jade structures. At the highest point, atop a jade pillar where all the energies converged, the celestial light was brilliant.

Li Ximing sat cross-legged upon it, his pale white Daoist robes with their golden trim fluttering gently. His cultivation had reached its peak.

'The Jewel Steps technique was difficult,' he thought, 'but as I delved deeper, I found I could constantly cross-reference it with my memories of the Huai River Map, that ancient Purple Mansion spiritual artifact. It made things much easier.'

After many years of cultivation, aided by several flashes of insight from that long-ago opportunity, his progress had not been slow. Now, as the morning light shone and the pure qi was at its clearest, he had finally mastered the secret art.

'Jewel Steps is a secret art that tempers the will and strengthens the spiritual sense. By using the Radiant Origin Pass as a focal point, I can project its light over the entire mountain. Wherever the light touches, a cultivator’s dharma power will be clarified, protecting them from the peril of inner demons.'

The manifestation of the Jewel Steps technique appeared upon his immortal foundation. He knew that if he were to unleash the Radiant Origin Pass now, illusory, treasure-like steps would materialize by the two corner towers and the central gate. He kept the power contained.

'This is troublesome… I don’t know how much the other sects know about the Radiant Splendor immortal foundation. These Jewel Steps are clearly unique. If any records from the old Wei-Li family still exist, they might be able to tell I’ve cultivated this technique.'

With a quiet sigh, he concluded, 'It’s probably best if I avoid any more fights.'

He exhaled slowly and raised his gaze to a jade water clock on a nearby pillar. In the basin below, fifty-four perfectly round jade beads were piled together.

'I estimated it would take ten years to master, but it only took about half that time.'

That, at least, was a good thing. Li Ximing looked away and retrieved a light purple jade slip. With a turn of his hand, he began to read about the next secret art: the Great Fissure.

This technique was related to ocular arts. The text was far more extensive, and nothing about it felt familiar. As he scanned it, his heart sank.

'This is several times more difficult than Jewel Steps… and that’s not even accounting for the mutual repulsion between the different secret arts. The time it will take is almost impossible to calculate!'

Furthermore, he suspected the Huai River Map had been a Purple Mansion spiritual artifact corresponding to both the Radiant Origin Pass and another technique, which was why it had been so beneficial for his Jewel Steps practice. The Great Fissure was clearly unrelated, so that advantage was gone.

'I'll have to cultivate this one honestly, step by step. It will take at least twenty or thirty years! And if I run into any parts I can't comprehend, who knows how long it will be delayed!'

Having made his assessment, Li Ximing put the jade slip away. He rose from the jade pillar, light gathering around him, and flew out through the formation. The morning sun was bright as he soared toward the center of the island. The cultivators before the main hall all bowed their heads in greeting.

He strode into the hall but did not see Li Zhouwei. Instead, a young man in black robes and silver armor stood in the center of the room. Six slender, elegant, silver-white ancient tokens hung from his waist.

The man was not particularly tall, but the armor made his shoulders seem broad. His features were sharp and clear, his eyes like polished lacquer, exceptionally captivating. A faint purple mark was imprinted on his brow as he stood bathed in the brilliant morning light.

'He looks so familiar!'

Li Ximing paused. Though the young man was only at the initial stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, his bearing was anything but ordinary. The young man looked up, his eyes filled with joy. He had recognized Li Ximing at once.

"Chenghui pays his respects to Uncle!" he said with a bow.

"Chenghui! Good…"

Li Ximing’s eyes were fixed on the six tokens at the man’s waist. He had guessed his identity, and now it was confirmed. Overjoyed, he nodded repeatedly, took two steps forward, and pulled him by the hand to sit down.

"Excellent, excellent," he praised. "With you breaking through to Foundation Establishment, the Radiant Lure generation has a worthy successor! You're only in your early fifties, aren't you? Opportunity is a hard thing to predict. I once thought few among you would be able to reach this realm, but you managed it with the tide of the world, without even needing an Essence Gathering Pill!"

This was the first time Li Chenghui had spoken so informally with this elder. He perched on the edge of his chair and answered respectfully, "Uncle, Brother Huai has also entered seclusion on the island, and First Brother Chengliao should be emerging soon. I was merely reckless and seized an early opportunity."

But Li Ximing shook his head.

Though Li Chenghui was among the most talented of his generation, he had received few resources throughout his cultivation. When the spiritual tides of the Eastern Sea rose, he had gone to the islands to train. But he had been caught up in one turmoil after another, at times even losing contact with the family, let alone using any of their resources.

When it was finally time for his breakthrough, he hadn't even been given one of the family’s Essence Gathering Pills. Although Li Chenghui was of the direct line, his resources had been less than those of An Siwei and the others. It was almost as if he had been exiled. Li Ximing wasn't in charge of the family, but he had heard Li Xuanxuan lament it dozens of times, so he was well aware of the situation.

"You have been wronged all these years!"

"Uncle, you speak too seriously."

The words made Li Chenghui anxious. The light in the young man's eyes dimmed as he said gravely, "My brothers went to war, and eight out of ten perished. I, meanwhile, sat peacefully in the sect's spiritual font, focusing solely on cultivation. How could I dare feel any resentment? To receive the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman right after my breakthrough… I feel it is far too great an honor."

Li Ximing’s heart relaxed. After a few more words with him, he looked into the young man's eyes and found them unusually dark, with a strange, captivating quality. "Have you cultivated an ocular art?" he asked.

Li Chenghui nodded quickly. "Uncle has a discerning eye. I spent decades overseas and came upon a small opportunity, mastering a technique called the Yin-Bright Profound Eyes. I have already sent the manual home."

Li Ximing nodded, satisfied. Li Chenghui then added, a little awkwardly, "This ocular art requires a spirit liquid called Scaled Wood Profound Liquid to master. It’s usually only found in the Admirable Sea. When I found my opportunity, I used that portion myself and had none left for the family…"

Li Ximing gave him a surprised look. "What is there to apologize for? It was your opportunity; of course you should be the one to use it."

Apart from Li Zhouwei, no one in the Chengming or Zhouxing generations had received a Talisman Seed, and their performances had been mostly unremarkable. He hadn't expected Li Chenghui to have changed so much. Highly pleased, he encouraged him, "Lord Tongya was in his thirties before his true talents began to show. Continue to work hard."

He ignored Li Chenghui's modest deflections and asked, "Where is Zhouwei?"

Li Chenghui replied softly, "Uncle, the family has found a spirit jade vein in the Helin Mountains. The patriarch had it surveyed, and the reserves are sufficient to build the White Jade Grand Court required for the 'Courtly Red Dust Qi' technique from the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra*."

"However," he continued, "since jade has become more common, a demon of the True Jade lineage has occupied the mountain and is commanding a host of lesser demons. The patriarch had to go deal with it."

Li Ximing frowned. "Just tell him to be careful not to fall into a trap."

"Don't worry, Uncle!" Li Chenghui replied reassuringly. "It's not far, and with the matter at the Azure Pond Sect settled, the way is quite safe."

Hearing this, Li Ximing’s brow furrowed. "What happened at the Azure Pond Sect? Did Si Yuanli make his move?"

Li Chenghui smiled. "He did. Years ago, Chi Buhua was killed in the Sea of Reefs by Third Uncle, who is now Peak Master Changtian, 'Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow.' His Excellency escaped with ease on a Dawn Rayfish, and the six pursuers couldn't even catch his shadow."

"Then, 'Scorpion Child' Lingu Rao attacked Green Pine Island. Fei Luoya opened the grand formation, and Ning Hejing was killed. 'Azure Flash Sword' Si Yuanli then appeared in the main hall, captured Chi Fubo and his faction who had controlled the sect and mistreated the other families, and rescued the Sect Master…"

He paused, then explained, "The Sect Master is now in seclusion for his breakthrough. Si Yuanli is managing the sect in his stead."

"Oh…"

The amount of information was staggering. It took Li Ximing more than a dozen breaths to process it all. "Then what about Uncle?" he finally asked.

Li Chenghui understood who he meant. "His Excellency endured great humiliation, feigning compliance with the Ning family and Chi Fubo. He was handsomely rewarded by Si Yuanli and is now also in seclusion to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Good!"

Li Ximing finally felt a sense of relief. After a few moments, he smiled. "Brother Zhi has become truly formidable!"

"Indeed!" Li Chenghui said in a low voice. "I hear His Excellency's magical arts are incredibly profound, even surpassing those of Lingu Xia back in her day. He's called the number one spellcaster in the Azure Pond Sect and is now in charge of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, making him one of the most powerful figures there!"

"Furthermore, I've heard that he always carries a longsword but has never drawn it, fighting only with his arts. A rumor says his swordsmanship far surpasses his spellcasting. If someone could force him to draw his sword, they would witness the true grace of a family of sword immortals as his blade split the sky."

As Li Chenghui spoke, a look of shared pride and joy lit up his face, his eyes shining with a smile.

"Is that so!"

Li Ximing was half-incredulous. He thought to himself, 'I always used to hear him say that Xijun's sword Dao was superior. I never imagined that his swordsmanship and his magical arts would advance in tandem to such a degree! He has already far surpassed me!'

He chose to believe it for the moment and smiled. "Good! With Third Brother's great prestige, he will be able to support the family should anything happen in the future."

Li Chenghui agreed. Just then, a set of footsteps approached the hall. Li Xuanxuan entered hurriedly from outside. The old man was dressed in a light blue robe, his white beard flowing. An old talisman brush, which he had used for nearly a century, hung at his waist, his gaze full of concern.

"Ming'er."

"Grandfather!"

Li Ximing stood to greet him. He saw two more people behind him, a boy and a girl, both just over ten years old. The boy had a slightly pointed chin and a warm smile. The girl was very polite, bowing her head and offering greetings.

Though Li Ximing was often in seclusion, he recognized Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan. He smiled at them, then asked his grandfather in a low voice, "Is there any change in Aunt's fate jade?"

"None."

Li Xuanxuan checked it day after day; he might as well have been living in the ancestral hall. "She has been gone for years," he said, his voice hoarse. "Though the jade's luster has waxed and waned, there are no signs of cracking. It is currently warm and bright. It seems she is in no danger."

"Good…"

In truth, both grandson and grandfather knew that with her by the Dragon Monarch's side, the fate jade was most likely useless. But it offered a sliver of comfort, something to hold on to.

Li Ximing sat quietly, listening as they recounted the events of the past few years. The sun eventually set, and the celestial light in the hall grew dim. Magical lamps flickered to life, illuminating the space with a bright glow.

When they had finished, Li Ximing let out a soft laugh. He took the old man's hand and said gently, "Grandfather, my cultivation has reached a bottleneck, and the family is prosperous and thriving. I will enter seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

Li Xuanxuan froze. He looked at the young man in Daoist robes before him. The old man lowered his eyes, and for a moment, he was speechless. He finally said in a low voice, "You all may leave."

Li Chenghui's expression turned solemn as he led the two children away.

Li Xuanxuan had lost his father at birth and had buried two elders. After Li Xuanfeng's death, he had watched his peers pass away one by one. And as the Yuanqing generation faded, Li Ximing was the only one of the Xiyue generation left in the family.

He was at a loss for words. A heavy silence fell over the hall.

"When I was young, I was foolish and caused Grandfather, Father, and my uncles much worry," Li Ximing began softly. "When my father was on his deathbed, I did not see him even once. That was the height of unfilial piety… For all these sins, the fault lies with my own cowardice."

"In terms of selfless devotion, I am not as good as First Brother. In courage and bearing, I am not as good as Third Brother. In intelligence and wit, I am not as good as Jun'er. Even in facing danger with calm and self-respect, I am not as good as Yuexiang."

His expression held no hesitation, no self-pity, only a quiet statement of fact. "If any one of them had been in my position, there would not have been so much sorrow. It would have been best to let me be an alchemist, rising with the sun to absorb qi and sleeping in the mountains at dusk."

"But I was the one who took that breath all those years ago."

"Why must you say such things!" Li Xuanxuan whispered.

Li Ximing gave a faint smile. "Grandfather, do you remember when I went to the Xiao family and was led astray by wine and women, causing Father great disappointment?"

Li Xuanxuan could only nod silently. His grandson’s raw confession had thrown him into disarray. He couldn't help but suspect that this attempt at a breakthrough was a form of suicide, but the words were caught in his throat.

Li Ximing, however, sipped his tea as if recounting some amusing anecdote after a meal. "That woman was actually a proper lady," he said quietly. "Every time I went to see her, my heart would burn with passion. But every time I went to loosen my belt, I would freeze. A coldness would rise from the soles of my feet, and I would be seized by a fear I couldn't control. I would arrive full of excitement and leave in utter defeat."

"But I kept going back to her, and every time, I was paralyzed by fear. In the end, I stopped even trying to undo my belt. I would just touch her for a bit and then leave. She grew impatient and plied me with spirit wine. When I awoke, I found the situation irreparable."

"That was why, when Jun'er asked me what happened, I said I didn't know."

"Later, after I broke through to Foundation Establishment, my old memories became clear. The events of that day replayed in my mind. In my terror, even while drunk, I had clutched my belt so tightly that I refused to let go. She tried, but she couldn't pry my hands away."

"The spirit cloth was tough. She couldn't cut it with scissors, so she had to stage the scene by taking off her own clothes. Whether it was her own idea or someone else's direction… since nothing happened, no one cared to investigate."

Now a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator, he spoke of this without a trace of fear. "Grandfather," he said softly, "I never got the chance to explain it to him."

Li Xuanxuan was stunned into silence. He stared blankly at his grandson. "Why didn't you tell me…" he finally managed.

"It wouldn't have mattered anymore." Li Ximing turned his head to the side. "I am a man of ambition but no courage. I have been a coward for most of my life. But not anymore. Ximing has nothing left to lose. Our family has never had anyone perish while attempting to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. Today, let it begin with me."

The young man rose from his seat. Li Xuanxuan, his expression a storm of emotions, was led by him to the front of the hall, still unable to process what he had heard. The old man's voice trembled as he spoke.

"Ximing… Ping'er… he never blamed you."

Li Ximing paused at the words but did not reply. He reached the entrance of the hall and performed a grand, formal rite to his grandfather. After three full bows and nine kowtows, he said with utmost respect, "Grandfather, please take good care of your health."

He straightened up and transformed into a ray of brilliant light, not daring to look at the old man again as he flew toward Mount Wu.

Li Xuanxuan was left collapsed on the steps, his white beard trembling. He took several deep, shuddering breaths before he could calm himself.



# Chapter 686: Divine Power

"Divine power is the fruit of a vast Dao foundation. It is born from the immortal foundation, channeled from the Qihai, through the Shengyang acupoint, and past the infinite illusions of the Twelve-Storied Pagoda. When the Juque, Qihai, and Shengyang are all illuminated, the Shengyang 'mansion' ascends into the Great Void, severing the mortal coil and dispelling the world of forms."

Li Ximing sat cross-legged on the jade pillar, having centered his mind for six days. Several jade slips were arrayed before him. The Li family's collection of Daoist arts was not extensive, but most had been granted by the Immortal Mirror and were exceptionally profound, offering much to study and reference.

'The *Radiant Essence Scripture* describes the Purple Mansion as: "Fire rising in the heart, Yang and Ming manifesting inside and out."'

'The *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun* says: "Concealing the heart-fire, the sun sets in the southern brightness, ruling the world from a southern throne."'

'The *Golden Book of Houshu* is more succinct, using only four words: "The ultimate transformation of things."'

These were all texts from the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. As Li Ximing prepared to make his own attempt at the Purple Mansion Realm, he had paid close attention to such information, even seeking out Kongheng to ask about it when he was still around.

Kongheng had described it from a Buddhist perspective: "When one's wishes are fulfilled, they achieve infinite light, instantly realize Maha, obtain divine power, and enter the realm of liberation. Wherever their transformations take them, they go with ease, and wherever they reside, they are constantly guarded."

Though each school had its own interpretation, the method for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm was largely the same: forge the immortal foundation, propel it to the Shengyang acupoint, ascend the Twelve-Storied Pagoda, and pass through the boundless illusions.

It sounded simple, but the very first step—propelling the immortal foundation toward Shengyang—was enough to halt ninety percent of all cultivators.

Each Purple Mansion cultivation art had its own method, but once the immortal foundation left the Qihai acupoint and began its ascent, a cultivator’s entire power would surge. There was no turning back. Failure to break through meant instant death, with no chance of survival.

On its way up, the foundation had to first illuminate the Juque acupoint before entering Shengyang. If a cultivator's dharma power was insufficient, their immortal foundation of too low a grade, or their mastery of the Dao lacking, their energy would be consumed too quickly. They would burn out before even reaching Shengyang, and their life would be extinguished.

Years ago, Li Encheng and the others had rashly attempted their breakthrough after only a few years of seclusion. They had failed, their deaths marked only by a celestial phenomenon, having fallen at the very first hurdle.

'Those who perish at that stage have their cultivation scattered long before. The resulting celestial phenomenon, though vast, is as fleeting as smoke and leaves no precious spiritual treasures behind.'

If a cultivator successfully reached the Shengyang acupoint, they then had to manifest their divine power. The higher the grade of their immortal foundation, the more secret arts they had mastered, and the deeper their understanding of their own Dao, the easier this process would be. It was not a long stage, typically taking about six years.

This was the point where rogue cultivators and members of smaller clans were most likely to fail. Lacking the high-grade foundations, secret arts, and profound comprehension of their peers, they often met a swift end.

Finally, if one could manifest their divine power within Shengyang, they had to use that power to push the Shengyang 'mansion' into the Great Void. In the Immortal Dao, this was known as "severing the mortal coil and dispelling the world of forms." For Buddhist cultivators, it was "pushing Shengyang into the Pure Land to achieve the state of non-regression."

To enter the Great Void, one first had to pass through a state of primordial oblivion, a complete loss of self. One could be trapped there, adrift and unaware, for days or decades. Because the mortal coil was already severed, they would feel nothing, remaining stagnant until their lifespan ran out. The vast differences in time taken to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm stemmed from this stage.

Ning Wan and Yang Tianya were likely trapped at this point. While Ning Wan's situation was uncertain, rumors suggested Yang Tianya was nearing the end of his lifespan in this state, with no hope of escape.

By this point, a cultivator had achieved half the characteristics of the Purple Mansion Realm. If they were to perish now, the celestial phenomenon could blanket an entire region with a shower of spiritual treasures or trigger a natural disaster spanning several prefectures.

When the Yuan family's ancestor, Yuan Licheng, had failed his breakthrough, his death was widely lamented. The ensuing rain had covered several prefectures. Even with the Azure Pond Sect's intervention to prolong the phenomenon, the power of the event itself was undeniable.

Only after breaking through this state of oblivion could one face the infinite illusions. With their divine power in hand, the illusions would pass in an instant. Failure meant the complete dispersal of one's cultivation. Success meant they had truly arrived, and could emerge from seclusion as a Purple Mansion cultivator.

'That's how it is now. In ancient times, a cultivator also had to face the Three Calamities. After surviving those, members of the Thunder Palace would be waiting. One to drive the thunder, another to summon the clouds, they would call down Profound Thunder to punish past misdeeds. Even if you lived an honest life, you were bound to have hurt someone, and you would be made to suffer for it.'

He was fortunate that such tribulations were no longer a part of the process. Given his limited combat prowess, Li Ximing wasn't sure he would have survived.

Having sorted through the crucial steps, he put away the jade slips and retrieved a cinnabar brush from his storage pouch. Infusing it with his dharma power as ink, he watched as it began to glow.

'With the Radiant Violet Pill my master gave me, I shouldn't fail at the first stage,' he thought. 'If I do die, there should be a wealth of spiritual items.'

After a long moment of contemplation, he estimated what the aftermath of his death might look like. He casually set up a formation around the jade pillar, then stood beside it and began to write with a flourish.

"The walls of Great Desert City are crumbling, and gathering spiritual qi is difficult. Should I perish, a convergence of celestial light and swirling sands will fill this place with Radiant Origin. I have bound it with this formation for the benefit of future generations."

"Li family disciple, Ximing."

He put the brush away and flew to the top of the pillar. With two fingers, he lightly drew a circle on its surface.

Though the jade was of high quality, it wasn't particularly durable. The simple motion carved a shallow groove into the stone. Li Ximing blew away the dust and retrieved a small, golden-red ring from his sleeve.

The ring was about the thickness of his little finger, made of a material that was neither gold nor silver, and it glowed with a faint red light. He carefully placed it into the groove he had just carved.

It was the Sun-Gazing Ring.

He didn't know its material or grade, but it was an ancient artifact of Bright Yang, and he had taken it out specifically for his seclusion. Perhaps it would bring him good luck.

He let out a self-deprecating laugh and took out a black jade box. Placing it on the pillar, he opened it to reveal a white stone the size of a fingernail, glowing with a bright, ethereal light that seemed to shift like smoke and mist.

'The Radiant Sky Stone!'

This spiritual item was used for condensing one's divine power. He dared not look at it for too long. He then took out the Radiant Violet Pill, which bore five golden patterns, and placed it next to the box.

He swallowed a calming pill and settled onto a cushion at the base of the pillar. He let the surrounding light and shadow shift around him as he regulated his breath for three months. When he finally opened his eyes again, they were filled with nothing but tranquility.

*Hum.*

A pristine white jade bottle on the pillar's top leaped up and tilted, releasing a perfectly round pill.

Li Ximing enveloped the pill in his dharma power to prevent its medicinal properties from dissipating. But the Radiant Violet Pill was refined from multiple precious herbs. The moment it appeared, it shone with a dazzling brilliance, like a miniature sun rising, bathing the entirety of Mount Wu in light.

He swallowed the pill and felt a searing current rush into his Qihai.

His Qihai was already a roiling sea of bright dharma power, a world of gold and white. Amidst the surging white qi stood the Radiant Origin Pass, a majestic gate of white brick with exquisitely carved battlements. The seventy-two ridges on its corner towers shone brightly, like a gateway to the heavens, its base covered in dazzling patterns of light.

As the sun-like Purple Brightness Pill descended into his Qihai, a rain of Bright Yang power fell, instantly flooding the entire space and submerging everything in golden light.

*BOOM!*

Fortunately, the Radiant Origin Pass, an immortal foundation designed for suppression, reacted at once. As if provoked, the great gate leaped up from the sea of qi and pressed down on the miniature sun, containing its power and keeping the pill intact.

'Good.'

This saved him the effort of having to suppress it himself. With his Qihai now like a flash flood, Bright Yang power surged into his limbs and meridians. Ignoring the painful swelling in his body, he exhaled a torrent of celestial light and formed a seal with his hands.

"Ascend, immortal foundation!"

He activated the arts and incantations from his Purple Mansion cultivation method. The Radiant Origin Pass trembled in his Qihai, the Jewel Steps technique upon it shining ever brighter. Filled with a sense of great creation and joy, the immortal foundation transformed into a streak of golden light and shot upward, leaving the Qihai behind.

For an ordinary cultivator, the immortal foundation leaving the Qihai was a sign of impending death. Even with the cultivation art's incantations to stabilize it, his Qihai felt like it was deflating, its dharma power pouring out through the opening to propel the Radiant Origin Pass, rapidly thinning.

But as the Radiant Origin Pass moved, the suppressed Purple Brightness Pill flared back to life. A fresh rain of bright light fell, and his Qihai was once again brimming with vitality.

'Thank heavens for this precious pill!'

The Purple Brightness Pill was refined from two Bright Yang treasures and nearly a hundred other spiritual herbs of the same affinity. It was this immense power that kept his Qihai full. Without it, Li Ximing would already be drenched in sweat, burning his own life essence to push his immortal foundation upward.

With the pill's help, all he had to do was guide the foundation steadily on its course.

He calmed his mind, focusing his entire consciousness on the immortal foundation, oblivious to the changing light and darkness of the outside world. He didn't know how much time had passed when he finally saw a light before him, his immortal foundation having entered a vast, hazy space.

'The Juque Palace!'

The three keys to the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao were, from top to bottom, Shengyang, Juque, and Qihai. After the six spiritual wheels merged, the Juque became indistinct. From Qi Refinement to Foundation Establishment, the only one a cultivator could perceive was the Qihai.

*BOOM!*

The Bright Yang power from the Purple Brightness Pill found a new outlet, pouring into this vast space. The dharma power in his Qihai was rapidly drained, nearly half of it converging in the Juque Palace.

As the Radiant Origin Pass flew in, the haze before Li Ximing was illuminated by celestial light, revealing a landscape of pure white. The ground of the Juque Palace was covered in something like a blanket of snow, at the center of which stood a high platform.

And floating above that platform was a bright, perfectly round object.

'The Talisman Seed?!'

He had never imagined he would find it in his Juque Palace. He instinctively looked down at his Qihai.

The Purple Brightness Pill there had been mostly consumed, leaving only a thin layer of dharma power. At the bottom of his Qihai, the round, brilliant Talisman Seed lay quietly.

'There's one in the Qihai too? Are they the same?'

This was not the time for deep investigation. Without a moment to spare, he rested briefly before commanding the Radiant Origin Pass to leave the Juque Palace and continue its ascent.

Now, without the aid of the Purple Brightness Pill, he was raising the immortal foundation on his own. It felt like carrying a heavy bronze cauldron. Cold sweat immediately beaded on his brow, and a chill ran down his spine.

Even so, he was far better off than most. His starting point had been the Juque, not the Qihai. A cultivator like Chi Zhiyun would likely have another one or two pills similar to the Radiant Violet Pill to consume, pushing them all the way to Shengyang in one go.

It wasn't that he didn't have other pills, but if he lost focus for even a moment, the immortal foundation would begin to fall. The energy from an ordinary pill wouldn't even compensate for the loss from that momentary lapse. He estimated he would need something at the level of a treasure herb.

'My family doesn't lack treasure herbs… but no one has ever broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm before. No one knows the details of what's required.'

Beads of cold sweat dripped from his face. This part of the journey was far more grueling than the first. The path was treacherous, the Twelve-Storied Pagoda like twelve steps that he had to climb while carrying the immense weight. The pressure was so intense that blood began to seep from his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.

After what felt like an eternity, his vision went black. Then, finally, a faint light appeared ahead, revealing a small mansion floating on a sea.

The water was a clear, green, dotted with lotus blossoms. Twelve white bridges spanned the shores, and a white light shone in the sky. Looking closer, he saw that the sun illuminating this realm was the Talisman Seed.

'So there's one in the Shengyang Mansion too! That makes sense… the three mansions are a vital secret of cultivation. How could one be favored over the others?'

Before he could take a closer look, the Radiant Origin Pass plunged into the mansion, causing the sea to churn violently and overturn several lotus flowers. A wave of dizziness washed over him, and he couldn't stop himself from spitting out a mouthful of blood.

"Pah!"

He quickly swallowed the rest of the blood. He knew he was badly injured, but his heart was filled with elation.

'I finally made it!'

Thanks to the Radiant Violet Pill, he had only suffered a heavy injury, far from the point of utter exhaustion. He focused his mind, gathered his remaining dharma power, and formed a new seal with his hands, setting the Radiant Origin Pass within the Shengyang Mansion.

The light from his foundation warmed his mind, and his spiritual sense felt wonderfully comfortable. His body, however, was in stark contrast—as weak as a mortal's, as if it might collapse at any second.

He dared not delay. While the Radiant Origin Pass was stable and required little effort to maintain, he forced his eyelids open.

His vision was dim, and he could see nothing clearly. He used his spiritual sense to guide his hand, using his last bit of power to open the jade box. The thumb-sized white stone flew out and gently attached itself to the center of his brow.

The Radiant Sky Stone immediately came to life. It squirmed like an insect, its surface covered in tiny, fine scales. It burrowed into his forehead, breaking the skin and entering his Shengyang Mansion.

The Radiant Origin Pass was still suspended in mid-air when the Radiant Sky Stone flew in. The Pass immediately descended, its seventy-two corner ridges glowing brightly, bathing the space in dazzling light.

"...Sensing the seventy-two profound attributes of Bright Yang, today I seek the inner from the outer, seek life from nature. May the thousand divine officials all come to my aid. May the divine light shine within, bringing clarity and spiritual grace. May the five decays and five calamities be melted away by this..."

He chanted the incantation, and the Radiant Origin Pass in the sky began to tremble violently.

"May old age, sickness, and death no longer touch me. May my nature and life be eternal, and may my vow be everlasting!"

The Radiant Origin Pass shook more and more fiercely. A vast torrent of white qi flowed down like water. Two golden, hollowed-out lanterns on its corner towers lit up, and a radiant staircase appeared, each step igniting in sequence.

The Radiant Sky Stone evaporated like white steam, its essence pouring into the immortal foundation. Li Ximing's mind was filled with an endless, brilliant light as he cycled through one set of incantations and hand seals after another.

After an unknown amount of time, he vaguely saw a white qilin leaping through the world and heard the cry of a white cicada. The celestial gate shattered, its white bricks crumbling like broken tiles. From its center, a rainbow-colored light emerged, flowing and dancing in the air.

A wave of exhaustion washed over Li Ximing's mind. The primordial oblivion enveloped his consciousness, a hazy state between waking and sleeping. His vision turned to gray.

Everything in the Shengyang Mansion froze. The sea no longer rippled, the lotuses stopped blooming, and the rainbow light solidified in place. All movement ceased.

But the sun in the sky paused for a moment, then cast down a beam of light as cool and clear as water.



# Chapter 687: The Sky Brightens

The cool light flowed down, illuminating the dust-covered Shengyang Mansion once more. The primordial oblivion, like snow in the blazing sun, vanished completely. The sea began to ripple again, and the lotus flowers bloomed anew.

Li Ximing felt a crisp, refreshing sensation circulate through the Shengyang Mansion. It was like drinking melted snow, and the haze in his mind cleared completely.

'The Talisman Seed dispelled the oblivion!'

A surge of joy rose in his heart. His spiritual sense extended beyond the Shengyang Mansion, peering into an endless, empty darkness. Below, celestial light shone brilliantly. A cool energy settled under his tongue, and a sweet liquid trickled down his throat. The trial of oblivion was over.

By now, his spiritual sense had detached from his body along with the Shengyang Mansion. The "mouth" he perceived was, in fact, the mansion itself; his spiritual sense, lacking a familiar frame of reference, was simply interpreting it through his inherent senses.

The coolness in his "mouth" was his nascent divine power. Seeing that the Talisman Seed had carried him all the way to the final trial, Li Ximing's joy subsided. He dared not be careless and kept his "mouth" firmly shut.

'There are still the infinite illusions!'

Just then, something materialized from the void before him. Banners fluttered, and a golden host marched out of the darkness. The air filled with the clamor of whinnying horses and sharp commands as an army manifested.

The soldiers were all clad in golden armor, each with a distinct face, holding spears and halberds. They were shockingly lifelike. The man at their head wore a phoenix-wing helmet and a mask that concealed his features. He rode a tall steed, holding the reins as he trod upon the air. With a golden spear in hand, he advanced and pressed its tip to Li Ximing's throat.

"Halt!"

In an instant, he was surrounded by the golden-armored soldiers. They drew their swords and nocked their bows, their weapons all trained on him. Li Ximing glanced down at himself. He was dressed in simple robes, his hands empty, nothing more than a mortal man.

"Who are you!"

The scenery in the distance grew clearer, revealing that he was in a mountain valley. The general pressed the spear against his throat and barked, "Why are you here?"

Li Ximing knew his divine power was held within his mouth and refused to speak. The general's expression shifted from suspicion to anger, and the guards on either side began to press him, their thousand voices roaring like thunder.

Such a display was hardly enough to frighten Li Ximing. He remained silent. Enraged, the general wheeled his horse around and departed, his guards vanishing with him like the wind.

Li Ximing had just begun to relax when a black-striped tiger leaped from an unseen corner and sank its teeth into his calf. There was a sickening crunch as its fangs tore through flesh and muscle, exposing white bone and sinew. Blood sprayed everywhere.

The pain was excruciating. He raised a hand to drive it away, but a massive snake with a purple head shot out from behind him. Its pupils were pale yellow, its scales slick and smooth. It ripped open his chest with a single bite and made off with a piece of his flesh.

He reached to cover the wound, only to touch his own bare ribs. A viper with a triangular, flat head lunged, burrowing into his stomach and yanking out his intestines, spilling the warm, steaming coil all over the ground.

All manner of venomous creatures and wild beasts swarmed from the shadows, fighting over his body. Through a haze of agony, Li Ximing kept his mouth shut. He gradually lost track of where he was, knowing only that he could not open his mouth, for his divine power was held within.

Soon, the beasts scattered. A torrential rain began to fall, accompanied by lightning and thunder. The general returned with his men, this time dragging a great bronze cauldron, heated until it glowed red and filled with boiling oil.

"Who are you?" he demanded.

Li Ximing still refused to answer. Then, he saw a group of people being dragged forward from the distance. At their head was a white-haired, stooped figure—his grandfather, Li Xuanxuan.

Two armored soldiers brought out a board, black and stained with blood. They struck the old man fifty times, then turned to ask Li Ximing again. When he didn't answer, they each took out a blood-flecked rasp and began to file down his grandfather's fingers.

The old man's shrieks shook the heavens, but Li Ximing remained silent. When all five fingers had been ground down, the general lifted his grandfather and held him over the cauldron of oil.

"Tell me your name, and he will be spared," the general said coldly.

The old man's blood dripped into the cauldron, and sizzling bubbles burst, scalding his skin. His grandfather pleaded in a hoarse voice, but Li Ximing did not respond. He closed his eyes, refusing to watch. The general finally let go and ordered his men, "This sorcerer's art is nearly complete. We cannot let him live."

Two soldiers stepped forward. One thrust a spear into his chest with a dull, wet thud. The other swung a saber. A cold sensation touched his neck, and his vision exploded into a shower of stars. Li Ximing nearly lost his resolve.

He drifted in a daze for a moment before his vision cleared to a gloomy scene. Heavy iron chains were wrapped around his arms and neck, shackling him at the waist. They were so heavy he couldn't lift his head. Two icy gazes fell upon his face.

Two figures stood beside him. One held a warrant covered in tiny, ant-like script. He could vaguely make out titles like "Ninth Netherworld Ghost Emissary" and "Tenth Generation Merciful King." Since Li Ximing wouldn't speak, the two soul-takers didn't question him, simply leading him on the path to the Netherworld.

Li Ximing saw a landscape of collapsed city walls and iron plaques scattered everywhere. Two small ghosts were using long ladles to pour molten bronze, glowing a fiery red. Without a word, they threw him into a pit and used their ladles to push him under the surface, expertly dousing him with the liquid metal.

The molten bronze seared through his chest and stomach, the pain so intense it almost wiped out his consciousness. A mortal would have screamed instinctively, a reaction beyond conscious control. But as a spiritual body, he was just barely able to maintain his silence.

After one round of pouring, the ghosts fished him out. One of them spoke. "It's rare to see a ghost so good for torturing. There probably aren't many ghosts left in the mortal realm."

"Isn't that the truth," the other replied. "The Lord Magistrate is in seclusion, and the posts of 'High Shaman' and 'Xiukui' have been vacant for ages. When people die, they just die. What ghosts are there to speak of?"

The two of them flipped him over and subjected him to a litany of tortures: being pounded with iron rods, boiled in pits, and forced through mountains of blades and forests of swords. Partway through, a soul-taker brought over a white-haired old man. One of the ghosts called out, "Sir, which fellow Daoist have you brought?"

The soul-taker stood beside the old man and answered, "This is fellow Daoist Chi Wei."

Li Ximing almost cried out. He looked up and saw the old man standing next to the soul-taker, dressed in the robes of the Azure Pond Sect, looking down on him with a superior air.

The little ghost glanced at him and sneered, "Do you have a grievance? The Great King is watching from above. He is the Tenth Generation Merciful King. If you just open your mouth, we'll cast this man down for you."

Li Ximing struggled but lowered his head in silence, not even letting out a groan. His mind was mired in a stupor. The little ghost gnashed its teeth and began to file at him with a blade, its actions growing ever more vicious. After he had endured it all, a voice from above declared, "This one is insidious and cunning. Send him to the Blue Sea to be reborn as a woman."

Li Ximing was led away, his mind numb, to be reincarnated. Finally, his vision brightened. By now, he had forgotten he was holding his divine power in his mouth; all that remained was the single, overriding thought that he must not speak.

He looked around. He had been born into a wealthy family, but was plagued by a hundred illnesses. He refused to eat or take medicine, yet somehow, his life was never in danger. But without medicine, the illnesses wracked him with constant, unbearable pain. He gritted his teeth and made no sound. His family simply treated him as a mute girl, one who was exceptionally beautiful.

They noticed she never ate. In the early days, they tried to force her mouth open, but her lips were sealed as if cast from iron, impossible to pry apart. Yet despite never eating, she grew day by day. Her parents began to fear her in secret.

Bedridden and unable to speak, her beauty was a curse. Visiting relatives, unaware of the truth, would often tease her with words and secretly take liberties. She grew to the age of sixteen in unspeakable misery.

Finally, a man from her village with the surname Lu came to ask for her hand. Her family hastily married her off. Fortunately, Mister Lu cherished her. They lived lovingly for several years, and her health gradually improved. They had a son and a daughter. But no matter how much her husband begged, she would never speak.

One day, while she was weaving at home, Mister Lu burst through the door, his face flushed and reeking of alcohol. He snatched their young son from his cradle and stared at her with cold eyes.

"You haven't eaten in three years! What kind of demon are you?" he roared. "This child may wear human skin, but who knows if he is human? An immortal master on the road told me that you sleep with me only to devour my official fortune!"

He was a large man, and in his rage, he grabbed the child by the feet and lifted him high above his head. Li Ximing was too slow to stop him.

"Speak!" Lu bellowed.

When she still didn't open her mouth, he threw the child with all his might. The boy's body hit a stone and shattered on impact, his brains splattering everywhere.

Li Ximing felt a rush of blood surge into his head. The coolness in his mouth churned, and a weak sound escaped his throat. As if struck by lightning, he managed a choked gasp. "Puh..."

His face went deathly pale. He finally spat out a mouthful of blood, along with half of his tongue. It mixed with the blood on the ground, everything blending into a deep, dark red that flickered before his eyes.

He looked up. Lu's enraged face, reflected in his eyes, began to grow more and more distant. He felt himself rising, floating away, swiftly leaving the infinite illusions behind.

The cool energy rushed straight to his mind. Everything before him faded rapidly, dissolving back into endless darkness. His memories returned, and he felt as light as air.

In his Juque Palace, the ice melted in an instant, and a powerful flame erupted, roaring through the acupoint. Li Ximing felt as if he were rising from boundless darkness toward infinite light. He saw visions of gardenias blooming and heard the ringing of camel bells. His world became brilliantly bright.

*BOOM!*

He felt himself fly up from where he stood, entering a place of infinite truth. The darkness was absolute, yet the stars in the sky seemed to shift, sometimes near, sometimes far. Countless figures seemed to be seated in meditation throughout the Great Void.

He flew to the very apex of the Great Void, where it seemed to be shrouded in mist and filled with countless remnants. The spiritual energy grew thinner, and the Great Void itself became narrow and fractured, turning a dull gray. The sight pained his eyes, and he plunged back down.

Below him was a boundless desert, and upon it stood a great pass. The celestial gate was majestic, the seventy-two ridges on its corner towers distinct, its white base covered in dazzling patterns of light.

His consciousness fell into it, plummeting with the celestial gate into the deepest depths. Finally, he fell from the vast Great Void and back into his physical body in the mortal world.

Li Ximing's eyes snapped open.

Before him was a dim, murky darkness. Sparse grasses and trees swayed in front of him. A drop of cold water from some melted snow trickled down and fell with a soft *plink*.

In front of him lay a golden table. The black jade box on top had been shattered by a surge of dharma power, its fragments scattered across the ground. As for the jade bottle that held the Radiant Violet Pill, it was nowhere to be seen.

The mountaintop was a complete wreck, as if it had been ravaged by demons a hundred times over. Jade pillars had collapsed. The tallest one lay right beside him, the words he had carved on it now faded and barely visible beneath a curtain of vines.

The formation lines on the ground that gathered spiritual qi were in disarray. The plants, nourished by the celestial light, had grown wild, nearly covering the entire summit. Small, golden specks of sand and a white-gold mist drifted through the air.

It was the darkest hour before the dawn. The stars were bright in the moonlit sky, and the pale moonlight flowed over the ground, making the white-gold mist glow faintly, creating a strange and beautiful scene.

*Rustle...*

Li Ximing stood up, and a shower of dead leaves fell from his clothes.

The celestial light was gone from the young man's pupils, and no bright aura surrounded him. Even his golden-white Daoist robes seemed ordinary. He looked younger, his skin fairer.

He seemed little changed from before, except for a new, tiny, white-gold dot at the center of his brow. It was neither painted nor tattooed, but shone with a brilliance like a point of celestial light, illuminating everything around it.

Li Ximing stood motionless for a long time. Behind his head, halos of rainbow light began to expand, one after another. The golden-white light of his Bright Yang divine power emerged from his sides, draping over him like a cloak and rising more than nine feet into the air.

He finally moved his lips and exhaled a breath of celestial light.

Before the breath could touch the ground, a purple flame ignited from thin air. It moved like a lithe flood dragon, soaring and weaving through the air. The flame was purple on the outside and gold on the inmost, its heat intense. Golden dust from the celestial light scattered around the dazzling flame, glittering as it was carried by the heat, spreading everywhere.

The purple flame spread across the ground, and in the space of a breath, it had set the whole of Mount Wu alight. As the fire spread, gardenia trees sprang from the earth, their canopies wide. In the midst of the roiling flames, pure white gardenia blossoms drifted down, blanketing the ground in snow.

The vast river of purple flames surged toward the heavens, its outer edges purple, its core gold, burning so brightly it seemed to bring the dawn ahead of time.

And then, the true, brilliant dawn began to rise swiftly in the east. Amidst the mountain of purple fire, Li Ximing stood beneath a gardenia tree, draped in the light of Bright Yang, as white petals swirled around his feet.

The first ray of morning sunlight passed through the formation and fell upon his pupils.

In the next instant, that ray of light was trapped within his eyes. They turned a pale gold, light flowing within them. His old ocular art, the Great Fissure Golden Pupils, had instantly reached its zenith.

His eyes, glowing in the firelight, slowly lifted. He looked toward the distant south. The clouds in the sky above him parted, scattering down a brilliant white radiance.

"The sky has brightened."

***

**Moongaze Lake.**

A light snow was falling. The moonlight was clear and bright, reflected in the cold surface of the lake. A late-night breeze sent ripples across the water. Streaks of light from flying cultivators crisscrossed the sky, giving the place an ethereal, immortal air.

It was the Zi hour, and most of the lamps around Moongaze Lake had been extinguished. But the many cultivators on patrol and guard duty were still awake, flying back and forth over the lake like colorful ribbons.

On the lush slopes of Mount Qingdu, in a talisman pavilion crafted from elegant, rustic redwood, an old man washed his inkstone. He carried the fresh ink inside, spread a sheet of talisman paper on his desk, and lifted his brush, pausing for a moment.

The old man was always busy. Though it was late, well into the Zi hour, he had not stopped working, painting one talisman after another. He watched as the cinnabar-red marks appeared on the yellow paper, then let out a breath, having finished another one.

Li Xuanxuan put it aside, then noticed that the room seemed unusually bright. He casually extinguished a few magical lamps, but then realized something was wrong.

"Where is that light coming from..."

He looked up and saw more than a dozen cultivators standing scattered across the lake, some near, some far, all staring eastward in a daze. They were bathed in a golden light, their shadows stretching long across the water.

The old man's gaze shifted, and he finally saw it: a brilliant, golden dawn rising in the east.

The golden radiance was reflected in his tired, clouded eyes. The talisman brush in his hand fell with a clatter onto the desk, rolling twice and smearing ink all over the paper, ruining it completely.

But Li Xuanxuan seemed not to hear. He braced a hand against the windowsill, his old face aglow with the light of the dawn. Tears welled in his eyes. He forced them shut, his breathing growing heavy.

On the twenty-second day of the winter month, at the Zi hour, the moonlight over Moongaze Lake retreated. The sky had brightened.



# Chapter 688: An Underworld Registration

**The Azure Pond Sect.**

Green peaks pierced the sky, wreathed in clouds and mist. The grand hall shone with the light of magical arts, its vermillion gates and high eaves marking it as a place of power. Corridors wound through the complex, and the fragrant smoke of incense curled through the air, painting a picture of a true immortal sect.

A streak of clear light shot across the sky, halting before the stairs. It resolved into a man wearing an ornate crown. He took the steps two at a time, crossed the immortal threshold, and hurried into the hall where a middle-aged man sat at the head seat, brush in hand, focused on a painting.

The crowned man’s expression was anxious, but the middle-aged man preempted him, pulling him over to look at the work. The painting depicted a tall, stately peach tree, around which three flood-dragon serpents were coiled, each baring its claws and fangs.

The serpent on the right was fat and bloated, but the poisonous stinger on its tail gleamed wickedly. The one on the left was small, thin, and weak, but its eyes were dotted with gold lacquer and its form was wreathed in vermillion clouds. The one in the center was powerful and majestic, yet it carried an air of old age.

The middle-aged man smiled. “Fellow Daoist Dantai, what do you think of this painting?”

The crowned man, Dantai Jin, had no choice but to pause and study the artwork. After a moment, he replied in a placid tone, “Sect Master, your skill is sublime… excellent. But the space beneath the tree is empty. Adding a deep pond would give it more depth.”

“Hahahaha!” Si Yuanli roared with laughter and clapped him on the shoulder. “Brother, what a fine eye you have.”

Dantai Jin bowed in return, then lowered his voice. “My spirit falcon has returned from the north. At the Zi hour, the sky over Moongaze Lake brightened. Purple flames soared from Mount Wu, and rainbow clouds billowed—a true Bright Yang phenomenon. The effects will likely spread to envelop the entire lake.”

“Hah!” Si Yuanli’s head snapped up, his gaze sharp. He shook his head and sighed. “Alas! Li Ximing has perished!”

Dantai Jin frowned. “According to my earlier deductions,” he said softly, “he would have entered seclusion twelve to fourteen years ago. For him to reach the Purple Mansion Realm now… the timing is indeed a bit too short.”

“Too short is an understatement!” Si Yuanli shook his head. “Pushing an Immortal Foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint takes a decade. Even with the pill from the Xiao family and all the treasures he prepared himself, it would take five years at the minimum! The Li family lacks the deep foundations of an ancient house, and Li Ximing is no Tu Longjian.”

“Manifesting a divine power is even more perilous—that requires another six years. I never discussed the Dao with him, so I have no idea how deep his understanding of Bright Yang is. Let’s be generous and assume he consumed the Radiant Sky Stone and, by some great stroke of luck, passed that trial.”

“But after that comes the trial of oblivion, which can easily last more than a decade!” he sighed, grinding fresh cyan ink for his brush. “For a phenomenon to appear now can only mean one thing—he has died!”

Seeing him turn back to the paper to paint the pond, Dantai Jin pressed, “But the phenomenon is vast and extraordinary.”

“Because he consumed the Radiant Sky Stone!” Si Yuanli said, still shaking his head. “That is a Purple Mansion-grade treasure. How could the resulting phenomenon not be vast? The stone corresponds directly to the Radiant Origin Pass. Even you, Dantai Jin, might not have such favorable conditions. He is a Wei Li, he cultivated Bright Yang, and he consumed a Purple Mansion treasure. Such a grand spectacle is only natural upon his death.”

Dantai Jin frowned. “Is there no chance he succeeded?”

Si Yuanli paused to think. “It was a possibility. He is a Wei Li, after all. Perhaps his family possessed some secret art that gave him an advantage with Bright Yang, which is why he dared to use the stone… but do you think our superiors wouldn't have anticipated that?”

“As long as he used it, we didn't have to worry. The trial of oblivion would trap him for decades. What would it matter if he eventually succeeded? By then, Li Zhouwei would have long been dealt with. It would have been good if he had managed to become a Bright Yang Purple Mansion cultivator—being in the north, he would have been a perfect shield against the Buddhist cultivators… A pity… he has perished.”

“Besides,” Si Yuanli added, “I heard he was a soft man. Even if he passed the divine power trial, how could he possibly endure the infinite illusions? It was all for naught.”

Dantai Jin was finally silenced. He waited quietly as Si Yuanli finished the painting and handed it to him.

Dantai Jin unrolled it. A small pond now lay beneath the peach tree. The serpent on the left was now half-submerged, its body obscured by the pond’s edge, making it appear even smaller and weaker than before.

Leaving the main peak, Si Yuanli flew on a cloud to another summit. A solitary pavilion stood there, seemingly suspended in the mist. Countless jade talismans hung from its eaves, swaying and chiming in the breeze.

“Fellow Daoist Xizhi!”

Si Yuanli stepped into the pavilion and found Li Xizhi engrossed in a jade slip. He had aged into a middle-aged man, still carrying an air of refined nobility, though his years as the pavilion master had clearly lent him a more scholarly grace.

“Greetings, Sect Master!” Li Xizhi rose at once to welcome him.

Si Yuanli, not daring to be arrogant, quickly steadied him, a deep apprehension in his heart. ‘So many years have passed. I wonder how powerful his arts have become!’

In the entire Azure Pond Sect, the only person Si Yuanli truly feared was the man before him.

In his eyes, Li Xizhi’s cunning was unfathomable. He was clearly a prodigy in the Dao of arts, yet since joining the sect as a teenager, he had never once displayed his talent. He had probably even fooled Yuan Tuan!

‘He didn’t even reveal his true power when Tuoba Chongyuan was hunting him, when his life was on the line!’

It wasn’t until the battle at the Sea of Reefs that Si Yuanli learned that this man was the true genius of the Li family’s ‘Xi’ generation. His talent for magical arts even surpassed that of Yu Muxian, who had once been hailed as a prodigy!

‘If his wife weren’t a member of the Yang family… I would have certainly arranged a marriage alliance to bind him to my cause… Ah well, the current arrangement is not so bad.’

His thoughts were heavy, but his face was a mask of concern. “Xizhi,” he said in a low voice, “there has been trouble at Moongaze Lake!”

Li Xizhi’s expression shifted, his brow furrowing. Si Yuanli recounted the events, his words completely different from those he had shared with Dantai Jin. He spoke of Li Ximing with tact and subtlety, approaching the subject from all angles.

Li Xizhi himself knew a fair amount about the trials of the Purple Mansion Realm. As he listened to Si Yuanli’s account, his heart went hollow. He slowly closed his eyes and exhaled. “Sect Master,” he said softly, “you mean to say… my brother… has likely failed his breakthrough and perished.”

Si Yuanli nodded hesitantly. “Not necessarily… perhaps he succeeded…”

Li Xizhi knew it was mere politeness. He stood in silence for several breaths before saying respectfully, “Thank you for informing me, Sect Master. I must ask you to excuse me.”

Si Yuanli nodded in understanding and departed on the wind. Li Xizhi saw him off, then, holding himself together by sheer will, stumbled back into the pavilion. He closed his eyes, and tears began to fall. They glistened on the man’s face as five words escaped his lips.

‘Ming’er… had it so hard…’

Li Xizhi’s eyes narrowed. He forced the tears back with his spiritual qi as he pulled out a letter from his desk and began to write, his heart growing colder by the second.

‘Since Ming’er has failed and perished, Grandfather must be heartbroken… Of the Xi generation, only I remain. Everyone is scheming against my family’s heir. Even if I have to risk my life and my cultivation, I must protect Zhouwei…’

***

As dawn broke, the purple flames on Mount Wu surged toward the heavens. Clumps of white gardenias rolled along the fiery currents at the summit, and pale golden sand swirled in the air.

Mount Wu, once composed of basalt with reddish-brown soil, had been utterly transformed. The earth had turned a lacquer black, and the stones had cracked, all of them taking on the hue of Radiant Sky Stone. The entire mountain had become a domain of Bright Yang. The grand formation that once protected it had shifted, its power greatly diminished.

Amidst the rolling spiritual sand and blooming gardenias, Li Ximing reacquainted himself with his body. His Cinnabar Sea was filled with heavenly glows, and his Juque Palace was a space of pure, clear light. The snow from before had long since melted, the celestial light within it transmuting into Bright Yang Purple Flames that now flowed freely through the acupoint.

‘Fire soars in the heart, with Yang and Ming as its exterior and interior. Thus is the Radiant Splendor divine power achieved. Its radiance extends over nine feet, emitting purple flames as rainbow clouds rise and fade…’

Li Ximing had not understood the scripture before, but now it was perfectly clear. ‘Fire soars in the heart’ naturally referred to the Juque Palace. The Bright Yang Purple Flames accumulated there, ready to be unleashed with a single thought.

‘Golden armor and golden robes descend from the sky. The sun glows red in the east, and Baleful Earth erupts in the south. Then one roams the Great Void to temper the golden lotus…’

The morning sun was brilliant, but there were no signs of golden-clad soldiers. Perhaps it was because his divine power had not yet manifested externally. He paused, then swept his spiritual sense over the southern face of Mount Wu.

There, the Bright Yang Purple Flames burned with particular intensity, shattering the Radiant Sky-colored stone. Jets of reddish-black Baleful Earth Qi gushed from the ground, only to be suppressed by the purple flames and confined to a small patch of land.

‘This must be “the sun glows red in the east, and Baleful Earth Qi erupts in the south”! My ascension has greatly benefited this mountain, turning it into a Bright Yang treasured land. This Baleful qi is extraordinary. It can be used for alchemy and smithing, and perhaps I can even extract some form of Bright Yang qi from it.’

He sat for a few moments, and then the Great Void seemed to hum. Two figures materialized beside him.

Li Ximing lifted his head slightly, his eyes once more a pale gold. The point of celestial light at his brow pulsed, and the grey aura cloaking the two figures dissolved, revealing their true forms.

One was short and squat, with two horns sprouting from his forehead. He wore a simple grey cloth draped around his neck. His face was hideous; his eyes were set so far to the sides that only half of each was visible from the front. His teeth were long and thin, his pupils a dark, murky green. In his hand, he clutched a grey brush as long as a pestle.

The other was a head taller, his body draped in strings of copper coins. His face was unnaturally long and wide, stretching all the way down to his chest. His nose bisected his face, and his eyes were a startling pink. He was struggling to hold a massive book.

The horned one stepped forward and gave a casual bow. His voice was shrill and reedy.

“Greetings, Fellow Daoist! I am Wang Long, an envoy from the Underworld Bureau of the Netherworld. Good news… good news! You have achieved a divine power, and I have come on behalf of my colleagues to offer congratulations! Congratulations, congratulations! May you transcend life and death, perfect your divine power, master the five arts, avoid the great calamity, attain fruition early, and achieve truth hereafter…!”

He rattled off a string of four-character blessings in his piercing voice. When he finally finished, the long-faced man beside him added, “Congratulations, congratulations!”

Wang Long then bowed to introduce his partner. “This is my companion, Zhang Gui.”

“So you are esteemed envoys from the Underworld Bureau!”

‘No wonder they arrived so quickly,’ Li Ximing thought, returning their salute.

Wang Long’s shrill voice cut in. “Is this the ‘Radiant Origin Pass’?”

Zhang Gui, his long face impassive, glanced at Li Ximing for a moment. “Correct,” he replied. “The style is ancient. It’s the ‘Audience with the Celestial Gate’ of the Wei Li. Fellow Daoist’s version is not the orthodox one. It’s likely a simplified variant practiced by a collateral imperial branch that guarded the northern border. It is called ‘Radiant Origin Pass’.”

“Good, good, good,” Wang Long chirped. He immediately turned to Li Ximing. “Your surname and given name?”

Having just endured the trial of infinite illusions, the request for his name made him hesitate. The words caught in his throat for a second before he answered calmly, “I am Li Ximing of the Li Clan. ‘Xi’ as in the heavenly dawn, ‘Ming’ as in the sun and moon.”

The moment he finished speaking, the brush in Wang Long’s hand flashed, and ink welled at its tip. The horned man nudged his long-faced, book-carrying companion. “Have you found it yet!”

Zhang Gui remained as slow as ever, his hand tracing lines across the page as he searched. He made no sound. Wang Long was clearly impatient. He ignored his partner and began muttering to Li Ximing.

“Honestly… a few True Monarch-level figures, why must they fight? They punched a hole in the sky, and several True Monarchs went to watch in person, stirring up trouble in heaven and on earth.”

“Fellow Daoist, on my way here, I heard a piece of flesh fell from the sky in the State of Wu. It was as large as a city and rotted the surrounding lands. I wonder who was so displeased… sigh…”

He grumbled on, a worried expression on his half-ghostly face. “And I don’t know if Fellow Daoist Si will be able to break through to the Golden Core Realm. If not… we won’t be able to collect this century’s quota of Metallic Essence!”

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal grunt. Unsure of the customs of these Underworld officials, he held his tongue. Wang Long’s impatience grew with every passing second. He spun around, his reedy voice sharp with irritation as he snapped at the long-faced Zhang Gui.

“Old friend, what time is it! You’re dragging your feet! When those old geezers find out, they’ll accuse us of neglecting the affairs of the departed, and you’ll be the one to suffer!”

Zhang Gui looked from side to side, then slammed the massive book shut. He knitted his barely-there brows, making his face even more grotesque. “I can’t find him,” he answered slowly.

Wang Long froze. He grabbed the book’s cover, shoved with both hands, and with a grunt of effort, sent the great tome tumbling to the ground. It immediately fell apart into several smaller volumes, scattering everywhere.

“How could you make a mistake like this?” he shrieked. “Did you copy all this for nothing?”

The two Underworld envoys seemed to be in a tremendous hurry. They scrambled about, frantically searching through the scattered books. Li Ximing glanced down. The volumes were of various colors, and his spiritual sense passed right through them as if they weren't there.

‘Dharma power probably can’t lift these books, and I doubt any arts would affect them… I wonder if I could pick one up with my divine power.’

The two were hunched over, grabbing volumes and flipping rapidly through the pages. The air filled with the rustling sound.

*Rustle, rustle…*

Li Ximing took the opportunity to look down at the volume by his feet. It had a purple-and-gold cover bound with several white cords, making it the most distinguished of the lot. In the swirling purple flames, it was flipping its own pages, coming to rest at the very last one. An inscription ran down the side of the page:

“Registry of Purple Mansion Divine Powers Observed by the Five-Directional Emissaries of Jiao and Yang Provinces—Compiled by the Record-Keeping Ghost, Zhang Gui.”

At the very top of the page, a line of golden text was inscribed in ancient intaglio script, which Li Ximing recognized at once.

“On the third day of the second month in the 697th year of the Yin-time Earth Virtue Cycle, the cultivator, Daoist Master Guanxuan, Yang Tianya, of the Guli tribe of Yangzhou, currently in the territory of the Azure Pond Mountain, achieved a divine power.”

Directly beneath that golden line was another:

“On the twenty-third day of the eleventh month in the 698th year of the Yin-time Earth Virtue Cycle, the cultivator, Daoist Master Houfu, Lin Wei, of the Wuzhong tribe of Jiaozhou, currently in the territory of Linhai Commandery, achieved a divine power.”

Li Ximing’s heart jolted.

He knew both men on the page. Yang Tianya was one, of course, and Daoist Master Houfu was none other than the current head of the Great Xiukui Monastery! The year he broke through was the same year Li Ximing’s clan had been embroiled in the chaos of the Xu Xiao rebellion!

‘Yang Tianya achieved a divine power!’

‘He did it even before Daoist Master Houfu!’



# Chapter 689: An Elder's Counsel

Li Ximing had only caught a glimpse before Wang Long was already bustling to gather the books. Zhang Gui strode over and silently picked up the scattered volumes. Once they had restacked the heavy tomes, Zhang Gui finally spoke in a low voice.

“He really isn’t here…”

The two envoys exchanged a look, a silent understanding passing between them. Wang Long flipped open a purple-and-gold booklet from the bottom of the stack. Zhang Gui’s brush moved, writing for a moment on the page as a violet-gold light flowed from the tip.

“…Jing Province, Moongaze Marsh, now known as Moongaze Lake…” Zhang Gui murmured. He paused, then asked quietly, “Ximing, you haven't spent many years cultivating in other lands, have you? This is a serious matter. You mustn't hide anything from me.”

Li Ximing figured that his name should have been in their records all along. Since they couldn't find it, they were likely adding it unofficially now. He had nothing to hide. “That’s correct,” he said plainly.

Zhang Gui wrote two more characters. “Your Daoist Master name?”

After a moment of thought, Li Ximing replied, “Zhaojing.”

As Zhang Gui bent over his work, Li Ximing rested a hand on his storage pouch. After a quick search, he produced two jade boxes from his sleeve. “Thank you for taking the trouble to come all this way,” he said softly. “A small gift, to show my gratitude.”

“You’re too kind, Fellow Daoist.”

Zhang Gui didn’t stop writing, but he lifted his head to offer a word of thanks before returning to his task. Wang Long, however, eagerly accepted the boxes with a slight nod.

“It’s merely our duty,” Wang Long chirped. “You are too courteous.”

Li Ximing noted their practiced ease; this was clearly a customary exchange. The jade boxes couldn't block spiritual sense, and inside were a Drystone Brightfruit that Lu Ken had given him years ago and a vial of Baleful Earth Coldspring. One treasure was of the Earth Virtue and the other was infused with baleful qi, both having some connection to the Underworld. They were the best items he could find in his storage pouch on such short notice.

‘No one ever mentioned that the Underworld sends envoys to register new divine powers,’ he thought. ‘Fortunately, judging by Wang Long’s reaction, these two items are acceptable. I haven't offended them.’

Just as the thought crossed his mind, Zhang Gui finished writing. He put away the massive, pestle-like brush and clasped his hands in a salute. “The registration is complete. We’ve disturbed you, Fellow Daoist. With your divine power achieved, five hundred years of freedom await. When your lifespan nears its end and you seek to attain fruition, I will come again. We can speak more then.”

Wang Long hoisted the books, and together, the two tore open the Great Void, disappearing into a boundless blackness as they returned to the Underworld.

Li Ximing waited a moment, sweeping the area with the celestial light from his brow to confirm he was alone. A swirl of uncertainty filled his mind. ‘Yang Tianya has connections in the Underworld. He kept his own breakthrough a secret, which means he’s plotting something. By letting me see these two envoys, it seems he’s making a gesture of goodwill.’

‘On the other hand… my name wasn’t in the registry, and those two added it themselves. Was that on the orders of the person backing Yang Tianya? Someone with his standing is likely trying to help me.’

In light of this, the two treasures he had offered seemed trivial. Li Ximing set his doubts aside for the moment and considered his next steps. ‘Now that I’ve reached the Purple Mansion Realm, I’m expected to announce it to all the major families and sects. I doubt I can keep it a secret…’

‘But for cultivators like me, who reached the Purple Mansion Realm through the combined strength of their entire clan, the situation is different. I’m not a lone wolf like Tu Longjian, who relies only on himself. Nor do I have the backing of a sect with other Purple Mansion cultivators. Announcing my status will involve more than just words.’

He mulled it over before reaching a decision. ‘First, I’ll visit Seniors Changxi, Chuting, and Tu Longjian to express my gratitude. Then, I’ll make the official announcement to the other sects. This shows respect, and… it will give me a chance to learn about any unspoken rules or pitfalls.’

With his course set, Li Ximing suppressed his aura and plunged into the Great Void, making his way toward the Xiao family’s domain.

This was his first time traversing the Great Void. His divine power shielded his body, masking his radiance as he flew in silence. He looked around at a world of utter blackness that undulated and warped, constantly shifting up and down.

The Great Void was a reflection of the spiritual qi of the world. It wasn't flat, but a landscape of peaks and valleys. Where spiritual qi was dense, the Great Void formed a high mountain. Where it was thin for a thousand miles, crossing that distance in the Great Void was but a single step.

The moment he achieved his divine power and looked into the Great Void, he understood.

Purple Mansion cultivators could travel thousands of miles in an instant by following the barren, low-qi paths in the Great Void, crossing vast distances with each step. If an entire region was saturated with spiritual qi, it was actually faster to exit the Great Void and fly using one’s divine power. Of course, if a place had no spiritual qi at all, it simply wouldn't exist in the Great Void, making it impossible to reach.

Li Ximing journeyed for a short while, following several of these shortcuts. In less than a minute, he had arrived in the region of Mount Xianyou. Here, the void was no longer pitch black. Rings of azure light rippled through the space like waves on water.

He halted his divine power, his pupils glowing with a faint golden light as he activated his ocular art. ‘So this is a formation… The Xiao family now has a Purple Mansion-grade formation severing the Great Void. Displaying it so openly is a show of force, a far cry from the days when Chi Buzi could sneak through their defenses to threaten Xiao Guitu…’

His own clan had received similar treatment back then, though Chi Buzi had been careless enough to glimpse the Immortal Mirror and gained nothing for his efforts. A flicker of desire sparked in Li Ximing’s heart as he secretly calculated the cost. ‘If I get the chance, I must ask Senior Chuting about this. A formation like this would make the family infinitely safer.’

He had barely stopped when a ray of white light shot out from the formation and landed before him. A hazy figure materialized, and an old, authoritative voice emanated from within.

“Which Fellow Daoist has come to visit? Please, enter the formation and we shall speak.”

Li Ximing, not wishing to reveal his identity, had kept his divine power suppressed. He gave a slight nod and followed the white light into the formation. His vision instantly brightened.

A cold mist swirled around towering peaks. Two cliffs faced each other, dotted with gnarled pines and cypresses. Below, the water of a frigid pond was clear as crystal. A small boat rested silently on its surface, where the faint figure of an old man could be seen fishing.

Snow was falling, crunching softly underfoot. Li Ximing stood on the bank, bowed deeply, and said in a soft voice, “Junior Zhaojing, Li Ximing, pays his respects to the Daoist Master!”

There was a soft *creak*. The white jade fishing rod dipped as something below took the bait, only to grow wary and dart away with a flick of its tail. Ripples spread across the water, making the thin ice tinkle.

The old man calmly set down his fishing rod. “So it is Daoist Master Zhaojing,” he said. “I thought it was Chengyan. Forgive my lack of courtesy. Please, come aboard.”

Li Ximing took a single step, his form blurring in a flash of bright light before reappearing on the boat. Xiao Chuting set out a small table with two jade cups and placed a verdant jade pot upon it.

As Li Ximing took a seat, Xiao Chuting put that pot away and took out another, pouring a cup for him. “Try this,” he said with a smile.

Li Ximing took a sip.

The tea had a light flavor, and its spiritual energy was only mediocre—hardly fitting for someone of Xiao Chuting’s stature. As Li Ximing felt a flicker of confusion, the old man spoke.

“Years ago, when Li Tongya came to Crowncloud Peak, I served him this same Clearlight Fruit Leaf Tea. He thought it a great treasure and dared not drink much.”

“Today,” Xiao Chuting continued, “this tea is a common beverage even for your clan.”

Li Ximing understood his meaning and replied respectfully, “Senior, my entire clan remembers your immense kindness and would never dare to forget it. Having been fortunate enough to succeed in my breakthrough, I came to find you first. I thought you were still in the Northern Sea, so this is a pleasant surprise.”

“Good. The matter in the Northern Sea was settled long ago.” Xiao Chuting praised him with a nod and a smile. “I appreciate the sentiment. However, you should have first visited Si Boxiu. The man is a stickler for rules and values his reputation. If you don’t show him proper respect, that old traditionalist may not say anything, but he will certainly hold it against you.”

Li Ximing had planned to visit Tu Longjian second and Changxi third, leaving Si Boxiu for last. Hearing this, his heart tightened. “Thank you for the guidance, Senior!”

Xiao Chuting’s voice was warm. “You were able to overcome the trials of the Purple Mansion Realm so quickly, which speaks to your strong character. But Si Boxiu’s lifespan is nearing its end. He is at his most sensitive. You should have stabilized your relationship with him first. If you visit an outsider like me before him, what do you think he will assume?”

“Fortunately, you haven’t yet announced your breakthrough, so it doesn't officially count. You also came here with your divine power suppressed, so Si Boxiu is likely still debating whether you succeeded or not. He has the Dongli Sect’s Secret Records, but you consumed the Radiant Sky Stone. Since he never cultivated Bright Yang himself, he has no way to accurately gauge your situation.”

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully. “The Dongli Sect’s Secret Records?” he asked.

“Indeed.” Xiao Chuting took a sip of tea. “When the Dongli Sect’s grotto-heaven was carved up by the three major sects, their secret arts were divided as well. The records detail the various phenomena associated with the Bright Yang paths. Si Boxiu recognized your foundation and cultivation method back when you were still in the Foundation Establishment Realm.”

Hearing this, Li Ximing’s heart sank. His image of the stern and venerable Si Boxiu was now colored with new complexity. After thanking him again, Xiao Chuting continued.

“You won’t be able to hide your breakthrough for long. It’s only a matter of time before you’re discovered. You should announce it to the various powers soon and have your clan elevated to an Immortal Clan.”

“Once word of your divine power spreads, everyone will come to offer their congratulations. You will hold a divine power convocation, and then you must pay return visits. The first three Daoist Masters you visit are especially important. Be mindful of this.”

Li Ximing committed every word to memory, nodding with a solemn expression.

“Tu Longjian has gone to the Southern Sea,” Xiao Chuting went on. “There’s no rush to see him. He’s keeping to himself these days, trying to stay out of worldly affairs. If you visit him too hastily, you might disrupt his plans. There’s no need to reserve one of your first three official visits for him; a private visit will suffice.”

“You can visit Changxi. However, he has even less time left than Si Boxiu. The Profound Peak Gate has only one Purple Mansion cultivator, and its decline is imminent. In a few years, they might not even be able to protect their own sect.”

He paused here, seeming to observe Li Ximing’s reaction. “Consider it carefully,” he said softly. “If your friendship isn’t deep, it might be better to distance yourself now. You shouldn't be rushing to see him; he should be the one rushing to see you.”

Enlightenment dawned on Li Ximing. He knew nothing of the intricate politics of the Purple Mansion Realm. Xiao Chuting, however, was a master of it. Without an elder’s guidance, he would have made countless blunders. ‘Without knowing these subtleties, I would have been easily manipulated.’

He straightened his posture and gave a formal bow. “Zhaojing thanks the Daoist Master for his guidance!”

Xiao Chuting chuckled, a hint of warmth in his eyes. “Seeing you like this, my junior’s wish has finally been fulfilled! He suffered his whole life, treating people with sincerity only to be deceived time and again. To have a disciple like you… his bitterness has finally turned to sweetness!”

Li Ximing remembered Xiao Yuansi’s Radiant Violet Pill and nodded gently.

“Go,” Xiao Chuting said softly. “Settle your family’s affairs, then announce your achievement. Yuansi and I will attend.”

The old man’s gaze fixed on Li Ximing. He saw a flicker in the young man’s eyes at the words “settle your family’s affairs.” The youth immediately nodded, bid a quiet farewell, and vanished into the Great Void.

Alone, Xiao Chuting put away the jade cups, lost in thought. ‘He knew to come see me first, which shows he is unaware of that great figure behind him…’

He picked up his jade rod and began to fish once more in the frigid pond. As the snow fell around him, Xiao Chuting stared silently at the water, deep in contemplation.

***

By the time Li Ximing left, the purple flames on Mount Wu had begun to fade. The already fragile grand formation shuddered, and a young man descended on a bolt of lightning, holding a command token. Clad in armor and wreathed in crackling light, with eyes as dark as lacquer, it was Li Chenghui.

Behind him followed a middle-aged man in a white robe with a spear on his back. He was at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and wore a cautious expression. They landed within the formation together, the searing purple flames stinging their faces.

“Clan Uncle Siwei,” Li Chenghui said after a quick scan of the area. “The purple flames here are too intense. It would be unwise for the Old Master to enter. Please, stand guard outside and look after him. I will search for my uncle’s whereabouts.”

The man in white was none other than An Siwei. More than a decade had passed, and he had successfully reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, though his demeanor was as reserved as ever. He nodded and retreated, riding the wind away from the mountain.

Li Chenghui headed for the summit alone. The jade pillars had collapsed, and the ground was a web of cracks. Gardenia trees had sprouted everywhere, their white blossoms tumbling in the wind and rolling to a stop at his boots.

He searched the entire area but found no trace of Li Ximing, not even a scrap of his robes. All that remained underground were two piles of melted jade powder.

Shielding himself from the purple flames with lightning, Li Chenghui moved closer to inspect the site. ‘The Patriarch once instructed me that if a phenomenon occurred and he disappeared from the mountain, I was to keep his success or failure a secret, regardless of the outcome… He is not here now, so it falls to me.’

‘In recent years… the covert harassment and plots from the Three Sects of Xiaoshi Mountain, the Golden Tang Gate, and the demonic cultivators of Jiangbei have grown ever more brazen. This celestial phenomenon is sure to attract attention. There will be no peace for us. I must plan carefully.’

He picked a gardenia blossom, placed it in a jade box, and immediately withdrew. Outside the formation, Li Xuanxuan was waiting, his face etched with anxiety. When he saw Li Chenghui, he hurried forward.

“How is it?” he asked in a low voice.

Li Chenghui paused before answering softly, “The purple flames are too fierce. I couldn't see clearly and was forced to retreat.”

Li Xuanxuan had never truly believed Li Ximing could reach the Purple Mansion Realm, but he had clung to a sliver of hope. Now, that hope seemed to fade. He bowed his head, his voice old and weary.

“What do Minggong and Elder White Ape say?”

“My sister sent a message,” Li Chenghui replied respectfully. “The demonic cultivators near Coldcloud Peak were startled by the celestial phenomenon and have scattered. We should be safe for a few days. But the Patriarch is still in the Eastern Sea dealing with demons, so we must remain vigilant. The sects from Xiaoshi Mountain are not ordinary rogue cultivators; they will likely send someone to the lake.”

“Good.” Seeing that Li Chenghui had a plan, Li Xuanxuan quickly departed.

Li Chenghui looked up at the sky. “The rainbow clouds have already covered more than half of Moongaze Lake. It’s impossible the Three Sects and Seven Gates don't know. The sect must have news by now as well. All we can do is wait for word.”



# Chapter 690: Proclamation of the Purple Mansion

The moment Li Chenghui descended from Mount Wu, he was met by a cultivator in black armor. The man was thin-cheeked with gray eyes and a sword at his waist. His expression was grim, his jaw tight, his gaze heavy.

“Cousin!” the cultivator called out.

Li Chenghui nodded. “Chen Yang, what’s happened?”

Chen Yang, now in the late stage of the Qi Refining Realm, was shrouded in a swirling gray aura. He cultivated the *Pestle Ice and Sea Expansion Art*, a water-element technique the Li family had acquired years ago. Its grade was unknown, but it was a clear step above the family’s foundational arts.

The black-armored cultivator lowered his voice. “A group of people arrived from the river. They’re from the Floating Cloud Cave, one of the three sects on Mount Xiaoshi. They claim they’re here to offer congratulations.”

“Congratulations?” Li Chenghui scoffed. “The Three Sects of Mount Xiaoshi have been eyeing our shores for years, encroaching on our territory inch by inch, colluding with demonic cultivators on the northern bank… Congratulations? More like a harbinger of ill will.”

Chen Yang’s grim expression confirmed his suspicions. His recent exchange with the envoys had clearly not been pleasant. “My lord, the man leading them is arrogant, yet he’s merely a guest elder in the early Foundation Establishment Realm. They mean to provoke us, to probe our family’s true situation.”

Chen Yang was a shrewd man, not one to be trifled with. He had seen through their ploy instantly. “They refuse to enter the island, instead making a show of force in the air above the lake. The Old Master has already gone to confront them. Please, my lord, hurry.”

Hearing that Li Xuanxuan had been intercepted, Li Chenghui’s expression finally changed. A strange, ancient light flickered in his lacquer-dark eyes, and a purple glow welled within them. “Let’s go!”

A muffled clap of thunder echoed from beneath his feet as his form blurred into a streak of purple light, streaking toward the island’s edge.

From a great distance, he could hear a sharp voice, amplified by spiritual qi. “Old man, still managing the household at your age!”

Li Chenghui’s eyes shot toward the sound. He saw An Siwei standing firm, his long spear already in hand, locked in a tense standoff with a young-looking Daoist. Behind An Siwei stood Li Xuanxuan, his brow furrowed with unease.

Rage flared in Li Chenghui’s heart. He arrived like a bolt of lightning, landing amidst the clamoring cultivators. The six command tokens of his artifact spun into the air, their pressure forcing the onlookers back a step. He slammed the butt of his spear into the ground with a deafening boom.

“You…”

The young man’s face shifted. He waved a hand, dispelling the force of the impact, his displeasure evident. “Oh… so it’s Fellow Daoist Cheng!”

Though the man appeared young and his voice was strong, his aura reeked of decline. Li Chenghui saw at a glance that this was just a facade. In truth, this was some old fossil who had only managed a lucky breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm after a century of cultivation, thanks to the recent surge of spiritual qi in the state of Yue.

“Greetings, Fellow Daoist,” Li Chenghui said coldly.

‘The Floating Cloud Cave is not without powerful cultivators,’ he thought. ‘This man is nothing but a pawn sent to test the waters.’

The Three Sects of Mount Xiaoshi were a relatively new power from across the river. They all hailed from the same mountain and acted as one. With the Golden Tang Gate backing them, they were a force to be reckoned with. They were a typical northern power, unbound by the orthodoxies and immortal laws of the Three Sects and Seven Gates. Their ranks were a chaotic mix of immortal, demonic, and Buddhist cultivators, and they had been a constant source of friction for the Li family over the last decade.

He didn't recognize the man, but the man clearly recognized him. Li Chenghui had stood guard on the northern bank for several years. His lightning arts, combined with the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman, had once routed several demonic cultivators so thoroughly that the Three Sects were shaken and had to send a Buddhist cultivator to deal with him.

“Fellow Daoist Cheng… your cultivation has improved again! I am Zaixingzi. It is a pleasure to meet you!”

Perhaps realizing he was no match for Li Chenghui, and on foreign soil, Zaixingzi adopted a cordial tone, though his smile didn’t reach his eyes. “I was merely asking after the old senior. I meant no harm.”

Li Chenghui was not fooled by the thinly veiled mockery. “State your business,” he said flatly.

Zaixingzi chuckled. “Our sect master saw the rainbow clouds gathering over Moongaze Lake and the sky brightening at midnight. We presumed that Senior Ximing has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, so we came to offer our congratulations! Where might the senior be?”

Li Chenghui stared at him, his voice like ice. “My elder’s affairs are none of your concern. Be on your way.”

Zaixingzi frowned. “Fellow Daoist, you are hardly welcoming. I came to offer congratulations… yet I am not permitted to see him? And I’ve seen no official announcement to the great families…”

He let out a short, muffled laugh, answering his own question. “I believe a failed breakthrough also produces quite the phenomenon… could it be that your esteemed elder…”

The Three Sects and the Li family were enemies. Zaixingzi made no move to enter the island’s grand formation, simply hovering outside it. His voice, amplified by his power, boomed across the lake.

Li Chenghui’s brow slowly furrowed.

Everyone in the clan knew about the phenomenon, and all the major families suspected it was Li Ximing, though they were unsure of the specifics as the clan had remained silent. Now, with Zaixingzi’s public speculation, anyone with a lick of sense would guess the truth. An Siwei and the others stiffened.

Zaixingzi sneered. “To fail after only a decade… your elder was certainly hasty! Fellow Daoist Cheng, you yourself know that breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm is not a matter of a mere dozen years!”

Li Chenghui held his token, his expression unmoving.

With the family in a precarious situation, Zaixingzi’s bold and timely arrival told Li Chenghui everything he needed to know. His face darkened.

‘The Floating Cloud Cave has shallow roots. They couldn’t possibly have understood the celestial phenomenon, let alone been so certain as to come asking questions. They have deep ties to the Golden Tang Gate… this has Situ Mo’s fingerprints all over it.’

Zaixingzi’s words were too pointed, his knowledge too specific for it to have originated from his own sect. It had to be Situ Mo pulling the strings from behind the scenes. Li Chenghui had been a target of that man’s insidious plots before and knew the depths of his cunning. He could only sigh inwardly.

He spoke clearly. “The purple flames on our Mount Wu have yet to subside. Our elder has not yet emerged from seclusion. If Fellow Daoist Zaixingzi continues to cause trouble here, do not blame my lightning for being merciless!”

Li Chenghui cut him off before he could spout any more nonsense, the token in his hand already glowing with purple light. Zaixingzi just chuckled.

‘I already know Li Zhouwei went out to hunt demons!’ he thought. ‘What’s the point in pretending? Where else would he dare go besides the Eastern Sea… and without that White Qilin, does your Li family truly dare to start a fight?’

After a final laugh, Zaixingzi feigned alarm. “Fellow Daoist, please don’t be angry! I was merely concerned. So, your esteemed elder truly has broken through and is now recuperating in seclusion… My sect master had me prepare a gift. You wouldn’t turn me away, would you?”

As he spoke, his gaze swept past Li Chenghui and locked onto Chen Yang behind him. He saw the man’s eyes were incredibly sharp and hostile, like a poisoned blade used for flensing bone.

Zaixingzi was taken aback that a mere Qi Refining cultivator would dare to look at him with such venom. He paused, momentarily forgetting his next move as he took note of the man. ‘Such a venomous gaze. I wonder which Li family junior that is. I’ll have to find a chance to kill him sooner rather than later.’

Li Chenghui heard the blatant sarcasm in Zaixingzi's words, and a chill crept into his heart. ‘It seems the other sects are quite certain that Clan Uncle Ximing has failed… They came prepared. I can fend them off this time… but what about the next?’

In truth, the Li family knew a breakthrough was unlikely given the short time frame. Their hopes were slim, but as long as Li Ximing’s life jade in the ancestral hall remained lit, a sliver of hope endured. Yet more than a decade had passed, and the jade slip had not been nourished by its owner’s spiritual sense in all that time, making its status unreliable.

‘Even with the patriarch’s careful planning, who could have predicted this celestial phenomenon…’

The thought flashed through Li Chenghui’s mind. Zaixingzi had already presented a jade box, holding it out respectfully with both hands while his cold eyes watched Li Chenghui’s reaction.

Every eye was fixed on the box. Li Chenghui swallowed his anger, his expression returning to a calm mask as he prepared to accept it.

‘I have to deal with this for now.’

He had just reached out his hand when another, luminous and fair, shot past him. It deftly plucked the jade box from Zaixingzi’s grasp, turned it over in its palm, and held it up to the light for inspection.

‘Huh?’

Not only Li Chenghui, but Zaixingzi too was stunned into silence. A hush fell over the entire lake as everyone stared, dumbfounded, at the figure in the sky.

A man in a white and gold Daoist robe had appeared between them without warning. His features were not exceptionally handsome, but they were well-formed and proper. His pale golden eyes were fixed on the jade box, and at the center of his brow, a point of celestial light shone with blinding brilliance.

This was Zaixingzi’s first visit to the Li family; he had never seen this person before. The celestial light from the man’s brow was so bright he could barely keep his eyes open. A thought struck him, and he sneered inwardly. ‘Li Zhouwei? So you didn’t leave after all… So what?’

Before he could speak, an excited voice cried out beside him. “Clan Uncle!”

‘Clan Uncle? That’s the wrong generation!’

Zaixingzi was thoroughly confused now. He stared at the man’s face, only to see him look up from the box, his calm, golden eyes meeting his own.

“I have achieved divine power, and this is the gift your sect brings me? A trinket for a Qi Refining cultivator?”

Zaixingzi’s mind went blank. He vaguely heard the old man behind Li Chenghui let out a choked sob that turned into a laugh. He saw the wild joy explode across Li Chenghui’s face.

‘What?’

‘Li… Xi… Ming?! A Daoist Master?!’

Silence reigned over Moongaze Lake, broken only by the old man’s triumphant laughter. Zaixingzi’s mind was a maelstrom of chaos. He saw a blinding celestial light that drilled into his pupils and shot straight into his brain.

The skin on Zaixingzi’s face peeled back as if caught in a gale, revealing the wrinkled, ancient visage beneath. The sheer terror in his eyes vanished as his pupils began to tremble violently. Both eyeballs leaped from their sockets, transforming into two large, brown cicadas that buzzed away into the air.

The sight of the eyeless old man was utterly horrific. His arms shattered like porcelain, exploding into a shower of fragments. The sun in the sky seemed to become a terrifying weapon, causing his entire body to go limp. His flesh, as if boiled to mush, slid from his bones in great sheets. His heart leaped from his chest like an untamed stallion, dragging his scorpion-shaped stomach and a long train of intestines with it.

Then, in an instant, the illusion vanished. Zaixingzi was whole again, restored to his original appearance. His lips trembled twice, and then he exploded into a cloud of flying stones.

Li Ximing turned his face away.

Zaixingzi had cultivated the Earth Virtue, and the stones that rained down from the sky were Radiant Sky Stones, falling like a pure white snow as Li Ximing stood silently in their midst, sending ripples across the lake.

The cultivators who had come with Zaixingzi went weak at the knees. Some fainted from fright, tumbling into the water with a splash. Li family cultivators scrambled to fish them out, jolting them awake with bursts of spiritual qi and forcing their heads up to continue watching the spectacle in the sky.

The purple flames on Mount Wu flared, growing thicker and more intense. A brilliant column of celestial light shot into the heavens, connecting with the rainbow clouds and transforming them into a dazzling, blinding expanse. The whole of Moongaze Lake was saturated with celestial light, its surface a perfect mirror reflecting the sky, until heaven and earth were a single sheet of brilliant white.

Li Ximing did not speak, but a vast, resonant voice emanated from him, spreading through the Great Void and reaching every corner of the state of Yue.

“I, Zhaojing, Li Ximing of the Moongaze Li clan, have this day achieved the Bright Yang divine power! I hereby proclaim my clan an Immortal Clan of the Purple Mansion Realm. In three months, a celebratory rite will be held. All fellow Daoists are welcome to attend!”

The voice was clear and resonant, carried for thousands of miles by his divine power. As Li Ximing hovered over the lake, specks of glittering gold began to emerge from the rainbow clouds.

*Hummm…*

A magnificent, bright white celestial gate, covered in intricate patterns, materialized from the clouds. Majestic dragon banners and phoenix-drawn chariots of every color streamed through it, accompanied by fluttering canopies and streamers. Golden-armored and golden-robed celestial soldiers, each bearing a weapon, filled the sky.

Celestial music and profound hymns swelled in the air as the gate descended from the heavens. Almost every cultivator present lost their ability to fly, dropping to the ground to stare up in awe.

‘The Bright Yang divine power: Audience with the Celestial Gate!’

Only now did Li Ximing understand what an art-based divine power truly was. His own body contained only purple flame and celestial light; his entire power was manifested in the magnificent spectacle of the Audience with the Celestial Gate. The Wei Li clan had been an imperial lineage, and the sheer pomp of this divine power was enough to inspire awe and fear in any who beheld it.

He stood silently amidst the celestial light and music. In the Great Void, figures who had been watching now began to reveal themselves one by one. Li Ximing nodded to them with a smile, listening as their voices rang out.

A celestial mountain wreathed in profound black qi was the first to appear. A powerful voice boomed, “Congratulations, young friend, on your breakthrough! On behalf of the Profound Peak Gate, Changxi wishes you great success with your divine power, and may you forge your Golden Core within a century!”

Li Ximing looked up and saw a middle-aged man with a jade pendant on his chest standing on the mountain. In the blink of an eye, the man’s appearance shifted to that of a white-haired elder, a strange and wondrous sight.

“Senior, you are too kind!”

He returned the greeting, then turned to the south, where a simple cloud had appeared. A stern-faced old man stood within it, his gaze filled with surprise and a complex mix of other emotions. “I am Si Boxiu of the Azure Pond Sect. On behalf of my sect, I congratulate you on reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. As a gift, I offer you the great lake. May you master the five arts and attain Fruition!”



# Chapter 691: Congratulations from the Great Clans

Standing firm in the clouds, Si Boxiu finished his congratulations. Li Ximing immediately clasped his hands in a formal salute.

“Our family has cultivated for a century under the shelter of the great sects,” he said softly. “Your own clan has offered much assistance, and for that we are grateful. My elder brother still serves within the sect. I hope that you will continue to look after him in the future, Senior.”

The complex emotions in Si Boxiu’s eyes remained, but his expression softened considerably. Li Ximing’s breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm was an undeniable fact. What more could be said? He could only sigh. “During the turmoil of the Chi clan’s reign, you were treated harshly,” he said in a conciliatory tone. “For that, I offer my apologies.”

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal reply, his tone still deferential. “You are too kind, Senior. I am not worthy of such words.”

As their exchange concluded, a crimson rune of parting light pierced through the Great Void, materializing in the sky. The light pulsed, coalescing into shimmering motes that formed the figure of a man with thick eyebrows. He wore a wide-sleeved robe with a crossed collar, the edges embroidered with dense patterns of parting light runes. His features were open and honest, his eyes large. He clasped his fists together loosely and announced in a resonant voice, “Hengli of the Hengzhu Immortal Dao, on behalf of my tradition, I offer you congratulations. May you find affinity with the five arts, may the golden lotus bloom with ease, may you transcend upon grasping the purple, and may your Intercalary Sun Art achieve perfection.”

This was Daoist Master Hengli of the Hengzhu Dao, one of the most renowned artifact refiners in Jiangnan. His personal appearance was a clear sign of the Hengzhu Dao’s sincerity. Li Ximing had long heard of his reputation and did not take the gesture lightly. “I have long heard of your esteemed name, Senior,” he replied, returning the salute. “You truly live up to your reputation.”

Hengli let out a low chuckle and nodded. “The Nine-Colored Profound Mercury you entrusted to us has been kept safe. Now that you have reached the Purple Mansion Realm, I have already dispatched someone to deliver it. They are on their way.”

Li Ximing understood that he was referring to the Purple Mansion spiritual object obtained from Wang Fu and responded graciously. Just then, a streak of golden light appeared to the west, revealing a powerfully built man with broad shoulders. He shot a cold glare at Hengli before turning to Li Ximing.

“I am Tianque of the Golden Feather Sect. I come on behalf of my sect to congratulate Daoist Master Zhaojing. May your divine powers be honed through a hundred refinements, may your righteous arts never falter, may your light illuminate the cosmos, and may you attain your true nature!”

These two Daoist Masters were both skilled in combat, and it was well known they did not get along. Li Ximing quickly interjected, saying softly, “The Golden Feather Sect and my ancestors were on good terms. Your presence brings light to my humble home.”

After Daoist Master Tianque nodded, a tall, slender man in shamanistic robes appeared in the clouds. His expression was placid, his gaze distant. He gave a casual salute. “Houfu of the Great Xiukui Monastry, here to offer congratulations.”

Though the Great Xiukui Monastry was considered a righteous path, its traditions were strange and esoteric, and its members rarely socialized. Houfu’s appearance was a gesture of respect for the Li family’s upstanding conduct. The moment Li Ximing acknowledged him, Houfu dissolved into a puff of black smoke and vanished.

Immediately after, a middle-aged man with a sword on his back offered his own salute, his tone relatively mild. “I am Cheng Jiuwen, representing the Sword Gate. If you have the opportunity, you are welcome to visit us.”

The Sword Gate and the Xiukui Monastry were famously aloof. The middle-aged man seemed to hold the current proceedings in disdain. As soon as Li Ximing returned his salute, he vanished back into the Great Void.

Once the man from the Sword Gate had departed, a Daoist-robed man with a kind and gentle face and willow-leaf eyes appeared with a smile. “I am Changxiao, here to congratulate Daoist Master Zhaojing!”

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. The man’s face held no trace of hostility, only a warm, beaming smile. But Li Ximing knew better than to trust him. Not only was this man notoriously difficult to deal with, but the Radiant Sky Stone essential for Li Ximing’s breakthrough had been obtained from the Changxiao Sect.

‘Back then, it was a game played by many cultivators,’ he thought, his mind racing. ‘The Changxiao Sect paid a price, but with their key members confined to the sect, Changxiao used the Radiant Sky Stone as bait to outmaneuver the Hengzhu Dao and keep Tu Longjian from taking a side… Our family just got lucky. But who knows what this old fox is really thinking?’

Though wary, he maintained a polite facade and responded cordially. Changxiao’s voice was deep and resonant. “Daoist Master Zimu of the Purple Smoke Gate is in seclusion, and the other master is of your generation. She is out searching for the reincarnation of Zipei and could not attend. Please do not take offense.”

He spoke as if he were on intimate terms with the Purple Smoke Gate, which gave Li Ximing pause. He offered a polite reply, and after a moment, the few remaining figures who had not shown themselves in the Great Void—including Xiao Chuting—saluted from their concealment and disappeared.

Si Boxiu was the last to leave. He had remained behind, his eyes fixed on the celestial gate in the sky. With his hands clasped behind his back, he seemed to have finally sorted through his thoughts. He gave Li Ximing a slight smile before finally departing.

The celestial light behind Li Ximing receded back into the space between his brows. The rainbow clouds in the sky faded, and the glittering celestial gate dissolved into nothingness. He descended to the surface of the lake, where over a million pairs of eyes watched him.

“We pay our respects to the Daoist Master!”

Li Chenghui was the first to step forward, so overcome with excitement and joy that his eyes were red. He bowed deeply. An Siwei and the others lowered their heads, not daring to meet his gaze, as they held the attendants who had arrived with Zaixingzi.

Li Ximing gestured for Li Chenghui to rise. He brought two fingers together and held them an inch from his lips. His pale golden eyes flashed as he blew out gently.

*Hooo…*

A rain of bright light fell from the sky, finally suppressing the purple flames that had been burning ceaselessly on Mount Wu. The flames twisted like living things, burrowing down through the earth veins and into the mountain’s core. The Baleful Earth spring was filled with the purple fire, and now it emanated a faint purple baleful energy, occasionally spitting out a lick of violet flame. It had clearly undergone a new transformation.

Having quelled the flames, Li Ximing smiled. “I was uncertain of the situation when I broke through and didn’t want others to know. I feared that if I told you, a powerful cultivator might overhear, so I went to see Daoist Master Chuting first and have only just returned.”

“It wasn’t exactly luring a snake from its hole, but we did manage to catch one or two.”

Li Chenghui bowed respectfully, the elation in his heart still so strong it left him feeling dizzy. ‘Our family has a Purple Mansion cultivator? We’re a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan?!’

Everyone stared at Li Ximing, their excitement palpable. His gaze fell upon the cultivators from the Three Sects of Mount Xiaoshi. They were pale with terror, having fainted several times already. They didn’t dare look at him, fearing his gaze alone could kill them.

The jade box still hovered in the air. Li Ximing gave a cold smile. “Chenghui, take a look at the gift from the Three Sects.”

Li Chenghui understood immediately. He gently opened the box. Inside lay a round, white object that looked eerily like an eyeball, radiating a chilling aura.

His voice was not loud, but it was hard and cold. “The Floating Cloud Cave of the Three Sects of Mount Xiaoshi presents a Lesser Yin spiritual object: the Falcon Yin Pearl.”

The men collapsed again, held up only by the spiritual qi of their Foundation Establishment captors. Across the lake, every gaze fell on them like a sword. ‘A Bright Yang cultivator breaks through, forges a divine power, and becomes a Daoist Master, and you dare to present a Lesser Yin spiritual object as a congratulatory gift? The meaning could not be more obvious. Zaixingzi got what he deserved!’ An Siwei’s anger had yet to fade, and he silently cheered.

Li Ximing smiled faintly. “Chenghui,” he said calmly, “return their gift and let them go.”

He turned his face toward the men, who were so frightened they could only stare at the ground, their souls nearly leaving their bodies. They could feel the celestial light from Li Ximing’s brow shining down on them, hot as a blazing sun, and sweat poured from their bodies like rain.

“Within three days, the Floating Cloud Cave—or the Three Sects—will give me, Zhaojing, an explanation.”

An Siwei released them. The Qi Refining cultivators, never imagining they would be allowed to live, began to kowtow and wail. A glare from Chen Yang sent them scrambling to their feet, and they flew off toward their sect on shaky gusts of wind.

“The Daoist Master is truly benevolent,” Li Chenghui said, staring coldly at their retreating figures. “They got off easy.”

He was right. Li Ximing’s actions were incredibly magnanimous. As a Purple Mansion Daoist Master who had been so gravely insulted by Foundation Establishment cultivators, he could have struck them down without consequence. Even if Zaixingzi had been from one of the three great immortal sects of Yue, he would not have been spared unless he was a direct disciple, and another Daoist Master would still have had to come and apologize.

Li Ximing could have torn through the Great Void, appeared in the skies above the Three Sects, and rained down celestial light and endless purple flames, razing the entire Floating Cloud Cave to the ground, and it would have been considered perfectly reasonable. At most, some might have called him callous.

But Li Ximing was unfamiliar with the Three Sects and acted with caution. He had only just broken through and had yet to fully master his divine powers. Fearing a hidden trap, he chose not to act too ruthlessly. He let them go, forcing the Floating Cloud Cave to come to him and atone.

As he landed, Li Chenghui immediately reported in a low voice, “Daoist Master, the Golden Tang Gate is behind the Three Sects of Mount Xiaoshi… It’s a bit tricky.”

Li Ximing understood his nephew’s meaning. The Golden Tang Gate was already struggling to save itself. For a century, it had been plagued by internal strife, and the surrounding sects were not to be underestimated. Ever since the fall of the mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator from the Situ family, their sole remaining Purple Mansion, Situ Huo, could only wander the Southern Sea, not daring to return to the mainland. Rumor had it he was severely wounded by Yuan Su a few years ago, and his current condition was unknown.

“Situ Huo’s refusal to return is the only thing keeping the Golden Tang Gate alive, allowing it to cling to its existence in Jiangbei. It was only in recent years, with Situ Mo’s rise to power and the surge of spiritual qi in the region, that they have started to recover…”

“The spiritual qi of Jiangbei,” Li Chenghui continued, “was paid for with the lives of cultivators from both the north and south…”

As he was speaking, a flash of pale red light streaked across the northern sky. A wave of fire rolled across the lake before revealing the figure of a bright and beautiful woman.

“Minggong!”

It was Li Minggong. She wore a red dress and carried a sword, her face a mixture of disbelief and overwhelming joy. She landed before them, hurriedly bowing.

“Junior… pays respects to the Daoist Master!” As she spoke, her eyes welled up with tears. She choked back a sob before continuing, “Congratulations on forging your divine power, Seventh Uncle! I… I have passed my own trial of life and death and forged the Immortal Foundation: the Pheasant Li March!”

The Pheasant Li March allowed one to command the true fire of the pheasant, refining the five organs internally and all metals externally. One could hold the pheasant’s parting flame in one’s mouth to spit fire and baleful energy, and even take the form of a bird to ride the flames. The family’s fourth-grade *Long-March Pheasant Flame Art* had always been an excellent true fire tradition. That Li Minggong was the first to forge a true fire foundation was somewhat unexpected. Li Ximing was pleased.

“Excellent!” he said warmly.

Among the Foundation Establishment cultivators, Li Minggong was one of the closest to him, being Li Xuanxuan’s direct great-granddaughter. Li Ximing smiled and helped her up. “True fire is excellent for artifact refining. You should study it well. He Jiu’s lifespan is nearing its end, and we still have no one to watch over the family’s artifact refining peak, Mount Jiumen.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Where are Chengliao and Chenghuai?”

Li Minggong clasped her fist. “Reporting to the Daoist Master,” she said softly, “Elder Brother… he failed his breakthrough a few years ago…”

“Oh…”

Li Ximing paused, a look of regret on his face. Li Minggong and Li Chengliao had similar levels of talent, but Li Chengliao had possessed the best temperament. He had thought he would surely succeed, yet the one who entered seclusion first had been the one to fall.

‘Thinking back, managing the family took too much of his time… He always had to look after his brothers and sisters, and he spent too little effort on his own cultivation. Though his cultivation base was solid, how could it compare to his siblings, who tempered themselves a thousand times over in their daily practice?’

Li Ximing was silent for a moment. Five or six years had passed, and the family had mostly recovered. He sighed inwardly, not wishing to dwell on the painful memory. “And Chenghuai?”

Li Chenghuai was the most talented of the Chengming generation. A breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm should have been well within his grasp, but cultivation depended heavily on opportunity and even luck. It was impossible to be certain.

Li Minggong stood beside him. “He is still attempting his breakthrough.”

As they spoke, they landed on the island. Over a hundred thousand people looked up at the figure bathed in brilliant light. Li Ximing made a quick calculation with his fingers and frowned. “He’s late.”

Li Chenghui spoke respectfully. “According to Twenty-ninth Brother’s cultivation speed, he should have entered seclusion long ago. However, Clan Uncle Xizhi went to great expense within the sect to acquire a fourth-grade technique of a compatible element for him, the *Art of Concealed Profundity*. It’s said to be quite miraculous. He had Chenghuai convert his cultivation base before attempting the breakthrough, which caused a delay of five or six years.”

Li Ximing’s face broke into a broad smile. “Good! A fourth-grade technique makes all the difference.”

Listening to Li Chenghui’s explanation, he walked toward the center of the island under a bright sun and a sky full of auspicious clouds.

Li Xuanxuan approached, his face streaked with tears of joy. The old man’s lips trembled, and his hands shook as he reached out. He stared at his grandson for a long time before finally managing to speak two words.

“Ming’er!”

Li Ximing’s heart had been filled with a boundless sense of peace and relief, but those two words struck him with an indescribable poignancy. He closed his eyes. He stood motionless for several breaths before finally managing a choked reply.

“Grandfather! I have not failed you!”

In the endless illusions of his tribulation, he had been devoured by beasts, walked on mountains of blades and through seas of fire, had his chest torn open and his guts ripped out—he had endured it all without a single sound. Yet now, this simple greeting nearly brought him to tears.

He turned his head slightly. “Chenghui, in three months, the Three Sects and Seven Gates and all the great clans will send representatives. Go and make the preparations.”

Li Chenghui and Li Minggong understood at once. They took two steps back and quietly closed the doors, leaving the grand hall empty save for the grandfather and grandson.

Li Xuanxuan’s cloudy eyes were filled with tears. He stood frozen, staring at the radiant celestial light on Li Ximing’s brow. After what felt like an eternity, he closed his eyes, squeezing out two more tear tracks.

The old man smiled. “If I were to die now, I could face my second and third uncles… Ximing, you have brought us glory! If Yuanping and Yuanjiao could know of this in the netherworld, they would be overcome with joy…”



# Chapter 692: Reactions from All Sides

Li Ximing answered quietly. Li Xuanxuan immediately wiped away his tears and smiled.

“This is a joyous occasion; there should be no tears. Tell me, what of your divine power?”

With a gentle wave of his sleeve, Li Ximing released a stream of celestial light that flowed from his cuff. It traced the contours of the hall’s decorations, plating the entire chamber in a luminous sheen and sealing it off from the outside world.

“It is the Bright Yang Art’s divine power: Audience with the Celestial Gate,” Li Ximing explained softly. “The Azure Pond Sect possesses the *Secret Records of Dongli*, which they obtained from the Dongli Sect’s grotto-heaven. They long ago deduced that I cultivate the *Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art* and were aware of the mysteries of our family’s Radiant Origin Pass. At the time, they paid it little mind.”

“What they didn’t know,” he continued, “is that while I used the *Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art* for my Foundation Establishment, I later converted my cultivation to the fifth-grade *Radiant Essence Scripture*, which shares the same spiritual affinity. It was with this scripture that I reached the Purple Mansion Realm. Hence, the divine power is called Audience with the Celestial Gate.”

Li Xuanxuan looked slightly puzzled. He frowned in thought before asking, “Does this mean that the divine power one forges from the Radiant Origin Pass can differ? That cultivators with different grades of Immortal Foundations will awaken different divine powers upon reaching the Purple Mansion Realm?”

Li Ximing paused for a moment. “The differences are not so great,” he said. “Excluding a few rare exceptions, only techniques of the fifth grade or higher can typically produce a divine power. Whether it is called Radiant Origin Pass or Audience with the Celestial Gate, they are both manifestations of the same Bright Yang Art. Their areas of expertise merely differ slightly.”

“As for sixth or seventh-grade techniques, perhaps their divine powers are even stronger. I have never seen them.”

The celestial light between his brows flickered as he spoke, a thoughtful expression on his face. “Upon forging this divine power, I realized that it is more closely tied to my personal Dao than to the technique I practice. It is as though I am beginning to transcend the constraints of the technique itself. Perhaps this is the difference between nature and fate. The Purple Mansion Realm touches upon fate, and it seems one is no longer bound by the limits of a cultivation art.”

He paused again, choosing his next words with care. “Connecting with the Great Void gave me a faint premonition. It seems the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao is limited by its techniques. Reaching the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm and breaking through to the Golden Core is the absolute limit. Once you forge a Golden Core nature and attain Fruition, you no longer need a technique at all. Your cultivation relies entirely on your own understanding.”

He lifted his teacup and took a small sip. “Perhaps the ancient methods of qi cultivation have arts that can be studied beyond the Golden Core, but the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao ends with the Golden Core. Once you attain Fruition and become a True Monarch, a single thought can alter the world. What technique could possibly guide such a being?”

Li Xuanxuan nodded. After a quick calculation, he said in a low voice, “I have heard that the *Answers to the Beggar Beneath the Mulberry Tree*, a text bestowed by an immortal, is the only known seventh-grade. Fifth and sixth-grade scriptures must be the pinnacle of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.”

Li Ximing nodded in agreement. He touched a finger to the space between his brows, then gestured outside. The rainbow clouds in the sky instantly dissipated. “Chenghuai cultivates the *Art of Concealed Profundity*. This radiant display is not good for him. It’s best to put it away for now.”

“How has the family fared these past ten years? And what of the world?”

Li Xuanxuan sighed and shook his head, a clear sign that the decade had not been easy. But now that the family had a Purple Mansion cultivator, those past struggles seemed insignificant. “Most of the changes have been in Jiangbei,” he said with a measure of relief. “Daoist Master Changyun’s Chengyun Gate has seized a large territory and stabilized the situation. Two other Purple Mansion cultivators from overseas have also settled there, and now sects and families of all sizes are sprouting up everywhere.”

“Jiangbei is a nexus of spiritual qi, which has also invigorated the wild temples in the untamed lands across the river. The spiritual energy there grows stronger by the day.”

Those untamed lands were on the same terrestrial meridian, situated between Moongaze Lake and the Profound Peak Gate. In the past, the spiritual qi there was sparse, home to little more than desolate temples. Now, with the meridian flourishing, new sects and families were rising.

“As for our family,” he continued, “we’ve faced more and more probing from various factions, all directed at Zhouwei. They’ve been using the Golden Tang Gate and the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion as their pawns to test our relationship with the dragonkin, growing bolder with each attempt.”

“The visit from the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion today was the culmination of that. Had you not broken through, we would have faced considerable trouble.”

“Where is Zhouwei?” Li Ximing asked.

“He feigned a trip to the Eastern Sea to hunt demons, but he’s actually positioned across the river,” Li Xuanxuan explained. “He anticipated that the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion were planning a major assault across the river to the north bank and was preparing to counter it in secret. Your breakthrough disrupted everything, and the situation has completely changed.”

“Not only did the Three Sects not cross the river, but they sent people to offer congratulations and provocations. I don’t know what they were planning.”

Li Ximing nodded. “Whatever their plan was, it no longer matters. Within three months, all the major sects will send representatives with gifts. We must focus on making the proper arrangements.”

He hesitated for a long moment before finally asking, “Is there… any news of my aunt?”

Li Xuanxuan’s breath caught in his throat. “It’s… hard to say,” he said softly. “Qinghong has been away for too long. Five years ago, the jade talisman lost its spiritual nourishment and went dim. It can no longer show her fortune or peril.”

A calm resolve settled in Li Ximing’s heart. “Once things have stabilized,” he said, reassuring his grandfather, “I will discuss it with Zhouwei. We will assess the situation and decide whether to pay a visit to the dragonkin and ask them about this.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded repeatedly. Just then, a sound came from outside the hall. With a thought from Li Ximing, the heavy doors swung open on their own.

Two figures entered. The young woman wore a light red, cloud-patterned satin dress with a silver necklace. A talisman brush hung from her waist, and the cuffs of her sleeves partially concealed a few sheets of talisman paper. She wore no makeup, her skin fair and her eyes bright with spirit. She smiled, her eyes curving into crescents, and bowed respectfully.

“Junior Li Que’wan pays her respects to the Daoist Master!”

The young man beside her was dressed in a pleated robe of purple and white, its crossed collar and cuffs embroidered with patterns of Li Fire. A white jade pendant with a golden tassel hung from his waist. His gaze was bright, and he carried himself with a bold and refreshing air.

“Li Jiangqian greets the Daoist Master!”

Li Ximing looked up and gestured for them to approach. Li Que’wan, a sixth-level Qi Refining cultivator, seemed a bit shy. Li Jiangqian, who was already at the seventh level, was quicker to speak.

“Ancestor has broken through to the Daoist Master realm! The whole family is celebrating. Seeing the looks on those fools’ faces was so satisfying.”

Li Ximing chuckled. “You two are advancing too quickly,” he advised. “There’s no need to rush your cultivation. Spend more time practicing your arts.”

“This junior understands.”

After bowing, Li Jiangqian smiled. “Before, we didn’t know Ancestor would emerge from seclusion so soon. The family was short on Foundation Establishment cultivators, so I discussed it with Wan-mei. I would push for a breakthrough first to help the family, and she could take her time.

“But now, it seems that’s no longer necessary!”

Li Jiangqian’s words pleased Li Ximing, who nodded in approval. “Your father,” he asked with a curious smile, “how many children does he have now?”

“In the last decade, he has given me four more younger brothers,” Li Jiangqian replied respectfully. “The little ones haven’t been assigned duties in the clan yet, but they are all showing great promise.”

Li Ximing sipped his tea and chatted with them a while longer. Soon, An Siwei descended on the wind before the hall. “Reporting to the Daoist Master,” he said respectfully, “the envoys from the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion have arrived from across the river.”

Li Ximing had been sitting for less than a day, but the Three Sects had acted with impressive speed. “How did they deal with Floating Cloud Cave?” he asked casually.

An Siwei bowed. “The Floating Cloud Cave is in utter chaos. Everyone scattered like birds and beasts. The sect elders and guest elders stormed the main pavilion to divide the treasures. The Cave Master, fearing punishment, took his own life. His body was torn apart by the crowd and vanished in a flash of light, leaving only his head behind.”

“In the midst of the chaos, the other two sects of Xiaoshi Mountain stormed the Floating Cloud Cave. Under the pretext of purging traitors from the Daoist path, they rounded up and imprisoned the remaining cultivators. They took the heads of all involved and brought them here. Zaixingzi’s entire faction has been trampled to dust… not even bones could be found. They gathered all their spiritual items and sent them over as well.”

“The cultivators from the other two sects have already escorted the men from Floating Cloud Cave to the north bank, bringing the heads and spiritual items with them.”

Li Xuanxuan was left speechless by the account. Li Ximing sipped his tea without a word. Only Li Jiangqian, standing to the side, rubbed the jade pendant in his hand and sneered.

“Such a swift response. In the end, only Zaixingzi’s faction and a late-stage Foundation Establishment Cave Master are dead. They’ve certainly adopted a humble posture… rushing to offer their faces to be slapped on the very day our Daoist Master breaks through, not even daring to wait a single night.”

He paused, calculating. “Judging by the timing, the chaos on Xiaoshi Mountain must have begun the moment the Daoist Master revealed himself. Otherwise, it would have taken half a day just for the news to reach them, let alone for them to arrive before nightfall.”

“Someone must be pulling the strings from behind.”

Li Ximing was well aware that it wasn't just the Golden Tang Gate behind the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion. Even the Golden Tang Gate was only targeting his family because there was something in it for them. “Bring the items forward,” he said softly.

An Siwei withdrew and returned a moment later with a row of jade boxes. He opened the largest and most ornate one, revealing the head of an old man, his face a mask of regret, his hair and beard standing on end.

Celestial light shifted from between Li Ximing’s brows, and the spell concealing the head’s true appearance dissipated. It returned to its state at the moment of death. The features were the same, but where was the regret? There was only astonishment and rage.

He lowered his head and sipped his tea. An Siwei confirmed, “This is indeed the man.”

With a gentle wave of his sleeve, blood began to seep from the sealed head. “Que’wan,” he said, “check his bloodline.”

Li Que’wan understood immediately. She placed one hand on the wrist of the other, formed a sign with two fingers, and lifted a drop of blood with her spiritual qi. As she chanted an incantation, a silvery mercurial light shimmered within the blood. “A fish with a red tail,” she murmured. “Its house is destroyed. Its son, a beast that devours its parents. Distant kin.”

She drew a talisman and pressed it to her wrist, dispelling the silvery light. “He had few children, and his parents, both rogue cultivators, died long ago. His eldest son despised him and has just slain his parents, only to be killed by another.”

The shamanistic talisman art she used was quite accurate. Li Ximing nodded. “It seems the chaos was real. There is indeed a Purple Mansion cultivator keeping an eye on Xiaoshi Mountain.”

Whether Li Que’wan’s divination was precise or not, it was certain that a Purple Mansion cultivator was directing events from behind the scenes. Li Ximing dismissed the two juniors and turned to An Siwei. “Have them leave the reparations. The guest elders may all return. The two Cave Masters, however, will come up to see me. I wish to have a long chat with them.”

***

**Azure Pond Sect, Main Hall.**

Dantai Jin, dressed in fine robes, waited before the hall. A moment later, a guard invited him in. He took a few steps, crossing the threshold and ascending the misty white steps into the grand chamber.

Si Yuanli was practicing calligraphy, seemingly in a good mood. Dantai Jin walked up to him, clasped his hands in a salute, and smiled.

“Sect Master!”

“Brother Dantai, you’ve arrived!” Si Yuanli laughed heartily and produced a small letter from his sleeve, handing it to him with an air of self-satisfaction.

Dantai Jin took it and read it closely, his face immediately lighting up with pleasure. The note contained only a few short lines:

*On the twenty-second, Daoist Master Buzi appeared on Lufang Island in the Southern Sea. He was traveling at great speed using a divine power, seemingly in pursuit of a demon. He appeared for only a few breaths to conduct a magical search before vanishing.*

“Chi Buzi has shown himself!” Dantai Jin knew exactly what Si Yuanli meant.

More than a decade had passed since the turmoil in the Azure Pond Sect, and Chi Buzi had shown no reaction, concerning himself only with his own affairs. The message was clear: he couldn’t care less. If he had possessed even the slightest concern, he wouldn’t have needed to return to the sect; even a single word would have prevented the tragedy of the past.

Dantai Jin’s smile faded, and he lowered his gaze. In a voice barely above a whisper, he asked, “Daoist Master… could it be that he holds a grudge against a certain someone?”

A man of Si Yuanli’s caliber understood immediately. A flicker of fear crossed his heart as his expression grew hesitant. He knew exactly who Dantai Jin was referring to.

‘Lushui!’

“Who can say?” Si Yuanli’s face remained dark and uncertain. “Perhaps he holds a grudge against Chi Wei. The man is resolute in his pursuit of the Dao and is a master of deception. When Chi Wei was alive, you couldn’t see his true nature at all. The moment Chi Wei died, he was like a different person.”

He kept his next thought to himself.

‘Even if he does hold a grudge against Lushui, so what? Ning Tiaoxiao’s resentment was so deep he gave up cultivating his divine power, but what did it accomplish? He only hated himself to death.’

Chi Buzi was a clever man. Si Yuanli didn’t believe he would make such a mistake. At most, he simply wanted to leave the Azure Pond Sect behind.

‘My only worry is what will happen after the old ancestor passes…’

Si Boxiu was a master of talisman arts and possessed several excellent legacies, but time was running out. Si Yuanli was waiting for a Moon Radiance Glazed Fruit to enter seclusion himself.

He stared at the painting on his desk for a moment, then lifted his brush to inscribe it.

Suddenly, Dantai Jin cocked his head as if listening. Si Yuanli paused, his own ears twitching. A vast, resonant voice was passing through the Great Void, echoing through the hall.

“I, Zhaojing, Li Ximing of the Moongaze Li clan, have this day achieved the Bright Yang divine power! I hereby proclaim my clan an Immortal Clan of the Purple Mansion Realm. In three months, a celebratory rite will be held. All fellow Daoists are welcome to attend!”

“Zhaojing, Li Ximing of the Moongaze Li clan…”

Si Yuanli’s hand froze mid-stroke. The half-written character stopped abruptly, leaving a large blot of ink on the painting that spread like a stain, utterly ruining the masterpiece.

*Crack.*

The expensive white-bristle jade brush in his hand shattered. Fine jade powder trickled through his fingers, dusting the painting below. It settled over the face of the old flood dragon at the center of the work, obscuring its eyes in shadow.

“How is this possible…”

Si Yuanli’s composure, cultivated over years, instantly broke. His brow furrowed, his eyes glazed over with shock as he met Dantai Jin’s equally incredulous gaze.

‘A Purple Mansion cultivator in just over a decade?! Li Ximing?’

Dantai Jin looked up, his shock quickly morphing into a grim expression of regret. “I fear we’ve fallen into a trap,” he said in a low voice. “Not just you and I, Sect Master, but likely more than ninety percent of the Purple Mansion cultivators in Jiangnan… We all underestimated him.”

Si Yuanli’s mental fortitude was extraordinary. He took a slow breath, then waved his hand decisively.

“Say no more! Go and visit Li Xizhi at once!”



# Chapter 693: Martial Brothers

Si Yuanli strode down from the main seat. With a flicker of his spiritual qi, the painting he had been working on ignited, the fine paper curling into a ball of crimson flame on the jade desk before collapsing into a pile of black ash. Dantai Jin dared not look, following closely behind him.

"Xiao Chuting?" he asked, his voice low and urgent.

"He must have had a hand in this!" Si Yuanli replied under his breath. Though his face was a mask of calm, the wide, hurried strides betrayed the turmoil within. "At first, I thought Xiao Yuansi acted alone, taking advantage of the old man's absence in the Northern Sea and a push from other factions to force the pill refinement... but now, it's clear. Xiao Chuting even used his own descendant as a pawn! The 'Man on Creek' of Pit Water... he truly lives up to his name."

"For the past century, since reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, Xiao Chuting has been infallible, maneuvering between the Azure Pond and Golden Feather Sects until he became one of the most formidable figures of his generation... I never should have assumed he had miscalculated!"

Dantai Jin murmured, "Could it be... that Li Ximing is the most cunning of the four 'Xi' siblings? That he's been playing the fool all this time?"

Si Yuanli considered this for a moment. He gathered the hem of his robes and rose into the air on a gust of wind. "Unlikely," he said, shaking his head. "There are no secrets from those with fate-seeing divine powers. Besides, the heavens wouldn't be so generous. Li Xizhi and Li Xijun were already exceptional talents, and I hear Li Xicheng was also a man who gives his all. How could there be yet another in Li Ximing?"

"Xiao Chuting was certainly involved in the planning, but there's something else strange about this. Either there's a problem with Li Ximing's celestial phenomenon, or there's a problem with the man himself. When the Daoist Master returns, I will ask for his guidance."

He flew with Dantai Jin toward the Heaven-Probing Pavilion. As the immortal structure slowly came into view, Si Yuanli composed himself, a brilliant smile spreading across his face.

'Fortunately, I've always been careful to maintain appearances,' he thought. 'My attitude now won't seem out of place. If I hadn't laid the groundwork, rushing over like this would appear far too eager and opportunistic.'

***

“I, Zhaojing, Li Ximing of the Moongaze Li clan, have this day achieved the Bright Yang divine power..."

The resonant voice pierced through the Great Void, brushing against the Azure Pond Sect's Heavenly Origin Dao Spiritual Formation. The array, sensing only sound and no hostile power, merely shimmered once before letting the announcement pass.

The voice swept through the entire Azure Pond mountain range, echoing and lingering until it reached the pavilion perched high above the clouds.

*Clink... clank...*

The jade talismans hanging in the pavilion chimed, stirred by the sound waves. On the top floor, a middle-aged man in feathered robes looked up, staring blankly at the clouds.

Behind him stood a man in black, his face grim. Shadowy, serpent-like tails writhed beneath his robes. He, too, was frozen in place, his expression one of utter disbelief.

"Ximing?"

Li Xizhi listened to the announcement repeat several times. His eyebrows shot up, a shocked, almost dreamlike smile gracing his lips. He paced the floor of the pavilion, the world so quiet he could hear the crisp, clear chimes of the jade talismans.

"Ximing... Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing?!"

He murmured the name, a flush rising to his cheeks. It all felt so unreal. "I was still scheming how to protect Zhouwei," he chuckled, "and my brother has already reached the Purple Mansion Realm..."

Li Wushao, standing beside him, looked even more incredulous.

'Damn it all... am I now the spirit beast of a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan?'

A wave of exhilaration washed over Li Xizhi. He laughed, a rare loss of composure, his steps light as he pushed open the pavilion window. In the distance, several streaks of light were speeding toward them.

As the voice spread across the better part of Yue State, Li Xizhi felt a mysterious warmth rise in his sea of qi. The tri-colored talismanic energy of his Rainbow Pierce Skyway technique grew brighter, shining with a newfound brilliance.

"My Rainbow Pierce Skyway has advanced to the next level!"

Li Xizhi paused, then understood immediately. The power of Rainbow Pierce Skyway was tied to his status. With the news of his brother's breakthrough, his own standing as one of the three 'Xi' of the Li clan had soared. The change was palpable!

"It seems I've benefited as well!"

He smiled as he watched the approaching lights. A sharp knock came at the pavilion door, and a youth hurried in. He wore an exquisite jade crown and silver-white robes, a magnificent red brocade cloak draped over his shoulders. He bowed with a jubilant air.

"Congratulations, Master! A joyous occasion! Daoist Master Zhaojing has forged his divine power!"

After a flurry of congratulations, he finally turned to Li Wushao with a smile. "Greetings, Guardian!"

Li Wushao had been cultivating alongside Li Xizhi, while the more powerful Li Qiyun had been dispatched to guard the spirit jade mine in the Helin Mountains.

Li Wushao returned the greeting. Behind the first youth stood another, a head taller and powerfully built, a bow slung across his back. His expression was serious, but his eyes shone with joy.

Li Xizhi, who always prized composure, couldn't help but laugh aloud at such wonderful news. His face was alight with excitement as he stroked his beard. "Duan'er, quickly, open the side gates of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion. You stand at the main gate to receive our guests. Have Junwei wait at the secondary gate."

He quickly regained his poise, though his eyes still danced with amusement. "The Sect Master is coming. See that you don't neglect him."

The youth in red and white was his eldest disciple, Quan Yuduan, a relative of the late Quan Yi. The powerfully built young man behind him was his second disciple, Zhao Junwei.

After Tuoba Chongyuan killed Quan Yi, only his elderly mother was left. Li Xizhi had cared for her until she passed away a few years prior. Unwilling to see the Quan line fade, the old woman had written several letters to relatives outside the sect. To honor her wishes, Li Xizhi found Quan Yuduan among some distant kin who had been reduced to country squires and brought him into the sect.

A year later, while inspecting the family's spirit jade vein in the Helin Mountains, Li Xizhi took Zhao Junwei, the son of a local hunter, as his second disciple. More than a decade had passed since then.

"As you command, Master!" Quan Yuduan replied, turning to leave with a spring in his step. The boy was ecstatic, and even Zhao Junwei, who had only been cultivating for ten years, understood the significance of the Purple Mansion Realm. The two of them were clearly overjoyed, and laughter filled the pavilion.

Li Xizhi smiled softly.

In his earlier, more precarious years, he hadn't dared to grow too close to the major families. Thus, both his disciples came from humble backgrounds. Quan Yuduan could at least be considered the son of a wealthy family whose ancestors had been cultivators, and he possessed decent talent. Zhao Junwei, however, was a true commoner with mediocre aptitude. Fortunately, both were diligent, and Zhao Junwei's character was particularly outstanding.

'Si Yuanli is here...'

He gently tapped the jade window, watching the two familiar streaks of light arrive. He turned and walked out of the pavilion just in time to see Si Yuanli approaching with a look of utter delight.

"A truly joyous occasion!" Si Yuanli boomed. "Daoist Master Zhaojing's success is an inspiration to us all! For your esteemed family to become an Immortal Clan is the greatest news this century has seen!"

Li Xizhi responded politely, his gaze drifting past Si Yuanli to the smiling man behind him.

'Dantai Jin!'

He was no stranger to the man, who had joined the sect a decade ago. Rumor had it he was the prized disciple of an overseas Purple Mansion cultivator, one who had been aided by Daoist Master Yuanxiu, Si Boxiu, in the past. With Si Boxiu's lifespan dwindling, this was clearly one of the arrangements he had made for the future.

After exchanging pleasantries, Si Yuanli smiled. "I've sent someone to the Southern Borderlands to summon Yuanqin. He will be overjoyed to hear of your family's great fortune!"

'Yuanqin...'

Li Xizhi hadn't seen Li Yuanqin much in recent years. After his Foundation Establishment, he had taken the Ning family to guard the Southern Borderlands. Perhaps because of his sensitive position, he rarely contacted Li Xizhi.

Just then, another figure approached the pavilion. He wore vine armor, a gourd tied to his waist, and carried a commanding presence. It was Lingu Rao, the "Scorpion Child," who had once been as famous as Li Xuanfeng.

The middle-aged man clasped his hands and smiled. "Congratulations, Pavilion Master!"

The three families were still, overtly and covertly, on friendly terms. Si Yuanli also greeted Lingu Rao as a senior. The atmosphere was warm and lively, with smiles on every face.

After offering their congratulations, the visitors from the other families departed. For the rest of the day, a steady stream of guests arrived at the pavilion. Li Xizhi greeted them all, and it wasn't until sunset that he finally had a moment to himself.

"Yuduan," he said softly, "have they all been seen off?"

Quan Yuduan bowed. "There is one person still downstairs, Master. He's been pacing back and forth for a long time, too afraid to come up."

"Oh?" Li Xizhi knew exactly who it was. "And who might that be?"

"The Qingsui Peak Master!" Quan Yuduan replied with a cold smile.

He was no pampered fool. Life as a country squire was full of its own petty squabbles, and his childhood had not been without hardship. How could he not know about the feud between his master and the Qingsui Peak Master, Yuan Chengzhao?

While Yuan Chengzhao had been stewing below, Quan Yuduan had greeted the other guests with a warm smile but had not spared him a single glance. If not for Yuan Chengzhao's status as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he wouldn't have even shown him that much courtesy.

Li Xizhi shook his head. "He is your martial uncle, after all. Go and invite him up."

Quan Yuduan complied and went downstairs. A moment later, the deep, polite voice of his second disciple, Zhao Junwei, could be heard.

"Martial Uncle... please!"

Quan Yuduan, who wore his heart on his sleeve, clearly had no desire to bow to Yuan Chengzhao and had passed the task to the more diplomatic Zhao Junwei. Li Xizhi heard his junior martial brother's sigh, then the sound of him straightening his robes before the door creaked open.

"Chengzhao pays his respects to Senior Brother!"

Yuan Chengzhao didn't dare to look at him, dropping to his knees.

Li Xizhi stood bathed in the golden light of the setting sun, hesitating.

Yuan Chengzhao had always feared him. Their own master, Yuan Tuan, was perpetually absent, so Li Xizhi had always filled the role of the stern elder. To Yuan Chengzhao, he was less a senior brother and more a master.

But human nature is a tangled thing. Despite his fear, Yuan Chengzhao had repeatedly bowed to the Chi clan and placed obstacles in Li Xizhi's path. When Chi Buhua had tracked him down, he had used one of Li Xizhi's old personal items—an item that Li Xizhi was certain had come from his junior brother.

The irony was that after the Chi clan fell and the Si family began their purge, his terrified junior brother's first act was not to come to him, but to run to Si Yuanli. He had knelt, clutched Si Yuanli's leg, and begged him not to reveal that Chi Buhua had gotten the item from him, fearing Li Xizhi's wrath.

'To be so utterly lost! Why would Si Yuanli ever hide such a thing for me? He'd be delighted to see us at each other's throats!'

Li Xizhi's gaze was filled with disappointment. He had watched this boy grow up on the mountain and truly felt a mentor's affection for him. He knew Yuan Chengzhao was weak, but he never imagined he could be so utterly clueless.

Kneeling on the floor, the Foundation Establishment cultivator was already drenched in a cold sweat.

"It has been many years," Li Xizhi said softly. "It seems your misfortune has become your fortune."

Yuan Chengzhao knew exactly what he meant, and the hair on his neck stood on end. In recent years, Si Yuanli had not been stingy with his gifts. Yuan Chengzhao's own talent wasn't poor, but he had relied on the Si family's resources to reach Foundation Establishment. Si Yuanli, all smiles on the surface, had never missed an opportunity to prop up a member of the Yuan family who held a grudge against Li Xizhi.

"Senior Brother... I was wrong," he pleaded, his voice choked with grief. "I was forced... Both Chi Zhiyun and Chi Zhiyan, and later Chi Fubo and Chi Buhua... and now the Sect Master... I couldn't afford to offend any of them! Chi Buhua was at the peak of Foundation Establishment, and I was just a lowly Qi Refining cultivator. When he asked for the item, how... how could I refuse!"

He began to weep, his head striking the floor with dull thuds. Li Xizhi looked away, gazing at the distant sunset.

"You set foot on a path of no return long ago," he said quietly. "The moment you coveted power and accepted the position of Qingsui Peak Master, you became the Chi clan's pawn. You were a piece meant to counterbalance me, and no matter who held power, they would never let that piece go."

"If, on that day, you had been able to quiet your heart and refuse the temptation of power, if you had taken a mission to leave the sect and distance yourself from the Azure Pond... would you be in this position today?"

Yuan Chengzhao could only sob and knock his head against the floor. "You're right, Senior Brother! You're right! I was blinded..."

"You need not say such things," Li Xizhi said. "In truth, no one could have predicted today. I should have died in the Eastern Sea long ago, and your Yuan family would have rightfully reclaimed this immortal peak. A perfect ending."

"But the world is full of surprises. If not for Daoist Master Zhaojing's breakthrough, you would still be reaping benefits from every side."

Yuan Chengzhao choked on his sobs, unable to speak.

Li Xizhi lowered his gaze, a trace of sorrow in his heart, but his face remained calm. "There is no need for tears. Go back to where you came from. For our master's sake, all that has passed is forgiven. Do not seek me out again."

He raised his teacup. "Junwei, see our guest out!" he called.

Yuan Chengzhao was aghast. Zhao Junwei stepped forward, but his Qi Refining cultivation was not enough to move the kneeling man.

"I acted foolishly and harmed you, Senior Brother," Yuan Chengzhao cried. "I have no face to return. I will remember your years of guidance for the rest of my life..."

"Be well, Senior Brother... I must protect my clan in this life and cannot serve you. Your kindness... I will repay it in the next..."

He struggled to his feet, his face streaked with tears. "I still wish we could ride the winds together as we once did, soaring across the prefectures, chasing the Dawn Rayfish, and listening to your teachings..."

"But now... that is no longer possible..."

He bowed and backed out of the room. Li Xizhi remained silent. Zhao Junwei escorted him all the way out.

Quan Yuduan, however, simply pursed his lips. He walked briskly to Li Xizhi's side and bowed. "Master, on this joyous occasion, should we make plans to return to the lake?"

Li Xizhi's voice was gentle. "We should. The Azure Pond Sect will also be sending a delegation to offer congratulations. We will travel with them."



# Chapter 694: The Background of the Three Sects

A golden light shimmered across the surface of Moongaze Lake. Inside the main hall on the island, two Daoists stood in uneasy silence. An entire row of jade boxes sat on a nearby table, completely ignored. To the side, a young woman in a red dress sipped her tea, her eyes crinkling into a smile.

"Miss Minggong..."

One of the Daoists, a man built like a small mountain with black tattoos etched across his face and a tiger-striped robe, stood with his head bowed respectfully. Despite being a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, his voice was meek.

"Miss... is there any word from the Daoist Master?"

This man was Daoist Wenhu, the master of Dense Cloud Cave, one of the three sects of the Secret Diffusion region. He had established his foundation in the Southern Sea. Just a day ago, his forces were constantly harassing the shores guarded by Li Minggong, and getting an audience with him would have been an impossible dream. Now, the tables had turned completely.

Seeing his subservience, Li Minggong didn't put on any airs. "Please wait for the report from my clan's cultivators," she said softly.

The other Daoist was weaker, only at the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He had an unremarkable face and an average build, and he kept his spiritual aura tightly suppressed, not daring to let any of it leak out. This was Pingwang Zi, the master of Brahma Cloud Cave and the only true immortal cultivator among the three cave masters. Perhaps because Brahma Cloud Cave was the weakest of the three, it had always been the quietest.

Although he was an immortal cultivator, the way he kept his aura locked down suggested he was no stranger to using arts fueled by blood and qi. Now, he was too afraid to even speak.

The two men exchanged a look, then grabbed the jade boxes and tried to press them into Li Minggong's hands. Daoist Wenhu, despite his brutish appearance, spoke with surprising finesse. "Miss Minggong," he said with a fawning smile, "we had hoped our friend An Siwei might put in a good word for us, but he is a man of uncompromising integrity and scorns such humble offerings... Perhaps you might take a look..."

Li Minggong had just fought the men from Dense Cloud Cave a few days ago; she had no intention of accepting his gifts. "Take them back," she said politely. "I have no influence with the Patriarch. You'll have to give them to An Siwei."

The three sects of Secret Diffusion had once been on equal footing with the Li clan, but they were powerless before a Purple Mansion cultivator. Floating Cloud Cave had already been destroyed, and the two remaining cave masters felt as if they were sitting on pins and needles. Finally, they saw An Siwei descending from the clouds.

They scrambled to greet him, showering him with every flattering word they could think of, but An Siwei ignored them completely. They could only look pleadingly at Li Minggong. The woman in red glanced at the table. Taking the hint, the two men quickly mixed their gifts in with the pile of confiscated spiritual items.

An Siwei had personally witnessed the arrogance of the three sects before Li Ximing emerged from his seclusion. Though his anger had subsided, he was still far from cordial. "Masters," he said in a low, formal tone, "if you please."

Steeling themselves, the two men followed him into the air. The sky was beginning to darken. As Daoist Wenhu walked with his head bowed through the long corridors of the palace, his heart grew heavy.

'I wonder what kind of divine power this Daoist Master has cultivated. Is it a life divine ability? If it is, this will be very difficult to handle...'

Whatever dismissiveness he had once felt toward Li Ximing had vanished. In the presence of a true Daoist Master, even thinking a disrespectful thought was dangerous. The best course of action was to not think at all. He quickly suppressed the notion.

After a short walk, he entered the main hall. A cultivator in a white and gold robe stood at the head of the room, his profile turned toward them. A blinding Heavenly Radiance seemed to pulse from between his brows, but otherwise, his features were not particularly remarkable.

"This humble cultivator, Wenhu, pays his respects to the Daoist Master! Congratulations on achieving your great divine power!"

"This humble cultivator, Pingwang, pays his respects! Congratulations, Daoist Master!"

The two men bowed low in unison. They felt a sudden heat on the crowns of their heads and knew the Daoist Master's gaze had fallen upon them.

Li Ximing gave them a brief glance. The Heavenly Radiance between his brows had already seen through them. Daoist Wenhu's foundation was of the Xiukui lineage, a type known as Hurricane Ghost Yin. Pingwang Zi's immortal foundation, however, was peculiar; he had never seen it before, though it might belong to the Ancient Merging Dao Lineage.

'Wenhu has some strength, but his Hurricane Ghost Yin is countered by my own arts. I could have suppressed him even before I reached the Purple Mansion Realm. As for Pingwang Zi, his foundation doesn't seem suited for combat. He's not worth mentioning.'

The two of them together couldn't even defeat his brother, Li Xizhi. It was no wonder they had spent the last decade dithering, resorting to a slow war of attrition.

The two masters didn't dare look up. Li Ximing sipped his tea and spoke softly, "State your origins."

Although the three sects of Secret Diffusion had colluded with the Golden Tang Gate, Li Ximing knew other Purple Mansion cultivators had to be pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The Golden Tang Gate was just the pawn on the board.

Now came the moment where they had to reveal their backers to save their lives. Daoist Wenhu didn't dare hesitate. The hulking man was the first to cup his hands.

"My given name is Shi Wenya," he said respectfully. "I was originally a cultivator from Mount Xiaoshi. I later received guidance from Lord Chidu of the White Ye Immortal Sect and traveled to the Southern Sea to cultivate. There, I established my foundation and slowly made a name for myself. I heard from Lord Chidu that Jiangbei was a stable region with fertile spiritual lands, so I came here to settle down."

He kept his head bowed, having revealed everything down to his real name. The White Ye Immortal Sect he mentioned was one of the two new Purple Mansion sects established in Jiangbei a decade ago. Li Ximing rested a hand on the table and nodded.

"So, White Ye Immortal Sect. My family has no grievances with your esteemed Dao. Now that things have come to this, did Chidu have any message for me?"

"Yes, yes, he did," Wenhu said quickly. "The master said that he will come personally to offer his apologies to you in three months."

Li Ximing's expression remained neutral. It was clear that this Chidu from the White Ye Immortal Sect lacked sincerity. But as a rogue cultivator from the Eastern Sea who had mastered three divine powers, he certainly had the capital to be arrogant.

He turned his gaze to Pingwang Zi, who immediately forced a placating smile. "Daoist Master, as you can clearly see, Brahma Cloud Cave rarely involved itself in the affairs concerning your esteemed clan. At most, we were coerced by the other two sects under the pretense of unity. Only then did Brahma Cloud Cave have no choice but to send men..."

Li Ximing had already heard from An Siwei that Brahma Cloud Cave was indeed less active, but ninety percent of the reason was their own lack of strength and manpower. "I asked for your origin," he said softly.

The simple sentence sent a cold sweat beading on Pingwang Zi's nose. He didn't dare blink. "My... my given name is Wang Jun," he stammered. "I am a cultivator from Brahma Cloud Cave on Mount Xiaoshi. In my early years, I was fortunate enough to receive the patronage of Lord Zhong Qian, which allowed me to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. I followed him to Jiangbei."

"Later, under his instruction, I returned to Mount Xiaoshi to revive the Brahma Cloud Cave lineage and operate in Jiangbei under the Three Sects Agreement..."

Li Ximing's expression softened slightly. "So you are from the Chengyun Immortal Gate," he said quietly. "Sect Master Zhong Qian has had some dealings with my family."

He set down his teacup. "And what of Floating Cloud Cave?"

Pingwang Zi eagerly chimed in. "Floating Cloud Cave's territory is the southernmost, and they were always the ones stirring up trouble. Their backer was indeed the Golden Tang Gate. You can rest assured of that, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing fell silent, pondering the situation.

The picture was now clear. The Chengyun Immortal Gate had been founded by Daoist Master Changyun and a group of demonic cultivators. They were the weakest of the major powers in the region and had some connection to his own clan. It was only natural that Brahma Cloud Cave, with its limited resources, would be reluctant to stir up conflict.

The Golden Tang Gate, however, still had some power. They had colluded with Floating Cloud Cave, which bordered the Li clan's territory, and had repeatedly caused trouble. As for Dense Cloud Cave's backer, the White Ye Immortal Sect, they were clearly no friends to the Li clan either. In fact, they might pose an even greater threat.

Seeing Li Ximing's silence, Daoist Wenhu chimed in obsequiously, "Daoist Master, most of the cultivators from Floating Cloud Cave have been captured by your men! They are all weeping with remorse, swearing they would die to prove their loyalty to you... Please, investigate the matter yourself!"



# Chapter 695: The White Qilin's Gift

Li Ximing knew that the cultivators of Floating Cloud Cave were terrified and desperate to serve him. His clan had a sterling reputation, after all. He was reminded of Fei Luoya from Mount Wu, who had lingered by the lake for decades, hoping for a chance to serve a Purple Mansion cultivator. It was the same principle at play now.

But just because they wanted to pledge fealty didn't mean Li Ximing was inclined to accept. Taking in cultivators of unknown origin without a Life Divine Ability to see through them was asking for trouble; it would almost certainly lead to disaster down the line.

He didn't want the men, but the land they occupied in Jiangbei was prime territory. "What is the status of Floating Cloud Cave's territory?" he asked.

Pingwang Zi hurriedly replied, "It has all been seized and secured, awaiting your command, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing sipped his tea in silence.

In truth, he had heard of Mount Xiaoshi long ago. The Li clan had secret records mentioning it, records that predated the establishment of the three sects. During the great war in Jiangbei, a master monk of the Way of Emptiness had arrived on the wind and landed on Mount Xiaoshi, causing the various Dao lineages there to scatter in terror. One of them, a Daoist Fuyuan, had fled all the way to the lake.

The Daoist had been grievously injured by the master monk and died shortly after. But in his dying pleas, he had revealed a great deal of information, which Li Xuanxuan had later recounted to Li Ximing in detail.

A cultivator from Floating Cloud Cave on Mount Xiaoshi had once come to the lake's shore and been slain by Lord Xiangping, who wielded a powerful mirror. From the man’s body, they had recovered a jade pendant. That very pendant was a component needed to repair the Immortal Mirror—a piece of the same quality as the one Yu Muxian had once possessed.

It was because of this component that Li Ximing was so fixated on the name Mount Xiaoshi, and it was why he had personally summoned the two cave masters for questioning.

'What a coincidence,' he thought, 'that the White Ye Immortal Sect, the Chengyun Gate, and the Golden Tang Gate all chose cultivators from Mount Xiaoshi as their proxies in Jiangbei. Surely that isn't by chance.'

Li Ximing was already deeply suspicious of Mount Xiaoshi. The fact that all three Secret Diffusion sects hailed from its Dao lineages only confirmed his belief that something was amiss.

'Finding the other components would be ideal, but even a clue would be a start. Besides, several Purple Mansion cultivators are playing this game in Jiangbei with pieces from Mount Xiaoshi. There must be something valuable at stake.'

'And even if none of that were true, Floating Cloud Cave is located right across the river from the northern shore of Moongaze Lake. It's practically on my doorstep. I cannot allow another power to remain there.'

He took a sip of tea, waved his hand, and said, "Very well. We'll leave this matter for now."

The two men departed as if they had received a royal pardon. Li Ximing hesitated for a moment in the hall, then drew a jade slip from his sleeve. In a small corner, the words *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light* were carved.

He rubbed the jade slip for a moment, his brow slowly furrowing.

'Zhouwei is still in Jiangbei... I hope nothing's happened to him. This isn't the time to be studying cultivation arts. I need to make a trip to Jiangbei first.'

***

Meanwhile, the two Daoists left the hall and flew out of Moongaze Lake toward their own territories, both feeling as if they had been given a new lease on life. Pingwang Zi was relieved, but Daoist Wenhu felt as if a mountain had been lifted from his shoulders, and he was overcome with emotion.

Although both were pawns of Purple Mansion powers, they had run afoul of Li Ximing. If he had killed them, it would have been justified. Their backers might have been displeased and lost face, but they couldn't have raised any real objections.

Pingwang Zi spoke softly, his voice laced with meaning, "Whether this is a big deal or a small one is entirely up to the Daoist Master's whim. He said he's leaving the matter for *now*... but he didn't say he's dropping it forever. You'd best be careful from now on, elder brother."

Pingwang Zi could say this because the Chengyun Gate behind him had some prior dealings with the Li clan. The same couldn't be said for the White Ye Immortal Sect. It was hard to say what their Daoist Master thought, and Daoist Wenhu's path forward looked treacherous.

Daoist Wenhu clearly understood this. The joy vanished from his face, replaced by a look of confusion. He replied in a low voice, "I can't afford to offend either side. It's like walking a tightrope. I'm caught in the middle, and it's not something I can control."

Pingwang Zi, thoroughly enjoying the drama, found Wenhu's predicament amusing. He cut to the heart of the matter. "Are you tired of living? A bird seeks a forest, a man seeks a master. You don't have the luxury of playing both sides."

Daoist Wenhu was speechless. If he had to compare them, the master of the White Ye Immortal Sect was far more difficult to deal with. Li Ximing, on the other hand, had just reached the Purple Mansion Realm and seemed to conduct himself with more righteousness. He didn't yet view Foundation Establishment cultivators as mere blades of grass. Wenhu sighed with a hint of resignation.

"Sigh... Just you wait. Only when you've truly offended someone of their stature will you understand what it's like."

He saw they were approaching his territory and fell silent, letting out another sigh, which greatly pleased Pingwang Zi.

***

In Jiangbei.

Night had fallen over the territory of Floating Cloud Cave. A shadow flitted through the mountain forest. Shrouded by overlapping layers of cloud-like gauze, an old man with a goatee flew close to the ground, glancing around cautiously.

"Li Ximing... a Purple Mansion cultivator... It's preposterous!"

A look of disbelief was still etched on his face. But the facts were the facts: the master of Floating Cloud Cave was dead. The man, Situ Ku, had relied on a magical artifact to sneak away, and he didn't dare take a single unnecessary step.

Floating Cloud Cave had close ties with the Golden Tang Gate. Its master, Fudou, had been backed by them, and Situ Ku was naturally stationed there as the Golden Tang Gate's representative. Now, his face was a mask of bitterness.

'At least I never showed my face...'

Situ Ku knew that Wenhu and Pingwang Zi wouldn't want to offend the Golden Tang Gate, so they wouldn't go out of their way to hunt him down. Their best course of action was to pretend they hadn't seen him, which was how he had managed to escape.

'A pity... I doubt I'll get such a lucrative assignment again.'

Situ Ku traveled for a while before emerging from the woods. Before his eyes could even focus, his spiritual sense flared. He detected a young man in white and gold armor sitting beneath a pine tree on a distant mountaintop.

From a distance, the young man sat cross-legged with his eyes closed. A great halberd with a bright gold, crescent-shaped blade was planted in the ground beside him. His hands rested on his knees in a meditative seal, perfectly still.

Situ Ku froze. The young man's eyes snapped open. Golden pupils pierced the darkness, locking onto Situ Ku. The uniquely shaped halberd beside him began to vibrate softly.

"Senior Situ, I have been waiting for you."

A chill shot through Situ Ku's heart, and his mind reeled.

'Li Zhouwei! Wasn't he supposed to be in the Eastern Sea fighting demons?!'

The next moment, the great halberd swept toward him. Before its brilliant light even reached him, Situ Ku broke out in a cold sweat. Terrified, he activated several talismans on his chest, conjuring a tortoise shell shield in front of him and spitting a mouthful of blood essence onto it.

*Pfft!*

*BOOM.*

But Li Zhouwei's halberd slammed into the ground in front of him, sending stone chips flying. The tortoise shell missed its mark. Situ Ku saw that Li Zhouwei was now forming a seal, a wisp of Li Fire dancing in his hand.

'Sun's Resonant Parting Art!'

The only sixth-grade art in the Li clan's possession was the Great Parting's White Brilliance, but it required a Purple Mansion-level spiritual fire to cultivate, which the clan lacked. Therefore, Li Zhouwei had cultivated the fifth-grade Sun's Resonant Parting Art instead. The art was powerful and, more importantly, versatile. A fifth-grade art was considered a trump card even for the direct lineage of the Azure Pond Sect. Li Zhouwei had cultivated it for over a decade and had relied on it to escape dangerous situations many times.

In an instant, a brilliant white light rose before him, rippling like water before shifting to an apricot hue. The tortoise shell was knocked aside and trapped, struggling within the raging flames.

*Bang!*

Li Zhouwei's hand pressed against the protective barrier of light from the talismans. The entire barrier immediately burst into Li Fire. The scorching flames seared Situ Ku's vision. He broke out in another cold sweat, having just finished forming a seal for his own art.

*BOOM!*

Situ Ku knew exactly who he was facing. When Li Zhouwei had just reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, protected by his treasure armor, even Daoist Fudou himself had only managed to injure him before he escaped. Situ Ku's cultivation level was similar to this Li clan's White Qilin, but he was inferior in every way—arts, techniques, and artifacts. What was the point of fighting?

He made a split-second decision. The black, mist-like gauze artifact exploded, shattering with a deafening roar. A thick gray light erupted as the power of the Xiukui lineage surged, forming a massive mountain of shadow that came crashing down.

Situ Ku knew he only had one chance to escape. He poured out all his spiritual qi, mixed with his own blood essence, igniting a powerful flame beneath his feet that launched him into the sky like a bird, speeding away.

Li Zhouwei remained silent. He swung his inverted halberd, and from the crescent blade, streams of illusory Bright Yang light shot out, slowing the descent of the shadow mountain. Then, a small banner flew from his sleeve.

The Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner.

"By the Heavenly Form, I invoke the Yang-Li flame of judgment!"

Five colors of Li Fire—ochre, pale yellow, goose yellow, bright red, and vermilion—leapt up to hold back the black mountain. The halberd thrust forward again, like a pillar supporting the heavens, propping up the massive shadow.

But this power came from a self-destructed artifact. Situ Ku had already fled a full li. A chase would invite unforeseen complications. Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes, calculated the distance, and chanted coldly, "Light illuminates the eight directions! All kings bow before me! Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light... Manifest!"

A point of bright light emerged from between his eyebrows. The entire forest flashed brilliantly, illuminating everything before plunging back into darkness. In the distance, caught in the heavenly light, Situ Ku fell from the sky like a bird with a broken wing.

The old man, focused solely on fleeing, had offered no resistance. His lower body had been pierced through. The searing heavenly light pulsed in his wound, then rippled outward, transforming into two soldiers in silver scale armor. The faceless soldiers each took one of his arms and flew back with him.

In no more than ten moves, the nearly dead Situ Ku was dragged before him. The mountain-sized black light had been burned down to the size of a writing desk.

Of course, the old man's single-minded focus on escape played a part, as did the power of Li Zhouwei's arts and artifacts. Still, it was a testament to his strength, which now rivaled that of Tuoba Chongyuan in his prime.

After staunching Situ Ku's bleeding, Li Zhouwei sensed something and his eyes narrowed sharply.

'A Purple Mansion cultivator?'

The Great Void rippled before him, revealing a man in a white and gold Daoist robe. He was beaming, his voice filled with pleasant surprise.

"My dear White Qilin is truly formidable!"

Seeing it was Li Ximing, Li Zhouwei let out a breath of relief. He clasped his fist in salute and laughed heartily. "Greetings, Daoist Master! Since you have made your breakthrough, I couldn't possibly return empty-handed. So... I've captured a man from the Golden Tang Gate as a congratulatory gift."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing gave him a look full of praise. Only then did he realize the man on the ground was from the Situ family. Li Zhouwei's eyes flickered as he said in a low voice, "This is Situ Ku, also an elder of Floating Cloud Cave. Wenhu and Pingwang Zi let him escape. I was half a day late, so I've been waiting for him."

Li Ximing understood immediately. His gaze on the captive grew intense. This wasn't just a guest elder; he was valuable leverage. He smiled. "A fine... a fine gift indeed!"

He flicked his finger, and a beam of bright light shot out to bind Situ Ku. Then he took Li Zhouwei's hand, looking him over, and sighed with feeling. "I've reached the Purple Mansion Realm, and you are safe and sound. Nothing is more important than this."

Li Minggong and the others hadn't gone into detail, but Li Ximing knew how difficult the past decade had been for Li Zhouwei, navigating the four territories. He had likely needed a great deal of help, and now he was forced to fake a trip to the Eastern Sea just to return in secret.

Li Zhouwei just smiled. Li Ximing glanced at the sky, then pulled him into the Great Void, and they vanished. A dozen breaths later, the sky rapidly brightened.

***

An Siwei escorted the two cave masters into the hall and returned quickly to find a young man wandering around. Li Minggong stood to the side. The spiritual items that had been on the table were gone.

An Siwei bowed his head and clasped his hands respectfully. "Second Young Master!"

"Lord An..."

The young man had a clean-cut appearance and was dressed smartly. He was otherwise unremarkable, save for the golden eyes that met An Siwei's gaze. He smiled as he responded. This was Li Jianglong, Li Zhouwei's third son.

The four brothers born after Li Jianglong were not named according to the traditions of the Li clan's Second Branch. No one dared to ask why, and no one mentioned it. Li Jianglong was now eighteen or nineteen, but his cultivation was not as advanced as his older brother's; he was still only at the Qi Refining stage.

He blinked slightly and smiled. "I heard from Lord An what happened. With such wonderful news, when will Father return?"

"It should be very soon," Li Minggong replied.

Li Jianglong shook his head and said, "That Daoist Wenhu really doesn't know how to give a gift. He's probably never been so aggrieved. The item was a medicinal herb that looked like it had been stored for a long time. It was mixed in with the other confiscated spiritual items and sent to the clan's treasury."

An Siwei nodded. "I understand."

Li Minggong watched Li Jianglong with a smile. The young man bid them both farewell, saying he was going to the edge of the island to welcome his father, and left quickly, full of joy. Li Minggong chuckled.

"He means well. Uncle An rejected Wenhu's gift, but then I kept it here. Now that it's gone, he was afraid you would think I secretly accepted a bribe, so he made a point of clarifying."

An Siwei understood, of course, and his expression was one of approval. He said in a deep voice, "The Second Young Master is magnanimous and astute. He is a blessing to our clan."

'It's not just Jianglong,' Li Minggong thought, then said aloud, "Jianglong and Jiangxia are older and are already showing great promise. Jiangliang is a few years younger, and I've met him as well. They each have their own unique qualities..."

"All of the Radiant Splendor generation are talented," she continued. "If they had been born in my Chengming generation, the conflict between north and south would surely have gone much better. That would have been a great thing."

A bitter expression crossed her face, and she lowered her eyes gracefully, careful not to be impolite in front of her elder. An Siwei was getting on in years and didn't dare discuss such topics with her. He just clasped his hands and said, "I'll go and prepare the reception for the other Purple Mansion cultivators. I asked the clan elders, and they said holding it on the island is inappropriate. The current plan is to hold it in the Helin Mountains, where the terrain is most open and the spiritual qi is most balanced."

Li Minggong was familiar with the clan's affairs and understood immediately. She nodded. "This is a good opportunity to renovate the old Helin Mountains. And since the matter with Mount Xiaoshi and the Secret Diffusion sects is settled, I don't need to go back. I can stay and help with the festivities."

An Siwei nodded. They went outside together. The Helin Mountains by the lake were already being decorated with countless golden floating murals. Cultivators flew to and fro, and the air was filled with joyous celebration.



# Chapter 696: The Immortal Palace Within the Mirror

The world inside the Immortal Mirror was in flux.

Clouds drifted up and down, a great sun hung high in the sky, and wisps of grey qi scattered as the vibrant lights of divine abilities began to manifest one by one.

When Li Ximing broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, the Talisman Seed immediately sent feedback into the mirror. A life-giving, spiritual ambrosia rained down, breathing vitality into the realm. The entire world seemed to awaken, bursting into a symphony of brilliant color.

Lu Jiangxian materialized in the sky. Beneath his feet lay a sprawling complex of gleaming white immortal palaces and pavilions, surrounded by shimmering lakes and ethereal mists. A few stone spirits could be seen darting between the halls, painting a picture of a true celestial domain.

'The Purple Mansion Realm… he’s finally achieved it.'

Li Ximing’s breakthrough had taken over a decade. The process of pushing his foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint had gone smoothly, and he had navigated the trial of endless oblivion with the help of the Talisman Seed. The remaining steps, however, had been fraught with peril. In Lu Jiangxian's view, luck had played no small part in his success.

Li Ximing’s Dao Heart had never been weak, and it had been tempered further by years of cultivation and countless trials. Thus, throughout the process of forging his divine ability, the greatest threat had not been the endless illusions, but the single, instantaneous moment of its conception.

Even with the *Radiant Essence Scripture*, the nine secret arts of which he had mastered three, and the aid of the Radiant Sky Stone, Li Ximing’s chances of success had been no more than fifty percent.

He himself hadn't realized it, but that fleeting moment when he successfully forged "Audience with the Celestial Gate" had been far more dangerous than he could ever imagine.

'Still, his success is a great boon… And Li Zhouwei, being in the spotlight, drew most of the danger away from him…'

Li Ximing’s breakthrough was a profound nourishment to the Immortal Mirror itself. While Lu Jiangxian could simulate various divine abilities using his Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence, it was no match for the feedback from the Talisman Seed. The moment Li Ximing succeeded, the entire mirror world was infused with the power of a divine ability.

The bright white immortal palaces, which the stone spirits had spent a century building under Lu Jiangxian’s direction, already filled the original area. Now, with a deep rumble, the ground expanded. The dark clouds on the horizon rapidly receded, and the world grew several times larger, revealing vast new lands.

Lu Jiangxian descended past the central, circular palace complex to the newly formed territory. Unlike the rolling landscapes of before, the ground here was as smooth as a mirror, a perfectly flat, unbroken plain stretching as far as the eye could see.

He pondered for a moment, and with a single thought, the world obeyed. Billowing white mists, like smoke and fog, surged from the distant horizon and swept inward, blanketing the ground completely. The entire palace complex now appeared to be floating atop a sea of clouds, shrouded in an aura of infinite mystery.

'Much better.'

Reappearing high in the sky, he formed a seal. A celestial gate materialized from thin air and descended upon the distant clouds. It was constructed of white bricks, with two corner towers adorned with seventy-two brightly decorated ridges, carved with dragons and phoenixes, and hung with flags and banners—a truly magnificent sight.

'Bright Yang: Audience with the Celestial Gate!'

He formed another seal. The sun in the sky, a manifestation of his Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence, began to shimmer with iridescent light, showering the world with countless falling stars. These stars drifted about before transforming into various Golden-Armored Heavenly Soldiers.

Most were clad in smooth armor and carried simple spirit spears, but among them were generals wielding long halberds and wearing phoenix-plumed helms, as well as massive, cloth-armored strongmen. They descended into the palace, each finding their post.

"Lord Liu…"

"Ah, General Lin!"

In an instant, the silent palace came alive with a bustling clamor—the clang of armor, the murmur of conversations, and the sound of hearty laughter and greetings. The entire celestial court seemed to be a living, breathing, and smoothly functioning entity.

And yet, it was all born from a single thought.

With a gentle wave of his hand, all the figures in the world dissolved like smoke, leaving only the empty immortal palaces and pavilions behind. Lu Jiangxian chose a hall at random and descended into it.

'Beyond the changes within the mirror, the Supreme Yin Profound Light has now surpassed the Purple Mansion level. I wonder how it compares to the Golden Core Realm… The gap between the two is immense. At best, it could probably only injure a True Monarch.'

'The range of my spiritual sense, however, hasn’t changed much.'

Lu Jiangxian sat down at a table, his mind racing with thoughts.

'First, Yang Tianya is not dead. In fact, he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm long ago.'

This was a rather troublesome development. Yang Tianya served the Underworld, and he had personally seen Li Mutian. Cultivators gained a photographic memory after reaching Foundation Establishment, let alone the Purple Mansion Realm. Yang Tianya must have known that Li Mutian was a mere mortal.

'Yet, according to the information from Li Xizhi, Yang Tianya always referred to Li Mutian as a Foundation Establishment cultivator. That was clearly intentional.'

'At the very least, it means the Underworld bears the Li clan some goodwill. Whatever their hidden motives, they are willing to provide cover on the surface.'

But Lu Jiangxian’s discoveries went far deeper. The two emissaries from the Underworld, Wang Long and Zhang Gui—Li Ximing had noticed nothing strange, but within Lu Jiangxian’s spiritual sense, their nature was perfectly clear.

'Those two… they’re not cultivators, nor are they demons. They seem to be souls that have been influenced by Metallic Essence, then sculpted into their current form by some powerful expert…'

Lu Jiangxian had long been puzzled by something. This world had a complete system of immortals and demons, yet it completely lacked ghosts. There were plenty of ghost stories and legends, and even a power like the Underworld, which was clearly designed to manage such beings, but in a hundred years, he had not seen a single ghost.

'Combined with what Dingjiao said, this must be a consequence of the celestial shift. The rules changed, affecting even True Monarchs and Immortals, to the point where the world can no longer even form ghosts.'

Understanding dawned in Lu Jiangxian’s mind.

'But the Fruition Attainment of the Underworld is likely tied to ghosts. If that’s the case… does it also mean that the Underworld, the power that presides over ghosts and spirits, has been weakened to an extreme degree since the shift?'

The only time the Li family had encountered anything resembling a ghost was when a disciple from Mount Wu had summoned them with shamanic arts. And even then, those green-faced, tusked creatures were more like puppets of shamanic arts than true spirits.

Lu Jiangxian had studied this phenomenon carefully. When mortals in this world died, their bodies immediately became empty shells. There was no process of a soul dissipating; nothing was left behind but lingering resentment and baleful energy, which could be used to refine treasures.

If one had cultivation and reached Embryonic Breathing, their death would appear normal to the untrained eye, but Lu Jiangxian could perceive their soul leaving the body and scattering into nothingness.

But here was the strange part: once a cultivator of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao reached the Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment realms, their soul would be extinguished instantly upon death, leaving no trace. Only after forging a divine ability and pushing their Shengyang Acupoint into the Great Void could their soul truly persist after death.

None of these ephemeral states were as stable as the Underworld’s emissaries. Lu Jiangxian was astonished by what he saw.

'This method uses Metallic Essence as a vessel for the soul. If I could master it, I could let beings like Dangjiang out of the mirror!'

He made a mental note of it.

'The Li family may have more contact with the Yang family in the future. I'll have to wait and see.'

Lost in thought, Lu Jiangxian clapped his hands lightly, and the bustling sounds of the celestial court once again filled the world. He gazed down at the puppet show he had created, an idea stirring in his mind.

'The mirror world has truly changed. There is so much more I can do now… And with such a fine place at my disposal… I can’t just let Dangjiang sit around in my pocket. Such a good laborer should be put to use.'

Riding a streak of light, he instantly appeared in a palace beside the main hall. Feeling a slight headache, he considered his options.

'What was the title I made up for Dangjiang back then… Since I gave him a title related to the Supreme Yin, this palace must reflect that.'

With a thought, the hall instantly transformed. The power of the Supreme Yin surged forth, and patterns of moon laurels and golden cassia blossoms appeared everywhere. The lunar sigil of the Supreme Yin was carved before and behind the hall, and several jade lamps as large as tables began to glow with the light of the full moon.

A cold snow began to fall, piling up in pristine white drifts. Small statues of toads and jade rabbits appeared throughout the hall, making it feel like a true moon palace. Lu Jiangxian surveyed his work, then summoned a plaque above the entrance.

*The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity*

The silver-white characters, though similar in color to the jade-white plaque, were utterly captivating. He looked from side to side, feeling something was still missing. With a flick of his finger, a ray of Supreme Yin moonlight landed on the floor.

White gravel flew from the corners of the room, merging with the moonlight to form a man in silver armor. Lu Jiangxian adjusted the face several times before settling on one that resembled Li Xijun, giving him the dignified air of an immortal general.

With a thought, the silver-armored man immediately bowed deeply.

"The Supreme Yin's Luminous Immortal General, Zhengao, pays his respects to the Palace Lord!"

Lu Jiangxian looked him over from every angle and nodded in satisfaction. The man was, of course, just another one of his puppets, but he would be more than enough to fool Dangjiang.

Returning to the main throne, Lu Jiangxian’s robes shifted and changed. He flicked his finger again, and a pale, turquoise light landed on the floor, coalescing into the form of a young boy.

The boy wore archaic robes, his sleeves embroidered with wave patterns. His eyes were a pale turquoise, and his face was round, making him look no older than a teenager. He appeared somewhat dazed, looking around until he spotted Lu Jiangxian on the throne above. He immediately fell to his knees in a panic.

"Dangjiang pays his respects to the Palace Lord."

For Dangjiang, it had been the blink of an eye. One moment he was in Anhuai Heaven, the next he was here. He had no idea how much time had passed, but looking at the magnificent decorations, he knew this was an immortal palace without a doubt. A sense of relief washed over him.

'That fool Chi Buzi, so shallow and ignorant… going on about how the immortal palaces were shattered… All nonsense. He acts so certain in private, but if he saw the Palace Lord, he’d be kneeling faster than anyone!'

Even as he calmed himself, a current of anxiety ran through him. According to what the Palace Lord had said before, he had escaped from the palace by accident. But Dangjiang’s mind was a blur; he had no memory of it. This was a crime in itself, how could he not be afraid?

Seated on his throne, Lu Jiangxian was still considering what tasks he could assign this fellow. He spoke casually, "This is not a place you should be. Since you escaped by accident, you will wait in the palace for now."

Dangjiang let out a sigh of relief. Before he could utter a word of thanks, Lu Jiangxian vanished. Dumbfounded, Dangjiang meekly backed out of the hall. The moment he stepped outside, he saw a man in silver armor standing there.

The man was handsome, with sharply defined cheeks and silver pupils. He stood holding a long spear, looking down at him. Dangjiang hurriedly bowed.

"Greetings, Immortal General! This humble official is Dangjiang, attendant of the River Stream Manor! Might I ask the Immortal General's…"

The silver-armored man simply said, "I am but a minor general of this palace. It is not worth mentioning… Please."

Dangjiang quickly agreed. As he walked through the palace, he glanced up for a moment and his eyes fell upon the words *The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity*. He felt a sharp sting, as if pierced by a needle, and quickly looked away, his heart filled with emotion.

'I, your old man, have now been to an immortal palace… When I go back to preside over my river manor in the lower realm, I'll have endless stories to tell… Chi Buzi? Just a minor cultivator! How could he possibly compare to me?'

Although Dangjiang had many memories, Lu Jiangxian had deliberately made them vague to leave room for future changes. His only clear memories were from his years with Chi Buzi, so he couldn't help but compare himself to the cultivator in private.

He was soon led to a corner of the vast and complex residence. Along the way, he saw many people coming and going. Several immortal generals and officials all bowed their heads in greeting to the silver-armored man. Dangjiang was a perceptive sort and immediately understood that the man before him was no ordinary figure.

'That makes sense. Anyone who can wait outside the Palace Lord’s main hall is no common immortal general…'

His expression became even more respectful. He was led to a small side room, but he didn't find it strange at all.

'I'm just a minor river official from the mortal world. What status could I possibly have in the heavens? It's only because the Palace Lord brought me here personally that I'm even allowed to stay in this palace.'

The silver-armored man led him into the room. His stern gaze fell upon Dangjiang as he spoke in a deep voice, "Friend Dangjiang, you may stay here for the time being. However, there are a few rules I must explain to you."

Dangjiang nodded repeatedly. The silver-armored man continued, "The immortal prohibitions are currently active throughout the celestial palace. No one is permitted to enter or leave any of the palaces or manors. If you become terribly bored, you may wander around this palace, but do not speak to too many people, and certainly do not step outside the main gate."

Lu Jiangxian was simply too lazy to create other immortal palaces and just wanted to keep the fellow confined here, but Dangjiang had a sudden realization and nodded thoughtfully.

The silver-armored man pointed to a cabinet in the room and said coldly, "But you will not be staying here for free. This cabinet contains numerous manuals—old techniques or arts confiscated from heretical paths. Immortal Official Li has descended to the mortal realm, so you will temporarily fill his position. Your task is to rewrite and expand upon these techniques. Someone will come to collect them annually."

"This subordinate obeys!"

Dangjiang was quick to fall into his new role, his mind already spinning with possibilities, his heart surging with excitement.

'If I perform my duties well, perhaps I can even be transferred to a position in the heavens…'

Seeing his enthusiasm, the silver-armored man finally showed a hint of a smile. As he was about to close the door and leave, Dangjiang quickly called out to him respectfully, "Might I ask the Immortal General's esteemed name?"

Zhengao’s voice rang out, "Zhengao, holder of the rank of Supreme Yin's Luminous Immortal General."

The string of titles stunned Dangjiang, and he looked at the general with even greater reverence. He escorted him all the way out, passing several other immortal officials who ignored him completely, greeting only Zhengao.

Dangjiang knew his own status was insignificant and paid it no mind. He hurried back to his room, his face beaming with joy. He looked around, touching this and that, feeling that everything in the heavens was superior.

"My, my, this Supreme Yin pattern is the real deal…"

He finally made his way to the small cabinet. After admiring its noble carvings, he opened it with great care. He was met with a loud clatter as a cascade of jade slips tumbled out, clinking and clanking as they scattered across the floor, nearly covering it entirely.

Dangjiang stood frozen, staring at the cabinet, which was barely larger than his own body. He couldn't help but curse inwardly.

'So damn many?! What in the world was that Immortal Official Li doing? He probably descended to the mortal realm to escape his deadlines! Right, right! That plague-ridden bastard must be the laziest immortal official in existence!'

He picked up a single jade slip from the floor. Reading it carefully, he estimated its contents would fill three large chests with books. A bitter expression immediately formed on his face.

'Immortal Official Li must have been on strike for decades… Even a donkey isn't worked this hard…'



# Chapter 697: The Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly (Part 1)

The waters of Moongaze Lake were placid under a cloudless sky. An indigo pavilion stood over the rippling surface, connected to a central island by a long causeway. A few stone lotus lamps flickered with a soft, magical light.

The octagonal pavilion was adorned with eight distinct runes, highlighted with cinnabar reliefs. It faced the Western Mountains, and above its entrance hung a jade plaque inscribed with large characters:

[Vermillion Bud Pavilion]

A woman in a light red, cloud-patterned satin dress sat within the pavilion. A silver necklace graced her neck, and an ancient book rested in her hands. It was Li Que'wan.

The Vermillion Bud Pavilion was where she practiced her cultivation. The Dao of the Whole Pill she pursued was not concerned with the abundance of spiritual energy, but with the transformations of the material world. For this reason, Li Zhouwei had scoured the entire lake to find the location most attuned to such changes and built this pavilion for her.

While a lake had little to do with the Whole Pill, this specific spot was where the clan had once set up a formation, activated the Dui Metal, and dispelled the great restrictive array on the island. As such, it could be considered a place of transformation.

Mount Wu would have been the ideal location, as it was the former cultivation ground of the High Shaman Duanmu Kui. Unfortunately, after Li Ximing achieved his divine ability there, the entire mountain had been transformed into a Bright Yang sacred ground, forever changing its nature.

'The clan is going to rename Mount Wu, but I wonder what they'll decide.'

A breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm was a joyous occasion, but Li Que'wan was tinged with worry. While clan affairs were proceeding smoothly, her own personal matters remained unresolved.

Her father, Li Baotuo, had come to the island to live a blissful life of walking his hounds and training his birds. Her brothers, however, ran a shipping business between the two shores. They were skilled, and with her influence, their business naturally flourished. But they had encroached upon another family's interests. In a fit of anger, the other party had filed a complaint with the Court of Justice, accusing her brothers of "leveraging her name for profit." That very night, they were escorted to Mount Qingdu.

Li Que'wan was familiar with the clan's procedures and knew her brothers were in no immediate danger. But her father was so frantic with worry that his mouth had broken out in sores. He had already come to see her several times.

She was grateful that the breakthrough celebration was occupying everyone's attention. Her clan uncle, Li Zhouluo, who was stationed at Mount Qingdu, had not yet passed judgment. Otherwise, she couldn't imagine what a mess it would become.

She sighed and set down the book. Glancing at the time, she thought, 'Three months have passed in a flash. The other sects will be arriving at Moongaze Lake soon. I must go and receive them.'

Li Que'wan and Li Jiangqian were the rising stars of their generation. With Li Ximing's ascension to the Purple Mansion Realm, the Li clan had become a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan. Her and Jiangqian's status had soared overnight. It was a world of difference.

Li Que'wan pressed the book to her chest, her heart a mix of joy and anxiety.

'In the eyes of the other sects, Jiangqian and I are probably seen as figures like Chi Fubo or Si Tongyi were back in the day. We have no choice but to greet them.'

It was the way of the world. News of their clan, big or small, had likely already reached the other major powers. Li Que'wan guessed that in their eyes, the clan head, Li Zhouwei, was now being compared to the likes of Tuoba Chongyuan.

'With reputation comes trouble…'

She flew from the pavilion up into the clouds, where she saw Li Minggong standing on a cloud of fire, dressed in red ceremonial robes. As a cultivator of the True Fire Dao, her Pheasant Li March technique had an air of the Fire Luan, which was only enhanced by her attire. She stood in the air with a dignified grace.

"Greetings, my lady!" Li Que'wan said with a respectful bow.

Li Minggong spent most of her years guarding the North Shore and the river border, so she and Li Que'wan had rarely met. But as the eldest sister of the First Branch, she was one of her closest Foundation Establishment relatives. Furthermore, as one of the few female cultivators at that level, Li Que'wan naturally felt an affinity for her.

Li Minggong's poised and generous nature had long ago earned praise from Li Xijun, and she possessed a bright, likable charisma. After Li Que'wan offered a warm greeting, Li Minggong stood gracefully and replied in a light, cheerful tone, "Ah, Wan'er, you're here. Just stay behind me. Jiangqian is with Chenghui, receiving guests on the other side."

"You look beautiful, Grand-aunt," Li Que'wan said with a smile, covering her mouth.

Li Minggong accepted the compliment with ease. She glanced at Li Que'wan and chuckled. "I'm getting old. I can't compare to your youth."

As they spoke, Li Zhouluo arrived, leading a group of people on a current of golden qi. He was dressed in magnificent robes, blue over white, and his sixth-layer Qi Refining cultivation pulsed with golden energy. As the head of the third branch, his standing in the Li family was already quite high. For him to personally guide these guests meant they were of extraordinary status.

Li Minggong nodded in approval. Li Que'wan, however, tensed at the sight of her uncle.

'Uncle Zhouluo is in charge of affairs at Mount Qingdu. My brothers' case will have to go through him…'

Unaware of her thoughts, Li Minggong smiled and stepped forward to greet the newcomers. "Welcome, friends from the Profound Peak Gate! I am Li Minggong…"

"Congratulations, congratulations!" The man at the front wore the golden robes of the Profound Peak Gate and was clearly the sect master. He had a fair, clean-shaven face and offered polite pleasantries before formally introducing himself. "I am Kong Guxi of the Profound Peak Gate. It is a pleasure to meet you, fellow Daoist."

Kong Guxi was polite, but the old man beside him was beaming, his beard bristling with excitement. He tugged at his sleeve and laughed. "I'm Kong Yu! Do you know of me, young lady? Li Xuanxuan is a dear friend of mine! We go back many years. Where is that old fellow now?"

Old Kong Yu was a lively and sentimental man. He seemed as overjoyed as if it were his own sect that had produced a Purple Mansion cultivator.

Li Minggong laughed. "I have heard of you, Elder. My elders have mentioned you several times. They are already waiting for you on the mountain. Please, come inside."

Her words gave Kong Yu a great deal of face. The old man immediately puffed out his chest, immensely pleased. Kong Guxi smiled and added a few words of his own. "I have prepared a few small gifts along our journey. Please accept them."

These were the Profound Peak Gate's congratulatory gifts to the Li family, mostly precious herbs and magical artifacts. Any separate dealings between Daoist Master Changxi and Li Ximing would be handled later.

The cultivators flanking Kong Guxi quickly presented several jade boxes. Li Que'wan thanked them repeatedly as she respectfully accepted them. Li Zhouluo then escorted the Profound Peak cultivators toward the Milin Mountains, leaving Li Minggong and Li Que'wan alone in the clouds.

Li Minggong watched them go, her mind racing. 'I hear Daoist Master Changxi of Profound Peak is nearing the end of his lifespan. I wonder if it's true. Their visit this time… they likely have their own plans.'

When Li Ximing broke through, Daoist Master Changxi was the first to arrive with congratulations. While his proximity was a factor, his words had shown genuine sincerity.

Li Minggong glanced over at Li Que'wan and saw the girl staring off into space. She knew what was on her mind; she had heard about the trouble with Li Baotuo's children. It was a minor issue, but it directly involved Li Que'wan.

"Que'wan," Li Minggong said seriously, "don't worry. The clan will handle it justly."

Li Que'wan snapped back to the present and quickly thanked her.

Li Minggong then smiled. "Jiangqian doesn't know yet. If he did, someone would be in for a world of trouble."

…

Milin Mountain.

The mountain itself was not particularly tall, but its range was vast and rolling, teeming with spiritual energy. After the Yu family's fall, the area had descended into chaos. The original palaces and pavilions were shattered, leaving behind a wreck.

These structures were not ordinary buildings. They had been built by cultivators, not by simply raising them from the earth with magic. They required intricate formations, inlaid with spiritual materials and artifacts—a complex undertaking.

When the Li family took over, they were immediately beset by major events and the conflict between the North and South Shores. They had no resources to spare for repairs, focusing only on restoring the spiritual fields and herb gardens to secure resources and provide a place for cultivation.

Only after the conflict ended and the Li family enjoyed a decade of peace and growth did they have the strength to begin rebuilding Milin Mountain. In the last three months, the clan-wide celebration had transformed the entire mountain range into something new.

Pavilions and halls now cascaded down the slopes, standing tall amidst the clouds. Green stone steps wound through them, shrouded in ethereal spiritual mist. The five spiritual springs on the mountain gushed forth, their waters flowing down channels carved alongside the steps, winding through various courtyards before reaching the mountain's base.

Luminous lanterns lined the paths, each painted with the emblems of Bright Yang and Li Fire. The steps themselves were carved with images of flood dragons and ocean waves. Cultivators flew back and forth, landing and taking off from the courtyards.

The transformation wasn't limited to Milin Mountain. The entire area around the lake—its sixteen prefectures, two peaks, and one mountain—had been renewed. Six great gatehouses, modeled after the Radiant Origin Pass, now stood sentinel around the lake.

These gatehouses were built of white brick, with ornate corner towers and seventy-two distinct ridges. Each stood twelve zhang tall, their designs varying slightly based on their location and orientation. They were named the Four Symbols Gate, the Profound Enterprise Gate, the Courtyard Abyss Gate, the Changxi Gate, the Inherited Clarity Gate, and the Zhou Martial Gate.

The Four Symbols Gate on the South Shore was the most magnificent, standing a full head taller than the others. The Changxi Gate stood at the foot of Milin Mountain, connected to its defensive formations. All cultivators had to enter the mountain through it.

Li Zhouluo led Kong Yu and the others down to the Changxi Gate, where the brothers Li Zhoufang were on guard. The two were older than even Li Zhouwei, with grown sons of their own. Their talent was average, and they had started their cultivation late, making them look far more weathered and unremarkable.

Kong Guxi glanced around and praised, "What a fine Changxi Gate…"

All six gatehouses had been personally designed by Li Ximing and empowered by his divine ability. Their patterns not only contained the essence of Bright Yang but also held a profound mystery that captivated the eye. Though Kong Guxi and Kong Yu did not cultivate the Bright Yang Dao, they could sense its profundity.

Just as they passed through the gate, they saw a man in white and gold armor standing within. He had broad shoulders and sharp, golden eyes.

Kong Yu hesitated for a moment, but Kong Guxi was already stunned. 'The White Qilin of the Li Clan… Li Zhouwei!'

When Li Ximing had been in seclusion, the Li clan had relied solely on Li Zhouwei and Li Chenghui to hold the line. Every major power had been watching him. Kong Guxi, having just taken over the Profound Peak Gate from Kong Tingyun, knew this better than anyone.

When a demon general ran rampant on the North Shore of Moongaze Lake and the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion suddenly established themselves on the northern bank, the Fei family had cried for help. It was Li Zhouwei who had enlisted the Elder White Ape to defend the shore. He and Li Chenghui had blocked the river, activating the ancient formation of Cloud-Gathering Southern Sky to slay the demon.

The entire affair had taken less than a night. By the time the forces from the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion were halfway there, Li Zhouwei had already killed the demon and sent its head to the Azure Pond Sect. Everyone knew the demon was almost certainly connected to the Three Sects, but with the head delivered to Azure Pond, they could only swallow the loss.

That event marked the beginning of the North Shore conflict. In the decade that followed, from covert harassment to open disputes over spiritual fields, Li Zhouwei had led the charge. With Li Xizhi's full support—who even returned personally on several occasions—the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion, despite having several times the number of Foundation Establishment cultivators, could only chip away at the Li's interests on the lake, never shaking their foundation.

As Li Zhouwei's cultivation and techniques grew, and as Li Chenghui mastered the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman, the Floating Cloud Cave was rendered helpless unless their cave master intervened. In the end, even when the Floating Cloud Cave Master, Fudou, attacked personally, Li Zhouwei still managed to escape.

The Li clan then used the Cloud-Gathering Southern Sky formation to defend the North Shore. At the cost of leaving the North Shore barren, they consolidated their forces, freeing Li Zhouwei from having to stand guard constantly.

Although Li Ximing's breakthrough had led to the Floating Cloud Cave's collapse, in Kong Guxi's view, Li Zhouwei's repeated triumphs had already made it impossible for them to pose a real threat to the Li clan.

Seeing Li Zhouwei now, Kong Guxi noted the unusual color of his eyes and his powerful aura. He seemed formidable, but otherwise showed no other peculiarities.

He respectfully clasped his hands. "Greetings, Clan Head!"

The golden-eyed young man nodded at him. "The Sect Master of Profound Peak. Zhouwei greets you."

Kong Guxi's cultivation was not high, and his clan's Earth Virtue techniques were not suited for combat. He was likely no match for Li Zhouwei and quickly responded with courtesy.

Standing beside Li Zhouwei was another man, his hair half-white, his features kind and his complexion ruddy. Two strings of medicinal pouches swayed at his waist. His deep cultivation seemed to emanate from him, suggesting he practiced the Wood Virtue.

Kong Guxi had never met this man, but seeing his Xiao family attire, he knew it had to be Xiao Yuansi.

A realization dawned on him. 'In today's Li clan, only Xiao Yuansi is worthy of a personal welcome from Li Zhouwei! That pill of his… everyone once mocked him for his foolishness. Now, they all praise his foresight!'

Xiao Yuansi himself had only learned the news three months ago. The shock had left him speechless for a long time. Even now, he was filled with joy and relief. The old man looked as though he had consumed a precious elixir; his complexion glowed, and his eyes sparkled.

Kong Yu looked on with envy and sentiment. 'To have a Purple Mansion disciple, and to have played a major role in that disciple's breakthrough… this senior need not worry for the rest of his days.'

More figures began to gather at the Changxi Gate. Cultivators from various families came forward to greet the White Qilin of the Li clan. Despite his formidable power, Li Zhouwei was courteous, returning each greeting without a hint of aloofness.

Just as Kong Guxi was about to head up the mountain, a blazing ray of celestial light descended from the sky and solidified on the steps, revealing a man in a gold and white Daoist robe. His features were regular, with no striking characteristics save for his pale golden eyes and the brilliant point of light between his brows.

It could be none other than Li Ximing.

Kong Guxi did not dare to look for long, his gaze quickly shifting away. Behind the man stood a middle-aged figure with a plain appearance, wearing a brown robe with mountain patterns and a jade pendant on his chest. Kong Guxi's pupils contracted. He dropped to his knees with a thud.

"Greetings, Patriarch! Greetings, Daoist Master!"

At his cry, the other cultivators from Profound Peak Gate froze for a second before following his lead, a wave of them falling to their knees in unison. In an instant, every member of the Profound Peak Gate was kowtowing.

Kong Yu and the others were now high-ranking members of the sect; how could they not recognize their own patriarch, Daoist Master Changxi, standing beside Li Ximing? Even those who had never met him in person recognized the portrait that hung in their sect's main hall.

As the Profound Peak delegation knelt, the other cultivators were momentarily stunned before most followed suit. Even the direct descendants of other Purple Mansion cultivators bowed their heads and clasped their hands.

"Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing!" they all intoned.

Xiao Yuansi's head shot up, his eyes meeting Li Ximing's face. A smile spread across the old man's lips. Amidst the chorus of reverent greetings, Li Ximing gave a slight bow.

"Greetings, Master," he said softly.



# Chapter 698: The Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly (Part 2)

Xiao Yuansi hesitated. The old man was not one for grand displays. He raised his eyes to Li Ximing’s face, which, while unchanged, seemed entirely different.

"Ming'er…"

The face before him was well-proportioned, with long eyebrows and pale golden eyes that watched him with a gentle smile.

'Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing.'

The simmering frustration that had always seemed clenched between his brows, a look of gritted teeth and repressed anger, was gone. It had vanished completely, replaced by a single point of celestial light shimmering on his forehead.

His restless, slightly anxious gaze had also disappeared. Li Ximing's eyes now held a warm and gentle smile, free of the melancholy resolve of one marching willingly to his death.

With these two burdens lifted from his expression, his entire face came alive. He was no longer the Li clan's desperate, last-ditch gamble. He was Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing.

Tears welled in Xiao Yuansi’s eyes. Under the watchful gaze of the crowd, he could only sigh.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing's fortunes are profound. This old man has basked in your light."

Li Ximing smiled and helped him up. Daoist Master Changxi, standing nearby, spoke in a warm and friendly tone, his heart filled with envy.

"Master, this way, please," Li Ximing said respectfully.

Everyone knew about the pill Xiao Yuansi had given him. They also knew how he had been reprimanded by Xiao Chuting and returned from the Northern Sea in disgrace. For the ten years Li Ximing was in seclusion, Xiao Yuansi had been either a joke or a topic of gossip among the direct lines of the major sects and clans.

Li Ximing had heard snippets of this. By coming to welcome him personally, he wanted to show everyone and restore his master's honor.

That was the first reason. The second was that Xiao Chuting had also come to Moongaze Lake. He was already on the island. True to form, the Daoist Master never involved himself personally and had simply allowed Xiao Yuansi to come from the mountains. Li Ximing naturally seized the opportunity, making it clear to all that the bond between the Xiao and Li families was as strong as ever.

Though a small gesture, it was greatly beneficial to the Li clan. Li Ximing escorted Xiao Yuansi into the mountains and saw him settled in a courtyard before returning to the main island. There, he heard from An Siwei that Xiao Chuting had already left his gift and departed alone.

Li Ximing nodded in understanding, but Daoist Master Changxi, who stood beside him, quietly lowered his gaze.

'So, Xiao Chuting is avoiding me…'

Though newly ascended and not as adept at discerning such subtleties as the more seasoned Purple Mansion cultivators, Li Ximming could see it plainly. A sense of dread grew in his heart.

'This situation with Changxi… it really is a mess.'

But no matter how close the Li and Profound Peak Gate were, and with Changxi here to offer congratulations, Li Ximing could not avoid him as Xiao Chuting had. He sat down with the Daoist Master in a mountain garden filled with blooming gardenias.

"A fine Bright Yang domain," Changxi said with a smile. "I wonder what name Daoist Master Zhaojing has chosen for it?"

Li Ximing poured him tea. "I have named this place Gardenia Scenery Mountain," he said politely. "It will be my place of quiet cultivation from now on."

"Excellent!" Changxi exclaimed. He took an item from his sleeve and placed it on the table. Inside a jade box lay a perfectly round white pearl. It radiated a brilliant, hair-thin rainbow light and was faintly carved with the image of a tiger looking over its shoulder, giving it an incredibly domineering aura.

Daoist Master Changxi's face flickered between youth and old age, shifting on the hour. He currently had the appearance of a middle-aged man, a jade pendant on his chest and a joyful expression on his face.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, our two families have supported each other for a century. My family's Tingyun and your Yuanjiao were the closest of friends. Now that you have achieved your divine ability, my heart is filled with joy. I have prepared this humble gift for you."

His tone was exceptionally pleasant, and he no longer called Li Ximing ‘little friend.’ A man several centuries old was humbling himself to call someone not yet a hundred years of age ‘Daoist Friend,’ while tactfully bringing up their old ties. It was the height of courtesy.

'His lifespan… is truly running out.'

Li Ximing could tell with a single glance that the item was at least of the Purple Mansion level, likely a Purple Mansion dharma artifact. It was relatively new, probably less than a century old. While it couldn't compare to treasures like the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal or the Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing, it was far beyond any of the Li family’s current artifacts.

'This is too valuable!'

Li Ximing was not naive about the significance of a Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly. But these Purple Mansion cultivators were a stingy lot. They would freely give away Foundation Establishment treasures, but Purple Mansion items were out of the question. The assembly was more about showing face and demonstrating goodwill by attending.

As for gifts? One couldn't expect Purple Mansion dharma artifacts or materials. At best, you might receive a fourth-grade technique. More often, it was ancient curios, rare treasures, or obscure manuals that wouldn't compromise the giver's status.

For Changxi to offer a Purple Mansion dharma artifact, his intentions were crystal clear. He wanted to create a debt that he could call upon to secure a future for the Profound Peak Gate.

As if reading his thoughts, Changxi smiled. "This artifact is called the 'Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger.' It is a mid-grade earth-element dharma artifact. It was not refined by my own divine ability but was acquired on my travels. It cannot compare to a dharma treasure, but it is quite serviceable."

"Refined by a divine ability?" Li Ximing asked, intrigued.

Changxi chuckled, his voice turning aged as he explained, "Dharma Artifacts can be roughly divided into three types. The first is made by taking an excellent artifact embryo and infusing it with one's divine ability. After a century of refinement, it becomes a dharma artifact, perfectly attuned to its master."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. "It's that simple? Then why are there so few dharma artifacts in Jiangnan?"

Changxi stroked his beard. "Firstly, a good embryo is difficult to craft. Furthermore, since the tool is refined by a divine ability, it is bound to the same nature as its master's power. It requires constant nurturing, which drains the mind, and it will revert to its original form if separated from the divine ability for too long. It sounds easy, but such items are very difficult to pass down."

Li Ximing immediately recalled the nine gate-viewing spirit embryos that Daoist Master Tianque had spent a century forging at Daoist He's place on the western shore of Moongaze Lake. It was indeed no simple task. He nodded, and Changxi continued.

"The second type is more common, like this Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. These are forged by Purple Mansion-level artifact refiners. Their quality varies, from high to low. The lowest grade is inferior to even a good spirit embryo, while the highest can rival a dharma treasure."

"They are also classified into upper, middle, and lower grades. A mid-grade tool is comparable to one refined by a divine ability, but it is a treasure that can be passed down through a family, and it is not restricted to a single cultivator's essence."

"As for so-called dharma treasures…" Changxi's expression turned self-deprecating, and he shook his head. "In truth, they are merely ancient dharma artifacts from before the celestial shift, like the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. Back then, they were just dharma artifacts. Now, we must call them dharma treasures… To think they are a cut above all modern dharma artifacts. It’s quite ironic."

Hearing this, Li Ximing understood a great deal more, and his estimation of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal rose even higher. 'No wonder Yuansu could dominate everyone with a single divine ability. He himself is formidable… but that Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal is also no simple item.'

Changxi glanced at him and hesitated, then, as if to curry more favor, he spoke again with a smile. "I once heard of another method of artifact refinement from long ago. It is no longer viable, but it is an interesting story to share."

"Please, Senior, tell me!" Li Ximing was eager to learn more.

Changxi stroked his beard and began his tale. "It is said that a thousand years ago, cultivators with an immortal foundation had a method of refining artifacts by gathering the will of the masses. It was exceptionally effective. Ancient cultivators lived among the people, using their divine abilities to connect with them and draw upon the thoughts and will of the populace to temper an artifact, granting it a spirit. This was called the 'Refining Radiance Art.'"

"We can still see traces of it on many of the ancient dharma artifacts we find. The highest-grade magic treasures of that era also possessed this capability."

A bomb went off in Li Ximing’s mind. The next thought surfaced uncontrollably.

'Lu Qi!'

'Isn't that my Immortal Mirror?!'

'The highest-grade magic treasures!'

His mind went blank for a moment as a torrent of complex thoughts rushed through him.

'No wonder I couldn't see through the Talisman Seed even after achieving my divine ability… No wonder it allows mortals to cultivate, no wonder it has the miraculous Lu Qi. It truly is an immortal tool!'

'And the Supreme Yin Profound Light is so powerful! Now that I've reached the Purple Mansion Realm, its might is even harder to fathom. A child could probably wield it and injure a Purple Mansion cultivator… What in the world could allow for such a thing? Only a true dharma treasure could have such power!'

He forcibly shoved the thoughts from his mind, struggling to maintain his composure. Without missing a beat, he asked, "Then why is it not possible now? Has the method been lost?"

Changxi was no fool. He immediately sensed Li Ximing's emotional fluctuation. Though he could never have guessed the Li family possessed such an item, he assumed Li Ximing was simply awestruck by the tale. The old man sighed. "It is no longer possible, but the method was not lost. I was very interested in this in my youth and searched everywhere, poring over many ancient texts, and managed to find some information…"

A look of confusion crossed the old man's face, and he frowned. "It is said… that the method itself was taken. Some say stolen, some say seized, and others say it was 'proven' or 'attained.' But all accounts lead to a single name."

"A name…" Li Ximing felt a sudden reluctance to hear it, fearing some world-shaking name would fall from the old man's lips.

But Changxi had already spoken: "Su Xikong."

"Su Xikong…" The name was very familiar. Li Ximing instantly recalled it. When Yu Muxian returned from the north and fought two opponents at once, he had revealed this venerable name. The various masters that Li Xuanfeng had killed had also chanted it: "The Acharya taught me, granting me the art of Su Xikong, the principles of Shakya… Su Xikong is the Revered One!"

Changxi nodded in confirmation. "Correct. The loss of this method is likely related to him. After he attained his Dao, the power of such artifacts diminished by eighty percent. In the century that followed, they grew weaker year by year, their related abilities fading away."

"After four hundred years, most of the dharma artifacts created by the Refining Radiance Art had lost all their power. Only a few that were close to the level of dharma treasures and had a strong connection to a Fruition Attainment managed to retain some semblance of their might, though they were far from what they once were. And no one since has been able to use this method."

Silence fell between them. Li Ximing immediately thought of the situation in the north and formed several conjectures. From Changxi's expression, he probably had his own ideas as well, though he would not voice them.

The topic came to a close. The old Daoist Master smiled and pushed the jade box forward. Li Ximing looked down at the glittering artifact, hesitating.

'Do I accept it… or not?'

…

Mist and clouds swirled through the mountain courtyards. Li Ximing had not yet taken the head seat, but rows of jade cushions and tables had been set out, and the crowd was growing.

Li Jiangqian sat at the head of the left courtyard, lightly raising his jade cup. Beside him was a cultivator in azure robes with a transcendent air and a calm expression. He was at the Foundation Establishment realm—the Azure Pond Peak Master, Si Tongyi.

Si Tongyi was of a similar age to Li Zhouwei. With Li Ximing's sudden breakthrough, he no longer dared to address Li Xizhi as a peer. But he was a man who could swallow his pride, and he had immediately struck up a conversation with Li Jiangqian, seating himself right next to him.

He was now pointing out various cultivators below and introducing them in a friendly manner. "That is Cheng Jinzhu of the Sword Gate. He is a good friend of your Changtian Peak Master… and a renowned sword cultivator in his own right."

Li Jiangqian followed his gaze and saw a man with a sword on his back sitting among the guests. His expression was placid, and the seats around him were empty, a clear sign that others were reluctant to sit near him.

"Thank you for the information, honored uncle," Li Jiangqian said with a warm smile.

Si Tongyi did not dwell on Cheng Jinzhu and proceeded to introduce the other guests in order. Li Jiangqian scanned the surroundings, his thoughts lingering on the few Daoist Masters seated on clouds above.

On a cloud platform to the west sat a man with broad shoulders and thick eyebrows, dressed in a fire-patterned Daoist robe. His every breath was like an invisible flame that slightly distorted the spiritual energy around him. This was Daoist Master Tianque of the Golden Feather Sect.

With Daoist Master Tianyuan of the Golden Feather Sect nearing the end of his life, Daoist Master Tianhuo in seclusion, and Daoist Master Qiushui making her presence known in the world, things had changed. After Daoist Master Zipei's fall, Qiushui had become one of the top Purple Mansion cultivators in the Yue State. Her status was too high, so Daoist Master Tianque, who usually guarded the Wu Kingdom, had come in her stead.

The representative from the Azure Pond Sect was, of course, Daoist Master Yuanxiu. The old man always wore a stern expression. Li Jiangqian didn't look at him, instead mentally tallying the attendees.

'Of the Three Sects… Golden Feather and Azure Pond are here. Yue Cultivating Sect did not come.'

Both sects had their own agendas but had shown face. The Yue Cultivating Sect had closed its gates, so its absence was expected. Li Jiangqian was more concerned with the Seven Gates.

'No word from the Snow Wings Gate… that sect hasn't been seen in the world for centuries.'

'The Sword Gate, the Chen Clan, and the Xiukui Monastery did not send their Purple Mansion masters, only their direct lines. Their response is… proper, but neutral.'

The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate and the Great Xiukui Monastery had no strong allegiances, so their actions were normal. Besides, Cheng Jinzhu's status was not low. The other gates, however, had made clearer statements.

'The Profound Peak Gate's delegation is the most impressive, followed by the Xiao Clan. Xiao Chuting came in person… though I hear he only showed his face for a moment and left. Only a few people saw him.'

'The Purple Mansion masters of the Purple Smoke Gate and Slaughter Jun Gate are not in their sects, so they sent their successors. Their seats are still empty, as they are still on their way.'

He raised his gaze. At the head of the southern seats was a Daoist Master with a cheerful face. Beside him sat a woman in red, Bi Yuzhuang, wearing a golden bracelet and a bright smile.

'The Hengzhu Sect sent Daoist Master Hengli and Bi Yuzhuang… They also show a great deal of respect.'

Li Jiangqian surveyed the entire assembly, all while making pleasant conversation with Si Tongyi, his mind crystal clear.

Of the Seven Gates, the Changxiao Gate had not come.

Not only were Changxiao Zi and Cheng Yan absent, but even their disciples had merely offered congratulations before leaving, not even taking a seat.

Aside from the Three Sects and Seven Gates, few cultivators from Jiangbei had come, with the notable exception of the Shen Clan. As for the major immortal sects of the Wu Kingdom, not a single one had appeared.

'Hengzhu and Changxiao are at odds… and our clan has had its own share of trouble with the Changxiao Gate…'

Li Jiangqian lowered his eyes, realizing the situation was not as bright as it seemed.

'Behind our clan, we only have the Xiao Clan and the Profound Peak Gate. Xiao Chuting is a wanderer… he won't make a move casually. And once Daoist Master Changxi falls, the entire Profound Peak territory will become a burden.'

'If things go wrong then, will we have to lean on the Hengzhu Sect? They are a righteous sect, it's true… but Hengxing and the others are quite calculating…'

He could not fathom the relationships between the Purple Mansion masters. He could only look up to the head table. His father, Li Zhouwei, was in the first seat of honor, and beside him was Kong Guxi of the Profound Peak's Kong family. The two were deep in pleasant conversation, a sight that made Li Jiangqian hesitate to raise his cup.

'Profound Peak… they are a hot potato. We absolutely cannot catch it…'
