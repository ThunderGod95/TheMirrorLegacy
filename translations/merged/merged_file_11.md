# Chapter 752: Wounded

Boom!

Purple lightning erupted. Helian Changguang never expected his wife to stay close to the chaos instead of backing away. That she even dared to step forward and interfere shocked him greatly. Heart pounding, he forced himself to cast a spell while braving the two bolts of lightning.

"Translucent Bloodsilver Technique!"

The blood-colored aura clinging to Li Qinghong’s protective lightning exploded with a thunderous blast, shattering the lightning into scattered fragments. Li Qinghong let out a muffled grunt, but she showed no hesitation. Her spear did not pause for a moment as it continued thrusting forward.

Pfft!

The dharma light protecting Liu Qiao shattered like an eggshell. Only the black glow rising from the talisman was of slightly higher quality. It dented inward under the strain, barely managing to hold together and shield her.

But how could this long-prepared strike from Li Qinghong be so easily blocked? Five bolts of lightning burst from her spear, flashing brilliantly in midair and casting a pale glow over the three faces. Then came the crack of thunder.

Bang!

A bright white spark flashed past, and five bolts of lightning struck Liu Qiao straight in the face. Devil cultivators already feared thunder by nature, so how could she possibly withstand such a blow? Her head burst like a watermelon and was refined by the lightning into black smoke that vanished into the air.

“Qiao’er!”

Helian Changguang’s eyes went bloodshot with grief as the black smoke rose but he did not rush to save his wife. Instead, red light flared on his dual blades as he viciously stabbed toward the snow-white robe on Li Qinghong’s back.

Meanwhile, Liu Qiao, reduced to just a lone torso and legs, raised her hand and pulled out a fleshy orb from her storage pouch. She gripped it in her two pale hands and moved it toward the stump of her neck.

Devil cultivators differed from immortal cultivators in that they were far more resilient. Though her head had reduced to ash, Liu Qiao was merely severely injured. But the two hands on her torso trembled faintly. She was absolutely terrified.

Though she could neither see nor hear, her spiritual sense still worked. It told her that Li Qinghong had remained calm. She showed no intention of retreating. Instead, she gently parted her red lips and released another beam of white light.

“What...”

Liu Qiao's hands froze mid-motion as the explosive white light burst forth. The earth trembled, boulders rolled, and purple thunder-rain returned once again. She was completely defenseless now and was only three feet from the beam. An instant later, it swallowed her whole.

Rumble...

A concentrated sweep of lightning flashed by, blinding the cultivators below. The air above the formation fell into eerie silence after the excessive thunderous blasts. Helian Changguang stared in disbelief, momentarily frozen.

“What?”

Li Qinghong pulled back her spear and turned coldly toward him. Her spear was pointed diagonally, and her white robes, now tinged with purple, fluttered gently in the wind.

Blood trickled slowly from the corner of her mouth. Her back was drenched red. Her black hair drifted in the wind, and strands near her forehead were still stained with blood.

Li Qinghong’s dark-gray eyes quietly bore into Helian Changguang. Behind her, the black smoke dispersed, and a brocade robe fluttered faintly, like a bird with broken wings, as it plunged headfirst into the forest.

Liu Qiao had been reduced to ashes.

Helian Changguang’s eyes filled with disbelief, rage, deep regret, and horror. His once cold and sharp voice turned shrill as he cried out in grief, “You wretched woman...”

Though overwhelmed by sorrow, he did not lose his clarity. The strike he had unleashed earlier had not been something one could take lightly. Yet Li Qinghong had taken it head-on just to kill Liu Qiao. She had almost thrown her own life away in the process.

Helian Changguang said nothing, but his trembling lips betrayed the seething hatred in his heart. He instantly refined the pills buried in his flesh. He bellowed like a tiger as his twin blades swept through the air, casting phantom shadows. Black smoke billowed across the ground and surged forward.

Li Qinghong lifted her spear and released two bolts of lightning shaped like birds. They shot forward, and at nearly the same instant, five more lightning bolts leapt from her spear, bursting into brilliant white sparks.

Pfft.

Helian Changguang took the spear strike head-on and nearly spat blood. Lightning surged through his internal organs, boiling them.

His grip on his blades faltered as he cried out in shock, “You!”

Li Qinghong’s white robes were now covered in radiant purple lightning, streaks of energy spreading from the hem. Her garments had transformed into violet robes, tinged with hues of blood red.

Purple lightning crawled up her neck, tracing patterns across her cheeks. The blood in her hair condensed into tiny beads, suspended in the air under the thunder’s magnetic force. She thrust her spear again. This time, it was with a vastly different level of power.

Huh?

Helian Changguang couldn’t comprehend it. The purple clothed thunder cultivator before him was clearly injured, yet it was as if she had unlocked some hidden power. Her strength had increased by at least fifty percent. The force of her strike left him breathless and his legs numb. He was trembling in fear.

The terrifying lightning before him crushed all will to resist. He had no choice but to swallow his rage and take another hit. His abdomen tore open like tofu, leaving a small hole. Lightning started to spread from the wound.

Helian Changguang exclaimed in horror, “I can’t stall any longer!”

His left eye burst with a pop, and his body transformed into a streak of blood light. It seemed he had activated some pre-prepared spell art, as he rapidly soared upward at breakneck speed.

Li Qinghong reacted just as quickly. Fierce lightning erupted beneath her feet as she flew upward on a thunder surge. One red and one purple trail streaked through the air. Her spear controlled the Five Thunders, launching strike after strike at the blood light, each hit raising puffs of black mist.

The pursuit spanned five kilometers. Helian Changguang’s blood light shrank with each blow, though the demonic aura around him grew thicker. At last, the thunder cultivator halted. She gave him a cold final glance and vanished into the south as a streak of violet light.

Helian Changguang flew several more kilometers before reverting to his original form. He was now just a bare skull connected to a long spine that was dripping blood. His hair, eyebrows, nose, and mouth were gone, leaving only seven dark holes on his face.

He dared not return immediately. He pulled out a corpse he had prepared in advance from his storage. Twisting off the corpse’s head, he pulled out the spine and inserted his own. Then he carved out facial features to save time.

Once he had finished patching together his new body, he finally let out a sigh of relief. Yet flickers of lightning still danced across his flesh.

Both horrified and enraged, Helian Changguang fled in panic, thinking to himself, What... what a terrifying thunder cultivator...

————

Mount Yan Pass.

The devil cultivators were very sharp. They noticed instantly when the two Foundation Establishment Realm devil cultivators in the sky died and fled. The once-loyal horde attacking below instantly dispersed. The cultivators present all sighed in relief, exchanged glances, and were left deeply shaken.

That lightning in the sky just now... was it Fairy Li?

Though the Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators present didn’t have a lot of experience, they had still witnessed Foundation Establishment Realm battles along the way. All were stunned and dazed.

Fei Tongyu murmured, “It was a blur of white, lightning and rain falling, blinding us all... Qinghong... has already reached such a level!”

Fei Tongyu’s shock was understandable. Back then, Li Qinghong had been just a little girl with lower cultivation than his. He could only remain silent.

The others were elated and full of praise, but only Li Minggong harbored faint worry, My lady chased into the demonic cloud all the way... I fear she may have walked into an ambush...

She craned her neck to look, and after only a few dozen breaths, a streak of purple light flew toward the front of the formation. When it halted, it took the form of a violet-robed female cultivator.

A silver spear held up a brocade robe. Her delicate brows framed apricot eyes tinted violet, and faint traces of thunder still glimmered on her cheeks.

Li Qinghong stood there quietly, black hair cascading down. The assembled cultivators hurriedly knelt in respect, utterly convinced of her strength, and shouted in unison, “Greetings, Fairy! Congratulations on your great victory over the devil foe!”

The lightning on Li Qinghong’s body slowly faded, her violet robes returning to white. Spots of blood began to appear, and her eyes returned to their clear black-and-white brilliance.

She spoke with a light, bright voice, “Minggong, come with me inside.”




# Chapter 753: The Immortal Bow Of Bianyan

Li Qinghong rode thunder as she descended into the cave dwelling, forming hand seals to cast a spell that concealed the blood on her back. She still had sixty percent of her mana. She quickly swallowed a few pills to suppress her wounds.

The Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow inside her was still silently circulating, keeping her injuries in check. The demonic energy that had invaded her wounds would normally force ordinary cultivators into emergency seclusion, but her thunder mana dispersed it within five minutes.

After she downed two more pills, a hint of color returned to Li Qinghong’s face.

Helian Changguang was likely a core disciple of a devil cultivator sect. His devil techniques and spell arts were more refined than his partner’s, and he wielded one dharma artifact after another. However, her cultivation was above theirs, and as a lightning cultivator, she could suppress them both.

She had gauged the pair's strength at a glance and had taken an interest in several of their dharma artifacts. But devil cultivators’ escape arts were notoriously tricky. Though she could easily overpower the two, Helian Changguang would flee at the slightest sign of trouble, making it hard to wipe them both out at once.

But Li Qinghong was clever and cunning. When the fight started, she never used her full strength and held back just enough to lull the couple into lowering their guard. Then she suddenly exploded in a single instant, obliterating Liu Qiao in one strike, and then turning her attention to Helian Changguang. She had almost managed to kill the devil sect descendant as well.

But Helian Changguang does have some skill, he still managed to injure me...

She frowned lightly and pressed her forehead. The mana inside her still surged restlessly. Purple light flickered faintly on her cheeks and shoulders, emitting a soft crackling sound.

In the past, Li Yuanjiao had always watched over her, so Li Qinghong was rarely injured. This was perhaps the worst she'd been hurt in decades. The Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow’s circulation boosted her combat power by twenty percent.

So, she had gone all out in the final clash with Helian Changguang. She used the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow’s boost to attack with overwhelming force, stunning Helian Changguang in just a few moves. If he had not followed his instincts to flee immediately, he would’ve died there and then...

As she pondered this, Li Minggong quickly approached and bowed, saying respectfully, “Congratulations...”

Li Qinghong merely waved her off and said softly, “Just listen.”

She took out a purple jade pendant from her robes and handed it to Li Minggong, “Though we’ve repelled the devil cultivators here, I need to check how things stand elsewhere. This jade pendant holds power for three days. If any devil cultivators attack, crush it, and I’ll come immediately.”

Li Qinghong still felt uneasy and reminded her, “Only tell the subordinates that I’m recovering in seclusion, don’t let this matter spread. I'm afraid it may shake morale or lead to an information leak.”

“Minggong understands.” Li Minggong nodded in agreement, then hesitantly said, “But aunt, your wounds haven’t been treated yet, and you’re rushing off to reinforce another location...”

“It’s nothing serious.” Li Qinghong had already suppressed her injuries with pills. There was only a tightness in her chest now. She smiled and said, “I’m at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. One of them was just mid-stage, and the other early stage, what could they possibly do to me?

“Li Wushao’s strength is lacking. I don’t know if he can hold the line. I must see for myself, if we lose that ground, it may cost him his life, as well as Li Wen and An Siming.”

Li Minggong was at a loss for words, and could only respond respectfully, “My cultivation is shallow. I cannot see the full picture. I only hope aunt will prioritize your own safety.”

“Don’t worry.” She instructed Li Minggong to stay vigilant, then rode lightning out of the formation.

Countless lights burst forth in the far northern sky. Blinding golden brilliance and red flames surged violently.

The black clouds in the sky were torn apart for six full seconds before slowly converging again. Li Qinghong looked closely in the direction of Mount Bianyan and saw that water and fire fell together, while gold and wood energies surged. It was likely that several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had fallen simultaneously.

Closer to Mount Bianyan, iIn the western forest, she faintly saw a haze of blood mist. There were crimson droplets of rain drifting down.

“Mount Bianyan has also been attacked... Family uncle and Xizhi might be there...”

Her heart was full of worry. She scanned the scene and, seeing no sign of golden rain in the omen, comforted herself with a few words. Then she flew east for another fifteen minutes. Explosions thundered from a checkpoint where a giant serpent darted through the sky. There, five figures were locked in battle.

Two of them were Azure Pond Sect cultivators, each locked in combat with a devil cultivator. Li Wushao had already assumed his original form, a deep black giant serpent. Twin hooks on his tail howled through the air, as he struggled to resist the golden light unleashed by the buddhist cultivator before him.

There’s even a buddhist cultivator!

Li Qinghong had arrived a bit late; the battle was already at its most intense. Her side was being pushed back and was on the verge of full retreat. Li Wushao’s body was covered in golden seals, and he let out repeated cries of pain.

She brushed her black hair behind her ears and advanced with her spear, unhesitatingly choosing to aid her fellow cultivators. But after flying just a few kilometers forward, she suddenly frowned.

Kongheng is here too...

A new thought sprang up in Li Qinghong’s mind. She concealed her presence and vanished from sight.

Li Wushao was utterly miserable, since he was being thoroughly beaten down by the buddhist cultivator. His body was covered in golden palm prints. Black smoke hissed from them as they burned into his scales. He had to counter with twice as much mana for every bit of mana the opponent used.

The kindly-looking old man was a master monk of the Great Desire Sect. He arrived with gentle words, calling himself Master Monk Yu Xin. He had even complimented Li Wushao’s physique at first sight.

Li Wushao hadn’t believed a word of it. To him, all master monks, except for Kongheng, were lunatics. He’d usually avoid fighting them at all costs, but now, he had no choice but to confront the monk head-on.

Yu Xin fought barehanded, smiling all the while, but his strikes were merciless. A single golden palm had nearly taken half of Li Wushao’s life. Hatred now burned in the snake’s venomous eyes.

If I hadn’t undergone the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique twice... and if Xijun hadn’t used that powerful spirit item to temper my body... I’d have already died at this old bastard’s hands...

But before Li Wushao could feel any relief, the kindly old monk looked at him and began chanting with a low, buzzing tone.

“You!” Li Wushao suddenly felt as though his heart had been shattered by a falling stone. His thoughts stuttered and illusions rose before his eyes. He quickly flicked out his tongue and muttered to himself, “Kongheng told me back then that these guys use Respected Cultivator's Subduing Words. They really do love messing with a demon’s mind. I owe him a thanks when I get back!”

He flicked his tongue again and recited a string of incantations, slowly steadying his mind.

Yu Xin’s eternally benevolent expression finally shifted, and he exclaimed in alarm, “The Dao of the Northern Revered One?! Little serpent, who taught you this?!”

Li Wushao was filled with delight when he saw the old monk lose his composure. He hissed, “Your dad taught your grandpa!”

Yu Xin’s face shifted slightly as he said softly, “Insolent beast... such a foul mouth! Let me subdue you...”

Yu Xin seemed to have lost his temper. Golden light surged from his body, and he thrust his palm forward, forming a golden seal that slammed down on Li Wushao. A terrified Wushao’s scales bristled; only now did he realize that the monk hadn’t even been using his full strength.

“Damn it...”

Li Wushao wanted to curse him even more, but he hastily dodged backward. His body shrank rapidly, slithering downward, but the golden seal shrank as well, trailing closely like a shadow.

Clang...

A crisp sound rang out in midair. Li Wushao began cursing again but felt no pain. He quickly turned around and saw a narrow-eyed monk holding a bronze staff, calmly blocking the attack.

Kongheng!

Li Wushao froze for a moment, then realized Kongheng must have defeated the devil cultivators at his post and rushed over to assist.

He immediately shouted, “Yu Xin! Your dad’s here!”

Kongheng glanced at him with a faint smile and offered a courteous greeting.

Yu Xin’s expression grew solemn as he said reverently, “So it’s a fellow of the ancient path... Yu Xin greets the elder.”

“I dare not claim such a title. I am Kongheng. Greetings to a cultivator of the Great Desire Sect,” replied Kongheng.

Yu Xin, a Master Monk of the Great Desire Sect, gazed intently at him as he said, “A meeting is fated. I only hope to engage the elder in a thorough scripture debate and perfect my Dharma.”

Kongheng responded warmly, “This little monk is no good at debating scripture. Better to leave it be.”

Kongheng had encountered monks of the Great Desire Sect before. They were cultivators who pursued desire as selfhood, mastering the will of their heart. He knew he couldn’t out-argue this old monk, so without another word, he raised his staff and brought it crashing down.

The two clashed in midair, sending golden light flashing all around. Li Wushao, understanding the situation, went to help the two Azure Pond Sect cultivators instead.

Devil cultivators were selfish and cunning by nature. When they saw the tide turn, the two put on a brief show of resistance, then immediately turned to black smoke and fled. Their survival abilities far outstripped those of immortal cultivators. Despite being surrounded, both managed to escape without leaving so much as a single dharma artifact behind.

When Li Wushao turned back, he saw Kongheng and Yu Xin casting spell arts and reciting sacred verses. Golden flowers filled the sky, fluttering down with waves of fragrant scent.

His serpent eyes narrowed. In the yellow dust below, wolves sat silently amid swirling smoke, ignoring the rotting flesh nearby, ears tilted to listen.

The two men and demon beast exchanged a glance and rode the wind to encircle the old monk.

But Yu Xin wasn’t a fool, he had already anticipated it and called out his farewell, “A fortunate meeting today. If time permits, I shall seek the elder again...”

His hollow voice echoed in the desert air. A spell art he had long prepared activated, transforming his body into golden petals that fluttered away and reformed several kilometers away. He was making his escape.

After a full hour of battle, nearly everyone on Li Wushao’s side was injured, and they hadn’t even managed to seize a single Foundation Establishment Realm storage pouch. How could they just let him go? All of them took to the wind in pursuit.

Yu Xin, however, shifted forms repeatedly, flying faster and faster, secretly nodding in satisfaction, “Good old Kongheng. If I could speak with him at length, my cultivation would surely advance. As for this pack of fools... if they keep chasing me, they’ll just be throwing away their lives!”

He arched his long white brows, savoring his success, but his satisfied expression slowly faded. His spiritual sense suddenly stirred, and he gritted his teeth, shouting, “Which fellow cultivator?!”

A figure clad in white, crackling with purple lightning, appeared in front of him, blocking his path with a long spear. The female cultivator said coldly, “Master Monk, where do you think you’re going?”

Yu Xin glanced at her eyes and brows, his heart stirring slightly. He took another look and murmured, “A thunder cultivator...”

Li Qinghong made no attempt at courtesy. Though she asked a question, her lightning spear had already pierced forward.

Yu Xin raised his palm to catch it, utterly dismissive. “The Great Desire Sect is not like the devil sects. I’ve no real fear of your lightning...”

But then thunder boomed. Bright-white sparks burst from Yu Xin’s palm. He cried out in pain and instantly snatched his hand back. When he examined it, he found that his palm had been scorched black.

He immediately grew serious, golden light flaring once more as his expression darkened. Behind him, the Azure Pond cultivators and Kongheng were already closing in.

“Damn it.”

————

Starlight glittered over Moongaze Lake as Li Zhouwei landed atop Qingdu Peak.

The household had emptied out, and Qingdu Peak felt even more deserted. He walked forward a few steps, only finding the elder, Li Xuanxuan, seated within the main hall.

The Li Family had deployed a great many people. Li Xuanxuan had come out of seclusion to find the house mostly empty. He had rushed out to seek Li Xijun, only to find that the young man had already gone out to patrol the lake.

At the moment, he was holding a registry list, frowning as his aged finger traced name after name, counting which branch each belonged to and who their ancestors were.

When Li Zhouwei entered the hall, the old man’s tense wrinkles finally eased upon seeing the treasured heir. His spiritual sense swept over him and said, “Fourth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm already... Good...”

He pointed to the registry and said, “This... your father decided this? Why wasn’t I informed of such a major matter? Why was Yuexiang sent out?!”

“It was Qingdu's direct order.” Li Zhouwei’s broad shoulders sank heavily into the seat as he responded.

Li Xuanxuan simply muttered, “That child, Xijun...”

Li Zhouwei understood; it would only burden Li Xuanxuan with worry to get involved. But the elder continued, “You lot... none of you have pity for your own kin...”

Li Zhouwei quietly listened to the old man’s complaints. Then suddenly, Li Xuanxuan remembered something and said, “Since the Eastern Sea is in such chaos, why not call your uncle Chenghui back?”

Li Zhouwei nodded but did not reply. After holding his breath for a moment, Li Xuanxuan exhaled and asked, “And what’s with that Ning Family fellow pulling so many of our people? I heard the Azure Pond Sect only asked for fifty percent, but he’s taking whatever he pleases... If I were there, I’d show him some real attitude!”

Li Zhouwei cupped his hands and answered simply, “Azure Pond Sect can’t be fully trusted. I’ve only heard that Uncle Xijun received the Radiant Snow Pine Ridge. His cultivation is rising steadily. Ever since then, he doesn’t get angry. As long as the interests are clear, it’s fine.”

Li Xuanxuan paused for a moment, sipped his tea, and sighed repeatedly. Suddenly, a broad-faced middle-aged man at the eighth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm hurried forward from below, carrying a long spear on his back.

This was An Siwei, son of An Zheyan. His younger brother An Siming had gone north, while he had stayed at Li Xijun’s side. He knelt and saluted hastily.

His usually calm face was filled with excitement as he said, “My lord! There’s news from Xu State!”

Li Xuanxuan quickly stood, his old face full of anxiety. He even forgot to put his teacup down and hurriedly asked, “Speak! Wait—where’s Xijun?!”

An Siwei said, “He captured several southbound devil cultivators. He’s interrogating them on the lake and sent me ahead to report!
𝕗𝚛𝚎𝚎𝐰𝗲𝗯𝗻𝚘𝚟𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝕞

“Both devil and buddhist sects are moving south, Dao of Great Desire, Dao of Compassion, Dao of Emptiness... The Tuoba and Murong families, major demon tribes, even the Helian family of Tiefu and the other branch of the Li Family... All the minor families have joined in. Demonic energy surged, and golden light filled the skies...”

An Siwei spoke in a deep voice, “The Murong family and Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of the Great Desire Sect were ambushed midway by the Golden Feather Sect. Azure Pond’s Li Xuanfeng led his forces out of seclusion, intercepted the reinforcements, and routed the northern cultivators...

“My lord drew his bow and, in just fifteen minutes, killed Murong Wu of the Murong Family, wearer of the Black Xuan Armor and Elder Yu Qian of the Buddhist sect... Murong Wu was obliterated, body and soul, and Yu Qian forced into reincarnation...

“After slaying the two, my lord coughed up golden blood and the immortal bowstring snapped. A Great Desire spirit beast lunged in that moment, but my lord sneered, caught it barehanded, and tore it in half... Blood rained across the skies, terrifying twenty-one high-ranking devil and buddhist cultivators into complete silence...

“They say the silence lasted a full six seconds. Not a soul dared speak until the last drop of blood fell...”

An Siwei finished in one breath, his voice trembling with both awe and joy, “Now... now the entirety of Xu State knows of the immortal bow at Mount Bianyan!”




# Chapter 755: First Battle

Li Xuanxuan sat in stunned silence, his hand trembling as it tugged at his white beard. Still half in disbelief, he asked, “Who? Xuanfeng?!”

“It was the lord himself!” An Siwei bowed deeply and replied, “Reporting to Elder, the news is absolutely true!”

“Ah... haha!” Li Xuanxuan let out a laugh and returned to his seat, rubbing the jade teacup in his hand, torn between disbelief and joy as he said, “So... Xuanfeng has already reached such a level! This old man failed to see the full picture, and underestimated him...”

He took a sip of tea, then nodded and said with a smile, “Good! He destroyed Murong Wu’s very soul... Good! He even forced a buddhist cultivator into reincarnation. My brother is truly a man of the highest caliber. It’s only right that he struck such terror into them.”

The old man set his cup down, thinking silently, He spat golden blood... I wonder how serious the injury is...

Only then did he look again at Li Zhouwei, standing to the side with halberd in hand. The boy’s eyes were shining, and he gripped his iron halberd so tightly it seemed he was ready to charge into slaughter at any moment.

Sensing Li Xuanxuan’s gaze, Li Zhouwei lowered his eyes slightly and replied, “My lord’s might is unmatched, and there’s support from within the border. He’ll be fine, without a doubt.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded. Just then, a figure descended at the front of the hall. Clad in flowing white robes, sword at his waist, the man’s expression was caught between joy and worry.

“Xijun,” said Li Xuanxuan.

Li Xijun bowed respectfully, then spoke, “After the last incident, I didn’t dare bring anyone back. I interrogated them on the lake, sent Siwei ahead to report, and stayed behind to clean up the rest.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded silently, a hint of hope in his voice, “Any news? Have you heard anything about Qinghong and Xizhi?”

Li Xijun shook his head, a trace of worry appearing on his face as he replied softly, “The main force there did achieve a great victory, but according to the cultivators who came south, the rest of the front is being dominated by the buddhist and devil cultivators. Many outposts have already fallen, and devil cultivators are flooding south...

“Most of the outposts were raided. The Tuoba Family broke through near Lake Xian. Most buddhist cultivators didn’t dare press forward and retreated, but many devil cultivators took the chance to surge downward. Some followed the Great River east, others west...”

Li Xuanxuan thought for a moment, then murmured, “To the east is open wilderness, but go with the current and you reach Profound Peak Gate. To the west lies the Xiao Family. Only upriver does it lead to our family... not too dangerous yet.”

Li Xijun nodded faintly, his tone growing heavier, “That’s just the north. On the way back, I encountered people from several sects... the south isn’t stable either.”

He found a place to sit nearby and gave Li Zhouwei a slight nod before speaking, “The conflict between Xiukui Dao and Crimson Reef Island is intensifying. Changxiao Gate has been invaded by Hengzhu Dao. They are already several hundred kilometers into their territory... It’s said the Golden Feather Sect even sent mediators, but it achieved nothing...

“And that’s just part of it. Wu State is also in turmoil. The Golden Feather Sect was attacked, and the minor sects across that region are in utter chaos. Four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators have fallen in just three days.

“As for the Eastern Sea, it’s shrouded in dark clouds... all contact with the islands has been lost.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded quietly and said, “I’ve been worried about that too... Chenghui still doesn’t know about Xicheng’s death...”

————

Mount Yan Pass.

Kongheng held his bronze staff and suspended Yu Xin in midair, striking him until his golden palm shrank back.

Yu Xin's expression changed slightly as he said, “You!”

But before he could say more, lightning crashed again from behind. The female lightning cultivator’s strikes were devastating, blackening his dharma body in patches and draining his mana. His head throbbed with pain.

Just when he managed to deflect the thunder with mana, the Hooked Serpent took the chance to gloat, laughing amidst dark smoke. It spat out a bead filled with icy snow, whipping up a howling wind.

The frigid wind cut through the air. Although it was not enough to harm his body, it clouded his spiritual sense, throwing off his movements like a buzzing, relentless fly.

Fortunately, the demonic serpent didn’t dare move in to attack and simply stayed back, stirring the wind. The two Azure Pond Sect cultivators also avoided direct combat, occasionally loosing sneak attacks from afar, easing the pressure slightly.

If they were coordinated... I’d have lost this body already... Growing more anxious, he finally shouted, “Elder Kongheng! You and I both follow the Buddhist Dao, the true Dao of the Golden Lotus... Why do you side with this Purple Mansion and Golden Core Realm heretic?”

Kongheng merely shook his head, tightening his grip, and spoke gently, “That’s not quite right. All Daos have their way upward. As long as one cultivates earnestly... one will attain the golden truth. What right is there to call others heretical?”

As he shattered Yu Xin’s dharma body with blow after blow, Kongheng’s voice remained calm, “But your Seven Daos... they’ve strayed from the Revered One’s original intent. Each believes only their way is true, and all others are mere heresies... That is a delusion born of self-pride, a barrier of the heart.”

He dodged the topic, making Yu Xin increasingly anxious. Yu Xin desperately said, “Fellow cultivators, you can’t kill me anyway... Why damage the dharma body I painstakingly cultivated? I’ll hand over everything on me, how about you show mercy and let this body return?”

His expression darkened as he added coldly, “If you refuse, I’ll destroy this body myself, since I’ll lose it either way! But I’ll make sure you suffer injuries as well!”

The Li Family cultivators remained unmoved. But the two Azure Pond Sect Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators exchanged glances and paused their spells.

One of them said, “Fellow Daoist Qinghong...”

Li Qinghong frowned slightly, feigning indifference and ignoring them for a while. But one of them flew closer and spoke again, forcing her to acknowledge him.

She looked up to see the Azure Pond Sect cultivator wearing a bitter expression, “... Perhaps we should just agree to his terms...”

The two didn’t want to risk injury, nor did they wish to offend a slippery Master Monk too deeply. Yet leaving empty-handed would be too bitter, so they said awkwardly, “Fellow Daoist Qinghong... we’re not from esteemed families like yours. We were conscripted here... we’re just hoping to survive and earn something while at it. We might as well let him go...”

These two were cultivators who had surrendered at sea and joined Azure Pond Sect as guest elders, so their perspectives were different.

Li Qinghong finally lowered her spear and sighed, “Then you may go and speak with him... negotiate the terms.”

Li Qinghong had to consider their stance. After all, several younger cultivators from her family were currently serving under these two and had been well treated. If these two held a grudge, casualties would be unavoidable in future battles.

The two were delighted and stepped forward to speak with Yu Xin. He was overjoyed to keep his body, since it meant preserving fifty or sixty years of cultivation. The three ended up chatting like old friends.
𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝒆𝓵.𝓬𝓸𝒎

After several dozen breaths, Yu Xin pulled out a trove of spirit items from his sleeves, emptying both cuffs completely. He even took off his Dharma robe. Then, when the two weren’t looking, he slipped away on the wind.

The two returned laden with treasures and allowed him to leave. They picked through the items and said with a grin, “Fellow Daoist Qinghong...”

Li Qinghong glanced at them; it was indeed a valuable collection but nothing truly enticing.

She feared there might be some hidden trick behind accepting them, so she responded gently, “You two keep them—it’s fine.”

“But...” The two looked awkward, as if the items were burning in their hands.

Li Qinghong smiled faintly and said softly, “There are a few younger members of my family under your command... I hope you’ll continue looking after them.”

“Of course! Of course!”

The two immediately understood, laughed heartily, and accepted the gift with peace of mind before flying off.

Only then did Kongheng reveal a look of guilt. “Qinghong... I failed to properly guide the juniors...”

Li Qinghong's heart sank as she asked, “Who was it? What happened?”

Kongheng shook his head, voice filled with remorse, “The terrain at my post was lower and got hit much earlier. Devil cultivators appeared as early as this morning...

“My comrades and I went out to meet them in battle. We fought for two hours and just barely held on. The formation beneath us was broken early on... everyone was mixed together, it was chaos...

“Eventually reinforcements arrived from both flanks and drove the devil cultivators back. The city’s defenses were reestablished... but when we counted the casualties, everyone was wounded, and even a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator had fallen.”

He continued softly, “Three Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators from our family died; I’ve kept their names. A late-stage Qi Cultivation cultivator, Li Chengchu, also fell... I gathered his remains in haste before rushing here to help.”

Li Qinghong pursed her lips and asked, “Was his body intact?”

“Only the head remained... his younger brother cried until he fainted...” replied Kongheng.

Li Qinghong said simply, “I’ll go with you to see.”

The Li brothers were among the first to begin training at Mount Qingdu. Chengchu had progressed even faster than his brother. Li Qinghong hadn’t seen much of him herself, but Li Xijun had interacted with him often.

She flew back with Kongheng, and she soon encountered Zhao Tinggui on the city wall , who was hurrying along with several Ning Family cultivators toward the eastern flank.

The man no longer had his former composure. He was dusty and bloodstained. His sword was still dripping with blood and his face was heavy with tension.

When he ran into Li Qinghong, even someone as smooth-tongued as he could only manage a strained smile, “Fellow Daoist Qinghong... my greetings. It’s thanks to your family’s Wanglin Blossom that my junior brother survived.”

Li Qinghong knew full well he likely had plenty of life-saving tools beyond just the Wanglin Blossom, but he was giving her family credit.

She responded kindly, “A late-stage Qi Cultivation cultivator from my family fell. I’m going to recover the remains.”

Her bluntness left Zhao Tinggui speechless. He wiped his sword with a sigh and said, “My condolences, fellow Daoist.”

Li Qinghong quickly asked, “How is the situation at the pass?”

“Not promising...” Zhao Tinggui’s face darkened as he spoke. There was a deep anger in his voice, “The Foundation Establishment Realm guest cultivators from the Eastern Sea were fine... but can you believe a few who grew up under Azure Pond Sect actually trusted what the devil cultivators said?! When the fight wasn’t going in their favor, they really handed over a few of our people to them... thinking it would settle things!

“Ridiculous! It shattered morale among the Qi Cultivation cultivators, and panic and terror spread. Some almost fled on their own! One of them even got ambushed right as the formation opened and barely survived!”

Zhao Tinggui’s face grew even uglier as he said coldly, “And there were those who, after repelling the devil cultivators, let greed get the better of them and chased the enemy for over fifty kilometers! By the time they hesitated and turned back, the formation had already been breached! What kind of nonsense is that?!”

Li Qinghong simply offered calm reassurance, “Jiangnan cultivators were raised inland, where the sects all value reason. They’re easy to confuse or mislead in a crisis, it’s only natural that they fell for it. They can’t compare to the devil cultivators of the Eastern Sea or the north... but given time, they’ll adapt.”

Zhao Tinggui nodded, a hint of envy flashing in his eyes. He sighed, “Qinghong... have you heard? Your family’s elder has already struck fear into the hearts of the devil cultivators!”

————

Mount Bianyan.

White mist coiled thick in the sky. The atmosphere was humid and sticky, and mist condensed on silver armor, turning into sparkling, glinting droplets.

The armor had a silver-gray sheen, its intricate patterns depicting several dragon beasts baring fangs and claws, as if ready to come alive and unleash cold, piercing light. The heavy armor hung in Li Xuanfeng’s hand as he stood silently among the clouds.

Sticky blood trickled down the silver edges of the armor. Moments ago, it had coalesced into a serpent as it attempted to reform. But when it was struck by arrow intent, it scattered into the wind.

The devil and buddhist cultivators stood frozen amidst the black clouds, staring blankly at him.

Murong Wu had been truly powerful. Of all the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators Li Xuanfeng had slain, he ranked near the top. In truth, he was far stronger than Situ Chen of Golden Tang Gate; he was a tough opponent indeed.

When the young devil cultivator had first descended in his armor, his demonic aura had surged to the heavens. The silver armor gleamed brilliantly, and his long saber burned with roaring mana flames.

He had even sneered and said, “Azure Pond Sect wasted all its treasured panaceas on Chi Wei, and now they send some old relic like you to fight?”

This boy is far too arrogant, thought Li Xuanfeng.

He remained expressionless, gave him no chance to act, and shot him down outright. When an unknown buddhist elder tried to intervene, he too was felled with five arrows piercing his skull.

Murong Wu had raged furiously, but he’d already fallen into Li Xuanfeng’s rhythm of the hunt. He was no longer free to come and go. In the end, he had to admit his defeat, lost his halberd, and abandoned his body.

Everyone had expected him to reincarnate from the devil ranks but only black fluid fell from the sky. They were horrified to realize Murong Wu was truly dead.

The fool was careless and got caught in my arrow intent. Both soul and body were turned to ash, how could there be any life left?

He had slain one buddhist, one devil, and even torn a spirit beast in half, yet hadn’t uttered a single boast. He stood there with his snapped golden bowstring, silently and coldly staring at them.

Li Xuanfeng’s gaze swept across the battlefield, leaving all cultivators paralyzed in uncertainty. The aerial duels became distracted, as none dared fall into his hands. The battle shifted into a tense and bizarre stalemate.

The dozen or so fights in the sky all slowed down. Though Li Xuanfeng had only brought seventeen Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who were each slightly weaker than their devil and buddhist counterparts, they were now fighting on equal footing.

The few devil cultivators who had finished their fights now hid in the clouds, unsure whether to retreat or not.

They’re likely going to pull back. Li Xuanfeng’s eyes narrowed, but he saw everything clearly. Though his bowstring was broken and his injuries were heavy, he stood firm in the clouds, That Buddhist elder had held back from the start. He took five arrows and still reincarnated with ease. It was a setup... he wanted Murong Wu dead!

Behind him, Ning Heyuan had finished his battle. It was his first time seeing his brother-in-law fight, and he couldn’t hide his shock.

Ning Heyuan quickly moved to Li Xuanfeng’s side and whispered, “Brother-in-law... be careful of a coordinated strike...”

The tiger-wolf-like spirit beast’s blood still steamed on his armor, its bones already divided among the troops. Li Xuanfeng smiled sardonically. “Now that suspicion runs deep among them, how could they unite to strike me? Give it fifteen minutes. They’ll scatter on their own.”




# Chapter 757: The Merciful One Nuzi

Ning Heyuan responded and stood to the side. Golden light dimmed in the distance as cold black rain fell from the sky. The devil cultivators remained silent, slowly retreating into the clouds.

The faint golden light at the horizon faded. Ning Heyuan calculated for a moment; things on the Golden Feather Sect’s side were likely over. He felt at ease and looked ahead again. The black mist continued to recede, and the aerial battles all ended with the devil cultivators retreating in defeat.

The demonic flames and golden lights all withdrew, and everyone put away their dharma lights, visibly relieved. Li Xuanfeng stowed away his golden bow and hovered in mid-air until the devilish clouds finally dispersed completely.

"Return to Mount Bianyan." Li Xuanfeng ordered, and everyone quickly responded, flying back together on the wind, exchanging glances filled with both awe and fear.

Unlike the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators conscripted from below, those stationed at the passes guarded by Li Qinghong were cultivators summoned from esteemed families of the Eastern Sea and the southern border. They were all Daoists or even peak masters of the Azure Pond Sect. At this moment, they all wore grave expressions.

We’d heard before that Daoist Master Yuan Su had a golden bow-wielding Li Xuanfeng under his command. Even Ning Heyuan couldn’t order him around, and he only carried out deadly tasks...

At the time, we thought it just meant he was valued by the Daoist Master because he was likely strong... but seeing him now, he’s truly a star of slaughter...

The Daoists had originally only acted out of courtesy to the Ning Family, following orders to defend the pass, though some of them had held doubts. Now, none of them spoke as they flew out beyond the pass.

Once they flew out, Li Xuanfeng turned around, still holding the coldly gleaming armor in his hand, and said in a low voice, “Thank you for coming out of the mountain with me. Please return to your respective posts to guard the passes!”

Everyone answered in unison. Some left in pairs and others alone as they headed to different parts of the mountains. Li Xuanfeng led the Ning Family members back and landed at the great formation within the mountain.

He finally descended as Fei Yihe hurriedly came up to him. Li Xuanfeng removed his armor, revealing bloodied cracks in his palm. He had fought too fiercely, and even his post-talisman-enhanced body was struggling to hold up.

Li Xuanfeng stared at his palm with gray eyes, using his mana to seal the wound and force the blood back into his body. He asked softly, “How is the pass holding?”

Fei Yihe, naturally understanding what he meant, answered in the same soft tone, “The devil cultivators attacked from the south but were intercepted; the east suffered little damage. Baixiang Valley remains calm, while Yan Pass did face an assault. But Qinghong killed one of them. She’s now outside the pass.”

"Not bad." A rare smile appeared on Li Xuanfeng’s face as he took out the longbow.

Ning Heyuan gently received it, along with Li Xuanfeng’s armor, and softly said, "I’ll have someone repair this for you, Brother-in-law."

He retreated with the Ning Family people, and only then did Li Xuanfeng speak softly, "Have Qinghong wait in the mountains, I’ll go see her shortly."

He dismissed Fei Yihe as well. His organs still burned like fire, so he took out a few pills and swallowed them, meditating briefly. A cool sensation slowly eased into his body, and after coughing up a few mouthfuls of black blood, he felt much more at ease.

Li Xuanfeng sat quietly to recover, thinking, Killing a direct descendant of the Murong Family has significantly shifted the balance. This matter won’t die down so easily... There will definitely be more trouble ahead. I’ll have to be ready.

Meanwhile, Fei Yihe, filled with excitement now that he had Li Xuanfeng’s order, boldly sought out the Ning Family people and calmly said, "Please ask Daoist Qinghong to await orders at General Peak."

Although Fei Yihe was senior to Li Qinghong in age, he had no background and low cultivation. He held no right to speak of seniority here. Were it not for carrying a message, he would normally address any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator as senior, let alone someone like Li Qinghong, a rising star in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The Ning Family members ahead looked down on him, but still respected Li Xuanfeng’s name and nodded in assent. The old man hurried to the peak, thinking to himself, Li Qinghong is wise and gentle. She’s the kindest among the Li Family. Now that she’s here in the mountains, she surely knew I was with the general, there's a good chance she brought Tongyu with her...

After a short wait, a slightly pale Li Qinghong entered. She wore an ordinary white robe and looked somewhat weary.

As Fei Yihe expected, behind her stood Fei Tongyu, who had come with her from Moongaze Lake. His eldest son no longer bore the gentle elegance and charm he had when he left home. Now, he looked haggard and worn, like a completely different person.

Fei Tongyu also seemed injured. His neck was bruised and pale, his eyes deeply sunken, and his cheeks gaunt. The fan he always carried was gone, replaced by a short spear clenched tightly in his white-knuckled hands.

If the old man hadn't recognized him with spiritual sense, he wouldn't have known who he was. He stood there in a daze and simply asked, "Tongyu?"

Fei Tongyu jerked his head up like he’d been shocked, looked at him twice, and asked, "And you are...?"
𝙛𝒓𝓮𝒆𝔀𝒆𝙗𝓷𝒐𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝓶

Li Qinghong had expected this scene. She simply said, “You two talk,” and stepped out of the hall.

The evening breeze blew in with a cold and biting mist. The muffled sound of father and son sobbing in each other’s arms from within the hall. Li Qinghong stood in the wind, arms folded, allowing her white robe to flutter.

Her black hair flowed gently. After several breaths of time, a man approached with a seal hanging at his waist.

He looked at her with some surprise and smiled, "I’ve always seen you in armor. This is the first time I’ve seen you in a skirted robe."

It was none other than Ning Heyuan, who was also in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Li Qinghong simply smiled and shook her head. "I don’t place much importance on things like that."

Li Qinghong had always been this way; she had never taken youth-preserving pills nor used any treasured panaceas. Ning Heyuan nodded in agreement, but then golden lights began to appear in the sky, trailing fiery tails as they hovered and flickered unpredictably.

"The people from the Golden Feather Sect are here!" Ning Heyuan furrowed his brow. He saw a streak of golden light wait briefly at the edge of the formation. The light entered the formation, circled twice and landed before them, transforming into a golden-robed woman.

She lowered her gaze, half her face veiled by golden gauze. Her expression was composed as she spoke gently, "Fellow Daoist Heyuan, I hope I may see Li Xuanfeng."

"Fairy Duanyan..." Ning Heyuan recognized her at once. She was a junior who served by the side of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Golden Feather Sect.

He immediately nodded, not daring to delay, and went into the cave dwelling. It didn’t take long for him to bring Li Xuanfeng out.

Li Xuanfeng had been meditating for long enough to somewhat recover. When he heard that someone from the Golden Feather Sect was asking for him, he instantly thought, So they’ve come, just as expected!

He calmly donned his armor and stepped outside. His gaze was steady, and his presence commanding without anger.

Once he was in front of the golden-robed woman, he gave a slight nod and cupped his fists, "Greetings, Fairy."

Zhang Duanyan cultivated the Immortal Foundation technique Golden Aperture Heart, which made her extremely perceptive. The moment she saw him, she felt a sudden tightness in her chest, as she felt the sheer ferocity radiating from him, and thought, This senior must have slain more Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators than one could possibly count...

Zhang Duanyan extended a portion of the golden light beneath her feet and said politely, "Senior has rendered a great service. My sect’s Daoist Master wishes to meet with you, please come with me."

Li Xuanfeng knew there was no room to refuse. He simply nodded, stepped onto the light, and rose into the air with her.

Zhang Duanyan added politely, "Senior! My grandfather is Zhang Yun, who was once an old acquaintance of a senior from your esteemed family..."

She continued to converse diplomatically to avoid an awkward silence as they ascended into the clouds.

At last, Li Xuanfeng asked in a deep voice, "May I ask which Daoist Master has summoned me?"

Li Xuanfeng had encountered more Daoist Masters than most, likely even more than members of the Chi Family.

When he posed the question, Zhang Duanyan simply smiled and said, "Look up, and the Daoist Master is right before you."

Sure enough, radiant golden light was emerging from the clouds. A rosy cloud floated in the air, and upon it sat a woman in yellow robes and a gauzy veil. Her white hand held two intertwined golden rings.

"Greetings, Daoist Master Qiushui!" Li Xuanfeng recognized her immediately. She was none other than Daoist Master Qiushui of the Golden Feather Sect, who had intervened during the fall of Yuan Su.

It was said that she had reached the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. She sat lightly upon the clouds and slowly removed her veil. Zhang Qiushui’s face looked no older than sixteen or seventeen, and had a rounded chin with large, bright, gentle eyes.

She spoke softly, "When I heard the news, I thought, of course it was you. There are only two or three in all of Azure Pond Sect’s domain who are this fierce."

Though both were old acquaintances of Yuan Su, Daoist Master Qiushui was clearly much easier to speak with than Daoist Master Zipei, and appeared more gentle as well.

Li Xuanfeng responded in a low voice, and she said with a smile, "After all, you're a direct descendant of Wei's Li. Whether it's Li Chejing or Li Tongya, along with your immortal bow and bearing, everything clearly shows... there's no doubt you're a direct descendant."

Li Xuanfeng could not respond, but Zhang Qiushui didn’t give him a chance to. Suddenly, she turned to the side, where a stern looking mature-faced cultivator in green robes revealed himself.

She spoke simply, "Daoist Yuan Xiu has arrived."

Daoist Yuan Xiu merely nodded and waited silently.

Zhang Qiushui turned back to Li Xuanfeng. "You needn’t fear. It’s just some entanglement with buddhist cultivators... Before Wei, there was Zhou. Then, Qi, Liang, and the Tuoba Family. All are still renowned. Zhao has yet to suppress any of them..."

She even laughed aloud. A stern Yuan Xiu interjected, "The emperor from the Fuqi Family couldn’t even protect his own soul, how could he harm anyone else?"

Zhang Qiushui reined in her smile and finally said, "Murong Wu’s storage pouch, has it been touched? Give it to me."

Li Xuanfeng had kept it with him the whole time. He presented it with both hands.

Zhang Qiushui examined the pouch, saw it had not been tampered with, and nodded in approval. "Xu State isn't worth much. You made a few of the Merciful Ones suffer slight losses. That gives me leverage, so of course I must reward you."

She looked to Daoist Yuan Xiu. After a brief moment, he finally took out a jade vial from his sleeve and said solemnly, "A reward is fitting. This Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill was a gift from Daoist Master Qiushui to me. Take it and use it."

A pill... Li Xuanfeng bowed and gave thanks, receiving it gently.

When the two Daoist Masters fell silent, the golden-robed Zhang Duanyan quickly caught on and softly said, "Allow me to escort you down, senior."

Li Xuanfeng took his leave with a salute and descended on the clouds alongside the composed young woman. As they traversed the skies, he pondered deeply, uneasy at how accommodating the two Daoist Masters had been.

He thought, Is this a blessing or a curse? What exactly does this pill do? Is it meant to help me ascend, making me a stronger piece in their great void struggle? Or is it something else entirely, like an attempt to bind my life with this pill?

As he brooded, Zhang Duanyan suddenly smiled beside him. "Senior... My grandfather holds great admiration for Senior Tongya. He’s mentioned him to me often. Now he’s in seclusion attempting a breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. When he emerges, he intends to visit your family."

Li Xuanfeng paused, thoughtful. Zhang Duanyan silently escorted him to the peak, then rode a beam of golden light upward, vanishing swiftly into the wind-blown horizon.

————

Within the clouds.

Li Xuanfeng had long departed, but Zhang Qiushui stood silently. She was clearly colder toward Daoist Yuan Xiu than Li Xuanfeing. Though she still maintained a habit of smiling and speaking politely, the warmth was replaced by caution.

Before either of them could act, the great void suddenly tore open, and a massive golden figure burst forth. The golden body had four arms and four legs, with two faces on its neck. One of the faces was grinning fiercely while the other was weeping mournfully. Both were adorned with beautiful, intricate markings. The four arms held a variety of weapons, a club, a staff, a saber, and a sword, each glowing with radiant light.

The buddhist cultivator was followed by a golden-bodied Arhat[1]. He was broad and muscular, clad in gleaming golden armor. His face was dignified, and four keen eyes glowed beneath his eyebrows. He held a long staff in both hands.
𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝒆𝓵.𝓬𝓸𝒎

Zhang Qiushui’s expression immediately turned cold. She said softly, "So it's you, The Merciful One Nuzi... coming all the way out from the great void to find us. What matter could be so urgent?"

The Merciful One’s four eyes moved independently. Both mouths opened at once, one weeping, the other groaning. The voices overlapped in a blend of sorrow and agony, "I thought surely the Daoist Master would want to meet one destined to be connected with me. So I came. But alas, the timing was off. It seems I arrived just too late."

Now, not only did Zhang Qiushui wear a frosty expression, but even Yuan Xiu’s stern face openly displayed disgust.

He said coldly, "What now? The Merciful One already has a Vajra of innate divine strength, and still wants a mighty Arhat? You've cultivated quite the greedy heart!"

The Merciful One seemed entirely unaffected by the insult. The overlapping voices continued, now with a hint of mirth, "This is all due to fate. You two are attached to form... This person is simply destined to follow my Dao."

Yuan Xiu seemed to loathe the Merciful One beyond measure. His thick eyebrows bristled as he snapped, "Heretical scum! Shameless beyond belief! When Yuan Su was alive, you never dared peek this way. Now that he’s fallen, you think you can come here with your greedy thoughts?"

The Merciful One closed all four eyes and replied, "Anger harms the soul, Daoist Master... take care. There was no destiny before, but now destiny has arrived. How can the two be compared?"

He smiled faintly at the visible rage in both Daoist Masters. Then, without another word, he tore open the great void and slipped inside.

Yuan Xiu’s face darkened as he shouted, "Nuzi! If you dare to tempt anyone from my sect, I’ll let you taste the power of the Profound Yellow Dao Talisman! I’ll seal your dharma body and send you crawling off to reincarnate!"

Zhang Qiushui said nothing. She kept her eyes fixed coldly on the great void. Only after The Merciful One disappeared did she softly remark, "I thought Tiaoxiao had beaten some sense into him... But it hasn't been long, and he stirs again. Such is the nature of buddhist cultivators."

The pitch-black storage pouch hovered gently at her side. Daoist Yuan Xiu nodded, then raised his hand and lightly pushed forward. Instantly, everything before them dimmed. The world lost all color and descended into boundless darkness. They had entered the great void.

Waves of demonic energy entwined with golden light surged before them, churning and twisting in the great void. A three-headed, six-armed form flickered in and out of sight within the haze. Runes and lotus-shaped dharma artifacts floated above countless eyes staring from the depths.

On the other side, bright and pure auras shimmered, with divine radiance weaving through the air. Several figures stood quietly in opposition to The Merciful One and the demonic entity. As the two Daoist Masters stepped into the void, rainbow-hued light began to shimmer around them as well.

# Chapter 759: Reforging Dharma Artifacts

Li Xuanfeng landed on the peak and saw everyone looking up at him. He noticed many unfamiliar faces among them. Ning Heyuan stood at the front, hands clasped behind his back, his expression relaxed and eyebrows slightly lifted, concealing a trace of pride.

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly, and Ning Heyuan immediately stepped forward and said softly, "Congratulations, Brother-in-law..."

He stepped aside, revealing the man behind him. It was Chi Zhiyan, younger brother of Sect Master Chi Zhiyun. The man had a somewhat sinister appearance and narrow eyes, which he opened bigger only upon seeing Li Xuanfeng.

He smiled and said, "Daoist, your archery is truly formidable! To kill Murong Wu in just a quarter of an hour, our eyes have been thoroughly opened!"

Chi Zhiyan, nearly the highest-ranking person present, gestured for him to enter for a more private discussion. His tone remained courteous as he asked, "Which Daoist Masters did you meet?"

"Daoist Masters Qiushui and Yuan Xiu..." Li Xuanfeng answered as he stepped forward. He stood a head taller than Chi Zhiyan, who looked up and met his eyes. Li Xuanfeng continued in a deep voice, "The Daoist Masters gifted me a pill, offered much encouragement, and said little else."

Chi Zhiyan seemed to be thinking deeply. He lowered his head and, after a moment, asked, "And what sort of immortal pill was it?"

"A Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill..." Li Xuanfeng spoke the name as he searched Chi Zhiyan’s face. The man’s eyes were blank, and he seemed to ponder it repeatedly, as though he had never heard the name before.

"Which Daoist Master gave it to you?" asked Chi Zhiyan.

"Daoist Master Yuan Xiu." Li Xuanfeng replied and, seeing that Chi Zhiyan still looked utterly puzzled, thought to himself, Chi Zhiyan probably has no idea what it is...

He answered a few more of Chi Zhiyan’s questions perfunctorily. Once enough courtesy had been shown, he finally said, "I’ve just come from a fierce battle and am wounded... Forgive me for not staying longer. Once I finish healing and stabilize my qi, I’ll take the pill."

Chi Zhiyan could only nod and retreat. Ning Heyuan bustled in shortly after. Li Xuanfeng had only managed to suppress his injuries after half an hour of treatment, but the exertions along the way had caused his organs to ache again, and his face was slightly pale.

He simply took out Murong Wu’s helmet and armor and tossed them to the ground. Instantly, dharma light shimmered across the jade tiles. He said softly, "Have this armor reforged. Find a few artifact smiths to present a couple of designs for re-casting. I'll choose one or two."

Ning Heyuan nodded lightly. Li Xuanfeng quickly made his way down and saw Li Qinghong waiting in the hall.

When she saw him approach, she looked at him with concern. "Second uncle, how are your injuries?"

Li Xuanfeng merely exhaled and waved it off. Seeing his expression, Li Qinghong quickly explained how she had injured Helian Changguang and took two items out from her storage pouch.

One was a dark green fan with intricate patterns and densely inscribed spells, arranged in five distinct totem-like motifs. Its style was refined, but carried a hint of opulence.

The other item was a white brocade robe with long turquoise feathers at the shoulders. It had previously been worn by a devil cultivator and was shrouded in demonic energy, concealing its features. Now that it was revealed, it looked ethereal. However, it was slightly faded, since it had been scorched by lightning.

Li Xuanfeng listened carefully, then activated the array in the hall and said, "Qinghong, the Helian Family is of royal blood in the Tiefo State, north of Zhao. From your description, Helian Changguang holds some status. To fight two and kill one on your own is not an easy feat."

His old eyes beneath his brows were still sharp. He stood with arms crossed; even in his injured state, his voice was crisp and firm, "But offending that man isn’t a good thing. I’ll make a note of it. Stay within the pass for now and cultivate. When I make a circuit eastward, I’ll find him and shoot him before he has time to hold a grudge."

Li Qinghong was taken aback. Though she wasn’t afraid of the man, she had family in the pass and couldn’t remain constantly on guard. There was some risk.

Still, unwilling to trouble Li Xuanfeng too much, she replied, "Thank you, second uncle... but your own matters are more important."

Li Xuanfeng only shook his head and said with a slightly hoarse voice, "Even if you weren’t the strongest in the family, you would be going regardless. Killing a single devil cultivator isn’t an issue."

He didn’t say more. After a closer look, he pointed at the two dharma artifacts and said, "The Helian Family has deep foundations; these two dharma artifacts are of decent quality. I know you’re uneasy wielding them. Go find Ning Heyuan and have him assign someone to escort you to the central region to have them reforged."

Li Xuanfeng paused, then gave special instructions, "Don’t reforge them on Mount Bianyan. There are too many eyes and too many complications. I’ll have Murong Wu’s armor remade and delivered home to the younger generation."

Li Qinghong understood that by ‘younger generation,’ he meant Li Zhouwei. She nodded and kept it in mind. Li Xuanfeng already looked tired as he waved his hand and started to make his way out. Li Qinghong accompanied him out of the hall, thinking to herself, Second uncle’s authority grows heavier by the day.

She went to find Ning Heyuan, who was now quite enthusiastic. He brought several artifact smiths under his command and specifically introduced one, a burly old man in red robes.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝐰𝚎𝕓𝐧𝚘𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝕞

Ning Heyuan said with a smile, "This is Daoist Chu, he once practiced at the Moongaze Lake Market. He’s an old acquaintance of my brother-in-law!"

Li Qinghong nodded. She understood what Li Xuanfeng meant about the mountain being crowded with watching eyes. She had already grown restless, so she didn’t exchange many words with Daoist Chu before hurriedly taking her leave with him.

She brought along Fei Tongyu, who still looked weary and dispirited. The three of them flew off together.

As they flew, Li Qinghong quickly offered an apology and asked, "The matter is urgent, so I dared not linger. May I ask for your name, fellow Daoist?"

"Chu Minglian." The old man laughed heartily, clasped his hands behind his back, puffed out his chest, and replied with great gravitas, "Back in my youth, I refined artifacts at the Moongaze Lake Market. The Golden Age Longbow that Xuanfeng wields was crafted by none other than myself!

"Even sword immortals came to my shop to stock up before heading home!"

This was clearly Chu Minglian’s favorite boast, one he shared with everyone he met. After a round of hearty laughter, Li Qinghong’s eyes suddenly lit up with anticipation as she asked, "Then, senior, have you ever seen my father, Li Xuanling?"

"Li Xuanling...? I've heard of Li Xuanxuan... but never Li Xuanling," he replied.

Chu Minglian looked slightly embarrassed. Li Qinghong quickly added, "He is the son of the Celestial Moon Sword."

"Oh!" Chu Minglian’s demeanor instantly turned solemn, and he nodded, "So you are the granddaughter of Li Tongya..."

He recalled fondly, "Of the three who came back then, he alone looked like a mere escort. I vaguely remember his broad shoulders. Who would've thought he was such a remarkable figure?"

The two continued smiling as they chatted, and soon returned to the inner pass. They saw Kongheng pacing around from a distance, scanning the area, but there was no sign of Li Wushao.

Li Qinghong casually asked and learned that there was a Foundation Establishment Realm female cultivator within the central valley whose mount was a white Hooked Serpent. Li Wushao hadn’t seen another of its kind in decades and couldn’t restrain his excitement, so he went to pay a visit.

The news surprised Li Qinghong a little. She chuckled softly, then led Chu Minglian and Kongheng forward before bringing out the two dharma artifacts.

Chu Minglian examined them carefully, but Kongheng was the first to speak, his voice thoughtful, "This fan looks like something from the Helian Family. As for the robe... hard to say, but it carries an ancient aura."

Chu Minglian paused, slightly surprised by the monk’s sharp insight. He then showed his own depth of knowledge and said softly, "I've never been to the north, so I can’t speak much on the fan. But the robe, there’s definitely something to it."

He lifted the snowy-white robe, examined the turquoise feathers on its shoulders, and carefully studied the patterns embroidered on it before speaking in a low voice, "There is a ninety percent chance this is from the Wanglin Sect of Ning State."

Wanglin Sect...

Li Qinghong had heard of that immortal sect before; her family’s Wanglin Blossom technique also originated from them. But a sudden doubt rose in her heart, He claims to be a rogue cultivator... yet his knowledge is so precise. It seems his inheritance must be a long-standing one...

Chu Minglian examined the robe carefully, clicking his tongue in admiration before continuing, "The Wanglin Sect is composed mostly of women. This dharma robe reflects that delicate feminine touch. They’ve long followed the ancient system of separating sect halls by region. The thirty-six feather patches arranged in two rings likely represent the various sub-temples under their governance."

Li Qinghong listened intently and nodded, "Senior, your insight is impressive... May I ask, what is the strength of this sect?"

"They call themselves an upper sect, so of course they have Golden Core Realm cultivators." Chu Minglian sighed, as though suddenly remembering something, and added, "My Chu family originally came from Jiangbei, so naturally, I know of them..."

"Chu... the Chu family from which prefecture?"

Only now did Li Qinghong realize that Chu Minglian had a family background too. She had thought him to be from a minor lineage, which would have explained his lack of reputation. But since he had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, he ought to have belonged to a proper cultivation family.

Chu Minglian’s aged eyes narrowed slightly as he adjusted his red robes. A hint of melancholy touched his voice as he answered, "It was once a small family... but now there’s no Chu Family left to speak of."

His expression dimmed further as he added, "My grandnephew... his name was Chu Yi, the Li Fire Spear."

Chu Yi!

The name had faded into history for decades, yet it was still whispered among cultivators. Those who had lived through it remembered with unease. He was a rogue cultivator who caused chaos, forced open the long-sealed Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven of the Dongli Sect, and singlehandedly stirred a storm that shook the entire Yue State.

The Li Family had benefited greatly from that event. The jade vial on Li Qinghong’s waist was most likely an item from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven and of ancient provenance.

"He had posed as a rogue cultivator back then, but offended the Han Family, who uncovered the truth in secret. He was still in seclusion when calamity struck our home."

Chu Minglian seemed unwilling to dwell further on it. But clarity dawned in Li Qinghong’s heart, So it was this Chu! The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven incident stirred such chaos... Most likely, he recovered his memories and went to Mount Luoxia, never to return... No wonder Chu Minglian feels so disheartened.

Though she understood, Li Qinghong didn’t wish to press further. She sighed and remained silent.

Chu Minglian quickly regained his cheer and said, "This brocade fan isn’t much. One glance is enough to reveal that it’s a crude collaboration between a northern buddhist cultivator and a devil cultivator. I can reforge it with a few materials. Give me a few months and it’ll be usable.

"As for this robe..."

Chu Minglian examined it again with great care, then spoke seriously, "I see many poorly crafted additions. This robe was likely lost from an immortal sect, then passed through the hands of several devil cultivators who added and patched it over time, either due to damage or blind tampering, until it is what it is now.

"I’ll just remove those faulty patches and repair it according to the original markings. It’ll take half a year or so, and once done, it’ll be much better than its current state. I’ll need some Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items though, depending on what can be gathered."

Chu Minglian accepted the task with great confidence. Li Qinghong recalled the many spirit items Li Xijun had given her and laid them out one by one on the table.

Chu Minglian examined the spirit items thoroughly and confidently said, "If you trust me, leave it to me. I’ll trade some of these, get more materials from the mountains, and if it’s still not enough, I’ll ask you for more later."

Li Qinghong nodded readily and politely saw him off. Kongheng followed beside her, a hint of worry in his expression as he quietly asked, "Daoist Qinghong... did you kill someone from the Helian Family?"

"I didn’t quite kill him... but it was close. We met on the battlefield and there was no way out." Li Qinghong answered casually.

Kongheng followed behind, feeling a quiet unease as he thought to himself, Could fate have intertwined their paths? The Helian Family’s ancestors were once a border tribe of Wei State... and received favors long ago...

As the thought lingered, he chuckled inwardly, It’s been so many years... I’m overthinking it. Always reading too deeply into fate and karma. Now I’ve gone and entangled myself in it too.

————

Mount Qingdu.

Li Xijun received the remains of those who had returned from the north. He collected the bones of Li Chengchu, then examined the other corpses one by one. Two were from lesser branches, one from the Chen Family, two from the Xu Family, and one from the Dou Family.

Li Xijun had watched Li Chengchu grow up. He was quiet, reserved, and a fast cultivator. Now, as he looked at his cold remains, all Li Xijun could do was sigh.

The Ning Family had offered some compensation. Li Xijun, on behalf of the family, also provided a stipend and arranged for the remains to be returned to their respective families. Under the clear moonlight, he silently reflected, This is only the beginning.

He had received word from Li Qinghong. She and Li Xuanfeng were only lightly wounded. Li Xizhi’s Baixiang Valley had also been among the few places untouched by conflict, which gave Li Xijun a measure of relief.

But it’s still Brother Xizhi’s side that worries me more... They haven’t been attacked yet, but they’re facing the Tuoba Family. If anyone comes for them, it won’t be a simple matter.

As he mulled, Chen Donghe came rushing up, gave a quick bow, and said gravely, "A monk has appeared in Lijing Town!"

Li Xijun’s heart skipped a beat. He quickly rose from the main seat. Though he had long been prepared for this, tension still surged through him.

He strode out of the hall and asked, "What’s the situation? Can you tell who he is?"

The Li Family’s great formation only protected a few immortal peaks. It was pure fantasy to think it could cover the dozens of towns around Moongaze Lake. Those outlying areas had only basic warding arrays and cultivators rotating day and night patrols.

These measures could detect low-level devil cultivators, but if a Foundation Establishment Realm buddhist or devil cultivator slipped into town, they would almost certainly go undetected. Only strange movements might trigger a response.

Li Xijun had long suspected that some Master Monk would eventually infiltrate a town to gather information. He had placed guards everywhere, so that any disturbance would be noticed.

So he asked two quick questions, "Did he kill anyone? Or confuse minds?"

Chen Donghe shook his head and replied solemnly, "The monk is just sitting in the restaurant in town. He asked someone to send word that he wishes to see the Li Family’s steward.

"The townsfolk, startled by his sudden appearance in monk’s robes, were both frightened and uneasy. They sent someone to inform the mountain immediately. I happened to be patrolling nearby and rushed here with the news."




# Chapter 761: Old Acquaintance

Lijing Town.

Lijing Town was now the largest town by the lake; it even surpassed Milin Town at the center of Milin Prefecture. The area had been ravaged beyond recognition, and since the Li Family no longer acknowledged the Milin prefectural system, they had divided the region into several towns for separate governance. Now that the population was spread out, none of the other towns could compare to Lijing Town.

The restaurant was bustling with noise. People moved up and down the pale red wooden steps, while a monk sat alone at the highest level. His head was cleanly shaven and his eyes were quietly fixed on his wine cup.

Those who dined and drank in this place were not ordinary folk; most were scions of prestigious families. Several guests kept anxiously glancing over, unease in their hearts. After a quarter of an hour, they hastily ended their banquets and scattered in all directions.

Soon, the upper level of the restaurant was deserted, and even passersby grew sparse. Cultivators in white armor began appearing among the thinning crowd. Li Chenghuai arrived with his men and ascended the stairs without hesitation.

Since the Li Family was currently undergoing many personnel changes, there were numerous vacancies. As both his cultivation and age had reached the necessary threshold, Li Chenghuai now served under his cousin Li Chengliao. As the direct son of Li Xizhi, he was someone Li Chengliao frequently relied upon.

But just as he entered the building, he was promptly stopped by a middle-aged man in white robes. The man had a rather handsome face and had the calm demeanor of someone in his middle years.

An Siwei’s presence was imposing, and his expression was serious as he spoke softly, "You are of the Qingdu bloodline, Young Master. It's not appropriate for you to go in person. Allow me to meet him instead."

Chen Yang stood behind An Siwei, dressed in black, his brows slightly close-set and his eyes flickering with unease and suspicion. Li Chenghuai clasped his hands in acknowledgment and nodded, letting the two of them proceed.

When they climbed the crimson steps, they saw the monk still seated at the table, which was now filled with fine wine and meats. It seemed he had gathered them from the hastily abandoned tables nearby. It was an awkward sight.

He didn’t eat. He only poked at the food with his chopsticks and stared blankly into space.

When he saw the two approach, An Siwei clasped his hands and spoke in a soft tone, “Greetings, master. I am An Siwei of the Li Family... I wonder, master...”

The monk had slightly short eyebrows. Though his face was clean and bright, and his hair completely shaven, there was still a faint trace of a hardened, resolute air about him.

He gently tapped his jade chopsticks together and finally spoke, “An Siwei of the Li Family... Quite capable indeed...”

His voice was hoarse, carrying a hidden chill that did not show on the surface. An Siwei grew suspicious at his cryptic reply and asked, “Forgive my ignorance, master. I cannot grasp your Zen words. What do you mean...”

The monk poured himself a drink and replied quietly, “They once said Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan were so ambitious that they seemed like wolves in human skin. I never believed it, but looking at the outcome now... perhaps it wasn’t so unbelievable after all.”

The wine let out a chime as it splashed into the jade cup. An Siwei could detect the disrespect in his words and felt displeased, replying curtly, “It seems this master has heard some rumors... but the times shift and the Mandate of Heaven changes hands. A single judgment cannot define the outcome.”

The monk let out a cold, dismissive laugh at the mention of the Mandate of Heaven and asked, “Who is An Jingming to you?”

An Siwei’s expression darkened at the question. After a moment, he replied, “He was my elder brother.”

A cold wind suddenly swept through the building as a young man in white robes appeared.

He raised his sword-like brows slightly. “I am Li Xijun. Greetings, Master Monk.”

Though the Li Family did not follow the Dao of Buddhism, they could still roughly judge a person’s strength. Li Xijun could feel the monk’s heavy and oppressive presence; he carried a clear sense of threat. A trace of wariness rose in his heart.

The monk remained seated, and replied hoarsely, “Xu Mu of the Five-Eyed Temple. Greetings, fellow cultivator.”

It’s him...

Li Xijun was familiar with the name. A few days ago, they had captured two people, and the old Daoist Fu Yuan of Mount Xiaoshi had clearly been influenced by the Five-Eyed Merciful One. It seemed this monk had deliberately released him to probe for information.

That monk’s name had been mentioned, and it was indeed Xu Mu.

Li Xijun spoke with a faintly cold tone, “Master Monk, your methods are impressive indeed. Borrowing the bodies of cultivators to spy upon others...”
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝒆𝒘𝙚𝓫𝙣𝙤𝒗𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

Xu Mu waved his hand dismissively and replied calmly, “A mere trick, nothing more.”

He stared at Li Xijun’s brows and eyes for a moment, as if trying to recall something, then spoke, “I once entrusted something to your esteemed family. I wish to meet Li Xuanxuan... Is he still alive?”

Li Xijun remained silent for a moment, then gestured to An Siwei, who quickly departed toward Qingdu.

Master Monk Xu Mu pointed to the seat opposite him and smiled, “Xijun, please have a seat for now.”

He continued, “Even in the North, I heard of Li Tongya. He did great things... Such a pity that he fell in the end. Grudges and debts, aren’t they all meaningless in the end?”

Li Xijun stayed guarded, wary of any hidden intent in his words, and chose not to reply. Xu Mu, undisturbed, pulled a copper sword from his sleeve.

Its cold gleam illuminated his face as he spoke softly, “In our youth, he and I once crossed blades. Back then, I still had a worldly name.”

He flipped the sword over and said in a quiet voice, “Yu Mujian.”

At that moment, the restaurant fell utterly silent. It was so quiet one could hear a pin drop. The atmosphere turned eerie. Chen Yang stood to the side, every hair on his body standing on end. It felt as if he were balanced on the edge of a blade, caught between advancing and retreating.

Li Xijun’s expression remained calm. He placed one hand on his sword and spoke softly, “So it’s you, senior.”

Xu Mu didn’t respond, and the atmosphere sank into heaviness once more.

Creak.

An old man hurried up the stairs. Li Xuanxuan was holding an axe-shaped dharma artifact that hadn’t been used in decades. His robe was slightly disheveled as he stared intently at the two figures.

Clang!

Li Xijun had already drawn his sword. The long blade angled toward the ground as he positioned himself protectively in front of the old man. His other hand had crushed a jade talisman, and his eyes were locked on the monk before him.

Xu Mu let out a sigh and replied, “It’s been a long time... Daoist Xuanxuan.”

“And you are...” Li Xuanxuan was stunned by the voice. He stared closely at the monk’s eyes and brows; there was something familiar about them. After searching his memory twice over, he finally matched them with a cultivator he once knew.

Shock surged through him, and his lips trembled slightly as he said, "You... you've actually returned!"

"The sharper the advance, the swifter the retreat. The strength of a blade lies in how it is concealed before it's drawn." Xu Mu sat quietly, his gaze fixed on the copper sword. The cold, radiant gleam cast a pale light on his clean, white face.

He said hoarsely, "In my youth, I wielded my edge recklessly, left my family in anger, went to the northern frontiers, slew devil cultivators, honed my swordsmanship, walked thousands of miles on foot, and crossed the Taihang.

"I poured all my emotion into the sword and cast everything else into emptiness. Now, looking back at the past hundred years, my eldest brother perished, consumed by endless schemes. Our family was extinguished. My second brother sacrificed himself to stop a formidable foe, burning to death when his cover was blown. My youngest brother sought immortality to survive, only to be slain by our enemies..."

At that moment, hair slowly began to grow atop Xu Mu’s head, and his body grew broader and more imposing. He looked more and more like his prime. Yet his eyes never left the sword in his hand.

"I, Xu Mu, have pondered what Senior Tongya once said for many years. Now that I believe I am ready... I’ve come back to reclaim my sword."

Crack.

Heavy white mist burst from all five of his orifices, sweeping through the restaurant. Buds sprouted from the wooden stairs only to quickly rot away. The steamed chicken on the table twitched twice, grew feathers, cried out twice within the white mist, and crumbled into dust.

Li Xijun drew his sword and swept the white mist rushing toward them aside. He then lifted both companions and sent them outside the restaurant in the same breath. Chen Yang, being farther away, was merely brushed by the edge of the mist. A few threads from his gray robe’s hem drifted loose and fell.

White mist surged out with each breath Yu Mujian exhaled. Though it stopped flowing from his five orifices, it still billowed from beneath his robes.

He spoke coldly, “I wonder how much of Li Tongya’s true teachings you’ve inherited, Xijun.”

Li Xijun sheathed his sword and formed a seal with one hand, suppressing the surging mist. He replied calmly, “There are many mortals here. Master Monk, please take this duel with me to the lake.”

Yu Mujian narrowed his eyes slightly, drew his sword, and stepped forward. He vanished and reappeared over the lake in an instant. Li Xijun followed a step behind, his figure also appearing above the water as snow began to fall from the sky.

Yu Mujian reversed the copper sword and rested it at his waist. The blade was thick, rounded, and dull-edged, but it glowed with a dim yellow hue. White mist surged toward it, gathering into a swirling, flowing mass.

He spoke, “This sword is called Copper Cache. It was forged from copper mined in Yan Mountain, quenched in waters from Piaoming Mountain of the Northern Sea, and tempered with the fires of Mount Cituo in Yinghua Prefecture...”

Li Xijun’s sword-like brows lowered slightly as he watched closely, a hint of weight pressing on his heart, That sword is indeed unusual... I wonder if I can match it. Mount Qingdu is protected by a Foundation Establishment Realm formation. No matter how mad he gets, the younger ones should be safe.

Pressing his hand against his sword, Li Xijun remained motionless and responded, “The name of my sword is Han Lin.”

Without warning, Yu Mujian unsheathed his blade. The white mist immediately surged like waves and stretched out over the lake like a curtain. The gleam of frost was like sharp blades as it crackled and hissed with immense power and weight.

The white blade flew across the lake. It seemed slow, yet it was incomparably fast. The mist churned the waters into a frenzy and suffocated the hearts of all who felt its pressure.

Li Xijun immediately released the technique he had long prepared, Slaughter Jun Kui Light. He pressed two fingers together, and dozens of streaks of white energy erupted outward. The shimmering light rippled, transforming into cold snow as fine as pine needles. It was carried on the wind, converging into a single stream that rushed toward the white mist.

But Li Xijun wasted no time. The moment he finished casting the spell, he leapt into the air, drawing his slender sword, which flared with a fierce, snow-white radiance. Though the area around him had been swept clean by the impact, flakes of snow began to fall once more.

The Celestial Moon Slash blazed bright for an instant, carving a path through the surging, wave-like white mist. Yu Mujian saw it clearly, excitement flickering in his eyes. He stepped forward and swung his sword once again.

Just then, a sudden brilliance lit up the sky above. Blinding light poured down, making Yu Mujian’s heart skip a beat. That radiance condensed into white stone bricks that interlocked together to form a massive fortress gate in the air.

“Who dares trespass?! Such gall!”

The gate towered high, its white stone pillars etched with countless mysterious runes and shamanic curses. A young man in Daoist robes stood atop the structure, and shouted in a mix of shock and fury.

Yu Mujian had to raise his head and draw his sword. Dazzling light shimmered like a scorching sun within the gate’s archway, burning away the white mist and searing the skin on his face.

Li Ximing was indeed both startled and enraged. He had been in secluded cultivation for years, well aware of how thin their family had been stretched by Azure Pond Sect’s conscription. So he occasionally kept watch, and Li Xijun had long prepared methods to summon him if needed.

Now, for the first time, Li Xijun’s summoning method had awoken him. He had rushed out only to see white mist churning over the lake and a buddhist cultivator drawing his sword on his younger brother. Fury ignited within him, and a deadly intent surged forth.

He mobilized the vast reserves of his qi sea without hesitation, unleashing his cultivation without concern for depletion. Each white stone within the Radiant Origin Pass began to glow. The blinding white at its center shone with searing intensity. Yu Mujian, suddenly under attack, remained calm and simply reached out.

He pulled a long cloth from his sleeve and gave it a shake in midair. A flurry of golden runes fell out like tadpoles, floating eerily in the air before assembling into a golden barrier that shielded him completely.

The techniques of buddhist cultivators were often difficult to read. Li Ximing couldn’t immediately tell if this was a dharma artifact or a spell. With a single thought, he sent the Radiant Origin Pass crashing downward.

Boom!

The brilliant white fortress gate slammed down with a thunderous crash. Yu Mujian dodged twice but couldn’t evade entirely. The Radiant Origin Pass slammed directly onto the golden barrier. Light and light collided, releasing a hiss of white mist as suppression forces surged.

Meanwhile, Li Xijun had already broken free from the white mist. He stirred a swirl of brilliant snow into motion and flicked his long sword upward, sending three nimble, cunning streaks of white light into the mist.

Yu Mujian had only just managed to resist Li Ximing’s radiant pass. The runes on his body rang out with a metallic clang. Only then could he free a hand to withstand the force. Halfway through a spell seal, he had to frown and halt.

He swept away the white mist in front of him with his sleeve, and caught a streak of flowing light between his fingers. The white sword light writhed violently in his grip, letting out harsh, grating screeches.

Before he could react further, his other hand flicked out, capturing another streak. Only then did he have the chance to draw the copper sword at his waist. A surge of white mist burst out, forcing both streaks of light away.

The first streak of white light had left a small puncture on the back of his hand, yet Yu Mujian didn’t seem to care. He casually wiped it, sealing the bleeding hole with ease.

“Good!” Rather than anger, joy filled his face. His eyes lit up with a mix of surprise and delight at the sword technique. He sighed in admiration, “What a marvelous sword technique! What an ingenious method! So free of convention, as if it was born from the Outer Heavens... But you’ve yet to grasp its true essence. If the creator themself had wielded it, those three streaks of light might have left me spinning helplessly!”

He continued murmuring in joy, but the strain of the battle was causing the golden glow surrounding him to flicker. The Radiant Origin Pass specialized in suppression and erosion; it was capable of grinding gold to dust in mere moments. Its power was not to be underestimated.

Though Li Ximing didn’t possess many impressive combat techniques or experience, the cultivation method he used was a solid fifth-grade one. When he unleashed his late Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation to its fullest, his ability to suppress Immortal Foundations rivaled even the elite descendants of the Three Sects. Even Yu Mujian had to momentarily rein in his wandering thoughts and showed a hint of surprise.

He knew his own limitations. That golden rune barrier was no ordinary spell; it was one of Five-Eyed Temple’s top techniques, and one he had honed for decades. The spell was normally unshakable by Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, yet it was already buckling after only a few breaths under this pressure.

He freed one hand, emitting white light, using it to prop up the Radiant Origin Pass. With the other, he pulled out a golden talisman and began casting, chanting, “Empty Prison Case, All Sentiments Revealed...”

After chanting the spell, he strained with the hand supporting the Radiant Origin Pass and gave the gate a symbolic jolt. Then, he lightly stepped to the side, slipping out from beneath it and appearing ten steps away.

The golden barrier around him brightened swiftly, gradually returning to its full radiance. Yet behind him, snow suddenly began to fall. The snowflakes drifted sideways in unison by an inch, revealing a streak of piercing white brilliance. An icy, radiant sword light streaked through the air, aimed straight at his back.




# Chapter 763: Sword Cry

Yu Mujian’s eyes widened as he thrust both palms forward, releasing two bursts of golden light. But Li Xijun’s swordplay was masterful; it was no longer the rigid, orthodox Celestial Moon Slash. His longsword subtly adjusted its angle mid-swing, and the gathered sword light slipped right through the gap between Yu Mujian’s hands.

The arc of Li Xijun’s sword came alive, evading defenses on the fly. Though its power hadn't drastically increased, the threat was now far greater. Caught off guard, the white sword light pierced through Yu Mujian’s chin, broke through the roof of his mouth, and nearly split his head open.

Still, Yu Mujian reacted swiftly. His copper sword lashed out, forcing Li Xijun back. Off to the side, Li Ximing was startled and quickly redirected the Radiant Origin Pass to suppress him again.

Though Li Ximing did not study the sword path, he was awestruck by his younger brother’s strike and admired him, Xijun’s swordsmanship has already surpassed Second Uncle’s from back then. Now that Brother Xizhi can no longer focus on the sword, no one in the family aside from the two ancestral lines can compare.

Yu Mujian was prepared this time. He formed a seal and narrowly avoided the Radiant Origin Pass’s suppression, retreating quickly.

His eyes gleamed as he spoke softly, “I truly underestimated you...”

The sword light still shimmered along his chin and only showed signs of healing after some time. He gathered dharma light in his hands again, for that vexing Radiant Origin Pass had come crashing down once more. Yu Mujian had no choice but to defend, growing increasingly irritated.

Suppressed by the Radiant Pass, Yu Mujian had lost the initiative and suffered repeated attacks from the two. Knowing this wouldn’t do, he finally dodged the massive gate and immediately cast a spell, flicking out three drops of golden tear-like essence.

The three golden drops rolled and drifted through the air before transforming into three figures, each wielding a copper sword. They darted off in a different direction.

Having fought countless battles across the north, he knew well that suppression spells and dharma artifacts were weakest against concealment and doppelgangers. Maneuvering between them could waste endless time. So, he hid his real body among the illusions, silently adjusting his breath and preparing to strike.

Just as the spell was cast, Li Xijun sheathed his sword. His eyes lit up with a snow-bright gleam. The effects of Radiant Snow Pine Ridge combined with Spirit Eye Perception allowed him to see through the illusion in an instant.

His spiritual sense stirred, and he transmitted a thought, Upper left.

Li Ximing understood instantly and activated the Radiant Origin Pass, slamming it straight down on the target. Yu Mujian was forced to summon his golden shield once again as the gate bore down on him. When his eyes met Li Xijun’s bright, piercing gaze, his chest tightened involuntarily.

This Li Xijun’s eye technique is no simple art!

Yu Mujian had only managed to unleash one strike before being pinned down by the Radiant Origin Pass again. The radiant light gleamed brilliantly, and its grinding suppression was overwhelming. If he had a pinpoint technique, it might help, but his copper sword was built for brute force.

He thought bitterly, This Bright Yang generation... he must have formed an Immortal Foundation based on some divine spell. Its grade is by no means low. If it were any ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, they would’ve long been ground to dust...

Meanwhile, Li Ximing had begun to grasp the rhythm of Yu Mujian’s movements and spellcasting intervals. Becoming more proficient by the moment, Li Xijun continued to cast his Kui Light technique, drawing his sword to unleash streaks of light that constantly interrupted Yu Mujian’s attempts to escape.

Though the two brothers rarely fought together, Li Xijun had a flawless sense of timing. He always exploited the openings Li Ximing left perfectly, leaving Yu Mujian fuming.

White mist was surging from his body and his face flushed red. Yu Mujian hovered in the air for two seconds before the Radiant Origin Pass pressed down again. The bright white gate sparkled brilliantly and finally pinned him in place.

Yu Mujian’s expression darkened further as dazzling light poured down around him. Li Ximing now sat firmly atop the gate, cross-legged, eyes shut tight and hands sealed in a mudra as he focused wholly on suppression.

Beside him, Li Xijun stood in white robes, sword slung across his back. He had two fingers pressed together as he formed seals and cast spells. Mount Qingdu’s spiritual energy shifted violently. Ten streaks of icy light shot upward, creating a deep blue barrier that cascaded from the sky.

“Morning Mist.”

Li Xijun gently formed another seal. A thick gray mist rose over the lake, rapidly spreading and cutting off spiritual sense. Tendrils started to drift toward Yu Mujian.

Li Xijun had invited him to fight at the lake with a plan in mind. Liu Changdie’s Heaven-Guarding Formation of Five Waters had been prepared long ago but had never been activated. He had saved for this moment to destroy Yu Mujian in one blow. His hands cycled rapidly through seals: Serpent Stream, Pure Essence, Grounded.

His killing intent surged. Countless serpentine water beasts, condensed from mana, leaped from the lake, their gray-green light flickering. The ground beneath Yu Mujian’s feet seemed to sink, and the Radiant Origin Pass pressed down harder, making escape feel impossible.

Yu Mujian’s expression grew increasingly grim. He now realized he had completely underestimated them, I thought Li Ximing was just an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. I underestimated this suppression technique. And now, I’ve fallen for Li Xijun’s scheme and walked straight into a formation... If I don’t bring out my real power, I’m in real trouble.

He sat cross-legged in midair. He formed a lotus seal before his chest as golden runes barely held around him. Golden patterns rose along his face. His eyes sparkled, releasing twin beams of dazzling golden light as he solemnly chanted, “Suxikong bestowed the true form through empowerment, illuminating Vajra and Womb Realms... Xu Mu has attained it, and today, beseeches to embody it. I command!”

He chanted rapidly, but each word was solemn and forceful. The spell he uttered transformed his eyes into a brilliant gold. He extended both arms forward as his back arched and flesh pulled away, revealing two more golden arms.

“By command, I attain the true form of Suxikong!”

The upper half of his robes exploded open, revealing a muscular torso. Golden light shone from each side of his chest. Two more eyes opened coldly and stared ahead. The long strip of cloth that had once unfurled golden runes now wrapped itself around his waist, slowly turning to gold itself.

Yu Mujian’s four eyes all focused forward. His rear two arms shot upward, veins of gold flaring as they pushed the Radiant Origin Pass away. His other two arms gripped his sword and pointed it directly at Li Xijun.

Li Xijun’s expression gradually turned grave. He slowly drew his sword back and braced himself.

Xu Mu is, after all, a Master Monk seated beside the Five-Eyed Merciful One. He’s bound to have hidden cards. Buddhist cultivators often rely on borrowed power from each other... Judging by this appearance, he’s drawing on external force.

Yu Mujian had fully manifested the True Form of Suxikong. His hair and beard had vanished, and he now resembled a golden-bodied Arhat. His eyes gleamed like molten gold as golden lacquer covering his eyelids and face.

He thundered, voice like crackling thunder, “Hah!”

The cry echoed like dragons roaring and tigers howling, stirring mountains and seas. Both Li Ximing and Li Xijun staggered. Yu Mujian forcefully pushed with both hands, blasting white mist from his mouth as he shoved the Radiant Origin Pass away. White mist and golden light entwined, his gaze sharp and blazing.

He said, “Draw your sword!”

He had placed his copper sword at his waist. All four hands now gripped the hilt and drew it inch by inch, releasing a narrow stream of golden light. A fierce sword aura erupted, intertwining with the runes on his body and stirring the lake into waves.

So all this time, despite the intense battle, his copper sword had never truly left its sheath! It had been so seamlessly forged with the scabbard that no one had noticed.

No wonder every swing carried immense weight but lacked sharpness. It was a concealed blade all along! thought Li Xijun.

Yu Mujian’s expression was ice-cold, the golden light on his body blazing like fire as it flowed into his sword. He paid no heed to the Radiant Origin Pass descending again and said deeply, “I have entered buddhism and severed ties with the Yu Family. This sword is for severing worldly attachments, to return a favor once shown by a senior.

“A sword that was concealed for years... today, it shall move.”

His eyes grew even brighter as he slowly drew the sword. Li Xijun stood still in midair, tightly gripping his own hilt. The final formation of the Heaven-Guarding Formation of Five Waters, the Layered Flow, emerged. Deep blue water surged and gradually surrounded him.

Provoked by Yu Mujian’s sword aura, Han Lin, Li Xijun’s sword, was already eager for battle. It let out a sharp screech as it vibrated in his hand. Li Xijun stared quietly down at his foe. He swallowed a pill, and said nothing.

The grand formations atop Mount Qingdu and nearby peaks flared to life, some bright, some dim, but their lights weaved together to release waves of energy. Li Ximing felt as if blades were cutting across his face, but with Yu Mujian’s sword aimed straight at his brother, how could he back down? He steeled himself, reversed his mana, and caused the Radiant Origin Pass to erupt in brilliance as it descended with increasing force.

Clang!

Golden light exploded skyward, dispersing clouds and mist. The Radiant Origin Pass rang with a sharp sound as the radiance at its center pulsed once, then dimmed. A tidal eruption of golden sword qi burst forth from within the gate, like mountains collapsing and seas roaring.

Boom!

The sword qi howled through the center, causing the plaque atop the gate to tremble violently. Cracks spread across the stone bricks, and the entire gate dimmed, shrinking into a single stream of light that shot back toward Li Ximing.

Pfft!

The Radiant Origin Pass had been harmed. Li Ximing coughed up a mouthful of blood, mingled gold and red. But before the blood even hit the lake, it transformed into golden streaks of light and scattered. He had no time to worry about his injuries; he immediately pulled out talismans and sent them flying to chase after the escaping light.

Li Xijun poured all his cultivation into his sword. The lake beneath his feet had frozen into solid ice. His pupils reflected only the golden sword aura; this was the culmination of the golden Arhat Suxikong’s lifetime of sword cultivation.

He felt the talisman seeds in his qi sea stir and erupt with pure qi. His mind grew sharper than ever before. Countless profound meanings surfaced in his heart, and his consciousness seemed to fall into a mirror, where he beheld a green sword resting on stone.

A man in a bright white robe stood alone atop an ancient, weathered city. His features were radiant and transcendent. A sky-darkening fire phoenix streaked through the heavens like a comet. The man calmly drew his sword, and a wave of cyan-white iridescence burst forth.

That cyan-white sword image gradually appeared in Li Xijun’s eyes. He sheathed his sword with his pale and glowing hand. He summoned another.

Clang!

A sharp screech rang out as a cyan-white sword burst forth from the mountains and soared through the air to land in his hand. The sword tassel swayed in the wind.

It was the Qingche Sword!

The moon-white sword light lit up once more and the gleam across the lake suddenly dimmed.

Golden light erupted from several miles away, accompanied by the rumble of collapsing stone. Yu Mujian stood in midair, staring blankly.

Li Xijun stood silently opposite him. Yu Mujian slowly lowered his sword. After standing for two seconds, his expression shifted and he abruptly said, “I have no regrets.”

Countless cracks spread across his face as the words left his mouth. His body held together for a single moment before shattering into countless fragments that scattered across the sky. The fragments turned to streams of light that turned into ash that drifted down like settling mist.

The dim yellow Copper Cache lost its radiance. It dropped, split into two pieces, and after half a spin, sank swiftly into the lake below.

Li Ximing sensed Li Xijun’s flickering and unstable qi. Without time to hesitate, he rushed to his side, only to see wind and snow churning as blood trailed from Li Xijun’s lips.

He quickly supported Li Xijun into the mountains. It was only when he fed Li Xijun a Wanglin Blossom that his complexion began to shift for the better. A faint red line ran across his waist; he had clearly been pierced by sword qi.

Blood still rising in his throat, Li Xijun rasped, “Earth-View Bloodstone!”

Li Ximing hastily took out the blood-glowing jade stone from his storage pouch and handed it to Li Xijun. Li Xijun used his palm like a blade and sliced off a small portion. He then tore his own abdomen open. His internal organs were broken and mangled.

He placed the bloodstone inside, pressed his palms together, and spat out a mouthful of black blood which pierced the jade with dozens of tiny holes.

After panting for a few moments, life gradually returned to Li Xijun’s face. He asked, “Is Yu Mujian dead?”

Li Ximing took half a second before realizing he needed to respond, "At the very least, that physical body should be dead..."

His face was drenched in sweat as he hastily asked, “How are you?”

“I should be fine with the Earth-View Bloodstone.” Li Xijun’s face was pale as paper. He leaned against a green boulder, using his mana to bind his fragmented organs together.

Yet his eyes were shockingly bright, and he smiled. “Ximing, there should still be a sword immortal’s remnant or inheritance hidden within the Qingche Sword!”

“Inheritance, whatever... Just stop talking first...” Li Ximing had no mind to listen to any more. He rummaged through his storage pouch and piled out several pills, muttering, “Every time I emerge from closed-door cultivation, something has already gone wrong at home... I've been feeling uneasy for days. Focus on your recovery...”

Li Xijun nodded, took a few pills, and sat down cross-legged, closing his eyes to heal.

After more than ten seconds, Li Xuanxuan came rushing over, calling out, “Ximing! Xijun! Are you both alright?”

“Still holding on...” Li Ximing quickly replied, then gradually regained his calm. He followed Li Xuanxuan out to reassure him, and noticed the elder holding two broken halves of the copper sword.

Copper Cache was still dripping wet from the lake. The fracture was smooth as a mirror.

Xu State, great void.

Golden clouds swirled auspiciously within the pitch-black great void, white mist curling around them. A massive golden figure sat upright at its center. The figure had three heads, six arms, and countless faces. The golden lacquer adorning it shimmered as it was surrounded by murmuring Sanskrit chants.

Many Merciful Ones stood beneath the golden lotus-like clouds, only a tenth the size of the golden figure. Their expressions varied, with some glaring in fury while others were as cold as frost. However, they were all holding blades, spears, axes, or halberds.

All the Merciful Ones stood frozen, their lotus-formed hands motionless in the golden mist. Their sacred weapons shimmered coldly, drawing the eye irresistibly toward them.

“Hm?”

Suddenly, a Merciful One opened its eyes, three on its face and two more on its chest. They were all glaring wide with faint anger flickering within them. Its arms, arranged in a lotus posture, dropped swiftly as it began divining with measured movements.

Xu Mu is dead!

He felt a flicker of anger. Xu Mu had been one of the few successful converts. He had been an exceptional manifestation of the True Form of Suxikong in the Way of Emptiness. A true Arhat he could rely on.

And that was only part of it. Xu Mu also possessed a profound swordsmanship. He was a cultivator from Jiangnan, and likely at the Sword Essence Realm. He had been the perfect pawn... yet now, he had died so suddenly and uselessly after being sent south to sever his past!

“That Li Family... they possess enough power to prevent even the True Form of Suxikong from reincarnating?!”

The Five-Eyed Merciful One’s three facial eyes flared with fury, while the two on his chest remained icy cold. The lotus dharma artifacts on either side descended from above his head to his sides.

After a brief moment, he murmured inwardly, The few Golden Core Realm cultivators of Jiangnan have already departed for the Outer Heavens. This was not interference. This is the perfect moment to divine fate... Maha is also nearby. I must see what kind of Mandate of Heaven this person carries. Ideally, I can take him for myself...

His regret slightly eased, golden patterns began to form across his face. His five eyes slowly closed as he began calculating with folded fingers.




# Chapter 765: Great Supreme Chan

The Five-Eyed Merciful One twisted his fingers to seize Xu Mu’s fate and calculate. His vision turned hazy, and soon, a great lake emerged before him. The rippling blue waters of the lake formed the outline of a crescent moon.

Towering peaks surrounded the lake. The islets within were either sealed by thunder or lush with verdant grass. The scenery was as tranquil and clear as moonlight. He studied it carefully and thought to himself, This should be Moongaze Marsh, one of the ancient Seven Lakes and Four Marshes... Now it’s merely Moongaze Lake... The Water Mansion of the Five Water Virtues, the authority over lakes and marshes, no longer manifests, and thus it has declined to this state...

As he continued his deductions, he suddenly caught sight of a young man in white. The youth had sword-like brows and starry eyes, while his body was cloaked in frost and snow. In his hand, a green-white sword radiated a piercing light.

Just then, a voice called out by his ear, “Li Xijun!”

The Five-Eyed Merciful One studied his face. His heart stirred as his eyes burned with desire. He then revealed a look of joy, This... is good... A face as if carved, his brow cold and sharp, his heart pure and bones of ice. Adept at severing mortal ties, he’s cold as winter snow and utterly merciless. He suits my Way of Emptiness even more than Xu Mu! I lost a copper sword, yet gained a blade of frost!

His heart surged with joy, thoroughly satisfied, And to think this man killed one of my Arhats! To kill and create karma is the greatest kind of karmic link! I don’t even need to go through great lengths to sever his fate and convert him, there’s already cause for him to fall into my hands!

The Merciful One scattered the divination, formed hand seals and chanted incantations. Radiant light burst forth from the back of his head as he observed carefully from the great void. He reached into his robes with a golden-lacquered arm and retrieved a small copper sword.

The copper sword had already snapped in two. Holding it in his palm, he began to chant, “In this place, the first boundless life is born of the great void. The five-eyed one seeks the cause of the broken sword, to fulfill the fruit of my Dao lineage... and bring salvation to all beings...”

Golden light shone from the Merciful One’s face as his eyes grew hazy. Soon, Li Xijun’s face appeared before him, and he couldn’t help but nod slowly, To divine him so easily... indeed, someone with no background or entanglements... Good...

The Five-Eyed Merciful One was a seasoned and ancient being, and had attempted reincarnation twice already. His divination arts stemmed from the extremely effective prophetic techniques of the late Zhou dynasty, but if one miscalculated when it came to a True Monarch, it could very well cost one’s life.
𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝑐𝘰𝑚

He was experienced enough to be well aware of the taboos. First, he used Xu Mu to calculate the fate of the Yu Family, then conducted further deduction at Moongaze Lake. Aside from Li Tongya, who had killed a Maha and whose parents’ fate remained obscure, the rest of the Li Family were ordinary enough that drawing their names revealed their faces.

Then there is no need to worry! thought the Five-Eyed Merciful One

The youth’s complexion was pale, and his eyes were tightly shut. He must have suffered greatly at Xu Mu’s hands. The Merciful One found this entirely reasonable, and the finger that had rested on his middle digit gently lifted.

Rumble.

The Merciful One felt like the heavens themselves had collapsed beside his ears. A burst of golden-white sparks exploded before his eyes, sending pain slicing through his heart like a drill. In the span of a single held breath, the back of his head turned icy cold, as though a pair of massive hands had reached into his soul and forcefully yanked it upward.

Woe!

Once again, he felt both spirit and flesh shatter. Something misty spilled down his face, leaving his limbs limp. His soul seemed to fly from his body, yet also felt trapped within. Hallucinations flickered before his eyes, alternating between light and dark, and then, he lost all consciousness.

————

Within the mirror’s world.

“They’ve finally arrived!” Lu Jiangxian materialized in mid-air like mist. The azure sword in his hand let out a faint cry, easing the tension in his heart.

Chi Buzi and the Water Mansion Immortal Official had obtained numerous Foundation Establishment Realm techniques, many of which included spell arts. For instance, Li Xizhi’s Dawn Dew Gathering Technique came with six supplementary spells, three secret techniques, as well as a footwork technique, escape spell, and other spell types. There was everything one could need.

He had originally been revising these one by one within the Mirror World. Azure Pond had many techniques and spell arts, so modifying the techniques was simple enough. Remove the head and tail, repackage them, and they could be granted freely.

But the spell arts were far more conspicuous, since most had been created by Azure Pond Sect and had its own distinct personal flair. Some were even famous; one glance was all it would take to recognize them.

He had no choice but to select a few spell arts of suitable grade, cross-reference them, and make careful edits. Although he had seen countless techniques and spell arts, writing them wasn’t something that could be done in a day.

Who would’ve thought that barely any time would pass before a buddhist cultivator attacked the Li Family?

Xu Mu, or rather, Yu Mujian, did not have particularly high sword cultivation, but he had a unique mindset. Clinging to a single phrase Li Tongya once spoke, he had hidden that sword strike for decades. When it was finally unleashed, it bore all the sharpness and killing intent of a true killer blow. In that instant, its power had nearly rivaled Li Xuanfeng’s full-force attack, reaching the pinnacle of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Though several Golden Core Realm cultivators had gone to the Outer Heavens, they were all too familiar with the methods of Daoist Masters and True Monarchs. This could very well be bait to lure the snake from its den. Lu Jiangxian didn’t believe for a moment that no one from Yue State was watching him. It would be best not to use the Supreme Yin Profound Light if possible.

So, he fully activated the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed, calming Li Xijun’s mind to a state of perfect clarity. Then, by combining it with the azure sword left behind by Li Chejing, he achieved a state akin to possession, allowing the youth to comprehend and wield the sword.

This is the lowest-risk method I could come up with...

Were it not for the immortal art he possessed, he would never have been able to make it look so seamless. After all, this was only a minor move at the Foundation Establishment Realm, an inspiration-born sword strike that left no trace.

Li Xijun also carried a talisman seed within him, which theoretically should’ve concealed anything unusual. Since everything seemed under control, Lu Jiangxian had paused his work to assist.

But the Merciful One’s divinations had begun tracing their way back, testing each step cautiously. Lu Jiangxian watched coldly and thought, Even the Jinlian Maha back then couldn’t detect anything wrong. What can a mere little Merciful One possibly see?

Sure enough, a few seconds later, the Five-Eyed Merciful One boldly began his divinations. Lu Jiangxian’s heart stirred, and an idea struck him. He rapped the table and an endless white jade palace from years past appeared before him.

Now, the intricate incantations etched around the hall were no longer mere decorative script, but true spellforms calculated using Metallic Essence and immortal arts. They were enough to mesmerize any who laid eyes on them.

Even his immortal seat was different; it had been remodeled from an altar. It was majestic and imposing as it stood high above the ground. Below it, endless white mist poured forth, forming countless shifting shapes.

This white mist had come from years of observing Purple Mansion Realm breakthroughs and Golden Core Realm cultivators battle. Combined with immortal arts, it truly contained the wondrous nature of Metallic Essence. Even a True Monarch might be stunned upon seeing it.

After arranging everything with care, he sat calmly upon the throne, and brought the Five-Eyed Merciful One before the hall as a radiant light bloomed upon his face.

The Five-Eyed Merciful One slowly regained consciousness. The first thing that entered his vision was a radiant white surface. It was smooth and crystal-clear, though bright white patterns could be seen through the pale layer. Just one glance made his head spin.

The terror in his heart only rose as he gradually came to his senses. He dared not lift his head and simply stared at the white mist curling around his legs. His heart felt frozen, and the chill was not helping his dizziness.

His teeth chattered as he muttered, “It’s over... I’ve provoked someone far beyond me...”

Hearing no movement, the Merciful One slowly raised his head and his heart nearly burst from terror. A vast, boundless hall stretched before him. Pristine jade pillars soared into the clouds, and at the highest point sat a man clad in white.

His face radiated dazzling light, so white and brilliant that the Merciful One winced in pain. His garments exuded celestial grace as he leaned upon a lofty jade immortal seat. The light cascading from him transformed into the myriad forms of lifelike and vivid sentient beings once the rays hit the ground.

This... this! His eyes felt like they were on the verge of bleeding, and upon seeing the immortal seat soaring into the heavens, his heart went hollow. Only one thought remained in his mind, An immortal?!

Lu Jiangxian gazed at the Five-Eyed Merciful One on the ground. He rested one hand gently on the jade seat, composed and unhurried.

This was the second time someone had divined his true form. But he was no longer the Lu Jiangxian of the past; he had risen far above that. Moreover, what stood before him now wasn’t the Maha Jinlian who briefly could trap him, but merely a Merciful One of the Way of Emptiness. He was no better than a fish slab falling into his hand.

He gestured discreetly and a golden radiance bloomed in his palm. Morning mist churned and thoughts flickered within it. Bit by bit, the Merciful One’s memories surfaced, each idea from his mind laid bare.

I’ll just wait and watch, thought the Merciful One.

Lu Jiangxian remained silent, as if cultivating in seclusion. The Merciful One trembled on the floor for a moment, his terror far beyond its limit. When he looked up, he was struck again by the blinding brilliance of the immortal seat above. It was vast and overwhelming, so he could only lower his gaze to the floor again.

He squirmed on the ground for a moment, legs pressed together as he slowly scooted backward. Yet the hall held no other scenery aside from the radiance. It was so still that there was not a sound to be heard. He felt like he had moved for a long time, then he glanced around.

Nothing had changed in any direction. He was still kneeling in the exact same spot.

Putting on a full display of fear and dread, the Merciful One could only say in a sorrowful tone, “This humble cultivator greets the Exalted Immortal... I have sullied the immortal hall through my intrusion... and am stricken with shame and dread.”

At last, a cool and indifferent voice descended from above, echoing through the hall, “What era is this now...”

That one line sent thunder through the Merciful One’s heart and he immediately concluded, He’s not searching my soul; that must mean he’s a righteous immortal. And to ask about the state of the world... he must be an immortal from before the heavenly upheaval. Such divine power yet ignorance of worldly affairs, there must be a flaw. Most likely, he has been sealed in this hall! That’s the only reason for such a question!

He spoke in a low voice, “Reporting to the Exalted Immortal, the Wei Dynasty has been gone for over seventeen hundred years.”

A pause of silence from above, then another question followed, “Where is Li Qianyuan?”

The Merciful One felt a chill run down his spine. Trembling, he replied, “The Great Ancestor of Wei has long since fallen. In Mount Luoxia, a True Monarch stands just a step away from attaining the Bright Yang Fruition.”

Lu Jiangxian glanced at his palm; the memory was already half-recovered. He asked again, offhandedly, “I see the Fruition Attainments of old left hanging, do you know where they’ve all gone?”

The Merciful One was stunned by the question. Understanding dawned, and he thought, I’ve heard that even Dharma Masters cannot perceive whether the Fruition Attainments are occupied... He must be an immortal beyond doubt.

He kowtowed repeatedly, replying aloud, “This humble one has managed to live a little longer thanks to the art of reincarnation, over seven hundred years now! In my youth, I lived during the reign of Fu Qiyan, and heard many tales from that time.”

The five-eyed Merciful One continued quickly, “This humble one’s knowledge is shallow, but back then... I heard that among the Ancient Merging Techniques, the Yue Cultivating inheritance was seized by True Monarch Taiyue when Liang State fell and Zhao State rose. The Jade True figure relinquished their Fruition Attainment and departed, while the Whole Pill master was severely wounded and slain by Dongfang Weiming and Dongfang Weixi...

“As for the rest of the major events... I truly do not know...”

He trembled as he finished speaking. Lu Jiangxian listened attentively before casually asking, “What of the Buddhist Dao now?”

At last, this touched upon the Merciful One’s expertise. He let out a long breath of relief and answered respectfully, “Exalted Immortal! The Buddhist Dao has long been fractured ever since Suxikong and Shijiali, the last two Revered Ones, parted ways after a failed discourse, each leaving the realm. It is now divided into seven Daos...

“They are Emptiness, Virtuous, Wrath, Great Desire, Discipline, Compassion, and Dharma Realm.

“With the exception of the Way of Wrath, which was plotted against before and after, resulting in the Dharma Master failing to respond and all Mahas perishing... the rest still have Dharma Masters holding the line...”

Lu Jiangxian listened in silence, as the Merciful One gave him a general sense of the northern Buddhist sects’ current strength.

He asked softly, “How many Revered Ones remain?”

The Five-Eyed Merciful One lay prostrate on the ground, racking his brains. He rehearsed his words like lightning in his mind, repeatedly and with care, before answering with a trembling voice, “It is said... that one still responds.”

As soon as he spoke, the mist and radiance before him began to surge and shift, manifesting various forms. A voice drifted down, “Their title.”

The Merciful One’s lips quivered as if waging an internal battle. His mouth moved repeatedly before he finally replied, “Great Supreme Chan... Celestial Acarya.”

He dared not pronounce the full name, deliberately pausing in the middle. After finishing, his voice trembled uncontrollably, and he lay flat on the white tiles like a tiny, helpless ant.

From above, a voice slowly drifted down, “Oh?”

Though faintly surprised, the tone carried a trace of inquiry, and it stirred endless speculation in the Merciful One’s heart. Though he dared not dwell on it, a thrill surged through him, as though he had glimpsed some ancient secret that made his legs tremble.

Why respond this way... why such a reply... could it be that the Great Supreme Chan attained the Revered One’s seat by... At that thought, a sudden shiver ran through him. Terrified, he dared not think further, and the immortal above him remained silent.

The golden radiance in Lu Jiangxian’s hand had reached its fullness, and he now held the Merciful One’s complete memory. There was no need for further questions.

The question now is how to deal with him... he pondered for a moment.

Below, the Merciful One’s heart was in utter chaos. He opened his mouth to beg for mercy, only to find he could no longer speak. All he could do was kowtow furiously, slamming his head into the ground like he was pounding garlic.

Lu Jiangxian watched quietly as he calculated, This Merciful One’s physical body still resides in the Great Void. If I kill him outright, under the eyes of many, a single divination about his sudden death might reveal traces. Perhaps even a True Monarch or a Dharma Master is observing...

At the same time, wiping his memory... would be far too lenient.

The grand hall echoed with the sound of desperate kowtowing. Lu Jiangxian watched for a while, feeling somewhat like a man with tasteless food he couldn’t bring himself to throw away. He thought, One mere Merciful One... and one who served near a Maha at that. If anything goes awry, it’ll be noticed instantly! Any backup plans will be useless, leaving nothing but a trail of clues.

He waited a moment longer, as he continued to speculate, What’s more, from the buddhist cultivators’ perspective, Xu Mu died at Li Xijun’s hand. It’d be strange indeed if this Merciful One let him go so easily, Li Xijun walking away unscathed is suspicious in itself...

He paused, considering quietly, Either he dies swiftly and without a trace... or he must become utterly obedient.
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝚠𝚎𝚋𝗻𝗼𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝚘𝐦

Lu Jiangxian glanced calmly around. His tone turned colder as he spoke softly, “Five-Eyed!”

The Merciful One instantly felt his lips and tongue unseal. Overwhelmed with joy and tears, he cried out in misery, “Exalted Immortal...”

Lu Jiangxian’s voice was low and haunting as he murmured, “I have dwelled in this hall for many years... Though you are a heretical outcast... you may yet be of use.”

The Merciful One kowtowed in terror. “I shall act solely on the Exalted Immortal’s command!”




# Chapter 767: Xia You

"Commands?" The Five-Eyed Merciful One trembled uncontrollably as the voice above him spoke coldly, "Such audacity..."

The Five-Eyed Merciful One frantically kowtowed and cried out in terror, "I understand! I understand! Your Excellency’s immortal merit is vast and boundless, your fate divinely ordained. I am merely a lowly cultivator, my fortune bleak and my path astray. Only by a twist of fate was I granted the chance to glimpse your visage!

"Now that I have seen Your Excellency, my life is no longer mine... I understand, it is as though all the honored ones have arrived together... to behold an immortal's face and die on the spot, such is the way. I can only offer my absolute obedience from now on!"

The Five-Eyed Merciful One continued in a sorrowful voice, "I am willing to repay all the karma I have created in the mortal realm with my body. Let me suffer the burning of countless karmic flames. I only wish to shed this impure body and enter your service, as a mere Daoist child in your grotto heaven, a humble clerk in your realm of law..."

His voice and expression were both mournful, spiritual tears brimming in his eyes. Lu Jiangxian could not help but sigh with admiration, Truly worthy of being called the Merciful One and a buddhist cultivator! What a silver tongue he has!
𝚏𝐫𝚎𝗲𝕨𝐞𝐛𝕟𝚘𝐯𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝗺

His voice was soft as it echoed in the air, completely ignoring the torrent of words from the Five-Eyed Merciful One, "I left a chess piece in the mortal world, yet you meddled with unnecessary hands and feet... If you leave even a trace in the future, I will do far more than simply burn you with karmic fire..."

The Five-Eyed Merciful One realized the crucial moment had arrived. He could only wish he could rip out his own heart to prove his sincerity as he cried out, "Exalted Immortal... Exalted Immortal... I still have some tricks left! I will see to it that this matter is handled perfectly! I swear you will not need to worry in the slightest. Should anything go awry, I will accept the deepest pain and torment, and never again be reborn!"

But unexpectedly, a beam of radiant light descended from above, piercing straight into his mind. The voice of the white-robed immortal overhead echoed ethereally, "Today’s oath shall bind your very soul."

Lustrous light flowed in Lu Jiangxian’s hand, as Bright Yang essence flickered. The Five-Eyed Merciful One dissipated before him like smoke on the breeze. The pale moon-colored palace gradually faded, and the dark sky returned once more.

The memories of the Five-Eyed Merciful One flowed into him, and Lu Jiangxian examined them carefully, twice.

The Five-Eyed Merciful One’s mortal surname was Xiao. He had once been a minor cultivator in the northern Tiefo State who practiced a devil technique. Back then, the Merciful One had served the Helian Family as a retainer under the rule of Emperor Zhaowu, Fu Qiyan.

"That Fu Qiyan was quite the enlightened ruler. Under his reign, the Daoist, Devil, and Buddhist Daos coexisted in balance, each flourishing in its own right with a place to thrive," muttered Lu Jiangxian.

The Five-Eyed Merciful One had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm during Fu Qiyan’s reign. He remembered the sky dimming and the heavens running red with blood. Trees and stones wept along the roads, and the people were filled with dread. The old ancestor of the Helian family had barely shown himself before something snatched him away, leaving only a terrified and panicked scream behind.

The Merciful One hid underground for three months. When he finally emerged, he learned that Emperor Zhaowu, Fu Qiyan, had perished in Yincheng Prefecture. The crown prince, Fu Qidangle, had ascended the throne and welcomed seven sacred statues into the capital.

The Merciful One was then constantly hunted because of his identity as a devil cultivator and nearly lost his life. He quickly abandoned his Dao lineage and switched to the Dao of the buddhist cultivator. Unexpectedly, his nature suited this Dao perfectly, and he gradually rose to the position of the Merciful One.

The man valued his life above all else. Even after becoming a Master Monk with numerous reincarnation techniques, he rarely left the north, doing as he pleased within the confines of his Five-Eyed Temple. He had seven hundred years of memories, yet four hundred were spent in indulgence and pleasure.

One day, on a whim, he decided to travel south. But as soon as he reached Xu State in Jiangbei, he happened to run into Duanmu Kui, who had come to Jiangbei in search of something and had once encountered an immortal.

When he saw that Duanmu Kui was only in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm while he was already the Merciful One, he laughed three times in scorn. He never expected Duanmu Kui to strike him down with a single book, reducing his body to pulp and completely destroying his Merciful One vessel. From that day on, he never dared cross the river again.

"Seven hundred years of cultivation..."

Most of the Merciful One’s memories were of buddhist cultivator methods. But having cultivated for seven centuries, he had studied both devil techniques and immortal techniques. The devil techniques needed no elaboration, while the immortal techniques were mostly ancient methods.

Lu Jiangxian skimmed through them. The boundary between devil and immortal arts was unclear during the transitions between the Liang and Zhao dynasties. Techniques of the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm Dao often had all sorts of dual-cultivation and consumption methods appended to them.

"No wonder the Five-Eyed Merciful One classified the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm Dao under devil cultivation as well..."

He quickly changed focus and examined things more closely. There were three other celestial phenomena in the Merciful One’s memories similar to the fall of Emperor Zhaowu, a True Monarch figure, not to mention several other suspected instances...

"The other three all occurred within the two hundred years between seven hundred and five hundred years ago..."

Lu Jiangxian took silent note of it as he began to secretly observe the phenomena unfolding within the great void using the backdoor left within the Merciful One’s soul.

The Five-Eyed Merciful One awoke in a daze from the great void, his hand seal only halfway formed. It felt as if merely a second had passed, yet he felt as though he had lived through another lifetime. Golden light sparkled and lotus flowers descended before him.

For a brief moment, he was stunned. But when he felt the faintly smoldering mana deep within his soul, he realized that everything just now hadn’t been an illusion. A deep bitterness welled up within his heart.

"What’s the matter?" The red-skinned, green-eyed Merciful One beside him asked casually, though his tone was laced with mockery, "Lord Five-Eyed suddenly awakens, so surely fate has stirred, and you've stumbled upon some great opportunity! Come now, tell us all about it?"

Though the other Merciful Ones remained perfectly still, each holding their dharma artifact, like a dense forest of statues, the Five-Eyed Merciful One knew that his brief pause had not gone unnoticed. They were all watching him.

What frightened him more was the Maha known as Zhelu, seated in the great void behind him. Though Zhelu was currently observing Xu State through a form of a thousand eyes, should anything unusual occur, the Maha would surely turn his gaze, and that would make his situation far worse.

But he remained calm in the face of danger, pretending to hurriedly stow away his small copper sword. As expected, the red-skinned, green-eyed Merciful One laughed heartily and mocked, "So it turns out your Arhat died!"

But as soon as those words were spoken, he silently praised the move. Indeed, most of the prying gazes immediately retreated in boredom.

The Five-Eyed Merciful One merely responded coldly, "Chilu, what concern is it of yours?"

The Merciful One Chilu’s dharma ground was adjacent to the Five-Eyed Temple, and the two had always been at odds. They had clashed many times in the past, and the Five-Eyed Merciful One had long resented him. But now, for the first time, he found the fellow useful and deliberately put on a tough-but-fearful expression.

Sure enough, Chilu laughed. "Your Arhat must have died in Jiangnan, eh?"

Not even waiting for a reply, he added, "Duanmu Kui has long been dead! And yet you're still cowering like this... What a disgrace to the Way of Emptiness! That Lord Zhelu would even keep a useless thing like you under his command? If I had been there, I would’ve bashed that barbarian’s skull in!"

Not good! His heart cried out in bitter alarm.

As expected, the moment Zhelu’s name was mentioned, an eye slowly turned toward them from behind. It stared at the two, and a voice like a ghostly whisper said, "Enough of this noise! A guest is arriving."

The Five-Eyed Merciful One let out a breath of relief and thought to himself, As expected, the immortal’s methods are supreme. My very fate has been handed over to Maha, and my soul has been branded, yet he remains completely unaware... This must be Golden Core Realm technique at least!

But just as he pondered, a hundred beams of golden light rose up ahead. A lotus dais floated into the air, atop which sat a child of five or six years old. The child was delicate and exquisitely carved like jade, brimming with charm. A golden temple hovered behind him, and waterfalls of incense and smoke cascaded gently, flowing with grace and beauty.

A minor cultivator below immediately cried out, "Respectfully welcoming the arrival of The Merciful Virtuous Worldly Way of the Lotus, Maha Jinlian of the Lotus Temple!"

The one from the Way of Virtuous has arrived...

The thought flashed through the minds of all the Merciful Ones. Then they heard the child’s voice echo lightly through the air as he called out, "Zhelu! Someone from the Tuoba Family has arrived!"

Baixiang Valley.

Li Xizhi had cultivated for half a year in peace. As winter gradually set in and snow began to fall, the mountain forests turned into a sea of white. This place held a different kind of beauty compared to the scenery of Jiangnan, one that brought great peace to the heart.

Having stood guard for quite some time, he encountered a period of shifting spiritual energy in the heavens and earth, with flows of Heavenly Glow coursing through the air. Li Xizhi’s foundation was already solid, so he consumed a Talisman Pill and smoothly advanced to the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The two who had come with him, Yu Yuwei of Panqi Peak and Quan Yi of Linghe Peak, had also begun to settle in. Yu Yuwei’s two disciples had arrived, and even Quan Yi, who had once seemed timid and uneasy, had found peace in his cultivation.

The group would often gather in the courtyard, chatting while facing the vast snowfall. Two juniors served tea at the front, while the rest of the valley’s cultivators knelt nearby, listening in fascination. They drank wine and discussed minor Daoist matters; it truly felt like a scene of carefree leisure.

From time to time, the checkpoints around the valley, managed by the residents, would send someone to report. The stationed Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators brought news, but there were never any major incidents, just a few devil cultivators who had stirred up trouble and fled through the area.

"Brother Xizhi!" The middle-aged man, Quan Yi, now addressed him as a peer. Though he was slightly older, he no longer dared to act superior. He said, "What a beautiful snowfall this is!"

Li Xizhi had grown familiar with Quan Yi over the past six months. The man had grown up within the sect, was not particularly scheming, and had neither wife nor children. He only had an elderly mother living on his home peak.

He had no intention of seeking a Dao companion, nor did he have close friends. The greatest accomplishment in his life had been achieving Foundation Establishment Realm, and all he wished for now was to protect his mother and let her live out her old age in peace. He had been conscripted here against his will, but after more than half a year, he’d warmed up and even started to smile again.

Yu Yuwei sat nearby, took a sip of wine, and sighed, "Xizhi... your family’s elder truly is mighty, slaying Murong Wu within the formation..."

Li Xizhi gave a small, amused smile. He had indeed been pleased upon hearing the news. Quan Yi had bombarded him with questions for a while, but the buzz had faded over the past few months. Only Yu Yuwei still brought it up frequently, always speaking of it with a trace of nostalgia.

Li Xizhi nodded slightly, his thoughts drifting to his family on the other side of the mountain. He was silently watching the falling snow, when suddenly he spotted a streak of black light racing in from the south and halting just outside the formation.
𝓯𝓻𝒆𝙚𝒘𝓮𝙗𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝒍.𝙘𝓸𝙢

"Hmm?"

Li Xizhi stood up, and even the usually unbothered Yu Yuwei grew serious. Then came a call from outside the formation, "Third Young Master! Third Young Master? Wushao is here! I've brought some items!"

Li Wushao... Li Xizhi was a little surprised. Li Wushao was a serpent demon that had been personally subdued by his father, Li Yuanjiao. Naturally, he had seen this creature before, in fact, according to the family law, he was technically Li Wushao’s master.

Recognizing him at a glance, Li Xizhi flew to the edge of the formation and asked softly, "How are things at home? Why did they send you here?"

Li Wushao was travel-worn, and brushed the snow off his robes to reveal his ever-unchanging black attire. He answered, "Third Young Master, the checkpoint just repelled a wave of devil cultivators. There were no major issues; however, Lord Qinghong has taken a dharma artifact to be reforged and asked me to deliver it to you."

Li Xizhi nodded and observed carefully. Once he confirmed it was indeed Li Wushao, and after inspecting several command tokens, he stepped outside the formation.

Li Wushao stared at him for a moment, and a look of envy appeared on his gloomy face as he said, "You’ve already surpassed me in cultivation, Young Master... Truly envious, I am."

Li Xizhi used his spiritual sense to double-check it was Li Wushao, and then led him inside the formation, replying, "Though your cultivation advances more slowly, you enjoy great longevity. Each path has its own benefits, there’s no need to envy anyone."

Li Xizhi excused himself from the others in the courtyard and returned to his room with Li Wushao, who pulled a folded fan from his sleeve.

The fan was deep, dark blue in color and shaped like a semi-circle. It had twelve clean, evenly spaced ribs and emitted a faint, otherworldly glow. Hints of multicolored brilliance flickered across its surface, as if infused with the light of Heavenly Glow.

Li Xizhi smiled slightly as he took the fan and studied it carefully. Li Wushao explained, "This was seized by Lady Qinghong after slaying someone from the Helian Family. Originally, it had only six ribs; it was a magic weapon, refined using souls and blood essence. It could release a gray demonic wind, and perhaps had other uses as well...

"Later, it was thoroughly remade with the intent of gifting it to you. The blood qi and souls were removed, and it was reforged using Cold Essence and Profound Metal. Though its quality dropped a little, it’s still a fine piece.

"It used to be a large fan that could cover half a body. Now, with added ribs and a thicker surface, it’s about the size of a person’s chest... After much searching, only a bit of Heavenly Glow treasure could be found, which was then fused into it."

After listening attentively, Li Xizhi responded gently with a simple, “Good."

In his eyes, the artifact was merely average among Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, but its meaning was special. So he smiled and said, "Please trouble yourself to pass on my thanks to aunt. I appreciate her concern."

Li Wushao nodded. "I certainly will. If the Young Master would give it a name, I can report back accordingly."

Li Xizhi tested it a little. It wasn’t as comfortable in hand as a sword, but it had its own unique strengths. It would be useful for repelling, scouting, and capturing spells.

He said softly, "Let it be named Xia You"

Li Wushao nodded. Then Li Xizhi suddenly recalled something, "When I broke through, Xiao’er had gathered a Six-Colored Rainbow Mist for me. It’s still in my storage pouch, but now’s the perfect time to take it out, refine it day and night, and fuse it into the fan’s surface."

As he was still mulling things over, Li Wushao nodded promptly, took out a letter, and handed it to him with a bow, saying, "I shall take my leave now... If I’m away too long and something happens at the checkpoint, I’ll end up being blamed."

Li Xizhi nodded naturally and personally escorted him all the way to the edge of the grand formation.

Li Wushao hesitated for a moment, his gloomy face softening slightly as he said, "Now that the old master is gone... I should be by your side, Young Master. But I've been stationed elsewhere by assignment. Please take care of yourself."

This old serpent was usually dour and never held back when cursing others, but over the decades, he had lived a life that the Eastern Sea couldn't compare to, and he remembered the kindness. Li Xizhi listened quietly, nodded in reply, and escorted him all the way out of the valley.

He hung the Xia You spirit fan at his waist, rode the wind back, and read the letter along the way, gaining a better understanding of the situation in the central regions.

Once he returned to the formation, Yu Yuwei glanced at him and smiled. "Congratulations, Xizhi, on acquiring a dharma artifact."

Quan Yi looked enviously at him. He assumed that the sword on Li Xizhi’s back was certainly of Foundation Establishment Realm, as was his feathered robe and now his treasured fan. He offered a few congratulatory words but sighed inwardly, What a pity that my Quan ancestors... missed their chance and went all in with Azure Pond too early. Had we just held some territory and waited to be merged in, at least... the Quan family could've stood alongside the Yuan, Yu, or Ning families. Now, we’re left passing down the name alone, one generation at a time...

As he brooded, both Li Xizhi and Yu Yuwei suddenly stiffened, turning simultaneously to look northward. A haze of gray mist had begun to rise, faint and drifting, into the air.

Quan Yi’s face went pale, and he cried out in alarm, "The Tuoba Family is on the move!"




# Chapter 769: Tuoba Chongyuan

Li Xizhi focused his gaze. The mist slowly rose and swept over the snow-white mountain ridges. Thick gray clouds rolled in behind it, mingling pure and turbid energies. Fleeting traces of escape light could be vaguely seen within them.

Radiant light surged from his eyes, floating within his pupils and subtly dispersing at the corners. The grayness faded, revealing a lead streak of white energy, followed by seven black trails. The rest were minor demonic troops, hidden amidst the clouds.

The Dawn Dew Gathering Technique was among the few top-tier, well-structured techniques within the sect. Its only flaw was the difficulty in gathering dew. No news had ever surfaced about its follow-up techniques from Jiangnan, and all fellow cultivators had long given up on it. Thus, few chose to train in it. However, the perception technique it was paired with was highly compatible. So Li Xizhi was the first among the three to see things clearly, and he sighed inwardly.

Quan Yi counted them one by one, his face pale as he replied, “There are actually this many of them!”

Yu Yuwei looked on grimly, then studied Quan Yi closely before gently reassuring him, “Fellow Daoist Quan, even the Purple Mansion Realm Maha of the great void are watching. One military force facing off against one pass is like a game of Go, where each move is carefully calculated. They surely won’t allow the enemy to concentrate forces and strike this valley all at once...”

Yu Yuwei, after all, was a seasoned cultivator. Normally, he wouldn’t speak such blunt truths that might draw trouble. But when he saw the enemy right before them and Quan Yi still wavering, he had no choice but to explain the stakes and steady his resolve.

Sure enough, after a few seconds of observation, the seven streams of black smoke each descended toward different fortress passes, leading groups of demonic forces to fight separately. Quan Yi calmed down slightly, and only one white escape light rode the wind and flew forward from that swirling demonic aura.

This light carried no accompanying troops, nor did it emit any demonic qi. It flew cleanly through the mass of black smoke raised by the other devil cultivators, untainted by a single speck of filth.

Li Xizhi grew wary and thought to himself, That must be a direct descendant of the Tuoba Family!

Yu Yuwei also looked grim and spoke up first, “I’ve heard that the Tuoba Family’s Liang Dynasty was founded by orthodox devil cultivators. Back then, Tuoba Xuantan established the Great Liang State and revered the Immortal Dao as the highest truth. Their feathered robes and attire all followed the Wei Dynasty...”

They each raised their dharma artifacts and ascended into the air. Outside the formation, the white mist surged, and the white light slowly took form. It revealed a white jade chariot, gleaming with bursts of dharma light. The rolling white mist in front of it was drawn by two illusory horned beasts with faintly red eyes. The chariot slowly came to a halt before the formation.

Seated atop the chariot was a man with righteous features. His face was square and broad, his brows thick, and his eyes so dark they were startling. His gaze was cold and naturally commanding.

He wore a perfectly tailored white robe that had a band of jade-like white around his collar, with platinum-gold patterns flowing down. He wore a tall crown and wide belt, and his feathered ceremonial robes exuded immense grandeur. He carried the bearing of orthodox immortal rites, walking on clouds with poise and grace.

The Tuoba Family had descended from the northern barbarians. After several centuries, their ceremonial attire was even more doctrinal than that of several Jiangnan sects.

When he reached the formation, he stepped down from the chariot and spoke in a low voice, “Fellow Daoists of the south, come out and meet me.”

They had a mere Qi Cultivation Realm formation that was symbolic at best. Even the Li Family found Foundation Establishment Realm arrays difficult to set up, so how could the Azure Pond Sect possibly place a major Foundation Establishment Realm formation here? Thus, before cultivators of that realm, the formation would last no more than seven minutes. The group exchanged glances and flew out of the formation together.

The man in white merely frowned when five Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators appeared. He paid no attention to Yu Yuwei’s two newly advanced disciples, as if they were invisible, letting his gaze pause only on Yu Yuwei and Li Xizhi.

He didn’t move, nor did the others attack. Instead, they listened as he shook his white sleeve and said in a deep voice, “Shengle Heaven, Tuoba Chongyuan.”

As he spoke, he drew a golden-jade seal from his sleeve, streaked with white and yellow. When he saw that Li Xizhi and the others didn’t recognize the gesture and remained silent, he chuckled and said, “Chongyuan has long been in the North, let me show the means of Jiangnan’s demonic sects!”

Five rays of light surged into the air as soon as he finished speaking. Li Xizhi drew his fan with one hand and formed seals with the other, unleashing radiant light. Yu Yuwei and his two disciples joined forces, forming seals to release a sweeping beam of white light.

Though Quan Yi had just spoken of retreat, he fought earnestly once battle commenced. Knowing he was slightly weaker than the other three, he immediately revealed his Immortal Foundation, his entire body shining with radiant brilliance.
𝒇𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝙚𝒃𝒏𝓸𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝒎

His Immortal Foundation belonged to the Soft Advance essence of the Twelve Essences, also known as Auspicious Qi. Golden clouds gathered beneath his feet as he pulled two golden cords from each hand, wrapping them around his fingers, though he had yet to unleash them.

Li Xizhi took note for a moment and silently thought, This Quan Yi... always insists on letting us probe first... making a lot of noise but achieving little.

Just as that thought passed through his mind, Tuoba Chongyuan made his move. A white wind surged forth with a sweep of his long sleeve, transforming into a beast midair and instantly shattering their spells.

Tuoba Chongyuan’s expression relaxed as he smiled and said, “You fellow Daoists truly underestimate me... Why bother probing with such trivial spells? Though the Tuoba Family has long resided in a grotto heaven, we still possess some measure of foundation.”

Li Xizhi listened carefully, his thoughts turning. However, Yu Yuwei’s face darkened when he saw their combined spell swatted aside like flies by Tuoba Chongyuan.

He sighed. “Whether fortune or disaster... it cannot be avoided in the end.”

Yu Yuwei formed hand seals, and a small cauldron with two handles and three legs dropped from his sleeve. It was covered in complex patterns and was glowing purple-red. When it emerged, the lid suddenly flipped open, spewing out raging flames of violet and crimson.

Li Xizhi reached for the sword at his waist, stepped forward, and unleashed an arc of sword light that howled as it flew across the sky toward Tuoba Chongyuan. Though Li Xizhi focused on spell arts and had not dedicated himself to the sword path, and was already outshone by his younger brother in that regard, his natural talent and swordsmanship were solid. When he drew his sword, it was still something worth witnessing.

Since his compatriots had engaged the enemy in battle, Quan Yi finally used his true strength and activated his Immortal Foundation. Auspicious qi rose as he formed circular hand seals, his thumbs pressed against his middle fingers which released a blast of yellow wind.

The yellow wind stirred and expanded in the air, forming a hazy veil that seemed to obscure spiritual sense. It kicked up snow from the mountains and cast shadows everywhere, prompting Li Xizhi to tighten his grip on his sword and think, This spell is indeed effective against ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. It would even be quite potent. But against someone like Tuoba Chongyuan... even without perception techniques, it’s probably just a minor nuisance at best.

As for Yu Yuwei’s two disciples, they were even more pathetic. Reaching Foundation Establishment Realm at sixty had already pushed them to their limits. What proper spells could they even cast? The two spells they managed to send drifted lazily through the air, not even warranting a blink from Tuoba Chongyuan.

Tuoba Chongyuan simply formed two seals in the air, leaving golden markings behind. A casual sweep of his sleeve reduced the spells to ashes. Li Xizhi took the opportunity to observe and silently noted, This man’s dharma robe is no ordinary garment... there’s definitely something profound about that sleeve...

He continued to form seals and cast spells, but he watched as Tuoba Chongyuan released a golden radiance from the patterns, effortlessly deflecting the sword light. It grazed his sleeve and flew off. Meanwhile, Tuoba Chongyuan threw out a jade tablet with his other hand.

The tablet appeared ordinary, with pale markings and a gentle glow. However, when it landed on the cauldron, the violet-red flames were instantly extinguished. The cauldron flickered weakly twice before retreating in defeat.

At that moment, the light in Li Xizhi’s hand suddenly pulsed. A condensed rainbow beam shot out at incredible speed, darting through the sky straight at Tuoba Chongyuan’s face.
𝘧𝓇ℯ𝑒𝓌𝑒𝑏𝓃𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝒸ℴ𝓂

At the same time, Yu Yuwei leapt into action, his beard bristling and eyes fierce as he shouted, “Hyah!”

Before the shout had fully left his mouth, a handful of golden light leapt from between his lips and teeth, flickering once before turning into a stream of light that shot forward. Quan Yi also gritted his teeth and finally flung out his two golden cords. One after the other, the golden cords slithered like snakes through the air.

Tuoba Chongyuan’s smile dimmed slightly as he focused on the coordinated attacks coming at him. The first strike to arrive was Li Xizhi’s rainbow light. This move was one of the rare offensive arts in the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique, known as Morning Rainbow Lure. Though Li Xizhi rarely practiced offensive arts, he had trained in this quite often. Now that it was unleashed, it was incredibly swift.

A morning glow spell art.

Tuoba Chongyuan’s eyes shifted. He raised his hand, trying to repeat his earlier trick by swiping his sleeve to disperse it. But the rainbow beam suddenly burst into eight streaks of multicolored light, scattering and reforming behind him in sync with his movement. Tuoba Chongyuan struck empty air and frowned.

But in that brief moment of delay, Quan Yi’s golden cords arrived. Clearly not seeing him as a threat, Tuoba Chongyuan casually pushed out two waves of white light to block the cords. But Quan Yi activated his Immortal Foundation and his face glowed with rising qi. The cords pierced straight through the white light and hooked onto Tuoba’s robes.

“Why are all of you using these petty side-door tricks?!” shouted Tuoba Chongyuan.

Boom!

The man finally lost his patience. He shattered the golden cords into countless sparkles with a vicious flick of his sleeve. Retracting his hand cleanly, white demonic patterns appeared on his face as he punched the air.

A thunderous boom rang out as a streak of golden light was forced out of hiding. Tuoba Chongyuan grabbed it with a reverse motion, flinching slightly from the heat, then flung it aside with a burst of multicolored light, growling, “Old Daoist! That’s not how you use Sand-Swallowing Sword Nourishment!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he grasped a bright, slender spear in his hand, its elegant lines flowing like water. White markings appeared across his face as he held it with both hands. It seemed he had activated a secret technique

His voice turned low and resonant, “Strike!”

He moved like an agile ape, spinning the spear in a blur of afterimages. He shattered both the rainbow and golden lights in a single sweep, blasting apart twin bursts of dazzling color. Tuoba Chongyuan laughed heartily and exhaled a puff of white breath.

In the next instant, the group's spell arts surged forward, only to strike nothing but a phantom image. The Tuoba Family’s footwork technique was clearly superior to everyone present, Tuoba Chongyuan vanished into thin air without leaving the slightest trace.

Gold in Cloud!

Li Xizhi was the first to react, transforming into a flickering rainbow light. He reappeared several meters away, only to see a golden afterimage tearing through the air, hurtling toward Yu Yuwei.

The old man was startled out of his wits. Though he had lived many years, he vanished like a startled hare at this critical moment, leaving behind two disciples who fled in panic. A light flick of Tuoba Chongyuan’s long spear shattered their defensive techniques, leaving them pale-faced and defenseless.

Tuoba Chongyuan smiled faintly and seemed to mouth something. As his lips moved, everyone felt their hairs stand on end and instinctively backed away. A piercing screech followed, leaving golden dust hanging heavily in the air and scattering radiant light in all directions.

Wong...

Li Xizhi felt the light before him suddenly dim. He vaguely saw the floating golden dust above gathering into a brilliant arc that shot downward through his field of vision. It flickered once, and vanished.

Pfft!

The disciple behind Yu Yuwei spat out blood. His face turned gold and white, and his body cracked like a shattered eggshell, exploding into a rain of blood that slowly drifted down.

Chunks of flesh scattered, but before they could fall, they transformed into golden falling leaves, accompanied by the faint fragrance of osmanthus.

The remaining disciple was so terrified he lost his entire soul. He was still stumbling backward when Tuoba Chongyuan’s voice echoed across the sky, “Old Daoist! This is Sand-Swallowing Sword Nourishment!”

The slain disciple had become an ominous phenomenon between heaven and earth. The rustling golden leaves fell behind Tuoba Chongyuan, slowly blanketing the snow-covered mountains. Everyone was struck speechless.

The old man’s eyes turned red as he cried out in grief, “My child!... Ai!”

In just a few exchanges, Tuoba Chongyuan had already found an opening and killed someone with two moves. How could the others not feel deeply shaken? The strength he revealed was stunning. Only Li Xuanfeng, the mountain’s guardian, might rival him...

A brief moment of silence passed before radiant glow burst forth again toward Tuoba Chongyuan. Yu Yuwei had gone completely berserk; he hurled his purple-red cauldron forward and swallowed a crimson pill, activating his Immortal Foundation. Waves and mist rose from his body, painting him in deep oceanic blue.

Li Xizhi fully activated his Immortal Foundation, Universal Dawn Mist. His feathered robe shimmered with streaks of Heavenly Glow that danced around its edges. The misty rainbow fog spread rapidly with the steam, and bands of seven-colored light emerged in the air, winding steadily toward Tuoba Chongyuan.

Tuoba Chongyuan spun his spear to block their attacks, moving with practiced ease, as if he was strolling through a courtyard. He said softly, “So, the two of you have finally revealed your Immortal Foundations.”

At this point in the battle, no one could stop Tuoba Chongyuan from speaking as he pleased. Raising an eyebrow, he continued, “Very good, very good. The Dao of the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm... truly has some connection to my own. What a curious and amusing display!”

Yu Yuwei’s remaining disciple gritted his teeth and rode the wind, casting spells from the side. Quan Yi, however, was momentarily stunned. He stared blankly at the golden leaves drifting down from the death phenomenon of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Only after a second did he snap out of it and join the other two in their assault.

Tuoba Chongyuan narrowed his eyes and chuckled lightly. At last, he revealed the seal from earlier and said softly, “Watch closely, everyone!”

He tossed the great seal high into the air. The interwoven yellow and white light surged upward, instantly filling the entire valley. The golden seal rose dazzlingly, and in a flash, transformed into several large words, Shengle Tuoba.

The two ancient-style words glowed with dazzling dharma light, weaving intense color in the sky. Li Xizhi felt the brushstrokes seemed familiar but had no time to ponder it as Yu Yuwei cast a jade-scissors spell that struck the seal.

Boom!

The impact only caused the seal to sway slightly. The intertwined yellow and white light descended from the sky and transformed into a deep-colored barrier. The bright barrier shimmered as yellow and white light flowed across it like ink, enveloping an area several kilometers wide in all directions.

Rumble!

The barrier closed with a thunderous roar. Yu Yuwei’s face turned grim, and Quan Yi's expression shifted to regret as he cried out in alarm, “This is bad! We should’ve left long ago!”




# Chapter 771: Formation Seal

“Everyone!”

Dark radiance surged from Tuoba Chongyuan’s body. He appeared especially luminous within the formation formed by the great seal. The spear in his hand emitted a fearsome edge.

Quan Yi’s expression turned grim, his heart cold as ice, as he shouted, “So that's your skill! Not even a hundred exchanges and you’ve already resorted to this dharma artifact! How insidious... If you intended to kill us from the start, you needn’t have gone through all this!”

Tuoba Chongyuan remained calm and simply said, “You jest, Fellow Daoist. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators outside Shengle Heaven are treacherous and the Maha terrifying. As with all things, caution must come first. Treating every encounter as a life-or-death struggle is the way to preserve one's life.”

His expression grew solemn, and his words caused everyone’s expressions to turn complicated.

Yu Yuwei had long since lost his former composure and said coldly, “Fellow Daoists, we are now grasshoppers bound to the same rope, there’s no retreat left. Let’s stop hesitating and act!”

Quan Yi remained silent. He extended his two golden cords, auspicious qi surging around him. He took out two pills from his sleeve and swallowed them, saying heavily, “I understand now.”

There had always been something hidden in Quan Yi’s heart that he dared not say. His Immortal Foundation vaguely sensed fortune and misfortune. He had long suspected there would be no good ending in this valley. He should have fled. But he had been unwilling to abandon his companions, and mindful of dragging his mother into it, he had delayed and lingered.

Now that escape was no longer possible, his demeanor became instantly resolute. His entire presence transformed. The pills he had taken burned through his lifespan, but his aura surged more powerfully than ever.

Li Xizhi did not hesitate. He flipped out a gold-blue pill he had long kept hidden in his sleeve.

The pill was called Autumn Convergence Pill, something he had secretly obtained through Yang Ruizao. Once he had been chased all the way by Dongfang Heyun, he’d realized early the necessity of preparing life-saving pills. Coming north was even more dangerous, so he had prepared well in advance.

Before he departed, his wife had even slipped him an ancient Foundation Establishment Realm talisman, which still rested in his storage pouch. He hadn’t used it yet. Such ancient talismans were far more potent than modern ones. Each one consumed was one less remaining, they were exceedingly precious.

Once consumed, the Autumn Convergence Pill boosted mana and stimulated one’s Dao foundation. It not only rapidly restored his mana, but also significantly strengthened his spell arts, at the cost of about three years of vital qi and lifespan.

Li Xizhi quickly swallowed the pill, summoned his rainbow light, and let waves of Heavenly Glow ripple from his body. Only then did Tuoba Chongyuan grow solemn, raising his long spear to point at them.
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝒆𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝙤𝒗𝓮𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

He declared, “Fellow Daoists, seeking the Dao, preserving life, protecting our nature. Let us fight for one final chance.”

Rumble!

Yu Yuwei’s hatred had already driven him to the edge, his lips trembling with rage. He hurled the purple-red cauldron with reckless abandon. Its three legs and two handles shone with light, and red light burst from the carved patterns as flames erupted from the cracks. It slammed down with a deafening boom.

Clang!

Tuoba Chongyuan raised his long spear horizontally. The spear’s streamlined, elegant form radiated light that held off the engulfing purple flames. Yu Yuwei had truly gone all in, not caring whether his dharma artifact would be damaged. He attacked relentlessly and even managed to momentarily stymie his opponent.

None of them had any path of retreat, so there were no more probing strikes. Li Xizhi was cloaked in radiant light, rainbow mist pouring down like waterfalls. Tuoba Chongyuan’s movements were quickly restricted, and spell after spell rained down upon him, striking his dharma robe and forcing its defenses to ripple.

Quan Yi lacked powerful backers, and no one knew how many years of his lifespan he had sacrificed through the pills. It was particularly brutal. Deep yellow tears flowed from his eyes as his golden cords looped tightly around Tuoba Chongyuan’s waist and back, binding him with all his might.

Blows rained down on Tuoba Chongyuan from all directions, and his breathing grew heavier. He swept his long spear more savagely than before, his eyes shining with a fierce brilliance.

“Good!”

Born within a grotto heaven, he lacked for nothing in terms of spell arts. His cultivation methods were also superior to most. The only exception was his spear technique. It was decent, but rather conventional. But even with a few techniques under his belt, something was still missing.

Now, the deadly assault of three foes was exhilarating. His spirit soared, and his spear danced fluidly through the air, flowing with unstoppable momentum.

But Yu Yuwei had lived over two hundred years and was sharp-eyed. He quickly noticed something was off.

Furious, he cursed, “You little brat! You’re using this old man as a whetstone!”

He spat out a mouthful of blood into his palm and a jade knife appeared. Without hesitation, he plunged it into his own hand, gouging out a talisman.

The talisman was small and agile; it glowed with a snowy luster. Blood dripped from Yu Yuwei’s lips as he shouted, “Hyah!”

Two streams of violet flame burst into existence like flood dragons and slithered across the talisman’s densely packed runes. Li Xizhi’s eyes lit up; he could tell this was likely Yu Yuwei’s ultimate trump card. He immediately formed several seals, suppressing the urge to cough blood, and released multiple arcs of rainbow light to restrain Tuoba Chongyuan.

Yu Yuwei guided the two violet flames, hesitating for only a brief moment. As a veteran cultivator, he had already discerned something amiss, This jade seal seems formidable; it’s surely an ancient dharma artifact! If I strike it and the formation wavers... Li Xizhi and Quan Yi will surely grow restless and possibly try to escape alone, which would ruin everything!

Besides, such ancient dharma artifacts are often bound to their owner's spirit. If we wound Tuoba Chongyuan directly, there’s no worry the artifact won’t falter!

These thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant. He made his decision without hesitation and hurled the flames at Tuoba Chongyuan. The latter struggled forcefully, paling at the effort and causing Li Xizhi to cough blood, and managed to free one hand.

But Quan Yi, whose body was surging with auspicious qi, suddenly spat a mouthful of vital blood, visibly withering in an instant. His two golden cords surged upward and tightly bound Tuoba Chongyuan’s arm, pinning it firmly to his side.

Boom!

The two violet flames exploded, shaking the entire barrier formation twice. Ripples of instability appeared across its surface. Caught off guard, Tuoba Chongyuan was engulfed by violet flames and spat out blood.

“You—!”

Broken out of his focused state, Tuoba Chongyuan was now cloaked in black smoke. He clutched his face and fell silent. Finally, two streaks of blood trickled down his cheeks, transforming into gray wind at his chin and dispersing into nothingness.

Tuoba Chongyuan continued to dodge attacks, but he coughed up two more mouthfuls of blood before recovering enough to open his eyes.

Yu Yuwei’s strike had been vicious, and had been aimed squarely at Tuoba Chongyuan’s eyes. Blood streamed from both of them, and the entire formation trembled violently.

Yu Yuwei instantly confirmed his suspicion.

At the same time, though Li Xizhi had never handled ancient dharma artifacts before, he saw through it at a glance and said gravely, “This man’s life may be linked to the artifact! Right now, it only imprisons, it hasn’t attacked. Hurting him together is our chance to break free!”

Li Xizhi had already voiced Yu Yuwei’s thoughts before he could speak them aloud. Sure enough, his disciple and Quan Yi both lit up with realization and a ruthless gleam flashed through their eyes.

Tuoba Chongyuan wiped his face and realized that his perception technique had been broken. The world before him was now faint and blurry. His blood stirred with fury.

He pointed his long spear toward the group once again, battle intent surging, and said coldly, “Not bad—come again!”




# Chapter 772: The Battle Under The Great Seal

But Li Xizhi had already drawn his sword and arrived, several flashes of light flickering and falling, before Tuoba Chongyuan could finish speaking. Quan Yi also retracted his golden cords and struck with a palm imprint of golden light. Tuoba Chongyuan merely raised his spear to block, and the two forces clashed.

Quan Yi’s strike made the long spear tremble. Tuoba Chongyuan shifted slightly, stretching out his ape-like arm to block Li Xizhi, only to discover that the man in the feathered robe was still forming a spell gesture. Just as Tuoba Chongyuan’s arm touched him, he turned into a misty haze.

Rainbow Phantom Split.

Taking advantage of the moment his opponent’s perception technique was broken, Li Xizhi split into multiple illusions that scattered in different directions. His true form emerged behind Tuoba Chongyuan, and with a spell gesture, Morning Rainbow Lure surged forth, striking directly at his back.

However, Tuoba Chongyuan’s dharma robe was extremely tough. Even after taking a direct hit, his face merely paled further. He dispersed three of the illusions with a sweeping motion. His spear shimmered with golden light as it spun and gently flicked against Yu Yuwei’s large purple-red cauldron.

Yu Yuwei was a seasoned cultivator and posed the greatest threat. Tuoba Chongyuan’s spear strike was meant to hold the cauldron back. Dark red veins appeared on his arm, and his blood energy churned violently. Clearly, he had suffered a loss, yet the purple flame within the cauldron managed to surge past the lid and lick at his dao robe.

Tuoba Chongyuan felt a slight pain in his arm and calculated silently, This man in the feathered robe is light and elusive; he's not one suited for direct combat. I’ve already seen through his perception technique, chasing him down would be a waste of time! The man with the golden cords is weak and cowardly. He’s unwilling to confront me directly. The others are mediocre. The most urgent task is to eliminate this old Daoist!

He summoned another jade tablet and effortlessly suppressed the flame in the cauldron. He then took two steps through the air, his figure lunging forward like a phantom.

Yu Yuwei was unafraid. His beard and hair flared outward as he held a purple flame in each hand. A spell brought flames down like a storm, while violet smoke coiled around him. Hatred flared in his heart as well, This brat’s dharma robe is powerful, and he has many artifacts, along with two deadly spells... But the spear in his hand is quite ordinary...

Though formidable, he relies heavily on external tools. His spells are lethal, but if we act together, there’s still a chance of victory!

He conjured flames to block Tuoba Chongyuan’s spear. Bluish water mist emerged as his Immortal Foundation circulated. Water and fire combined, and ferocity twisted his face, suiting his wild appearance.

Yu Yuwei had been born when the Yu Family still basked in its former glory. He and several younger clansmen had been among the last generation of geniuses. At that time, the Yu Family had not yet splintered and faded into obscurity. The techniques and spells he had cultivated were of the highest tier. Now, as he unleashed his might, water and fire intertwined, making for an imposing display.

Yet Tuoba Chongyuan remained indifferent. He merely furrowed his brow and spun his spear to defend. Quan Yi threw out his golden cords to entangle him, while Li Xizhi maneuvered to the side with Heavenly Glow and used rainbow light to assist.

Although Tuoba Chongyuan was far stronger than them, having his perception technique broken made it much harder to deal with Li Xizhi. His initial strikes often left Yu Yuwei pale and Quan Yi spitting blood, yet he still couldn’t catch Li Xizhi.

The three exchanged dozens of moves. Though some on Li Xizhi’s side occasionally coughed up blood, what were a few mouthfuls of blood when lives were at stake? They relentlessly trapped Tuoba Chongyuan as they wore down his mana.

Whoosh...

Struck in the back again by the rainbow light, Tuoba Chongyuan gripped his spear with both hands, his expression darkening. His dharma artifact spun in his grasp as he formed a spell gesture, pressing two fingers together to emit a burst of dharma light.

Strangely enough, though the Tuoba Family was a prestigious devil cultivator family, Tuoba Chongyuan only gave off immortal aura during the battle. There was no trace of demonic or blood qi. Even the techniques he used were upright and righteous immortal arts.
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝘦𝓌𝑒𝑏𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝘭.𝒸𝘰𝑚

Naturally, the others wouldn’t let him have his way. Almost as soon as Tuoba Chongyuan stopped moving, multiple spell arts rained down. Prepared, he shifted the spell gesture to one hand, while the other reversed his grip on the spear to shield himself.

At the same time, his sleeve flared high, releasing a wave of pure energy. The spells blasted their way through it, but the energy wave had drained forty percent of their power. One by one, they struck the spear, exploding in dazzling brilliance, sending hues in all directions.

Though his face turned a shade paler from the impact, Tuoba Chongyuan subtly smiled, loosening his grip slightly to absorb the force. Then, his pupils suddenly widened.

Gold In Cloud!

Three brilliant beams of colored light abruptly appeared over ten meters away, leaping forward in an instant. Li Xizhi suddenly appeared, flinging out a sleeveful of Heavenly Glow that dispersed through the air like mist and silk.

The man in the feathered robe reached out without hesitation and, to everyone's surprise, gripped the sharp edge of the spear. Vibrant rainbow light rippled from his palm.

Floating Light Gathering!

Heavenly Glow was naturally good at knocking down and seizing objects. Tuoba Chongyuan’s focus had been split and he had been bombarded by spells, so he naturally had to loosen his grip slightly to absorb the blows. Li Xizhi saw the opening and closed in with Gold In Cloud to snatch the weapon.

An instant later, Tuoba Chongyuan felt a sudden lightness in his hand. His half-relaxed grip gave way completely. The scene before him spun briefly, and his spear was already in Li Xizhi’s hands!

The spear felt cool to the touch; it was smooth and solid. It was made from extremely tough material, and Li Xizhi could feel spiritual energy surging from within. It was a top-grade dharma artifact, only comparable to his own Qingche Sword.

Li Xizhi drew back with the spear, but blood instantly split his palm open in several places. His skin was torn to the bone and bled freely down to his wrist. Yet he was already forming a spell gesture with the other hand. His middle and ring fingers curled into his palm, and the rest extended like a cauldron.

His face went pale as he shouted, “Senior Yu!”

Yu Yuwei was genuinely startled, but he was quickly elated. His eyebrows shot up with excitement as he cried out, “Good!”

The purple cauldron immediately surged forward. Even without Yu Yuwei’s orders, Quan Yi and the other disciples launched fierce attacks at Tuoba Chongyuan, forcing him to lose the chance to take back his spear.

A furious surge of indignation, like capsizing in a gutter, filled Tuoba Chongyuan’s heart. He was so enraged he nearly lost control of the spell he was about to complete.

His brows shot up, and he roared like spring lightning, “How dare you?!”

White light flared In his other hand, transforming into six white ribbons trailing long tails. Astonishingly, he withstood the barrage of spell arts with just a wave of his sleeve, while he threw a strike toward Li Xizhi with his other hand.

Six dazzling beams of white light sizzled through the air. Li Xizhi barely managed to cast Gold In Cloud, part of his Heavenly Glow escape spell. His figure shifted dozens of meters to the side, forcing the six streaks of white light to arc low. Meanwhile, the dharma seal in his hand was already complete.

Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron!

The very first spell art Li Xizhi had learned after joining the sect was this life-saving technique. Now, a faint cauldron of Heavenly Glow manifested in his hands as he poured all his mana into it without restraint. He even drew in surrounding spiritual energy in torrents to fuel his spell art.

The streaks of white light were astonishingly fast. Even though Li Xizhi had shifted to the other side of the battlefield with his escape spell, the white light reversed direction instantly and shot toward him. The beams paused for a moment before plunging directly into the Heart Cauldron in his hands.

Boom!

A chaotic blast of white light erupted in the sky. The spell art in Li Xizhi’s hands held for three full breaths before he flung it away like it was scalding him. But it exploded uncontrollably before he could make his own escape. The sound of bones cracking echoed loudly as he tumbled downward at an angle, coughing up blood.

Purple flames poured down like boiling water, dousing Tuoba Chongyuan’s head and face. Thick white mist burst upward as he lost his grip on his dharma artifact. He was forced to raise both hands to block the massive purple cauldron.

A deep violet-red blood lined Yu Yuwei’s lips, dripping down his white beard as streams of deep blue water and purple flame struck simultaneously.

The elder’s eyes flared with brilliance as he shouted, “Hyah!”

Golden light flickered from his mouth again and vanished into the air. Tuoba Chongyuan’s eyes were bloodshot as his robes rippled wildly. One hand was braced against the searing purple cauldron, filling the air with the scent of scorched flesh, yet his expression remained unchanged.

His other forearm was hooked by two golden cords, which was yanking Quan Yi off balance. The blue water turned into cords that tightly bound his wrists. The three of them worked in concert, not only preventing Tuoba Chongyuan from sweeping his sleeve to dispel spells but even stopping him from forming a single hand seal.

Crackle—snap—

More searing purple flames coiled around his neck, filling the air with the scent of charred flesh. Yet Tuoba Chongyuan continued to crane his neck upward, expression both calm and ruthless, eyes wide as if desperately watching for something.

Crack!

A loud, crisp sound of bone snapping rang out as Tuoba Chongyuan forcibly twisted his own neck to a grotesque angle. His white teeth snapped open and shut with sharp cracks as he panted.

Clang!

His white teeth were freshly stained with blood as he bit down hard on a golden leaf-shaped object. It struggled fiercely between his jaws, producing a grating, tooth-rattling screech that made Yu Yuwei’s expression grow grim.

Boom!

The golden leaf-shaped object lingered for a moment before crumbling into dust and vanishing. White patterns surfaced across Tuoba Chongyuan’s body, and he even had the leisure to laugh.

He said, "Old Daoist, I told you, Sand-Swallowing Sword Nourishment isn't meant to be used like that!"

Golden light flickered like threads of mist between Tuoba Chongyuan's lips and teeth. Suddenly, Quan Yi threw his head back and screamed in agony. The back of his neck was drenched in blood, and he dropped like a bird with broken wings.

The golden cords slackened and Tuoba Chongyuan slowly twisted his dislocated neck back into place, each movement accompanied by loud cracking sounds. The many spell arts surrounding him gradually faded, and gold-red blood flowed back into his wounds along the lines of his skin.

He used The Great Liang Shengle Immortal Yin Art...

The markings on his body became clearer, stretching along the contours of his muscles and bones. Only now did a sinister, eerie aura begin to emerge around him. Naturally, Yu Yuwei couldn’t stand by idly. He thrust the massive cauldron forward to strike.

Boom!

Tuoba Chongyuan gestured gently, and the massive seal in the sky finally responded, crashing down and striking the purple-red fire cauldron with a thunderous bang.

Pfft!

Yu Yuwei's face went pale in an instant. The cauldron flew back, its brilliance dimming. It hovered midair, unmoving, as he struggled for breath for a long moment.

A second later, a pale Li Xizhi rose back into the air. One of his arms was swollen with shattered bones and torn muscles, but he didn’t care. He swallowed another Autumn Convergence Pill.

Taking a single Autumn Convergence Pill usually required years of rest, and if more were taken recklessly, it could shorten one’s lifespan by several decades. The limit was three at once, or else the Immortal Foundation could collapse. But given the current situation, there was no time to worry.

Li Xizhi consumed the pill and waited for his mana to replenish, his gaze heavy and dark.

Crack... crack... crack...

The massive seal in the sky gradually lost its radiance. Streams of white and yellow light cascaded down like a waterfall and poured into Tuoba Chongyuan’s body. Dense, inky-black patterns climbed across his form, spreading thick and fast.

Though Li Xizhi still felt some tightness in his chest, the pill gradually restored him. Watching closely, he confirmed that the surrounding barriers were weakening and dissipating as the seal’s glow faded. So, he waited calmly for the right moment.

Tuoba Chongyuan finally opened his eyes and glanced at the spear in Li Xizhi’s hand. His face shimmered with white and golden hues, and his voice rang like a bell and drum, “In all these decades, only you have dared to seize my dharma artifact... Good...”

Tuoba Chongyuan’s expression was neither jealous nor admiring, but rather excited. Yu Yuwei’s face grew increasingly grim, while behind him, Quan Yi wobbled back into the air. A large portion of his face was missing, and his breath was barely a whisper.

The spell art from Tuoba Chongyuan had shattered most of his cheek and exited through the back of his neck. Though the vitality of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was strong, despair filled his eyes. He floated unsteadily, blood dripping into the air and turning into faint auspicious mist as it scattered.

Yu Yuwei remained silent. Tuoba Chongyuan's gaze shifted slightly as the purple cauldron reappeared, and the rainbow light shot forth once more. Tuoba Chongyuan extended both arms, but struck with one palm, sending the cauldron shuddering violently.

Yu Yuwei’s face turned pale as various streams of mana intertwined in the air. A barely holding on Quan Yi struggled into the sky amid the overlapping lights of magical power. He scanned the area blearily through a half-blinded eye. The great seal above had dimmed, and though the surrounding barrier had thinned, it still stood tall.

If only I had known! thought Quan Yi.

Quan Yi stood in the center, and a long, muffled sigh escaped his ruined mouth. His Immortal Foundation was aligned with Auspicious Qi, a path called Scroll of Fortunate Attainments. He had divined a deadly tribulation awaiting him in the North long ago.

But what use was foresight? It was bound to come. Who among those who had ventured to the North would not face no life-and-death tribulation? In the end, whether it had been foreseen or not made no real difference.

Quan Yi opened his eyes wide and gazed at the great seal, then let out a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering wail, “Fellow Daoists—my mother still remains in the sect!”

His words hung in the air as his entire body transformed into dense layers of golden radiance and lit up the sky. Decades of cultivation in the Scroll of Fortunate Attainments Immortal Foundation were, in an instant, converted by some secret technique into a rune-laced burst of brilliance that shot heavenward.

The dense glow spread out, falling gently over Li Xizhi and Yu Yuwei and bathing their faces and bodies. They felt like they were standing on clouds as their breaths eased and hearts calmed. All of their dharma artifacts trembled slightly.

Be it the purple fire cauldron, the jade tablet thrown by Tuoba Chongyuan, or even the Xia You weapon in Li Xizhi’s hand, all were veiled in a shimmering glow. Li Xizhi and Yu Yuwei were relatively unaffected, but Tuoba Chongyuan clearly frowned as his vision was obscured.

His perception technique had already been shattered, and now his vision was clouded by the brilliance born from a lifetime’s cultivation. He truly couldn't see clearly.

Yu Yuwei sighed and said, “Let’s go!”

The two exchanged a glance and struck together, seizing this brief moment of Tuoba Chongyuan’s distraction and the shrouding of the great seal, and directed their combined power at the barrier.

Crack!

The barrier had already thinned to a mere veil. Their joint attack shattered it instantly, and they shot out of the formation.

Realizing this, Tuoba Chongyuan launched his escape light and tread upon white-yellow qi to pursue.




# Chapter 774: Quantao

Li Xizhi had just stepped out of the grand formation when his eyes, infused with Heavenly Glow, saw a completely different world before him.

Baixiang Valley had once been bathed in a gentle winter sun, its hills lined with maple trees weighed down by snow as soft as white clouds, creating a scene of pure brilliance between heaven and earth. Now, it had turned a dim gray-black, and a hazy gloom stretched as far as the eye could see.

Black clouds now rolled through the sky, the snow had lost its luster, and dense shadows blanketed the forests. The dharma light surrounding the area was now only barely noticeable. Instead, beams of devilish light shot skyward, leaving one dark tail flame after another.

Baixiang Valley had been razed to the ground. Several lonely skeletons stood amid shattered tiles. Their heads had been severed and taken to be used as dharma artifacts. Gray-yellow dust drifted over the surface, and the bone-white remains were still stained with dried blood.

What a wretched land of demonic taint...

Li Xizhi fled swiftly along the mountain pass. A brief glance confirmed that the skeletons belonged to members of the Bai Family. When they had first arrived, the old Bai patriarch had expressed endless gratitude. Who could have thought Azure Pond Sect would use them to fend off the devil cultivators, and only not a single Bai Family member would survive in the end?

There was no time to think further. He opened his palm; what had once been a terrifying wound had now sealed like a small mouth, leaving only a few red seams. Li Xizhi shook out an exquisitely crafted spear from the sleeve of his feathered robe and gripped it tightly.

The spear was already thrashing wildly, its bladed tip flashing incessantly, shedding fragment-like glimmers of light.

As Li Xizhi soared faster and faster on clouds of Heavenly Glow, he formed seals with one hand, tapping the spear from the tail to the bright white center, and finally the thin, razor-sharp blade. Each strike lit up streaks of multicolored light.

This spear can’t be saved. Keeping it will only cause trouble. Judging by Tuoba Chongyuan’s eyes, he’ll come after me for sure... If I discard it at the right time... it might just save my life.

He no longer cared about draining his mana. He layered spell after spell onto the spear in quick succession, sealing it tightly. He let it ride the wind, rapidly forming hand signs and chanting incantations to gather more Heavenly Glow.

Tuoba Chongyuan stepped out of the formation, opened his mouth, and inhaled forcefully. The giant seal in the sky instantly shrank, transforming into the size of a thumb before flying into his mouth.

Tuoba Chongyuan’s expression lit up, his breath steadied significantly, and the dimness in his eyes began to fade. He swept the area with a quick glance and unhesitatingly abandoned Yu Yuwei to pursue Li Xizhi on radiant light.

"Second Young Master!"

The moment Tuoba Chongyuan exited the formation and swallowed the seal, two streaks of black qi rode the clouds toward him. Two devil cultivators emerged, bowing low and keeping their eyes averted.

"Second Young Master... would you have us..."

Tuoba Chongyuan was rising on the wind. He furrowed his brows, and with a flick of his sleeve, he sent them stumbling backward.

He commanded, "Go catch that old Daoist and bring him back."

As he ascended into the sky, a chariot rushed through rolling clouds and halted beneath him. Tuoba Chongyuan sat cross-legged in serenity, silently regulating his breath. The chariot beneath him tore after Li Xizhi on its own.

Ahead, Li Xizhi's eyes were glowing with gathered Heavenly Glow. He cautiously buried the radiance beneath his feet and dove into the heavy mist, only to see black smoke swirling as a devil cultivator hurtled toward him.

The devil cultivator held a large shield, and was clad in black robes. His narrow eyes gleamed from beneath as he shouted, "You're not getting away, boy!"

Late-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm?

Li Xizhi instantly saw through the man's intentions and let out a snort of laughter, He saw me leave the formation wounded and assumed I had little mana left. He’s not being vigilant at all... Banking on his large shield and the devil cultivator’s tenacious life force, he wants to gamble on killing me to curry favor with Tuoba Chongyuan!

But this devil cultivator had miscalculated. Li Xizhi had already anticipated interference and had long prepared a spell in his hand. Now, as he darted toward his attacker, he unleashed a burst of Heavenly Glow.

The devil cultivator had been overly optimistic, and Li Xizhi’s spell was no mere minor technique. The Heavenly Glow burned through the shield as if it wasn’t even there and smashed into the cultivator's face.

Boom!

Ripples of multicolored light surged as the devil cultivator was blown apart on the spot. His flesh quickly separated from his blood and bones under the caress of Heavenly Glow, scattering pale skeleton fragments in all directions.

Li Xizhi didn’t even pause and continued to shoot forward. He hadn’t lost much time to this obstacle. A flicker of Heavenly Glow carried him forward just a heartbeat before the gray mist behind him parted to reveal a lavish chariot.

Tuoba Chongyuan sat cross-legged in the chariot as the devil cultivator’s broken body still writhed in midair, with pieces of flesh dropping off in chunks. Tuoba Chongyuan didn’t even glance at him as the chariot sped past, leaving behind only the fading wails of the devil cultivator.

Li Xizhi had only put a little distance between him and the battlefield before realizing Tuoba Chongyuan had already caught up. Though his Heavenly Glow gave him far greater speed than ordinary cultivators, it was still no match for the divine chariot, and he could only let the other slowly gain on him.

Tuoba Chongyuan opened his eyes aboard the chariot and called out. "Fellow Daoist..."

Li Xizhi saw that the surrounding devil cultivators had been left far behind and that he was approaching a more open area. Only then did he retrieve his spear.

There were too many devil cultivators before, all Tuoba Chongyuan’s dogs. If I threw the spear then, they’d just fetch it, and he wouldn’t be distracted...

But now, we’re in a clear open stretch, I’ve flown a good distance, and there’s no demonic smoke in sight. This is the right time.

He tossed the spear into the air and kicked its tail. It shot forward like an arrow, streaking rapidly toward the south before vanishing into the layers of clouds.

Tuoba Chongyuan immediately formed a hand seal. But when he saw that his dharma artifact was not returning, he immediately understood that the feathered robe cultivator ahead had sealed its spiritual sense.

He chuckled softly, and his voice boomed like a great bell as he said, "Fellow Daoist, you're overthinking it. Even if I did lose my dharma artifact... who would dare pick up something from the Tuoba Family? Killing you will take only fifteen minutes. I can retrieve it afterward."

Li Xizhi completely ignored him. He slapped both his wrists dozens of times until a talisman leapt into his palm. He flicked his sleeve and it lit up, shooting straight toward the rear.

The talisman turned into a gloomy gray cloth the moment it left his palm. The sounds of drums and gongs rang out around him, accompanied by eerie giggles and wails, as incense smoke filled the air. The cloth expanded as if it was inflated, spinning and leaping through the air like a great bird in flight.

It was naturally the ancient talisman Yang Ruizao had given him!

Tuoba Chongyuan, riding in his chariot, paused for the first time, frowning as he looked at the gray cloth. He thought, Someone from the Underworld...

As he was born into a family with a grotto heaven, Tuoba Chongyuan was extremely well-informed, especially about the southern regions. The gray cloth released by the talisman looked all too familiar and clearly bore the traits of the Underworld. His frown deepened as he thought, It looks just like Judge Yang’s Nine-Layer Attribute Net from the Zhenan Office... Could his surname be Yang?

He pondered to himself, and sure enough, the gray cloth delayed him. The spell art he had been preparing in his hand flared to life, six streaks of white light striking the cloth from both sides, only to be completely absorbed and vanishing without a trace.

It’s just an old talisman... No matter. I’ll capture him first and ask questions later.

He quickly dismissed his thoughts and formed a hand seal. A white-yellow lotus bloomed in his palm, its nine petals crisp and distinct. It fell into the cloth, which stretched and strained but only showed faint cracks.

But Tuoba Chongyuan had achieved his aim. He placed one hand beneath his middle finger and tapped it lightly with his pinky. The chariot roared as it crashed into the cloth, while his figure reappeared beyond it, continuing the chase.

This talisman is even better than I expected... Li Xizhi felt significantly more at ease having blocked Tuoba Chongyuan twice in a row. After passing several small hills, a checkpoint appeared ahead. But there was no joy on Li Xizhi’s face, only solemn focus.

Just as expected, no cultivators came to assist from the checkpoint. Instead, a glowing grand formation separated the inside from the outside, completely cutting off the road to the south.

“As expected...” said Li Xizhi.

The commotion between Li Xizhi and Tuoba Chongyuan had been quite loud and eye-catching. The chariot racing through the skies must have been visible for kilometers away. Tuoba Chongyuan was clearly not without cunning. He had shouted his family name loudly on purpose, cutting off any chance of Li Xizhi receiving aid.

Since the checkpoint was sealed, Li Xizhi felt a chill in his heart, though he bore no resentment. He could only change direction and continue fleeing.

If they deactivated the guarding formation for me... Tuoba Chongyuan would follow right in. They might lose the checkpoint for no reason, and even risk offending the Tuoba Family. If I were them, I wouldn’t deactivate it either for a stranger...

Instead, closing the gate and staying silent is the safest move; no one can find fault in that. After all, who’s to say this isn’t just a ruse to trick them into deactivating the formation...

He soon passed another small valley, where the formation was likewise in place, guarding the area tightly. Li Xizhi could only pour all his mana and movement techniques into the Heavenly Glow beneath his feet, quietly gripping his final Autumn Convergence Pill in his hand.

When he chanced a look back at Tuoba Chongyuan, Li Xizhi saw that the great seal above his head had already been summoned. The four words Shengle Tuoba shone brilliantly in gold, visible even from a great distance.

————

Chengdu Pass.

Chengdu Pass was originally the mountain gate of Xuandu Gate, a minor sect in Xu State. However, the sect had been wiped out long ago during the devil plague, leaving behind a decent mountain range that had been later occupied by devil cultivators.

After the Azure Pond Sect claimed the mountain, they stationed men to guard it. Li Quantao, still wearing mourning clothes for his late father, rushed to the mountain without delay.

The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator originally stationed in the mountain was a stranger. He claimed to be from the Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest and gave the name Yuan Huyuan. He appeared to be quite old, with a pale and aged face, and at first, he didn’t speak much.

Li Quantao had cultivated within the sect his whole life, rarely leaving his father’s peak. He believed himself to be lacking in schemes or social skills, and since he wasn’t familiar with the Yuan Family, he didn’t bother interacting with Yuan Huyuan.

But after fighting side by side for a while, they eventually found common ground. Yuan Huyuan always responded smoothly to any topic, making conversations surprisingly pleasant.

"Judging by the change in weather... I’d say Baixiang Valley’s been struck by devil cultivators!" Li Quantao spoke casually, but Yuan Huyuan’s face fell.

His aged eyes stared into the distance as he muttered vaguely, "Baixiang Valley is guarded by the Li Family. They say it's the third young master of the Li Family, Peak Master Li Xizhi of Changtian Peak... Looks like he's in for a rough time."

Li Quantao’s face immediately filled with worry as he whispered, "That’s true. The Tuoba Family has produced Golden Core Realm cultivators... Though their numbers have declined and they’re no longer as miraculous, they are still direct descendants of the Purple Mansion Realm... they’re not someone anyone can provoke. I hope the peak master can hold on..."

His words were clearly biased, which immediately piqued Yuan Huyuan’s interest. The old man casually asked, “Now that you mention it... you’re also surnamed Li.”

Li Quantao smiled but said nothing. He remembered his father's advice well; if someone made conversation feel too easy, they were likely far more cunning. They hadn’t known each other long, so he dared not say too much.

Yuan Huyuan was just about to probe further when two streaks of light came speeding from the east, shining brightly in the sky. The two immediately grew alert and looked up.

They saw the first streak of light was dimmed, its colors subdued, though a hint of Heavenly Glow could still be discerned. The second streak was faster and had nearly caught up with the tail of the Heavenly Glow.

The trailing light was white and yellow, with a large seal-like object floating above it. Four large characters were clearly visible. The cultivators of Azure Pond had all studied ancient script, and recognized the characters as Shengle Tuoba

Yuan Huyuan stared at the Heavenly Glow ahead, and his heart skipped a beat. A hot emotion stirred within him, and his lips moved involuntarily as he exclaimed, “Xizhi?! He’s actually been chased all the way here!”

Though Yuan Huyuan spoke without intent, Li Quantao had been listening carefully. As soon as he heard the name, it all clicked. The aura of that Heavenly Glow was indeed familiar, one he had surely heard of before.

Looks like it’s the same Li Xizhi who visited my father the other day. My older brother called him a refined young gentleman, so it seems he truly is.

Li Quantao paused in surprise, but quickly snapped back to attention. Alarmed, he grabbed Yuan Huyuan by the arm and shouted, "Deactivate the formation! Senior Yuan, deactivate the formation!"

"Deactivate the... the formation..." Yuan Huyuan jolted in place, fumbling inside his sleeve twice before freezing. He stood there dazedly, images of his children and brothers flashing through his mind. His voice trembled in fear as he said, "That’s the Tuoba Family we’re talking about!"

But Li Quantao tugged harder on his arm, shaking Yuan Huyuan out of his daze. The burning emotion within Yuan Huyuan turned into something vaguely bitter as he cried out again, "Deactivate the formation? Are you mad?! That’s the Tuoba Family! You said to yourself they’re not people to provoke!"

"I said, deactivate it!" Li Quantao erupted, casting aside all pretense of his junior status. His voice thundered in Yuan Huyuan’s ear. Though not fierce by nature, his face was twisted with urgency as he yelled, "Deactivate the formation, Daoist! I must save this man!"

"Are you insane?!" Yuan Huyuan firmly refused. As the controller of the formation, Li Quantao's jade token only allowed for his own passage.

Li Quantao’s eyes reddened with fury as he bit back his temper. "Senior Yuan... this man once did my family a great kindness. Please, deactivate the formation quickly."

"What kind of kindness are we talking about?" Yuan Huyuan would not relent, dodging with questions to steer the conversation away.

But Li Quantao saw through it, his expression turning cold as he answered, "Very well! If you won’t deactivate it... I’ll walk out of this formation myself!"

This was now an entirely different matter. Yuan Huyuan shuddered, overcome with complicated feelings, and exclaimed in shock, "Why go this far?!"

"Why?!" Li Quantao’s fury burned. His eyes blazed, and he slammed his dharma artifact into the wall with a sharp clang, leaving a deep dent. He spoke coldly, "My father bore infamy, living in isolation on Fuchen Peak for centuries while he was hated and scorned by all. Only Li Xizhi acknowledged the Li Family’s old bonds and still visited him!

"When my father attempted his breakthrough, everyone knew it was doomed. In the past, they called him Master Encheng out of gratitude for his pills, but when they saw I couldn’t inherit the Alchemy Dao and had no benefits to offer, not a single person dared to help for fear of the Chi Family!

"Yet, though the Li Family head had just passed, they still scraped together spirit items to aid us. My younger uncle traveled thousands of kilometers to fetch them, and when we tallied the numbers, their contribution exceeded all the others combined!"

Li Quantao didn’t spare Yuan Huyuan another glance. He rose on the wind and shot forward, leaving behind a cold sentence that echoed in the winter air, "Now that Xizhi is in danger, how could I ever face my late father if I turn a blind eye?!"

His eyes were wide with rage and his next words hit the old man like a thunderclap. "Old senior, keep your life if you wish! But I, Quantao, am still young, and I’m not yet stingy!"

In the blink of an eye, Li Quantao was gone as he blurred past the boundaries of the formation. The old man stood there, eyes blank and ice creeping over his body. The winter wind, as if ignoring his Foundation Establishment Realm body, cut through his organs and made him shiver uncontrollably. But his back was drenched in sweat.

Yuan Huyuan’s vision turned white. His thoughts were a blur. The words still echoed in his head, making his teeth chatter as he collapsed onto the wall's edge.

When I caught a cold at six... It felt just like this. The old man suddenly recalled the memory. His face had turned a frosty shade of blue, and he slowly brought out his aged hands, rubbing them together before his chest.




# Chapter 776: Encheng

Li Xizhi had understood early on that guarding the valley was no easy task. If the Tuoba Family sent some random subordinate, they would be fine. But if they sent a direct descendant, then he would need to prepare an escape route.

So he had inquired about the relevant rosters, memorized the approximate layout of the checkpoints surrounding Baixiang Valley, and organized a list of the cultivators stationed at each. Now, he followed the shortest possible route in his flight.

He rode past more than ten strongholds on Heavenly Glow. Most were minor hills and small formations. Some had been razed by devil cultivators, while others were simply too afraid to appear, remaining eerily silent.

He had passed two major formations. One remained sealed shut and the other was surrounded by devil cultivators. It had been too dangerous to approach. That one had originally housed members of the Yang Family, but they were either trapped or dead. No signs of life remained. He could only forge ahead blindly.

Now, his back was soaked with sweat, and his insides in complete disarray. His spiritual sea was nearly empty, and the Heavenly Glow had grown dim. He flew past another small mountain. Its formation was unresponsive, turning him away at the threshold.

Li Xizhi hovered lightly on the dim Heavenly Glow and glanced downward twice. His insides were in turmoil, as danger loomed. He steadied himself with a spell and thought to himself, More than ten formations, and not a single one familiar to my family? Is this just ill fortune... or deliberate plotting?

His Heavenly Glow was like the very image of a dying lamp. He only had one Autumn Convergence Pill left, but he could no longer afford to save it. He quickly calculated, There’s only one pill left, and Tuoba Chongyuan is closing in. The problem won’t be mana exhaustion anymore. I’ll be caught before I even reach Mount Bianyan...

A cold feeling crept across his heart. Chengdu Pass ahead was most likely under the guard of Yuan Huyuan, elder brother to his master Yuan Tuan. The two were already estranged.

The old man is timid and indecisive. He’s eager to keep the peace and please outsiders. Even someone like Yuan Chengdun dared to cut down his own family’s finest. There’s no hope he’ll act with clarity now, thought Li Xizhi.

Even the younger members of the Chi Family found that man’s personality to be spineless. Of course he wouldn’t dare confront the Tuoba Family. He would hesitate even when the two sides weren’t at odds. There was no chance he would open the formation to welcome Li Xizhi.

So Li Xizhi sped up to pass quickly. But unexpectedly, a silvery-white ripple of spiritual energy surged outward to meet him from within Chengdu Pass’s formation.

“Peak Master, I’ve come to aid you!”

Li Xizhi instantly felt a surge of hope. He paused in surprise and quickly saw that the person was not from the Yuan Family.
𝘧𝘳𝘦ℯ𝓌𝘦𝒷𝘯𝑜𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸𝘰𝓂

He guessed they were from the Ning or Yang Families and replied, "Fellow Daoist! We’re already near Mount Bianyan, just delay him a little! Reinforcements are on the way!"

He spoke those words for Tuoba Chongyuan to hear. Li Xizhi quickly formed hand seals, wary of an ambush. With a flick of his finger, the final Autumn Convergence Pill slipped into his mouth.

Tuoba Chongyuan finally frowned, summoning a streak of white light to his palm as he said coldly, “Whose family are you from... stay out of this!”

Li Quantao shook his sleeve, and a warm, lustrous white pearl leapt into the air, shedding radiance as he replied, “This is my family matter, I have no choice but to intervene.”

Tuoba Chongyuan assumed this was one of Li Xizhi’s kin coming to his rescue and his expression darkened. But then, streaks of flowing light burst from the pearl in Li Quantao’s hand, and rose into the clouds. Thunder roared overhead, and droplets of water began to rise from beneath their feet, joining the clouds above.

Li Xizhi immediately felt lighter, and the mana required to ride the Heavenly Glow dropped sharply. Tuoba Chongyuan, momentarily obstructed, gave Li Xizhi a chance to breathe. His complexion regained color, but what caught him off guard was the dharma artifact in the young man’s hand.

That’s the Water Wall Pearl! He’s from Li Encheng’s line!

Li Encheng had been nicknamed Water Wall Pearl precisely because of this very artifact. It was an ancient dharma artifact retrieved from the ruins of the Mifan Sect. It was well-known throughout their sect. Now that Li Encheng had passed, this young man was likely his descendant.

He’s... willing to help me? thought Li Xizhi.

He had taken every detour through the mountains and planned for every possibility to preserve his life. But he had never expected that rescue would come from someone of Fuchen Peak. But though he was stunned, he didn’t slow his hands. The pill’s energy surged through him, and he launched a Heavenly Glow spell art skyward.

Tuoba Chongyuan scanned the newcomer with his spiritual sense. Li Quantao was merely at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He wasn’t worth notice, much just like Yu Yuwei’s two disciples. So Tuoba Chongyuan launched an attack with a casual wave of his sleeve.

But Li Quantao was the son of a great alchemy master; he was gifted and well-resourced. More importantly, he wielded the ancient dharma artifact, the Water Wall Pearl. When he unleashed his mana, streams of gray-white water of the Water Mansion burst forth, merging with the surrounding wind.

Water Mansion Dao were rare even in the southern Jiangnan region, let alone in the north. Tuoba Chongyuan suddenly felt the spiritual winds beside him turn wild and unruly beneath his feet. He had to halt mid-air to stabilize himself.

“Water Mansion...” muttered Tuoba Chongyuan.

Tuoba Chongyuan’s expression shifted at once, and his eyes showed interest. He stared at the glimmering pearl, and a look of realization crossed his face.

He still had the leisure to comment, “Hearing about it doesn’t compare to seeing it! Our Emperor Wu of Great Liang founded the nation after slaying dragons and phoenixes, obtaining both the Converging Water and Inferior Water pearls. The one in your hand must be a replica from an ancient cultivator.”

The glow around him dimmed slightly. He didn’t need a weapon; he simply cast a spell that made the Water Wall Pearl tremble violently. Li Xizhi and Li Quantao joined forces to barely block the blow, but Tuoba Chongyuan was pressing hard. After ten or so exchanges, Li Quantao’s face was beginning to pale.

Li Xizhi was in dire condition; he should’ve escaped while he could. But if he broke away now, it wasn’t clear whether he could even make it out, and the youth who’d come to save him would likely die in his place.

So he gritted his teeth and stayed, defending alongside the youth. He coordinated quickly with Li Quantao with his spiritual sense.

The young man responded, “Peak Master, I am Li Quantao of Fuchen Peak! This man is too fierce. Yuan Huyuan wouldn’t open the formation, but some of our kin are not far from here. We should fight and retreat. We need to head south!”

Li Xizhi immediately understood. He focused on calming his breath while Li Quantao took the lead. His mana boiled over, and his Dao foundation manifested as he bought time with reckless abandon.

Though Li Quantao's cultivation was comparatively weak, his dharma artifact was formidable. The white water barrier deflected spell arts while he fought to stall Tuoba Chongyuan. The latter had just come out of a battle and was still without his weapon. Thus, Li Quantao managed to hold his ground for several exchanges.

But Li Quantao’s complexion had already begun to pale after just a dozen exchanges. The blessing of the great seal allowed Tuoba Chongyuan’s every move to strike like a dharma artifact. Had he not lost his favored weapon, Li Quantao would have long since been knocked from the sky.

Even with multiple peak masters from Baixiang Valley, things turned out like this... I can’t afford to underestimate him.

Li Quantao, though not powerful, had some battle experience. He quickly swallowed a pill, triggering a downpour of Water Mansion currents. Even while coughing up blood from a blow, he responded via spiritual sense to Li Xizhi, “Don’t worry, Peak Master! It’s just a seven minutes’ journey. I, Quantao, can hold out until then!”

Tuoba Chongyuan’s expression darkened. He had already spent far too long pursuing Li Xizhi, and had ventured too deep into enemy territory. Though he was still confident, he began to weigh whether the kill was truly worth it.

Tension surged between the three of them, until suddenly, a burst of light flared in the sky.

Boom!

The sky brightened abruptly. The spiritual aura of heaven and earth shifted violently, and the rise of several glowing halos caused the sky to hum in resonance. In the distance, a mountain quaked and shattered.

Li Xizhi squinted as the sky turned red. A massive arc of golden light flickered in the distance, followed by a piece of golden brilliance plummeting from the sky. Two crisp cracks rang out as a stretch of buildings materialized and dropped into the distant mountains.

Could it be a fluctuation in spiritual aura... causing something from a grotto heaven to fall into our realm?

In that split second, several thoughts flashed through Li Xizhi’s mind. He grabbed Li Quantao and the two of them activated Blood Escape Technique, launching into the sky under the crimson heavens as they fled south.

But Tuoba Chongyuan didn’t follow. Instead, the devil cultivator stopped where he was. He shut his eyes and cast a spell. Li Quantao had barely survived that last bout thanks to his dharma artifact, so he watched with growing dread.

Sure enough, only a few kilometers into their escape, six beams of white light chased after them. Unlike the previous pale-white hue, these were much thicker. The lights were tinged faintly with yellow. Alarmed, Li Quantao pulled out a talisman.

Li Xizhi also activated several talismans, raising the Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron in his hand to dispel the spell arts. Li Quantao summoned the Water Wall Pearl again and smashed it directly toward the incoming beams without hesitating.
𝒻𝑟𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝑛𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝘤𝘰𝘮

Boom!

The white light clashed with the dharma artifact and instantly shattered into tens of thousands of blade-like fragments. Li Xizhi’s mana shields lasted only two seconds before the blades landed on his feathered robe.

Golden light burst from the robe once again and dissolved the remaining blades. In the end, he only coughed up a mouthful of blood. The robe, which was a gift from his wife, had saved his life yet again. Li Xizhi quickly took a pill and looked to the youth beside him.

Li Quantao had taken a full face of blade fragments. A talisman had shielded his head, but he still coughed twice and reached into the air to catch his severed arm and leg. He hastily reattached them.

The Water Mansion Dao foundation body had strange properties. Unlike typical Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, such injuries were not fatal. He recalled the Water Wall Pearl and rode the blood wind once more.

Despite everything, his tone remained warm as he said, “The Water Wall Pearl’s core is incredibly tough, it can even withstand attacks from a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. No need to worry.”

Tuoba Chongyuan had vanished from view. Li Xizhi exhaled deeply. Finally, he had the space to think of something else, There’s still the Sun Seeker Ring back home, which is just as sturdy and unpredictable. But it’s tied to Green Pine Temple. I’ve never dared to use it...

As he and Li Quantao passed another checkpoint, the grand formation still shimmered brightly, clearly refusing to let them enter. The young man’s face darkened, but he said nothing more, simply stating, “Peak Master, follow me. My elder brother oversees a formation not far from here. We can enter there.”

Li Xizhi scanned the surroundings, Tuoba Chongyuan was still nowhere in sight. But neither of them dared to relax. They continued to flee on their blood light until they reached a green mountain in under seven minutes.

Li Quantao clearly held more authority here than at Chengdu Pass. He didn’t even report as he waved his command token and brought Li Xizhi inside. The area beyond the formation was a mess, filled with the rubble of the many collapsed buildings.

Yet, despite the disarray, the morale remained stable. Li Quantao asked around briefly, then turned back and said, “Peak Master... my elder brother has gone to provide support and hasn’t returned yet. This place is still relatively safe. Please rest and recover without worry.”

Li Xizhi finally allowed himself to relax. Pain surged through every bone and limb, while head spun and vision blurred. He forced himself to stay upright and said, “No need for such courtesy. Thank you, brother... Some debts are too great for words.”

“Hey, don’t mention it.” Li Quantao was not in much better shape himself. His internal injuries were far more severe. He wasn’t some reckless youth acting on passion. He had agreed to intercept and aid Li Xizhi out of gratitude, and partly because he thought his brother was stationed here.

But he had underestimated Tuoba Chongyuan in every regard. In the end, the wounds he suffered were far worse than expected. Now, realizing his brother wasn’t even in the formation made him break out in a cold sweat, he thought, Thank the heavens that devil didn’t keep chasing... If he had pressed on and my brother wasn’t here, both of us, and the entire formation’s cultivators, would’ve been buried together!

After fleeing and fighting for so long, both men were thoroughly exhausted in both body and spirit alike. Whatever needed doing could wait until they had healed. Each found a cave dwelling and began silent recovery.

Li Xizhi sat cross-legged and carefully calculated. His feathered robe had sustained damage again, its lifespan reduced by a decade or so, but it had saved his life.

Fortunately, I had the Autumn Convergence Pill... Fortunately... that favor was repaid.

————

I’ve missed the appointed time.

Tuoba Chongyuan furrowed his brows, but his hands didn’t slow. He had sent six beams of white light after the fleeing blood escape, yet he decisively abandoned the two and turned back in haste, flying swiftly in the direction from which he had come.

Breaking through the formation had always been his main goal, while chasing the man in the feathered robe was merely a convenient aside. If he couldn’t catch him, so be it. It was only a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. But if he delayed family matters... that would be a real problem.

He flew over five kilometers before his celestial chariot rolled through white mist to catch up. Gone was Tuoba Chongyuan’s earlier ease, he poured mana into the chariot and sped back with urgency.

After a moment of spellcasting and calculation, he followed the spell art and descended into a forest. There, buried in a mossy green boulder, stood his spear, its dharma light glimmering faintly.

Since the dharma artifact had been sealed by Li Xizhi, he couldn’t summon it directly and had to retrieve it himself. He landed carelessly before the stone and gave it a tug, but it didn’t budge.

"Hm?"

He felt a sudden jolt and whipped around. A youth, dressed in a Daoist robe patterned with cloud motifs and with neatly combed hair, emerged from within the tangled red-tinted mist.

The young man greeted him politely, "Fellow Daoist, that spear happens to be mine."

Tuoba Chongyuan was already in a foul mood, and an angry laugh slipped out of him. He was eager to return and in no mood for distractions.

As he slowly exerted more force on the spear, he replied coldly, "Bold of you!"

Just as he was about to speak harsher words, he paused. The spear remained firmly embedded in the stone, unmoved despite his strength. His expression darkened further.

The youth gave a slight bow as he calmly studied him. He smiled. "I came here under orders to take a share of the spoils. It was quite the coincidence when a spear fell from the heavens, landing right before me. I thought I had stumbled upon a fine dharma artifact for free...

"So it belongs to a young master of the Tuoba Family, no wonder you throw things around so generously!"

He nodded approvingly, looking quite pleased as he continued, "Your esteemed family hasn’t dared set foot in the Eastern Sea since the death of Tuoba Xuantan. It’s so rare to see one of you. I mean no disrespect, just that I intend to kill you."

Tuoba Chongyuan felt something off. He stared at the youth, whose identity had become increasingly clear. The youth quietly gripped a jade talisman in his hand. A swirl of yellow and white rose around his face as he gathered power.

"Dongfang Heyun, at your service, Young Master." The youth tidied his sleeves, cupped his hands in greeting, and grinned. "Young Master, why haven’t you run yet? Hurry along and go save your life!"




# Chapter 778: The One From Miao Family

Mount Qingdu.

Dawn had just risen from within the mountains, gradually flickering over the treetops. The jade-like path shimmered beautifully; it was often called the Azure Steps by the families around the lake. It was a metaphor for the path of ascension.

A young man quickly descended the steps, his bearing noble and composed. He wore a platinum-white Daoist robe with tightly fitted cuffs, giving him a clean and decisive appearance. Though he was bathed in golden morning light, his pupils were partially hidden in the shadow of his nose bridge and only glimmered faintly with gold.

A cold and stern black-robed youth followed closely behind robes. His voice was low and steady. “Your Highness, the new disciples from each family have all entered the estate...The numbers are down by twenty percent compared to last year.”

Li Zhouwei was just seventeen, and had focused solely on cultivating the perception technique art. When Li Xizhi and Li Ximing were his age, they had just reached the Qi Cultivation Realm, yet he had already reached the fifth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Li Zhouwei was undoubtedly the finest talent in the family in several generations.

Chen Yang too had outpaced his peers by a wide margin. Since he had only reached the Qi Cultivation Realm a few years ago, he was hailed as the most gifted outsider in a hundred years. Many within the family believed it was due to his half-direct bloodline from the main family. Though he was widely praised, it was seen as expected.

“Twenty percent.” The two strolled across the peak, both well aware of the reason behind the numbers. Li Zhouwei slowed to a stop with his hands clasped behind his back, golden flecks of light swirling within his pupils.

The glow no longer had the strange and eerie hue it once did. Now, it clearly radiated the brilliance of mana. The golden flecks came from the Grand Veined Golden Eyes that Li Xizhi had brought back years ago.

He had refined the Grand Veined Golden Eyes quite early. This Bright Yang perception technique art was no easy feat. Ancient cultivators of the Wei State’s Li Family once needed twenty years to master it, yet Li Zhouwei had done so with ease.

Chen Yang was extremely skilled in reading people and assessing situations. He cupped his hands and replied, “The war up north remains uncertain... These people are afraid. They're afraid that if they send their family's youths here, they'll be sent to the northern front in a few years...

“They’ve each kept one or two behind, sending the rest away under the pretext of training trips. Some were sent to the east, others to the west. This limited the intake to just twenty percent. Since the spiritual orifice talent pool fluctuates yearly, it's hard to argue against it.”

Li Zhouwei and Chen Yang reached the foot of the mountain, where the lake shimmered with golden light. Several cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm were navigating boats across the water, activating Water Dividing Techniques and diving beneath to mine minerals.

Li Zhouwei’s eyes were half-lidded as he asked, “How many are we short?”

Chen Yang replied respectfully, “Chen, Dou, Xu, Tian, and Lijing have all seen slight increases compared to last year. The four towns of Huaqian and the seven cities of Huayu have each decreased by ten percent. As for the eight towns of Wutu, many are from the region of Mount Yue, so their numbers remained steady. But the population in Milin has withered, dropping by a full twenty percent...

“The missing names on the registry fall under the Jade Court’s supervision. I dare not inquire.”

Li Zhouwei listened, his glowing pupils casting a glance over the water’s surface as he replied, “These families have been graced for many years and are considered loyal. Chen Yang, go verify the registry and personally question each household. Also, send a few family letters to the northern front.”

Chen Yang nodded in understanding. His tone was respectful, but a hint of a dark smile played at his lips. “Your Highness... Just once?”

Li Zhouwei waved his hand and said, “Just once, for now.”

Chen Yang took his leave, and Li Zhouwei stood by the lakeside for a moment, a hint of coldness flashing across his face.

Li Xijun had been gravely wounded in that great battle and had to enter seclusion to fan his spark of life. Li Ximing had been forced to emerge. He was now patrolling the lake on one end while still refining pills and tending to Li Xijun. As a result, household affairs had been left unattended.

He had grown old enough to temporarily take over matters on Mount Qingdu. The constant mobilization had forced them to not only send people north but also dispatch others to investigate various regions. Manpower was already stretched thin.

Investigating abroad was far more dangerous, mostly because of devil cultivators slipping into towns and devouring people. Taking this much risk for mere mortals hardly seemed worth it to the families. Li Zhouwei knew perfectly well that several houses under his rule were especially unwilling. However, he had no patience to negotiate.

“I’ve just taken over household affairs, and in times of upheaval, it’s best not to act too harshly... otherwise...” muttered Li Zhouwei.

So he sent Chen Yang. On the surface, it was a simple inquiry, but in truth, it was a warning. Chen Yang’s fierce and ruthless nature made him the perfect candidate for such a task.

Li Zhouwei rode the wind upward toward the mountaintop. At the summit, he saw a stone platform, flowing with brilliance and etched with intricate patterns.

A dark golden halberd was planted at its center. Its long shaft curved like a crescent moon, with a luminous white arc etched in the middle. It was shrouded in mysterious and exquisite spiritual energy as it silently radiated brilliant light that rendered the surrounding vegetation lifeless and pale.

Beside it lay a circular dharma artifact. It was a golden-red ring, about the width of a pinky, made of neither gold nor silver.

“Two ancient dharma artifacts...” said Li Zhouwei in a low voice.

Both were ancient artifacts. The halberd, in particular, came from a grotto heaven and radiated pure brilliance. Together, their value might not surpass the entire Li Family, but they were certainly worth as much as all of the family’s Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts combined.

In the current Li Family, not even Li Ximing had a proper dharma artifact. Li Xizhi still used a Qi Cultivation Realm sword, yet they had prepared such precious artifacts for him.

“Now that I’ve broken through to the fifth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, I can finally lay hands on these ancient dharma artifacts!” said Li Zhouwei.

Li Zhouwei stepped forward, passing through the formation that veiled the stone platform. Dazzling light flared before his eyes. The halberd had been sealed for ten years, and the formation surged with Bright Yang energy. Without the protection of the formation, the platform itself would have turned to white sand.

Li Ximing had once tried using this artifact. Even though he possessed a Bright Yang Dao foundation, the halberd had only glowed faintly in his hands. It emitted a few bursts of brilliance and nothing more.

He merely lifted the artifact, then returned to pill refinement, never bothering to refine or claim it. Even now, no one knew its name.

Li Zhouwei slowly approached the great halberd. Its blade had begun to hum and tremble with white light. Slowly, two ancient characters emerged along the halberd's shaft.

Da Sheng.

He gently gripped the long handle, and the halberd shivered as it started to greedily devour his mana. The golden light in Li Zhouwei’s pupils overlapped and intensified as he slowly began to draw it forth.

Buzz... buzz... buzz...

The halberd rejoiced as he refined it. A burst of golden light shot from the arc at its center, landing on him and transforming into the image of a Vast Sky Bright Yang.

The golden light vanished in an instant. As Li Zhouwei pulled the halberd free, a sudden clarity dawned in his heart, Da Sheng Halberd.

The halberd did not emanate much killing intent. It had been forged long ago and placed within a grotto heaven by members of Green Pine Temple. It had rarely tasted blood, and had instead been nurtured by the unified spiritual qi of that world.

He couldn’t calculate exactly how long it had been, but it had likely rested there for over five hundred years. Thus, it was brimming with spiritual energy and teeming with vitality. Yet, it was devoid of bloodlust.

Li Zhouwei gave it a thorough inspection. The halberd’s sturdiness and sharpness needed no further mention. After all, it had been forged in ancient times and nourished for centuries. It was far more powerful than modern dharma artifacts.

Once mana was infused into it, the halberd released invisible white light. Enemies struck by it would feel as though they were under a scorching sun. They would feel restless and would be drenched in sweat.

Within the halberd’s central arc lay further mystery. There was a hidden brilliance that, when activated by a Bright Yang Immortal Foundation, could bestow its wielder with radiant power. The user would be cloaked in divine light, and be able to walk upon brightness. The wielder could seize flame and radiate fearsome majesty.

Li Zhouwei was instantly satisfied. Though he had yet to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm and could not use it to its full potential, this ancient dharma artifact felt extremely compatible with him. It was as if it breathed alongside him.

A fine dharma artifact indeed!

He slung the halberd across his back and glanced at the golden-red Sun Seeker Ring nearby. Though this dharma artifact had no distinguishing features beyond its toughness, he couldn’t take his eyes off it.

So familiar...

Li Zhouwei stared at it for a few seconds, tempted to take it with him. Unfortunately, he’d heard this dharma artifact was an important relic of Green Pine Temple and could not be taken lightly.

He exited the grand formation and arrived at the foot of the mountain, where he suddenly saw An Siwei descending rapidly on the wind.

The middle-aged man spoke gravely, “Reporting to Your Highness, a man has arrived outside the formation. He claims to be from the Miao Family of Thunder Island in the Southern Sea. He wishes to visit Qingdu...”

“A member of the Miao Family?” Li Zhouwei’s expression darkened slightly as he said coldly, “Our elders are still patrolling the lake. Send up a signal flame. As for the Miao Family representative, let him wait at the pavilion below the mountain.”

The matter of Li Qinghong had long been discussed within the family. There was a high chance the Miao Family had come with ill intent. Their timing was precise, striking just as the Li Family’s presence had thinned and Li Xijun was gravely wounded. It was a truly perilous situation...

“I wonder if it’s Miao Quan... I’ve heard the man is quite formidable. If he were to suddenly act out, it could indeed become troublesome.” Li Zhouwei folded his arms and asked, “Was he willing to enter the formation and speak in detail?”

“I asked... Although he looked uncomfortable, he eventually nodded in agreement,” replied An Siwei.

When he heard that the man was willing to enter the formation, Li Zhouwei had a clear idea in mind, Either he doesn’t harbor much ill will... or he has no real grasp of our strength. He’s just relying on the backing of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. But once inside the Foundation Establishment Realm formation, with a late-stage Establishment Realm cultivator operating it, he’ll be walking straight into danger...

Since the Miao Family had shown a willingness to talk, the Li Family naturally preferred fewer enemies over more.

Li Zhouwei responded with a touch of courtesy and instructed, “Serve him tea.”

He immediately started to calculate deeply. His father, Li Chengliao, arrived within the formation as well.

When he heard how polite the Miao Family representative was, he frowned, and Li Zhouwei said gravely, “It’s probably because the reputation of Bianyan’s Immortal Bow frightened them. The incident where Murong Wu was killed within fifteen minutes.”

The father and son discussed the matter in detail and soon devised a response. Li Zhouwei spoke softly, “Father, please take your position and stand guard. I’ll wait for uncle.”

Li Chengliao nodded calmly and left. Lights flickered outside the formation, indicating that Li Ximing had not been far away. He soon arrived, riding the wind.

Li Ximing, clad in a golden Daoist robe, had searched around the lake but found nothing of note. He had only slain a few devil cultivators. Most of the day had passed, and he was feeling rather frustrated.

He grumbled, “What a bothersome task... I have to keep checking for any traces of Foundation Establishment Realm activity. Eighth Brother really has patience, to spend half a year on something like this.”

Li Xijun was seriously injured, so Li Ximing would have to take charge himself for the moment. He didn’t mind, but as he counted the days, the secret techniques he was waiting on still seemed far off. This was giving him a headache.

“The Purple Mansion Realm... how incredibly difficult it is to attain!”

When he returned to the mountain and saw Li Zhouwei, he was momentarily stunned by the youth’s fifth stage Qi Cultivation Realm strength. Li Zhouwei spoke first, giving a brief summary of the situation.

“Let him come up, then...” said Li Ximing.

When he heard that the visitor was from the Miao Family, Li Ximing’s head only ached even more. Still, he had no choice but to shoulder the responsibility. So he maintained his calm composure.

Li Zhouwei understood his uncle’s temperament. He summoned Li Chengliao and Li Xuanxuan on his behalf, preserving the elder’s dignity as he gently added, “Father has already received the news and is waiting in the hall. Uncle only needs to be present; there’s no need to say much.”

Li Ximing blinked at him in surprise, then understood and grinned. “Good!”

Li Zhouwei infused mana into the Da Sheng Halberd, causing the dharma artifact to shine brilliantly. The central arc glowed with a dazzling radiance.
𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝘦𝘣𝘯ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝑚

He handed the artifact over and said in a grave tone, “The Miao Family hails from the Southern Sea, where devil cultivators are most numerous. Such people often fear power but not virtue. The renown of the Immortal Bow of Mount Bianyan carries great deterrence, so surely, there’s some hesitation in their hearts. Uncle, place the halberd by your side and observe coldly.”

Li Ximing’s eyes lit up and he nodded. “That, I can certainly manage.”

He rode the wind upward and descended into the main hall, taking his seat at the head. The Miao Family representative entered the hall shortly after.

This Miao Family member had a square face, thick brows, a burly frame, and wore strange clothes. It was neither truly Daoist nor monk-like. Two large bronze bowls were tied at his waist. However, his manner was polite.

“I am Miao Ye of Thunder Island! Greetings, fellow Daoist!”

Miao Ye, too, cultivated the Thunder Dao, so his voice boomed like rolling thunder. Li Ximing leaned slightly in his golden robe. The crescent-shaped Da Sheng Halberd stood tall beside him.

He looked down and said, “I am Li Ximing. Greetings, fellow Daoist.”

Whatever else one could say, Li Ximing had a commanding presence. His cultivation was deep, and one hand rested on the armrest as the teachings of his father, Li Yuanping, seemed to come alive from memory. His bearing had become vividly refined.

Miao Ye’s eyes landed on the Da Sheng Halberd, and its familiar form nearly made him leap up. His heart dropped, thundering like a storm, and he thought to himself, So it was him! It was Li Xuanfeng in the Grotto Heaven! He killed Yu Muxian... and seized this halberd from Tang Shedu!

Miao Ye had once entered the Green Pine Grotto Heaven and chanced upon this very halberd. He had fought bitterly with Situ Chen of the Golden Tang Gate for it, only to run into Tang Shedu.

He had nearly lost his life fleeing in panic from Tang Shedu. He had only survived because a group arrived and inadvertently saved him.

They said Li Xuanfeng had joined the Ning Family... but this weapon is clearly in the hands of the Li Family! Of course, it’s still Li. Hard to draw the line between them!

Miao Ye had long wondered which family Li Xuanfeng truly belonged to. Now, clarity dawned. He looked at Li Ximing with new eyes. He could see streams of radiant light flowing from the man. His Immortal Foundation was no ordinary one. His aura was dense and powerful. This was clearly a veteran at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Though he had never heard of Li Ximing before, the man’s strength was clearly formidable. Weighing the situation, Miao Ye lowered his voice and smiled. “I’ve long heard of your renown, Daoist. I once met Senior Xuanfeng in the secret realm and he saved my life. I’ve always felt immense gratitude toward your esteemed family... It is truly an honor to meet you today.”

“Oh?” Li Ximing’s face showed a flicker of interest as he asked, “I’d like to hear the details.”

Miao Ye recounted the story carefully, beginning with his encounter with Situ Chen. He mentioned the Golden Tang Gate twice, only for the expression of the elderly man nearby to instantly darken. He was clearly displeased by the name.

Li Xuanxuan had personally endured a Golden Tang Gate ambush and had never forgotten it. Li Ximing knew this well and coldly added, “So it was the Golden Tang Gate... Worry not, fellow Daoist. Situ Chen is dead, he perished in the Eastern Sea.”

At first, Miao Ye didn’t think much of it. But when he repeated the story a few more times, a chill suddenly crept through his heart, The Li Family and the Golden Tang Gate are clearly hostile towards each other. There’s been no word of Situ Chen ever since the grotto heaven incident... Fallen in the Eastern Sea... Could it be... he was killed by Li Xuanfeng too?




# Chapter 780: True Essence

Thoughts raced through his mind like lightning. Since no one from the Li Family had spoken, Miao Ye had no choice but to continue and said quietly, “I came this time to resolve a certain misunderstanding...

“My family uncle... encountered a fairy from your esteemed family in the Eastern Sea and, upon suddenly seeing a senior’s dharma artifact, became overwhelmed with emotion.

“He’s reckless by nature and when he saw the spear, he couldn’t restrain himself. I heard he had a dispute with one of your seniors... I came precisely because of this.”

Though Miao Ye looked rough, his words showed a shrewd mind. His phrasing was tactful, but the Li Family wasn’t so easily misled. Everyone knew whether Miao Quan had acted on impulse when he encountered Li Qinghong in the Eastern Sea or had ulterior motives. Li Ximing showed no reaction, and both Li Xuanxuan and Li Chengliao’s expressions only had the thinnest veneer of politeness.

Miao Ye let out a quiet sigh and said solemnly, “My family uncle was cut down by the head of the Shen Family and nearly lost even his demonic core. He has already paid the price. May your esteemed family take some satisfaction from his miserable end, and perhaps not pursue the matter further...”

Li Ximing stared at him silently and only spoke after Miao Ye had finished, “These words are better said to my aunt. Surely, fellow Daoist, you didn’t come all this way just to apologize. Speak your true purpose.”

Miao Ye could only lower his head and reply, “To speak frankly, the spear known as Duruo once belonged to our Thunder Island... Long ago, one of our elders left to train in the mainland and ended up with enmity against Azure Pond Sect and Golden Feather Sect.

“This grudge... was rather convoluted. The Golden Feather Sect accused our elder of stealing cultivation techniques, while Azure Pond Sect claimed he harbored remnants of the Lingyu Gate and helped a direct descendant of the Chen Family escape...”

Miao Ye smiled awkwardly. “Heaven bears witness that our Miao Family has practiced thunder arts for generations. At most, we know a few spells for summoning and directing lightning... Though some later called it demonic, who among us uses blood arts or shamanic spell arts? Let alone any high-level thievery! Surely someone was stirring trouble behind the scenes!”

Uncertain of the Li Family’s stance toward Azure Pond Sect and Golden Feather Sect, Miao Ye chose his words carefully. Though he was polite on the surface, his implication was clear. They had falsely accused and persecuted his family.

The smiling man didn’t dare speak harshly before the Li Family, but he had undoubtedly cursed both sects behind closed doors.

For now, he simply said, “I came here today to ask about the origin of that spear. I hope your esteemed family might be willing to share some information... If it came from somewhere else, was my elder’s body perhaps found with it?”

Li Chengliao snorted noncommittally and quietly asked Li Xuanxuan beside him, “This matter goes far back... Elder, do you recall anything?”

Miao Ye immediately grew nervous as he looked at the elderly man. Yet he found it reasonable and thought, That’s right, only by asking these senior elders of the family can I hope to learn anything.

Li Xuanxuan naturally refused to speak first. Instead, he first asked, “I wonder what Immortal Foundation your elder possessed, and what protective treasures he carried? I may have some memory of this. If you could share a few details, perhaps I might recall more.”

Miao Ye quickly nodded. “My elder’s name was Miao Dushan, a man of extraordinary talent. He merged thunder arts with devil techniques through his own efforts and established the current Dao lineage of Thunder Island. He likely carried several precious devil techniques, and his mount was a creature called the Kanxiu Python. It was large in size and skilled in manipulating water currents.

“He also had a spirit artifact called the Heavenly Crimson Pearl, blood-red in color... it should be no larger than a palm. The records of it have long been lost. I can no longer recall its exact form.”

Though the speaker had no special intent, the listener paid close attention. Li Xuanxuan, who had witnessed the events himself, grew alert. He clearly remembered that the Duruo Spear had been found in a snake demon’s cave.

That very demon cave lay beneath their feet and was connected to Mount Qingdu. It was precisely where the Qingdu Cave Dwelling now stood!

Back then, we acquired several items, two manuals, one spear, and a single pearl... The Blood Dharma Manual was claimed by Zhang Yun of Golden Feather Sect, while the River Mountain Sutra still rests unread in the treasure vault. As for the blood-red pearl... it was found on the snake demon’s remains. Zhang Yun claimed it was a demon core and left with two items.

Li Xuanxuan’s pupils widened, and his mind roared like thunder, It wasn’t a demon core! How could it possibly be a demon core?!

Waves of shock surged through his heart. The truth he’d suddenly uncovered left a bitter taste. He had heard the account directly from Li Tongya, and even remembered the exact conversation between them.

“Zhang Yun and my uncle each chose one item. Zhang Yun, being slightly stronger, picked the ‘demon core’ first...”

At the time, the Li Family had barely owned any dharma artifacts. Li Tongya was merely a novice cultivator then, with a battered artifact of his own. How could he have recognized the worth of a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact?

A demon core from a Foundation Establishment Realm creature... How could that possibly compare to the Duruo Spear?!

Later, as the Li Family acquired more Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts and saw Li Wushao’s demon core, they knew it merely emitted a cold aura. It was never on par with a real dharma artifact. The family often explained its uniqueness as the result of a failed Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough. But after hearing Miao Ye’s words, how could Li Xuanxuan not understand now?

Of course... No wonder Zhang Yun was so composed. He quietly walked away with a Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact! The things in that cave weren’t left by a snake demon at all, they were remnants of Miao Dushan, guarded by the Kanxiu Python!

Even the claim that Zhang Yun had come to retrieve the Blood Dharma Manual, it likely wasn’t Golden Feather Sect’s at all! It was Miao Dushan’s personal manual! He took the most valuable item and left behind the Duruo Spear, which clearly pointed to their identity. Of course the Miao Family would eventually come looking for answers...

If not for Qinghong’s overwhelming strength and fortunate timing in encountering Miao Quan, she likely would’ve been attacked outright. Her life would’ve been in danger. And once a grudge like that took root, who would care about right or wrong anymore?

If we had clashed with the Miao Family’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... there wouldn’t even be a chance to speak...

A fleeting thought flashed through his mind, and he couldn’t help but feel a heavy gloom settle over his heart, Zhang Yun wasn’t even the foremost among Golden Feather Sect’s younger generation back then, nor was he yet one of the cultivators closest to Purple Mansion Realm. But his methods were already clear to see... He surpassed Chi Zhiyun by a good margin.

As Li Xuanxuan’s thoughts circled, he noticed Miao Ye still staring blankly at him.

Li Xuanxuan hesitated, then asked first, “Has your esteemed family come for the Duruo Spear?”

Miao Ye hesitated for a moment before answering, “Not exactly... We’ve searched for our elder for centuries. Our first wish is to retrieve his body and spirit shell to return them to the island. Second, we hope to find the whereabouts of the Heavenly Crimson Pearl. As for the devil techniques and dharma artifacts, those are merely a regretful loss.”

After all, it’s a Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact. No family would easily give that up...
𝐟𝐫𝕖𝗲𝘄𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝕧𝐞𝚕.𝕔𝕠𝐦

Li Xuanxuan fell silent for a while, unsure how to respond. He could only say quietly, “Fellow Daoist, I cannot say.”

Miao Ye didn’t seem surprised. His eyes stayed fixed on the elder as he spoke quietly, “I understand your meaning, elder, but I cannot report back to my family without some cause or context. They will inevitably grow suspicious of your esteemed family.”

Fearing that Li Ximing might erupt in anger from his seat above, he deliberately emphasized urgently, “A Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact! Our Daoist patriarch greatly values it. Were it not for the North-South conflict, the other families’ watchfulness, and poor timing, the old master would have come in person long ago!”

Li Ximing’s eyes narrowed. Sensing the tension, Li Xuanxuan hurried to interject wearily, “Are you familiar with our family’s Celestial Moon Sword, fellow Daoist?”

Miao Ye nodded. “I’ve heard of it, slightly.”

“Duruo was won in a wager by one of our elders in the Qi Cultivation Realm... As for the rest, our family dared not lay hands on them.”

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard gravely. “If you do not believe me, I have no proof to offer... Duruo is currently in the hands of Qinghong. She is in the north, on assignment to exterminate demons... so naturally, we cannot hand it over to your esteemed family.”

Miao Ye fell silent for a moment before replying softly, “I understand. I cannot give my family a full answer for now. Let me investigate further. In time, I will surely return with worthy gifts to exchange for Duruo.”

The Li Family members all responded politely. Miao Ye’s expression was heavy as he backed away.

Then he suddenly asked, “This concerns a blood feud of a hundred years. My family has lived in doubt and suspicion for far too long. I ask sincerely, after leaving Moongaze Lake, should I cross Mount Xiping and head west, or descend through the Mushroom Forest and go south?”

Li Xuanxuan fell silent for a breath, then finally sighed. “The desert scenery to the west is quite beautiful.”

Miao Ye thanked them twice before riding the wind into the sky. Li Ximing, who had been sitting upright, leaned back slightly. The atmosphere among them grew heavy.

Li Xuanxuan said quietly, “If this matter isn’t handled well, we’ll have offended Thunder Island again... The grudge was already formed the moment we obtained Duruo.”

Li Chengliao was just about to speak, when he suddenly looked up, sensing something.

Li Ximing’s eyes lit up at once. “This!”

Outside the hall, a surge of blue-green light rippled and wove into several serpent- and flood-dragon-like strands in the sky. It intertwined with rising golden-green spiritual energy across the heavens in a brilliant display.

After a brief moment, everyone stepped out of the hall. Sparkling strands of clear energy began to descend from the sky, spinning as they fell. When they touched the lake’s surface, they bounced like spirits, each trailing a white flame as they leaped one and a half meter into the air, only to fall again. Clear light danced and shimmered all across the water’s surface.

“Someone has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm...” Li Ximing looked up in surprise at the celestial phenomenon. For a moment, he couldn’t tell what type of Immortal Foundation had formed. After a moment of scrutiny, he murmured thoughtfully, “Not one of the Five Virtues, not Yin-Yang, nor the Ancient Types. It must be one of the Twelve Essences.”

No sooner had he spoken than a beam of pure light rose from the lake, followed by a leaping ape.

The ape had white fur and gray eyes, and its gaze was ancient and sharp. Its muscular and agile body shimmered with flowing light. It was the size of a grand hall, and its fists as large as tables. Its back and belly were covered in dense white hair, and two white auras coiled around its wrists. The beast radiated an imposing presence.

As soon as it leapt from the water, it rapidly transformed, donning a white battle robe and taking the form of a three-meter-tall elderly man.

He landed before them. His voice was rough and deep, like stones grinding together, “This old ape greets the honored sirs.”

The White Ape!

Li Xuanxuan was stunned for two full breaths before he reacted. The elderly man before him had a simple, honest face, with eyes deep-set with age and tightly pressed lips. He was even taller than the towering Li Ximing.

He’s formed an Immortal Foundation! Li Xuanxuan truly hadn’t expected it. The White Ape was, after all, merely a spirit beast from a minor sect. Years ago, he had been wandering, wounded and scarred, before he had been rescued by Li Xuanxuan during the devil plague. Back then, his body had been riddled with fire poison, and not a single patch of fur had remained intact.

Back then, he didn’t look like he would even survive to the natural end of an ordinary demonic creature’s lifespan, let alone reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. When the White Ape entered closed-door cultivation a few years ago, his chances of success were even lower than those of Li Xicheng back in the day. Li Xuanxuan had truly been prepared for the worst.

Now, when he saw the old ape transformed into human form, silently standing before him, Li Xuanxuan felt a surge of emotion.

The elder simply took his hand and asked, “Old ape... it's enough that you’re still alive... Foundation Establishment Realm demonic creatures live even longer.”

The White Ape, as always, disliked speaking. He bowed deeply to the three of them and rasped, “This old servant, by bloodline inheritance, has cultivated the Immortal Foundation Stone Embrace Slumber, True Essence of the Twelve Essences.”

His voice was deep and hoarse, but it was steady and weighty. He fell silent again, but Li Ximing followed up with a question, “This is my first time encountering it. What are the effects of this Immortal Foundation?”

“Stone Embrace Slumber grants extended vitality, and restores flesh and bone to their truest form. The body merges with True Essence, pierces illusion, and gains insight into hearts. The longer one lives, the stronger the foundation becomes,” replied the White Ape.

Li Ximing grew intrigued and couldn’t help but ask, “How old are you now? And how many years of lifespan remain?”

“I spent two hundred and eleven years in the mortal stage, sixty-five years in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and one hundred seventy-seven years in the Qi Cultivation Realm. I am now four hundred and fifty-three years old.” The old ape’s voice was like a stone dropping into an empty valley. “My species is naturally long-lived. Now that I’ve cultivated this Immortal Foundation, by rough estimate, I still have over four hundred years remaining.”

A look of envy crossed Li Ximing’s face. Glancing at the others beside him, he sighed, “That’s nearly three times the lifespan we have...”
𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

But his expression quickly brightened. He took a jade token from his robes and handed it joyfully to the White Ape. “Now that you’ve reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, the task of patrolling the lake falls to you! If anything happens, crush the jade token immediately. I’ll come out of seclusion to help.”

Li Ximing looked as if a great burden had been lifted from his shoulders. Li Xuanxuan chuckled as he pulled the White Ape closer, studying him with satisfaction before laughing hoarsely, “Old friend... you’re truly blessed by fortune!”

Seeing the weight in his gaze, the White Ape nourished Li Xuanxuan’s aged body with his own clear qi and spoke gently, “This old servant pounded medicine for three hundred years, witnessed many calamities, and survived mostly through helpless luck. Now that I’ve finally achieved the Dao... it’s hard to say whether it’s a blessing or curse.”

————

Mount Bianyan.

In contrast to the brightness and joy within Mount Qingdu’s great hall, Mount Bianyan was shrouded in gloom. Heavy clouds drifted across the mountain, and cultivators crept through its shadowy ridges.

Silence reigned in the central-left great hall. Two lines of cultivators stood inside the vast ceremonial chamber, while the white tiles at the center lay empty. All present kept their heads down, not daring to speak.

The oppressive atmosphere stretched on. Beads of sweat dotted Ning Heyuan’s forehead. He glanced across the hall at his brother-in-law, Li Xuanfeng, who had just emerged from seclusion. The elder’s expression was calm, and there was no visible sign of injury. Yet he emanated an overwhelming pressure simply by standing there.

I don’t know if he’s aware yet... damn it... why did Tuoba Chongyuan come in person?! It’s clearly not time yet... What are the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators thinking...Baixiang Valley...

At the head of the hall, Chi Zhiyan remained silent. At last, Ning Heyuan couldn’t endure the silence any longer and spoke, “Reporting, my lord... The second young master of the Tuoba Family, Tuoba Chongyuan... personally led an assault on Baixiang Valley...”

As soon as he finished speaking, the elder across the hall slowly raised his head. Though his face did not look fierce, his eyes were like two arrows of dark light, piercing through the hall and silencing everyone within.




# Chapter 782: Heavenly Gilded Helm

Li Xuanfeng had recently been summoned and rewarded personally by the Purple Mansion Realm elders of Azure Pond Sect and Golden Feather Sect. He had been encouraged to continue striving. Everyone knew that Baixiang Valley had been under the protection of his juniors, so no one was willing to speak up first.

On the other side, the man known as the Long Sky Halberd, Tang Shedu, had no intention of stepping forward now, even though he was usually happy to stir up a bit of commotion and nursed past grievances with Li Xuanfeng. He didn’t believe himself to be weaker either. He tilted his head to glance at Yu Su, the Brocade Dark Mouse, beside him.

Ning Heyuan simply continued, "Baixiang Valley has fallen. The surrounding regions, like Qun Yuan Mountain and Nu Mountain, have been thoroughly plundered. A large number of devil cultivators have moved southward, flooding the wilderness up to Lake Xian and further south into Xiao Family territory in Lixia Prefecture, as well as the areas around Mount Yu and Yuyuan.

"The defenders of Baixiang Valley failed to hold their ground and suffered heavy losses. Li Xizhi of Changtian Peak fled to Chengdu Mountain. Yu Yuwei of Panqi Peak escaped to Lake Xian. Quan Yi of Linghe Peak was killed by Tuoba Chongyuan. His body was destroyed and Dao extinguished. None of the remaining cultivators survived."

After he finished reading the message, the crowd began murmuring among themselves.

Li Xuanfeng showed no sign of anger as he suddenly spoke, "Lake Xian is quite far... Baixiang Valley is over five hundred kilometers from Chengdu Mountain, with several intact formations along the way. Why did they only manage to escape once they reached such a distant place?"

Ning Heyuan understood that his brother-in-law was asking a rhetorical question. Tang Shedu let out a cold laugh and was about to interject, but Ning Heyuan quickly answered first, "The two peak masters passed through many checkpoints, but the cultivators stationed there feared Tuoba Chongyuan's power and dared not go out to receive them..."

Li Xuanfeng nodded and said in a deep voice, "Those who lost Baixiang Valley must be punished... but unfortunately, the casualties are too severe. There’s hardly anyone left to be held accountable.

"The two peak masters are among the elites of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. It's remarkable they survived the pursuit of the devil cultivators. The others who couldn’t enter the defensive formations perished along the way."

Li Xuanfeng's words caused mixed expressions among the cultivators. Chi Zhiyan grew increasingly troubled; he could clearly hear the implication.

Seeing the hesitation in others, he tried to subtly reassure them, "What Xuanfeng says is true... the guards at the checkpoints must also be punished. But the immediate priority is to send people to Baixiang Valley to rebuild the great formation."

He made no mention of the fallen ruins near Baixiang Valley. Those had likely already been divided within the great void. The Azure Pond Sect had just lost a major conflict and their share had been significantly reduced. It was barely enough to supply the Chi Family, let alone be distributed to others.

As soon as those words fell, Tang Shedu and the others, who had been watching coldly, grew restless. They were all cultivators who were over a hundred years old, and they could all vaguely sense the shifting tides of this grand game.

Given the current situation, it was clear that none of them would get a share of the ruins near Baixiang Valley. Going there would only mean offending the Tuoba Family for nothing. Who could say how many tricks Tuoba Chongyuan still had up his sleeve? Was this worth risking one’s life?

Li Xuanfeng had yet to recover from his injuries, so chances were high that someone among these veteran cultivators would be selected. Tang Shedu was the most well-known among them. Not only had he forged his reputation over many years, but he had also been personally trained by Yuanwu.

Tuoba Chongyuan... who would want to go against him? It’s a thankless task and would only bring the wrath of the Tuoba Family.

Chi Zhiyan glanced around and, as expected, asked, “Senior Shedu?”

Tang Shedu could only cough and step forward. But at this point, he had no room for tact and had to respond quietly, “Yuanwu Peak is currently short on manpower. I cannot manage matters alone...”

Chi Zhiyan scanned the crowd and spoke softly, “Fellow Daoist Lingu...”

A middle-aged man stepped out from the crowd and cupped his hands in greeting. He looked unremarkable, with two bulging gourds tied to his waist and vine armor glowing with dharma light. He was Lingu Rao of the Jiachuan Lingu Family, known in years past as the Raozi Scorpion and once a guardian of the Southern Sea for Azure Pond Sect.

A century ago, Lingu Rao had been a well-known cultivator, and his father, Lingu Xia, was even more renowned. However, Lingu Rao had always guarded the Southern Sea and rarely returned inland, so after a hundred years, few still remembered his name.

Chi Zhiyan was about to issue orders when he suddenly paused. The great void split open before him, and a golden rune flew out and landed in his palm.

Chi Zhiyan closed his eyes for a second, carefully absorbing the rune’s message. Then he suddenly laughed aloud. When he reopened his eyes, they were full of joy as he declared, “Let all my fellow Daoists be informed, Tuoba Chongyuan has had his Dharma robe torn and his physical form shattered. He perished violently in Baixiang Valley! Only a single wisp of his soul remains, and is likely returning to Shengle Heaven for reincarnation!”

The news caught everyone off guard. Tang Shedu let out a sigh of relief. Joy naturally lifted his spirits, and unable to suppress his curiosity, he asked, “Congratulations, my lord! May I ask which high cultivator was responsible?”

Chi Zhiyan laughed heartily. “It was the Eastern Sea Dragon Clan! Perhaps Dingyuan, the Dragon Son, was drawn in by the situation in Xu State and somehow crossed thousands of kilometers straight inland.

“Xu State is vast, and yet he happened to run straight into Tuoba Chongyuan! How could a dragon kin spare a member of the Tuoba Family? He beat him to death on the spot! He even snatched his life-bound seal; it might even be displayed as decoration in the palace of the Dragon Clan!”

Chi Zhiyan was in high spirits, enjoying the drama and not minding the chaos. He even added a few mocking remarks, to which Ning Heyuan quickly flattered, “Congratulations, my lord!”

Chi Zhiyan replied with a cheerful smile, “Tuoba Xuantan killed the True Hornless Dragon's seventh son, Dongfang Tianye, to forge his Hehou Profound Pearl and Water Wall Treasure Pill. The Dragon Clan hate them to the bone... Now that they’ve caught someone from the Tuoba Family, flaying him alive would hardly be an exaggeration.”
𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝑐𝘰𝑚

Chi Zhiyan nodded with a smile. If Tuoba Chongyuan was dead, the Tuoba Family would likely retreat, and the eastern threat was naturally resolved, so how could he not be pleased?

Now in a leisurely mood, he added, “You should still refer to him as the True Monarch of Profound Breath of Tiancheng or Emperor Wu of Liang... After all, he was a True Monarch. Though now dead and his Dao extinguished, calling him by name directly might yet bring misfortune.”

Outwardly, he chatted casually about the Liang Dynasty's tale, but inwardly, he began speculating, Daoist Master Yuan Xiu sending that rune reply so suddenly was clearly unexpected. Perhaps the Dragon Clan's move was brilliant, catching both the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and the Maha off guard...

It’s odd though... Since the established rules still hold, it definitely wasn’t the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had struck...

Lost in thought, he grew silent. One by one, the others withdrew, and the great hall gradually emptied.

Ning Heyuan and Li Xuanfeng returned together to their cave dwelling, each lost in their own thoughts. Ning Heyuan was the first to speak, “How are your injuries now, brother-in-law?”

Li Xuanfeng was more concerned about Li Xizhi’s condition, but didn’t wish to ask too directly. He waved his hand and replied, “I’ve taken the treasured panacea that was delivered. It’s worked well. There’s no need to worry.”

Li Xuanfeng’s injuries had resulted in him being summoned by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, and the Ning Family had personally provided a healing treasure. It was a Dream Swamp Grass, far more precious than the Huashang Fruit Li Tongya had received years ago.

Li Xuanfeng’s appearance had even regained a youthful glow after taking the herb.

Ning Heyuan noticed and felt much more at ease. He then said solemnly, “Brother-in-law, there’s something suspicious about Tuoba Chongyuan’s death!”

Li Xuanfeng certainly understood and responded quietly, “Of course there’s something strange... Perhaps even the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators couldn’t foresee it.”

Ning Heyuan nodded and said, “The spiritual currents in Xu State are in disformation now. The great void is crowded with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha. It’s impossible to calculate anything clearly! That’s why all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are playing their games... But how did Tuoba Chongyuan just happen to run into a dragon kin?

“Moreover, Shengle Heaven isn’t some ordinary force. The Tuoba Family must have demons stationed in the great void. Even if the current state of Xu State is obscured in the void, surely they can still sense the vitality of their own juniors, can’t they?”

Li Xuanfeng stared heavily at the jade table. A young figure suddenly appeared in his mind. He had specifically asked about Li Xizhi’s situation, and had once met Dongfang Heyun in the Northern Sea.

Perhaps he was the one who acted... Dongfang Heyun was the first breath exhaled by the Dragon Monarch during his core formation, so his origins are beyond prediction. Once a Dragon Monarch is involved, not even all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha combined can make accurate calculations.

But speculation would do them no good at this point. Li Xuanfeng asked, “How is the forging of the dharma artifact progressing?”

“The Murong Family’s heavy armor bears many traces of devil cultivators. It’s hard to smelt, and we still need more than half the allotted time,” Ning Heyuan replied.

He expressed further concern for Li Xuanfeng’s injuries, and soon took his leave. After seeing Ning Heyuan off, Li Xuanfeng returned to his cave dwelling and sat cross-legged. He took out a jade bottle from his robes.

Inside the jade bottle was the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill bestowed by Yuan Xiu. Even through the precious container, holding it felt like gripping a blade’s edge.

The Chi and Ning families keep checking on my injuries and have sent such a valuable pill... It’s clear they want me to recover quickly, and begin working for Azure Pond Sect again.

Li Xuanfeng paused, then tipped the vial to let the pill inside fall out. Golden light flashed, brilliantly lighting the room in radiant white. The celestial pill hovered gently in the air, as if inspecting its surroundings.

Golden-white light flowed along the pill's patterns, and the cave was instantly filled with a fragrant aroma. The sound of clashing metal echoed loudly, while crimson, earthy patterns appeared on the walls, and gold and silver powder swirled up from the ground.

At this rate, everything in the cave will be turned into metal and stone in no time.

He didn’t hesitate for a moment longer. He picked up the pill and gently placed it in his mouth.

Buzz!

Li Xuanfeng heard a deafening hum in his mind as the world began to spin around him. The moment the pill entered his mouth, it vanished, turning into golden light that coursed through his body and swiftly settled in his qi sea.

He had long cultivated the Engraved Stone technique, so his qi sea was already filled with golden mists mixed with hints of crimson. But the moment this new, distinct golden light entered, it stirred up a stormy surge within.

Engraved Stone was a technique from the Golden Tang Gate. Its qi could break formations, cleave mountains, destroy enemy dharma artifacts, and pierce defenses with precision. The more enemies slain, and the more blood refined it, the stronger it became.

He had perfected the Engraved Stone long ago. As an Immortal Foundation, it empowered his body, turning it to metal and stone, as well as controlled baleful qi in harmony with his Strength to Move Mountains. His spiritual orifices spewed killing force, thus his current renown.

Now, golden energy within his qi sea swirled together, rising and sinking. Lighter essence ascended, and the denser descended. The energies began to reconnect, reforming the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill anew.

To his surprise, his cultivation, which had seemingly hit its limit, began circulating again. It rose further, breaking past the peak of Foundation Establishment Realm and beginning a new phase of condensation.

This...

A strange feeling arose within him, eerily similar to the sensation he’d experienced decades ago when forming his Foundation Establishment. It felt as if something was taking shape within his qi sea.

Sure enough, the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill slowly morphed, transforming into a massive golden talisman covered in intricate patterns that radiated bursts of multicolored light.

A realization slowly dawned on Li Xuanfeng, The Immortal Foundation, Heavenly Gilded Helm!

What had appeared in his qi sea was unmistakably a fellow Dao partner of his Engraved Stone. It was another Immortal Foundation of the Geng Metal system, the Heavenly Gilded Helm.

His aura advanced once again, as golden armor-like patterns emerged across his body. Yet Li Xuanfeng’s expression darkened, and he thought coldly, So the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill was actually a method of completing a Dao Partner...

There were many Dao Partners on the path to Golden Core Realm, particularly within the Metallic Essence system. They complemented one another and were to be cultivated once a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability was achieved.

Cultivating such partners naturally took longer than consuming another’s foundation. Thus, in Jiangnan, it was common for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to devour Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, something Xiao Yuansi had once warned of.

So even at Foundation Establishment Realm, pills can be taken to add a Dao Partner in the qi sea... This brings many wonders, but it's an act of forced growth. It can impair the mind and make reaching Purple Mansion far more difficult...

Two brilliant lights were intertwining in his qi sea, but Li Xuanfeng opened his aging eyes slightly. He quickly grasped the motives of Daoist Master Yuan Xiu and Daoist Master Qiushui...

Daoist Master Qiushui clearly meant to benefit the Ning Family... I was the best candidate to practice this art... Whether or not Ning Wan breaks through, this act already brings great gain to the Ning Family...

As for Daoist Master Yuan Xiu, I can bring more benefits to Azure Pond Sect with my newfound strength... Both Daoist Masters saw their interests align, that’s why they summoned me together.

Though the Immortal Foundation had taken shape, the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill’s medicinal power continued to refine and infuse into the Heavenly Gilded Helm, steadily completing its form.

So this is the calculation of Daoist Masters...

Li Xuanfeng felt a cold chill run down his spine. He had never considered the Purple Mansion Realm, especially since the follow-up to his cultivation method, the Heavenly Lustrous Gold Sutra, was held by the Golden Tang Gate. Whether he had the chance or not, pushing himself toward Purple Mansion Realm didn’t serve Azure Pond Sect or anyone else.

But this single pill had forced the path to Purple Mansion Realm to fade into uncertainty. Shock and anger stirred within him, and as his thoughts spiraled, Yuan Su’s face gradually surfaced in his mind.

But I dare not hate...

More clarity slowly emerged in his heart. The mana from the Heavenly Gilded Helm was slightly dim, flowing through his meridians, causing the golden patterns on his skin to grow increasingly vivid.

The Heavenly Gilded Helm, its essence is cold and sharp, skilled at absorbing and emitting metallic energy, drawing golden brilliance. Once activated, the Immortal Foundation manifests a full helm over the body, turning it into a sculpture of stone and metal.

When worn, it grants the strength to tear tigers and leopards, immune to water and fire, resistant to baleful poisons, able to mend wounds with stone and metal. It can even regenerate severed limbs...

Li Xuanfeng’s cultivation continued to rise. He quietly attuned himself to the change. Within his qi sea, as if clouds parted to reveal the sky, something stirred. Another presence began to rise.

The object was radiant and milky-white, its brilliance halting the flow of golden energy. The golden orb receded, all energies condensed, and Li Xuanfeng’s heart skipped a beat.

This pill... has activated the talisman seeds!




# Chapter 784: Anhuai Heaven

As he observed the radiant brilliance within his qi sea, Li Xuanfeng slowly recalled the incantation he had chanted when receiving the talisman, “I, Li Xuanfeng of the Li Family, respectfully invoke the Profound Light Dharma, guardian of fate and peace of mind. I vow to cultivate in accordance with the Dao, to speak and act in timely merit, to uphold truth and vow, and when the talisman burns, to surrender this body unto the Yin Realm.”

A response came from within the talisman seeds. “To this Li scion, forsake passion and impulse, halt error and fault, and sever evil at its root. We bestow the Profound Light Dharma to inspire a path of cultivation, from mortal to sage, beginning to end. First by abstention, then by ascension to truth...”

The Li Family had long pondered the talisman’s response. The full scripture was lengthy, with parts stating ‘Fate immutable, unseen by ghosts and gods,’ referring to how even Purple Mansion Realm divine arts could not deceive it, and ‘Serenity by nature, peace of heart,’ referring to the talisman seed’s power to still the mind.

So what the Li Family had pledged was, ‘To speak in timely merit, uphold vow and truth, and upon the burning of the talisman, surrender the body to the Yin Realm.’

Li Xuanfeng had once quietly spoken with his suspicious and fierce nephew, Li Yuanjiao, who had said, “In the early days, our family didn’t grasp the true situation. We took pills from the markets; how can we be sure there were no blood pills among them? Uncle once broke through using a pill, but no one knows its origin.”

Li Xuanfeng understood what his nephew left unsaid, “Our family forbade the use of blood sustenance, which was a rule passed down from Second Uncle. He once spoke of the Immortal Mirror’s people-centric path. Feeding on the mortal world... It was all a rejection of blood-based cultivation.

“If that’s true, then the pill I took back then must’ve been a blood pill, so why did the Mirror show nothing?”

They hadn’t dared to continue the conversation, and had instead silently preserved the family’s teachings. But now, seeing the white light rising in his qi sea, Li Xuanfeng’s heart finally sank, I have committed my share of wrongs, so this punishment is rightfully mine.

The soft white light shone gently down on his golden-talisman-like Immortal Foundation. It illuminated the pure from the impure, splitting them apart. A profound light emerged from within the talisman seeds.

The profound light was dense with runes as it leaped upward, then sank into the Immortal Foundation. The golden glow shattered at once as spirit energy dispersed. The qi sea trembled violently as a searing, bone-piercing pain rippled through Li Xuanfeng.

His vision dimmed slightly. The talisman seed within his qi sea seemed on the verge of breaking free into the void. It no longer rested at the bottom of his qi sea but leaped repeatedly in midair.

When the talisman burns, the body is offered to the Yin Realm.

Li Xuanfeng felt as though ten thousand silver needles were vibrating in his mind. If this talisman seed truly flew off into the void, it would take all his cultivation with it. ‘Offering the body to the Yin Realm was no mere poetic phrase.

In that brief moment, his mana and essence qi surged wildly into his qi sea, forming torrents that nearly emptied his reserves. Lines of alchemical script were engraved onto the talisman seed.

As his life teetered on the edge, a heavy and awe-inspiring presence seemed to descend into his qi sea. The talisman seed immediately halted, and hovered quietly atop the qi sea.

His essence qi and mana surged anew, flooding his limbs and bones. The Immortal Foundation Heavenly Gilded Helm solidified from illusion to reality, as it fully formed once again in his qi sea.

Li Xuanfeng sat in silence, with his eyes closed. The talisman seed still floated uneasily within his qi sea, as if it had been suppressed by some unseen force. It was hovering in place and refusing to sink down again.

He steadied his breath and slowly opened his eyes. The baleful winds still circled within the cave. When he felt the restrained talisman seed within him, Li Xuanfeng murmured to himself, “To keep the vow... to keep the vow... If I can use this body for one more deed, I may yet redeem my sins.”

His expression remained calm, betraying no emotion. The golden stone gathered of its own accord before him, forming a mirror that reflected Li Xuanfeng’s face.

It was the face of a man in his mid-thirties. His long hair was jet-black; his eyes were filled with baleful intent; and his features were fierce and bold. All his wrinkles and white hairs had vanished.

The newly formed Immortal Foundation had renewed his youth, restoring him to an image of himself from years ago.

This was the face I had when I first left home... Back when Second Uncle was still alive, and Xuanling had yet to perish. Li Xuanfeng gazed at his reflection and felt a faint sense of comfort. I’ve killed too much... and even practiced blood sustenance. I doubt I have many days left. If I still bore that vicious old face, I’d surely frighten them.

But if I pass into the underworld like this, at least my father and brothers will still recognize me.

———

Great void.

Lu Jiangxian had been staring at the descending ruins of the cave dwelling for quite some time, silently calculating in his heart. He hadn’t expected Li Xuanfeng to run into trouble first.

It was Lu Jiangxian’s first time witnessing someone under the talisman contract ingest a Dao Foundation. The talisman seed had been triggered before he even activated it, instantly leaping out of the man’s qi sea to devour all of his essence and mana. It had been ready to return to the mirror.

Had Lu Jiangxian not noticed in time and suppressed the talisman seed’s instinct, he would’ve been forced to watch Li Xuanfeng die, and bear witness to the seed flying back to the mirror.

The talisman seed truly does have a certain instinct. Once the hidden life-contract is activated, it breaks from its bearer and returns to the mirror... Lu Jiangxian’s earlier doubts began to ease, It seems the pill Li Tongya took back then must have been refined by some Eastern Sea demon and escaped the talisman seed’s detection... Otherwise, the seed would have fled his body just like today.

The one who forged this mirror clearly intended it to act as a detector. In the eyes of the talisman seed, ingestion is ingestion, there is no room for excuse. It will take your life immediately.

Li Xuanfeng...

He quickly withdrew his gaze and turned his attention once more to the descending ruins.

Now that several True Monarchs were missing, and with Yue Cultivating having cleared the path, the buddhist cultivators had grown visibly restless. There were far more buddhist cultivators in the great void than southern Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. So they held the upper hand within these ruins.

In the great void, Yuan Xiu, Qiushui, and other Daoist Masters wore grim expressions. Daoist Master Changxi of Profound Peak Gate was present, as was someone from the Purple Smoke Gate, hovering in the air in their signature violet robes.

As one of only two immortal families in Yue State with Purple Mansion Realm status, the Yuyang’s Chen Family beside Changxiao Gate had also sent someone. Known for their low profile, their Purple Mansion Realm representative was a man in simple grey robes, standing quietly at the back.

Even Mount Dali’s demon den had sent a fox demon at the Purple Mansion Realm. He seemed to be a barefoot youth in white, but each cheek sprouted an extra ear. His cultivation was already at the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, and he listened absentmindedly with a tilted head.

Snow Ji Gate still remained sealed in seclusion. Changxiao Gate was at war with Hengzhu Dao Gate, while Crimson Reef Island was clashing with Great Xiukui Temple. Naturally, none of them had sent delegates. Xiao Chuting had been stationed in the Northern Sea, and the Xiao Family had no other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, so they too were absent.

Expressions among the cultivators varied. Daoist Master Changxi wore a rare look of satisfaction. Clearly, his disciple Kong Tingyun from Profound Peak Gate had reaped significant benefits within the ruins. Her Golden Mountain dharma artifact was especially effective against buddhist cultivators, so she was truly a fish in water now.

Daoist Master Qiushui looked much more composed. Since Zhang Yun was in seclusion, Golden Feather Sect had sent Zhang Duanyan in her place. She was a female cultivator, but clearly not Zhang Yun’s equal. Her performance was merely passable.

Among all the cultivators present, the middle-aged man seated to the north wore the darkest expression. It was so heavy it seemed to drip with suppressed fury. His robes were ethereal and majestic, much like Tuoba Chongyuan’s. Clearly, he hailed from Shengle Heaven.

Tuoba Chongyuan had been attacked precisely when the ruins of the Dongning Palace descended. The great void had been in turmoil, but he had reacted within just a quarter of an hour. But by then, most of Tuoba Chongyuan’s life force had vanished. When the man traversed the great void and manifested back in the world, all he managed to preserve was a single wisp of Tuoba Chongyuan’s soul.

That wisp was missing more than half its essence. Even if it reincarnated, it might no longer be Tuoba Chongyuan. Outwardly, he maintained appearances, claiming to his demonic allies that his soul was intact, but only he knew the bitterness buried deep in his heart, The one who struck is frighteningly powerful... Even though Chongyuan had fought multiple battles and used most of his trump cards, he still shouldn’t have died in just fifteen minutes... That level of strength is simply beyond Foundation Establishment Realm...

The Tuoba Family had lost all face, so how could he not be filled with a mix of fury and fear? He had also broken the rules, and now the ruins were out of reach. Rage burned within him, but there was nothing he could do.

For this person to strike with such perfect timing, they must have been stalking Chongyuan for a long time! The Dragon Clan clearly hasn’t let go of their grudge against my family. Their plotting must’ve begun back in Dai Commandery...

Yet, he couldn’t discern which branch of the Dragon Clan had appeared. Based on their expressions, not even the Maha could figure it out. This only laced his rage with dread and fear.

Could Beijia and Xiyang be involved too? But why would they target someone so junior?
𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎

The Dragon Clan had once run rampant and made many enemies. The Tuoba Family was merely one of the more prominent targets. He’d thought that the Dragon Clan wouldn’t be so persistent after so many years, but he had been met with a crushing blow the moment he stepped out.

Back then, the Nine Sons of the True Hornless Dragon were known for their troublemaking. They would do everything from besieging True Monarchs to harassing imperial heirs. At their peak, they had more than ten Dragon Monarchs. If not for internal strife and a lack of Dao Embryos, the Four Seas’ Dragon Palaces could’ve rivaled the demon courts.

But they were all too unruly, drawing the ire of both immortals and demons. Suppression, both open and hidden, had reduced their numbers. Now, only two sons remained, and one was missing. Even the Dragon Clan had lost the Northern Sea. Beijia had fled eastward, lying low to lick his wounds and focus on thunder cultivation. Surely, he wouldn’t be stirring trouble again...

But who can say for sure... Emperor Wu once said, ‘The Nine Sons of the True Hornless Dragon are wild and wanton...’ Now that the Dragon Clan has greatly declined, and Beijia and Xiyang only spared because they couldn’t be killed, the world has gradually stopped suppressing them. Who’s to say they won’t revert to their old ways?

When the middle-aged man reached this point in his thoughts, he was already considering withdrawal. Suddenly, light burst forth from the great void. Brilliant multicolored radiance swiftly spread across the void.

“What...”

The colors flickered and quickly dimmed. Several Maha began forming spells to divine the cause, but soon looked at one another and shook their heads, halting their incantations.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator and Mahas all found it strange and began speculating about the light. But Lu Jiangxian, hidden off to the side, had a sharper divine sense, and what he saw was entirely different.

Xu State was in an unusual state. Its spiritual energy was chaotic, as treasures were scattered across the land, and entirely unpredictable. With so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha standing in the great void, the difficulty of divination had reached its peak. None could determine when or where the next ruin might fall.

But in Lu Jiangxian's eyes, the darkness of the great void was not empty. There were countless phantoms of the immortal families scattered throughout, some floating and some sinking. Some were firmly anchored behind the great void’s veil, while others trembled on the verge of collapse, unlikely to last much longer.

Most of these remnants belonged to the long-fallen Ning State. Lu Jiangxian spotted two particularly solid illusions at the highest points. Having read the memories of the Five-Eyed Merciful One, he had some understanding of these ancient matters.

One emitted multicolored light, so it must be the Wanglin Heaven of the Wanglin Upper Sect. The other, surrounded by a celestial blue glow, belonged to the royal family of Ning State, the Anhuai Heaven.

These two grotto heavens were exceptionally stable. No amount of turmoil caused by a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha could bring them down. Lu Jiangxian himself could only barely perceive them.

But among the many ruins that might descend, one stood out. It was the former royal palace of ancient Ning State, the Great Ning Palace. Despite its ruin, much of it still exuded imperial grandeur. Its soft golden radiance flitted over jade pools, white mists, and golden-feathered robes.

The colored light just now had burst from this very place, an arched portal the size of a doorway, through which faint glimpses of a vibrant world could be seen. Clearly, something within one of the ruins had activated it, triggering a connection to the Great Ning Palace that had caused the colored light to flash briefly through the great void.

A grotto heaven... Though no True Monarch has made a move, and Anhuai Heaven of Ning State won’t descend yet. But the ruins that have fallen include the Great Ning Palace, and it holds an entrance into that grotto heaven!

His heart trembled slightly, and everything before him suddenly became clear.

Judging from this... Even if Xu State is too chaotic to divine due to so many upheavals, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha must already know there’s a hidden grotto heaven in the ruins! That’s why they’re all gathered here!

How could so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha gather for mere Dao lineage disputes or a few fallen ruins? Clearly, they knew the Great Ning Palace held a gateway to Anhuai Heaven.

All their scheming, all the sacrificed cultivators from north and south, all the spiritual energy upheaval, everything had been to shake the Great Ning Palace into revealing itself. Their true ambition was undoubtedly what lay hidden within Anhuai Heaven!

Ning State’s Anhuai Heaven had never been discovered. Who could say how many treasures that were useful to both Foundation Establishment Realm and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were hidden there? Yet, if so many powerful figures were converging, there had to be something even more incredible. Countless thoughts surged through Lu Jiangxian’s mind as his thoughts rapidly crystallized.

So this was the plan all along... Who knows how long it’s been in preparation? Yue State has around a hundred Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Not a lot. Azure Pond Sect won’t lose much. Seems most of the lives sacrificed will be the rapidly-trained northern devil cultivators...

Lu Jiangxian had observed the great void for a long while, and now, his doubts were finally resolved, There will be a great struggle within Anhuai Heaven. It won’t just be Li Xuanfeng entering. If Azure Pond Sect wants to seize more benefits from within the grotto heaven, they’ll need more powerful cultivators...

In the battle to come... Tang Shedu, Yu Su, Lingu Rao, they’ll likely all have to ‘earn merit’ by taking those pills and entering the grotto heaven to fight...

He watched quietly and thought, Anhuai Heaven isn’t like Mirage Mirror Heaven. The Green Pine Temple’s grotto heaven belonged to their own Dao lineage. They divided its treasures politely, and everything was predetermined. But Anhuai Heaven... is where the three great paths battle to the death.

After a hundred years, Lu Jiangxian finally wasn’t someone caught in the storm. This time, he was keeping pace with, and was perhaps even a step ahead of, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

A fire stirred in his heart, If I must send someone into the grotto heaven... Only Li Xuanfeng will do. Now that I can roam the great void in spirit, even if I can’t break into the grotto heaven directly, I can still accomplish far, far more...




# Chapter 786: The Story Of Tuoba

Li Xizhi stayed in Fuchen Peak’s territory for several months until his injuries finally stabilized. His Rainbow Pierce Skyway technique was especially adept at dissolving foreign mana within his body, making it highly effective for healing.

Once he took a closer look, the worst damage was no more than a loss of a dozen or so years of lifespan. The Azure Pond Sect's pills were remarkably potent. Back when his father Li Yuanjiao had relied solely on his own mana to heal, a single injury could force him into seclusion for years. But Li Xizhi began to see results within just a few months after taking the medicine.

He had intended to continue his secluded healing, but unexpectedly, someone came looking for him. Li Quantao had sent someone to pay a visit; it turned out Yu Yuwei was seeking him.

Li Xizhi was slightly surprised. But since he had just escaped a deadly calamity with the man, there might be urgent news. He hurriedly came out of seclusion, only to find Li Quantao already waiting outside the formation. He was about the same age as Li Xizhi and always had a smile on his face.

Li Xizhi was grateful to him and thanked him once again, then said softly, “Quantao, you’re also a Li. So from now on, consider yourself my own brother!”

Li Quantao, with his strong arms and bold air, replied, “That’s best! Brother Xizhi, there’s no need to stand on ceremony!”

The two of them left the cave dwelling together. After a moment’s thought, Li Xizhi asked first, “Quan Yi of Linghe Peak was killed by Tuoba Chongyuan and left his mother behind in the sect. He asked us to look after her. Quantao, do you know anything about what’s going on at Linghe Peak?”

Li Quantao was surprised and praised, “Fellow Daoist Quan was truly a filial son. Once I return to the sect, I’ll...”

Li Xizhi didn’t want to trouble him and quickly waved his hand, saying, “I only mean to inquire about her well-being. I owe him a debt and should visit in person once I return to the sect.”

He declined firmly on this matter, secretly staying alert in his heart, I should have someone check on Quan Yi’s mother first. The world is often cruel to the weak. If I return years later and find that the old woman has suffered mistreatment, then I would be at fault.

As they chatted, they arrived at the front courtyard. Yu Yuwei was in the yard, clutching his sleeves as he coughed. Though the old man’s complexion was still a bit pale, his expression was spirited and his aura nearly restored. He had clearly recovered well.

The older the ginger, the spicier it is. Truly, a veteran cultivator of great renown... Seems this fierce battle didn’t damage his core at all... thought Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi greeted him softly, “Senior, your strength is formidable. You saved my life. I, Xizhi, am deeply grateful!”
𝚏𝐫𝚎𝗲𝕨𝐞𝐛𝕟𝚘𝐯𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝗺

“I should be the one thanking you!” Yu Yuwei’s dispirited expression stemmed more from grief over his two disciples than physical injury. As he spoke of it, gloom clouded his brow, and he sighed, “If he hadn’t gone after you... I might not have made it out alive. But you, to escape while being hunted by him. That’s truly remarkable!”

He paused, choosing not to waste time on mutual courtesies, and said quietly, “Young friend, Tuoba Chongyuan is dead!”

Li Xizhi had already heard some things over the past few months. How sharp was he? When he heard that Tuoba Chongyuan had been slain by someone from the Dragon Clan, he immediately understood.

So Dongfang Heyun really did catch his fish! thought Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi already had a hunch when Tuoba Chongyuan claimed to be Emperor Wu and founded a nation by slaying a dragon. He feared that if Dongfang Heyun acted too soon, he might get dragged into it. But that guy was shrewd, so he probably lay in wait near the spear or the carriage.

He understood clearly but didn’t show it. He only nodded and replied, “Serves him right.”

Yu Yuwei chuckled quietly and shook his head. “I used to worry Tuoba Chongyuan might come back for revenge. But it’s better that he’s dead. By the time he reincarnates in a few decades, the grudge will have mostly faded.”

Having been hunted by that man, Li Xizhi had a good understanding of his character and said softly, “He didn’t strike me as the type to plot revenge in secret.”

Yu Yuwei smiled, nodded slightly, and drew a large purple cauldron from his sleeve. He placed it at the center of the hall with a loud thud, and a wave of heat surged forth. The cauldron had two handles and three legs. Its surface was adorned with intricate patterns. Purple flames encircled its rim.

Yu Yuwei patted it with some reluctance and said quietly, “That’s what I thought too, but take a look.”

Li Xizhi followed his gesture and looked closely. He saw faint marks etched on the cauldron. The uneven and rugged marks appeared to form four bold, sweeping characters that were sharp and powerful.

Shengle Tuoba.

Yu Yuwei shook his head helplessly and sighed. “I used this cauldron to block his life-bound seal back then. It took the full brunt of the strike, leaving these marks on it. It’s probably an inherent effect of their family’s dharma artifacts. Take a solid hit, and it’ll leave marks that are hard to erase. The next time someone from the Tuoba Family sees it, they’ll know you were once an enemy.”

He looked troubled and said in a deep voice, “I’ve tried every method I know, but the marks won’t come off... This cauldron is a legacy from my ancestors. It is exceptionally important. Most of my cultivation over the years is tied to it. How can I just give it up?”

Li Xizhi was far more at ease. First, he had never taken a direct hit from that seal; most of his injuries came from Tuoba Chongyuan’s spell arts. Second, he didn’t even own any proper dharma artifacts. The sword in his hand was still at the Qi Cultivation Realm, so it was nothing worth worrying about.

Li Xizhi nodded in feigned realization as he carefully examined the inscription. The sense of familiarity surged up once again, and he thought to himself, How strange... I had this same familiar feeling the first time I saw these characters...

When he saw Li Xizhi frown in puzzlement, Yu Yuwei asked a few questions, and Li Xizhi replied, “I just feel like I’ve seen this mark before...”

“Oh?” Yu Yuwei stroked his beard and asked, “Then perhaps your esteemed family has records regarding the imperial seal? I’d like to hear the details.”

Li Xizhi responded, and Yu Yuwei, who seemed quite patient with him, put aside his own concerns and smiled, “Emperor Wu, Tuoba Xuantan, possessed an imperial seal. It’s also the only remaining dharma relic after Shengle Heaven offered two pearls in exchange for the protection of a True Monarch... Everyone in the Tuoba Family is fond of carving seals, and I’ve heard they all model them after the imperial seal.”

Li Xizhi frowned as he looked at the marks again, and finally recalled where the sense of familiarity came from. When he had returned home once and met his father, he had glanced at the name inscribed on the Profound Patterned Bottle. It was Li Qianyuan of Wei State. The calligraphy was similarly vigorous and flowing, fierce and bold. It was at least seventy percent similar to the marks left on the cauldron!

He fell silent for a moment, then asked, “Fellow Daoist, do you know the origin of this imperial seal?”

“That’s a dharma relic!” Yu Yuwei chuckled, but when he saw the seriousness in Li Xizhi’s expression, he thought for a moment and hesitated, “I once overheard some idle gossip... They said this seal wasn’t forged by Tuoba Xuantan himself, but was actually a vassal-state seal from when the Tuoba tribe first settled in Dai Prefecture long ago...”

But he seemed unconvinced even as he said it, and simply finished with a smile, “Who really knows? Some say Tuoba Xuantan fell out with Mount Luoxia and was actually killed by someone from there... Others say the Tuoba Family’s rise was all just a scheme against the Dragon Clan...”

He sighed and shook his head. “Tales from the late ancient era outnumber official histories a hundredfold. Though my family lineage is long and second only to the Yuan Family, even our records from that time are vague...”

Yu Yuwei gave a faintly sardonic smile and said, “No matter how much we guess, Tuoba Xuantan is already dead. There’s really nothing left to figure out.”




# Chapter 787: Feathered Robe

Yu Yuwei could only worry on his own. Li Xizhi didn’t understand artifact refinement and couldn’t be of much help. Azure Pond Sect’s path of artifact refinement had also withered since the deaths of those who had inherited Yuanwu’s mantle such as Tang Shecheng, Yu Xiuxian, and finally Yu Muxian. There were simply no skilled artificers to be found.

The old man wore a troubled expression as he lugged a large purplish-red cauldron around. He glanced at Li Xizhi and said, “Xizhi... the fallen grotto heaven is called Dongning Palace. A few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have already sent people in... Judging by the timing, I hear that gates like Crimson Reef and Xiukui, who usually don’t make moves, will arrive soon as well.”

Li Xizhi nodded, putting on a look of serious attention as Yu Yuwei mumbled, “These days, this old man can hardly see the full picture... Crimson Reef and Xiukui are constantly battling in the outer seas, and cultivators fall every month. Meanwhile, some Purple Mansion Realm elders seem to be turning back north to involve themselves in Mount Bianyan matters...

“Hard to grasp... truly hard to grasp!” The old man sighed heavily, then sat down in confusion.

Meanwhile, Li Quantao looked at the two and said, “Dongning Palace... It was once a cave dwelling for many cultivators of Ning State. Ning State was the homeland of Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun. The Jia, Jiang and Li Families from Ning State were Golden Core Realm immortal descendants, so many things must’ve been left behind. With the Wanglin Sect and Prince Ning... it’s bound to be tempting.”

Yu Yuwei thought even further but their acquaintance was shallow, so he didn’t say much to Li Quantao. He only nodded lightly and muttered, “Yesterday, I received word that my nephew, Yu Fuyu, has died. No one at home is willing to claim the body, so I have to go.”

The Yu Family was in such disarray they might as well have been enemies. Yu Yuwei showed no emotion when he spoke of his nephew’s death. He merely let his eyelids droop, exchanged a few pleasantries, tucked the cauldron into his robes, and rode the wind away.

Once the old man left the courtyard, Li Quantao stepped forward and said quietly, “Brother Zhi... the Yu Family is full of selfish and cruel people. Even though Yu Yuwei is older, that doesn’t mean he’s any better... be cautious.”

When Li Xizhi glanced at him, Li Quantao’s expression turned serious as he added, “Do you still remember the matter of Murong Xia, Brother Zhi? Your family must have records... The Yu Family acted without shame as they openly and righteously rounded up people with mana, built numerous corpse mounds, and even constructed a grand hall where Murong Xia devoured humans day and night.

“Though all the families suffered under Murong Xia and understood that the Yu Family had no choice... they still laughed, never tried to hide it, and even worshiped him from start to finish...”

Li Quantao shook his head and said grimly, “Truly disgraceful!”

Li Xizhi knew this matter as well and nodded slightly. Li Quantao continued, “Besides... Yu Yuxie’s death is also tied to Yu Yuwei. Rumor has it that he was deliberately harmed in a family feud. If someone can kill even his own brother, how can he be trusted?”

Yu Yuxie was clearly made into a pill for cultivation by Chi Wei... Li Xizhi’s expression sobered, but he couldn’t say it aloud. He simply replied, “Thank you for the warning, brother.”

As the two were conversing, a man approached from below, bowing and holding a green command token in both hands. He respectfully said, “Sirs, a celestial order from the upper sect.”

Azure Pond Sect had many ways of delivering orders. If a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator brought one, it would be a solemn matter. But now, they merely sent a token, and not even a messenger. It was clearly a sign of discontent.

Li Xizhi stood, brushed his sleeves, accepted the token with the proper gesture and channeled mana into it. When it shone green, he uttered, “Li Xizhi of Changtian Peak is to return to the station at Baixiang Valley within three days, and follow further orders.”

————

Mount Yan Pass.

Mist hung over Mount Yan Pass as black-robed cultivators descended on the wind. The cultivators below quickly greeted them. Li Wushao, as usual, wore a stern expression and said little, simply riding the wind downward.

As soon as he landed, he found a burly artifact smith dressed in red, with clinking metal tools hanging from his body, standing atop the wall and looking out. It was none other than Chu Minglian.

Chu Minglian had been refining artifacts in the city for the better part of this period. He had ties with the Li Family and was known for his hearty and generous nature, which had helped him blend in well.

When he saw Li Wushao land, Chu Minglian looked over in interest and asked, “Fellow Daoist Wushao... why haven’t we seen you visiting Lingu Lanying lately? And today you’ve returned so quickly...”

The garrison of Lingu Lanying from the Lingu Family was not far from Mount Yan Pass. Her mount was a white Hooked Serpent. Li Wushao often claimed he hadn’t seen such a beast in years and would go there to visit frequently.

Everyone understood what was really going on but refrained from teasing him. They were privately curious and constantly tried to pry out gossip, but Li Wushao was tight-lipped, which only made them more intrigued.

Li Wushao kept a straight face and only replied, “Greetings, Master... devil cultivators have been rampant lately. I fear missing orders, so it’s unwise to leave the formation.”

Li Wushao then drifted away on the wind. Chu Minglian watched, slightly puzzled, and after wandering around the pass for a while, he saw another woman flying in before the formation.

The woman had a lovely appearance and was at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. She wore a light jade-green Daoist robe that glowed with brilliant dharma light. It was clearly not an ordinary item. Her long black hair flowed like a waterfall, and was pinned with several hair ornaments. She was quite beautiful.

The woman bowed and spoke gently, “I am Lingu Lanying of the Jiachuan Lingu Family... I wish to meet Fellow Daoist Qinghong.”

“So it’s a fellow Daoist from Jiachuan Lingu. I am Chu Minglian,” replied Chu Minglian.

Chu Minglian was only here to refine artifacts and didn’t have the dharma artifact to open the formation. He waved politely as he looked Lingu Lanying over with a glance, and courteously stepped aside.

Lingu Lanying wasn’t in a rush. She waited quietly before the formation for a few minutes, and sure enough, someone approached. It was a bright and graceful female cultivator, who respectfully said, “Li Minggong of Qingdu greets senior.”

Her manner was quite agreeable. Lingu Lanying smiled softly and followed her through the formation, passing several city walls before arriving at a small hill. The furnishings on the hill were simple and unremarkable.

Inside the cave dwelling, she found a white-robed woman at a table reading a jade slip. A silver spear was lying flat in the hall. White lightning occasionally flickered around it, producing faint crackling sounds.

This must be the thunder cultivator, Li Qinghong... thought Lingu Lanying.

“Lingu Lanying greets Fellow Daoist!” Lingu Lanying studied her.

Li Qinghong also examined her in return, then smiled and stepped down from her seat, speaking warmly, “Lately, Wushao has been visiting often. I hope he hasn’t troubled you too much, Fellow Daoist!”

Lingu Lanying looked a little embarrassed and replied with a smile, “It’s no trouble at all. My Gu’er has someone to keep her company.”

From her tone, it was clear that Gu’er referred to the white serpent. Li Qinghong had a vague premonition and quietly speculated, What could Lingu Lanying want from me? I am pretty sure this is going to be about Li Wushao and that Gu’er...

After a round of pleasantries, Lingu Lanying finally said, “These past years, your family’s Wushao has grown close with my Gu’er... I’ve seen him many times. He’s sharp and capable, and though my Gu’er is still young, she’s learned quite a bit from him and gained a great deal.”

Li Qinghong nodded with a smile and said gently, “Fellow Daoist, are you suggesting...?”

Lingu Lanying smiled awkwardly and softened her tone, “It would naturally be wonderful if this could come to fruition... Our two families had ties long ago, and I myself have long admired senior...

“Gu’er and I spoke several times. She hesitated for a long while. She said that Wushao was strong, and the Li Family was a prestigious family. Wushao also treated her with great care, so she was very torn...”

At this point, Li Qinghong sensed something was off. Her expression sobered, and she remained silent as Lingu Lanying quietly continued, “But the young one is still... well, young. In the end, she made up her mind. It won’t work. Her family line has always been of the Pristine Water lineage, and she’s always dreamed of a Pristine Water cultivator as her husband. But Wushao... he’s of Water Mansion lineage...”

Lingu Lanying spoke very tactfully, but Li Qinghong wasn’t ignorant. She understood in her heart immediately, Pristine Water and Water Mansion. What nonsense! So in the end, they’re just looking down on Li Wushao’s mixed Hooked Serpent bloodline!

The Hooked Serpent was a descendant of the Pristine Water Feathered Serpent, and the Pristine Water line was considered the most pure and noble among them. Li Qinghong had seen Gu’er before; she was much larger than most Hooked Serpents, with sleek, refined scales and an aura of elegance and nobility.

Other types, like Converging Water or Pit Water, were lesser, being descended from subordinate lines of the Feathered Serpent. Water Mansion was the only one not represented among the many Hooked Serpent clans, making it, naturally, the lowest of the low.

Before meeting Li Yuanjiao, Li Wushao had been destitute and his cultivation weak to the point of fleeing into Lake Xian. That had much to do with his bloodline.

Li Qinghong’s heart grew cold. After so much time together, the cultivators here had long considered Li Wushao one of their own. This left her deeply displeased.

Lingu Lanying hadn’t lied, and though she had phrased it gently, she felt bitterness in her heart. When she saw Li Qinghong’s neutral expression, she could only explain, “This visit carries no disrespect. I simply wished to speak to senior in person... I’ve also brought an apology gift, hoping you might understand.”

Things had reached this point, and even Lingu Lanying felt deeply troubled. The Hooked Serpent Gu’er at her side was the only daughter of a revered and powerful elder serpent within their family. Lingu Lanying had no choice but to show her some respect.

When she first heard about the two serpents, she had been excited for a day or two. Since the Li family was currently ascending, Lingu Lanying was eager to establish ties. But no matter how pleased she was with the potential marriage, it wasn’t a decision she could make alone. How could she force Gu’er to submit?

At this point, Lingu Lanying seemed rather flustered. Li Qinghong could see the difficulty in her eyes, and her own impulse to lash out subsided. She sighed softly and said, “This is simply a matter of mutual affection. There’s no need for any apology gift, please take it back.”

Now that she had been dragged into this mess for no reason, Li Qinghong had little patience left. The Lingu Family was among the top families. She had already shown enough courtesy and had no desire to say more.

Li Qinghong brushed her off with a few perfunctory words. Seeing her sour expression, Lingu Lanying quickly took her leave. Just as Li Qinghong was about to summon Li Wushao, Li Minggong hurried over and said respectfully, “Aunt, Master Chu has finished crafting the feathered robe!”

The feathered robe was originally a brocade garment captured from a devil cultivator, and had once belonged to the Wanglin Upper Sect. Chu Minglian had taken a liking to it and spent a long time modifying it, incorporating every rare material he could find. After much effort, it was finally complete.

“Oh?” Li Qinghong’s eyes lit up.

She exited the cave with Li Minggong, just in time to see Li Wushao and Kongheng waiting outside. Kongheng’s cultivation had advanced, and he looked radiant. Li Wushao stood quietly to the side.

Since there were many people present, Li Qinghong didn’t speak further and simply said softly, “Let’s see the feathered robe first.”

Mount Yan Pass had once been home to a minor sect. There was a fire vein on the mountain, and the group rode the wind down to a furnace platform where Chu Minglian was waiting. His hearty face beamed with joy. He cupped his hands to Li Qinghong, then swept his sleeve over the table. A white feathered robe appeared upon it.

The elegant and regal feathered robe gleamed with pure white feathers. It had a ring of beautiful cyan-blue plumes around the collar and shoulders, emitting a halo-like glow. The feathers flowed downward in waves, weaving cyan, blue, and white into a jewel-like tapestry.

The shimmering iridescence of the robe captivated everyone’s eyes. Chu Minglian was obviously proud as his gaze moved lovingly across the garment. He was clearly reluctant to part with it.

“This feathered robe originally belonged to the Wanglin Upper Sect but was later altered by a devil cultivator into something unrecognizable. I removed the gaudy embellishments and reworked many details. It’s no longer what it once was.

“I also reinterpreted many of the ancient design elements. After all, the True Monarch’s essence is now of Metallic nature, and many aspects are no longer suited to the original form.”

He let out a hearty laugh, confidence brimming in his voice, “What’s more, since the Fruition Attainment of the True Monarch of the Jade True Unified Void Essence, I’ve carefully modified all the arrays and incantations. Its power now surpasses what it once was and enhances the wearer far more effectively.”

Chu Minglian’s expression turned serious as he declared, “I may not match Tang Shecheng of old, but the foundation of this feathered robe is excellent. In its current form, it’s absolutely on par with the dharma robes of the direct descendents of Azure Pond and Golden Feather Sects!”
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝓮𝒘𝙚𝙗𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝒐𝙢

This feathered robe was certainly not of the same class as the Xia You spirit fan, but even resting on the table, it radiated an aura that stirred the soul. Li Qinghong picked it up gently, her face alive with joy.

“As for its defensive abilities, those go without saying. It can easily withstand casual attacks from an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. If you, Qinghong, actively channel your mana into it and reinforce the surface, its effect will rise to the next level.” Chu Minglian explained, “First, the Cyan Plume. This robe retains techniques from the Wanglin Sect of old. The devil cultivators who obtained it had no idea how to use them, and so they lay dormant for years. If you channel mana into the thirty-two tail feathers, they will emit cyan light, like a thunderous and swift bird soaring to the sky. Whether flying through the heavens or diving into the sea, the effect is formidable.

“Second, the Tranquil Frost. The robe incorporates materials like Cold-metal and Ice-jade. The moment you put it on, Qinghong, it will produce a calming, icy aura. Whether for cultivation or resisting illusions in combat, it offers remarkable benefits!”

Li Qinghong was already enamored with the robe. The cyan, blue, and white hues of the feathers flowed through her hands and past her pale wrist.

Chu Minglian chuckled and said, “I also crafted a technique called Imperial Plume. The robe’s thirty-two cyan tail feathers can now be released all at once, each trailing radiant light. Every feather flies like an arrow, it will be extremely effective against numerous enemies.”

“Many thanks, Senior!” said Li Qinghong, smiling gently.

Chu Minglian nodded, his broad face glowing with pride, and asked, “This robe may only be a refitted piece, but it’s the best work I’ve ever produced. Qinghong, have you decided on a name for it?”

Li Qinghong gave a slight nod, watching the colors flow across her palm and the soft swaying of the cyan tail feathers in the wind. After a moment’s thought, she replied, “Let’s call it Cyan Sparrow Plume!”




# Chapter 789: Having A Child

Li Qinghong accepted the feathered robe and thanked Chu Minglian. Though the old man had been sent by the Ning Family and his compensation would be handled by them, Li Qinghong still took out a storage pouch from her sleeve and slipped it into his hand.

Chu Minglian naturally refused, but Li Qinghong softly said, "Senior Chu’s artifact forging skills are superb. My family may have further need of your expertise in the future. Our families have also long been connected. Please, accept this."

Chu Minglian hesitated for a moment, but ultimately tucked it into his robe, and took his leave. As Li Qinghong escorted him out of the hall, golden light rippled twice in the northern sky before gradually fading.

She calculated the direction; it was exactly where the ancient ruin had descended. She thought, The ruin has most likely already been divided, and the scraps others couldn't be bothered to carry are now left for the ordinary disciples of the various sects.

It was not just Li Qinghong, this was something all the nearby cultivators had grown used to. Year after year, whenever a grotto heaven appeared, it would always be divided among the major sects, and common cultivators would never get a share.

She looked closely and saw that the golden light flared up at that spot, streaking through the air with a trailing blaze, gradually growing larger as it neared, until it stopped before her. It was a woman in a Xiang-style robe, her Dharma robe shimmering, holding a golden orb in her hand.

She stopped before the formation and said with a smile, "Is Qinghong within the formation? Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak has come to visit!"

"Sister Tingyun." Li Qinghong paused only slightly before understanding, Profound Peak must have had a stake in the unidentified ruin as well. Now that Kong Tingyun had reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, she had naturally been sent there.

Kong Tingyun had just returned from the north, yet her aura was steady and her attire neat. She looked nothing like someone returning from a battle. Rather, she seemed like someone who had just broken through in cultivation.

As always, she was warm and friendly. She landed inside the formation and spoke with a sweet smile, "I had sect duties here, and when I heard that you were stationed nearby, I came to see you as soon as my tasks were done."

Li Qinghong dismissed the others, pulled her inside the cave dwelling, and said, "It's been years since we last met. You've truly changed a lot, Tingyun."

Kong Tingyun now carried a more dignified and refined air. Perhaps she had just emerged from secluded cultivation, for while her brows and eyes still danced with a smile, her clothing and the glow of her mana emanated a sharp intensity.

"I did come upon a fortunate opportunity, but my feelings haven't changed. Qinghong, don't treat me as an outsider." Kong Tingyun smiled and shook her head, sitting beside her and lowering her voice, "There were too many people earlier, so I couldn’t speak freely. I said it was sect business, but in truth, it was that fallen Dongning Palace. I saw many people and many things inside... It was just a few months, but it felt like years."

Li Qinghong nodded gently, and Kong Tingyun continued, "My family's power once lay between Xu State and Ning State. It was only after our family's upheaval that we moved to Jiangnan, so I know a bit about such matters. I gained some benefits in Dongning Palace, and heard a few things as well."

She spoke in a low voice, "Qinghong, do you still remember Wrathful Maha Fahui?"

When Li Qinghong heard that name, her expression turned solemn as she replied, "Of course I haven't forgotten."

Li Tongya had died because of him. Li Qinghong was not the only one who still remembered, but who in the Li Family didn’t remember?

Kong Tingyun continued earnestly, "He had cultivated through nine lifetimes, and was just one step away from attaining the Dharma Master, but he fell at Mount Bianyan. Wrathful Dao already had a scattered lineage, and it swiftly declined afterward...

"But while I was there, I encountered a monk and gathered some information from him... He said that in he earlier years, Wrathful Dao had a loyal Merciful One who returned from Mobei. He had been ambushed and seriously injured, but he had managed to escape and vanished."

Li Qinghong sharply met her gaze, her heart skipping like a lightning strike, Was this truly gathered intel? Or is Changxi using Tingyun’s mouth to send me a warning?

Either way, it made little difference. Changxi had tried to show goodwill to her family more than once. Li Qinghong quickly expressed her thanks, but Kong Tingyun waved her hand and said gravely, "No need to thank me, Qinghong. That’s not the only issue... there’s more trouble.

"First, a monk of the Way of Emptiness fled into your family's territory and was slain. He was one of the Five-Eyed Merciful One’s Arhats... someone who was valued greatly. Taking a life is the primary karmic tie... I fear they may come seeking trouble because of it.

"Second... there’s a Merciful One in the north; his Dharma name is Nuzi. He seems to have set sights on Senior Xuanfeng. He’s silently observing from the shadows. Though there are many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators around, so he dares not act, but it’s still unsettling..."

Taken together, this meant that three Merciful Ones had their eyes on the Li Family. Li Qinghong felt a heavy weight in her heart and bowed in thanks, "Many thanks for the sect’s warning... This favor will be remembered."

Kong Tingyun waved her hand and replied, "There’s also good news. Years ago, your family inquired with mine about the Bright Yang spirit item. I hadn’t heard anything, until now. I finally came across a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm spirit item, the Radiant Sky Stone, in Dongning Palace!"

The Li Family had inquired about spirit items several times. The Cui Family had initially pointed them to the Ning Family's channels. Li Xuanfeng asked once and had indeed acquired a certain item called Suyuan Hua in the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven.

But he had long traded that spirit item to Daoist Master Pu Yu from the outer sea in exchange for Winter Cold Qi to help Ning Wan with her breakthrough. That item had then fallen into Daoist Master Pu Yu’s hands, whose sect was elusive and untraceable, leaving them with no further leads.

Li Qinghong was instantly invigorated. She quickly met King Tingyun’s eyes and asked, "Did it fall into your hands, sister?"

Kong Tingyun shook her head regretfully and spoke in a low voice, "I was in a dangerous situation at the time and only caught a brief glimpse. The hexagonal white stone shimmered brightly, with light and flame intertwining around it, making the surrounding mist glow orange from the heat. It was definitely the Radiant Sky Stone.

"The Radiant Sky Stone was fiercely contested, but in the end, it fell into the hands of Yu Fuzi from Changxiao Gate."

Li Qinghong fell into silence, while Kong Tingyun raised her brow and said quietly, "This person has some strength, and he also bears a grudge against me. But right now, I have no idea where he is..."

Kong Tingyun's meaning was faintly revealed, but Li Qinghong’s heart sank.

Relations between the Changxiao Gate and Profound Peak Gate were far from cordial. In fact, Li Qinghong herself had killed a member of Changxiao Gate before, though it had yet to be discovered.

Kong Tingyun clearly hadn’t considered retrieving the item through trade as she likely believed the Li Family had nothing that could tempt Yu Fuzi. Yet Li Qinghong couldn’t just follow along with that view and remained silent.

Kong Tingyun said softly, "Yu Fuzi is a direct descendant of Changxiao. That sect has two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, and one of them is likely watching from the great void... It will indeed be difficult. I've passed on the message; if your family has allies who might be able to try, you'll have to judge for yourselves."

Li Qinghong softly thanked her. It was clear that Kong Tingyun was referring to Xiao Chuting. But the Xiao Family had become increasingly low-key in recent years and rarely appeared in public. Xiao Chuting had long been absent from Jiangnan, and the Xiao Family tended to avoid entanglements. So, it was very unlikely that they would offer support.

After chatting a little longer, Kong Tingyun took her leave on the wind. Li Qinghong escorted her out, then returned to her cave dwelling. After some thought, she quietly began to write a letter.

The Li Family household.

Winter snow fell with a soft rustle. This year, the snowfall was heavier. Cold snow gathered atop the long stone wall along the riverbank, painting it in stark gray and white. A few pedestrians hurried past, clutching new quilts in their arms.
𝒻𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝘮

This riverside dam had originally been constructed after two sects exploited the flood caused by the Yuan Family patriarch’s death. The lake had long since receded, leaving behind a long, gray-white dam wall.

Li Zhouwei walked casually down the snow-laden path, cloaked in a black robe. An Siwei and Chen Yang were following behind him.

His father, Li Chengliao, had already reached the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and had gradually handed over family affairs to him before heading up the mountain to cultivate. Though Li Zhouwei had yet to formally inherit the patriarch's position, the responsibilities of the household had already fallen to him.

The Li Family had already begun separating secular family affairs from the immortal matters of Qingdu in previous generations. This was the trend under the likes of Li Yuanping, Li Yuanjiao, Li Xicheng, and Li Xijun. But now, things had changed.

Since Li Xijun was severely injured on Mount Qingdu and Li Ximing in seclusion, authority now rested with Li Zhouwei. Li Chengliao had relinquished power, and even the affairs of the central hall were now handled by Li Zhouwei.

He handled it all with composure. Each day, he would sit briefly in the central hall, with his brush sweeping like a dragon. Dozens of complex family affairs would be resolved in mere moments. Then, with a flick of his robe, he would return to Mount Qingdu, never wasting time.

Now that he had been cultivating for some time, he even had moments to observe the livelihoods of the common people by the lake. Golden light shimmered faintly in his eyes. A small blue bird was perched on his shoulder; it was the manifestation of the dharma artifact Azure Manifestation, a gift from Yuan Tuan. The spirit bird conjured from it appeared lifelike and animated.

"How have the arrangements for the seven remnant families gone?" Li Zhouwei asked softly, arms folded across his chest.

Chen Yang promptly responded, "They’ve been assigned to various towns and are following orders. As families with a history of wrongdoing, they’ve been quite diligent, though their status is ranked below that of the other families."

The remnant families Li Zhouwei spoke of were, of course, the families left behind after the fall of the Yu Family. All of them had been relocated to the southernmost reaches of Mount Yue, where they would be left to compete and struggle against the various tribes.

An Siwei responded calmly, "Reporting to the heir, the seven families now all identify themselves with Nanzhang Mountain in the southernmost part of Mount Yue. They each claim to hail from Nanzhang and no longer mention their past."

"Smart enough," Li Zhouwei replied casually. He noted the name Nanzhang and pondered, They could be a useful group... not afraid of offending others, and born in a savage land. That place is treacherous. If we give them just enough favor, they won’t be wiped out, and will still serve as a check on the inner families.

From An Siwei’s line, ‘they all claim to be from Nanzhang,’ Li Zhouwei understood that the seven families were consciously forming a united front. First, to contend with the native Mount Yue tribes, and second, to carve out a place in the silent struggles among the prestigious families across various towns.

After a century, the Li Family had already splintered into factions. The man behind him, Chen Yang, represented the Chen Family, and he was a leading figure of Lijing’s four towns among the various peaks.

An Siwei, naturally, represented Huayu’s seven towns. The remaining branches of the Li Family, along with Wutu’s eight towns, Huaqian’s four towns, the Milin’s eighteen towns, and the twenty-six tribes of Eastern Mount Yue each had their own external rivalries and internal discord. The complexity had grown far beyond what it was a century ago.

Among them, the Lijing faction was the strongest. Li Zhouwei had a reputation for favoring unpopular figures, such as Chen Yang, whom the other houses disliked. Bringing in An Siwei, who was well-respected among the Huayu families, was clearly a calculated move.

He was considering promoting one or two people from Nanzhang when a subordinate came rushing up to report, "My lord! News from the Clan Chief’s Court!"

The trusted aide pulled a letter from his sleeve and handed it to Li Zhouwei. He opened it and, after a glance, rare delight appeared on his brow.

"Xu Peiyu is with child," muttered Li Zhouwei.

Xu Peiyu was the first woman Li Zhouwei had taken as a wife. Later, he had married women from the An and Tian Families, with four concubines in total to stabilize his standing. Despite all that, Xu Peiyu still held a special place in his heart.

"No wonder."

Every time he visited, the woman only sought closeness to the point of exhaustion before resting. She hadn’t contacted him in the past two days, and he had thought she’d finally taken a break. However, it seemed she was pregnant.

He tucked the letter away, dismissed the two aides, and rode the wind to Lijing Mountain, landing in the jade-like courtyard of the central hall. The guards on both sides immediately bowed as Li Zhouwei strode straight into the hall.

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

The white-armored palace guards on either side all fell to their knees in unison. Jade halberds and swords clinked crisply as they arranged themselves neatly, their voices echoing in perfect harmony in the hall.

Li Zhouwei’s boots rang coldly against the floor. Unlike his father, Li Chengliao, who would pause to let the guards rise, he walked straight to the end of the hall before his voice finally floated back, "You may rise."

After a few more steps, he soon arrived at the rear hall. His father, Li Chengliao, had only one wife, so this place had always been empty. Now, however, it had become lively, with handmaidens often hurrying through the corridors.

Xu Peiyu’s building was nearby. When Li Zhouwei entered, a physician stepped forward and bowed respectfully. "Congratulations, Your Highness! Lady Xu is one month pregnant."

The physician lifted his eyes slightly but heard no response. He only saw the gleaming jade boots standing motionless before him.

They say the moods of lords are hard to read... and indeed it’s true... thought the physician.

Sweat trickled down his forehead as the man before him finally spoke, "One month?"

Li Zhouwei’s tone turned cold. He had visited Xu Peiyu several times this month. As a cultivator, how could he not tell whether she was pregnant? He was starting to suspect this man’s medical skill was poor. His diagnosis was pure nonsense.

"My lord." Just then, Xu Peiyu hurried up to him. Li Zhouwei glanced at her belly, and his expression softened somewhat. He dismissed the sweating physician with a wave and carefully examined Peiyu’s complexion.

Sure enough, though she seemed spirited, there were dark circles under her eyes. Her essence qi was subtly waning, and her cheeks were much thinner than usual. Li Zhouwei said nothing and followed her into the hall.

Golden light flowed in his eyes as his expression grew darker. It’s been less than ten days... yet the child already shows signs of being a month along...

Xu Peiyu was still unaware, chattering on and pulling him to talk about this and that. Li Zhouwei responded calmly, trying to reassure her.

The woman stared keenly into his eyes and murmured, "I've often felt dizzy and sluggish these past few days. My whole body feels drained of blood and qi. I nearly fainted a few times... I might need stronger medicine..."

"I'll take care of it... let's first have an elder examine you," replied Li Zhouwei.

A sense of foreboding rose in Li Zhouwei’s heart. He scrutinized her once more, then slowly turned and strode out. He soared into the air, leaving her behind still waiting in the hall.

Only after Li Zhouwei vanished from sight did Xu Peiyu’s expression finally show traces of fear. She felt as though all her essence qi was draining into her womb. As she sat blankly in her seat, a faint dread rose in her heart.

Each time she had lain with Li Zhouwei, a fragrance like peonies would intoxicate her senses, nearly causing her to lose her mind. Only after he had been gone for some time would she slowly feel fear again. Yet the moment he returned to the hall, she would rush out to greet him, overjoyed.

His Highness is divine and mighty, capable of ensnaring hearts and souls. Those golden pupils... he doesn’t seem human, but more like some demonic creature...

How could a human bear the child of a demon? What logic is there in that? He might devour me without hesitation!

Truly like a demon...

Xu Peiyu dared not tell anyone. Even to her own family, she only said the pregnancy was good news. But now, her legs grew cold. It felt as if a great stone had settled in her womb. It was so heavy she could barely breathe.




# Chapter 791: Molten Fire Dao

Li Ximing secluded himself atop the peak for several months, comprehending the contents of the Radiant Essence Scripture. It contained a total of nine secret techniques that would be planted into his Immortal Foundation to nurture divine abilities.

At present, I have only managed to cultivate one... thought Li Ximing.

Once he cultivated the first secret technique, Bright Yang, a golden mark appeared on his Radiant Origin Pass, enhancing his mana circulation by half and slightly boosting his overall strength.

Though the nine secret techniques differed slightly, there was no fixed order; any of them could be cultivated first. Since Bright Yang could solidify his mana and was broadly useful, Li Ximing chose to cultivate it first.

While successfully cultivating a secret technique was a good thing, Li Ximing did not pause and immediately started on the second, but his expression soon turned grim.

When he tried to condense the second secret technique into his Immortal Foundation, it clashed with the first, Bright Yang, making the difficulty soar by a full fifty percent!

I thought it would take just over a century to complete all nine... but even centuries may not be enough.

His heart sank. He finally understood why so few reached the Purple Mansion Realm in the mighty Azure Pond Sect, and why cultivators like Li Encheng delayed their breakthroughs until the brink of death...

What's worse, as more secret techniques are cultivated, the repulsive forces will compound, making it nearly impossible to complete even one more! Then I’ll have to bet on a mere five or ten percent chance to break through...

He ceased his spell arts and rose from the jade throne within his cave dwelling, where the spiritual energy was the densest in his entire family. The throne, brought back from Mount Wu, was the finest cultivation artifact.

Its radiance illuminated his face, but made Li Ximing squint slightly. Time had flown like a snap of the fingers, and though he was nearing sixty, his face, lit by the luminous jade, still looked like that of a young man.

Li Ximing examined his train of thought twice before pulling out a jade slip. This jade slip contained nearly a hundred thousand words of insights he had gained while cultivating the Bright Yang secret technique. Li Ximing had initially been greatly ambitious and hoped to master seven or eight techniques, record each carefully, and compile them into a volume to leave behind even if he failed to break through...

But staring at the contents of the jade slip now, he could only mutter, "Reaching the Purple Mansion Realm is not the achievement of one generation. My family rose too late. After several generations of climbing, we’ve only now reached the starting point that the Xiao Family had long ago..."

Li Ximing needed no further thought to understand that countless secret technique cultivation experiences must have been compiled over the generations in the Azure Pond Sect’s Dark Floating Compliant Cloud Sutra and Lucid Marsh Profound Cave Sutra. Figures like Chi Wei, Chi Buzi, and the earlier Chi Family members had long documented all the crucial details.

Zhang Yun and Qing Jifang surely had similar resources. Xiao Chuting’s breakthrough into the Purple Mansion Realm was no accident. Xiao Xianyou must have schemed thoroughly and even acquired legacies from the Lingyu Gate to achieve success.

But time waits for no one! Now is the best opportunity...

Li Ximing was not blind to the situation. The Golden Core Realm cultivators of the Three Sects had yet to reappear. Whether the strife among them had ended was unknown, but all were likely wounded and would not show themselves. The Azure Pond Sect, in particular, had been drained by Chi Wei’s exploitation, resulting in five centuries without fresh talent.

It was even more rare that the Chi Family’s Purple Mansion Realm line was almost extinct, and Suiguan, neither fully human nor ghost, cared nothing for the family's interests. It was the perfect time to ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm, since such chances would vanish once the Three Sects recovered!

He did not believe himself as cunning as Xiao Chuting, who had seized a gap between sects to ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm, leveraging conflicts and sacrifices to force Azure Pond’s consent. Xiao Chuting had risen to become a leading figure among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, and Li Ximing thought himself not even a fraction as capable as that elder.

"Zhouwei is now only at the mid-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Though he is exceptionally talented, he is not like Chu Yi, a True Monarch reincarnated. It will take at least another twenty or thirty years for him to reach the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm... How much time will the great battle at Mount Bianyan leave us? By then, the situation may no longer be favorable...

"I once thought that with diligent cultivation and ignoring worldly matters, there would be at least a fifty percent chance of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. But now... unless I can obtain a Bright Yang spirit item, there is only a slight chance to fight for it.”

Li Ximing's gaze grew somber, his expression no longer reflecting the usual focus of cultivation. His posture and demeanor shifted, revealing a heavy sense of worry.

"If only I could refine some pills..."

He could be considered a master of alchemy. Although he focused mainly on cultivation and seldom refined pills for others, he had seen and studied many pill recipes, including numerous rare and wondrous formulas.

Li Ximing sat silently, gazing at a wooden slip for a while, until he heard knocking on the door of his cave dwelling. He rose as if waking from a dream when a servant came to report that Li Zhouwei requested an audience.

He stepped out of the cave and saw a youth in a black cloak standing solemnly before the hall. His tiger-like eyes were fierce and his presence imposing. Li Ximing could not help but admire him inwardly, My son should be grown by now. In my race against time for cultivation, I've only seen him three times in over a decade. I feared he has become a spoiled wastrel.

After hearing Li Zhouwei's report and asking a few more questions, Xu Peiyu was brought into the hall. Li Ximing examined the young woman carefully, sweeping her twice with his spiritual sense, and frowned. "Her vitality is severely damaged."

Having refined pills for many years under the tutelage of Xiao Yuansi, he was deeply knowledgeable in this field. After a thorough inspection, although he found nothing obviously wrong, he still took out two pills for Xu Peiyu to consume, which considerably improved her spirits.

"These Vitality Returning Powder and Clarity Settling Pills must be taken daily. Also, bring some spirit items from home so I can concoct a formula to treat her as if she were born with innate deficiencies."

When he saw the unease on Xu Peiyu's face as she timidly peeked at him, Li Ximing reassured her, "Our family possesses an abundance of spirit pills and medicines, rest assured, we can certainly safeguard both mother and child."

Li Ximing then dismissed Xu Peiyu with a wave, raising his brows as he looked at Li Zhouwei and said in a low voice, "I can't fully grasp the situation. We may need to consult Kongheng.

"Firstly, matters concerning unborn children fall more within the expertise of the devil and buddhist Daos. Kongheng has traveled extensively in the north and likely holds insights into such cases. Secondly... his temple once worshiped the Undefeated King of Brightness, who was part of the Bright Yang Dao Lineage. There are many records, and it's necessary to inquire further."

Li Zhouwei gave him a thoughtful glance and responded solemnly. Li Ximing continued his questioning, "Any other news from the family?"

Li Zhouwei naturally understood what Li Ximing was concerned about. He pulled a letter from his sleeve and replied, "A letter from the north, uncle. Please take a look."

Li Ximing took the letter, glanced over it briefly, and his eyes immediately lit up. He exclaimed, "Good, good, good... Finally, some news! Though difficult, it's far better than having no trace at all!"

This letter was naturally penned by Li Qinghong, who reported that the Radiant Sky Stone had fallen into the hands of Yu Fuzi of Changxiao Gate. Li Ximing was filled with immense joy.

Li Zhouwei had already read the letter earlier and now spoke in a low voice, "Indeed, the Radiant Sky Stone was obtained by Yu Fuzi in Dongning Palace. The spiritual energy in Xu State is chaotic and difficult to predict, making it hard even for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha to manipulate. It might actually be safer because of that."

Li Ximing nodded and saw golden light flickering in Zhouwei’s eyes as he continued, "With a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator stationed at Changxiao Gate, we cannot recklessly offend them. We might fall into a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's scheme. We can only rely on another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to secretly plot from within.

"Currently, Changxiao Gate and Hengzhu Dao Gate are locked in endless conflict. Their hatred runs deep. We could exploit this. Whether by allying with Hengzhu Dao Gate or trading with them, we must find an opportunity to obtain the treasure."

Li Ximing listened for a while and nodded. Zhouwei stood tall and said, "No matter what, we must first investigate Yu Fuzi, find out his cultivation and what treasures he possesses, as well as his temperament and preferences. As long as he is not hiding within his sect without stepping out, there will be an opportunity. The only problem is that our senior members are stationed guarding the northern borders and cannot act freely. Future movements will be hard to coordinate..."

After Zhouwei finished analyzing the situation, Li Ximing stroked his beard and nodded, dispatching people to investigate. Then he smiled at the younger man and said gently, "I've encountered a bottleneck in my cultivation recently and just emerged from seclusion. I thought about refining some pills, partly to enhance our cultivation, and partly to clear my thoughts. A change of pace might bring about a breakthrough."

Li Zhouwei asked, "Uncle, you mean..."

"I wonder if there are any Bright Yang-type demons in the Eastern Sea. We could capture one and use it in alchemy for supplementation..." said Li Ximing.

Li Zhouwei was slightly surprised and replied, "Such creatures are rare in the Eastern Sea, but I will investigate immediately. There may have been no news of them in recent years."

He gave Li Ximing a careful look, sensing that his uncle was somewhat different today. But an unaware Li Ximing simply nodded in agreement.

Li Zhouwei poured some tea and suddenly spoke, "Uncle, there is one more thing we might try."

Li Ximing looked at him in confusion, and Zhouwei continued softly, "Uncle, do you still remember the Aged Courtly Path Scripture?"

Of course, Li Ximing knew of it. The technique had once been cultivated by the Jiang Family. Its grade was unknown, but it was extremely powerful. Sadly, its Qi-gathering method had long become obsolete. Yet, the Yu Family’s ancestor Yu Yufeng had managed to master a preserved portion of it, earning great fame and the title White Jade Hand.

Though he had been gravely wounded for many years, Yu Yufeng had forced three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and a grand formation to work together just to slay him. His fall had marked the beginning of the Yu Family’s decline.

Seeing Li Ximing nod, Li Zhouwei straightened and said seriously, "It’s my suspicion that this technique most likely originated before Heaven's Change. It only failed later. Now that the True Jade has returned to its place, perhaps it can be tried again. If the Qi-gathering method works, our family will gain another Purple Mansion Realm technique!

"This is a high-grade technique, so it would be perfect to bestow upon the younger generation of the family!"

Thanks to the fortune of Mirage Mirror Heaven of the Green Pine Grotto Heaven, the Li Family's Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques now ranked among the best of all families. They boasted two fourth-grade Six Chapters Seeking Immortality manuals and the Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique, as well as the impressive fifth-grade Insights of Taihua.

However, when it came to Qi Cultivation Realm and Foundation Establishment Realm techniques, the family was less well-stocked. The fifth-grade Radiant Essence Scripture was vital and could not be handed out casually. Apart from the fourth-grade Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique, the rest of the manuals were only third-grade.

Li Ximing started to nod repeatedly. Matters of the family were already largely entrusted to this younger generation. Knowing Zhouwei wouldn’t mention this without reason, he asked, "What needs to be done?"

Li Zhouwei replied, "We need to collect Dust of the Court. A grand courtyard of pure white jade is required, preferably jade imbued with spiritual power, bathed in radiance, guarded by a thousand, and surrounded by ten thousand residents. Each year would yield a wisp and ten years to gather a portion."

Li Ximing’s eyelids dropped as he answered, "This would indeed exhaust our resources and burden the people... Where would we even find so much spirit jade? Though jade is flourishing now, assembling enough for a grand courtyard would require a whole small mountain’s worth..."

"In the end, I fear we will have to trouble you, uncle..." said Li Zhouwei.

Just as Zhouwei was about to speak, he suddenly sensed something and snapped his head westward. He saw a patch of fiery clouds about five thousand kilometers away, a vague crimson hue floating at the horizon like a rising star.

A brilliant light swept across the sky, dispersing distant clouds and leaving only the flickering bright hue on the far horizon. A solemn young voice emerged, "I, Tu Longjian of the Slaughter Jun Gate, have today achieved the Purple Mansion Realm and attained the Molten Fire divine ability! I shall rebuild the Slaughter Jun Immortal Gate at Kuijun Mountain! Three months hence, I will consolidate the Wu Kingdom and establish a county capital. Fellow cultivators are welcome to attend the ceremony!

"All cultivators of the Slaughter Kui Dao lineage are welcome at Kuijun Mountain to aid in the reconstruction of the sect!"

Although the voice had faded by the time it reached them, its vibrant and confident tone remained clear, with the fiery glow at the horizon pulsing in response to his words.

Tu Longjian has attained a divine ability... how magnificent...

Li Ximing suddenly lifted his head to look at the hazy Fire Virtue glow of Molten Fire at the horizon. Since Tu Longjian’s words could reach here, Kuijun Mountain must not be far from Moongaze Lake and was likely near Yue State.

His heart surged, and he said gravely, "It’s a rare instance of Molten Fire even within Yue State and the Eastern Sea... It will likely stand unparalleled across all Jiangnan. From now on, whenever Molten Fire is mentioned, everyone will think of the Slaughter Jun Gate."

Li Zhouwei found it rather interesting. The Li Family had once received teachings from the Slaughter Jun Gate; even the white ape had once refined medicine there. Traditionally, the Slaughter Jun Gate’s techniques leaned toward Yin and cold energies such as Cold Qi, Veiled Yin, and Lesser Yin types of cultivation.

But now, rising from decline, Tu Longjian had acquired the Six Ding Merging Fire Token, transforming the gate into one associated with Molten Fire and Merging Fire instead.

We must send someone to offer congratulations!

Li Ximing’s expression lit up with joy. After all, Tu Longjian had formed ties with the Li Family as early as his Foundation Establishment Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm days, and he greatly respected Li Yuanjiao. He was, without doubt, a natural ally.

Li Zhouwei only allowed An Siwei to step forward. Li Ximing hurriedly said, "Go to the treasury and pick out a few precious spirit items... Ah, for a Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough, especially with such a close Daoist Master, we ought to send treasured panaceas! What else do we have in the treasury?"

"Uncle, please wait a moment." Li Ximing had barely finished speaking when Li Zhouwei stopped him, his heir's golden eyes glinting with a trace of a smile as he said, "In my opinion, whether or not we send lavish gifts, we should definitely have the white ape deliver them personally."

Li Ximing was momentarily stunned upon hearing this, but then immediately understood, his face blooming into a broad smile as he said, "Exactly! Exactly! You’ve thought of everything. Having the white ape deliver congratulations would be perfect. If the Daoist Master recognizes the white ape, it would be even better... Without you, I would have nearly made a blunder!"

Li Zhouwei had heard the white ape mention this person long ago and knew that the white ape was acquainted with Tu Longjian. Hence, he had carefully made this suggestion.

He flicked his black cloak, cupped his fists in return, and said with a nod, "I will arrange it immediately."

Li Zhouwei rode the wind and immediately departed. Li Ximing sat quietly in his cave dwelling for a while, pondering inwardly, Yu Fuzi, the Bright Yang demonic creatures, and Spirit Jade Mountain... It's a pity the timing is off, otherwise going out to the Eastern Sea to gather information would have been most convenient.

He took out his pill furnace, thinking to himself, Xijun’s injuries will take a long time to heal. Once the white ape returns from delivering congratulations, I’ll send him out... That old demon is still the most reliable.




# Chapter 793: Shock

Baixiang Valley.

Tuoba Chongyuan had broken through Baixiang Valley more than half a year ago, and the surrounding regions like Qun Yuan Mountain and Nu Mountain had been plundered clean. Vast swathes had been transformed into devil cultivators' ravaged lands.

Tang Shedu was by no means incompetent. When Tuoba Chongyuan died, he received orders to march into the mountains, splitting the devil lands in two. It only took him two hours to fight his way back to Baixiang Valley.

The famed Changtian Halberd had not been used for years, but once it was unleashed, it instantly slew over ten devil cultivators. Wherever the halberd struck, death and soul annihilation followed, with no chance for escape.
𝘧𝓇𝑒𝑒𝑤ℯ𝑏𝓃𝘰𝑣ℯ𝘭.𝘤ℴ𝘮

Clad in radiant white armor and dripping with the blood of devil cultivators, he stood his ground, planting his halberd with overwhelming might. He felt immensely pleased with himself.

"Where is Li Xizhi..." Tang Shedu glanced at the jade slip and casually muttered, "The agreed time was within three days, yet there's no sign of him?"

Tang Shedu had only just fought his way into Baixiang Valley, and it was already the last day of the three-day deadline of the rather forced arrangement. He needed no deep thought to guess it must have been orchestrated by Chi Liangzhe and others of the Chi Family.

Although he feared Li Xuanfeng somewhat and wouldn't deliberately target the Li Family, he also wouldn't show mercy. Since Chi Liangzhe had handed him leverage, Tang Shedu naturally had his own plan.

He muttered, "If he still hasn't arrived, just note it down and send it to the main hall."

He wasn't foolish enough to play the villain himself; it was better to let the Chi and Li Families deepen their hatred. After confirming twice, a person below replied, "The Daoist arrived an hour ago and will soon pay respects to you, my lord."

Tang Shedu, still basking in the sight of fleeing devil cultivators, looked up at a sky full of fiery red clouds to the south, and grew suspicious.

He was still thinking when he saw a man in white robes approaching him. The man was composed and elegant, carrying a deep blue fan at his waist and a sword on the other side.

His complexion was slightly pale but he spoke calmly, "Greetings, senior."

Tang Shedu glanced sidelong at him, but did not question him. Instead, he turned to another subordinate, asking, "What's happening in the south?"

The subordinate answered in a low voice, "A cultivator has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm and became a Daoist Master."

"Oh?" Tang Shedu froze for a moment, but then the calm Li Xizhi spoke, his tone slightly cold yet flawless, "Reporting to you, my lord, the cultivator in question is the Daoist Master Tu Longjian of the Slaughter Jun Gate, who has achieved the Molten Fire divine ability."

Tang Shedu's figure stiffened. He stood frozen for two seconds, his voice trembling as he asked, "Tu Longjian?"

"Exactly!" Li Xizhi's cold words struck Tang Shedu's heart. He slowly turned to meet Li Xizhi's calm gaze, and his heart trembled in shock, "Tu Longjian... Tu Longjian! How could it be so fast?! How could it be so fast?!"

A shiver ran from his head to his toes. As he stared at Li Xizhi, a sudden familiarity surged up. He pictured a pair of cold, ruthless eyes, and his heart grew colder, That's right... he is the direct son of Li Yuanjiao... Tu Longjian! And Tu Longjian... killed that ruthless man... and nearly severed my own path!

How should I conduct myself now? What else can I do?

Tang Shedu had once battled fiercely with Tu Longjian. He had even mocked him openly and killed Li Yuanjiao by force. Now, when he recalled that youth’s cold gaze, he felt a chill deep in his bones.

Tang Shedu had long known the secrets of the Green Pine Temple’s Mirage Mirror Heaven. He knew that no matter how high people like Tu Longjian seemed to soar back then, they would ultimately perish, thus he had dared to offend them deeply.

Who could have expected that Tu Longjian would still manage to escape with so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators overseeing the great void! It was utterly absurd!

Tang Shedu didn’t know whether there had been some scheme among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators or if Tu Longjian had some powerful backer. He only understood that he had suddenly become expendable, and ice filled his heart.

There was no need for him to turn or use spiritual sense, he could perfectly imagine the look on Li Xizhi’s face behind him. Tang Shedu cursed inwardly, I really let my anger get the better of me when I avenged Yu Muxian... and now I've ended up in this miserable state!

Tang Shedu slowly calmed himself and quickly began planning, I must find a Purple Mansion Realm backer, or else I'll open my eyes one day and Molten Fire will already be burning at my chest!

Tang Shedu’s expression was dark as Li Xizhi watched him silently from behind. He was masking his inner turmoil, though inwardly he was overwhelmed by surging emotions.

This was the first time he had seen Tang Shedu. The memory of Li Yuanjiao dying under this man’s halberd had been etched deeply into his mind. Though he had never shown it outwardly, his hatred for Tang Shedu burned fiercely.

For now, I must bide my time... This man is not easy to deal with, and I mustn't ruin greater matters. But since he might deduce something, I must be on guard against him striking first!

The two guarded against each other. They showed no changes on the surface nor exchanged any words, yet they were both silently calculating the other's intentions.

————

Kuijun Mountain.

Kuijun Mountain lay at the junction between Wu and Yue States. Tongmo Prefecture, held by the Chen Family of Yuyang, lay to the north. Beyond that rose the southern foothills of Mount Dali, and it was only about five thousand kilometers from Moongaze Lake.

This area bordered the southern territories of the demonic creatures. Countless large and small demonic temples and shamanic kingdoms dotted the land further south, paying tribute to the demonic clans and serving as pasture grounds for great demonic beasts.

Kuijun Mountain had once been the stronghold of the Slaughter Jun Gate. It was originally treacherous, remote, and desolate terrain that was covered in cold iron and frigid stones, linking the shamanic kingdoms between Wu and Yue.

Now, the mountains were shrouded in hazy red mist, that glowed and drifted between the ridges. The once frigid stones had transformed into a blazing crimson, sparking showers of fire. From afar, the entire mountain range seemed wrapped in a luminous, fiery glow.

"The cultivators of the shamanic kingdoms congratulate the Daoist Master!"

Beams of dharma light soared from the red mist, halting respectfully before the mountain, filled with awe at the crimson fog. After waiting a long while, a fiery wind finally swept down from the mountain's peak.

The wind coalesced and spiraled until it formed a man in black robes. He was flanked by roaring gray-red and hazy flames that intertwined into waves of scorching winds.

He stood before the mountain and spoke loudly, "Tu Longjian greets you all!"

As soon as his voice rang out, the cultivators were struck with terror, all falling to their knees as they cried out in fear, "Daoist Master, you humble us! We dare not accept such a title!"

This Daoist Master was, of course, Tu Longjian. Despite many hardships and the destruction of his gate in his youth, he retained a youthful spirit, always addressing fellow cultivators as equals, regardless of their cultivation level.

When he was still at the Foundation Establishment Realm, Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators had merely felt uneasy at his courtesy. Now that he was a Daoist Master, none dared let him address them as peers. Pure fear filled their hearts.

The black-clad Tu Longjian gazed at the group of cultivators and said softly, "I am here to rebuild the Slaughter Jun Gate. When the devil plague swept through, our disciples fled and scattered, and their whereabouts are now unknown.

"If you encounter any Slaughter Jun Gate’s disciples or those of our Dao lineage elsewhere, please guide them back to the gate. I will surely repay your kindness!"

The crowd timidly agreed. Tu Longjian nodded and turned to head back into the mountain, leaving the cultivators dumbfounded. No one had expected that he would neither demand tribute nor speak of power consolidation. He had only made a strange request before departing.

Some among them wished to pledge allegiance to him, but none dared step into the red mist. After exchanging uneasy glances, they finally scattered like the wind.

Barely a few seconds later, a bright light appeared before the mountains and a Daoist Master manifested in the sky. It was a man with a kind, gentle appearance and willow-leaf eyes, though his voice was deep and weighty as he said, "I am Changxiao. May Fellow Daoist Tu Longjian reveal himself."

Before he was even finished, another figure appeared in the sky before the mountain. It was a woman in a simple, ancient daoist robe, holding a parasol.

She glanced coldly at Daoist Master Changxiao but then said softly, "Bi Hengxing of Hengzhu Dao Gate congratulates the Daoist Master on achieving divine ability!"




# Chapter 794: Visitation And Gift

Both Daoist Masters revealed themselves at the same time. Daoist Master Changxiao glanced at Daoist Master Hengxing with a faintly amused smile.

Tu Longjian emerged from the red mist and looked up at the two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the sky.

He was neither humble nor arrogant as he said loudly, “I am Tu Longjian, courtesy name Junjian, and I have cultivated the Molten Fire divine ability. Greetings to the two esteemed seniors.”

Daoist Master Changxiao, with his willow-leaf eyebrows and deep cultivation, seemed rather kindly disposed toward Tu Longjian. He had both hands clasped behind his back and spoke mildly, “So it is Daoist Master Junjian. To have attained the Purple Mansion Realm at such a young age, your talent is truly extraordinary. We are deeply impressed.”

Though he spoke politely, Daoist Master Changxiao himself was not very old. Known for his skill and decisiveness, he was one of the fastest cultivators to ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm.

Standing to the side, Daoist Master Hengxing was displeased by Changxiao’s words and looked coldly at him, making her stance clear.

It was only when she turned to Tu Longjian that her demeanor softened. She spoke in a gentle voice, “Congratulations, Daoist Master Junjian. I am Daoist Master Hengxing of Hengzhu Dao Gate. Our two sects lie just across the mountains from each other; let us stay in close contact going forward.”

Daoist Master Changxiao did not show overt hostility toward Hengxing, but he remained silent with his hands behind his back while the latter spoke. Tu Longjian could see that the relationship between the two was strained, so he refrained from siding with either party and simply replied, “I have long heard of both your great names and should have come to pay my respects sooner. However, I have only just made my breakthrough and still have much to comprehend regarding my divine abilities, so I remained in the mountains.”

Both Purple Mansion Realm cultivators caught the underlying meaning of his words. Changxiao merely smiled without speaking, while Hengxing nodded and said, “Since you’ve just entered the Purple Mansion Realm, you should take your time to understand your divine abilities. When you’re free, Daoist Master Junjian, you might consider heading north along the great void to visit Mount Bianyan.”

Though Tu Longjian had never left the mountain, he was not ignorant of the world. He had heard that Mount Bianyan was a battleground between immortal and demonic cultivators, with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators clashing against Maha.

He had long wished to contribute in some way, so he replied solemnly, “Understood.”

His words caused subtle changes in the two Daoist Masters’ expressions. Hengxing nodded in farewell and vanished, and Daoist Master Changxiao spoke again, “Daoist Junjian, you and I share a bit of fate after both escaping from the gameboard. I am a few years your senior, so allow me to offer you a word of advice.”

Tu Longjian remained calm, his expression unchanged by the words. He responded clearly, “Senior, please enlighten me.”

Changxiao looked at him quietly. “Fellow Daoist, whatever you seized along the way, or whose favor you received, none of that matters now. After stepping into the Purple Mansion Realm, the gains and losses of earlier moves on the chessboard are no longer important. But there are still a few items that must be accounted for.

“First is the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact. Ordinary ones are of no concern. But the Six Ding Merging Fire Token is a great treasure, and the Guo Family will not compromise on that.”

Tu Longjian nodded slightly, as if he had anticipated this, and offered a word of thanks. Changxiao’s willow-leaf eyes stayed fixed on him as clear mist drifted off his robe.

He spoke softly, “The jade box from Green Pine Temple is missing two items. You know where they are, don’t you?”

Tu Longjian’s eyes flickered slightly, but Changxiao continued calmly, “One is the Taiqing, and the other is the Taixu. By now, you surely understand the value of these two items. Azure Pond Sect couldn’t spare the resources in the past, and Zipei believed the opportunity was limited, so they refused to act.

“However, now that you’ve stepped into the spotlight, you must either return them and curry favor with one of the sects, or act as if you never heard anything, refuse to return them, and seek your own path.”

Tu Longjian listened to his words carefully and replied, “Thank you for your guidance, Senior.”

Changxiao gazed at him quietly and said softly, “There are many paths. Guo Shentong and I once chose different ones. Now we are enemies. Fellow Daoist, tread your own path wisely.”

When he was done speaking, he gradually faded away. In the distance, several figures appeared one by one. Among the figures were a golden-robed woman with a radiant smile, a stern old man with a rigid demeanor, a sinister-looking man, and a female immortal gently stroking her sword.

The representative from Azure Pond Sect was Daoist Yuan Xiu, who bowed to him meticulously. He seemed completely unconcerned by Changxiao’s earlier remarks. After a few polite words, he took his leave.

The rest were from Golden Feather Sect, Purple Smoke Gate, Profound Peak Gate... most of the three sects and seven gates had arrived, all speaking with reasonable courtesy. Only Snow Ji Gate and Yue Cultivating Sect were absent.

Snow Ji Gate has sealed its mountain for nearly two hundred years, so their absence is understandable... As for Yue Cultivating Sect, they too have shut their gates. The few Purple Mansion Realm immortal families under their jurisdiction are busy with their own troubles, so it’s unlikely they could spare the time to come.

Neither of the two Purple Mansion Realm immortal families of Yue State showed up; perhaps their Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were away from home. Tu Longjian stood there for a moment longer, and seeing no further appearances, finally descended back into the red mist.

The cave dwelling within the mountain was entirely red, with even the tables and chairs tinted crimson. It was spacious, with several luminous spell-pearls embedded in the ceiling.

Tu Longjian entered, drew a black-and-red command token from his sleeve, and spoke to it, “Senior, did you hear all that?”

The command token flickered twice, releasing several strands of gray flame that circled in the air twice before returning to the token. Tu Longjian pressed two fingers together and placed them to his lips, fingertips facing inward just level with his nose. A faint light shimmered in his eyes, and a stream of gray wind rose between his fingers.

He gave a soft command, “Unruly Molten Fire, take human form!”

The gray wind swirled once through the cave, swept up the Six Ding Merging Fire Token, and upon landing, transformed into a gray-robed man. His eye sockets were deep, his cheeks were sunken, and his figure was small and lean.

Once he stood firmly on the ground, he took a deep breath and exclaimed joyfully, “Nothing beats being human!”

“Senior Guo.” Tu Longjian was in no mood for chatter. He gave him a heavy look and asked in a low voice, “Is there still anything you’re hiding from me?”

The gray-robed man plopped down casually into a seat, took a large gulp of tea, and chuckled, “You’ve probably guessed most of it! Even with fate on your side, you wouldn’t have made it this far so smoothly without help from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.”
𝚏𝕣𝐞𝗲𝐰𝕖𝐛𝐧𝕠𝕧𝚎𝚕.𝐜𝚘𝗺

Tu Longjian silently stared at him. The gray-robed man shrugged and said, “Changxiao tried to hint at it, but I’ll tell you straight, it was Crimson Reef Island!”

Tu Longjian’s expression darkened bit by bit as he growled, “So... the Six Ding Merging Fire Token was deliberately delivered to me by Guo Hongyao... and all your promises and schemes, Guo Er, were at the will of Guo Shentong. Embedding your soul into the token was also a way to plot against me.”

Guo Er burst into laughter as he replied, “Nonsense! Guo Shentong hasn’t been seen in years; he could be dead in some forgotten corner! Crimson Reef Island says his soul lamp still burns bright with no signs of weakening, but who knows if that’s even his soul lamp?

“As for Guo Hongyao? She doesn’t even have half an ounce of cunning. She wouldn't know intentional from unintentional. She’s just another pawn sacrificed in factional strife!

“The East and West Reefs of Crimson Reef Island are constantly at odds. By letting this spirit artifact fall into your hands, clearly one faction hopes for my return to unify them. As for which one? I haven’t the slightest clue!”

Tu Longjian remained silent, but Guo Er continued, “Their calculations were precise, either I seize your body, or gain a powerful ally through gratitude. There’s no downside for them.”

The gray-robed man took several more sips of tea, delightedly savoring its taste, and said cheerfully, “Tu Longjian, I truly mean you no harm. Once I’ve formed a real body and unified Crimson Reef Island, what problem couldn’t the two of us solve together?”

Tongmo Prefecture.

Li Chengliao stood atop drifting clouds, his feet treading on shimmering currents of air. The white ape, now transformed into an old man, silently rode the cloud beside him.

When news of Tu Longjian breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm reached them, the Li Family had deliberated carefully. Given the current instability of the area, Li Ximing was not suited to make an appearance, and Li Zhouwei had yet to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. It seemed more proper for the family head, Li Chengliao, to go instead.

Moreover, Li Chengliao had grown up within the family and had never seen the outside world. He had spent his days in secluded cultivation. Now, since there was nothing urgent at hand, he was quite pleased to venture out. He was looking forward to the experience.

The Yuyang’s Chen Family of Tongmo Prefecture was below his feet. It had many mortals, and was vibrant with life. Having governed his own household for many years, Li Chengliao nodded in approval at the orderly buildings and well-kept courtyards.

The Chen Family was also a renowned great family. Setting aside the Yuyang’s Chen Family, Lingyu Gate had once borne the same surname. However, the two had different origins. The Yuyang branch had lived here for generations, while the founder of Lingyu Gate had seemingly migrated from Ning State.

It was the same with the Li Family. Rumor had it there was another Li Family in Wu State that had lived there for generations, while the Moongaze Li Family was thought to be a remnant lineage from the North.

However, the Chen Family’s position was far better than that of the Li Family. As long-established locals, they had kin in nearly every sect. Though they had only one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, they maintained good relations with all major factions.

Seeing Li Chengliao lost in thought, the white ape who rarely spoke, said a few words, “Patriarch, the Chen Family from Lijing within our household has excellent blood. They must be related to these two Chen branches.”

Li Chengliao naturally understood. He had been deeply impressed by Chen Yang’s innate talent and simply replied, “We can look into it when the chance arises. But I’ve heard those secret techniques are linked to the Purple Mansion Realm, so it is not likely to be easy to uncover.”

The two soon crossed out of Yue State as they conversed. The mountains grew treacherous and were now often shrouded in miasma. The forests became tall and shadowy, with demonic qi rising skyward from time to time, accompanied by roars and howls.

Kuijun Mountain lay on the southern border. Though neither the man nor the beast had visited before, they recognized it at a glance.

It was unmistakable. Kuijun Mountain glowed crimson amid the encircling green miasma, sending red light soaring skyward. The phenomenon from a Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough had yet to fully dissipate. Deep in the night, the mountaintop was clear of clouds, but it was surrounded by a distant haze of crimson mist, with cultivators flying in and out in great numbers. It was an exceptionally lively scene.

The two cultivators halted at the foot of the mountain, where a proper gate had already been erected. They stood before it in a disciplined manner, and were promptly invited to ascend.

As they walked up the path, everything was orderly and clearly organized by function. Though the cave dwellings were somewhat crude, the effort put into them was evident. Li Chengliao was slightly surprised and thought to himself, Remarkable.

Though Tu Longjian was a solitary figure, it was clear that he had formed deep bonds and gathered many trusted subordinates. He clearly had enough people to support the structure of an entire gate.

While Li Chengliao observed the organization of the Slaughter Jun Gate cultivators, the white ape looked on with a far more complex expression. He silently watched the cultivators rush about amid this illusion of order.

Li Chengliao handed the jade box in his hand to the approaching cultivator and said softly, “The Qingdu Li Family presents the Tai Fire Longfruit to congratulate the Daoist Master on attaining the Purple Mansion Realm!”

As he spoke, he gently brushed the surface of the jade box. Its pristine white surface slowly grew transparent, revealing the item within. A slender fruit was wreathed in flickering flame, glowing with a hazy brilliance. Intense fire energy danced within the box; it was indeed a rare and treasured panacea.

This item had been obtained years ago from the Yu Family treasury. The Purple Lian Bodhi had already been given to Kongheng, the wide-eyed monk who had gratefully accepted it. The Tai Fire Longfruit was a treasure of Fire Virtue, most likely even born of Molten Fire, which made it the perfect gift.

Such a valuable and well-chosen gift earned approving glances from Tu Longjian’s welcoming subordinates. They took careful note of it before respectfully withdrawing.

The white ape opened the cave dwelling’s door and announced in a gravelly voice, “Family head, make ready. Once your name is reported, the Daoist Master will certainly come to meet you.”

Li Chengliao nodded and took a seat, but inwardly he was still conflicted, It’s said the Daoist Master was close to uncle, but we already requested his help at Green Pine Temple. It cost us a great deal of goodwill. That elder is now gone... and the Daoist Master has no ties to the others in our family.

Hatred lasts a century, but favors are thin as paper... Our ancestor has passed on. Though some ties may remain, if we seek this Daoist Master’s help again, even the last remnants of connection may fade.

Li Tongya’s death had severely damaged the ties between the Li and Xiao Families. Everyone in the Li Family had seen this clearly. After Xiao Guiluan’s fall, things had only worsened by the day. How could Li Chengliao not weigh this in his heart?

After waiting for about fifteen minutes, there came two gentle knocks at the door of the cave dwelling, followed by hearty laughter. A man in black appeared.

“Is this a visit from the Li Family?”

A black-robed youth with a hearty smile and a crisp, well-fitted outfit emerged before Li Chengliao. Deep crimson patterns adorned his cuffs as he strode confidently into the cave dwelling.

“Junior greets the Daoist Master!”

Tu Longjian had a youthful appearance, with a plain and ordinary look. Only a faint haze at the center of his brows hinted at something unusual about him. He was cordial and easygoing, perhaps due to his newly acquired divine ability, without the aloofness typical of most Purple Mansion cultivators.

But in the end, he was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. The moment he stepped into the cave, a stifling heat and subtle suffocation swept through the space. His oppressive pressure instantly filled the room.

Li Chengliao stepped forward to bow, but before he could complete the motion, Tu Longjian helped him up. Feeling slightly reassured, he saw the young man smile and say, “Your family truly went to great lengths. The Tai Fire Longfruit is quite rare these days. This gift is far too generous.”

Tu Longjian knew something about the Li Family’s situation. Though it had improved from years past, offering up such a treasured panacea was no easy matter. His tone carried a faint sigh as he continued, “A small token would have sufficed...”
𝒻𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝘮

With no gesture from him, the cave door closed. The young cultivator took a seat and said softly, “Since our parting at Green Pine, I’ve been fleeing west and hiding east, entering seclusion everywhere to seek a breakthrough. I haven’t yet visited your family to pay respects to the elder. That was my failing...”

No matter how courteous Tu Longjian was, Li Chengliao did not dare sit. He simply poured tea for his senior.

Seeing this, Tu Longjian didn’t insist, and instead spoke in a low voice, “Regarding Yu Muxian of Green Pine Temple, did Azure Pond Sect give your family any trouble?”

He lifted his gaze slightly, seemingly lost in thought, as a chill crept into his expression. He asked, “It can’t be that Tang Shedu is still stirring up trouble behind the scenes and holding a grudge against your family, can it?”




# Chapter 796: One Side

“Reporting to the Daoist Master... After the incident at Green Pine Temple, Yuanwu hastily perished. That villain could barely manage his own affairs and had no opportunity to trouble our family...”

Li Chengliao answered respectfully. Tu Longjian nodded slightly, resting one hand on the table as he spoke, “Yuanwu was rash and venomous. He certainly suffered before his death. Yuanwu Peak has always been a mess; his temperament was such that even his own people feared him.”

Li Chengliao noticed that Tu Longjian seemed surprisingly familiar with Yuanwu, and even with the Tang and Yu Families, causing his heart to stir slightly. But Tu Longjian had already sunk into deep thought, Back then, Guo Er, Yu Xiuxian, Zhang Lingshu, Cheng Mianfu, and Zhang Cuotian entered Mirage Mirror Heaven together. Disputes arose midway, causing most of them to perish, with only a few managing to escape...

Guo Er claimed Yuanwu forced him into hiding. Since he was gravely wounded and near death, he had no choice but to refine himself into the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. He had fallen into slumber and was carried out by Zhang Lingshu... But how exactly did Zhang Lingshu die...

He said that before he entered Chongming Hall, there was another cushion beside the steps outside the hall, with a jade box atop it, that had been taken by Zhang Cuotian. Now it’s lost and missing.

And where did the jade stone Zhang Lingshu took end up? When Cheng Mianfu died, who took his spirit sword...

Though Tu Longjian treated his friends with great kindness, he was not without vigilance. His mind flashed with sharp thoughts, though on the surface he merely sipped his tea. His gaze paused briefly on the white ape, and his train of thought abruptly cut off.

“This one is...” Tu Longjian’s pupils turned slightly red as he activated his Purple Mansion Realm divine ability. Memories surged to the surface, and he suddenly stood up, asking, “Have you once come to this mountain?”

The white ape neither humbled himself nor showed arrogance. He bowed and said, “This old ape had the fortune to pound medicine here for over a decade, and has indeed seen the Daoist Master before.”

“So it is true!” exclaimed Tu Longjian.

The white ape looked entirely different from his past self, but his aura was faintly similar. Tu Longjian used his divine sense to compare the one before him to his memories. He felt a ripple of emotion and said deeply, “So you’ve had quite the fortune... You’ve even reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, and with True Qi at that... Why don’t you tell me about it?”

The white ape bowed deeply and said solemnly, “Reporting to the Daoist Master, after the gate was broken, this white ape was captured by the Yu Family, shackled with cold iron collars and flogged with iron whips. I encountered a demonic disaster in the marketplace, but I was fortunately rescued by my current master and have been under his protection ever since.”

Tu Longjian lowered his brows, his voice slightly hoarse as he said, “When the devil cultivators attacked the gate, the gate master escorted me along the hidden path, then turned back on his own.

“I had intended to return and check on things, but I was discovered and pursued by devil cultivators. I barely escaped five hundred kilometers away and managed to kill the pursuer by sheer luck... but I do not know what became of the gate afterward.”

The white ape’s voice was deep as he replied, “The gate master fought three enemies alone and was forcibly refined alive. The junior uncle had his head severed at the foot of the mountain... As demonic smoke billowed, the devil cultivators even used his head to devour the senior brother. Very soon, all our cultivators perished.

“I managed to escort the second young lady a few kilometers away, but my mana failed midair. We fell from the sky. I shattered half my body, and the second young lady also perished.

“I lay in the mud for a long time. Fortunately, since the devil cultivators were rampaging and scattering the demon beasts, no demonic creature came to eat me. I clawed my way out with my hands, drank a few mouthfuls of muddy water, and dug a cave to survive by sheer luck.”

Tu Longjian remained silent for more than a dozen breaths. When he spoke again, his voice was choked, “What about my father?”

At this point, the white ape’s voice could no longer remain steady, as a hoarseness crept in, “The guardian’s body was tough and well-liked by the devil cultivators. They carried him across the mountains while he was still alive. As I lay dying below, I heard the devil cultivators laughing and drinking as they divided up his flesh... Their voices only disappeared once they reached the horizon.”

Tu Longjian closed his eyes. Li Chengliao felt his heart pounding wildly and the soles of his feet burning. Blood rushed to his head, and a hazy brilliance flickered twice in the Daoist Master’s palm before extinguishing.

Sensing his discomfort, Tu Longjian forced the abnormal phenomena to fade away. Only after a full fifteen minutes did Tu Longjian open his eyes and speak softly, “I understand. You’ll come with me into the mountains. Point out each place; you and I will use divine methods to see if we can find any remains.”

The white ape glanced at Li Chengliao, who nodded his consent. Only then did he follow Tu Longjian out. The young Daoist Master left behind only a single instruction, “Chengliao, wait here. Soon, someone will invite you up to the mountain feast.”

Li Chengliao saw them off. Only then did the sweat pouring down his face begin to subside. When he looked down, he saw the bluestone beneath him flickering faintly with red light.

Molten Fire and Valley Water... They are already extremely rare today... Their power is daunting, especially in the hands of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

He would have liked to remain inside the cave dwelling, but the heat was unbearable, since it even forced his mana to evaporate and scatter. Unable to endure it, he stepped outside in just two strides and patiently waited before the stone gate.

Li Chengliao paused for a moment, and sure enough, someone rode the wind down, showing great respect as he said politely, “The banquet on the mountain has been prepared. Fellow Daoist, please proceed to take your seat.”

Li Chengliao naturally understood that Foundation Establishment Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators had to take their seats early at grand occasions like this. They would often wait three to four hours before the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators made their appearance.

The current situation is unusual. There will likely be fewer Purple Mansion guests this time.

As he pondered silently, he saw a group descend through the wind ahead of him. They all wore brilliant green dharma robes and dazzling white jade crowns, while carrying extraordinary dharma artifacts.

“Immortal envoys from Azure Pond Sect... Presenting treasured panaceas and spirit artifacts... To congratulate the Daoist Master...”

When he heard the announcements ahead, Li Chengliao realized these were cultivators from Azure Pond Sect. Each was youthful and spirited, and spoke elegantly. Their graceful leader was likely someone from the Chi Family.

Li Chengliao did not rush to take his seat but quietly observed from a corner. As the leader sat down and eagerly spoke with a boy beside him, Li Chengliao’s gaze was instantly drawn to the youth to the Chi Family member’s left.

The youth exuded a wild, unruly air, with one hand resting on the table and one foot propped on the nearby seat’s cushion. His expression was careless, his eyebrows sharp and long, and his eyes slightly narrow. If he were to look serious, he would appear quite fierce.

He found the youth’s face vaguely familiar, so Li Chengliao feigned looking for a seat and walked past their table, catching the Chi Family member’s laughter, “Yuanqin! Your cultivation has made great progress these past few days! Truly worthy of being the son of the Immortal Bow!”

The words floated softly into Li Chengliao’s ears, and he immediately reacted, his heart surging with both joy and shock, It’s him...

The careless youth scanned the seats, as if searching for something, and casually said, “The old man refuses to teach me real skills, so what’s the point? Brother Fubo, we might as well talk of other things... Chi Fuju has gone to the northern cave dwelling ruins, and here we are, stuck eating and drinking...”

His words made Li Chengliao’s heart sink. Chi Fubo’s expression instantly darkened as he set down his jade cup, his voice lowering, “You’re right, Yuanqin... But even now, the main branch holds nine peaks among the thirty-six... It won’t be easy to surpass him. I tried the plan we discussed, but my uncle does harbor some doubts about him...

Afraid of being discovered, Li Chengliao quickly moved away. A white mist gradually descended on the banquet, muffling all conversation. Only once he reached the far end did he cautiously look back.

He saw the white mist slowly enveloping everything. He accidentally locked eyes with the youth’s arrogant, venomous gaze through a gap in the clouds. The carefree youth was idly stirring a few spirit fruits with a pair of jade chopsticks.

Li Chengliao’s heart skipped a beat. Fortunately, the youth didn’t seem to notice him; he was merely lost in thought, his lips moving slightly, his expression sharp, before soon looking away.

As the mist thickened, Li Chengliao moved toward the banquet seats. That piercing gaze was still vivid in his mind, leaving a chaotic mix of emotions in his heart.

Li Xuanfeng had just exited seclusion. As he sipped a cup of tea in the grand hall, Ning Heyuan hurriedly approached.

Ning Heyuan drew close, but was startled by the sight of the middle-aged man before him. It took him a careful look to realize it was Li Xuanfeng. When he took in the sharp brows, fierce aura, and the faint platinum radiance emanating from the latter’s body, he quickly congratulated him, “Congratulations, brother-in-law, on your great advancement in strength! It’s as if you’ve regained your youth!”

Li Xuanfeng was still unaccustomed to his current appearance. He lowered his brows slightly, but even with no expression, his face exuded a vibrant and fierce spirit. He replied, “No need for courtesy... How long have I been in seclusion? Has anything happened?”

“Less than half a year!” Ning Heyuan quickly said quietly, “Tang Shedu seized the opportunity after Tuoba Chongyuan’s death to launch a surprise attack on Baixiang Valley, reclaiming most of the lost territory and even pushing in a few kilometers further north. Afterwards, fierce battles broke out with both north and south suffering losses, but there have been no major changes since.

“However, over the past few months, the devil cultivators have suffered repeated setbacks, losing many cultivators... Several cave dwelling ruins have also fallen from the sky. Two of them are quite large, covering fifty kilometers each, and have drawn many to fight for their opportunities.”

Li Xuanfeng nodded lightly. From the way Ning Heyuan had rushed over, he guessed that there was likely something important waiting to be said.

Sure enough, after just seconds, Ning Heyuan said in a serious tone, “Brother-in-law, the devil cultivators, specifically the Murong Family, have had two new arrivals. Their cultivation is said to be formidable. It’s likely that the devil cultivators will push south again within the next two months. Chi Zhiyan has asked me several times about you; he may be plotting something.”

Li Xuanfeng was in no hurry. Instead, he changed the subject and asked, “How goes the reforging of the spirit armor?”

Ning Heyuan suddenly realized and answered, “Of course, it’s ready! I’ll have someone bring it to you right away!”

After giving a few instructions, Ning Heyuan turned back and said, “Brother-in-law, in the past half year, Jiangnan has gained two new Daoist Masters...”

Ning Heyuan described them both. Tu Longjian naturally needed no introduction, while the other was an immortal cultivator from Wu State’s Ni Family, who had attained the Purple Mansion Realm. Since they were located on the far western edge of Wu State, near the Great Western Plains, there had been little commotion about it.

“With Tu Longjian’s breakthrough... certain people surely aren’t sleeping easy anymore!” said Li Xuanfeng.

A faint smile broke through Li Xuanfeng’s somber expression. After all, this was rare good news for the Li Family. Gaining another allied Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could save several lives and help avoid many future humiliations.

“Reporting to the Daoist, my lord summons you!”

Members of the Chi Family arrived swiftly just as he finished speaking. Before their words had even faded away, two men approached, carrying a suit of platinum-colored armor that shone brilliantly with a faint layer of whitish glow.

Though the armor had yet to be named, Li Xuanfeng had specifically instructed that many Bright Yang treasures be used in its forging, most of which he had personally exchanged for. It had drained more than half the wealth of his storage pouch.

Li Xuanfeng didn’t have time to examine the armor carefully. He simply stored it away and strode out. Ning Heyuan closely followed, and together they rode the wind to land before the main hall.

Chi Zhiyan was studying a map when he saw the two arrive. He casually gestured, prompting Ning Heyuan to tactfully withdraw.

Chi Zhiyan then warmly approached Li Xuanfeng and asked, “What kind of Immortal Foundation have you obtained, Daoist?”

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly on the surface, but inwardly, his thoughts sharpened, Either Chi Zhiyan knows exactly what type of Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill it was, or there is definitely a shared understanding among Azure Pond Sect’s true core members regarding this matter...

“It is the Heavenly Gilded Helm,” replied Li Xuanfeng.

Chi Zhiyan nodded in satisfaction and said joyfully, “As expected of a true master! The Heavenly Gilded Helm is exceptional. Combined with Senior Xuanfeng’s archery, those devil cultivators surely won't return alive!”

Li Xuanfeng cupped his hands in acknowledgment. Chi Zhiyan pulled him forward and lightly circled a patch of forest on the map. “This is Chengshui Tomb, once the royal mausoleum of Ning State. The terrain is flat, but the spiritual energy is dense, making it ideal for setting up formations. That’s why the Murong Family’s devil cultivators are stationed there.

“This time, since more devil cultivators have descended from the Murong Family, it must be Senior Xuanfeng who breaks through. You’ll take the forces I’ve selected and advance upriver. I’ve already ordered Tang Shedu to attack from another side, and Yu Su will cut them off from the south...”

His gaze was fervent as he said in a low voice, “Tuoba Chongyuan made us suffer a great defeat, now it’s time to strike back!”

Li Xuanfeng immediately understood it wouldn’t be an easy task. He sighed inwardly and asked, “May I ask which forces I am to lead?”

Chi Zhiyan smiled at him. “Troops from Mount Yan Pass! These cultivators have fought many victorious battles recently, earning considerable merit while sustaining the fewest injuries. Li Qinghong, Lingu Lanying, and others among them are outstanding Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators...”

Li Xuanfeng’s heart grew cold. He thought to himself, So they mean to send all the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of my family into battle... Well, better they serve under my command than under Tang Shedu or Yu Su... At least I can protect them somewhat.

Besides, once I take on this task, I likely won’t need to leave seclusion for at least another year or two...

Studying the map carefully, he saw that the three forces would neatly encircle the devil cultivators. Even if the devil cultivators broke apart and fled, they would only collide with Yu Su’s troops, ensuring the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators mobilized from Mount Yan Pass would not be placed in undue danger.

At least Chi Zhiyan doesn’t want to see his forces wasted pointlessly... That’s why he’s entrusted the Li Family’s Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to me.

As for Li Xizhi, now under Tang Shedu’s command, it was the old trick of forcing mutual support. Glancing at his own roster, Li Xuanfeng saw it indeed included quite a few members from the Tang and Yu Families.

After discussing a few more details with Chi Zhiyan, Li Xuanfeng nodded in agreement, took a command token, and rode the wind outside. Ning Heyuan had been waiting before the hall for some time.

Li Xuanfeng didn’t waste words. He tossed him the roster and said in a deep voice, “Order all cultivators from Mount Yan Pass to report to me here within three days!”




# Chapter 798: Depart

Mount Yan Pass.

Li Qinghong had only been cultivating at the pass for a few months when an order from Azure Pond Sect arrived. It was then passed along within the pass until it reached Zhao Tinggui of Moon Lake Peak. The man rode the wind to the peak of the pass, bringing a group of people in tow.

Li Qinghong came out of her cave dwelling to greet him. The white-robed Zhao Tinggui gestured for the others to stay outside the main hall and entered alone.

His expression was calm, but Li Qinghong sensed his mood was low and softly said, “Daoist Friend Tinggui.”

“I wouldn’t dare... Senior is too courteous.”

All of Zhao Tinggui’s Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators at Mount Yan Pass were being transferred out. He had no idea how many would be lost at Chengshui Tomb, which placed immense pressure on him. On top of that, he had to explain the situation to the families and factions of these cultivators, which was an utterly messy affair.

How could he explain the inevitable casualties to everyone? They’d just end up transferring more Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and he would be the one making enemies. They wouldn’t dare hate Azure Pond Sect, so wouldn’t they then direct that hatred toward him?

He wasn’t the kind of person who liked making enemies, but he was being forced into this role. Naturally, he felt extremely irritated inside, yet he remained polite and said, “I received the sect’s order to transfer everyone. After reading it, I saw how urgent it was and rushed over at once.”

Li Qinghong acknowledged him, and Zhao Tinggui sighed, “One cannot shirk the sect’s orders. Please take care, senior. After all... we now share fortune and misfortune. My junior brother just fell in battle. I truly don’t want anything else to happen.”

Li Qinghong nodded and simply replied, “I’ll be heading north. I’ll trouble you to look after Yuexiang.”

She didn’t know who would be leading the northern expedition, nor how dangerous it might be. She had already prepared herself for the possibility of dying.

Worried about Li Yuexiang, she said a little more, and Zhao Tinggui replied with a serious expression, “Please be at ease, Senior. I have always treated her as one of my own peak’s disciples...”

When he saw the lingering worry on Li Qinghong’s face, Zhao Tinggui paused for a moment, then spoke solemnly, “My parents passed away early. Though I do not claim to be a good person, I’ve always regarded my peak’s disciples as my own siblings. Since I’ve promised your esteemed family, I will certainly keep my word.”

Li Qinghong let him speak. Still, the order had been marked as urgent, and there was no time to delay. She exited the cave dwelling, summoned Li Wushao and Kongheng, and broke through the sky toward Mount Bianyan.

In recent years, Kongheng had spoken less and less, seemingly growing increasingly immersed in silent cultivation. Li Wushao, as usual, wore a serious expression. It was only at this moment that Li Qinghong found a chance to speak with him in detail.

As they rode the wind, she softly said, “About that matter with the White Serpent Gu’er... Lanying feels deeply apologetic. After all, affection must go both ways...”

“My lord.” Li Wushao was momentarily startled before he understood, then rasped, “We serpents are not like humans. We don’t concern ourselves with mutual affection. If the scent cannot arouse desire, then it simply cannot. Even if emotions run deep, it’s all empty talk if the body doesn’t respond. There is no such thing as mutual affection for us, my lord, you overthink it.”

His words caught Li Qinghong by surprise, leaving her stunned for a second. Li Wushao continued calmly, “This was already common when I was in the Eastern Sea. The high-ranking Pristine Water white snakes had difficulty bearing offspring, so they took on hundreds of wives and concubines. The lower-ranking Valley Water gray snakes and Water Mansion black snakes served as their mates, producing offspring like grains of sand.

“It's not so bad with higher cultivation... but when one's cultivation is low, even if two snakes are in love, a single call from a white snake is enough to make them lose their minds and run off to be his consort.”

Li Wushao’s expression turned complicated, as if many words were lodged in his throat. He said quietly, “It seems there’s still discrimination by bloodline even after forming my Foundation Establishment... My father once said that our kind, the Hooked Serpents, would be better off dull and ignorant. But to possess human-like intelligence and yet be unable to resist our physical instincts, that is our greatest sorrow.”

Li Qinghong looked away as she listened, unsure how to comfort him. Li Wushao continued softly, “Even if there is mutual affection, once we return to our true forms and inhale each other’s scent, we feel instantly repulsed. Disgust wells up uncontrollably from the heart! Such is the nature of us demonic creatures.”

Kongheng, who had been silent, finally opened his eyes and said with a hint of heaviness, “It’s not just demons, humans, too, are not necessarily above such things.”

Kongheng’s words made Li Qinghong think of her family’s heir. She fell into silent reflection, and Li Wushao said no more.

This incident might have been a minor matter in the world of Hooked Serpents, but it had led Lingu Lanying to personally pay a visit, which had embarrassed Li Wushao. The chance to freely speak his thoughts now gave the old serpent much relief.

The group rode the wind and quickly descended into the mountains. Most of the cultivators had already arrived, and many familiar faces could be seen.

Li Qinghong looked up. A middle-aged man with black hair and golden robes stood at the highest position. His brows were sharp and fierce, and he exuded menace, as if he might transform into a tiger or leopard and pounce at any moment.

Golden light rippled across his body. He held a grand, ornate golden bow in his large, powerful hand. He stood alone atop the stone platform, with core disciples of the Immortal Sect bowing beside him and Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of all families paying their respects.

“Uncle...”

The sight brought Li Qinghong back to decades ago in an instant. Her father Li Xuanling had still been alive, and Li Xuanfeng was the family’s most gifted cultivator, newly ascended with high spirits.

She had gone up the mountain with her elder brother Li Yuanxiu, while her second brother Li Yuanjiao laughed and praised Li Xuanfeng’s godlike archery skills. Even before she had seen him, Li Qinghong had already looked forward to meeting him.

She lowered her eyes and silently thought, Uncle may have had another breakthrough.

Li Xuanfeng waited in the mountains for a moment, and the cultivators arrived as ordered. He glanced around and saw Li Qinghong and the others present as well. The white serpent was present, and the woman beside it was likely Lingu Lanying.

On the other side stood several cultivators from the Ning Family, two disciples from Moon Lake Peak, a few guest cultivators that the Azure Pond Sect had recalled from the Eastern and Southern Seas, and three representatives from the Golden Feather Sect. In total, there were sixteen Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Naturally, those in the Qi Cultivation Realm and Embryonic Breathing Realm had been drawn from the mountain’s own ranks. Their numbers were few, because they weren’t much use in battle. Moreover, the Azure Pond Sect refused to send out core sect disciples. After years of internal upheaval, it was difficult to mobilize many Qi or Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators at all.

“Midnight approaches. Everyone, let us depart,” Li Xuanfeng commanded, and his own family members responded immediately. The guest cultivators from Azure Pond Sect and the Golden Feather Sect, mostly seasoned veterans, were respectfully deferent and came over at his word.

He drew a jade vessel from his sleeve. It was the Ning Family’s Everflowing Jade Cloudliner that belonged to Ning Wan. He tossed it lightly into the air and it instantly expanded into a massive boat. Everyone boarded one after another.

Ning Heyuan, slightly slower to move, took to the skies with him. He threw out a piece of gauze from his sleeve, which shrouded everyone’s figures, and then smiled, “Well then, everyone. Why don’t we talk a bit?”

Li Xuanfeng had already been observing for a while. The guest cultivators the Azure Pond Sect had sent were all assimilated cultivators from the Eastern Sea. Their strength was mediocre, but at least they had experience dealing with devil cultivators and were skilled in survival techniques. Though they wouldn’t do much in a direct fight, they could still stall a few devil cultivators.

Only the three from the Golden Feather Sect were of real interest. One carried a talisman sword on his back and claimed to be Zhuang Cheng, a cultivator from the Smoke Valley Desert. Another was a man over two hundred years old, also from Smoke Valley, who called himself Lin Shouye.

The last one was an old Daoist who looked like he was only there to make up the numbers. He seemed to have only just entered the Foundation Establishment Realm, and had a visibly unsteady aura. He called himself Bai Yinzi of Smoke Valley and constantly wore a bitter expression.

The Golden Feather Sect differed from the Azure Pond Sect in several ways. It was looser in its control over techniques and Essence Gathering Pills, imposed less exploitation from above, and also had stricter checks on forced annexation. Many great families had continued for centuries under its rule, and they clearly had more cultivators in the Qi Cultivation Realm than the Azure Pond Sect.

Moreover, the families under the Azure Pond Sect still hadn’t recovered from the persecution and chaos under Chi Wei before his death. The former generation of prodigies had been wiped out, and the new generation was unwilling to be handed over to the Azure Pond Sect so easily. With such a shift in tides, even their Foundation Establishment Realm numbers now lagged far behind.

As for the rumor that most Dao lineages in Yue State stem from the six sons of Chongming Hall, making them more refined and highly competitive to the point where their elites often surpass those from Wu State... Who knows if it’s true or not. But judging by the two before us, their strength seems decent enough.

As Li Xuanfeng pondered, the others, including Li Qinghong, introduced themselves.

Suddenly, Bai Yinzi’s eyes lit up, and he leaned in close to Li Qinghong, lowering his voice, “Sirs and madams, this humble one is a cultivator from a small temple in Smoke Valley... Senior Donghe visited us back in the day! He even stayed there for quite a while...”

Li Qinghong immediately realized he was referring to the place where their family had collected the Golden Yang Radiant Origin. However, she had never seen this person before and couldn’t verify his claims, so she simply nodded politely and let it pass.

Bai Yinzi had no choice but to sit back down at her polite but noncommittal response and listen as the others in the boat began to chat.

The Golden Feather Sect cultivators were all experienced. In particular, Lin Shouye was a veteran of over two hundred years. He quickly struck up a conversation with several Eastern Sea cultivators. After some back-and-forth, they began to understand one another better.

After a brief moment, Ning Heyuan spoke in a deep voice, “Everyone, we’re heading to Chengshui Tomb this time to clash with the devil cultivators of the Murong Family. These aren’t your ordinary devil cultivators, so I urge you to stay vigilant.”

Although the direct descendents of the Murong Family would be handled by Li Xuanfeng and Tang Shedu, the other devil cultivators were not to be underestimated. Fearing the others might grow careless, Ning Heyuan added, “Are any of you familiar with Chengshui Tomb?”

None of the cultivators answered, until Lin Shouye’s eyes slowly rose to meet Ning Heyuan’s. He said hoarsely, “It is the royal tomb of the Ning State’s imperial lineage, and was once fortified by ancient formation arrays. Several centuries ago, Duke Xu of Xu State broke through the formation in alliance with local clans and looted all the spirit treasures within...

“It’s probably just a hollow shell now. But the spiritual energy inside remains rich, and since the local sects that once held it fled overseas, it’s become the perfect place to hold and trap the devil cultivators.”

Ning Heyuan nodded and said, “Senior, your insight is impressive.”

Lin Shouye gave a faint chuckle and replied, “I once trained there in my early years. There are rumors that a grotto heaven lies hidden within Ning State, and someone once entered it through Chengshui Tomb. However, I cannot say whether it’s true or not...”

Ning Heyuan was genuinely startled. What he thought was mere flattery now seemed to carry real weight. Still, he offered a noncommittal response, “Such rumors do exist...”

Lin Shouye stroked his beard and said no more. But Zhuang Cheng, the one with the talisman sword on his back, spoke in a deep, steady voice, “After all, Duke Xu died suddenly not long after breaking the formation. There must be strange evils lurking within Chengshui Tomb. If those devil cultivators exploit it, we’ll be lucky to suffer only minor losses. If the tide turns, the consequences could be far worse.”

Lin Shouye nodded approvingly and said, “Fellow Daoist Zhuang is absolutely right. Xu State’s immortal cultivation began its decline from that very point. It weakened by the day, until even the once-glorious Golden Tang Gate fell into decline. That eventually led to the southern push by the buddhist cultivators... and the intervention of True Monarch Shangyuan...”

At that time, Shangyuan was merely a Daoist Master, but he had now advanced to become a True Monarch, a figure spoken of like legend. Naturally, he could only be addressed as True Monarch now.

When Lin Shouye mentioned True Monarch Shangyuan, several people’s expressions turned complicated. As a member of the Golden Feather Sect, he himself wasn’t deeply moved, but many present had personally held off the buddhist cultivators and witnessed Shangyuan’s power firsthand. It stirred much emotion within them.

Lingu Lanying nodded lightly as she listened, the jade-green hairpin swaying behind her. She spoke gently, “The Murong Family’s belly-born heads are quite well known. Many of their techniques excel in fighting the many with the few, so you all must be careful.”

As they conversed, Li Qinghong remained silently observant. She soon noticed the mist outside the boat growing denser. Demonic energy was drifting about, and mountains were rising and falling in the distance. The thunder pool in her qi sea began to stir restlessly, clearly agitated by the surging aura of monsters and demons.

Chengshui Tomb...

Li Qinghong peered through the mist using her eye technique and vaguely saw ruins below. Several streaks of demonic light drifted within the clouds, moving back and forth as though searching for something.

She studied the terrain closely and realized she might have been here before. When she had once used a ritual altar to call thunder, she had visited many sites throughout Xu State to collect lightning, and this place seemed familiar.

This wasn’t called Chengshui Tomb in the altar’s records, but rather Anhuai Prefecture in Wei State... Looks like Ning State was founded after Wei fell and repurposed this site as a royal tomb... thought Li Qinghong.

Back then, there had been a few sects in the area that maintained a power balance and they treated her, merely a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator back then, politely. There must be several geomantic lines that made the area traversable, and quite a few cave dwellings as well.

These devil cultivators are likely holed up inside... This place is also close to Mount Tangdao, where the Golden Tang Gate resides...

The group gradually fell silent. Li Xuanfeng stood with his bow on his back as he gazed intently into the distance. The command token in his hand flickered with light, as though drawing something toward it.

Soon, the command token's light reached its peak and runes appeared one by one. Li Xuanfeng studied them carefully, calculated the distance, then took the bow from his back.

He spoke in a deep voice, “Tang Shedu and the others have arrived. Everyone, prepare yourselves.”

Sure enough, just as he finished speaking, a white light rose within the distant fog. A massive white human head floated into the sky, its enormous bluish-black eye sockets wide open, while two bloodshot red eyes peered out from within. Bloody tears dripped down its cheeks, and its pale fangs gleamed with a ghostly white light.

“How dare you?!”

The giant head immediately opened its mouth, its neat rows of teeth spreading like doors. Countless bluish-black dots of light gushed forth, swarming through the air and transforming into snakes, insects, ants, and scorpions. They fell like a monsoon rain, sprouting wings and dispersing in search of prey.

Li Qinghong had once seen Murong Xia, the reincarnation of a Maha. The belly-born head that the monk had released wasn’t this large. It had expelled the living souls of people that were capable of speaking, laughing, and even thanking Murong Xia...

Murong Xia was a Maha after all. His belly had been cultivated to the level of a blessed land. This Murong Family descendent, by contrast, is far inferior... One glance and it’s clear this is just a demonic technique...

Clarity dawned in Li Qinghong’s heart. Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng’s eyes narrowed. The ferocity of his expression was terrifying enough in his current middle-aged appearance that it drew glances from all around.

The middle-aged man slowly raised his golden bow. A golden arrow leaped from his waist and landed perfectly on the string. As the shimmering string drew taut, a piercing hum rang in everyone’s ears.

Whrrr...




# Chapter 800: Chengshui Tomb

Chengshui Tomb.

The terrain of Chengshui Tomb was low and mostly flat. Ash-gray forests stretched across the land, half-hidden in thick, oppressive mist. The area seemed both tranquil and ominous.

However, three figures were concealed within the mist. The one in front looked aged, his hair faintly white as he quietly stared at the forest ahead. He was flanked by two young men, one in white and holding a fan with a graceful air, while the other was broad-faced and kind-looking, clad in sea-blue robes.

Li Xizhi kept himself hidden within the clouds. The old man beside him stroked his beard and said quietly, “Xizhi, why hasn’t Tang Shedu made a move yet?”

“Perhaps he’s waiting for the other divisions,” Li Xizhi replied casually, but his condition was far from ideal. His complexion was pale, and though his body brimmed with mana, it faintly disturbed his injuries, leaving his strength unstable and hollow.

He had taken three Autumn Convergence Pills in a row, sacrificing over ten years of lifespan. He should have spent at least two or three years in seclusion to fully recover, five years if he wanted to be truly cautious.

But now, just half a year later, he had been forced to emerge and face battle again. It was no wonder his mana felt unstable. Had the pills not come from the Yang Family, but had been some ordinary mana-boosting medicine, he would’ve already suffered permanent damage.

Still, the loss of Baixiang Valley could not be ignored. A swift order from Mount Bianyan had summoned the majority of cultivators to Chengshui Tomb. Li Xizhi had not been the only one summoned, Yu Yuwei and Li Quantao had been dispatched.

Li Quantao chuckled inexplicably at his words. “I really don’t know what Tang Shedu is thinking, putting the three of us out on the fringes... I thought he’d keep you right under his nose and send you to the thickest knot of devil cultivators, just in case something ‘unexpected’ happened...”

Yu Yuwei only stroked his beard without speaking, but Li Xizhi understood clearly in his heart, Tang Shedu is probably racking his brain just trying to survive... He has no time to scheme against me! If I die and provoke the wrath of my family, they might bring all their past and present grudges to a Daoist Master, who could exterminate him into ashes with a single palm. No one would dare raise a word in his defense either.

After all, Tang Shedu no longer had any backing. Daoist Master Yuan Xiu and Daoist Master Yuanwu were barely on civil terms, so they were unlikely to stand up for him. Who else in the Azure Pond Sect would dare speak on his behalf?

In that sense, it was misfortune wrapped in fortune. As long as the three of them stuck together and didn’t face the Murong Family’s direct descendents, their safety should be assured.

As the trio stood in silence, a white light suddenly shot into the sky from nearby. The command tokens at their waists flared brightly, and a thunderous boom rolled through the sky.

Boom!

“How dare you?!” A roar erupted as black clouds swirled like a vortex in the sky. A surge of demonic energy burst from the earth, dragging a torrent of darkness into the air that swirled in all directions.

Then came a shrill, piercing shriek, “Azure Pond rats... I haven’t even come looking for you, and yet here you are, throwing yourselves at my door!”

Li Xizhi and the others exchanged glances and soared toward the commotion. They saw Tang Shedu in full glowing spirit armor, standing in front of the heart of the demonic cloud. Six long, radiant white branches manifested in the sky, orbiting the white light around him in swift flight.

A sweeping motion of his halberd scattered the demonic clouds before him. The white light radiating from his body was dazzling and intense as he said coldly, “I am Tang Shedu. I’ve come to exchange a few pointers!”

Tang Shedu was a veteran cultivator with years of renown. His techniques and mastery of the halberd were both formidable and refined through plentiful battle experience. He only needed a single strike to shatter a large swathe of the demonic clouds in the sky, scattering them in all directions.

Below, the three each engaged a devil cultivator, remaining close enough for mutual support. The one facing Li Xizhi wielded an axe and wore a black-scaled dharma robe. His eyes were faintly red, and dark demonic energy surged around him.

This devil cultivator couldn’t compare to Tuoba Chongyuan, who embodied both the immortal and demonic paths. His body was cloaked in thick, inky demonic energy. It was crude and chaotic, clearly the result of a rushed cultivation rise. He didn’t seem to be a direct subordinate of the Murong Family either, and was likely a conscripted rogue demonic cultivator. It was clear the other two had deliberately left this one to Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi advanced with his sword. The rainbow light he wielded scattered the enemy’s spell arts, causing their aura to falter slightly. He sensed the opponent was stronger than anticipated and thought to himself, This devil cultivator’s techniques aren’t remarkable, but his axe techniques have something to them...

He gently formed a seal, activating Gold In Cloud, which turned into flickering points of golden radiance. They shot past the opponent and reappeared behind him. His longsword rose, unsheathing in a flash.

Celestial Moon Slash!
𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

He sliced off the opponent’s head with a single strike. Gold In Cloud flickered once more, dodging incoming spell arts and landing off to the side. He fully activated Universal Dawn Mist, exhaled steadily, and formed a new seal.

Morning Rainbow Lure!

The devil cultivator’s head flew from his neck without much change in expression. His body stepped forward into midair, trying to chase after it. Twice he attempted to reattach it, but both times it slipped and failed to align.

He had to stop, and use both hands to awkwardly pat and adjust his neck until he finally managed to reattach it. Li Xizhi watched with a hint of regret, What a shame I’ve focused on spell arts for so many years... My swordsmanship has fallen too far behind. If not, that strike might’ve prevented him from reattaching his head altogether, and I could’ve finished the battle early.

Boom!

The rainbow light in his hand had already leaped forth when a thunderclap exploded in Li Xizhi’s ears. His chest tightened, nearly throwing him off balance. Gritting his teeth, he looked up.

He saw a white light rise into the sky, transforming into a giant human head the size of a small mountain. Its sparse eyebrows, oversized eyes, and gaping, bloody mouth roared fiercely in midair.

A belly-born head of the Murong Family...

He had only looked up for a moment, but he hadn’t stopped his spell. The devil cultivator before him had fared worse. Shaken by the roar, he hesitated for a brief instant, giving Li Xizhi's rainbow light the chance to pierce through his chest and explode into brilliant five-colored flames.

Naturally, Li Xizhi wouldn’t miss such an opportunity. He pursued with another spell, but just then, a faint humming rang in his ears, followed by a flash of dazzling golden light streaking across the sky.

The massive head in the sky let out a wretched scream and cried out in terror, “You...! Ah—you’ve come too! Wha... what an immortal bow!”

Li Xizhi’s heart settled instantly, as if he had regained his confidence, The elders have arrived! It seems the Azure Pond Sect is committing its full force this time... perhaps with support from the Golden Feather Sect as well.

He pressed a stream of rainbow light against the enemy’s chest, causing the devil’s body to quake and his vital qi to suffer heavy damage. But thick demonic flames erupted from the enemy’s feet again, and the battle above seemed to shift once more.

Li Xizhi didn’t have time to look closely, when two figures suddenly shot out from the surrounding demonic clouds. One came from the left, the other from the right, pincering him between them.

Li Xizhi already felt a sting on his face even before their spells arrived. He had no choice but to release his current opponent, draw his sword to block, and send forth a rainbow slash that shattered the two incoming spell arts before him.

But the move was too rushed; it aggravated his injuries, forcing him to briefly pause to regulate his breath. The two devil cultivators were both hardened killers from the north, and they had the instincts to match. They exchanged glances and simultaneously activated their dharma artifacts to attack.




# Chapter 801: Captured Alive

The two cultivators attacked together. Li Xizhi formed a spell with one hand and wielded his sword with the other, leaping out of their encirclement and scattering patches of golden-red rainbow lights. Sweat appeared on his forehead as he finally found the chance to properly examine his opponents.

One of them had a dignified and sturdy appearance. He was neatly dressed and held a dark purple-black jar densely covered with intricate white patterns. His eyes were wide, filled with uncertainty.

The other man had a fierce and greedy look. He was taller than his companion and wore a black robe. Layers of white mist continuously drifted from him, coiling around him like agile serpents.

When he saw Li Xizhi easily escaping their encirclement, the devil cultivator holding the jar transmitted a hasty message using divine sense, “Fellow Daoist Qiu! This person is difficult to deal with. You're familiar with the local situation, do you know anything about him?”

The ears of the burly devil cultivator stepping on the white mist twitched. His aggressive gaze swept over Li Xizhi’s robe without hiding his intentions, and he replied darkly, “Brother Ge... judging from his appearance, he's probably from the Azure Pond Sect. He has many treasures, and it seems he's injured. You and I... let’s seize this opportunity and rob him!”

Devil cultivator Ge nodded slowly. Both of them were devil cultivators summoned from the region of Xu State. They were not trusted retainers of the Murong Family, so they had always intended to make a significant profit. When they saw Li Xizhi in poor condition, their greed immediately started to rear its head.

Li Xizhi calmly regulated his breath and transmitted a mana message. Li Quantao and Yu Yuwei had already suppressed their devil cultivator opponents and had spare attention to observe him, relieving him greatly.

But the two devil cultivators before him allowed no openings. Devil cultivator Ge finally made the decision to throw out his purple-black jar. A burst of gray smoke emerged from it and was swept forward by the wind toward Li Xizhi.

Rainbow light shone from Li Xizhi’s hand as he activated his defensive spell, Dawn Wind Stabilizer. Two arcs of rainbow light rippled outward like waves on water. The Heavenly Glow Dao lineage wasn't known for defense, and Li Xizhi’s technique was already one of the rare respectable defensive arts in the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique manual.

His injuries made his spell appear dimmer than usual. It should have dispersed the enemy’s attack outright, but now it merely pushed back the gray smoke, temporarily restraining the opponent’s momentum.

Li Xizhi was inwardly startled, his heart sinking, These two aren’t ordinary devil cultivators!

But devil cultivator Qiu had already lunged forth on white mist, and instantly appeared before him. He combined two clumps of white mist in his hand, and forcibly ripped through the rippling rainbow light.

The white mist sizzled on contact with mana. It was seemingly designed to neutralize enemy spells, as it instantly turned mana into ashes. The Dawn Wind Stabilizer only briefly delayed him as his hand shot directly toward Li Xizhi’s chest.

Li Quantao, who was observing the situation from the side, immediately sensed something was wrong. His heart skipped a beat as he shouted, “Senior Yu!”

His shout rang out like thunder. Yu Yuwei activated his Immortal Foundation to the fullest, shaking out two purple-red flames from his sleeves that intercepted the devil cultivator facing Li Quantao. A massive purple-red cauldron hurtled through the air, instantly forcing the two devil cultivators into disarray.

Li Quantao tapped his chest and spat out a radiant pearl. The pearl released dazzling streams of light, dispersing the demonic clouds into a few small dark patches. Clear droplets rose from beneath the pearl and merged into the clouds.

“Water Wall Pearl!”

Clang...

Cultivator Qiu’s attention suddenly shifted away from Li Xizhi, eyes widening in surprise. Devil cultivator Ge similarly lost his composure, excitement and greed surfacing on his face as he cried out, “What a powerful dharma artifact! Could it be an ancient relic? A Water Mansion ancient dharma artifact?”

The Water Wall Pearl’s power was astonishing as it nearly dispersed the spirit winds under their feet. The bright and lustrous white pearl hovered silently in the air. It was clearly extraordinary. Rather than fear, the two devil cultivators felt joy, as their attention was immediately captured by the artifact.

As both devil cultivators momentarily froze, Li Xizhi felt the pressure ease. Li Quantao stepped forward, gripping the artifact and shouting loudly, “Brother Zhi... I’m here to help you!”

Yet, at that moment, both devil cultivators erupted in sudden fury. Devil cultivator Qiu’s black robes billowed violently as white mist uncontrollably surged from his seven orifices along with bursts of blood. The mist spiraled like a storm across his shoulders and back around his face.

At the same time, Devil cultivator Ge bit off the tip of his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of blood. The jar in his hand flashed with crimson light, expanding several times in size. Gray smoke burst forth like competing snakes racing forward.

“So decisive... Northern devil cultivators...”

Both devil cultivators simultaneously used techniques that burned their own lifeblood and vitality without hesitation. Gray and white mists swept forward together, startling Li Quantao greatly.

Focused entirely on aiding Li Xizhi, Li Quantao hadn’t anticipated their sudden and nearly suicidal attack. He hastily threw out the Water Wall Pearl to intercept the incoming mists.

Li Xizhi naturally wouldn’t stand idle. Gathering his mana, he drew his sword swiftly, a brilliant sword-light erupting from its sheath, aimed sharply at devil cultivator Qiu’s back.

A loud explosion echoed. The shattered waves of gray and white mist caused intense pain in Li Xizhi’s eyes, causing tears to stream down his face. His sword seemed to have struck something, but devil cultivator Qiu had vanished into the white mist.
𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝒆𝓵.𝓬𝓸𝒎

A pale Li Quantao staggered back several steps. The Water Wall Pearl had saved his life again, absorbing nearly sixty percent of their combined attack. The pearl continued hovering, still as radiant as ever.

But the strength belonged entirely to the artifact, not Li Quantao himself. Despite the pearl absorbing most of the damage, Li Quantao had clearly suffered significantly from the strike. So, he quickly recalled the pearl.

Li Xizhi moved swiftly to his side with a flash of Gold In Cloud, spreading a sleeveful of Heavenly Glow. He noticed devil cultivator Qiu’s astonished expression, blood still visible on his cheeks due to excessive mana consumption.

Devil cultivator Qiu questioned suspiciously, “The Li Family of Lijing?”

Li Xizhi was uncertain how Qiu recognized him, but judging by the mention of the Li Family of Lijing, it likely concerned events from years past. His expression grew solemn, but he remained silent.

Devil cultivator Ge, disappointed in Qiu’s hesitation, immediately started to curse, “Qiu Ji! You damned idiot! Why hesitate at this critical time?! Hurry up and seize that artifact! There’ll be nothing left for us when others gather!”

Qiu Ji glared darkly at him, secretly harboring distrustful thoughts, There’s only one artifact, how could the two of us share it? I’ve fought with this family before... They’re strong! I also heard they’re a sword immortal clan. They might have hidden trump cards.

I should’ve tricked old Ge into blocking those talismans swords... Better if he dies without a corpse, so I can naturally take the artifact. It’s a perfect outcome. But since things remain unsettled, I must first kill one person with full force.

Sinister and terrifying white mist surged violently in his hands, as he recklessly fueled them with his vitality.

Even as he observed the pair closely, Li Xizhi noticed dozens of immortal lights approaching from the south. His heart quickened slightly, There are many immortals that are certainly coming. Aunt might not leave Mount Yan Pass, but perhaps my own family, or even the Yang Family, will arrive...

The Heavenly Glow in his hand shifted slightly as he thought. It didn’t attack the two cultivators, but instead soared upward through layers of clouds toward the dozens of approaching immortal lights.

However, this brief delay caused Li Quantao to instantly spat out blood. His strength was modest, since he was only at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He relied entirely on the ancient dharma artifact in his possession.

Though the Water Wall Pearl could block most attacks due to its indestructible nature, the two devil cultivators before him were cunning. Their increasingly tricky spells caused Li Quantao to repeatedly cough up blood.

Now, Li Quantao didn't even have the mental capacity to pay attention to Li Xizhi’s actions. His spirits sank further as the foreboding sense of impending death gradually overcame him.

The Water Wall Pearl had enabled Li Encheng, at the early Foundation Establishment Realm, to evenly battle Chi Wei, a direct descendant of an immortal sect at the late Foundation Establishment Realm. Yet in Li Quantao’s hands, it was merely a defensive artifact. This disparity in mastery filled Li Quantao with bitterness, I truly fall short of my father in every aspect!

Li Xizhi saw no one arriving to assist them, so he reactivated his mana to face the enemy. But it only took a few exchanges for Li Quantao to be badly injured, forcing Li Xizhi to look toward Yu Yuwei for help.

However, his heart sank. Yu Yuwei had initially been fighting two alone, but he now faced yet another devil cultivator. The elderly man was overwhelmed and unable to offer assistance.

His face darkened, but he then heard Li Quantao’s faint, thread-like voice in his ear, “Brother Zhi! The Yu Family can’t be trusted. Yu Yuwei covets my artifact, so he’ll deliberately watch passively... He won’t help!”

Li Quantao had always been strongly hostile toward the Yu Family. Li Xizhi could only silently sigh, drawing his sword again as he stood protectively in front of Li Quantao as the two devil cultivators launched another assault on them.

“Go!” Li Xizhi judged that, given his talisman seeds and talisman qi, he could endure longer than Li Quantao. If they fled, Yu Yuwei would be forced to act, willing or not.

He transmitted using divine sense, “I’ll hold the artifact and escape. Heavenly Glow excels in escape arts, so these two devil cultivators likely won’t catch me...”

Boom!

But before he finished speaking, the gray and white mist hurriedly withdrew like frightened rabbits. The surrounding demonic energy scattered completely as a deafening rumble and dazzling white light stunned everyone present.

Li Xizhi immediately activated his perception art, clearly seeing Qiu Ji’s pale face convulsing violently. A silver-white spear tip pierced through Qiu Ji’s chest, forcing trails of black smoke into the air.
𝐟𝕣𝗲𝕖𝕨𝗲𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝗲𝚕.𝗰𝚘𝐦

A burst of purple lightning exploded from dark clouds, causing Qiu Ji to scream. Devil cultivator Ge stared in shock. His scalp tingled and his legs weakened. When he heard a thunderclap, he retreated dozens of feet in panic.

Though briefly weakened by lightning, Qiu Ji was extraordinary. He immediately transformed into white mist and reformed into a skull-like head. Unable to flee, he threw himself toward Li Quantao.

Boom!

The skull-like mist was extremely fast, but the crystalline purple light moved faster, instantly intercepting it.

"This is..." Li Quantao paled, not yet reacting fully, as the purple light transformed into a female cultivator in an azure-purple feathered robe who landed gracefully before Li Xizhi.

Her eyes were a hazy purple and she held a silver spear.

Li Qinghong coldly stared at the white skull, muttering, “Qiu Ji...”

She lifted Qiu Ji by the neck, leaving everyone utterly astonished. Even Yu Yuwei was shocked. His devil cultivator opponents exchanged quick glances before immediately fleeing.

Qiu Ji, having been shattered by the lightning, took two full seconds to reform half his body in the air. His upper torso hung helplessly in the woman's grasp, his expression filled with extreme terror. His trembling lips appeared to be muttering pleas for mercy.

The purple brilliance in the almond-shaped eyes of the woman seemed sharp enough to pierce right through him. Hatred gradually surfaced in her gaze, filling Qiu Ji with dread.

It’s her... that female cultivator from the Li Family! So it's already come to this! If I'd known she hated me so deeply, I would have killed one of her relatives back at the market...

Despite being shielded by thunder, it wasn't easy for Li Qinghong's physical body to pierce through the corrosive demonic qi. Bright crimson blood trickled down her wrist, yet she only felt satisfaction in her vengeance.

Qiu Ji, eyes filled with blurry purple lightning, could only cry out in terror, “Milady, you are—”

Boom!

Purple lightning instantly crashed down on him. Qiu Ji screamed in agony as a delicate hand closed tightly around the white mist of his body.

Li Qinghong’s red lips parted slightly as she said coldly, “Old bastard... after so many years... I've finally caught you.”

Her melodious voice echoed through the air. Although this particular corner of the battlefield only had few devil and immortal cultivators, everyone present shuddered.

Qiu Ji's face was a mask of despair as he thought, How could it be this sudden... how could she be this ruthless?!

He didn't believe himself entirely helpless against Li Qinghong. But the unexpected ambush and Li Qinghong’s resolute killing intent had resulted in his current miserable state.

Nearby, devil cultivator Ge was frightened nearly to death. Though Qiu Ji’s strength was slightly inferior to his, he'd lost all ability to resist so quickly because of the ambush. Which devil cultivator wouldn't fear a woman bathed in lightning like this?

He desperately tried fleeing silently with all his might, but at that moment, the Heavenly Glow cultivator and the man wielding the Water Mansion artifact arrogantly took advantage and eagerly blocked his escape. One moved swiftly, always appearing ahead of him. The other was even more troublesome as he used the Water Mansion artifact to firmly suppress his escaping light.

But what truly chilled devil cultivator Ge’s heart was that the female cultivator, with her silver spear and feathered robe surrounded by purple lightning, had long locked onto him with her lightning-infused spiritual sense. She seemed to be casually standing there, but whenever her almond-shaped eyes glanced over at him, he knew any sign of fleeing would invite instant annihilation by lightning!

Damn that fool Qiu Ji... Clearly, he had deep ties with this family! Yet he kept scheming and hiding the truth from me completely! Now look at what's happened! My life is finished!




# Chapter 803: Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing

Li Qinghong's entire body crackled with lightning. Energy surged ceaselessly within her thunderpool, and the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow within her qi sea shone brightly, releasing streams of red and violet energy that poured into her Immortal Foundation.

She had originally battled alongside fellow cultivators against devil cultivators, penetrating deep into enemy territory. When she had engaged a Murong Family guest cultivator, she had caught sight of rainbow lights out of the corner of her eye.

Having received Li Xizhi’s letter earlier, Li Qinghong knew he'd taken three Autumn Convergence Pills and had yet to fully recover. Thus, she was filled with anxiety upon spotting the rainbow light. But she had been faced with a stubborn opponent, so she quickly made a decisive choice.

She abruptly changed tactics, risking her life to inflict serious injuries and forcing her enemy to flee in a streak of bloody light. She then activated the Cyan Sparrow Plume on her body, turning into a stream of Cyan Plume radiance as she raced through lightning.

The Cyan Plume streamlight was the natural ability of the Wanglin Sect feathered robe. Combined with her innate lightning speed, she instantly caught the two cultivators completely off guard.

“Qiu Ji.”

Years ago, during the calamity at the Xiao Family market, Qiu Ji had severely wounded Li Xuanxuan, greatly damaging his vitality. He also killed Li Qinghong’s younger brother, Li Yuanyun, the sole heir of Li Xuanling, leaving not even his corpse behind.

Later, he ambushed the Li Family again, killing Tian Youdao, Li Qinghong’s uncle. Although Li Qinghong rarely spoke of it, her hatred had never diminished. Each time she revisited the memory, it felt like she might never have the chance for revenge despite how vast the world was.

“And yet you dare harm my family again...”

Old grudges and new hatred swirled within her. Violet light erupted from Li Qinghong, and dense lightning energy poured into her palm, slowly melting Qiu Ji’s head.

The devil cultivator screamed in agony as Li Qinghong said venomously, “You used devil winds to dissolve my brother’s flesh back then. Now, taste your own medicine!”

Blinding white lightning burst forth, and Qiu Ji’s figure dissolved completely amid the struggling white mist. Lightning was unrivaled at purging evil, and this single strike inflicted upon him the pain of countless lightning bolts, completely annihilating his body and soul.

If they were bound and struck repeatedly by lightning until both body and soul dispersed, even a buddhist cultivator famed for reincarnation would surely perish. Even a True Monarch would find it impossible to resurrect him now.

If circumstances were different and I didn't need to conserve energy, I'd have surely tortured him longer to satisfy my revenge... thought Li Qinghong.

The Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow within her stirred restlessly after killing Qiu Ji. Her violet and cyan radiance came about due to the resonance between her lightning and the Cyan Sparrow Plume. Now that lightning had intensified, the purple glow became even more pronounced.

She glanced back once before transforming into violet-cyan light again, instantly vanishing from her original spot, leaving echoes of thunder reverberating among the clouds.

Devil cultivator Ge had fled several kilometers before the blood pills beneath his skin finally burst, gradually restoring his speed. He’d finally managed to escape from the strange suppression of the Water Mansion dharma artifact, allowing his heart to slowly calm.

She’s probably still busy torturing Qiu Ji...

Yet, the instant this thought crossed his mind, his hair stood on end, and sharp, burning pain flared up in his back. Hastily turning around and activating his artifact, he cried in terror, “Fellow Daoist, spare me! Spare me! I have nothing to do with that man. Don’t ruin my century-long cultivation...”

Boom.

The only reply he received was from the dharma artifact in the feathered-robed female cultivator’s hand. A purple dharma bottle soared into the sky, unleashing several bolts of lightning that rammed into his demonic jar.

"Aghh!"

Since the artifact was spiritually linked to him, devil cultivator Ge immediately spat out blood. His purple-black jar emitted bursts of dark smoke, as he lost at least five years of nurturing from the lightning’s impact.

Li Qinghong’s recent acquisition of the feathered robe had significantly elevated her combat strength. Empowered further by talisman qi, lightning flickered around her. She left no room for him to escape as her spear thrust toward his chest, enveloped in lightning.

Boom!

Thunder roared again, and Li Xizhi watched the flickering purple radiance within the clouds. He suddenly felt short of breath as relief flooded through him.

Li Quantao asked blankly, "Is that Senior Qinghong?"

"It’s aunt," replied Li Xizhi.

Li Quantao smiled faintly, shaking his head as he spoke, "Thunder arts truly excel at purging demons. Senior Qinghong’s strength is impressive, I greatly admire her."

Li Xizhi felt similarly astonished. Qiu Ji was not weak; he had surpassed many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from prominent families. Even if Li Xizhi had not been severely injured, he could only guarantee defeating Qiu Ji; killing him would be difficult.

Yet Li Qinghong, empowered by thunder arts, had killed him within a few moves. Li Xizhi felt both joy and concern, Firstly, aunt’s strength has clearly grown... Secondly, I fear she’s injured and was forced to activate the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow...

The Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow was a talisman qi specialized in combat. Li Xizhi had no doubt devil cultivator Ge would fail to escape, yet he remained worried about Li Qinghong’s injury. After briefly adjusting their breathing, Yu Yuwei approached them.
𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

Though Li Quantao held grudges against him, he greeted Yu Yuwei politely. Li Xizhi hid his doubts, silently thinking, How injured is Yu Yuwei really? He was formidable against Tuoba Chongyuan earlier, but something seemed off just now...

The three devil cultivators battling Yu Yuwei weren’t like Qiu Ji or Ge; they were just ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm devil cultivators spawned from blood scripts. They shouldn’t have troubled him so severely.

Li Qinghong’s recent lightning strike instantly frightened away many devils, causing Li Xizhi to question the true strength of those three devil cultivators. His mood darkened further.

Since they were in poor condition, they dared not linger. They rode swiftly on the wind and followed the direction of the purple light for dozens of kilometers.

Li Xizhi’s heart chilled when he sensed several devilish lights pursuing him, The difference in numbers is too great... We've traveled dozens of kilometers and have only seen demonic qi and no immortal lights. Our cultivators aren't weak, it shouldn't be like this... It seems enemy reinforcements have arrived.

After pausing briefly, they saw the purple light returning. Li Qinghong appeared solemnly, holding a cracked demonic jar in one hand, while the other refined a black orb with intense purple lightning. Blood stained the corner of her lips, and she finally relaxed upon seeing them.

Li Qinghong was similarly aware of the dire situation. Tang Shedu and Li Xuanfeng had led teams from the east and south, but the eastern front had suffered severe casualties and was on the verge of collapse. After flying dozens of kilometers without seeing any allies, she refused to linger, preferring injury over delay. She was determined to quickly kill the enemy before her.

She paused briefly, then said softly, “Let's retreat southward first, there are fewer devil cultivators there.”

The three nodded in agreement. Yu Yuwei appeared calm and composed, revealing nothing unusual. Before anyone else could speak, a booming sound echoed in the sky alongside flickering golden lights, and a harsh, demonic voice shouted, “Tang Shedu!”

The droning roar reverberated continuously. Yu Yuwei glanced around cautiously, noticing several clouds of demonic qi slowly converging around them. The elderly cultivator’s face looked uncertain as a sense of unease rose within him, How come there are so many devil cultivators here? Where are the reinforcements?

Before he could voice his doubt, another overwhelming demonic voice echoed fiercely, filled with murderous intent, “The Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing has sounded! He already harbors suspicion! Eliminate him immediately!”

Buzz...

Li Xuanfeng drew his bow once again, the golden bowstring filled with razor-sharp brilliance. Narrowing his eyes slightly, he observed Murong En of the Murong Family clutching his stomach in the distance as a vast cloud of black qi billowed around him.

The Murong Family possessed many Dao lineages, and Murong En’s cultivation differed distinctly from Murong Wu’s. Instead, he resembled the Maha Murong Xia, his body like assembled mud, dispersing and reforming at will.

No one knew just how many things his stomach contained. Various scattered dharma artifacts occasionally flew out along with the black qi, sometimes accompanied by black clouds that transformed into human-shaped shadows.

“He doesn’t seem like a devil cultivator, rather, he resembles a Master Monk...”

Buzz...

The golden arrows at Li Xuanfeng’s waist vibrated restlessly. Most of them shone brilliantly in gold and were engraved with glowing white mystical patterns. Only one arrow remained quiet, a slender and elegant piece tinged in red and gold hues.

This red-gold profound arrow had been refined using Six Ding Merging Fire within a grotto heaven, and later incorporated by the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact, Zhi Ge Ring. It had been unintentionally catalyzed during a clash between two Foundation Establishment Realm elites and had become exceptionally formidable. As a hidden trump card, it wouldn’t be casually used, so Li Xuanfeng drew only a regular golden arrow.

The arrow's mystical patterns slowly gained two layers of golden radiance, one layer sharp and swift, the other darker and heavier. Intertwining golden lights hummed as they fused at the arrow tip, causing the devil cultivator before him to noticeably slow down.

"Damn it!"

Faced with the dazzling golden brilliance, Murong En felt a sharp pain between his eyebrows once again. Hatred surged within his chest, choking him with rage as he urgently circulated his mana again, No wonder Murong Wu died. This man’s archery is astonishing. His artifacts and spiritual robe are both powerful. Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing described him as born with immense physical strength and had his aperture in his palm... truly rare indeed...

Despite his hatred, Murong En had to acknowledge his opponent’s strength. The man appeared to have consumed some pills or used a secret technique. His arrows contained dual-layered mana—one extremely sharp, the other corrosive—making them exceptionally difficult to counter.

The sense of danger between his eyebrows grew increasingly intense, and his heart suddenly went cold. A single thought flashed through his mind, “He's aiming for my left arm!”

Instantly, his left arm dispersed into black mist, narrowly avoiding the golden light that pierced past him and left a golden trail several kilometers behind him. Murong En cried out in pain, his expression gloomy, but he felt relief and resentment. He thought, If the master hadn’t given me the spirit artifact Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing to foresee the target of his profound arrow... damn it... just wait a bit longer...

Although Murong En’s body could reform at will, Li Xuanfeng’s golden arrows weren’t easy to evade. Whenever they struck him, Murong En screamed in agony, the golden Astral Qi fiercely slicing away chunks of demonic qi.

Though Li Xuanfeng steadily forced the devil cultivator back, his heart remained heavy with doubt. His grey eyes narrowed as he stared intensely, anxiety gripping him, There should have been two devil cultivators here... Where's the other one?

Li Xuanfeng felt something off. They had exchanged nearly a hundred blows, Murong En’s demonic body was mostly shattered, and yet despite his pitiful cries, he had no intention of retreating.

What is he waiting for...? thought Murong En.

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes narrowed in suspicion and he cast a cold glance at Tang Shedu. Had this man not constantly guarded against him, hesitating and holding back from fully confronting the devil cultivator opposite them, how could this demon still be standing?

Master Monks were naturally adept at manipulating others' minds. Murong En had easily caught onto Tang Shedu’s hesitation and cautiousness, so he deliberately avoided fully attacking Tang Shedu, instead constantly targeting Li Xuanfeng, wary of his spiritual arrows.

Li Xuanfeng glanced grimly at the cultivators amidst the fog. His subordinates were faring slightly better. Lin Shouye possessed decent strength, and Zhuang Cheng had already slain their opponent with his sharp talisman sword.

Kongheng and Wushao had each held back three devil cultivators. Lingu Lanying was similarly exceptional as she nearly dissolved the enemy’s demonic body. They'd lost only one cultivator, as even Bai Yinzi fought fiercely.

Qinghong went toward Tang Shedu’s side...

Li Xuanfeng looked toward the distant battlefield, taking in the falling immortal lights and raging demonic qi. Ominous premonitions filled his mind. Though he had the advantage here, Tang Shedu’s forces had already collapsed. There were scarcely any immortal lights left amid the rampant demonic clouds...

“What a reckless arrangement... I wonder how Xizhi is faring. Qinghong must have gone to aid him...” muttered Li Xuanfeng.

Li Xuanfeng slowly drew his golden bow back once more, his eyes growing dark with suspicion. His naturally fierce expression, coupled with the menacing glint in his grey eyes, became even more intimidating.

Something’s wrong... very wrong...

His heart felt like a stone slowly sinking into a lake. Golden light silently rose from his arms as a terrifying suspicion formed in his mind, Tang Shedu...

Why had Tang Shedu’s forces collapsed so swiftly and completely? Was he truly holding back solely out of wariness toward him, even in such a critical mission? Tang Shedu was renowned as the wielder of the Changtian Halberd. Even when he was restrained, he should have been formidable. Yet, his fighting was sluggish, as if he weren't truly there at all...

Li Xuanfeng’s eyelids fell as a chilling thought formed in his mind. It was one so shocking that it could shake every cultivator and nearly break Mount Yan Pass, Tang Shedu is afraid... He fears Tu Longjian... He fears...

His golden bow froze momentarily in mid-air as streams of light emerged across his body. Opposite him, Murong En’s demonic aura and bloody radiance suddenly stalled.

A crisp ringing sound echoed from his chest, and the devil cultivator erupted into a deafening roar, “Tang Shedu!”

Tang Shedu!

Clang!

A piercing mana whistle resonated as a flash of golden-white emerged from endless darkness. It shook countless mulberry leaves from trees, whipping flesh and bones from tombs into the sky, only to have them rain down again.

A long-prepared platinum halberd tore through thick layers of clouds. Its golden brilliance, akin to the first rays of dawn dispelling evil, surged forward like a golden pill bursting from endless mist, stabbing fiercely forward!

The halberd churned the wind and clouds, manifesting twelve smaller platinum branches. Powerful mana surged along the weapon, its aura elegant and smooth, reflecting the accumulated might of countless years.

Golden light climbed upward, illuminating pale-colored soft armor and sturdy arms, and finally revealing Tang Shedu’s calm yet ruthless face. His slender fingers were tightly wrapped around the halberd’s white handle.

The halberd was pointed straight at Li Xuanfeng!

This strike had been gathering strength for who knows how long. It had emerged like silent golden lightning slicing through the night, abrupt and sharp, even quicker than Murong En’s roaring voice.

Only when the halberd was already thrusting forward did the rolling demonic voice finally resound clearly, “The Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing has sounded! He already harbors suspicion! Eliminate him immediately!”




# Chapter 805: Turning Point

Tang Shedu thrust his halberd forward, a hazy golden light flashing in midair as dark clouds rolled back and forth. The halberd was reflected in Li Xuanfeng’s pupils, yet his heart instead calmed.

"So it really was you."

All doubts had been dispelled. The reason why Tang Shedu’s forces had been wiped out so quickly must be because he had revealed all their arrangements, perhaps even what dharma artifacts or Immortal Foundations they possessed. The devil cultivators only needed to follow the plan and kill them in order.

"Quick to defect, weren’t you..."

Tu Longjian broke through to Purple Mansion first, and Tang Shedu defected to the northern side right after. The man must have received a promise from some devil or buddhist cultivator. He truly was resolute and ruthless. Even now, he had a calm, composed expression, as though everything were under control.

Li Xuanfeng’s gaze was cold as a spark of golden light lit up on his chest and climbed up to his neck. It slowly transformed into a white suit of armor as it reached his jawline. Radiance burst forth as the light spread from his chest to his limbs, finally tracing a ring of gold behind him.

It was the Heavenly Gilded Helm!

Dark-golden patterns surfaced across his body. Since he had been prepared, Li Xuanfeng flipped his longbow, reached over his neck to grip the bow, and held the long golden weapon between them to block the Changtian Halberd.

Boom!

A thunderous boom echoed through the air. A few golden ripples flashed past, and Li Xuanfeng’s figure reappeared several kilometers away, golden aura surging around him. Blood glinted once more in his pupils as he coughed twice.

Tang Shedu was not weak at all, and his innate ability for cultivation was top-tier. If it hadn’t been for Yuanwu blocking his techniques and preventing him from reaching Purple Mansion Realm, he would have been far more formidable by now. Even so, his years of accumulation were by no means trivial.

Even with preparation, Li Xuanfeng suffered a light injury from that charged blow. Two mouthfuls of golden powder spilled from between his lips and teeth, drifting through the air, scattering in a hazy golden shimmer.

Tang Shedu did not pursue him immediately. He gazed at Li Xuanfeng deeply, his voice a little hoarse as he said, "Fellow Daoist, listen again."

Murong En transformed into billowing black mist that surged forward. Devilish light eagerly followed as a demonic roar echoed through the sky, "Tang Shedu! He doesn’t want to run!"

Li Xuanfeng surged upward in golden light, shooting into the sky before anything became clear. One hand held his bow while the other drew back an arrow. Mana surged as his deep voice rolled through the clouds, "Tang Shedu! You’ve joined the northern devil Dao and ambushed me! Are you not afraid that the Daoist Masters will settle accounts with you later?"

Li Xuanfeng had no interest in a war of words, he merely needed to make sure the message was heard by all the cultivators on the battlefield. Above all else, the priority was to spread word that Tang Shedu had defected to the devils.

Tang Shedu rode a stream of light as he gave chase, his cold gaze fixed forward. His halberd thrust forward, and his voice was low and indistinct, "Li Xuanfeng, I joined the Northern Dao; only Yuan Xiu bears me hatred here."

His words made Li Xuanfeng’s heart jolt, but a golden arrow had already been released. Tang Shedu’s halberd swept up to parry the arrow, causing it to explode into a shower of golden sparks in the air.

Still, he heard Li Xuanfeng murmur, "Trying to bargain with a tiger!"

Tang Shedu’s expression grew complicated. When he saw the flowing radiance of Li Xuanfeng’s Heavenly Gilded Helm, it was as if he was looking at a version of himself with a different fate.

He didn’t hesitate as his halberd thrust out, but his voice was heavy, "If I hadn't joined the North, I’d have ended up like you—like this! No more chance of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm! How is that any different from death?!

"You think I can’t see it clearly? The Chi Family did this very thing in the past!"

His halberd was flowing with white radiance, fusing with the boiling mana surging from his body. He seemed like a descended god as he roared, "Of course I know bargaining with tigers is futile! But if I’m destined to be a pawn refined by the Azure Pond Sect, why not gamble for backing and a Dao? What can Yuan Xiu do to me alone if I head north?

"And more than that... more than that... this is a supreme buddhist fate!"

Thunderous words burst from Tang Shedu’s mouth. He swept his halberd before him, shattering the golden light flying at him. His face was blasted full of holes by shards of Astral Qi, but they rapidly closed again as he raged, "I know you’re calling out! Good! Let the world know! Let them all aid me! If they speak my name once, grant me one strand of destiny!"

His voice was stifled and full of fury, as if venting the frustration of being denied the Purple Mansion Realm for decades. Golden light swirled in his pupils as he sneered coldly, "Li Xuanfeng, you consumed a Human Pill. Do you even know that? You and I both committed blood-debts for the demonic sect. Don’t talk to me about falling into devilry. The North sucks marrow, while the South carves flesh—how are they different?!"

While they argued, Li Xuanfeng had already fired dozens of arrows that turned into countless golden-white streaks. His two Immortal Foundations surged to the limit, as he relied on his own strength to suppress both Tang Shedu and Murong En, painting a vast stretch of sky gold in the process.

Murong En remained unhurried, silently activating the spirit artifact within his body to influence Li Xuanfeng before him. His voice echoed in Tang Shedu’s ears, "Tang Shedu! Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing has rung thrice. The killing karma is dense and the demonic seed revealed; the chance to transform karma and rise is right before you! For just a dozen of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators deaths, Lord Jinlian’s promised seat of The Merciful One is near!"

But he did not expect Tang Shedu to cast a resentful and vicious glance at him as he snapped coldly, "Shut up."

"You—!"

Murong En froze for a moment, only to see Tang Shedu glaring at him like a venomous snake, "You think I don’t understand? This kind of turn is a great karmic opportunity for the buddhist Dao. What Maha wouldn’t want me? Hmm?"

Layers of golden light exploded from his body as all kinds of emotions flashed through his pupils. His halberd could now intercept arrows at a greater distance, even though the shock left cracks across both hands.

Still, he extended his arms and slowly walked forward. A dark-golden hue appeared in Tang Shedu’s eyes, streams of radiance flowing across his body. Murong En’s expression grew grim as he let his hands fall to his sides, watching coldly as Tang Shedu climbed step by step.

Tang Shedu rasped, "Tu Longjian... Tu Longjian was born with destiny. Fine then. Thirty years of cultivation, and he drives me to desperation. Fifty years of struggle, and he becomes a Daoist Master. His fate is good...

"I began cultivating at six years old. I schemed tirelessly to please Tang Yuanwu for mere scraps of secret techniques. I’ve carved flesh from my own body for the sake of cultivation, endured sword and blade piercing my meridians every day under Yu Muxian... Still, I never once thought of becoming your enemy."
𝒻𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝘮

His halberd shone with dazzling white light. Li Xuanfeng calmly broke Tang Shedu’s halberd arts with two arrows. Unfazed, Tang Shedu pushed through the golden Astral Qi, and asked softly, "But why? Li Xuanfeng."

As those words left his lips, golden light burst from him like flames, burning away the devil mist. Tang Shedu swept his halberd forward, knocking aside the golden bow, while his other hand suddenly reached out to grab Li Xuanfeng’s throat.

Boom!

The platinum glow of the Heavenly Gilded Helm on Li Xuanfeng’s arm burst forth. Li Xuanfeng caught Tang Shedu’s wrist. His piercing gray-black eyes met Tang Shedu’s gaze, and he said nothing. He simply held his breath and locked his hand in an icy grip.

Tang Shedu slammed into a hardness as cold as iron. His breath wouldn’t settle as it swelled chaotically in his chest. Li Xuanfeng felt no fear, but Tang Shedu, on the verge of ascending to The Merciful One, grew increasingly frantic.

In Li Xuanfeng’s eyes, the Tang Shedu now turning to Buddhism began to resemble someone else entirely. Much like his time at Zhenhui Temple, those same questions echoed across time and slithered into his ears once again.

Li Xuanfeng’s hatred was a cold, still thing. Increasingly intricate profound lines began to glow on the arm gripping Tang Shedu’s wrist. Strength to Move Mountains no longer offered a great boost by itself, but with both Immortal Foundations operating together, and with Heavenly Gilded Helm enhancing his physical cultivation, his strength continued to rise steadily.

Crack... crack...

The snap of bones echoed audibly in the air. Li Xuanfeng squeezed until Tang Shedu’s face twisted in agony. The malice in his eyes sharpened, but in the end, he said no more, and only murmured, "Li Xuanfeng... all I wanted was to continue my Dao... to stand before them as an equal!"

Li Xuanfeng did not respond. Golden light gleamed in his eyes, and the Heavenly Gilded Helm on his body matched them in brilliance. Sharp, dazzling mana flowed from the Engraved Stone, and golden light shone behind him.

He had served as abbot of the Ning Family for many years. He had snuffed out countless lives with his own hand. He had no lack of secret techniques. When he ignited his essence and lifespan, his two Immortal Foundations erupted with radiance. His sheer might had reached terrifying heights.

Yet, Tang Shedu’s aura kept climbing. His shattered wrist turned to pulp between Li Xuanfeng’s fingers, yet it quickly reformed into a jade-like hand. His pupils flickered like stars in the dark clouds. He freed his halberd from the golden bow and swept it across his body. Li Xuanfeng leaped backward into the air, raised his bow, and notched several golden arrows.

Whummm... whummm... whummm...

Tang Shedu only watched him draw his bow, making no move to stop him. He allowed him to gather strength. Meanwhile, the white glow of his own halberd grew ever sharper as it rose to point into the sky.

Li Xuanfeng was now in the best condition of his life, the strongest he had ever been. Five golden arrows rested simultaneously upon his bowstring. The piercing hum of the arrows, amplified by his mana, traveled dozens of kilometers. The entirety of Chengshui Tomb fell silent.

"Hyah!"

Tang Shedu refused to back down, thunder bursting from his mouth as profound sounds echoed across the sky. Though karma now clung to him and he was tied to many buddhist connections, he had never specifically cultivated those spells, so he ultimately fell short by a fraction.

But this shortfall was only in comparison to Li Xuanfeng, who had ignited his life force and essence qi to fire an unprecedented, fully-empowered arrow. Instantly, every Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators below bled from the ears and their eyes filled with blood. Devil and immortal cultivators alike tumbled to the ground together, and even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had to catch themselves. The battlefield paused for a moment.

Dang...

Tang Shedu’s halberd arced upward in a sweep of platinum light, piercing into the skies. The five golden arrows above converged into one and fell from the thick clouds like a celestial meteor.

Clang...

The halberd in Tang Shedu’s hands bent like it was bearing the weight of a golden mountain, creaking under the strain. A split second later, it lost the battle and was sent flying away like a bolt from a heavy crossbow, slamming down into the ground with a resounding crash.

Boom!

Golden light pierced through Tang Shedu’s chest, chasing the clouds down into the tomb below. He coughed up golden blood, yet he held his head high. Both of his eyes had blasted from their sockets by overpowering Astral Qi. The shards of Astral Qi spiraled through the air behind him, trailing strings of bead-like golden blood.

Tang Shedu let out two peals of laughter. His eyes had disintegrated, yet two new ones sprang from his sockets, rolling once before flashing with a savage gleam, "Yuan Xiu planned this carefully. It must be that long-missing Situ Jun he chose, a late stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. You took that pill and now stand at the pinnacle of Jiangnan's Foundation Establishment Realm. Quite formidable!

"With such might, perhaps only a few in the grotto heavens could surpass you. But alas... alas... it came at the cost of your path to the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Murong En's face burned under the brilliance of the two men before him, his heart filled with gloom. Though he wasn’t a prince of the Murong Family, he had always considered himself exceptional. Never before had he been left on the sidelines like this, unable to intervene. He could only look up at them.

The clouds above were now in utter chaos. Demonic flames billowed as immortal light barely held on. Suddenly, Murong En spotted a middle-aged man flying through the wind. He held a small jade seal in both hands and tossed it into the sky.

"That is..."

Murong En was briefly stunned, but the Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing on his chest began to throb wildly, as though reuniting with an old friend. It pulsed and jumped in his chest, transmitting a thought, Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal.

"Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal?"

He watched as the man hurled the dharma seal upward. The unassuming jade seal soared into the churning black clouds and the man’s voice suddenly rang out, "Pristine Heaven’s Pool Below!"

Li Xuanfeng was fully focused on his opponent as he stood with bow drawn, when he saw a small seal rocket into the skies. That spirit artifact was unmistakable, it was Yuan Su's Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal!

Li Xuanfeng’s heart sank slightly as the drifting artifact descended before him. The feathered serpent engraved upon it was so vivid and lifelike and its eyes so domineering and arrogant, that it felt as if it would leap out the next moment.

Hua-la-la...

The gray mist ahead receded, the demonic aura scattered, and a sound like rushing rain filled the air. Tang Shedu gazed skyward with a grim face as azure rain poured down. The sky had turned a hazy blue and misty ice rain fell. A pool of blue water spread beneath their feet.

The rippling pool spread outward, revealing faint, hazy reflections. Murong En, along with all the devil and immortal cultivators, vanished from sight. Only Li Xuanfeng and Tang Shedu remained within this blue-tinted world.

The great seal expanded to the size of a desk. Where the surface had once been blank, four elegant azure seal script words now appeared—delicate and graceful, with soft, flowing brushstrokes.

Eastern Sea Pristine Plume.

A beam of blue light poured down from above like a pillar, drenching the unarmed Tang Shedu. It froze him like a statue. Countless strands of azure light crept along his garments, flowing down into the illusory pool beneath his feet.

The stern man in platinum armor stood before him. With an effortless motion of his ape-like arm, a golden-red rune-carved arrow leapt from his quiver and settled obediently onto the bowstring.

Brilliant red-gold radiance gathered upon the string, like the convergence of ten thousand rays of light. Yet all of it flowed into that single arrow, which was aimed steadily at the center of Tang Shedu’s brow.

Tang Shedu lifted his head in panic, staring at Li Xuanfeng. No matter how the situation had turned, his opponent’s eyes had always been as cold and unyielding as stone. Now too, there was no triumph and no pity. There was only a look of focus.

The crisis of death loomed in his heart. Tang Shedu could even hear a myriad of quarrels buzzing in his ears. Water and fire intertwined before his eyes while gold and stone clashed in brilliance. Seven rainbow-colored mountains hung in the sky, and five divine ladders descended into the blue light to receive him.

Just a little faster...




# Chapter 807: Severing Fate

Li Xuanfeng held his profound bow level, as golden-red light spilled from the arrow. Several crimson streaks brushed past his cheek, the light on the profound arrow flowing vividly. Even before it struck, a bead of blood the size of a red bean had already welled up on Tang Shedu’s forehead.

Clang!

At this point in the battle, he gave Tang Shedu no chance to speak and said not a word himself. He relaxed his fingers, and a red-gold light flared brightly in the azure sky.

Hum... hum...

The golden-red profound arrow flickered once in the air, then vanished. The whispering blue rain paused momentarily, hesitating in the sky, before once again blanketing the azure waters below.

Tang Shedu was immobilized within the cyan radiance, his mana surging from his body. His pupils dilated, but he could only raise his hands a palm's width apart on either side. His eyes were filled with nothing but the gold-red light.

"You..."

Only now did he understand why Daoist Master Yuan Su commanded such respect. Just a single divine ability cultivated at the early stage of the Purple Mansion Realm was enough to make others wary. The might of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was utterly terrifying.

"Damn it."

Even if the golden-red arrow had given him a chance to dodge, he might not have been able to avoid it. But he was pinned in place by the cyan light, and felt as if an iron nail was being driven into his brow, sending a stabbing pain through him.

Boom!

Just then, the five colorful clouds Tang Shedu had vaguely seen became clearer. Five radiant stairways crisscrossed in the sky, colliding with one another, only to be momentarily stalled by the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal.

"Damn it!" exclaimed Tang Shedu.

Blue raindrops pattered down as the feathered serpent in the sky closed its eyes. The glowing azure characters of Eastern Sea Pristine Plume slowly dimmed, and the cyan light pillar dissolved into rain.

Thud!

Tang Shedu collapsed to his knees, the color draining from his robes and armor, leaving only two glimmers of light. There was no distinction between sky and water in the Pristine Heaven’s Pool Below, where he knelt powerlessly between the azure sky and sea.

Ting... ting, ting-ting...

His eyes were screwed shut as a series of sharp impacts rang out from his body. It was the buzzing clangor of metal and iron. A line cracked open across his face with a crack, releasing a howling golden wind that peeled away two shriveled strips of flesh.

His magical body seemed like an overinflated hide, splitting apart bit by bit along lines of golden light. Tang Shedu slowly opened his mouth wide, and golden-red brilliance gushed from his lips, ears, and nostrils and erupted into dazzling color in midair.

Cough, cough, cough...

Li Xuanfeng coughed repeatedly as thick golden dust fell softly from between his lips and teeth. Dark blood flowed from his eyes, turning into round, gleaming golden beads that rolled off his cheeks with soft clinks.

Yet his hands did not stop. Five golden profound arrows leapt up once again, falling into his palms in sequence. The azure light before him began to twist and distort. Li Xuanfeng felt a sharp pain in his eyes as a hazy brilliance descended from the heavens.

Everything before him fragmented into a blur, revealing boundless, ethereal golden clouds. Figures of varied expressions sat within them. There were men and women, some smiling enchantingly, others glaring with fury, others still rejoicing with delight...

This hazy light was merely the ladder by which the Mahas, the Merciful Ones, sought to receive Tang Shedu. It brushed gently across the Heavenly Pool, but much of its power had been diminished by the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, so it only drifted softly down over the two of them.

Tang Shedu’s shattered flesh slowly reformed, while Li Xuanfeng, who was only lightly grazed, heard his spirit armor emit sharp grinding noises. His entire body felt as if it was being pierced by ten thousand blades, and he felt his mana draining into a bottomless void until utterly depleted.

His eyes were half-closed, filled only with blood-red light. A deep voice echoed amid the blurry sounds around him, as if spoken by ten thousand in unison, calm and serene, "Shedu... have you... seen clearly?"

The voice gently reverberated through the air. A wave of warmth welled up in Li Xuanfeng’s heart, and for some reason, he felt tears rising to his eyes. The chorus of ten thousand voices continued to echo, growing sharper with each repetition.

Tang Shedu forced his eyes open. "I've seen it clearly... seen it clearly... seen it clearly!"

The voice from above settled into the space, harmonizing with its own echo, as though he stood in a grand hall of chanting voices resounding all around, "You have overcome poison and endured envy, suffered ten thousand blades and the torment of karma. Now, you cast off evil and embrace righteousness with full awakening. A single gleam of golden light returns to your heart. You may now enter my Buddhist Dao."

The voice stabbed into Li Xuanfeng’s ears, causing golden blood to stream from them, but he understood the message clearly. The northern and southern Daoist lineages had plunged Xu State into chaos. In this karmic place, Tang Shedu had seized the moment, leveraging the conflict's spiritual momentum to ascend. He had done so to the extent that even a Maha had been moved to personally come and guide his transformation!

"Join the Northern Sect of Buddhism, attain one Dao among the seven... and you shall achieve the grand fruition."

The voice boomed thunderously. Li Xuanfeng held his golden bow steady as mist-like multicolored light descended from the heavens, floating gently down onto Tang Shedu. His flesh began to shine with crystalline clarity as it was blessed.

The golden armor faded from Tang Shedu's body, leaving his forehead smooth and white as if he'd returned to his original mortal form. He pressed his hands together in prayer and was about to speak, but suddenly stopped.

Dong...

The hazy multicolored light before them was abruptly severed cleanly in two. A delicate hand, like white jade, emerged from the great void into the azure rain and gently clasped the floating Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal.

The ten-thousand-voice chant vanished in an instant. The golden clouds dimmed, and a female cultivator in purple robes stood amidst the blue rain. She gazed down indifferently through delicate brows and cold eyes.

She stepped fully into view, casually holding the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. The spirit artifact glowed obediently in her grasp.

Her red lips parted as she spoke softly, "That old bald donkey is putting on his tricks again."

As her words rang out, the azure pond beneath her erupted in chaos, roiling and leaping violently. It surged across five hundred kilometers, sweeping away all the multicolored light and giving rise to waves of purple clouds instead.

"Daoist Zipei... this man is fated with the Northern Sect of Buddhism..."

Li Xuanfeng immediately felt relief in his ears and eyes as the purple clouds billowed upward. He recognized the purple-robed female cultivator in the sky as none other than Daoist Master Zipei of the Purple Smoke Gate.

This Daoist Master had old ties with Daoist Master Yuan Su. It was she who handed the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal to Ning Heyuan. She was a peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator and a pillar of the Purple Smoke Gate.

"Why are you doing this?!" A low, rumbling voice filled with restrained anger rang in Li Xuanfeng's ears. Fortunately, the purple mist had blocked most of the pressure, and what reached him was tolerable.

Daoist Master Zipei stood in midair, arms folded, and said lightly, "Pi Jia, I say he is without fate."

Her tone was calm, like stating a fact, giving not the slightest face to the Maha Pi Jia. The colorful clouds offered no reply, leaving only a terrifying silence hanging in the air.

The drizzling azure rain fell into the blue waters, causing ripples that collided with one another. A Maha and a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator stood in quiet confrontation within the Pristine Heaven’s Pool Below, under the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal until, at last, the chorus of ten thousand voices resounded from the multicolored clouds, "Zipei, Azure Pond has lost the disciple, and then he lost again to this bow-wielding man. From wild joy to bitter envy, this child must now fall from Jinlian and into my grasp. Such is the natural order.

"Suiguan stands by with folded arms, why then do you, Daoist friend, step in for him?"

Zipei's voice, as always, was cool and distant. But as she spoke, the violet qi around her surged and rippled, "I’ve been in secluded cultivation for many years, long troubled by doubts over destiny. Now though on the verge of a breakthrough, I still cannot let it go. So I’ve taken this chance to test it, even if there’s reason or no reason."

Since Daoist Master Zipei was approaching her breakthrough, Maha Pi Jia clearly had no desire to quarrel with her. He merely responded in a heavy tone, "And what does Daoist friend intend?"

"You say he is fated, and I say he is not." Daoist Master Zipei tossed the jade seal in her hand, speaking softly, "Why don’t you and I, Maha Pi Jia, resolve this? Does this man truly share destiny with your Northern Buddhist Sect or not?"

"Oh?" Maha Pi Jia’s tone noticeably softened, clearly confident in this matter. Buddhist cultivators were, after all, most adept at manipulating fate. What need had he to fear a mere Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? He sneered inwardly but replied in a tone as warm as ten thousand voices, "So Daoist friend wishes for me to resolve this fate, how splendid indeed."

His voice threaded through the clouds and pressed against the violet qi, causing it to surge turbulently. He said, "Though you have broken his foundation and returned him to mortal flesh, all the threads of destiny have already gathered upon him. As long as he lives, ascending to the Merciful One’s seat would take but a moment.

"You are beyond the bounds of fate, and your divine powers vast. So long as you do not kill him, then in six seconds, he shall be guided by countless forces and take his place among the Merciful Ones."

"Very well." Daoist Master Zipei nodded, but then she asked, "And if he does not?"

Maha Pi Jia’s voice paused briefly, and grew more cautious as he asked, "What does the Daoist Master mean by that?"

"I shall take back the Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing," replied Daoist Master Zipei. She stared quietly at him.

The rainbow clouds around Maha Pi Jia roiled heavily, and after two seconds of silence, his resounding voice echoed, "This Honored One would gaze upon that volume, the Taixu Violet Qi Manual."

For the first time, a mocking smile appeared on Daoist Master Zipei’s face, "You have always been insatiably greedy, you bald old monk. Even if I could give it, would you dare to look?"

Maha Pi Jia was not angered. His voice seemed to slowly relax, as if he trusted her even more, and he hummed in reply, "Then let it be the Purple Essence Radiant Canopy."

Daoist Master Zipei gave him a deep look and nodded slightly, "I will not strike him. If he cannot ascend to the Dharma Realm within six seconds, then let it be deemed he is without fate."

Maha Pi Jia nodded softly, and in that moment, a streak of violet light leapt from Zipei’s hand toward the colored clouds. The dense purple aura that had silently filled the Pristine Heaven’s Pool Below rose as one and crashed into the clouds:

Boom!

She struck without warning. Violet light and energy surged forth together, slamming into the multicolored clouds and disrupting the Maha’s spiritual connection, but Maha Pi Jia was not alarmed.

He was delighted as he said, "I have long awaited for this, Daoist Master!"

It was clear Maha Pi Jia had anticipated this. Golden rays rose from within the colored clouds, swirling and surging, forcefully dispersing the boiling violet clouds and causing waves to ripple through the Great Void.

"You simply seek to hinder my Dharma Realm. In the end, this is but a duel of techniques! Think you can block my spiritual connection for six seconds? You truly underestimate me..." said Pi Jia.

The chaotic drone of chanting swirled through the sea of clouds. Violet light rose like a sun and burst forth with a boom. Maha’s words came to an abrupt halt, leaving only the purple radiance overwhelming the skies. Finally, the flowing golden light revealed its true form.

A golden figure of a man emerged in the sky, shrouded in hazy violet smoke. Hundreds of radiant gazes beamed from him. The chant of ten thousand voices continued without interruption, while lotus petals drifted down in a shower of soft pinks.

Daoist Master Zipei stood gracefully in her flowing purple robes, hands behind her back, watching in silence. She raised a slender hand and pushed, causing the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal before her to blaze with brilliance, sending waves of Pristine Water light rippling and spreading through the air.

In her hands, the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was a far cry from when Ning Heyuan wielded it. Its cyan brilliance flew out with nine trailing flames, contracting into a massive formation in the sky and slowly pressing downward.

The Maha’s true body, along with his multicolored clouds, was sealed within. A full second passed before there was movement. The pounding within made the seal tremble ceaselessly. A sliver of golden light burst forth as Maha Pi Jia coldly growled, "Good... Daoist Zipei, your strength has truly grown!"

His colored clouds gradually flowed out from the cyan light, pressing down over the violet mist once again. Maha Pi Jia’s voice sounded like ten thousand chanting in unison as it echoed across the sky, "But you truly overestimated yourself. To think you didn’t even bring the Purple Essence Radiant Canopy, did you mistake me for a clay statue?"

He withdrew from the cyan light as his words rang out. His multicolored brilliance surged skyward, intending to reach Tang Shedu. The entire skirmish had cost him no more than five seconds.

His true form emerged beneath the violet clouds, where dozens of indistinct, densely packed eyes appeared. A few deep, satisfied laughs escaped him. But before his voice could echo through the seal, a faint sound arose from below the dense violet mist.

Crack...

The Maha’s smile froze in an instant. Though the sound was delicate, it struck his ears like thunder. The violet cloud churned and scattered, revealing the azure waters below.

Hmm?

Li Xuanfeng’s lips were smeared with golden blood. Though the rainbow light had grazed him, leaving his entire body feeling like it had been pierced by ten thousand blades and his vision unclear, his ears had locked onto Tang Shedu’s breathing, and he had lunged like a tiger.

Tang Shedu had just seen Li Xuanfeng collapse, with colors swirling in the air. He had taken only a single step back, but as a mere mortal, where could he flee? His throat had been constricted as he was lifted high into the air.

Li Xuanfeng had seized Tang Shedu in one motion, raising him into the air. Without hesitation, his five fingers squeezed down.

Crack.

Tang Shedu hadn’t even drawn another breath before his neck snapped. Disbelief filled his gaze. Maha Pi Jia cleared the violet mist just in time to see Tang Shedu’s head droop limply. A surge of Astral Qi inflated his body like a balloon, carving the insides clean.

In less than a second, Tang Shedu was reduced to dust from head to toe. If he was sufficiently prepared, Li Xuanfeng’s Astral Qi could even prevent a sorcerer from reincarnating, let alone a mortal. Tang Shedu was utterly obliterated.

Maha Pi Jia needed no explanation as he took in the scene. The illusionary Pristine Heaven’s Pool conjured by the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal fell utterly silent. Even the soft sound of rain had vanished, leaving only the whistling of golden wind echoing through the clouds.

Maha Pi Jia’s smile slowly faded. He finally understood why the violet qi had remained so heavy. It had merely been to veil everything below.

Zipei stood calmly in the clouds, arms folded, as the purple light and mist drifted back into her sleeves. Her voice was cool, "It seems this man and your Dao truly lack the destined bond."




# Chapter 809: Great Defeat

Maha Pi Jia's figure withdrew back into the multicolored clouds, layers of gazes retracting with him, leaving only his vast, resonant voice, "Zipei, how could you do this?!"

When Maha Pi Jia had manifested in this world, he had deliberately brushed the archer with divine radiance. How could such brilliance, used to receive one into the Dharma Realm, be something a mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator could resist? He should have lost his mind long ago!

If not for finding this archer rather intriguing, that sweep of divine light would have reduced Li Xuanfeng to dust. But Maha Pi Jia had restrained himself, thinking that even if he couldn't tame him, he could leave him as karmic destiny for Tang Shedu to achieve The Merciful One.

It was with all that planning and restraint that he had left Li Xuanfeng alive. The amount of radiance had been calculated to perfection. It should have moved Li Xuanfeng to tears and planted a seed in his heart that would one day sprout.

Who could have imagined it would turn out like this? Li Xuanfeng’s condition was completely different from what his calculations had predicted. Startled and doubtful, Maha Pi Jia’s thoughts surged like a tide. An instant later, he reacted, causing the clouds to shift and roll.

Did Zipei strike early? thought the Maha.

Maha Pi Jia dismissed the thought without hesitation. Though there were differences among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, Zipei practiced Immortal Mansion secret techniques and possessed first-rate spirit artifacts. But these were all meant for frontal combat. Even three Zipeis combined wouldn’t rival him when it came to scheming and calculation...

If Zipei had intervened to protect Li Xuanfeng or assisted him secretly, there was no way he wouldn’t have seen it. Moreover, the result could not have aligned so cleanly with Li Xuanfeng remaining unconscious and unable to act, just as he had calculated.

His thoughts leapt across the great void in an instant, and everything became painfully clear, It was Jinlian and Zhelu!

Only another Maha’s intervention would be able to conceal everything so flawlessly and fool even him. The combined efforts of Jinlian and Zhelu, who had accompanied him south, were more than enough to throw off his calculations!

Maha Pi Jia’s gaze sank into the clouds as he swiftly unraveled the clues. Zipei’s seemingly playful and death-seeking gestures had been mere misdirection. The female cultivator had reached a tacit agreement with the two Mahas and had plotted against him...

As for how the other two had acted earlier than him despite appearing slower, Maha Pi Jia could easily guess that it must have been the unseen efforts of Yuan Xiu and Qiushui. Jinlian and Zhelu had fought just as fiercely against him earlier for Tang Shedu, so it made perfect sense they would be just as unwilling for Tang Shedu to fall into his hands now. That didn’t surprise Maha Pi Jia. What truly caught him off guard was Daoist Master Zipei’s stance.

Be it Yuan Su, Yuan Xiu, even Qiushui or Tiandong, these so-called Daoist Masters always held themselves above others and were never willing to compromise with us... And now they’re working in sync with Jinlian and Zhelu?!

I misjudged only one thing... Qi Wang’s Profound Heaven Hearing is far more important than I had imagined! Even Jinlian and Zhelu realized it only after the fact, but by then it was too late for regrets...

Yet there was no anger in Pi Jia's voice, only a silent faint chill in the air as he spoke, “Fellow Daoists, you've all schemed so thoroughly against me, simply because Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing is that important... purple, gold and demonic Daos are truly impressive. To leave it in my hands for a hundred years while pretending not to care, that's the very embodiment of the elegance of the demonic Dao.”

Daoist Master Zipei arched her willow-leaf brows slightly and uttered just a few words, "Bald donkey. Will you deliver it yourself, or shall I come and take it?"

Maha Pi Jia's voice grew somewhat ethereal, reverberating as it scattered amidst the blue rain, "Suit yourself, Daoist Master."

The colorful clouds in the sky rolled back and gradually faded into the great void. The blue rain overhead grew increasingly illusory. Li Xuanfeng’s vision cleared at last, and he looked up at the two streaks of descending multicolored light.

"Congratulations, Daoist Master Zipei," said Li Xuanfeng.

One light and one shadow appeared within the great void. The stern, aged face of Yuan Xiu appeared first. His robes were as neat and proper as ever, imbued with flowing azure. Though clearly the youngest among them, he had never preserved his looks, thus appearing older than he was.

The other figure was naturally Daoist Master Qiushui of the Golden Feather Sect. The female cultivator swept her sleeve, casting a burst of golden light that suppressed Li Xuanfeng’s injuries before she finally spoke, "Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing... fortunately, not too many complications arose."

Daoist Master Zipei nodded, showing Zhang Qiushui a rare bit of warmth as she said softly, "Pi Jia is still young. He’s still unseasoned compared to those two old bald donkeys, Jinlian and Zhelu. Catching him off guard made things easier to manipulate."

Daoist Yuan Xiu beckoned, and Li Xuanfeng’s golden bow shot into his hand. With a slight tug, a streak of colored light leapt from the bow and returned to his palm.

"Merely going with the flow."

Yuan Xiu flicked his wrist with a trace of distaste and shattered the colored light. When he withdrew his hand, the golden bow floated back into Li Xuanfeng’s grip—neither heavier nor lighter than before. It seemed no different to the eye.

Li Xuanfeng understood. When he had exited seclusion, this bow had just been repaired and handed to him by Chi Zhiyan. It had surely been tampered with beforehand so that it could be used in the scheme against the Maha.

"Tang Shedu... had long been seen through. Nothing more than a pawn..."

Azure light sank fully back into the seal as the three Daoists conversed. The Pristine Heaven’s Pool beneath their feet faded, revealing once more the sinister demonic qi of Chengshui Tomb.

Using the mana he had just stabilized, Li Xuanfeng rode the wind and stood firm above a swamp of glistening rainwater. The demonic aura rolled through the air, and the Azure Pond Sect cultivators were nowhere to be seen.

"Li Xuanfeng!"

As he looked into the distance, searching for traces of his kin, a sinister shout rang out. A surge of thick demonic qi swept forth, shrouded in pitch-black magical light.

Murong En burst forth from the depths of Chengshui Tomb. Moments ago, he had fought within the seal and naturally targeted the Azure Pond Sect cultivators. He had crushed them all and was now brimming with pride.

When he saw Li Xuanfeng's dull armor, his faint breath, pale face, and nearly depleted mana, he immediately burst into laughter, "And what can you do now?"

Though Murong En didn’t know what had transpired within the seal, Maha Pi Jia’s radiance had just retreated, and it was almost certain that Tang Shedu had entered the Dharma Realm. Since Li Xuanfeng had survived, he was likely on their side now.

Though Murong En had formed his own conclusions, he remained cautious, merely rising on the wind and observing from afar. Li Xuanfeng, noticing that he didn’t seem to see the three Daoist Masters standing before him, lowered his head slightly in silence. He understood the demon was finished.

Since Maha Pi Jia agreed to hand over Qi Wang’s Profound Heaven Hearing, Murong En must have been abandoned.

As expected, Daoist Yuan Xiu glanced at Murong En and nodded, "Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing."

Daoist Master Qiushui smiled faintly and spoke gently, "I'll do it."

A faint smile lingered on her face as her red lips moved slightly, as though casually summoning a household servant. Her voice was crisp and gentle, "You, demon—come here."

Li Xuanfeng watched closely as Murong En seemed to suddenly hear something. He tilted his head as if listening intently. A red-gray glow flared behind his head.

The demon had taken on human form. His thick brows rose, his eyes widened, lips pressed tight, and he scrambled forward, tripping and crawling in his panic.

The three Daoist Masters watched in silence. Murong En solemnly lifted his robe and performed a deep ceremonial bow. Forming his hand into a blade, he drew twice across his chest, then reached into his chest. He fumbled briefly before yanking out a dark, blackened heart.

"In obedience to the immortal command of the honored Daoist Master!"

The heart still billowed with demonic qi. Murong En clutched it tightly, as though it weren’t his own, then quickly drew a blade from his waist. One hand held the heart aloft, the other forcefully plunged a knife into it.

Squelch...

A gray wind swept through the sky, rustling with eerie whispers. Li Xuanfeng’s heart skipped a beat as he saw the wind blow in from the east. The few remaining plants at his feet bowed low, it was a sign of someone's fall.

Murong En nonchalantly took his own life as if it were only natural. Even after tearing out his heart, some awareness remained in his mind. Murong En hastily reached into his body with two fingers, retrieved a pearl-sized azure orb, and wiped the demonic aura off of it. He then knelt respectfully and offered it up with both hands.

Zipei gently beckoned with her hand, and Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing flew into her palm. She lifted it for a close look. Beside her, Murong En’s demonic body began to collapse, yet he maintained his respectful posture. Black mist, thick as a waterfall, poured from his body and spilled into the air.

"Qi Wang’s Profound Heaven Hearing... After a hundred years, it is finally back in our hands."

None of the three Daoist Masters cast a single glance at him. Demonic mist drifted beneath their feathered robes and jade boots, shrouding Chengshui Tomb in darkness.

Boom!

A sudden thunderclap split the sky, illuminating the surroundings. Three beams of multicolored light stood atop the demonic clouds. Yet, the once arrogant and unbridled devil cultivator lay dead like a dog, silent and unnoticed.

Li Xuanfeng looked down in silence as rain poured from the sky. Beneath his feet, Chengshui Tomb had already turned into marshland when Daoist Master Zipei used the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. Now it was a flooded expanse, rippling with dark light.

Thunder roared across the sky. He watched the three beams of multicolored light flicker in and out of the white lightning. Murong En’s demonic aura still clung to his spirit boots.

As thunder crashed again, he suddenly heard Daoist Yuan Xiu’s deep voice, "The one that fell... is the Great Ning Palace."

————

The geomantic lines of Chengshui Tomb shifted without rest. Water veins surged, and water droplets formed everywhere in the dark cliffside cave dwellings. Rain pattered down without end, pouring furiously into the depths and vanishing into the black underground.

Li Qinghong took a medicinal pill and adjusted her breath for a while until her complexion visibly improved. Li Xizhi and Li Quantao were both in poor condition, and the elder Yu Yuwei looked equally grim.

They were currently in a corner of Chengshui Tomb. Li Qinghong had fought her way out through waves of demonic qi, fleeing all the way to this subterranean ravine before things slightly stabilized.

She had once sought thunder essence here years ago and had leased a cave dwelling in the area for her family. Now, when the group fled into this ravine, she led them to that same cave to take refuge.

"Fellow Daoist Qinghong... we’re in serious trouble now..." Yu Yuwei’s voice was hoarse, but he was only stating what everyone already understood.

Tang Shedu’s betrayal may have been within the calculations of certain Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, but the extent of the damage was unknown. However, what was certain was the blow it dealt to the allied cultivators.

He had revealed the deployment of their forces to the devil cultivators. Over a dozen Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had been picked off one by one and their forces had been nearly annihilated. The reinforcing devil cultivators had surrounded Lingu Lanying, Zhuang Cheng, and several others.

The outcome of the aerial clash between Li Xuanfeng and Tang Shedu remained unknown. But Murong En had descended on devil winds, and those who were already struggling stood no chance against him. They had suffered a heavy blow and scattered in all directions.

"We don’t even know how many might still be alive..." said Li Qinghong.

Li Qinghong closed her eyes. Kongheng was a buddhist cultivator of the ancient ways. He was not offensively strong, but he should be able to survive the chaos. Li Wushao, on the other hand, was much more uncertain. Whether he could escape was unclear.

She didn’t believe Tang Shedu could defeat Li Xuanfeng. But she was worried that Li Xuanfeng might linger after killing him and get swarmed by the devil cultivators. But even setting aside his condition, returning to rescue him would likely only lead to more deaths.

Since she had gone to rescue Li Xizhi, she hadn’t been caught in the encirclement nor encountered Murong En. The fact she managed to break through and escape with a few others was already a stroke of luck. There was no going back now.

As she pondered all this, she heard Yu Yuwei speak in a low voice, "Have any of you seen Yu Su bringing his forces this way?"

According to the Azure Pond Sect's plan, Li Xuanfeng and Tang Shedu should have joined forces to rout the devil cultivators, while Yu Su would lead troops north along the only remaining southern path from Chengshui Tomb. He would be perfectly positioned to cut off fleeing enemies and support the two.

But when the cultivators fled south, they encountered devil cultivators everywhere. The more they fought, the more enemies appeared. They had been forced to hide in this location, yet not a single trace of Yu Su’s forces was anywhere to be seen...

Li Xizhi slowly opened his eyes and said quietly, "Do you recall that the Murong Family was supposed to have two members present? Yet we only saw Murong En. Where did the other one go?"

A chill settled in his heart as he continued, "I'm afraid Tang Shedu leaked information and Yu Su was likely ambushed on the road. Perhaps he even defected. In any case, that force is probably scattered. If that’s true, Mount Yan Pass is in grave danger."

Li Xizhi pointed to the south. Yu Yuwei stood up and walked to the cave entrance. When he saw columns of demonic smoke rising over Mount Yan Pass in the distance, he waved his sleeve and returned inside, saying hoarsely, "Xizhi’s guess was dead on."

Li Quantao finally realized where the missing Murong Family devil cultivator had gone. After a moment of silence, he suddenly realized that the southern road was entirely overrun by demonic forces and murmured, "If Mount Yan Pass falls, heading south is a dead end. If it's taken, our only path is to follow the river all the way around to Baixiang Valley... and who knows how many devil cultivators we'll face along the way."

"Baixiang Valley may not even be safe!" said Yu Yuwei roughly.

After he spoke, Li Quantao murmured softly, "What are the Daoist Masters really thinking..."

"What should we think?" Yu Yuwei let out a deep sigh from his throat, his aged face caught between fury and sorrow as he said in a raspy voice, "Do we even need to think? Too many in Jiangnan have died. The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters must have bargained with the demonic cultivators for enough benefits. Perhaps it was a spirit artifact, a grotto heaven, or some mystical cultivation method...

"You think we just suffer these losses for no reason? And those Purple Mansion Realm figures would just stand and watch? The ones who keep dying are never their direct descendants, so what can’t they bring themselves to do? A hundred years from now, the Purple Mansion Realm will be theirs, not ours. In the end, we’re just ashes. What use are we to them?"

The nearly three-hundred-year-old man had seen far too much. His words sent chills down everyone’s spine. Li Quantao stared at him quietly, and then fell into sudden silence.




# Chapter 811: Chimen Difu

Yu Yuwei’s voice was low, but it echoed through the cave dwelling, causing the young man to pause. Li Quantao’s lips trembled, and a blush rose to his still-recovering face.

He turned his head slightly and said softly, “None of them are good people. My father was ruined by Chi Wei, trapped on the mountain for life and unable to take a single step out. He was forced to refine pills like a drug slave. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have always been the most heartless of all.”

The group sat in helpless silence inside the cave. Yu Yuwei coughed twice, his expression unreadable, and replied quietly, “Quantao, we might not make it out alive this time. I don’t have many years left either, so let me be frank. If the one who had been injured and trapped in the secret realm back then had been Li Encheng, and he had formed his Purple Mansion Realm, he would have been even more terrifying than Chi Wei.”

Li Quantao already held some resentment toward the old man. When he heard this, his expression froze, and anger surged up. He abruptly stood up. The entanglement between Li Encheng and Chi Wei was old history.

Forcing himself to restrain his anger, he spoke coldly, “What are you talking about, senior?! What about how Yu Yuxie was harmed? This is heartless and unjust! Even if you bear no hatred toward him, how can you speak well of him? My father had his faults, but it is not your place to judge!”

Yu Yuwei sighed and replied, “You are nothing like Li Encheng... There’s no point dredging up these old, moldy matters. I have long come to terms with it. And let’s be honest, when you and I look upon those in the Qi Cultivation or Embryonic Breathing Realms, do we treat them any better? From our position, if sacrificing a few unrelated cultivators meant gaining treasures like the Qi Wang’s Profound Heaven Hearing or the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, would you take the chance or not?”
𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎

Li Quantao opened his mouth but fell silent. Yu Yuwei chuckled. “Don’t talk to me about how heartless the Purple Mansion Realm is. The esteemed families whip tenant farmers, cultivators trample those in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and human blood becomes fine spirit medicine. Immortal Foundations consume it to unlock divine arts... It has been nothing but blood and tears for over a thousand years. Ruthlessness is the true path of the immortals.”

The old man sat in the cave with arms folded, his words drawing a sideways glance from Li Xizhi. Veteran cultivators like Yu Yuwei had witnessed three centuries of rises and falls, so he must have many stories.

“It’s just... not the time for such talk yet.”

Li Xizhi glanced twice at the map in his hand and said solemnly, “Mount Yan Pass likely won’t hold. This place has become too devil-infested, and more devil cultivators will surely follow. As dangerous as it is, the earlier we leave, the greater our chances of survival.”

Li Qinghong nodded in agreement, pondered for a few breaths, and said softly, “I once cultivated here. If you head directly east from this place, there should be a cave dwelling situated within the earth veins to the east of Chengshui Tomb. That cave dwelling connects to a water vein that leads all the way to the Eastern Sea.

“Though this land is now tainted by demonic forces, if we follow the water vein and emerge in the Eastern Sea, we can ride the wind all the way to Splitreed Island and return via the Shallow Sea.”

Li Xizhi checked the location she indicated; it was only a quarter-hour’s flight away. He looked at the other two and asked, “What do the two of you think?”

Yu Yuwei and Li Quantao naturally couldn’t think of a better plan and both nodded in agreement. As the group left the cave dwelling, Li Quantao muttered, “It’s a pity we don’t have a single stealth dharma artifact among us... otherwise, we wouldn’t need to go through all this trouble...”

His words reminded Li Qinghong. Under Li Yuanjiao’s control, her Profound Patterned Bottle could conceal traces, but in her own hands it could only emit thunder and store arcane lightning.

“Unfortunately, none of us possess the Boundless Ocean technique. Still, it would only be enough to hide one person anyway.”

Since she had lightning beneath her feet and her cyan feathered robe, the Cyan Sparrow Plume, enhancing her, she was the fastest among them. Li Xizhi traveled with Heavenly Glow and was nearly as quick, but they still had to slow down to wait for Li Quantao and Yu Yuwei.

They had barely flown a dozen kilometers when the scenery turned grim. Demonic energy rolled like mist, and the original black locust trees and white-stone tombs had vanished. Murky waters spread out below their feet, and skeletal remains floated faintly on the surface.

“Chengshui Tomb... it should be called Chengshui Swamp from now on...”

Two beams of demonic light rose from afar and dove into the swamp. White smoke rose with them, and people came and went. They did not resemble a patrol, but more like panicked cultivators.

Several devil cultivators streaked northward through the clouds on wind. They passed just half a kilometer from the group, leaving thick black mist in their wake.

Li Xizhi’s heart stirred at the chaotic scene. He exchanged a glance with Li Qinghong; both of them had noticed something unusual about the devil cultivators, and thought, A good opportunity...

They skimmed across the water’s surface, weaving past the tips of locust trees jutting out, covering most of the distance before finally encountering two Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivators.

“Did a few lords arrive just now? For Murong En to die like that... and for there to be not a single whisper of news...”

The two devil cultivators were flying east while conversing intently. One looked suspicious, and the other replied, “Hard to say. All I heard is that Tuoba retreated, and someone from the Helian Family arrived. Even the lord from the Shilou Family showed up despite the tough situation... Don’t you think it’s almost certain that there’s another treasure involved.”

The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had concealed themselves, of course, so these low-level Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators didn’t sense a thing. Li Quantao glanced at them and sent a voice transmission through mana, Shall we capture them for questioning?

Yu Yuwei gently shook his head. They were deep in hostile territory, and were only a few kilometers from the cave dwelling. They didn’t need unnecessary trouble, so they flew past without drawing attention.

The dark water rippled as Li Qinghong came to a stop at one spot and examined it carefully. Though Chengshui Tomb was now completely flooded and the terrain unrecognizable, her spiritual sense probed the depths and quickly confirmed it against her memories. She had found the cave entrance.

The place was a wreck. The stone steps and stele at the entrance had been shattered and submerged. The black water concealed the bottom, so there was no telling if any devil cultivators were inside.

Li Qinghong and the others closed their eyes to probe further, only to sense that the two devil cultivators they had passed earlier were slowly catching up and hovering over the same stretch of water.

One tall and one thin, the two were chatting animatedly. The taller one, who had first spoken, looked puzzled and asked, “Which lord from the Shilou Family came?”

“Supposedly the Bo Lie King, Shilou Fu...”

The short devil cultivator responded with a nod, and the other man's expression immediately changed, showing caution as he asked quietly, “Apologies for troubling you, fellow cultivator... I was sent on an errand earlier and haven’t had a chance to ask around. I just wanted to know, does this lord consider himself a Hudi tribesman, or does he align with the northerners?”

The other devil cultivator raised his head, smiling faintly. The first cultivator immediately understood and hurriedly passed something over, at which point the other chuckled and said, “That’s easy enough to answer! Bo Lie Prefecture lies within Qi State. All of this lord’s trusted aides are northerners.”

“I see.”

The devil cultivator's eyes lit up as he replied, “Then we should respectfully refer to him as Gao Fu, and definitely avoid mentioning the Shilou Family...”

“You’re right... It all depends on his temper, but it’s best to err on the side of caution...”

When he heard the nervousness in their exchange, Li Xizhi needed no further confirmation. This Bo Lie King Gao Fu was very likely a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Tension stirred in his heart as he thought, More and more powerful cultivators are arriving from the north... It’s vast up there, nothing like Jiangnan...

Everyone exchanged glances, then looked to Li Xizhi. After all, capturing techniques were a specialty of his Heavenly Glow Art. No one present could match him in that regard. Even if they were just Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, it was still best to act decisively.

Li Xizhi understood at once. Two streaks of rainbow light leaped forth with a flick of his sleeve, diving into the water and darting forward like swimming serpents.

The two devil cultivators were standing still when suddenly, rainbow light surged from beneath their feet. Startled, they shot upward, but there was no escaping Li Xizhi’s preparation. The rainbow lights captured them in an instant.

A white mist immediately enveloped the two devil cultivators. They were both tossed about and their dharma artifacts knocked from their hands by Heavenly Glow. When their vision cleared, four daoists stood before them.

Four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators!

The two were so terrified the world spun around them. They exchanged a glance and began kowtowing frantically, begging for mercy. But Li Qinghong had no intention of wasting time. Two bolts of lightning danced in her hands and locked onto their brows. She was ready to strike in an instant.

Ignoring their panicked faces, she waved her hand to separate them and asked sternly, “How many cultivators are in the cave?”

“My lord...”

The two devil cultivators couldn’t see each other, preventing any chance of coordinating answers. Faced with a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator skilled in thunder arts, and already missing six of their seven souls, they didn’t dare lie.

They quickly answered, “My lord... the cave dwelling houses followers of Ancestor Difu... We don’t know what mission he accepted, but he’s stationed here. We’re just minor subordinates... We haven’t committed any killings... We just beg to live...”

Their answers were mostly consistent so Li Qinghong pressed further, “There’s only one devil leader? Any reinforcements nearby?”

She questioned them thoroughly. Although there weren’t many major devil cultivators in the area, this Ancestor Difu appeared to be a formidable one. He was an old devil cultivator who had wandered through Xu and Yue States for years, with unfathomably deep demonic arts.

However, with four cultivators on her side, Li Qinghong wasn’t afraid of a single devil cultivator. But if a fight broke out and drew the attention of others, that could be trouble.

After a moment of thought, she asked, “What else do you know about this devil? Where is he originally from?”

“Ancestor Difu’s surname is Chimen. He’s a devil cultivator from Zhao. Word is, he offended someone powerful in Zhao, so he’s been roaming around Xu and Yue States ever since...” replied one of the devil cultivators.

“Chimen.”

Li Qinghong pressed them with a few more questions. Chimen wasn’t a renowned clan in the north, which put her a bit at ease. Li Xizhi asked softly, “That Bo Lie King... has he already entered the great void?”

“Reporting to my lord, he most likely has...” replied one of the devil cultivators.

Yu Yuwei made a swift decision and said gravely, “We can’t delay any longer! Strike now, kill him, and flee toward the Eastern Sea. If we hesitate, we’ll surely lose our chance!”

With their decision made, two bolts of lightning tightly bound the captives. Li Qinghong took them and descended first on lightning, with the other three cautiously following her.

Glimmers of light quickly rose from the dark waters. Li Qinghong soon spotted the glow of mana-based illumination and, on closer look, realized it was merely a low-tier Qi Cultivation Realm formation.

She had brought the captives down with her in case the formation was tough and required deception to bypass. Unexpectedly, this Chimen Difu, despite being a longtime Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, was so penniless he still used an early stage Qi Cultivation Realm formation.

Then again, it makes sense... If he’s just using a temporary spot to rest for a month or two, why waste high-grade formations?

Reflecting on it, Li Qinghong realized that even she, with a notable background, was still using Qi Cultivation Realm formations. Chimen Difu wouldn’t be any better off.

It’s just that I’ve seen too many direct descendents, it seems I’ve gotten used to a higher standard.

Since they were no longer needed, two lightning bolts burst forth and reduced the devil cultivators to ash. Li Qinghong raised her Duruo Spear, and struck directly at the formation with one thrust.

Boom!

A white bolt of thunder exploded underwater, sending the black swamp water rushing in with a deafening roar. Behind her, Li Xizhi summoned a beam of Heavenly Glow to hold back the waters, then swept his sleeve to erase all noise.

Thus, the surface of the swamp remained still, mirroring the dark clouds above like a mirror. There was no trace of Foundation Establishment Realm activity that could be detected.

“Who’s there?!”

An old voice rang out in alarm and confusion; it was clearly Chimen Difu. Fierce black wind surged along the earth veins as the formation shattered like an eggshell, alerting the old devil.

As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Chimen Difu clearly hadn’t built the formation for defense. It was only an alarm. Once the group broke through, a vast subterranean chamber came into view.

Two devil cultivators had been guarding the gate, but now they leaped to their feet in terror. Their blood-colored light hadn’t even turned into escape light before Li Qinghong’s group was already upon them.

Boom!

Two blasts of dharma light shot toward them. A purple flame dragon roared and obliterated one into black smoke, while a bolt of lightning struck the other, turning him to ash.

Huff...
𝑓𝑟ℯ𝘦𝓌𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂

As dark clouds rolled through the cave, the remaining Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivators screamed and fled inside. Li Qinghong’s feathered robe lit up, streaks of blue-white light and thunder falling with her spear. She was blazing bright and unstoppable.

Yu Yuwei also understood the moment’s urgency. Water and fire lights surged from his body, and a violet-red cauldron flew out, summoning two purple dragons that swept through the black mist.

Li Quantao’s Water Wall Pearl lifted a curtain of white water that instantly dispersed the black fog, revealing an old man with a dazed expression.

“Ah?”

With Li Qinghong and Yu Yuwei striking in tandem, and Li Quantao and Li Xizhi assisting from the flanks, their combined strength was enough to shock even a newly reincarnated Tuoba Chongyuan. Though they were all injured, they had prepared well. Their assault was enough to shake the whole cave dwelling, sending stones crashing down.

Chimen Difu, garbed in black with snow-white hair, looked every bit the aged devil he was. He held a strange black ring in his hand, and his robes glimmered faintly with black light. His aged eyes were filled with terror and confusion. He nearly coughed up blood on the spot.

Purple flame dragons and crackling lightning intertwined before him. One side was blazing fire, and the other dazzling thunder. Either one demanded his full strength, yet they came at him without warning...

The spell he had just activated was instantly scattered. Though he had wandered Xu and Yue States for years and seen much, even he was caught utterly unprepared and nearly froze on the spot.

What... what esteemed Purple Mansion Realm bloodline have I offended?! Or have I fallen into someone’s trap... how did it come to this?!




# Chapter 813: Xi Chang

Chimen Difu only had time to spit out a black seal from his chest, but before the billowing black smoke could even unfurl, lightning and fire came crashing down in red and white flashes.

Boom!

Chimen Difu let out a muffled groan and spat two mouthfuls of black blood. He immediately formed a seal, summoning three black skulls. A mere thought shattered the jade pendant at his waist to summon reinforcements.

Even with only half a brain, Chimen Difu knew that using the pendant so hastily meant no one was likely to come. At best, they’d just gather at the entrance to watch the show.

Still... better something than nothing...

Chimen Difu forcefully suppressed his internal injuries and used mana to defend. Suddenly, a flash of rainbow light struck like a venomous snake, coiling twice around his black seal. The dharma artifact felt both heavy and light, as if an enormous hand were yanking it down.

Chimen Difu was an old devil who had refined this seal in his belly for many years. Had he not, the earlier blast of flame and lightning, followed by Heavenly Glow's tug, would have sent it crashing to the ground. Thus, it still hovered mid-air, but it clearly no longer obeyed him properly.

Shhh...

White rain rose from the ground and swept forward with the raging wind. The demon smoke that was forming around him to conceal his form and defend against spells hadn’t even taken shape before it was completely blown away, leaving only a mist of white rain around him.

Danger... With all four attackers striking together, only one thought remained in Chimen Difu’s mind, I can’t delay any longer!

Though he was bitterly frustrated, he immediately realized the four before him were all formidable. The thunder cultivator, in particular, was overwhelmingly powerful and directly countered devil cultivators. If he didn’t act now, he wouldn’t even be able to escape later.

The old devil was exceedingly decisive. He clapped his hands together, and the black shadow in the air flared brightly. His body turned into demonic light in the blink of an eye, and the black seal exploded with a bang before the four’s eyes.

Boom...

A surge of deep black magic light burst forth. Li Qinghong immediately raised her spear in defense, then, without the slightest hesitation, parted her red lips and spat out a white light.

The white light pulsed like a breath, then rapidly expanded. It was none other than the Profound Thunder condensed from Li Qinghong’s thunderpool via the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique.

This old devil truly is ruthless. He discarded a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact just like that, and who knows how many years’ worth of magic energy it contained... all shattered to buy time.

Now in the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Qinghong had three Profound Thunders in her thunderpool. She had already used one during the devil cultivator battle to cover the group's retreat.

Chimen Difu was by no means weak. But ambushed by four cultivators and forced into retreat, the demonic light he unleashed by sacrificing his artifact was indeed formidable.

But it can’t be saved now...

Li Qinghong knew the two behind her were not in great shape. If they had to fend off the attack alone, they’d almost certainly be injured. Since thunder was the bane of devil cultivators, she couldn’t afford to hold back. She unleashed the Profound Thunder just in time to shield the group from the incoming demonic light.

Boom!

The purple-white lightning dropped around them like a waterfall as it collided with the surging black magic light. The impact nearly shattered the entire cave dwelling, and the thunderous noise could no longer be concealed, spreading outward along the flow of water.

Boom!
𝚏𝕣𝕖𝚎𝚠𝚎𝚋𝚗𝐨𝐯𝕖𝕝.𝕔𝐨𝕞

A second crash echoed. Li Qinghong took a half-step back, but the magic light aimed at the others behind her had already been weakened by eighty percent. As Li Xizhi helped block the remainder, he activated his perception technique and caught sight of a streak of dark-golden light burrowing into the ground.

“What a sophisticated escape spell...” As the demonic light finally faded, Li Quantao’s Water Wall Pearl glowed faintly, sweeping away the thick miasma within the cave.

Yu Yuwei said hoarsely, “Black Radiance Origin-Life Divine Escape... that’s a technique from the Golden Feather Sect... Chimen Difu is definitely hiding something!”

Yu Yuwei had been shielded by the others and thus had energy to spare for observation. He, too, had noticed the streak of black-golden escape light.

The elder, well-versed in heritage and technique, recognized it immediately. Though Li Qinghong and the others were suspicious, they had never planned to pursue him anyway and simply let him escape.

“We shouldn’t linger. Let’s go quickly.”

Li Qinghong swept her sleeve to collect the shattered fragments of the black seal still floating in the air. Then, riding thunder, she soared over the battlefield littered with corpses of slain devil cultivators and led the others into the water vein.

The water vein was now saturated with dark radiance. The deaths of several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had greatly altered the area. It had widened several fold from Li Qinghong’s first visit. The black spiritual waters surged, occasionally revealing glowing spirit items.

Once Li Quantao entered the water, his speed noticeably increased. The wide water vein gave him room to maneuver, and activating the Water Wall Pearl raised their speed by another fifty percent. The four shot through the waterway like arrows.

The water vein was deathly silent. The young man felt the atmosphere too oppressive to bear and said, “So many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators died in this battle, not to mention countless Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators and those in Embryonic Breathing Realm... Surely this will nurture fertile ground once they are buried in the earth and fallen into the veins of the land and water.

“Jiangbei has grown increasingly barren over the past five hundred years. This nourishment could likely support several times more cultivators... and all the storage pouches, dharma artifacts, and spirit items buried in the soil could sustain generations of rogue cultivators.”

Yu Yuwei nodded in agreement as he replied, “As long as the Purple Mansion Realm doesn’t appear in the world to engage in combat, then yes—the more death, the more spiritual energy will be left behind, and the greater chance of nurturing geniuses. I won’t live to see it, but you all might. A hundred years from now, Jiangbei will be full of famous cultivators.”

Spiritual energy surged darkly through the water vein, but its bone-piercing cold was blocked by their mana shields. The silence was deafening.

Yu Yuwei glanced at Li Qinghong and said, “It’s a pity that Daoist Master Donghua once had a miraculous technique for moving through the great void. Once he entered it, no amount of Golden Core Realm cultivators could touch him. That’s why they sealed off the great void and killed him in the physical world. The Purple Mansion Realm intervened to sever the spirit vein—otherwise, Moongaze Lake would be one of the finest treasure lands today.”

He chuckled twice and said, “Come to think of it, Donghua destroyed three sects in that war. One of them was Hongxue Gate, and its young master was Li Ti... If not for that massacre, you, Li Quantao, would now be a core descendant of an immortal sect!”

“What?!”

At those words, not only did Li Xizhi and Li Qinghong look over in astonishment, even Li Quantao was stunned. He stared blankly for a moment and opened his mouth to argue, but suddenly recalled many past events and his father’s behavior. Realization struck him silent.

The Li Ti Yu Yuwei spoke of was Li Encheng’s father, Li Quantao’s own grandfather. A chill slowly spread across Li Quantao’s chest as he began to understand the immense leniency Chi Wei and the Azure Pond Sect had shown his father in certain matters...

“So that’s how it is...”

The young man was naturally bold and chivalrous. He was always drawn to heroic figures. How could he not admire a sword immortal like Daoist Master Donghua and Li Jiangqun, who stood against ten? Li Quantao clearly held great affection for Donghua and felt a deep sense of injustice over his betrayal despite such loyalty.

Now it felt as if he’d been struck by lightning. When he learned that his own ancestor had been the one to ambush the sword immortal, stole his sword, and died on the run, Li Quantao pressed his lips together. He could not bring himself to utter a word.

He simply flew forward in silence, but while the speaker had said it offhandedly, the listener, Li Xizhi, took it to heart and thought to himself, There’s such a deep connection? Hongxue Gate was founded by the Wei’s Li lineage... Yu Yuwei knows so much about it. Does the Yu Family have some hidden ties? And the way this old man keeps provoking Quantao, it might not be so simple...

He scrutinized Yu Yuwei’s expression. Indeed, it was complicated. The old man finally broke the silence, “Quantao, Li Encheng doesn’t like me. He’s probably told you already. Back then, during our internal strife, the Coiling Qi Jade True Technique really was sent by me... so yes, it was a family power struggle, and I was the one who delivered the poison.

“But think about it... who decides whether the Yu Family engages in infighting? Every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in the family knew that technique was flawed. They just picked me because I was the youngest and lowest in seniority. They dumped the dirty work on me.”

He spoke with heartfelt sincerity, “Quantao, if you can’t see through things, sooner or later you’ll be forced to suffer. Your father didn’t have time to guide you much before he died. Set aside the pride, observe more, and think more...”

When his words reached this point, the tone became more telling. Li Quantao’s expression turned complicated, and though he wanted to respond, he hesitated. The waters ahead gradually brightened, shifting from pitch-black to turquoise blue.

“The Eastern Sea...”

As Li Qinghong neared the Eastern Sea, her internal mana surged more wildly. It was clearly affected by the spiritual aura of Falling Water Rising Storm.

Li Quantao looked slightly uncomfortable; it was evidently his first time near the Eastern Sea. Yu Yuwei softly explained, “Jiangnan is an Upper Evil Spirit Storage. You’re used to that, this kind of energy will feel unfamiliar and uncomfortable at first.”

The group followed the water vein forward, which widened rapidly. At this moment, multicolored light flickered in Li Xizhi’s eyes as he grew more vigilant, peering intently into the depths.

The Eastern Sea is in utter chaos now. Though it is not war torn like Xu State with its civil war, it’s far from peaceful. We must stay cautious.

“Something’s wrong...” Although his perception technique was strong, Li Qinghong, augmented by Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow, was even more attuned to demonic energy. Her almond-shaped eyes narrowed, and she raised her spear and spoke coldly, “Fellow cultivator, why not show yourself?”

Sure enough, as soon as she spoke, the sea before them churned violently. Several figures dressed in wildly different garb appeared. Some wore the outfits of outer-sea cultivators, while others were dressed in black smoke-wreathed demonic robes. There was even one in the feathered robe of a Daoist.

Their cultivation levels varied, but seven had appeared in total, and two were late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm.

The leader wore a neat, white, ancient-style feathered robe. His aura was refined, with handsome brows and bright eyes. He smiled faintly and said, “Fellow cultivators... what a fine catch today!”

The sharp-eyed Yu Yuwei only needed a quick glance to identify their attire. He quickly sent a mana voice transmission, Mostly Eastern Sea and northern devil cultivators. The man in front is likely from the Eastern Sea. His turned-back sleeves show a faint pine-needle pattern—he probably claims descent from the Green Pine Dao lineage, likely the Chunyi Dao Gate.

Someone from Chunyi Dao... Li Xizhi remained silent for a breath. It was his first time encountering cultivators from an Eastern Sea sect, and he didn’t dare call the man’s bluff.

He merely said in a low voice, “Fellow cultivators... we are merely passing through. There’s no reason for conflict without cause...”

The young man at the front let out a laugh and waved his snowy white sleeves, speaking bluntly, “Don’t bother hiding it! This water vein runs straight from Chengshui Tomb; its branches lie beneath it! You’re clearly remnants of the Purple-Gold Devil Dao fleeing the collapse. We’ve been watching for a while now, and you’re the third group to come through.”

The four heard this and realized the matter couldn’t end peacefully. Li Qinghong drew her spear, purple lightning gathering and erupting in a flash as she swept it at the young man before her, coldly declaring, “Go!”

Boom!

The young man glanced at her in surprise, white light rising in his palm. He pushed his palm forward and a stream of luminous moonlight burst forth, forming a radiant arc that blocked the thunder.

He was much more polite as he said gently, “I am Xi Chang, a rogue cultivator from the Eastern Sea. Since the fairy cultivates profound thunder, you must not be a devil cultivator. Why associate with these devilish types?”

When he saw that Li Qinghong’s thunder was bright and pure, Xi Chang judged that she couldn’t be from the Miao lineage, and thus not one of the Southern Sea devil cultivators. She must be an upright inland cultivator, so he held back slightly.

Though Xi Chang had held back on purpose, Li Qinghong assumed it was a life-and-death duel and didn’t hold anything back. Her purple lightning pierced forward, scattering the light in his hand and numbing his arm.

He couldn’t help but cry out, “Impressive lightning! I underestimated you, fairy!”

The surrounding Eastern Sea cultivators surged forward to chase the others. Yu Yuwei released his violet-red cauldron, sending out several purple fire dragons to block their spells.

Most of these cultivators cultivated with a gray-white energy, similar to that of Qiu Ji, which could neutralize mana and break apart spells. Though their clothing differed, a closer look revealed that they were skilled at coordinating among them.

Li Qinghong had already exchanged several blows with Xi Chang. The mana in his hands was bright as pure and luminous moonlight. Though this was her first time seeing it, something about it felt deeply familiar.

She thought, It must be of the Supreme Yin element.

This was her first duel with a cultivator of the Supreme Yin element. She felt his mana to be both extremely Yin and luminously pure. It was not forceful, yet unyielding, like a gleaming, icy stone.

In the past, her opponents were either devil cultivators or orthodox immortals. Their mana was easily overwhelmed by her lightning. Only Miao Quan of the Southern Sea, who also wielded lightning, had held his own. Against all others, even those stronger than her, Li Qinghong was always on the offensive.

But Xi Chang, with his pure Supreme Yin mana, often responded unpredictably and deflected her attacks more often than not. Though slightly inferior in cultivation, he was calm and composed in his responses.

While she pondered in silence, Xi Chang was growing alarmed. He knew his own limits. His technique, based on Supreme Yin and pure Yin qi, was already a top-tier method. He had never encountered a worthy opponent in his life.

Yet this woman’s thunder techniques were truly fearsome. To make matters worse, she was growing more powerful with each exchange. Xi Chang secretly began to wonder, Could she be a direct heir of the Three Sects and Seven Gates? But I’ve never heard of any of them producing a renowned thunder cultivator...

The duel between the two continued with no clear victor, but Yu Yuwei and the others were starting to falter. The old man was facing three opponents alone, one of whom was a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. His hair and beard flared wildly as he fought fiercely.

Li Xizhi was faring slightly better as he held off two devil cultivators. But Li Quantao was surrounded by two others and found himself in grave danger.

He was already coughing blood and faltering. He looked ready to collapse.




# Chapter 815: Shameful Matter

Pfft.

Barely a quarter-hour had passed, and Li Qinghong and Xi Chang had begun to fight in earnest. Lightning and moonlight clashed in the sea, sending waves crashing endlessly.

At the same time, Li Quantao’s face was ashen as he teetered on the brink of collapse. He had been fighting nonstop and was long exhausted. He had been besieged by two devil cultivators earlier and had already sustained injuries. His condition worsened with each clash, and a single moment of distraction led to a heavy palm strike to the chest.

Hiss...

His torn and ragged dharma robe had long lost most of its protective light. Yet, it managed to hold together enough to keep him from sinking into the sea immediately. But the pale mist still eroded his flesh, exposing stark white bone beneath.

Li Xizhi kept glancing over and saw Quantao taking hit after hit from spells, soaking his robes in blood. Xizhi was just about to break formation and help when he spotted several more figures flying in from the distance.

“My lord! Forgive our tardiness!”

Li Xizhi’s heart sank as he saw two more cultivators riding the wind toward them. The white-haired leader looked quite formidable.

Reinforcements for the enemy...

“Sigh...”

Fear surged in Xizhi’s heart. He heard Yu Yuwei’s heavy sigh nearby as the old man slowly raised his hand, a dense purple firelight welling up on his palm.

Xizhi remembered that when Yu Yuwei fought Tuoba Chongyuan, he had dug a talisman from the palm of his hand. That wound had yet to heal. Now, the old man drew a jade knife again and stabbed it into his other palm.

Ting...

A crisp, ringing sound rang out, and a radiant, snow-white talisman leaped out from his palm.

“Hyah!”

The elder shouted fiercely as two purple flame dragons burst forth from the talisman. The dazzling and radiant dragons were covered in glowing runes. The elder instantly aged several years, but instead of directing the fire dragons forward, he sent them to either flank.

The fire dragons intercepted the devil cultivators attacking Xizhi and Quantao. The old man swallowed a pill and his face flushed red. He raised his great cauldron high, unleashing waves of violet-red flame.

“Go!” He shouted the command, and beside him, Li Qinghong seized the moment and spat out her final Profound Thunder. A blinding white light ignited instantly.

Boom!

A circular blast of white light erupted in the sea. The thunder cracked like a mountain collapsing, stirring violent waves and transforming scalding steam into a dense purple lightning cascade that blinded everyone.

“Go!”

Li Xizhi quickly scooped up Li Quantao and shot through the water without hesitation, leaving the others behind as he flew straight for the distance without looking back.

Li Qinghong had been closely monitoring the situation. The last Profound Thunder had allowed her to force a retreat, so she also pulled back. The Cyan Sparrow Plume on her body lit up with blue-white brilliance, enhancing her purple lightning as she vanished into the sky.

“My lord!”

Xi Chang emerged from the purple-white thunderlight and coughed twice, spitting a bit of blood into his palm. His eyes shone brightly as he gazed at the distant horizon where Li Qinghong had vanished on a bolt of lightning.

He sighed, “What exquisite profound thunder... it must be the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling!”

“My lord! Shall we pursue them?”

“Pursue?” Xi Chang chuckled and said, “Could we even catch them?”

He flew above the sea’s surface, looking into the far distance as he murmured, “Jiangnan, after all, was once home to an Immortal Mansion. Many righteous lineages still dwell there.”

His subordinate followed his gaze and asked, “My lord, haven’t you heard that Jiangnan no longer has any Supreme Yin Dao lineage... even though it was where the Moonlight Origin Mansion once stood?”

“Hahaha!” Xi Chang laughed warmly and replied, “Do you know why that is?”

When he saw his subordinate silently shake his head, Xi Chang continued with a grin, “Jiangnan was once the land of the Moonlight Origin Mansion. Their techniques were deeply hidden, but not entirely lost. Even Donghua passed down several Supreme Yin methods, yet do you know why they can’t be cultivated anymore?”

He paused, then smiled widely. “Guess what the Moonlight Origin Mansion used to cultivate Supreme Yin?”

The subordinate began to sense something amiss and cautiously replied, “Could it be something rare like Constant Pure Yin Qi or Essence of Origin Light...?”

“Wrong.” Xi Chang laughed aloud and shook his head. He ground his teeth as he said, “They used the damn Supreme Yin Moonlight!”

“Supreme Yin Moonlight?!”

The subordinate was stunned into silence. Xi Chang muttered, “They used Supreme Yin Moonlight for Qi Cultivation... how extravagant? How absurdly extravagant! That would be like the Bright Yang using Radiant Sky Stones, or Azure Manifestation using the Primordial Vault Secret to train. Once the Moon Mansion vanished, how could any of their techniques still be practiced?

“If I could just obtain even a portion of Supreme Yin Moonlight...” Xi Chang whispered, “The Purple Mansion Realm would be within reach... that’s the Purple Mansion Realm...”

He sighed, then quickly refocused and ordered, “Bring that old man here for questioning. That violet flame of his is... interesting.”

———

Li Xizhi carried Li Quantao as they fled. Quantao’s consciousness had begun to blur. His eyes were filled with a blood-red haze, and his arms hung limply over Li Xizhi’s shoulders as he stared blankly ahead.

When the purple flames and thunderlight had intertwined, he had been snatched away by Li Xizhi. But an old man’s voice had echoed faintly in his ears. It wasn’t loud, but it left him stunned, “Li Encheng, that heartless bastard, never dared tell you the truth. My younger sister studied alchemy at his place, but secretly left you behind... You should’ve called me your uncle.

“Li Xizhi may be grateful to you, but he’s suspicious by nature. The Ning father and son he’s allied with are wolves, and Qingdu’s branch of the Li Family may be disloyal to the upper sect. Drawing close to the Li of Qingdu... isn’t wise.

“You should’ve distanced yourself! Staying out of gratitude will only drag you down. Protect yourself, while you still can.”

The elder’s voice was hoarse. Quantao coughed up bloody phlegm as he mulled the words over. Thunder still boomed in the distance, but suddenly, something clicked in his mind.

“He hesitated during the devil plague and refused to act decisively not to harm me, but to get at Brother Zhi... to sever my link to the Qingdu Li Family!”

He had never seen his mother growing up and had asked his father and brother many times, but never received answers. Now, knowing the truth, he realized it had been a shameful matter.

No wonder they never told me... no wonder I could never get a straight answer, thought Li Quantao.

Yu Yuwei’s attitude had always felt strange, but now he understood why. When Tuoba Chongyuan breached Baixiang Valley, Yu Yuwei was supposed to flee to Lake Xian, yet he had crossed mountains to find Li Xizhi. In truth, it was probably to see him.

Grief and resentment surged in him, and with it, a deep, sudden doubt for everything his father and brother had ever taught him, So much for the Yu Family’s loyalty and righteousness... They’re just a bunch of selfish cowards. What if my father was just guilty? He hid the truth until death, and perhaps even turned it back on me to keep me from finding out?

He lay silently in Li Xizhi’s arms, his heart a swirling storm of emotion. They flew for almost a full fifteen minutes before he slowly began to recover.

Then he heard Li Xizhi worriedly say, “Quick, take a pill. Can you still hold on?”

“I can hold on...” Li Quantao swallowed the blood in his throat. His eyes opened slowly, hands stained with blood, and he murmured, “I can hold on!”




# Chapter 816: The Fall of Mount Yan Pass

Mount Yan Pass.

Dense demonic qi surged across the ruins. The ground was dim and soaked in blood. The once radiant formation was now in tatters, with only faint glimmers of formation lines flickering intermittently on exposed stones.

The reek of blood filled the air, demonic smoke soared into the sky, and not a trace of immortal light could be seen. Cries of battle and the clash of dharma artifacts echoed across the land. Thick black clouds spread for nearly fifty kilometers as it rushed southward.

Zhao Tinggui sped through the air atop a small golden cloud, a white jade lantern in his hands radiating multicolored light. Each time the golden cloud tried to accelerate, streaks of violet light shot out from the layers of demonic clouds. The white jade lantern in his hand would immediately emit colorful rays to block them, leaving behind crackling and shattering sounds.

Zhao Tinggui’s dharma artifact was indeed impressive to shield him from the violet rays. But even as those rays were shattered, a wave of white radiance would fall on him. Just as the golden light beneath his feet would start to rise, it would be dimmed again by the white glow.

Boom!

The streaks of violet light seemed never ending, leaving Zhao Tinggui’s face pale and ashen. His refined junior martial brother, dressed in brocade robes, remained calm and composed even in danger as he said, “Senior brother... this Murong Gong is overwhelmingly powerful... I fear we are no match for him!”

Zhao Tinggui’s expression was grim, and his heart had long since turned cold. His usually polished and smiling face was now slightly pale, with traces of blood at the corners of his lips.

“Tang Shedu... Tang Shedu...”

Zhao Tinggui knew Tu Longjian had broken through and expected difficult times ahead for him, but he truly hadn’t imagined that Tang Shedu would defect from the Azure Pond Sect overnight and join the enemy, ruining the entire strategic situation.

The defection had caused the front lines to collapse like a landslide. Li Xuanfeng was exceptionally strong, so he might yet escape with his life, but the rest likely had no more than one in ten chance of survival. Zhao Tinggui’s heart turned to ice.

Yu Su is useless too... he thought.

Yu Su’s forces had been stationed close to Mount Yan Pass, yet he had only advanced a few hundred kilometers and was already calling for reinforcements. At the time, Zhao Tinggui hadn’t known of Tang Shedu’s betrayal, so he had felt uneasy and sent a few men over. In the end, none returned.

He had been burning with anxiety as he waited within the pass. But when he saw five spiritual winds surging into the sky and getting torn apart by demonic hands, Zhao Tinggui could only mutter in a daze, “Yu Su is most likely dead...”

The Yu Family’s Long Wind Cage was well known for having five wind fiends held within it. Zhao Tinggui had personally seen it years ago. But judging from the current state of things, even the Long Wind Cage had been dismantled. How could Yu Su still be alive?

Then, the Murong Family’s Murong Gong suddenly led a charge straight through the pass. Since Mount Yan Pass had been emptied, Zhao Tinggui had only five Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators at his side. What could they possibly use to stop the enemy? What could they even use to defend?

He had no idea what agreements the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had made, but devil cultivators had even stirred up chaos inside Mount Yan Pass. The entire defense line had collapsed in less than fifteen minutes. Zhao Tinggui hadn’t even had time to gather all his junior brothers before being engulfed in the billowing demonic smoke.

Zhao Tinggui’s strength was above average, but he came from humble origins. Though the Ning Family had temporarily granted him a few dharma artifacts, his techniques and spell arts couldn’t compare to those of the Murong Family’s direct descendents. After holding on for a few dozen exchanges, he could no longer withstand the onslaught and was forced to retreat.

If not for his few dharma artifacts, Zhao Tinggui would have long since fallen to the devil cultivators. He and his junior brother Lin Wuning had fled all the way here, while Murong Gong followed at a steady pace, seemingly unsatisfied with his spoils and hoping to lure out more prey.

Zhao Tinggui's heart was frozen with dread as his junior brother Lin Wuning murmured again, “Senior brother... this demonic cultivator is getting faster... he’s likely nearing the riverbank. Since he sees no more prey surfacing, he’s getting ready to close the net!”

Of course he understood Lin Wuning. Murong Gong had just shattered the great formation at Mount Yan Pass with his own strength. Though he had used a dharma artifact, the power it lent him was very real. The two of them likely had no way to escape.

Boom!

Another bright purple ray streaked toward them. The white jade lantern in Zhao Tinggui’s hand flared with dense, hair-thin streaks of multicolored light. Zhao Tinggui staggered from the impact, the wind beneath his feet nearly dissipating.

Murong Gong had cultivated some unknown art, and was perhaps even wielding a Water Mansion dharma artifact. Every time his spell struck, a dispersing force would follow, preventing the dharma artifact beneath Zhao Tinggui’s feet from ever fully activating.

After suffering two more strikes, Zhao Tinggui suddenly fell silent. He stared deeply into the fog of demonic mist ahead and spoke quietly, “Wuning, we’ve come this far, and it’s only Murong Gong chasing us. I’ll use the White Blossom Lamp to block this demon for you. Take the Fortune-Rising Cloud and flee south on your own.”

Lin Wuning was stunned. Countless feelings churned in his heart, and though he wanted to protest, the words stayed lodged in his chest. Lin Wuning hadn’t thought much of his senior brother earlier. Zhao Tinggui came from poverty, and though it was a miracle he’d reached his current status, he was always gathering allies and currying favor. Lin Wuning always thought him overly concerned with appearances and reputation. He was altogether too calculating.

As the son of a peak master, Lin Wuning carried a natural pride in his bearing. He had always found Zhao Tinggui’s demeanor petty and unbecoming of greatness, and had looked down on him.
𝘧𝓇𝑒𝑒𝑤ℯ𝑏𝓃𝘰𝑣ℯ𝘭.𝘤ℴ𝘮

But over time, he came to realize that Zhao Tinggui, though constantly scheming and striving, genuinely cared for the disciples of his own peak. So over time, Lin Wuning gradually let go of his resentment.

He used to scorn how Zhao Tinggui scurried about for petty gains, seemingly without dignity. But now, when he heard these words, his face flushed red and he said weakly, “Senior brother, your future still holds promise... let me... stay behind... and cover you instead.”

“Nonsense!” Zhao Tinggui didn’t have the energy to manage his tone. He scanned the mist for a path to escape, while Lin Wuning shrank back hesitantly. Zhao Tinggui murmured, “I gave my word to Li Xijun... promised Li Qinghong... and in the end, Mount Yan Pass fell within fifteen minutes. I couldn’t even find my own brothers, let alone Li Yuexiang...”

Lin Wuning could only reply, “How can this be your fault, senior brother?! I know Li Yuexiang is Li Xizhi’s sister, and Li Xuanfeng is terrifying, Li Qinghong is strong too... but how many of them will even make it back? There’s no need to...”

Zhao Tinggui shook his head and replied quietly, “I shouldn’t have sent anyone out... Mount Yan Pass fell in fifteen minutes, and the majority of the blame is mine. Every major clan north of the Yue River had cultivators within the pass. If I survive alone, I’ll be condemned by all and hated by everyone!

Zhao Tinggui said quietly, “What face do I have left to return across the river?”

Seeing his junior brother still bewildered, he had to explain, “I’ve long known this day would come. I knew my end would not be good ever since the sect sent me with no backing or support to rally cultivators. They even stripped me of every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator under my command.”

Lin Wuning looked at him, somewhat dazed, as Zhao Tinggui simply said, “In the past, the Chi Family didn’t care about anyone’s opinion, but now they’ve grown weak and can no longer act so domineering. The pass falling in fifteen minutes; someone will have to take the blame for such a crushing defeat. From top to bottom, first to last.”

Lin Wuning seemed to slowly understand. Zhao Tinggui placed the golden cloud beneath his feet and channeled all his mana into the white jade-like lamp.

He looked at his junior brother twice and finally said, “You often said I was overly scheming and ambitious. I know it’s hard for you to understand. But before I came up the mountain, I was just a farmer’s son carrying nothing but a sickle. If I didn’t fight for every inch, I wouldn’t have survived.

“Later I realized that if I didn’t scramble, I’d die. But if I scrambled too hard, I’d still die... But I realized that too late. All the cultivators thought I had the Ning Family backing me, but they were wrong. I had nothing behind me. My fate was sealed long ago. It was only a matter of time before I was sacrificed.”

He poured his mana into the cloud and sent Lin Wuning southward, letting out a heavy yet gentle sigh as he muttered, “I’ve always known you looked down on me, but that won’t stop me from saving you. Master brought me up the mountain and taught me to cherish my junior brothers, and I’ve never forgotten that.”

Radiant white light burst from his body as the dharma artifact in his hand shone brilliantly, blocking the sweeping violet light. Blood streamed from all seven orifices as he turned to face his opponent. The openly mocking look on Murong Gong’s face gave way to seriousness.

Lin Wuning bowed his head and charged out of the dark clouds. The flying cloud beneath his feet moved faster and faster, plunging him deep into the heavy mist. Below him was a sea of demonic haze and strewn corpses. After flying for several kilometers, the demonic aura finally began to fade.

He flew blindly through the wind until he saw the roaring Great River. It was only after crossing it and heading further south that the terror in his heart gradually subsided. His senior brother’s words echoed within him for a long while. He was grateful, but also overwhelmed and at a loss.

Further south is Moongaze Lake...

After a brief moment of hesitation, Lin Wuning didn’t land or issue any warnings, fearing to waste precious time. He instead veered toward Mount Bianyan, and calculated silently. If he could bring reinforcements back in time, perhaps he could still save Zhao Tinggui.

Mount Qingdu.

The coldest days had passed and the heavy snow began to ease. Though the lake’s ice had yet to thaw, it had grown much thinner. Li Xuanxuan finished drawing a talisman, folded his sleeves, and strolled through the mountain.

He had heard that the northern situation was growing ever more chaotic, but news from their own people was growing scarcer by the day. Li Zhouwei had become busy, and Li Ximing remained in seclusion with no resolution regarding that child’s matter.

Li Xuanxuan deliberated for a moment, then decided to find Li Zhouwei, only to run into him at the temple gate. The young man wore a solemn expression and now stood a full head taller than Li Xuanxuan. Golden light flowed through his eyes, and his face was filled with thought. His black cloak was dusted with slowly melting snow.

“Huang’er... how did it go?” asked Li Xuanxuan.

Li Zhouwei bowed slightly and answered, “A devil cultivator just slipped into Mount Yue and conspired with some remnants of the Western Tan lineage to steal spirit paddies and flee. It has been dealt with. I came right away to report to you.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded. Li Zhouwei raised his hand to shut the temple doors and activated the isolation formation. Only then did worry show on his face as he spoke softly, “My trusted men stationed along the northern river have just returned. They reported rampant demonic smoke spreading southward. It’s spreading so much that even Mount Yan Pass was covered in it. It’s likely been breached by devil cultivators. The situation looks grim.”

Li Xuanxuan let out a long sigh and asked quietly, “Have there been any signs from the family’s life jades?”

Li Xuanxuan was referring to the life jades the core members of the Li Family all nurtured in the ancestral hall. If any faced life-or-death danger within five to ten years, the life jade would show signs.

Li Zhouwei shook his head and reminded him, “Jiangbei is in complete chaos. Even the Maha of the Purple Mansion Realm can’t divine anything anymore. How could mere life jades show anything? Ever since they entered Xu State, their life jades have dulled and no longer reveal their state.”

Li Xuanxuan could only nod. After hesitating a moment, he braced for the worst and asked, “If Mount Yan Pass has truly fallen, and the devil cultivators push all the way to Xu State’s border... how should we respond?”

“We can only watch how the Azure Pond Sect reacts.” Li Zhouwei had clearly considered this and said bluntly, “If their response is quick enough, we might be able to stop the devil cultivators at the Great River, rebuild a defensive line, and reorganize cultivators to resist... but if not...”

His golden eyes flicked northward as he said, one word at a time, “Then we can only defend at the northern shore of Moongaze Lake, where the Fei Family will be the frontline!”

Li Xuanxuan had long sensed it would come to this, but still sighed as he replied, “Earlier, Xijun sent so many family cultivators and spoke of sharing weal and woe... I underestimated it then. But now it seems the devil cultivators are right on our doorstep.”

Li Zhouwei had spoken of the Fei Family with such weight; it was clearly a hint. He thought to himself, If it truly comes to that, and we lose one more battle, we might lose the entire northern shore...

If the Azure Pond Sect withdraws again, their own domain would become the frontlines of a north-south struggle. What then? Win or lose, how would the million mortals living here be dealt with?

The Li Family had managed the southern shores of Moongaze Lake for years. If they lost it, where else could they go? Could they really abandon tens of thousands of acres of spirit fields and several spirit veins to flee to the Eastern Sea?

If it comes to that... How will I ever face my uncles and elders?

The elder raised his tea but didn’t drink, his mind preoccupied with the safety of the younger generation. Meanwhile, Li Zhouwei looked north and said softly, “We must prepare. I’ve already sent several loyal men to investigate further.”

The white ape had only returned to the family with Li Chengliao a few days ago, but Li Zhouwei didn’t plan to send him to scout. Though the ape was strong and could move freely, he had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. If the white ape was caught by devil cultivators in the north, they’d lose a critical asset...

Li Zhouwei stared solemnly into the distance, golden light flickering in his eyes, and thought to himself, If things really come to this... I can’t delay any longer. I’ll take some pills and enter closed-door cultivation to break through to Foundation Establishment Realm first.

The Li Family understood well that breaking through from Qi Cultivation Realm to Foundation Establishment Realm wasn’t a race. Ideally, they would practice spells until around age forty or fifty before advancing. At the latest, they would advance no later than sixty.

Li Zhouwei cultivated the Radiant Essence Scripture, the highest fifth grade technique in the Li Family’s history. He was also extraordinary from birth. He had been inherently attuned to Bright Yang, so his cultivation speed should have been astonishing.

However, to avoid attracting undue attention with overly dazzling progress, and to ensure steady cultivation by balancing both spell arts and halberd technique, he had deliberately prioritized building a solid foundation rather than advancing too quickly. That was why his pace had slowed.

Yet even with this restraint, his cultivation still surpassed Li Ximing in his youth. He had already reached the mid-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm before the age of twenty.

Li Zhouwei’s gaze flickered with resolution, but just then, someone approached and handed him a small letter.

He unlocked it with a unique method, glanced over it briefly, waved the messenger away, and said softly, “There’s news from Yu Fuzi of Changxiao Gate.”




# Chapter 818: Crimson Voyager

Li Zhouwei unfolded the small letter in his hand, read through it line by line, and handed it to Li Xuanxuan. The old man took it and read carefully, stroking his beard as he recited, "Yu Fuzi, birth name Wang Fu, hails from Jiankan Prefecture of Wu State. He has three disciples, one of whom is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... That disciple is now nearly a hundred years old. The disciple’s master is Zhou Han of Changxiao Gate, who has been in closed-door cultivation for many years and has not emerged..."

Changxiao Gate had been established fairly recently. Its founder, Chang Xiaozi, was still alive and in his prime, imbuing the sect with the vigor of a newly risen force. Everyone has a Daoist title, and master-disciple relationships often lacked any blood ties.

Li Xuanxuan read halfway through and suddenly felt a headache coming on. He muttered to himself, "Wu State... surname Wang... there shouldn’t be many powerful families left..."

Li Zhouwei nodded and replied, "Wu State once had the Wang Family, a top-tier family, though that was said to be a thousand years ago. Later, chaos broke out in Jiangnan, and the Wang Family declined. But they had been so prominent back then that many powerful cultivators in Wu State still bear the surname Wang."

Jiangnan had long since been split between Wu and Yue, unlike the north where dynasties changed rapidly. The great cultivation sects and aristocratic clans had completely supplanted the imperial families of both nations. Wu and Yue had become mere geographic terms, with no real national rivalry remaining.

Jiangnan's strict information blockade had resulted in only a few century-old families keeping secret records. Thus, even the names of southern dynasties from a thousand years ago had faded from history...

Li Xuanxuan continued reading, "This person cultivates the Lesser Yang attribute, but his Immortal Foundation is unknown... He possesses three dharma artifacts: a bell, a sword, and a pearl. They all have great power... He has remained at the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm for many years and is exceptionally strong...

"He recently emerged from his cave dwelling after obtaining a treasure and is now stationed at the Eastern Sea’s Xifeng Island on behalf of Changxiao Gate, leading its cultivators to guard against an attack from the Hengzhu Dao Gate..."

There had long been tension between Changxiao Gate and the Hengzhu Dao Gate, and their conflicts had grown increasingly intense in recent years. Now that fighting had become likely, the powerful Yu Fuzi had been deployed.

After reading, Li Xuanxuan furrowed his old brows and muttered, "This matter seems difficult... Qinghong and the others still haven’t found a place to settle. Who knows if they’re wounded... This Yu Fuzi looks troublesome, he has a master and disciples, with a web of complicated ties...

"Let’s wait for now."
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Li Zhouwei nodded in reply. "Since we've received word and major changes have occurred on the front, we should have uncle come out of seclusion..."

After all, Li Ximing had only been in seclusion for a month. It was barely long enough to get settled for a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. However, if the situation hadn’t become urgent, Li Zhouwei wouldn’t have disturbed him. Once Li Xuanxuan nodded, he sent someone over.

After a short wait, Li Ximing indeed descended on the wind before the hall. The radiant light around him had yet to fade, bringing a warm breeze into the hall. He asked directly, "How are things at home?"

Li Xuanxuan took his hand and began explaining the northern disturbances, then passed him the letter. After reading it, Li Ximing replied with mixed feelings, "The news from the north is so dire... we may need to wait longer to learn the full picture. Has Zhouwei found out anything about Xifeng Island, and any intelligence on Hengzhu Dao Gate?"

Since the Radiant Sky Stone concerned Li Ximing’s Dao to the Purple Mansion Realm, he took it very seriously. Li Zhouwei had come prepared and answered softly, "Changxiao Gate’s Xifeng Island lies over five hundred kilometers north of Splitreed Island. The island itself is decent, with a chain of scattered reefs forming a powerful grand formation. It’s well defended.

"As for Hengzhu Dao Gate’s Tianzhu Island, it lies over two hundred and fifty kilometers east of Splitreed Island. It's held by Bi Yuzhuang, a late Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. The two sects have already spilled blood multiple times, and relations are quite strained."

Li Ximing nodded quietly. It was the perfect time to get involved, but they couldn’t spare the manpower. He could only say comfortingly, "It’s fine. The man just left for the Eastern Sea, so it’ll be at least four or five years before he can be reassigned. Let’s wait for news from the north first."

Noise rose outside the grand formation. An Siwei quickly stepped forward and said in a low voice, "Your Highness, Master Monk Kongheng has returned!"

"Bring him up immediately!" said Li Xuanxuan.

Li Xuanxuan grew excited and strode out in a few quick steps. Sure enough, the narrow-eyed monk was standing before the hall. The monk’s aura appeared stable. Though his robes were disheveled, the bronze meditation staff in his hand stood firm, and his expression held a hint of guilt.

"Elder Xuanxuan!" He bowed his head and said softly, "Chengshui Tomb was thrown into chaos. Tang Shedu rebelled... the Immortal Dao suffered greatly..."

As he recounted everything in detail, the three men listened in heavy silence. Kongheng, once a defender of Mount Yan Pass, had also been sent to Chengshui Tomb with the other cultivators. Always low-profile, he had kept his true strength hidden and was assigned alone under Yu Su.

According to the Azure Pond Sect's deployment orders, Yu Su’s group had arrived slightly later than Li Xuanfeng and Tang Shedu. They had moved north from Mount Yan Pass and were expected to face the weakest devil cultivators. They were supposedly the easiest front.

Thus, though the cultivators were the weakest of the three groups, they felt no tension as they marched north in high spirits. This lasted until they witnessed an immortal and a devil cultivator in a chase heading east.

The two were unremarkable, except for the dharma artifact in the devil cultivator’s hand. It shone brilliantly with an ancient, majestic aura which clearly meant that it was no ordinary item. Its power was great, and the devil cultivator was chasing the immortal cultivator across the land.

Yu Su took one look and immediately stopped in his tracks. He was already infamous within the sect for his greed. He had even earned the nickname Brocade Dark Mouse because of his personality, unique Immortal Foundation, and dharma artifact. Though he claimed he was going to help, it was clearly greed at work.

The group had no choice but to adjust course slightly and fly a few more kilometers. Unexpectedly, the devil cultivators seemed to have predicted their path and had set a trap, ambushing them on the way!

"That Yu Su... he was surrounded by five devil heads. The demonic smoke was thick, and the cultivators scattered in all directions. In the end, no one was willing to help him..."

The always inconspicuous Kongheng had roamed far and wide for years, so he was never short on survival techniques. Sensing danger early, he had fled eastward through the demonic smoke and eventually reached Baixiang Valley.

"I had just reached Baixiang Valley when the pursuers arrived... I also saw Yuan Huyuan on the way. He and several Yuan Family members were swallowed by the demonic smoke and he was forced to flee alone. I happened upon him weeping softly."

Li Xuanxuan asked softly, "So you weren’t inside the pass... Has Mount Yan Pass fallen?"

"I’m quite certain that it has fallen..." replied Kongheng.

Kongheng had served alone under Yu Su, without any other members of the Li Family nearby, so he couldn’t confirm Mount Yan Pass’s exact status. Li Ximing stayed silent for a moment before finally speaking, "We can’t head north into the demonic mist. All we can do is await word... The two elders are powerful and should be safe... but I fear for Xizhi and Wushao... Brother Xizhi was injured earlier, and he could be in danger now."

Kongheng thought for a moment, then gently consoled, "Although Mount Yan Pass has fallen, the situation at Chengshui Tomb may not be as bad as it seems."

As a buddhist cultivator of an ancient lineage, Kongheng had clearly deduced Tang Shedu’s intentions from the clues at hand. He explained, "Tang Shedu simply wishes to join the Northern Buddhists. The North-South conflict is a matter of Dao lineage and great destiny. With his deep foundations and high status, he may become the next Merciful One if he joins the North. This means his future prospects are boundless.

"If he intends to undertake the karmic transformation ritual, he would surely submit under a Maha. Upon success, the heavens would shine with divine light, lotus flowers would descend, and all of us who cultivate the Buddhist Dao would sense it..."

He shook his head and said, "I was close enough to Chengshui Tomb, yet I sensed nothing, not even upon reaching Baixiang Valley. Something must have gone wrong. Perhaps the ritual was interrupted by someone in the Purple Mansion Realm."

The expressions of the Li Family members eased slightly at that. But Li Xuanxuan remained uneasy and began asking for details. Li Ximing sat quietly at the table, folding Yu Fuzi's intelligence with care. Outside, the snowfall had lessened. A man rushed up from below, hurried and anxious, arriving quickly before the hall.

His face pale, he spoke quickly, "Your Highness! Lady Xu is in labor..."

Li Zhouwei’s gaze snapped to him. He strode swiftly out of the main hall, and leaped onto the wind. He pierced through the clouds and across the frozen lake, landing directly in front of the central hall.

Though anxious, he masked it well. He strode through the corridor and neared the palace gate of the rear hall. The scent of blood had already reached his nose. Li Zhouwei’s ears twitched at the sound of panicked cries. His expression darkened as he pushed the door open, and his breath caught.

A suffocating wave of blood-tinged heat rushed out, mingled with an odd fragrance that nearly induced nausea. The lamps had all toppled, and the floor was dotted with glimmering beads of blood that gleamed gold under the flickering light.

Two maidservants had backed into a corner, sobbing as they clung to each other. When he followed the trail of blood, he finally saw Xu Peiyu.

The woman lay motionless on the couch, lit by dim, yellow light. Blood dripped slowly down her thighs, and a newborn lay on the floor. Its entire body was wrinkled, and its golden eyes were already open. Its tiny hands clutched Xu Peiyu's thigh tightly, tongue extended to lap up the dripping blood. Its lips moved slightly, revealing a faint white gleam.

The Jade Court Guards nearby were frozen beside the child. Their hands bore fresh bite wounds, and they were unsure whether to act or retreat. The moment they saw him enter, they fell to their knees with a thud.

"Your subordinate... was incompetent..."

Li Zhouwei paid them no mind. An old, lingering premonition was being confirmed in his heart, leaving him speechless. This child was supposed to be his eldest son. Li Zhouwei had even chosen his name in advance, naming him Li Jiang’ao.

His heart sank step by step as he stepped over the blood and grabbed the child by the neck. But the moment he lifted him, Li Jiang’ao shrieked, opening his unnaturally wide mouth to reveal sharp, interlocking white teeth, and tried to bite him.

But how could he possibly harm Li Zhouwei? A casual flick and a surge of mana stifled any attempts to bite from Li Jiang’ao. His overly large eyes stared at him with a dull, mindless hunger.
𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝘦𝘣𝘯ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝑚

Li Zhouwei swept his spiritual sense across the child. The strange bloodline connection told him clearly that this child was neither a reincarnated soul nor the product of any dark sorcery...

He's simply... not human.

His gaze fell upon Lady Xu’s young face. Her eyes had already lost their light as they stared blankly at the ceiling. A thin veil lay unmoving over her lips.

The hall was oppressively silent. None of the attendants dared speak or move. All knelt together, watching as Li Zhouwei slowly walked up to the bed and pulled the veil away.

He wound the veil around an arm as he slowly lifted the child to eye level and examined it carefully. One hand supported the child from beneath, the other clutched its throat. His fingers pressed against the tiny neck of Li Jiang’ao without moving. His eyes narrowed as he felt the faint pulsing of blood beneath the skin.

The child seemed to sense the threat of death. Its golden eyes widened into orbs, glaring back with fierce, unblinking hostility.

"Minghuang! Minghuang!"

As father and son stared each other down, Li Zhouwei’s grip slowly tightened. Li Xuanxuan rushed forward, calling twice urgently. But an unfazed Li Zhouwei casually unwound the veil around his wrist and wrapped the child.

It was less wrapping and more binding. His eyes returned to Lady Xu’s face.

When Li Xuanxuan finally looked away from the bloodstained floor to him, Li Zhouwei held the child and said heavily, "A curse upon our house."

The family had closely monitored Lady Xu’s condition. Her belly had suddenly expanded in her first month, then gone still, before seeming to resume normal growth like any infant.

Medicines had been administered to nurse her health back, and all had seemed to improve. No one had expected her to go into labor without warning in the third month. Kongheng, whom they planned to contact, had disappeared, and though he had returned, it was too late.

The woman had perished, her face pallid with a bluish tint. Li Xuanxuan stood dazed, only able to ask, "How... could this happen..."

Li Ximing and Kongheng followed behind him. As Li Zhouwei handed over Li Jiang’ao, the child bared its sharp white teeth and twisted, trying to bite Li Xuanxuan’s wrist.

But Li Zhouwei had bound him tightly, so he couldn’t turn over. Li Xuanxuan recoiled at the sight of those jagged teeth and golden eyes. He turned to Kongheng, voice trembling with disbelief, "Master Monk! This..."

Kongheng’s eyes flickered as well. He lowered his gaze and chanted several buddhist verses before reaching out to take Li Jiang’ao, examining him closely before responding quietly, "Not quite human... he was affected by Your Highness. Bright Yang is not an ordinary force, it’s far more volatile than the Twelve Essences. And with the prior karmic entanglements... he was inevitably altered."

Li Zhouwei was already lifting the woman's corpse in his arms. He whispered an apology and left ahead of them. The thick, suffocating scent of blood still hung in the air, mixed with a nauseating sweet fragrance.

Li Ximing took two steps back. Kongheng lowered his voice and said solemnly, "In our Buddhist scriptures, the one who attained enlightenment through Bright Yang, the Undefeated King of Brightness, had four wives in his lay life. He had five sons among all his concubines... all enemies of the Dharma, sweeping wind and light in their wake, killing countless... they were five demon heads.

"As for the Wei’s Li bloodline... generation after generation bore abnormalities. There were consorts dying violently, children noble while mothers perished. That too may be linked to Bright Yang..."




# Chapter 820: The Northern Line

The two were silent for a moment before another person came up. Li Xuanxuan tilted his ear and heard An Siwei quietly say, "My lord, Lady An is with child."

He was referring to one of Li Zhouwei’s concubines. A few months ago, such news would have been cause for celebration. But now, Li Xuanxuan’s heart sank.

Still, the elder forced a smile and said reassuringly, "Go on then. Take her to Qingdu and have the Master Monk examine her..."

Kongheng listened silently at the side while Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back, eyes fixed on him. Only after An Siwei had left did Li Ximing ask softly, "Master Monk... is there any way to resolve this?"

Kongheng could only shut his eyes and shake his head, replying, "Let us examine the lady first."

The three rode the wind down to the peak and took their seats in the hall. Li Ximing held his tea, thinking for a few moments, while Lady An entered from outside. She had a rounder face and looked gentler than Lady Xu. She stepped forward nervously, about to bow, but was quickly helped up by Li Xuanxuan.

Kongheng glanced over her, took her pulse, and began forming hand seals. He examined her twice with dharma light, confirming there were no signs of reincarnation within her. He dared not divine further. Instead, he fell into thought, recalling the appearance of Lady Xu before her death. After a moment of silent consideration, he gave a slight nod.

Li Ximing remained motionless, still staring into his tea. Li Xuanxuan spoke hoarsely, "You may go."

"Yes, sir." Lady An answered softly and stepped out of the hall.

Only then did the narrow-eyed monk speak in a low voice, "I examined her carefully. The lady’s condition is not severe. Had I been within the family earlier, using Buddhist secret techniques to nourish life and preserve fate, I might’ve been able to save Lady Xu."

Li Xuanxuan let out a slow breath of relief. Li Ximing finally raised his brow and asked with emphasis, "Is there any hope for the child? Will Jiang’ao have any abnormalities in the future?"

Kongheng looked troubled and answered softly, "The matter of the young master is beyond me. Judging by his appearance... I fear it does not bode well. We must observe him closely over the coming years..."

Li Jiang’ao’s mouthful of fangs and greedy gaze still lingered in Li Ximing’s mind. He figured Kongheng’s ‘does not bode well’ was likely an understatement, and said, "Will this child of Lady An be like Jiang’ao as well?"

"I cannot say for certain..." Kongheng replied, "Fate and bloodline are influenced by spiritual energy, spiritual aura, time of birth, and parentage... Even in Great Wei, Northern Qi, and Great Liang, the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Realms cultivators still struggle to fully grasp such things. It is beyond what I can weigh or determine...

"However..."

He smiled wryly as he continued, "Bright Yang yields many offspring. There are often children even among Foundation Establishment Realm and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Surely there will be one among them who can carry on the great cause..."

Kongheng had made himself clear. Li Ximing nodded and told him to go check on Lady An, then lowered his gaze again.

Li Xuanxuan sat uneasily, and softly said, "And what should be done with Jiang’ao..."

"Raise him." Li Ximing responded calmly, "Since Kongheng can preserve the mother, then let Zhouwei marry a few more. Let him observe closely."

Li Xuanxuan could only agree and added, "And regarding Lady Xu..."

"Keep it quiet for now." Li Ximing was silent for a moment before suddenly saying, "I don't know whether Zhouwei will resist this arrangement. He seems to have some genuine feelings for his concubine. But he knows what’s at stake, so he’ll follow the plan."

Li Xuanxuan glanced at his grandson with a trace of unfamiliarity. His golden robe shimmered brilliantly in the sunlight. With his cultivation now at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, even his features looked somewhat indistinct beneath the glowing light.

Li Ximing sipped his tea and said heavily, "Though Li Xuanfeng wields a divine bow and is unmatched in archery, he may not be able to protect the family once he falls into the Azure Pond Sect’s hands. Aunt and Xizhi are missing in the demonic mists. Wushao's life is uncertain, and we don’t know how many of those who went north will return."

He looked into Li Xuanxuan’s aged face and said softly, "The path to Purple Mansion is dim and distant. A Bright Yang bloodline appears only once in centuries. We must preserve it, whether it’s like a wolf or a tiger. Even if it’s nothing like its father, it’s still better than mediocrity.

"If Bright Yang proves too wild, then let Li Jiang’ao be used. Though he is not human in nature, beasts too know how to mate! With enough generations and offspring, surely one will emerge with human temperament and extraordinary talent!"

"You..." Li Xuanxuan fell into stunned silence. He had not expected those words. Li Ximing had not said anything unreasonable, but to his ears, it sounded cold and devoid of emotion. When he took in the radiant Bright Yang aura around the young cultivator before him, the old man suddenly realized, He was no longer that headstrong child devoted solely to cultivation. Now, his cultivation stands at a height where the entire family has to heed him...

And yet, that same ruthless nature remains. If things continue like this, what place will the family laws and ancestral codes hold? In a hundred years, chaos will surely rise—only the Bright Yang bloodline flourishing while the other four branches are cast aside? What a farce that would be!

He paused for a moment, then spoke in a gentle tone, "There’s no need to rush. Perhaps a turning point still lies ahead."

Li Ximing nodded and asked quietly, "Shall I go north and see what can be done? Offer some aid?"

Li Xuanxuan would never agree to that, and he responded tactfully, "It’s enough that you care. But you mustn’t go north again."

"I’ll head back to refine pills. If anything comes up, simply send for me," said Li Ximing.

Li Ximing bowed and left, but his words remained heavy in the old man’s chest. Li Xuanxuan brooded deeply, The balance between the four bloodlines relies entirely on the close upbringing with the Qingdu bloodline. But if Bright Yang’s descendants grow strong... Bright Yang is already domineering, how could they treat mortals as equals? They may well claim sole legitimacy and scorn the other four lines.

He didn’t know whether he’d live to see that day, but Li Xuanxuan had seen too much in his time. As he leaned back in his seat, he pondered, I must speak with Xijun about this... but I’ve no idea how his injuries have fared.

If not for the treasured panacea, the Earth-View Bloodstone, Li Xijun would have perished at the lake that day. He had been in closed-door cultivation for years with no word. The old man had never dared disturb him.

When Li Ximing exited the hall and approached his Alchemy Pavilion, he found several people already waiting outside. An Siwei stood in front, with a middle-aged man that was around thirty-something behind him. The man was accompanied by a woman and clutching a small child in his arms.

Li Ximing paused, casting a questioning look toward An Siwei. The middle-aged man behind him immediately stepped forward and bowed. "Father..."

"Oh!" Li Ximing was momentarily stunned before responding, "Chengzhen..."

The man before him was his eldest son, Li Chengzhen. Born without a spiritual orifice, he had been sent down the mountain early in life. Li Ximing spent his days in closed-door cultivation, so years often went by with a single blink. Thus, he could no longer recognize his own son.

The middle-aged and clearly nervous Li Chengzhen quickly brought the child forward. "Father! I know your time is precious. After I was betrothed to my wife, we soon had a son Zhouming. You were in seclusion, and we didn’t dare enter the mountain. Today, the boy has been tested and was found to have a spiritual orifice... I truly didn’t dare delay, so I came up the mountain, thick-skinned as it may be!"

Even with a heart of stone, Li Ximing couldn’t move for a moment after hearing that. He pulled the child closer to inspect him, and upon further examination, confirmed that the child’s innate ability was, indeed, very poor.

"Grandfather..."

The child called out with wide, hopeful eyes. Li Ximing could only take his hand. A bittersweet ache welled in his heart, and unable to face them, he waved a hand to hide his emotions, "Let him stay here for now. You may leave if there’s nothing else."

The couple thanked him profusely and withdrew. For some reason, Li Ximing suddenly asked, "How have the two of them been living?"

An Siwei answered quietly, "According to the rules of the family chief, mortals born from the direct descendant may not engage in trade, hold authority, annex land, or inherit property... The young master now makes a living by teaching."

Li Ximing instructed someone to take the child away and watched as everything was settled. He noticed the boy had even brought his luggage along in advance. An indescribable feeling stirred within him.

He murmured, "Take me to see where they live."

An Siwei obeyed, and the two rode the wind down, swiftly passing over rows of orderly buildings under the chill of late winter. A trail of scattered lights led them to a small house in town, where they stopped.

The house was far from luxurious; it was just a simple dwelling. The roof tiles were blackened, some even cracked and unrepaired.

Li Ximing had been delayed for quite some time, and it was already deep into the night. The couple had gone to the bedroom. He stood atop the roof, staring at a particular crack, and didn’t move.

With the enhanced hearing of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, he could hear everything clearly from the rooftop, including his daughter-in-law’s voice.

"Now that we have someone to rely on, Ming’er’s future cultivation path will surely be smoother."

Li Ximing slightly lifted his chin at those words.

"Exactly!" Li Chengzhen’s tone was no longer soft or submissive. There was a trace of pride in his voice as he spoke craftily, "Besides... Father has no one close to him. The north keeps calling for reinforcements, and I heard we just lost again. Surely, another round of conscription is coming.

"Alchemists are known to be poor at combat, right? Think about it... if we get lucky and something happens to him in the north, all his possessions will go to Zhouming. No need to split it further!"

The woman beside him suddenly gasped in realization, "Husband... what brilliant thinking! The estate of a Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist, who knows how many elixirs and pills he’s got... Maybe even Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts..."

The couple discussed delightedly, while An Siwei listened with sweat forming on his brow. His expression grew darker with every word. On the other hand, Li Ximing remained calm. He raised a hand to stop him, then took flight without looking back, heading toward the mountain.

The moon hung bright in the sky, its silver glow falling across his face. Li Ximing waved his hand.

"No need to report this to the family chief. Let me be the heartless one first. I can’t blame others, wishing for my death is only human. As for double-faced words, honeyed speech, veiled daggers, and scheming for gain..."

He said softly, "My father taught me the same way. He won’t need his father to teach him. After a few rounds in the mortal world, he’ll figure it out himself. Perhaps he’ll be better than I was."

————

By the shores of Moongaze Lake.

Li Zhouwei descended on the wind and landed on the lakeside. The snow atop Moongaze Lake had melted, and early spring greenery was spreading along the shore, painting a pleasant scene.

In the end, Xu Peiyu was merely a concubine. He buried her at the foot of Lijing Mountain. The guards and maids were strictly watched, and no word had leaked out. Li Jiang’ao’s birth, too, remained a silent affair, known only to a few from Qingdu.

He walked along the shore for a while, slowly settling his thoughts. He hadn’t truly loved Xu Peiyu. Bright Yang blood often seduced others, and those with weak wills fell quickly into carnal desire. He had thought himself generous by giving her the status and life she wanted. She’d lived contentedly... and yet died suddenly, because of all this.

As Li Zhouwei continued walking, someone came forward to report. An Siwei’s voice was low and heavy, "Your Highness, someone from the north has arrived again."

Though An Siwei was normally reserved, he had reason to be upset. His father, An Zheyan, had just gone missing in the north, and cultivators like Chen Mufeng, Li Wen, and Li Minggong had all vanished. Now the Azure Pond Sect had sent someone again, likely to conscript more.

Li Zhouwei had expected it; it had only arrived later than he’d thought. He lifted himself on the wind and asked, "Who did they send? Where is Zhao Tinggui?"

An Siwei descended into the mountain with him and replied, "The envoy calls himself Ning Heyuan."

It’s him!

When Li Zhouwei reached the front of the hall, he could already hear Li Xuanxuan’s polite voice from afar. The elder offered pleasantries, to which Ning Heyuan replied with a laugh, "Elder, you are too kind! I visited your esteemed family once before, when I was young and brash. I even crossed hands with Daoist Qinghong back then."

Li Zhouwei stepped sideways into the hall. Li Ximing had yet to arrive, so he stood off to the side. Ning Heyuan glanced at him briefly, then took a second, longer look. He quietly mused to himself, This must be the heir of the Li Family. I’ve heard his cultivation talent rivals even Li Ximing’s, and has the temperament and means to match. Though at a glance... he appears bold and overbearing more than anything else...

Though calculations churned in his mind, he didn’t show it, and instead smiled as he spoke, "Back then, a single sword strike slew Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from the Fei Family. The sect sent my aunt to investigate, and I came along for the visit. I was still quite ignorant in those days."

His words were sincere and carried a weight of reminiscence. Then he shifted the topic with a sigh, "Tang Shedu acted decisively and handed us a crushing defeat along with the fall of Mount Yan Pass. Thankfully, my brother-in-law came through unharmed. He should be following behind a Daoist Master now or perhaps even seizing some new fortune. So, senior, there’s no need for worry."

The tension in Li Xuanxuan’s heart eased significantly. At that moment, Li Ximing entered the hall. Ning Heyuan greeted him politely, then asked quietly, "Have Xizhi or Qinghong returned yet?"

Li Xuanxuan silently shook his head. Ning Heyuan’s heart sank as he thought, troublesome.

Then Li Xuanxuan countered with a question, "Now that Mount Yan Pass has fallen... what of Zhao Tinggui and the others?"

"Tinggui died in battle... My Moon Lake Peak lost over half its forces, including three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators!"

Ning Heyuan’s tone was grave. Clearly, Moon Lake Peak had suffered devastating losses in the affair. Though they still had many contingencies, they could not protect as thoroughly as when Yuan Su lived.

Still, it was better than Yuanwu Peak... thought Ning Heyuan.

Ning Heyuan paused before continuing, "The sect has formed a new defensive line along the southern bank of the Great River. Considering your family suffered significant losses, only Ximing is required to go among the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. However, since your family still has ample Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, we’ll need to draw several of them."

Before the three could respond, he took a jade box from his robe and presented it, saying, "The sect... also offers compensation."

He opened the box in front of them, revealing two glistening, perfectly round, pure white pills. A wave of rich fragrance burst forth as soon as the box opened.

Essence Gathering Pill.

These pills were all too familiar. They were highly coveted by countless families and used to aid in Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation. Li Ximing gave them a quick glance, while Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard in thoughtful silence.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝐰𝚎𝕓𝐧𝚘𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝕞

Ning Heyuan spoke gently, "The sect master has ordered that every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator lost among the major families be compensated one-to-one with an Essence Gathering Pill. Qinghong had earned some merit before, and since your family suffered losses at Mount Yan Pass, two pills are granted to your family first."

He cupped his hands respectfully and said, "If any of your Foundation Establishment Realm direct descendents have perished in the north, once verified, the sect will likewise provide additional Essence Gathering Pills in compensation."




# Chapter 822: Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens

Li Ximing and Li Xuanxuan were both slightly surprised. Ning Heyuan then took out a long jade box from his hand and said softly, “As for this item, it is a gift from my Moon Lake Peak to your esteemed family, and also a token of sincerity from the Ning Family...”

He opened the jade box, revealing six neatly arranged command tokens that emitted a silvery glow. The moment the box was opened, there was a sudden crackling explosion.

Crackle...

Li Xuanxuan looked closely. Each of the six tokens bore a unique pattern and brimmed with silvery lightning. Thunder punishment aura surged out, interwoven with dazzling silver light.

Ning Heyuan said softly, “This item was originally a treasured possession of Daoist Master Yuan Su of our family. It was obtained from the Eastern Sea and is called the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens. It is a rare complete set among Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts... Since Qinghong cultivates thunder arts, I found this set to send over.”

Li Ximing understood at a glance that this dharma artifact was no ordinary item. The Ning Family had indeed paid a heavy price.

Ning Heyuan solemnly continued, “It is said this set of dharma artifacts is several centuries old. The Daoist Master mentioned it was modeled after the Sixfold Quaking Profound Thunder Tokens, which were themselves derived from the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling. It holds many marvelous applications.

“The one who crafted these artifacts must have studied the original Sixfold Quaking Profound Thunder Tokens and grasped some of their subtleties. However, limited by his own abilities, he failed multiple times. It took six attempts in total for him to complete it.

“Later, the creator reworked those six tokens and finally produced this current set, the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens.”

Li Ximing examined them for a while. Ning Heyuan then hesitated and said, “I just don’t know how Qinghong is doing now. Our peak also doesn’t have any Bright Yang dharma artifacts suitable for Ximing... After much searching, only this set of Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens seemed appropriate.”

Ning Heyuan laid out the benefits clearly, then continued to try and persuade them, “Furthermore... your esteemed family lies just north of Yue. If the Great River cannot be held... Moongaze Lake is next. Stationing forces there isn’t just for the sake of Moon Lake and the Azure Pond Sect, but for your family’s own protection as well...”

The Li Family had no real power to refuse. Ning Heyuan had given solid benefits and clearly explained the pros and cons. What words of rejection could Li Xuanxuan still offer? He could only look up at Li Ximing.

Li Ximing merely nodded heavily and replied, “I will obey the order.”

“Good, good, good...” Ning Heyuan nodded and said softly, “Ximing, depart within three days... Your family must send five late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators and six mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators along with you. As for Embryonic Breathing Realm and early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, your family may decide as you see fit. My task is heavy, and I still need to visit the next family... I won’t delay further.”

He bowed respectfully and departed, riding the wind. He left behind the two jade boxes in the hall. Li Ximing picked up the one containing the Essence Gathering Pills, examined it, and said, “The pattern doesn’t resemble a Human Pill, nor does it match the Azure Pond Sect’s pill-refining techniques. It used a few demonic creatures... likely something Azure Pond Sect acquired from elsewhere. It feels quite familiar...”

Li Xuanxuan looked up. After carefully examining it for a long while, Li Ximing exhaled softly and confirmed, “It's the Xiao Family’s method...”

Identifying the origin of a pill based on its refinement method was an incredibly difficult task. Li Ximing normally wouldn’t have this ability, but he had studied under Xiao Yuansi, and had seen all these techniques before.

“If my guess is right, this batch of Essence Gathering Pills was likely refined by Master, or perhaps even by Daoist Master Chuting himself.”

Li Xuanxuan put away the jade box containing the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens and said slowly, “They’ve become generous now...”

Li Zhouwei exchanged a glance with him and said softly, “It’s simply that Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are too scarce in Jiangnan. They’re urgently supplying the families with Essence Gathering Pills so the old family elders and younger Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators can attempt breakthroughs. Only then can the situation be stabilized by the new Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.”

Li Xuanxuan voiced the concern first. “But Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators...”

Their family no longer had as many Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators as before. When he calculated what manpower they had available, especially late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, they were truly stretched thin.

He continued, “Shamoli is already at late-stage, and Donghe must go as well. If I include myself... we’re still short by two... Sigh! Chenghui is still at the Eastern Sea and has also reached late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm by now...

“Let Chenghuai and Chengliao go...”

Li Ximing let out a deep breath and said, “Chenghuai’s cultivation is still a bit lacking, but he can reach the late-stage with a Talisman Pill.”

Only Chengliao, Minggong, Chenghuai, and Chenghui remained among Radiant Lure generation’s outstanding juniors. Now that Minggong’s whereabouts were unknown, once they obeyed this conscription order, only Chenghui in the Eastern Sea would remain...

Li Zhouwei watched for a moment, then sent people to make arrangements and carefully went over the name list. Inwardly, he thought, It truly is... the end of a generation’s strength...

————

Eastern Sea.

Li Xizhi and his companions rode the water veins, weaving through the surging undercurrents of the sea. Li Quantao’s Waterwall Pearl was exceptionally useful, gathering white water to form a giant sturgeon that sped through the current at incredible speed.

Though severely injured, the dharma artifact’s radiance did not fade in the slightest. It even maintained a high speed spell art on its own, clearly demonstrating the extraordinary marvels of this ancient dharma artifact.

Yu Yuwei is most likely dead... thought Li Xizhi.

Although Yu Yuwei didn’t have many years left, Li Xizhi hadn’t expected him to stay behind to cover their retreat. Whatever the reason, they now owed the old man a debt of gratitude.

Beside them, Li Quantao appeared dejected and distraught. After swallowing several pills, his complexion improved slightly, though anxiety still lingered on his face.

As they traveled through the seawater, they gradually neared the Shallow Sea coast. Faint, thunderous rumbles could still be heard, most likely from cultivators engaged in battle above. From time to time, a streak of fierce and violent sword light slashed into the water, causing the water veins to tremble. This area was near Wanyu Sword Gate, so it was likely the sword gate’s disciples.

The group was in poor condition and had no desire to stir trouble. They traveled swiftly with the current. They had originally planned to land at Lake Xian dock under Profound Peak Gate’s control. However, with the conflict between north and south, much of Lake Xian had already fallen into the hands of devil cultivators, forcing them to head further south.

However, just as they emerged from the water vein, they discovered the surrounding waters were already tightly sealed off. Not only had the route from the Eastern Sea back to the inland been blocked, but a figure riding the wind immediately approached and shouted coldly, “Cultivators from which sect? Report your names! This is Wanyu Sword Gate’s Raising Sword Ferry.”

Li Xizhi actually felt more at ease at this. After all, the Sword Gate was a strict orthodox gate. Since they weren’t devil cultivators, there was nothing to fear.

He had previously encountered members of the Sword Gate, who were openly hostile toward the Azure Pond Sect but held a favorable impression of the Li Family. So he was prepared enough to cup his hands in salute as he replied, “Cultivators of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake, we request permission to pass through your ferry crossing.”

“The Li Family?” Sure enough, the cultivator’s tone on the other side softened slightly, though a heavy wariness remained as he said in a deep voice, “Do you have any credentials? Chunyi and Crimson Reef have frequently raided our immortal islands recently. Our sect has tightened inspections, please forgive us...”

“Credentials...” Li Xizhi was suddenly a bit embarrassed. After all, their family’s name had limited renown, and showing their jade token would likely be meaningless. So he could only reply quietly, “I once had some acquaintance with Daoist Cheng Jinzhu... Might he be present now?”




# Chapter 823: Searching

"Daoist Jinzhu..." The cultivator paused, speaking with some doubt, "Fellow Daoist, the Daoist has already gone to Splitreed Island, and there's no way to verify your identity at this time. What a pity."

His tone wavered slightly, but fearing they had chosen this time precisely because Cheng Jinzhu wasn’t present, he finally said in a firm voice, "Do the three of you have any other proof? I’m afraid I can’t just let you through based on your words alone."

Li Xizhi immediately felt awkward. The sword gate most likely wouldn't give face to the Azure Pond Sect. If he took out the Azure Pond Sect jade token now, it would not only be ineffective, but the contradiction in actions would also arouse suspicion.

He gripped his sword, just about to speak, when Li Qinghong behind him stepped forward. A streak of bright lightning appeared in her hand, purple and shimmering like a swimming fish.

She spoke gracefully, "I am Li Qinghong of Moongaze Lake. I cultivate the ancient art of the Thunder Dao, might this serve as proof..."

The cultivator carefully examined the lightning in her hand and considered the details. At last, he relented and said after a moment’s thought, "Since you're from the Li Family, it's only right that our sword gate offers some assistance. I see all of you are injured; several elders from our sect are heading to Wu State’s Great Western Plains. Why not travel with them and disembark at Moongaze Lake along the way?"

The Sword Gate truly acts with integrity... thought Li Xizhi.

How could Li Xizhi not understand the arrangement? Since they didn’t look like villains and their identity was still unverified, the sword gate was choosing to escort them all the way to the Li Family. If they were devil cultivators in disguise, it would all be exposed the moment they met the real family.

It was a sound plan, but quite troublesome for the sword gate. Li Xizhi thought to himself that if it were him guarding the ferry crossing, he would’ve just turned them away. He wouldn’t have gone to such lengths.

Li Quantao nodded, having a good impression of the sword gate. He used a secret technique to transmit his voice and advised, Brother Zhi, the sword gate has been an upright gate for many years. They won’t harm us...

"Then we’ll trouble your sect."

Li Xizhi gave a nod in response. The cultivator’s expression softened like spring thawing ice, and he said gently, "Then follow me quickly. If we miss the scheduled time, that’ll be a real problem."

The group followed him across the ferry crossing. The refined architecture of Wanyu Sword Gate had a distinctive sharpness, embodying the style of sword cultivators. The pavilions were connected by walkways, with eaves curving sharply upward, creating a striking scene.

A large sword ship of the sect was anchored at the ferry dock. A sword cultivator, dressed in a simple black robe, stood in front of it with a bright white longsword strapped to his back. He had narrow eyes and long brows, and was gazing westward.

"Martial Uncle!" The cultivator leading the group called out and quietly explained the situation.

The elegant sword cultivator turned his head in surprise and asked, "The Li Family of Qingdu?"

He smiled faintly, the white sword on his back humming softly as he asked, "I am Cheng Gao. It’s been many years, I wonder how Brother Yuanjiao is doing? He once said he’d visit if given the chance, but I’ve never heard from him."

Li Xizhi was startled to hear this and could only reply, "My father perished in Mirage Mirror Heaven... It’s been eighteen years now."

Cheng Gao paused briefly, then asked again, "Who killed him?"

"Tang Shedu..." muttered Li Xizhi.

Cheng Gao crossed his arms, observing Li Xizhi for a breath before speaking, "You’re his son? Then there’s no need to wait in the clouds, come aboard."

He waved for the sword gate disciple to step back, led the group into the sword ship, and sat down by the table. Someone came forward to serve tea, and Cheng Gao spoke quietly, "I had been cultivating my sword essence in the Eastern Sea for twenty years... I didn’t expect so many things to happen during that time. It’s truly a shame..."

Li Xizhi wasn’t sure how close Li Yuanjiao had been with this man, so he refrained from speaking. Then he saw Cheng Gao exhale and say softly, "Now that Tang Shedu has been slain by Senior Xuanfeng’s arrow, I suppose that karma has been resolved!"

Upon hearing this, Li Xizhi felt as if a great burden had lifted from his heart and finally relaxed. Cheng Gao then asked, "Are all of you from the Li Family?"

"I am Li Qinghong, younger sister of Li Yuanjiao..." Li Qinghong replied gently.

Cheng Gao nodded in a friendly manner, while Li Quantao, a bit embarrassed, said softly, "Li Quantao, from Fuchen Peak of the Azure Pond Sect."

Cheng Gao had been pouring tea into a cup, but upon hearing this, he slowly raised his head, set the teapot down, and raised an eyebrow slightly.

He asked, "Who is Li Encheng to you?"

"He is my father..." Li Quantao's voice trembled slightly as he spoke.

Cheng Gao nodded and said kindly, "Then we’re all on the same side, no need to be so formal."

Li Quantao straightened his back a little, his complexion visibly brightening. Cheng Gao glanced at him once again and said gently, "Daoist Master Guanxue was once on good terms with our sword gate and often lent us support. Though your family joined the Azure Pond Sect, the friendship remains. There’s no need to stand on ceremony, Quantao."

The others might not have understood earlier, but after Yu Yuwei’s earlier hints, they quickly caught on, The Daoist Master from Hongxue Gate!

Li Quantao froze, gripping his cup tightly. Cheng Gao said gently, "There’s no need to react like that... No matter who it was, even the Sword Immortal Donghua wasn’t perfect. Not everyone who besieged him back then was evil. Some entanglements aren’t about right or wrong, but simply fate’s mischief."

His words were like a sudden awakening, causing Li Quantao’s eyes to redden slightly as the pent-up frustration in his heart dissipated. He slowly took a sip of tea and asked, "Senior, may I ask... what exactly happened to our family’s Daoist Master?"

Cheng Gao nodded gently and rested one hand on the table as he began to explain, "Back then, the Changzhen Wondrous Arts were released when Donghua fell. All the things that had only existed in the great void with mana came tumbling down, glittering like a sky full of jewels.

"A great battle erupted over the lake, descending into chaos. Daoist Master Guanxue seized the immortal sword and secretly clutched it to his chest. He didn’t dare return to his sect, nor did he dare to flee into the great void. He simply fled westward, toward Wu State."

Cheng Gao’s expression turned wistful as he spoke softly, "It’s said that the sword was called Xueli. It was a true immortal sword.

"When he reached Sun Seeking Pond in Wu State, Daoist Master Guanxue’s injuries flared up, forcing him to stop and look for a place to enter seclusion. But that immortal sword suddenly leapt from his arms, circled once around his neck, and severed his head.

"Caught off guard, Daoist Master Guanxue was wrapped in sword qi and dared not move a muscle. He stood alone above the pond, and soon perished. The immortal sword then escaped into the great void, never to be seen again."

Since it was described as an immortal sword, Li Quantao did not question why a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would die from decapitation, and instead said, "Thank you for informing me, Senior."

Cheng Gao simply nodded and replied, "I'm heading to Ganzi Prefecture in the Great Western Plains to meet someone, so I can’t talk further now. But when you have time, do come visit me at the sword gate."

Li Quantao nodded of course. After a few sips of tea, the sword cultivator pointed beneath them and said softly, "We’ve arrived at Moongaze Lake."

A cultivator from the Li Family had already come aboard to check, and was overjoyed to see the group.

Cheng Gao nodded at the sight and quietly escorted the three out, saying, "I’ll be cultivating in Ganzi Prefecture of the Great Western Plains for the next few years. If any of you come west, feel free to visit."

He piloted the sword ship back into the sky, returned to his seat, refilled his tea, and fell into silent contemplation.

What a coincidence... Li Quantao is actually traveling with the Li Family of Qingdu... The sword cultivator took a sip of tea, deep in thought, It makes sense... The Li of Qingdu are Wei’s Li, and so are the Li from Hongxue. Helping each other is only natural.

Chengshui Tomb.

Demonic clouds rolled across the sky and muffled thunder rumbled as darkness enveloped the land. Only scattered glimmers of light shimmered in the air.

Rain pattered endlessly as Li Xuanfeng rode the wind and halted above the black waters. Demonic mists churned on the surface. The strange signs of Murong En’s death had already faded, but the black smoke was growing thicker, forming a sky-darkening shroud.

This was the outer edge of Chengshui Tomb, where things looked noticeably calmer, but the water had still turned gray. Li Xuanfeng gazed into the distance, while a plain-looking middle-aged man with two gourds tied to his waist stood next to him, his vine armor glowing faintly with dharma light.

This man was none other than Lingu Rao, also known as Raozi Scorpion, a veteran cultivator from the Azure Pond Sect who had long guarded the Southern Sea. His voice was hoarse and heavy as he said, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng, are you still able to proceed?"

Lingu Rao had actually become renowned even earlier and by seniority was more suited to the same generation as Li Tongya. But he had spent most of his life secluded in the Southern Sea and rarely socialized with people. In these borderlands, such distinctions didn’t matter much, so they simply addressed one another as fellow Daoists.

Lingu Rao didn’t know what medicine Yuan Xiu had given Li Xuanfeng, but since only three months had passed, he feared Li Xuanfeng might still be injured.

Thus he asked out of concern, and Li Xuanfeng nodded and replied, "Rest assured, fellow Daoist."

Li Xuanfeng had witnessed the various Daoist Masters slay Murong En three months ago. Relics had rained down from the great void amid torrential rain and lightning, but he hadn’t had the chance to linger as Yuan Xiu quickly took him back to Mount Bianyan.

Yuan Xiu’s stern face hadn’t changed as he took out a strange wooden bottle from his robe and instructed, "Your injuries this time aren’t serious, but both your divine spirit and body were still wounded by Maha’s techniques. This bottle holds a drop of Golden Drip Sacred Dew. Take it. You’ll recover fully within three months, and I’ll have more tasks for you afterward."

Naturally, Li Xuanfeng had accepted the medicine and consumed it in his cave dwelling. As expected of a Purple Mansion Realm item, his injuries had been completely healed in three months. But when he inquired further, the losses proved to be heavy.

"Zhuang Cheng from Golden Feather Sect was severely injured, and Lin Shouye lost a portion of his lifespan. Lingu Lanying’s Hooked Serpent died, and she herself is missing, there’s no news of the others either..."

Not only had forces from all sides suffered casualties, but the Azure Pond Sect's defensive line had also contracted significantly. It had originally been centered around Mount Bianyan, with Mount Yan Pass on one side and Baixiang Valley and Lake Xian on the other. They had once occupied the majority of Xu State.

Now, both fronts had suffered heavy losses. The eastern Baiguang Valley had fared slightly better as they retreated to the edge of Mount Yu, while the western Mount Yan Pass had fallen all the way back to the riverbanks. They only held Mount Bianyan in the central region of Xu State. The few defensive lines that remained barely covered a quarter of Xu State.

Worse still, a new force had joined in from the north, the Gao Family of Jingbo. This undoubtedly added more pressure to the Purple Mansion Realm forces in the great void. Fortunately, the Gao Family faced the Golden Feather Sect, meaning the Azure Pond Sect wouldn't have to face this demonic force directly.

Li Xuanfeng’s mission to scout Chengshui Tomb was partly due to sect orders, but also a personal search for signs of his kin. If his guess was right, Lingu Rao likely had similar intentions.

The two drifted through the demonic mists for some time. A few Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators flying over the tainted land below naturally couldn’t detect them. After circling the outskirts twice, Lingu Rao quietly used mana to transmit a message into Li Xuanfeng’s ear, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng, I have a question I’ve been meaning to ask... though I don’t know if I should."

Li Xuanfeng cast him a light glance while his spiritual sense continued scanning the ground below. He replied via mana transmission, "Speak freely, fellow Daoist."

Lingu Rao’s voice was slightly hoarse as he said quietly, "I heard you recently received a reward, a rare pill called the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill. I wonder, what are its properties?"

Li Xuanfeng had expected this question, but it wasn’t something he could answer, so he apologized, saying, "This pill was given to me by a Daoist Master. I’m afraid I cannot speak of it casually without his permission."

Though Lingu Rao’s eyes were narrow, they carried a calm and calculating glint. He looked deeply at Li Xuanfeng and said quietly, "The High Sect intends to send me to reclaim Baixiang Valley and Lake Xian in an attempt to prevent the northern devil cultivators from linking up with those in Jiangnan and the Eastern Sea... If they join forces and strengthen each other, they may launch a combined assault..."

Li Xuanfeng responded calmly, "You are powerful, fellow Daoist, and will surely not fail expectations... Sadly, I am lacking in strength. I was injured during the assault on Chengshui Tomb, and the sect has ordered me to rest. I won’t be able to accompany you."

Lingu Rao’s attention remained fixed on him, as if Li Xuanfeng’s words had confirmed certain suspicions. He looked away and replied, "You’re being modest, Xuanfeng. You’re no longer just an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, you're far beyond what I could compare to.”

"Once the sect's rewards are distributed, you too will advance greatly in strength." Li Xuanfeng responded with a polite remark, and Lingu Rao let out a long, quiet breath.

The doubts that had troubled him for some time were finally confirmed. Keeping his expression unchanged, he continued speaking through mana transmission, "Thank you, fellow Daoist."

Li Xuanfeng had already deduced much and only awaited confirmation. The reward that Lingu Rao would receive next could very well verify his suspicions.

He replied politely, "When that time comes, fellow Daoist, I hope we can spar more often."

"Of course."

The two flew for a while, conversing via mana transmission. Soon, the rolling demonic clouds began to recede, and the black waters ahead gradually turned blue. Even the demonic energy in the air was thinning.

Lingu Rao pulled out a thin piece of gauze and gently tossed it into the air. It instantly shrouded the two of them, concealing them in a veil of light so thoroughly that even an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator wouldn’t be able to detect them.

They followed the blue water for some distance before sensing the presence of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and even the familiar aura of a southern Dao lineage belonging to the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Dao lineages.

A sizable number of devil cultivators in the North also practiced methods of the Purple Mansion Dao and Golden Core Dao. However, their methods were often more extreme, frequently relying on blood essence for faster, more convenient cultivation.

To northern cultivators, the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Daos was often seen as merely a branch of devil cultivation itself and was frequently referred to as the Purple-Gold Devil Dao. Meanwhile, what was called the Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace devil Dao in Jiangnan was known in the North as the Heavenborn Devil Dao. In the end, it all came down to differing perspectives.

Thus, whenever southern and northern cultivators clashed, it was common for each side to call the other devil scum. Unless one practiced the ancient Immortal Dao of Qi Ingestion and internal cultivation, almost everyone would be labeled a devil by someone, no matter where they went.




# Chapter 825: Sensing The Opportunity

Li Xuanfeng and Lingu Rao paused above the shimmering blue waters, not venturing any farther. While Lingu Rao focused intently on the scene, Li Xuanfeng began to ponder, Since Yuan Xiu, Qiushui, and the others are already in the great void and are likely even watching directly over Chengshui Tomb. Why do we need to investigate? This blue water must be some anomaly caused by the Great Ning Palace. There must be another reason we were sent.

As he was thinking, Lingu Rao glanced twice at the blue water below and sent a mana transmission, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng, the waters above Chengshui Tomb have transformed into Converging Water. They’re certainly unnatural."

Li Xuanfeng considered the matter for a moment as he examined the luminous blue water amid the dark mist, then asked, "Could it be related to the dragon species?"

"Perhaps not the dragon species exactly..." replied Lingu Rao.

The Lingu Family originated from Mount Yue and was one of the rare families not descended from northern migrants. As native southerners, they had their own inherited knowledge.

Lingu Rao said quietly, "You may not know, but the Gao Family, now known for their True Flame, originally rose from the shores of Yan State’s Converging Sea and had a lineage tied to Converging Water. Even the Tuoba Family once attempted to seize the Converging Water and Water Mansion lineages. My concern is that transforming the entirety of Chengshui Tomb into a Converging Water marsh would take immense effort, even for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators—unless a special spiritual artifact is involved. Why go to such lengths?"

With such doubts weighing on them, one pondering the motives of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, while the other speculated about northern cultivators, the two refused to proceed farther north.

Li Xuanfeng activated his perception technique, golden light glinting in his eyes as he scanned the clouds, and asked, "Do you know what Dao lineage the royal descendants of Ning State cultivate?"

Lingu Rao thought for a moment and replied, "They cultivate the True Essence. They even have a realm called Anhuai Heaven hidden within the great void. At their peak, they had several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Whether they ever produced a True Monarch... that, we cannot say for sure."

Li Xuanfeng considered this, then raised his head in unison with Lingu Rao to look eastward. As expected, a golden immortal radiance pierced through the demonic fog. Shimmering hues of true essence and dharma artifact light reflected across the blue waters.

Lingu Rao slowly lifted his gaze, eyes contemplative, and murmured, "It’s the Golden Feather Sect."

Li Xuanfeng’s heart settled, and he activated his dharma artifact at the same time as Lingu Rao. Sure enough, he heard Lingu Rao say, "When a Daoist Master is in the great void, what could possibly escape their sight? If they ordered us to investigate, this is no simple task. So this is where it all leads."

Both men now clearly understood the situation. Li Xuanfeng paused in thought, then spoke quietly, "Why would Daoist Master Yuan Xiu conceal his intentions behind a scouting mission? It is likely the Golden Feather Sect doesn't want their own people to know. We must tread carefully."

His words hinted at the underlying discord among the sects. Lingu Rao nodded in agreement, his face revealing approval. The two rose into the wind together, following the Golden Feather Sect’s cultivators from a distance.

They had only flown a few kilometers when demonic light flickered in the air. A group of devil cultivators had broken into fierce combat with each other. Blood-red and white lights clashed, black mist surged, and droplets of blood rain fell sporadically from the sky.

Li Xuanfeng's earlier confusion began to ease as Lingu Rao commented, "No wonder we saw no patrolling devil cultivators on our way, so there was internal discord!"

Li Xuanfeng activated his perception technique again and peered into the demonic clouds. Sure enough, the sky was filled with devil cultivators locked in chaotic battle. Rays of light, demonic mist, blood essence, and pale smoke intermingled. The chaos was tearing through the sky with shattering bursts of dharma light.

High above, several figures were locked in fierce battle. A black-robed youth wielded a long spear, dark energy swirling around it. He had bright eyes, refined features, and a striking presence. His spear was pointed straight at a devil cultivator before him.

His opponent had an ugly expression on his face. Surrounded by violet light and clad in vibrant, yet ornate robes, he was likely a direct descendant of the Murong Family. The two appeared to have just clashed and now faced each other warily.

Li Xuanfeng glanced at the spear-wielding youth and was struck by a sense of familiarity. He narrowed his eyes slightly and exclaimed, "Zhong Qian?!"

This was none other than Zhong Qian, the youth who had once led Li Xuanfeng into the grotto heaven! After entering, he had vanished without a trace. Li Xuanfeng had long assumed he’d met a bad end, having heard nothing of him for years.

Never thought he’d fall to the devil Dao...

Suspicion stirred in his heart, but then he saw the Murong devil cultivator, wrapped in purple light, stare deeply at Zhong Qian and murmur, "Fellow Daoist... what game are you playing? You suddenly led troops out of formation, so surely you’ve gained the blessing of the Golden Feather Sect and the Azure Pond Sect... But as a devil cultivator, what good end awaits you in the South?

"It was Murong En who failed to recognize your talent and could not tolerate a heroic youth like you! If you back down now, I’ll personally recommend you to the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

Zhong Qian did not respond. He stood firm with his spear and thrust forward, sending black clouds rolling and striking the violet radiance. It was only when the violent clash scattered dark smoke through the air that he spoke, "Murong Gong... This is my first time clashing with the Purple Essence Dao. Let’s see some real skill!"

Li Xuanfeng watched as the two fought fiercely. Below them, devil cultivators were clashing among themselves, while buddhist cultivators released golden light in retaliation. It was impossible to tell who was fighting whom—rather, it seemed like everyone had seized the moment to settle personal grudges. After only a glance or two, he grasped the situation.

The northern forces were extremely fragmented. There were buddhist cultivators of the Seven Dharma Forms, numerous devil Daos, and even Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm cultivators. Many of them were simply devil cultivators conscripted from surrounding regions.

They were all greedy and self-serving, harboring grudges against each other while coveting one another’s possessions. Zhong Qian had secretly assembled a force and marched south, only to be intercepted. Yet the devil cultivators on both sides had already descended into chaos. They were settling old debts, seizing opportunities, and battling in a disorderly frenzy.

Lingu Rao watched for a while as he slowly grasped the situation, and said quietly, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng... looks like the devil cultivators are having a mutiny among themselves...”

Li Xuanfeng responded calmly, "If they were not backed by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, how could a mutiny like this even occur?"

Lingu Rao replied, "Exactly! But could the Golden Feather Sect really be backing these devil cultivators? That would be strange indeed..."

Lingu Rao’s confusion was understandable. These devil cultivators consumed human blood and Human Pills; their conduct and cultivation techniques were thoroughly demonic. Worse still, they had slain countless cultivators from Jiangnan. The various sects had long come to despise them.

This was true even under the Azure Pond Sect’s governance, so how could the prestigious families under the Golden Feather Sect, many of whom had suffered great losses in this war, accept devil cultivators under their banner? Where would these devil cultivators even be allowed to settle?

All sects, regardless of their foundations, had to maintain at least a semblance of morality in Jiangnan. The Azure Pond Sect was already being denounced as a demonic sect by others. Even when they harvested blood essence, they had to disguise it as inter-sect warfare. They dared not openly kill and bleed innocents.

The Golden Feather Sect’s reputation was far better than Azure Pond Sect’s. They now had the eyes of the world upon them, so how could they possibly take in a band of rebellious devil cultivators? No matter how you framed it, it simply wouldn’t make sense...

Moreover, from the perspective of the devil cultivators, allying with Golden Feather Sect was a bad deal. It didn’t matter if the Golden Feather Sect shielded them now, once the north-south conflict ended, the reckoning would come.

"Could it be that they aren’t with the Golden Feather Sect... but then why are there so many Golden Feather Sect cultivators here?"

Clang!

After watching for a few moments, Li Xuanfeng and Lingu Rao saw that the Golden Feather Sect could no longer remain idle. Their cloudship tore through the sky, its concealing mist completely dispersed, and numerous cultivators leapt from both sides in rapid succession.

"Golden Feather Sect..."

These cultivators didn’t assist Zhong Qian in the air but instead dove into the demonic mist. They launched coordinated assaults to hunt down devil cultivators. Taking advantage of Murong Gong being tied down, they deliberately avoided Zhong Qian’s men and targeted the enemy devil cultivators.

The battlefield had grown even more chaotic. Screams and angry shouts rose and fell in waves. Li Xuanfeng and Lingu Rao watched, when suddenly, a sharp screech pierced the sky. A new demonic cloud was surging toward the battlefield from the north.

"Lord Gao and Master Monk Luejin’s forces have arrived!"

A loud shout rang out over the battlefield, followed by a blast of scorching heat. Zhong Qian’s expression shifted and he retreated with a sweep of his spear, shattering the incoming fire. The tip of his spear now glowed faintly red.

A man appeared in the sky, wearing a dark red and black robe, a golden jade belt, and dark crimson boots. His eyes were deep-set and sharp as he leaned on a cavalry lance amid the clouds and sneered, "So this is all the Murong Family is capable of? Seems a century of clinging to Buddhist doctrine has ground your noble lineage into spinelessness!"

Murong Gong’s face darkened, and his voice turned cold and low, "Lou Fangjing, why don’t you try me yourself? All you do is bark."

The man in the dark red robe scowled, his tone turning icy, "Murong Gong... My Gao Family bears a northern surname personally granted by Wei Emperor Gong. It’s one thing for Daoist Masters to speak as equals, but you? You’ve no right to speak the Lou surname. Know your place..."

Murong Gong spat disdainfully, "Ha! What a noble Gao name. It was Lou Chongyang and Tuoba Changming who sold out our sixteen Eastern Hu families to beg riches from the Wei Emperor. And you still dare show your face! The Yuan Family at least reclaimed the Tuoba name. But your family still flaunts its fake lineage. Shameless beyond comparison!"

Gao Fangjing stared coldly, leaving his lance at rest as he replied softly, "My Gao ancestors were of Zhou descent, do not compare us with your kind!"

As the two exchanged barbs, a monk stepped down from the sky and stopped beside Murong Gong. His face was covered with dense golden patterns, and his eyes were tightly shut. He quietly turned toward the mist.

Li Xuanfeng watched silently. Beside him, Lingu Rao seemed uneasy and asked in a low voice, "Xuanfeng... should we intervene?"

"Wait a bit longer," said Li Xuanfeng, holding back his longbow. Sure enough, a man in Golden Feather Sect robes rose from below. He flew to Zhong Qian’s side with a grave expression, drew a thin golden sword from his robe, and held it upright in silence.

As the cultivators stared intently at each other, the monk whose face was covered in golden markings slowly opened his eyes. His pupils were a sea of white with a single grain-sized speck of gold that pierced through the mist.

He spoke softly, "You two benefactors, please reveal yourselves."

Li Xuanfeng and Lingu Rao were silent for a moment before they withdrew their near-invisible veil of gauze, allowing their figures to appear midair.

Zhong Qian initially looked up at them cautiously, but upon seeing Li Xuanfeng’s attire and face, his heart skipped a beat. A flicker of guilt crossed his expression as he sighed inwardly, It’s Senior Xuanfeng!

He had once received help from Li Xuanfeng and remembered the senior vividly. Though he now suspected it might have been orchestrated by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, the impact was real. Li Xuanfeng had truly saved him during a time of crisis.

Seeing him again as a devil cultivator filled Zhong Qian with a touch of shame.

Thankfully, we didn’t meet in the midst of battle... a small mercy within misfortune.

The Golden Feather Sect Daoist clearly hadn’t expected their appearance and offered a slight, surprised bow toward the two.

The devil cultivator camp reacted more dramatically. The gold-marked buddhist cultivator examined them quietly, while Murong Gong’s face twisted with a mix of fear and hatred. His lips moved, and he sneered coldly, "A Shilou dog! Your Wei-blooded kin has arrived!"

Gao Fangjing appeared not to hear his words. He carefully studied Li Xuanfeng in silence, though the grip on his spear noticeably tightened.

The appearance of the two caused a tense stalemate in the sky, until Murong Gong finally muttered darkly, "What are you two waiting for?"

Boom!

A burst of mana light exploded in the sky. The gold-marked monk clasped his hands together, catching Lingu Rao’s curved blade. Gao Fangjing twirled his lance, encircling the two, and a surge of golden-red true flame erupted, forcing them to raise their dharma artifacts in defense.

Murong Gong raised his head, locking eyes with Li Xuanfeng. Radiant lines began to glow along the lower half of his face. He slowly lifted his longbow, a speck of golden light resting on the string.

"Damn it!"

He stepped closer on violet energy, already regretting his earlier words. Had he known Li Xuanfeng and the others would appear, he’d never have provoked Gao Fangjing. He had simply thought everything under control and let disdain slip through.

Though he looked down on the Shilou Family and scorned their character, Gao Fangjing’s strength was undeniably superior, and the best suited to face Li Xuanfeng.

Fine then... the Shilou Family are petty men. Provoked or not, they’d never step in anyway.

This thought flashed through his mind in an instant. A buzzing rang in his ears, and pain stabbed his chest. He instantly formed a seal and summoned a mass of violet clouds, plunging into them to evade the arrow's light.

It was, indeed, the best move. Li Xuanfeng’s name had grown well-known, and enemies no longer dared to face his magical arrows head-on. They would always dodge first. If one didn’t have Astral Qi to trace a target, this violet mist technique was quite effective, and even Li Xuanfeng couldn’t locate him at once.
𝑓𝘳𝘦𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝘯ℴ𝘷𝘦𝓁.𝑐𝑜𝑚

Yet Li Xuanfeng’s expression didn’t shift. Ignoring Murong Gong’s hasty retreat, Li Xuanfeng lightly raised his longbow and released the golden string. Nearby, the gold-marked monk suddenly jerked his head up and started coughing out blood.

The monk gently swept a hand across his chest, and the gaping wound slowly closed. He caught Lingu Rao’s spell art with one hand and called out in a resonant voice, "Daoist Murong..."

Before he could finish, he saw Li Xuanfeng's golden bow aimed at the violet mist. The man’s gaze was calm and unwavering. Murong Gong found himself caught between advancing and retreating, and shifted the violet cloud to lunge toward Lingu Rao instead.

"Master Monk Luejin! Since you're not afraid of bodily harm, go deal with that one!" said Murong Gong.

Master Monk Luejin showed no anger. The golden markings on his face shimmered faintly, and a gentle look rose in his eyes.

He brought his hands together before his chest in a respectful gesture and said softly, "I am Luejin, of White Horse Temple under the Great Mahayana Dharma Realm. Greetings, benefactor."

Li Xuanfeng scrutinized him. This man’s mana emanated an uncommon clarity; it was utterly different from the many buddhist cultivators he had seen before. In fact, he bore a faint resemblance to the guest cultivator Kongheng from his own household.

But the battlefield left no room for an extended exchange. Li Xuanfeng raised his bow, brilliant golden light condensing on the string as usual.

Luejin stared intently at the arrow’s glow, his voice calm and low, "The arrow is a weapon that harms, it cannot appear in the Buddha’s land."




# Chapter 827: Chang Yun

As his lips parted, a streak of golden light emerged and rippled outward like waves. Luejin retreated a step, coughing up two droplets of blood, and a small hole appeared on his chest.

Li Xuanfeng frowned slightly. His last arrow’s strength had clearly weakened. As he drew his bow again, he saw Luejin retrieve a scroll from his sleeve. He held it with both hands and gently shook it open.

Countless shimmering golden runes burst from the scripture, scattering through the air like rain and filling the sky before him. But Li Xuanfeng had already struck him twice and paid it no mind as he loosed the golden light from his bowstring.

Buzz...

Luejin’s dharma body trembled, and he coughed up more blood. Realizing his technique was ineffective, he hesitated for only two breaths before opening his lips to chant a spell.

Li Xuanfeng felt a murmured chant stream into his ears, causing his mind to twist in pain. The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed floating above his qi sea did not stir and release a cool current as it once had. It remained still, and was trembling faintly in the air.

"Just as I thought..."

Li Xuanfeng had already sensed something was off back in the Pristine Heaven’s Pool Below of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. When Maha Pi Jia attacked, he had never felt the cooling sensation of the talisman seed. Instead, he had been fully exposed to the multicolored light.

He had only vaguely realized it then, but now the truth was clear in his heart, I consumed the Human Pill. Although the talisman seed didn’t immediately vanish due to certain reasons, it has already detached from my qi sea. All my current cultivation stems from borrowing its power. To seek its protection again... would be difficult.

His head throbbed with pain and his eyes narrowed, but his grip on the bow remained steady. A flash of golden light burst outward, aimed once again at Luejin.

Master Monk Luejin observed him closely, but couldn’t tell if his spell had taken effect. However, the more intense Li Xuanfeng’s headache grew, the less he delayed. He nocked five arrows on the string in an instant, and their buzzing echoed swiftly through the mist.

A strong sense of danger welled up in Luejin’s heart. He formed a hand seal, and the scattered golden light condensed into a kasaya of glittering light that draped over his body.

As their duel reached a critical moment, the other battle was also heating up. Gao Fangjing nearby was engulfed in golden-red True Flame. His cavalry lance swept forth, creating arcs of red light that forced his two opponents into retreat. Golden-red brilliance blazed from his eyes, and the searing True Flame boiled mist from beneath his feet.

Zhong Qian’s spear had turned red-hot from the heat. The Golden Feather Sect cultivator beside him was wreathed in black smoke, and the golden sword in his hand was already warping.

He urgently transmitted using a secret technique, “Senior masters, please help us... This man is truly difficult to handle!”

True Flame was among the top-tier spiritual flames for refining artifacts, and known for melting dharma artifacts with ease. Gao Fangjing was used to rendering enemy gear useless halfway into a fight.

He chuckled darkly, “You cultivate Geng Metal, yet foolishly draw in both metal and water qi to have it both ways. Running into my blazing True Flame? That’s just your bad luck!”

Boom!

Just as he finished speaking, an explosive crack burst out beside him. Luejin’s kasaya had been shattered, sending golden streams of light flying everywhere. His entire dharma body was covered in cracks as it flickered with multicolored lights.

One hand clutched the massive hollow in his chest, while the other was pressed against his lips. His eyes gleamed startlingly bright, and his voice echoed through the air like a grand bell. Li Xuanfeng's fist was clenched pale, the markings on his face flickering in and out of visibility.

Luejin’s incantation didn’t just cause pain, it seemed to carry the power of awakening and repentance. It was clearly targeted specifically at Li Xuanfeng. As the chanting grew faster, the Heavenly Gilded Helm within his qi sea suddenly stirred, showing signs of unrest.

However, he stared coldly at Luejin, slowly raised his longbow, and a golden-red arrow rose into the air to gracefully settle onto the string.

Buzz... Buzz...

The golden-red radiance shone so brilliantly that even the fiercely battling Gao Fangjing turned to glance to the side. The golden brilliance swept across Li Xuanfeng’s face and shoulders, flowing behind him as his eyes stayed locked on Luejin, whose complexion grew increasingly pale.

Clang...

Light flashed past and the grand bell-like resonance finally faded, replaced by rapid and forceful chanting. A golden kasaya appeared on Luejin’s body once again, but it was already too late.

Boom!

A heavy glow flickered, and the golden-red brilliance was suspended in midair, revealing the true form of the arrow. It was densely inscribed with glowing runes. The arrow had been caught between two fingers. An old monk had appeared in front of Luejin, his long eyebrows tinged with white, as he carefully examined the arrow in his hand.

Li Xuanfeng waited for two seconds. As expected, Yuan Xiu’s stern and disapproving voice came from beside him. “Daoist friend, you’ve broken the rules.”

This figure was likely The Merciful One of the Great Mahayana Dharma Realm. Unlike the usual three-headed, six-armed depictions, he looked like an ordinary monk.

He pulled Luejin back a step and said in a hoarse voice, “Indeed.”

Their figures quickly faded. Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow slightly and saw Daoist Master Qiushui now standing before the cultivators of the Golden Feather Sect. After waiting a moment, a rich golden aura surged into the sky, coalescing beside Zhong Qian.

“Thank you, fellow Daoists.”

The Daoist Master beside Zhong Qian stood shrouded in a golden mist and nodded slightly. Zhong Qian appeared to know him already and stood respectfully by his side. The devil cultivator entourage also quickly gathered at his feet.

“No need for courtesy, Daoist Master Chang Yun,” Yuan Xiu replied.

Master Chang Yun’s voice was crisp and efficient as he smiled. “I’ve spent many years in the Eastern Sea, always hoping to found a sect on the mainland. But until now, I hadn’t found a place to settle. Xu State is truly a fine land.”

Daoist Master Qiushui nodded with a smile, “It was your well-laid preparations that turned the tide for us. From today onward, our Golden Feather Sect and your order share the bond of founding sects together. The north-south contention is nearing its end; may you steward Xu State’s treasured lands well. Your sect may rival any other.”

So that’s how it is!

Li Xuanfeng exchanged a glance with Lingu Rao, both seeing realization in the other’s eyes. These devil cultivators weren’t truly joining the Golden Feather Sect, they were backed by an overseas Daoist Master!

These devil cultivators would soon establish sects under this Daoist Master’s command in Xu State, allowing the Cyan Plume Sect and the Azure Pond Sect to remain clean of association. Even Li Xuanfeng and Lingu Rao were merely ‘investigating’ the area and had only acted accordingly.

After all, founding sects as devil cultivators—, we can’t afford to appear too close... Lingu Rao chuckled coldly in his heart, But give it a hundred years, and they’ll be washed clean—just another orthodox sect in Xu State...

“Hahahaha!” Daoist Master Chang Yun laughed heartily, his gaze pausing on Li Xuanfeng. Just as he was about to speak, he jerked to the side. The other Daoist Masters turned in unison toward the center of Chengshui Tomb.

A shimmering light was descending from the sky, radiating an alluring glow. Li Xuanfeng stared at it for a moment and thought, It must be the Great Ning Palace... Judging from the Daoist Masters’ tones, the ultimate goal of both the northern and southern Dao lineages is this Great Ning Palace!




# Chapter 828: Ready And Set To Depart

Daoist Master Chang Yun paused briefly and then spoke, “It’s the Great Mahayana Dharma Realm again. They still shrink from battle, even at such a critical juncture. Any thoughts, fellow Daoists?”

The three Daoist Masters were far from ordinary. However, the Great Mahayana Dharma Realm was renowned among Buddhist cultivators for their survival skills. While Li Xuanfeng’s arrow was powerful, the monk’s rescue of Luejin had been rough and imprecise. It was more like taking the opportunity to withdraw than an act of necessity.

Daoist Master Qiushui said slowly, “There’s nothing surprising about it. The Great Mahayana Dharma Realm has always been like this. Half ancient, half modern, and ever wavering. If not for that, they wouldn’t have fallen from being the premier Buddhist sect to where they are now.”

Daoist Master Yuan Xiu disliked Buddhist cultivators the most, but even his sarcasm carried his usual solemness, “The monks see profit in the south and drool with desire. But when they witness slaughter by the thousands and blood flooding the land, their scriptures suddenly come to mind. They cry ‘sin, sin’ and tuck their tails to retreat.

“Isn’t it always the same? Binding today’s cultivators with ancient rules only ends in a mess, just like that White Horse Temple of theirs.”

His words were sharp, and the other two Daoist Masters didn’t know how to respond. Daoist Master Qiushui chuckled inwardly, No wonder those two seniors always argue, Tiaoxiao’s words are sharp by nature, and though Si Boxiu disdains mockery, he’s no slouch when it comes to sarcasm either.

Daoist Master Chang Yun awkwardly looked away, and his interest was caught by the deep blue Converging Water beneath his feet. He seemed lost in thought, hesitated a moment, then suddenly spoke, “I’ve only just emerged from seclusion and tore through the great void to rush here. However, this vast expanse of Converging Water at Chengshui Tomb struck me as odd. Who conjured it? Or is it the work of some special spirit artifact?”

Yuan Xiu didn’t hold him in high regard and sneered inwardly. He’s from the Eastern Sea, that’s why he’s always cautious about everything... He’s naturally wary of any interference from the Dragon Clan.

Yet his aged face only shifted slightly as he replied, “No. Daoist Friend Kan used the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, combined with the artifact’s natural effect, to transform this place into a marsh. The Murong Family, leveraging the principle of Water Virtue, converted that marsh into Converging Water, thus creating this great lake.”

“I see! I had thought the north had employed some kind of spirit artifact.” Daoist Master Chang Yun’s concerns were somewhat eased, and he nodded, “It seems it won’t be long before Senior Zipei condenses her core if she can wield such divine ability.”

He paused, and then smiled. “I’m fortunate indeed to have migrated inland and been given the chance to witness such a grand occasion... Missing Shangyuan’s ascension to True Monarch was truly the greatest regret of my life!”

Daoist Master Qiushui’s voice remained as gentle and graceful as ever as he said, “When the True Monarch attained the Dao, the snowy peaks of the Northern Sea stretched for a thousand kilometers and were mostly transformed into the Green Jade Heavenly Mountains. His disciple, Nian Yi, has already established a sect there called the True Unity Dao, with its mountain gate named Green Jade Cliff. If you’re interested, you should go take a look.”

Perhaps because their sects shared similar stances, Daoist Master Qiushui’s tone was much gentler compared to Yuan Xiu’s, prompting Chang Yun to nod slightly. The Daoist gathered his sleeves and reminded the others. “While Pristine Water can be transformed into Converging Water, it can also be reversed. We must guard against saboteurs. The great void must be tightly defended; if this Converging Water disperses and we fail to catch the Great Ning Palace, then all of this will have been for nothing!”

“Of course.” Yuan Xiu replied stiffly, “There are too many eyes watching within the great void. Who would dare commit such a grave offense and risk the wrath of both northern and southern Dao lineages? Not even the great Wang or Xie Families could bear that burden, let alone our sects.”

Li Xuanfeng stood silently to the side, matched by Lingu Rao on the opposite side. They were like two statues, yet neither missed a single word spoken by the Daoist masters. Li Xuanfeng suddenly realized, It seems neither Ning Heyuan joining my expedition nor the immense impact of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was a coincidence. It had all been arranged long ago. Daoist Master Zipei, the most powerful in the south, personally acted to turn Chengshui Tomb into a marsh, then the north stepped in to convert it into Converging Water. Every step was deliberate...
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝘦𝓌𝑒𝑏𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝘭.𝒸𝘰𝑚

Though the north and south are at odds, their coordination is flawless. They contend in the small and cooperate in the great. The world is like a bird caught in a cage. Much like a fish in a net, there is not a sliver of a chance of escape.

His gaze fell, yet he heard Daoist Master Chang Yun’s voice again, “Since the Great Ning Palace has descended, let us each send our envoys...”

Behind him, Zhong Qian slightly raised his brows, gripping his long spear tightly as he gazed toward the distant crystalline glow.

***

Li Qinghong descended from the sky on lightning. Mount Qingdu was already packed with people. Li Ximing led a welcoming party, visibly moved as he cupped his hands and said with a smile, “With Aunt and Elder Brother safely returned, my heart is finally at ease!”

“Your cultivation has improved again,” replied Li Qinghong, smiling at him. Although only Xicheng among the Xiyue generation had been raised personally by her, she was still easier to approach than most, and Ximing and the others were all quite familiar with her.

Li Ximing stepped aside, and Li Xuanxuan, standing behind him with a smile, said, “I knew all along that those devil cultivators wouldn’t stand a chance with Qinghong commanding thunder and lightning.”

The entire Li Family was overjoyed by the two’s safe return, and the heavy atmosphere atop the mountain was instantly swept away. Li Xizhi looked around and asked, “But where is our Minghuang?”

"This..." Li Xuanxuan paused and let out a deep sigh before answering, “It’s truly unfortunate, he entered seclusion just a few days ago to break through. But there’s a difficult matter involved... it’s a long story, and we’ll need to ask Xizhi about it.”

Li Xizhi understood that there was something inconvenient to say, but he didn’t want to neglect Li Quantao. He turned slightly and said gently, “Quantao is seriously injured. Let him recuperate on my mountain for now. There are many family matters to attend to, I must go inspect them first.”

Li Quantao had been absorbed in examining the great formation on the mountain. But when he heard Li Xizhi, the soreness and exhaustion rushed in all at once. He nodded and replied, “I know a bit about formations. This mountain’s setup is quite clever. Go ahead, Brother Xizhi, I’ll take this chance to heal.”

An Siwei escorted him down, and the others rode the wind upward. Li Qinghong relayed all that had happened and shared the good news from Cheng Gao that Li Xuanfeng was unharmed, putting everyone at ease.

Li Ximing led the group onto Lijing Mountain. He activated the formation, circled around to the rear mountain, and unsealed several layers of wards, revealing a residence made of green stone. The residence had two wings to the left and right, with a circular white-stone pond in the center.

Li Qinghong let out a soft sigh and said, “It’s been many years since I last returned to this old house.”

This was the very house built by the Li Family’s founder and his four sons when they had first established their family. Back then, Li Yuanxiu had managed family affairs from here, and Qinghong had lived here briefly. Their memories were still fresh. The house had since been reinforced with formations, and the ground now glimmered faintly with light.

Li Ximing and the others seldom visited this place. As they strode into the back courtyard, Li Qinghong caught sight of a stone cage placed precisely at the courtyard’s center.

The cage had no extra engravings, and only a faint glow indicated it was lined with formation arrays. At its very center, a child crouched, hugging his knees and lying sideways on the ground.

The child’s golden eyes swept over them when he saw them approach. His cheeks were covered in tiny feather-like scales, and he stared at them blankly.

Li Xuanxuan said, “This is Jiang Ao...”

He briefly explained the child’s birth and Kongheng’s suspicions, then sighed gloomily. “He’s only a few months old, but refuses breast milk and cooked food... He only craves raw flesh. He doesn’t understand scolding or words. Whenever he sees a person, he pounces on them to try and devour them like a beast...”

Li Xizhi sighed inwardly, examined the child closely, and flicked out a ray of Heavenly Glow to capture him. The child immediately revealed a look of greed, biting at the glow with rows of white teeth. He didn’t stop trying to chew even as his mouth filled with blood from the recoil.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝚠𝕖𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝕖𝚕.𝚌𝗼𝗺

“This...” After a few more moments of observation, Li Xizhi let out a deep breath and said softly, “This is Minghuang’s child...”

Li Xuanxuan looked up at him, but it was Li Ximing who spoke first, “Brother, I heard that there’s a Veiled Yin Dao lineage in Chen State’s Jizhong, known as the kingdom of women. Perhaps seeking a bride from there might help.”

“It’s not that simple... I’ve been researching everywhere ever since I learned of this.” Li Xizhi spoke softly, “The Wei Emperor sought to gather all Dao lineages under his rule, and the Veiled Yin lineage suffered greatly. Its practitioners were forced into the imperial harem or turned into eunuch cultivators. Thus it has practically vanished since the Wei dynasty. The only place where it still exists is Chen State.

“But that place is a kingdom of women, where yin and yang are reversed, so how could they possibly send one of their own out to marry? They might only allow someone like Zhouwei to marry into their state.”

Li Ximing was taken aback. But after a moment of thought, it was understandable. Li Xizhi gently set down Li Jiang’ao and spoke again, “What I mean is, there’s no need to completely dismiss the matter. Anything involving a fate tied to Metallic Essence often carries strange outcomes. Have a few more children and see how things develop.

“As for Jiang’ao...”

He seemed troubled as well and could only say, “Let’s raise him for now... Perhaps there will one day be a method to cure his disorder. After all, he is our blood, we can’t just end things hastily.”

Everyone nodded and took a seat in the main hall of the old residence. Li Qinghong, never one for ostentation, had already transformed her long feathered robe into a plain white garment.

She spoke softly, “Though we faced a demonic calamity, we gained quite a bit in return.”

She retrieved several storage pouches from her robes and laid them out on the table, along with two dharma artifacts.

One was a dimly glowing small jar, while the other was a gray, misty short blade. There was also a fist-sized pile of black shards, the remnants of Chimen Difu’s dharma artifact that Li Qinghong had conveniently gathered.

The storage pouches from Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators weren’t worth mentioning. The truly valuable ones had belonged to Qiu Ji and the devil cultivator Ge.

But having managed the household for many years, Li Xuanxuan considered even the smallest scrap valuable. He took out the Qi Cultivation Realm pouches, sorted the blood-nourishing items from the mundane, and as a former market steward with a sharp eye, quickly made an estimate.

“These Qi Cultivation Realm goods alone are worth ten years of our family’s profits!”

After all, those devil cultivators had plundered and looted plenty, so they had quite a few treasures in their pouches. Just as Li Xizhi used his mana to lift the black shards on the table for a closer inspection, Li Xuanxuan spoke in his gravelly voice, “This is Black Profound Gold, a material of the Foundation Establishment Realm.”

The old man had lived long and seen much. Li Xizhi nodded and placed the shards back on the table. Li Ximing, who still didn’t possess a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, was examining the two items.

Li Qinghong said softly, “These were obtained by me and Xizhi during a life-and-death battle in the north. Xizhi still doesn’t have a decent magic sword, so I intend to arrange them this way.”

She handed the intricately patterned demonic jar to Li Ximing and said quietly, “This artifact was refined by the devil for many years and contains many good things. But it suits his devil techniques. If I were to use it, not only would it be powerless, it might even be damaged.”

Li Ximing's palm lit up slightly, and black smoke rose from the demonic jar. He shook his head and said, “Aunt, your thunder technique is particularly effective against demons. My Bright Yang isn’t weak either, but even I can’t use this. Why don’t we...”

Li Qinghong interrupted softly, “You and I will be heading north in a few days. Guanzhong is filled with cultivators, especially those from the Azure Pond Sect, but perhaps even other sects will send representatives. Take this item and exchange it for a dharma artifact that suits you.”

Li Ximing had already guessed as much by the time his aunt finished and nodded. Li Qinghong then handed the gray, misty blade to Li Xizhi and instructed, “You have broader connections within the sect. Perhaps you can trade this for a proper dharma sword.”

Li Xizhi nodded. Li Qinghong then took inventory of the remaining contents in the storage pouches and arranged for them all to be added to the family’s reserves.

She then asked, “How is the family’s current collection of spell arts?”

Li Xuanxuan knew these things like the back of his hand and responded immediately, “Twenty-seven low-grade spell arts: fifteen of Grade One, seven of Grade Two, and three of Grade Three. If we include the Profound Water Sword Technique and the Wing Clipper Spear technique, we only have six in total.

“As for Grade Four, only the Slaughter Jun Kui Light remains. We have very few perception and footwork techniques; just the Grand Veined Golden Eyes, Clear Sight Spirit Pupil, and River Crossing Torrential Step.”

Li Qinghong nodded and said, “We cannot practice the devil techniques from northern cultivators, but their spell arts are usable. These pouches contain the Grade Three techniques such as the White Current Control Method and Black Smoke Cloud Sigil. They’re worth studying.”

After all, cultivators from both the north and south rarely carried their cultivation methods on them. It was nearly impossible to acquire spells from fallen enemies. Li Qinghong had only managed to acquire them this time because the devil cultivators had just ravaged Xu State, destroying sects and throwing many spell techniques into their pouches.

Li Xuanxuan received them like treasured artifacts. Li Qinghong’s tone turned serious, “The defeat at Chengshui Tomb was not our fault, and returning will not bring much punishment. However, we cannot delay our return. The sword gate’s flying boat sent us all the way to the lake. The Azure Pond Sect likely noticed I came home. As for Xizhi...”

Li Xizhi shook his head slightly and explained, “My jade pendant is linked with the Azure Pond Sect’s General Affairs Hall. I absolutely must return north.”

Everyone turned to look at him, and Li Xizhi said, “While on the flying boat earlier, I saw a crystalline light falling northward, landing directly on Chengshui Tomb. No matter how important Ning State’s relics are, they can’t compare with something that fell from a royal tomb. If I’m right, the north-south conflict is about to come to an end.”

A calm expression appeared on Li Xizhi’s face. He turned to his younger brother Li Ximing, the corner of his mouth curving into a gentle smile. His voice was warm and composed as he said, “Be patient, Brother Ming. Once our family weathers this storm, I’ll help you acquire the Radiant Sky Stone.”

“I...” Li Ximing had been pondering this matter for a long time and had been distracted throughout the entire conversation. His brother’s words struck him straight in the heart, leaving him unsure of what to say.

The words caught in his throat for a long while before he finally said, “Just take care of yourself, Brother... My cultivation still has a long way to go...”




# Chapter 830: In The Demonic Smoke

Li Xuanxuan glanced at Li Ximing, and then at Li Xizhi. He took in the expressions of both brothers, and drew out two jade boxes from his sleeve.

He said, "These are the broken Copper Cache Sword and the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens."

The Copper Cache was Yu Mujian’s dharma artifact. Its quality was decent, but unfortunately, the refinement techniques of Buddhist cultivators couldn’t compare to those of the immortal or demonic Daos. The material was fine, but the ritual refinement was rather crude.

The sword had been severed by the Qingche Sword, but Li Xuanxuan brought it out and placed it in his palm. The yellow-gold cross-section was smooth, but whether The Merciful One had left behind any contingencies was unclear.

But the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens were altogether different. Though far inferior to the Sixfold Quaking Profound Thunder Tokens, their craftsmanship was still top-tier. They were clearly not ordinary items.

Li Qinghong opened the jade box to find six shimmering palm-sized silver-white command tokens. Their engraved scripts lit up, emitting a soft crackling thunder.

Li Qinghong picked one up and weighed it in her hand. A stream of silver lightning surged into her palm, prompting her to exclaim in admiration, "What a marvelous treasure!"

She examined it attentively, gently stroking the engraved script. The remaining five tokens immediately lifted into the air, swirling around her wrist like streaks of light.

Li Qinghong closed her eyes and softly said, "Such a pity... it's 'Profound Thunder.'"

Li Qinghong’s Dao foundation was the Profound Thunderpool, derived from the ‘Winter Thunderclap.’ Though it bore the name Profound Thunder, it belonged to the category of Celestial Thunder and wasn’t a perfect match.

Still, it was a thunder-type dharma artifact. The mismatch merely resulted in minor inefficiencies when channeling mana. After playing with it for a while, Li Qinghong flipped her hand and stowed it away, saying quietly, "This is a top-tier dharma artifact, yet I’ve never used this type of celestial token artifact before. I’ll need to study it thoroughly."

After storing the token, she unfastened the Profound Patterned Bottle at her waist. The dharma artifact glowed with a rich violet hue and was covered in thunder patterns.

The bottle radiated brilliance on the table as Li Qinghong softly said, "This dharma artifact originally belonged to Brother Jiao. It came from within the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven. Its effects vary depending on the wielder’s immortal foundation.

"In Brother Jiao’s hands, it had some unique effects. But in mine, it merely functions as a container, absorbing and storing spirit thunder."

She lifted the bottle and tilted it with one hand, pouring out small bursts of radiant lightning. Each stream of thunder was guided into her palm; some wild, some agile, but each with its own unique character.

Li Qinghong took several small golden bottles from her storage pouch and stored them one by one, seven in total, before handing the treasured bottle to Li Xizhi. "It was always meant to be yours."

"Aunt, how can you say that?!" Li Xizhi examined it briefly. The Profound Patterned Bottle was only three fingers wide in his palm, with delicate carvings and a shimmer of violet light. He lifted his hand and placed it into Li Ximing’s grasp, saying, "Since it came from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven, it should be in your hands..."

Li Xizhi quickly closed Li Ximing’s fingers around the item in his moment of distraction. He turned anxiously to Li Qinghong, uneasily saying, "Aunt, Xiang’er is still in the North!"

Li Xuanxuan had been sitting at the edge of his seat for some time, wanting to speak. When he saw his grandson finally bring it up, the old man rose and said in a low voice, "Qinghong... about this matter..."

The only one in the Li Family now capable of crossing the river and returning unscathed was Li Qinghong. She nodded gently and replied warmly, "I understand. I’ll return to the North at once."

"Thank you, Aunt!" Li Xizhi responded with deep gratitude. Li Ximing stood beside him, understanding full well, and opened his mouth to speak—only to feel warmth in his palm.

Li Xizhi still had his hand over Li Ximing’s, pressing the Profound Patterned Bottle firmly into his palm. All words of protest stuck in Li Ximing’s throat, and finally he only uttered, "Be careful, Aunt..."

Li Qinghong nodded and replied, "Time is of the essence. Ximing will come with me to the North. Xizhi, recover with Li Quantao and follow us in a few days."

"I’ll head back to Qingdu to prepare!" Li Ximing stood up, and the aunt and nephew soared away on the wind together. Li Xizhi escorted them to the courtyard gate, and then wandered restlessly around the ancestral house before returning to his seat.

Li Xuanxuan was sorting various spirit items, his aged face drooping but otherwise unreadable. He lifted his gaze and, seeing the somber look on Li Xizhi’s face, said hoarsely, "Ximing spent years in seclusion and saw Yuexiang only a few times, how deep could his affection be? Don’t take it to heart. He is a bit cold... but not heartless to such an extent..."

"Grandfather..." Li Xizhi sighed softly, his lips trembling. Only now did the pain show on his face. He replied, "I don’t want Aunt to take risks either... I understand Ximing’s mind, and I know Yuexiang’s chances are slim. But what if there’s still a sliver of hope?"
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝒆𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝙤𝒗𝓮𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

His remaining words turned to ash in his mouth. He hadn’t known Li Yuexiang had gone north; only later did he learn it had been arranged by the family.

He wasn’t the only one who lacked feeling.

***

Mount Yan Pass.

Demonic smoke rolled thick across the ground, with scattered motes of dim light rising through the gloom. Fragments of collapsed white stone lay all around the darkened ruins. The bloodstains had long since dried, leaving only a few shards of bone strewn across the wreckage.

The ruins were utterly deserted. But a flicker of black light slithered out from a crack in the rocks, transforming into a black serpent that glided silently through the desolation.

Li Wushao's black serpent eyes stayed on the demonic smoke as he slithered forward. It had been months since he had fled from Chengshui Tomb, and this was his first time reappearing at Mount Yan Pass.

The war between North and South had plunged the skies into chaos. Li Wushao had seen Chengshui Tomb flood with Pristine Water and immortal radiance collapse. Thus he had reverted to his true form without hesitation, shrank down, and dove into the underground waters, fleeing southward without a glance back.

As a native Hooked Serpent of the Eastern Sea, Li Wushao was no stranger to survival. Having lived so long in such perilous waters, escape was second nature to him. Once he was within his element, the water, he easily shook off pursuers and fled ever southward.

But Li Wushao hadn't expected Mount Yan Pass to fall. Demonic smoke cloaked the land all along his path, and he'd been attacked three times in his blind flight. He had almost lost his life in those battles.

The only reason I blend in with this demonic smoke is because I was born in the Eastern Sea, am covered head to tail in demonic qi, and never trained in any orthodox sect’s true path or technique. If I were like those other sect mount beasts glowing with righteous light, I’d have been slain long ago!

Just as Li Wushao was slithering over the ruins, a sudden streak of black light fell from the sky and landed before him, transforming into a black-robed man who stared at him in suspicion.

Caught red-handed, Li Wushao did not panic. He lifted his snake head and looked straight at the man, only to hear him speak in a cold tone, "Fellow Daoist, which unit are you from... and why are you loitering here?"

Since Li Wushao was covered in demonic qi and prowling the ruins, the man couldn’t determine his allegiance. Who would guess a defeated straggler from Chengshui Tomb was still wandering the demon-blighted land?

The thick demonic aura on the man clearly gave him away as a northern devil cultivator or rogue, so Li Wushao flicked his tongue and answered, "I am a protector under Master Monk Kongheng of Yan State! And what about you, what unit are you from to be prying this much?"

The snake demon spoke with conviction, but inwardly grumbled, Damn it... using that monk's name again. I’ve practically been his mount these past months! What a disgrace...

The man hesitated. Though most Buddhist cultivator forces were now centered around the Way of Emptiness, Way of Compassion, and Way of Virtue, representatives of all seven northern sects had shown up. Who could say where this Kongheng fit in?

Still, seeing the snake demon so confident, he replied coldly, "I’ve never heard of any Master Monk Kongheng!"

"Blind, are you?!" Li Wushao cursed aloud, slapped the ground with his tail. He pointed directly at him, and roared, "My master is someone even Master Monk Yu Xin of the Great Desire Sect begged in vain for a single debate! And you, a petty devil cultivator, dare bark at someone of such stature?"

Yu Xin had indeed led the initial assault on Mount Yan Pass as a master of the Dao of Great Desire, only to be repelled by Li Qinghong and others. The tale held truth, and with the black serpent holding his head high, his bearing was indeed quite intimidating.

This snake's mouth is vile, thought the devil cultivator.

The devil cultivator was already half-convinced once he heard the name Yu Xin. But being cursed so thoroughly still left him displeased. A trace of doubt lingered in his heart as he said coldly, "If you truly serve such a great master, you must be well-versed in scripture!"

"Hah! You asked for this!" Li Wushao sneered in response and began rapidly reciting the Respected Cultivator's Subduing Words that Kongheng had once taught him. The cryptic and profound incantations echoed through the air. Combined with his earlier claims, it immediately made the devil cultivator in front of him flinch and panic.

“Plagued fool of a snake!” Buddhist cultivators’ scriptures were notoriously strange and unpredictable. The devil cultivator didn’t want to risk getting converted mid-interrogation, so he hurled an insult to save face and quickly took to the wind, vanishing into the black mist.

“Pah!” Li Wushao spat in the direction of his retreating figure and slithered back into the ruins. The man was likely one of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators stationed here. After that little farce, it seemed he wouldn't be facing any more interference.

Most of the devil cultivators stationed here withdrew after the incident at Chengshui Tomb, and that master monk also returned to the north... otherwise that guy wouldn’t have been so easy to fool...

Li Wushao had also seen the shimmering lights descending from the north. He wasn’t surprised, but muttered inwardly, Humans are so obsessed with appearances. If you want to kill, then just kill, why the need for so many pretenses and disputes? They fight and struggle until they die, all for some hollow display.

Li Wushao had seen plenty of this in the Eastern Sea. Whenever some dragon son from the water palaces needed an Immortal Foundation for alchemy or forging, the local demonic creatures simply lined up to be slaughtered. There was no need for wars or disputes, none of this endless back and forth.

That said, Li Wushao still envied the refinement of inland cultivators. Even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had to feign civility when killing those at Foundation Establishment Realm, and senseless slaughter was rarer. Life was far more comfortable that way.

He lowered his head and moved through the ruins. Before long, he reached the place where he had once been stationed. After digging around for a bit, he unearthed a halberd.

The halberd had a simple design and was remarkably light. Inscribed upon it were the words, Li Family of Qingdu, Chen Family of Lijing, Chen Mufeng.

So the kid died here after all.

Li Wushao had met this man before, back when he was captured and brought to the Li Family. Chen Mufeng had still been a boy then, and they'd crossed paths.

“Damn it...” The snake demon scowled and pried up a few large stones. Sure enough, he found half of Chen Mufeng’s skull. He dug up the other half from the soil. It was already rotted, so the snake demon wiped them clean, pieced them together, and stashed them in his storage pouch.

Humans have a tradition of burying the dead. I’ll bring it back for Chen Donghe to give him a proper burial, thought Li Wushao.

He blinked a few times, searched the area twice, and dragged out a few corpses of Li Family members. Thankfully, he didn’t recognize any of them.

He stowed them all away and cursed, “Damn it, dying right on the spot!”

Now in human form, his eyelid twitched as he scanned the area again. He silently let out a breath of relief when there was no sign of An Zheyan’s corpse. That guy had once worked alongside him mining beneath Moongaze Lake. He had always been smiling under his bald head, with a hearty appetite and a tendency to slack off—though he could run surprisingly fast.

He looked around once more. There had also been a burly man wielding a golden hammer, probably named Li Wen, who was also missing. It was quite likely he had been reduced to ash, with his hammer taken by someone.

As he made his way back, he found a few more corpses along the way and quietly gathered them up, thinking to himself, Those guys from Moon Lake Peak of the devil gate... they probably ran the moment things turned bad, maybe not even fast enough to escape.

He walked barefoot through the field, spotting familiar faces now and then, or what remained of them. Sometimes it was a nose he recognized, or half a rotted ear that looked vaguely familiar, lying discarded on the ground.

Each time Li Wushao saw one, he swore under his breath. His muttering continued as he wandered through the gate, the curses growing quieter, until at last, the old snake fell silent.

In all his years in the Eastern Sea, Li Wushao had never truly had friends. His kin considered his bloodline too lowly to speak to, and the other demon clans didn’t even dare look him in the eye.

It was only after arriving at the Li Family that Li Wushao came to understand the concept of acquaintances and friends. Despite his foul mouth and gruff demeanor, people like An Zheyan and Chen Donghe didn’t mind him. Perhaps there had been some mutual benefit, but they treated him with camaraderie nonetheless.

Li Yuexiang had been just a little girl; she was sweet and well-behaved. Xiao Guiluan’s children were all sharp and clever. Back then, Li Wushao had been assigned to guard her by Li Yuanjiao.

Li Yuexiang had always liked white dresses since she was young. She once told Li Wushao, "I usually stay on the mountain. Uncle Wushao, you don’t have to wait on me all the time. If you come from the lake, I won’t be waiting too long."

In the blink of an eye, more than twenty years had passed. When Li Yuanjiao had died, Li Xuanfeng had asked whether he wanted to stay with the Li Family. Li Wushao hadn’t dared make a peep in front of that man then. But if he were honest with himself, he had grown used to this kind of life, one where he didn’t have to be constantly afraid and could speak his mind.

Now his acquaintances had become corpses, scattered in pieces across the ground. Even in the cold weather, they were rotting badly. For the first time, Li Wushao furrowed his brow over a few mere Qi Cultivation Realm humans.

The old snake wandered all the way to the collapsed formation’s center. His spiritual sense swept the ruins, and after rummaging for a bit, he suddenly caught sight of a broken sword.

The broken sword was just over a foot long. A wooden charm dangled from its hilt, one palm long and two fingers wide, stained in dried black blood. Delicate and graceful words were written on it, I’ve long awaited your return.

Devil winds howled as the old snake glanced at the charm, then at the charred marks on the stone and the dark bloodstains. He stared for two seconds, then turned back to the charm, and let out a raspy hiss—the choked, guttural sound unique to grieving serpents.




# Chapter 832: Great Ning Palace

Li Wushao had his spirituality seized at an early age and was subsequently handed over to the Li Family. Later, when Li Yuanjiao died before he could transfer it, a wisp of the connection had been released.

Later, Li Xijun had used the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique again, and the spirituality was first with Li Xijun, then quickly transferred to Li Yuexiang. There was a connection between him and the spirituality; once the master died, the life-bound demonic creature would instantly perish. When he was with Li Yuanjiao, he often used this link to find his way to Li Yuanjiao upon being summoned.

The Xu State was in turmoil, so the connection couldn't be established, but if the spirituality had been extinguished, Li Wushao would have died instantly. Yet he had remained unharmed all along, and saw no sign of the spirituality being released and returning, so he felt secure and never truly considered that Li Yuexiang might be in trouble.

“She must have transferred the spirituality in advance... that’s why I didn’t notice.”

At that moment, a wooden talisman floated by. Caught off guard, Li Wushao froze. The words I’ve long awaited your return caught his eye, making him bare his fangs and let out a furious roar.

The demonic serpent swept his sleeve firmly, lifting a slab of broken stone to reveal scorched ashes that contained several delicate bone fragments. He reached out to brush away the ashes, staining his hand gray and black.

Though the weather was cold, his palm felt scorching hot. After turning the ashes over a few times, he used mana to shake out a few fragments. The fragments had a porcelain-like texture with a faint red hue. Li Wushao exhaled, circulating his mana, and quickly pieced the fragments back into their original form.

It was a red ceramic bead, covered in cracks. He recognized it as a personal belonging of Li Yuexiang, called Glazed Dusk. It had been seized by Li Yuanjiao during an attack on the Li Family by devil cultivators like Qiu Ji. Named by Li Qinghong, it had passed through many hands before ending up with Li Yuexiang. It served as a decent defensive dharma artifact in the Qi Cultivation Realm.

He gathered the fragments using mana. As someone from the Water Mansion lineage of Immortal Foundation, Li Wushao’s power conflicted with the Fire Virtue nature of Glazed Dusk, causing it to appear somewhat dim.

The old serpent tucked the cracked Glazed Dusk into his robes, then took out a jade box to store the charred remains and bones. He hastily stowed the box into his storage pouch. He stood there, staring at his hand for two breaths.

“Stupid thing...” murmured Li Wushao.

Li Wushao’s eyes were gloomy as he stared at the blackened mark on his palm. He began peeling the ashes off bit by bit with mana, then carefully placed it back into the jade box.

***

Chengshui Tomb.

The deep blue Converging Water gently rippled, reflecting the demonic clouds above. Several figures stood upon the clouds. Some of them were clad in golden robes, while others were in flowing black robes. Regardless, they all had an immortal bearing.

Three Daoist Masters conversed quietly in the front while Li Xuanfeng stood with his bow. The misty blue cloud surrounding Si Boxiu wafted upward along his robes, and Li Xuanfeng felt waves of refreshing energy flow over him, gradually restoring his depleted mana.

Li Xuanfeng had been waiting at Chengshui Tomb for several days while the Daoist Masters meditated with their eyes closed. A few days passed in the blink of an eye to someone at the Foundation Establishment Realm, let alone for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. A single blink might encompass entire cycles of day and night.

When the Daoist Masters began to speak, Li Xuanfeng knew the moment had come. Si Boxiu’s cloud had already fully replenished his mana. A buzzing sound filled the air as a golden cloud flew out from the great void.

A Daoist Master stood on the golden cloud, hands clasped behind his back. His eyes were slightly narrowed, and he had a somewhat somber aura. Several young cultivators stood beside him, radiating glimmers of spiritual light.

“Fellow Daoist Tianyuan.” Daoist Master Chang Yun called out, and Zhang Tianyuan landed before them, nodding toward Daoist Master Qiushui. He was none other than Daoist Master Tianyuan of the Golden Feather Sect.

Si Boxiu spoke softly, “Sorry to trouble you, fellow Daoist.”

Three people descended from his cloud and stood beside Li Xuanfeng. There was one middle-aged man and two youths, all wearing the Azure Pond Sect’s robes. None appeared arrogant, and they nodded slightly toward Li Xuanfeng in greeting.

The Golden Feather Sect’s territory now stretches from Yue State into central Wu State. Their current strength far surpasses the Azure Pond Sect’s... Li Xuanfeng thought to himself.

The Golden Feather Sect was at its peak. Qiushui and Tianyuan often traveled, laying out strategies everywhere. There were two other Daoist Masters within the sect, one with the Dao title Tianhuo, under two hundred years old and often in seclusion, and the other, Tianque, known for his violent temper, stationed in Wu State.

The sect had many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Notably, Zhang Yun, who was famous even during his Foundation Establishment Realm. He was now in seclusion for a breakthrough, reflecting a thriving, prosperous scene.

In contrast, the Azure Pond Sect had suffered nearly a century of turmoil under Chi Wei. The consequences were now clear; there was a dearth of strength. Chi Wei had fallen, Chi Buzi had disappeared, and both Yuanwu and Yuan Su had perished. In just a few decades, they had lost four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators! Once superior to Golden Feather Sect, they had now fallen to the level of a mere average sect.

As Li Xuanfeng’s thoughts ran their course, he saw Daoist Master Chang Yun raise an eyebrow and say, “So it’s the Gao Family of Qi State who arrives first.”

As his voice faded, the great void before them split open, revealing a man whose attire was quite ornate. His upper garment was crisp and snow-white, while his lower robes were a vivid red. He also had a black cloak draped over his broad shoulders. He had a prominent nose and dark red eyes.

Behind him stood another man in dark red and black robes, holding a cavalry lance. He was clearly Gao Fangjing from earlier. The man in front must be Gao Fu, the Bo Lie King who had forged his divine powers with True Flame.

“Greetings to Bo Lie King!”
𝗳𝚛𝚎𝚎𝘄𝕖𝕓𝕟𝕠𝚟𝚎𝕝.𝗰𝕠𝐦

Yuan Xiu and the others treated him with due courtesy, greeting him one by one. Bo Lie King Gao Fu nodded solemnly in return, performing a meticulously formal northern salute as he said in a deep voice, “I am Gao Fu. Greetings to the esteemed Daoist Masters.”

He had a handsome beard and thick brows, with a broad and powerful chest. His garments were dignified, and surging True Flame was suppressed within his eyes. He did not resemble a northern barbarian king, but rather a noble from the ancient Zhou Dynasty famed for their mastery of Fire Virtue.

Daoist Masters Qiushui and Chang Yun nodded slightly. Bo Lie King stroked his beard and took a close look at Li Xuanfeng, tilting his head slightly as Gao Fangjing mouthed something softly behind him.

Just as Bo Lie King Gao Fu arrived, several figures emerged from the great void. Most of them were shaped like vivid golden statues; some with three heads and six arms, while others had five eyes and seven legs, covered densely with eyes. They radiated warm golden light, but had a solemn and majestic presence.

Li Xuanfeng and Lingu Rao were not ignorant novices. They lowered their heads at once, avoiding the overwhelming golden light.

The buzzing sound of scripture chanting was blocked by Si Boxiu’s cloud, and then came a chuckle, “Has everyone arrived?”

“White Horse Temple has withdrawn... the rest are all here.”

After a short exchange between the voices, Bo Lie King Gao Fu, cultivator of True Flame, stepped forward, stroking his beard, and said, “I’ve long heard that Daoist Master Qiushui cultivates the Whole Pill Dao of Lead and Mercury. The transformations of elemental essence in this Dao are beyond us, might we ask for a demonstration?”

“Very well.” Daoist Master Qiushui nodded gently. She raised a hand, palm up, and released two faint golden gleams. One ascended and transformed into brilliant golden light, while the other descended into vermilion red. She spoke softly, “Azure and emerald blend as one, forming pure and bright Converging Water, capable of revealing the shattered remnants.”

She extended one finger forward and gently rested another finger upon it. The remaining three fingers were slightly curved as she pointed toward the dark blue Converging Water below, respectfully saying, “Behold the radiance of the embraced Supreme Unity.”

Chengshui Tomb had already been submerged by Converging Water. The terrain below them was especially low, with nothing left above the waterline. It looked like a small lake, the dark blue water opaque and jewel-like.

But once the Daoist Master gestured, the black clouds reflected on the water’s surface began to shift. Li Xuanfeng looked closely and saw a broken cliff reflected in the water, with scattered pavilions and towers, and billowing white clouds drifting to and fro.

The reflection grew increasingly vivid. The Converging Water beneath their feet had turned into a mirror, revealing a limited yet clear realm.

Daoist Master Qiushui withdrew her hand and said softly, “Let each of you send someone into the water.”

“What a divine ability...”

Daoist Master Qiushui had performed this with effortless grace, without the slightest strain. Even after letting her hand fall, the reflection remained perfectly stable on the water’s surface.

The Merciful Ones remained silent, while only Bo Lie King Gao Fu praised, “A most ingenious divine ability.”

Si Boxiu watched silently, tilting his head slightly before taking a golden talisman from his robe. It was only two fingers wide and etched densely with radiant markings. He handed it to Li Xuanfeng and said solemnly, “This is the Summon Golden Talisman. It can summon golden energy to aid in battle, but lasts no more than an hour. Its effects may be weaker in this realm, so use it wisely.”

He turned around and pointed out the three behind him, “This is Si Yuanli. These two are Chi Tianxing and Chi Fuju.”

Si Yuanli was the middle-aged man, who was already at the late-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. The other two were youths. Chi Tianxing had a calm demeanor and nodded politely, while Chi Fuju was equally well-mannered and pleasant in appearance.

Yuan Xiu said gravely. “Once he enters the water, I entrust his safety to you two.”

Lingu Rao and Li Xuanfeng immediately responded in unison, “We obey the Daoist Master’s order!”

The group descended from the clouds into the water with a wave of Yuan Xiu’s sleeve. Li Xuanfeng felt a moment of darkness followed by sudden brightness, and then nothing beneath him.

He channeled mana to ride the wind. Mist swirled ceaselessly below his feet. There was no sun or moon above, only an endless white haze. The black clouds, Converging Water, the Merciful Ones, and the Daoist Masters were all gone, leaving only vast skies and a chilling wind rushing toward him.

Looking into the distance, he saw a cliff rising steeply into the sky, adorned with staggered pavilions and towers. Ning State favored deep blues and glazed jewels, so it was no surprise to see these buildings constructed with black and dark blue hues. Colored glass twinkled in the distance, presenting a scene of rich splendor.

Li Xuanfeng paused briefly and looked around, but only found Si Yuanli beside him.

The middle-aged man was riding the wind, surveying the area. His green robe fluttered, and a jade-green longsword had already appeared in his hand. Seeing Li Xuanfeng looking over, he cupped his fists and said, “Apologies for the trouble, fellow Daoist!”

Yuan Xiu clearly has his own agenda!

Li Xuanfeng didn’t need to think long. Lingu Rao was certainly with the two Chi Family members and had separated the moment they entered the realm, leaving him with Si Yuanli. Li Xuanfeng found it hard to believe that this wasn’t orchestrated by Si Boxiu.

He returned the gesture and the two descended into the clouds. After observing for a while, Li Xuanfeng felt that this strange place resembled neither a grotto heaven nor a sealed world.

He asked softly, “Do you know where this is, fellow Daoist?”

“This is the Great Ning Palace.” Since Si Yuanli would need to rely on him later, he spoke with a gentle demeanor and answered thoroughly, “It’s not comparable to the grotto heavens of True Monarchs, though the naming conventions are quite complex. Some called palaces, others halls, caves, or chambers. The Immortal Mansions once had a formal system to classify such cave dwellings.”

He paused for a moment, noting they still had some distance to descend, then continued in a quiet voice, “To be precise, it was the dwelling of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. In ancient times, spiritual energy was abundant and the world was more complete. My family's Daoist Master says it was a time of ‘complete surplus in all things,’ with treasures everywhere. True Monarchs and Daoist Masters of those eras far surpassed those of today, and there were many who had mastered their divine ability. Power resided with multiple Daoist Masters, not just one per faction.

“When they combined their divine abilities, these figures could create dwellings on dharma artifacts or spirit items that were either large or small. Though not as refined as grotto heavens hidden in the great void, they had their own wonders.

“The Great Ning Palace is one such example.”

Li Xuanfeng thoughtfully looked down at the mountains beneath his feet, and asked, “It’s really that vast? That doesn’t seem right...”

The realm before him stretched beyond sight, making Li Xuanfeng suspicious. If every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had such abilities, Azure Pond Sect and Golden Feather Sect would have countless such domains, yet he had never heard of them. Yuan Su hadn’t even mentioned it. Something felt off, and he stared intently ahead.

Very perceptive... Si Yuanli secretly sighed in his heart.

But he maintained a smile as he replied, “You’re right... After the changes in heaven and earth, constructing a dwelling with divine arts has become immensely difficult for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. In ancient times, three or five of them could build a small immortal palace. Nowadays, it might take more than a dozen. Aside from the likes of the Wang, Xie, and Luoxia families, who across the lands still has that kind of power?

“What’s more, today’s immortal palaces are said to be cramped and unimpressive. Few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are willing to pay the cost.

“As for the Great Ning Palace before us...” Si Yuanli continued softly, “It was constructed in ancient times with the aid of Anhuai Heaven, anchored to a grotto heaven rather than stored within a dharma artifact or spirit item. Then, a True Monarch intervened, which made it possible for such a vast territory to be formed.

“However, now that it’s been opened and connected to the present world, it will begin to collapse within a few months and vanish completely...”

The two finally reached the ground and landed upon pale blue lake water. The blue-black stones beneath were clearly visible. Shallow waters stretched away on both sides, presenting a picturesque scene.

“The Daoist Masters have plotted so carefully because they hope to trace the remains of Anhuai Heaven... While there are many grotto heavens in northern Jiangnan, such as the once-famous Donghua Heaven of the Yuan Prefecture, Anhuai Heaven was among the wealthiest.”

Si Yuanli’s personality, unlike his Daoist Master’s, was gentle and chatty. He smiled and said, “My elder brother is Si Yuanbai. He was once a sword immortal’s disciple and had close ties with your esteemed family...”

“I see!” Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly in acknowledgment. As they flew, they passed a green stone sculpture of a flying fish spouting water every half a kilometer. After dozens of kilometers, they finally saw a long, orderly jade road stretching over the lake. It was black on the outside and white within. The seamless road extended far into the distance.

“What a splendid view.”

Li Xuanfeng’s own home lay by Moongaze Lake, and his family soon to become the sole ruling clan in that region. So when he saw this immortal palace of Ning State, he nodded silently in approval.

Si Yuanli, however, could hardly wait. He picked up speed along the road, his blue robe fluttering as he said with a laugh, “Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng! Ning State is famed for its mastery of True Qi, and the Jiajiang Li Family even supported the nation. There must be many treasures here, we must hurry on!”




# Chapter 834: Painted Panels

Li Xuanfeng frowned slightly at his demeanor. Watching Si Yuanli fly ahead at great speed without the slightest caution, he thought to himself, Does this man have some hidden backing and thus such confidence? Or has he simply lived too long under the protection of a Daoist Master and grown naive and careless?

The Si Family was low-key and reserved within the sect, and Li Xuanfeng had rarely encountered them. He had never interacted with Si Yuanli before, nor even heard his name. Most likely, he was a rash type who might end up dragging others down with him.

Li Xuanfeng followed closely, golden bow in hand, his tiger-like eyes scanning the surroundings. He activated his perception technique and swept his gaze across the lake's scenery. After just a dozen breaths of flight, they saw the vague silhouette of a blue palace floating on the water, with a faint golden light hovering above it.

“A Buddhist cultivator!” The golden glow of a Buddhist cultivator was easy to recognize. Si Yuanli identified it at a glance, his face twisting in disdain. He looked toward Li Xuanfeng and muttered, “Brother Xuanfeng, don’t let him take the lead!”

Li Xuanfeng naturally wasn’t afraid of offending a Buddhist cultivator. The golden string of his bow hummed as a golden arrow leapt from his waist. He gathered Astral Qi with the swift precision of long practice. The bowstring thrummed, and when he relaxed his fingers, a burst of petal-like energy scattered the golden light in the distance.

“Damn you... what foul demon dares use sorcery against this old monk?!” A stern voice rang out from the golden light as a figure leapt upward. Li Xuanfeng and Si Yuanli arrived in a flash. Li Xuanfeng’s gaze locked coldly onto the old monk within the light, raising his golden bow and aiming it at him.

“This old monk... I...”

The monk’s eyes were dark and filled with blazing fury, but the moment they met Li Xuanfeng’s icy gaze, his tone immediately softened. His fierce expression turned to fear as he exclaimed, “Li Xuanfeng!

“I... this humble monk... has no wish to feud with fellow Daoist. This destiny belongs to you!”

He vanished into his golden light, fleeing in a puff of smoke and leaving behind a trail of flower-like energy. Clearly, he was too injured to even conceal his wounds.

The glow on Li Xuanfeng’s bow slowly faded. Since he did not know how many more fights awaited here, he chose not to waste more mana on the wretch.

Si Yuanli glanced sideways at him, pausing for a full breath before saying, “Daoist... Brother Xuanfeng... after you...”

The two descended together, landing before the palace. Si Yuanli waved his sleeve and pushed the doors open. The grand hall had a large table that was flanked by several jade chairs. The setting was lavish yet elegant, with an antique incense burner placed in the middle. The whole picture was immaculate and exuded ancient charm.

“Profound...”

Si Yuanli had just begun to speak when he saw Li Xuanfeng calmly say, “Make haste, fellow Daoist, gather what you need and head for the center at once.”

“Alright,” replied Si Yuanli.

Si Yuanli paused briefly, then briskly walked along the corridor above the water. Li Xuanfeng watched as his spiritual sense quickly swept through the entire hall. Dharma artifacts floated into the air one by one, streaming colorful light as they flew straight into his storage pouch. Each item was collected without pause, and stuffed into the pouch with single-minded focus.

Li Xuanfeng immediately gained some insight into this man's temperament. He raised his hand and looked toward the central screen of the hall. It had a painting of an armored man, gripping a strange beast in each hand, turning his head to look outward with bold heroism.

The screen itself was quite ordinary, and there was nothing unusual about it except for the impressive figure depicted. Off to the side was a line of small characters, written in elegant calligraphy, Emperor Liang Founds His Nation — A gift to Brother Jiang.

At the end was a signature, Chen Xuanli.

Li Xuanfeng looked at it with mild interest and casually picked it up. Just then, Si Yuanli finished collecting the hall’s treasures and hurried over, glancing at the object in his hands and asked, “Fellow Daoist, that is...?”

“It looked interesting, so I took it,” replied Li Xuanfeng.

Then, he tucked it away with a flip of his hand. The two immediately lifted off, riding the wind at full speed toward the center. The lake scenery below rushed past them, and after about ten seconds, another palace came into view.

This palace was even smaller than the last, yet Si Yuanli descended eagerly. Li Xuanfeng could only follow. A quick scan of the interior with his spiritual sense confirmed that it was indeed completely empty.

Si Yuanli looked visibly disappointed. Li Xuanfeng turned to him and said quietly, “No need to dwell on it, fellow Daoist. Most of these palaces have likely already been visited. We shouldn’t delay, let’s head straight for the central cliff. If we wait any longer, there may be nothing left for us.”

Si Yuanli rose into the air with him, showing a trace of hesitation as if troubled by something. After a few seconds, he nodded and sighed. “You’re right, fellow Daoist! Let’s move quickly!”

Though Li Xuanfeng kept his eyes fixed ahead, he noted Si Yuanli’s expression and grew thoughtful. The two streaked through the air, their flight light trailing behind them like long flames as they raced toward the cliff.

About fifteen minutes later, the cliff appeared before them. Li Xuanfeng could vaguely see figures already descending and silently nodded to himself, thinking, The Great Ning Palace may be vast, but it’s still nothing like a true grotto heaven. These cultivators aren’t ordinary folk. Wherever they go, it's like locusts sweeping the land. Not even fifteen minutes has passed since we entered, and already only the mountain-top palaces remain to be plundered.

There would definitely be a fight atop the mountain; that would be the real climax of this grotto heaven. Gone were the days of leisurely exploration, when days might pass without running into another soul.

From what he’d seen along the way, he now understood that perhaps due to changes in the world, interference from a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, or some other issue, none of the Great Ning Palace’s formations had activated. They were all just decorations, leaving cultivators free to come and go as if strolling through their own backyard.

This cliff was the heart of the Great Ning Palace; it was the most critical area. Yet as he looked up, he saw only a sparse few flickers of light across the mountainside, no more than could be counted on one hand. Dim and faint, they looked like they could be resolved with just a few arrows.

This is far too easy... It’s nothing like Green Pine Temple’s Mirage Mirror Heaven... All the main heirs of the noble families have their methods. Everything has been laid out in advance by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. The true contest lies in the battles between them...

He drew his bow and descended with Si Yuanli, sweeping his spiritual sense across the air. The mountain was covered in verdant blue palaces. They chose one nearby to land upon. Si Yuanli followed in haste, finally showing a hint of caution.

Li Xuanfeng stepped into the hall, his expression instantly chilling as a dense wave of spiritual energy rushed toward him. The formation core at the center of the hall was steadily releasing spiritual qi. It was so thick it had condensed into Minor Pure Spiritual Qi, spilling outward in a rush of pure white mist.

Around the formation core stood four large cauldrons, each venting white mist. Treasures filled the space and jade thrones gleamed with grandeur. A massive yet exquisitely carved immortal throne rested above, flanked by six green square cauldrons filled with various spirit items.

Two of the cauldrons near the steps had already been overturned, lying scattered on their sides. Their contents clattered and rolled across the floor, radiant treasures casting dazzling multicolored light. It was almost too bright to look at.

Several cultivators stood in confrontation within the hall, but Li Xuanfeng’s gaze swept past them entirely, landing instead on the screen behind the immortal throne.

The screen had a faint green glow. Made of a dim, deep green material, its borders were lined with intricate runic designs. There were eight panels in total, and they blocked spiritual sense, preventing any glimpse of what lay behind.
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝚠𝚎𝚋𝗻𝗼𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝚘𝐦

The screen seemed to have a strange allure that instantly captured his attention. The eight interlinked panels formed a great hall of their own that was visually disorienting. Li Xuanfeng hadn’t even had time to examine it closely when he was rooted in place by the overwhelming sense of familiarity it evoked.

“This is...”

The intense sense of déjà vu stirred unease within him. He was sure he’d never seen it before, yet the ancient style felt intimately familiar. His gaze followed the panels to the final one; it depicted the outside of the hall, where a man stood with his ear tilted as if listening.

At that moment, Li Xuanfeng’s mind roared with realization, and he finally remembered why it felt so familiar. He had seen that very view before; the painting of black-green winds, the swaying pine forest amidst the Heavy Abyssal Gale...

Chongming Hall! These panels depict the Six Sons of Chongming!

He quickly withdrew his gaze, feigning nonchalance as he scanned the hall again. The cultivators inside had all turned to look at him. Some were cloaked in eerie demonic energy, while others were wreathed in True Flame or bathed in Buddhist radiance. All of their eyes now locked firmly on him.

Li Xuanfeng’s gray eyes narrowed slightly as he met their gazes without hesitation, showing no concern for the warning in their stares. He was regally composed as he stepped forward into the hall with one hand gripping his bow, and the other held behind his back.

Si Yuanli followed close behind, visibly tense. His longsword shimmered with brilliance; it was practically pressed against his armor as he stared fixedly at the four central cauldrons.

“So it’s Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng...” The tension in the hall lingered until someone finally spoke. Gao Fangjing of the True Flame lineage was clad in his dark red robe and wielding a horse lance.

Many of the devil and Buddhist cultivators had already been eyeing him with suspicion due to his attire. But when they heard the cautious tone in Gao Fangjing’s voice, their gazes gradually shifted away, pretending to focus on one another instead.

Li Xuanfeng had taken roughly fifteen minutes to obliterate Murong Wu in both body and soul, shatter Yu Qian’s dharma body, and tear apart a demonic creature with his bare hands. The ensuing rain of blood had deeply shocked the northern devil cultivators.

Then, he had even forced his way into Buddhist territory and slain Tang Shedu, catapulting his reputation to its peak. Many of the devil cultivators hadn’t seen him in person but they had all heard the name. None of them wanted to face him directly.

Gao Fangjing glanced around the room, True Flame burning steadily across his body, before finally speaking, “There’s no need to delay, fellow cultivators. More are on their way. If we wait too long, no matter how powerful we are, how much can we seize? And how many wounds will we suffer in the process?”

As his voice fell, Gao Fangjing raised his lance high and grinned, “Now that Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng is here, we have eight present. How about one-on-one duels, each to claim a cauldron?”

His words were blunt, completely disregarding Si Yuanli’s presence. The latter made as if to speak, only for Li Xuanfeng to extend an arm in his defense and say softly, “Just focus on protecting yourself, fellow Daoist.”

Before he could finish, a burst of brilliance erupted in the hall. Li Xuanfeng took a step forward and reached for the nearest cauldron, only to find, with a raised brow, that no one dared challenge him for it.

Instead, two nearby devil cultivators exchanged glances and suddenly launched their assault. One unleashed thick purple qi, the other rose in swirling demonic smoke. Together, they encircled Gao Fangjing, whose body blazed with True Flame, as thunderous explosions erupted.

So we meet again... Li Xuanfeng saw clearly as he hoisted the cauldron. It was a deep bluish-green, warm to the touch, and covered in opulent, ornate patterns of birds and beasts. There were dragons and phoenixes dancing across its surface.

One of the two attacking Gao Fangjing was cultivating Purple Essence. He was a devil cultivator named Murong Gong, whom Li Xuanfeng had briefly fought days before. His form was hidden in a purple mist as a swirl of demonic light surged around him.

“Hahaha...” Gao Fangjing burst into furious laughter. His lance flared with scorching True Flame, emitting dazzling golden-red light as he bellowed, “Murong, you vile old cur! I knew you’d pull something like this!”

Seven elite Foundation Establishment cultivators were now locked in battle, unleashing deafening blasts. Golden and white lights flashed as immortal and demonic energies surged and clashed, yet the grand hall stood firm, immovable as a mountain.

Boom!

As they exchanged blows, more massive booms echoed from afar. The entire Great Ning Palace immediately erupted into chaos in a chain reaction. Places that had been still and silent suddenly burst into action. Spiritual energy twisted and churned violently.

Li Xuanfeng weighed the cauldron which emanated a subtle mystical glow in his hand. The lid was tightly sealed and immovable. Even his spiritual sense couldn’t penetrate it. There seemed to be another world within, so it couldn’t be stored in a pouch.

He had little interest in the cauldron. Whatever treasure was inside, it was unlikely to end up fully in his possession. But Si Yuanli’s eyes were practically glued to it. Li Xuanfeng casually handed it to him and said softly, “Stay close.”

Si Yuanli nodded eagerly, his joy almost spilling off his face. He showed not a hint of refusal, murmuring gratefully, “Fellow Daoist, your generosity is unmatched! I’ll surely speak well of you before my ancestor. When we leave this grotto heaven, you’ll be handsomely rewarded...”

Li Xuanfeng responded nonchalantly, his spiritual sense silently locked on the screen behind the immortal throne. He paid no mind to Si Yuanli’s flattery.

Perhaps affected by the surrounding demonic and dharma light, the dim dark-green screen now gleamed with a richer hue, like an aged bronze. It stood firm behind the hall, unshaken by the residual waves of mana still rippling through the space.

Li Xuanfeng hesitated no longer. His gaze didn’t even linger on the mountainous piles of treasure below. He soared toward the throne, reaching for the screen.

“Hm?”

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes narrowed. Platinum lines suddenly lit up on his chin, flowing downward across his chest, forming the sleek and elegant Heavenly Gilded Helm. His eyes glowed faintly as he focused with intense concentration.

“Benefactor...” A figure suddenly appeared before him, calmly blocking his path. It was a burly man with long, narrow brows and a clean-shaven head. He wore a golden kasaya and gazed at him with gentle eyes.“This humble monk has long heard of your name and held you in deep admiration. But fate conspired against us, keeping our paths apart... Until now.”

Li Xuanfeng glared coldly, saying nothing. He had already raised his golden bow. Golden light surged forth as five arrows leapt onto the string. A sharp hum filled the great hall, silencing every cultivator in the room.

Clang!




# Chapter 836: Yuanli

Li Xuanfeng had risen to great fame during a North-South conflict. His reputation had spread beyond Jiangbei, and even the powers between Yan and Zhao had heard of him and knew his name.

This reputation had been forged through slaying Murong Wu and shattering Yu Qian’s dharma body. So, while he was renowned, he had also offended more northern Dao lineages than he could count on both hands.

The lofty Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Mahas might not care, but killing direct descendants, those with ties of blood and interest, had vaguely but surely offended a great number of northern cultivators.

Li Xuanfeng understood the grudges he had accumulated. Now, he no longer cared which northern Dao he offended. Whenever he struck, it was with full force, buzzing through the air.

The Buddhist cultivator before him was somewhat unusual. He lacked any sinister aura, and was instead somewhat similar to Luejin of the Great Mahayana Dharma Realm. His dharma light was much gentler and nearly approached Kongheng in purity.

The monk didn’t appear evil, but blocking his path without cause was enough reason not to hold back. As soon as this Buddhist cultivator appeared, Li Xuanfeng merged five arrows into one and shot it straight at his dharma body.

Buzz!

A burst of golden brilliance exploded before Li Xuanfeng, falling like scattered sparks. Sharp, piercing cries echoed like shattered metal. The burly man before him lit up, golden kasaya draped over his shoulders.

He said with a smile, "This humble monk is Jianà. I’ve long heard of your immortal arrows, benefactor. After much contemplation, I found this method to counter them. I was waiting precisely for your golden arrow!"

He had already rolled up his sleeves and now raised the entire dazzling golden kasaya high, displaying the side interwoven with brilliant patterns. Circular gold discs adorned it, emitting curling white smoke and golden mist as he chanted scripture, "Come, Venerable Great Capacity Heaven Receive!"

He spoke Sanskrit, and the layered golden mesh of the kasaya lit up with him. It was bright and immaculate, as if containing endless space within, flowing with golden mantra patterns. The golden light of the arrow buzzed in the air, then fell into the kasaya.

Jianà’s veins bulged as he gripped its corners and pulled his arms down. The golden kasaya floated midair, wrapping tightly around something. A massive bulge inside twisted and jumped violently, like a furious wild snake trapped within, struggling with all its might.

Jianà's face flushed red as he shouted, "Seal!"

All of his mana surged into the kasaya, and he actually managed to restrain the force for a moment. The slender eye-browed, bald monk revealed countless pale golden scriptures across his scalp.

"This..." Si Yuanli stood behind Li Xuanfeng, eyes fixed on the kasaya. A trace of concern rose in his heart as he held the large cauldron in his hands, Truly strange. It’s like a unique dharma artifact combined with a matching spell, specifically designed to counter flying objects like this. Looks like this bald donkey is no simple figure... not sure if Li Xuanfeng can suppress him...

He lowered his eyes thoughtfully; he was not as helpless as he appeared. The green sword at his waist twitched, its blade already secretly aimed at the monk.

When Master Monk Jianà managed to subdue the golden light, a hint of pride surfaced on his face. His thin brows arched as he lifted and flicked his hands, trying to redirect the golden light elsewhere when he heard a deep, iron-like voice, "Quite bold."

A sudden piercing screech rang in his ears, and his whole body seized up. The fierce man clad in golden soft armor had already appeared before him, the golden bow glowing brilliantly on his back.

Master Monk Jianà recoiled in shock and cried out, "You!"

Li Xuanfeng had only been three meters away; it was just a single step for him. The monk, however, had been too arrogant and focused entirely on guarding against the next arrow. He never expected this move.

His tiger eyes slightly opened, and his terrifying gray pupils flashed. One hand grabbed the monk’s neck, and the other yanked on his dazzling kasaya dharma artifact.

Platinum light gleamed from both arms as he exhaled sharply, "Hah!"

Crack!

Jianà struggled twice, flailing in place, but his neck was crushed like brittle wood, producing a series of crisp cracks.

But the moment Li Xuanfeng had appeared in front of him, his head had already rolled off his shoulders and shot through the air to flee. The kasaya dimmed and burst into golden light across the sky.

Boom!

An instant later, Li Xuanfeng’s fist pierced through his chest, bursting out from his back in a spray of multicolored brilliance. The muffled sound was not loud, but it was especially jarring.

Jianà’s body slumped like mud, while his head darted nearly half a kilometer away, looking back in terror.

The man brushed the golden light away with one hand, dispersing it into nothingness. Five spiritual arrows emerged from the glow, lining up in a row and swimming around his palm like five obedient golden-scaled fish.

Li Xuanfeng glanced coldly at the head in the distance and spoke in an icy tone, "Go."

Buzz...

The five streaks of golden light vanished instantly from his palm. Before Master Monk Jianà could speak, pain exploded through his organs, leaving him reeling. He forced himself to cast a spell and yanked out the gleaming kasaya.

Boom!

But how could this hastily conjured kasaya compare to the one he had prepared earlier? It lasted only a second before the arrows tore into it like a fierce wolf bursting into a straw hut and scattered it to the skies.

Pfft...

Soft, colorful petals rained down from the air, fluttering in every shade. The five golden arrows reappeared at Li Xuanfeng’s side, while Master Monk Jianà vanished without a trace.

Li Xuanfeng raised a sharp brow, unhurried. His gray eyes glinted with sarcasm as he spoke softly, "Since fellow Daoist was so eager to fight, why retreat at the last moment and leave without a word?"

A golden-red arrow had long been waiting, and it leaped eagerly onto his bowstring. Li Xuanfeng’s gray eyes sharpened as he drew his bow back to its maximum and aimed into the distant north.

"Fall."

As soon as the words left his mouth, the golden-red arrow vanished from the string. In the distance, radiant light exploded across the sky. Sizzling candle-like flames rained down, dancing on the lake’s surface before plunging deep into its waters.

Pfft...!

The sound of blood being spat drifted back to Li Xuanfeng on the wind. Many cultivators stood in the air, their expressions varied, but when he glanced down at them, they all quickly averted their gazes, avoiding eye contact.

"Truly living up to his name. That monk was naïve... he ended up as a laughingstock."

Only then did the glow on Li Xuanfeng’s bow begin to dim, and the platinum patterns on his face gradually faded away.

Si Yuanli hurried over and asked in a low voice, "Brother Xuanfeng! Did that bald monk Jianà die?"

Jianà was clearly an elite among Buddhist cultivators, with little distinction between his methods of escape and survival. His aura was somewhat similar to the Ancient Sects of Buddhism, and his spells lacked any sinister traits. Thus, Li Xuanfeng had held back and hadn’t struck to kill in the end.

Though he had secretly held back, his display was impressive enough to intimidate the devil cultivators around them. He casually walked down to stand before the six square cauldrons. Gazing at the dazzling treasures, he spoke softly to those behind him, "Go ahead..."

"This..."

Li Xuanfeng stood alone beneath the immortal seat. The surrounding devil cultivators hovered in the air, too afraid to fly closer, though their greedy and reluctant gazes were apparent.

Si Yuanli swallowed hard while staring at the cauldrons and replied, "Brother Xuanfeng! How could I have the nerve to take more? The best treasures have already landed in my hands... you decide what to take..."

"Hmm...?" Li Xuanfeng was surprised, causing him to glance at the man. Looking at the man’s honest and sincere appearance, Li Xuanfeng casually waved his hand, taking only two layers of the spirit items from the ground.

The dark green-black screen naturally fell into his hand as well. Then, without lingering, Li Xuanfeng took flight with Si Yuanli. Behind them, the devil cultivators could no longer restrain themselves—chaos erupted atop the great hall in a thunderous clash.

Naturally, Li Xuanfeng hadn’t taken everything in one go. He watched coldly as the devil and Buddhist cultivators broke out into a brawl. Even the seven cultivators within the central hall had settled their fights. Several dark lights fled in disgrace, and scattered across the sky.

"Murong Gong!" A thunderous shout echoed across the sky. Torrents of True Flame surged into the sky, golden-red light shooting up into the heavens and raining down as sheets of fire. Though the flames started as gold and crimson, they turned dark red midway down, sizzling as they scorched the air.

Gao Fangjing emerged from the great hall in a dark red robe, his face flowing with flame, hands entwined in raging fire like a demon god. A flickering violet light leapt feebly away, and Gao Fangjing laughed wildly, "Come now! Old dog Murong, bark one more time for grandpa, would you? Still have time to talk now?"

His strength was truly overwhelming. He had beaten Murong Gong and the devil cultivator into a sorry state, sending both fleeing in different directions. The watching cultivators all glanced sideways as he pursued them wielding his lance, flames trailing across the sky.

Li Xuanfeng glanced around, and Si Yuanli's soft voice reached his ear, "Brother Xuanfeng, what now?"

Si Yuanli’s earlier words had left Li Xuanfeng unsure of his temperament, so he simply answered softly, "I leave it to you, fellow Daoist."

Si Yuanli gripped the great cauldron tightly. He understood better than the others what lay within it. His hands clutched the green rim so hard they turned pale, and his expression grew grave as he thought to himself, But the location is wrong... The Daoist Master once said something from my family was inside a small hall in the lake, but we’ve already missed it... The Daoist Masters are watching from the surface, and I can’t afford to act too obviously...

Earlier I gave it back to Li Xuanfeng to avoid drawing ire, which might’ve raised his suspicions... but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. So far he’s one of us... if I can go with the flow, this might turn out better for me.

Though he was troubled inwardly, his face remained puzzled and hesitant as he shook his head and replied, "Why don’t we find another place to rest and wait for the Daoist Master to summon us out?"

Li Xuanfeng heard him clearly, but didn’t believe him in the slightest. This only confirmed his suspicions, The Si Family is discreet, not foolish... I’ve never heard of this Si Yuanli, but Master Yuan Xiu gave me that Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman in secret. There must be a reason for it...

If this matter was so easily resolved, why would he give me a Purple Mansion Realm talisman? Moreover, Yuan Xiu is famed for his expertise in talismans, so this one isn’t ordinary. He wouldn’t give it away without cause.

There must be a scheme here. Whatever he asks next, I’ll protect and follow.

As Si Yuanli turned toward him, Li Xuanfeng didn’t overthink it and responded softly, "I’ll follow your lead, fellow Daoist!"

Si Yuanli nodded quickly, looking every bit the timid and meek figure, and answered, "There are many northern cultivators here. Though Brother Xuanfeng is strong and fears none, there may still be strange methods difficult to guard against. It would be unwise to linger too long...

"There were many small halls on the lake we passed by along the way earlier. While they may not hold anything valuable, they’re safe and easy to access. Why not go take a look?"

Li Xuanfeng responded with a grunt, immediately understanding, So that’s why this old fox looked so reluctant earlier and acted like he was trading sesame for a watermelon. It turns out the item his Daoist Master mentioned is in one of those lake halls...

The thought flashed through his mind. Si Yuanli truly played the part of a timid man to perfection. When their eyes happened to meet, his look of fear was flawlessly acted.

Since he had kept up the act this far, Li Xuanfeng played along, frowning deeply as he said, "I’ve been tasked to protect you, so naturally I’ll follow wherever you go."

Si Yuanli chuckled awkwardly and quickly fled the cliffside at the center of the battlefield with Li Xuanfeng. A few devil and Buddhist cultivators still trailed them from afar, their eyes glinting with hesitation. Si Yuanli drew his green sword and let out a relieved expression.

He’s a fine warrior. He’s strong, flexible, socially adept, and able to read the times. No wonder the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators favor him so much... a golden bow indeed, and very useful...

He looked left and right while scanning the lake for palaces. He even had the spare attention to run through his thoughts again, No wonder Daoist Master Yuan Su married his family's daughter to him and held him in such regard. After Yuan Su’s death, our own master took him in without delay...

Yu Su is greedy, selfish, and even ignores even his kin. Lingu Rao is formidable, but his family is too deeply tied to the Great Xiukui Temple. Only this one is capable, values loyalty, and is easy to coerce. If I were a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, I’d use him too...

Si Yuanli paused slightly as a small palace appeared on the surface of the lake below them. He quickly gathered his thoughts and feigned surprise, looking up and asking, "People are still out here looting?"

"Just so you know, not every faction sent their core disciples inside... some lacked the strength and stayed at the periphery early on to collect spirit items and treasures. It's not a bad strategy." Since Si Yuanli was continuing to play his role, Li Xuanfeng responded offhandedly. His gaze swept across the devil cultivator below, then suddenly narrowed as he murmured, "Hmm?"

A certain devil cultivator below them had a cold face and held a sinister demon blade. His tall nose and deep eye sockets marked him as one of the northernmost cultivators. He was most likely from either South or North Mobei, with Hu or Jie ancestry almost certainly in the mix.

Though he had never seen this man before, Li Xuanfeng found his attire and bearing strikingly familiar to a description he’d heard in the past. He stared quietly, and the golden bow behind him suddenly leaped into his hand.

What a coincidence. I searched for him many times amid all the devilish smoke and battles without luck. Yet here he is, right inside the Great Ning Palace.

After all, the man below was a devil cultivator. Si Yuanli didn’t find it strange that Li Xuanfeng took up his bow, but when he saw how solemn his expression was, he assumed it must be a formidable foe and asked softly, "Brother Xuanfeng? Who is that?"




# Chapter 838: Taking Action

"Hold on, fellow Daoist."

Li Xuanfeng gave no further reply. The black-clad youth below was extremely alert. He merely glanced once up at them and instantly stirred up devil winds, his robe billowing as he fled in the opposite direction. If he was not struck down in time, he could become a future threat.

Li Xuanfeng drew back his bowstring and a golden arrow settled onto the string. The youth below immediately felt his ears ring, dread flooding his heart as his body trembled with instinctive alarm.

Their eyes had met earlier. Li Xuanfeng’s perception technique had pierced through the black mist on the youth’s face and saw his features clearly. The youth had also seen his features. The moment he saw that bow in Li Xuanfeng’s hand, he prepared to flee, with high alert in his heart.

Now, understanding dawned upon him like a plunge into an icy lake. He shuddered inwardly, That’s the Bianyan’s Immortal Bow, Li Xuanfeng...

This youth was none other than Helian Changguang of Tiefo State, the one who had fought Li Qinghong during the devil plague. Back then, Li Qinghong had slain the female cultivator at his side and obtained a Dharma robe which had later been forged into the Cyan Sparrow Plume. She had once worried over it and specifically mentioned it to Li Xuanfeng.

As Li Xuanfeng loosed an arrow, thoughts raced through Helian Changguang's mind like lightning. He quickly made a judgment in his heart, Seems the small hall I was heading toward has already caught their eyes, this arrow is to block me!

So he immediately leaped away from the hall, not hoping to dodge the ghostlike arrow, but fully presenting a posture of retreat. Devil smoke churned beneath his feet as he stepped back twice. Pain bloomed in his chest, and he coughed up blood.

Though Helian Changguang was Tiefo State royalty, their nation was already weak, and in recent years had suffered a severe decline in talent. Things had gotten so bad that a mere mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator like him had been sent out. Clearly, there was no one else to use.

Helian Changguang had been constantly on edge during this whole foray. Any random cultivator around him would at least be in late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm and many even stronger. Just now, he had merely clashed with a single devil and had nearly been killed.

He was a naturally cautious man. He couldn’t see where the arrow came from nor where it would go. All he felt was a numbness and pain, and suddenly a gaping hole had opened in his chest. Terror consumed him.

To have such a towering reputation... he truly is exceptional. When weapon mastery reaches its peak, it births intent. This man surely possesses arrow intent...

He had no intention of entangling himself with Li Xuanfeng. He immediately turned to flee, pulling out a life-saving talisman as black energy ignited around his body. He muttered under his breath, "Translucent Bloodsilver Technique!"

But Li Xuanfeng only drew nearer. The first arrow returned to his bowstring, and another leaped up from his waist. He pulled the string taut once more.

"Strike!"

In the distance, the black-clad youth's head exploded like a watermelon, releasing a cloud of blood mist. His hands clawed at where his head had been, and his headless body panicked further, transforming into a streak of devil light and fleeing at top speed.

He really means to kill me!

Helian Changguang couldn't guess Li Xuanfeng's thoughts. He poured all of his mana and blood essence into his spell. He pushed the Translucent Bloodsilver Technique to its limit, forming a silver-red aura that worked to expel as much of the Astral Qi from his body as possible.

"Hmm?"

Helian Changguang's Translucent Bloodsilver Technique was a secret method of the Whole Pill Dao. Perhaps it was the outer world's qi or the nature of the secret realm, but its power had inexplicably increased. He coughed up a blood arrow, but it was shredded by Astral Qi before it could touch the ground.

This surprised Li Xuanfeng. His Astral Qi had been refined through a combination of spiritual orifices and lifelong cultivation, and was now enhanced by two Immortal Foundations. Its power was terrifying.

Once someone was infected by his Astral Qi, it clung like a bone-rotting parasite. It would bind to one's mana and, once inside the body, would take years to purge. It was not something a simple blood cough could resolve.

Perhaps his spell art is truly extraordinary... thought Li Xuanfeng.

Li Xuanfeng didn’t recognize his Immortal Foundation, but beside him, Si Yuanli gave a soft exclamation of surprise. Li Xuanfeng’s waist quivered as three more arrows jumped up. His vigilance had deepened.

According to Qinghong's description, this man is cautious, capable, ruthless and decisive. That seems entirely accurate.

Though his cultivation is still shallow, he’s already able to dissolve my Astral Qi. His technique must be marvelous. He’s simply not strong enough to unleash its full potential. Someone like him mustn’t be allowed to escape. I must not be careless. It’s better to eliminate him early and avoid future trouble.

He drew his golden bow to a full moon curve. Five arrows circled the bow but did not touch the string. Instead, a gold-red arrow darted from his waist like a swimming fish and settled obediently on the bow.

Clang!

A burst of golden-red light erupted in the distance. Si Yuanli felt a sudden gust of wind sting his face and couldn’t help but glance at the middle-aged man beside him in astonishment, "Brother Xuanfeng, isn’t that a bit much to kill a chicken with an ox blade?"

His only answer was a buzzing sound, as Li Xuanfeng vanished from his side. When Si Yuanli looked up, he saw that while Helian Changguang's devil light was fast, it was not nearly fast enough to outpace the arrow. He had already turned into a sky full of devil smoke.

Li Xuanfeng's eyes flashed with golden light as he flew at lightning speed into the devil smoke. His Heavenly Gilded Helm was operating at full power, enhancing his speed even further. He reached into the smoke and snatched at something, finally stopping to scan his surroundings with narrowed eyes.

Si Yuanli stepped closer and saw the fierce man slowly open his palm, revealing a silver-gray drop of mercury that writhed and spun in his hand, radiating a faintly intoxicating glow.

A thin layer of silver light coated the mercury drop, resisting Li Xuanfeng’s mana and preserving Helian Changguang’s soul. But now, that light was gradually fading, growing dimmer and dimmer.

Si Yuanli feigned sudden realization, exhaled heavily, and said quietly, "The Whole Pill Dao is known for its mystique. As expected, it includes many life-saving spell arts. If not for Brother Xuanfeng’s vigilance, this one would have truly escaped."

Li Xuanfeng nodded silently. The drop of mercury in his palm suddenly revealed a face. He was high-nosed and deep-eyed, unmistakably Helian Changguang himself. His voice was sorrowful as he said, “Immortal seniors, I have never offended either of you... I merely lingered a few steps too long; does that warrant my death? Senior Xuanfeng, your junior killed my concubine, took my dharma artifact, and chased me to ruin and dismemberment. I’ve not sought revenge, yet now you seek my life? Is this the act of a true and righteous man...”

Helian Changguang had pieced together the reason for Li Xuanfeng’s murderous intent in just a few seconds. His voice turned mournful, filled with pitiful desperation.

Si Yuanli laughed heartily and simply said, "You’re a devil head, does killing you need a reason? Man-eaters and blood-drinkers like you deserve death from all."

Li Xuanfeng merely tilted his head, gaze shifting away. He didn’t reply to Helian Changguang at all. His mana grew brighter and brighter, polishing away the silver sheen on the mercury drop.

Crack...

Before Helian Changguang could respond again, Li Xuanfeng’s radiant mana had surged past all resistance. His soul was instantly annihilated, leaving only the dimly glowing drop of mercury behind.

Li Xuanfeng’s mana hadn’t harmed the object at all. He swirled his mana around it once and withdrew it. Li Xuanfeng stared at the drop of mercury lying silently in his hand. He suspected it to be a dharma artifact, so he channeled his mana through it a few more times, but no dharma light emerged.

Could it be a spirit item...? Li Xuanfeng frowned as he tried to determine its origin. The ever observant Si Yuanli saw his mana flash twice and softly remarked, "I doubt it’s a Purple Mansion Realm spirit item. It seems this man’s entire cultivation was transformed into a spirit item and condensed into this tiny mercury drop. It’s quite a curiosity indeed."

His words were clear enough. Li Xuanfeng flipped his hand and stored the item, silently wondering, If this is a Purple Mansion Realm spirit item, perhaps Daoist Master Qiushui could make use of it? If I can use it to earn her goodwill and trade for the Radiant Sky Stone, that would be ideal...

Si Yuanli had recovered Helian Changguang’s dharma artifact, but his storage pouch could no longer be found. The crafty youth had embedded a small spirit array in it so that his sudden death destroyed the pouch, burning away nearly all of its contents. Only a few durable spirit items had fallen into the lake.

The two said little and made their way toward the small palace. Si Yuanli quickly passed through the corridor and paused at the main hall’s entrance, studying it closely. Though he had confirmed something internally, he still voiced apparent surprise, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng! This hall still has remnants of a formation!"

"Oh?" Li Xuanfeng followed him down and paused at the entrance. Two stone statues sculpted into Three-Eyed Mount Tiao Beasts, famed for guarding formations and drawing wealth, flanked the door. The ancients had favored them as household guardians.

"What a fine ancient formation!" Si Yuanli stopped and pointed to the formation, marveling, "Come take a look quickly, this formation is quite something. It’s a rare ancient formation with the Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang as its cores. These two Fruition Attainments never manifested but also never shifted, so the formation can still function to some extent. The owner of this hall must have been extraordinary..."

He seemed thoroughly intrigued, speaking at length from the formation’s foundational patterns to its yin-yang balance, even touching on the impact of Shangyuan Dao attainment. Li Xuanfeng listened thoughtfully, Perhaps opening this formation will trigger some major change. Si Yuanli is likely stalling on purpose until it’s closer to the time we leave the Great Ning Palace, so as to avoid complications.

Li Xuanfeng didn’t press him, treating it as an opportunity to hear some rare stories. Since Si Yuanli seemed to be making idle conversation, he deliberately asked something obscure, "That’s interesting. Do you know how many have attained the Fruition of Yin and Yang today?"

Si Yuanli faltered slightly, but had no choice but to answer, "The Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang Fruitions are very exalted. The last few holders were all immortals. The Supreme Yang once belonged to Immortal Yingze... and the Supreme Yin to the Immortal Lord of Moonlight Origin Mansion. Unfortunately, both disappeared ages ago and have left no traces...

"Whether they are dead or in seclusion attempting breakthroughs, I’m just a humble cultivator and wouldn’t dare speculate. It would only shorten my lifespan... better not to say more."

As he spoke, standing idly started to feel awkward. He placed a hand on the formation, seemingly studying its patterns and thinking of ways to break it.

His tone was casual. "As for Bright Yang and Veiled Yin, fellow Daoist surely knows more about Bright Yang than I do, so I won’t elaborate. But Veiled Yin has remained vacant ever since its previous bearer was slain by the Wei Emperor, which is what set the current trend of male cultivators vastly outnumbering females..."

He had spoken too quickly and paused for two seconds, as if realizing he had said too much. He hurriedly glossed over the two Fruition Attainments and said in a low voice, “Lesser Yang is none other than the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch, Kuai Li! The tale of Splitreed Island is known across the world... The Devil Monarch was split into three by Immortal Yingze, which led to the rise of Dragon Monarch Xiyang. To this day, Dragon Monarch Xiyang still considers Immortal Yingze his senior.

“‘Lesser Yin’ is even more elusive, few Dao lineages have even heard of one that bears it...”

He barely finished his words and noticed Li Xuanfeng was about to ask more. Unease crept in. There were many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators watching from outside, many from Golden Core Dao lineages. If he said the wrong thing, it would be troublesome. He made up his mind and quickly patted the formation, saying urgently, "Brother Xuanfeng, I’ve found a way."

Not allowing another interruption, he handed the green cauldron to Li Xuanfeng and quickly said, “This formation once reached Purple Mansion Realm at its peak, but it’s decayed over time. Look at this...”

He pointed at the eight rays of light at the center of the formation. There were six outer ones surrounding two inner yin-yang flows. He explained, “The inner two represent Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang Fruition. But two of the six outer lights have failed. What remains are Pristine, Converging, Joy, and Geng. Remove these four, and we can immediately enter the formation.”

Li Xuanfeng took a close look. He wasn’t well-versed in formations, but noticed that Si Yuanli had produced two white talismans and placed them in his palm. He glanced at the talismans. They shimmered faintly with multicolored light, about three fingers wide and a palm’s length. One bore four words in green-gray ink, Turn Pristine into Converging.

The other was written in pale golden-white script, nearly blending into the paper itself, Borrow Geng for Joy.

The two talismans matched the four formation aspects perfectly. Si Boxiu’s intentions were now plain; it was the moment when hidden knives were drawn. Si Yuanli raised the talismans high, as his slouch vanished and he straightened.

His gaze sharpened, all trace of weakness gone, and he spoke in a solemn tone, “By the Mandate of Heaven, Geng is lent to Joy, as dragon and serpent struggle, Pristine is turned into Converging... thus granting access to true law, and wondrous divine ability...”
𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎

Though he spoke rapidly, his voice carried solemn weight. It hung in the air for two seconds before green-gray and pale gold lights burst from his hands, shooting skyward and exploding in brilliant flashes.

Boom!

Green raindrops began to fall from above. Li Xuanfeng had prepared in advance, so his mana gathered into a golden shield before him, blocking the sweeping aftermath as he silently stepped back.

His eyes opened slightly, golden mana gleaming white. The corridor beneath his feet collapsed, revealing a sheet of deep blue Converging Water before the main hall. Two green fish-shaped bells hanging from the eaves jingled, then fell mid-air, disintegrating into beads of bronze before hitting the ground.

The six rays of light in the formation flickered. The green Pristine and blue Converging reversed, while the white Joy and golden Geng inverted. The entire formation crumbled like dust in the wind, collapsing without force and dissolving into scattered color.

Unlike most broken formations, no shockwaves spread, nor did any restrictive power activate. It was as if the formation had never existed, leaving behind only a hollow gleam.

Creak...

The hall doors swung open with a creak. Si Yuanli, now energetic and unrecognizably spry, leaped inside. His deep voice echoed out, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng! Take whatever you wish inside, I only want the scroll on the table. But we must leave in ten seconds! Once the others arrive, escape will be impossible!"




# Chapter 840: I Should Not Enter

His tone was resolute, and his eyes were sharp. His sword was lifted high, and shed sword essence bright as frost, exuding an ethereal air. No longer the coward from before, white mist rose beneath his feet as he flew into the hall.

Li Xuanfeng naturally followed close behind, golden bow glowing as he sped forward. The round grand hall was somewhat empty, with a few square cauldrons placed about. A jade platform, radiating brilliant white light, stood at the center. The jade platform had eight corners and was shaped like a blooming lotus. A jade box, etched with intricate golden patterns, gently floated in the air above the platform.

The hall alternated between light and shadow. Golden light lit up the ceiling, where talismans hung from red threads at varying heights, swaying and colliding in the gust stirred by the two intruders.

The highest seat of law glowed dimly. Its armrests were shaped like phoenixes, and the large screen behind bore complex patterns, converging brightly at the center to form one large word, Sima.

Not Si... It’s Sima...

Si Yuanli didn’t even glance at the jade platform. He rode the wind straight past it and reached for the tall desk. Sure enough, a scroll lay upon it. It was seemingly ordinary, without a trace of dharma light.

What a lavish grand hall...

He stepped right up to it in two strides. Li Xuanfeng, as expected, reached for the gold-patterned jade box atop the jade platform. The platform had no real protective measures, only a thin light film covering its aura. Li Xuanfeng simply reached out and grasped it.

The gold-patterned jade box was scorching hot. It radiated searing heat as it landed in his hand, a warm breeze brushing across his face. A single gesture allowed Li Xuanfeng to pull down most of the golden talismans in the hall and stuff them into his pouch in one breath.

Meanwhile, his spiritual sense slipped into the jade box, where a streak of red-golden brilliance darted back and forth. It scorched his spiritual sense, causing his heart to thump as he wondered, This looks like...

Si Yuanli had already retrieved the scroll and was fleeing the hall. Li Xuanfeng, neither careless nor greedy, swiftly followed him back to the entrance. There, he spotted a letter and an incense burner on a small table. He grabbed them just in time and stored them away.

His spiritual sense was still checking the gold-patterned jade box when a sudden thought struck like lightning, Fiery red like gold, darting like light... It must be the Supreme Yang Sun Essence...

The joy stayed in his mind for only a moment before shock struck his heart, and the item in his hand suddenly felt even more scalding. He quickly reviewed everything, Si Yuanli made it sound nice, saying, 'take whatever you want'... but a spirit item like the Supreme Yang Sun Essence isn't something ordinary cultivators can keep... Now we took the jade box, those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators may very well have seen it. If I walk out of Great Ning Palace with this in hand, they’ll surely suspect me. Am I not walking into death?

His heart was clear, When he said 'take freely,' it was likely only referring to those golden talismans and common items. As for the rest, how could one justify keeping them to oneself...

He kept the gold-patterned jade box in hand, since he dared not place it in his storage pouch. Doing so would surely raise suspicion upon exit. Though scalding hot, Li Xuanfeng calmly raised the spirit item and handed it to Si Yuanli, speaking in a steady tone, "This rightfully belongs to your esteemed family. I, Xuanfeng, dare not keep it for myself."

Si Yuanli rode the wind at full speed, scanning both sides carefully. He paused in surprise when he heard these words. As he reached out to take it back, the scorching heat met his hand, and his spiritual sense jolted. He immediately understood.

He quickly stowed it away, asking no questions. Instead, he solemnly said, "Once we are out of Great Ning Palace, I will explain everything in detail."

The implications of his words only struck Si Yuanli once they left his lips. He considered explaining further but felt it would only make matters worse. Li Xuanfeng, however, instantly understood, Ah... so it really is the Sima Family.

Si Yuanli had moved with practiced ease the whole time, and Li Xuanfeng had already harbored suspicions. His doubts had only increased once Si Yuanli had produced the exact two talismans needed.

Though Si Boxiu was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, the sky was filled with many others of that realm, especially Maha and the Merciful One. Who among them couldn’t see through Si Boxiu’s plans? Why, then, was Si Yuanli the only one to have come all this way in disguise?

Putting it all together with the Sima character in the hall, Li Xuanfeng realized this grand hall belonged to the Si Family. When he asked casually, Si Yuanli wasn’t paying attention and responded without thought, effectively confirming it.

So the Si Family really does hail from Ning State... or at least has a branch there... In any case, Si Yuanli played dumb the whole way just to achieve his goal.

They split up the moment they entered the grotto heaven. It seems even Si Boxiu might be wary of the Chi Family.

If Li Xuanfeng could see this much, how could the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators high above, let alone the Mahas, miss it?

Now that Si Yuanli had retrieved the item, he no longer bothered to conceal anything and said solemnly, "Though I feigned ignorance all the way, many northern cultivators are already aware of the southern situation. They are guarding against my clan; it will come sooner than expected."

Just as he finished speaking, black demonic mist rose from the lake beneath them and chased after the two. These devil cultivators had seemingly intended to enter the hall but suddenly changed direction and veered toward them instead.

Li Xuanfeng turned with bow in hand, firing two arrows in rapid succession like shooting stars. They streaked into the demonic mist, and golden light burst beneath his feet, forcing several of the devils back.

While Li Xuanfeng blocked the pursuing devil cultivators, Si Yuanli also drew his sword and soared into the sky. His stance was entirely different from before. Though he was not widely known, he had cultivated at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm for years. His longsword was elegant and powerful, its light gathering into true sword essence.
𝒻𝑟𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝑛𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝘤𝘰𝘮

A flick of his sword in midair struck down a crimson blade with a sudden bang. He reversed his grip and flung out a burst of bright sword essence, speaking in a low voice, "Brother Xuanfeng, be careful."

Li Xuanfeng remained composed. The golden string in his hand quivered, releasing a burst of golden light that shot down a demon in the mist.

Si Yuanli muffled a grunt as he muttered, "Brother Xuanfeng!"

Just as he spoke, four gold-robed master monks appeared around them, each taking a position at one of the cardinal directions. Their expressions were calm, and their chests half-bared.

They each had a different weapon—saber, spear, staff, and cudgel—and they spoke in unison, "You two benefactors have grown far too greedy!"

The massive cauldron floated beside Si Yuanli, glowing with a mesmerizing blue radiance. The two of them had taken the most precious items from the cave dwelling, and the two sky-reaching talismans had caused such a stir that all of Great Ning Palace had noticed. They were now obvious targets.

Li Xuanfeng’s gaze swept across the four identical monks. In the distance, several more clouds of demonic mist were rushing toward them. Sensing danger, he raised his golden bow again, a crimson-gold arrow leaping into place.

Si Yuanli also knew they couldn’t afford to be surrounded by these four. He activated his Immortal Foundation mana and his green robe turned white.

Snowflakes fell around him as he flicked his sword and said coldly, "North!"

Sword light burst from his blade, transforming into ethereal mist that fell like white snow. Though it appeared otherworldly and light, each flake was deadly. It was the Si Family's Pinewhite Full Essence Sword Art.

The crimson-gold glow also vanished from Li Xuanfeng's bowstring. A piercing whine echoed through the air as the northern Buddhist cultivator’s expression darkened. He raised his long staff high while the other three slowly closed their eyes, channeling their golden light toward him.

"Haah!"

Just as he shouted, he was immediately shredded by the blizzard of sword light. The monk had only just opened his eyes when a massive gash was torn through his throat. Astral Qi mixed with crimson-gold light sprayed forth, nearly ripping his body apart.

Si Yuanli’s sword essence was far stronger than the monk had expected. Most of the golden energy he had prepared to counter Li Xuanfeng was spent resisting the sword strikes, leaving him open to the arrow that had arrived.

Li Xuanfeng drew his bow again but saw that the Northern Master Monk’s body had melted like mud, his glow shifting until he became another spear-wielding monk. Si Yuanli furrowed his brow, but just then, a devil cultivator had raced ahead of the group and was nearly on them.

Clang!

The black-clad devil cultivator drew his spear in a flash of black light. The weapon surged like a dragon, striking fiercely at the Buddhist cultivator. Si Yuanli was momentarily stunned by the devil cultivator’s choice, but immediately seized the chance, raising another storm of white sword light.

"You—!"

The spear-wielding Buddhist cultivator was clearly shocked and had no choice but to raise his spear to parry. The two spears collided midair with a thunderous boom. Li Xuanfeng let out a slow breath, feeling his mana surge and ebb within him, and raised a crimson-gold arrow to his bow once again.

Buzz!
𝒻𝑟𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝑛𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝘤𝘰𝘮

Four currents of mana intertwined in an instant. The spear-wielding Buddhist cultivator had just parried with his weapon and couldn’t react in time. He was struck head-on by the white mist and the crimson-gold arrow.

He let out a cry of pain. "Ah!"

His body was blasted to ashes, leaving only a head flying high into the air. The four-man encirclement collapsed at once, and the glow on the remaining three dimmed. Li Xuanfeng and Si Yuanli didn’t bother with a follow-up strike and rode the wind northward without hesitation.

After speeding half a kilometer away, Li Xuanfeng glanced back, only to see that the black-robed devil cultivator had been exceptionally devious. He had stabbed the severed head with his spear but deliberately kept it alive, parading it about as he dashed off southward with the bald head.

"Zhong Qian..."

This man was none other than Zhong Qian, who had been dispatched under Daoist Master Chang Yun’s command. He hadn’t exchanged a single word with Li Xuanfeng. He hadn’t even spared him a glance, and simply dashed southward with the head impaled on his spear.

The remaining three Buddhist cultivators were caught in a dilemma. Neither north nor south was ideal. After hesitating in the air for a breath, they ultimately chose to abandon their fallen companion and resumed chasing the two cultivators.

But Si Yuanli and Li Xuanfeng had already flown far ahead. The sword cultivator from the Si Family laughed loudly and hurled several streaks of sword light as he mockingly shouted, "Bald donkeys! Chase me again and I’ll string up the rest of your three heads too!"

As he roared with laughter, a sheet of red erupted in the northern sky. Blazing True Flame surged skyward, igniting the clouds above. A burly man in dark crimson robes, holding a cauldron under one arm, swaggered proudly as he laughed, "Murong, you old dog! You can’t even catch your granddaddy with just four of you!"

It was none other than Gao Fangjing, cultivator of True Flame. He had snatched away two great cauldrons and brazenly soared into the sky, drawing the gaze of many. A swarm of devil cultivators swarmed toward him, drastically reducing the pressure on the two of them.

Si Yuanli cheered, "Good man! I love this kind of unruly brute!"

Li Xuanfeng looked at the sky filled with blazing True Flame. The tension in his bowstring slowly eased as he observed silently, a doubt arising in his heart, Something's not right... The Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman hasn’t even been used yet. This is far from over.

Just as Li Xuanfeng slowed, a murmur reached their ears, "Yuanli, give the Huai River Map to Xuanfeng."

The voice was aged and solemn; it was none other than Daoist Master Yuan Xiu. Li Xuanfeng paused slightly. Si Yuanli fended off an approaching devil cultivator with his sword and handed the scroll over without hesitation.

Li Xuanfeng accepted it in stride. The murmur of incantations once again sounded in his ear as Yuan Xiu transmitted the scroll’s spell. As he memorized it in silence, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth suddenly shifted.

Rumble!

Some kind of restriction was seemingly triggered at the cliff in the center of Great Ning Palace. A radiant column of iridescent light surged skyward, lighting up several kilometers. It was clearly visible from across the lake.

A faint circular arc appeared in the sky, and a rain of pale droplets began to fall. Li Xuanfeng’s eyes narrowed as he slowly recalled the appearance of Mirage Mirror Heaven at Green Pine Temple. At last, his lingering doubts were resolved, So this is where you were waiting for me.

A grotto heaven...

Everyone within Great Ning Palace looked up and listened before rushing toward the cliff in a frenzy.

Si Yuanli, however, seemed unsurprised as he turned to Li Xuanfeng, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng, shall we head in now?"

Li Xuanfeng was about to respond when he suddenly felt his instincts twinge. A strong sense of danger had suddenly surged in his heart. The talisman seeds that had lain dormant in his qi sea for years stirred slightly, causing his two Immortal Foundations to tremble faintly.

I shouldn’t enter?

Alarm bells rang in Li Xuanfeng’s mind. He quietly looked up and saw the semicircular grotto heaven in the sky gradually revealing its colors. A crystalline glow shimmered brilliantly in the center. It was perhaps some treasure.

I shouldn’t go in...

A chill rose in Li Xuanfeng's heart. But Yuan Xiu hadn’t just sent him here for the Great Ning Palace. There was no retreat now. He could only stall for time and said thoughtfully, "We have great treasures on us; we shouldn’t act rashly. There might be devil cultivators lying in wait near that light column... I’ve expended much mana fleeing from all those cultivators, might I rest briefly and regulate my qi?"

His words took Si Yuanli by surprise. The middle-aged man suddenly realized Li Xuanfeng hadn’t stopped drawing his bow for the entire chase, and had even stepped in to protect him earlier, so his mana might truly be low.

He quickly said, "Indeed, no need to rush. Let us pause for a moment and proceed slowly by windflight."

————

World within the mirror.

Nestled among grey-black peaks, a pale moon-colored palace atop a raised platform shimmered faintly. The clouds above had scattered, releasing beams of radiant light.

The light in the sky was dim, and the wisp of Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence hung there like a sun, illuminating the great void beyond. One could faintly glimpse various Mahas and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators seated in formation around Great Ning Palace.

Li Xuanfeng had been drawn into the conflict between Maha and Zipei, which involved multiple Mahas and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Lu Jiangxian had been quietly watching from the side. It was he who had forcibly sealed the talisman seeds in Li Xuanfeng’s body, rendering them unresponsive to the divine abilities of Mahas and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. It had saved him much effort in concealment.

His gaze pierced through the veil, landing on the scene within the great void. Anhuai Heaven, resembling a translucent glass orb, was slowly approaching the mortal realm. The images within it were becoming clearer by the moment.




# Chapter 842: Anhuai Heaven

Fine drizzle fell endlessly within Anhuai Heaven. Dark teal and pale blue palaces stood gracefully amidst flowing streams, while winding bridges threaded between the structures. The entire complex was arranged with elegant precision, bearing the refined charm of Jiangbei craftsmanship.

Truly beautiful.

Lu Jiangxian’s gaze followed the riverside scenery of Anhuai Heaven upward. His divine sense penetrated the illusion, inspecting every detail thoroughly as he swept through it and reached its deepest recesses.

There, he found a pristine celestial palace, lit by luminous green lanterns. A cascade of crystal light poured out from its gates like a waterfall, flowing in every direction. A stairway of sparkling steps led upward to a lone immortal seat that faced the starlit night of the grotto heaven.

Lu Jiangxian took just one glance and froze slightly, his pupils widening as he murmured, "What... is that..."

The celestial seat at the summit was carved with dragons and phoenixes, its armrests adorned with depictions of two flood dragons. Large enough to hold two adults lying down, the seat was vacant—save for a tiny, crystalline object resting upon it.

Though it was barely the size of a fingernail, it stood out upon the grand seat with an inexplicable allure that made it impossible to look away. It gleamed with a crystal luster, as if it had emerged from a narrow aperture. Its ends intertwined and condensed into a jade-like piece the size of a finger. All kinds of illusions erupted from it like a fountain.

These fantastical and surreal visions included Daoists refining pills and ascending upon consumption, white cranes delivering fruits, monkeys knocking at doors, crystal shards exploding, and brine condensing.

From time to time, white cranes and Daoists flew out of the illusions and landed on the palace grounds. The Daoists continued refining their pills while the cranes gently dropped fruits into the pill furnace, causing white flames to flare.

In the blink of an eye, a breeze of spiritual energy swept past, shattering the visions. Then, new ones emerged as monkeys knocked again while immortals laid hands upon devotees' heads.

Metallic Essence... It’s Metallic Essence.

Metallic Essence remnants exist within Anhuai Heaven!

He had seen the Bright Yang Metallic Essence with his own eyes. He was in disbelief as the grotto heaven slowly took form in the great void. He immediately realized something was amiss, If that’s Metallic Essence... the situation in Anhuai Heaven has far surpassed anyone’s expectations... Those Purple Mansion Realm schemers thought they were trying to hook a fish, only to drag up an entire pond! Even they won’t be able to cover this up!

The great void is filled with Mahas. Cultivators are already leaping into Anhuai Heaven! In less than fifteen minutes, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Mahas will be able to observe inside... Things will soon spiral out of control. Li Xuanfeng must not be allowed to enter!

———

Chengshui Tomb.

The sky was pitch black. The various Mahas, along with the Merciful One, sat in command, emanating waves of multicolored light. On the other side, the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters had varied expressions. Some of them held dharma artifacts, while others sat quietly amidst the clouds, calmly observing the scene below.

The water’s surface below them resembled a tabletop. The pavilions and towers atop it were barely palm-sized, and the figures upon them looked like ants, brandishing their dharma artifacts and clashing over prizes. Occasionally, their collisions would emit pinpricks of brilliance that flickered briefly before vanishing.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' eyes varied between indifference and serenity as they all focused on the tabletop below. Their spiritual senses drifted about, occasionally pausing upon one another.

As the situation in the waters evolved, more and more gazes converged on two individuals. The first was the stern-faced Yuan Xiu, but the other was none other than the poised and elegant Bo Lie King, Gao Fu.

The burly man, wreathed in True Flame, stroked his beard and smiled slightly. The Gao Family wasn’t particularly dominant among the northern factions, and normally wouldn’t draw much attention. Yet Gao Fangjing, the greatest talent of their clan in nearly a century, had been slaughtering freely in the waters below and seizing great spoils. No wonder Gao Fu beamed with delight.

Daoist Master Yuan Xiu’s face revealed nothing, but the hand resting atop his sleeve was relaxed, revealing a composed and content demeanor. He was clearly pleased deep down.

Daoist Master Qiushui watched quietly, her gaze pausing on Zhong Qian. Meanwhile, Daoist Master Chang Yun kept his brows lowered, his expression unreadable.

Qiushui softly remarked, "Daoist Master Yuan Xiu, I’ve never seen this Si Yuanli before. He’s quite the talent. No wonder you kept him so well hidden."

Si Boxiu forced a faint smile onto his stern face and replied quietly, "Daoist Qiushui flatters me. The Si Family has seen a decline in talent. This is the only one we’ve had in years. He does have some ability, but calling him a 'young genius' is perhaps too much praise."

Though his words were modest, he felt quite gratified. The Si Family not only had few members, but those few with promise often opposed him. Yuan Xiu had long found it troublesome, but finally, there was a younger cultivator who brought honor to the clan, and that gave him a sense of relief.

Just as Qiushui finished speaking, a crystalline light pillar that pierced heaven and earth emerged from within Great Ning Palace. Several Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters exchanged glances, smiles blooming across their faces.

Daoist Master Chang Yun chuckled. "You all calculated it precisely! Great Ning Palace really does hold the entrance to Anhuai Heaven!"

"This is thanks to Daoist Master Qiushui..."

Daoist Master Yuan Xiu returned the compliment casually, but Daoist Master Qiushui only smiled and said, "Everyone had their guesses, yet now you all place the credit on me."

The mood among the Daoist Masters was clearly pleasant. There were faint stirrings in the great void as other hidden Purple Mansion Realm cultivators turned their attention toward them.

Daoist Yuan Xiu maintained his stern expressions as he muttered, "They wouldn’t lend a hand when help was needed, but now they come to share the spoils."

"Even if they send people now, they'll be a step behind us..." Chang Yun responded briefly. But Yuan Xiu still felt uneasy, he feared more trouble might arise once they entered the grotto heaven. He secretly activated a divine ability to transmit a message, instructing Li Xuanfeng to take hold of the Huai River Map.

As he was transmitting the message, he suddenly realized the surroundings had gone completely silent. His previously relaxed brows slowly stiffened. When he sensed the aura emanating from the crystalline light pillar, his aged face froze in disbelief, eyes brimming with shock.

"This... this..."

The crystalline pillar emitted waves of pure white brilliance, and the aura it revealed caused an eerie silence to settle over the great void. The three-headed, six-armed Maha and the Merciful One calculated frantically, shocked into disbelief. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators looked at one another, their eyes filled with both wonder and obsession.

Bo Lie King Gao Fu stroked his long beard, his black cloak rippling as rings of crimson light radiated from behind him. Blazing True Flame burned from his robe into the surrounding void.

The bearded king murmured aloud, "Metallic Essence?"

His words rang out like a bottle shattering, shaking the entire great void. The Mahas immediately opened their eyes, the Merciful Ones rose to their feet, and all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators jolted with a resounding shout, "Metallic Essence!"

Metallic Essence!

The scene instantly exploded into a cascade of red, orange, green, and all colors imaginable. Multicolored light surged across the great void as over a dozen divine abilities activated simultaneously, flooding into Great Ning Heaven and erupting in a storm of radiant brilliance.

All arrangements and strategies were abandoned in an instant. There was Metallic Essence at stake. It was worth risking one's life for, so who could still think about measured moves? The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Mahas abandoned all restraint and, unlike their usual calculating selves, dove into the grotto heaven with ruthless decisiveness.

Rumble!

"Jinlian! You—!"

A furious roar rang out in the sky. A Maha revealed its true form with three heads and six arms. Its massive body filled the great void. Its golden chest was as vast as a mountain, and its eyes hung in the air like two suns. When it moved, golden dust scattered across the heavens. The dharma artifacts on its arms swayed gently, shaking the mountains and wilderness of the manifested world below.

Boom!

The Maha descended on Great Ning Palace, pressing down with such weight that the entire celestial palace groaned under the strain.

A voice rang out in shock and fury, "Stabilize the realm first! If Great Ning Palace collapses, none of us will be able to enter!"

The command caused only a brief pause in the air. Great Ning Palace’s barrier couldn’t withstand such overwhelming force, it was like snow meeting fire, it vanished in an instant. Dozens of divine hands simultaneously surged forth, forcibly keeping the celestial palace intact within the great void.

Daoist Master Yuan Xiu's eyes flew open, his expression shifting rapidly. All composure and dignity vanished as a fierce look spread across his aged face.

He shouted, "Qiushui! It's a relic from Ning State! It’s still within Great Ning Palace!"

Daoist Master Qiushui was equally stunned. She stared straight at the colorful light from the ruins, her heart pounding. Her pupils dilated as she suddenly looked up. One after another, Purple Mansion Realm cultivators revealed their forms, nearly compressing the great void into fragments.

"A major calamity is coming..."
